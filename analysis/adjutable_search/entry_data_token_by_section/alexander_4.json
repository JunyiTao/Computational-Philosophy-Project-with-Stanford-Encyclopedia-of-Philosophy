    "main_text": "Metaphysics and Related Views || Space, Time, and Deity\n3.2 Space, Time, and Deity\n\nThis difficult two-volume work sets out Alexander\u2019s grand\nmetaphysical picture, a sweeping system that offers a\ncosmogony, an explanation of how the world came to be in its\ncurrent state; and a hierarchical ontology based on emergence\nthat attempts to account for matter, life, mind, value, and deity.\nAlexander does not argue for this picture. Rather, he intends that his\npicture should provide a description of the world. This is in line\nwith his general methodology.\n\n\nPhilosophy proceeds by description; it only uses argument in order to\nhelp you to see the facts, just as a botanist uses a microscope.\n(Alexander 1921b: 423)\n\n\nThe idea is that Space, Time, and Deity offers a description\nof the world that best fits the facts.\n\nThe first chapter of Space, Time, and Deity opens with\nAlexander\u2019s proclamation that all the vital problems of\nphilosophy depend on space and time (Alexander 1920i: 35). Alexander\nconceives space and time as the stuff out of which all things are\nmade: space and time are real and concrete, and out of them emerge\nmatter, life, and so on. Space and time are unified in a\nfour-dimensional manifold, spacetime. This single vast entity does not\nmove but contains all motions within itself, and so Alexander labels\nit \u201cMotion\u201d. In this respect, Alexander\u2019s spacetime\nbears some resemblance to F. H. Bradley\u2019s (1893) Absolute:\nneither Motion nor the Absolute move or exist in time, but they both\ncontain motion and time within themselves.\n\nAlexander presents a metaphysical argument for the unity of space and\ntime, arguing they are merely distinguishable aspects of Motion. He\nargues that space and time must be unified because, when abstracted\naway from each other, it becomes clear that they could not exist\nindependently. Time would become a mere \u201cnow\u201d, incapable\nof succession; and space would become a mere \u201cblank\u201d,\nwithout distinguishable elements (Alexander 1920i: 47). Motion is both\nsuccessive and boasts distinguishable elements - this is\nbecause it is the union of space and time. Alexander\u2019s\nmetaphysical argument for this union was severely criticised by\n Broad (1921a,b).[2]\n Alexander considered his account of spacetime to be in line with the\nphysics of his day. The following might be understood as an\nargument from physics for his position:\n\n\nOur purely metaphysical analysis of Space-Time on the basis of\nordinary experience is in essence and spirit identical with\nMinkowski\u2019s conception of an absolute world of four dimensions,\nof which the three-dimensional world of geometry omits the element of\ntime. (Alexander 1920i: 87)\n\n\nAlexander goes on to distinguish between the characters of empirical\nexistents that are variable\u2014such as life, redness or\nsweetness\u2014and those that are pervasive.\n\n\n[These pervasive qualities] belong in some form to all existents\nwhatever. Such are identity (numerical identity for example),\nsubstance, diversity, magnitude, even number\u2026 The pervasive\ncategories of existence are what are known from Kant\u2019s usage as\nthe categories of experience, and I shall call them, in distinction\nfrom the empirical ones or qualities, categorial characters.\n(Alexander 1920i: 184\u20135)\n\n\nCategorial qualities are the properties of spacetime, and this is why\nthe categories apply to all things within spacetime. This discussion\nbuilds on Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe Method of Metaphysics; and the\nCategories\u201d (1912). In a later paper, \u201cSome\nExplanations\u201d (1921b), which aims to answer critics\u2019\nworries, Alexander explains that the existence of the categories\nimplies the existence of something that contains them: spacetime.\n\n\n[F]or me the doctrine of the categories, taken along with the notion\nof S-T [spacetime], is central\u2026 What is \u201crelation\u201d\nin virtue of which duration is a whole of related successive moments?\nWhat does relation stand for in our experience? I answer that it\nalready implies S-T, and that until it receives its concrete\ninterpretation it is in metaphysics a word. (Alexander 1921b:\n411\u20132)\n\n\nThe idea is that, by supposing the existence of spacetime, we explain\nthe existence of relations (characteristics of reality that hold\nbetween all things). Similarly, the existence of spacetime explains\nthe existence of all other categories. For more on relations, see\nAlexander\u2019s (1921b).\n\nThe second volume of Space, Time, and Deity asks how\nspacetime is related to the various levels of existence within it:\nmatter, life, mind and deity. Alexander argues we should model the\nemergence of levels within spacetime on the emergence of mind from\nbody:\n\n\nEmpirical things are complexes of space-time with their qualities, and\nit is now my duty to attempt to show how the different orders of\nempirical existence are related to each other\u2026 [T]he nature of\nmind and its relation to body is a simpler problem in itself than the\nrelation of lower qualities of existence to their inferior basis; and\nfor myself it has afforded the clue to the interpretation of the lower\nlevels of existence. (Alexander 1920ii: 3)\n\n\nAnalogous to the way that Alexander takes mind to emerge from body,\nnew levels of being emerge from spacetime when the motions within\nspacetime become complex enough:\n\n\nEmpirical things or existents are\u2026 groupings within Space-Time,\nthat is, they are complexes of pure events or motions in various\ndegrees of complexity. Such finites have all the categorial\ncharacters, that is, all the fundamental features which flow from the\nnature of any space-time\u2026 [A]s in the course of Time new\ncomplexity of motions comes into existence, a new quality\nemerges\u2026 The case which we are using as a clue is the emergence\nof the quality of consciousness from a lower level of complexity which\nis vital [i.e., life]. (Alexander 1920ii: 45)\n\n\nAlexander has been criticised for explaining the emergence of\nqualities within spacetime by analogy with mind-body emergence, as the\nlatter kind of emergence is rarely taken to be as unproblematic as\nAlexander appears to conceive it. For more on this, see for example\nEmmet (1950).\n\nAccording to Alexander, the emergence of new levels of being within\nspacetime is driven by a \u201cnisus\u201d, a striving or felt push\ntowards some end:\n\n\nThere is a nisus in Space-Time which, as it has borne its creatures\nforward through matter and life to mind, will bear them forward to\nsome higher level of existence. (Alexander 1920ii: 346)\n\n\nThis means that the emergence of qualities in spacetime is not merely\na process, it is a progress. Exactly what the nisus is has\ndivided\n commentators.[3]\n but however it is best understood, it pushes the emergence of new\nqualities within spacetime, and this includes the push towards\ndeity.\n\nThe second volume of Space, Time, and Deity also contains a\nrelatively brief discussion of beauty, and other forms of value.\nAlexander hugely expands on this account in his 1933 monograph;\n see Section 4.2 below.\n\nAlexander engaged in extended correspondence on Space, Time, and\nDeity: his letters with F. H. Bradley, C. D. Broad, and C.\nLloyd Morgan are particularly important. Some of the Bradley\ncorrespondence can be found in Bradley\u2019s (1999) Collected\nWorks. Other letters can be found in Samuel Alexander\nPapers, John Rylands Library, Manchester.\n\nSecondary literature on Alexander\u2019s spacetime metaphysics\nincludes Brettschneider (1964), Broad (1921a,b), Murphy\u2019s\n(1927\u20131928) series, Emmet (1950), Thomas (2013), Fisher (2015),\nand Rush (2021). Schaffer\u2019s (2009) argues for the identification\nof spacetime with matter, and traces this line of thought to\nAlexander. Secondary literature on Alexander\u2019s account of\nmind-body emergence include classic critiques from Broad (1921a,b),\nCalkins (1923) and Emmet (1950). Stout (1922) discusses and rejects\nAlexander\u2019s theory of perception. There has been more recent\nwork on Alexander\u2019s account of emergence in general; see\nMcLaughlin (1992), Gillet (2006), and O\u2019Connor and Wong\n(2012).\n",
