    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe abstract/concrete distinction has a curious status in contemporary\nphilosophy. It is widely agreed that the ontological distinction is of\nfundamental importance, but as yet, there is no standard account of\nhow it should be drawn. There is a consensus about how to classify\ncertain paradigm cases. For example, it is usually acknowledged that\nnumbers and the other objects of pure mathematics, like pure sets, are\nabstract (if they exist), whereas rocks, trees, and human beings are\nconcrete. In everyday language, it is common to use expressions that\nrefer to concrete entities as well as those that apparently refer to\nabstractions such as democracy, happiness, motherhood, etc. Moreover,\nformulations of mathematical theories seem to appeal directly to\nabstract entities, and the use of mathematical expressions in the\nempirical sciences seems indispensable to the formulation of our best\nempirical theories (see Quine 1948; Putnam 1971; and the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics).\n Finally, apparent reference to abstract entities such as sets,\nproperties, concepts, propositions, types, and possible worlds, among\nothers, is ubiquitous in different areas of philosophy.\n\nThough there is a pervasive appeal to abstract objects, philosophers\nhave nevertheless wondered whether they exist. The alternatives are:\nplatonism, which endorses their existence, and\nnominalism, which denies the existence of abstract objects\nacross the board. (See the entries on\n nominalism in metaphysics\n and\n platonism in metaphysics.)\n But the question of how to draw the distinction between abstract and\nconcrete objects is an open one: it is not clear how one should\ncharacterize these two categories nor is there a definite list of\nitems that fall under one or the other category (assuming neither is\nempty).\n\nThe first challenge, then, is to articulate the distinction, either by\ndefining the terms explicitly or by embedding them in a theory that\nmakes their connections to other important categories more explicit.\nIn the absence of such an account, the philosophical significance of\nthe contrast remains uncertain, for the attempt to classify things as\nabstract or concrete by appeal to intuition is often problematic. Is\nit clear that scientific theories (e.g., the general theory of\nrelativity), works of fiction (e.g., Dante\u2019s Inferno),\nfictional characters (e.g., Bilbo Baggins) or conventional entities\n(e.g., the International Monetary Fund or the Spanish Constitution of\n1978) are abstract?\n\nIt should be stressed that there may not be one single\n\u201ccorrect\u201d way of explaining the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. Any plausible account will classify the paradigm cases in\nthe standard way or give reasons for proceeding otherwise, and any\ninteresting account will draw a clear and philosophically significant\nline in the domain of objects. Yet there may be many equally\ninteresting ways of accomplishing these two goals, and if we find\nourselves with two or more accounts that do the job rather well, there\nmay be no point in asking which corresponds to the real\nabstract/concrete distinction. This illustrates a general point: when\ntechnical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of\nexamples, but without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration,\nthe resulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in reference.\nIn such cases, it usually is pointless to seek a single correct\naccount. A philosopher may find herself asking questions like,\n\u2018What is idealism?\u2019 or \u2018What is a substance?\u2019\nand treating these questions as difficult questions about the\nunderlying nature of a certain determinate philosophical category. A\nbetter approach may be to recognize that in many cases of this sort,\nwe simply have not made up our minds about how the term is to be\nunderstood, and that what we seek is not a precise account of what\nthis term already means, but rather a proposal for how it\nmight fruitfully be used for philosophical analysis. Anyone who\nbelieves that something in the vicinity of the abstract/concrete\ndistinction matters for philosophy would be well advised to approach\nthe project of explaining the distinction with this in mind.\n\nSo before we turn to the discussion of abstract objects in earnest, it\nwill help if we clarify how some of the key terms will be used in what\nfollows.\n",
