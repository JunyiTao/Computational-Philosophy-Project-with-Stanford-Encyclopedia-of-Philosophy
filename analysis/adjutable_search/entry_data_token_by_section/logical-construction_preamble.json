    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201clogical construction\u201d was used by Bertrand\nRussell to describe a series of similar philosophical theories\nbeginning with the 1901 \u201cFrege-Russell\u201d definition of\nnumbers as classes and continuing through his\n\u201cconstruction\u201d of the notions of space, time and matter\nafter 1914. Philosophers since the 1920s have argued about the\nsignificance of \u201clogical construction\u201d as a method in\nanalytic philosophy and proposed various ways of interpreting\nRussell\u2019s notion. Some were inspired to develop their own\nprojects by examples of constructions. Russell\u2019s notion of\nlogical construction influenced both Carnap\u2019s project of\nconstructing the physical world from experience and Quine\u2019s\nnotion of explication, and was a model for the use of set\ntheoretic reconstructions in formal philosophy later in the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nIt was only when looking back on his work, in the programmatic 1924\nessay \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d, that Russell first described\nvarious logical definitions and philosophical analyses as\n\u201clogical constructions\u201d. He listed as examples the\nFrege-Russell definition of numbers as classes, the theory of definite\ndescriptions, the construction of matter from sense data and then\nseries, ordinal numbers and real numbers. Because of the particular\nnature of Russell\u2019s use of \u201ccontextual\u201d definitions\nof expressions for classes, and the distinctive character of the\ntheory of definite descriptions, he regularly called the expressions\nfor such entities \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d and the entities\nthemselves \u201clogical fictions\u201d.\n\nLogical constructions differ in whether they involve explicit\ndefinitions or contextual definitions, and in the extent to which\ntheir result should be described as showing that the constructed\nobject is a mere \u201cfiction\u201d. Russell\u2019s 1901\ndefinition of numbers as classes of equinumerous classes is\nstraightforwardly a case of constructing one sort of entity as a class\nof others with an explicit definition. This was followed by the theory\nof definite descriptions in 1905 and the \u201cno-classes\u201d\ntheory for defining classes in Principia Mathematica in 1910,\nboth of which involved the distinctive technique of contextual\ndefinition. In a contextual definition apparent singular terms (either\ndefinite descriptions or class terms) are eliminated through rules for\ndefining the entire sentences in which they occur. Constructions which\nare like those using contextual definitions are generally called\n\u201cincomplete symbols\u201d, while those like the theory of\nclasses are called \u201cfictions.\u201d Russell included the\nconstruction of matter, space and time as classes of sense data at the\nend of his 1924 list. The main problem for interpreting the notion of\nlogical construction is to understand what these various examples have\nin common, and how the construction of matter is comparable to either\nof the early constructions of numbers as classes or the theory of\ndefinite descriptions and \u201cno-classes\u201d theory of classes.\nNone of the expressions \u201cfiction\u201d, \u201cincomplete\nsymbol\u201d or even \u201cconstructed from\u201d seems appropriate\nfor an analysis of the fundamental features of the familiar physical\nworld and the material objects that occupy it.\n",
