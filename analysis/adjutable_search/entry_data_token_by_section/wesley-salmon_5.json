    "main_text": "Confirmation || Absolute vs. Incremental Confirmation\n3.1 Absolute vs. Incremental Confirmation\n\nSalmon tackled the issue of confirmation of scientific hypotheses in\nChapter VII of The Foundations of Scientific Inference and in\na number of papers including 1973 and 1975b [2005]. He called\nattention to the difference between absolute confirmation,\ntaken to mean making highly probable, and incremental, or\nrelevance confirmation, taken to mean increasing the\nprobability of some hypothesis. According to Salmon, the distinction,\nalready made by Carnap in Logical Foundations of Probability,\nwas largely overlooked by subsequent literature, although failure to\nappreciate it can yield puzzling results. For instance, Carnap showed\nthat it can be the case that two pieces of evidence incrementally\nconfirm a given hypothesis, while their conjunction may disconfirm it.\nIn addition, Salmon pointed out that a piece of evidence that\nlogically entails the falsity of the conjunction of two hypotheses\ncould incrementally confirm each of them. In view of this and other\npuzzles, Salmon emphasized that \u201cwe have said very little when\nwe have stated merely that a hypothesis h has been confirmed\nby evidence i\u201d (Salmon 1975b [2005: 229]). Conversely,\nby appealing to Bayes\u2019 rule \u201cwe can aspire to a much\nfuller understanding of relations of confirmation (in both the\nabsolute and the relevance senses)\u201d (Salmon 1975b [2005:\n236]).\n",
