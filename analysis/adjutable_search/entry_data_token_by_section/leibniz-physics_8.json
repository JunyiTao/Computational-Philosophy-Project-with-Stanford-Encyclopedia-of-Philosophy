    "main_text": "Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics || Forces and Metaphysics\n3.3 Forces and Metaphysics\n\n\nIf the most important distinction of the Specimen Dynamicum \nwith respect to physics is between active and passive forces, its \nmost important distinction with respect to metaphysics is between \nwhat Leibniz calls \u201cprimitive\u201d and \n\u201cderivative\u201d forces. He holds that while derivative \nforces are of primary interest to the working physicist, they are \nmetaphysically secondary to primitive forces, and he speaks of the \nformer as being \u201cmodifications\u201d or \n\u201climitations\u201d of the latter (GM VI.236/AG 119). Although \nthe topic of the relationship between derivative and primitive forces\nquickly takes us away from Leibniz\u2019s treatment of physics and into \nthe heart of his metaphysics, it should be worthwhile to at least \ncall attention to this interface where what we are inclined to think \nof as Leibniz\u2019s physics so clearly bumps up against \u2013 indeed \noverlaps with \u2013 what we are inclined to think of as his \nmetaphysics. \n\n\nIt is widely accepted that Leibniz\u2019s primitive forces are supposed to\nserve as the intelligible metaphysical grounds for the forces that are\nof concern in physics, and more specifically that active derivative\nforces are to be grounded in active primitive forces while passive\nderivative forces are to be grounded in passive primitive\nforces. Furthermore, there is no denying that Leibniz sees his\ndistinction between active and passive primitive forces as being in\nsome way analogous to the distinction between Aristotelian form and\nmatter. Thus in the Specimen, he tells us that\n\u201cprimitive [active] force (which is nothing but the first\nentelechy) corresponds to the soul or substantial form [of\nthe scholastics]\u201d while \u201cthe primitive force of being\nacted upon or of resisting constitutes that which is\ncalled primary matter in the schools\u201d (GM VI.236\u2013237/AG\n119\u2013120). What has remained less certain is the answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhere, as it were, does Leibniz think active and\npassive primitive forces are located?\u201d \n\n\nAnswering this question is complicated by Leibniz\u2019s embrace of \nthe seemingly fantastic thesis that the gross bodies studied in \nphysics are to be understood as being composed of infinitely many \norganisms: \n\n\nI am very far removed from the belief that animate bodies are only a \nsmall part of the others. For I believe rather that everything is \nfull of animate bodies \u2026 and that since matter is endlessly \ndivisible, one cannot fix on a part so small that there are no \nanimate bodies within, or at least bodies endowed with a basic \nentelechy or \u2026 with a vital principle, that is to say \ncorporeal substances, about which it may be said in general of them \nall that they are living. (G II.118/Garber 1998, 294)\n\n\nThus, according to Leibniz, the block of wood that is pushed up an \ninclined plane, or the ball dropped from a leaning tower must be \ncomposed of infinitely many organisms, with each of those organisms \nbeing composed of further organisms, etc. These organisms therefore \nmust in some way be counted as more ontologically basic than the \ngross bodies which they compose. \n\n\nDrawing on his commitment to panorganicism, his talk of corporeal \nsubstances, and his explicit invocation of the Aristotelian notions \nof form and matter, it has been suggested that in his middle years \nLeibniz held to an essentially Aristotelian ontology according to \nwhich the fundamental level of reality is occupied by organisms \ncomposed of substantial forms and matter. As Daniel Garber \u2013 \nthe reading\u2019s most influential defender \u2013 puts the view, it is \n\u201ca world whose principal inhabitants are corporeal substances \nunderstood on an Aristotelian model as unities of form and matter, \norganisms of a rudimentary sort, big bugs which contain smaller bugs,\nwhich contain smaller bugs still, all the way down\u201d (1985, 29). \nAccording to this picture, the derivative forces studied by \nphysicists are grounded in the active and passive natures of the\norganisms from which they are composed. Organisms strive and are \nacted upon at the most basic level of ontology, and those strivings \nand passions serve as the ground for the active and passive \nderivative forces examined, for example, in collisions between \nelastic spheres. Although Leibniz\u2019s panorganicism remains striking, \nthis picture promises a relatively straightforward account of the foundations of \nLeibniz\u2019s physics, and squares tolerably well with many of his texts,\nespecially from his middle years. \n\n\nThe \u201cbugs all the way down\u201d model is not, however, the\nonly model of fundamental metaphysics that one can find in Leibniz\u2019s\nwritings. In his most mature works, Leibniz suggests that at the\ndeepest level of ontology, we find only simple, mind-like\nsubstances, or \u201cmonads.\u201d Although strictly indivisible,\nLeibniz insists that monads can nonetheless be thought of as unities\nof form, insofar as they are active, and matter, insofar as they are\npassive. According to this metaphysics, the gross bodies studied by\nphysicists are at least twice removed from monadic reality. Gross\nbodies are grounded in organisms, or \u201ccorporeal\nsubstances,\u201d while corporeal substances are themselves grounded\nin simple substances, or \u201cmonads.\u201d This same chain of\nontological dependence, however, likewise holds for forces: the active\nforces attributed to gross bodies are \u201cwell-founded\u201d in\nthe active forces attributable to organisms, which are\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d in the active forces of monads, just as the\npassive forces attributable to gross bodies are\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d in the passive forces attributable to\norganisms, which in turn are \u201cwell-founded\u201d in the passive\nforces of monads. A full understanding of these grounding relations\nwould of course require a more detailed explication of the relations\nbetween monads, corporeal substances, and gross bodies, as well as a\nfuller account of what\u201cgrounding\u201d amounts to in this\ncontext. Nonetheless, even this rough sketch should suffice to\nindicate the broad outlines of Leibniz\u2019s commitment to founding the\nactive and passive forces he postulates as part of his physics in the\nmost fundamental level of reality which he postulates as part of his\nmost mature metaphysics. \n",
