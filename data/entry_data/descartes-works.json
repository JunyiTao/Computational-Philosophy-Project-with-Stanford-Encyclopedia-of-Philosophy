    "main_text": "\n1. Early Years\n\nDescartes was born in La Haye on March 31, 1596 of Joachim Descartes\nand Jeanne Brochard. He was one of a number of surviving children (two\nsiblings and two half-siblings). His father was a lawyer and\nmagistrate, which apparently left little time for family.\nDescartes\u2019 mother died in May of the year following his birth,\nand he, his full brother and sister, Pierre and Jeanne, were left to\nbe raised by their grandmother in La Haye. At around ten years of age,\nin 1606, he was sent to the Jesuit college of La Fl\u00e8che. He\nstudied there until 1614, and in 1615 entered the University of\nPoitiers, where a year later he received his Baccalaureate and License\nin Canon & Civil Law. For the history and the text of his thesis,\nsee the following supplementary document:\n\nDescartes\u2019 Law Thesis\n\n\nIn 1618, at the age of twenty-two, he enlisted in the army of Prince\nMaurice of Nassau. It is not known what his duties were exactly,\nthough Baillet suggests that he would have very likely been drawn to\nwhat would now be called the Corps of Engineers (Baillet, Livre 1,\nChapitre 9, p. 41). This division would have engaged in applied\nmathematics, designing a variety of structures and machines aimed at\nprotecting and assisting soldiers in battle. Sorell, on the other\nhand, notes that in Breda, where Descartes was stationed, the army\n\u201cdoubled as military academy for young noblemen on the\nContinent\u201d (Sorell, p. 6). And, Gaukroger notes that the\neducation of the young noblemen was structured around the educational\nmodel of Lipsius (1547\u20131606), a highly respected Dutch political\ntheorist who received a Jesuit education at Cologne (Gaukroger, pp.\n65\u20136). Although the historical records point to there being a\nmilitary presence in Breda, there is no definitive evidence that\nspeaks for there being a full-fledged \u201cacademy\u201d. There are\nreasons for thinking that Descartes may have been a soldier, but the\nmajority of biographers suggest that it is more likely that his duties\nwere oriented more toward engineering or education.\n\nWhile stationed at Breda, Descartes met Isaac Beeckman\n(1588\u20131637). Notes that Descartes kept related to his\ncorrespondence reveal that he and Beeckman had become more than simple\nacquaintances\u2014their relationship was more one of teacher and\nstudent (Descartes being the latter). This relationship would rekindle\nin Descartes an intense interest in the sciences. In addition to\ndiscussions about a wide variety of topics in natural science, a\ndirect result of certain questions posed by Beeckman compelled\nDescartes to write the Compendium Musicae. Among other\nthings, the Compendium attempted to work out a theory of\nharmony rooted in the concepts of proportion or ratio, which (along\nthe lines of the ancients) attempted to express the notion of harmony\nin mathematical terms. It would not be published during\nDescartes\u2019 lifetime. As for Beeckman, Descartes would later\ndownplay his influence.\n2. The World and Discourse\n\nAfter Descartes left the army, in 1619, his whereabouts for the next\nfew years are unknown. Based on what he says in the Discours de la\nMethode (Discourse on the Method), published in 1637,\nthere is speculation that he spent time near Ulm (Descartes apparently\nattended the coronation of Ferdinand II in Frankfurt in 1619). There\nis some evidence suggesting that he was in France in 1622, for it was\nat this time that property he had inherited was sold\u2014the\nproceeds of which would provide him a simple income for many years.\nThere is some speculation that between 1623 and 1625 he visited Italy.\nDescartes emerges in 1625 in Paris, his notes revealing that he was in\ncontact with Father Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648), a member of the\nOrder of Minims. This relationship would prompt Descartes to make\npublic his thoughts on natural philosophy (science). It is by way of\nMersenne that Descartes\u2019 work would find its way into the hands\nof some of the best minds living in Paris\u2014for instance, Antoine\nArnauld (1612\u20131694), Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655), and\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679).\n\nIn 1628 Descartes left Paris. At this time he seems to have been\nworking on the Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii (Rules for\nthe Direction of the Mind), a work that he would abandon, some\nspeculating around the time of the move from Paris. It is worth noting\nthat relatively recently a copy of the Rules was discovered\nin a library at Cambridge University. Scholars are unsure how it got\nthere. Currently, based on what it includes, it is thought that this\nmanuscript represents the work as it stood when Descartes had\nabandoned it in 1628. The later Amsterdam printing (1701) and a copy\nthat Leibniz acquired from Clerselier (c. 1670) make certain\nadvancements over what is found in the Cambridge manuscript. So, it\nappears that Descartes picked up the work again. Some have speculated\nthat this may have happened after a visit in 1635 from John Dury\n(1596\u20131680) and Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662), where Hartlib\nreports that Dury had returned to England with copies of some of\nDescartes\u2019 works (Fallon, pp. 9f); the speculation being that\nthe recently discovered manuscript is related to something brought\nback by Dury. The meeting took place in The Hague. Dury and Hartlib\nwere friends of the Cambridge philosopher Henry More\n(1614\u20131687), with whom Descartes had corresponded, and of others\nin More\u2019s circle, including John Milton (1608\u20131674).\nPerhaps the copy was made during the visit and brought back to\nCambridge. (In any event, this is a new and interesting development in\nDescartes scholarship.) In 1630 Descartes moved to Amsterdam. There he\nworked on drafts of the Dioptrique (the Optics) and\nthe Meteors (the Meteorology), which were very\nlikely intended to be a part of a larger work, Le Monde\n(The World). In 1632 he moved again, this time to Deventer,\nto apparently teach Henry Reneri (1593\u20131639) his physics. It is\nalso during his stay in Deventer that Descartes probably worked on a\nfinal draft of the Traite de l\u2019homme (Treatise on\nMan), which in connection to the Optics and the\nMeteorology was probably originally intended to be a part of\nThe World.\n\nWhen The World had become ready for publication in 1633, upon\nhearing of the Church\u2019s condemnation of Galileo\n(1564\u20131642) in the same year, Descartes decided against its\npublication. For, the world system he had adopted in the book assumed,\nas did Galileo\u2019s, the heliocentric Copernican model. In a letter\nto Mersenne, dated November 1633, Descartes expresses his fear that\nwere he to publish The World, the same fate that befell\nGalileo would befall him. And, although this is something that he\nunderstandably would want to avoid, some scholars question\nDescartes\u2019 expressed concern, for his living in the Netherlands\nwould have kept him out of reach of Catholic authorities. The\nWorld appears to have been constituted of several smaller, but\nrelated, works: a treatise on physics, a treatise on mechanics\n(machines), a treatise on animals, and a treatise on man. Although\nmuch of The World has been lost, some of it seems to have\nsurvived in the form of essays attached to the Discourse\nwhich, as was mentioned earlier, would be published four years later,\nin 1637. And, some of it was published posthumously. Arguably,\nConstantijn Huygens (1596\u20131687) received what Descartes refers\nto as \u201cthree sheets\u201d of The World, along with a\nletter dated 5 October 1637. These \u201csheets\u201d deal primarily\nwith mechanics.\n\nAround 1635, at the University of Utrecht, Reneri began teaching\n\u201cCartesian\u201d physics. Also during this year, a domestic\nservant by the name of Helene gave birth to a baby girl, Francine.\nGenevieve Rodis-Lewis claims that Francine was born 19 June 1635\n(Rodis-Lewis, p. 40). According to a baptismal record, dated 28 July\n1635, Descartes is named the father (AT I 395n). However, Gaukroger\nclaims that the baptismal date was 7 August 1635 (Gaukroger, p. 294).\nIn 1636 Reneri acquired an official chair in Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Utrecht, and continued to build a following of students\ninterested in Cartesian science. Around March of 1636, at the age of\nforty, Descartes moved to Leiden to work out the publishing of the\nDiscourse. And, in 1637 it is published. With the\nDiscourse out and a following of students building in\nUtrecht, Descartes seems to have turned his attention from career to\nfamily. In a letter dated 30 August 1637 we find him apparently\nworking out an arrangement for Francine, but strangely refers to her\nas his \u201cniece\u201d\u2014which suggests that he did not want\ncertain people to know that he was a father (or that Francine had been\nborn out of wedlock). Gaukroger suggests that despite this apparent\ndenial of paternity, Descartes not only corresponds with Francine, but\nin 1637 brings her and Helene to his new home at Santpoort or\nEgmond-Binnen (Gaukroger, pp. 294, 332).\n\nThe Discourse is the first published work of\nDescartes\u2019, coming some four years after he had abandoned\nThe World. The Discourse is important for many\nreasons. For instance, it tells us what Descartes himself seems to\nhave thought of his early education, and in particular, his early\nexposure to mathematics. Roger Ariew suggests that these reflections\nare not so much those of the historical Descartes, as much as they are\nthose of a persona Descartes adopts in telling the story of the\nDiscourse (Ariew, pp. 58\u201363). Uncontested, however, is\nthe view that the Discourse sketches out the metaphysical\nunderpinnings of the Cartesian system. And, as a bonus, it has three\nworks that are attached to it that are apparently added so as to\nexemplify the method of inquiry it develops (though admittedly it is\nunclear how the method is applied in these essays). The attached\nessays are the Optics, the Meteorology, and Le\nGeometrie (the Geometry). As was suggested earlier, the\nOptics and Meteorology were very likely versions of\nworks originally intended for The World.\n\nIt should be stressed that the three attached essays are important\nindependent of the Discourse, for they contain much worth\nstudying. In the Optics, for example, Descartes works out his\nlaws of refraction, and within this context, what would later be\ncalled Snell\u2019s Law (which Descartes seems to have worked out as\nearly as 1632). Further, although the Geometry would seem to\nhave come out of nowhere, there is evidence in Descartes\u2019s notes\nto himself, from which Clerselier reconstructed some of\nDescartes\u2019s correspondence, that he had been working on some\nversion of it as early as 1619. In a letter to Beeckman, dated 26\nMarch 1619, for example, Descartes discusses the subject matter that\nis found in the Geometry, and in a letter dated 23 April\n1619, he explicitly mentions the book\u2019s title. It is in this\nwork that Descartes shows how certain geometrical problems can be\nsolved by way of algebraic equations.\n\nThe significance of the sort of connection that Descartes made between\ngeometry and algebra was great indeed, for without it the\nmathematization of the physics and the development of the calculus\nmight not have happened when they did\u2014a generation later via Sir\nIsaac Newton (1642\u20131727) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716). It should be noted, however, that as groundbreaking\nas this work may have been, contrary to the claims of many, nowhere in\nthe Geometry is a \u201cCartesian Coordinate System\u201d\never developed (that is, the x-y coordinate system\ntaught to today\u2019s students of algebra), nor is he the originator\nof other mathematical concepts that bear his name, for example, the\n\u201cCartesian Product\u201d. Carl Boyer notes that various\nconcepts that lead to analytic geometry are found for the first time\nin the Geometry, and that the Geometry\u2019s\nmathematical notation is still used today. But, he argues, although\nCartesian geometry is taken by many to be synonymous with analytic\ngeometry, the fact is that the fundamental aim of Descartes\u2019\nsystem is quite different from that of contemporary analytic geometry\n(Boyer, pp. 370\u20131). And so, the claim that Descartes is the\noriginator of analytic geometry, at least as we understand it today,\noverstates the case. As Boyer rightly points out, however, this does\nnot diminish the importance of the work in the history of\nmathematics.\n3. The Meditations\n\nIn 1639 Descartes began writing the Meditations. And, in 1640\nhe returned to Leiden to help work out its publication. During the\nyear, Descartes\u2019 daughter, Francine, died. There is evidence\nsuggesting that he was called away from Leiden around the time of her\ndeath, returning soon after. Some have speculated that he left Leiden\nto be at her side. Also during this year, Descartes\u2019 father and\nsister died. Descartes\u2019 relationship with his father (and\nbrother) was of the sort that Pierre, his brother, failed to even\nbother him with the news of their father\u2019s death. Rather, it\nseems to have been in a letter from Mersenne that Descartes first\nlearns of it. In a follow up letter to Mersenne, dated 3 December\n1640, Descartes expresses regret in not having been able to see his\nfather before his death. But, he refuses to leave Leiden to attend his\nfather\u2019s funeral, and instead stays to complete the publishing\nof the Meditations. \n\nToday, the Meditations is by far Descartes\u2019s most\npopular work\u2014though this would not have been the case in\nDescartes\u2019 day. This work is important to today\u2019s scholar\nfor many reasons, not the least of which is its including as an\nattached text written objections from some of the best minds living in\nParis. Mersenne sent the Meditations to philosophers and\ntheologians for criticism. The list of critics includes: Caterus,\nHobbes, Arnauld, Gassendi, and Mersenne himself, with several other\nunnamed readers who raised their objections through Mersenne. A later\nedition would include an objection from Bordin. Descartes replied to\neach critic, and the result was an appended text referred to as\n\u201cThe Objections and Replies.\u201d The second edition contains\nseven sets in all.\n\nThe Meditations opens by developing skeptical questions\nconcerning the possibility of knowledge. Through a series of several\ncarefully thought out meditations, the reader establishes (along with\nthe author) the groundwork for the possibility of knowledge\n(scientia). Descartes is not a skeptic, as some have insisted, but\nuses skepticism as a vehicle to motivate his reader to\n\u201cdiscover\u201d by way of philosophical investigation what\nconstitutes this ground. In the Second Replies, Descartes refers to\nthis style of presentation as the \u201canalytic\u201d style. There\nwere two styles of presentation: analytic and synthetic. It is\nimportant not to confuse these terms with those, say, used by Kant.\nFor Descartes the analytic style of presentation (and inquiry)\nproceeds by beginning with what is commonly taken to be known and\ndiscovering what is necessary for such knowledge. Thus, the inquiry\nmoves from what is commonly known to first principles. The\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d moves in such a way that each discovery is\nbased on what was discovered before. By contrast, the synthetic style\nof presentation begins by asserting first principles and then to\ndetermining what follows. Prompted by Mersenne, Descartes sketches out\nin the Second Replies a synthetic rendering of the\nMeditations.\n\nIn establishing the ground for science, Descartes was at the same time\noverthrowing a system of natural philosophy that had been established\nfor centuries\u2014a qualitative, Aristotelian physics. In a letter\nto Mersenne, dated 28 January 1641, Descartes says \u201cthese six\nmeditations contain all the foundations of my physics. But please do\nnot tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of\nAristotle to approve them. I hope that readers will gradually get used\nto my principles, and recognize their truth, before they notice that\nthey destroy the principles of Aristotle.\u201d Unlike his earlier\nwork, The World, the Meditations parts ways with the\n\u201cold\u201d science without explicitly forwarding controversial\nviews, like that of the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar\nsystem. Specifically, the Cartesian view denies that physics is\ngrounded in hot, cold, wet, and dry. It argues that contrary to\nAristotle\u2019s view, such \u201cqualities\u201d are not\nproperties of bodies at all. Rather, the only properties of bodies\nwith which the physicist can concern him or herself are size, shape,\nmotion, position, and so on\u2014those modifications that\nconceptually (or logically) entail extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth. In contrast to Aristotle\u2019s \u201cqualities,\u201d the\nproperties (or modes) of bodies dealt with in Cartesian physics are\nmeasurable specifically on ratio scales (as opposed to intensive\nscales), and hence are subject in all the right ways to mathematics\n(Buroker, pp. 596\u20137). This conception of matter, conjoined with\nthe sort of mathematics found in the Geometry, allies itself\nwith the work of such Italian natural philosophers as Tartaglia,\nUbaldo, and Galileo, and helps further the movement of early thinkers\nin their attempts to establish a mathematical physics.\n\nDescartes\u2019 letter to the \u201clearned and distinguished\nmen\u201d of the Sorbonne, which is appended to the\nMeditations, suggests that he was trying to pitch the\nMeditations as a textbook for the university. Though the\nendorsement of the Learned Men would not have guaranteed that the\nMeditations would be accepted or used as a textbook, it could\ncertainly be viewed as an important step to getting it accepted.\nUnlike today\u2019s notion of a textbook, in Descartes\u2019 day\n\u201ctextbooks\u201d were intended mostly for teachers, not\nstudents. Typically, at the close of a teacher\u2019s career, his\nnotes would be published for the benefit of those who would go on to\nteach such course material. The awkwardness of Descartes\u2019s\nseeking the acceptance and use of his Meditations by teachers\nis amplified by the fact that he was not a teacher himself.\nConsequently, his seeking \u201ctextbook\u201d status would have\nvery likely been viewed by those Learned Men as being a bit\npretentious. He was, it could be said, a freelancer with no academic\nor political ties to the university (outside of his connection to\nMersenne). And, he certainly lacked the credentials and reputation of\nsomeone like a Eustachius, whose widely used textbook of the period is\nof the sort the Meditations was in all likelihood aimed at\nreplacing. Although the Meditations seems to have been\nendorsed by the Sorbonne, it was never adopted as a text for the\nuniversity.\n4. The Principles\n\nSoon after his encounter with the Sorbonne, Descartes\u2019 public\nlife was further complicated by the Dutch theologian, Gisbert Voetius\n(1588\u20131676). Voetius had attacked Regius, a Dutch physician who\ntaught medicine at the University of Utrecht, for his having taught\ncertain \u201cCartesian\u201d ideas that conflicted with traditional\ntheological doctrine. Regius was friend to both Reneri and Descartes,\nand was a strong adherent to Descartes\u2019s philosophical views.\nVoetius tried to have Regius removed from his position as professor,\nand attacked not only Descartes\u2019 work but his character. In his\ndefense Descartes entered into the debate. The controversy would leave\nRegius confined to teaching medicine, and his published defense of\n(his conception of) Cartesian thought would be officially condemned by\nVoetius, who in five years time would rise to the position of\nUniversity rector. At the end of the debate, which off and on lasted\nabout five years, the situation ultimately became desperate for\nDescartes. He feared being expelled from the country and of seeing his\nbooks burned. He would even seek protection by asking the Prince of\nOrange to intervene and quell Voetius\u2019 attack.\n\nIn 1643, at the age of forty-seven, Descartes moved to Egmond du Hoef.\nWith the Voetius controversy seemingly behind him (though, as\nmentioned above, it would again raise its head and climax five years\ndown the road), Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia began to\ncorrespond. In this exchange, Princess Elisabeth probed Descartes on\nthe implications of his commitment to mind-body dualism. During this\ntime, he completed a final draft of a new textbook, which he had begun\nthree years earlier, the Principia Philosophiae\n(Principles of Philosophy), and in 1644 it was published. He\ndedicated it to Princess Elisabeth.\n\nThe Principles is an important text. The work is divided into\nfour Parts, with five hundred and four articles. Part One develops\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysics. Although it would appear to be a quick\nrun through of the Meditations, there are a number of\ndissimilarities. For example, the order of presentation of the proofs\nfor God\u2019s existence, which some have argued is significant,\nfound in the Third and Fifth Meditations, is reversed in the\nPrinciples. The principles introduced in Part Two are based\non the metaphysics of Part One. And, the subsequent physics developed\nin Parts Three and Four is based upon the principles of Part Two.\nAlthough the physics turns out to be unsound, the Principles\nnevertheless inspired such great thinkers as Robert Boyle\n(1627\u20131691), Edmond Halley (1656\u20131742), and Isaac Newton.\nAs an important side note, it must be stressed that even though\nDescartes had throughout his career put a great deal of emphasis on\nmathematics, the physics developed in the Principles does not\nappear to be a mathematical physics. Rather, it is traditionally taken\nto be a conceptual project with only a hint of empirical\novertones\u2014a physics rooted entirely in metaphysics. Arguably,\nhowever, Descartes\u2019 work on enumeration, order, and measure in\nthe Rules provides the conceptual machinery necessary for\nestablishing a \u2018mathematical\u2019 physics\u2014a conceptual\nmachinery that is carried over to the Principles (Smith 2003,\n2010). Two parts, never completed, were originally intended to deal\nwith plants, animals, and man. In light of this and what Descartes\nsays in a 31 January 1642 letter to the mathematician Constantijn\nHuygens, it is plausible to think that the Principles would\nhave looked something like The World had it been completed as\nplanned.\n\nOne of the more controversial positions the Principles\nforwarded, at least according to Newton, was that a vacuum was\nimpossible. Descartes\u2019 rejection of the possibility of a vacuum\nfollowed from his commitment to the view that the essence of body was\nextension. Given that extension is an attribute, and that nothing\ncannot possess any attributes (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210), it follows\nthat \u201cnothingness cannot possess any extension\u201d (AT VIIIA\n50; CSM I 231). So, any instance of extension would entail the\npresence of some substance (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210). In other words,\nvacuum, taken as an extended nothing, is a flat\ncontradiction. The corporeal universe is thus a plenum, individual\nbodies separated only by their surfaces. Newton argued in his De\nGravitatione and Principia that the concept of motion\nbecomes problematic if the universe is taken to be a plenum. Another\ncontroversial position was Descartes\u2019 insistence that matter is\ninfinitely divisible. Gassendi, and later Cordemoy, argued that there\nmust be a bottom, a \u2018substance,\u2019 to the physical universe\nupon which the being of all corporeal things depend. In line with the\nancient atomist Epicurus, they argued that if matter was infinitely\ndivisible, so dividing it would show that there was no\nbottom\u2014and so, corporeality would not be substantial. So, if\ncorporeality is substantial, as Descartes himself had claimed, there\nmust be a minimum measure of extension that could not be divided (by\nnatural means, anyway). And so, there are atoms. But, this conclusion\nis something that Descartes explicitly rejects in the\nPrinciples.\n5. The Passions\n\nIn 1646, as a result of the probings of Princess Elisabeth, Descartes\ncompleted a working draft of Passions de l\u2019ame\n(Passions of the Soul). During this year another prominent\npolitical figure began to correspond with Descartes, Queen Christina\nof Sweden. And, Regius published what he took to be a new and improved\nversion of Cartesian science, which as we now know would draw the\nwrath of Voetius. But Regius did not stop there, for he seemed to have\nfound important differences between his \u201cCartesian\u201d view\nand that of Descartes\u2019, and attempted to separate the two,\npublishing a broadsheet that listed twenty-one anti-Cartesian theses\n(which his version of \u201cCartesian\u201d science rejected). In\nresponse to this, Descartes wrote a single-page printed defense that\nwas posted on public kiosks for all to read. Published in 1648, the\nNotae in Programma Quoddam (Notes on a Program-also\nreferred to as Comments on a Certain Broadsheet) is\nDescartes\u2019 public defense. However, as mentioned earlier,\ntensions mounted as a result of the public exchange and Descartes felt\nhis way of life in the Netherlands to be threatened. As luck would\nhave it, an admirer and friend of Descartes\u2019\u2014Chanut, who\nworked for Queen Christina\u2019s court\u2014and Queen Christina\nherself began probing Descartes about the possibility of coming to\nSweden. And, after a not too lengthy correspondence, Queen Christina\noffered Descartes a position in her court. For many reasons, which\nwould certanily include those related to his concerns about Voetius,\nDescartes accepted the offer. And, in 1649 he left for Sweden. \n\nQueen Christina at first required very little from Descartes. However,\naccording to Gaukroger, this would change. For, after he had some time\nto settle in, she ordered him to do two things: first, to put all of\nhis papers in order, and secondly, to put together designs for an\nacademy (Gaukroger, p. 415). Arguably, Descartes had some idea of how\nthe latter might be done by way of his experience in Breda. In January\nof 1650 Queen Christina began to require Descartes to give her lessons\nin philosophy. These apparently would begin at five in the morning and\nwould last for about five hours. They were given three days a week\n(Gaukroger, p. 415). During this time Descartes published the\nPassions, the work having emerged primarily from his\ncorrespondence with Princess Elisabeth (to whom he had dedicated the\nPrinciples). One aim of the Passions was to explain\nhow the emotional (and thus moral) life of a human being was connected\nto the soul\u2019s being essentially united to a body. Simply put, a\n\u2019passion of the soul\u2019 is a mental state (or thought) that\narises as a direct result of brain activity. Such passions can move us\nto action. Since this is so, Descartes suggests that one needs to\nlearn to control one\u2019s passions, for they can move one to\nperform vicious acts. Critics of Descartes, including Elisabeth,\nargued that Descartes\u2019 metaphysical commitments put real\npressure on the view expounded in the Passions. For,\naccording to Descartes\u2019 metaphysics, the nature of mind is to\nthink and the nature of body is to be extended in length, breadth, and\ndepth. One view concerning causation, a view that Descartes\u2019s\ncritics seemed to have attributed to him, is that one thing causes\nanother to move, for example, by way of contact. Contact, in this\ncontext, seems to be possible only by way of surfaces. Now, bodies,\nsince they are extended and thus have surfaces, can come into contact\nwith one another and thus can cause one another to move. However, if\nminds are not extended, they lack surfaces. And, if they lack\nsurfaces, there is no way in principle for bodies to come into contact\nwith them. Thus, there is no way in principle for bodies to move\nminds, and vice versa. That is, minds and bodies cannot in principle\ncausally interact. And so, if the view expounded in the\nPassions requires that bodies and minds be capable of causal\ninteraction, and Descartes\u2019 metaphysical commitments make such\ninteraction impossible, Descartes\u2019 metaphysics puts a great deal\nof pressure on the view expounded in the Passions.\n\nAlthough things seemed to be moving forward, they were not going as\nwell as one would have hoped. In a letter to Bregy, for instance,\ndated 15 January 1650, Descartes expresses reservations about his\ndecision to come to Sweden. He sees himself to be \u201cout of his\nelement,\u201d the winter so harsh that \u201cmen\u2019s thoughts\nare frozen here, like the water\u201d (AT V 467; CSMK III 383). Given\nthe sentiment expressed in the letter, this remark was probably\nintended to be as much Descartes\u2019s take on the intellectual\nclimate as it was about the weather. In early February, less than a\nmonth after writing Bregy, Descartes fell ill. His illness quickly\nturned into a serious respiratory infection. And, although at the end\nof a week he appeared to have made some movement towards recovery,\nthings took a turn for the worse and he died in the early morning of\n11 February 1650. He was fifty-three years old.\n",
