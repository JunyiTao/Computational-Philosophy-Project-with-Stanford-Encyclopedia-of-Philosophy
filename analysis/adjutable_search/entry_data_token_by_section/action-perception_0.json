    "main_text": "Early Action-Based Theories\n1. Early Action-Based Theories\n\nTwo doctrines dominate philosophical and psychological discussions of\nthe relationship between action and space perception from the\n18th to the early 20th century. The\nfirst is that the immediate objects of sight are\ntwo-dimensional manifolds of light and color, lacking perceptible\nextension in depth. The second is that vision must be\n\u201ceducated\u201d by the sense of touch\u2014understood as\nincluding both kinaesthesis and proprioceptive position sense\u2014if\nthe former is to acquire its apparent outward, three-dimensional\nspatial significance. The relevant learning process is associationist:\nnormal vision results when tangible ideas of distance (derived from\nexperiences of unimpeded movement) and solid shape (derived from\nexperiences of contact and differential resistance) are elicited by\nthe visible ideas of light and color with which they have been\nhabitually associated. The widespread acceptance of both doctrines\nowes much to the influence of George Berkeley\u2019s New Theory\nof Vision (1709).\n\nThe Berkeleyan approach looks to action in order to explain how depth\nis \u201cadded\u201d to a phenomenally two-dimensional visual field.\nThe spatial ordering of the visual field itself, however, is taken to\nbe immediately given in experience (Hatfield & Epstein 1979;\nFalkenstein 1994; but see Grush 2007). Starting in the 19th\ncentury, a number of theorists, including Johann Steinbuch\n(1770\u20131818), Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881), Hermann von\nHelmholtz (1821\u20131894), Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920), and\nErnst Mach (1838\u20131916), argued that all abilities for\nvisual spatial localization, including representation of up/down and\nleft/right direction within the two-dimensional visual field, depend\non motor factors, in particular, gaze-directing movements of the eye\n(Hatfield 1990: chaps. 4\u20135). This idea is the basis of the\n\u201clocal sign\u201d doctrine, which we examine in\n Section 2.3.\n",
