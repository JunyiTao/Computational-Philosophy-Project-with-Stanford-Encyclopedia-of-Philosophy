    "main_text": "Correspondence revisited || Correspondence without facts\n3.1 Correspondence without facts\n\nTarski himself sometimes suggested that his theory was a kind of\ncorrespondence theory of truth. Whether his own theory is a\ncorrespondence theory, and even whether it provides any substantial\nphilosophical account of truth at all, is a matter of controversy.\n(One rather drastic negative assessment from Putnam (1985\u201386, p.\n333) is that \u201cAs a philosophical account of truth,\nTarski\u2019s theory fails as badly as it is possible for an account\nto fail.\u201d) But a number of philosophers (e.g., Davidson, 1969;\nField, 1972) have seen Tarski\u2019s theory as providing at least the\ncore of a correspondence theory of truth which dispenses with the\nmetaphysics of facts.\n\nTarski\u2019s theory shows how truth for a sentence is\ndetermined by certain properties of its constituents; in\nparticular, by properties of reference and satisfaction (as well as by\nthe logical constants). As it is normally understood, reference is the\npreeminent word-to-world relation. Satisfaction is naturally\nunderstood as a word-to-world relation as well, which relates a\npredicate to the things in the world that bear it. The Tarskian\nrecursive definition shows how truth is determined by reference and\nsatisfaction, and so is in effect determined by the things in the\nworld we refer to and the properties they bear. This, one might\npropose, is all the correspondence we need. It is not correspondence\nof sentences or propositions to facts; rather, it is correspondence of\nour expressions to objects and the properties they bear, and then ways\nof working out the truth of claims in terms of this.\n\nThis is certainly not the neo-classical idea of correspondence. In not\npositing facts, it does not posit any single object to which a true\nproposition or sentence might correspond. Rather, it shows how truth\nmight be worked out from basic word-to-world relations. However, a\nnumber of authors have noted that Tarski\u2019s theory cannot by\nitself provide us with such an account of truth. As we will discuss\nmore fully in section 4.2, Tarski\u2019s apparatus is in fact\ncompatible with theories of truth that are certainly not\ncorrespondence theories.\n\nField (1972), in an influential discussion and diagnosis of what is\nlacking in Tarski\u2019s account, in effect points out that whether\nwe really have something worthy of the name\n\u2018correspondence\u2019 depends on our having notions of\nreference and satisfaction which genuinely establish word-to-world\nrelations. (Field does not use the term \u2018correspondence\u2019,\nbut does talk about e.g., the \u201cconnection between words and\nthings\u201d (p. 373).) By itself, Field notes, Tarski\u2019s theory\ndoes not offer an account of reference and satisfaction at all.\nRather, it offers a number of disquotation clauses, such\nas:\n\n\u2018Snow\u2019 refers to snow.\n\\(a\\) satisfies \u2018is white\u2019 if and only if\n\\(a\\) is white.\n\n\nThese clauses have an air of triviality (though whether they are to be\nunderstood as trivial principles or statements of non-trivial semantic\nfacts has been a matter of some debate). With Field, we might propose\nto supplement clauses like these with an account of reference and\nsatisfaction. Such a theory should tell us what makes it the case that\nthe word \u2018snow\u2019 refer to snow. (In 1972, Field was\nenvisaging a physicalist account, along the lines of the causal theory\nof reference.) This should inter alia guarantee that truth is\nreally determined by word-to-world relations, so in conjunction with\nthe Tarskian recursive definition, it could provide a correspondence\ntheory of truth.\n\nSuch a theory clearly does not rely on a metaphysics of facts. Indeed,\nit is in many ways metaphysically neutral, as it does not take a stand\non the nature of particulars, or of the properties or universals that\nunderwrite facts about satisfaction. However, it may not be entirely\ndevoid of metaphysical implications, as we will discuss further in\nsection 4.1.\n",
