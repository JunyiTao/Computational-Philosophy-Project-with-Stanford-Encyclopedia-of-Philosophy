As we have seen, they are a core part of the explanation of\nhow words refer to things and how we use language to communicate. They\ndetermine what counts as correct \u201cdescribing,\u201d\n\u201csorting,\u201d and \u201cmatching\u201d of names and things\nand thus what knowledge is. The issues of how to distinguish the\n\u201csame\u201d from \u201cdifferent\u201d kinds of things and\nhow to identify particular individuals as belonging to one kind or\nanother are central issues in Mohist semantics and epistemology, and\nthrough them, in the Mohist theory of argumentation as well. \n\nThe Dialectics explore aspects of \u201csameness\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng \u540c) and \u201cdifference\u201d\n(y\u00ec \u7570) in several places. Fragments collected\nin the \u201cGreater Selection\u201d indicate that the writers were\ndeveloping a detailed classification of types of\n\u201csameness,\u201d and one canon (A88) appears to explore a\ncontrast between relative and absolute sameness or difference. Textual\nproblems make it impractical to discuss these passages here, but one\npair of canons presents a clear, intelligible taxonomy of four types\nof sameness and difference (A86\u201387): \n\nSameness in being identical or coextensive, as when two names\nrefer to the same sh\u00ed \u5be6 (object, event,\nsituation). This sort of sameness contrasts with difference in the\nsense of being two different sh\u00ed.\nSameness in being parts of the same unit (t\u01d0\n\u9ad4), as when things are included within a single whole\n(ji\u0101n \u517c). This contrasts with difference in the\nsense of not being connected or attached. The concept of a\n\u201cwhole\u201d here corresponds roughly to a mereological whole\nor fusion and includes functional wholes, such as the body. It may\ncover sets as well, although the textual evidence suggests that the\nMohists probably assimilated set-member relations to part-whole\n relations.[15]\n\nSameness in being together or united, as when things share the\nsame location. This contrasts with difference in the sense of not\nbeing in the same place. One suggestion is that this sense of\nsameness might refer to the relation between the hard and the white\nfeatures of a hard, white stone (B37), the body and \u201cthe\nknowing\u201d of a living thing (A22), or the length and breadth of\nan object (B4) (Graham 2003: 335). Different aspects or features of a single thing might be\nconsidered \u201cthe same\u201d in this sense. Another plausible hypothesis is that this type of sameness refers to things being grouped together on the basis of location or other extrinsic facts about them, such as how they are used. All the items in my desk drawer or all draft animals could be considered \u201cthe same\u201d in this sense and thereby take the same general \u201cname\u201d (Fraser forthcoming). Such groupings of things contrast with groupings on the basis of intrinsic similarity, the fourth type of \u201csameness.\u201d\nSameness in being \u201cof a kind\u201d (l\u00e8i\n\u985e), explained here as \u201chaving a respect in which they are\nthe same.\u201d This contrasts with difference in being \u201cnot of\na kind,\u201d which is \u201cnot the same in any respect.\u201d\nUnlike the first three types of sameness, being \u201cof a\nkind\u201d entails that things are intrinsically similar\n(ru\u00f2 \u82e5) in some respect other than that defined\nby these notions of \u201csameness.\u201d Being \u201cof a\nkind\u201d explains why things are referred to by the same \u201ckind name,\u201d or general term for things of that kind. As we saw in the section on\n language,\n the names of kinds apply to all the similar things that are members of the\nkind (A78). \n\n\nThis list invites an intriguing observation. The writers take the\ngeneral notion of \u201csameness\u201d (t\u00f3ng\n\u540c) to express (at least) four different types of relations: identity or\ncoextension; part-whole relations; being constituent\nfeatures of something or, alternatively, being grouped together on some extrinsic grounds; and sharing some intrinsic similarity and thereby being\n\u201cof a kind.\u201d These relations correspond roughly to those of identity, part versus\nwhole, constitution, set membership, and kind relations, which in European languages are all typically expressed using the verb to be, or the copula.\nWe can say, for example, that Cicero is Tully, in that he is\nidentical with Tully; that Cicero\u2019s finger is Cicero, in that it is part of the whole that is Cicero; that Cicero is his\nbody, in that he is constituted by his body; that Cicero is a magistrate, in that he was a Roman public official; and that Cicero\nis human, in that he is a member of the kind human.\n\n\nThis parallel between the forms of \u201csameness\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng) the Mohists identify and our use of to\nbe strongly suggests that the concept of \u201csameness\u201d\nplays a theoretical role for classical Chinese thinkers comparable to\nthat of to be or the copula in European languages. It is\nlikely that the Mohists and other early Chinese thinkers implicitly\nunderstood an assertion we would translate into the form\n\u2018A is B\u2019 as claiming that A and\nB are \u201cthe same,\u201d in one of the several senses\nspecified above. Evaluating the truth of such an assertion would be\nunderstood as evaluating whether A and B are indeed\n\u201cthe same\u201d in the relevant way. More generally, early\nChinese theorists probably regarded assertion, judgment, and reasoning\nall as processes of distinguishing whether things are \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or not. Stating a fact about the world would have been\nseen as a matter of identifying a sameness or difference, in one of\nfour (or more) senses of\n \u201csameness.\u201d[16]\n \u201cWhite horses are horses\u201d would be interpreted as in\neffect claiming that white horses and horses are \u201cthe\nsame,\u201d and \u201cOxen are not horses\u201d as claiming that\noxen and horses are \u201cdifferent.\u201d If these interpretive\nhypotheses are correct, then it is no exaggeration to say that\ndistinguishing same and different\u2014in effect, pattern recognition\nor analogical extension\u2014is the core explanatory notion\nunderlying classical Chinese philosophy of language, epistemology, and\nlogic.\n",
