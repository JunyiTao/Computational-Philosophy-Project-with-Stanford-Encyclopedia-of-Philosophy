    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric || What Rhetoric Is Useful for\n4.2 What Rhetoric Is Useful for\n\nFor Aristotle, who defines rhetoric in terms of considering what is\npersuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1)\n and sees it as a branch of dialectic (see above\n \u00a7 3),\n rhetoric is clearly not a matter of finding or conveying knowledge.\nFor Plato (see \u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n by contrast, this would have been reason enough to become suspicious\nabout the intentions of those who use rhetorical techniques.\nIsn\u2019t any technique of persuasion that is negligent of knowledge\nuseful only for those who want to outwit their audience and conceal\ntheir real aims? For, after all, someone who just wants to communicate\nthe naked truth could be straightforward and would not need to employ\nrhetorical gimmicks. This, however, is not Aristotle\u2019s point of\nview: Even those who are simply trying to establish what is just and\ntrue need the help of rhetoric when they are faced with a public\naudience. Aristotle points out that it is impossible to teach such an\naudience, even if the speaker has the most exact knowledge of the\nsubject (Rhet. I.1, 1355a24\u201329). Perhaps he is thinking\nof ordinary people attending a public speech who are not able to\nfollow the kind of argument that, according to Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of knowledge (see \u00a76 of\n Aristotle: logic),\n is apt to establish genuine knowledge. Moreover, he seems to doubt\nthat the controversial, sometimes partisan and hostile, setting of\npolitical or judicial speeches is suitable for teaching and learning\nat all, since whoever wishes to learn has to presuppose that he or she\nwon\u2019t be cheated or deceived by the teacher. But why should one\ntrust the intentions of the opposing party? This is why rhetorical\narguments addressing public audiences should be taken from premises\nthat are likely to be accepted by the given audience, from assumptions\nthe audience is already convinced of, and not from the kind of\nprinciples (accepted mostly or only by the experts) through which one\nconveys and establishes knowledge.\n\nMore than that, one might wonder whether the typical subject of public\nspeeches really allows of genuine knowledge. In court for example, the\njudges have to form a reasoned view about whether the accused person\nis guilty or not and whether the crime committed is minor or major; in\npolitical speeches the parties might contend about whether it is\nadvantageous or not to invade the neighbour\u2019s territory or to\nbuild a border wall (Aristotle\u2019s examples), but none of these\nquestions allow of precise knowledge. Aristotle says that in some\nquestions treated in public speeches there is only\namphidoxein, i.e. room for doubt and only divided opinions\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a8). From this perspective, rhetoric seems\nuseful especially for controversies about contingent matters that\ncannot be fixed by appealing to what we unmistakably know, but only by\nappealing to widely shared convictions, to what happens (not\nnecessarily, but) only for the most part and to what is likely to be\nthe case (but not necessarily so). For all those reasons, affecting\nthe decisions of juries and assemblies is a matter of persuasiveness,\nnot of knowledge. It is true that some people manage to be persuasive\neither at random or by habit, but it is rhetoric that gives us a\nmethod to systematically disclose all available means of\npersuasion on any topic whatsoever.\n\nWhen Aristotle speaks about the benefits of the art of rhetoric he\nalso mentions that it is not only disgraceful when one is unable to\ndefend oneself physically, but also when one is unable to defend\noneself through rational speech, for rationality and speech are more\npeculiar to human beings than physical strength (Rhet. I.1,\n1355a38\u2013b2). A certain familiarity with rhetoric is therefore\nrequired for sheer self-defence \u2014 in general and, perhaps,\nespecially under the conditions of the extreme Athenian form of\ndemocracy with its huge courts of lay assessors (one of which\nsentenced Socrates to death) and with demagogues who would abuse the\ndemocratic rules for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Perhaps Aristotle is\naddressing fellow philosophers who find it beneath their dignity to\nengage with rhetoric: it is not sublime but naive and embarrassing if\nthey do not gear up for political and legal battles. For those who are\ndefeated in court when they try to defend what is true and just (due\nto the failure to speak persuasively) are to be blamed (Rhet.\nI.1, 1355a20\u201324).\n",
