    "main_text": "Two Problems of Theoretical Terms || Theoretical Functions and Relations\n3.2 Theoretical Functions and Relations\n\nFor theoretical functions and relations, a particular problem arises\nfrom the idea that a theoretical term is, by definition, semantically\ndependent upon a scientific theory. Let us recall the above\nexplanation of T-theoreticity: a term t is\nT-theoretical if and only if any method of determining the\nextension of t, or some part of that extension, rests upon\nsome axiom of T. Let \\(\\phi\\) be such an axiom and m\nbe a corresponding method of determination. The\npresent explanation of T-theoreticity, then, means that m\nis valid only on condition of \\(\\phi\\) being true.\nThe latter dependency holds because \\(\\phi\\) is used either explicitly\nin calculations to determine t or in the calibration of\nmeasurement devices. Such devices, then, perform the calculation\nimplicitly. A case in point is measurement of temperature by a gas\nthermometer. Such a device rests upon the law that changes of\ntemperature result in proportional changes in the volume of gases.\n\nSuppose now t is theoretical with respect to a theory\nT. Then it holds that in order to measure t, we need\nto assume the truth of some axiom \\(\\phi\\) of T. Suppose,\nfurther, that t has occurrences in \\(\\phi\\), as is standard\nin examples of T-theoreticity. From this it follows that, in\nstandard truth-conditional semantics, the truth value of \\(\\phi\\) is\ndependent on the semantic value of t. This leads to the\nfollowing epistemological problem: on the one hand, we need to know\nthe extension of t in order to find out whether \\(\\phi\\) is\ntrue. On the other hand, it is simply impossible to determine the\nextension of t without using \\(\\phi\\) or some other axiom of\nT. This mutual dependency between the semantic values of\n\\(\\phi\\) and t makes it difficult, if not even impossible, to\nhave evidence for \\(\\phi\\) being true in any of its applications (cf.\nAndreas 2008).\n\nWe could, of course, use an alternative measurement method of\nt, say one resting upon an axiom \\(\\psi\\) of T, to\ngain evidence for the axiom \\(\\phi\\) being true in some selected\ninstances. This move, however, only shifts the problem to applications\nof another axiom of T. For these applications the same type\nof difficulty arises, viz., mutual dependency of the semantic values\nof \\(\\psi\\) and t. We are thus caught either in a vicious\ncircle or in an infinite regress when attempting to gain evidence for\nthe propriety of a single measurement of a theoretical term. Sneed\n(1979: ch. II) was the first to describe that particular difficulty in\nthe present manner and termed it the problem of theoretical\nterms. Measurement of the force function in classical mechanics\nexemplifies this problem well. There is no method of measuring force\nthat does not rest upon some law of classical mechanics. Likewise, it\nis impossible to measure temperature without using some law that\ndepends upon either phenomenological or statistical\nthermodynamics.\n\nAlthough its formulation is primarily epistemological, Sneed\u2019s\nproblem of theoretical terms has a semantic reading. Let the meaning\nof a term be identified with the methods of determining its extension,\nas suggested in\n Section 1.2.\n Then we can say that our understanding of T-theoretical\nrelations and functions originates from the axioms of the scientific\ntheory T. In standard truth-conditional semantics, by\ncontrast, one assumes that the truth value of an axiom is determined\nby the semantic values of those descriptive symbols which have\noccurrences in \\(\\phi\\). Among these symbols, there are theoretical\nterms of T. Hence, it appears that standard truth-conditional\nsemantics does not accord with the order of our grasping the meaning\nof theoretical terms. In the next section, we will deal with indirect\nmeans of interpreting theoretical terms. These proved to be ways out\nof the present problem of theoretical terms.\n",
