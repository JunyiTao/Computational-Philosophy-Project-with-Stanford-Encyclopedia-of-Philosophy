    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s View of the mind || Synthesis: A 90\u00b0 Turn\n3.3 Synthesis: A 90\u00b0 Turn\n\n\nWith the synthesis of recognition, TD should be close to complete.\nKant merely needs to argue that these concepts must include the\ncategories, which he does at A111, and that should be that.\n\n\nBut that is not that. In fact, as we said earlier, we are only about\none-third of the way through the chapter. The syntheses of\napprehension, reproduction, and recognition of single objects march in\na single temporal/object-generational line. Suddenly at A106 Kant makes\na kind of 90o turn. From the generation of a representation\nof individual objects of experience over time, he suddenly\nturns to a form of recognition that requires the unification and\nrecognition of multiple objects existing at the same time. He\nmoves from acts of recognition of individual objects to unified acts of\nrecognition of multiple objects which \u201cstand along side one\nanother in one experience\u201d (A108). This 90o turn is a\npivotal moment in TD and has received less attention than it\ndeserves.\n\n\nThe move that Kant makes next is interesting. He argues that the\nmind could not use concepts so as to have unified objects of\nrepresentation if its consciousness were not itself unified\n(A107\u2013108). Why does consciousness and its unity appear here? We have\nbeen exploring what is necessary to have experience. Why would it\nmatter if, in addition, unified consciousness were necessary? As Walker\n(1978, p. 77) and Guyer (1987, pp. 94\u20135) have shown, Kant did not need\nto start from anything about the mind to deduce the\nCategories. (A famous footnote in The Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science [Ak. IV:474fn.] is Kant\u2019s best-known comment on\nthis issue.) So why does he suddenly introduce unified\nconsciousness?\n\n\nSo far Kant has \u2018deduced\u2019 only three of the four kinds\nof categorical concepts, number, quality, and modality. He has said\nnothing about the relational categories. For Kant, this would have been\na crucial gap. One of his keenest overall objectives in CPR is\nto show that physics is a real science. To do this, he thinks that he\nneeds to show that we must use the concept of causality in experience.\nThus, causality is likely the category that he cared more about than\nall the other categories put together. Yet up to A106, Kant has said\nnothing about the relational categories in general or causality in\nparticular. By A111, however, Kant is talking about the use of the\nrelational categories and by A112 causality is front and centre. So it\nis natural to suppose that, in Kant\u2019s view at least, the material\nbetween A106 and A111 contains an argument for the necessity of\napplying the relational categories, even though he never says so.\n\n\nUp to A106, Kant has talked about nothing but normal individual\nobjects: a triangle and its three sides, a body and its shape and\nimpenetrability. At A107, he suddenly begins to talk about tying\ntogether multiple represented objects, indeed \u201call possible\nappearances, which can stand alongside one another in one\nexperience\u201d (A108). The solution to the problem of showing that\nwe have to use the category of causality must lie somewhere in this\nactivity of tying multiple objects together.\n\n\nThe passage between A106 and A111 is blindingly difficult. It takes\nup transcendental apperception, the unity and identity of the mind, and\nthe mind\u2019s consciousness of itself as the subject of all its\nrepresentations (A106\u2013108). I think that this passage introduces either\na new stage or even a new starting point for TD. Here many commentators\n(Strawson, Henrich, Guyer) would think immediately of\nself-consciousness. Kant did use consciousness of self as a starting\npoint for deductions, at B130 in the B-edition for example. But that is\nnot what appears here, not in the initial paragraphs anyway.\n\n\nWhat Kant does say is this. Our experience is \u201cone\nexperience\u201d; \u201call possible appearances \u2026 stand\nalongside one another in one experience\u201d (A108). We have\n\u201cone and the same general experience\u201d of \u201call\n\u2026 the various perceptions\u201d (A110), \u201ca connected\nwhole of human knowledge\u201d (A121). Let us call this general\nexperience a global representation.\n\nTranscendental apperception (hereafter TA) now enters. It\nis the ability to tie \u2018all appearances\u2019 together into\n\u2018one experience\u2019.\nThis transcendental unity of apperception forms out of all\npossible appearances, which can stand alongside one another in one\nexperience, a connection of all these representations according to\nlaws. [A108]\n\n\nIt performs a \u201csynthesis of all appearances according to\nconcepts\u201d, \u201cwhereby it subordinates all synthesis of\napprehension \u2026 to a transcendental unity\u201d (A108). This, he\nthought, requires unified consciousness. Unified consciousness is\nrequired for another reason, too. Representations\ncan [so much as] represent something to me only in so far\nas they belong with all others to one consciousness. Therefore, they\nmust at least be capable of being so connected [A116].\n\n\nThe introduction of unified consciousness opens up an important new\nopportunity. Kant can now explore the necessary conditions of conscious\ncontent being unified in this way. To make a long story short, Kant now\nargues that conscious content could have the unity that it does only if\nthe contents themselves are tied together\n causally.[5]\n\n\n\nWith this, his deduction of the relational categories is complete\nand his defence of the necessity of physics is under way. The notion of\nunified consciousness to which Kant is appealing here is interesting in\nits own right, so let us turn to it\n next.[6]\n\n",
