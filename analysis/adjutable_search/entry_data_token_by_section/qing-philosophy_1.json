Vitalism: Metaphysical Reorientation\n\nVitalism as an expression of Qing philosophy focused on evidence\nprovided by the self, the body, and external things. Opposed to the\nmysticism of an eternal and transcendent creative power such as\nprinciple (li), heaven (tian) or the Way\n(dao) that represented the essence of being, vitalism was in\nfavor of a view of life grasped from within the actualities of the\nindividual self and the external world. It stressed the immediate and\nultimate completion of a concrete and dynamic life expressed in terms\nof qi (material force/psycho-physical force) and qi\n(concrete implements). It may be conceived as a dynamic monism:\ndynamic in the sense that it rejected an immutable dao in\nfavor of a relativized way of contingent and finite truths; and\nmonistic in that it dissolved the li-qi dichotomy, subsuming\nli, which had been considered to be the prior metaphysical\nand spiritual realm, under qi, the perceptual and\nexperiential realm that had been regarded as secondary. Life within\nthe vitalist framework was dependent on circumstances, particularized,\nand individualized by the external signs of the self\u2019s\ncontingency and finitude, including the senses, feelings, desires, and\nemotions. Scholars of late imperial Chinese thought, such as Theodore\nbe Bary, Irene Bloom, and Yamanoi Y\u016b , have pointed to the\ngrowing preponderance of this qi-based vitalist philosophy\nsince the late Ming period, which offered a new sense of coherence in\nthe thinking about individuals and the world. But it would be\nmisleading to characterize Qing philosophy as entirely grounded in\nsome sort of formalized qi-oriented metaphysics, to the\nextent that philosophical lucubration in terms of the Confucian\ncategories of li and qi had ceased to hold the\nimagination of the thinkers. While qi, representing the\nmaterial and experiential domain of life, did become ascendant in\nintellectual discourse, the Qing posture was distinctly averse to\nmetaphysical pondering. Vitalism, with qi as its predicate,\nwas a pervasive attitude that attached foremost importance to concrete\nrealities and actions, inverting the Neo-Confucian metaphysical\ntendency to reduce humanity and things to an attribute, manifestation,\nand appearance of li and dao. Qi now\nreigned supreme.\n\nIn the early Qing, the most systematic articulation of the vitalist\nphilosophy can be found in the writings of Wang Fuzhi\n(1619\u20131692), who expanded the qi-based metaphysics of\nthe celebrated Song master, Zhang Zai (1020\u20131077). Wang asserted\nthat qi was what li followed. He claimed: \n\n\nIn actuality, li exists within qi. Qi is nothing but\nli. When [qi] agglomerates and produces humanity and\nthings, forms (xing) appear. When [qi] disperses\ninto the supreme void (taixu), it is then formless. (Wang\nQSYS: 1:5b) \n\n\nWhile li and qi were one, it was the latter that\ngave reality its form. In fact, qi was the basic stuff of the\nultimate supreme void, as Wang averred: \n\n\nTo say that humanity is born without the nourishment of qi,\nthat li could be sought outside of qi, that forms\nare illusions, and that the nature (xing) is real, is to\ndegenerate into heterodoxy. (QSYS: 1:6b) \n\n\nIt is important to note that even though Wang followed Zhang, he\nrejected the latter\u2019s philosophical anthropology, which\nseparated humanity\u2019s so-called \u201cheaven-nature\u201d\nstemming from li from its \u201cphysical nature\u201d\nderived from qi. Wang told us:\n\n\nWhen one speaks of the physical nature, it is like saying that the\nnature lies within the matter of qi (qizhi). This\nmatter (zhi) is humanity\u2019s material form (qizhi zhi\nxing), within the confines of which the principle of life\n(sheng zhi li) is manifested. Since it [i.e., the principle\nof life] lies within this matter, qi permeates it, and just\nas what fills the universe both inside and outside the human body is\nnothing but qi, so it is nothing but principle. Principle\noperates within qi, where it controls and apportions\nqi. Thus the matter [of individual things] envelops\nqi, and qi envelops principle. It is because this\nmatter envelops qi that a given individual possesses a\nnature. For this reason, before one\u2019s development has taken\nplace, there can only be the li and qi of the\nuniverse but not the individual person. Once, however, there is the\nmatter incorporating qi, this qi then inevitably\npossesses principle. As far as humanity is concerned\u2026, this\nnature as found in the matter of qi [i.e., physical nature]\nis still the original nature. (quoted in McMorran 1975: 443)\n\n\nIn short, Wang contended that our so-called physical nature was the\noriginal nature, by no means secondary to our heaven-nature. He,\nunlike Zhang, did not attribute our aggressiveness and aggrandizement\nto the inferior qi of the physical nature. Wang saw both\nprinciple and human desires (yu) as natural (ziran).\nThe tradition of ritual-propriety (li) expressed our desires:\n\n\n\nAlthough ritual propriety is purely the external adornment of the\nprinciple of heaven, it must reside in human desires for it to be\nseen. That being the case, in the final analysis, there cannot be a\nheaven that is separate from humanity, or principle separate from\ndesires\u2026. Hence in sounds, colors, smells, and flavors, one can\nclearly see the communal desires (gongyu) of all beings and\ntheir communal principle (gongli). (Wang QSYS: 8:10b-11a)\n\n\n\nTo Wang, the way of kingship (wangdao) was also intimately\nrelated to human sentiments (renqing): \n\n\nThe way of kingship is based on human sentiments. Human sentiments are\nthe same sentiments shared by both the profound person\n(junzi) and petty person (xiaoren)\u2026. Mencius,\nunderstanding thoroughly the origin of the oneness of heaven\u2019s\nprinciple (tianli) and human sentiments, recognized the\npossibility of the way of kingship. After seeing the beginning, it\ncould then be extended and expanded\u2026. Heaven\u2019s principle\nresides in private desires (siyu). (Wang QSYS: 26:2a-3b)\n\n\nThus, Wang connected values\u2014ritual-propriety, the way of\nkingship, communal principle\u2014with private feelings, as the body\nand its affections became a locus of ethical experience,\nli-principle. In explicating the idea of \u201cfully\nrealizing our nature\u201d (jinxing), he argued that\neverything in the world was of the same origin as oneself. Therefore,\nthe individual was the fulcrum on which the world moved, and this\nmandated an active life. Practice, or xi, was the key to\nexhaustively realizing and fulfilling our nature, which was the\nnurturing of our very qi: \n\n\nAs for changing the bad to the good, it is a matter of nurturing\none\u2019s qi well. In time, one\u2019s substance\n(zhi) is altered accordingly\u2026. This is human ability,\nwhich is practice precisely. Thus, qi changes with practice,\nand nature is realized with practice. Substance is the residence of\nnature, nature is the regulating of qi, and qi is\nthe substantiation of substance. [Qi] is what practice can\ncontrol. (Wang QSYS: 7:11a-b) \n\n\nIn short, Wang not only collapsed the li-qi dyad into the\nmonism of qi but he also understood qi, the basic\nstuff of the universe, in terms of human agency and action.\n\nGu Yanwu (1613\u20131682), also saw qi as the generative\nforce in the cosmos: \n\n\nReplete in heaven-and-earth is qi. When qi prospers,\nit becomes shen (spirit). Shen is the qi of\nheaven-and-earth and the human mind. (Gu RZL: 1:20) \n\n\nHe continue to say, \n\n\nCoalescing to form a body is called wu (things/affairs);\ndispersal in a shapeless manner is called bian\n(change)\u2026. Coalescing is the coalescing of qi;\ndispersal is the dispersing of qi. (RZL: 1:20) \n\n\nQi was self-sufficient and all-pervasive, identified with\nthings, objects, events, and affairs, without which \u201cthe\ndao has nowhere to reside\u201d (RZL: 1:20). Similarly,\nHuang Zongxi (1610\u20131695), a polymath who was Gu Yanwu\u2019s\nand Wang Fuzhi\u2019s contemporary, saw the inextricable conflation\nof li and qi as a foremost ontological fact:\n\u201cLi is the li of qi. If there is no\nqi, then there is no li\u201d (Huang MRXA: 140).\nTheir difference rests merely on semantics: \n\n\nThe terms li and qi are made up by people. In\nspeaking of the phenomena of floating, submerging, rising, and\nfalling, there is qi. In speaking of the unmistakable laws of\nfloating, submerging, rising, and falling, there is li. In\nthe end, they are the two names of one entity, not two entities in one\nbeing. (Huang MRXA: 1064) \n\n\nHe further explained, \n\n\nWithin heaven-and-earth, there is only one qi. Its rise and\nfall, and comings and goings, are the li. Apprehended by a\nperson\u2026 [li] becomes the mind-heart, which is also\nqi. If qi is not self-governed, why is it that after\nspring, there inevitably come summer, autumn, and winter? What\ncontrols the blossoming and withering of plans, the mildness and\nruggedness of the topography, the good and the bad movements of\nastrological portents, and the birth and growth of humanity and\nthings? All are governed by qi. Since it is self-governed, it\nis called li. (Huang MRXA: 46) \n\n\nHuang dissolved the li-qi duality by arguing that li\nby itself did not exist, insofar as it was an abstraction of the\nmaterial and the experiential.\n\nIn anthropological terms, Huang remarked that \n\n\nwhat in heaven is qi is the mind-heart in humanity. What in\nheaven is li is the nature in humanity. Just as li\nand qi are the same, so too are the mind-heart and nature.\n(Huang MRXA: 1109)\n\n\nHere, Huang critiqued Zhu Xi\u2019s (1130\u20131200) tendency to\nseparate the original human nature from the mind-heart, which was the\nsite of sentiments and feelings of \u201cpleasure, anger, sorrow, and\njoy\u201d. To Huang, these emotions and affections, in their state of\n\u201cequilibrium and harmony\u201d, are the nature. Therefore, \n\n\nto seek the nature outside of this cognitively natural and\nself-regulating mind-heart is like abandoning the flexible and\nchanging qi in order to seek a separate li. (Huang\nMRXA: 1109\u20131110) \n\n\nHuang thus invested human feelings with the steadfast solidity of the\nontological substance of qi, which was the source of the\ncardinal virtues of ren (benevolence), yi\n(rightness), li (propriety) and zhi (wisdom): \n\n\nReplete in heaven-and-earth is qi. Movement of this one\nqi in the human mind-heart\u2026 naturally separates into\npleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy. Accordingly, the names of\nbenevolence, rightness, propriety, and wisdom arise. Separate from\nqi, there is no li; separate from the mind-heart,\nthere is no nature. (Huang MRXA: 1512) \n\n\nThe early Qing vitalist philosophy of qi found full\nexpression in the eighteenth century, which witnessed a strong\naffirmation of the primacy of materiality. In particular, Dai Zhen\n(1723\u20131777) systematically developed a philosophy based on the\npresupposition that the dao was constituted by things: \n\n\nDao is the name that refers to actual bodies and actual\naffairs\u2026. Speaking of the dao in terms of\nheaven-and-earth, it can readily be seen with reference to its actual\nbodies and actual affairs\u2026. Speaking of the dao in\nterms of humanity, it is the concrete affairs of quotidian\npracticality in human relations that pervade the dao\u2026.\nNone that arise from the body are not the dao\u2026. The\ndao is living, drinking, eating, talking, and moving.\nOne\u2019s self and what surround oneself are all appropriately\n[regarded as the dao]. (Dai MZZYSZ: 69\u201372) \n\n\nDai criticized the Song Neo-Confucians for artificially separating\nmoral values from everyday social relations and activities, insofar as\nthey identified the moral virtues of benevolence, rightness,\npropriety, and wisdom with the \u201cempty, boundless, and\nsubtle\u201d principle, which, being prior and primary, was\n\u201cabove the realm of corporeal forms\u201d (xing er\nshang), as opposed to diurnal actions and pursuits, which was\nseen to be \u201camidst the realm of corporeal forms\u201d (xing\ner xia) and therefore, posterior and secondary. As far as Dai was\nconcerned, such axiology could find no corroboration in the classics:\n\n\n\n[The Song Confucians claimed that] with respect to heaven-and-earth,\nyin-yang cannot be called the dao; with respect to humanity,\nthe physical endowment (qibing) cannot be called the nature\n(xing), and affairs and things of daily practicality in human\nrelations cannot be called the Way (dao). There is nothing in\nthe texts of the Six Classics, Confucius, and\nMencius that agrees with them. (Dai MZZYSZ: 71\u201372)\n\n\nTo Dai, principle was not abstract and transcendent: \u201cWith\nregard to heaven-and-earth, humanity and things, and affairs and\nactions, I have not heard of a principle that cannot be verbally\narticulated\u201d (Dai MZZYSZ: 38). Li, as the inner texture\nof things (tiaoli), did not exist in the mind-heart as a\nmetaphysical entity and was found in the midst of all things. Indeed,\nit could not be severed from human feelings (qing) and\ndesires (yu). Dai differentiated between what was naturally\n(ziran) and what was necessarily so (biran): \n\n\nThe desires of the nature are the signs of the natural. The virtue of\nthe nature is conducive to the attainment of what was necessarily so.\nWhat is conducive to the attainment of what was necessarily so\nconforms to and perfects what is natural about heaven-and-earth. This\nis called the utmost attainment of that which is naturally so. (quoted\nin Y\u00fc Ying-shih 1982: 386) \n\n\nWhat were naturally so were the desires and daily activities of human\nbeings; that which was necessarily so was the inner texture of the\nnatural, that is, principle. The natural was the foundation on which\nthe necessitarian principle rested: \n\n\nThe ears, the eyes, and all the other bodily organs desire those\nthings on which our physical nature (qizhi zhi xing) depends\nfor nourishment. The so-called human desires of human nature originate\nfrom the Way of the formation and transformation of heaven-and-earth\n(tiandao). In the case of humanity, they are rooted in human\nnature and expressed in daily affairs. In this sense, they constitute\nthe Way of humanity (rendao). (Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 76).\n\n\n\nSince desires, as integral parts of the physical nature, constituted\nboth the Way of humanity and the Way of heaven, human nature could not\nbe, as the Song masters had contended, bifurcated into its\nmoral-heavenly manifestation and material-earthly disclosure. Dai\nasserted that the nature, xing, was whole, comprising both\nblood and breath (xueqi)\u2014the\npsycho-physiological\u2014and the mind-heart and wisdom\n(xinzhi)\u2014the cognitive-spiritual.  Both, as a whole,\nwere derived from \u201cyin-yang and the five agents\u201d, and\n\u201coriginated from the process of the production and\ntransformation of heaven-and-earth\u201d (yuan yu tiandi zhi\nhua). He waxed rhetorical, \n\n\nAs for the fact that a person is a person, if physical endowment\n(qibing) and physical constitution (qizhi) are cast\naside, in what way can a person be described as a person? (Dai MZZYSZ:\n51)\n\n\nDai\u2019s arguments struck at the heart of the Neo-Confucian\nmetaphysical conception of principle, the Way of heaven, and moral\nnature as prior and fundamentally substantive. Instead, he construed\nqi as the basic stuff out of which all things and the nature\nwere wrought, and in the process, he stressed the materiality and\nconcreteness of all beings.\n\nIn sum, a vitalist sensibility animated the philosophical thoughts of\nmany a Qing thinker, placing qi and its manifestations at the\ncenter of life and the world. But we must bear in mind the caveat that\nsuch thinking amounted to no materialism or naturalism in the western\nphilosophical sense of the words. Material human desires in themselves\nwere never considered to be a principle, even though they were\nconceived as integral and authentic components of a holistic nature.\nNevertheless, if it was not full-fledged formal philosophy, the\nqi-based worldview was a fundamental attitude and disposition\nthat located life\u2019s meanings, possibilities, and motives in the\nactualities of the corporeal world. As qi dislodged the\nimportance of li, knowledge acquired through the\nsenses\u2019 commerce with the workaday world (wenjian zhi\nzhi), as opposed to moral knowledge attained through intuitive\nknowing of the virtuous nature (dexing zhi zhi), claimed\npriority. In an a-metaphysical age that was the Qing, there was no\ntriumph of qi-oriented thinking qua philosophy, but a\nvitalist ontology did furnish a criterion of intelligibility that\nundergirded the other modes of intellection\u2014historicism,\nutilitarianism, intellectualism.\n",
