    "main_text": "Reputation\n2. Reputation\n\nAs the above (by no means complete) account of his public recognition\nreveals, in his own day Bradley\u2019s intellectual reputation stood\nremarkably high: he was widely held to be the greatest English\nphilosopher of his generation, and although the idealists were never a\ndominant majority, amongst some philosophers the attitude towards him\nseems to have been one almost of veneration. The significance of his\nwork and its impact upon British philosophy were recognized by friends\nand foes. The second volume of J.H. Muirhead\u2019s prestigious\nContemporary British Philosophy: Personal Statements \u2014\na book which appeared shortly after Bradley\u2019s death and\ncollected papers by all major philosophers of the time, including\nthinkers as hostile to the idealistic outlook as G.E. Moore \u2014\nopens with the following dedication: \u2018To F.H. Bradley, Order of\nMerit: To whom British Philosophy owed the impulse that gave it new\nlife in our time\u2019.\n\nThis reputation began to collapse fairly quickly after his death. The\nreasons for this are complex, and include matters seemingly extraneous\nto philosophy itself, such as the reaction against British imperialism\n(whose moral and spiritual mission had been justified by some idealist\nphilosophers and undertaken by their pupils) following the Great War.\nOne more locally significant factor was the tendentious but still\ndamaging accounts of his views which appeared in the writings of Moore\nand Russell following their defection from the idealist camp.\nRussell\u2019s widely read and justly celebrated \u2018On\nDenoting\u2019 provides a wonderful example of philosophical\npropaganda. Considering the question whether either \u2018The King of\nFrance is bald\u2019 or \u2018The King of France is not bald\u2019\nis true or false in the absence of a present King of France, Russell\nwittily observes that \u2018Hegelians\u2019 will conclude that he\nwears a wig. Russell had a special literary talent for producing\nremarks of this sort, which could not fail to leave their mark, as\nthere is no worse enemy than a charming irony. At the same time,\nRussell does not name any specific authors, nor does he address any\nspecific idealist theory. The whole of British Idealism is thus simply\ndismissed because of its alleged association with Hegel, here ably\nintroduced as the acme of absurdity.\n\nAnother factor was logical positivism, whose representatives\nrepudiated metaphysics in general as meaningless: in the first chapter\nof A.J. Ayer\u2019s anti-metaphysical tract Language, Truth and\nLogic, Bradley is presented solely as a metaphysician and, on the\nbasis of a single out-of-context sentence, selected for ridicule (p.\n36). The chosen sentence (\u201cthe Absolute enters into, but is\nitself incapable of, evolution and progress\u201d, which Ayer in fact\nslightly paraphrased from p. 442 of Appearance and Reality)\nwas Bradley\u2019s expression of the familiar doctrine that ultimate\nreality, though changeless in itself, constitutes the ontological\nfoundation of our finite world of change and becoming. Ayer offered\nthis claim as an example of what he called\n\u2018pseudo-propositions\u2019, that is, English sentences\nseemingly expressing a meaning but actually devoid of informative\ncontent; and his malicious remark that the quoted proposition was\ntaken \u2018at random\u2019 from Appearance and Reality was\nclearly designed to implant in the mind of the reader the idea that\nBradley\u2019s book largely consisted of such pseudo-propositions.\nConsequent upon such influences was a change, inimical to idealism, in\nthe whole style of doing philosophy, a change characterized by the\ndevelopment of formal logic and the new respect paid to the\ndeliverances of common sense and of ordinary language. Bradley\u2019s\nhighly wrought prose and his confidence in the metaphysician\u2019s\nright to adjudicate on the ultimate truth began to seem alien to a\nlater generation of philosophers reared on a mixture of plain talk and\nformalization and encouraged to defer to mathematics and empirical\nscience. But stylistic choices are not philosophically neutral; no one\nengaged in producing a system of revisionary metaphysics is likely to\naccept limitations imposed by ordinary language.\n\nSuch influences ensured that a misleading and dismissive stereotype of\nBradley became current among analytic philosophers and established in\ntheir textbooks, so that serious discussion of his work largely\ndisappeared. One result has been that, despite his seminal influence\non Russell and their extended controversy over fundamental matters,\nbooks and articles on Russell can contain few or even no references to\nBradley. Another is that the incidental textbook references to some of\nBradley\u2019s most characteristic, original and significant views,\ne.g. on relations and on truth, are often based on hostile\ncaricatures. With a few exceptions (for instance, McTaggart\u2019s\nargument for the unreality of time), discussion of the work of the\nidealists has been sparse since the nineteen thirties. Discussion of\nBradley began to revive, as did his reputation, in the nineteen\nseventies, continuing through the following decades up to the present\nday. This reorientation does not usually go with an attempt at\nvindicating Bradley\u2019s overall philosophical outlook. It stands\nrather in close connection with a revival of interest in the origins\nof analytic philosophy partly prompted by Rorty\u2019s critique in\nPhilosophy and the Mirror of Nature. Rorty\u2019s attack\nencouraged analytic philosophy to self-examination and led some\nthinkers within that tradition to re-examine the foundational myths at\nthe basis of their own ways of practising and conceiving of\nphilosophy.\n\nThese efforts produced significant results; several monographs and\ncollections became available that correct the inherited\nmisconceptions, discussing Bradley\u2019s philosophy in a more\nbalanced manner. There has also been a revival of interest in his\ncritical examination of the concept of relation within the field of\nanalytic ontology, yet with apparently little interest and\nappreciation of those broader speculative issues that so much mattered\nto him. At the time of writing it is clear that he is still widely\nunderrated; it is, however, far from clear that his reputation will\never again stand as high as it did in his own lifetime.\n",
