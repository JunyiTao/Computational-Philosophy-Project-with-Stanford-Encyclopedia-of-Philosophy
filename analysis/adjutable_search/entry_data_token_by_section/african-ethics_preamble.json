    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe ethics of a society is embedded in the ideas and beliefs about\nwhat is right or wrong, what is a good or bad character; it is also\nembedded in the conceptions of satisfactory social relations and\nattitudes held by the members of the society; it is embedded,\nfurthermore, in the forms or patterns of behavior that are considered\nby the members of the society to bring about social harmony and\ncooperative living, justice, and fairness. The ideas and beliefs about\nmoral conduct are articulated, analyzed, and interpreted by the moral\nthinkers of the society.\n\n\nAfrican societies, as organized and functioning human communities,\nhave undoubtedly evolved ethical systems\u2014ethical values, principles,\nrules\u2014intended to guide social and moral behavior. But, like African\nphilosophy itself, the ideas and beliefs of the African society that\nbear on ethical conduct have not been given elaborate investigation\nand clarification and, thus, stand in real need of profound and\nextensive analysis and interpretation. In the last three decades or\nso, attempts have been made by contemporary African philosophers to\ngive sustained reflective attention to African moral ideas. This entry\nis intended to make some contribution to the understanding of African\nethical thinking.\n\n\nThe entry makes the African moral language its point of departure, for\nthe language of morality gives insight into the moral thinking or\nideas of the society. The centrality of the notions of character and\nmoral personhood, which are inspired by the African moral language, is\ngiven a prominent place. The entry points up the social character of\nAfrican ethics and highlights its affiliated notions of the ethics of\nduty (not of rights) and of the common good. The humanistic\nfoundations and features of African ethics are extensively\ndiscussed.\n",
