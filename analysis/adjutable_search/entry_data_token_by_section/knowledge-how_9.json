    "main_text": "The Linguistic Argument || First Group of Objections\n4.2 First Group of Objections\n\nSeveral philosophers have objected that intellectualists are giving\nundue weight to linguistic considerations and that other\nconsiderations, coming from the cognitive sciences, should be taken\ninto account too, when thinking about the nature of knowledge-how\n(No\u00eb 2005, 2011; Devitt 2011; Brown 2013; Johnson 2006; Glick\n2011; Roth & Cummins 2011). It does not follow from this worry\nthat the linguistic argument ought to be dismissed as lacking\nany evidential value. Consider an analogy. Arguably, the best\ntheory of beliefs and desires is one on which these are propositional\nattitudes. This theory is compatible with how we ascribe beliefs and\ndesires (i.e., ascriptions of beliefs are of the form \u201cS\nbelieves that p\u201d, where \u201cp\u201d is\nstandardly taken to stand for proposition). But it is also compatible\nwith folk psychology, according to which thinking of beliefs and\ndesires as propositional attitudes helps explain behavior. By parity\nof reasoning, ideally, the best theory of knowledge-how should\npresumably be compatible both with our best psychological\ntheory and our best linguistic theory of knowledge-how ascriptions\n(cf. Stanley 2011a, 2011b, 2011c; Cath 2015a for a defense of the\nlinguistic methodology). \n",
