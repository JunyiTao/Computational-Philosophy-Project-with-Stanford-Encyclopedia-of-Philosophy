    "main_text": "Other Methods of Bioethics || Casuistry\n5.1 Casuistry\n\nThere are other approaches to bioethics that embody alternatives to\nhigh theory. The first, casuistry, can in some sense be understood as\na critical response to early versions of Beauchamp and\nChildress\u2019 four principles approach. Recall a certain response\nto at least early versions of Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 approach,\nnamely that that approach was too abstract and that its alleged\ndeductivism was objectionable. Advocates of casuistry, or case-based\nreasoning, objected to what they at least took to be the\nunidirectional \u201cdownward\u201d movement from principles to\ncases (Arras 2017: 11). Instead, they argued for a more \u201cbottom\nup\u201d approach, which would see actual cases, rather than any one\nmoral theory, as the starting point, and would conceive of moral\nprinciples as in fact emerging from our consideration of cases.\n\nWe often speak of casuistry full-stop, and when we do we generally\nhave in mind an approach to ethics that emphasizes analogical\nreasoning with concrete actual cases (the one before us, and\nrelevantly similar past cases). When one encounters a case, one\nharkens back to a relevantly similar case from the past, recalls how\none responded in that case, and \u201capplies\u201d that reasoning\nto the case before one. We should, however, recognize the distinction\nbetween two versions of the approach. To start, there is casuistry\nunderstood simply as the practice of addressing particular cases,\ntreating them through the application of (abstract) principles.\nUnderstood as such, casuistry would seem to be rightly viewed as a\nlogical complement to approaches to bioethics that take moral\nprinciples to be morally binding (Arras 2017: 46). Casuists here hold\nthat principles can have an action-guiding or normative force that is\nnot reducible to our responses to cases, and that the moral knowledge\nrepresented by such principles is not reducible to responses to cases\n(Jonsen 1995). Note that when defined in this way, differences between\nthis moderate version of casuistry and a more traditional top-down\napplication of moral principles to cases might be difficult to\npinpoint.\n\nA more radical interpretation of casuistry, though, has a different\nstory to tell about the derivation of moral principles. Where on the\nmoderate version we approach cases with our moral principles already\nestablished, on this more radical version, principles develop through\nour analysis of actual cases (Arras 2017: 47). So the two different\nversions adopt different pictures of the source of our moral\nknowledge. On the radical version, it is at the level of the concrete\ncase, rather than at the level of theory, where we find the greatest\nconfidence in our moral judgments. The claim here is that moral\nprinciples are, at base, merely formalizations of our intuitive\nresponses to cases, without independent normative force (Toulmin\n1981).\n5.1.1 Advantages of casuistry\n\nAccording to its proponents, casuistry as an approach to bioethics has\nspecific advantages. One is its potential to offer chances of reaching\nagreement amongst those of different theoretical commitments,\nrendering it particularly well-suited for decision making in a\npluralistic society (Sunstein 1996). Turning to the more applied\nmedical context, casuistry is well-suited to use by health care\nworkers, whose orientation is already case-focused, and whose time for\nand interest in moral theory is likely quite limited. When it comes to\nteaching bioethics, casuistry would call for the use of richly\ndetailed case studies, which many whose teaching responsibilities\ninclude teaching those in health care would count as a strength (Arras\n2017: 55\u201357).\n5.1.2 Criticisms of casuistry\n\nDespite these sorts of advantages, casuistry has been met with\ncriticism. One is that the approach seems to assume a\nstraightforwardness when it comes to deciding what counts as a case.\nHowever, as some would have it, deciding what counts as a case (or\nnot) might well be underwritten by the bioethicist\u2019s picture of\nthe sorts of problems worthy (or unworthy) of appearance on the moral\nagenda (O\u2019Neill 1988). It has been argued that that agenda is\noverly narrow and sculpted by the interests of, for example, the\nmedical profession, and a male outlook (Carse 1991). A related but\ndistinct point concerns what counts as an adequate description of the\nissues at play in a case. Casuistry, to its detriment, seems silent on\nthis matter. Some argue that a strike against the radical version of\ncasuistry is its recourse to analogical reasoning. Such recourse, so\nthe thought goes, fails to properly recognize that such reasoning is\nnot self-standing. Analogical reasoning would seem to need\npre-established principles to give it direction, and radical casuistry\nrejects such principles. Moderate casuistry, which does use principles\nor generalizations to provide some structure in identifying what is\nmorally relevant to a case and across cases (Jonsen 1995) would not be\nsubject to this criticism.\n\nAnother concern is that given its disregard for theoretically-derived\nprinciples, radical casuistry may amount to no more than a refinement\nof our intuitive responses to cases. It might be thought to be morally\nconservative, ill-equipped for social critique, with the casuist as\nmere expositor of pre-ordained moral norms (Arras 2017: 60\u201367).\nFinally, the approach seems to require pre-established agreement on\nfundamental values in order to reach conclusions, agreement that may\nwell be lacking in pluralistic modern society.\n5.2 Narrative Ethics\n\nA further alternative approach to ethics in general and bioethics in\nparticular is narrative ethics. According to many commentators, it\nemerged in response to a so-called \u201ctheory-driven\u201d\napproach to bioethics, an approach that prioritizes the Enlightenment\nideas of objectivity and universality (Arras 1997: 65). Put\ndifferently, narrative ethics emerged as a response to an impartialist\nethics, one working on the assumption that ethics is mainly a matter\nof \u201cright conduct among strangers\u201d. According to Hilde\nLindemann Nelson, two proposals on which narrative approaches to\nethics are based are that moral principles are not lawlike but are\nmodifiable in light of context (presumably by being made more\nspecific, or by being treated as defeasible), and that the particulars\nof a situation \u201ceither naturally take a narrative form, or must\nbe given a narrative structure if they are to have moral\nmeaning\u201d (Lindemann Nelson 1997a: viii\u2013ix).\n\nThough some will say narrative ethics is somewhat difficult to pin\ndown as a method, we can think of it as an approach to ethics that\nemphasizes storytelling, the importance of the voice and perspective\nof the storyteller and/or patient, and a literary sensibility on the\nbioethicist\u2019s part. Possibilities have been proposed as to what\na narrative approach to ethics might look like, suggestions as to the\nsorts of activities in which we might engage when we adopt a narrative\napproach to bioethics. These include i) simply reading stories (which\nsharpens one\u2019s moral sensibilities) (Nussbaum, 1992, 1995), ii)\ntelling stories (which is a way of making moral sense of an\nexperience), iii) comparing stories (which brings to mind the work of\nthe casuists), iv) conducting literary analysis in some form or other,\nand v) invoking stories (which we do when we introduce bioethics case\nstudies) (Lindemann Nelson 1997a: x\u2013xii).\n\nAccounts vary of how narrative ethics actually functions as a tool of\nethical analysis. A first option is that a narrative approach acts as\na supplement to moral principles rather than as a replacement of them.\nOn this version of narrative ethics, we are looking at a way of doing\nbioethics that requires sensitive attention to so-called\n\u201cnarrative elements\u201d of human experience, such as stories\ntold by patients, caregivers, and family members. There is no thought\nof doing away with a bioethics driven by theories and principles, just\na call to use those tools with a sensitive appreciation of the\nfirst-person accounts of others (Charon 1994). Another way of thinking\nabout narrative as a supplement to principles is to consider the way\nin which principles and cases share a dialectical relationship within\nthe context of reflective equilibrium. Here, the cases in response to\nwhich we develop considered judgments are themselves narratives. So\nagain, this conception is accommodating of moral theory, as moral\ntheorizing and stories are mutually interdependent.\n\nA second option has a narrative approach emphasizing the importance to\nethics of history and culture over a more universalist rationality.\nThis version of narrative ethics is sometimes known as historical\nnarrative. Here, right action is endorsed by appeal to the traditions,\nnorms, and traditional stories of a particular social group. Recourse\nis also made to one\u2019s social role, and the foundational\nnarrative underlying that role (think of the physician\u2019s social\nrole in Western culture as shaped by the Hippocratic Oath) (MacIntyre\n1981; Burrell & Hauerwas, 1977).\n\nA third option sees a narrative approach acting as a total substitute\nfor the process of moral justification (Arras 1997: 67\u2013 78), and\nas a replacement of theory-driven or principle-centered bioethics. On\nthis option, which some associate with postmodernism, the emphasis is\nupon continual conversation between traditions and narratives. No one\nview (tradition or narrative) can be justified over others through\nreference to a theory of human nature, of history, and so on. The\nultimate goal here then is not the pursuit of justification for\none\u2019s view, but the keeping open of the \u201cmoral\nspace\u201d for continuing conversation between rival views (Rorty\n1989). A related aspect of this option is the claim that those who\nsuffer should tell their own story, without risk of being dominated\nand objectified by the case summaries typical of modern medicine\n(Frank 1995). While quite specific in their vision of how narrative\nethics might supplement or replace a more standardly theory-driven or\nprinciples-centered approach to bioethics, none of these versions seem\nto identify a unique framework for moral reasoning (in the way that,\nfor example, utilitarianism or deontology do).\n5.2.1 Criticisms of Narrative Ethics\n\nQuestions have been raised about the viability of a narrative\napproach. A general concern is that how an emphasis on narrative\nrelates to ethics in general. There is also question about how a\nnarrative approach reaches conclusions about what we are supposed to\ndo.\n\nInsofar as two central tasks of bioethics are to pass judgments on\nactions, policies, and character, and to morally justify actions,\ndecisions, and policies (or to show that justification is not\npossible), it is not clear how narrative ethics can satisfy the aims\nof bioethics, or so the concern goes. What is the relationship between\nnarrative and moral justification? What is the connection between\ntelling a story, say, and the moral decency of a particular action,\npolicy, or character?\n\nMore specific concerns about the approach track the version of\nnarrative ethics under consideration. For instance, on the historical\nnarrative picture (the second option above), some argue there is the\nrisk of falling back into either a version of ethics at least somewhat\nguided by principles, or finding oneself having to sort through\nincommensurable narratives with nothing to decide between them. A\nworry about the third option (the version on which narrative acts as a\nsubstitute for moral justification) is the threat of an objectionable\nsubjectivism, brought on by the possibility of mistaking the\nnarrator\u2019s story for ethical truth. A related criticism is that\nthis version of narrative ethics seems to prioritize individual\ncoherence over the passing of moral judgment. Some stories, so the\nthought goes, may well be internally coherent, while at the same time\nbeing morally questionable (Arras 1997: 81\u201383).\n6. Feminist Theory and Bioethics\n\nAnother distinctive approach to bioethics employs the insights of\nfeminist ethics. Feminist approaches to bioethics offer a framework\nfor approaching bioethics at least in the sense of developing and\nadhering to a certain set of theoretical commitments. Some of those\ncommitments address forms of moral reasoning, some address substantive\ncommitments about how to bring about a more just social order, and\nsome address questions about which perspective should take priority in\nthe analysis of a bioethical issue. Some contend that bioethics has\nlargely ignored work in feminist ethics more broadly, making it all\nthe more crucial that a feminist approach to bioethics act as a\ncorrective to various trends (such as an inattentiveness to social\ncontext, and an emphasis on liberal individualism) (Wolf\n1996a). Suggestions abound as to how a feminist approach can, and\nin fact does, do that.\n\nTo start, a feminist approach can pay special attention to the\nexperiences of women. Further, it can subject to critical scrutiny the\nemployment of the concept of a common morality, a concept which\nallegedly entrenches bioethics as a conversation amongst experts.\nBioethics as such a conversation excludes alternative viewpoints,\nincluding the viewpoints of laypeople, and of those on the margins. A\nfeminist approach might invoke standpoint theory, which would draw\nupon the insights of the most disadvantaged in society. Finally, a\nfeminist theoretical approach could demand attention to lived\nexperience, turning the emphasis away from the abstract theorizing of\nnon-feminist moral philosophy and bioethics (Wolf 1996a).\n\nTwo further benefits of a feminist approach to bioethics have been set\nout, apart from how it might directly correct for the effects of a\nmasculinist moral philosophy and bioethics. First, a feminist approach\nboth attunes us to the effects of androcentric reasoning in the\nanalysis of bioethical issues, and mitigates those effects. Second, it\ndraws our attention to the gendered nature of many concepts key to\nbioethical analysis. For instance, in looking at the concepts of\nreason and emotion, a feminist approach helps us to see that the\nconcepts themselves seem partly to be gendered concepts. Reason is, or\nat least traditionally has been, associated with the male, and emotion\nwith the female. The same holds true with the distinction between the\npublic and private spheres, with the public domain belonging to men,\nthe private the women\u2019s realm. But what\u2019s more, we see\nthat that which is associated with woman (emotion, for example) tends\nto be undervalued. As Margaret Little lays it out, traditional moral\nepistemology takes reason, and not emotion, to be critical to moral\nunderstanding. It is also important to notice the dualistic nature of\nthe picture presented above. Just as men and women have traditionally\noccupied different spheres, so too have gendered concepts occupied\nfixed places on either side of a divide. The domestic sphere, for\ninstance, is taken to have nothing instructive to offer the world of\neconomic or political relations, or bioethics (Little 1996).\n\nWe can see these sorts of commitments played out in Susan\nSherwin\u2019s approach to the abortion question. According to her, a\nrecognition of gender and sexual politics, and of women\u2019s\nvulnerability in general and to sexual coercion in particular, are on\nher view crucial aspects of a feminist approach. Further, a feminist\napproach takes as central the moral prerogative of the women\nconcerned, rather than focusing on such questions as fetal moral\nstatus, or on the task of formulating a set of general rules as to\nwhen abortion is or is not morally justified. In keeping with this, a\nfeminist approach denies the possibility of a gender-neutral account\nof pregnancy, or of abortion decisions. From a feminist perspective,\nthe most morally salient feature of pregnancy\n\n\nis that it takes place in women\u2019s bodies and has\nprofound effects on women\u2019s lives (Sherwin 1992:\n363).\n\n\nWhen we look at feminist treatments of physician-assisted dying (PAS),\nwe again see certain kinds of theoretical commitments come to the\nfore. For instance, an adherence to the feminist care perspective\nleads Leslie Bender to support PAS (Bender 1992). By contrast, Susan\nM. Wolf\u2019s application of a feminist approach as manifest by an\nemphasis upon the significance of gender leads her to conclude that\nPAS should not be legitimized. Pointing to the insidiousness of\ncertain familiar images\u2014images of feminine self-sacrifice, for\ninstance\u2014as well as to early prominent cases of\nphysician-assisted dying and euthanasia in which the physician was\nmale, the patient female, Wolf warns us of the dangers of the dynamic\nbetween the \u201cpowerful expert physician and the woman\nsurrendering to his care\u201d (Wolf 1996b: 293).\n\nIn thinking about feminist approaches to bioethics in connection to\nthe relation between theory and bioethics, it is not a uniform\napproach, seeing as its proponents will not always adhere to the same\nset of commitments. (For example, in her work referenced above Bender\nadheres to a care-oriented thinking, where other feminist bioethicists\nwill be more representative of liberal feminism.) A feminist approach\nis theoretical at least in its adherence to certain (feminist\nintellectual) commitments, even if there is not agreement across the\nboard as to what those should be. Overall, feminist approaches to\nbioethics have made a significant impact and have changed the course\nof the conversation in bioethics, even if those approaches are\nsomewhat varied and represent a theoretical approach to bioethics in\nless strictly defined a way than other approaches might. The preceding\ndiscussion focuses upon scholarly contributions; feminist scholars\nhave also addressed clinical ethics (Sherwin & Baylis 2003). It is\nto the clinical realm, and moral theory\u2019s role there, that we\nnow turn.\n7. Moral Theory and Clinical Bioethics\n\nThere are two main areas of discussion within clinical ethics that\nrelate to the relevance of moral theory to clinical bioethics. The\nfirst concerns what is the appropriate model for clinical ethics\nconsultation. This has implicit consequences for the role of moral\ntheory. The second directly examines whether clinical ethics\nconsultations should rely upon moral theory.\n7.1 Models of Clinical Ethics Consultation\n\nThe American Society for Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) sets out\nthree possible models of clinical ethics consultation, endorsing one\nof them. Each model implicitly involves a picture of the role, or lack\nthereof, of moral theory. On the pure consensus model, the sole goal\nof ethics consultation is to forge agreement among those involved in\nthe consult (ASBH 2011: 7). It would seem that there is no role for\nmoral theory on this approach to clinical consultation, as mediation\nis the sole objective, with no eye held toward whether the consensus\nreached is morally justified through appeal to moral norms, accepted\nvalues, or moral theory. This model is generally taken to involve too\nweak a picture of the aims of clinical ethics consultation, and too\nminimal a picture of the clinical ethicist\u2019s expertise and role.\nOn the second model, the authoritarian model, the clinical ethicist\nis, by contrast, the primary moral decision maker. This model is\ngenerally taken to involve an overblown picture of the clinical\nethicist\u2019s authority and abilities, and of the infallibility of\nher perspective. The major downfall of this model, according to the\nASBH, is that the clinical ethicist disregards the decision-making\nauthority of others, such as a patient\u2019s family and the health\ncare team. Here again, moral theory has no explicit role, though it\ndoes seem possible and even likely that the clinical ethicist, in\nmaking her unilateral decision, invokes some moral theory or other in\ndoing so.\n\nThe third model, the ethics facilitation approach, is the approach\nendorsed by the ASBH, and there is general consensus in the field that\nthis is the best model for clinical ethics consultation. Here, the\nconsultant helps to make clear the moral issues at play, aids in\ncommunication, integrates the viewpoints of relevant stakeholders\n(ASBH 2011: 7). Importantly for the current discussion, this approach\ninvolves two main parts: identifying and analyzing of what is the\nmoral issue at stake, and facilitating of a principled ethical\nresolution. This second task is of particular interest to us here,\nbecause one would think that the building of such a resolution would\ninvolve looking to moral theory of some type or other, in addition to\nsimply consulting the ethics literature. How else will one adjudicate\nwhether the resolution falls within clearly accepted ethical\nprinciples? After all, the clinical ethicist is tasked not only with\nfacilitating a resolution, but with suggesting a range of ethically\nacceptable options and providing a rationale for each option. In\nspecifying an acceptable range of possible options, an ethics\nconsultant will draw on a knowledge of relevant institutional\npolicies, laws, the scholarly literature, and presumably also of moral\ntheory.\n7.2 Clinical Ethics and Moral Theory\n\nTurning to the second area of discussion, we have a more explicit look\nat the role of moral theory in clinical ethics consultation. Four\nimportant roles for moral theory in clinical ethics consultation have\nbeen suggested:\n\naiding in the initial awareness and identification of the moral\nchallenges;\nassisting in the analysis of moral challenges;\ncontributing to a sound process and dialogue;\ninspiring an attitude of reflexivity and interpretation\n(Magelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016, 27\u201331).\n\n\nThe advantages of a clinical ethicist\u2019s being familiar with\nmoral theory have also been discussed. There is some advantage not\njust in using a moral theory to help one analyze and formulate\narguments, but also in considering the variety of perspectives and\nquestions made perspicuous by various ethical theories, and the issues\nthey illuminate. As well, when it comes to the consistency of a\nclinical ethicist\u2019s own argumentation, familiarity with moral\ntheory will help clinical ethicists spot weaknesses in their own\narguments or in those of others.\n\nHowever, matters are not quite so simple. To start, it is possible for\nthose with no training in moral philosophy to have a solid handle on\nthe moral dilemma with which they are dealing. And at the same time,\nsome say, having a philosopher, one who is an expert in moral theory,\nas a clinical ethicist does not guarantee that the ethics consult will\nbe of high quality. Knowledge of moral theory within the clinical\nethics realm is not always clearly helpful, and its possible benefits\nare not without accompanying drawbacks. First, if used too strictly,\nand adhered to too inflexibly, moral theories can hamper moral\nimagination and intuition, and obscure access to the insights of, for\nexample, common morality. Second, those in command of a wide range of\nmoral theories might be tempted to draw upon the moral theory that\nactually justifies a course of action already preferred or even\nsettled upon, rather than use what is deemed in advance to be the best\nmoral theory to work through what is the justifiable course of action\n(or what are the best action options). Third, moral theories can\nmislead, by, for instance, being used to frame cases in ways that\nemphasize irrelevancies. And fourth, without quite advanced knowledge\nand skill, ethical theories may easily be misunderstood and used\nimproperly. An example here would be taking Kantian moral theory to\nmandate no person ever being treated as a means\n(Magelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016). The message here\nis that knowledge of moral theory can sometimes actually be an\nimpediment to good clinical ethics.\n\nOverall, moral theory has a role to play in clinical ethics, at least\nif we accept the goals of ethics consultation as assumed by the\ngenerally accepted model of ethics consultation. The more explicit\nconversation in this area recognizes the advantages the use of moral\ntheory offers clinical ethics and the consultation process. However,\nthe discussion in the literature also cautions against a wholesale\nendorsement of the notion that those working in clinical ethics are\nalways better for having an in-depth knowledge of moral theory.\n8. Conclusion\n\nWhat is the relation between moral theory and bioethics? There is no\nstraightforward answer to this question. So much depends upon whether\nwe consider bioethics in its academic, clinical, or policy-oriented\ninstantiations. And further, there is wide variance in what we have in\nmind when we talk about moral theory. Besides this, the very\ndistinction between moral theory, on the hand, and the problems and\nissues to be addressed in the practical realm, on the other, has been\ncalled into serious question. Still and all, it is difficult to\nimagine bioethics (in any form) in the total absence of moral theory.\nEspecially if modestly conceived as a set of substantive organizing\nassumptions about morality, and a commitment to a certain approach to\nmoral reasoning, it is difficult to view moral theory as anything\nother than indispensable to bioethics.",
