One can\ndraw inferences either in a \u201ccautious\u201d or\n\u201cbold\u201d fashion (also known as \u201cskeptical\u201d or,\nrespectively, \u201ccredulous\u201d). These two options correspond\nto significantly different ways to construe a given body of defeasible\nknowledge, and yield different results as to what defeasible\nconclusions are warranted on the basis of such a knowledge base. \n\nThe difference between these basic attitudes comes to this. In the\npresence of potentially conflicting defeasible inferences (and in the\nabsence of further considerations such as specificity \u2014 see\nabove), the credulous reasoner always commits to as many defeasible\nconclusions as possible, subject to a consistency requirement, whereas\nthe skeptical reasoner withholds assent from potentially conflicted\ndefeasible conclusions. \n\nA well-known example from the literature, the so-called \u201cNixon\ndiamond,\u201d will help to make the distinction clear. Suppose our\nknowledge base contains (defeasible) information to the effect that a\ngiven individual, Nixon, is both a Quaker and a Republican. Quakers,\nby and large, are pacifists, whereas Republicans, by and large, are\nnot. This is illustrated in the following figure: \n\n\n\n\nThe question is what defeasible conclusions are warranted on the basis\nof this body of knowledge, and in particular whether we should infer\nthat Nixon is a pacifist or that he is not a pacifist. \n\nNeither the skeptical nor the credulous reasoner have any logical\ngrounds to prefer either conclusion (\u201cNixon is a\npacifist\u201d; \u201cNixon is not a pacifist\u201d). While the\ncredulous reasoner commits to both conclusions, the skeptical reasoner\nrefrains from either. \n\nA rationale behind the credulous reasoning type is to provide an\noverview of possible conclusions given the conflicting defeasible\ninferences in order to subsequently make a choice among them. This is\nespecially interesting in practical reasoning contexts in which the\nchoice determines a course of action and in which extra-logical\nconsiderations (based on preferences, values, etc.) further narrow\ndown the choice. \n\nIn contrast, the rationale behind the skeptical reasoning type is to\ndetermine uncontested defeasible conclusions. The purpose may be of a\nmore epistemological nature such as the updating of the agent\u2019s belief\nor knowledge base with the chosen conclusions. \n",
