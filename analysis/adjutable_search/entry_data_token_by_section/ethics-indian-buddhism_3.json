    "main_text": "Beyond Moral Discipline\n4. Beyond Moral Discipline\n\nBuddhist texts contain a large number of enigmatic statements, of\nvarious different types, seemingly to the effect that once a\npractitioner reaches a sufficiently advanced stage of spiritual\ndevelopment, moral discipline is no longer necessary. These statements\nhave been interpreted in dramatically different ways by various Asian\ntraditions, and Western scholars disagree about how we should\nunderstand them.\n\nThe P\u0101li Canon contains the claim that Saints have\n\u201cabandoned goodness (pu\u00f1\u00f1a) and vile\nactions (p\u0101pa).\u201d Some writers have interpreted\nthis statement as meaning that ethical norms no longer apply to\nSaints. But Damien Keown has argued quite convincingly against this\ninterpretation (1992, ch. 4). \u201cGoodness\u201d and \u201cvile\nactions\u201d refer to actions which have karmic effects in the\nfuture, projecting a future existence that includes happiness or\nsuffering, respectively. Since the life in which one becomes a Saint\nis one\u2019s last life, it is impossible that any actions that occur\nafter Sainthood is attained could project future existence through\nkarma. The change which stops the accumulation of karma is most\nplausibly identified as the abandonment of clinging to the belief in a\nsubstantial self. Someone who no longer thinks of actions as stemming\nfrom and having effects on a real, persisting self is no longer\ntrapped in cyclic existence.\n\nTherav\u0101da texts contain intriguing suggestions that Saints no\nlonger have to worry about following rules of moral discipline; they\njust spontaneously act in appropriate ways. But there are also\nstatements in Therav\u0101da texts to the effect that a Saint would\nnever knowingly and intentionally break any of the rules of monastic\ndiscipline. These rules forbid many actions which the Buddhist\ntradition regards as reprehensible merely by convention, such as\neating after noon. If someone has not taken a vow that prohibits\neating after noon, then doing so is not wrong: the wrongness of the\naction stems merely from the fact that it infringes a valuable system\nof discipline that the agent has chosen to undertake. If Saints just\nact spontaneously and aren\u2019t psychologically bound by rules,\nit\u2019s not clear why they would, in all circumstances, avoid\nactions which are wrong merely because they are forbidden by rules of\nmonastic discipline. There seems to be a serious tension here.\n\nWriters expounding Mah\u0101y\u0101na ethics face somewhat similar\nissues, but handle them rather differently. According to\nMah\u0101y\u0101na philosophers such as Asa\u1e45ga and\n\u015a\u0101ntideva, an advanced practitioner who is motivated by\ncompassion may sometimes see that an action which is forbidden by the\nusual rules of Buddhist moral discipline would actually be more\neffective at preventing suffering and promoting happiness than any\naction the rules would permit. Under such circumstances, that\npractitioner can permissibly break the rules out of compassion.\n\nFor example, Asa\u1e45ga tells us that it would be permissible to\ntell a lie to save another sentient being from being killed or\nseriously harmed. If someone takes up with bad friends, it would be\npermissible to criticize those friends to him, a case of divisive\nspeech, in order to protect him from being corrupted by them. It would\nbe permissible to overthrow a wicked king or remove a corrupt temple\nadministrator from office. If a thief steals items belonging to the\nmonastic community, it would be permissible to steal them back in\norder to protect him from the severe bad karma of consuming those\nitems. In fact, if a bandit is planning to murder a large number of\nspiritually advanced beings, it would be permissible to kill the\nbandit preemptively, thus saving him from the terrible torment of\naeons in the hells. In all such cases, according to Asa\u1e45ga,\nthese acts, if done with the right kind of motivation, would result in\nmuch merit for the one who carries them out. (Tatz trans. 1986,\n70\u201373)\n\nOne thing that many of these cases seem to have in common is that the\nrule-violating action proceeds from a compassion that includes in its\nscope not only the potential victims of the harms that are to be\nprevented, but also the perpetrator of those harms. When people hear\nof the Buddhist commitment to nonviolence, one question they often ask\nis whether someone with foreknowledge of the events of the 1940s would\nbe permitted by Buddhist principles to assassinate Hitler in 1930. If\nwe follow Asa\u1e45ga, the answer would seem to be: yes, you may kill\nHitler, if you have compassion for him and you do it partly for his\nsake. Thus, in extreme cases, violence may be permissible; but hatred\nis never justified.\n\nOne way to understand Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s view here would be to\nimagine that one of your loved ones, such as your brother or son, is\nslipped a drug which makes him temporarily insane, and he then attacks\nyou with a knife. To remain passive and let him kill you would not be\nthe best thing you could do for him. If you are able to knock him\ndown, take the knife away and restrain him, you thereby protect him\nfrom a lifetime of regret and distress resulting from having killed\nyou. This use of coercive force would therefore naturally flow from\nyour love for him.\n\nIn addition to particular examples of permissible violations of the\nrules of moral discipline, both Asa\u1e45ga and \u015a\u0101ntideva\ngive us general statements about when the rules should be broken.\nThese statements are strikingly consequentialist in flavor. Thus\nAsa\u1e45ga tells us this: \u201cIf the bodhisattva sees that some\ncaustic means, some use of severity would be of benefit to sentient\nbeings, and does not employ it in order to guard against unhappiness,\nhe is possessed of fault, possessed of contradiction; there is fault\nthat is not defiled\u201d (Tatz trans., 1986, 76).\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s view is similar; he writes:\n\u201cRealizing this, one should always be striving for others\u2019\nwell-being. Even what is proscribed is permitted for a compassionate\nperson who sees it will be of benefit.\u201d (Crosby and Skilton\ntrans., 1995, 41). According to these statements, an agent who is\ntruly motivated by compassion can break the usually applicable rules\nof moral discipline whenever doing so would benefit those involved in\nthe situation.\n\nSeveral Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, then, allow for certain cases in\nwhich advanced practitioners may violate the rules of moral\ndiscipline. Texts from the Vajray\u0101na, or Tantric, traditions of\nBuddhism go further than this. Revered Tantric masters such as\nN\u0101ropa, Kukkur\u012bpa, and Padmasambhava are shown engaging in\nshocking actions that flagrantly violate the conventions of society\nand the rules of Buddhist moral discipline. But these stories do not\nnecessarily mean that the Vajray\u0101na rejects all forms of ethics.\nNumerous texts make it clear that even as they break the rules,\nTantric adepts are motivated by compassion for all sentient beings.\nThey see that given the situation, unconventional and even grotesque\nactions are the most effective means to bring about the welfare of\nothers. Since they are totally free of all bonds of ideology or social\nconditioning, they spontaneously do what will be best on the whole,\nwithout worrying about what others might think or what the rulebook\nmight say. They have transcended moral discipline completely, while\nremaining, in a deeper sense, ethical exemplars.\n",
