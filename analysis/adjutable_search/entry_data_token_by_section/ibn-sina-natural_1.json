    "main_text": "Medieval Physics || Physical Causes and the Principles of Nature\n1.1 Physical Causes and the Principles of Nature\n\nThe hallmark of natural philosophy and indeed of any science (sing.\nGk. epist\u0113m\u0113, Ar. \u02bfilm) for Avicenna\nand the entire Aristotelian tradition is to uncover and to grasp the\nbasic causes (sing. \u02bfilla) of the phenomenon under\nconsideration. Like Aristotle before him, Avicenna identifies four\nsorts of causes: the matter, form, agent (or efficient cause) and end\n(or final cause) (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.10 and Avicenna, [MPh], bk. 6).\nFor Avicenna the material cause is a wholly inert substratum for form.\nThe matter explains any passivity or potentiality to be acted upon\nthat a body might have. The form (\u1e63\u016bra) is the\ncause, primarily, of a body\u2019s being the actual kind or species\nthat it is and performing the various actions associated with that\nspecies; secondarily, a form might be the cause of the accidental\nfeatures and determinations that belong to that body (Avicenna\noccasionally uses hay\u02bea for this second sense of form).\nIn general then, the form is the cause of any actuality, that is\npositive features or actions, that the body has or does. The efficient\ncause accounts for a body\u2019s undergoing motion and change (or\neven for its existence), while the final cause is that for the sake of\nwhich the form occurs in the matter.\n\nUnlike Aristotle, Avicenna also recognizes a broader division of\ncauses into physical causes and metaphysical causes (Avicenna, [Ph],\n1.10 [3]). The distinction is best approached by considering the\nAristotelian division between substances and accidents as found in the\nten categories. (Within the Aristotelian tradition, including\nAvicenna, the ten categories purport to provide the broadest\nclassification of ways things are found (mawj\u016bd) in the\nworld; Avicenna, [Cat], 1.1 and [MPh], 3.1.) The primary category is\nthat of substance, which for Avicenna is the existence that belongs to\na thing through itself, for example, the existence that belong to a\nhuman as human or a dog as dog (Avicenna, [MPh], 2.1 [1\u20132]).\nAccidents are what exist in another, namely, in a substance, and\ninclude a substance\u2019s quantity, quality, relation, where, when,\nposition, possession, activity and passivity. Metaphysical causes\ninvolve what accounts for the existence and continual conservation of\na substance, or, more exactly, of a concrete particular. Physical\ncauses in contrast involve those factors that bring about changes in\nthe accidental features of bodies, primarily changes of quality,\nquantity, location and position. For example, a father is responsible\nfor seeing that his semen becomes located within the mother, and the\nmother ensures that the right womb temperature for the fetus is\nmaintained and that the fetus is fed. Location, temperature,\npossession of nutriment and the like belong to categories of\naccidents, not to that of substance. Consequently, for Avicenna the\nfather and mother are most properly physical agents, that is, the\ncause of accidental changes that prepare the matter for the form. As\nsuch the parents are not the cause of the existence of the\noffspring\u2019s species form by which it is the specific substance\nit is. Instead, the metaphysical agent\u2014the one who imparts the\nspecies form to the matter such that there comes to be a substance of\nthe same kind as the parents\u2014is a separate (immaterial) agent,\nwhich Avicenna calls the Giver of Forms (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.10 [3];\n[AP], 2.1; [MPh], 6.2 [5] & 9.5\n [3\u20134]).[1]\n\nRegardless of whether one is considering physical or metaphysical\ncauses, any motion or change (whether of some specific existence\nitself or just of some new accident), Avicenna explains, requires\nthree things: (1) the form that comes to be as a result of the change,\n(2) the matter in which that form comes to be and (3) the\nmatter\u2019s initial privation of that form (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.2\n[12\u201313]). These three\u2014the form, matter and\nprivation\u2014are frequently referred to, following Aristotle, as\n\u201cprinciples of nature\u201d (cf. Aristotle, Physics,\n1.7). While Avicenna happily agrees that these three factors are\npresent in every instance of something\u2019s coming to be after not\nhaving been, he is not as happy as to whether all three of these\nfeatures are equally \u201cprinciples\u201d (sing.\nmabda\u02be). His concern is that, strictly speaking, causes\nand principles exist simultaneous with their effects, whereas\nprivation is only ever prior to the change and passes away\nwith the change (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.3 [14]; McGinnis 2012, Lammer 2018,\n\u00a73.3). More properly speaking, Avicenna contends, privation is a\nprecondition for change rather than a principle. Still, he concedes\nthat if one is lax in one\u2019s use of \u201cprinciple\u201d so as\nto understand a principle as \u201cwhatever must exist, however it\nmight exist, in order that something else exists, but not\nconversely\u201d (ibid) privation would count as a principle\nof change. Avicenna reasons thusly: The elimination of the privation\nfrom something as changeable renders that thing no longer changeable,\nwhereas the elimination of that changeable thing itself does not\neliminate the privation. In other words, insofar as something is\nchangeable, it depends on or requires that there be some privation.\nConversely, privation does not depend on and does not require that\nthere be anything changeable. For example, for Avicenna, the celestial\nIntellects\u2014think Angelic host\u2014are not subject to change;\nnonetheless, they all possess some privation of existence and\nperfection, which is found in God. Thus privation has a certain\nontological priority to the changeable. There can be privation without\nthe changeable, but there cannot be the changeable without\nprivation.\n",
