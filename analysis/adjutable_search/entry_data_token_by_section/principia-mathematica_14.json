    "main_text": "Volume III || Part VI: Quantity\n6.2 Part VI: Quantity\n  The later portions of PM\nshould thus be studied for a hint of how the real numbers and the use\nof mathematics in measurement can be developed with this rival\nfoundation on the theory of relations. Gandon (2008, 2012) argues that\nthe application of mathematics is better explained using this logicist\naccount than by rivals.\n\nIn \u2217300\u2013\u2217314, positive\nand negative integers, ratios and real numbers all defined. The goal\nof the section is to begin the study of how these numbers are used in\nthe measurement of quantities in geometry and physics.\nRatios \n\n\\[ R n/m S \\eqdf \\forall x \\forall y ( x\\rels{R^n} y \\supset\nx\\rels{S^m}y) \\]\n\n\nfor n, m relatively prime.\n\nRelations R and S stand in the ratio of\nn to m when \\(x\\rels{R^n} y\\) then \\(x\\rels{S^m} y\\),\nwhere \\(R^n\\) is the n-th power of R and \\(S^m\\) is the\nm-th power of S (see \u221791). The ratio\nof two relations is represented by numbers n and m that\nare relatively prime, namely, if \n\n \\[\\forall j \\forall k \\forall l [(n = j \\times l \\amp m = k \\times l\n )\\supset l = 1].\\]\n\n\nRatios thus are relations between relations. Rational\nNumbers, in keeping with the generalized notions of all numbers\nin PM will be classes of similar ratios, and thus the work of\ndeveloping the theory of rational, and then real numbers, is carried\nout in terms of ratios and relations between ratios.\nReal Numbers\n\nThe real numbers \\(\\Theta\\) are defined as \u201cthe series of\nsegments of the series of ratios\u201d, or the set of Dedekind cuts\nof the sequence of rational numbers, in their standard ordering.\nTechnically \\(\\Theta\\) is a relation in extension. The individuals\nthat are related in the ratios, and thus at the basis of the series of\nrational numbers must be infinite in number for the PM version of the\nreal numbers to have the structure we expect. In the introductory\nmaterial to the section they point out that while the construction of\nthe reals thus requires the Axiom of Infinity, they add it explicitly\nto the theorems where needed and try as much as possible to derive the\nresults upon which it does not rely without making that\nassumption.\n\nThe theory of real numbers in PM is closer to that of Frege than the\n\u201carithmetizing\u201d accounts of Dedekind or Cantor. Dedekind\npostulated that irrational numbers are to be \u201ccreated\u201d to\nfill out the gaps in the series of rational numbers that are marked by\nDedekind cuts (Dedekind 1872 [1901: 15], while Cantor (1883: \u00a79, para. 8\n[1996: 899]) identified real numbers with the limits of sequences of rational\nnumbers.\n\nFrege, and PM, however, see real numbers as abstracted from the\nsimiliarity of relations with a certain structure. See Gandon (2012)\nfor a fine grained comparison of the Frege and Russell\nconstructions.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the overall structure and contents of\nsections in PM and Basic Laws are similar. They both share a\nfirst section on the symbolic logic that they will use, then a series\nof definitions and theorems about the notions of number and concepts\nused in arithmetic, with a concluding section on real numbers. While\nthe range of the mathematics that is to be reduced to logic in the two\nworks is the same, Frege restricts his work more directly to natural\nand real numbers, while PM includes the theory of classes and\narithmetic of relations and relations and infinite sets. While all of\nthese topics are handled in the initial chapters of a contemporary\ntextbook in axiomatic set theory, as Urquhart (2013) suggests, this\nmay be the inevitable fate of even the most groundbreaking\nmathematical works.\n\nThe addition and multiplication of real numbers is defined in the next\nsections as they are for other numbers, but taking disjoint instances\nof each number similarity class, and performing the corresponding\noperation on them. Many results assume the Axiom of Infinity as an\nhypothesis. The operations are symbolized as \\(+_s\\) and\n\\(\\times_s\\).\n\n\nMeasurement\u2014i.e. the application of ratios and real\nnumbers to magnitudes\u2014will be dealt with in Section C; for the\npresent, we shall confine ourselves to those properties of magnitude\nwhich are presupposed by measurement.\u2026\n\nWe conceive of a magnitude as a vector, i.e. as an operation,\ni.e. as a descriptive function in the sense of\n\u221730. Thus for example, we shall so define our\nterms that 1 gramme would not be a magnitude, but the difference\nbetween 2 grammes and 1 gramme would be a magnitude, i.e. the\nrelation \u201c+1 gramme\u201d would be a magnitude. On the other\nhand a centimetre and a second would both be magnitudes according to\nour definition, because distances in space and time are\nvectors.\u2026\n\nWe demand of a vector (1) that it shall be a one-one relation, (2)\nthat it be capable of indefinite repetition, i.e. that if the\nvector takes us from a to b, there shall always be a\npoint c such that the vector takes us from b to\nc. (PM, Vol. III, \u201cSummary of Section B\u201d, 1913: 339\nand 1927: 339)\n\n\nThe kinds of quantity addressed in this section and the next are\nall\n\n\nvector families that is, classes of one-one relations all\nhaving the same converse domain, and all having the domain contained\nin the converse domain. (PM Vol. III, 350)\n\n6.2.1 Measurement\n\nMeasurement in PM is based on the relations between objects that are\nthe basis for the operation of measurement, that one object is heavier\nthan another, or longer than another. Quantities are then equivalence\nclasses of objects which have the same relations to others. Operations\nare defined on quantities, so that:\n\n\n\u2026that is to say, two-thirds of a pound of cheese ought to be\n\\((2/3 \\times_s 1/2)\\) of a pound of cheese, and similarly in every\nother case. (PM, Volume III, 407)\n\n\nPM concludes with a seemingly dangling excursion into the special case\nof the measurement of \u201cCyclic Families\u201d. For \u201csuch\ncases as the angles at a point, or the elliptic straight line, we\nrequire a theory of measurement applicable to families which are not\nopen\u201d (PM, Volume III, 457). The angles at a point will be\nmeasured from 0 to 360 degrees, and then start over again at 0 to\nmeasure an object rotating around a point. The many ratios that\nrepresent the rotations are represented by a \u201cprincipal\nratio\u201d, which is used to assign the measurement of degrees.\n6.2.2 There is no \u201cConclusion\u201d at the end of PM\n\nPM ends abruptly with the proof of a theorem\n(\u2217375\u00b732) concerning cyclic families,\nwithout any concluding remarks or hint of what is to come later. The\nthought is that further mathematics, including the Volume IV that\nWhitehead was to write on geometry, would have to be developed\npiecemeal. First the notions of a given branch of mathematics would\nhave to be defined in terms of earlier notions, such as classes of\nrelations with a given structure, and then the important basic results\nin that field would be proved one by one, in the style of the work so\nfar. Establishing logicism would be an ongoing project, as open-ended\nas mathematics itself.",
