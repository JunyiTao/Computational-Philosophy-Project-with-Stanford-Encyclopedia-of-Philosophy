    "preamble": "\n\nMany Christian doctrines raise difficult philosophical questions. For\nexample, Christians have traditionally insisted that they worship a\nsingle God, while simultaneously identifying that God with a trinity\ncomprised of three numerically distinct, fully divine persons: the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not easy to see how three\ndivine persons add up to one God. Similarly, Christians have also\nasserted that a human man, Jesus of Nazareth, is also God-the-Son, the\nsecond person of the divine trinity. It is not easy to see how a human\nman, who is born, lives, and dies, could also be a fully divine being.\nConsider also the relationship between divine providence and human\nfreedom. Are human beings free to accept or reject God, or does God\nalone decide who will accept or reject God? Any answer to this\ntheological question will also assume some specific philosophical\naccount of human freedom and moral responsibility.\n\nChristian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer\nthese kinds of questions. In the earliest years of Christianity,\nrunning roughly from the second to the seventh centuries CE, and often\ncalled the \u201cPatristic\u201d period, the emerging Christian\nChurch faced the daunting task of defining doctrinal orthodoxy in the\nface of internal and external challenges. In pursuing this task,\nPatristic thinkers typically did not understand themselves as\n\u201ctheologians\u201d in contrast to \u201cphilosophers\u201d.\nIndeed, they may not have endorsed any sharp distinction between\nphilosophy and theology at all. But they still reasoned about their\nChristian commitments in the intellectual idiom of the ancient\nMediterranean world, which was the idiom of Platonic, Aristotelian,\nand Stoic philosophy.\n\nOver the course of the Patristic period, as the early Church\nsuccessfully established its own intellectual framework, it formally\ndefined the boundaries of Christian orthodoxy through a series of\necumenical councils. These councils\u2014including the Councils of\nNicaea (325 CE), Constantinople (381), and Chalcedon\n(451)\u2014established the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and its\ncorollary, the doctrine of the Incarnation (see Kelly 1978).\n\nYet even after the parameters of orthodoxy were established, Christian\nthinkers continued to face difficult philosophical questions about the\nmeaning, coherence, and plausibility of settled Christian doctrines.\nThey continued to try to answer those questions using the best\nphilosophy of their day\u2014from Scholastic Aristotelianism in the\nMedieval period to analytic metaphysics today. For Christian\nthinkers, the already settled doctrines of Christian orthodoxy provide\na normative framework within which this philosophical reflection\noccurs, by demarcating the logical space that constrains the field of\nacceptable solutions. For example, it is not open to an orthodox\nChristian thinker to dispel the logical problem of the Trinity (the\nproblem of how God can be both three and one) by arguing that there is\nin fact no God, or that God is not triune, or that the Father and the\nSon are two stages in the temporal life of the one God. These\ntheoretical options are ruled out by virtue of the philosopher\u2019s\nown orthodox Christian commitments.\n\nAs a general, formal matter, this point holds even though different\nChristian groups disagree about what the constraints of orthodoxy\nactually are. So Roman Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians\nwill accept different constraints about, say, the nature of the\nEucharist, and rival Protestant Christian groups will differ with each\nother in a similar way. But as a formal matter, Christian thinkers who\nthink philosophically about Christian doctrines typically do so inside\nthe intellectual framework provided by what they regard as\nauthoritative Christian orthodoxy. Obviously, it is not the case that\neveryone who wants to think philosophically about Christianity must\naccept the constraints of Christian orthodoxy, even in this more\nrelativistic sense of \u201corthodoxy\u201d. Some modern and\ncontemporary thinkers still identify as Christians even though they\nreject the very idea of normative orthodoxy, for example. And, of\ncourse, non-Christian thinkers, including non-theists, will reject any\nnotion of Christian orthodoxy in its entirety. Yet they can still\nthink philosophically about Christian doctrines.\n\nBecause its twin foci are so broad, an encyclopedia entry on\n\u201cPhilosophy and Christian Theology\u201d could legitimately go\nin many different directions. This entry has two related aims. First,\nthe entry discusses methodological questions about how philosophy and\ntheology should be related. Accordingly, it surveys some of the most\nimportant ways they have been related in the history of the Christian\ntradition\n (Section 1),\n before turning to contemporary debates about the way Anglo-American\nanalytic philosophy of religion interacts with theology\n (Section 3).\n Second, in between these two methodological sections, the entry also\ndiscusses recent work in analytic philosophical theology\n (Section 2).\n Note that the previous version of this entry (Murray and Rea 2008\n[2021]) focused on topics in contemporary philosophical theology. That\nversion is archived and available via the\n Other Internet Resources\n but see, also, the topic-focused entries linked in the\n Related Entries\n for additional coverage.\n\nPhilosophical critics of contemporary analytic philosophy of religion\n(APR) are often struck by just how Christian and theological much of\nit seems. This criticism expresses the worry that APR as such looks\ntoo much like Christian philosophical theology. At the same time,\ntheological critics often fault APR for lacking theological\nsophistication\n (Section 3).\n In order to understand both poles of criticism, it is useful to have\na better sense of the relevant historical background\n (Section 1).\n But it is also important to appreciate what the best contemporary\nwork in analytic philosophical theology actually looks like\n (Section 2).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition\n\nAlthough modern thought tends to assume a sharp disjunction between\nphilosophy and theology, it is not at all obvious how to distinguish\nthem in a principled way. Suppose that we take philosophy in the\nbroadest sense to be the systematic use of human reason in an effort\nto understand the most fundamental features of reality, and suppose\nthat we take theology in the broadest sense to be the study of God and\nall things in relation to God. Then we should expect to see\nconsiderable overlap between the two: after all, God, if there is a\nGod, is surely one of the fundamental features of reality, and one to\nwhich all the other features presumably relate.\n\nIn practice, when we survey the history of Christian thought, we do\nsee considerable overlap between philosophy and theology. With respect\nto their topics of inquiry, philosophers and theologians\nalike ask questions about epistemology, axiology, and political\ntheory, as well as about metaphysics and fundamental ontology.\nSimilarly, with respect to their methods of inquiry,\nphilosophers and theologians alike interpret authoritative texts,\ndeploy arguments, and marshal evidence to support their conclusions.\nHere one might insist that Christian theological claims are grounded\nby appeals to \u201cfaith\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d, whereas\nphilosophical claims are grounded by appeals to \u201creason\u201d.\nThis contrast is promising when suitably developed, but it is not as\nsharp as one might initially suppose. Theology also makes appeals to\ncommon sense and ordinary human reason, and philosophy also has its\nversions of faith and authority.\n\nOf the making of typologies there is no end, but it is still worth\nexamining some of the most common ways that Christian thinkers\nthroughout the centuries have understood the relationship between\nphilosophy and theology. Without this historical background, it\nbecomes all-too-easy to draw the relationship in na\u00efve,\nanachronistic, and overly simplistic ways. In fact, no single\ninterpretation of the relationship between philosophy and theology can\nclaim overwhelming support from the Christian tradition. From outside\nthe Christian tradition, while many non-Christian thinkers see\nphilosophy and theology as quite distinct, others deliberately blur\nthe distinction between them\u2014because they think that theology is\nactually just misguided philosophy.\n\nAt the top-level of the proposed typology, we can distinguish between\n\u201cIntegration\u201d and \u201cContrast\u201d views.\nIntegration views do not distinguish philosophy and theology at all,\nwhereas Contrast views do. We can disambiguate the\n\u201cContrast\u201d category into \u201cCooperation\u201d views,\n\u201cDisjunction\u201d views, and \u201cConflict\u201d views. The\nmost prominent Cooperation views treat philosophy as a valuable,\nperhaps even necessary, tool for theological inquiry, and still allow\nsome degree of overlap between the two. Disjunction views, by\ncontrast, regard philosophy and theology as non-overlapping forms of\ninquiry, which feature distinct and ultimately unrelated goals and\nmethods. \u201cConflict\u201d views treat philosophy and theology as\nnot only distinct but mutually antagonistic. In fact, however, few\nChristian thinkers have endorsed outright conflict between philosophy\nand theology. But it is still worth discussing the Conflict view\nexplicitly, because some prominent Christian theologians throughout\nhistory\u2014for example, Tertullian, Martin Luther, or Karl\nBarth\u2014initially seem to advocate Conflict. Upon closer\ninspection, however, their views are closer to those in the\nDisjunction category.\n\nThese categories are crude. They could each be further divided, and\nsubdivided again. They focus mainly on different Christian\nattitudes toward the interaction of philosophy and theology, rather\nthan on the attitudes of non-Christian philosophers. Some non-empty\ncategories are omitted altogether. But these categories do capture\nmuch of the landscape, and at least show that there are more options\navailable than a na\u00efve conflict between faith and reason.\n1.1 Integration\n\nThe Integration model treats philosophy and Christian theology as\ncontinuous, integrated activities. On this model, rational inquiry\nabout God does not sharply divide into discrete activities called\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d. Instead, there is\nsimply the single, continuous intellectual task of trying to\nunderstand God, and all things in relation to God, using all of\none\u2019s intellectual resources. This account does not deny the\nimportance of faith or revelation to the Christian intellectual life;\nrather, it denies that faith and revelation properly belong to a\nseparate activity called \u201ctheology\u201d in distinction from\nanother activity called \u201cphilosophy\u201d. According to this\nview, when we engage in rational inquiry of any sort, we should draw\non every available source of knowledge that is relevant to that\ninquiry. So when we engage in rational inquiry about Christian topics,\nwe should draw on scripture, Church tradition, and other such sources\nof knowledge, whether we call the resulting inquiry\n\u201ctheology\u201d, \u201cphilosophy\u201d, or something else.\nTo do anything else would be to hobble our inquiry from the outset,\naccording to the Integration view.\n\nThis account of the relationship between philosophy and theology has\ndeep roots in the Christian tradition. Before the rise of the medieval\nuniversity, it was the dominant view, and it still has contemporary\ndefenders (discussed below). Patristic thinkers did not typically\ndescribe their own intellectual work as \u201ctheology\u201d. The\nterm \u201ctheology\u201d already had a fixed meaning in late\nantiquity. It meant \u201cpoetic speech about the gods\u201d, and\nwas in general associated with pagan story-telling and myth-making:\nthe great \u201ctheologians\u201d, were Homer and Hesiod. Even\nthough Christian thinkers like Gregory of Nazianzus sometimes acquired\nthe honorific title \u201cTheologian\u201d, they did so because of\nthe lyrical and poetic quality of their writing, not because they\nwrote about Christian doctrinal topics (Zachhuber 2020; McGinn\n2008).\n\nThe general term that early Christian thinkers used to describe their\nintellectual work was, more often than not, simply\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cChristian philosophy\u201d.\nChristianity was regarded as the \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d over\nagainst the false philosophical schools associated with pagan thought.\n(See Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 8.1; Clement of\nAlexandria, Stromata 1.28.3, 1.28.4 1.80.5,6; Augustine of\nHippo, Against Julian, 4.14.72.) This usage is consistent\nwith Pierre Hadot\u2019s (1995) claim that in Greco-Roman antiquity\nphilosophy was understood as a comprehensive way of life.\nChristianity, on this model, is analogous to a philosophical school,\nin Hadot\u2019s sense (see also Zachhuber 2020).\n\nThe Integration account continued to be the default account of the\nrelationship between philosophy and theology into the early Medieval\nperiod. Before the rise of scholasticism in the great Western\nuniversities, there was no sharp distinction between philosophy and\ntheology. Anselm of Canterbury, for example, certainly has the concept\nof a line of inquiry that proceeds using reason alone, without\nappealing to revelation, but he does not label that inquiry\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in distinction from \u201ctheology\u201d.\nMoreover, in his own writings, he frequently blurs any such\ndistinction, as he seamlessly moves between rational reflection and\nargument, on the one hand, to prayers, meditations, and exclamations\nof thanksgiving, on the other (e.g., Proslogion 1\u20134).\nLike many premodern Christian thinkers, Anselm also held that\nintellectual inquiry and personal holiness are linked, so that the\nmore one grows in Christian virtue, the more rationally one is able to\nthink about God (Adams 2004; Sweeney, 2011). This understanding of\ninquiry and virtue is also a hallmark of the Integration account.\n1.2 Contrast\n\nUnlike the Integration model, the Contrast model insists that\nphilosophy and theology are fundamentally different forms of inquiry.\nStrictly speaking, there can be many different Contrast models,\nbecause the relevant sense of \u201ccontrast\u201d comes in degrees.\nI focus on three: Cooperation, Disjunction, and Conflict. On the\nCooperation account, philosophy and theology remain close cousins.\nWhen rightly pursued, they cannot really conflict, and they can even\noverlap in their respective topics of inquiry, sources, and methods.\nNevertheless, the Cooperation account holds that the overlap between\nphilosophy and theology is only partial, because they each begin from\ndifferent intellectual starting points and appeal to different sources\nof evidence (Baker-Hytch 2016; Chignell 2009: 117; Simmons 2019). On\nanother version of the Contrast model, Disjunction, philosophy and\ntheology are even further apart: although they still do not conflict,\nand may even consider the same topics in an attenuated sense, their\nstarting assumptions and methods of investigation are different enough\nthat they share no significant conclusions. Finally, Conflict accounts\nassert that the conclusions of Christian theology are positively\nirrational from the point of view of philosophy. Although some\nhistorically important Christian thinkers might seem to endorse\nConflict, closer inspection shows that they do not. Nevertheless, in\nthe popular imagination, a persistent assumption holds that\nChristianity requires a sharp conflict between theology and\nphilosophy\u2014or at least faith and reason\u2014and so it is worth\nbriefly discussing why Conflict has had few traditional defenders.\n1.2.1 Cooperation\n\nOn the Cooperation account, philosophy and theology are understood to\nbe different, but mutually supporting, intellectual activities. For\nChristian thinkers who advocate Cooperation, philosophy and theology\nform a coherent, mutually supportive whole. They are not in conflict\nwith respect to their conclusions, since truth cannot contradict\ntruth, but they differ with respect to their foundational axioms,\ngoals, and sources of evidence. Philosophy is understood as a preamble\nto theology, while theology completes and fulfills philosophy. Thomas\nAquinas is a foundational advocate of the Cooperation account\n(Summa Theologiae 1.1.1\u20138, Summa Contra\nGentiles 1.1.1\u20139, Hankey 2001). Often the relationship\nbetween philosophy and theology is described in hierarchical and\ninstrumental terms: theology draws on philosophy as needed, because\nphilosophy is instrumentally useful to theology. According to a\ntraditional metaphor, philosophy is the servant of theology\n(ancilla theologiae, literally \u201chandmaid\u201d of\ntheology; see Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 1.1.5). In a\nmore contemporary idiom, theology uses conceptual tools provided by\nphilosophy in the pursuit of its own distinctive intellectual task:\nelucidating the meaning and truth of revealed Christian doctrines.\n\nOn the Cooperation account, theology differs from philosophy chiefly\nbecause theology assumes the truth of divine revelation, whereas\nphilosophy does not. Philosophy takes its foundational axioms and\nassumptions from generally available truths of human reason and\nsensory experience. Philosophy and theology also differ in the way\nthey argue and in the kinds of intellectual appeals that are proper to\neach. Theologians can appeal to revelation\u2014scripture and\nauthoritative Church tradition\u2014in order to generate new lines of\ninquiry, and can treat revealed truths as evidence in their\ninvestigations. For their part, philosophers must appeal only to\npremises and evidence that are in principle available to any rational\ninquirer.\n\nThis distinction between \u201crevealed truths\u201d and\n\u201ctruths of reason\u201d implies that at least some revealed\ntruths are not also truths of reason. By hypothesis, such truths would\nhave remained unknown and unknowable had they not been revealed by\nGod. (It therefore follows that without revelation, Christian theology\ncould not exist, on the Cooperation account.) Paradigmatic instances\nof revealed truths are the doctrine of the Trinity, and the doctrine\nof the Incarnation. Throughout the centuries, most, though not all,\nbroadly orthodox Christian thinkers have held that human beings could\nnot reason their way to the truth of these doctrines without the aid\nof divine revelation.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, theologians use the conceptual tools furnished\nby philosophy to elucidate the contents of revelation. Just like\nphilosophers, theologians make arguments, and their arguments appeal\nto common standards of logic and rigor, even though they also draw on\ntheology\u2019s own unique (revealed) axioms and sources of evidence\n(Summa Theologiae 1.1.1). Philosophical arguments cannot\nprove the foundational truths of revelation, according to Aquinas, but\nat the same time, revelation and reason cannot conflict. (That God\nexists is a truth of reason, not revelation, for Aquinas\u2014see\nSumma Theologiae 1.2.2, reply to obj. 1.) Theologians can\ntherefore use common standards of philosophical reasoning to answer\nany putative objections to their theological claims, by showing that\nany alleged conflict is only apparent. So, for example, even though it\nis not possible to establish that God is triune by means of\nphilosophical arguments, it is possible to use philosophical arguments\nin a defensive mode, to answer objections alleging that the doctrine\nof the trinity is logically incoherent. When arguing with other\nChristians, theologians can appeal to revelation to support their\nclaims. When arguing with opponents who do not accept revelation, they\ncannot (Summa Theologiae 1.1.8). Yet this restriction is not\nreally a disciplinary maxim designed to oppose philosophy to theology,\nbut a pragmatic admission that one cannot successfully persuade\nopponents by appealing to premises they deny.\n1.2.2 Disjunction\n\nLike Cooperation, the Disjunction view holds that philosophy and\ntheology are different forms of inquiry. Similarly, like Cooperation,\nthe Disjunction view also that agrees that there can be no real\nconflict between the conclusions of philosophy (when true) and those\nof theology. But the Disjunction view goes further: Disjunction\nadvocates deny that there is any significant overlap between\nphilosophy and theology at all.\n\nDisjunction does not subordinate philosophy to theology or treat\nphilosophy as an essential tool for theology. Instead, to borrow a\nterm from contemporary science and religion debates, philosophy and\ntheology are \u201cnon-overlapping magisteria\u201d (Gould 1997). In\nparticular, Cooperation\u2019s appeal to the distinction between\ntruths of reason and truths of revelation does not suffice to\ndistinguish philosophy from theology, according to Disjunction\nadvocates, who instead appeal to various more fundamental distinctions\nof method or approach (see discussion below). Of course, even those\nwho explicitly advocate Disjunction will occasionally deploy\nsome methods associated with philosophy: carefully defining\nterms, making formally valid arguments, uncovering contradictions in\nopposing views, etc. Yet these methods are found in any form of\nrational inquiry, and so (presumably) they do not belong to philosophy\nalone.\n\nAny given thinker\u2019s view of Disjunction will of course depend on\ntheir underlying construal of philosophy and theology. Some\nthinkers\u2014even some Christian thinkers\u2014endorse the\nDisjunction view because they deny that theology is really a\npropositional, truth-apt discourse that proceeds by way of arguments\nand evidence. Instead, theology is something else\nentirely\u2014poetry, perhaps; or a form of worship, praise, or\nprayer (Caputo 2015). This view of theology implies a sharp contrast\nwith Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy, modern philosophy, and\ncontemporary Anglo-American Analytic philosophy, though perhaps not\nwith philosophy tout court. Philosophers might associate this\nview with the \u201cexpressivist\u201d or \u201cemotivist\u201d\ncritiques of theology that were common in the heyday of logical\npositivism. But in fact, versions of the \u201ctheology as\npoetry\u201d view are found throughout the history of Christian\nthought (Beggiani 2014).\n\nOther versions of the Disjunction view figure even more prominently in\nthe Christian tradition. The foundational Protestant reformers, Martin\nLuther and John Calvin, both advocate Disjunction, in part because\nthey both reject the synthesis of philosophy and theology that\ncharacterized late medieval scholasticism. According to Luther,\nphilosophy and theology proceed from entirely different perspectives,\nwith different starting points and different goals (1539 [1966: 244];\nGrosshans 2017). Philosophy considers its objects of inquiry from the\nperspective of common human reason and sense experience, with the goal\nof trying to understand things as they actually are in the real world.\nTheology considers its objects of inquiry from a creational and\neschatological perspective, with the goal of trying to understand them\nin relation to God as their creator and final end. Furthermore, for\nLuther, \u201ccreation\u201d and its cognates are properly\ntheological terms whose meaning derives from scripture and\nrevelation, and which should not be identified with any philosophical\nnotion of a first cause or prime mover; mutatis mutandis, the\nsame point hold for creation\u2019s final end in God (1539 [1966:\n245, 248]).\n\nEven when philosophy and theology do consider the same object of\ninquiry\u2014for example, the human being\u2014this difference in\nperspective ensures that the lines of inquiry remain completely\nseparate. Luther\u2019s 1536 \u201cDisputation Concerning\nMan\u201d, for example opens with the thesis that \u201cPhilosophy\nor human wisdom defines man as an animal having reason, sensation, and\nbody\u201d and then goes on to explore this definition. But his\nexploration only serves to contrast this philosophical view of the\nhuman being with the perspective of theology. Theology,\n\n\nfrom the fulness of its wisdom, defines man as whole and\nperfect\u2026 made in the beginning after the image of God\u2026\nsubject to the power of the devil, sin and death\u2026freed and\ngiven eternal life only through the Son of God, Jesus Christ. (1536\n[1966: 137\u2013138])\n\n\nLuther\u2019s theological account of the human being does not\ncontradict the philosophical account, but it also does not\ncomplete or augment that account, because (according to Luther)\nproperly theological claims are simply unintelligible to philosophy\n(1536 [1966: 137\u2013140]; 1539 [1966: 240\u2013241, 242]). They do\nnot belong to the same universe of discourse.\n\nCalvin shares Luther\u2019s basic understanding of the disjunction\nbetween philosophy and theology. Like Luther, Calvin holds that the\nFall has corrupted the power of human reason, but has not destroyed it\naltogether (Institutes 2.2.12\u201317). When restricted to\nits proper sphere\u2014matters pertaining to the natural\nworld\u2014philosophy remains valuable. But as a result of the Fall,\n\u201cheavenly things\u201d are inaccessible to unaided human reason\n(Institutes 2.2.13). By \u201cheavenly things\u201d, Calvin\nmeans the saving truths of the Gospel.\n\nSo far, Calvin\u2019s understanding might seem quite similar to the\nCooperation view, which also denies that revealed truths are\naccessible to human reason. But Calvin further distinguishes\nphilosophy from theology at the level of method, by denying that true\ntheology engages in abstract, speculative reasoning, which he\nassociates with philosophy, and insisting that any legitimate\nknowledge of God must be practical and affective (Institutes\n1.12.1, 1.5.10). For example, according to Calvin, it would be impious\nand dangerous to speculate on all the actions that God could possibly\ndo\u2014God\u2019s absolute power. Instead, we should focus our\nloving attention on what God has actually done, paradigmatically in\nthe person and work of Christ (Institutes 3.24.2; Helm 2004:\n24\u201326). Theology presupposes Christian faith, which is an\naffective response to Christ, and which requires \u201cconfidence and\nassurance of heart\u201d (Institutes 3.2.33). Yet scholastic\nphilosophy, with its \u201cendless labyrinths\u201d and\n\u201cobscure definitions\u201d, has \u201cdrawn a veil over Christ\nto hide him\u201d (Institutes 3.2.2).\n\nFor Luther and Calvin, then, there can be no genuinely\nphilosophical theology. Even though both agree that\nphilosophical speculation can arrive at some limited truths about,\ne.g., a first cause, or about the nature of human beings, those truths\nare of no theological interest; even as bare propositional claims,\nthey are already better and more fully known in theological inquiry.\nFrom the other direction, the properly Christian notions of God as\ncreator and of the human being as imago dei, e.g., resist all\nphilosophical speculation. Of course, Luther and Calvin can only hold\nthese views because of the way they understand philosophy and\ntheology. They both identify philosophy with late medieval\nscholasticism, and they both understand theology as a kind of\nexistential encounter with God and Christ, as revealed in the\nscriptures. Different accounts of philosophy and theology would yield\ndifferent construals of the underlying disjunction, or no disjunction\nat all.\n1.2.3 Conflict\n\nNone of the three views considered so far\u2014Integration,\nCooperation, and Disjunction\u2014assume any real, essential conflict\nbetween philosophy and theology. All three views allow for\napparent conflict, due to errors of reasoning or\ninterpretation, or when either discipline departs from its own proper\nsphere, but they do not assert that Christian theology or Christian\nfaith is irrational from the point of view of philosophy, nor do they\nhold that any significant Christian doctrinal claims can be falsified\nby sound philosophical reasoning. Throughout the history of Christian\nthought, many prominent Christian philosophers and theologians have\ncriticized philosophy, or fulminated against what they regard as\nphilosophical overreach, but few if any have regarded philosophy and\ntheology as essentially incompatible, in the sense just outlined.\nPopular understandings of \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201creason\u201d\noften posit a deep and abiding conflict between the two, and so it is\nimportant to emphasize just how rare that position has actually been\namong major Christian philosophers and theologians. Key figures who\nare often regarded as Conflict advocates, turn out, upon closer\ninspection, to hold a different view.\n\nFor example, the Patristic theologian Tertullian famously asks\n\u201cWhat has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d but he never\nactually asserted the irrationalist credo \u201cI believe because it\nis absurd\u201d (De praescriptione haereticorum 7; De\ncarne Christi 5.4; see also Harrison 2017). Instead, like all the\nPatristic fathers, Tertullian regarded human reason as one of\nGod\u2019s greatest gifts; ratio (reason) is one of his most\nfrequently used nouns, and his own writing draws heavily on the stoic\nphilosophy of his day (Osborn 1997).\n\nTurning to a putative modern irrationalist, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\npresents the incarnation as a paradox that offends human reason in his\n(pseudonymous) 1844 Philosophical Fragments, but close\nreading shows that \u201cparadox\u201d and \u201coffence\u201d do\nnot equate to \u201cformal contradiction\u201d (1844 [1985: 53,\n101]; Evans 1989). Rather, the incarnation seems paradoxical only to\nfallen, sinful human reason (1844, [1985: 46\u201347]). So\nthe \u201coffence\u201d of the incarnation resolves into the claim\nthat the doctrine of the incarnation had to be revealed, because its\ntruth exceeds the limits of fallen reason. But, as discussed above,\naccepting this claim about the incarnation has been the norm\nthroughout the Christian tradition. Moreover, according to\nKierkegaard, even though the truth of the incarnation exceeds the\nlimits of human reason, the claim that reason has limits is itself one\nthat can be assessed by human reason (1846 [1992: 580]; Evans 1989:\n355).\n\nFinally, the twentieth century theologian Karl Barth\u2019s famous\n\u201cNo!\u201d to philosophical reasoning about God is also best\nunderstood as a rejection of philosophical overreach rather than a\nrejection of philosophy per se (Brunner & Barth 1946). According\nto Barth, we cannot establish the truth of theological claims using\ngenerally persuasive arguments available to any rational enquirer. But\nBarth had no quarrel with using philosophy in an Anselmian mode, to\nelucidate and clarify the implications of divine revelation, and in\nprinciple he even allows that there could be a genuinely Christian\nphilosophy (1932 [1975: 6]; Diller 2010).\n\nThese prominent Christian thinkers all criticize what they see as\nphilosophical hubris, but they do not set philosophy and theology as\nsuch in essential opposition, and they do not agree that any\nbelief-worthy Christian doctrines actually are irrational\u2014still\nless that they can be falsified by sound philosophical reasoning. In a\nway, this conclusion should be unsurprising. It is a basic claim of\nChristian orthodoxy that God is the very summit and source of\nrationality, and that human reason is one of God\u2019s greatest\ngifts (Turner 2004; A. N. Williams 2007; Crisp et al. 2012). Christian\nthinkers have differed about the degree to which sin and the Fall have\ncaused human reason to malfunction, but the suggestion that\ntheological truths conflict with properly functioning human\nreason is alien to the orthodox Christian tradition, and so it is\nunsurprising that few major Christian thinkers have endorsed it. Far\nmore common is the claim that some theological truths are inaccessible\nto philosophy because they somehow surpass human reason. On this line,\nwhen there is an apparent conflict between a philosophical conclusion\nand some Christian truth, the conflict is treated as a sign that\nphilosophy has overstepped its own proper boundaries, not a sign that\nChristian truth actually conflicts with human reason. By and large,\neven the sharpest Christian critics of philosophy have held this\nview.\n1.3 From Historical Models to Contemporary Philosophical Theology\n\nThis historical survey has focused on prominent models of the\nrelationship between philosophy and theology in the history of\nChristian thought. The survey also illuminates some contemporary\nphilosophical and theological debates about how to understand this\nrelationship.\n\nNotwithstanding its Patristic origins, the Integrationist view has\nbeen especially prominent in recent philosophy of religion. For\nexample, Alvin Plantinga\u2019s (1984) programmatic essay\n\u201cAdvice to Christian Philosophers\u201d intentionally blurs the\ndistinction between philosophy and theology. Plantinga argues that\nChristian philosophers qua philosophers are entitled to base their\narguments on revealed truths, and urges them to investigate\ndistinctively Christian questions that may be of no interest to the\nwider philosophical community. More recent defenders of\n\u201canalytic theology\u201d have also taken an integrationist\nline. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of\nEnlightenment-style foundationalism has thoroughly blurred the\ndistinction between philosophy and theology:\n\n\nWhat difference does [this distinction] make, now that analytic\nphilosophers no longer believe that for some piece of discourse to be\na specimen of philosophy, the writer must base all his arguments on\npublic philosophical reason? Call it what you will. (Wolterstorff\n2009: 168; see also Stump 2013: 48\u201349; Timpe 2015: 13)\n\n\nYet this prominent Integrationist line has been strongly criticized by\nother philosophers of religion, who implicitly endorse some version of\nthe Contrast view, on which philosophy cannot legitimately appeal to\ntheological sources of evidence like revelation and Church authority\n(Simmons 2019; Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2\u20134).\nAt the same time, according to many Christian theologians, analytic\nphilosophy as such is almost uniquely unsuitable for investigating\nproperly theological questions (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013:\n123\u2013134). On the view of these critics, analytic philosophical\ntheology does not revive the Patristic integration of philosophy and\ntheology at all; rather, it remains a distinctly anti-theological form\nof modern philosophy.\n\nContemporary philosophers and theologians continue to debate the\nproper relationship between philosophy and theology. Before\nconsidering these debates in further detail (in\n Section 3),\n however, it is useful to briefly survey recent work in analytic\nphilosophical theology. The fact that the Integrationist view has been\nso prominent among contemporary analytic philosophers of religion has\nhelped shape a philosophical climate in which self-identified\nphilosophers, working in departments of philosophy, find it completely\nnatural to investigate explicitly Christian theological questions,\nfrom within the framework of normative Christian orthodoxy, in the\ncourse of their academic work.\n2. Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology\n\nRecent work in analytic philosophical theology has engaged with nearly\nevery major Christian doctrine. But work has focused on the most\ncentral doctrines: Trinity, Incarnation and Christology, Salvation and\nAtonement, and Sin and Original Sin. This section lays out the most\nsignificant philosophical problems associated with each doctrine and\nidentifies some of the foundational philosophical responses from\ncontemporary thinkers.\n2.1 Trinity\n\nAnalytic philosophical theology on the Trinity has focused primarily\non the \u201clogical\u201d problem of the Trinity, the problem of\nhow the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014construed as three\nreally existing, really distinct divine entities\u2014can also be\nexactly one God (Cartwright 1987). The Church\u2019s first two\necumenical councils defined the orthodox terminology now used to state\nthe doctrine, but the councils did not attempt a philosophical\nsolution to the logical problem. In the traditional terminology, the\nFather, Son, and Spirit are three distinct divine persons\n(personae in Latin; hypostases in Greek) who share a\nsingle divine nature (substantia in Latin;\nousia in Greek; see Tanner 1990: 5, 24, 28). The logical\nproblem then becomes the problem of how three divine persons (whatever\nwe mean by \u201cpersons\u201d) can instantiate a single divine\nnature (whatever we mean by \u201cnature\u201d) while remaining\nnumerically distinct.\n\nResponses to the logical problem can be grouped into several families,\neach with its own advantages and disadvantages. \u201cSocial\u201d\ntrinitarians defend an account of the Trinity on which the Father,\nSon, and Spirit are three distinct centers of consciousness, with\nthree distinct centers of knowledge, will, and action, who\nnevertheless count as a single God. Social trinitarians attempt to\nsecure the divine unity by arguing that a single divine nature can\nsupport three separate consciousnesses. They may also claim that the\nthree persons necessarily love each other so perfectly and act in such\nharmony that they are properly regarded as a single God. Prominent\nsocial trinitarians include Richard Swinburne (1994), William Lane\nCraig (2006), Keith Yandell (2009), and William Hasker (2013).\n\nBy contrast, \u201cLatin\u201d trinitarians deny that the Father,\nSon, and Spirit are distinct centers of consciousness. On Latin\ntrinitarianism, even though the Father, Son, and Spirit are\nnumerically distinct persons, they are not numerically\ndistinct divine agents. When they act, they do not merely act\nin perfect harmony (as on social trinitarianism). Rather they are\n(somehow) a single actor, with a single will, carrying out a single\naction. The special challenge for Latin trinitarianism is to explain\nhow it can be the case that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so\nconstrued, really do exist as concrete, distinct entities, and are not\njust different names for the same entity, or different phases in the\nlife of a not-essentially triune God. Brian Leftow offers the most\nwell-developed Latin model, which appeals to an extended analogy to a\ntime-travelling chorus-line dancer (2004).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the sharpest critics of Latin trinitarianism are those\nwho advocate a social trinity, and vice-versa: each side insists that\nthe theoretical costs of the opposing view are too great. So Latin\ntrinitarians charge that social trinitarians do not escape tri-theism\n(Leftow 1999; see also Merricks 2006); social trinitarians argue that\ntheir Latin counterparts cannot explain how the Father and Son could\nhave a genuine, \u201cI\u2013you\u201d, personal relationship, as\nthe Biblical account seems to suggest (e.g., Matt 3:17, Mark 14:36;\nHasker 2013: 114\u2013118; McCall 2010: 87\u201388).\n\nPhilosophical responses to the logical problem of the Trinity do not\ndivide exhaustively into social models and Latin models.\n\u201cRelative identity\u201d theorists argue that identity is\nkind-relative, so the Father can be the same God as the Son\nwithout being the same person as the son (van Inwagen 1995).\n\u201cConstitution\u201d theorists make a similar claim by drawing\non the metaphysics of constitution. According to constitution\ntheorists, a lump of bronze can constitute a statue without\nbeing identical to it, since we can destroy the statue (by melting it\ndown) without destroying the bronze. So too, they argue, the divine\nnature can constitute the three divine persons without being identical\nto them, or without entailing that they are identical to each other\n(Brower & Rea 2005). The metaphysics of constitution requires a\ncoherent notion of \u201cnumerical sameness without identity\u201d.\nThe sharpest criticism of relative identity accounts of the Trinity\ntakes aim at the underlying notion that identity is kind-relative in\nthe relevant sense. Similarly, the sharpest criticism of constitution\nviews expresses doubts about the cogency and usefulness of the\nmetaphysics of constitution (Merricks 2006).\n\nScott Williams defends a hybrid \u201cLatin social\u201d model of\nthe Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are each constituted\nby the single divine nature, without being numerically identical to\nthe divine nature or to any other person (2013, 2017). Unlike other\nLatin models, on Williams\u2019s account each of the persons is a\ndistinct agent; unlike other social models, they share numerically one\nset of powers, including one will (2017). Even so, according to\nWilliams, the persons can each token the indexical \u201cI\u201d\nwith different senses. Critics argue that Williams\u2019s model\nfalters at precisely this point (Hasker 2018b; see also S. Williams\n2020).\n\nFor an extended discussion, see the entry,\n Trinity.\n2.2 Incarnation and Christology\n\nBy the close of the fourth century, the early Church had agreed that\nGod the Son, the second person of the Trinity, is no less divine than\nGod the Father. But this Trinitarian settlement led directly to\nanother, equally vexing question: how could Jesus of Nazareth, a human\nman, also be identical to God the Son? After another period of intense\ndebate, the Church defined the doctrine of the Incarnation, which\nasserts that Christ is one person (or one hypostasis) who\nexists in two natures, one fully human, the other fully divine (Tanner\n1990: 83; Kelly 1978: 338\u2013343). Yet, as with the doctrine of the\nTrinity, on its own, this conciliar terminology does not attempt to\nsolve the underlying philosophical problem.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, this problem has been called the\n\u201cfundamental philosophical problem of Christology\u201d. As\nRichard Cross puts it:\n\n\nhow is it that one and the same thing could be both divine (and thus,\non the face of it, necessary, and necessarily omniscient, omnipotent,\neternal, immutable, impassible, and impeccable) and human (and thus,\non the face of it, have the complements of all these properties)?\n(Cross 2009: 453)\n\n\nIn other words, the fundamental philosophical problem of Christology\nis the problem that arises when a single subject bears incompatible\nproperties. Christ seems to be both necessarily omniscient, as the\ndivine Son, the second person of the Trinity, and yet also limited in\nknowledge, as the human man, Jesus of Nazareth\u2014and so on for\nother divine and human attributes. Yet Christ is one person, not two:\nhe just is the divine Son and he just is Jesus of\nNazareth. On standard interpretations of logical consistency, nothing\ncan have logically incompatible properties at the same time and in the\nsame respect\u2014hence the problem.\n\nA venerable attempted solution to the problem of incompatible\nproperties makes use of grammatical modifiers to index Christological\npredications to their respective natures: Christ is limited in\nknowledge qua his human nature, and omniscient qua\nhis divine nature, where \u201cqua\u201d means \u201cwith respect\nto\u201d or \u201cin virtue of\u201d. More simply: Christ\nqua human is limited in knowledge; Christ qua divine\nis omniscient. The thought of Thomas Aquinas furnishes a foundational\nsource for this solution (Summa Theologiae 3.16.1\u201312;\nfor broader discussion of patristic and medieval uses, see Cross 2002:\n192\u2013205). Thomas Senor forcefully argues that this grammatical\nsolution does not work, for it cannot block the relevant entailment:\nsince the one Christ really is human and really is divine, it follows\nthat the one Christ is also limited in knowledge (qua human)\nand omniscient (qua divine), and so the contradiction remains\n(Senor 2002; see also Morris 1986).\n\nKenotic Christologies hold that at the point of incarnation, in order\nto become a human being, God the Son relinquished the divine\nattributes (Forrest 2000; Evans 2002, 2006). In a way, the kenotic\noption neatly solves the problem of incompatible properties, since\nChrist is not omnipotent and omniscient (etc.) at the same time as he\nis limited in power and knowledge. Kenotic Christologies have a\nvenerable pedigree, as well as some clear Biblical warrant\n(Philippians 2; for discussion see Evans 2006; McGuckin 1994 [2004:\n189]. But if omnipotence and omniscience are essential divine\nattributes, then it is not possible for God the Son to relinquish them\nduring the incarnation and regain them after the incarnation while\nremaining self-identical.\n\nCompositional Christologies try to solve the problem of incompatible\nproperties by appealing to the various \u201cparts\u201d that\ntogether compose the whole Christ. According to Thomas V. Morris,\nChrist is composed of the divine mind of God the Son, a human mind,\nand a human body. On his telling, Christ counts as fully divine,\nbecause he has a divine mind, which is the seat of his omnipotence and\nomniscience; he also counts as fully human because he has a human mind\nand a human body (Morris 1986). Morris seeks to dispel the\ncontradiction between divine and human attributes by revising our\nunderstanding of Christ\u2019s human attributes. Morris denies that\nhuman beings as such are essentially limited in power and knowledge\n(etc.). This move clears the way for attributing omnipotence and\nomniscience (etc.) even to the human, incarnate Christ, while also\ndenying that the human, incarnate Christ is limited in power and\nknowledge. Richard Swinburne (1994) defends a similar Christology, but\naccording to Swinburne, Christ is composed only of God the Son and a\nhuman body, which together constitute both a human way of thinking and\nacting and also a divine way of thinking and acting.\n\nOther compositional Christologies appeal to supposed mereological\nfacts about the incarnation to ground a more sophisticated version of\nthe \u201cqua move\u201d (discussed above). If God the Son has human\nparts and divine parts, then perhaps the whole mereological composite\ncan borrow properties from its constituent parts without violating the\nlaw of non-contradiction. Analogously, we might say that an apple is\nboth colored and not colored, since it is red (colored) with respect\nto its skin, but white (not colored) with respect to its flesh. There\nis a sense in which the apple as a whole is both colored and not\ncolored because it borrows properties from its parts. Perhaps\nsomething similar can be said about Christ, understood as a\nmereological composite of God the Son, a human body, and a human soul.\nLeading advocates of this sort of view include Brian Leftow (1992,\n2011) and Eleonore Stump (2002).\n\nTimothy Pawl (2014, 2016) seeks to dispel the fundamental problem by\nrevising the truth conditions of Christological predications like\n\u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d and \u201cChrist is limited in\nknowledge\u201d. According to Pawl, it is incorrect that \u201cbeing\nomniscient\u201d and \u201cbeing limited in knowledge\u201d are\nlogically contradictory properties at all. In fact, according to Pawl,\nonce we correctly understand their truth conditions, we can see that\nthey can both be true of the same subject after all. On Pawl\u2019s\naccount, \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d is true just in case\nChrist has a nature that is omniscient and \u201cChrist is limited in\nknowledge\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is\nlimited in knowledge. Because Christ, and only Christ (so far as we\nknow) has two natures, only Christ can be both omniscient and limited\nin knowledge. At first glance, Pawl\u2019s proposed solution might\nseem to be the \u201cqua move\u201d once again, in different dress.\nBut it is importantly different: Pawl is content to affirm the very\nentailments (e.g., \u201cChrist is omniscient and limited in\nknowledge\u201d) that the qua move seeks to block; he simply denies\nthat this entailment is logically contradictory.\n\nJc\u00a0Beall goes a step further and argues that some predicates\nreally are both true and false of Christ, because Christ really is a\ncontradictory being (2019, 2021). Beall defends a contradictory\nChristology because he accepts a non-standard model of logic, one on\nwhich some predicates can be neither true nor false of a subject, and\nother predicates can be both true and false of a subject. According to\nBeall, logic as such\u2014that is, his favored account of\nlogic\u2014is neutral about whether any given substantive theory\ncontains true contradictions. To determine whether it does, we must\nexamine the theory\u2019s axiomatic statements. When we examine the\naxioms of orthodox Christology, according to Beall, we find that they\ninclude authoritative conciliar statements that are most naturally\nread as contradictory\u2014e.g., \u201cChrist is passible and\nimpassible\u201d (2019: 415). Rather than revise or reinterpret such\nstatements so that they are not contradictory, we should accept that\nthey are.\n2.3 Atonement and Salvation\n\nArguably, the deepest and most fundamental Christian affirmation is\nthat Christ saves. In traditional terminology, another way to express\nthe same affirmation is that Christ \u201catones\u201d for the sins\nof human beings. Unlike the doctrines of the Trinity and the\nIncarnation, however, the early Church never formally defined a single\northodox account of exactly how Christ saves or what it is about his\nlife, death, and resurrection that accomplishes that saving work. As a\nresult, a variety of theories or models of atonement have proliferated\nthroughout the centuries. Contemporary work in analytic philosophical\ntheology typically builds on these models, reformulates them in\ncontemporary language, and seeks to defend them from criticism.\n\nSatisfaction models argue that as a result of their sinfulness, human\nbeings have a debt or obligation to God that they cannot possibly\nrepay. By becoming incarnate, living a sinless life, and voluntarily\ndying for the sake of humanity, Christ successfully discharges the\ndebts and obligations that human beings owe to God. Anselm\u2019s\n\u201cWhy God Became Human\u201d (Cur deus homo) is the\nlocus classicus for the satisfaction theory, which has more\nrecently been defended by Swinburne (1988). Closely related to\nsatisfaction models, penal substitution models claim that human beings\ndeserve punishment from God as a result of their sinfulness. Christ\nsaves by freely agreeing to be punished in their place. Mark Murphy\n(2009) proposes a similar model of \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d,\non which Christ\u2019s suffering actually counts as the required\npunishment for guilty human beings, since knowing that a loved one\nsuffers in one\u2019s place is itself a form of punishment.\n\nSatisfaction and penal substitution theorists must explain why a\nperfectly merciful God would require satisfaction or punishment from\nhuman beings at all, and why a perfectly just God would allow an\ninnocent person to play the required role (Porter 2004). Accordingly,\nsatisfaction and penal substitution views have been heavily criticized\nby modern and contemporary theologians for depicting God as a petty,\nwrathful tyrant. Adolph von Harnack\u2019s nineteenth-century\ncriticism of Anselm remains representative. According to Harnack,\nAnselm\u2019s account depends on a\n\n\nmythological conception of God as the mighty private man, who is\nincensed at the injury done to His honor and does not forego His wrath\ntill He has received an at least adequately great equivalent. (1899:\n77)\n\n\nMore recently, feminist theologians and philosophers have criticized\nsatisfaction and penal substitution views for valorizing suffering\n(Brown and Parker 1989).\n\nEleonore Stump (2018) argues that typical satisfaction and penal\nsubstitution accounts cannot address the sinner\u2019s persistent\ndispositions toward wrongdoing and concomitant feelings of shame. She\ndubs her positive proposal the \u201cMarian\u201d interpretation of\natonement, and argues that it can explain how sinners are freed from\nshame and restored to fellowship with God. The proposal defies easy\nsummary but it advances an account of atonement as union with God that\nis further explained using second-personal, psychological notions like\n\u201cmind-reading\u201d and empathy (2018: 138\u2013139). Christ\non the cross mind-reads\u2014that is, psychically\nexperiences\u2014the mental states of every human sinner. Sinful\nhuman beings are thereby united to Christ, and so to God. When the\nindwelling Holy Spirit leads sinners to respond to Christ with love,\nthey also will what God wills. The resulting state of union with God\nalso heals the stain on the soul that is the sinner\u2019s shame.\n\nSeveral other models, also prominent in the Patristic and medieval\ntradition, have so far received little attention from analytic\nphilosophers of religion. These include \u201cransom\u201d theories\non which human beings are freed from Satan\u2019s grasp, and\nespecially \u201ctheosis\u201d or \u201cdivinization\u201d\naccounts of atonement and salvation, on which Christ\u2019s saving\nwork consists in perfecting human beings so that they become as divine\nas a creature can be. (Jacobs 2009 and Mosser 2021 are important\nexceptions). Similarly, few contemporary philosophers defend the\nmodern \u201cmoral exemplar\u201d model, on which Christ saves by\nbeing a perfect moral example for other human beings to imitate.\n(Quinn 1993 offers a highly qualified defense, but holds that Christ\nis more than just a moral exemplar).\n2.4 Sin, Original Sin, and the Fall\n\nThe doctrine of sin and the doctrine of atonement are correlative in\nthe same way that a disease and its remedy are correlative. If sin is\nthat from which Christ saves us, then the strength of the remedy\n(atonement) must vary according the severity of the disease (sin). As\na first approximation, a sinful act can be thought of as a morally bad\nact for which the sinner is responsible. But the language of\n\u201csin\u201d adds something to the language of moral wrongdoing:\na sin is a failure or fault with respect to God. Like other Christian\ndoctrines, the doctrine of sin poses tricky philosophical problems. To\nsee those problems more clearly, it is useful to disambiguate the\ndoctrine of sin into several distinct components: the first sin, the\nFall, original sin, and personal sin.\n\nFor extended discussion, see the entry\n sin in Christian thought.\n2.4.1 The First Sin\n\nThe problem of the first sin is the problem of how the very first\nsinful act is even possible, given various Christian axioms about the\ngoodness and creative power of God, and various philosophical\nassumptions about the nature of freedom and moral responsibility. The\nproblem of the first sin is sometimes treated as a question about the\nfall of Satan. It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to explain\nhow Satan\u2014by hypothesis, an angel created by God with a rational\nintellect, an upright will, and wholly good desires and\ndispositions\u2014could ever make the sinful choice to reject God.\nAugustine (City of God, Book 12), Anselm (\u201cOn the Fall\nof the Devil\u201d De casu diaboli), and Duns Scotus\n(Ordinatio 2, dist. 6, q. 2 ) all wrestle with this problem.\nContemporary philosophers who try to improve on their efforts include\nBarnwell (2009, 2017), MacDonald (1999), Rogers (2008), and Timpe\n(2012). Their responses all seek to explain how Satan\u2019s choice\nis metaphysically possible, by appealing to their own favored accounts\nof human freedom and conscious attention. Wood (2016) further\ndistinguishes between the \u201chard problem\u201d of how\nSatan\u2019s sinful choice is metaphysically possible, and the\n\u201charder problem\u201d of how it can be subjectively\nrational\u2014rational from the point of view of Satan himself.\n2.4.2 The Fall of Adam and Eve\n\nThe biblical story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) recounts the story of\nthe first human sin and its consequences. The traditional story of the\nfall of Adam and Eve does not seem consistent with either an\nevolutionary account of human origins or what we know about human\nhistory more generally. On some understandings, questions about the\nhistoricity of the Fall are not properly philosophical\nquestions at all. Yet it does seem like a properly philosophical task\nto articulate a doctrine of the fall that is both internally\nconsistent and consistent with other things we know to be true.\nMoreover, the doctrine of the Fall is conceptually connected to other\naspects of the doctrine of sin as well as to the doctrine of\nsalvation.\n\nPeter van Inwagen presents an account of the Fall that maintains many\nof its most important elements and, he claims, is consistent with\nevolutionary theory. Importantly, van Inwagen does not assert that\nthis account is true, but only \u201ctrue for all we know\u201d\n(2004). In a similar vein, Hud Hudson (2014) offers an ingenious\ndefense of a literal reading of the Genesis account that appeals to\ncontemporary \u201cgrowing block\u201d theories of time. Despite\ninitial impressions, neither van Inwagen nor Hudson are really\nconcerned with defending quasi-literal readings of Genesis. Instead,\nthey want to show that objections to those readings presuppose highly\ncontestable philosophical\u2014rather than empirical or\nscientific\u2014assumptions.\n2.4.3 Original Sin\n\nIn Christian theology, \u201coriginal sin\u201d in the strictest\nsense refers to the human condition after the Fall and not to the\nfirst human sin itself. The fall is the cause of the condition of\noriginal sin: because of Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, subsequent human\nbeings somehow \u201cinherit\u201d a disposition toward sin and an\nattraction toward evil that makes it inevitable that they will sin. On\nsome stronger interpretations, all subsequent human beings are also\njustly regarded as guilty by God from birth, even before they have\nsinned themselves. Even apart from worries about the historicity of\nthe fall, the philosophical challenges posed by this doctrine are\nobvious. How can people living now be morally responsible for the sins\nof the first human beings? What is the mechanism by which sin and\nguilt are \u201cinherited\u201d from past generations? If it is\ninevitable that all human beings will sin, can God justly punish\nthem?\n\nSome Christian philosophers have simply rejected the stronger versions\nof the doctrine of original sin as incoherent. Swinburne, for\ninstance, denies that all human beings are born guilty as a result of\nthe sin of their first parents and argues that the condition of\noriginal sin only makes it very likely, rather than inevitable, that\nthey will sin themselves (1989: 141\u201343). Other philosophers have\nattempted to show that even a strong doctrine of original sin can be\nphilosophically coherent, given the right metaphysical framework.\nMichael Rea, for instance, draws on fission theory and the metaphysics\nof temporal parts to suggest a way that contemporary humans might bear\nresponsibility for the sin of Adam by virtue of being counterparts or\nstages of Adam himself (2007). He also argues that a Molinist-inspired\ndoctrine of \u201ctransworld depravity\u201d might accomplish much\nof what Christians want from the traditional doctrine of original sin\n(2007). John Mullen (2007) also constructs a Molinist account of\noriginal sin and inherited guilt. On Molinism, God knows all the true\ncounterfactuals of creaturely freedom, which means that God knows\nevery free choice that every human being would make in every possible\nsituation. According to Mullen, if it were true that every free\ncreature would sin in an ideal, garden of Eden situation, then God\ncould justly punish them in the actual world for what they would have\ndone in that counterfactual world.\n2.4.4 Personal Sin\n\n\u201cPersonal sin\u201d refers to individual sinful acts. Because\nthe philosophical problems associated with personal sin initially seem\nvery similar to the problems associated with moral wrongdoing, there\nhas been comparatively little philosophical work on personal sin.\nStill, important definitional questions remain about exactly how, if\nat all, sin should be distinguished from moral wrongdoing, whether\nthere are sinful actions that are not immoral actions, and,\nconversely, whether there are immoral actions that are not sinful\n(Mitchell 1984; Dalferth 1984; Adams 1991; Couenhoven 2009).\n2.5 Other Topics\n\nThere are philosophical questions raised by nearly all Christian\ndoctrines and practices, and so there are many fertile areas of\ninquiry that still remain comparatively underexplored. This brief\nsurvey has focused on the most widely treated areas of analytic\nphilosophical theology. But some of the most creative work has\nbranched out into other domains including the Eucharist (Arcadi 2018;\nPickup 2015); liturgy, ritual, and worship (Cuneo 2016); bodily\nresurrection and personal identity (van Inwagen 1978; Merricks 1999;\nZimmerman 1999; Rudder Baker 2001); heaven (Walls 2002; Ribeiro 2011),\nhell (Walls 1992; Adams 1993; Kvanvig 1993; Sider 2002; Buckareff\n& Plug 2005) and purgatory (Walls 2011; Dumsday 2014).\n2.6 The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n\nIn 2009 Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea published their edited volume\nAnalytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology.\nThe volume\u2019s contributors collectively try to make the case that\nanalytic philosophy offers a valuable and neglected resource for\nChristian theologians. A new research program developed in its wake,\nand the ensuing years have seen the rise of a self-identified school\nof \u201canalytic theologians\u201d, who use the tools and methods\nof analytic philosophy to address Christian theological topics.\n\nAt present, it is not clear whether there is any meaningful difference\nbetween Christian \u201canalytic theology\u201d and Christian\n\u201cphilosophical theology\u201d, which has been treated as a kind\nof philosophy. As the discussion above indicates, analytic\nphilosophical theology has been produced largely by Christian\nphilosophers working in philosophy departments, rather than by\ntheologians in departments of theology or divinity schools. Classic\nworks of philosophical theology like Swinburne (1994) and Adams (2000)\nseem like analytic theology avant la lettre, for example, and\nmuch recent work called \u201canalytic theology\u201d seems quite\nsimilar to previous work called \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d\nor even \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d (e.g., Mullins 2016). Yet\nsome self-described analytic theologians have also insisted that\nChristian analytic theology is really a form of theology\n(Torrance [Alan] 2013; Torrance [Andrew] 2019; Crisp, Arcadi, &\nWessling 2019). They emphasize that Christian analytic theology is an\ninternal project of faith seeking understanding that, as theology,\nholds itself accountable to scripture and Church tradition. Yet\nwhether Christian analytic theology is properly regarded as a kind of\nphilosophy or a kind of theology depends on how we draw the underlying\ndistinction between philosophy and theology\u2014if indeed we draw\nsuch a distinction at all.\n3. Philosophy of Religion, Philosophical Theology, Christian Theology: Is There A Difference and Does it Matter?\n\nIt might seem odd that analytic philosophy of religion (APR) includes\nexplicitly Christian philosophical theology of the sort discussed in\n Section 2.\n Yet most philosophers of religion working in the analytic tradition\nare Christian theists (Bourget & Chalmers 2014; De Cruz 2017).\nThey avowedly want to explore their faith using analytic philosophical\ntools, and see no problem in calling their work Christian philosophy,\nphilosophical theology, or more recently, \u201canalytic\ntheology\u201d. Of course, philosophy of religion as such is broader\nthan APR, and APR is broader than Christian APR. There are\nphilosophers of religion whose work is analytic but not Christian\n(e.g., Lebens 2020; Mizrahi 2020; Steinhart 2020; Oppy 2018;\nSchellenberg 2018; Draper 2019), Christian but not analytic (e.g.,\nWestphal 2001; Pattison 2011), and neither analytic nor Christian\n(e.g., Hammerschlag 2016; Burley 2016). Even so, the predominance of\nChristian philosophical theology\u2014or \u201cPlantinga-style\nChristian philosophy\u201d (Schellenberg 2018)\u2014within APR has\nrecently reopened some contentious debates about the proper\nrelationship between philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nThese debates can be grouped around two different\u2014and\nopposing\u2014lines of criticism. According to the first line, much\nAPR is too Christian and too theological: not really philosophy at\nall, but a thinly-disguised form of Christian theology\u2014perhaps\neven a form of apologetics (Levine 2000; Knepper 2013: 9; Draper 2019:\n2). Conversely, according to the second line, advanced by prominent\ntheologians, APR is neither fully Christian nor fully theological. On\nthis line of criticism, APR does not really wrestle with the\ntranscendent God of Christian faith, but tends to construct and\nexamine its own false \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d (Milbank\n2009; Hart 2013; Oliver 2010; see also Harris & Insole 2005, 17).\nAlthough mutually opposing, both lines of criticism raise an important\nmethodological question: how\u2014if at all\u2014should we\ndistinguish philosophy about Christian topics from Christian theology?\n Section 1\n (above) surveyed important responses to this question in the history\nof Christian thought. This section addresses the question in the\ncontext of contemporary challenges to analytic philosophy of\nreligion.\n3.1 Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Too Theological?\n\nThe charge that APR is \u201ctoo theological\u201d can be\ndisambiguated into two distinct worries. The first worry concerns the\nscope of APR when considered as a whole: APR is too narrow,\nbecause it focuses excessively on Christian theological topics, to the\nexclusion of other equally important matters. The second worry\nconcerns the sources and methods of Christian APR\nspecifically: the sources and methods of Christian APR belong more\nproperly to theology than to philosophy.\n3.1.1 Narrowness of Scope?\n\nThe charge that APR as a discipline is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d or\n\u201ctoo theological\u201d could be understood as a worry about its\nscope: perhaps APR focuses too much on Christian theological topics,\nor at least on versions of monotheism that are compatible with\nChristianity, and is therefore too narrow in scope. Critics who\nadvance the narrowness worry include Trakakis 2008, Wildman 2010,\nKnepper 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Lewis 2015, Jones 2019, Draper 2019,\nTimpe & Hereth 2019, Mizrahi 2020. Although the narrowness worry\nhas wide currency, it is not always clear how to understand it as a\nproperly philosophical criticism. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that the narrowness worry is more often aimed at the field of APR\nas a whole, rather than at individual instances of APR. After all, the\ngeneral claim that APR is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d does not entail\nthat any specific argument of any specific philosopher is unsound.\nSimilarly, even if it is true that APR as a whole should be\n\u201cless Christian\u201d, it is hard to see why that fact would\nrequire any individual philosopher to change her research and teaching\nfocus (Schilbrack 2014: 12).\n\nStill, some versions of the narrowness worry are more philosophical\nthan others. According to more philosophical versions, Christian APR\nfrequently fails as philosophy: as a result of their\nChristian-theological biases, analytic philosophers of religion\ninadvertently make bad arguments. On this line, Christian analytic\nphilosophers are especially likely to engage in motivated reasoning\nand ignore counter-arguments or alternative points of view drawn from\nother religious traditions. Because APR is so narrow, Christian\nphilosophers unwittingly work in an echo-chamber or an epistemic\nbubble (Schilbrack 2014: 14; Draper 2019: 5; De Cruz 2020). As a\nresult, according to critics, the conclusions of their putatively\nphilosophical arguments are often unwarranted for anyone outside the\nChristian community, even when they purport to be generally\nprobative.\n\nLess philosophical versions of the narrowness worry assert the general\nprinciple that APR should be more capacious, and should include more\nnon-Christian voices, without explicitly challenging the soundness of\nspecific analytic arguments (Knepper 2013; Carroll 2016; Mizrahi\n2020). Here the worry is simply that APR does not\u2014but\nshould\u2014reflect the diversity of religious and non-religious\nviewpoints that actually obtain in the world. Phrased differently, APR\nas a field wrongly excludes too much good philosophical work that just\nhappens not to fit into the dominant Christian, monotheistic paradigm.\nYet one can hold this view without also agreeing that existing APR\nfails on its own terms or that any specific philosophers should alter\ntheir practices.\n3.1.2 Inappropriate Methods?\n\nThe charge that APR is too theological could also be understood as a\nquestion about philosophical methodology. On this version of the\ncharge, Christian APR does not begin from generally accessible\nassumptions and argue toward generally acceptable conclusions, as good\nphilosophy should. Instead, it typically begins from Christian\nassumptions and argues toward Christian conclusions, like\ntheology.\n\nJ.L. Schellenberg, for example, argues that philosophy must seek\nsolutions to philosophical problems that are in principle\n\u201cshareable\u201d by any member of the philosophical community.\nBecause much Christian APR assumes the truth of Christianity, its\nsolutions cannot satisfy this condition, and should properly count as\ntheology rather than philosophy (Schellenberg 2018). J. Aaron Simmons\nagrees: even though theology \u201ccan and should\u201d appeal to\nevidence restricted to \u201cdeterminate communities defined by\nrevelational authorities\u201d, philosophy should appeal to\n\u201cevidence that is, in principle, accessible by all members of\nthe philosophical community\u201d (2019: 147). According to Simmons,\nthe dominant strand of APR has ignored this criterion, and threatens\nto \u201cbecome simply a subset of Christian theological\npractice\u201d (2019: 149; see also Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2).\n3.1.3 Responses to the Worry that APR is \u201cToo Theological\u201d\n\nAnalytic philosophers of religion have a variety of ways to respond to\nthe charge that APR is too theological. First, with respect to the\nnarrowness charge, they can accuse critics of mistaking the part for\nthe whole, by denying that the charge applies to APR as such, and by\npointing to those analytic philosophers of religion who neither assume\nnor defend the truth of Christianity. Yet this response is undercut by\nthe fact that non-Christian practitioners of APR often make the\nnarrowness themselves (Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019).\nSecond, its defenders also emphasize that much Christian APR does not\nactually assume the truth of Christianity at all, but instead\nargues for that truth. (Hasker 2018a: 90; citing Swinburne is\na paradigmatic example). This kind of philosophy would clear even\nSchellenberg\u2019s \u201cshareable in principle\u201d bar.\nSimilarly, even those philosophical projects that eschew\nSwinburne-style natural theology might still clear the \u201csharable\nin principle\u201d bar so long as they engage only in defensive\nmaneuvers\u2014for example, by answering philosophical objections to\nthe plausibility of Christian claims (e.g., van Inwagen 1995; Pawl\n2014).\n\nOthers argue that even explicit appeals to Christian revelation could\nin principle still count as philosophical appeals, albeit indirectly.\nSuppose we agree that theology can appeal to revelation, while\nphilosophy trades only in \u201cgenerally accessible\u201d\narguments. We still must distinguish between direct, first-order\nappeals to revelation, and indirect, second-order arguments that it is\nsometimes permissible to appeal to revelation (Wood 2021:\n213\u2013215). The second-order arguments could still be generally\naccessible philosophical arguments, even though the first-order\nappeals are not. For example, a first-order \u201ctheological\u201d\nappeal might be: \u201cThe New Testament asserts p;\ntherefore p\u201d. But a philosopher might offer a general\nepistemological argument, accessible to anyone in the philosophical\ncommunity, to defend the rationality of that same first-order appeal.\n(For example, she might offer a general argument that it is rational\nto form beliefs based on testimony, and the same general argument\nmight establish that it is rational to treat the New Testament as\ntestimonial evidence.) In a similar vein, Plantinga\u2019s claim that\nbelief in God may be \u201cproperly basic\u201d is not itself\npresented as a Christian assumption or a revealed truth, but as a\nspecific application of his general philosophical theory of warrant,\nwhich he has defended at length (1983, 1993a, 1993b).\n\nFinally, because there is no single uncontested way to understand the\nboundaries between philosophy and theology, it is open to Christian\nphilosophers of religion simply to deny the sharp distinction\npresupposed by critics like Schellenberg and Simmons (see, for\nexample, Plantinga 1984, Wolterstorff 2009). In so doing, they would\nimplicitly endorse a more Patristic \u201cIntegration\u201d model\ninstead of either the Medieval \u201cCooperation\u201d model or the\nmodern \u201cDisjunction\u201d model (see\n Section 2\n above).\n3.2 Or Not Theological Enough? Theological Critiques of Analytic Philosophy of Religion\n\nWhile one set of critics accuse APR of becoming too theological,\nanother set takes the opposite line. According to several prominent\ntheologians and philosophers, something about the analytic style of\nphilosophizing makes APR particularly unsuitable for investigating\nChristian doctrines. On this line of criticism, far from becoming a\nspecies of Christian theology, APR is constitutively opposed to\nChristian theology, and the problem with analytic philosophical\ntheology is not that it is too theological but that it is too\nanalytic. This criticism takes several forms.\n\nSometimes, theological objections to APR simply reiterate Barthian\nobjections to natural theology, presumably on the assumption that most\nAPR is really a form of natural theology (Moore 2007). Other critics\ncharge analytic philosophers of religion with historical anachronism\nand ignorance of the Christian tradition. Perhaps\n\u201ca-historical\u201d analytic philosophers of religion do not\nunderstand pre-modern ways of thinking and reading (so runs the\ncharge), and so they wrongly believe that their own constructive work\nis congruent with the historic Christian tradition, when it in fact\ndepends modern assumptions that are inimical to the Christian\ntradition (Hart 2013: 123, 129; Milbank 2009: 320). Other critics\npress the related worry that APR ignores the real Christian tradition\naltogether in favor of theorizing its own abstract, self-constructed\nversion of the Christian god. Here APR\n\n\ndoes not deal with the God of any tradition or encounter, but with a\nconceptual construct, a simulacrum or \u2018the God of the\nphilosophers\u2019\u2026. (Oliver 2010: 467\u2013468; see also\nHyman 2010)\n\n\nAnother multi-faceted line of theological criticism criticizes APR for\n\u201cidolatry\u201d, \u201cunivocity\u201d, and\n\u201contotheology\u201d. This line reflects the general worry that\nAPR does not take divine mystery or transcendence seriously enough.\n\u201cOntotheology\u201d is a theological term of opprobrium that,\nin its current usage, derives from Heidegger (1957; see also Marion\n1982 [1995]). It means, roughly, treating God like \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or \u201ca thing in the world\u201d. According to its\ntheological critics, APR constitutively assumes that God is a possible\nobject of human knowledge, even apart from revelation, and therefore\ntreats God as fundamentally similar to any other object \u201cout\nthere\u201d passively waiting to be discovered. Yet a God like this\n(so runs the worry) is not really God at all, but something\nelse\u2014an idol.\n\nThe worry about ontotheology and idolatry is also a worry about\nunivocity\u2014the view that our terms bear the same meaning when\napplied to God and creatures (Trakakis 2010). According to opponents\nof theological univocity, precisely because God is not \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or a \u201cthing in the world\u201d, God and creatures\ndiffer absolutely; they share no properties and so cannot be described\nby univocal predications. (So, e.g., the word \u201cgood\u201d\ncannot have the same meaning in the statements \u201cGod is\ngood\u201d, and \u201cSocrates is good\u201d.) Worries about\ntheological predication and univocity date back to the Patristic\nperiod, but in contemporary philosophy of religion, they are best\nunderstood as continuations of the late medieval disputes between\nfollowers of Duns Scotus, who defends univocal predication, and his\nThomist opponents (T. Williams 2005; Burrell 2008; Cross 2008). As a\ngeneralization, most contemporary analytic philosophers of religion\nendorse a univocal account of theological language, whereas\ncontemporary Christian theologians are more likely to deny univocity\nin favor of analogical or metaphorical predication, or even\nnon-predicative forms of theological language (Pickstock 2005; Marion\n1999).\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp rhetoric, there has been very little direct\nengagement between analytic philosophers of religion and their\ntheological opponents on these questions. T. Williams (2005), Cross\n(2008) defend univocal predication, and Adams (2014) tries to\nrehabilitate ontotheology. Other analytic thinkers offer their own\npositive accounts of divine transcendence (Crisp and Rea [eds.] 2009:\n9\u201311; Rea 2015, 2020; Jacobs 2015). More generally, analytic\nphilosophers and theologians have a variety of strategies for avoiding\nthe deleterious consequences of univocity and ontotheology (Wood 2021:\n130\u201374). \n",
