Control and Reintegration\n\nSections\n 2\n and\n 3\n described how the original genotype-phenotype distinction was\noperationalized under special, controlled conditions, namely, the\ngrowing and crossing of inbred lines raised under uniform conditions.\n Section 4\n laid out pathways from the experimentally based distinction:\nreintegrate, engineer, generalize theoretically, liken, and experiment\nmore. Yet biology and philosophy of biology have not emphasized the\nneed to reintegrate what has been abstracted away as a necessary step\nif the genotype-conception of heredity is to be extended beyond those\nspecial conditions (Figures\n 2\n and\n 3)\n and applied to the study of heredity for natural varying populations\n (Figure 1).\n Therefore, to highlight the implications of basing the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction in controlled conditions, this section\nconsiders what control and possible reintegration might entail in the\ndifferent realms reviewed so far.\n",
