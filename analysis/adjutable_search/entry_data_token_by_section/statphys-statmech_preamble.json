    "main_text": "\n\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following new entry by Roman Frigg and Charlotte Werndl replaces the\n former entry\non this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\nStatistical Mechanics is the third pillar of modern physics, next to\nquantum theory and relativity theory. Its aim is to account for the\nmacroscopic behaviour of physical systems in terms of dynamical laws\ngoverning the microscopic constituents of these systems and\nprobabilistic assumptions. Like other theories in physics, statistical\nmechanics raises a number of foundational and philosophical issues.\nBut philosophical discussions in statistical mechanics face an\nimmediate difficulty because unlike other theories, statistical\nmechanics has not yet found a generally accepted theoretical framework\nor a canonical formalism. In this entry we introduce the different\ntheoretical approaches to statistical mechanics and the philosophical\nquestion that attach to them.\n",
