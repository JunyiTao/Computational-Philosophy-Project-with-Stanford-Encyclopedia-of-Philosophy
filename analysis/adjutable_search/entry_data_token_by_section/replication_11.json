    "main_text": "Challenges to the Replicator || Origins of Replicators\n5.3 Origins of Replicators\n\nAnother challenge to the replicator/interactor approach to evolution\nby natural selection is to see replicators themselves as a\nproduct of natural selection rather than as a necessary\nstarting point. One premise of this argument is that some form of\nnatural selection must have occurred on entities that initially were\nnot replicating, perhaps not even reproducing. This is recognized by\nDawkins, who notes in passing in the second chapter of The Selfish\nGene that \u201cDarwin\u2019s \u2018survival of the\nfittest\u2019 is really a special case of a more general law of\nsurvival of the stable\u201d (Dawkins 1976: 13) and that life\noriginated from selection of molecules for stability.\n\n\n\n\n(a) Population in which there is no replication and a low heritability\n(\\(h^2\\)), yet evolution by natural selection occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Population in which there is no replication, yet heritability is\n1. Evolution by natural selection occurs.\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication.\n\n\nThe idea that selection can occur without there being replicators was\nfirst introduced as \u201cchemical selection\u201d in line with the\nviews of Oparin, who proposed that coacervates (colloidal droplets)\ncould encapsulate protobiological chemicals and self-replicate without\ngenes through mechanical fission, a view also independently proposed\nby Haldane (Oparin 1936 [1938]; Haldane 1929; see Kolb 2016).\nThis was later extended by the work of Sidney Fox, who showed that\nproteinoid spheres could mechanically reproduce stably (Hsu & Fox\n1976).\n\nIf modern biological systems evolved from molecules that did not have\nthe ability to reproduce, let alone replicate, one might ask: what is\nthe simplest case of evolution by natural selection? It is a case in\nwhich different types of entities have different persistences but do\nnot produce any offspring. In this model, the types with the property\nof persisting longer represent an increasing frequency of the total\npopulation over time. One problem, though in a model of persistence\nalone, is that each time one entity goes out of existence, it is not\nreplaced by another entity; thus, over time, the population size tends\ntowards zero. Although this does not mean that evolution by natural\nselection cannot occur in such populations, this places important\nconstraints on the evolutionary dynamics of this population (Van Valen\n1989). Further, it is possible to regard the ability for a population\nto maintain its size or increase its size as a primordial form of\nadaptation. This idea casts some doubt on the view that paradigmatic\ncases of evolution by natural selection require a\npopulation of entities that reproduce, a view championed by\nGodfrey-Smith (2009). Several authors, following in Van Valen\u2019s\nfootsteps, have recently argued that important cases of evolution\nby natural selection must involve reproduction, and that differential\npersistence with or without differential growth can be sufficient\n(Bouchard 2008, 2011; Bourrat, 2014; Charbonneau 2014;\nDoolittle 2014; Doolittle and Inkpen 2018; for a review, see\nPapale 2021). Nonetheless, assuming a metapopulation, it is clear\nthat populations with the ability to maintain or increase their size\nwould out-compete those that are unable to do so. Thus, the ability\nfor a population to sustain its population size might be regarded as a\nprimordial form of adaptation without which other adaptations would be\nalmost impossible to evolve.\n\nA next \u201cstage\u201d in the evolution from primordial\nentities unable to reproduce to modern biological systems might thus\nhave been for entities to produce new offspring entities (or multiply)\nwithout the ability to pass on their properties reliably. In such a\nsituation, the size of a population could be maintained. The most\nextreme form of that would be to imagine a population of two types in\nwhich each type has the same probability to produce an offspring of\nthe other types as its own type. With entities of the two types having\ndifferent persistence, a modest form of evolution by natural selection\nis still possible. Versions of this model have been proposed by\nWilkins, Stanyon, and Musgrave (2012), Earnshaw-Whyte (2012), and\nBourrat (2015a). Since there is, on average, no more resemblance\nbetween an offspring and its parent than any other entity of the\nparental generation, and evolution by natural selection is still\nobserved in such a scenario, one might think that heritability is,\nstrictly speaking, not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nWilkins et al. (2012) argue that, over time, in a reactor with limited\nincoming chemical species, hypercycles (as defined by Eigen et al.\n1991) of reactions will tend to include reaction types that are more\nstable and capture more source molecules and energy than variant\nreaction types, leading to the evolution by natural selection of\nreplicator-like molecules as well as energetically efficient\n\u201cmetabolic\u201d molecules. Recent work in biochemistry has\nadded strength to that suggestion (Altstein 2015). Hence, given that\nno replicator is required for selection (in this case, chemical),\nreplicator molecules can be seen as the outcome of selective\nevolution, not a necessary prior condition for it. In effect, the\nevolution of replicators is the first major transition of evolution,\ndespite the view of Szathm\u00e1ry and Maynard Smith that\nreplicators needed to come first (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry\n1995; Szathm\u00e1ry & Maynard Smith 1997). Bourrat\n(2014) further developed this idea into a series of agent-based\nmodels. He showed that replication is an attractor in populations\nlacking heritability once small random mutations increasing or\ndecreasing the fidelity of character inheritance are introduced.\n",
