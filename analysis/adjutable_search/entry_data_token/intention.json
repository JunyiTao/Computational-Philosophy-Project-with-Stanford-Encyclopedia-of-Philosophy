As Elizabeth Anscombe wrote in a similar\ncontext, \u2018it is implausible to say that the word is equivocal as\nit occurs in these different cases\u2019 and from the fact that\n\u2018we are tempted to speak of \u201cdifferent senses\u201d of a\nword which is clearly not equivocal, we may infer that we are pretty\nmuch in the dark about the character of the concept which it\nrepresents\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 1).\n\nThe principal task of the philosophy of intention is to uncover and\ndescribe the unity of these three forms. This project matters for\nquestions in the philosophy of mind, but also for ethics, where it is\ninvolved in the doctrine of double effect, for epistemology, and most\nobviously, for the nature of practical reason.\n\nWe can classify theories of intention roughly but usefully on two\naxes. First, how do they find unity in the guises of intention? Do\nthey explain one in terms of another? Which, if any, do they treat as\nprimary? There is a deep opposition here between accounts that take\nintention to be a mental state in terms of which we can explain\nintentional action, and those that do not. Second, how do they\nunderstand the relation between intention and evaluative thought,\nwhich bears on the possibility of akrasia, and the relation\nbetween intention and belief, which bears on the nature and scope of\nself-knowledge?

Intending as Doing\n\nIn \u2018Actions, Reasons and Causes,\u2019 Donald Davidson gave a\nreductive theory of \u2018intention with which\u2019 as\n\u2018syncategorematic\u2019: the phrase does not refer to an event\nor state of the agent, but is a way of redescribing what she is doing\nin terms of a \u2018primary reason,\u2019 where this is understood\nas a pro-attitude towards actions having some feature, F,\nalong with the belief that the original action has that feature\n(Davidson 1963, pp. 5\u20138). It is in virtue of its relation to a\nprimary reason that the action counts as intentional, and this reason\ngives the intention with which the action is done. Davidson thereby\nunified, or took himself to have unified, intentional action and\nintention-with-which.\n\nAs he came to see, however, this story neglects and cannot easily\nincorporate prospective intention or intention for the future\n(Davidson 1978). There are apparent cases of \u2018pure\nintending\u2019 in which no steps of any kind are taken. Suppose that\nI intend to write a book review but have yet to open the book. On the\nface of it, such pure intending cannot be reduced to intentional\naction. What is more, once we recognize the existence of pure\nintending, \u2018there is no reason not to allow that intention of\nexactly the same kind is also present when the intended action\neventuates\u2019 (Davidson 1978, p. 89). If what I am doing\nintentionally takes time, as almost everything does, there will be\nearly phases in which I stand to the completion of the deed as I stand\nto future actions I intend to perform but have yet to begin.\n\nThe majority of work since Davidson\u2019s conversion has followed\nhim in acknowledging the state of prospective intention as irreducible\nto action, and has been led to seek unity in the forms of intention by\nexplaining the others\u2014intentional action and\nintention-with-which\u2014in terms of intending as a mental state.\nRecently, however, philosophers inspired by Anscombe\u2019s\nIntention have offered resistance to this move. Anscombe\ndenies that there is a sharp distinction between \u2018I am doing\nA\u2019 and \u2018I am going to do A\u2019\noffered as answers to the question \u2018Why are you doing\nB?\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, pp. 39\u201340). Nor does she\nregard intention for the future as needing further explanation once\nintentional action and intention-with-which have been understood\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 90\u20134). Thus, Anscombe appears to solve the\nproblem of unity without acknowledging intention as a mental\nstate.\n\nThe simplest version of this approach would emphasize the\n\u2018openness\u2019 of the progressive, that \u2018He is doing\nA\u2019 does not imply that he will succeed in doing\nA, or that he has or will get very far with it. (That I am\ncrossing the road is consistent with being hit by a car the moment I\nstep off the curb.) It then identifies the fact that S\nintends to do A with the fact that S is doing\nA intentionally, though perhaps he has barely begun. If I\nintend to visit the zoo next Thursday, I am already on the way to\ndoing so. Here it is striking that we sometimes employ the present\nprogressive in anticipation: \u2018Kieran is visiting the zoo next\nThursday\u2019 sounds perfectly fine when said today, before I have\ntaken any overt steps (see Falvey 2000 pp. 25\u20136; Thompson 2008,\npp. 140\u20131; Moran and Stone 2009, pp. 145\u20136).\n\nA more subtle line would concede that we do not always use the\nprogressive quite so liberally, but insist that doing so carves nature\nat its joints. According to Michael Thompson (2008, pp. 91\u20132,\n133\u201346), intending to do A is not a mental state\nbecause it is not static; instead it is a form of imperfectivity or\nbeing in progress towards the intentional completion of an act, where\nthe progress may be so vestigial or ineffectual or interrupted that it\nwould be odd to remark, \u2018He is doing A.\u2019 (See\nThompson 2008, pp. 91\u20132, 133\u201345; Moran and Stone 2009, pp.\n146\u20138; Ferrero 2017; Russell 2018.) The unity of prospective\nintention and \u2018doing A intentionally\u2019 is that the\nlatter, too, consists of being in progress, though perhaps with the\nimplication of some success.\n\nAlong with this unity, and the hint supplied by the use of the\nprogressive in anticipation, there are two main arguments for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action. First, it\nreadily explains why intending is always intending to do\nsomething. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008, pp. 120\u20133,\n127\u20138, 130\u20131, drawing on Baier 1970; Moran and Stone 2009,\npp. 143, 147.) Although we sometimes report intention as a\npropositional attitude\u2014\u2018I intend that\np\u2019\u2014such reports can be recast as \u2018intending\nto\u2026\u2019 as when I intend to bring about that p. By\ncontrast, it is difficult to rephrase such mundane expressions as\n\u2018I intend to go home\u2019 in propositional terms. \u2018I\nintend that I am (will be) going home\u2019 suggests indifference to\ngetting there. \u2018I intend that I (will) have got home\u2019\nsuggests indifference to my own agency. \u2018I intend that I go\nhome\u2019 can only be read as an intention with a habitual object,\ndescribing a general practice of going home; it is not directed at a\nparticular action. If intending is being on the way to intentional\naction, it is no surprise that its proper object\u2014what one is on\nthe way to doing\u2014is not a proposition or state of affairs, but\nsomething one might do.\n\nSecond, the theory of intending as being embarked on intentional\naction explains the unity of what Thompson calls\n\u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and \u2018sophisticated\u2019\nrationalization. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008, pp.\n97\u20139, 118\u20139, 132\u20134.) As well as explaining action by\nintention\u2014\u2018He is doing A because he intends to do\nB\u2019\u2014we explain action by action\u2014\u2018He is\ndoing A because he is doing B\u2019\u2014intention\nby intention\u2014\u2018He intends to do A because he\nintends to do B\u2019\u2014and intention by\naction\u2014\u2018He intends to do A because he is doing\nB.\u2019 On the face of it, moreover,\n\u2018na\u00efve\u2019 explanations in terms of what someone is\ndoing entail \u2018sophisticated\u2019 explanations that appeal to\nintention. At least when we are using the \u2018because\u2019 of\nrationalization, \u2018He is doing A because he is doing\nB\u2019 arguably entails \u2018He is doing A\nbecause he intends to do B.\u2019 The same point holds for\nwhat is explained: \u2018He is doing A\nbecause\u2026\u2019 entails \u2018He intends to do A\nbecause\u2026\u2019 If intending is being on the way to intentional\naction, these are all forms of explanation by, and of, such progress.\nSo, again, it is no surprise that they are bound together in just the\nway that they appear to be.\n\nIf we help ourselves to the \u2018because\u2019 of rationalization,\nwe can further exploit the unity of its \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and\n\u2018sophisticated\u2019 forms to give a simple theory of\nintention-with-which. An intention with which one is doing A\nis an intentional-action-in-progress that explains one\u2019s doing\nit. We thus complete the task of unification that was set by the\nthreefold division of intention for the future, intention-with-which,\nand intentional action, all of which are modes of, or modes of\nexplanation by, being embarked on intentional action.\n\nA final virtue of this account is that it captures the element of\ncommitment in intention, emphasized by Michael Bratman, among others\n(Bratman 1987, pp. 18\u201320). Intention is not merely predominant\ndesire. When I decide to do something, and so intend to do it, I am\nembarked upon doing it. This vindicates the Aristotelian view that\naction itself is the conclusion of practical thought.\n\nBecause of its relatively recent recovery, and the prevalent\nacceptance of intention as a mental state, there has been little\nexamination of the present alternative. But some observations can be\nmade. First, it is in fact controversial that intending to do\nA is necessary for doing A intentionally, as the\npresent theory predicts. This raises complications best considered\nlater on, in sections 2 and 4. (They are briefly discussed at Thompson\n2008, pp. 102\u20133.)\n\nSecond, and more obviously, there is room to doubt whether intending\nto do A is sufficient for me to count as doing it\nintentionally, even when we admit that I can be doing what I will\nnever successfully do. Isn\u2019t there a distinction between taking\npreparatory steps towards doing A and beginning to do it, as\nin the contrast between buying flour and eggs with the intention of\nbaking, and turning on the oven the following week? This distinction\nmay be significant in ethics and the criminal law (Paul 2014a). There\nis also the prospect of plans that require no preparatory steps, as\nfor instance, to blink tomorrow at 3:00pm. Isn\u2019t some intending\nutterly pure, as Davidson thought? Once we move away from the simple\ntheory of intending as doing, however, and introduce the abstract\nnotion of imperfectivity or being in progress, it is more difficult to\nsay what such examples show. That the theory is false? Or just how\nliminal being in progress can be?\n\nMore telling, perhaps, is the possibility of making a mistake, as when\nI intend to walk home by the shortest possible route, but have taken a\nwrong turn. Do I count as being embarked on walking home by the\nshortest route? If not, the theory stands refuted. If so, I can be on\nthe way not only to doing something I will never do because I will be\ninterrupted, but something it is now impossible for me to do. Can we\nexplain how my doings are directed at that impossible outcome except\nby appeal to the intention with which they are performed?\n\nThe arguments that motivate the theory of intending as being embarked\non intentional action are in any case inconclusive. As to the second,\nwhile it is a constraint on any theory of intention to show the unity\nof \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and \u2018sophisticated\u2019\nrationalization, insofar as they are really unified, it would take\nmuch further argument to show that this cannot be done while thinking\nof intention as a mental state (cf. Setiya 2007a, pp. 51\u20132).\nFurther demands for unity push towards that view. So, for instance, if\nwe hope to bring out what is common to the explanations \u2018He is\ndoing A because he is doing B\u2019 and \u2018He\nis doing A because p\u2019 where these entail,\nrespectively, \u2018He is doing A because he intends to do\nB\u2019 and \u2018He is doing A because he\nbelieves that p,\u2019 we will have to relate intention to\nthe mental state of belief. If intention is not itself a mental state,\nbut a way of being in progress, such relations are more puzzling. They\nare taken up again in section 5.\n\nAs to the first, those who think of intention as a mental state could\nexplain why its objects are restricted to actions by saying more about\nthe kind of state it is. For instance, if intention is a\nrepresentation that is such as to guide and control what it\nrepresents, its object must be as such as to be guided: it must be the\nsort of thing that can be in progress and move towards completion,\nsomething that can be done, not a mere proposition or state of\naffairs. Alternatively, the restriction could be denied (as it is by\nDavis 1984, pp. 131\u20132; Ferrero 2013). Intending that p\nis fundamental, and intending to go home can be explained in terms of\nit: I intend that I will get home by going home.\n\nFinally, whatever view we take about the basic objects of\nintention\u2014actions or propositions\u2014it is a problem for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action that these\nobjects can be logically complex. I intend not to be hit by a car as I\nwalk home. I intend to drink with dinner or have dessert, but not\nboth. I intend to read a book tonight if there\u2019s nothing on the\nradio. In none of these cases can we say, without contrivance, what\naction I am now on the way to performing. Until it is supplied with an\naccount of these cases, and of the relation between intention and the\nmental states with which it interacts, the theory of intending as\nbeing embarked on intentional action remains incomplete.\n2. Intention in Action\n\nIf prospective intention cannot be explained in terms of intentional\naction, or both in terms of being in progress, how can we preserve the\nunity of our three divisions? In particular, how does intentional\naction relate to prospective intention and intention-with-which? There\nare two obvious thoughts. The first is that doing A\nintentionally is doing it with some further intention, or doing\nsomething with the intention of thereby doing A. The second\nis that both phenomena are to be explained in terms of intention as a\nmental state. Let us take these possibilities in turn.\n\nThe idea of explaining intentional action through intention-with-which\nis associated with resistance to causal accounts of acting for a\nreason. It begins instead with intentional teleology\u2014doing\nA in order to do B, or with the intention of doing\nB\u2014treating this as primitive and not involving\nintention as efficient cause. If we assume that every intentional\naction is done for a reason, and that this reason can be cast in\nteleological form, we can identify doing A intentionally with\ndoing A in order to do something else. We thereby unify two\nguises of intention.\n\nDifficulties arise, however, from the case of idle behaviour, in which\nI am doing A intentionally for no particular reason (Anscombe\n1963, p. 25), and from the possibility\u2014or necessity\u2014that\nteleological series come to an end. I am doing A in order to\ndo B in order to do C \u2026 in order to do\nZ, which I am doing for its own sake. Not all intentional\nactions are performed with a further end. The purported unity fades.\nIn order to solve this problem while leaving room for basic\nintentional actions, not performed by intentionally taking further\nmeans, George Wilson (1989) and Carl Ginet (1990, Ch. 6) appeal to\nintention de re. One need not intend one\u2019s doing\nA to promote some further end in order to count as doing\nA intentionally. It is sufficient to intend, of something one\nis doing, that it promote or constitute one\u2019s doing\nA.\n\nThis way of putting things prompts the objection that merely having\nthat intention is not enough. If the intention is idle or ineffective,\none will not, despite one\u2019s wishes, count as doing A\nintentionally, or as acting in order to do A (Mele 1992, pp.\n248\u201355). We need to add a causal relation, after all. But this\nobjection misconstrues the teleological view. It is not that the mere\npresence of a mental state\u2014intending of \u2026 that it\n\u2026\u2014constitutes acting with an intention, or acting\nintentionally, but that intention-with-which is a basic form of\nteleology, distinct from causation by a mental state, out of which we\ncan construct the unity of intention.\n\nA deeper problem for the teleological approach is how to complete this\nconstruction with an account of prospective intention in terms of\nintention-with-which. In cases of pure intending, there is no\nintention with which I am doing anything yet. It is thus no accident\nthat Wilson (1989, pp. 222\u201330) is led to deny the possibility of\npure intention. When I intend to do A in the future, I am\ndoing something now with the intention of doing A, in that I\nintend, of what I am doing, that it promote or constitute my doing\nA. The action in question may be as minimal as keeping track\nof opportunities for doing A, or biding my time.\n\nFinally, the teleological theorist must account for the connection\nbetween intentions with which one acts and psychological states of\nbelief and desire. Why does it follow from the fact that one intends,\nof what one is doing, that it promote or constitute one\u2019s doing\nA that one wants to do A and that one believes, of\nwhat one is doing, that it is a means to that end? These implications\nmake sense if intention is a species of desire that interacts with\nmeans-end belief when one does A with the intention of doing\nB. They are more difficult to explain if intention-with-which\nis the basic material from which intention and intentional action are\nbuilt. (This argument is developed at greater length in Setiya 2011,\npp. 146\u20139.)\n\nPressures of this kind push us towards the second approach, now\northodox in action theory, which aims to explain both intentional\naction and intention-with-which in terms of intention as a mental\nstate. According to the simplest possible view, an intentional action\nof doing A is the execution of a prior intention to do\nA, and doing A with the intention of doing\nB is intending, of one\u2019s doing A, that it\npromote or constitute one\u2019s doing B.\n\nA note of caution is essential here: it is important to distinguish\nthe more modest project of explaining what it is to act intentionally\nin terms of intending and doing from the more ambitious project of\nexplaining what it is for S to act intentionally in terms of\ngoings-on of which S is not the agent. The latter project is implied\nby Wittgenstein\u2019s notorious arithmetic: \u201cWhat is left over\nwhen I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I\nraise my arm?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a7621). Some philosophers\nattempt to answer this question, explaining what it is to do\nA intentionally without appeal to doing A. But one\nneed not share that aim in giving an account of intentional action in\nterms of intention as a mental state: one can take for granted that I\nam raising my arm, for instance, and ask what more is involved in\nraising my arm intentionally (Setiya 2011, \u00a72; Setiya 2016b, pp.\n3\u20139).\n\nEven the more modest project runs into difficulties. First, although\nwe sometimes form an intention prior to acting, this is not essential.\nI can wave my arm intentionally without planning in advance. This fact\nelicits a refinement often credited to Searle (1983, pp. 84\u20135):\nthe distinction between prospective intention and intention in action.\nIn the former case, one intends to do A, perhaps at some\npoint in the future. In the latter, one intends to be doing it now.\nWhen S is doing A intentionally, she is doing it in\nexecution of an intention in action, though except in very unusual\ncases she also intends to do A: to complete the action she is\nin the midst of performing.\n\nThis refinement preserves the idea that doing A intentionally\nrequires an intention whose object is doing A. This is what\nBratman (1987, p. 112) has dubbed \u2018the Simple View.\u2019 It is\nopen to serious objections, the more subtle of which will be examined\nin section 4. For now, it is sufficient to note that I sometimes count\nas doing A intentionally when it is a merely foreseen and\nunintended consequence of what I intend to do. (See Harman 1976, pp.\n151\u20132; Bratman 1987, pp. 123\u20135.) Thus if I am paid to pump\nwater into the cistern of a house, and I continue to do so even when I\nrealize that the water is poisoned, I poison the inhabitants of the\nhouse intentionally, despite the fact that I did not intend or desire\nsuch harm (cf. Anscombe 1963, pp. 41\u20132). Even here, however, an\nintention is executed: I intend to pump water into the house. In\ngeneral, when it is not the execution of a directly corresponding\nintention, doing A intentionally is a foreseen or desired\nconsequence of an action that is. Admittedly, this condition is\nnecessary, not sufficient, for intentional action, a concept whose\nvagaries are hard to map. But the execution of intention remains the\ncore phenomenon from which all instances of intentional action are\nderived.\n\nAlong with such matters of detail, two problems of principle can be\nraised against the present approach. The first contends that it is\ntacitly circular, because the content of intention always includes the\nconcept of intentionality (Wilson 1989, pp. 274\u20135; Ginet 1990,\npp. 34\u20135). In prospective intention, I intend not only to do\nA, but to do A intentionally, and the same\npoint holds for the object of intention in action. This prevents us\nfrom explaining what it is to act intentionally in terms of intention\nas a mental state. Alternatively, one might hold, as Anscombe (1963,\n\u00a747) apparently does, that for some values of\n\u2018A\u2019\u2014as perhaps, paying, hiring, or\nmarrying\u2014it is essential to doing A that one do it\nintentionally (see Ford 2015; Setiya 2016a).\n\nThe force of this objection is unclear. While there is something wrong\nwith an account of what it is to \u03c6 that appeals to being or doing\n\u03c6, it is not so obviously problematic to appeal to mental states\nthat represent something as being or doing \u03c6. Our task is\nnot to introduce the concept of intentional action to someone who\nlacks that concept, but to spell out the metaphysics of doing\nA intentionally. It is an open question whether\n\u2018metaphysical definition\u2019\u2014saying what it is to\n\u03c6\u2014can be permissibly circular, so long as the circularity is\ncontained in the scope of an attitude. Such circularity is\ncharacteristic of \u2018response-dependent\u2019 accounts of\nevaluative and other properties. (This response may fail if the\nattitude in question is knowledge; see Ford 2011, \u00a74.)\n\nA more direct response to the challenge would deny its premise. While\nit is true that the execution of intention is intentional action, it\ndoes not follow that the object of intention is doing\nA intentionally (cf. Searle 1983, pp. 85\u20136). If I\nintend to be smiling and am doing so involuntarily, I am doing what I\nintend, though not intentionally. Likewise, if I intend to skip\nbreakfast and do so because I forget about it, my intention was\nfulfilled, though not by intentional action. Even paying, hiring, and\nmarrying are things one can do unintentionally; intentionality is not\nbuilt into the object of intention in a way that makes for circularity\n(see Beddor and Pavese forthcoming, \u00a76, responding to\nPi\u00f1eros Glasscock 2020). This point is consistent with the view\nthat, when I act for reasons, those reasons figure in my intention as\na Kantian \u2018maxim\u2019. In that case, my intention is\nfulfilled, in its entirety, only if I act on them and thereby act\nintentionally. (See Wallace 1999, pp. 60\u20132; Setiya 2007a, pp.\n39\u201349; Korsgaard 2008; Schapiro 2011; and, for resistance,\nSinhababu 2013, \u00a73. On the content of intention, more generally,\nsee Harman 1976, pp. 156\u20138; Velleman 1989, pp. 94\u20137; Mele\n1992, Ch. 11; and Ross, pp. 255\u20137, Appendix B.)\n\nThe second problem is more a question: whether \u2018the relation of\nbeing done in execution of a certain intention, or being\ndone intentionally, is a causal relation between act and\nintention.\u2019 (Anscombe 1983, p. 95) Anscombe denies that it is.\nWhen she writes of \u2018practical knowledge\u2019 as \u2018the\ncause of what it understands\u2019 she means formal not efficient\ncause: practical knowledge is essential to the action it represents,\nat least when \u2018the description of the action is of a type to be\nformally the description of an executed intention.\u2019 (See\nAnscombe 1963, pp. 87\u20138, and for conflicting interpretations:\nHursthouse 2000; Vogler 2002; Moran 2004; Newstead 2006; Velleman\n2007; Paul 2011; Ford 2015; Schwenkler 2015; Lavin 2016; Setiya 2016a;\nCampbell 2018a; Campbell 2018b.)\n\nOne source of concern about intention as efficient cause is that\nintention need not precede intentional action, while causes must\nprecede their effects. But causal theorists may deny that claim about\nthe temporality of causes, conceiving intention as the simultaneous,\nsustaining cause of what one is doing (Thalberg 1984, pp. 257\u20138;\nSetiya 2007a, pp 56\u20139).\n\nA more common anxiety turns on \u2018causal deviance\u2019 (Davidson\n1973, p. 79). If we are trying to say what it is to act intentionally,\nthe condition of doing A because one so intends looks\ninsufficient. For it says nothing about the causal path from intention\nto action. If I intend to be shaking in order to signal my\nconfederate, and this intention makes me nervous, so that I shake, I\nam shaking because I so intend\u2014though not intentionally. My\nintention did not cause me to shake \u2018in the right way.\u2019\nNor is the \u2018right way\u2019 obviously a matter of\n\u2018proximate\u2019 causation or the absence of causal\nintermediaries, since a causal theorist may well allow for neural\nintermediaries, and further intentions, in the causal path from\nintention to action. There is a failure of intentional action only\nwhen the intermediaries are of the wrong kind.\n\nReactions to causal deviance vary widely. Some are convinced that the\nproblem is hopeless (Anscombe 1989, pp. 110\u20131; Wilson 1989, Ch.\n9; O\u2019Brien 2007, Ch. 8). Others aim to solve it by\ndistinguishing deviance in the causation of non-basic actions,\nperformed by intentional means, from deviance in basic intentional\naction. The former happens when things do not happen as we planned;\nthe latter can be solved by appeal to forms of causal direction or\nguidance found outside the province of intentional action (Thalberg\n1984; Mele 1992, Ch. 11; Setiya 2007a, pp. 31\u20132, Hyman 2014).\nBut the existence of basic intentional actions is disputed (Lavin\n2013), as is their internal structure or teleology (Valaris 2015;\nSmall 2019).\n\nIt is in any case unclear how the dispute about causal deviance bears\non the project of explaining intentional action through intention as a\nmental state. Would that project survive if the relation of execution\nand the corresponding \u2018because\u2019 were taken as primitive?\nOr in a \u2018disjunctive\u2019 theory according to which intention\nin action has two distinct forms: doing A intentionally and\n\u2018mere\u2019 intending, frustrated by the world? Like the theory\nof intending as being embarked upon intentional action, the\ndisjunctive conception agrees with Aristotle that action is, or can\nbe, the conclusion of practical thought.\n\nCorresponding issues have been pursued in the philosophy of\nperception, where causal and disjunctive theories are often opposed\n(as by Snowdon 1980\u20131), and in epistemology more broadly.\nInstead of explaining knowledge as belief that meets further\nconditions, some epistemologists treat knowledge as basic, explaining\nmere belief as its defective form (McDowell 1995; Williamson 2000).\nThe parallel view of intentional action treats mere intending as a\ndefective form of intentional action (O\u2019Brien 2007; R\u00f6dl\n2007, Ch. 2; McDowell 2010, \u00a77; Marcus 2012, Ch. 2; Levy 2021). A\nquestion for this view is how the state of intending can be a form of\nsomething dynamic: the event or process of acting. To answer this\nquestion, we need to say more about the kind of state intention\nis.\n3. Intention and the Good\n\nIf intention is a mental state in relation to which doing A\namounts to doing A intentionally, or with the further\nintention of doing B, that fact would unify the modes of\nintention with which we began. It would, however, tell us little about\nintending itself. Does this state involve desire? Belief about what\none is doing or what one is going to do? Evaluative judgement? Similar\nquestions arise for those who deny that intention is a mental state\nand explain it as being on the way to intentional action. Must I want\nto perform an action I am thus embarked upon? Believe that I am\nengaged in it? Hold it to be in some way good?\n\nIt is a matter of consensus in the philosophy of intention that\nintending to do A entails wanting to do A, in the\nmotivational sense for which the \u2018primitive sign of wanting is\ntrying to get\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 68). Doubts about\nthis entailment are attributed to ambiguities in \u2018desire.\u2019\nWhen I intend to do A reluctantly, from the motive of duty, I\nmay deny that I want to do it, but what I lack is\n\u2018appetite\u2019 not \u2018volition\u2019 (Davis 1984, pp.\n135\u201340; Thompson 2008, pp. 103\u20135).\n\nIntending is thus a \u2018pro-attitude\u2019 of some\nkind\u2014assuming, for simplicity, that intention is a mental state.\nIn his later work, Davidson specified this pro-attitude as \u2018an\nall-out, unconditional judgement that the action is desirable\u2019\n(Davidson 1978, p. 99). He made two further refinements. First, when\none is doing A intentionally, \u2018at least when the action\nis of brief duration, nothing seems to stand in the way of an\nAristotelian identification of the action with [all-out evaluative\njudgement]\u2019 (Davidson 1978, p. 99). Second, one counts as\nintending an action only if one\u2019s beliefs are consistent with\none\u2019s performing it; one cannot intend to do what one believes\nto be impossible (Davidson 1978, pp. 100\u20131).\n\nIn an influential critique, Bratman objects that choice is possible\neven when one knows that neither option is best (Bratman 1985,\n\u00a7(Bratman 1985, \u00a7V). One can decide between options that are\nequivalent (like the identical bales of hay that stumped Buridan\u2019s\nass) or that are \u2018on a par\u2019, in that neither is better or\nworse than the other, though they are too different to count as\nequally good. (On parity, see Chang 2002). If unconditional judgement\npresents its object as more desirable than any alternative,\nDavidson\u2019s theory wrongly prohibits such decisions. Eugene\nChislenko defends that implication, arguing that the practical problem\nis solved by allowing oneself to drift non-intentionally until one\noption stands out (Chislenko 2016). But while this might work for\nBuridan\u2019s ass, who finds himself slightly closer to one bale of hay\nthan the other, and so decides to eat it, it won\u2019t work for\ndecision-making under parity, where small improvements fail to break\nthe tie.\n\nAn alternative view identifies intention with the unconditional\njudgement that a given action is no less desirable than others. It\nthus permits me to intend either of two equivalent options. The\nproblem is that it permits me to intend both options, even if\nI know that they are incompatible. Against this, Bratman claims that\nit is irrational to intend A and intend B if one\ncannot rationally intend A-and-B, as when doing both\nis inconsistent with one\u2019s beliefs (Bratman 1985, \u00a7(Bratman\n1985, \u00a7V).\n\nA related objection is that we can fail to act, or intend, in\naccordance with our evaluations. In a typical case of\nakrasia, I conclude that I ought to quit, but decide to\ncontinue smoking instead. Davidson (1970) replied to this by\ndistinguishing \u2018all things considered\u2019 from\n\u2018unconditional\u2019 evaluative judgement. In\n\u2018conditional\u2019 or \u2018prima facie\u2019 judgements one\ntakes some body of considerations, r, to support A\nover B. All things considered judgement is the special case\nof this in which r includes all the considerations one holds\nrelevant. There is no inconsistency in judging that the sum of these\nparticular considerations favours A over B while\njudging that B is better than A, perhaps in light of\nother facts one has not explicitly considered. Since it is the latter\njudgement that constitutes intention, one can act intentionally\nagainst the former. This is how Davidson makes sense of my continuing\nto smoke.\n\nFew have been convinced by Davidson\u2019s account. Can\u2019t we\nact\u2014intentionally and without self-contradiction\u2014against\nan unconditional evaluative judgement? Or fail to intend in accordance\nwith one? (McDowell 2010 is a recent critic of Davidson on this score;\nChislenko 2020 argues that akrasia involves contradictory\nbeliefs.) Davidson himself concedes that \u2018A is better\nthan B, all things considered\u2019 entails\n\u2018A is better than B\u2019 if \u2018all\nthings considered\u2019 means \u2018all truths, moral and\notherwise\u2019 (Davidson 1970, p. 40). He may intend this to be\ntrivial, counting that fact that A is better than B\namong the relevant truths. But it is both plausible and non-trivial to\nclaim that A is better than B, in the relevant\nsense, if and only if the balance of reasons favours A over\nB, where the reasons are distinct from that evaluative fact.\nIf it is possible to grasp this connection, to hold that the balance\nof reasons favours quitting, and still not intend to quit,\nDavidson\u2019s theory must be false. (A consequence of this fact is\nthe need to distinguish weakness as akrasia, or acting\nagainst one\u2019s better judgement, from weakness as a failure of will;\nsee Holton 2009, Ch. 4.)\n\nIf we hope to defend an evaluative theory of intention, despite this\npossibility, we will have to equate intending with judgement of some\nother evaluative proposition, not entailed by claims about the balance\nof reasons (as in R\u00f6dl 2007, Ch. 2), distinguish kinds of\njudgement or ways of representing an action as to be done, one of\nwhich constitutes intending, the other of which we act against in\nakrasia (as in Tenenbaum 2007, Ch. 7), or otherwise weaken\nthe relationship between intention and the good (as in Shah 2008).\nWhichever way we go, we will need to motivate the evaluative theory.\nWhat is it about the role of intention in intentional action, or in\npractical reasoning, that requires it to take an evaluative shape?\nWhat is missing from theories of intention on which it does not?\n4. Intentions as Plans\n\nHaving criticized Davidson\u2019s theory, Bratman offers a diagnosis\nof his mistake that appeals to the functional role of intention as a\nmental state. According to Bratman (1985, \u00a7VI), Davidson neglects\nthe place of prospective intentions in cross-temporal and\ninter-personal coordination, and as inputs to further practical\nthought. There is room for doubt about this verdict, since all-out\nevaluative judgement may well appear as a premise of practical\nsyllogism (\u2018I ought to do A; doing B is a\nmeans to that; so I ought to do B\u2019) and since it may\nsustain \u2018diachronic autonomy,\u2019 at least to some extent,\njust through the working of memory (a point emphasized by Ferrero\n2006). But Bratman is right to indicate a gap in Davidson\u2019s\nstory, which he has done more than anyone to fill.\n\nFor Bratman (1987), intention is a distinctive practical attitude\nmarked by its pivotal role in planning for the future. Intention\ninvolves desire, but even predominant desire is insufficient for\nintention, since it need not involve a commitment to act: intentions\nare \u2018conduct-controlling pro-attitudes, ones which we are\ndisposed to retain without reconsideration, and which play a\nsignificant role as inputs to [means-end] reasoning\u2019 (Bratman\n1987, p. 20). The plans for action contained in our intentions are\ntypically partial and must be filled out in accordance with changing\ncircumstances as the future comes.\n\nAmong the advantages of being able to commit ourselves to action in\nadvance, albeit defeasibly, are: (i) the capacity to make rational\ndecisions for circumstances in which we cannot deliberate, or that\nlend themselves to deliberative distortion; (ii) the capacity to\nengage in complex, temporally extended projects that require\ncoordination with our future selves; and (iii) the capacity for\nsimilar coordination with others.\n\nBratman (1987) argues that these advantages are best secured if our\nintentions are consistent with one another and with our beliefs, if\nthey conform to principles of means-end coherence\u2014for instance,\nthat when we intend E and believe that intending M\nis necessary to achieve E, we also intend M, and if\nthey are resistant to reconsideration. There is, he claims, a\n\u2018pragmatic rationale\u2019 for such requirements, \u2018one\ngrounded in [their] long-run contribution to getting what we\n(rationally) want\u2019 (Bratman 1987, p. 35).\n\nResponses to Bratman\u2019s theory have focused largely on the nature\nof these alleged requirements. Bratman (1987, \u00a72.5) argues that\nintentions do not provide inputs to practical reasoning by providing\nadditional reasons. This conception is, on the one hand, too weak,\nsince it treats the fact that I have settled on doing A as\njust one consideration among many in favour of doing it, whereas\nmeans-end coherence is a strict or peremptory demand. And it is, on\nthe other hand, too strong, since it permits a form of illicit\nbootstrapping in which an irrational decision can generate a reason\nthat tips the balance in favour of acting on it. (Do intentions ever\nprovide reasons? Many deny this; see, for instance, Broome 2001;\nBrunero 2007; Cullity 2008; Kolodny 2011. But Bratman\u2019s argument\nleaves room for such reasons, so long as the actions they support\nwould be rational without them. For versions of this point, see Chang\n2009; Ferrero 2010; Smith 2016.)\n\nBratman\u2019s pragmatic theory gives intentions a substantive role\nin practical thought without treating them as reasons. But it faces\nproblems of its own. In structure, Bratman\u2019s theory is akin to\nthe variety of rule-utilitarianism on which we have utilitarian\ngrounds for adopting a practice of punishment or promising that\nsometimes goes against considerations of utility. This structure\nprompts a serious dilemma. If reasons for adopting a practice or\npattern of reasoning transmit to the actions or inferences that fall\nunder it, as Rawls (1955) once argued, the problems of bootstrapping\nand peremptoriness return. All we have is a theory of why\nintentions provide reasons. But if reasons do not transmit in this\nway, the picture appears to be one of \u2018rational\nirrationality\u2019: having reason to adopt or sustain an irrational\npattern of reasoning, on the ground that the results of doing so are\nmostly for the best. Neither option is appealing.\n\nIn his 1987 book, Bratman in effect pursued the second path, hoping to\nsoften its peculiarity by distinguishing \u2018internal\u2019 and\n\u2018external\u2019 perspectives on rationality and deliberation\n(Bratman 1987, \u00a73.5). More recently, he has argued that the\nbenefits of consistency and coherence are more than pragmatic, since\nthey allow for a form of self-governance that is of non-instrumental\nvalue (Bratman 2009b), and that they are closely tied to the\nfunctional role of intentions as plans (Bratman 2009c,\n\u00a7\u00a7VIII\u2013IX). He also adopts John Broome\u2019s (2004)\nidea that the relevant norms take \u2018wide scope.\u2019 For\ninstance, it is irrational to [intend E, believe that\nintending M is necessary to achieve E, and not\nintend M]. It does not follow from this that, if one intends\nE, one is under rational pressure to intend the necessary\nmeans, since one can just as well avoid the forbidden combination of\nattitudes by giving up one\u2019s intention for the end. By the same\ntoken, there is no need to admit that intentions provide reasons for\nacting. We thus avoid both horns of the dilemma sketched above. How\nfar this strategy succeeds is a matter of ongoing dispute (Setiya\n2007b; Bratman 2009b; Brunero 2010; Way 2010). There is also a\nquestion how far Bratman\u2019s functional explanation of means-end\nrationality commits him to a wider form of rationalism or\n\u2018constitutivism\u2019 about practical reason (Setiya 2014;\nBratman 2018).\n\nA further objection to the demands for consistency and coherence in\nintention turns on an implication that Bratman (1987, Ch. 8) himself\ndraws out. According to the Simple View, doing A\nintentionally involves an intention whose object is A. As\nBratman argues, however, it is sometimes rational to attempt both\nA and B, hoping to achieve one or the other, when I\nknow that I cannot do both. If I succeed in doing A, I will\nhave done so intentionally, and thus, on the Simple View, I must have\nintended to do A. Considerations of symmetry imply that I\nalso intended to do B. But then my intentions are not jointly\nconsistent with my beliefs. Bratman concludes that the Simple View is\nfalse, since it would be irrational to have such intentions. Instead,\nI intend to try doing A and to try doing B, knowing\nthat I can make both attempts, though both cannot succeed. Bratman\nadmits that, when I try to do A, I take the relevant means\n\u2018with the intention\u2019 of doing it. But he finds this phrase\nambiguous. On one reading, it ascribes the intention to do A,\nbut in the present case it does not. Instead, I merely\n\u2018endeavour\u2019 to do A, where this is a matter of\n\u2018guiding desire\u2019 (Bratman 1987, Ch. 9).\n\nThe main objection to this view, pressed forcefully by Hugh McCann\n(1991), is that it generates an unhappy proliferation of\nintention-like states, and that, by finding ambiguity in\n\u2018intention with which,\u2019 it fails to unify the guises of\nintention. What is more, there are natural alternatives. One equates\nintention with guiding desire, defends the Simple View, and finds the\nrequirement of consistency defeasible. There is rational pressure to\nconform to it, in general, but this pressure can be outweighed, as\nwhen it makes sense to intend both A and B, despite\ntheir manifest inconsistency, hoping to achieve just one. Another\nalternative appeals to partial intention, by analogy with partial\nbelief (see Holton 2009; Goldstein 2016; Shpall 2016; Archer 2017;\nMu\u00f1oz 2018). There is also room for a more radical view, on\nwhich the reasons for being consistent in one\u2019s intentions, or\nconforming to means-end coherence, reduce to the reasons for acting in\none way or another: Bratman\u2019s alleged requirements are a\n\u2018myth\u2019 (Raz 2005; Kolodny 2008; Tenenbaum 2014).\n\nOther puzzles concern the formulation and defense of diachronic\nrequirements of rationality for intention: the idea that intentions\nshould persist over time, resisting reconsideration, especially in\nlight of temptations they were designed to forestall. (On the nature\nof such requirements, see Holton 2009; Broome 2013: Ch. 10; Paul\n2014b; Bratman 2018; Tenenbaum 2020; Brunero forthcoming.) The idea\nthat intentions resist reconsideration creates potential moral risks:\nwhat if they make us insensitive or indifferent to changing moral\nreasons? (See Bok 1996; Paul 2017.) What do ethical concerns of this\nkind mean for the role of intention in diachronic autonomy or\nself-governance?\n\nA final objection to Bratman\u2019s theory is more general, and would\napply as well to the theory of intention as guiding desire. The\nquestion is whether such accounts reveal the unity of intentional\naction, intention for the future, and intention-with-which.\nMcCann\u2019s objection concerned the latter. The more basic\nobjection is about the role of intention in intentional action.\nBratman (1987, Ch. 8) does not ignore this connection: he proposes\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for doing A intentionally\nthat rely on the state of intending, though not always the intention\nof doing A itself. But it is open to question how deep the\nenvisaged unity goes. Why must there be intention in intentional\naction, if intentions are plans? (See Velleman 2007, \u00a73.)\n\nA partial answer cites the need for direction and guidance in doing\nanything that takes time or requires the selection of means. But it is\nnot clear that such guidance requires intention (see Bratman 1987, pp.\n126\u20137 on spontaneous action). Nor would this forge a general\nconnection between the state of intending and the phenomenon of acting\nfor reasons or the application of Anscombe\u2019s (1963, p. 9)\nquestion \u2018Why?\u2019 If S is doing A on the\nground that p, she is doing it intentionally. Bratman\u2019s\nconditions do not explain why intention must be involved in the\nantecedent of this conditional. Why must reasons attach to what I am\ndoing by way of plans or guiding desires? One response is to admit\nthat they may not: there can be intentional action without intention\n(see Bratman 2000, pp. 51\u20132). But if we hope to unify intention\nwith intentional action, we cannot accept this. Intention must figure\nin the correct account of acting for a reason, and thus intentionally.\nIn order to avoid disunity, the theory of intentions as plans (or as\nguiding desires) needs such an account.\n5. Intention and Belief\n\nAcknowledging these problems, some philosophers turn back to Davidson\nand the project of reducing intention to desire and means-end belief\n(see, especially, Ridge 1998; Sinhababu 2013; and, for discussion,\nMulder 2018). But others see a promise of unity in the\nidea\u2014influentially proposed by Elizabeth Anscombe (1963, pp.\n11\u201315) and Stuart Hampshire (1959, pp. 95, 102)\u2014that when\nS is doing A intentionally, S knows that\nshe is doing A. What is more, acting for a reason, in a sense\nthat contrasts with mere purposive behavior (of the sort\ncharacteristic of other animals), essentially involves such knowledge:\nin acting for a reason, I know an explanation of what I am doing that\ncites that reason, and therefore know that I am doing it. That is why,\nfor Anscombe, the question \u2018Why?\u2019 is \u2018given\napplication\u2019 by the agent. Intentional action turns on knowing\nthe answer to that question.\n\nThis picture raises many difficulties, and needs considerable\nrefinement and defence. (For variations, see Velleman 1989; Velleman\n2000; Setiya 2007a, Part One; R\u00f6dl 2007, Ch. 2; Setiya 2016b.)\nSome will resist the claim that acting for a reason is acting with\nself-knowledge\u2014though it is important to stress that the\nknowledge attributed here need not involve conscious belief. There is\nalso disagreement about the kind of explanation involved in giving the\nreasons for which one acts (Wilson 1989, Ch. 7; Ginet 1990, Ch. 6;\nDancy 2000; Davis 2005; Alvarez 2010; Setiya 2011). But if the picture\nis basically right, it suggests that the unity of intention can be\nfound in knowledge or belief about action. Assuming that knowledge\nentails belief, the basic thought is that intention in action involves\nthe belief that one is doing A. Doing something for a reason\ninvolves a belief about one\u2019s reason for doing it that\nconstitutes intention in action. And prospective intention, or\nintention for the future, involves a belief about what one is going to\ndo and why. The idea that intention involves belief is what unifies\nintentional action, prospective intention, and intention-with-which.\n(On an alternative view, which may be Anscombe\u2019s, intention\ncontrasts with belief: they correspond to radically different kinds of\nknowledge. See the treatment of mistakes below.)\n\nThe claim that intention entails belief\u2014most commonly, that if\none intends to do A, one believes that one is going to do\nit\u2014is widespread among those who draw no particular inspiration\nfrom Anscombe. (See Audi 1973; Harman 1976; Davis 1984; Ross 2009.) As\nGrice (1971, pp. 264\u20136) observed, there is peculiarity of some\nsort in asserting \u2018I intend to do A, but I might not do\nit,\u2019 a peculiarity readily explained if intention is a species\nof belief. It is equally striking that the ordinary expression of\nintention for the future is \u2018I am going to do A\u2019 (Anscombe\n1963, p. 1), which looks like the assertoric expression of belief. The\nsame point holds for intention in action: \u2018What are you up\nto?\u2019; \u2018I am doing A.\u2019 Although such\nevidence is suggestive, however, it might be explained in other ways.\n(See Davidson 1978, pp. 91, 100; for criticism, Pears 1985; and for\nmore recent discussion, Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler 2018,\n\u00a72.2; Levy 2018; Asarnow forthcoming.)\n\nSo far, we have only the fragment of a theory, an alleged condition of\nintending, not an adequate account of what intention is. Here there\nare several possibilities. It is sometimes said that intention\nis belief (Velleman 1989; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler\n2018). But this creates a risk of confusion. It is not clear that\nanyone believes there is a value of p such that intending to\ndo A is no more than believing p. Instead they hold\nthat part of what it is to intend to do A is to believe\np; other conditions must be met. The confusion stems from\ntalk of particular \u2018tokens\u2019 of intending which may be\nidentified with tokens of belief. But the idea of a token state may\nnot be coherent (Steward 1997) and the would-be cognitivist need think\notherwise.\n\nIf intention involves belief, what more does it require? On the\nsimplest proposal, to intend an action is to believe that one will\nperform it and to have an appropriate guiding desire (Audi 1973, p.\n395). But a mere conjunction seems insufficient: the desire and belief\ncould be utterly unrelated (Davis 1984, pp. 141\u20132). This prompts\nthe suggestion that, when S intends to do A, his\nbelief rests on his desire: to intend an action is to believe that one\nwill perform it on the ground that one wants to do so (Davis 1984, p.\n147; see also Grice 1971, pp. 278\u20139). The principal defect of\nthis account is that it makes the belief component of intention\nepiphenomenal. This belief merely registers one\u2019s activity: the\nmotivational work is done by a prior desire. (Something similar is\ntrue on more subtle theories that divorce the motivational role of\nintention from belief; as, for instance, Ross 2009, pp. 250\u20131.)\nIf the claim that intention involves belief is to capture the essence\nof the will, not a superficial fact about the word\n\u2018intend,\u2019 the belief must be implicated in the functions\nof intending and the explanation of action. (For objections of this\nkind, see Bratman 1987, pp. 19\u201320 and Mele 1992, Ch. 8 on\n\u2018intention*\u2019; on the role of beliefs in planning for the\nfuture, see Velleman 1989, Ch. 8; Velleman 2007; Maru\u0161i\u0107\nand Schwenkler 2018, \u00a72.3; Alonso 2020; Alonso 2021.)\n\nThere is variation even among those accounts that give a motivational\nrole to belief. On Velleman\u2019s early view, intentions are\n\u2018self-fulfilling expectations that are motivated by a desire for\ntheir fulfillment and that represent themselves as such\u2019\n(Velleman 1989, p. 109). Such expectations interact with a general\ndesire for self-knowledge to motivate action by which they are\nconfirmed. More recently, Velleman has replaced the desire for\nself-knowledge with a sub-personal aim or disposition (Velleman 2000:\n19\u201321). Either way, his view threatens to generate what Bratman\n(1991, pp. 261\u20132) calls \u2018the problem of\npromiscuity\u2019: in attributing a general tendency that motivates\nus to conform to our own expectations, it predicts that we will be\njust as strongly motivated by beliefs that do not constitute\nintentions, like the belief that I am going to trip over the step, or\nmispronounce a word.\n\nA different proposal, due to Harman (1976, p. 168) is that intentions\nare \u2018conclusion[s] of practical reasoning\u2019 (see also Ross\n2009, pp. 270\u20132; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler 2018). But\nit seems possible to intend an action spontaneously, for no particular\nreason. In later work, Harman looks downstream of intention, rather\nthan upstream: an intention is a belief about what one is doing or\nwhat one is going to do that has the power to guide and motivate\naction through practical thought (Harman 1986, pp. 375\u20136; Setiya\n2007a, pp. 48\u201353). This claim interacts with the question about\n\u2018disjunctive\u2019 theories left unanswered at the end of\nsection 2. If intention involves belief, those who treat knowledge as\nbasic, with mere belief its defective form, will take a similar view\nof \u2018knowledge in intention\u2019 (R\u00f6dl 2007; Ch. 2;\nMcDowell 2010, \u00a77; Marcus 2012, Ch. 2). In the good case,\none\u2019s intention in action involves knowledge of what one is\ndoing: it entails, so cannot cause or motivate, one\u2019s action. In\nthe bad case, one merely intends to act. If not its causal role,\nhowever, what distinguishes knowledge in intention from knowledge of\nother kinds?\n\nFinally, there is Anscombe\u2019s own view, on which there is a\nnormative contrast between intention and ordinary belief. If one fails\nto act as one intends, and not through a mistaken belief about the\nmeans or possibilities for action, \u2018the mistake is not one of\njudgment but of performance\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, pp. 56\u20137).\nIntention sets a standard of success for what does. (For discussions\nof this point, see Frost 2014; Setiya 2016a; Campbell 2018a; Campbell\n2018b.) What is more, there is \u2018a difference of form between\nreasoning leading to action and reasoning for the truth of a\nconclusion\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 60). Intention is justified by\nthe former, not the latter: by practical not theoretical reasoning\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 57\u201362).\n\nIn this respect, Anscombe\u2019s doctrine differs most sharply from\nVelleman\u2019s. As well as thinking of intention as a kind of\nbelief, Velleman holds that \u2018practical reasoning is a kind of\ntheoretical reasoning\u2019 (Velleman 1989, p. 15; see also Ross\n2009). In a review of Velleman\u2019s book, Bratman (1991, pp.\n250\u20131) dubbed the conjunction of these claims \u2018cognitivism\nabout practical reason.\u2019 It prompts what Davidson (1978, p. 95)\ncalled \u2018the strongest argument against identifying [intention]\nwith [belief],\u2019 that \u2018reasons for intending to do\nsomething are in general quite different from reasons for believing\none will do it.\u2019 Though Velleman (1989, pp. 122\u20135) defends\nthat identification, one need not do so in order to accept the theory\nof intention as a form of belief or the idea of \u2018knowledge in\nintention.\u2019\n\nA more modest \u2018cognitivism\u2019 would hold that intention\ninvolves belief, that practical reasoning does not reduce to\ntheoretical, but that some requirements that govern intention are best\nunderstood as requirements of theoretical reason. It is often regarded\nas a virtue of such cognitivism that it explains why there should be\nan indefeasible requirement of consistency among intentions and\nbeliefs (Ross 2009, pp. 244\u20137). It has also been argued that the\nrequirement of means-end coherence follows from requirements of\ntheoretical reason on the beliefs that figure in our intentions\n(Harman 1976, p. 153; Wallace 2001; Setiya 2007b; Ross 2009, pp.\n261\u20135). If I intend to do E and thus believe that I\nwill do it, and I believe that doing M is a necessary means\nto doing E, but do not intend or believe that I am going to\ndo M, I fail to believe a practically salient logical\nconsequence of what I believe. The principal challenge for a\ncognitivist account of means-end coherence is to explain why one must\navoid such theoretical failures by forming the relevant intention, not\njust the corresponding belief (Bratman 2009a). But once again, one\nneed not defend cognitivism, even in its less ambitious form, in\nconceiving intention as a kind of belief.\n\nThere are two main arguments against this conception. The first turns\non apparent cases of intention without belief. According to Davidson,\n\u2018[a] man may be making ten carbon copies as he writes, and this\nmay be intentional; yet he may not know that he is; all he knows is\nthat he is trying\u2019 (Davidson 1971, p. 50; see also Davidson\n1978, pp. 91\u20134). Or imagine I am recovering from paralysis, and\nmovement slowly returns to my hand. At a certain point, I am not sure\nthat I can clench my fist. As it happens, I can. But if I try to do so\nbehind my back, under anesthesia, I may not believe that I am\nclenching my fist, even though\u2014on the face of it\u2014I am\ndoing so intentionally, and that is just what I intend (Setiya 2008,\npp. 390\u20131). Something similar crops up in planning for the\nfuture. I intend to mail the bills on the way to work, but I know that\nI am forgetful, and don\u2019t believe that I will do it (see Bratman\n1987, pp. 37\u20138).\n\nSuch examples can be dealt with in various ways. One strategy insists\nthat, when I do not believe that I am clenching my fist, or that I\nwill mail the bills, I do not intend the corresponding actions, I\nmerely intend to try (Harman 1986, pp. 364\u20135; Velleman\n1989, pp. 115\u20136). But do I really act as I intended if I try and\nfail? (See Pears 1985, p. 86; McCann 1991, p. 212.) And when I know\nthat I am forgetful, do I even believe that I will try to mail the\nbills? A more radical theory points to the simplifying assumption,\noften made in epistemology, that belief is binary and does not come by\ndegree. On that assumption, it may be harmless to claim that intention\ninvolves belief. But the truth is bound to be more complex: that in\nforming an intention one becomes more confident than one would\notherwise be (Setiya 2008, pp. 391\u20132); or that the will is a\ncapacity to know what one is doing, or what one is going to do, whose\nexercise may be impeded, yielding mere belief or partial belief\ninstead of knowledge (Pears 1985, pp. 78\u201381; Setiya 2009, pp.\n129\u201331; Setiya 2012, pp. 300\u2013303; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and\nSchwenkler 2018, \u00a73.1).\n\nA final response casts doubt on the examples. When we recall the\n\u2018openness\u2019 of the progressive, we can insist that\nDavidson\u2019s carbon-copier knows that he is making ten copies,\neven if he is not sure the copies are going through first time (see\nThompson 2011; Wolfson 2012). It is not a condition of being embarked\non intentional action that one will in fact succeed. The same might be\nsaid when I am clenching my first, if what I know is merely that I am\nin progress towards doing so, in some liminal way. (This points back\nto the theory of intending as doing, discussed in section 1.) This\nstrategy struggles with prospective intention and the belief that I am\ngoing to act. But its advocates may insist that the content of\nprospective intention is also imperfective (Thompson 2008, pp.\n142\u20135). We have practical knowledge only of what is in progress,\nnot what has happened, or what will.\n\nThe second objection is epistemic. If forming an intention is, among\nother things, coming to believe that one is doing A, or that\none is going to do A, what entitles us to form such beliefs?\nNot, or not ordinarily, that we have sufficient evidence of their\ntruth. Forming an intention is not predicting the future on the basis\nof what one takes to be, or what ought to be, adequate grounds. That\nis why Anscombe calls practical knowledge \u2018knowledge without\nobservation,\u2019 meaning to exclude not only observation in the\nnarrow sense but knowledge by inference (Anscombe 1963, p. 50). And it\nis why Velleman (1989) writes about \u2018spontaneous\u2019\nknowledge of action. Even though he hopes to reduce practical to\ntheoretical reasoning, and holds that intention involves belief, he\ndenies that intentions are formed on the basis of sufficient prior\nevidence. Anscombe and Velleman concede that knowledge in intention\noften rests in part on observation; the claim is that it goes beyond\nwhat observation, or inference from prior evidence, can support. (For\ndiffering views of the role of perception in practical knowledge, see\nPickard 2004; Gibbons 2010; Schwenkler 2011; Ford 2016.)\n\nThe postulation of beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence is\nsometimes taken as a fatal flaw. In a memorable formulation, Grice\n(1971, p. 268) wrote that it makes decision \u2018a case of licensed\nwishful thinking.\u2019 According to Grice, we are not epistemically\npermitted to form beliefs about what we are doing, or what we are\ngoing to do, without sufficient prior evidence. Instead, we know what\nwe are doing, or what we are going to do, by inference from the\ncondition of our will, along with premises about our own abilities\n(Grice 1971, pp. 275\u20139; Paul 2009). The condition of the will\ncannot itself involve belief.\n\nReactions to this problem vary widely. Those who restrict the content\nof intention to what is in progress and emphasize how little is\ninvolved in being embarked on intentional action may suggest that the\nbeliefs in question verify themselves. It is sufficient for doing\nA intentionally, in the relevant sense, that one intends to\ndo it. As we saw in section 1, however, there are reasons to doubt\nthis sufficiency. And the view seems to deflate the interest of\npractical knowledge. Anscombe warns against the \u2018false avenue of\nescape\u2019 on which \u2018I really \u201cdo\u201d in the\nintentional sense whatever I think I am doing\u2019 (Anscombe 1963,\np. 52), and seems to allow for practical knowledge of what I will\nactually do or what I have done (Moran 2004: 146; Setiya 2016a; Haase\n2018).\n\nOther views account for knowledge in intention in reliabilist terms:\nwhere one\u2019s intention to do A reliably issues in doing\nA, it may amount to knowledge of what one is doing, or what\none is going to do (Newstead 2006, \u00a72; Velleman 2007, \u00a75).\nNon-reliabilists may dismiss the need for prior evidence,\nholding that we are entitled to form a belief if we know that it will\nbe true, and that we will have sufficient evidence for its truth, once\nformed; this condition can be met when we form an intention to act\n(Harman 1976, p. 164, n. 8; Velleman 1989, pp. 56\u201364). So long\nas I know what I intend, and that my intention will be effective, I\nhave sufficient evidence for what I am doing, or what am I going to\ndo, even though this evidence did not precede the forming of my\nintention.\n\nCritics may object to the necessity of these conditions. According to\nBerislav Maru\u0161i\u0107 (2015), I can form the \u2018practical\nbelief\u2019 that I will do A without knowing that my\nintention will be effective, so long as I know that its execution is\nup to me. A more common objection is that the conditions are not\nsufficient. They assimilate intention to faith, as when I form the\nbelief that I can leap a great chasm even though I have no evidence of\nmy ability to do so, knowing that the belief itself will ensure\nsuccess. It is not clear that such acts of faith are possible, that\nthey are epistemically rational, or that they provide a plausible\nmodel for intention (Langton 2004; Setiya 2008, \u00a7III). On an\nalternative view, there is a general demand for prior evidence in\nforming beliefs, but our intentions are sometimes exempt from it, as\nperhaps when we know how to perform the relevant acts (Setiya 2008;\nSetiya 2009; Setiya 2012). It is know-how that explains why the\nexecution of our intentions, and thus the truth of the beliefs that\nthey involve, can be credited to us.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s position on the matter is elusive, and may have to do\nwith her normative claims about intention and belief. Is practical\nknowledge exempt from ordinary requirements of evidence because there\nis a mistake of performance, not of judgement, when its object is\nfalse? (See Anscombe 1963, pp. 4\u20135, 56\u20137; Campbell 2018a.)\nWould it then amount to knowledge of what is not the case? Anscombe\nmay seem to suggest as much (Anscombe 1963, p. 82), but it is unclear\nwhether she accepts or merely entertains this prospect.\n\nImplicit these debates is a question about the scope of groundless\n(non-perceptual, non-inferential) self-knowledge. A blanket objection\nto beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence cannot be\nsustained: I often know what I believe without having come to know on\nthe basis of perception or inference. Is groundless knowledge of this\nkind restricted to our mental states? Or can it extend to what we are\ndoing and what we are going to do? Compare externalism about content:\nat least typically, believing p has implications for the\nconstitution of the world outside one\u2019s skin; but it remains\naccessible to self-knowledge (Burge 1988). Why should that not be true\nof intentional action? On any reading, part of the aim of\nAnscombe\u2019s Intention was to break the Cartesian\nprejudice against self-knowledge of what is happening in the world. If\nshe failed in that endeavour, she at least prescribed a task for\nfuture work: to say whether it is indeed a prejudice or a decisive\nobstacle to the possibility of practical knowledge and the theory that\nintention involves belief.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alonso, F., 2020, \u2018Planning on a Prior Intention,\u2019\n<em>Journal of Ethics and Social Philosophy</em>, 18: 229\u2013265.\n [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26556/jesp.v18i3.850\" target=\"other\">Alonso 2020 available online</a>]", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2021, \u2018The Limits of Partial\nDoxasticism,\u2019 <em>Erkenntnis</em>, 72: 326\u2013345.", "Alvarez, M., 2010, <em>Kinds of Reasons</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "Anscombe, G.
