    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction || From Modern Subjectivism to Late-Modern Enframing in Aesthetics\n2.7 From Modern Subjectivism to Late-Modern Enframing in Aesthetics\n\n\nBefore turning our attention to Heidegger\u2019s post-aesthetic\nthinking, the last thing we need to do is to clarify his more difficult\nclaim that aesthetics not only follows from but also feeds back\ninto subjectivism. What makes this claim difficult to grasp\nis the specific twist Heidegger gives to it: Put simply,\naesthetics feeds back into subjectivism in a way that leads\nsubjectivism beyond itself\u2014and into something even worse than\nsubjectivism. In aesthetics, Heidegger suggests, subjectivism\n\u201csomersaults beyond itself [selbst\n\u00fcberschl\u00e4gt]\u201d into enframing (N1 77/GA43\n90). We can see how subjectivism somersaults beyond itself into\nenframing if we return to Heidegger\u2019s definition of subjectivism\nin \u201cThe Age of the World Picture,\u201d according to which\nmodern subjectivism names our modern attempt to secure\n\u201cour unlimited power for calculating, planning, and molding [or\n\u2018breeding,\u2019 Z\u00fcchtung] all things\u201d (QCT\n135/GA5 94). It is not difficult to detect a subtle resistance to\nthe National Socialist worldview and (what Heidegger understood as) its\nNietzschean roots in Heidegger\u2019s 1938 critique of Western\nhumanity\u2019s drive toward the total mastery of the world through\n\u201ccalculating, planning, and breeding.\u201d But more\nimportantly for our purposes, such descriptions of humanity\u2019s\ndrive to master the world completely through the coldly rational\napplication of calculative reasoning also show that what\nHeidegger calls \u201csubjectivism\u201d is a conceptual and\nhistorical precursor to what he will soon call \u201cenframing\u201d\n(or Gestell).\n\n\n\u201cEnframing\u201d is Heidegger\u2019s famous name for the\ntechnological understanding of being that underlies and shapes our\ncontemporary age. Just as Descartes inaugurates modern\nsubjectivism (as we have seen), so Nietzsche inaugurates\nlate-modern enframing by understanding being\u2014the\n\u201ctotality of entities as such\u201d\u2014as \u201ceternally\nrecurring will to power.\u201d Heidegger thinks that\nNietzsche\u2019s \u201contotheology\u201d (that means, to put it\nbriefly, Nietzsche\u2019s way of grasping the totality of what-is from\nboth the inside-out and the outside-in at the same time) worked to\ninaugurate our own late-modern view that reality is nothing but forces\ncoming-together and breaking-apart with no end other than the\nself-perpetuating growth of force itself. By tacitly approaching\nreality through the lenses of this Nietzschean ontotheology, we\nincreasingly come to understand and so to treat all entities as\nintrinsically-meaningless \u201cresources\u201d (Bestand)\nstanding by for efficient and flexible optimization. It is (to\ncut a long story short) this nihilistic technologization of\nreality that Heidegger\u2019s later thinking is dedicated to finding a\npath\n beyond.[23]\nFor Heidegger, true art opens just such\na path, one that can guide us beyond enframing\u2019s ontological\n\u201ccommandeering of everything into assured availability\u201d\n(PLT 84/GA5 72), as we will see in section 3.\n\n\nFirst, however, we need to understand how subjectivism leads beyond\nitself into enframing. Put simply, subjectivism becomes enframing\nwhen the subject objectifies itself\u2014that is, when the\nhuman subject, seeking to master and control all aspects of its\nobjective reality, turns that impulse to control the world of objects\nback onto itself. If we remember that modern\nsubjectivism designates the human subject\u2019s quest to\nachieve total control over all objective aspects of reality, then we\ncan see that late-modern enframing emerges historically out of\nsubjectivism as subjectivism increasingly transforms the human subject\nitself into just another object to be controlled.\nEnframing, we could say, is subjectivism squared (or\nsubjectivism applied back to the subject). For, the subjectivist\nimpulse to master reality redoubles itself in enframing, even though\nenframing\u2019s objectification of the subject dissolves the very\nsubject/object division that initially drove the subject\u2019s\nrelentless efforts to master the objective world standing over against\nit (Thomson 2005). Subjectivism \u201csomersaults beyond\nitself\u201d in our late-modern age of \u201cenframing\u201d because\nthe impulse to control everything intensifies and accelerates even as\nit breaks free of its modern moorings and circles back on the subject\nitself, turning the human subject into just one more object to be\nmastered and controlled\u2014until the modern subject becomes just\nanother late-modern entity to be efficiently optimized along with\neverything else. We are thus moving from modern subjectivism to\nthe late-modern enframing of reality insofar as we understand and\nrelate to all things, ourselves included, as nothing but\nintrinsically-meaningless \u201cresources\u201d standing by for\nendless optimization. Interestingly, Heidegger saw this\ntechnological understanding of being embodied in contemporary works of\nart like the \n modern butterfly interchange on a freeway,\nwhich, like a\nlate-modern temple, quietly reinforces our technological understanding\nof all reality as\n \u201ca network of long-distance traffic, spaced in a way calculated for maximum speed\u201d\n(PLT 152/GA7 155), an optimizing function now\nserved even more efficiently and pervasively by the internet (to which\nwe are now connected by millions of little shrines, made ever faster,\nmore efficient and portable, and which we find ourselves increasingly\nunable to live\n without).[24]\n\n\nIn the late 1930s, Heidegger understood such technological\noptimization as an all-encompassing attempt to derive the maximal\noutput from the minimal input, a quantification of quality that\nthreatens to dissolve quality in the same way that the objectification\nof the subject threatens to dissolve subjectivity. Heidegger\nseems first to have recognized this objectification of the subject in\nthe Nazis\u2019 coldly calculating eugenics programs for\n\u201cbreeding\u201d a master race, but (as he predicted) that\nunderlying impulse to objectively master the human subject continues\nunabated in more scientifically plausible and less overtly horrifying\nforms of contemporary genetic\n engineering.[25]\nMost importantly for us\nhere, Heidegger also recognized this ongoing objectification of the\nsubject in the seemingly innocuous way that aesthetics\n\u201csomersaults beyond itself\u201d into neuroscientific attempts\nto understand and control the material substrate of the mind.\nFor, once aesthetics reduces art to intense subjective experience, such\nexperiences can be studied objectively through the use of EEGs,\nfMRIs, MEG and PET scans (and the like), and in fact aesthetic\nexperiences are increasingly being studied in this way. At the\nUniversity of New Mexico\u2019s MIND Institute, to mention just one\ntelling example, subjects were given \u201cbeautiful\u201d images to\nlook at and the resulting neuronal activity in their brains was studied\nempirically using one of the world\u2019s most powerful functional\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging machines. In this way, as Heidegger\npredicted in 1937:\n\n\nAesthetics becomes a psychology that proceeds in the manner of the\nnatural sciences; that is, states of feeling become self-evident facts\nto be subjected to experiments, observation, and measurement. (N1\n89/GA43 106)\n\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Heidegger writes, \u201cthe final consequences\nof the aesthetic inquiry into art are thought through to the end\u201d\n(N1 91/GA43 108). Aesthetics reaches its logical\nconclusion\u2014the \u201cfulfillment or consummation\u201d\n(Vollendung) which completes it and so brings it to its\nend\u2014when it thus \u201csomersaults beyond itself\u201d into\nenframing.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s objection to aesthetic enframing, then, is not just that\nthe work of art is increasingly falling under the influence of\nenframing\u2014that artworks too are becoming mere resources for the\nart industry, standing reserves piled in storerooms \u201clike\npotatoes in a cellar\u201d to be quickly and efficiently\n\u201cshipped like coal\u2026or logs\u2026from one exhibition to\nanother\u201d (PLT 19/GA5 3). He is even more troubled by the way\nart, reduced to aesthetics, does not just get enframed but\nparticipates in the enframing\u2014for example, when the feeling of\nbeauty is reduced to a purportedly objective brain state to be\nprecisely measured and controlled through cognitive\nneuroscience.[26]\n\n\nAs the human subject turns its subjectivist impulse to control the\nobjective world back onto itself in such neuroscientific\nexperimentation, aesthetics increasingly becomes just one more\napproach reinforcing the technological \u201cenframing\u201d of all\nreality. Heidegger thus reaches a harsh verdict: Aesthetic\n\u201cexperience is the element in which art dies. This dying goes on\nfor so long that it takes several centuries\u201d (PLT 79/GA5\n 67).[27]\nFortunately, Heidegger\u2019s prognosis is not as bleak as this\napparent death sentence suggests. That art is slowly dying as\naesthetics, he clarifies in a later addition,\n\n\ndoes not mean that art is utterly at an end. That will be the\ncase only if [aesthetic] experience remains the sole element for\nart. Everything depends on getting out of [aesthetic] experience\nand into being-here [Da-sein], which means reaching an\nentirely different \u201celement\u201d for the \u201cbecoming\u201d\nof art. (P 50 note b/GA5 67 note b)\n\n\nIn other words, art is dying only as aesthetics, and the death of art\nas aesthetics makes possible the transformative rebirth of art as\nsomething other than a subject\u2019s experience of an object.  Indeed,\njust as modern subjectivism led beyond itself historically into\nlate-modern enframing, so Heidegger believes enframing, in turn, can\nlead beyond itself into a genuine post-modernity, an age that\ntranscends our late-modern age\u2019s ongoing technologization of reality\nand its nihilistic erosion of all intrinsic meaning (the void which we\ntry to fill with all our superficial talk about \u201cvalues\u201d)\n(see Thomson 2011, 60\u20132). This hope for an historical turning\ntoward a genuinely meaningful post-modernity is what motivates\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenological attempt to describe and so convey a\npost-aesthetic encounter with art, to which we now turn.\n",
