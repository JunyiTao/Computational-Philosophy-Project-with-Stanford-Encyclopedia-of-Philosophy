    "main_text": "Heisenberg || Heisenberg\u2019s road to the uncertainty relations\n2.1 Heisenberg\u2019s road to the uncertainty relations\n\nHeisenberg introduced his famous relations in an article of 1927,\nentitled Ueber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen\nKinematik und Mechanik. A (partial) translation of this title is:\n\u201cOn the anschaulich content of quantum theoretical\nkinematics and mechanics\u201d. Here, the term anschaulich\nis particularly notable. Apparently, it is one of those German words\nthat defy an unambiguous translation into other languages.\nHeisenberg\u2019s title is translated as \u201cOn the physical\ncontent \u2026\u201d by Wheeler and Zurek (1983). His\ncollected works (Heisenberg 1984) translate it as \u201cOn the\nperceptible content \u2026\u201d, while Cassidy\u2019s\nbiography of Heisenberg (Cassidy 1992), refers to the paper as\n\u201cOn the perceptual content \u2026\u201d. Literally,\nthe closest translation of the term anschaulich is\n\u201cvisualizable\u201d. But, as in most languages, words that make\nreference to vision are not always intended literally. Seeing is\nwidely used as a metaphor for understanding, especially for immediate\nunderstanding. Hence, anschaulich also means\n\u201cintelligible\u201d or\n \u201cintuitive\u201d.[1]\n\n\nWhy was this issue of the Anschaulichkeit of quantum\nmechanics such a prominent concern to Heisenberg? This question has\nalready been considered by a number of commentators (Jammer 1974;\nMiller 1982; de Regt 1997; Beller 1999). For the answer, it turns out,\nwe must go back a little in time. In 1925 Heisenberg had developed the\nfirst coherent mathematical formalism for quantum theory (Heisenberg\n1925). His leading idea was that only those quantities that are in\nprinciple observable should play a role in the theory, and that all\nattempts to form a picture of what goes on inside the atom should be\navoided. In atomic physics the observational data were obtained from\nspectroscopy and associated with atomic transitions. Thus, Heisenberg\nwas led to consider the \u201ctransition quantities\u201d as the\nbasic ingredients of the theory. Max Born, later that year, realized\nthat the transition quantities obeyed the rules of matrix calculus, a\nbranch of mathematics that was not so well-known then as it is now. In\na famous series of papers Heisenberg, Born and Jordan developed this\nidea into the matrix mechanics version of quantum theory.\n\nFormally, matrix mechanics remains close to classical mechanics. The\ncentral idea is that all physical quantities must be represented by\ninfinite self-adjoint matrices (later identified with operators on a\nHilbert space). It is postulated that the matrices \\(\\bQ\\)\nand \\(\\bP\\) representing the canonical position and\nmomentum variables of a particle satisfy the so-called canonical\ncommutation rule\n\n\\[\\tag{1} \n\\bQ\\bP - \\bP\\bQ = i\\hslash\\]\n\n\n where \\(\\hslash = h/2\\pi\\), \\(h\\) denotes\nPlanck\u2019s constant, and boldface type is used to represent\nmatrices (or operators). The new theory scored spectacular empirical\nsuccess by encompassing nearly all spectroscopic data known at the\ntime, especially after the concept of the electron spin was included\nin the theoretical framework.\n\nIt came as a big surprise, therefore, when one year later, Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger presented an alternative theory, that became known as\nwave mechanics. Schr\u00f6dinger assumed that an electron in an atom\ncould be represented as an oscillating charge cloud, evolving\ncontinuously in space and time according to a wave equation. The\ndiscrete frequencies in the atomic spectra were not due to\ndiscontinuous transitions (quantum jumps) as in matrix mechanics, but\nto a resonance phenomenon. Schr\u00f6dinger also showed that the two\ntheories were equivalent.[2]\n\n\nEven so, the two approaches differed greatly in interpretation and\nspirit. Whereas Heisenberg eschewed the use of visualizable pictures,\nand accepted discontinuous transitions as a primitive notion,\nSchr\u00f6dinger claimed as an advantage of his theory that it was\nanschaulich. In Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s vocabulary, this\nmeant that the theory represented the observational data by means of\ncontinuously evolving causal processes in space and time. He\nconsidered this condition of Anschaulichkeit to be an\nessential requirement on any acceptable physical theory.\nSchr\u00f6dinger was not alone in appreciating this aspect of his\ntheory. Many other leading physicists were attracted to wave mechanics\nfor the same reason. For a while, in 1926, before it emerged that wave\nmechanics had serious problems of its own, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\napproach seemed to gather more support in the physics community than\nmatrix mechanics.\n\nUnderstandably, Heisenberg was unhappy about this development. In a\nletter of 8 June 1926 to Pauli he confessed that \u201cThe more I\nthink about the physical part of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s theory, the\nmore disgusting I find it\u201d, and: \u201cWhat Schr\u00f6dinger\nwrites about the Anschaulichkeit of his theory, \u2026 I\nconsider Mist\u201d (Pauli 1979: 328). Again, this last\nGerman term is translated differently by various commentators: as\n\u201cjunk\u201d (Miller 1982) \u201crubbish\u201d (Beller 1999)\n\u201ccrap\u201d (Cassidy 1992), \u201cpoppycock\u201d\n(Bacciagaluppi & Valentini 2009) and perhaps more literally, as\n\u201cbullshit\u201d (Moore 1989; de Regt 1997). Nevertheless, in\npublished writings, Heisenberg voiced a more balanced opinion. In a\npaper in Die Naturwissenschaften (1926) he summarized the\npeculiar situation that the simultaneous development of two competing\ntheories had brought about. Although he argued that\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s interpretation was untenable, he admitted\nthat matrix mechanics did not provide the Anschaulichkeit\nwhich made wave mechanics so attractive. He concluded: \n\n\nto obtain a contradiction-free anschaulich interpretation, we\nstill lack some essential feature in our image of the structure of\nmatter. \n\n\nThe purpose of his 1927 paper was to provide exactly this lacking\nfeature.\n",
