    "main_text": "Life, Style of Philosophy, the Platonic \u201cAcademy\u201d\n1. Life, Style of Philosophy, the Platonic \u201cAcademy\u201d\n\n\nFicino was born on 19 October, 1433, in Figline Valdarno, a small\ncommunity southeast of Florence, to his mother Alexandra (the daughter\nof a Florentine citizen) and her husband, Dietifeci Ficino.\nDietifeci, a physician, eventually served early fifteenth-century\nFlorence\u2019s greatest patron, Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, who by the time of\nFicino\u2019s birth was one of the richest men in Europe. The precise\ncourse of Ficino\u2019s education is uncertain, but it is plausible that\nfrom a young age he was exposed to the medical traditions shared by\nhis father (folk elements, no doubt, had their part in these\ntraditions, even if those elements are not often recorded). Two\neducators, Comando Comandi and Luca di San Gimignano, carried out\nFicino\u2019s early exposure to \u201cgrammatica,\u201d which is to say\nbasic Latinate education. The outlines of Ficino\u2019s early career begin\nto appear a bit more clearly in the 1450s; and while it is still\nunclear with whom, exactly, he studied Greek and other matters, the\nnames of the likely candidates, Francesco da Castiglione (who may have\ntaught him Greek), Antonio degli Agli, Lorenzo Pisano, and\nNiccol\u00f2 Tignosi, all point in a similar direction: that of an\nexcellent but traditional education, focused on questions drawn from\nthe realm of scholastic theology (Field 1988; Hankins 1989 and\n2003\u20134; Vasoli 1997a).\n\n\nThe middle of the 1450s saw Ficino begin a practice that continued\nthroughout his life: writing philosophical letters to friends. A\nnoteworthy letter from 1458 shows him interested in four\n\u201csects\u201d of philosophers: Platonists, Aristotelians,\nStoics, and Epicureans (Ficino, \u201cDe sectis philosophorum,\u201d\nin Kristeller 1938, 2: 7\u201311). There is little surprising in\nFicino\u2019s account, drawn primarily from Latin sources, apart from the\nminor fact that he devoted more space to Epicureanism than to the\nother schools, indicative of a possible early \u201cLucretian\u201d\nperiod alluded to in certain sources (Brown; Hankins, Plato).\nFicino notes that some Peripatetics have held that Aristotle believed\nthe human soul would die along with the body, though significantly he\navoids attributing this position to Aristotle himself.\n\n\nYet if this early epistolary treatise does not contain revolutionary\nopinions, it does signify a guiding principle that runs through\nFicino\u2019s career: \u201cphilosophy\u201d and the \u201chistory of\nphilosophy\u201d are closely tied. Another way to put this is that\nfor Ficino, imitative exegesis represented a way to\nphilosophize. Ficino regarded himself as a Platonist, but this did not\nmean that he was interested in finding Plato\u2019s intentions in a\nhistoricist manner. Instead, he saw himself as one member of a\nvenerable sequence of interpreters who added to a store of wisdom that\nGod allowed progressively to unfold. Each of these \u201cprisci\ntheologi,\u201d or \u201cancient theologians,\u201d had his part to\nplay in discovering, documenting, and elaborating the truth contained\nin the writings of Plato and other ancient sages, a truth to which\nthese sages may not have been fully privy, acting as they were as\nvessels of divine truth.\n\n\nThe 1460s saw Ficino gain an audience in Florence. Much later in life\nhe would write that the wealthy and powerful Cosimo de\u2019 Medici had not\nonly been his most important patron, which was certainly true, but\nthat he had also acted as the guiding genius behind a Platonic\nAcademy. While extant sources do not permit us to understand the\nPlatonic Academy as a formal school or advanced institution with\nregular meetings, there are some facts that can be documented: Cosimo\nin 1463 gave Ficino a small property in Careggi with a domicile\n(\u201ccum domo pro laboratore et hoste et terris laboratis,\u201d\nas the document in the State Archive of Florence puts it; see Gentile,\nNiccoli, and Viti 1984, 175\u201376). There is also a letter from\nFicino to Cosimo from September of 1462, in which Ficino writes:\n\u201cspiritedly do I devote myself to the Academy you arranged for\nus on the estate in Careggi, as if I worship rightly at a kind of\nshrine of contemplation\u201d (See Ficino in Kristeller 1938, 2:\n87\u201388; and Gentile, Niccoli, and Viti 1984, 176). These two\nsources allow the inference that, while the specific gift of property\ndid not occur until 1463, Ficino and his cohort met at least once on\nMedici property in the hills outside Florence. There is another\ndocument, again from 1462, which shows that he received a house in the\ncity of Florence as a gift from Cosimo, which was then rented out, so\nthat Ficino received the income from the rent (Gentile, Niccoli, and\nViti 1984, 174\u201375).\n\n\nFicino\u2019s connection with the Medici family waxed and waned after\nCosimo died in 1464, but the relationship signals something important:\nfor a time, Ficino represented one of the central elements of\nFlorentine intellectual life. He cultivated a wide correspondence\nnetwork and counted among his friends and patrons some of the city\u2019s\nmost influential citizens. Ordained in 1473, he later became a canon\nof Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence\u2019s cathedral with its famous dome\ndesigned by Brunelleschi. The rest of Ficino\u2019s life was marked by a\ntwofold aspect, priestly and medical, in which he can be seen as a\nhealer both of souls and of bodies.\n\n\nAnother way to understand Ficino and his academy is to examine the\nvarious ways he uses the word \u201cacademy\u201d and its\nvariants. What one finds is that Plato\u2019s dialogues themselves could be\nreferred to as an \u201cacademy,\u201d rich with precious teachings\nas they were. An \u201cacademy\u201d could be a private school\norganized to teach youths, though not necessarily located in one\nspecific place or devoted to one doctrinal tradition. And the word\n\u201cacademy\u201d could refer to regular meetings of literary\nmen. Ficino\u2019s \u201cacademy\u201d seems to have been more associated\nwith the first two meanings of the word. Rather than leading a regular\ngathering in a specific place, Ficino preferred to teach Florence\u2019s\nelite youth when he could and, as a Socratic, philosophical friend, to\ntry to draw out of his associates the better part of their natures in\nconversation. (Hankins 2003\u201304, vol.2; Celenza 2007, 83)\n\n\nIllustrative on a number of levels is a letter of 1491 written to a\nGerman friend and correspondent, Martin Prenninger (in Ficino 1576,\n936\u201337). There, Ficino discusses his network of friends and\nacquaintances. Though it does not contain the word\n\u201cacademy\u201d or \u201cacademic,\u201d the letter gives a\ngood idea of what Ficino believed he was doing when it came to\nhis program of sharing Platonic wisdom, which was linked with\nwhat he saw as true Christianity. His correspondent had asked him\nabout his friends, and Ficino is careful in response to qualify what\n\u201cfriend\u201d means: \u201cKnow that all [of my friends] are\nindeed well-tested both with respect to their intellectual talent and\ntheir character. I have never considered anyone a friend unless I also\ndetermined that he had joined literary learning together with\nuprightness of character.\u201d For Ficino, the notion that one\nshould combine book learning with good moral character was\n\u201cPlatonic,\u201d and immediately after the cited section he\nalludes to a passage in the (for Ficino authentic) Platonic\nLetters, expressing a similar sentiment. In truth,\nhowever, this sentiment (and countless others like it in Ficino\u2019s\nwork) belongs to no specific school of thought; rather, it is part of a\nlong, pre-modern tradition stressing the need to link learning with\nmorals. For Ficino, it was \u201cPlatonic\u201d because it was\ntrue, and it was \u201ctrue\u201d because it was Platonic. For\nus, however, Ficino\u2019s framing of his catalogue of friends in this\nway reminds us just how generally and broadly he believed\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d wisdom to extend. That is, in the broadest\nsense, for Ficino, everything he did could be considered\n\u201cPlatonic.\u201d\n\n\nThere are more precise ways of looking at what Ficino\u2019s\n\u201cacademic\u201d activity might have entailed. He continues, in\nthat same letter, to separate his friends into three categories. There\nare \u201cpatrons\u201d (in which category all the Medici family\nmembers were included). These are followed by \u201cfamiliar friends,\nfellow conversationalists, so to speak\u201d (\u201cconsuetudine\nfamiliares, ut ita loquar, confabulatores\u201d); and third, there\nare \u201cauditores\u201d or \u201cstudents.\u201d The\nconfabulatores include numerous prominent intellectuals, among\nthem Leon Battista Alberti, Angelo Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola. Ficino writes that, if the people he lists are\n\u201calmost pupils [discipuli], still, they aren\u2019t\nreally pupils, since I wouldn\u2019t want to imply that I had taught\nor am teaching any of them, but rather, in a Socratic fashion, I ask\nthem all questions and encourage them, and I persistently call forth\nthe fertile geniuses of my friends to bring about birth.\u201d\nFicino saw his influence in the classic Socratic manner, as midwifery\nof knowledge, an image made famous in Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus. Uniting his medical and priestly missions,\nFicino\u2019s goal was to help cure the diseases of ignorance\nand impiety, which he regarded as related.\n\n\nFicino also taught occasionally in a more formal sense. Early in his\ncareer, he lectured publicly on Plato\u2019s Philebus, though\nwhere and in what context precisely is unknown. He taught very briefly\nat the Florentine studio, or university (see Davies\n1992). He also instructed youths at the Camaldolese convent of Santa\nMaria degli Angeli, and he probably taught privately at various times\nto supplement his income. But what exactly he taught remains uncertain\n(even as what exactly Plato taught within the confines of the Academy\nis uncertain). One compelling source, the\nDeclamationes of the little-known humanist Benedetto Colucci,\nrepresents Ficino presiding in 1474 over a group of five well-born\nyouths (see Colucci 1939). All of them (students\ncontemporaneously of his humanist friend Cristoforo Landino at the\nFlorentine studio) are given the task, supervised by Ficino\n(referred to as the \u201cAcademiae princeps\u201d), of delivering a\nspeech exhorting Italian leaders to fight against the advancing\nTurks. Here Ficino seems to have been teaching rhetoric and the\nart of declamation. Other instances in his writings appear to\nindicate that one meaning he and others associated with the word\n\u201cacademia\u201d was something close to \u201cgymnasium,\u201d\nor elementary school.\n\n\nIn the broadest sense, then, Ficino\u2019s \u201cacademy\u201d was not a\nspecific place but a mindset; and as tempting as it is for moderns to\nfit Ficino into a Platonic \u201csystem\u201d of philosophy (seen as\nin stark contrast to what is assumed to be an equally unitary\n\u201cAristotelian\u201d system), doing so would be deeply\nanachronistic. Like almost all late ancient Platonists and high\nmedieval thinkers, Ficino believed, for example, that one should start\nwith Aristotle, just he himself had done. In the letter mentioned\nabove, he listed, as an auditor, or student, a thinker named\nFrancesco Cattani da Diacceto, whom Ficino eventually considered his\nsuccessor. And in a letter written to that same Diacceto in July 1493,\nFicino stated a classic position (for which see Gerson): that\nphilosophy was such a broad enterprise that a division of labor was\nnecessary, and that \u201cwhoever rightly understands that natural\nmatters lead us to divine matters will realize that Peripatetic\nlearning represents the way toward Platonic wisdom, so that it has\ncome about that no one is ever admitted to the inner reaches of the\nPlatonic mysteries without first having been initiated into the\nPeripatetic branches of learning\u201d (Ficino 1576, 952). Truth was\none, philosophy was broad in its scope, and for people to realize the\ntruth and appreciate philosophy\u2019s reach, they needed to be trained\nproperly.\n",
