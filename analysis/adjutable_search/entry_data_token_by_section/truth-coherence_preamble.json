    "main_text": "\n\n\nA coherence theory of truth states that the truth of any (true)\nproposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of\npropositions. The coherence theory differs from its principal\ncompetitor, the correspondence theory of truth, in two essential\nrespects. The competing theories give conflicting accounts of the\nrelation that propositions bear to their truth conditions. (In this\narticle, \u2018proposition\u2019 is not used in any technical sense.\nIt simply refers to the bearers of truth values, whatever they may\nbe.)  According to one, the relation is coherence, according to the\nother, it is correspondence. The two theories also give conflicting\naccounts of truth conditions. According to the coherence theory, the\ntruth conditions of propositions consist in other propositions. The\ncorrespondence theory, in contrast, states that the truth conditions\nof propositions are not (in general) propositions, but rather\nobjective features of the world. (Even the correspondence theorist\nholds that propositions about propositions have propositions as their\ntruth conditions.) Although the coherence and correspondence theories\nare fundamentally opposed in this way, they both present (in contrast\nto deflationary theories of truth) a substantive conception of\ntruth. That is, unlike deflationary theories, the coherence and\ncorrespondence theories both hold that truth is a property of\npropositions that can be analysed in terms of the sorts of\ntruth-conditions propositions have, and the relations propositions\nstand in to these conditions. \n",
