    "main_text": "Literacy and The Oral Tradition in Sage Philosophy\n3. Literacy and The Oral Tradition in Sage Philosophy\n\nThe influence of colonial bias against unwritten thought was also\nchallenged by Oruka\u2019s project. By publishing his interviews with the\nsages he aimed to counter the second negative claim regarding the\ndenigration of African thought, namely that \u201cphilosophy is and\ncan only be a \u2018written\u2019 enterprise; and so a tradition\nwithout writing is incapabale of philosophy [and that any claim to the\ncontrary] \u2026is a non-scientific, mythological claim\u201d\n(Sage Philosophy, p.xv). He insisted that there are African\nthinkers, not yet absorbed into the tradition of the written word,\nwhose memories are, in terms of consistency and organization, as good\nas the information recorded in books (Sage Philosophy, pp.\n49\u201350). Responding to adversaries, he cautioned that:\n\nto argue like the critics, not just of Sage philosophy but of African\nphilosophy generally have done that Africa is having a late start in\nphilosophy just because we have no written records of her past\nphilosophical activities is, wrongfully, to limit the sources from\nwhich we could detect traces of such activities (Sage\nPhilosophy, p. 50).\n\n\nPeter Bodunrin was particularly critical of Oruka\u2019s method of\nextracting Sage Philosophy. He argued that to show that there were\npeople, like the indigenous sages, who were capable of philosophical\nthinking was one thing, but it was a completely different thing to\nshow that there were African philosophers who have engaged in\norganized systematic reflections on the traditions of their people.\nRegarding Bodunrin\u2019s first objection, Oruka\u2019s response, as already\nindicated above, was that philosophers often work in response to other\nideas, whether they are the ideas of other philosophers, or popular\nideas in the philosopher\u2019s own setting. Oruka had a relatively longer\nresponse to Bodunrin\u2019s second objection. In another essay popularly\nassociated with his name, Oruka identified four main trends to be\nconstitutive of African philosophy, namely (i) African\nethnophilosophy, (ii) African nationalist-ideological philosophy,\n(iii) professional African philosophy, and of course, (iv) the African\nSage philosophy under consideration here. Not only do these trends\nshow different approaches that African philosophers have adopted to\nunravel and systematically to expose the underlying principles on\nwhich different departments of African life are based, they also\ndemonstrate that African philosophy is not limited or confined to the\nacademic institutions.\n\nIndeed, many African philosophers look far beyond the traditional\nphilosophical texts for sources and subject matter of philosophical\nreflection. For example, while engaging in subtle analytic\nphilosophical reflections, African philosophers incorporate with great\nease narratives from everyday lives and from literature into their\nreflections of the philosophical implications of their cultural\nevents. Oruka was especially wary of the sub-group among professional\nAfrican philosophers whose position regarding African traditional\nmodes of thought was analogous to European bias in denying reason to\nAfricans in their traditional settings. It was this attitude,\naccording to Oruka, that amounted to a claim that Africans lacked a\ntradition of organized systematic philosophical reflections on the\nthoughts, beliefs, and practices of their own people. He thought that\nthis view was exemplified in its most eloquent and strongest form by\nPeter Bodunrin. In his (Oruka\u2019s) own estimation, Bodunrin had\nseriously underestimated the central point in the long tradition of\nWestern scholarship, popularized by the works of L\u00e9vy-Bruhl,\nthat denied Africans not only the existence of organized systematic\nphilosophical reflection, but reason itself. Oruka thought that this\nview was rather absurd, for no society of humans can live for any\nreasonable amount of time, let alone making any advances in their own\nways of seeing and doing things, if they do not have reason, or if the\nideas and concepts upon which their cultures are built do not make\nsense. If, on the other hand, critics of African Sage philosophy based\ntheir refutation of the possibility of sage philosophy on the lack of\nwritten philosophical treatises, Oruka countered such a position by\narguing that to exist as a philosopher it is not necessary that one\u2019s\nthoughts must be written, or that they must progress \u2014 meaning\nthat they must be commented on or even be available to future\ngenerations. While systematicity is important to the structure and\nconsistency of good thinking, neither it nor preservation of thought\nnecessarily requires literacy. Preservation in particular, he thought,\nwas done selectively by generations for divers emerging reasons and\ncircumstances, and so was not, in and of itself, the measure of the\nphilosophical quality of someone\u2019s thoughts. For just as thoughts can\nbe expressed either in writing, or as unwritten oral reflections,\ne.g., sayings and argumentations of sages, so they may be preserved\nfor a long time by sages, or quickly forgotten and cast into\nhistorically insignificant bits of a community\u2019s past, only to be\nremembered by the few whom they touched in some special way.\n\nOruka\u2019s position, as is also argued forcefully by Kwasi Wiredu,\nanother African philosopher and Oruka\u2019s contemporary, is that there is\nno harm in African philosophers\u2019 creative fusion of influences from\nother traditions into their critical evaluations of African beliefs\nand practices in different fields (\u201cThe Ghanaian Tradition of\nPhilosophy\u201d in Person and Community, p. 2). Such a fusion is\npart of bringing into focus the interplay between philosophy and\npractice. Oruka believed, as he explains in Trends in Contemporary\nAfrican Philosophy (pp. 17\u201318), that this is precisely what Kwame\nNkrumah (1964), L\u00e9opold S. Senghor (1962), and Julius K.\nNyerere (1968, 1968a), for example, had done in forming their\npolitical-philosophical positions (what Oruka calls \u201cideological\ntrends\u201d), all with different results.\n",
