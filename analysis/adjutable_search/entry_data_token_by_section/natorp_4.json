Pure,\nunconceptualized subjectivity is the immediate condition of the\npsyche; but the \u201clogos\u201d of science just means\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d. Hence, Natorp argues, there can be no\n\u201cpsycho-logy\u201d in the strict sense of the term, for it\nwould amount to the objectivation of subjectivity, and hence to the\nannihilation of the very thing a psychology would want to study: the\npsyche in its \u201cnatural\u201d state (cf. Natorp, 1887: 283).\nAlthough there is no \n\n\nimmediate access to the immediacy of psychic experience, [yet] it can\n\u2026 be approached by a [methodical] regression from its\nobjectivations, which must therefore [first] be secured in their own\npurely objective justification. (Natorp 1912c: 198) \n\n\nThis is \u201ccritical\u201d psychology in a nutshell. What Natorp\nmeans is this: there can be no objective \u201caccess\u201d\nto immediate psychic experience, which is absolute subjectivity.\nNonetheless, we can gain access to a mediated subjectivity,\nnamely through the objects that have already been objectivated in\n(scientific) thinking.\n\nThinking, as we saw in\n Section 4,\n moves forward in a \u201csynthetic\u201d fashion from the less to\nthe more determinate. That is, in taking up a second-order phenomenon,\nthinking works on an object that retains, qua appearance\n(phenomenon), an as yet undetermined subjective, doxastic residue. It\nbrings (some of) this residue under laws, thus determining the object\nfurther: it is now better known and scientifically understood. Now,\ninstead of seeking the constitutive legislative framework that\ntranscendentally \u201cgrounded\u201d that determination (the task\nof critical philosophy), critical psychology performs a\n\u201cmethodical regression\u201d, viz., by undoing the\nobject\u2019s most recent determinations, thus revealing its prior,\nrelatively more \u201csubjective\u201d phase.\n\nIn this way, Natorp thinks, antecedent stages of our latter-day\nscience can be reconstructed and temporarily resuscitated. This\nproject complements critical philosophy\u2019s logical project, by\nallowing reconstruction of successive phases of objectivity, thus\nmaking our current knowledge more transparent to reflective\n reason.[32]\n\n",
