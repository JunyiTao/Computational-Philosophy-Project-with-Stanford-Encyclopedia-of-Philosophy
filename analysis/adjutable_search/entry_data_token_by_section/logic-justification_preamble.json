You would almost \ncertainly not reply semantically, Hintikka-style, that Abraham \nLincoln was tall in all situations compatible with your knowledge. \nInstead you would more likely say, \u201cI read about Abraham \nLincoln\u2019s height in several books, and I have seen photographs of him\nnext to other people. \u201d One certifies knowledge by providing a \nreason, a justification. Hintikka semantics captures knowledge as \ntrue belief. Justification logics supply the missing third component \nof Plato\u2019s characterization of knowledge as justified true \nbelief.\n",
