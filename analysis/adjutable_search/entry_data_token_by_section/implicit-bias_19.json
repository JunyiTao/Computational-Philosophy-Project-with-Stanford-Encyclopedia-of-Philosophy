    "main_text": "Critical Responses || Structuralism\n5.4 Structuralism\n\n\nSo-called \u201cstructuralist\u201d critics (e.g.,\nBanks & Ford 2009; Anderson 2010;\nHaslanger 2015;\nAyala 2016, 2018; Mallon ms) have argued that researchers ought to pay\nmore attention to systemic and institutional causes of\ninjustice\u2014such as poverty, housing segregation, economic\ninequality, etc.\u2014rather than focusing on the biases inside the\nminds of individuals. One way to express the structuralist idea is that\nwhat happens in the minds of individuals, including their biases, is\nthe product of social inequities rather than an\nexplanation for them. Structuralists then tend to argue that\nour efforts to combat discrimination and inequity ought to focus on\nchanging social structures themselves, rather than trying to change\nindividual\u2019s biases directly. For example, Ayala argues that\n\u201cagents\u2019 mental states [are] \u2026 not necessary to\nunderstand and explain\u201d when considering social injustice (2016,\n9).\nLikewise, in her call to combat segregation in the contemporary United States, Anderson (2010)\nis critical of\nwhat she sees as a distracting focus on the psychology of bias.\n\n\nA strong version of the structuralist critique\u2014that research\non the psychology of prejudice is entirely useless, distracting, or\neven dangerous\u2014is hard to defend. Large-scale demographic\nresearch makes clear that psychological prejudice is a key driver of\n(for example) economic inequality (e.g.,\nChetty et al. 2018)\nand inequities in the criminal justice\nsystem\n(Center for Policing Equity 2016).\nMore\nbroadly, no matter how autonomously certain social structures operate,\npeople must choose to accept or reject those structures, to vote for\npoliticians who speak for or against them, and so on. How people assess\nthese options is at least in part a psychological question.\n\n\nA weaker version of the structuralist critique calls for needed\nattention to the ways in which psychological and structural phenomena\ninteract to produce and entrench discrimination and inequity. This\n\u201cinteractionism\u201d seeks to understand how bias operates\ndifferently in different contexts. If you wanted to combat housing\nsegregation, for example, you would want to consider not only\nproblematic institutional practices, such as \u201credlining\u201d\ncertain neighborhoods within which banks will not give mortgage loans,\nand not only psychological factors, such as the propensity to perceive\nlow-income people as untrustworthy, but the interaction of the\ntwo. A low-income person from a redlined neighborhood might not\nbe perceived as untrustworthy when they are interviewing for a job as a\nnanny, but might be perceived as untrustworthy when they are\ninterviewing for a loan. Adopting the view that bias and structure\ninteract to produce unequal outcomes does not mean that researchers\nmust always account for both. Sometimes it makes sense to\nemphasize one kind of cause or the other. \n\n\nAn interactionist version of structuralism can incorporate research\non prejudice into a wider understanding of inequity, rather than eschew\nit. One way to do so is to identify ways in which psychological biases\n(whether implicit or explicit) might be key contributors to\nsocial-structural phenomena. For example, structuralists sometimes\npoint to the drug laws and sentencing guidelines that contribute to the\nmass incarceration of black men in the USA as examples of systemic\nbiases. Sometimes, however, when these laws and policies change,\ndiscrimination persists. While arrests have declined for all racial\ngroups in states that have decriminalized marijuana, black people\ncontinue to be arrested for marijuana-related offenses at a rate of\nabout 10 times that of white people\n(Drug Policy Alliance 2018).\nThis suggests that psychological biases (belonging\nto officers, policy makers, or voters) are an ineliminable part of\nsystemic inequity. Such interactionism is just one approach for\nblending individual and institutional approaches to intergroup\ndiscrimination (see, e.g.,\nMadva\n2016a, 2017;\nDavidson & Kelly forthcoming). Another idea is to incorporate research\nspecifically on implicit bias into a wider understanding of the\nstructural sources of inequity by using implicit measures to assess\nbroad social patterns (rather than to assess the differences between\nindividuals). The \u201cBias of Crowds\u201d model (\u00a72.5) argues\nthat implicit bias is a feature of cultures and communities. For\nexample, average scores on implicit measures of prejudice and\nstereotypes, when aggregated at the level of cities within the United\nStates, predict racial disparities of shootings of citizens by police\nin those cities\n(Hehman\net al. 2017). Thus,\nwhile it is certainly true that most of the relevant literature and\ndiscussion conceptualizes implicit bias as way of differentiating\nbetween individuals, structuralists might utilize the data for\ndifferentiating regions, cultures, and so on.\n",
