    "main_text": "Introduction || Stuff, Things, Fundamentality and Reduction\n1.2 Stuff, Things, Fundamentality and Reduction\n\nThese debates are motivated by not just the linguistic data covered\nbelow, but by conflicting intuitions about the relation between\nobjects and their constituting matter. (See the entry on\n material constitution\n for more details.) Many make a strong case for an ontological\ndistinction between stuff (or matter) and things. Here are some\ntypical reasons given to believe in the distinction:\n\nSome stuff often has a different history than an object which it\nconstitutes. Invariably, the water that makes up a snowball pre-dates\nthe snowball.\nThe persistence of an object (e.g., a desk) is sensitive to the\ncontiguity of its parts. Some stuff (e.g., the wood), however, can\nsurvive many instances of spatial scatter.\nStuffs are cumulative, objects are not (Burge 1977,\np.\u2009104). For instance, any two portions of water, considered\ntogether, make up a portion of water that contains the first two\nportions as parts. But objects are not like this, e.g., two cars or\ncats do not make up a car or cat.\nStuffs are dissective, objects are not (Burge 1977, p.\u2009106)\nDivide up a (macroscopic) portion of water in half and you will be\nleft with water. Divide a flower in half, and you won\u2019t be left\nwith\n flowers.[6]\nExtended simple objects with no parts are possible. While there\nare no objects or things making up such objects, there is nevertheless\nstuff composing it. The parts do not pre-date the division of an\nextended simple, whereas the stuff does (Markosian 1998a; Scala\n2002).\n\n\nBut, if stuff and things are distinct, they must be intimately\nrelated. It is tempting to philosophers to try to reduce or eliminate\none of the categories and hold that only one category is\nfundamental (or \u2018ontologically basic,\u2019 i.e., it\nmust be mentioned in any true, comprehensive, and non-redundant\ndescription of the world).\n\nReflection can lead us to believe that a familiar object, such as a\ntree, is nothing more than some stuff in a certain arrangement. This\nstuff could have been in a different arrangement, possibly\nconstituting two smaller trees, or perhaps nothing at all. This raises\nthe possibility that stuff is more fundamental than things.\n\nBut, when we look closely at stuff, or listen to scientists, we see\nthat it is likely particulate, and, if particles are objects, then it\nappears that stuff is actually not fundamental after all\u2014objects\nare. Prima facie these positions cannot both be true, and our\nconflicting intuitions call for an explanation as to the relation\nbetween stuff and things.\n\nWhat are we talking about when we talk about stuff? We will first look\nat the three main answers given in\n section 2.\n The first answer, by far the most popular (and consequently receiving\nthe most attention), is that stuff-talk is talk about masses of\nparticles or molecules. The second is that stuff-talk is talk about\nsets, and, lastly, that it is talk about many things (or\n\u2018pluralities\u2019). The views in\n section 2,\n in one way or another, hold that stuff is very thing-like or\nreducible to things.\n\nIn\n section 3\n we will examine more radical views which say that the moral to draw\nfrom reflection upon concrete mass expressions, among other things, is\nthat the world consists of stuff, not things; or stuff in\naddition to things, where the former is not thing-like.\n",
