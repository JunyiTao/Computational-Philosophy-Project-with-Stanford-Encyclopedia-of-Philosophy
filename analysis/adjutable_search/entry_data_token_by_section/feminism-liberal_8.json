    "main_text": "Classical-Liberal Feminism || Cultural Libertarian Feminism\n2.3 Cultural Libertarian Feminism\n\nCultural libertarianism is a form of classical liberalism that is\n\n\nconcerned about constraints on individual freedom from government as\nwell as from traditionalist familial, religious, and community\ninstitutions\u2014the same civil institutions that conservatives see\nas necessary for ordered liberty to thrive. (C. Young 2007)\n\n\nCultural libertarian feminism holds that these institutions reflect\nthe patriarchal nature of society and oppress women. Thus cultural\nlibertarian feminism recognizes sources of women\u2019s oppression\nother than the state (Presley 2000; Long & Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n As Charles Johnson and Roderick Long put it, patriarchal culture and\nthe state are \u201cinterlocking systems of oppression\u201d (Long\n& Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n both of which should be opposed by feminists. They explain:\n\n\nThere is nothing inconsistent or un-libertarian in holding that\nwomen\u2019s choices under patriarchal social structures can be\nsufficiently \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in the libertarian sense, to be\nentitled to immunity from coercive legislative interference, while at\nthe same time being sufficiently \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d in a\nbroader sense, to be recognized as morally problematic and as a\nlegitimate target of social activism. (Long & Johnson\n2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nCalling this view \u201canarchist feminism\u201d, Sharon Presley\nwrites: \u201cWhat the anarchist feminists are calling for is a\nradical restructuring of society, both in its public and private\ninstitutions\u201d (Presley 2000). Such feminists hold that much of\nthe oppression women currently suffer is noncoercive, however. Laws\nagainst prostitution are coercive\u2014the state can put a violator\nin jail or force her to pay a fine. But on the cultural libertarian\nfeminist view much of the pressure to conform to gender roles is not\ncoercive. Noncoercive oppression can be resisted, although it is often\nnot easy to do so. Cultural libertarian feminists hold that\nnoncoercive oppression should not be remedied by the state (see also\nTomasi 2009). As Presley and Kinsky explain, on the cultural\nlibertarian view, to try to remedy the noncoercive oppression of women\nwith coercive state action \u201cjust changes the sort of oppression,\nnot the fact\u201d (Presley & Kinsky 1991: 78). This oppression\nshould be opposed by a nonviolent movement for feminist social\nchange.\n\nCultural libertarian feminists target the patriarchal culture by, for\nexample, developing in individuals (especially women) the ability to\nbe independent. This involves enabling individuals to resist authority\nand think for themselves (Presley 2001). Cultural libertarian\nfeminists also recommend the development of more deeply consensual\nrelationships and institutions (Heckert 2004\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n relationships and institutions in which there is an equality of\nauthority (Long 2001\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n While some equity feminists (see\n \u00a71.2)\n would applaud this work, they would call it \u201cpersonal\u201d,\nreserving the term \u201cpolitical\u201d for the work of securing\nfor women their right against coercive interference. Equity feminist\nWendy McElroy writes:\n\n\nI understand that there is a cultural form of feminism and many women\nwould still fight for improved prestige or status, and I\nwouldn\u2019t criticis[e] them for doing so. It just wouldn\u2019t\ngrip me. Guess I\u2019m a political animal after all. (McElroy\n1998c\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nBut cultural libertarian feminists consider this work to be an\nintegral part of a larger political struggle for women\u2019s\nfreedom.\n",
