    "main_text": "Metaphysics Naturalized || Method: Regimented Theory\n5.1 Method: Regimented Theory\n\nHow does Quine think we should establish the sort of claims that we\nare calling \u201cmetaphysical\u201d? Some points are familiar from\nour discussion in section 2. First, we do not resort to any special\nkind of philosophical insight. Second, what matters is ordinary\nknowledge as refined and improved upon: science. Third, we rely upon\nthe idea of regimented theory, science formulated in a language that\nis clarified and simplified \u201cbeyond what might reasonably be\nurged upon the practicing scientist\u201d (1957, 235; see 2.4,\nabove). We rely upon ordinary usage where no better is to hand, but\naccept changes that are improvements (see 1960, 3). A further point is\nthat in striving for the clarity and simplicity of our theory we must\nconsider the whole theory; local gains may be offset by global losses.\nIt is thus to overall regimented theory that we look when we are\n\u201climning the true and ultimate structure of reality\u201d\n(1960, 221).\n\nWhat is Quine\u2019s justification for relying on the idea of\nregimented theory, rather than on our ordinary conceptual scheme? (Cf.\nStrawson, 1959, Introduction.) One part of the answer is that just as\nscience is in the same line of business as ordinary knowledge, but\ndoes it better, so regimented language is in the same business as\nordinary language, but does it better. Regimentation, that is to say,\nis not the imposition of a wholly foreign language; it is the adoption\nof a language that maximizes scientific virtues already partially\npresent in ordinary speech\u2014logical structure, reference, the\nready amenability to algorithmic methods. But another part of the\nanswer is the idea that \u201cour ordinary conceptual scheme\u201d\ndoes not pick out anything definite enough to answer metaphysical\nquestions. Thus Quine says: \u201c\u2026a fenced ontology is just\nnot implicit in ordinary language\u2026. Ontological concern is not\na correction of a lay thought and practice; it is foreign to the lay\nculture, though an outgrowth of it.\u201d (1981, 9).\n\nRegimentation, in Quine\u2019s view, involves paraphrase into logical\nnotation. Such paraphrase greatly clarifies and simplifies our theory.\nInferences which are a matter of logic will be revealed as such; where\nadditional assumptions are required it will be explicit just what is\nneeded. The logic which Quine takes as the structure of regimented\ntheory is classical (bivalent) first-order logic with identity.\nBivalence is justified on the grounds of simplicity. It is not that we\nhave some independent insight into the nature of the world which shows\nus that every sentence of regimented theory is either true or false.\nIt is, rather, that the simplicity that we gain from making this\nassumption, justifies our using a bivalent language; the metaphysical\nclaim follows along. (This reversal of direction should remind us of\nCarnap. The difference is that Quine does not accept the Principle of\nTolerance; see section 3, above.)\n\nQuine\u2019s choice of first-order logic, rather than second-order\nlogic, has been more controversial than his adoption of bivalence. One\nreason he gives for the decision is that every formalization of\nsecond-order logic (unlike first-order logic) is incomplete, relative\nto the standard semantics. A further reason is that one purpose of the\ncanonical framework is to enable us to assess the ontology of a\ntheory. From this point of view it is an advantage that first-order\nlogic has no ontological presuppositions of its own. (By adopting that\nlogic we do commit ourselves to there being some object or other, but\nnot to the existence of any particular entity.) Here again there is a\nclear contrast with second-order logic, which does have ontological\npresuppositions. Exactly what those presuppositions are is unclear,\nand has been debated; for Quine, this unclarity is a further reason to\navoid the subject entirely.\n\nParaphrasing a theory into classical logic imposes extensionality on\nit: a predicate may be replaced by a co-extensive predicate without\nchange of truth-value of the containing sentence; likewise an embedded\nsentence by a sentence of the same\n truth-value.[3]\n Extensionality imposes quite severe restrictions. It requires, for\nexample, that attributions of belief, and other propositional\nattitudes, be regimented into a form quite different from that which\nthey may appear to have. (For this reason, the commitment to\nextensionality is quite controversial; see F\u00f8llesdal 1986 and\nKaplan 1968, 1986.) So one might suppose that Quine accepts\nextensionality reluctantly, as the price to be paid for the advantages\nof the use of logic in regimenting theory. Such is not his attitude,\nhowever. To the contrary, he thinks of the clarity that extensionality\nbrings as a great advantage, and of theories that lack it as not fully\ncomprehensible: \u201cI find extensionality necessary, indeed, though\nnot sufficient, for my full understanding of a theory.\u201d (1995,\n90f.)\n",
