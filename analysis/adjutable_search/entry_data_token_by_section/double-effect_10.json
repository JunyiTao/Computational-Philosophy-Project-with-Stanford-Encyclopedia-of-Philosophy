    "main_text": "End of Life Decision-Making || Pain Relief in Palliative Care\n5.1 Pain Relief in Palliative Care\n\nThe principle of double effect is often mentioned in discussions of\nwhat is known as palliative care, medical care for patients with\nterminal illness in need of pain relief. Double effect is cited as a\njustification for the view that it is permissible to administer opioid\ndrugs to relieve the suffering of a terminally ill patient, foreseeing\nthat the hastening of death will occur as a side effect. Double effect\nreasoning in this context seems to express the compassionate view that\nphysicians may not intend to cause the death of a patient, but may\naccept that actions intended to relieve pain might hasten death. Three\nassumptions often operate in the background of these discussions:\n\nIt would be impermissible to administer an opioid drug in a dose\nhigh enough to hasten the patient\u2019s death in order to cut short\nthe suffering of a terminally ill patient in the process of\ndying.\nThe side effect of hastening death is an inevitable or at least\nlikely result of the administration of an opioid drug in order to\nrelieve the pain of a terminally ill patient.\nThe hastening of death is a not unwelcome side effect of providing\npain relief in the context of palliative care.\n\n\nIf the first assumption is not made, double effect has no explanatory\nrole to play. Those who appeal to double effect in this context must\nalso assume that it would be impermissible to hasten the death\nintentionally of a terminally ill patient whom one was\ntreating with opioids for pain in order to shorten the process of\ndying. If one believes that this is permissible, then double effect is\nnot needed to explain its permissibility.\n\nThe second assumption is false. Physicians and researchers have\ninsisted repeatedly that it is a myth that opioids administered for\npain relief can be expected to hasten death (Sykes and Thorns, 2003\nprovide a review of a large number of studies supporting this claim).\nThere is no research that substantiates the claim that opioid drugs\nadministered appropriately and carefully titrated are likely to\ndepress respiration. In a survey of research bearing on this issue,\nSusan Anderson Fohr (1998) concludes: \u201cIt is important to\nemphasize that there is no debate among specialists in palliative care\nand pain control on this issue. There is a broad consensus that when\nused appropriately, respiratory depression from opioid analgesics is a\nrarely occurring side effect. The belief that palliative care hastens\ndeath is counter to the experience of physicians with the most\nexperience in this area.\u201d The mistaken belief that pain relief\nwill have the side effect of hastening death may have the unfortunate\neffect of leading physicians, patients, and the patients\u2019\nfamilies to under-treat pain because they are apprehensive about\ncausing this allegedly inevitable side effect.\n\nThe third claim \u2013 that the hastening of death is not unwelcome\nin these circumstances \u2013 ignores the role of the patient and the\npatient\u2019s medical proxy in assessing whether hastening death is\na desirable result. It represents the physician\u2019s role as one\nthat does not require consultation with the patient or the\npatient\u2019s proxy or attention to advance directives for guidance.\nIf hastening the death of a patient with a terminal condition is\ndesirable according to the patient or the patient\u2019s proxy, then\nmany thoughtful people would view the first assumption to be false: it\nwould be permissible to intend to relieve pain while also intending to\nhasten the death of a terminally ill patient (see Allmark, Cobb,\nLiddle, and Todd 2010; Kamm 1999; Quinn 1989, 343, n.17; McIntyre\n2004). On the other hand, if the hastening of death is not desirable\naccording to the patient or the patient\u2019s proxy, it is not\npermissible to hasten death in the course of treating pain, especially\nsince hastening death is neither likely nor inevitable when treating\npain. Patients receiving palliative care whose pain can be adequately\ntreated with opioid drugs may well value additional days, hours or\nminutes of life as they look forward to meetings with family members.\nA physician\u2019s duty of compassion does not override the\npatient\u2019s preferences in such a weighty matter. The apparently\ncompassionate assumption that the hastening of death is a desirable\nresult when a patient is being treated for pain is unduly\npaternalistic in this context.\n\nNote that if the physician views the hastening of death as something\nthat would be good for the patient, and the patient or the\npatient\u2019s proxy agrees, then even a secular version of double\neffect does not apply to this situation: the hastening of death would\nbe a benefit for the patient, not a harm. As the discussion in\nSection 1 (Formulations) has shown, any plausible\nformulation of double effect would require agents to seek to minimize\nor avoid the merely foreseen harms that they cause as side effects. On\nthis point, popular understandings of double effect reasoning at the\nend of life, with the third assumption in place, diverge from what the\nprinciple assumes: the popular understanding of double effect might\ninvolve the assumption that hastening death is a merciful act and not\na harm to be avoided.\n\nNote that a variety of substantive medical and ethical judgments\nprovide the justificatory context for this example: the patient is\nterminally ill, there is an urgent need to relieve pain and suffering,\ndeath is imminent, and we can now add that the condition that the\npatient or the patient\u2019s proxy consents. The consent of the\npatient or the patient\u2019s proxy is not naturally classified as a\nconcern with proportionality, understood as the physician\u2019s\nweighing of harms and benefits.\n",
