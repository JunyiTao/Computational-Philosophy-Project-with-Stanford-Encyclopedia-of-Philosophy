We live in\nsocieties, and plausibly we need to do so in order to cope with the\nmany problems and issues we face in meeting our needs and pursuing our\nvalues, as well as to enhance our opportunities, and to allow us to\ndevote time and attention to developing our talents. This means we are\nfaced with a generic problem, the \u201cproblem of sociality\u201d,\nwhich arises because there are sources of conflict and disagreement\nthat can interfere with our ability to live successfully in societies.\nSocieties do better at coping with this generic problem when their\nmembers share a moral code that calls for them to cooperate with one\nanother, to avoid force and fraud, and, generally, and with\nqualifications, not to interfere with one another.\n\nTo the extent that we are autonomous, in a familiar sense of that\nterm, we pursue what we need, and we aim to realize our values. Yet\neach of us has a tendency to fail to be resolute in this pursuit, to\nsuccumb to temptation by immediate pleasures, to fail to give enough\nweight to future goods or to present risks. This is a generic problem,\nthe \u201cproblem of autonomy\u201d, and we do better at coping with\nit if we subscribe to a standard or a norm requiring us, roughly, to\nefficiently pursue what we need and value. If our psychology and our\nstrivings are well regulated by such a norm, we are\n\u201crational\u201d, and we enhance our autonomy.\n\nIn both of these cases, and others, there is a generic problem that we\ndo better at coping with if we (or enough of us) subscribe to norms or\nstandards with a content well-suited to addressing the problem.\nPluralist teleology begins with this idea and uses it, first, to\ndevelop an account of the truth conditions of normative propositions\nof morality (Copp 2007, 2009), prudential rationality (Copp 2007: chap\n10), and epistemology (Copp 2014), and second, to develop an account\nof normativity (Copp 2015). This account says, roughly, that normative\nfacts of a given kind are grounded in the content of the system of\nstandards that would best address the corresponding problem of\nnormative governance. This view is another example of mind-independent\nnormative realism and of reductive normative naturalism.\n\nThere are things to worry about. One might worry that this approach\nseems unable to make sense of the idea that, when morality and\nprudential rationality come into conflict, there might be something\nthat one ought to do \u201call-things-considered\u201d (Copp 2020c).\nOne might also worry that normativity is smuggled into the rankings of\nnorms on the basis of how well-suited they are to enabling us to cope\nwith a problem of normative governance. If so, the account might not\nbe a successful constitutive explanation of normativity. One might\nalso worry that the view implies that it is a contingent matter\nwhether certain unsettling moral claims are true (Copp 2020b).\n",
