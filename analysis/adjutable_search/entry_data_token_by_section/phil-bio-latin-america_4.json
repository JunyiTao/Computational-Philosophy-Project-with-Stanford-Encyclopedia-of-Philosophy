    "main_text": "The Problem of Race\n3. The Problem of Race\n\nDue to the persistent occurrence of the term \u201crace\u201d in\ndifferent fields, as well as the consequent social presence of\nracialized expressions and thought, the discussion around human races\nremains current in philosophy of biology in Latin American. The\nso-called \u201cproblem of race\u201d persists due to the continued\nexistence of racial discrimination, such that there is an intertwining\nbetween the social problem of domination by the elites, most of whom\nare white or \u201cwhitened\u201d, and the behavior of racial\ncontempt by these elites that becomes hegemonic, regardless of whether\nthese elites discursively deny such behavior.\n\nPhilosophical reflection is aware of the moral, political, and legal\nimplications of the concept(s) of race and their analysis, as well as\nof other issues such as ethnicity (Gracia 2000, 2005, 2008;\nJaksi\u0107 2015). This discussion is carried out through\nphilosophical reflection on biology and from the point of view of\nhistory, biological and social anthropology, ethnography, sociology,\npolitical science, and law (Wade et al. 2014a, 2015).\n\nContemporary philosophical reflections on race are mainly carried out\nin two closely related fields: first, the analysis of the concept(s)\nof race, with emphasis on their ontological aspects; and second, the\nanalysis of the theoretical and empirical aspects of certain\nbiological practices, especially genomics and genetic ancestry, as\nwell as genomic medicine and, to a lesser extent forensic genetics,\nwhich would appear to the non-expert to reintroduce race-like\ncategories.\n",
