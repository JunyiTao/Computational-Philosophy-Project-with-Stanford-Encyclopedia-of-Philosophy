    "main_text": "Varieties of Anarchism || Political Anarchism\n1.1 Political Anarchism\n\nAnarchism is primarily understood as a skeptical theory of political\nlegitimation. The term anarchism is derived from the negation of the\nGreek term arch\u00e9, which means first principle,\nfoundation, or ruling power. Anarchy is thus rule by no one or\nnon-rule. Some argue that non-ruling occurs when there is rule by\nall\u2014with consensus or unanimity providing an optimistic goal\n(see Depuis-D\u00e9ri 2010).\n\nPolitical anarchists focus their critique on state power, viewing\ncentralized, monopolistic coercive power as illegitimate. Anarchists\nthus criticize \u201cthe state\u201d. Bakunin provides a paradigm\nhistorical example, saying:\n\n\nIf there is a State, there must be domination of one class by another\nand, as a result, slavery; the State without slavery is\nunthinkable\u2014and this is why we are the enemies of the State.\n(Bakunin 1873 [1990: 178])\n\n\nA more recent example comes from Gerard Casey who writes,\n\u201cstates are criminal organizations. All states, not just the\nobviously totalitarian or repressive ones\u201d (Casey 2012: 1).\n\nSuch sweeping generalizations are difficult to support. Thus anarchism\nas political philosophy faces the challenge of specificity. States\nhave been organized in various ways. Political power is not\nmonolithic. Sovereignty is a complicated matter that includes\ndivisions and distributions of power (see Fiala 2015). Moreover, the\nhistorical and ideological context of a given anarchist\u2019s\ncritique makes a difference in the content of the political\nanarchist\u2019s critique. Bakunin was responding primarily to a\nMarxist and Hegelian view of the state, offering his critique from\nwithin the global socialist movement; Casey is writing in the\nTwenty-First Century in the era of liberalism and globalization,\noffering his critique from within the movement of contemporary\nlibertarianism. Some anarchists engage in broad generalizations,\naiming for a total critique of political power. Others will present a\nlocalized critique of a given political entity. An ongoing challenge\nfor those who would seek to understand anarchism is to realize how\nhistorically and ideologically diverse approaches fit under the\ngeneral anarchist umbrella. We look at political anarchism in detail\nbelow.\n",
