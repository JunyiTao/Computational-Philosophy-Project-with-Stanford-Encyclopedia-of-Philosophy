    "main_text": "Mathematical Fictionalism || Central features of mathematical fictionalism\n3.1 Central features of mathematical fictionalism\nIn a series of works, Hartry Field provided an ingenious strategy\nfor the nominalization of science (Field 1980, 1989). As opposed to\nplatonist views, in order to explain the usefulness of mathematics in\nscience, Field does not postulate the truth of mathematical\ntheories. In his view, it is possible to explain successful\napplications of mathematics with no commitment to mathematical\nobjects. Therefore, what he takes to be the main argument for\nplatonism, which relies on the (apparent) indispensability of\nmathematics to science, is resisted. The nominalist nature of Field's\naccount emerges from the fact that mathematical objects are not\nassumed to exist. Hence, mathematical theories are false. (Strictly\nspeaking, Field notes, any existential mathematical statement is\nfalse, and any universal mathematical statement is vacuously true.) By\ndevising a strategy that shows how to dispense with mathematical\nobjects in the formulation of scientific theories, Field rejects the\nindispensability argument, and provides strong grounds for the\narticulation of a nominalist stance.\nPrima facie, it may sound counterintuitive to state that\n\u2018there are infinitely many prime numbers\u2019 is false. But if\nnumbers do not exist, that's the proper truth-value for that statement\n(assuming a standard semantics). In response to this concern, Field\n1989 introduces a fictional operator, in terms of which verbal\nagreement can be reached with the platonist. In the case at hand, one\nwould state: \u2018According to arithmetic, there are infinitely many\nprime numbers\u2019, which is clearly true. Given the use of a\nfictional operator, the resulting view is often\ncalled mathematical fictionalism.\nThe nominalization strategy devised by the mathematical\nfictionalist depends on two interrelated moves. The first is to change\nthe aim of mathematics, which is not taken to be truth, but something\ndifferent. On this view, the proper norm of mathematics, which will\nguide the nominalization program, is conservativeness. A\nmathematical theory is conservative if it is consistent with every\ninternally consistent theory about the physical world, where such\ntheories do not involve any reference to, nor quantification over,\nmathematical objects, such as sets, functions, numbers etc. (Field\n1989, p. 58). Conservativeness is stronger than consistency (since if\na theory is conservative, it is consistent, but not vice\nversa). However, conservativeness is not weaker than truth (Field\n1980, pp. 16\u201319; Field 1989, p. 59). So, Field is not\ncountenancing a weaker aim of mathematics, but only\na different one.\nIt is precisely because mathematics is conservative that, despite\nbeing false, it can be useful. Of course, this usefulness is explained\nwith no commitment to mathematical entities: mathematics is useful\nbecause it shortens our derivations. After all, if a mathematical\ntheory M is conservative, then a nominalistic\nassertion A about the physical world (i.e. an assertion which\ndoes not refer to mathematical objects) follows from a body N\nof such assertions and M only if it follows from N\nalone. That is, provided we have a sufficiently rich body of\nnominalistic assertions, the use of mathematics does not yield any new\nnominalistic consequences. Mathematics is only a useful instrument to\nhelp us in the derivations.\nAs a result, conservativeness can only be employed to do the\nrequired job if we have nominalistic premises to start with (Field\n1989, p. 129). As Field points out, it is a confusion to argue against\nhis view by claiming that if we add some bits of mathematics to a\nbody of mathematical claims (not nominalistic ones), we may\nobtain new consequences that could not be achieved otherwise (Field\n1989, p. 128). The restriction to nominalistic assertions is\ncrucial.\nThe second move of the mathematical fictionalist strategy is to\nprovide such nominalistic premises. Field has done that in one\nimportant case: Newtonian gravitational theory. He elaborates on a\nwork that has a respectable tradition: Hilbert's axiomatization of\ngeometry (Hilbert 1971). What Hilbert provided was a synthetic\nformulation of geometry, which dispenses with metric concepts, and\ntherefore does not include any quantification over real numbers. His\naxiomatization was based on concepts such\nas point, betweenness,\nand congruence. Intuitively speaking, we say that a\npoint y is between the points x and z\nif y is a point in the line-segment whose endpoints\nare x and z. Also intuitively, we say that the\nline-segment xy is congruent to the\nline-segment zw if the distance from the point x to the\npoint y is the same as that from the point z\nto w. After studying the formal properties of the resulting\nsystem, Hilbert proved a representation theorem. He showed, in a\nstronger mathematical theory, that given a model of the axiom system\nfor space he had put forward, there is a function d from pairs\nof points onto non-negative real numbers such that the following\n\u2018homomorphism conditions\u2019 are met:\n\nxy is congruent to zw iff d(x, y) = d(z,w), for all points x, y, z, and w;\ny is between x and z iff d(x, y) + d(y, z) = d(x, z), for all points x, y, and z.\n\nAs a result, if the function d is taken to represent\ndistance, we obtain the expected results about congruence and\nbetweenness. Thus, although we cannot talk about numbers in Hilbert's\ngeometry (there are no such entities to quantify over), there is a\nmetatheoretic result that associates assertions about distances with\nwhat can be said in the theory. Field calls such numerical\nclaims abstract counterparts of purely geometric assertions,\nand they can be used to draw conclusions about purely geometrical\nclaims in a smoother way. Indeed, because of the representation\ntheorem, conclusions about space, statable without real\nnumbers, can be drawn far more easily than we could achieve by a\ndeflationary proof from Hilbert's axioms. This illustrates Field's\npoint that the usefulness of mathematics derives from shortening\nderivations (Field 1980, pp. 24\u201329).\nRoughly speaking, what Field established was how to extend\nHilbert's results about space to space-time. Similarly to Hilbert's\napproach, instead of formulating Newtonian laws in terms of numerical\nfunctors, Field showed that they can be recast in terms of comparative\npredicates. For example, instead of adopting a functor such as\n\u2018the gravitational potential of x\u2019, which is taken\nto have a numerical value, Field employed a comparative predicate such\nas \u2018the difference in gravitational potential between x\nand y is less than that between z\nand w\u2019. Relying on a body of representation theorems\n(which plays the same role as Hilbert's representation theorem in\ngeometry), Field established how several numerical functors can be\n\u2018obtained\u2019 from comparative predicates. But in order to\nuse those theorems, he first showed how to formulate Newtonian\nnumerical laws (such as, Poisson's equation for the gravitational\nfield) only in terms of comparative predicates. The result (Field\n1989, pp. 130\u2013131) is the following extended representation\ntheorem. Let N be a theory formulated only in terms of\ncomparative predicates (with no recourse to numerical functors). For\nany model S of N whose domain is constituted by\nspace-time regions, there exists:\n\nA 1\u20131 spatio-temporal co-ordinate function f (unique up to a generalized Galilean transformation) mapping the space-time of S onto quadruples of real numbers;\nA mass density function g (unique up to a positive multiplicative transformation) mapping the space-time of S onto an interval of non-negative real numbers; and\nA gravitational potential function h (unique up to a positive linear transformation) mapping the space-time onto an interval of real numbers.\n\nMoreover, all these functions \u2018preserve structure\u2019, in\nthe sense that the comparative relations defined in terms of them\ncoincide with the comparative relations used in N. Furthermore,\nif f, g and h are taken as the denotation of the\nappropriate functors, the laws of Newtonian gravitational theory in\ntheir functorial form hold.\nNotice that, in quantifying over space-time regions, Field assumes\na substantivalist view of space-time, according to which there are\nspace-time regions that are not fully occupied (Field 1980,\npp. 34\u201336; Field 1989, pp. 171\u2013180). Given this result,\nthe mathematical fictionalist is allowed to draw nominalistic\nconclusions from premises involving N plus a mathematical\ntheory T. After all, due to the conservativeness of\nmathematics, such conclusions can be obtained independently\nof T. The role of the extended representation theorem is then\nto establish that, despite the lack of quantification over\nmathematical objects, precisely the same class of models is determined\nby formulating Newtonian gravitational theory in terms of functors (as\nthe theory is usually expressed) or in terms of comparative predicates\n(as the mathematical fictionalist favors). Thus, the extended\nrepresentation theorem ensures that the use of conservativeness of\nmathematics together with suitable nominalistic claims (formulated via\ncomparative predicates) does not change the class of models of the\noriginal theory: the same comparative relations are preserved. Hence,\nwhat Field provided is a nominalization strategy, and since it reduces\nontology, it seems a promising candidate for a nominalist\nstance vis-\u00e0-vis mathematics.\nHow should the mathematical fictionalist approach physical\ntheories, such as perhaps string theory, that do not seem to be about\nconcrete observable objects? One possible response, assuming the lack\nof empirical import of such theories, is simply to reject that they\nare physical theories, and as such they are not the sorts of\ntheories for which the mathematical fictionalist needs to provide a\nnominalistic counterpart. In other words, until the moment in which\nsuch theories acquire the relevant empirical import, they need not\nworry the mathematical fictionalist. Theories of that sort would be\nclassified as part of the mathematics rather than the physics.\n",
