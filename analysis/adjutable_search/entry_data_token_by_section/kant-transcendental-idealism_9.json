    "main_text": "Kant as a Phenomenalist || Appearances = representations?\n3.1 Appearances = representations?\n\nWhile the identity phenomenalist interpretation has found few\ndefenders among contemporary readers (Guyer 1987: 333\u2013336 is a\nnotable exception; for critical discussion, see Allison 2004:\n8\u20139), it is worth asking why exactly we should reject the\nprima facie meaning of the numerous passages in which Kant\nequates appearances with representations.\n\nPerhaps the best reason to reject the identity phenomenalist\ninterpretation is that it is incompatible with many of the very texts\nthat are used to motivate it (there is also the lingering problem of\nwhether it is compatible with the \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d; see\n section 2.4.\n and part IV of Guyer 1987). In many of the texts in which Kant\nidentifies appearances with (a species of) representations, he also\nclaims that representations are representations of\nappearances, i.e., that representations are representations of\nobjects, appearances. For instance,\n\n\n[\u2026] external objects (bodies) are merely appearances, hence\nalso nothing other than a species of my representations, whose objects\nare something only through these representations, but are nothing\nseparated from them. (A370\u20131)\n\neverything intuited in space or in time, hence all objects of an\nexperience possible for us, are nothing but appearances, i.e., mere\nrepresentations, which, as they are represented, as extended beings or\nseries of alterations, have outside our thoughts no existence grounded\nin itself (A490\u20131/B518\u20139; Allison (2004: 36) attempts to\nexplain away the apparently phenomenalist implications of this\npassage)\n\n\nIn both passages, Kant describes appearances as representations but\nalso as objects of representation. If this is correct, then\nKant thinks that the sense in which an appearance is a\nrepresentation is compatible with it being the object of a\nrepresentation. For instance, the sense in which this table\n\u201cis\u201d a representation is compatible with it being the\nobject of my perception of it. Assuming that the\nrepresentations that empirical objects \u201care\u201d are not\nalways self-representational (e.g., the table is not identical to a\ntable-ish visual perception that also represents itself), it follows\nthat the objects cannot be identical to our representations of them.\nFor instance, my visual perception of this table cannot be\nthis table, because my visual perception does not (presumably)\nrepresent itself. To make the identity phenomenalist view consistent\nwith the very texts that motivate it, we need to \u201cdouble\u201d\nour representations: a visual perception of the table and then the\nrepresentation that the table is. But what could that representation\nbe? It must be present when and only when the table exists (because\nthey are identical), and my perception of the table must be\nintentionally directed at it. While this is not conclusive,\nit is evidence that the identity phenomenalist interpretation should\nbe abandoned.\n\nIs there any way to free Kant from the apparent consequences of his\ntendency to identify appearances with representations of them? One\nstandard strategy is to say that Kant is simply being sloppy: he means\nthat appearances are the objects of our representations, not that they\nliterally are those\n representations.[25]\n However, the passages in question occur throughout the\nCritique, in both editions, and they remain after Feder-Garve\npointed out their apparently phenomenalist implications. On the other\nhand, their persistence in the B Edition suggests that they do not,\nand never were intended to, commit Kant to a form of identity\nphenomenalism. How could Kant claim Feder-Garve had misunderstood him\nif he had identified appearances with representations? This suggests\nthat another reading is possible, but does not tell us what it is.\n\nOne strategy would be to claim that Kant does not mean the\n\u201cis\u201d of identity, but the \u201cis\u201d of grounding.\nSometimes, apparent claims of identity are really claims about\ngrounding relations. For instance, if I say \u201cpain is C-fiber\nfiring\u201d I might mean the type-identity thesis that the state of\nbeing in pain is the state of C-fiber firing. But I might also mean\nthat all there is to pain is C-fiber firing, that if one is in pain it\nis in virtue of C-fiber firing, or that C-fiber firing non-causally\ngrounds the state of being in pain. On this view, in claiming that\nappearances are representations, Kant is claiming that the\ncontents of representations ground the existence and empirical\nproperties of appearances.\n\nBut this is not the plain meaning of the relevant passages. At A371\nKant claims that appearances are a species (Art) of\nrepresentations; while \u201cis\u201d can be interpreted in a number\nof ways (e.g., the \u201cis\u201d of constitution), it is hard to\ninterpret \u201cAs are a species of Bs\u201d in\nany other way than: every A is a B, which means\nevery A is identical to a B (namely, itself). While\nthere may be something to the \u201cgrounding\u201d interpretation\nof these passages, there are good reasons to think these texts have\nnot been explained (or explained away).\n\nA third alternative, proposed by Wilfred Sellars, and which may\nultimately face the same problem, relies on the Cartesian distinction\nbetween the formal and objective reality of representations (in\nCartesian terminology,\n ideas).[26]\n The objective reality of an idea is the representational character of\nthe idea, its character as a representation with a certain content.\nConsequently, we can talk about the object of an idea without assuming\nthat there is an object \u201cexternal\u201d to the idea; to talk of\nthe \u201cinternal\u201d object of the idea is just to talk about\nthat idea\u2019s objective reality. For instance, we can coherently\ntalk about God without presupposing that God exists\n\u201coutside\u201d our idea of him; this God-talk is to be\nunderstood as talk about our idea of God in its objective realty,\ni.e., to talk about the content of our God-idea. Translating this back\ninto Kant, we might take his claims that appearances are\nrepresentations as claims to the effect that appearances are\nrepresentations considered in their objective reality, or, in\nother words, that talking about appearances, objects of\nrepresentations, is just talking about representations and their\ncontents.\n\nThere are at least two problems with this strategy, however. For one,\nit is arguably no less a distortion of the plain letter of the text\nthan the other interpretations. If Kant meant that appearances are\nrepresentations considered with respect to their objective\nreality why didn\u2019t he simply say that, rather than stating\nthat they are a species of representations? Secondly, it is\nfar from clear that, on Kant\u2019s view, talk about\nappearances is equivalent to talk about the objective reality\nof representations. Kant may not be attempting a semantic analysis of\nappearances in terms of representations. To many readers, it has\nseemed more plausible to read Kant as claiming that appearances are\ngrounded (non-semantically) in representations and their\nobjective reality (content). So this proposal may collapse into the\nprevious one.\n",
