    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Sexual Identity\n1.5 Sexual Identity\n\nThe concept of \u201cidentity\u201d is a philosophical minefield:\nidentity can be descriptive or normative; public or personal; with\nexplanatory power or inert. The distinction between first person and\nthird person attributions of identity helps us see this. When Amy\nasserts that she is gay, she could be describing herself (informing\nsomeone of who she is); she could be asserting a political or cultural\nposition, especially if the identity in question is threatened by the\npowers that be (\u201cI am gay,\u201d uttered as a way of resisting\noppression); or she could be making sense of herself, either to\nherself or to others: \u201cI am gay\u201d helps Amy see herself or\nothers see her more coherently. Third parties can make the same\nassertion about Amy in any of these ways.\n\nThe second and third ways are interesting because they allow both\nchoice with respect to the identity and disagreement about its\nassertion. Amy can choose to adopt, be indifferent to, or reject the\nidentity of being gay, and she can choose to use it (or not) to make\nsense of herself. She might fail to identify with her homosexuality\nbecause it is not important to her, because she does not find gay\ncultural ways appealing, because she does not think highly of gays,\nbecause she is ashamed, because she is religious, etc. This allows for\nhealthy disagreements with Amy\u2019s decisions. And Marcia, a\nstraight woman, might be wrong to assert her straight identity in a\nclimate in which gay people are oppressed, much like a person might be\nwrong to assert his white identity in a racist society, also allowing\nfor disagreements with her (see Alcoff 2006, esp. pt. I; Andler 2021;\nAppiah 2005, ch. 3; Halwani 2006; Lance & Tanesini 2000; Ozturk\n2017; Wilkerson 2007). In this way, it becomes an interesting\nquestion\u2014albeit one that goes against everyday\nusage\u2014whether one can be heterosexual and gay or homosexual and\nstraight. Perhaps not, if being homosexual is necessary (but not\nsufficient) for being gay, and if being heterosexual is necessary (but\nnot sufficient) for being straight.\n\nMatthew Andler has recently argued, by trying to eliminate rival\naccounts, for a \u201ccultural theory of queer sexual\nidentity.\u201d (\u201cQueer\u201d is an unclear concept, but in\nthe hands of academics it generally means any gender identity, sexual\norientation, or sexual identity that diverges, especially\nintentionally, from cisheterosexist ways of thinking and living; see\nHall 2017 for discussion.) According to Andler, one has a queer sexual\nidentity \u201cin virtue of (i) being excluded from straight culture\nand (ii) being such that according to the constitutive norms of queer\nculture the individual ought to be included in queer culture\u201d\n(2022, 124). Whether such an account succeeds depends on whether other\naccounts have been successfully argued against. It also depends on how\nmonolithic and rigid we take such cultures to be, and so which of\ntheir aspects are exclusionary and which are not. Moreover, this\naccount implies that there are no queer identities in those possible\nworlds in which gay and straight people exist but in which\nheterosexual cultures do not exclude queer people. It seems plausible\nthat in such worlds there are queer identities (though\n\u201cqueer\u201d would not have the same oppositional meaning as it\ndoes in the actual world).\n\nThe notion of sexual identity might help address the desired goals\nbehind the claim that asexuality is a sexual orientation, for one can\nargue that even if asexuality is not an orientation, asexuals still\nhave a sexual identity, and it is their identity that supports calls\nfor their social and legal protections.\n",
