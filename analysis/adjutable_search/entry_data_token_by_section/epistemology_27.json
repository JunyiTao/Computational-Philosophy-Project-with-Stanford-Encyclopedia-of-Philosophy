    "main_text": "The Limits of Cognitive Success || Responses to the Underdetermination Argument\n6.3 Responses to the Underdetermination Argument\n\nBoth the contextualist and the Moorean responses to\n BKCA,\n as discussed in the previous section, leave out one important detail.\nBoth say that one can know that one isn\u2019t a BIV (though\ncontextualists grant this point only for the sense of\n\u201cknow\u201d operational in low-standards contexts), but neither\nview explains how one can know such a thing. If, by\nhypothesis, a BIV has all the same states of mind that I\nhave\u2014including all the same perceptual experiences\u2014then\nhow can I be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV? And if I\ncan\u2019t be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV, then\nhow can I know that I\u2019m not?\n\nOf course, the question about how I can be justified in believing that\nI\u2019m not a BIV is not especially hard for externalists to answer.\nFrom the point of view of an externalist, the fact that you and the\nBIV have the very same states of mind need not be at all relevant to\nthe issue of whether you\u2019re justified in believing that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV, since such justification isn\u2019t fully\ndetermined by those mental states anyway.\n\nThe philosophers who have had to do considerable work to answer the\nquestion how I can be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV\nhave typically done this work not directly in reply to BKCA, but\nrather in reply to BJUA.\n\nWhat might justify your belief that you\u2019re not a BIV? According\nto some philosophers, you are justified in believing that you\u2019re\nnot a BIV because, for instance, you know perfectly well that current\ntechnology doesn\u2019t enable anyone to create a BIV. The proponent\nof the BIV hypothesis might regard this answer as no better than the\nMoorean response to BKCA: if you are allowed to appeal to (what you\nregard as your) knowledge of current technology to justify your belief\nthat you\u2019re not a BIV, then why can\u2019t the Moorean equally\nwell rely on his knowledge that he has hands to justify his belief\nthat he\u2019s not a BIV? Philosophers who accept this objection, but\nwho don\u2019t want to ground your justification for believing that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV in purely externalistic factors, may instead\nclaim that your belief is justified by the fact that your own beliefs\nabout the external world provide a better explanation of your sense\nexperiences than does the BIV hypothesis (see Russell 1912 and Vogel\n1990 for influential defenses of this argument against skepticism, and\nsee Neta 2004 for a rebuttal).\n",
