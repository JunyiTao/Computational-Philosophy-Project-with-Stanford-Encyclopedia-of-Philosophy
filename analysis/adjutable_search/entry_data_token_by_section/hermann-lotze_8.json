    "main_text": "Three Legacies || Personalism\n5.3 Value Theory\n\nTo recapitulate, briefly: First, we must abandon the mere prejudice\nthat the external world exists complete and independent of our minds,\nand that our thinking is merely a \u201cuseless appendage\u201d\nwhich merely reproduces the contents of the world, as a fruitless\nactivity. Nor should we fall into the trap of absolute idealism, which\nso reduces the world of things that they can easily be fitted into the\nformal categories of our thinking (that is, reduce metaphysics to\nlogic). The right way was indicated by Fichte: our minds are not for\nthe mere cognitive reproduction of meaningless things, but rather a\n\u201cworld\u201d only appears to us in order to serve as a stage\ninducing us to meaningful action. But action characterizes only the\nsubjective side of things: on the other side, we must identify the\nmoral good, and our action becomes, hence, merely a means of realizing\nthis end.\n\nThe terminology of \u201cmoral good\u201d is thus shorthand for the\nentire complex of values (and, hence, can be identified with what\nearlier thinkers called the good, the beautiful, happiness, or\nblessedness). But although this apprehension of the world is dependent\nupon mind, it is not subjective. Instead, our cognition of the world\nand its value is objective: a world can only be a system of the truly\nreal, that is to say, a system ordered according to the good. For this\npurpose, we need not understand the mechanics of our cognition and,\nindeed, we would gain little from this knowledge, for the central\nthing is the apprehension of meaningfulness present to us in a world\nof mere physical objects.\n\nFinally, then we come to the subject of value and validity, which\ndescribes an immense topic.The following restricts itself to but one\nsmall part of the continental side, briefly discussing the case of\nHeidegger. Heidegger\u2019s long engagement with the Lotzean\nfoundations of his neo-Kantian teachers has not yet received\nwidespread acknowledgement (see, however, Crowell, 2001). The early\nHeidegger seemingly operated wholly within the neo-Kantian paradigm\nand even the first emergence of the phenomenological impulse was\ndirected, at least in part, at a reconceptualization of neo-Kantian\ntopics and questions. Especially revealing is the lecture course of\nSummer Semester 1919, which aimed at nothing less than \u201ca\nphenomenological critique of transcendental philosophy of value\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2000, p. 108). Thereby, Heidegger intended to utilize\nBrentano, Dilthey and Husserl, among others, to combat and reconstruct\nthe insights of Windelband, Rickert and Lask, on the one hand, and\nalso the Marburgers (and even Simmel), on the other. And the common\nroot of these heterogeneous schools and thinkers had to begin with\nLotze\u2019s decisive contribution (cf. ibid., pp.\n116\u2013118).\n\nAccording to Heidegger, in the midst of the nineteenth century two\nglobal errors emerged, only to attain prominence in philosophical\npractice of that day: naturalism and historicism. The only school that\navoided these two was \u201cspeculative theism\u201d and it was\nunder their influence that Lotze\u2019s breakthrough emerged: the\ndecisive repudiation of naturalism without falling into mere\n\u201chistory of philosophy.\u201d This was accomplished by\nLotze\u2019s revival of the non-sensory while avoiding \u201cthe\nextravagant naturalistic supra-sensoriness of the old\nmetaphysics\u201d (Heidegger, 2000, p. 117). In his articulation of a\nphilosophy of value, Lotze \u201ckilled two birds with one\nstone\u201d: \u201ca safeguarding of the continuity and connection\nwith German idealism, but simultaneously a critical deflection of\nspeculative idealism\u201d (ibid., p. 118). (But this\nassessment would not stand, for by the Nietzsche lectures (cf.\nHeidegger, 1977, esp. pp. 70ff) of 1936\u201340, Heidegger has come\nto believe that a reliance on the terminology of value and values was\nsimply the positivist version of the metaphysical (which was supposed\nto have been thoroughly vanquished) (cf. Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, pp.\n190f).)\n\nFurther substantiation of Heidegger\u2019s deep and continuing\nstruggle with Lotze (and the neo-Kantian paradigm he helped engender)\nis now available in English in the newly translated 1925/26 lecture\ncourse on Logic (Heidegger, 2010). Here Heidegger makes\nexplicit the exact same thesis, later elaborated by Gillian Rose,\nnamely that Lotze is indeed the founder of the paradigm so excellently\ndeveloped and exploited by the neo-Kantians: \u201cThe\n\u2018neo-Kantian paradigm\u2019 refers to those who attempted a new\nanswer to the Kantian questions of validity within the framework of\nvalidity and values first developed by Lotze\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n6). Coincident with this is a shift, by these later thinkers, to\nphilosophy as a kind of purified methodologism, a pure and general\n(but not at all formal) logic, directed towards a vision of\nscience \u201cas an ideal network of propositions\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2010, p. 50). By Heidegger\u2019s later lights, all of\nneo-Kantianism and much of Husserl was sharply inflected by this\n(unconscious) prejudice.\n\nWhile a fuller discussion of this interesting topic is not possible\nhere, some light is nevertheless shed by a brief consideration of the\ntwentieth-century reaction to neo-Kantianism, as found in the\nthought of (mostly) later thinkers (inter alia, Heidegger\nhimself):\n\nDilthey, Heidegger, Mannheim, Benjamin and Gadamer have this criticism\nin common: the neo-Kantian answers to the question of validity debase\nthe question of being, reality, life or history \u2026 [they] return\nto the Kantian question of validity, \u2018What are the preconditions\nof experience?\u2019, but judge that the Kantian reference to the\ncategories and their application itself has a precondition:\n\u2018life\u2019 (Dilthey), \u2018social-situation\u2019\n(Mannheim), \u2018Dasein\u2019 (Heidegger),\n\u2018history\u2019 (Gadamer). These become the presupposition of\nthe use of the categories or of meaning, the \u2018a\npriori\u2019 of a new kind of ontology (Rose, 1981, pp.\n22\u201323).\n\n\n(Note that from the analytic side, the emergence of concepts such as\n\u2018form of life\u2019 and \u2018ordinary language\u2019 may be\nseen to play similar roles.) As a consequence, whether continental (or\nanalytic) philosophy deserve the appellation of neo-neo-Kantianism\nremains an open question.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s rejection of Lotze and neo-Kantianism by means of a\nreturn to a more basic or primodial notion is quite explicit in the\nLogic lectures:\n\nLotze uses the word \u201cbeing\u201d as equivalent to\n\u201cout-there-ness,\u201d and therefore he uses\n\u201cbeing\u201d for sensible beings, material beings in the widest\nsense. I have already stressed that the currently common term\n\u201csensible entity\u201d does not characterize being\n[Sein], but only determines the way of apprehending being\n\u2026 I use \u201cbeing\u201d in the exact opposite sense, and in\nconnection with the genuine tradition of Greek philosophy broadly\nspeaking (Heidegger, 2010, p. 53).\n\n\n(A few pages later, Heidegger also makes clear where the necessary\nreturn in philosophy lies\u2014\u201cThe need to return to\nAristotle\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p. 90)\u2014with, of course, the\nimportant proviso that \u201c[t]he Greeks had no suspicion of this\nunfathomable problematic, which opens up before us once we have seen\nthis connection [between being and time]\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p.\n163).)\n\nUnfortunately, there are grounds for thinking that this turn to\nmetacritique\u2014i.e., the application of neo-Kantian style\ncriticism to neo-Kantianism (and its unacknowledged\npresuppositions)\u2014nevertheless, \u201cin spite of its radical\nintentions, remains within the paradigm of Geltung and cannot\nmake the transition to a speculative position\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n24). Instead, almost all the lines of thought, dominant in the\ntwentieth century, ultimately converge and terminate at \u201ca\nneo-Fichtean station\u201d (ibid.). And there, it appears, we\nremain.\n",
