    "main_text": "Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages || Christian Thought and Music\n2.2 Christian Thought and Music\n\nThe impact of Christianity on medieval musical thinking is evident in\nthe religious interpretation given of two philosophical views from\nAntiquity, the harmony of the spheres and the ethos theory, according\nto which music may shape the listener\u2019s character. Both of these\nideas were held by Boethius (see the preceding section) and found\nwidespread acceptance among medieval writers.\n\nThe Christian take on the harmony of the spheres consists in the claim\nthat such harmony was imposed on the universe by the Creator. The\nbeauty of music, including sounding music, is thus traced back to\nmusic\u2019s partaking in that divine harmony. John Scottus Eriugena\n(c. 800\u2013c. 877) expresses such a view in his\nPeriphyseon, as evident from his very definition of\nmusic:\n\n\nMusic is the art which by the light of reason studies the harmony of\nall things that are in motion that is knowable by natural proportions.\n(Periphyseon, 475B)\n\n\nThat the harmony of the spheres could be interpreted in Christian\nterms did not prevent philosophers from rejecting it, especially once\nAristotle\u2019s works had become available. Albert the Great\n(Albertus Magnus) (c. 1200\u20131280) is an example of a prominent\nphilosopher who rejects the idea of a celestial harmony. Appealing to\narguments based on the structure of the cosmos, he discards the idea\nthat the movement of celestial bodies could produce harmonious sounds\n(Liber de Causis Proprietatum Elementorum, book II, 2.1; on\nthe harmony of the spheres in the thirteenth century, see Mews\n2011).\n\nThe idea that music may influence character was widely accepted over\nthe course of the Middle Ages. It was supported by the exaggerated\naccounts of music\u2019s powers that had survived from Antiquity. The\nmedieval Christian version of the ethos theory normally stresses the\ndevotional potential of music.\n",
