    "main_text": "Economics and ethics || Efficiency\n6.2 Efficiency\n\nBecause the identification of welfare with preference satisfaction\nmakes it questionable whether one can make interpersonal welfare\ncomparisons, few economists defend a utilitarian view of policy as\nmaximizing total or average welfare. (Harsanyi is one exception, for\nanother see Ng 1983). Economists have instead explored the possibility\nof making welfare assessments of economic processes, institutions,\noutcomes, and policies without making interpersonal comparisons.\nConsider two economic outcomes S and R, and suppose\nthat some people prefer S to R and that nobody\nprefers R to S. In that case S is\n\u201cPareto superior\u201d to R, or S is a\n\u201cPareto improvement\u201d over R. Without making any\ninterpersonal comparisons, one can conclude that people\u2019s\npreferences are better satisfied in S than in R. If\nthere is no state of affairs that is Pareto superior to S,\nthen economists say that S is \u201cPareto optimal\u201d or\n\u201cPareto efficient.\u201d Efficiency here is efficiency with\nrespect to satisfying preferences rather than minimizing the number of\ninputs needed to produce a unit of output or some other technical\nnotion (Le Grand 1991). If a state of affairs is not Pareto efficient,\nthen society is missing an opportunity costlessly to satisfy some\npeople\u2019s preferences better. A Pareto efficient state of affairs\navoids this failure, but it has no other obvious virtues. For example,\nsuppose nobody is satiated and people care only about how much food\nthey get. Consider two distributions of food. In the first, millions\nare starving but no food is wasted. In the second, nobody is starving,\nbut some food is wasted. The first is Pareto efficient, while the\nsecond is not.\n\nThe notions of Pareto improvements and Pareto efficiency might seem\nuseless, because economic policies almost always have both winners and\nlosers. Mainstream economists have nevertheless found these concepts\nuseful in two ways. First, they have proved two theorems concerning\nproperties of perfectly competitive equilibria (Arrow 1968). The first\ntheorem says that equilibria in perfectly competitive markets are\nPareto optimal, and the second says that any Pareto optimal\nallocation, with whatever distribution of income policy makers might\nprefer, can be achieved as a perfectly competitive market equilibrium,\nprovided that one begins with just the right distribution of\nendowments among economic agents. The first theorem has been regarded\nas underwriting Adam Smith\u2019s view of the invisible hand (Arrow\nand Hahn 1971, preface; Hahn 1973). This interpretation is\nproblematic, because no economy has ever been or will ever be in\nperfectly competitive equilibrium. The second theorem provides some\njustification for the normative division of labor economists prefer,\nwith economists concerned about efficiency and others concerned about\njustice. The thought is that the second theorem shows that theories of\njust distribution are compatible with reliance on competitive markets.\nThe two fundamental theorems of welfare economics go some way toward\nexplaining why mainstream economists, whether they support\nlaissez-faire policies or government intervention to remedy\nmarket imperfections, think of perfectly competitive equilibria as\nideals. But the significance of the theorems is debatable, since\nactual markets differ significantly from perfectly competitive markets\nand, when there are multiple market imperfections, the \u201ctheory\nof the second best\u201d shows that fixing some of the imperfections\nmay lead the society away from a perfectly competitive equilibrium\n(and diminish efficiency and welfare) rather than toward one (Lipsey\nand Lancaster 1956\u20137).\n\nThe other way that economists have found to extend the Pareto\nefficiency notions leads to cost-benefit analysis, which is a\npractical tool for policy analysis (Mishan 1971; Sugden and Williams\n1978; Adler and Posner 2000, 2006; Broadman et al. 2010;\nBoadway 2016). Suppose that S is not a Pareto improvement\nover R. Some members of the society would be losers in a\nshift from R to S. Those losers prefer R to\nS, but there are enough winners \u2014 enough people who\nprefer S to R \u2014 that the winners\ncould compensate the losers and make the preference for\nS\u2032 (S with compensation paid) over R\nunanimous. S is a \u201cpotential Pareto improvement\u201d\nover R. In other terms, the amount of money the winners would\nbe willing to pay to bring about the change is larger than the amount\nof money the losers would have to be compensated so as not to object\nto the change. (Economists are skeptical about what one learns from\nasking people how much they would be willing to pay, and they attempt\ninstead to infer how much individuals are willing to pay indirectly\nfrom market phenomena.) When S is a potential Pareto\nimprovement over R, there is said to be a \u201cnet\nbenefit\u201d to the policy of bringing about S. According\nto cost-benefit analysis, among eligible policies (which satisfy legal\nand moral constraints), one should, other things being equal, employ\nthe one with the largest net benefit. Note that the compensation is\nentirely hypothetical. Potential Pareto improvements result in winners\nand losers, the justice or injustice of which is irrelevant to\ncost-benefit analysis. Justice or beneficence may require that the\nsociety do something to mitigate distributional imbalances. Because\nthere is a larger \u201cpie\u201d of goods and services to satisfy\npreferences (since compensation could be paid and everybody\u2019s\npreferences better satisfied), selecting policies with the greatest\nnet benefit serves economic efficiency (Hicks 1939, Kaldor 1939).\n\nDespite the practical importance of cost-benefit analysis, the\ntechnique and the justification for it sketched in the previous\nparagraph are problematic. One technical difficulty is that it is\npossible for S to be a potential Pareto improvement over\nR and for R to be a potential Pareto improvement\nover S (Scitovsky 1941, Samuelson 1950)! That means that the\nfact that S is a potential Pareto improvement over R\ndoes not imply that there is a larger economic \u201cpie\u201d in\nS than in R, because there cannot, of course, be a\nlarger economic pie in S than in R and a larger\neconomic pie in R than in S. A second problem is\nthat willingness to pay for some policy and the amount one would\nrequire in compensation if one opposes the policy depend on how much\nwealth one has as well as on one\u2019s attitude to the policy.\nCost-benefit analysis weights the preferences of the rich more than\nthe preferences of the poor (Baker 1975). It is possible to compensate\nroughly for the effects of income and wealth (Harburger 1978,\nFankhauser et al. 1997), but it is bothersome to do so, and\ncost-benefit analysis is commonly employed without any adjustment for\nwealth or income.\n\nA further serious difficulty for traditional welfare economics, which\nhas been as it were hiding in plain sight, is the fact that choices\nare imperfect indicators of preferences, which are in turn imperfect\nindicators of what enhances well-being. The same facts that show that\npreference satisfaction does not constitute well-being (false beliefs,\nlack of information, other-directed and non-rational preferences) show\nthat choices and preferences are sometimes misleading indicators of\nwell-being. Moreover, once one recognizes that preferences are good\nindicators of welfare only if agents are good judges of what will\nbenefit them, one is bound to recognize that agents are not always\ngood judges of what will benefit themselves, even when they have all\nthe information they need. In some contexts, these problems may be\nminor. For example, people\u2019s preferences among new automobiles\nare largely self-interested, thoughtful, and well-informed. In other\ncontexts, such as environmental protection, preferences for ignoring\nthe problems are often badly informed, while preferences to take\naction are typically not self-interested. Either way, popular\npreferences among policies to address environmental problems are\nunlikely to be a good guide to welfare.\n\nIgnoring these problems has been a great convenience to normative\neconomics. If what people choose reveals their preferences, which in\nturn indicate what is good for them, then, as noted before, government\naction to steer someone\u2019s choices can never make that person\nbetter off, and so questions about whether to endorse paternalistic\npolicies cannot arise. But whether or not it is advisable, successful\npaternalism is not impossible; and recent work by behavioral\neconomists, which document a wide variety of systematic deliberative\nfoibles, has put questions concerning paternalism back on the table\n(Ariely 2009, Kahneman 2011). Some economists have searched for ways to\nidentify an agent\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d preferences (as described\nby Infante et al. 2016). Others have argued that policy\nmakers must respect the preferences of agents among their ends or\nobjectives, while overruling preferences among means when these are\ndistorted by bad judgment or false beliefs (Thaler and Sunstein 2008,\nLe Grand and New 2015). Moreover, Thaler and Sunstein\u2019s proposal\nthat government explore non-coercive methods of influencing people to\nmake better choices (\u201cnudges\u201d) has been popular among\npolicy makers and has arguably shifted philosophical discussion of\npaternalism away from Mill\u2019s (1859) focus on avoiding coercion\n(Shiffrin 2000, Hausman and Welch 2010, Le Grand and New 2015).\n",
