The Logic Underneath Games\n\nA game is a mathematical description of the relation\nbetween a set of individuals (or groups of\nindividuals) and a set of potential outcomes.\nIndividuals choose, independently and concurrently, a\nsubset of the outcomes, with the final outcome being selected from the\ncombination of each choice. Independently means that\nindividuals\u2019 choices do not influence one another.\nConcurrently means that each individual\u2019s choices are\ntaken not knowing the other players\u2019 choices. Each individual is\nassumed to have a preference over the set of outcomes, i.e., he or she\nlikes some outcomes more than others, and typically assumed to know\nthe other individuals\u2019 potential choices and preferences,\nadjusting their decisions accordingly.\n\nGames are used to model all sorts of situations, ranging from animal\nbehavior to international conflict resolution (Osborne &\nRubinstein 1994). A useful application for the purpose of this entry\nis collective decision-making, an instance of which is going to be the\nworking example throughout.\n\n\nExample 1 (The treaty of Rome). The treaty of Rome\n(1958\u20131973) established the European Economic Community.\nAccording to Article 148 of the Treaty, acts of the Council (one of\nthe main legislative institutions) required for their adoption:\n\n12 votes (if the act was proposed by the Commission), or\n12 votes by at least 4 member states (if the act was not proposed\nby the Commission).\n\n\nThe values above refer to the EU-6, the founding member states. The\ntreaty allocated the votes as follows:\n\n4 votes: France, Germany, Italy;\n2 votes: Belgium, The Netherlands;\n1 vote: Luxembourg.\n\n\nThis scenario can be described as a game.\n\nThere are six players, the Countries:\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nThey vote on one issue at the time. Issues can be binary, e.g., the\nadoption of a border-protection scheme, or multi-valued, e.g., how\nmany millions should be spent on the adoption of a border-protection\nscheme.\n\nCountries might have preferences over the outcome of the vote\nor even over the other Countries\u2019 specific vote, and they\nusually vote without knowing how the others have voted.\n\nOften times, these games are such that no participant is, alone,\ncapable of deciding the final outcome, but, in some cases, they could\ncooperate and agree on a joint strategy.\n\n\nDepending on players\u2019 preferences, knowledge and capabilities\nsome outcomes will be more likely to be chosen. In order to understand\nwhich ones, game theory has devised solution concepts, formally\nfunctions from the set of games to the set of outcomes in each of\nthese games, which describe players\u2019 rationality in mathematical\nterms. Solution concepts, as we will see later, can be succinctly\nexpressed in simple and well-behaved logics.\n\nNext we describe games as mathematical structures, emphasizing various\nkey ingredients (e.g., the possibility of forming coalitions, the\npossibility to take decisions in time etc.) and the best suited\nlanguages to express them.\n2. The Basic Ingredients\n\nFormally, games consist of a finite set of players \\(N=\\{1,2, \\ldots,\nn\\}\\) and a possibly infinite set of outcomes \\(W=\\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots,\nw_k, \\ldots \\}\\).\n\nExample 2. In the example above the set of players\nN is {France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands,\nLuxembourg}. If we consider the issue adoption\nof border-protection scheme, there are two outcomes: yes and\nno, i.e., \\(W = \\{\\mbox{yes, no}\\}\\). If we instead consider the issue\nmillions spent on border-protection\nscheme there is a potentially infinite outcome space, i.e., \\(W\n= \\{\\textrm{0M}, \\textrm{1M}, \\textrm{2M}, \\ldots \\}\\). It is possible\nto have a set of outcomes that is even refined further, for instance\nspecifying the way players have voted. In this case the outcome in\nwhich France votes yes, the others vote no, and the result is no,\nwould be different from the outcome in which Italy votes yes, the\nothers vote no, and the result is no, although the result of the vote\nis the same. What is important to emphasize is that each set of\noutcomes comes with a level of description of what is\nhappening in the underlying interaction. There is no a priori right or\nwrong level of description, the choice depends on the properties of\nthe game that one is interested in.\n\nOn top of players and outcomes, games come with two more\nrelations:\n\na preference relation, denoted \\(\\succeq\\),\ndescribing players\u2019 preferences over outcomes;\nan action relation, denoted \\(E\\), describing the\noutcomes that players or groups of players are able to impose or,\nconversely, rule out;\n\n\nAn important relation in games is knowledge, which formally describes\nwhat players know of the game and their opponents. This relation is\nsometimes given explicitly, other times left implicit. The present\nentry will not make the relation explicit, but will rather incorporate\nit in the formalization of players\u2019 rationality.\n\nBoth the preference and the action relations collect families of\nindividual relations, one per player. The preference relation, for\ninstance, is broken down into a family \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\),\ndescribing the preference over outcomes for each of the individuals,\nwhile the action relation collects a family \\(\\{E_C\\}_{C\\subseteq N}\\)\neach describing what a specific group of players can achieve.\n\nOverall, a game can be seen as a mathematical structure\n\n\\[(\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq, E)\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is the set of players, typically finite, \\(W\\)\nthe set of outcomes, \\(\\succeq\\) the preference relation and \\(E\\) the\naction relation.\n\nThis mathematical structure is also known as a relational\nstructure (Blackburn, Rijke, & Venema 2001), which (in a\ncertain sense) is a set-theoretic equivalent of a so-called\nmodal logic (Blackburn et al. 2001), a\nmathematical language that is well-suited to express the mathematical\nproperties of relations. A relational structure will henceforth be\ndenoted \\(F\\), which stands for frame.\n\nThe last ingredient that we need, in order to link relational\nstructures and modal logics, is the specification of a set of atomic\npropositions Atoms, which expresses the\nrelevant properties of the outcomes we are interested in. This set is\nusually taken to be\n countable[1]\n and is associated to outcomes by means of a valuation\nfunction, i.e., a function of the form \n\\[V: W \\to 2^\\texttt{Atoms}\\]\n\n\nassociating to each outcome the set of propositional atoms that are\ntrue at that outcome.\n\nA tuple \\((F,V)\\) will be referred to as model, which\nwill be denoted \\(M\\).\n\nThe relations in a game structure, which are relative to individual\nplayers (and groups), will formally be described in connection with\nthe main modal logics used to express their properties, at different\nlevels of description and granularity.\n\nThe following paragraph collects the background technical notions\nneeded to interpret the modal languages used in this entry. The reader\nalready acquainted with modal logic can skip it. For a more in depth\nexploration one can consult the related entry on\n modal logic.\n Well-known classic textbooks are Modal Logic: An\nIntroduction (Chellas 1980), which focuses on non-normal modal\nlogics, and Modal Logic (Blackburn et al. 2001),\nwhich focuses instead on a more mathematical treatment of normal modal\n logics.[2]\n\n\nModal Logic: background notions: The language of a\nmodal logic is an extension of the language of\npropositional logic with a set of modal operators \\(\\Box_1,\\ldots ,\n\\Box_n, \\ldots\\), defined on a countable set of atomic propositions\n\\(\\texttt{Atoms}=\\{p_1,p_2, \\ldots \\}\\), over which the set of\nwell-formed formulas is inductively built (for a mathematical\ntreatment of logic and induction see for instance Dalen 1980). Each\nwell-formed formula \\(\\varphi\\) of a modal language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\),\nhenceforth simply called formula, is constructed using the\nfollowing grammar: \n\\[\\varphi ::= p \\mid \\lnot\\varphi\\mid\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi \\mid \\Box_i \\varphi\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Box_i \\in \\{\\Box_1, \\ldots, \\Box_n, \\ldots\\}\\) and \\(p \\in\n\\texttt{Atoms}\\).\n\n\nA model for this language is a structure \\(M = ((W, R_1, \\ldots, R_n,\n\\ldots), V)\\), consisting of a set of worlds or\nstates or outcomes \\(W\\); an\naccessibility relation \\(R_i\\) for each modal\noperator \\(\\Box_i\\)which we here assume are so-called neighborhood\nfunctions (Chellas 1980), i.e., functions \\(R_i: W \\to 2^{2^{W}}\\);\nand a valuation function \\(V: \\texttt{Atoms} \\to\n2^{W}\\), which assigns to each atomic proposition a subset of \\(W\\),\nwith the idea that each atomic proposition is assigned to the set of\nworlds at which this proposition is true.\n\nAs a general convention, a multimodal language with modalities\n\\(\\Box_1\\), \u2026, \\(\\Box_n\\), \u2026 will be denoted by\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{f(\\Box_1),\\ldots, f(\\Box_n),\\ldots}\\), where the\nfunction \\(f\\) associates to each modality its intuitive shorthand.\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be a modal language with modalities \\(\\Box_1\\),\n\u2026, \\(\\Box_n\\), \u2026 and let \\(M = ((W, R_1, \\ldots, R_n,\n\\ldots), V )\\) be a model for this language. The satisfaction\nrelation of a formula \\(\\varphi \\in \\Delta\\) with respect to\na pair \\((M,w)\\), where \\(w \\in W\\), is defined according to the\nfollowing truth conditions: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nM,w&\\models p &\\mbox{ if and only if }& w \\in V(p)\\\\\n M,w&\\models \\neg\\varphi &\\mbox{ if and only if }& M,w\\not\\models\\varphi \\\\\n M,w&\\models \\varphi\\land\\psi &\\mbox{ if and only if }& M,w\\models\\varphi \\mbox{ and } M,w\\models\\psi \\\\\n M,w&\\models \\Box_i \\varphi &\\mbox{ if and only if }& \\varphi^M\\in R_i(w) \\\\\n \n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\varphi^{M}=\\{w \\in W \\mid M,w \\models \\varphi\\}\\) is called\nthe truth set or the extension of\n\\(\\varphi\\).\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) of a modal language: holds at a\nstate \\(w\\) of model \\(M\\) whenever \\(M,w \\models \\varphi\\);\nis valid in a model \\(M\\), denoted \\(\\models_{M}\n\\varphi\\), if and only if \\(M,w \\models \\varphi\\) for every \\(w \\in\nW\\), where \\(W\\) is the domain of \\(M\\); is valid in a class\nof models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), denoted \\(\\models_{\\mathcal{M}}\n\\varphi\\), if and only if it is valid in every \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\);\nis valid in a frame \\({F}\\) (a model without a\nvaluation function), denoted \\(\\models_{{F}} \\varphi\\), if and only if\nfor every valuation \\(V\\) we have that \\(\\models_{(F,V)} \\varphi\\); is\nvalid in a class of frames \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), denoted\n\\(\\models_{\\mathcal{F}} \\varphi\\), if and only if it is valid in every\n\\(F \\in \\mathcal{F}\\).\n\nWe can view a modal logic as the set of formulas\n\\(\\Delta_{\\mathcal{M}}\\)(\\(\\Delta_{\\mathcal{F}}\\)) that are valid in a\ngiven class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) (frames \\(\\mathcal{F}\\)). For a\nset of formulas \\(\\Sigma\\), we write \\(M,w \\models \\Sigma\\) to say\nthat \\(M,w \\models \\sigma\\), for all \\(\\sigma\\in \\Sigma\\). We say that\na set of formulas (globally) semantically entails a\nformula \\(\\varphi\\) in a class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), denoted\n\\(\\Sigma \\models_{\\mathcal{M}} \\varphi\\), if for every \\(M \\in\n\\mathcal{M}\\)we have that \\(\\models_{M} \\Sigma\\) implies \\(\\models_{M}\n\\varphi\\). When \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a class of frames, \\(\\Sigma\n\\models_{\\mathcal{F}} \\phi\\) means that \\(\\Sigma \\models_{\\mathcal{M}}\n\\phi\\) where \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is the set of models based on frames in\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\nA modal rule \n\\[\\frac{\\varphi_1,\\ldots ,\\varphi_n }{\\psi}\\]\n\n\nis sound in a class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) if\n\\(\\varphi_1,\\ldots ,\\varphi_n \\models_{\\mathcal{M}} \\psi\\).\n\nRecall, following Chellas (1980), that a modal logic \\(\\Delta\\) is\ncalled classical if it is closed under the rule of\nequivalence, i.e., for each \\(\\Box\\) in the language we have:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\psi}{\\Box \\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\Box \\psi}\\]\n\n\nIt is called monotonic if it is classical and it is\nmoreover closed under the rule of monotonicity, i.e., for each\n\\(\\Box\\) in the language we have: \n\\[\\frac{\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi}{\\Box \\varphi \\rightarrow \\Box \\psi}\\]\n\n\nIt is called normal if it is monotonic, it is closed\nunder the rule of generalization and contains the \\(K\\) axiom, i.e.,\nfor each \\(\\Box\\) we have \n\\[\\frac{\\varphi}{\\Box \\varphi}\\]\n\n\nand \\(\\Delta\\) contains all instances of \\(\\Box(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to\n(\\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\psi)\\).\n\nWhen \\( R_i\\) is a principal\n filter[3]\n , we say that we say that the modality \\(\\Box_i\\) is\nnormal. In that case \\(R_i\\)can equivalently be represented\nas a relation of the form \\(R_i: W \\to 2^{W}\\), and then we have that\n\\(M,w \\models \\Box_i \\phi\\) if and only if \\(M,v \\models \\phi\\) for\nall \\(v \\in W\\) such that \\(wR_iv\\). A normal modal logic can\nbe interpreted in structures of the form \\(M = ((W, R'_1, \\ldots,\nR'_n, \\ldots), V)\\)where every \\(R'_i\\) is a principal filter.\n2.1 Preferences\n\nRecall the relational structure \\((\\mathcal{N},W, \\succeq, E)\\) and\nconsider the relation \\(\\succeq\\). This relation compactly represents\na family \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) of individual preference relations\neach indexed with a player.\n\nFormally, a preference for player \\(i\\) is a\nrelation \n\\[\\succeq_i \\subseteq W \\times W\\]\n\n\nThe idea is that if two outcomes \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) are such that\n\\((w,w')\\in \\succeq_i\\) then player \\(i\\) considers outcome \\(w\\) at\nleast as good as outcome \\(w'\\). The fact that \\((w,w')\\in \\succeq_i\\)\nwill be abbreviated \\(w \\succeq_i w'\\). Its inverse is the relation\n\\(\\preceq_i\\),which holds for \\((w,w')\\) whenever \\(w' \\succeq_i w\\).\nIts strict counterpart is the relation \\(\\succ_i\\), which holds for\n\\((w,w')\\) whenever \\(w \\succeq_i w'\\) and it is not the case that\n\\(w' \\succeq_i w\\). Moreover \\(w \\sim_i w'\\) denotes the fact that \\(w\n\\succeq_i w'\\) and \\(w' \\succeq_i w\\), meaning that \\(i\\) is\nindifferent between \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\).\n\nExample 3. Let us go back to our main example.\nTypically Countries have preferences over the outcome of the decision,\ne.g., Italy think we should spend between 5 and 10 million euros for\nthe scheme, Germany think we should spend between 1 and 2, Belgium\nbetween 4 and 5, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and France exactly 5.\nThis means, for instance, that Italy\u2019s preference relation is\nsuch that \\(w \\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever \\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq\nw \\leq \\textrm{10M}\\) and either \\(w'>\\textrm{10M}\\) or \\(0\\leq\nw'<\\textrm{5M}\\). What about all other couples of outcomes? In the\nsimplest case Italy are indifferent between them. So \\(w\n\\sim_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\), otherwise. However, we could also assume a\nmore complex preference. For instance, Italy would like to spend as\nmuch money as possible within their desired budget. In this case the\npreference relation is: \\(w \\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever\n\\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq w \\leq \\textrm{10M}\\) and either\n\\(w'>\\textrm{10M}\\) or \\(0\\leq w'<\\textrm{5M}\\), \\(w\n\\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever \\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq w' < w \\leq\n\\textrm{10M}\\) while \\(w \\sim_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\), otherwise. Not\nall outcomes of a vote are going to reach an agreement. We then, for\ntechnical purposes, define an auxiliary outcome \\(w^{*}\\), interpreted\nas a disagreement outcome. The idea is that this is an outcome of the\nvote that does not reach any consensus. We assume that any agreement\nis strictly better for any player than disagreement, i.e., \\(w\n\\succ_{{i}} w'\\) whenever \\(w'=w^{*}\\) and \\(w\\neq w^{*}\\), for each\n\\(i\\in N\\).\n\nProperties of these relations can be expressed by means of modal\nlogics. To do so we introduce modal operators\n\\(\\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i\\), \\(\\Diamond^{\\prec}_i\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond^{\\sim}_i\\) for each of the corresponding relations, and we\ncan view a relational structure as a modal logic frame with the\nrelation \\(\\preceq_i\\) interpreting \\(\\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i\\) and so\non.\n\nThe interpretation in a model \\(M\\) based on such a frame, for \\(R \\in\n\\{\\preceq, \\prec, \\sim\\}\\), is then as follows (note that these\nmodalities are normal): \n\\[ M,w \\models \\Diamond^{R}_i \\varphi\\enskip \\mbox{ if and only if }\\enskip M,w^{\\prime} \\models \\varphi, \\mbox{ for some } w^{\\prime} \\mbox{ with } w R_i w^{\\prime}\\]\n\n\nThe relations in question often come with extra properties. For\ninstance, \\(\\preceq_i\\) is usually taken to satisfy the following:\n\n\nreflexivity: i.e., \\(\\forall w\\in W, i \\in N,\\)\nwe have that: \\(w \\preceq_i w\\);\ntransitivity: i.e., \\(\\forall w_1, w_2, w_3 \\in\nW, i \\in N,\\) we have that: (\\(w_1 \\preceq_i w_2\\) and \\(w_2 \\preceq_i\nw_3\\)) implies that \\(w_1 \\preceq_i w_3\\).\nconnectedness: i.e., \\(\\forall w_1, w_2 \\in W, i\n\\in N,\\) we have that: either \\(w_1 \\preceq_1 w_2\\) or \\(w_2 \\preceq_i\nw_1\\).\n\n\n\nThe first two properties can be characterized by means of the\nfollowing axioms and validities.\n\nProposition 1. \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\models_F \\varphi &\\rightarrow \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i \\varphi &\\mbox{ if and only if }& \\preceq_i \\mbox{ is reflexive} \\\\\n \\models_F \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i\\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i\\varphi &\\rightarrow \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i \\varphi &\\mbox{ if and only if }& \\preceq_i \\mbox{ is transitive} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nHowever this is not the case for connectedness, as modal languages\nsuch as this one can only talk about local properties of\nrelations (Blackburn et al. 2001).\n\nTo characterize connectedness we need to introduce a special type of\noperator: the universal (or global) modality (Goranko & Passy\n1992). This modality expresses properties of all the states in a\ndomain \\(W\\) of a model \\(M\\) and it is interpreted as follows.\n\n\\[ M,w \\models A\\varphi \\enskip\\mbox{ if and only if }\\enskip M,w^{\\prime} \\models \\varphi, \\mbox{ for all } w^{\\prime} \\in W\\]\n\n\nThe formula \\(\\neg A \\neg \\varphi\\) will be abbreviated \\(E\\varphi\\).\nThe symbol \\(E\\) is the existential dual of \\(A\\) and it indicates\nthat a certain formula holds at some state in the model. With the\nglobal modality we have a genuine addition of expressivity (together\nwith further costs and further gains, as shown in Goranko & Passy\n1992), therefore we can express validity in a model by means of\nexpressing truth in a world, witness the fact that \\(M,w \\models A\n\\varphi\\) holds if and only if \\( \\models_M \\varphi\\) does.\n\nRecall that a relation \\(R\\) is trichotomous if and only if for all\n\\(x,y\\in W\\) it is either the case that \\(xRy, yRx\\) or \\(y=x\\). We\ncan use a combination of preference and global modalities to obtain\nthe following frame correspondence.\n\n\nProposition 2. Let \\(F\\) be a frame. We have\nthat:\n\n\\(\\models_F (\\varphi \\wedge \\Box^{\\preceq}_i \\psi) \\to A(\\psi \\vee\n\\varphi \\vee \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i \\varphi)\\) if and only if\n\\(\\preceq_i\\) is trichotomous\n\n\nAn alternative and possibly more intuitive formula that can be used\ninstead is, for \\(p,q\\) being atomic propositions: \n\\[E p \\land E q \\to E(p \\land q) \\lor E(p \\land \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i q) \\lor E(q \\land \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i p)\\]\n\n\nTrichotomy, transitivity and reflexivity of \\(\\preceq_i\\) are\nequivalent to the relation being a weak linear order, and thus being\nconnected.\n\nThe relation \\(\\prec_i\\), i.e., the relation of strict preference, can\nbe defined in terms of \\(\\preceq_i\\). But \\(\\prec_i\\) satisfies the\nfollowing property:\n\n\nirreflexivity: i.e., \\(\\forall w\\in W, i \\in N,\\)\nwe have that: it is not the case that \\(w \\prec_i w\\);\n\n\n\nIrreflexivity is not definable in basic modal logic (Blackburn et\nal. 2001). However if the atomic propositions are powerful enough\nto tell each outcome apart, then irreflexivity becomes definable. For\ninstance let \\(w_k\\) be a variable identifying world\n \\(w_k\\).[4]\n We have the following.\n\nProposition 3. \n\\[\\models_F w_k \\to \\neg \\Diamond^\\prec_i w_k \\enskip\\mbox{ if and only if }\\enskip \\prec_i \\mbox{ is irreflexive} \\]\n\n\n\nFinally, the indifference relation \\(\\sim\\) satisfies the properties\nof reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry. While reflexivity and\ntransitivity are defined analogously to the previous modalities,\nsymmetry is defined as follows.\n\n\nsymmetry: i.e., \\(\\forall w_1, w_2 \\in W, i \\in\nN,\\) we have that: \\(w_1 \\sim_i w_2\\) implies that \\(w_2 \\sim_i\nw_1\\).\n\n\n\nWhile the axioms for the first two are similar to the ones for\n\\(\\preceq_i\\), symmetry is characterized as follows\n\nProposition 4. \n\\[\\models_F (\\psi \\to \\Box^{\\sim}_i \\Diamond^{\\sim}_i\\psi) \\enskip\\mbox{ if and only if }\\enskip \\sim_i \\mbox{ is symmetric} \\]\n\n\n\nThe three properties above say, together, that each \\(\\sim_i\\) is\nmathematically an equivalence relation, i.e., a\nrelation such that \n\\[\\bigcup_{w \\in W} \\{[w] \\mid w' \\in [w] \\mbox{ whenever } w \\sim_i w' \\}\\]\n\n\nis a partition of \\(W\\). Each element of this partition is an\nindifference class for player \\(i\\), i.e., a set of\noutcomes he or she is indifferent to.\n\nThe logic of equivalence relations, such as \\(\\sim_i\\), is also known\nas the \\({\\bf S5}\\) system.\n\nPreferences and utilities: Because of their\nwidespread use in game theory, an important class of preference\nrelations are those that correspond to numerical values, or\nutility functions.\n\nA utility function is a function \n\\[u_i: W \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\]\n\n\nmapping outcomes to real numbers, representing how much a\nplayer values a certain state.\n\nUtility functions naturally induce preference relations, in the\nfollowing sense.\n\n\nDefinition 5. Let \\(u\\) be a utility function. We say\nthat \\(\\succeq^*_i\\) corresponds to \\(u\\) if the\nfollowing holds: \n\\[w \\succeq^*_i w' \\enskip\\textrm{ if and only if }\\enskip u_i(w) \\geq u_i(w')\\]\n\n\n\nNotice how every weak linear order over a finite set of outcomes\ncorresponds to some utility function.\n\nWe refer to the related entries on\n preferences\n and\n decision-theory\n for a more detailed analysis on the role of preferences in philosophy\nand decision theory.\n2.2 Choices\n\nA game is also a description of what players can achieve, on their own\nor within coalitions. To formalize this we use effectivity functions,\nan abstract model of power introduced to study voting strategies in\ncommittees (Moulin & Peleg 1982).\n\nAn effectivity function (Moulin & Peleg 1982) is\na function \n\\[E:2^{N} \\to 2^{2^{W}}\\]\n\n\nassociating to each group of players a set of sets of outcomes.\n\nThe idea is that, whenever it is the case that \\(X\\in E(C)\\), then\ncoalition \\(C\\) is able to decide that the outcome of the game lies\ninside the set \\(X\\), and can therefore rule out the outcomes \\(W\n\\setminus X\\) from being eventually chosen. In other words \\(X\\) is\nwithin the power of coalition \\(C\\).\n\nEffectivity functions of games are closed under\nsupersets, i.e., we have that \\(X\\in E(C)\\) and \\(X\\subseteq\nY \\subseteq W\\) imply that \\(Y \\in E(C)\\). In other words, if \\(X\\) is\nwithin the power of coalition \\(C\\) then so is each of \\(X\\)\u2019s\nsupersets. From this, notice, it follows that if an effectivity\nfunction of a certain coalition is not empty then it always contains\nthe set of all outcomes.\n\nFor \\(\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq {2^{W}}\\) we denote \\(\\mathcal{X}^{+}\\)\nits superset closure.\n\n\nExample 4. Going back to the main example, consider\nthe power of each individual country. Because of the rules of the\ngame, no country is alone in position to rule out any outcome.\n\nResorting to effectivity functions: for each \\(i\\in N\\), we have that\n\\(E(\\{i\\}) = \\{W\\}\\).\n\nThis is however also the case for coalitions that are not big enough.\nFor instance, take all coalitions of at least two Countries that can\nbe formed between The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nE(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Belgium, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\{W\\}. \n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nBecause their total weight sums to at most to 5 votes, they are not,\non their own, able to settle for or rule out any possible agreement.\nIn fact, for acts proposed by the Commission, each coalition \\(C\\)\nwhose voting weight is not at least 12 has the same effectivity\nfunction \\(E(C) = \\{W\\}\\).\n\nFor the other coalitions, the situation is different. Consider for\ninstance the coalition made by France, Germany and Italy, which,\ntogether, have a voting weight of 12. For them we have that:\n\n\\[E(\\{\\textrm{France, Germany, Italy}\\}) = \\{\\{w\\} \\mid w \\in W\\}^{+}\\]\n\n\nThis means that the three members can, on their own, decide the\noutcome of the vote. This is true for every coalition of voting weight\n12 or more.\n\nWhat about the acts not proposed by the Commission? For them let us\nuse a different effectivity function, which we label \\(E^{*}\\).\n\nIn this case the winning coalition has to consist of at least four\nmembers.\n\nSo \\(E^{*}(\\{\\mbox{France, Germany, Italy}\\}) = \\{W\\}\\) while\n\\(E^{*}(\\{\\)France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands\\(\\}) = \\{\\{w\\}\n\\mid w \\in W\\}^{+}\\).\n\nIn general, it holds that \\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\geq 4\\).\nBecause of the properties of the voting game, we also have that\n\\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\leq 2\\). The difference is made by\ncoalitions of size 3: with \\(E^{*}\\), they can never achieve more than\n\\(\\{W\\}\\), while with \\(E\\) they can achieve \\(\\{\\{w\\} \\mid w \\in\nW\\}^{+}\\), if their voting power is at least 12. Notice that\nLuxembourg is irrelevant when it comes to bills proposed by the\nCommission, i.e., \\(E(C) = E(C \\cup \\textrm{ Luxembourg})\\). This is\nnot the case for the other bills, as we have observed.\n\n\nProperties of effectivity functions can be expressed in modal logic.\nTo do so it is important to observe that a dynamic\neffectivity function, essentially an effectivity function in each\nstate of the model, corresponds to a (non-normal) relation in a\nrelational structure. So what effectivity functions do is to induce a\nspecial kind of neighborhood structure, which we refer to as\nCoalition Model.\n\n\nDefinition 6 [Coalition Models]. A Coalition\nModel is a triple \\((W,E, V)\\) where:\n\n\\(W\\) is a nonempty set of states;\n\\(E: W \\longrightarrow (2^{N} \\longrightarrow 2^{2^W})\\) is a\ndynamic effectivity function;\n\\(V: W \\longrightarrow 2^{\\texttt{Atoms}}\\) is a valuation\nfunction.\n\n\n\nA coalition frame is a model without the valuation function.\nCoalition models are, of course, relational game structures in\ndisguise. As the reader will notice, dynamic effectivity functions\nallow each state to possibly have different power distributions among\ncoalitions. This is strictu sensu irrelevant for the\ntreatment of power in games\n (Section 3),\n where the effectivity functions associated to outcomes could as well\nbe taken to be equivalent everywhere in the model, but the model is\ngeneral enough to treat extensive and repeated interaction, where the\nsequential structure of the interaction is defined explicitly. We will\nusually abbreviate \\(E(w)(C)\\) as \\(E_w(C)\\) or even \\(E(C)\\) when\nclear from the context.\n\nThe language used to talk about Coalition Models is Coalition\nLogic (Pauly 2001), a non-normal modal logic to express\nchoices of groups of players. Coalition Logic is an extension of\npropositional logic with \\(|2^{N}|\\) modalities of the form \\([C]\\),\nso a modal operator each indexed with a coalition.\n\nThe satisfaction relation of the formulas of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\)\nwith respect to a pair \\(M,w\\) is defined as follows: \n\\[M,w\\models [C]\\varphi \\enskip\\textrm{if and only if}\\enskip \\varphi^M\\in E_w(C) \\]\n\n\nwhere, \\(\\varphi^M = \\{w\\in W \\mid M,w\\models\\varphi\\}\\).\n\nIntuitively \\(\\varphi^M\\in E_w(C)\\) means that coalition \\(C\\) is able\nto achieve property \\(\\varphi\\).\n\nAs closure under superset, or outcome monotonicity,\nis taken to be a property of all effectivity functions, the rule of\nmonotonicity is valid in Coalition Logic, which is therefore a\nmonotonic modal logic (Hansen 2003).\n\nThe rule of monotonicity takes this form for each \\(C\\subseteq\nN\\): \n\\[\\frac{\\varphi \\to \\psi}{[C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, if \\(C\\) is able to achieve \\(\\varphi\\) and we have that\n\\(\\varphi\\) implies \\(\\psi\\), then \\(C\\) is also able to achieve\n\\(\\psi\\).\n\nMathematical properties of power Apart from outcome\nmonotonicity, many other properties can be deemed necessary to model\ncoalitional power in games. For instance an effectivity function\ntypically has the following properties:\n\n\nliveness: i.e., \\(\\emptyset \\not\\in E(C)\\), for\neach \\(C\\subseteq N\\);\nsafety: i.e., \\(W \\in E(C)\\), for each\n\\(C\\subseteq N\\);\nregularity: i.e., \\(X \\in E(C)\\) implies that\n\\(\\overline{X} \\not\\in E(\\overline{C})\\), for each \\(C\\subseteq N, X\n\\subseteq W\\);\nN-maximality: i.e., \\(\\overline{X} \\in\nE(\\emptyset)\\) implies that \\({X} \\in E(N)\\) and \\(X \\subseteq\nW\\);\nsuperadditivity: i.e., \\(X\\in E(C)\\) and \\(Y \\in\nE(D)\\) implies that \\(X\\cap Y \\in E(C \\cup D)\\), for each \\(C\\), \\(D\n\\subseteq N\\), \\(C \\cap D = \\emptyset\\), \\(X,Y \\subseteq W\\);\ncoalition monotonicity: i.e., \\(X \\in E(C)\\)\nimplies that \\(X \\in E(D)\\), for each \\(C\\subseteq D \\subseteq N\\),\n\\(X \\subseteq W\\);\nwell-foundedness: i.e., \\(X \\in E(N)\\) implies\nthat \\(\\{x\\} \\in E(N)\\), for some \\(x \\in X\\), for each \\(X \\subseteq\nW\\).\n\n\n\nAn effectivity function is called playable (Pauly\n2001) if it has liveness, safety, N-maximality and\nsuperadditivity. It is called truly playable\n(Goranko, Jamroga, & Turrini 2013) if it is playable and\nwell-founded. Observe that if \\(W\\) is finite, an effectivity function\nis playable if and only if it is truly playable (Goranko et\nal. 2013).\n\nTrue playability is a fundamental property of effectivity functions of\ngames, and connects one-shot coalitional games to one-shot\nnon-cooperative games, as will be clear later.\n\nExample 5. The effectivity functions of our working\nexample are all truly playable.\n\nIn neighborhood structures, relations between set-theoretical and\nlogical properties are often immediate and standard correspondence\nresults between class of frames and neighborhood functions (Chellas\n1980) can be automatically used for Coalition Logic.\n\nCoalition Logic is in fact expressive enough to characterize all the\nconstraints mentioned so far, except the last one.\n\n\nProposition 7. Let \\(F=(W,E)\\) be a Coalition Frame,\nand \\(C,C^{\\prime}, C''\\) be coalitions, such that \\(C \\cap\nC'=\\emptyset\\) and \\(C \\subseteq C''\\). The following results\nhold:\n\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\varphi \\to \\neg [\\overline{C}]\\neg \\varphi\\) if\nand only if \\(E\\) is regular;\n\\(\\models_F [C]\\top\\) if and only if \\(E\\) has safety;\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\varphi \\to [C'']\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(E\\) is\ncoalition monotonic;\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [C] \\bot\\) if and only if \\(E\\) has\nliveness;\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [\\emptyset] \\neg \\varphi \\to [N]\\varphi\\) if and\nonly if \\(E\\) is N-maximal;\n\\(\\models_F [C^{\\prime}] \\varphi \\wedge [C]\\psi \\to [C^{\\prime}\n\\cup C](\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) if and only if \\(E\\) is\nsuperadditive;\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\psi \\models_F [C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi\\) if and only\nif \\(E\\) is outcome monotonic.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the axioms and deduction rule above are, in addition to\npropositional logic, sound and complete with respect to the class of\nall models with playable effectivity functions. For proofs, consult\nPauly 2001.\n\nCorrespondence results allow us to distinguish by modal means a number\nof classes of frames. However expressivity of the modal operators\nstrongly limit the capacity of the language to discern classes of\nstructures. To this extent the reader should notice that the logics of\nboth playable and truly playable effectivity frames share the fact\nthat \\(\\models_F [\\emptyset]\\top\\). However this proposition, whose\ninterpretation is that for each \\(w\\in W, \\{W\\} \\in E_w(\\emptyset)\\),\nis not sufficient to make a formal distinction between\n\\(E_w(\\emptyset)\\) in the two different classes of effectivity\nfunctions.\n\nAlong these lines, the following result tells us that Coalition Logic\nis also strong enough to reason about (or, if you prefer, too weak to\ndistinguish) truly playable effectivity functions.\n\nTheorem 8. (Goranko et al. 2013) Let\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be the class of playable frames and\n\\(\\mathcal{P}^{*}\\) the class of truly playable ones. Then, for every\nformula of Coalition Logic \\(\\varphi\\) \n\\[\\models_\\mathcal{P} \\varphi \\textrm{ if and only if } \\models_{\\mathcal{P}^{*}} \\varphi\\]\n\n\nThis follows from the fact that Playable Coalition Logic has the\nfinite model property (Pauly 2001) and, in finite models, playable\neffectivity functions are truly\n playable.[5]\n\nAs pointed out earlier on, this entry will only mention how knowledge\nis implicit in game structures but will not delve into the study of\nepistemic preconditions of rational play. Related entries devoted to\n epistemic logic,\n dynamic epistemic logic, and in particular\n epistemic game theory\n explore in depth the role of knowledge in decision-making. A\ntreatment of modal logics for games which focuses instead on the role\nof information is Hoek & Pauly 2006.\n3. Analyzing Power\n\nThis section looks at games in which individuals or groups take their\nchoices independently and concurrently, and, we stress once more,\nabstracting away from how the interaction evolves in time. It pays\nparticular attention to the relation between players\u2019 choices\nand preferences, mentioning the role of knowledge, and most\nimportantly it deals with how to express solution concepts in a\nlogical language.\n\nThe section first describes the general setting of cooperative games,\nthen it considers the more restricted and possibly better-known class\nof non-cooperative games.\n3.1 Cooperative Games and Their Logic\n\nThe description of the game given in a relational structure of the\nform \\((\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq, E)\\) is not enough to understand\nwhich exact outcome will be chosen in the end. For that we\nneed a solution concept, i.e., a mapping that associates to a game a\nset of outcomes of that game (Abdou & Keiding 1991). We here\nconsider the general setting of cooperative or\ncoalitional games, where \\(E: W \\rightarrow (2^N \\rightarrow\n2^{2^W})\\)is a (not necessarily playable) dynamic effectivity function\n(again, strictly speaking a dynamic effectivity function assigns a\ncoalitional game to each state/outcome).\n\nA number of solution concepts have been introduced for coalitional\ngames (see for instance Osborne & Rubinstein 1994, and Apt 2009\n(Other Internet Resources)). For the present purposes we are only\ngoing to discuss what is possibly the best-known: the core. The core\nis a collection of stable outcomes, i.e., outcomes for which no\ncoalition exists whose members are both able and willing to deviate\nfrom it. It can be seen as the set of outcomes to which there is\nno effective opposition (Abdou & Keiding 1991).\n\nFormally, given a relational structure \\(F=(\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq,\nE)\\), an outcome \\(w\\in W\\) is said to be stable (in\n\\(v\\)) if there is no coalition \\(C\\) and set of outcomes \\(X\\subseteq\nW\\) such that both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\\(X \\in E_v(C)\\)\n\\(y \\in X\\) and \\(i\\in C\\) implies that \\(y \\succ_i w\\)\n\n\nIn words, an outcome is stable if there is no group of individuals\nthat can achieve an alternative that they all strictly prefer.\n\nThe core is the collection of all stable\noutcomes.\n\nExample 6. Consider the outcome 1M, which is the only\noutcome that Germany reckons acceptable. Germany, as already observed,\nhave an effectivity function of \\(E(\\{\\textrm{Germany}\\})=\\{W\\}\\) so,\non their own, are not able to turn their preference into an outcome.\nHowever, together with other Countries, they are able to do so.\nSuppose their allies are Belgium, France and The Netherlands. Is 1M\nthen a good outcome? If we look at the preferences of the\nother players in the coalition, i.e., Belgium, France, The\nNetherlands, we observe the following. Belgium had rather an outcome\nbetween 4M and 5M, France and The Netherlands exactly 5M. These\nCountries could get together and select 5M, which is an outcome that\nis acceptable to them. However the effectivity function of\n\\(\\{\\)Belgium, France, The Netherlands\\(\\}\\) is \\(E(\\{\\)Belgium,\nFrance, The Netherlands\\(\\})=\\{W\\}\\), which means that the three\nCountries are not enough to pass the 5M bill. But the coalition made\nby Belgium, France, Italy and The Netherlands would be. Notice\nmoreover that 5M is one of Italy\u2019s preferred outcomes. 5M is in\nfact the only stable outcome of the game: there is no coalition that\nis together willing and capable of deviating from it.\n\nModal logic can be used to represent the core, with\n\\(E_w(C)\\)interpreting \\([C]\\)as before. Consider first the\nformula \n\\[p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nThis says that if \\(p\\) is true then members of some coalition can\nimprove upon some \\(p\\) world, which does not seem the right\nformula to express stability in logic. However we can prove the\nfollowing results, which utilizes the correspondence between the\nformula and a specific class of frames.\n\nLet \\(E\\) be an (outcome monotonic) effectivity function and let\n\\(\\succeq_i\\) be a weak linear order. Then: \n\\[(F,V'), w \\models p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nholds at \\(w\\) for every \\(V'\\) if and only there exists a\n\\(C\\subseteq N\\) and \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) such that, for all \\(i\\in C\\),\n\\(x\\in X\\) we have that \\(x \\succ_i w\\).\n\nSo the formula holds at \\(w\\) for every valuation if and only if \\(w\\)\ndoes not belong to the core. Clearly, if the formula is false at an\noutcome and some valuation, then this means that the outcome does\nbelong to the core.\n\nNotice that, since effectivity functions are outcome monotonic, if we\nhave that if \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) and \n\\[X \\subseteq \\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C} \\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V')},\\]\n\n\nthen \n\\[\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C} \\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V')} \\in E_w(C).\\]\n\n\nAlso notice that the result above allows for the case of\n\n\\[\\emptyset=\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{M} \\in E_w(C),\\]\n\n\nwhich might be counterintuitive. Requiring \\(E\\) to have liveness\ntakes care of this.\n\nNotice also how we had to impose a universal quantification on the set\nof valuations. Without this explicit quantification, the formula would\nonly hold for one specific model, which would not be an appropriate\nsolution. If instead we are only interested in knowing whether\nthere exists some outcome that is stable or, conversely,\nwhether the core is empty, it is sufficient to require the formula\nabove to be valid. This would amount to say that no outcome\nis stable, i.e., that the core is empty.\n\n\nProposition 10. Let \\(F\\) be a frame with \\(E_w =\nE_v\\)for every \\(w,v \\in W\\). We have that \n\\[\\models_F p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nif and only if no outcome in \\(F\\) belongs to the core.\n\n\nAgain, liveness would take care of the trivial case in which\n\n\\[\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V)}=\\emptyset.\\]\n\n\nAn alternative approach is to identify each outcome with a name (or,\nin the language of hybrid logic, a nominal) in the language.\nThen we have the following.\n\n\nProposition 11. Let \\(w_k\\) an atomic proposition be\ntrue at outcome \\(w_k\\) and only at outcome \\(w_k\\). \n\\[(F,V), w_k \\models w_k \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i w_k\\right)\\]\n\n\nif and only if \\(w_k\\) does not belong to the core.\n\n\nYet another alternative is to have atoms for coalitional power\n(\u00c5gotnes, van der Hoek and Wooldridge 2009): \\((F,V), w \\models\np_C\\) iff \\(w \\in E_w(C)\\). Then:\n\n\nProposition 12. Let \\(w_k\\) an atomic proposition be\ntrue at outcome \\(w_k\\) and only at outcome \\(w_k\\). \n\\[((F,V), w \\models \\bigvee_{C \\subseteq N} \\diamond^\\succ p_C\\]\n\n\nif and only if \\(w\\) does not belong to the core in \\(E_w\\).\n\n\nEmptyness of the core of \\(E_w\\)can then furthermore be expressed\nusing the universal modality \\(A\\) from Section 2.1: \\((F,V), w\n\\models A(\\bigvee_{C \\subseteq N} \\diamond^\\succ p_C)\\).\n\nSo depending on the properties we are interested in, different\nextensions of basic modal logic combined with different forms of\nvalidity (at a world vs model vs frame) are best-suited to express\nthem.\n3.2 Non-cooperative Games and Their Logic\n\nNon-cooperative games are a representation of what individuals, rather\nthan coalitions, can achieve, and what their preferences are.\n\nFormally, a strategic game form is a tuple \n\\[(N, W, \\{\\Sigma_i\\}_{i\\in N}, o)\\]\n\n\nwhere N is a finite set of players, \\(W\\) a set of outcomes,\n\\(\\{\\Sigma_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) a collection of strategies, one for each\nplayer \\(i\\), \\(o: \\prod_{i\\in N} \\Sigma_i \\to W\\) an outcome\nfunction, associating a tuple of strategies to an outcome.\n\nA non-cooperative game is a tuple \\((S,\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N})\\),\nwhere \\(S\\) is a strategic game form and \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) a\ncollection of preference relations, one for each player \\(i\\).\n\n\nExample 7. If we think of the Countries in our\nprevious example as individual players and their votes as individual\nstrategies, we can model the Treaty of Rome game as a non-cooperative\ngame, where each individual can vote an amount of money to dedicate to\nborder protection and preferences are as above.\n\nThe outcome function will take care to associate to each individual\nplayer\u2019s vote the final outcome of the collective decision,\ne.g., selecting an outcome voted by a set of Countries with voting\nweight of at least 12, or resulting in no decision if no consensus is\nreached.\n\nFor instance:\n\nFrance vote 0M\nBelgium vote 2M\nItaly vote 10M\nGermany vote 0M\nThe Netherlands vote 0M\nLuxembourg vote 0M\n\n\nThis round results in no decision, because no outcome has collected\nvoting weight of at least 12.\n\nHowever, suppose that the second round is such that everyone but\nBelgium stick to their vote, and assume Belgium switches to voting 0M.\nNow 0M has an aggregate of 13, which means it is chosen as the final\ndecision.\n\n\nLooking at the unified treatment of our example, there seem to be\nrelationship between non-cooperative games and cooperative games. This\nrelationship can be specified formally.\n\nLet us first consider what a group of players can do in a game. To do\nso we define the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function, a\nmathematical description of coalitional strategies in a game in terms\nof the sets outcomes that they can force.\n\n\nDefinition 12. [\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function] Let\n\\(S\\) be a non-cooperative game. We define the \\(\\alpha\\) effectivity\nfunction of \\(S\\), \\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)\\), where \\(\\overline{C}\\) is the\ncomplement of \\(C\\):\n\n\\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)= \\{X\\ \\mid\\) there exists \\(\\sigma_C\\) such that for\nall \\(\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}}\\) we have that\n\\(o(\\sigma_C,\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}})\\in X \\}\\)\n\n\nIntuitively the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of \\(S\\) collects, for\nevery group of players, the set of outcomes that they can achieve by\nfixing a strategy of theirs, no matter how their opponents play.\n\nThe following result shows the relationship between strategies and\neffectivity functions.\n\nTheorem 13 (Goranko et al. 2013). An\neffectivity function is truly playable if and only if it is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some non-cooperative game.\n\nThis is a generalization of the result in Peleg 1998 for finite games,\nstarting from models of non-cooperative games first defined in Pauly\n2001. In a nutshell what these results imply is the following.\n\n\nProposition 14. Let \\(F\\) be a relational game\nstructure. Then \\(E_w\\) is the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some\nnon-cooperative game, for each \\(w \\in W\\), if and only if the\nfollowing formulas are valid in \\(F\\) for disjoint\n\\(C,C^{\\prime}\\):\n\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\psi \\models_F [C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi\\)\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\top\\)\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [C] \\bot\\)\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [\\emptyset] \\varphi \\to [N]\\varphi\\)\n\\(\\models_F [C^{\\prime}] \\varphi \\wedge [C]\\psi \\to [C^{\\prime}\n\\cup C](\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\)\n\n\n\nIn the same way we did for cooperative games, we can ask ourselves\nwhether an outcome is stable, or rational, in a strategic\nsituation.\n\nNash equilibrium and definability The main solution\nconcept to analyze non-cooperative games is Nash equilibrium.\nInformally a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one per\nplayer, such that no player is interested to change his or her\nstrategy, given the others stick to theirs. Formally, a strategy\nprofile \\(\\sigma\\) is a (pure strategy) Nash\nequilibrium if for all players \\(i\\in N\\) and for all\n\\(\\sigma'_i\\in \\Sigma_i\\) we have that \n\\[o(\\sigma_i,\\sigma_{-i}) \\succeq_i o(\\sigma'_i,\\sigma_{-i})\\]\n\n\n\nExample 8. Consider the following vote\n\nFrance vote 5M\nBelgium vote 5M\nItaly vote 10M\nGermany vote 1M\nThe Netherlands vote 5M\nLuxembourg vote 5M\n\n\nIn this game there is no consensus on any budget. The situation might\nlook like a deadlock, as everyone has voted according to their\npreference. However the outcome is disagreement, which no player\nprefers to any agreement. The only way that players can converge to an\nagreement is that Italy change their vote to 5M. If this happens 5M is\nachieved as an outcome.\n\nNotice that the modified game, in which Italy vote 5M is a Nash\nequilibrium.\n\nConsider now a modification of the game above, in which Italy and The\nNetherlands vote 10M, while the others stick to their vote.\nSurprisingly, despite the disagreement, this is Nash equilibrium,\nbecause no player is simultaneously able to get to some agreement,\nalthough being willing to do so.\n\n\nHow to express Nash equilibria in logic? Recall how the formula\n\n\\[p\\to \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nholds at a frame \\(F\\) if and only if the core is empty, and a hybrid\nlogic extension can tell us whether a specific outcome belongs to the\ncore. If \\(F\\) is based on a truly playable effectivity function we\nalready have a non-cooperative form game version of the core: an\noutcome such that no coalition is together able and willing to deviate\nfrom, not taking into account what the others do. However\nNash Equilibrium fixes a profile of strategies, such that no player is\nable and willing to deviate from there. In other words it requires the\nnotion of best response for a player with respect to a given\nprofile.\n\nFormalisms such as Coalition Logic are too weak to express Nash\nequilibria. However, they can express the fact that certain\neffectivity functions allow for the possibility of a Nash equilibrium.\nThis is what in Hansen & Pauly 2002 is called Nash-consistent\nCoalition Logic. Nash Equilibrium is in fact not definable in basic\nmodal logic (van Benthem et al. 2011), but it can be done\nwith a modality that intersects both the preference and the\nchoice relations (van Benthem et al. 2011) (for choice\nrelations see Section 3.2.2 below).\n\n\n\\((F,V),w\\models \\langle \\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\varphi\\) if\nand only if \\(w(\\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i)w'\\) implies that \\(w'\\models\n\\varphi \\)\n\n\nThen the best response for \\(i\\) is defined as \\( \\langle \\approx_i\n\\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\top\\), as there is no alternative that is at the\nsame time achievable and preferable to \\(i\\). Alternatively a hybrid\nlogic that mentions strategy profiles in the language can provide a\nsolution, similarly to the case of the core.\n3.2.1 Injective Games and PDL with Intersection\n\nThe general definition of non-cooperative games given above allows\ngames where two different strategy profiles lead to the same outcome,\ni.e., where \\(o(\\sigma) = o(\\sigma')\\) for \\(\\sigma \\neq \\sigma'\\)-\nwhere the outcome function is not injective. However in game\ntheory injectivity is very often implicitly or explicitly assumed.\nIndeed, outcomes are often identified with strategy profiles.\n\nIt is thus a natural question what happens to Coalition Logic when we\nrestrict non-cooperative games to be injective. The answer is that,\nfirst, not much: the language of Coalition Logic cannot discern\nbetween injective and non-injective games (Goranko et al.\n2006). But, second, the class of effectivity functions changes: not\nall truly playable effectivity functions are \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity\nfunctions of injective games.\n\nRecall the well-foundedness property of effectivity\nfunctions: if \\(X \\in E(N)\\)then \\(\\{x\\} \\in E(N)\\) for some \\(x \\in\nX\\). This is in fact equivalent (Goranko et al. 2013) to the\nproperty that \\(E(\\emptyset)\\) has a complete non-monotonic\ncore. The non-monotonic core \\(E^{nc}(C)\\)of \\(E(C)\\) its minimal\nelements: \\(E^{nc}(C) = \\{X \\in E(C) : \\neg \\exists Y (Y \\in E(C)\n\\text{ and } Y \\subset X\\}\\). The non-monotonic core is\ncomplete if and only if for every \\(X \\in E(C)\\) there is a\n\\(Y \\in E^{nc}(C)\\) such that \\(Y \\subseteq X\\). While true\nplayability implies that the non-monotonic core for the empty\ncoalition is complete, that is not the case for arbitrary\ncoalitions.\n\nIt is, however, for injective games: in addition to the true\nplayability properties, the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity functions of\ninjective games have a complete non-monotonic core for all\ncoalitions. In addition, the non-monotonic core has some\nstructural properties. In more detail, we say that an effectivity\nfunction \\(E\\) is injectively playable (\u00c5gotnes and\nAlechina 2015) iff it is truly playable and has the following\nadditional properties, for all \\(C, i, j, X, Y\\):\n\n\\(E(C)\\) has a complete non-monotonic core;\n\\(E^{nc}(C) = \\{\\bigcap_{i \\in C} X_i : X_i \\in E^{nc}(\\{i\\})\\}\\)\nwhen \\(C \\neq \\emptyset\\);\nif \\(X, Y \\in E^{nc}(\\{i\\})\\) and \\(X \\neq Y\\) then \\(X \\cap Y =\n\\emptyset\\);\nif \\(X \\in E^{nc}(j)\\) and \\(x \\in X\\) then \\(\\exists Y \\in\nE^{nc}(i), x \\in Y\\).\n\n\nIt follows that \\(E(C)\\) is completely determined by its non-monotonic\ncore.\n\nTheorem 15. (\u00c5gotnes and Alechina 2015) An\neffectivity function is injectively playable if and only if it is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some injective non-cooperative\ngame.\n\nIntersection plays a key role in the effectivity of\ncoalitions in games: intuitively, the power of a coalition is the\nintersection of the power of the individuals in the coalition. A\nnatural idea then, due to van Benthem 2012, is that coalitional power\ncould perhaps be expressed by using intersection\nmodalities. This is indeed the case, in the following precise\nsense (\u00c5gotnes and Alechina 2015): there is a satsifiability\npreserving translation from Coalition Logic to Propositional Dynamic\nLogic with Intersection (Gargov et al. 1988). This\ntranslation relies on the fact that for every non-injective game there\nis a (Coalition Logic) equivalent injective game.\n3.2.2 Non-monotonic Action Logics\n\nSome logics exploit a more compact representation of those relational\nstructures that correspond to non-cooperative games.\n\nRather than using effectivity functions, each player \\(i\\) is\nassociated with an equivalence relation \\(\\approx_i \\subseteq W\\times\nW\\), whose induced partition represent the choices he or she can\nperform. These equivalence relations describe the exact set of choices\nthat a group of players can perform and the originating models are\nreferred to as consequentialist in the literature (see for\ninstance Belnap, Perloff, & Ming 2001).\n\nNow define an effectivity function \\(E^{*}\\) for which it holds\nthat \n\\[E^{*}(i)= \\{[x] \\mid x' \\in [x] \\mbox{ whenever } x \\approx_i x' \\}^{+}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively \\(E^{*}(i)\\) collects what exactly the\nindividuals can achieve and all their supersets.\n\n\n\\(E^{*}\\) is called consequentialist if holds\nthat:\n\n\\(E^{*}(C)= \\{\\bigcap_{i\\in C} X_i \\mid \\mbox{for some } X_i \\in\nE^{*}(i)\\}\\)\n\\(\\emptyset\\not\\in E^{*}(C)\\) for each \\(C\\neq N\\)\n\\(E^{*}(N) = \\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in W\\}^{+}\\)\n\n\n\nNotice that \\(E^*\\) is a truly playable effectivity function.\n\nThe last property is well-foundedness, as in the case of arbitrary\neffectivity functions. This is not a property that is assumed in all\nvariants, e.g., the choice structures in Kooi & Tamminga 2008 and\nits temporal variant STIT (Belnap et al. 2001) do not.\nHowever, as observed in Turrini 2012 and Tamminga 2013, well-founded\nconsequentialist models correspond to non-cooperative games and the\neffectivity function \\(E\\) can be effectively simulated by the\nequivalence relation \\(\\approx_i\\) for each player. Intuitively\n\\(E^{*}(i)\\) is the set of sets of outcomes that \\(i\\) can choose\nwithout being able to refine further.\n\nTo reason about consequentialist models, we use so-called\nconsequentialist logics, i.e., propositional logic extended with\nmodalities of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\), interpreted as follows:\n\n\\(M,w \\models [C]\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(M,w'\\models \\varphi\\) for\nall \\(w'\\) such that \\(w (\\bigcap_{i \\in C} \\approx_i)w'\\)\n\nConsequentialist logics have been developed to reason about action and\nconsequence, and have interesting applications in deontic logic, such\nas Kooi & Tamminga 2008; Tamminga 2013; Turrini 2012. They are\nmoreover the basis of temporal logics of strategy such as STIT and\nstrategic STIT, discussed later. A special case are the logics of\npropositional control (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005; Troquard, Hoek,\n& Wooldridge 2009).\n3.2.3 Quantified and Higher-order Coalition Logic\n\nMany interesting properties of power in games involve quantifying over\ncoalitions, for example the notion of agent \\(i\\) being a weak\nveto player (Wooldridge and Dunne 2004) with respect to \\(\\phi\\),\nin the sense that any coalition that can enforce \\(\\phi\\) must include\n\\(i\\), or, in some first or higher-order extension of Coalition Logic:\n\\(\\forall C ([C]\\phi \\rightarrow i \\in C)\\). Quantified Coalition\nLogic (QCL) (\u00c5gotnes et al. 2008) extends\nCoalition Logic with a limited form of quantification over coalitions,\nwithout making the resulting logic undecidable or indeed increasing\nthe computational complexity of the satisfiability problem. In QCL\ncoalitions inside modalities are replaced with coalition predicates.\nIntuitively, \\([P]\\phi\\) (\\(\\langle P \\rangle \\phi\\)) means that any\n(some) coalition satisfying the predicate \\(P\\) has the ability to\nenforce \\(\\phi\\). As an example, \\(i\\) is a weak veto player for\n\\(\\phi\\): \n\\[ \\neg \\langle \\neg supseteq(\\{i\\})\\rangle \\phi \\]\n\n\n\u2013 it is not the case that any coalition that is not a superset\nof \\(\\{i\\}\\) has the power to enforce \\(\\phi\\). Or that \\(i\\) is a\ndictator for \\(\\phi\\): \\(\\neg \\langle \\neg\nsupseteq(\\{i\\})\\rangle \\phi \\wedge [supseteq(\\{i\\})]\\phi\\).\nSuch properties, and indeed all properties that can be expressed in\nQCL, can already be expressed in Coalition Logic, by using disjunction\nand conjunction to quantify over coalitions, but those expressions\nwould typically be exponentially long in the number of agents. QCL can\nexpress such properties concisely, and indeed is exponentially more\nsuccinct than Coalition Logic. QCL can also be further extended with\nBelief-Intention-Desire (BDI) logic (Chen et al. 2014)\nwithout increasing complexity.\n\nHigher-order Coalition Logic (HCL) (Boella et al.\n2010) extends QCL with to a monadic second-order language, unifying\nthe languages for describing coalitions and for describing their power\nand significantly extending the expressive power. Expressive tractable\nfragments of HCL exist (Doherty et al. 2011).\n3.2.4 Probabilities and Resource Bounds\n\nAs we have seen, the (truly playable) effectivity functions of\nCoalition Logic correspond to games where a joint strategy profile for\nthe set of all agents uniquely determines the outcome. Colition Logic\ncan be modified in several ways (Naumov et al. 2021) to deal\nwith stochastic games, i.e., where such a profile only\ndetermines a probability distribution over the set of possible\noutcomes. Having modalities \\([C]_p \\phi\\) interpreted as \"\\(C\\) can\nenforce \\(\\phi\\) with probability \\(p\\)\" leads to interesting and\nnon-trivial (in)valid properties, such as the following variant of\nsuperadditivity \\((C \\cap C' = \\emptyset)\\) \n\\[ [C]_p(\\phi\\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow\n([C']_q \\phi \\rightarrow [C \\cup C']_{max\\{p,q\\}} \\psi) \\]\n\n\nnot being valid, while \n\\[ [N]_{p+q+r}(\\phi \\vee \\psi\\vee \\sigma)\n\\rightarrow [N]_{2p}(\\phi \\vee \\psi) \\vee [N]_{2q}(\\psi \\vee \\sigma)\n\\vee [N]_{2r} (\\phi \\vee \\sigma) \\]\n\n\n(where \\(N\\) is the set of all agents) is valid.\n\nAs an alternative to stochastic transitions, games with stochastic\nfailures can be considerered, which from a logical viewpoint\nare somewhat easier to deal with (Naumov et al. 2021).\nInterpreting \\([C]_p \\phi\\) as \"\\(C\\) can has a joint strategy to\nensure that \\(\\phi\\) is true in each outcome and which is guaranteed\nnot to fail with probability at least \\(p\\) no matter what the other\nagents do\", we get, e.g., that the variant of the superadditivity\naxiom mentioned above holds.\n\nResource bounds have also been added to coalitional\nmodalities, interpreted in coalition models corresponding to games\nwith costs on performing joint actions (Alechina et al.\n2009). Here, \\([C^b]\\phi\\) means that \\(C\\) can force \\(\\phi\\) to be\ntrue under resource bound \\(b\\), i.e., that they can chose a joint\naction costing at most \\(b\\) that will ensure that \\(\\phi\\) is true.\nThese modalities satisfy the following variant of superadditivity \\((C\n\\cap D = \\emptyset, C \\neq \\emptyset, D \\neq \\emptyset)\\):\n\n\\[ [C^b]\\phi \\wedge [D^d]\\psi \\rightarrow [(C \\cup D)^{b+d}](\\phi \\wedge \\psi). \\]\n\n3.2.5 Conditional Power and Coordination\n\nFrom the viewpoints of truly playable effectivity functions and\nCoalition Logic, two games are equivalent if coalitions have the same\npower as defined by \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity. Van Benthem et\nal. 2019 point out, however, that there are meaningful\ndifferences between games with same \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity, due to\nmonotonicity: \\(\\{w,v\\} \\in E(C)\\) might be the case for two\ndifferent reasons. First, it might be that there is a joint action by\n\\(C\\) such that there is a joint action by the other agents such that\nthe outcome will be \\(w\\) and there is another joint action\nby the other agents such that the outcome will be \\(v\\), or, second,\nit might be that that is true for only \\(w\\) or \\(v\\) (in\nwhich case \\(\\{w\\} \\in E(C)\\) or \\(\\{v\\} \\in E(C)\\)). The first kind\nof power is called basic power by van Benthem et al.\n2019, who characterise the properties of effectivity functions of\nbasic power in the two-agent case and gives a sound and complete\naxiomatisation using a variant of Instantial Neighbourhood Logic (INL)\n(van Benthem et al. 2010) which again is an extension of\nstandard modal logic with neighborhood semantics. One significance of\nbasic power is that it captures all the outcome sets in which the\nother players are free to chose any state, given the choice of one of\nthose outcome states for some coalition.\n\nSeveral extensions of the Coalition Logic language have also been\ndeveloped to reason about conditional and inter-related power between\nagents and coalitions, typically combining existential and universal\nquantification over choices. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 introduce\nextended coalition operators of the form \n\\[ [C](\\phi; \\psi_1, \\ldots, \\psi_k) \\]\n\n\nwith the intuitive meaning that \\(C\\) has the power to make \\(\\phi\\)\ntrue while at the same time making it possible that the other agents\nat the same time can achieve any of the objectives \\(\\psi_1,\\ldots,\n\\psi_k\\). The resulting logic can also be seen as a multi-agent\nextension of INL. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 also introduce operators of\nthe form \n\\[ [C_1\\triangleright\\phi_1, \\ldots, C_n\\triangleright \\phi_n] \\]\n\n\nwith the intuitive meaning that the coalition \\(C = C_1 \\cup \\cdots\nC_n\\) has a joint strategy such that, for each \\(i\\), the restriction\nof that joint strategy to coalition \\(C_i\\) enforces objective\n\\(\\phi_i\\).\n\nGoranko and Ju 2022 notice that the latter type of operator can be\nused to express a certain kind of conditional power, namely\n\\([A \\triangleright \\phi, A \\cup B \\triangleright \\psi]\\), intuitively\nsaying that \\(A\\) have a joint action that enforces \\(\\phi\\) while at\nthe same time enables \\(B\\) to apply a joint action that will enforce\n\\(\\psi\\). They also introduce two additional conditional power\nmodalities: \n\\[ [A]_\\alpha(\\phi; \\langle B\\rangle\\psi) \\text{ and } [A]_\\beta(\\phi; \\langle B\\rangle\\psi) \\]\n\n\nwhere the former says that \\(B \\setminus A\\) have a joint strategy\nsuch that if \\(A\\) applies any action that ensures \\(\\phi\\), then that\njoint strategy (by \\(B\\setminus A\\)) at the same time ensures\n\\(\\psi\\), and the latter that for any joint action by \\(A\\) that\nenforces \\(\\phi\\) there is a consistent joint action by \\(B\\) that at\nthe same time enforces \\(\\psi\\). These notions of power correspond to\n\\(\\alpha\\)- and \\(\\beta\\)- effectivity, respectively.\n\nCoordination is an issue not only between different coalitions, but\nalso between the agents in the coalition \\(C\\) in the interpretation\nof \\([C]\\phi\\). In Coalition Logic it is implicitly assumed, like it\noften is (Schelling 1960), that the agents in \\(C\\) somehow can\ncoordinate their actions to achieve the outcome \\(\\phi\\). Hawke 2017\nintroduces a new variant of the coalition modalities that captures a\nstronger notion of coalitional ability, relaxes the assumption about\ncoordination (in the case of two agents). Contrary to \\([C],\\) these\nnew modalities \\(((C))\\) are not monotonic.\n3.2.6 Dynamic Coalition Logic\n\nInspired by the model update semantics of\n dynamic epistemic logic,\n Coalition Logic has been extended in several ways with dynamic\nmodalities modeling changes in the ability of coalitions in different\nways. Broersen, Meyer and Turrini 2009 add expressions of the form\n\\([C \\downarrow \\psi]\\phi\\) with the intuitive meaning that after\n\\(C\\) chooses \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\phi\\) holds. \u00c5gotnes and Galimullin\n2021 add modalities for adding and removing actions and ability,\ninspired by arrow update logic: \\([(\\phi,a,\\psi)^+]\\gamma\\)\nintuitively means that after the coalition model is updated by, in\neach \\(\\phi\\)-state, adding a new action for agent \\(a\\) such that no\nmatter what the other agents do that action will guarantee \\(\\psi\\),\nthen \\(\\gamma\\) holds. There are similar modalities for removing\nability. \u00c5gotnes and Galimullin 2023 extend Coalition Logic with\nmore general and expressive modalities for coalitional action\nmodels, inspired by epistemic action models.\n3.2.7 Logic-Based Games\n\nIn many situations agents have control over certain propositional\nvariables (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005), for instance they can be\nresponsible for traffic flow or they can veto a certain issue.\nVariables can also be shared (Gerbrandy 2006), an example being\nvoting, where players share control over a variable whose realization\nis determined by a certain aggregation function, e.g., majority\n(Troquard, Hoek, & Wooldridge 2011). These logics of\npropositional control specify what propositions agents have\nin their effectivity function. For instance, if agent \\(i\\) controls\n\\(p\\), then both \\(p^{M}\\) and \\(\\neg p^{M}\\) are in his or her\neffectivity function. In a way these models are very special types of\neffectivity function, and what agents control can be seen as a choice,\nor a strategy, available to them.\n\nLogics for propositional control have modalities of the type\n\\([[i]]\\varphi\\), meaning that player \\(i\\) has a\n\u201ccontrol\u201d strategy to see to it that, no matter how the\nother agents choose their control strategies, then \\(\\varphi\\) holds\nin the end. But they also have modalities of the type\n\\([[C]]\\varphi\\), meaning that players in \\(C\\) have a joint control\nstrategy ensuring \\(\\varphi\\) in the end. A strategy profile is thus\nequivalent to a valuation function, which assigns a truth value of\nevery proposition available. In turn, a strategy of a player \\(i\\) can\nthus be seen as a partial valuation function, that assigns a truth\nvalue only to the propositions controlled by \\(i\\).\n\nSlightly abusing notation, we say that a valuation \\(V\\) satisfies a\nformula \\(\\varphi\\), denoted \\(V \\models \\varphi\\), whenever it makes\n\\(\\varphi\\) true under the current assignment of propositions. In\nother words, propositional control games are played in one single\nworld, and the individual assignments determine what propositions are\ntrue are that world. Denoting \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) the set of all\nvaluations and \\(\\mathcal{V}_i\\) to the partial ones under the control\nof \\(i\\) we have the following.\n\n\\((F,V) \\models [[C]]\\varphi\\) if and only if for all \\(i \\in C\\),\nthere exists \\(V'_i \\in \\mathcal{V}_i\\) such that, for all \\(k \\in\n\\overline{C}, V'_{k}\\in \\mathcal{V}_k\\), we have that \\((F,V')\\models\n\\varphi\\)\n\nSo when \\([[C]]\\varphi\\) holds, coalition \\(C\\) can play a control\nstrategy in such a way that no matter what the control strategy is\nthat their opponents play, the resulting outcome satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\).\n\nLogics for propositional control can be extended to goal-based\nformalisms, the so called Boolean games (Harrenstein, van der Hoek,\nMeyer, & Witteveen 2001): propositions are partitioned among the\nplayers, with each player controlling the set of propositions he or\nshe is assigned to. On top of that each player is also assigned a\nformula of propositional logic which is meant to be his or her goal\nand whose realization might not only depend upon the choices he or she\nis able to make.\n\nBoolean games have been extensively studied in the field of\nmulti-agent systems, as simple and compact models to represent\nstrategic interaction in a logic-based setting (Dunne & Hoek 2004;\nDunne & Wooldridge 2012; Dunne, Hoek, Kraus, & Wooldridge\n2008).\n\nIn their most general variants they are an extension of logics with\npropositional control, where each agent is assigned a goal formula.\nThe goal formula is a satisfiable formula of the language and the\nimportant feature is that the goal of each agent does not need to be\nunder his or her control.\n\nFor instance, agent \\(i\\) may be assigned the control of proposition\n\\(p\\) only, but might have the goal that \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\). So\nwhether \\(i\\)\u2019s goal is satisfied depends not only on \\(i\\)\nsetting proposition \\(p\\) to be true, but also some other agent, say\n\\(j\\), setting proposition \\(q\\) to be true. Agent \\(j\\), on the other\nhand, might or might not be interested in having \\(q\\) set to true.\nFor instance he or she may want proposition \\(r\\) to be true, and\ntherefore being indifferent to whether \\(q\\) or \\(\\overline{q}\\) is\nrealized in the end. Or might even have the goal that\n\\(\\overline{q}\\).\n\nIn Boolean games some objectives can be realized all together, for\ninstance agents might all want \\(p \\vee \\neg q\\) to be true, or it\nmight be the case that certain valuations do not realize the\nobjectives of all agents, but no unhappy agent is able to improve his\nor her own situation by changing the assignment to the propositional\nvariables he or she controls. This situation is a very simple form of\nNash equilibrium that can be expressed in Boolean games.\n\nSo, for \\(\\gamma_i\\) being the objective of player \\(i\\) and \\(v_i\\) a\npartial valuation that is under control of player \\(i\\), we say that\nvaluation \\(v\\) is a Nash equilibrium if we have that for each \\(i\\)\nand each \\(v'_i\\). \n\\[(v_i,v_{-i}) \\not\\models\\gamma_i \\mbox{ implies that } (v'_i,v_{-i})\n\\not\\models\\gamma_i\\]\n\n\nSo if \\(v\\) does not satisfy \\(i\\)\u2019s goal, there is nothing\n\\(i\\) can do to satisfy it.\n\nThe analysis of Nash equilibria in Boolean game shows a close\ncorrespondence between these games and propositional logic: using a\nreduction to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic\nformulas, the problem of checking whether an outcome \\(v\\) is a Nash\nequilibrium of a Boolean game is co-NP complete (Wooldridge, Endriss,\nKraus, & Lang 2013).\n\nAnother common approach to concisely representing certain classes of\ngames, in addition to representing payoffs qualitatively, is to impose\nrestrictions on the payoff functions. An approach combining the two is\nfound in Das et al. 2023, in which Monadic Least Fixed Point\nlogic is used to express the existence of pure strategy Nash\nequilibria for games with pairwise separable payoff functions.\n4. Conclusions: On the Right Level of Analysis\n\nRecall the very first example, in which the set of outcomes of a\nvoting game could be described only considering the overall outcome of\nthe vote or by explicitly describing what each of the Countries had\nvoted.\n\nOften times, when describing mathematical structures by succinct\nlanguages we are confronted with the question of which one is the most\nsuitable language. Some are able to express preferences, knowledge and\ncoalitional ability all together, some others only two of these,\nsome others only one. Finally some languages might only be able\nto express what individuals, and not coalitions, can achieve.\n\nAgain, there is no right answer to this question. It all depends on\nwhat the fundamental characteristics are that one is trying to model.\nTo express Nash equilibria in a coordination game, there is no need\nfor a temporal logic-based formalism. On the contrary, if one wants to\nexpress backwards induction, then a language that does not make the\nsequential structure of the decision problem explicit is probably not\nthe right one.\n\nGoing back to our example, some Countries might have preferences over\nhow other Countries vote, and this might affect their decision-making,\nchanging the overall equilibrium points of the game. If this is the\ncase then the richer language matters. Otherwise, if we can safely\nrule out this possibility, the more succinct language seems to be the\nappropriate choice.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abdou, Joseph and Hans Keiding, 1991, <em>Effectivity Functions in\nSocial Choice</em>, (Theory and Decision Library 8), Dordrecht:\nSpringer Netherlands, doi:10.1007/978-94-011-3448-4", "\u00c5gotnes, Thomas, Alechina, Natasha, 2015, \u201cEmbedding\nCoalition Logic in the Minimal Normal Multimodal Logic with\nIntersection\u201d, in S.
