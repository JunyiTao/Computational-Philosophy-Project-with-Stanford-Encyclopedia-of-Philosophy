    "main_text": "Ethics || Moral Psychology\n7.2 Moral Psychology\n\nAt the beginning of his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle\nremarked that \u201cthe good is that at which all things aim.\u201d\nEach thing, therefore, aims at the good, according to the demands of\nits nature. In the Middle Ages, \u201cAristotelians\u201d like\nThomas Aquinas held that the good for human beings in particular is\n\u201chappiness,\u201d the enjoyment of the direct vision of God in\nthe next life. And, whether they realize it or not, that is what all\nhuman beings are ultimately aiming at in their actions. For someone\nlike Aquinas, therefore, the human will is \u201cfree\u201d only in\na certain restricted sense. We are not free to choose for or\nagainst our final end; that is built into us by nature. But we are\nfree to choose various means to that end. All our choices,\ntherefore, are made under the aspect of leading to that final goal. To\nbe sure, sometimes we make the wrong choices, but when that occurs it\nis because of ignorance, distraction, self-deception, etc. In an\nimportant sense, then, someone like Aquinas accepts a version of the\nso called Socratic Paradox: No one knowingly and deliberately does\n evil.[50]\n\nOckham\u2019s view is quite different. Although he is very suspicious\nof the notion of final causality (teleology) in general, he thinks it\nis quite appropriate for intelligent, voluntary agents such as human\nbeings. Thus the frequent charge that Ockham severs ethics from\nmetaphysics by denying teleology seems\n wrong.[51]\n Nevertheless, while Ockham grants that human beings have a natural\norientation, a tendency toward their own ultimate good, he does not\nthink this restricts their choices.\n\nFor Ockham, as for Aristotle and Aquinas, I can choose the means to\nachieve my ultimate good. But in addition, for Ockham unlike Aristotle\nand Aquinas, I can choose whether to will that ultimate good.\nThe natural orientation and tendency toward that good is built in; I\ncannot do anything about that. But I can choose whether or\nnot to to act to achieve that good. I might choose, for\nexample, to do nothing at all, and I might choose this knowing full\nwell what I am doing. But more: I can choose to act knowingly directly\nagainst my ultimate good, to thwart\n it.[52]\n I can choose evil as evil.\n\nFor Ockham, this is required if I am going to be morally responsible\nfor my actions. If I could not help but will to act to achieve my\nultimate good, then it would not be morally praiseworthy of me to do\nso; moral \u201csins of omission\u201d would be impossible (although\nof course I could be mistaken in the means I adopt). By the same\ntoken, moral \u201csins of commission\u201d would be impossible if I\ncould not knowingly act against my ultimate good. But for\nOckham these conclusions are not just required by theory; they are\nconfirmed by experience.\n",
