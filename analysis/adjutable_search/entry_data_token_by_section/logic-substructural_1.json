    "main_text": "Logics in the Family\n2. Logics in the Family\n\n\nThere are many different formal systems in the family of substructural\nlogics. These logics can be motivated in different ways. \n2.1 Relevant Logics\n\n\nMany people have wanted to give an account of logical validity which\npays some attention to conditions of relevance. If \\(X,A\n\\vdash B\\) holds, then \\(X\\) must somehow be relevant to\n\\(A\\).  Premise combination is restricted in the following way. We may\nhave \\(X \\vdash A\\) without also having \\(X,Y \\vdash A\\) . The new\nmaterial \\(Y\\) might not be relevant to the deduction. In the 1950s,\nMoh (1950), Church (1951) and Ackermann (1956) all gave accounts of\nwhat a \u2018relevant\u2019 logic could be. The ideas have been\ndeveloped by a stream of workers centred around Anderson and Belnap,\ntheir students Dunn and Meyer, and many others.  The canonical\nreferences for the area are Anderson, Belnap and Dunn\u2019s\ntwo-volume Entailment (1975 and 1992). Other introductions\ncan be found in Read\u2019s Relevant Logic, Dunn and\nRestall\u2019s Relevance Logic (2002), and\nMares\u2019 Relevant Logic: a philosophical\ninterpretation (2004). \n2.2 Resource Consciousness\n\n\nThis is not the only way to restrict premise combination. Girard (1987)\nintroduced linear logic as a model for processes and resource\nuse. The idea in this account of deduction is that resources must be\nused (so premise combination satisfies the relevance criterion) and\nthey do not extend indefinitely. Premises cannot be\n\\(re\\)-used. So, I might have \\(X,X \\vdash A\\), which says that I can use \\(X\\) twice\nto get \\(A\\). I might not have \\(X \\vdash A\\), which says that I can use \\(X\\) once\nalone to get \\(A\\). A helpful introduction to linear logic is\ngiven in Troelstra\u2019s Lectures on Linear Logic (1992).\nThere are other formal logics in which the contraction rule\n(from \\(X,X \\vdash A\\) to\n\\(X \\vdash A)\\) is absent.\nMost famous among these are \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s many-valued\nlogics. There has been a sustained interest in logics without this rule\nbecause of Curry\u2019s paradox (Curry 1977, Geach 1995; see also\nRestall 1994 in Other Internet Resources). \n3. Order\n\n\nIndependently of either of these traditions, Joachim Lambek considered\nmathematical models of language and syntax (Lambek 1958, 1961). The\nidea here is that premise combination corresponds to composition of\nstrings or other linguistic units. Here \\(X,X\\) differs\nin content from \\(X\\), but in addition, \\(X,Y\\)\ndiffers from Y,X. Not only does the number of\npremises used count but so does their order. Good\nintroductions to the Lambek calculus (also called categorial\ngrammar) can be found in books by Moortgat (1988) and Morrill\n(1994).\n",
