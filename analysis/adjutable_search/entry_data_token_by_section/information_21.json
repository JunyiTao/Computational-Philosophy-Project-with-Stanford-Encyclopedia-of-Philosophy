    "main_text": "Anomalies, Paradoxes, and Problems || The Paradox of Systematic Search\n6.1 The Paradox of Systematic Search\n\nThe essence of information is the fact that it reduces uncertainty.\nThis observation leads to problems in opaque contexts, for instance,\nwhen we search an object. This is illustrated by Meno\u2019s paradox\n(see entry on\n epistemic paradoxes):\n\n\nAnd how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not\nknow? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you\nfind what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing\nwhich you did not know? (Plato, Meno, 80d1-4) \n\n\nThe paradox is related to other open problems in computer science and\nphilosophy. Suppose that John is looking for a unicorn. It is very\nunlikely that unicorns exist, so, in terms of Shannon\u2019s theory,\nJohn gets a lot of information if he finds one. Yet from a descriptive\nKolmogorov point of view, John does not get new information, since he\nalready knows what unicorns are. The related paradox of systematic\nsearch might be formulated as follows:\n\n\nAny information that can be found by means of systematic search has no\nvalue, since we are certain to find it, given enough time.\nConsequently information only has value as long as we are uncertain\nabout its existence, but then, since we already know what we are\nlooking for, we get no new information when we find out that it\nexists. \n\nExample: Goldbach conjectured in 1742 that every even\nnumber bigger than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Until\ntoday this conjecture remains unproved. Consider the term \u201cThe\nfirst number that violates Goldbach\u2019s conjecture\u201d. It does\nnot give us all information about the number, since the number might\nnot exist. The prefix \u201cthe first\u201d ensures the description,\nif it exists, is unique, and it gives us an algorithm to find the\nnumber. It is a partial uniquely identifying description.\nThis algorithm is only effective if the number really exists,\notherwise it will run forever. If we find the number this will be\ngreat news, but from the perspective of descriptive complexity the\nnumber itself will be totally uninteresting, since we already know the\nrelevant properties to find it. Observe that, even if we have a number\nn that is a counter example to Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, it\nmight be difficult to verify this: we might have to check almost all\nprimes \\( \\leq n\\). This can be done effectively (we will\nalways get a result) but not, as far as we know, efficiently\n(it might take \u201cclose\u201d to n different computations)\n. \n\n\nA possible solution is to specify the constraint that it is\nillegal to measure the information content of an object in\nterms of partial descriptions, but this would destroy our theory of\ndescriptive complexity. Note that the complexity of an object is the\nlength of the shortest program that produces an object on a universal\nTuring machine. In this sense the phrase \u201cthe first number that\nviolates Goldbach\u2019s conjecture\u201d is a perfect description\nof a program, and it adequately measures the descriptive complexity of\nsuch a number. The short description reflects the fact that the\nnumber, if it exists, is very special, and thus it has a high\npossibility to occur in some mathematical context. \n\nThere are relations which well-studied philosophical problems like the\nAnselm\u2019s ontological argument for God\u2019s existence and the\nKantian counter claim that existence is not a predicate. In order to\navoid similar problems Russell proposed to interpret unique\ndescriptions existentially (Russell 1905): A sentence like \u201cThe\nking of France is bald\u201d would have the following logical\nstructure:  \n\\[\\exists (x) (KF(x) \\wedge \\forall (y)(KF(y) \\rightarrow x=y) \\wedge B(x))\\]\n\n\nThis interpretation does not help us to analyze decision problems that\ndeal with existence. Suppose the predicate L is true of\nx if I\u2019m looking for x, then the logical structure\nof the phrase \u201cI\u2019m looking for the king of France\u201d\nwould be:  \n\\[\\exists (x) (KF(x) \\wedge\n\\forall (y)(KF(y) \\rightarrow x=y) \\wedge L(x)),\\]\n\n\ni.e., if the king of France does not exist it cannot be true that I am\nlooking for him, which is unsatisfactory. Kripke (1971) criticized\nRussell\u2019s solution and proposed his so-called causal theory of\nreference in which a name get its reference by an initial act of\n\u201cbaptism\u201d. It then becomes a rigid designator\n(see entry on\n rigid designators)\n that can be followed back to that original act via causal chains. In\nthis way ad hoc descriptions like \u201cJohn was the fourth\nperson to step out of the elevator this morning\u201d can establish a\nsemantics for a name.\n\nIn the context of mathematics and information theory the corresponding\nconcept is that of names, constructive predicates and ad-hoc\npredicates of numbers. For any number there will be in principle an\ninfinite number of true statements about that number. Since elementary\narithmetic is incomplete there will be statements about numbers that\nare true but unprovable. In the limit a vanishing fragment of numbers\nwill have true predicates that actually compress their description.\nConsider the following statements:\n\n The symbol \u201c8\u201d is the name for the number eight.\n\n The number x is the 1000th Fibonacci number. \n The number x is the first number that violates the\nGoldbach conjecture. \n\n\nThe first statement simply specifies a name for a number. The second\nstatement gives a partial description that is constructive,\ninformation compressing and unique. The 1000th Fibonacci number has\n209 digits, so the description \u201cthe 1000th Fibonacci\nnumber\u201d is much more efficient than the actual name of the\nnumber. Moreover, we have an algorithm to construct the number. This\nmight not be that case for the description in the third statement. We\ndo not know whether the first number that violates the Goldbach\nconjecture exists, but if it does, the description might well be\nad hoc and thus gives us no clue to construct the number.\nThis rise to the conjecture that there are data compressing\neffective ad hoc descriptions:\n\nConjecture: There exist numbers that are compressed\nby non-constructive unique effective descriptions, i.e., the validity\nof the description can be checked effectively given the number, but\nthe number cannot be constructed effectively from the description,\nexcept by means of systematic search. \n\nThe conjecture is a more general variant of the so-called P vs. NP\nthesis (see\n section 6.3).\n If one replaces the term \u201ceffective\u201d with the term\n\u201cefficient\u201d one gets a formulation of the \\(\\textrm{P}\n\\neq \\textrm{NP}\\) thesis.\n",
