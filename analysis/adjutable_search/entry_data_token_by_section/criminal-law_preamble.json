    "main_text": "\n Any theory of criminal law must explain why criminal law is\ndistinctive\u2014why it is a body of law worthy of separate\nattention. This entry begins by identifying features of criminal law\nthat make this so (\u00a71). It then asks what functions that body of\nlaw fulfills (\u00a72), and what justifies its creation and continued\nexistence (\u00a73). If criminal law should be retained, we must\nconsider its proper limits (\u00a74). We must consider the conditions\nunder which agents should be criminally responsible for whatever falls\nwithin those limits (\u00a75). And we must ask which rules of\nprocedure and evidence should govern efforts to establish criminal\nresponsibility (\u00a76). The focus of this entry is Anglo-American\ncriminal law and scholarship thereon. Many of the questions raised,\nand many of the answers considered, are nonetheless of general\napplication.\n",
