    "main_text": "Moral Particularism and Justification || Rule of Thumb Particularism\n5.2 Rule of Thumb Particularism\n\nAccording to rule of thumb particularists, one need not give up the\nuse of all moral principles in moral deliberation, because there are\nsome false moral principles that are reasonable to employ. Margaret\nLittle, for instance, thinks that there are no true moral principles\n(not even principles that express pro tanto reasons or\nobligations), but that there are false, defeasible principles that can\nnevertheless provide presumptive epistemic warrant for moral beliefs.\nLittle holds that we can know with reasonable certainty\u2014on the\nbasis of experience and testimony\u2014what sorts of contexts\nwe\u2019re likely to encounter, as well as which features tend to\ncount as reasons (and for what) in those sorts of contexts. She\nwrites,\n\n\nThe judgement that a given principle such as \u201clying is\nwrong\u201d will help rather than mislead a moral novice reflects a\njudgment about the sorts of contexts she is likely to encounter, just\nas our agreement that it is better training to tell beginner drivers\n\u201cNever slam on the brakes\u201d instead of \u201cStomp on the\ngas whenever you see another car\u201d reflects a judgement that the\nstudent will most likely be facing our world of crowded highways and\nnot the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max movies. (Little 2000: 295)\n\n\n\nThis view\u2014that there are defeasible moral principles we can\nlegitimately use in deliberation\u2014may seem at odds with the\nparticularist claim that there are no pro tanto moral\nprinciples. However, Little sees no such tension. The existence of a\nprinciple that expresses a pro tanto reason or obligation\nentails that certain features have intrinsic moral natures that give\nthem a default \u201cmoral valence\u201d. To say, \u201cLying is\npro tanto wrong\u201d, is to assert that lying has a default\nnegative moral valence, that the feature of being a lie in and of\nitself makes an action worse, even if that feature\u2019s moral\ncontribution could be outweighed by other considerations. However,\naccording to Little, the existence of defeasible generalizations\ndoesn\u2019t entail any such thing; it simply turns out that lying\ntends to be wrong in the contexts most humans tend to encounter, even\nthough lying, in and of itself, has no intrinsic moral valence. Since\nthe latter is (close to) a mere defeasible statistical generalization,\nits use can allow one to justifiably come to moral beliefs even though\n(a) it\u2019s strictly false and (b) it strictly says nothing about\nthe intrinsic moral nature of a property.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Little thinks this is the only way we\ncome to hold justified moral beliefs\u2014perhaps we could achieve\nmoral knowledge or justification by engaging in a cognitive process\nlike that described by Dancy (a process by which one intuits, in a\ncontext, what the reasons in the context are and how one ought to\nweight them against each other). But Little does think that\nparticularism will be too demanding if it requires that one form all\nmoral beliefs in the way Abstinence prescribes.\n\nTo sum up, rule of thumb moral particularism makes room for a\nposteriori moral knowledge and a posteriori moral\njustification. Although it leaves open the possibility that some moral\nknowledge and justification is a priori (in the way Dancy\ndescribes), it denies that all moral knowledge/justification is a\npriori; rule of thumb particularists hold that one can\njustifiably infer at least some moral conclusions from experience,\ntestimony, and (experience-supported) beliefs about the kinds of\ncontexts one is likely to encounter.\n",
