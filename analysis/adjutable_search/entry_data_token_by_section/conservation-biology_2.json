    "main_text": "What is Biodiversity? || Operationalizing Biodiversity\n1.2 Operationalizing Biodiversity\n\nSahotra Sarkar attempts to define biodiversity\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d as opposed to \u201cexplicitly\u201d\ncontrary to Maclaurin and Sterelny (Margules & Sarkar 2007; Sarkar\n2002, 2005; Sarkar & Margules 2002). A concept is given an\nexplicit definition if, and only if, there is a set of necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the satisfaction of the concept. For\nexample, suppose we define the concept species\nphylogenetically in the following way: necessarily, something is a\nspecies if, and only if, it is a lineage between two speciation events\nor a speciation event and an extinction event (Ridley 1989). An\nimplicit definition is different; the concept is defined by some rules\nor axioms in which the concept appears. So, Sarkar characterizes biodiversity\nas follows,\n\n\n[B]iodiversity should be (implicitly) operationally defined as what is\nbeing optimized by the place prioritization procedures that prioritize\nall places on the basis of their biodiversity content using true\nsurrogates. (Sarkar 2005: 182)\n\n\nTo understand this account, we need to articulate what a place\nprioritization procedure is (Sarkar et al. 2002; Sarkar 2005:\n159\u201368). In the abstract, place prioritization starts with a\nlist of places (\u201ccells\u201d) and a list of surrogates that\nmust be represented at a certain target in a conservation area\nnetwork. We either want to select the smallest set of cells such that\nevery one of our surrogates meets it target, or select those cells\nsubject to a given size, which maximizes the number of surrogates at\nor above the relevant target. Place prioritization is a component of a\nconsensus framework called systematic conservation planning that we\nwill discuss below. However, in effect, it is a procedure for\nprioritizing places for their \u201cbiodiversity content\u201d for\ncreating conservation area networks in which we incorporate\ninformation regarding the design of the area. This can include the\nshape of the network, its size, dispersion, and connectivity. This is\ntypically put more formally as follows (Sarkar 2005: 161). First,\nsuppose we begin with a set \\(\\Sigma\\) of places or cells\n\\(\\sigma_{j}\\); thus, \\(\\Sigma = \\{\\sigma_{j} \\mid \\sigma_{j} \\in\n\\Sigma\\}\\) for \\(j = 1, 2,\\ldots, n\\). Second, we have a set \\(\\Lambda\\)\nof surrogates \\(\\lambda_{i}\\); thus, \\(\\Lambda = \\{\\lambda_{i} \\mid\n\\lambda_{i} \\in \\Lambda\\}\\) for \\(i = 1, 2,\\ldots,m\\). Third, we have\ntargets for the representation of their expected coverage \\(\\tau_{i}\\)\nfor \\(i= 1, 2,\\ldots., m\\). Place prioritization then takes the form\nof two problems:\n\n\n\nMinimum Area: selection the smallest set of cell \\(\\Gamma\\) such that\nevery surrogate meets their target of representation;\n\n\nMaximum Representation: given the cardinality \\(\\kappa \\leq n\\) of\n\\(\\Gamma\\), select those cells that maximize the number of surrogates\nfor which the expected coverage exceeds the targets of\nrepresentation.\n\n\nThe former problem has economic constraints but none on the number of\nplaces whereas the second has a constraint on the total number of\nplaces.\n\nAs we saw above, true surrogates consist in species, characters or\ntraits, life-zones, or environmental parameters. Estimator surrogates\nconsist in environmental parameter composition, soil-type composition,\ndominant vegetation composition, subsets of species composition, and\nsubsets of genus or other higher taxon composition. So, biodiversity\nis preserved by preserving true surrogates through preserving\nestimator surrogates (Sarkar 2005: 168\u201373). To a first\napproximation, a place prioritization procedure optimizes the number\nof estimators and thus true surrogates with respect to place, and what\nis so optimized is biodiversity. Biodiversity just is what is\noptimized by this procedure.\n\nThere are several concerns worth mentioning with regard to how this\nprocedure implicitly defines biodiversity.\nFirst, since we are operationalizing the concept biodiversity,\nit is simply defined by what a place\nprioritization procedure optimizes. Thus, it cannot be in error with\nregard to whether it has captured some pre-theoretic notion. It rules\nout the possibility of mistake (Hempel 1966: Ch. 7). We do not think\nthat the concept of temperature is just\nwhatever is measured by thermometers (Chang 2004). Second, insofar as\nthere are different place prioritization procedures, they will\nimplicitly define distinct concepts. They will not be measuring the\nsame magnitude. Third, concept explication requires that the\nexplicatum be distinct but sufficiently similar to the\nexplicandum for the analysis to be of theoretical value\n(Carnap 1950/1962: Ch.1). There are two ways of seeing how the\nconcept(s) articulated by Sarkar differ from our \u201cordinary\u201d\nones. The concept most conservation biologists articulate is\ncategorical and not relational. The concept is similarly imbued with\nmuch moralizing as we shall see and one can be competent with the one\nand not the other. Hence, one might argue that they are different\nconcepts (Odenbaugh 2009). As David Takacs writes,\n\n\nBiodiversity is the rallying cry currently used by biologists to draw\nattention to this crisis and to encapsulate the Earth\u2019s myriad\nspecies and biological processes, as well as a host of values ascribed\nto the natural world. (Takacs 1996: 9)\n\n\nAt first blush, one might wonder if this is the same thing articulated\nby place prioritization procedures.\n",
