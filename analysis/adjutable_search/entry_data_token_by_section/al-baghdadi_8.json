    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Intellect and First Cause\n4.3 Intellect and First Cause\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif then proceeds in his treatise by epitomizing the\nBook of the Exposition of the Pure Good, that is to say, the\nLiber de causis of the Latin Middle Ages, proposition 54, on\nthe difference between eternity and time (Endress 1973; Jolivet 1979:\n55\u201375; Zimmermann 1994: 9\u201351) from Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology, Metaphysics Lambda, and the\npseudo-Theology (Martini Bonadeo 2017b, Ajoun 2017).\n\u2018Abd al-Latif reproduces all the propositions of the Liber\nde causis, except numbers 4, 10, 18, and 20, and follows the same\norder in which they are set out (Badawi 1955b; Anawati 1956:\n73\u2013110; Taylor 1984: 236\u2013248). Abd al-Latif\u2019s aim is to\nestablish, on a Farabian model, an identification between the First\nCause, One and Pure Good, as presented in the Liber de causis\nand the Aristotelian First Principle, Unmoved Mover and Intellect in\nactuality, described in his paraphrase of Metaphysics\nLambda.\n\nAbd al-Latif stresses the primacy of the most universal cause, which\nis, therefore, further from its effect with respect to the causes\nnearer to the effect and hence apparently more important. The First\nCause transcends any possibility of our knowledge. If knowing the true\nnature of things in fact means knowing their causes, since by\ndefinition the First Cause has no causes that precede it, it is\nunknowable in its true nature. It can only be known by approximation,\nthrough a description of the secondary causes. A long section, which\ndescribes intellect, follows this theory of the transcendent\nineffability of the First Cause which precludes any proper\npredication. The intellect is with eternity, above time, and is not\nsubject to division, because everything which is divisible is\ndivisible in magnitude, in number, or in motion, but all these kinds\nof division are under time. It is one, in so far as it is the first\nthing which originated from the First Cause, but it is multiple with\nrespect to the multiplicity of the gifts that come to it from the\nFirst Cause. The intellect knows what is above it\u2014the gifts that\ncome to it from the First Cause\u2014and what is below it\u2014the\nthings of which it is the cause. But intellect knows its cause and its\neffect through its substance, that is to say that it perceives things\nintellectually. It grasps intellectually either the intellectual\nthings or the sensible ones. The First Cause, which is the Pure Good,\npours all that is good into the intellect and into all that which\nexists through the mediation of the intellect. There is, however, a\ncertain fluctuation in \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s attempt to\nestablish a perfect conformity between the First Cause as presented in\nthe Liber de causis and the First Principle presented in his\nchapters devoted to the paraphrase of Metaphysics Lambda.\nAccording to \u2018Abd al-Latif God precedes the intellect in ruling\nthings: he orders the intellect to govern. But, having stated that the\nself-subsistent substance is not generated from something else,\n\u2018Abd al-Latif maintains that intellect does not need anything\nother than itself in its conceptualizing and formation\n(tasawwuri-hi wa taswiri-hi), that it is perfect and complete\neternally, and that it is the cause of itself.\n",
