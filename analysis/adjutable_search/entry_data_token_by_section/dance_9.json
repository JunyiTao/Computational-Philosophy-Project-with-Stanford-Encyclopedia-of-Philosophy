    "main_text": "Dance, Lived Experience and Somatic Awareness || Expertise\n3.3 Expertise\n\nMontero\u2019s view (2012) is that trained dancers have enhanced and\nmore nuanced kinaesthetic responses than do persons with no dance\ntraining, something that she believes can contribute to a richer\nappreciative evaluation of dance (see Bresnahan 2017b for a fuller\ndiscussion of this view). Conroy agrees that Montero\u2019s evidence\nshows that trained dancers might be able \u201cto identify subtle\ndiscrepancies between multiple performances of canonical movement\ntypes\u201d but denies that this necessarily translates into better\nappreciation of dance qua dance as art, where what matters is\nappreciation of aesthetic properties which may or may not\ndepend on the kind of perception Montero\u2019s evidence identifies\nin every case (2013: 205). McFee, as mentioned in\n Section 3.2,\n disagrees that dance training is ever relevant to the understanding\nof dance as art, which he seems to equate with critical appreciation.\nVan Camp (2019) lends support for this view.\n\n\nBresnahan has sided with Montero on this point (2017b). This is due to\nBresnahan\u2019s pragmatic perspective that the art-determining features of\n\u201cart\u201d lie in the experience of art, both as an appreciator\nand as a dancer and practitioner. Further, Bresnahan believes that\nthere are some aspects of the experience of dance that are not\navailable to the non-dance-trained appreciator or not available to the\nsame extent. Bresnahan agrees that this is an empirical question but\nshe sides with Montero, Carroll and Seeley in holding that answers to\nempirical questions can aid philosophic understanding. (For more\ndiscussion on the appropriateness of empirical support for philosophic\ninquiry in dance see\n Sections 3.2\n and\n 4\n of this entry. See He and Ravn 2018; Melrose 2017; Montero 2010,\n2012, and 2013; Vass-Rhee 2018; and Washburn et al. 2014 for more on\ndance and expertise.)\n",
