    "main_text": "Definitions || Definitions and Essences\n7.1 Definitions and Essences\n\nFor Aristotle, a definition is \u201can account which signifies what\nit is to be for something\u201d (logos ho to ti \u00ean einai\ns\u00eamainei). The phrase \u201cwhat it is to be\u201d and\nits variants are crucial: giving a definition is saying, of some\nexistent thing, what it is, not simply specifying the meaning of a\nword (Aristotle does recognize definitions of the latter sort, but he\nhas little interest in them).\n\nThe notion of \u201cwhat it is to be\u201d for a thing is so\npervasive in Aristotle that it becomes formulaic: what a definition\nexpresses is \u201cthe what-it-is-to-be\u201d (to ti \u00ean\neinai), or in modern terminology, its essence.\n",
