For both these reasons, one cannot make sound judgments\nabout what one should be doing \u2013 that is, about what is the\n\u201cmean\u201d of reasonableness \u2013 unless one\u2019s wishes\nare those of a person who understands the opportunities and the\ncircumstances well, and whose concerns and intentions are those of\nsomeone whose reasonableness is not corrupted or deflected either by\nsub-rational desires and aversions or by deformations of will such as\npride or presumption. Such a person has the virtues, intellectual and\nmoral, and virtue is thus, and in these respects, required for sound\nmoral judgment. Sometimes the mean of reason, properly assessed by\nsomeone of true virtue, calls for heroic virtue (say, immense courage)\nfar beyond conventional measures or expectations of reasonableness,\nmoderation, and the like.\n4.2.1 The interdependence of the virtues\n\nAquinas firmly holds the Platonic-Aristotelian theses (i) of the\nconnexio virtutum: that to have any of the virtues in its\nfull and proper form one must have all of them, and (ii) of the\ngoverning and shaping role of (the good of) practical reasonableness\n(bonum rationis), that is, of the intellectual and moral\nvirtue of prudentia. For some indication why, see 4.4\nbelow..\n",
