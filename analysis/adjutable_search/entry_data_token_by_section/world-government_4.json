Craig\nMurphy has worried that globalization would\n\n\ninevitably be accompanied by the anti-democratic government of\n\u201cexpertise\u201d or by the non-government of marketization at\never more inclusive levels. (2000: 800)\n\n\nEconomists have warned that the relationship between global economic\nintegration, national self-determination, and democratic politics can\nbe fraught (Rodrik 2011), and that capitalism has a tendency to\nreproduce and intensify inequality (Piketty 2013 [2014]). In the\ntwentieth century, Immanuel Wallerstein (2011) developed the\nworld-systems approach to analyzing the contradictions inherent in a\ncapitalist world-system. Although imperial military competition gave\nway to a world of sovereign states in the era of decolonization, he\nnoted that a capitalist world order perpetuates systems of domination\nto maintain capitalist interests, at the expense of the developing\nworld. World-systems theory thus explains how capitalism forms a\nstable set of exploitative relations between core and peripheral\nstates, resulting in an international division of labor that benefits\nthe core at the expense of the periphery.\n\nWhile world-systems theory posits that \u201ceconomic exploitation of\nthe periphery does not necessarily require direct political or\nmilitary domination\u201d (Kohn & Reddy 2006 [2017]),\ncontemporary postcolonial theorists argue that the rise of neoliberal\nglobalization can be marked by the establishment of international\neconomic institutions that have dislocated the power of sovereign\nstates to make economic decisions, and relocated them in international\neconomic institutions\u2014the WTO, IMF and World Bank\u2014with\neffective enforcement powers.\n\nWhereas realist, liberal and republican theorists typically posit that\na world state is a possible futuristic institutional development to\nevolve from anarchy, postcolonial theorists have argued that anarchy\ndoes not accurately describe the global historical institutional\nreality. Some also argue that world government is already here, albeit\nin a nascent form (Albert et al. 2012; Goodin 2013). Critical and\npostcolonial theorists argue that the course of capitalist modernity\nhas produced a nascent world state of neoliberal domination (Chimni\n2004; Slobodian 2018). In such conditions of structural domination, a\nworld state may be undesirable as a political project due to\nestablished and entrenched global hierarchies based on racist,\npatriarchal, and capitalist domination and exploitation (Robinson\n1983; Pateman and Mills 2007). As B.S. Chimni has put it,\n\n\nA network of economic, social and political [International\nInstitutions] has been established or repositioned, at the initiative\nof the first world, and together they constitute a nascent global\nstate whose function is to realize the interests of transnational\ncapital and powerful states in the international system to the\ndisadvantage of third world states and peoples. The evolving global\nstate formation may therefore be described as having an\nimperial character. (2004: 1\u20132)\n\n\nAlthough fragmented in structure, the future global state, according\nto Chimni, is in the process of congealing to actualize and legitimize\na world-view that ultimately serves the transnational capitalist class\ncomprising the owners of transnational capital. This class allies with\nthe networks of international law and institutions to undermine the\ndecision-making powers of states, especially those with weak\ninstitutional capacities, and to make decisions without transparency\nor effective participation of those affected.\n\nWhile increasingly intrusive, the decisions of international economic\nand financial institutions remain largely unaccountable. According to\nSlobodian, neoliberal globalists actively sought to construct the\ninstitutions of the global economy to evade accountability, \u201cto\ncontain potential disruptions from the democratically empowered\nmasses\u201d, so that the global economy could be \u201cprotected\nfrom the demands of redistributive equality and social justice\u201d\n(2018: 264). While the Washington Consensus seemed to be based on\nsound economic principles\u2014that free markets \u201cand\ncompetition enable the efficient allocation of scarce\nresources\u201d\u2014and forecast economic growth based on\nliberalizing trade, investment, and capital flows, its failure to\nproduce growth or inclusive development in many countries has revealed\nthe importance of empirical analysis to check ideological distortions\nof economic policy (Rodrik 2015). China\u2019s economic\ntransformation illuminates global challenges arising from the decline\nof \u201cmanagerial capitalism\u201d, or Fordism, which generated\nthe regulatory state-model of governance, and the rise of\n\u201cneoliberal capitalism\u201d, or post-Fordism, defined by the\n\u201chollowing out\u201d of the state, reduction of central\nregulatory capacity, coupled with flexible production processes\ndisaggregated into production chains and networks, and increasing\nvulnerability of the peripheral workforce (Dowdle 2016:\n207\u2013229).\n\nIn response to these predicaments of contemporary capitalism, critical\nand postcolonial theorists emphasize that there is no option to return\nto a mythical world of autarkic or autonomous and insulated states\nwith traditional sovereign prerogatives (Winter & Chambers-Letson\n2015). Instead, globalized domination can only be transformed through\nglobalizing transnational labor and social movements that struggle for\ngreater democratization of the decision-making processes of both\ndomestic and international institutions (Chimni 2004). In calling for\na revision of the principles that regulate the relationship between\nthe global economy and sovereign states, in order to buttress state\npower, especially of Third World states, against international\neconomic and financial institutions, critical theorists join\ncontemporary liberal (Isiksel 2020) and republican theorists who view\nthe state as continuing to play an important role in securing equal\nhuman freedom. According to Adom Getachew, \u201cpostcolonial\ncosmopolitanism\u201d acknowledges the persistent unequal integration\nand hierarchy produced by the world politics of empire, and views the\nreinforcement of the sovereign state, as well as the dispersion of\nsovereignty in regional federations and a redistributive international\neconomic order, as key to anti-colonial struggles to resist domination\nand remake the world (2019: 34).\n\nGiven that the Eurocentric narrative of civilizational progress\nforwarded the nation-state as a marker of civilization, and fated\nIndigenous peoples to extinction with the advent of modernity,\nhowever, Indigenous political theorists have reason to be ambivalent\nabout a Weberian state at any level of political organization. Some\nIndigenous political theorists have mounted radical challenges to the\nsettler colonial state as well as the statist international order.\nGlen Coulthard\u2019s critique of the liberal politics of\nmulticultural recognition reveals that the struggle for recognition\nmay not emancipate, but entrench subjects in the settler colonial\nsubjectivity offered by the settler colonial state (2014). Following\nanti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon, Coulthard argues that dominated\nagents need to struggle to create new decolonized frameworks of\nrecognition that they can call their own, and not only seek equal\nrecognition based on structures of settler colonial power,\notherwise\n\n\nthe colonized will have failed to reestablish themselves as truly\nself-determining: as creators of the terms, values, and conditions by\nwhich they are to be recognized. (2014: 139)\n\n\nCoulthard also understands the political project of Indigenous\n\u201cresurgence\u201d to be inextricably linked to the struggle to\nconstruct alternative social and economic systems to capitalism; thus\nfor Indigenous resurgence to be successful, \u201ccapitalism must\ndie\u201d (2014: 173). Such Indigenous politics of refusal (Simpson\n2014) of both statism and capitalism underscore that the struggle for\nrecognition of Indigenous humanity in conditions of racial capitalist\nmodernity entails radical structural transformations of global order\n(Lu 2017 and 2019).\n",
