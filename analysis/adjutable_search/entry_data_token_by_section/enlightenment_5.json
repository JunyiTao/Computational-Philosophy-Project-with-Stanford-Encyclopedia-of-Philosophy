    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment || Emerging Sciences and the Encyclopedia\n1.5 Emerging Sciences and the Encyclopedia\n\nThe commitment to careful observation and description of phenomena as\nthe starting point of science, and then the success at explaining and\naccounting for observed phenomena through the method of induction,\nnaturally leads to the development of new sciences for new domains in\nthe Enlightenment. Many of the human and social sciences have their\norigins in the eighteenth century (e.g., history, anthropology,\naesthetics, psychology, economics, even sociology), though most are\nonly formally established as autonomous disciplines later. The\nemergence of new sciences is aided by the development of new\nscientific tools, such as models for probabilistic reasoning, a kind\nof reasoning that gains new respect and application in the period.\nDespite the multiplication of sciences in the period, the ideal\nremains to comprehend the diversity of our scientific knowledge as a\nunified system of science; however, this ideal of unity is generally\ntaken as regulative, as an ideal to emerge in the ever-receding\nend-state of science, rather than as enforced from the beginning by\nregimenting science under a priori principles.\n\nAs exemplifying these and other tendencies of the Enlightenment, one\nwork deserves special mention: the Encyclopedia, edited by\nDenis Diderot and Jean La Rond d\u2019Alembert. The\nEncyclopedia (subtitled: \u201csystematic dictionary of\nthe sciences, arts and crafts\u201d) was published in 28 volumes\n(17 of text, 11 of plates) over 21 years (1751\u20131772), and\nconsists of over 70,000 articles, contributed by over 140\ncontributors, among them many of the luminaries of the French\nEnlightenment. The work aims to provide a compendium of existing human\nknowledge to be transmitted to subsequent generations, a transmission\nintended to contribute to the progress and dissemination of human\nknowledge and to a positive transformation of human society. The\norientation of the Encyclopedia is decidedly secular and\nimplicitly anti-authoritarian. Accordingly, the French state of the\nancien r\u00e9gime censors the project, and it is completed\nonly through the persistence of Diderot. The collaborative nature of\nthe project, especially in the context of state opposition,\ncontributes significantly to the formation of a shared sense of\npurpose among the wide variety of intellectuals who belong to the\nFrench Enlightenment. The knowledge contained in the\nEncyclopedia is self-consciously social both in its\nproduction \u2013 insofar as it is immediately the product of what\nthe title page calls \u201ca society of men of letters\u201d \u2013\nand in its address \u2013 insofar as it is primarily meant as an\ninstrument for the education and improvement of society. It is a\nstriking feature of the Encyclopedia, and one by virtue of\nwhich it exemplifies the Baconian conception of science characteristic\nof the period, that its entries cover the whole range and scope of\nknowledge, from the most abstract theoretical to the most practical,\nmechanical and technical. \n",
