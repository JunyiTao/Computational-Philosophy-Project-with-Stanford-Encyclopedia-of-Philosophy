    "main_text": "Naturalizing the Mind\n8. Individuation of Mentalese Expressions\n\nHow are Mentalese expressions individuated? Since Mentalese\nexpressions are types, answering this question requires us to consider\nthe type/token relation for Mentalese. We want to fill in the\nschema\n\n\ne and e* are tokens of the same Mentalese type iff\nR(e, e*).\n\n\nWhat should we substitute for R(e, e*)? The\nliterature typically focuses on primitive symbol types, and\nwe will follow suit here.\n\nIt is almost universally agreed among contemporary LOT theorists that\nMentalese tokens are neurophysiological entities of some sort. One\nmight therefore hope to individuate Mentalese types by citing neural\nproperties of the tokens. Drawing R(e, e*) from\nthe language of neuroscience induces a theory along the following\nlines:\n\n\nNeural individuation: e and e*\nare tokens of the same primitive Mentalese type iff e and\ne* are tokens of the same neural type.\n\n\nThis schema leaves open how neural types are individuated. We may\nbypass that question here, because neural individuation of Mentalese\ntypes finds no proponents in the contemporary literature. The main\nreason is that it conflicts with\n multiple realizability:\n the doctrine that a single mental state type can be realized by\nphysical systems that are wildly heterogeneous when described in\nphysical, biological, or neuroscientific terms. Putnam (1967)\nintroduced multiple realizability as evidence against the\n mind/brain identity theory,\n which asserts that mental state types are brain state types. Fodor\n(1975: 13\u201325) further developed the multiple realizability\nargument, presenting it as foundational to LOTH. Although the multiple\nrealizability argument has subsequently been challenged (Polger 2004),\nLOT theorists widely agree that we should not individuate Mentalese\ntypes in neural terms.\n\nThe most popular strategy is to individuate Mentalese types\nfunctionally:\n\n\nFunctional individuation: e and\ne* are tokens of the same primitive Mentalese type iff e\nand e* have the same functional role.\n\n\nField (2001: 56\u201367), Fodor (1994: 105\u2013109), and Stich\n(1983: 149\u2013151) pursue functional individuation. They specify\nfunctional roles using a Turing-style computationalism formalism, so\nthat \u201cfunctional role\u201d becomes something like\n\u201ccomputational role\u201d, i.e., role within mental\ncomputation.\n\nFunctional roles theories divide into two categories:\nmolecular and holist. Molecular theories isolate\nprivileged canonical relations that a symbol bears to other symbols.\nCanonical relations individuate the symbol, but non-canonical\nrelations do not. For example, one might individuate Mentalese\nconjunction solely through the introduction and elimination rules\ngoverning conjunction while ignoring any other computational rules. If\nwe say that a symbol\u2019s \u201ccanonical functional role\u201d\nis constituted by its canonical relations to other symbols, then we\ncan offer the following theory:\n\n\nMolecular functional individuation: e\nand e* are tokens of the same primitive Mentalese type iff\ne and e* have the same canonical functional role.\n\n\nOne problem facing molecular individuation is that, aside from logical\nconnectives and a few other special cases, it is difficult to draw any\nprincipled demarcation between canonical and non-canonical relations\n(Schneider 2011: 106). Which relations are canonical for\n SOFA?[9]\n Citing the demarcation problem, Schneider espouses a holist approach\nthat individuates mental symbols through total functional\nrole, i.e., every single aspect of the role that a symbol plays\nwithin mental activity:\n\n\nHolist functional individuation: e\nand e* are tokens of the same primitive Mentalese type iff\ne and e* have the same total functional role.\n\n\nHolist individuation is very fine-grained: the slightest difference in\ntotal functional role entails that different types are tokened. Since\ndifferent thinkers will always differ somewhat in their mental\ncomputations, it now looks like two thinkers will never share the same\nmental language. This consequence is worrisome, for two reasons\nemphasized by Aydede (1998). First, it violates the plausible\npublicity constraint that propositional attitudes are in\nprinciple shareable. Second, it apparently precludes interpersonal\npsychological explanations that cite Mentalese expressions. Schneider\n(2011: 111\u2013158) addresses both concerns, arguing that they are\nmisdirected.\n\nA crucial consideration when individuating mental symbols is what role\nto assign to semantic properties. Here we may usefully compare\nMentalese with natural language. It is widely agreed that natural\nlanguage words do not have their denotations essentially. The English\nword \u201ccat\u201d denotes cats, but it could just as well have\ndenoted dogs, or the number 27, or anything else, or nothing at all,\nif our linguistic conventions had been different. Virtually all\ncontemporary LOT theorists hold that a Mentalese word likewise does\nnot have its denotation essentially. The Mentalese word cat\ndenotes cats, but it could have had a different\ndenotation had it born different causal relations to the external\nworld or had it occupied a different role in mental activity. In that\nsense, cat is a piece of formal syntax.\nFodor\u2019s early view (1981: 225\u2013253) was that a Mentalese\nword could have had a different denotation but not an\narbitrarily different denotation: cat\ncould not have denoted just anything\u2014it could not have denoted\nthe number 27\u2014but it could have denoted some other animal\nspecies had the thinker suitably interacted with that species rather\nthan with cats. Fodor eventually (1994, 2008) embraces the stronger\nthesis that a Mentalese word bears an arbitrary relation to\nits denotation: cat could have had any\narbitrarily different denotation. Most contemporary theorists agree\n(Egan 1992: 446; Field 2001: 58; Harnad 1994: 386; Haugeland 1985: 91:\n117\u2013123; Pylyshyn 1984: 50).\n\nThe historical literature on LOTH suggests an alternative\nsemantically permeated view: Mentalese words are individuated\npartly through their denotations. The Mentalese word cat\nis not a piece of formal syntax subject to\nreinterpretation. It could not have denoted another species, or the\nnumber 27, or anything else. It denotes cats by its inherent\nnature. From a semantically permeated viewpoint, a Mentalese word\nhas its denotation essentially. Thus, there is a profound difference\nbetween natural language and mental language. Mental words, unlike\nnatural language words, bring with them one fixed semantic\ninterpretation. The semantically permeated approach is present in\nOckham, among other medieval LOT theorists (Normore 2003, 2009). In\nlight of the problems facing neural and functional individuation,\nAydede (2005) recommends that we consider taking semantics into\naccount when individuating Mentalese expressions. Rescorla (2012b)\nconcurs, defending a semantically permeated approach as applied to at\nleast some mental representations. He proposes that certain mental\ncomputations operate over mental symbols with essential semantic\nproperties, and he argues that the proposal fits well with many\nsectors of cognitive\n science.[10]\n\nA recurring complaint about the semantically permeated approach is\nthat inherently meaningful mental representations seem like highly\nsuspect entities (Putnam 1988: 21). How could a mental word have one\nfixed denotation by its inherent nature? What magic ensures\nthe necessary connection between the word and the denotation? These\nworries diminish in force if one keeps firmly in mind that Mentalese\nwords are types. Types are abstract entities corresponding to a scheme\nfor classifying, or type-identifying, tokens. To ascribe a\ntype to a token is to type-identify the token as belonging to some\ncategory. Semantically permeated types correspond to a classificatory\nscheme that takes semantics into account when categorizing tokens. As\nBurge emphasizes (2007: 302), there is nothing magical about\nsemantically-based classification. On the contrary, both folk\npsychology and cognitive science routinely classify mental events\nbased at least partly upon their semantic properties.\n\nA simplistic implementation of the semantically permeated approach\nindividuates symbol tokens solely through their\ndenotations:\n\n\nDenotational individuation: e and\ne* are tokens of the same primitive Mentalese type iff e\nand e* have the same denotation.\n\n\nAs Aydede (2000) and Schneider (2011) emphasize, denotational\nindividuation is unsatisfying. Co-referring words may play\nsignificantly different roles in mental activity. Frege\u2019s (1892\n[1997]) famous Hesperus-Phosphorus example illustrates: one can\nbelieve that Hesperus is Hesperus without believing that Hesperus is\nPhosphorus. As Frege put it, one can think about the same denotation\n\u201cin different ways\u201d, or \u201cunder different modes of\npresentation\u201d. Different modes of presentation have different\nroles within mental activity, implicating different psychological\nexplanations. Thus, a semantically permeated individuative scheme\nadequate for psychological explanation must be finer-grained than\ndenotational individuation allows. It must take mode of presentation\ninto account. But what it is to think about a denotation \u201cunder\nthe same mode of presentation\u201d? How are \u201cmodes of\npresentation\u201d individuated? Ultimately, semantically permeated\ntheorists must grapple with these questions. Rescorla (2020)\noffers some suggestions about how to\n proceed.[11]\n\nChalmers (2012) complains that semantically permeated individuation\nsacrifices significant virtues that made LOTH attractive in the first\nplace. LOTH promised to advance naturalism by grounding cognitive\nscience in non-representational computational models.\nRepresentationally-specified computational models seem like a\nsignificant retrenchment from these naturalistic ambitions. For\nexample, semantically permeated theorists cannot accept the FSC\nexplanation of semantic coherence, because they do not postulate\nformal syntactic types manipulated during mental computation.\n\nHow compelling one finds naturalistic worries about semantically\npermeated individuation will depend on how impressive one finds the\nnaturalistic contributions made by formal mental syntax. We saw\nearlier that FSC arguably engenders a worrisome epiphenomenalism.\nMoreover, the semantically permeated approach in no way precludes a\nnaturalistic reduction of intentionality. It merely precludes invoking\nformal syntactic Mentalese types while executing such a reduction. For\nexample, proponents of the semantically permeated approach can still\npursue the causal or nomic naturalizing strategies discussed in\n section 7.\n Nothing about either strategy presupposes formal syntactic Mentalese\ntypes. Thus, it is not clear that replacing a formal syntactic\nindividuative scheme with a semantically permeated scheme\nsignificantly impedes the naturalistic endeavor.\n\nNo one has yet provided an individuative scheme for Mentalese that\ncommands widespread assent. The topic demands continued investigation,\nbecause LOTH remains highly schematic until its proponents clarify\nsameness and difference of Mentalese types.\n",
