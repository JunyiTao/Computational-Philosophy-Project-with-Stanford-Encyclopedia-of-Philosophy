    "main_text": "Why-questions || A formal approach: abnormic laws\n3.1 A formal approach: abnormic laws\n\nIf we follow Hempel in regarding an explanation as an answer to a\nwhy-question, Bromberger\u2019s theory of why-questions can be seen\nalso as a theory of explanation, indeed, one that incorporates\nHempel\u2019s deductive-nomological model while aiming to improve on\nit.\n\nBromberger introduces several concepts for use in his account: the\npresupposition of a why-question, abnormic laws and\ntheir antonymic predicates, and general rules,\nfocusing especially on general rules that are completed by\nabnormic laws.\n\nBromberger supposes that (15) is the general form of a\nwhy-question:\n\n(15)Why is it the case\nthat \\(p\\)?\n\n\nThe presupposition of (15) is \\(p\\), and this agrees with the usual\nconcept of presupposition for questions, since if \\(p\\) is not the\ncase then (15) has no correct answer. A general rule is a\n(true or false) law-like statement of the form:\n\n  \\(\\forall x(Fx\n\\rightarrow G\\)x), \n\n\nwhere \\(Fx\\) and \\(Gx\\) may, in the general case, be conjunctions. A\nspecial abnormic law is a true, law-like statement of the\nform:\n\n  \\(\\forall x(Fx\n\\rightarrow(Ex \\leftrightarrow(A_1 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee\nA_n\\)x))). \n\n\nSpecial abnormic laws satisfy five additional conditions of\nnon-triviality and non-redundancy that we need not get into, and\nBromberger (1966, 98) introduces the more complicated notion of a\ngeneral abnormic law, which we may also ignore for present purposes.\nThe predicate \\(E\\) appearing in a special abnormic law and\n\\(E\\)\u2019s negation are the antonymic predicates of the\nabnormic law. Bromberger (1966, 98) illustrates the concept of an\nabnormic law with the following example:\n\nNo sample of gas expands unless its temperature is kept constant but\nits pressure decreases, or its pressure is kept constant but its\ntemperature increases, or its absolute temperature increases by a\nlarger factor than its pressure, or its pressure decreases by a larger\nfactor than its absolute temperature.\n\n\nThe antonymic predicates of this special abnormic law are\n\u2018expands\u2019 and \u2018does not expand\u2019, and the\nlogical form that Bromberger\u2019s theory postulates for this\nabnormic law is as\n follows:[4]\n\n(16)  \\(\\forall x(Gx\n\\rightarrow(Ex \\leftrightarrow (Tx \\vee Px \\vee Ax \\vee Dx)))\\)\n\n\n\nBromberger (1966, 99) defines the completion of a general rule by an\nabnormic law as follows:\n\nAn abnormic law is the completion of a general rule if and only if the\ngeneral rule is false and is obtainable by dropping the\n\u201cunless\u201d qualifications. ([\u2026] this requires\nnegating the predicate substituted for \\(E\\)\u2014or dropping the\nnegation if it is already negated\u2014deleting the biconditional\nconnective, and making the obvious bracketing adjustments.)\n\n\nAbnormic law (16) is the completion of the (false) general rule\n\u2018No gas expands\u2019:\n\n(17)  \\(\\forall x(Gx\n\\rightarrow \\neg Ex)\\) \n\n\nBromberger (1966, 100) goes on to define the correct answer to a why\nquestion as follows: \\(q\\) is the correct answer to (15) if and only\nif (i) there is an abnormic law \\(L\\) (which may be general or\nspecial) and \\(p\\) is the proposition that results from predicating of\nsome individual one of the antonymic predicates of \\(L\\); and (ii)\n\\(q\\) together with \\(L\\) and other premises \\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\)\nconstitute a deductive-nomological explanation with conclusion \\(p\\);\nand (iii) there is a false proposition \\(s\\) such that \\(s\\) and \\(p\\)\nare contraries and, were it not for the falsity of \\(s\\) and \\(L\\),\npremises \\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) and the general rule completed by \\(L\\)\nwould count as a deductive-nomological explanation of \\(s\\); and (iv)\nthe general rule completed by \\(L\\) is such that if one of the\nconjuncts of its antecedent is removed, the resulting general rule\ncannot be completed by an abnormic law.\n\nHere is an illustration of Bromberger\u2019s theory based on abnormic\nlaw (16). Suppose \\(a\\) is a sample of gas that expanded, and suppose\nits pressure was kept constant but its temperature increased, i.e.,\n\\(Ga\\), \\(Ea\\), and \\(Pa\\) are all true. Now consider the\nquestion:\n\n(18) Why did \\(a\\)\nexpand? \n\n\nOn Bromberger\u2019s theory, the correct answer is \\(Pa\\), i.e., \n\n (19) The pressure of \\(a\\) was\nkept constant while the temperature of \\(a\\) increased. \n\n\nThis is the correct answer because \\(Pa\\), along with \\(Ga\\) and\nabnormic law (16) form the premises of a deductive-nomological\nexplanation with conclusion \\(Ea\\), but when \\(Pa\\) is deleted as a\npremise (leaving \\(Ga\\) as a premise) and general rule (17) is\nsubstituted for abnormic law (16) as a premise, we obtain argument\n(20), which would count as a deductive-nomological explanation of\n\\(\\neg Ea\\), were it not for the fact that (17) and \\(\\neg Ea\\) are\nnot true: \n\n (20)  \\(a\\) is a\nsample of gas; no sample of gas expands; therefore \\(a\\) did not\nexpand, i.e., \\(Ga\\); \\(\\forall x(Gx\\rightarrow \\neg Ex)\\); therefore\n\\(\\neg Ea\\).  \n\n\nSo, in this application of Bromberger\u2019s theory, \\(p\\) is \\(Ea\\),\n\\(q\\) is \\(Pa\\), \\(L\\) is (16), the general rule completed by \\(L\\) is\n(17), \\(r_1\\) is \\(Ga\\), and \\(s\\) is \\(\\neg Ea\\).\n\nIntuitively, Bromberger\u2019s account makes \\(Pa\\) the correct\nanswer to (18) in virtue of the idea that \\(Pa\\) is a full\nspecification of the special (or \u201cabnormal\u201d) circumstances\ntriggering the expansion of \\(a\\). Notice that one of the premises of\nthe deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\), namely \\(Ga\\), is not\npart of the triggering package and is not part of the correct answer\nto (18). Two factors in Bromberger\u2019s account jointly keep \\(Ga\\)\nfrom being included. The first is that \\(Ga\\) is a premise not only in\nthe actual deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\) but also in the\nfictitious deductive-nomological explanation (20) of \\(\\neg Ea\\). So\nrelative to (16) and (17), \\(Ga\\) is not a special or abnormal\ncircumstance. Is there another abnormic law/general rule pair relative\nto which \\(Ga\\) would be included in the correct answer to (18)?\nApparently not, which brings us to the second factor excluding \\(Ga\\)\nfrom the correct answer to (18): if \\(Gx\\) is dropped from (17) we\nobtain the general rule \u2018Nothing expands\u2019, which it seems\nthat no abnormic law\n completes.[5].\n\nBromberger\u2019s theory was aimed at saving certain intuitions about\nwhat should and should not count as correct answers to why-questions.\nFor example, consider a straight, 40-foot high utility pole standing\nperpendicular to the ground. A taut 50-foot wire is fastened to the\ntop of the pole and to a point on the ground 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole. Now consider the question:\n\n (21) Why is the height\nof the pole 40 feet? \n\n\nand the intuitively incorrect answer \n\n (22)  Because there is\na 50 foot wire that is tautly stretched between the top of the pole\nand a point 30 feet from the base of the pole.  \n\n\nBromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct\nanswer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an\nabnormic law:\n\n (23)  No pole that is\nstraight and perpendicular to the ground is 40 feet high unless there\nis a 50 foot wire that is tautly stretched between the top of the pole\nand a point 30 feet from the base of the pole.  \n\n\nNor would (23) become an abnormic law if additional disjuncts were\nadded after \u2018unless\u2019.\n\nTeller (1974) argues that while (22) may not count as a correct answer\nto (21) on Bromberger\u2019s theory, other answers that are as\nobjectionable as (22) do get counted as correct answers, such as this\n\u201cdispositional\u201d answer to (21):\n\n (24)  Because if a 50\nfoot wire were tautly stretched from the top of the pole to the\nground, it would touch the ground at a point 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole.  \n\n\nTeller (1974, 375) argues that Bromberger\u2019s theory requires that\n(24) count as a correct answer in virtue of the following abnormic\nlaw:\n\n (25)  No pole that is\nstraight and perpendicular to the ground is 40 feet high unless it is\nsuch that if a 50 foot wire were tautly stretched from the top of the\npole to the ground, it would touch the ground at a point 30 feet from\nthe base of the pole.  \n\n\nTeller proposes other counterexamples by devising a method for turning\nexamples showing that Hempel\u2019s deductive-nomological theory of\nexplanation is too permissive into examples showing that\nBromberger\u2019s theory of why-questions is also too permissive.\nTeller\u2019s method exploits the fact that when abnormic laws are\nrewritten in certain logically equivalent ways, the resulting\nstatements must then also count as abnormic laws.\n",
