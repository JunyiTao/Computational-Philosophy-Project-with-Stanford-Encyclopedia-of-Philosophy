    "main_text": "One-self Theories || Trinity as Incoherent\n1.4 Trinity as Incoherent\n\nThe simplest sort of one-self theory affirms that God is, because\nomniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, the one divine self, and\neach Person of the Trinity just is that same self. The\n\u201cAthanasian\u201d creed (on which see section\n 5.3)\n seems to imply that each Person just is God, even while being\ndistinct from the other two Persons. Since the high middle ages\ntrinitarians have used a diagram of this sort to explain the teaching\nthat God is a Trinity.\n\n\n\n\nIf each occurrence of \u201cis\u201d here expresses numerical\nidentity, commonly expressed in modern logical notation as\n\u201c=\u201d then the chart illustrates these claims:\n\nFather = God\nSon = God\nSpirit = God\nFather \u2260 Son\nSon \u2260 Spirit\nSpirit \u2260 Father\n\n\nBut the conjunction of these claims, which has been called\n\u201cpopular Latin trinitarianism\u201d, is demonstrably incoherent\n(Tuggy 2003a, 171; Layman 2016, 138\u20139). Because the numerical\nidentity relation is defined as transitive and symmetrical, claims\n1\u20133 imply the denials of 4\u20136. If 1\u20136 are steps in an\nargument, that argument can continue thus:\n\nGod = Son (from 2, by the symmetry of =)\nFather = Son (from 1, 4, by the transitivity of =)\nGod = Spirit (from 3, by the symmetry of =)\nSon = Spirit (from 2, 6, by the transitivity of =)\nGod = Father (from 1, by the symmetry of =)\nSpirit = Father (from 3, 7, the transitivity of =)\n\n\nThis shows that 1\u20133 imply the denials of 4\u20136, namely, 8,\n10, and 12. Any Trinity doctrine which implies all of 1\u20136 is\nincoherent. To put the matter differently: it is self-evident that\nthings which are numerically identical to the same thing must also be\nnumerically identical to one another. Thus, if each Person just is\nGod, that collapses the Persons into one and the same thing. But then\na trinitarian must also say that the Persons are numerically distinct\nfrom one another.\n\nBut none of this is news to the Trinity theorists whose work is\nsurveyed in this entry. Each theory here is built with a view towards\nundermining the above argument. In other words, each theorist\ndiscussed here, with the exception of some mysterians (see section\n 4.2),\n denies that \u201cthe doctrine of the Trinity\u201d, rightly\nunderstood, implies all of 1\u20136.\n",
