    "main_text": "Logic and Rhetoric\n2. Logic and Rhetoric\n\n\nAfter Ren\u00e9 Antoine Gauthier identified in the master Guillaume\nArnauld the real author of the Lectura supra logicam veterem\nattributed to Giles of Rome (Tabarroni 1988), interest in logical\nworks focused mainly on his Commentaries on the Sophistici\nElenchi and on Posterior Analytics. In his treatment of\nthe fallacia figurae dictionis Giles proves to be a brilliant\nand original representative of \u201cmodistic logic\u201d, who bases\nhis solutions mainly on the semantics of intentiones\n(Tabarroni 1991). This does not imply, however, that he always agrees\nwith the Modists. One of the most relevant disagreements regards\nsignification. He doesn\u2019t think that signification is the essential\nform of the linguistic sign. On the contrary, sharing a a much more\nwidespread view in his times, to him, the signification of\ne.g. a name is a concept (or more precisely a definition),\nwhich in turn signifies the thing. This signification is not natural,\nbut conventional. The linguistic sign signifies in a natural way only\nits mental image, which is essential to human acts of speech (Marmo\n2016). Alessandro Conti (1992) investigated Giles\u2019 Commentary on\nPosterior Analytics as an example of his theory of truth,\nwhich brings to completion Aquinas\u2019 shift from Augustine\u2019s influence\nto the Aristotelian approach. Bertagna (2002\u20132004) investigated\nthe structure of this commentary, while Longeway (2002) and Corbini\n(2002) drew scholars\u2019 attention to Giles\u2019 epistemic logic.  Giles of\nRome also authored the most important Commentary on the Rhetoric of\nthe Latin medieval tradition, which earned him the honorific title of\nexpositor of this book and influenced all later medieval\ncommentaries. Costantino Marmo studied Giles\u2019 approach to the\ndifferent translations to which he had access and showed how he\ndeveloped Aquinas\u2019 theory of passions in commenting on the relevant\nportions of Aristotle\u2019s text (Marmo 1991), trying to solve some\nproblems left open by Aquinas. It has been suggested that Giles\nconsiders rhetoric to be a sort of \u201clogic\u201d of ethics and\npolitics: this brilliant interpretation needs, however, further\ndevelopment and articulation (Staico 1992). Janet Coleman (2000) also\nmaintained that Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical method determines the substance\nof Giles\u2019 De regimine principum, but one should also take\ninto account also Lidia Lanza\u2019s (2001) remarks. Marmo (2016) pointed\nout that if rhetoric is the modus sciendi more apt to moral\nsciences, this does not imply that it contributes to moral or\npolitical knowledge, since this is derived from the principles proper\nof ethics or politics.\n",
