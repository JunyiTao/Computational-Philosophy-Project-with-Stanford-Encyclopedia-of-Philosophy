A minimal sufficient set of connectives,\nhowever, can contain just one connective such as \\(\\mid\\) (\u201cnand,\u201d\nwhich is often called, Sheffer\u2019s stroke), or \\(\\downarrow\\)\n(\u201cnor,\u201d which is Peirce\u2019s joint denial). \u201cNand\u201d is\n\u201cnot-and,\u201d in other words, \n\\(A\\mid B\\) is defined as \\(\\lnot(A\\land B)\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\) range over\nformulas and \\(\\lnot\\) is negation. Going into the other \ndirection, if \\(\\mid\\) is a primitive, then \\(\\lnot A\\) is definable\nas \\(A\\mid A\\), and \\(A\\land B\\) is \\((A\\mid B)\\mid(A\\mid B)\\).  Although\nformulas with numerous vertical lines may quickly become \nvisually confusing and hard to parse, it is straightforward to prove\nthat \\(\\mid\\) alone is sufficiently expressive to define all the\ntruth-functions.\n\nSch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s aim was to minimize the number of logical constants\nthat are required for a formalization of FOL, just as\nHenry\u00a0M.\u00a0Sheffer (indeed, already\nCharles\u00a0S.\u00a0Peirce) did for classical propositional logic.\nOne of the two quantifiers mentioned above suffices and the other may\nbe assumed to be defined. Let us say, \\(\\exists x A\\) is an\nabbreviation for \\(\\lnot\\forall x\\lnot A\\). Even if \\(\\lnot\\)\nand the rest of the connectives are traded in for \\(\\mid\\),\ntwo logical constants remain: \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\mid\\).  A\nfurther pressing issue is that quantifiers may be nested (i.e., the\nscope of a quantifier may fully contain the scope of another\nquantifier), and the variable bindings (that could be visualized by\ndrawing lines between quantifiers and the variables they bind) may get\nquite intertwined. Keeping for a moment the familiar logical\nconstants, we may look at the following formula that hints at the\nemerging difficulties\u2014when the question to be tackled is\nconsidered in its full\n generality.[2]\n \n\\[\n\\forall x(\\exists y(Py\\land Bxy)\\supset\\exists y(Py\\land Bxy\\land \\forall\nz((Rz\\land Ozy)\\supset \\lnot Cz)))\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\forall x\\) binds all occurrences of \\(x\\); the variables in\nthe second argument place of the two \\(B\\)s are bound by one of the\ntwo \\(\\exists y\\)s, the latter of which interacts with \\(\\forall z\\)\nvia \\(Ozy\\).\n\nPredicates have a fixed finite arity in FOL, and nothing precludes\nbinding at once a variable in the first argument of one predicate and\nin the second argument of another predicate. (Indeed, FOL would lose\nsome of its expressiveness, if bindings of this sort would be excluded\nwithout some means to compensate for them.) These difficulties persist\nwhen a formula is transformed into a(n equivalent) formula in\nprenex normal form. As long as the variable bindings can\ninterweave and braid into arbitrarily complex patterns, there seems to\nbe no way to eliminate bound variables. (Note that free variables in\nopen formulas\u2014in a sense\u2014behave like local name constants,\nand their elimination is neither intended, nor achieved in the\nprocedures described here.)\n\nSch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s ingenuity was that he introduced combinators to\nuntangle variable bindings. The combinators \\(\\textsf{S}\\),\n\\(\\textsf{K}\\), \\(\\textsf{I}\\), \\(\\textsf{B}\\) and \\(\\textsf{C}\\)\n(in contemporary notation) are his, and he established that \\(\\textsf{S}\\) and\n\\(\\textsf{K}\\) suffice to define all the other combinators. In\neffect, he also defined an algorithm to carry out the elimination of\nbound variables, which is essentially one of the algorithms used\nnowadays to define bracket abstraction in\n CL.[3]\n\nSch\u00f6nfinkel introduced a new logical constant \\(U\\), that expresses\nthe disjointness of two classes. For instance, \\(UPQ\\) may be written\nin usual FOL notation as \\(\\lnot\\exists x(Px\\land Qx)\\), when \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) \nare one-place predicates. (The formula may be thought to formalize, for\ninstance, the natural language sentence \u201cNo parrots are quiet.\u201d)\nIn the process of the elimination of the bound variables, \\(UXY\\) is obtained\nfrom an expression that contains \u2018\\(Xx\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(Yx\\)\u2019, where \\(x\\) does not occur in \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\). For\nexample, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) happen to be \\(n\\)-ary predicates with\n\\(n\\ge2\\), then \\(x\\) occurs only in their last argument places. \u201cNobody\nreads Aristotle and Plato\u201d can be formalized as \\(\\lnot\\exists x(Rxa\\land\nRxp)\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) are name constants that stand for\n\u201cAristotle\u201d and \u201cPlato,\u201d respectively. This\nformula cannot be written as \\(U(Ra)(Rp)\\). On the other hand,\n\u201cThere is nobody whom both Russell and Wittgenstein read,\u201d that\nis, \\(\\lnot\\exists x(Rrx\\land Rwx)\\) turns into \\(U(Rr)(Rw)\\), where the\nparentheses delineate the arguments of \\(U\\). Often, the expressions \\(X\\)\nand \\(Y\\) (in \\(UXY\\)) consist of predicates (and name constants) together \nwith combinators and other \\(U\\)s.\n\nIt is useful to have a notation for \u201cnextand\u201d (i.e.,\n\u201cnot-exists-and\u201d) without assuming either that \\(x\\)\nhas a free occurrence in the expressions joined, or that if it has\none, then it is the last component of the expressions. Following\nSch\u00f6nfinkel, we use \\(\\mid^x\\) for the\n\u201cnextand\u201d operator that binds \\(x\\). (The \nnotation \\(\\mid^-\\), where \\(^-\\) is the place for a variable, closely\nresembles the Sheffer stroke.) Sch\u00f6nfinkel achieved his goal of\nthe reduction of the set of logical constants for FOL to a\nsingleton set \\(\\{\\mid^-\\}\\), because every formula of FOL is\nequivalent to a formula that contains only \u201cnextand.\u201d\n\nA formula \\(\\forall x A\\) is usually defined to be well-formed in\nFOL even if \\(A\\) has no free occurrences of \\(x\\). Then, of\ncourse, \\(\\forall x A\\) is equivalent to \\(A\\) as well as to \\(\\exists x A\\),\nand such quantifiers are called vacuous. In order to show that any\nformula can be rewritten into an equivalent formula that contains only\n\u201cnextand,\u201d it is sufficient to inspect the following definitions\nfor \\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\lor\\) and \\(\\forall\\) (with suitable variables)\u2014that\nare due to Sch\u00f6nfinkel. \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lnot A & \\Leftrightarrow_\\textrm{df} A\\mid^x A \\\\\nA\\lor B & \\Leftrightarrow_\\textrm{df} (A\\mid^yA)\\mid^x(B\\mid^yB) \\\\\n\\forall xAx &\\Leftrightarrow_\\textrm{df} (Ax\\mid^yAx)\\mid^x(Ax\\mid^yAx)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe definition for \\(\\lnot\\), for instance, may be justified by the following\nequivalences. \\(A\\Leftrightarrow A\\land A\\), \\(A\\land A\\Leftrightarrow \\exists\nx(A\\land A)\\) (assuming that \\(x\\) is not free in \\(A\\)), hence by\nreplacement, \\(\\lnot A\\Leftrightarrow \\lnot\\exists x(A\\land A)\\).\n\nNow we give a concrete example to illustrate how to turn a formula of\nFOL into one that contains only \\(\\mid^-\\), and then how to eliminate the\nbound variables using \\(U\\) and combinators. To put some excitement into the\nprocess, we start with the sentence in (#1).\n\n(#1)\n\nFor every natural number there is a greater prime.\n\n\n\nA straightforward formalization of this sentence\u2014on the\nforeground of the domain of numbers\u2014is the formula in (#2),\n(where \u2018\\(Nx\\)\u2019 stands for \u201c\\(x\\) is a natural\nnumber,\u201d \u2018\\(Px\\)\u2019 stands for \u201c\\(x\\) is a\nprime\u201d and \u2018\\(Gxy\\)\u2019 is to be read as \u201c\\(x\\) is\ngreater that \\(y\\)\u201d).\n\n(#2)\n\n\\(\\forall y\\exists x(Ny\\supset(Px\\land Gxy))\\)\n\n\n\nThis formula is equivalent to \\(\\forall y(Ny\\supset\\exists x(Px\\land Gxy))\\)\nand further to \\(\\lnot\\exists y\\lnot(Ny\\supset\\exists x(Px\\land Gxy))\\).  In\none or two more steps, we get \\(Ny\\mid^y(Px\\mid^xGxy)\\).  (Expressions are\nconsidered to be grouped to the left unless parentheses indicate\notherwise. E.g., \\(Gxy\\) is \\(((Gx)y)\\) not \\(G(xy)\\) as could have been,\nperhaps, expected based on the most common way of arranging parentheses in FOL\nformulas.) Unfortunately, neither \\(\\mid^x\\) nor \\(\\mid^y\\) can be replaced\nby \\(U\\) in the last expression. However, if the arguments of \\(G\\) were\npermuted then the former reduction could be carried out. One of the\ncombinators, \\(\\textsf{C}\\) does exactly what is needed: \\(Gxy\\) can be\nchanged to \\(\\textsf{C}Gyx\\) (see the definition of combinators in section\n2.1). That is, we have \\(Ny\\mid^y(Px\\mid^x\\textsf{C}Gyx)\\), and then \\(Ny\\mid^yUP\n(\\textsf{C}Gy)\\).[4]  The\nexpression may give the impression that \\(y\\) is the last component\nof \\(UP(\\textsf{C}Gy)\\), which is the second argument of \\(\\mid^y\\), but it \nis not so. The grouping within expressions cannot be disregarded, and another\ncombinator, \\(\\textsf{B}\\) is needed to turn \\(UP(\\textsf{C}Gy)\\) into the\ndesired form \\(\\textsf{B}(UP)(\\textsf{C}G)y\\).  From\n\\(Ny\\mid^y\\textsf{B}(UP)(\\textsf{C}G)y\\), we get \\(UN(\\textsf{B}(UP)\n(\\textsf{C}G))\\) in one more step. This expression is completely free of\nvariables, and it also makes the renaming of bound variables in FOL\neasily comprehensible: given two sequences of (distinct) variables that are\ndifferent in their first two elements, the reversal of the above\nprocess yields formulas that are (logically equivalent) alphabetic\nvariants of the formula in (#2).\n\nThe expression \\(UN(\\textsf{B}(UP)(\\textsf{C}G))\\) may look\n\u201cunfamiliar\u201d when compared to formulas of FOL, but\nnotation\u2014to a large extent\u2014is a matter of convention. It may be\ninteresting to note that the first \\(U\\) is simply followed by its two\narguments, however, the second \\(U\\) is not. \\(\\textsf{B}(UP)\\) is a\nsubexpression, but \\(UP(\\textsf{C}G)\\) is not a subexpressions of \\(UN\n(\\textsf{B}(UP)(\\textsf{C}G))\\).  Furthermore, the whole\nexpression can be transformed into \\(XNPG\\) using combinators,\nwhere \\(X\\) is composed of \\(U\\)s and combinators only. Such\nan \\(X\\) concisely encodes the logical form or logical\ncontent of the formula with the predicates being\narguments.[5]\n\nThe expressions obtained via the transformations outlined above\nquickly become lengthy\u2014as trying to rewrite a simple FOL\nsentence such as \\(\\exists x(Px\\land Qx)\\)\ncan show.[6]  However,\nthis does not diminish the importance of Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s theoretical\nresults. A slight increase (if any) in the length of the expressions is not\neven an inconvenience, let alone an impediment in the era of computers with\npetabytes (or even exa- and zettabytes) of memory.\n\nIt seems unfortunate that Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s reduction procedure for\nFOL is not widely known. As a measure of how widely Sheffer\u2019s and\nSch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s reductions are known, we appeal to the fact that\nthe first is part of standard intro courses in logic, whereas the\nsecond is not. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this is that\nSch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s process to eliminate bound variables is\nconceptually more opulent than defining a few truth functions from\n\\(\\mid\\) (or \\(\\downarrow\\)). Another reason may be that\nSch\u00f6nfinkel, perhaps, did not place a sufficiently strong\nemphasis on the intermediate step that allows the elimination of all\nother logical connectives and quantifiers via \u201cnextand.\u201d\nThe importance of this step was also overlooked in the introduction to\nthe English translation of Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s paper, which was written\nmore than 30 years after the original publication. We may also note\nthat although \u201cnextand\u201d is an operator in the standard\nlogical sense, it is binary\u2014unlike \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\), which\nare unary.\n\nIf \\(A\\mid B \\Leftrightarrow_\\textrm{df}\n\\lnot(A\\land B)\\) is added as a definition to SL, then the\nresult is a conservative extension, and it becomes provable\nthat for any formula \\(A(p_0,\\ldots,p_n)\\) (i.e., for a formula containing the\ndisplayed propositional variables and some connectives) there is a formula\n\\(B(p_0,\\ldots,p_n)\\) containing only the connective \\(\\mid\\), and\n\\(B(p_0,\\ldots,p_n)\\Leftrightarrow A(p_0,\\ldots,p_n)\\) itself is\nprovable. \\(\\mid\\) is, of course, interpreted as the \u201cnand\u201d truth\nfunction.  \u201cNand\u201d as a binary connective or as a binary truth\nfunction is of the same sort of object as conjunction, disjunction,\netc.\n\nThe first stage in Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s extension of FOL is analogous.\nThe addition of \\(\\mid^-\\) is (also) a conservative extension of FOL, and\nevery occurrence of \\(\\mid^-\\) can be eliminated. (We noted that \\(\\mid^-\\) is\na binary operator, and so it may be thought to combine a quantifier\n(\\(\\exists\\)) with connectives (\\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\land\\)), but \\(\\mid^-\\)\nof course, does not introduce any objects that are not definable in FOL.)\n\nThe second stage in Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s extension of FOL is slightly\ndifferent. \\(UXY\\) is definable in FOL only for one-place\npredicates \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) (or for predicates of higher\narity when the variable in their last argument is bound). Thus, in general,\nneither \\(U\\) nor the combinators are definable in FOL.\n\nThe elimination of bound variables goes beyond the resources of FOL.\nThe combinators are not only undefinable, but they are new kinds of\nobjects\u2014which are absent from FOL itself. Also, the intermediate\nsteps of the bound variable elimination procedure presuppose that\nfunctions of several arguments can be viewed as functions in one\nvariable, and the other way\naround.[7]\nEnriching a presentation of FOL with predicate letters that have\nsufficiently many arguments in the right order would be more or less\nunproblematic, and it would add objects to the language that would\nhave the same sort of interpretation as other predicates. A potential\nproblem though is that for each predicate, infinitely many\n(\\(\\aleph_0\\) many) new predicates would be needed\u2014together with axioms\nstipulating the intended equivalences between the \nmeanings of the variants of the predicates. Notationally, these steps\namount to padding predicate symbols with extra arguments, omitting\nsome arguments, as well as permuting and regrouping the arguments.\nAlthough some of these additions may look superfluous or too fussy,\nfor the understanding of Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s procedure to eliminate\nbound variables, it is crucial to note that formulas are viewed as\nstructured strings of\nsymbols.[8]\n\nIn conclusion to this section, it is important to emphasize that there\nare no questions of consistency with respect to the above\nreduction process, because it can be viewed\u2014or described in\ncontemporary terms\u2014as a well-defined algorithm. It is a\ncompletely different issue that if we consider the language of FOL\nexpanded with combinators, then the resulting system is inconsistent,\nbecause CL is powerful enough to define the fixed point of any\nfunction. The effect of having fixed points for all\nfunctions\u2014including truth functions\u2014may be thought to\namount to adding certain biconditionals (which may or may not be\nvalid) as axioms. (For instance, Russell\u2019s paradox emerges from the\nfixed point of the negation connective.) Notably, both FOL and (pure)\nCL are consistent.\n",
