    "main_text": "The Concept of Autonomy\n1. The Concept of Autonomy\n\nIn the western tradition, the view that individual autonomy is a basic\nmoral and political value is very much a modern development. Putting\nmoral weight on an individual\u2019s ability to govern herself,\nindependent of her place in a metaphysical order or her role in social\nstructures and political institutions is very much the product of the\nmodernist humanism of which much contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy is an offshoot. (For historical discussions of autonomy,\nsee Schneewind 1988, Swain 2016 and Rosich 2019). As such, it bears\nthe weight of the controversies that this legacy has attracted. The\nidea that moral principles and obligations, as well as the legitimacy\nof political authority, should be grounded in the self-governing\nindividual, considered apart from various contingencies of place,\nculture, and social relations, invites skeptics from several quarters.\nAutonomy, then, is very much at the vortex of the complex\n(re)consideration of modernity.\n\nPut most simply, to be autonomous is to govern oneself, to be directed\nby considerations, desires, conditions, and characteristics that are\nnot simply imposed externally upon one, but are part of what can\nsomehow be considered one\u2019s authentic self. Autonomy in this\nsense seems an irrefutable value, especially since its opposite\n\u2014 being guided by forces external to the self and which one\ncannot authentically embrace \u2014 seems to mark the height of\noppression. But specifying more precisely the conditions of autonomy\ninevitably sparks controversy and invites skepticism about the claim\nthat autonomy is an unqualified value for all people.\n\nAutonomy plays various roles in theoretical accounts of persons,\nconceptions of moral obligation and responsibility, the justification\nof social policies and in numerous aspects of political theory. It\nforms the core of the Kantian conception of practical reason (see,\ne.g, Korsgaard 1996, Hill 1989) and, relatedly, connects to questions\nof moral responsibility (see Wolff 1970, 12\u201319). It is also seen\nas the aspect of persons that prevents or ought to prevent\npaternalistic interventions in their lives (Dworkin 1988,\n121\u201329). It plays a role in education theory and policy, on some\nviews specifying the core goal of liberal education generally (Gutmann\n1987, Cuypers and Haji 2008; for discussion, see Brighouse 2000,\n65\u2013111). Also, despite many feminists\u2019 reservations\nconcerning the ideal of autonomy, it is sometimes seen as a valuable\nconceptual element in some feminist ideals, such as the identification\nand elimination of social conditions that victimize women and other\n(potentially) vulnerable people (Friedman 1997, Meyers 1987, Christman\n1995. Veltman and Piper 2014)).\n",
