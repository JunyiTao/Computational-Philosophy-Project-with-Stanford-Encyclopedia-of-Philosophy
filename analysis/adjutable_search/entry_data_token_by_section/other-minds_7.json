    "main_text": "The Naturalist Turn || Theory-Theory and Simulation Theory\n3.1 Theory-Theory and Simulation Theory\n\nTheory-theory has its roots in a paper by Premack and Woodruff (1978),\nwhich argued that certain problem-solving behavior observed in\nchimpanzees should be taken as evidence that they possess a theory of\nmind, as evidence that they are able to make predictions about the\nbehavior of others that impute to them unobservable mental states.\nPremack and Woodruff take this imputation to be a rather primitive and\nunsophisticated reaction to the observation of certain behavior, so\nnatural in both humans and chimpanzees that it would take an effort to\nsuppress\n it.[14]\n\nIn their commentaries on this paper (1978), Dennett, Bennett, and\nHarman pointed out that further experimentation was required in order\nto determine whether a creature possesses the concept of belief (which\nconcept is required in order to have thoughts about another\u2019s\nmental states). In particular, it would need to be shown that the\ncreature possesses the concept of false belief. Wimmer and\nPerner (1983) devised a test that purported to show just that. The\noriginal test was carried out with normally developing human children\nand taken to show that the capacity to represent false beliefs is\npresent in 4 to 6 year olds, but absent in 3 year\n olds.[15]\n Two different proposals have been put forward to explain this\ndevelopmental change. One proposal (see, e.g., Gopnik & Wellman\n1992) suggests that the child possesses a na\u00efve psychological\ntheory that it uses to explain and predict the behavior of others and\nthat gets revised by the child over time. The other proposal (see,\ne.g., Leslie & Roth 1993) suggests a native, domain-specific (or\nmodular) mechanism that matures at a certain point as what explains\nthe child\u2019s success with the false-belief test.\n\nThis approach to understanding how we attribute mental states to\nothers has several notable features: (i) it dovetails with the\ndominant approach to solving the knowledge-of-other-minds problem as\nit proposes that our belief here is the result of postulating mental\nstates as the best explanation of observed behavior; (ii) it dovetails\nwith a functionalist account of mind; and (iii) it can solve the\nasymmetry problem, as some hold the child comes to attribute mental\nstates to herself on the same model as she does others (Gopnik 2009).\nAll three features of this theory have come under criticism. This\napproach has also been challenged by further empirical work that\npurports to show that infants as young as 15 months have the concept\nof false belief (Onishi & Baillargeon 2005). One suggestion to\naccommodate this data is that we postulate two systems: one that\noperates in the infant and that is fast, efficient, inflexible and\nnon-normative, and another that develops later (and operates in tandem\nwith the earlier one in the mature human) and that is effortful,\ninflexible, normative and language-dependent (Apperly and Butterfill\n2009; for a good summary of this work and a critique of it, see Jacob\n2019). Much recent work has challenged the conclusion that the child\nwho fails the false belief test lacks a competence, suggesting instead\nthat the young child\u2019s failure with the false belief test should\nbe accounted for in terms of performance factors (in this connection\nsee work by Fabricius and Oktay-G\u00fcr & Rakoczy). Questions\nhave been raised about various aspects of the design of the original\nfalse belief test, including questions regarding the way national or\ncommunity identity may be thought to play a role in the performance\nand understanding of the tasks.\n\nRobert Gordon, Jane Heal and Alvin Goldman propose an alternative to\nthe theory-theory account of how to understand the attribution of\nmental states to others. Heal identifies in theory-theory a scientific\nmotivation that runs roughshod over important differences between\nhuman beings and the rest of the natural world. While theory-theorists\nextend a style of understanding from its application in connection\nwith the latter to the former, Heal and others propose that we come to\nunderstand what the other persons are thinking \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d, that we \u201cexploit the fact that we are or have\nminds\u201d (Heal 1998 [2003: 84]). Heal is particularly concerned\nwith the question, What further thoughts will a person have given what\nthoughts I already know her to have? (Heal (1998) also traces out\nfurther questions about others that may concern us.) Gordon (1986,\n1995) insists that simulation theory must be formulated in such a way\nas to avoid reliance on both introspection and inference from oneself\nto the other. Rather than imagine what I would do in your situation,\nhe suggests that I imagine being you in your situation. In this way,\nthinking about others is taken to parallel understanding of\none\u2019s own future behavior: one predicts what one will do by\nimagining or pretending that the world is a certain way. Simulation\ntheory has its roots in Verstehen theories favored by\nsociologists and historians such as Collingwood and Dilthey (as well\nas work by Lipps on empathy; for an overview here see Stueber 2018).\nSimulation theory was thought to be given neurophysiological backing\nby the discovery of mirror neurons in the pre-motor cortex and in\nBroca\u2019s area of the human brain that are activated both when an\nindividual acts and when she observes the actions of another (Gallese\nand Goldman 1998; Gallese 2001; Rizzolatti et al. 1996). (For an\noverview of the different versions of simulation theory that have been\nadvocated see Barlassina and Gordon 2017.)\n",
