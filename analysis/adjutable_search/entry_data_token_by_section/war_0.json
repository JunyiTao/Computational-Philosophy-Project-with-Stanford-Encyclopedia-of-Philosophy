    "main_text": "Traditionalists and Revisionists\n1. Traditionalists and Revisionists\n\nContemporary just war theory is dominated by two camps: traditionalist\nand\n revisionist.[3]\n The traditionalists might as readily be called legalists. Their views\non the morality of war are substantially led by international law,\nespecially the law of armed conflict. They aim to provide those laws\nwith morally defensible foundations. States (and only states) are\npermitted to go to war only for national defence, defence of other\nstates, or to intervene to avert \u201ccrimes that shock the moral\nconscience of mankind\u201d (Walzer 2006: 107). Civilians may not be\ntargeted in war, but all combatants, whatever they are fighting for,\nare morally permitted to target one another, even when doing so\nforeseeably harms some civilians (so long as it does not do so\n excessively).[4]\n\nRevisionists question the moral standing of states and the\npermissibility of national defence, argue for expanded permissions for\nhumanitarian intervention, problematise civilian immunity, and contend\nthat combatants fighting for wrongful aims cannot do anything right,\nbesides lay down their weapons.\n\nMost revisionists are moral revisionists only: they deny that\nthe contemporary law of armed conflict is intrinsically morally\njustified, but believe, mostly for pragmatic reasons, that it need not\nbe substantially changed. Some, however, are both morally and legally\nrevisionist. And even moral revisionists\u2019 disagreement with the\ntraditionalists is hardly ersatz: most believe that, faced with a\nclash between what is morally and what is legally permitted or\nprohibited, individuals should follow their conscience rather than the\n law.[5]\n\nThe traditionalist view received its most prominent exposition the\nsame year as it was decisively codified in international law, in the\nfirst additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions. Michael\nWalzer\u2019s Just and Unjust Wars, first published in 1977,\nhas been extraordinarily influential among philosophers, political\nscientists, international lawyers, and military practitioners. Among\nits key contributions were its defence of central traditionalist\npositions on national defence, humanitarian intervention,\ndiscrimination, and combatant equality.\n\nEarly revisionists challenged Walzer\u2019s views on national defence\n(Luban 1980a) and humanitarian intervention (Luban 1980b). Revisionist\ncriticism of combatant equality and discrimination followed (Holmes\n1989; McMahan 1994; Norman 1995). Since then there has been an\nexplosion of revisionist rebuttals of Walzer (for example Rodin 2002;\nMcMahan 2004b; McPherson 2004; Arneson 2006; Fabre 2009; McMahan 2009;\nFabre 2012).\n\nConcurrently, many philosophers welcomed Walzer\u2019s conclusions,\nbut rejected his arguments. They have accordingly sought firmer\nfoundations for broadly traditionalist positions on national defence\n(Benbaji 2014; Moore 2014), humanitarian intervention (Coady 2002),\ndiscrimination (Rodin 2008b; Dill and Shue 2012; Lazar 2015c), and\nespecially combatant equality (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Benbaji 2008;\nShue 2008; Steinhoff 2008; Emerton and Handfield 2009; Benbaji\n2011).\n\nWe will delve deeper into these debates in what follows. First,\nthough, some methodological groundwork. Traditionalists and\nrevisionists alike often rely on methodological or second-order\npremises, to the extent that one might think that the first-order\nquestions are really just proxy battles through which they work out\ntheir deeper disagreements (Lazar and Valentini forthcoming).\n",
