Empathy as the Unique Method of the Human Sciences\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, empathy understood as\na non-inferential and non-theoretical method of grasping the content\nof other minds became closely associated with the concept of\nunderstanding (Verstehen); a concept that was championed by the\nhermeneutic tradition of philosophy concerned with explicating the\nmethods used in grasping the meaning and significance of texts, works\nof arts, and actions. (For a survey of this tradition see Grondin\n1994). Hermeneutic thinkers insisted that the method used in\nunderstanding the significance of a text or a historical event has to\nbe fundamentally distinguished from the method used in explaining an\nevent within the context of the natural sciences. This methodological\ndualism is famously expressed by Droysen in saying that\n\u201chistorical research does not want to explain; that is, derive\nin a form of an inferential argument, rather it wants to\nunderstand\u201d (Droysen 1977, 403), and similarly in\nDilthey\u2019s dictum that \u201cwe explain nature, but understand\nthe life of the soul\u201d (Dilthey 1961, vol. 5, 144). Yet Droysen\nand authors before him never conceived of understanding solely as an\nact of mental imitation or solely as an act of imaginatively\n\u201ctransporting\u201d oneself into the point of view of another\nperson. Such \u201cpsychological interpretation\u201d as\nSchleiermacher (1998) used to call it, was conceived of as\nconstituting only one aspect of the interpretive method used by\nhistorians. Other tasks mentioned in this context involved critically\nevaluating the reliability of historical sources, getting to know the\nlinguistic conventions of a language, and integrating the various\nelements derived from historical sources into a consistent narrative\nof a particular epoch. The differences between these various aspects\nof the interpretive procedure were however downplayed in the early\nDilthey. For him, grasping the significance of any cultural fact had\nto be understood as a mental act of \u201ctransposition.\u201d (See\nfor example Dilthey 1961, vol. 5, 263\u2013265). .\n\nIronically, the close association of the concepts of empathy and\nunderstanding and the associated claim that empathy is the sole and\nunique method of the human sciences also facilitated the decline of\nthe empathy concept and its almost utter disregard by philosophers of\nthe human and social sciences later on, in both the analytic and\ncontinental/hermeneutic traditions of philosophy. Within both\ntraditions, proponents of empathy were\u2014for very different\nreasons\u2014generally seen as advocating an epistemically na\u00efve\nand insufficiently broad conception of the methodological proceedings\nin the human sciences. As a result, most philosophers of the human and\nsocial sciences maintained their distance from the idea that empathy\nis central for our understanding of other minds and mental phenomena.\nNotable exceptions in this respect are R.G. Collingwood and his\nfollowers, who suggested that reenacting another person\u2019s\nthoughts is necessary for understanding them as rational agents\n(Collingwood 1946, Dray 1957 and 1995). Notice however that in\ncontrast to the contemporary debate about folk psychology, the debate\nabout empathy in the philosophy of social science is not concerned\nwith investigating underlying causal mechanisms. Rather, it addresses\nnormative questions of how to justify a particular explanation or\ninterpretation.\n",
