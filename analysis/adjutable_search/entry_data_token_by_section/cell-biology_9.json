Although sometimes\nresearchers can proceed by reasoning a priori about what\ncomponent activities would be required to produce a given phenomenon,\nmost often the decomposition is developed on the basis of experiments.\nWhile the goal is to identify both parts and operations and to link\nthem, a given group of researchers may only have research techniques\nthat allow them to identify one or the other. This was the case in\ncell biology. As discussed in\n Section 1,\n microscopic research enabled researchers to identify component parts\n(organelles) of cells, but except for indirect clues such as shape or\nthe ability of an organelle to take up a stain, these researchers were\nunable to procure information about the functions they performed.\nBiochemists on the other hand were able to identify reactions involved\nin many cell activities, but since they studied these in chemical\nsoups made by grinding up the cell, they were not able to link these\nto cell structures. Cell biology developed with the introduction of\nnew techniques such as cell fractionation and electron microscopy that\nopened up the possibility of localizing biochemical reactions in\norganelles.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the sense in which decomposition is\nreductionistic is very different from that involved in more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of theory reduction, which involves\nthe derivation of one theory from another (Nagel 1961; see the entries\non\n scientific reduction\n and\n reductionism in biology).\n Researchers pursue decomposition without assuming the existence of\nfull theories at either level or that a theory at one level can be\nderived from one at a lower level. Moreover, in pursuing decomposition\nresearchers typically do not assume that knowledge of the lower-level\ncomponents is sufficient for explaining the phenomena\u2014at a\nminimum, they recognize that how the components are organized is also\nimportant. The association of a cell process with a specific enzyme is\nnot the end of the explanatory process\u2014the activity of enzymes\nis often affected by the context in which the enzyme exists, for\nexample, in a membrane. For this reason, researchers value in\nvitro reconstitution experiments in establishing that they have\ncorrectly accounted for a phenomenon.\n\nAllchin (1996, 2007) and Weber (2002), analyze an important\nreconstitution experiment at the interface of cell biology and\nbiochemistry that played a major role in resolving a conflict between\ntwo opposing accounts of the synthesis of ATP in oxidative metabolism.\nBiochemists spent a couple decades trying to identify a purely\nchemical pathway that used the energy released in oxidative metabolism\nto synthesize ATP (as happens in glycolysis). P. Mitchell (1961)\nadvanced an alternative, chemiosmotic hypothesis according to which\nenergy was transferred via the creation of a proton gradient over a\nmembrane. Kagawa and Racker (1966) had already linked ATP synthase to\nsmall knobs on the inner mitochondrial membrane but it was an\nin vitro chimeric system combining fragments from bacteria,\nplants, and animals created by Racker and Stoeckenius (1974) that\ndemonstrated that energy could first be captured in a proton gradient\nand then used in mitochondria to synthesize ATP. Unlike purely\nbiochemical accounts that discounted cell structure, this research\nshowed the importance of not just enzymes but how they are situated\nwith respect to cell structures in explaining cellular phenomena. \n",
