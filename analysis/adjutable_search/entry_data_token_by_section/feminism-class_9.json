Anarchist Perspectives on Work and its Other\n\nSo far, it has been assumed that work is an intrinsic good.\n\nWhat if waged or unwaged work itself were to be considered problematic\nor oppressive? Autonomous Marxists contest that liberal or socialist\nfeminist perspectives have unnecessarily mystified work and have\noperated with a moralism. Autonomists are associated with the\nOperaismo, post-Operaismo and Autonomia movements, the Midnight Notes\nCollective, Zerowork, Lotta Feminista, and the Wages for Housework\nmovement (Weeks 2011, 241). Whether one ought to be paid for housework\nor reproductive labor or seek equal employment opportunities,\nfeminists have not sufficiently opposed the sanctification of work.\nChampioning the refusal of work means to abandon a narrow focus on the\ncritique of the extraction of surplus value or of the process of\ndeskilling. Furthermore, it is imperative to interrogate how work\ndominates our lives (Weeks 2011, 13). Kathi Weeks charges that a\nproductivist bias is common to feminist and Marxist analysis. The\ncredo of autonomists then is liberation from work, in\ncontradistinction to Marxist humanists such as Erich Fromm\u2019s\nadvocacy for liberation of work.\n\nThe Wages for Housework campaign demanded purposefully the impossible.\nThese feminists did not only ask for compensation for unpaid domestic\nlabor, but also postulated the end of such work (Federici 1975).\nPost-work also means post-domestic care, something that gets lost in\nsome of the ethic of care analysis, which inadvertently fosters a\nromantic attachment to endowing meaning to such work. Furthermore,\npost-work also appeals to carving out space for \u201cqueer\ntime\u201d and queer resistant agency (Halberstam 2005, Lehr 1999),\nan appeal to unscripted life. A wholesale critique of housework is not\neasily understood; even Arlie Hochschild\u2019s (1997) own analysis\nof her ethnographic studies of diverse family practices comes to the\nconclusion that authentic housework should be sanctified and set apart\nfrom mere alienating factory production (Weeks 2011,\n157\u201359).\n\nA post-work ethic entails a playful commitment to leisure and\nunstructured activities such as day-dreaming. Joseph Trullinger (2016)\nextends Kathi Weeks\u2019 analysis by drawing on Marcuse\u2019s\nconcept of great refusal and playful labor defying commodity fetishism\nand productivism. By ignoring the liberatory power of play, Weeks\ninsufficiently engages the meaning of work and the asceticism of the\nwork ethic (Trullinger 2016, 469). Still, the danger of play morphing\ninto (unpaid) labor is real, as evinced by social media corporate\ngiant FaceBook exploiting play-labor for capitalist gains (Fuchs 2016)\nand a corporate feminism may ask us to \u201clean in\u201d (Sandberg\n2013) rather than \u201clean out.\u201d\n",
