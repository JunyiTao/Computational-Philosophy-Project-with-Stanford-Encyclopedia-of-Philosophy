    "main_text": "\n1. Definitions of \u201cAtheism\u201d\n\nThe word \u201catheism\u201d is polysemous\u2014it has multiple related\nmeanings. In the psychological sense of the word, atheism is a\npsychological state, specifically the state of being an atheist, where\nan atheist is defined as someone who is not a theist and a theist is\ndefined as someone who believes that God exists (or that there are\ngods). This generates the following definition: atheism is the\npsychological state of lacking the belief that God exists. In\nphilosophy, however, and more specifically in the philosophy of\nreligion, the term \u201catheism\u201d is standardly used to refer to\nthe proposition that God does not exist (or, more broadly, to the\nproposition that there are no gods).  Thus, to be an atheist on\nthis definition, it does not suffice to suspend judgment on whether\nthere is a God, even though that implies a lack of theistic belief.\nInstead, one must deny that God exists. This metaphysical sense of the\nword is preferred over other senses, including the psychological\nsense, not just by theistic philosophers, but by many (though not all)\natheists in philosophy as well. For example, Robin Le Poidevin writes,\n\u201cAn atheist is one who denies the existence of a\npersonal, transcendent creator of the universe, rather than one who\nsimply lives his life without reference to such a being\u201d (1996:\nxvii). J. L. Schellenberg says that \u201cin philosophy, the atheist\nis not just someone who doesn\u2019t accept theism, but more strongly\nsomeone who opposes it.\u201d In other words, it is \u201cthe denial\nof theism, the claim that there is no God\u201d (2019: 5).\n\nThis definition is also found in multiple encyclopedias and\ndictionaries of philosophy. For example, in the Concise Routledge\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy, William L. Rowe (also an atheist)\nwrites, \u201cAtheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of\nGod. It proposes positive disbelief rather than mere suspension of\nbelief\u201d (2000: 62).  The Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy recognizes multiple senses of the word\n\u201catheism\u201d, but is clear about which is standard in\nphilosophy:\n\n\n[Atheism is] the view that there are no gods. A widely used sense\ndenotes merely not believing in god and is consistent with agnosticism\n[in the psychological sense]. A stricter sense denotes a belief that\nthere is no god; this use has become standard. (Pojman 2015,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nInterestingly, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy recommends a\nslight broadening of the standard definition of \u201catheist\u201d.\nIt still requires rejection of belief in God as opposed to merely\nlacking that belief, but the basis for the rejection need not be that\ntheism is false. For example, it might instead be that it is\nmeaningless.\n\n\nAccording to the most usual definition, an atheist is a\nperson who maintains that there is no God, that is, that the sentence\n\u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a false proposition. In contrast, an\nagnostic [in the epistemological sense] maintains that it is not known\nor cannot be known whether there is a God, that is, whether the\nsentence \u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a true proposition. On our\ndefinition, an atheist is a person who rejects belief in God,\nregardless of whether or not the reason for the rejection is the claim\nthat \u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a false proposition. People\nfrequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for\nreasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among\ncontemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier\ncenturies, to reject positions on the ground that they are\nmeaningless. (Edwards 2006: 358)\n\n\nAt least until recently, the standard metaphysical understanding of\nthe meaning of \u201catheism\u201d was so ingrained in philosophy that\nphilosophers could safely use the word \u201catheism\u201d in that\nsense without worrying that they might be misunderstood and without\nfeeling any need to defend it. For example, in his book, Arguing\nAbout Gods, Graham Oppy (another atheist) repeatedly treats\n\u201cagnostic\u201d (in the psychological sense of someone who\nsuspends judgment about God\u2019s existence) and \u201catheist\u201d\nas mutually exclusive categories (2006, 1, 15, and 34) without\noffering any justification for doing so. The only plausible\nexplanation for his failure to provide justification is that he\nexpects his readers to construe the term \u201catheism\u201d in its\nmetaphysical sense and thus to exclude from the class of atheists\nanyone who suspends judgment about whether gods exist.  Another\nsign of how dominant the standard definition is within the field of\nphilosophy is the frequent use of the term \u201cnon-theist\u201d to\nrefer to the broader class of people who lack the belief that God\nexists.\n\nOf course, from the fact that \u201catheism\u201d is standardly\ndefined in philosophy as the proposition that God does not exist, it\ndoes not follow that it ought to be defined that way. And the\nstandard definition is not without its philosophical opponents. For\nexample, some writers at least implicitly identify atheism with a\npositive metaphysical theory like naturalism or even materialism.\nGiven this sense of the word, the meaning of \u201catheism\u201d is\nnot straightforwardly derived from the meaning of\n\u201ctheism\u201d. While this might seem etymologically bizarre,\nperhaps a case can be made for the claim that something like\n(metaphysical) naturalism was originally labeled \u201catheism\u201d\nonly because of the cultural dominance of non-naturalist forms of\ntheism, not because the view being labeled was nothing more than the\ndenial of theism. On this view, there would have been atheists even if\nno theists ever existed\u2014they just wouldn\u2019t have been\ncalled \u201catheists\u201d. Baggini [2003, 3\u201310] suggests this line\nof thought, although his \u201cofficial\u201d definition is the\nstandard metaphysical one. While this definition of\n\u201catheism\u201d is a legitimate one, it is often accompanied by\nfallacious inferences from the (alleged) falsity or probable falsity\nof atheism (= naturalism) to the truth or probable truth of\ntheism.\n\nDeparting even more radically from the norm in philosophy, a few\nphilosophers (e.g., Michael Martin 1990: 463\u2013464) join many\nnon-philosophers in defining \u201catheist\u201d as someone who\nlacks the belief that God exists.  This commits them to adopting the\npsychological sense of \u201catheism\u201d discussed above,\naccording to which \u201catheism\u201d should not be defined as a\nproposition at all, even if theism is a proposition. Instead,\n\u201catheism\u201d, according to these philosophers, should be\ndefined as a psychological state: the state of not believing in the\nexistence of God (or gods). This view was famously proposed by the\nphilosopher Antony Flew and arguably played a role in his (1972)\ndefense of an alleged presumption of \u201catheism\u201d. The\neditors of the Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Bullivant &\nRuse 2013) also favor this definition and one of them, Stephen\nBullivant (2013), defends it on grounds of scholarly utility. His\nargument is that this definition can best serve as an umbrella term\nfor a wide variety of positions that have been identified with\natheism. Scholars can then use adjectives like \u201cstrong\u201d\nand \u201cweak\u201d (or \u201cpositive\u201d and\n\u201cnegative\u201d) to develop a taxonomy that differentiates\nvarious specific atheisms. Unfortunately, this argument overlooks the\nfact that, if atheism is defined as a psychological state, then no\nproposition can count as a form of atheism because a proposition is\nnot a psychological state. This undermines Bullivant\u2019s argument\nin defense of Flew\u2019s definition; for it implies that what he\ncalls \u201cstrong atheism\u201d\u2014the proposition (or belief in\nthe sense of \u201csomething believed\u201d) that there is no\nGod\u2014is not really a variety of atheism at all. In short, his\nproposed \u201cumbrella\u201d term leaves so-called strong atheism\n(or what some call positive atheism) out in the rain.\n\nAlthough Flew\u2019s definition of \u201catheism\u201d fails as an\numbrella term, it is certainly a legitimate definition in the sense\nthat it reports how a significant number of people use the term.\nAgain, the term \u201catheism\u201d has more than one legitimate\nmeaning, and nothing said in this entry should be interpreted as an\nattempt to proscribe how people label themselves or what meanings they\nattach to those labels. The issue for philosophy and thus for this\nentry is which definition is the most useful for scholarly or, more\nnarrowly, philosophical purposes. In other contexts, of course, the\nissue of how best to define \u201catheism\u201d or\n\u201catheist\u201d may look very different. For example, in some\ncontexts the crucial question may be which definition of\n\u201catheist\u201d (as opposed to \u201catheism\u201d) is the\nmost useful politically, especially in light of the bigotry that those\nwho identify as atheists face. The fact that there is strength in\nnumbers may recommend a very inclusive definition of\n\u201catheist\u201d that brings anyone who is not a theist into the\nfold. Having said that, one would think that it would further no good\ncause, political or otherwise, to attack fellow non-theists who do not\nidentify as atheists simply because they choose to use the term\n\u201catheist\u201d in some other, equally legitimate sense.\n\nThe next question, then, is why the standard metaphysical definition\nof \u201catheism\u201d is especially useful for doing philosophy. One\nobvious reason is that it has the virtue of making atheism a direct\nanswer to one of the most important metaphysical questions in\nphilosophy of religion, namely, \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d There are\nonly two possible direct answers to this question: \u201cyes\u201d,\nwhich is theism, and \u201cno\u201d, which is atheism in the\nmetaphysical sense. Answers like \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d,\n\u201cno one knows\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, \u201can\naffirmative answer has never been established\u201d, and \u201cthe\nquestion is meaningless\u201d are not direct answers to this question\n(cf. Le Poidevin 2010: 8). It is useful for philosophers to have a\ngood name for this important metaphysical position, and\n\u201catheism\u201d works beautifully for that purpose. Of course, it\nmay also be useful on occasion to have a term to refer to all people\nwho lack theistic belief, but as noted above philosophers already have\nsuch a term, namely, \u201cnontheist\u201d, so the term\n\u201catheist\u201d is not needed for that purpose.\n\nA second reason for preferring the metaphysical definition is that the\ntwo main alternatives to it have undesirable implications. Defining\n\u201catheism\u201d as naturalism has the awkward implication that\nsome philosophers are both theists and atheists. This is because some\nphilosophers (e.g., Ellis 2014) deny that God is supernatural and\naffirm both naturalism and theism. Defining \u201catheism\u201d as the\nstate of lacking belief in God faces similar problems.  First,\nwhile this definition seems short and simple, which is virtuous, it\nneeds to be expanded to avoid the issue of babies, cats, and rocks\ncounting as atheists by virtue of lacking belief in God.  While\nthis problem is relatively easy to solve, another is more challenging.\nThis additional problem arises because one can lack belief in God\nwhile at the same time having other pro-attitudes towards theism. For\nexample, some people who lack the belief that God exists may\nnevertheless feel some inclination to believe that God exists. They\nmay even believe that the truth of theism is more probable than its\nfalsity. While such people should not be labeled theists, it is\ncounterintuitive in the extreme to call them atheists. The\npsychological definition also makes atheists out of some people who\nare devoted members (at least in terms of practice) of theistic\nreligious communities.  This is because, as is well-known, some\ndevoted members of such communities have only a vague middling level\nof confidence that God exists and no belief that God exists or even\nthat God probably exists.  It would seem misguided for\nphilosophers to classify such people as atheists.\n\nA third reason to prefer the standard definition in philosophy is that\nit makes the definitions of \u201catheism\u201d and \u201ctheism\u201d\nsymmetrical. One problem with defining \u201catheism\u201d as a\npsychological state is that philosophers do not define\n\u201ctheism\u201d as a psychological state, nor should they.\n\u201cTheism,\u201d like most other philosophical \u201c-isms\u201d,\nis understood in philosophy to be a proposition. This is crucial\nbecause philosophers want to say that theism is true or false and,\nmost importantly, to construct or evaluate arguments for theism.\nPsychological states cannot be true or false, nor can they be the\nconclusions of arguments. Granted, philosophers sometimes define\n\u201ctheism\u201d as \u201cthe belief that God exists\u201d\nand it makes sense to argue for a belief and to say that a belief is\ntrue or false, but here \u201cbelief\u201d means \u201csomething\nbelieved\u201d. It refers to the propositional content of belief, not\nto the attitude or psychological state of believing. If, however,\n\u201ctheism\u201d is defined as the proposition that God exists and\n\u201ctheist\u201d as someone who believes that proposition, then it\nmakes sense to define \u201catheism\u201d and \u201catheist\u201d in\nan analogous way. This means, first, defining \u201catheism\u201d as a\nproposition or position so that it can be true or false and can be the\nconclusion of an argument and, second, defining \u201catheist\u201d as\nsomeone who believes that proposition. Since it is also natural to\ndefine \u201catheism\u201d in terms of theism, it follows that, in the\nabsence of good reasons to do otherwise, it is best for philosophers\nto understand the \u201ca-\u201d in \u201catheism\u201d as negation\ninstead of absence, as \u201cnot\u201d instead of\n\u201cwithout\u201d\u2014in other words, to take atheism to be the\ncontradictory of theism.\n\nTherefore, for all three of these reasons, philosophers ought to\nconstrue atheism as the proposition that God does not exist (or, more\nbroadly, as the proposition that there are no divine realities of any\nsort).\n\nIf, as has been argued here, atheism is both usually and\nbest understood in philosophy as the metaphysical claim that\nGod does not exist, then what, one might wonder, should philosophers\ndo with the popular term, \u201cNew Atheism\u201d? Philosophers\nwrite articles on and have devoted journal issues (French &\nWettstein 2013) to the New Atheism, but there is nothing close to a\nconsensus on how that term should be defined. Fortunately, there is no\nreal need for one, because the term \u201cNew Atheism\u201d does not\npick out some distinctive philosophical position or phenomenon.\nInstead, it is a popular label for a movement prominently represented\nby four authors\u2014Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and\nChristopher Hitchens\u2014whose work is uniformly critical of\nreligion, but beyond that appears to be unified only by timing and\npopularity. Further, one might question what is new about the New\nAtheism. The specific criticisms of religion and of arguments used to\ndefend religion are not new. For example, an arguably more\nsophisticated and convincing version of Dawkins\u2019 central\natheistic argument can be found in Hume\u2019s Dialogues\n(Wielenberg 2009). Also, while Dennett (2006) makes a passionate call\nfor the scientific study of religion as a natural phenomenon, such\nstudy existed long before this call. Indeed, even the cognitive\nscience of religion was well established by the 1990s, and the\nanthropology of religion can be traced back at least to the nineteenth\ncentury. Shifting from content to style, many are surprised by the\nmilitancy of some New Atheists, but there were plenty of aggressive\natheists who were quite disrespectful to religion long before Harris,\nDawkins, and Hitchens. (Dennett is not especially militant.) Finally,\nthe stereotype that New Atheism is religious or quasi-religious or\nideological in some unprecedented way is clearly a false one and one\nthat New Atheists reject. (For elaboration of these points, see Zenk\n2013.)\n\nAnother subcategory of atheism is \u201cfriendly atheism\u201d,\nwhich William Rowe (1979) defines as the position that, although God\ndoes not exist, some (intellectually sophisticated) people are\njustified in believing that God exists. Rowe, a friendly atheist\nhimself, contrasts friendly atheism with unfriendly atheism and\nindifferent atheism. Unfriendly atheism is the view that atheism is\ntrue and that no (sophisticated) theistic belief is justified. Despite\nits highly misleading name, this view might be held by the\nfriendliest, most open-minded and religiously tolerant person\nimaginable. Finally, although Rowe refers to \u201cindifferent\natheism\u201d as a \u201cposition\u201d, it is not a proposition\nbut instead a psychological state, specifically, the state of being an\natheist who is neither friendly nor unfriendly\u2014that is, who\nneither believes that friendly atheism is true nor believes that\nunfriendly atheism is true.\n\nPerhaps an even more interesting distinction is between pro-God\natheism and anti-God atheism. A pro-God atheist like John Schellenberg\n(who coined the term in unpublished work) is someone who in some real\nsense loves God or at least the idea of God, who tries very hard to\nimagine what sorts of wonderful worlds such a being might create\n(instead of just assuming that such a being would create a world\nsomething like the world we observe), and who (at least\npartly) for that very reason believes that God does not exist. Such an\natheist might be sympathetic to the following sentiments:\n\n\nIt is an insult to God to believe in God. For on the one hand it is to\nsuppose that he has perpetrated acts of incalculable cruelty. On the\nother hand, it is to suppose that he has perversely given his human\ncreatures an instrument\u2014their intellect\u2014which must\ninevitably lead them, if they are dispassionate and honest, to deny\nhis existence. It is tempting to conclude that if he exists, it is the\natheists and agnostics that he loves best, among those with any\npretensions to education. For they are the ones who have taken him\nmost seriously. (Strawson 1990)\n\n\nBy contrast, anti-God atheists like Thomas Nagel (1997: 130\u2013131)\nfind the whole idea of a God offensive and hence not only believe but\nalso hope very much that no such being exists. Nagel is often\ncalled an \u201cantitheist\u201d (e.g., Kahane 2011), but that term\nis purposely avoided here, as it has many different senses (Kahane\n2011: note 9). Also, in none of those senses is one required to be an\natheist in order to be an antitheist, so antitheism is not a variety\nof atheism.\n2. Definitions of \u201cAgnosticism\u201d\n\nThe terms \u201cagnostic\u201d and \u201cagnosticism\u201d were\nfamously coined in the late nineteenth century by the English\nbiologist, T.H. Huxley. He said that he originally\n\n\ninvented the word \u201cAgnostic\u201d to denote people who, like\n[himself], confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a\nvariety of matters [including of course the matter of God\u2019s\nexistence], about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox\nand heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost confidence. (1884)\n\n\nHe did not, however, define \u201cagnosticism\u201d simply as the\nstate of being an agnostic. Instead, he often used that term to refer\nto a normative epistemological principle, something similar to (though\nweaker than) what we now call \u201cevidentialism\u201d. Roughly,\nHuxley\u2019s principle says that it is wrong to say that one knows\nor believes that a proposition is true without logically satisfactory\nevidence (Huxley 1884 and 1889). But it was Huxley\u2019s application\nof this principle to theistic and atheistic belief that ultimately had\nthe greatest influence on the meaning of the term. He argued that,\nsince neither of those beliefs is adequately supported by evidence, we\nought to suspend judgment on the issue of whether or not there is a\nGod.\n\nNowadays, the term \u201cagnostic\u201d is often used (when the\nissue is God\u2019s existence) to refer to those who follow the\nrecommendation expressed in the conclusion of Huxley\u2019s argument:\nan agnostic is a person who has entertained the proposition that there\nis a God but believes neither that it is true nor that it is false.\nNot surprisingly, then, the term \u201cagnosticism\u201d is\noften defined, both in and outside of philosophy, not as a principle\nor any other sort of proposition but instead as the psychological\nstate of being an agnostic. Call this the \u201cpsychological\u201d\nsense of the term. It is certainly useful to have a term to refer to\npeople who are neither theists nor atheists, but philosophers might\nwish that some other term besides \u201cagnostic\u201d\n(\u201ctheological skeptic\u201d, perhaps?) were used. The problem\nis that it is also very useful for philosophical purposes to have a\nname for the epistemological position that follows from the premise of\nHuxley\u2019s argument, the position that neither theism nor atheism\nis known, or most ambitiously, that neither the belief that God exists\nnor the belief that God does not exist has positive epistemic status\nof any sort. Just as the metaphysical question of God\u2019s\nexistence is central to philosophy of religion, so too is the\nepistemological question of whether or not theism or atheism is known\nor has some other sort of positive epistemic status like being\njustified, rational, reasonable, or probable. And given the etymology\nof \u201cagnostic\u201d, what better term could there be for a\nnegative answer to that epistemological question than\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d? Further, as suggested earlier, it is, for\nvery good reason, typical in philosophy to use the suffix\n\u201c-ism\u201d to refer to a proposition instead of to a state or\ncondition, since only the former can sensibly be tested by\nargument.\n\nIf, however, \u201cagnosticism\u201d is defined as a proposition,\nthen \u201cagnostic\u201d must be defined in terms of\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d instead of the other way around.\nSpecifically, \u201cagnostic\u201d must be defined as a person who\nbelieves that the proposition \u201cagnosticism\u201d is true\ninstead of \u201cagnosticism\u201d being defined as the state of\nbeing an agnostic. And if the proposition in question is that neither\ntheism nor atheism is known to be true, then the term\n\u201cagnostic\u201d can no longer serve as a label for those who\nare neither theists nor atheists since one can consistently believe\nthat atheism (or theism) is true while denying that atheism (or\ntheism) is known to be true.\n\nWhen used in this epistemological sense, the term\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d can very naturally be extended beyond the\nissue of what is or can be known to cover a large family of positions,\ndepending on what sort of \u201cpositive epistemic status\u201d is\nat issue. For example, it might be identified with any of the\nfollowing positions: that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief\nis justified, that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief is\nrationally required, that neither belief is rationally permissible,\nthat neither has warrant, that neither is reasonable, or that neither\nis probable. Also, in order to avoid the vexed issue of the nature of\nknowledge, one can simply distinguish as distinct members of the\n\u201cagnosticism family\u201d each of the following claims about\nintellectually sophisticated people: (i) neither theism nor atheism is\nadequately supported by the internal states of such people, (ii)\nneither theistic belief nor atheistic belief coheres with the rest of\ntheir beliefs, (iii) neither theistic nor atheistic belief results\nfrom reliable belief-producing processes, (iv) neither theistic belief\nnor atheistic belief results from faculties aimed at truth that are\nfunctioning properly in an appropriate environment, and so on.\n\nNotice too that, even if agnosticism were defined as the rather\nextreme position that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief\never has positive epistemic status of any sort, it\nwouldn\u2019t follow by definition that no agnostic is\neither a theist or an atheist. Some fideists, for example, believe\nthat neither atheistic belief nor theistic belief is supported or\nsanctioned in any way at all by reason because reason leaves the\nmatter of God\u2019s existence completely unresolved. Yet they have\nfaith that God exists and such faith (at least in some cases) involves\nbelief. Thus, some fideists are extreme agnostics in the\nepistemological sense even though they are not agnostics in the\npsychological sense.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that, even in Huxley\u2019s time, some\napophatic theists embraced the term \u201cagnostic\u201d, claiming\nthat all good Christians worshipped an \u201cunknown God\u201d. More\nrecently, some atheists proudly call themselves \u201cagnostic\natheists\u201d, although with further reflection the symmetry between\nthis position and fideism might give them pause. More likely, though,\nwhat is being claimed by these self-identified agnostic atheists is\nthat, while their belief that God does not exist has positive\nepistemic status of some sort (minimally, it is not irrational), it\ndoes not have the sort of positive epistemic status that can turn true\nbelief into knowledge.\n\nNo doubt both senses of \u201cagnosticism\u201d, the psychological\nand the epistemological, will continue to be used both inside and\noutside of philosophy. Hopefully, context will help to disambiguate.\nIn the remainder of this entry, however, the term\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d will be used in its epistemological sense.\nThis makes a huge difference to the issue of justification. Consider,\nfor example, this passage written by the agnostic, Anthony Kenny\n(1983: 84\u201385):\n\n\nI do not myself know of any argument for the existence of God which I\nfind convincing; in all of them I think I can find flaws. Equally, I\ndo not know of any argument against the existence of God which is\ntotally convincing; in the arguments I know against the existence of\nGod I can equally find flaws. So that my own position on the existence\nof God is agnostic.\n\n\nIt is one thing to ask whether Kenny\u2019s inability to find\narguments that convince him of God\u2019s existence or non-existence\njustifies him personally in suspending judgment about the existence of\nGod. It is quite another to ask whether this inability (or anything\nelse) would justify his believing that no one (or at least no one who\nis sufficiently intelligent and well-informed) has a justified belief\nabout God\u2019s existence.\n\nIf agnosticism (in one sense of the word) is the position that neither\ntheism nor atheism is known, then it might be useful to use the term\n\u201cgnosticism\u201d to refer to the contradictory of that\nposition, that is, to the position that either theism or atheism is\nknown. That view would, of course, come in two flavors: theistic\ngnosticism\u2014the view that theism is known (and hence atheism is\nnot)\u2014and atheistic gnosticism\u2014the view that atheism is\nknown (and hence theism is not).\n3. Global Atheism Versus Local Atheisms\n\nJeanine Diller (2016) points out that, just as most theists have a\nparticular concept of God in mind when they assert that God exists,\nmost atheists have a particular concept of God in mind when they\nassert that God does not exist. Indeed, many atheists are only vaguely\naware of the variety of concepts of God that there are. For example,\nthere are the Gods of classical and neo-classical theism: the\nAnselmian God, for instance, or, more modestly, the all-powerful,\nall-knowing, and perfectly good creator-God that receives so much\nattention in contemporary philosophy of religion. There are also the\nGods of specific Western theistic religions like Christianity, Islam,\nJudaism, and Sikhism, which may or may not be best understood as\nclassical or neo-classical Gods. There are also panentheistic and\nprocess theistic Gods, as well as a variety of other God-concepts,\nboth of Western and non-Western origin, that are largely ignored by\neven the most well-informed atheists. (Philosophically sophisticated\ntheists, for their part, often act as if refuting naturalism\nestablishes the existence of the particular sort of God in which they\nbelieve.) Diller distinguishes local atheism, which denies the\nexistence of one sort of God, from global atheism, which is the\nproposition that there are no Gods of any sort\u2014that all\nlegitimate concepts of God lack instances.\n\nGlobal atheism is a very difficult position to justify (Diller 2016:\n11\u201316). Indeed, very few atheists have any good reason to\nbelieve that it is true since the vast majority of atheists have made\nno attempt to reflect on more than one or two of the many legitimate\nconcepts of God that exist both inside and outside of various\nreligious communities. Nor have they reflected on what criteria must\nbe satisfied in order for a concept of God to count as\n\u201clegitimate\u201d, let alone on the possibility of legitimate\nGod concepts that have not yet been conceived and on the implications\nof that possibility for the issue of whether or not global atheism is\njustified. Furthermore, the most ambitious atheistic arguments popular\nwith philosophers, which attempt to show that the concept of God is\nincoherent or that God\u2019s existence is logically incompatible\neither with the existence of certain sorts of evil or with the\nexistence of certain sorts of non-belief [Schellenberg 2007]),\ncertainly won\u2019t suffice to justify global atheism; for even if\nthey are sound, they assume that to be God a being must be omnipotent,\nomniscient, and perfectly good, and as the character Cleanthes points\nout at the beginning of Part XI of Hume\u2019s Dialogues\n(see also Nagasawa 2008), there are religiously adequate God-concepts\nthat don\u2019t require God to have those attributes.\n\nGlobal atheists might object that, even if atheism and (metaphysical)\nnaturalism are not identical, a belief in the former can be based on a\nbelief in the latter; in other words, if one has good arguments for\nthe view that nature is a closed system, then that removes any burden\nto consider each God-concept separately, so long as all legitimate\nconcepts of God imply that God is a supernatural entity\u2014that is,\nan entity that is not natural, yet affects nature. Whether or not this\nstrategy for justifying global atheism works depends on whether it is\npossible to define \u201cnaturalism\u201d narrowly enough to imply\nthe non-existence of all Gods but not so narrowly that no convincing\narguments can be given for its truth. This is no easy task, especially\ngiven recent work on naturalist forms of theism (e.g., Bishop 2008;\nBuckareff & Nagasawa 2016: Part V; Diller & Kasher 2013: Part\nX; and Ellis 2014). Nor is it obvious that evidential arguments from\nevil can be extended to cover all legitimate God concepts, though if\nall genuine theisms entail that ultimate reality is both aligned with\nthe good and salvific (in some religiously adequate sense of\n\u201cultimate\u201d and \u201csalvific\u201d), then perhaps they\ncan. The crucial point, however, is that no one has yet made that\ncase.\n\nConcerning the issue of what exactly counts as a legitimate or\nreligiously adequate concept of God, various approaches might be\ntaken. One general strategy is to identify the religious role or roles\nthat anything deserving of the name or title \u201cGod\u201d must\nplay and then distinguish legitimate or illegitimate concepts of God\ndepending on whether anything falling under the concept in question\ncould or would successfully play that role. (See, for example, Le\nPoidevin 2010: 52; and Leftow 2016: 66\u201371.)\n\nA second approach (compatible with the first) assumes plausibly that\nthe word \u201cGod\u201d is a title instead of a proper name and\nthen asks what qualifications are required to bear that title (Pike\n1970). The fact that most titles indicate either rank or function\nsuggests that the meaning of \u201cGod\u201d has something to do\neither with occupying a position in a hierarchy or performing some\nfunction. For example, the common dictionary definition of\n\u201cGod\u201d as the Supreme Being and the Anselmian idea of God\nas the greatest possible being suggest that the title\n\u201cGod\u201d is rank-indicating, while the definition of\n\u201cGod\u201d as \u201cruler of the universe\u201d fits well\nwith the view that \u201cGod\u201d is function-indicating and\nexplains why the ordinary class noun, \u201cgod\u201d, might be\ndefined as \u201cruler of some part of the universe or of some sphere\nof human activity\u201d (e.g., Neptune, god of the sea, and Mars, god\nof war).\n\nA third approach (compatible with the first two) is to start from the\nclose connection in meaning between \u201cGod\u201d and\n\u201cworship\u201d. Worship appears to be essential to theistic\nreligions and thus an essential role that any being must play to\nqualify for the title \u201cGod\u201d is to be an appropriate object\nof worship. Indeed, although there is risk of circularity here if\n\u201cworship\u201d is defined in terms of the actions or attitudes\nappropriately directed towards \u201cGod\u201d, it would not be\nobviously mistaken to claim that being worthy of some form of\nreligious worship is not just necessary for divinity but sufficient as\nwell, especially if worthiness of worship entails worthiness of\nallegiance. Of course, forms of worship vary widely from one religion\nto another, so even if worthiness of worship is the sole defining\nfeature of a God, that doesn\u2019t mean that beliefs about what\nthese Gods are like won\u2019t vary widely from one religion to\nanother. In some religions, especially (but not only) certain Western\nmonotheistic ones, worship involves total devotion and unconditional\ncommitment. To be worthy of that sort of worship (if that is even\npossible when the pool of potential worshipers are autonomous\nagents like most adult humans) requires an especially impressive God,\nthough it is controversial whether or not it requires a perfect\none.\n\nIf the ambiguity that results from defining \u201cGod\u201d in terms\nof worthiness of worship is virtuous, then one might be tempted to\nadopt the following account of global atheism and its opposite,\n\u201cversatile theism\u201d:\n\n\nglobal atheism: there are no beings worthy of religious worship.\n\nversatile theism: there exists at least one being that is worthy of\nsome form of religious worship.\n\n\nNotice that on this account of \u201cglobal atheism\u201d, the\natheist only denies the existence of beings that are worthy\nof worship. Thus, not even a global atheist is committed to denying\nthe existence of everything that someone has called a god or\n\u201cGod\u201d. For example, even if the ancient Egyptians\nworshipped the Sun and regarded it as worthy of such worship, the\nglobal atheist need not deny the existence of the Sun. Instead, the\nglobal atheist can claim that the ancient Egyptians were mistaken in\nthinking that the Sun is worthy of religious worship.\n\nSimilarly, consider this passage at the beginning of Section XI of\nDavid Hume\u2019s Natural History of Religion:\n\n\nIf we examine, without prejudice, the ancient heathen mythology, as\ncontained in the poets, we shall not discover in it any such monstrous\nabsurdity, as we may at first be apt to apprehend. Where is the\ndifficulty in conceiving, that the same powers or principles, whatever\nthey were, which formed this visible world, men and animals, produced\nalso a species of intelligent creatures, of more refined substance and\ngreater authority than the rest? That these creatures may be\ncapricious, revengeful, passionate, voluptuous, is easily conceived;\nnor is any circumstance more apt, among ourselves, to engender such\nvices, than the license of absolute authority. And in short, the whole\nmythological system is so natural, that, in the vast variety of\nplanets and world[s], contained in this universe, it seems more\nthan probable, that, somewhere or other, it is really carried into\nexecution. (Hume [1757] 1956: 53, emphasis added)\n\n\nThere is much debate about whether Hume was an atheist or a deist or\nneither, but no one uses this passage to support the view that he was\nactually a polytheist. Perhaps this is because, even if there are\nnatural alien beings that, much like the ancient Greek and Roman gods,\nare far superior in power to humans but quite similar in their moral\nand other psychological qualities, presumably no one, at least\nnowadays, would be tempted to regard them as worthy of religious\nworship.\n\nOne possible flaw in the proposed account of global atheism is that it\nseems to imply overlap between deism and atheism. Of course, it\nwasn\u2019t that long ago when all deists were widely regarded as\natheists. These days, however, the term \u201cdeistic atheist\u201d\nor \u201catheistic deist\u201d has an oxymoronic ring to it. Of\ncourse, not all deists would count as atheists on the proposed\naccount, but some would. For example, consider a deist who believes\nthat, while a supernatural person intentionally designed the universe,\nthat deity did not specifically intend for intelligent life to evolve\nand has no interest whatsoever in the condition or fate of such life.\nSuch a deity would not be worthy of anyone\u2019s worship, especially\nif worthiness of worship entails worthiness of allegiance, and so\nwould arguably not be a (theistic) god, which implies that an atheist\ncould on the proposed definition consistently believe in the existence\nof such a deity. Perhaps, then, \u201cglobal atheism\u201d should be\ndefined as the position that both versatile theism and (versatile)\ndeism are false\u2014that there are no beings worthy of religious\nworship and also no cosmic creators or intelligent designers whether\nworthy of worship (and allegiance) or not. Even this account of\n\u201cglobal atheism\u201d, however, may not be sufficiently\ninclusive since there are religious roles closely associated with the\ntitle \u201cGod\u201d (and thus arguably legitimate notions of God)\nthat could be played by something that is neither an appropriate\nobject of worship nor a cosmic designer or creator.\n4. An Argument for Agnosticism\n\nAccording to one relatively modest form of agnosticism, neither\nversatile theism nor its denial, global atheism, is known to be true.\nRobin Le Poidevin (2010: 76) argues for this position as follows:\n\n\n(1)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that theism or atheism is\nintrinsically more probable than the other. \n\n\n(2)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that the total evidence favors\ntheism or atheism over the other. \n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that theism or atheism is more\nprobable than the other. \n It follows from (3) that\n\n\n(4)Agnosticism\nis true: neither theism nor atheism is known\nto be true. \n\n\n\nLe Poidevin takes \u201ctheism\u201d in its broadest sense to refer\nto the proposition that there exists a being that is the ultimate and\nintentional cause of the universe\u2019s existence and the ultimate\nsource of love and moral knowledge (2010: 52). (He doesn\u2019t use\nthe term \u201cversatile theism\u201d, but this would be his account\nof its meaning.) By the \u201cintrinsic probability\u201d of a\nproposition, he means, roughly, the probability that a proposition has\n\u201cbefore the evidence starts to come in\u201d (2010: 49). This\nprobability depends solely on a priori considerations like\nthe intrinsic features of the content of the proposition in question\n(e.g., the size of that content).\n\nLe Poidevin defends the first premise of this argument by stating\nthat, while intrinsic probability plausibly depends inversely on the\nspecificity of a claim (the less specific the claim, the more ways\nthere are for it to be true and so the more probable it is that it is\ntrue), it is impossible to show that versatile theism is more specific\nor less specific than its denial. This defense appears to be\nincomplete, for Le Poidevin never shows that the intrinsic probability\nof a proposition depends only on its specificity, and there\nare good reasons to believe that this is not the case (see, for\nexample, Swinburne 2001: 80\u2013102). Le Poidevin could respond,\nhowever, that specificity is the only uncontroversial criterion of\nintrinsic probability, and this lack of consensus on other criteria is\nall that is needed to adequately defend premise\n (1).\n\nOne way to defend the second premise is to review the relevant\nevidence and argue that it is ambiguous (Le Poidevin 2010: chapter 4;\nand Draper 2002). Another way is to point out that atheism, which is\njust the proposition that theism is false, is compatible with a\nvariety of very different hypotheses, and these hypotheses vary widely\nin how well they account for the total evidence. Thus, to assess how\nwell atheism accounts for the total evidence, one would have to\ncalculate a weighted average of how well these different atheistic\nhypotheses account for the total evidence, where the weights would be\nthe different intrinsic probabilities of each of these atheistic\nhypotheses. This task seems prohibitively difficult (Draper 2016) and\nin any case has not been attempted, which supports the claim that\nthere is no firm basis upon which to judge whether the total evidence\nsupports theism or atheism.\n\nSo-called \u201cReformed epistemologists\u201d (e.g., Plantinga\n2000) might challenge the second premise of the argument on the\ngrounds that many beliefs about God, like many beliefs about the past,\nare \u201cproperly basic\u201d\u2014a result of the functioning of\na basic cognitive faculty called the \u201csensus\ndivinitatis\u201d\u2014and so are, in effect, a part of the\ntotal evidence with respect to which the probability of any statement\ndepends. The agnostic, however, might reply that this sense of the\ndivine, unlike memory, operates at most sporadically and far from\nuniversally. Also, unlike other basic cognitive faculties, it can\neasily be resisted, and the existence of the beliefs it is supposed to\nproduce can easily be explained without supposing that the faculty\nexists at all. Thus, the analogy to memory is weak. Therefore, in the\nabsence of some firmer basis upon which to judge that beliefs about\nGod are properly a part of the foundation of some theists\u2019\nbelief systems, premise\n (2)\n stands.\n\nOf course, even if the two premises of Le Poidevin\u2019s argument\nare true, it doesn\u2019t follow that the argument is a good one. For\nthe argument also contains two inferences (from steps\n 1\n and\n 2\n to\n step 3\n and from step 3 to\n step 4),\n neither of which is obviously correct. Concerning the first\ninference, suppose, for example, that even though there is no firm\nbasis upon which to judge which of theism and atheism is intrinsically\nmore probable (that is, Le Poidevin\u2019s first premise is true),\nthere is firm basis upon which to judge that theism is not many times\nmore probable intrinsically than some specific version of atheism,\nsay, reductive physicalism. And suppose that, even though there is no\nfirm basis upon which to judge which of theism and atheism is favored\nby the total evidence (that is, Le Poidevin\u2019s second premise is\ntrue), there is firm basis upon which to judge that the total evidence\nvery strongly favors reductive physicalism over theism (in the sense\nthat it is antecedently very many times more probable given reductive\nphysicalism than it is given theism). Then it follows that both of Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises are true and yet (3) is false: there is a\nfirm basis (that includes the odds version of Bayes\u2019 theorem\napplied to theism and reductive physicalism instead of to theism and\natheism) to judge that reductive physicalism is more probable or even\nmany times more probable than theism and hence that theism is probably\nor even very probably false. Arguably, no similar strategy could be\nused to show that theism is probably true in spite of Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises both being true. So it may be that Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises, if adequately supported, establish that\ntheistic gnosticism is false (that is, that either agnosticism or\natheistic gnosticism is true) even if they don\u2019t establish that\nagnosticism is true.\n5. An Argument for Global Atheism?\n\nAlmost all well-known arguments for atheism are arguments for a\nparticular version of local atheism. One possible exception to this\nrule is an argument recently made popular by some New Atheists,\nalthough it was not invented by them. Gary Gutting (2013) calls this\nargument the \u201cno arguments argument\u201d for atheism:\n\n\n(1)The\nabsence of good reasons to believe that God exists is itself a good\nreason to believe that God does not exist. \n\n\n(2)There is\nno good reason to believe that God exists. \n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)There is\ngood reason to believe that God does not exist. \n\n\n\nNotice the obvious relevance of this argument to agnosticism.\nAccording to one prominent member of the agnosticism family, we have\nno good reason to believe that God exists and no good reason to\nbelieve that God does not exist. Clearly, if the first premise of this\nargument is true, then this version of agnosticism must be false.\n\nCan the no arguments argument be construed as an argument for global\natheism? One might object that it is not, strictly speaking, an\nargument for any sort of atheism since its conclusion is not that\natheism is true but instead that there is good reason to believe that\natheism is true. But that is just a quibble. Ultimately, whether this\nargument can be used to defend global atheism depends on how its first\npremise is defended.\n\nThe usual way of defending it is to derive it from some general\nprinciple according to which lacking grounds for claims of a certain\nsort is good reason to reject those claims. The restriction of this\nprinciple to claims \u201cof a certain sort\u201d is crucial, since\nthe principle that the absence of grounds for a claim is in all cases\na good reason to believe that the claim is false is rather obviously\nfalse. One might, for example, lack grounds for believing that the\nnext time one flips a coin it will come up heads, but that is not a\ngood reason to believe that it won\u2019t come up heads.\n\nA more promising approach restricts the principle to existence claims,\nthereby turning it into a version of Ockham\u2019s razor. According\nto this version of the principle, the absence of grounds supporting a\npositive existential statement (like \u201cGod\nexists\u201d\u2014however \u201cGod\u201d is understood) is a good\nreason to believe that the statement is false (McLaughlin 1984). One\nobjection to this principle is that not every sort of thing is such\nthat, if it existed, then we would likely have good reason to believe\nthat it exists. Consider, for example, intelligent life in distant\ngalaxies (cf. Morris 1985).\n\nPerhaps, however, an even more narrowly restricted principle would do\nthe trick: whenever the assumption that a positive existential claim\nis true would lead one to expect to have grounds for its truth, the\nabsence of such grounds is a good reason to believe that the claim is\nfalse. It might then be argued that (i) a God would be likely to\nprovide us with convincing evidence of Her existence and so (ii) the\nabsence of such evidence is a good reason to believe that God does not\nexist. This transforms the no arguments argument into an argument from\ndivine hiddenness. It also transforms it into at best an argument for\nlocal atheism, since even if the God of, say, classical theism would\nnot hide, not all legitimate God-concepts are such that a being\ninstantiating that concept would be likely to provide us with\nconvincing evidence of its existence.\n6. Two Arguments for Local Atheism\n6.1 How to Argue for Local Atheism\n\nThe sort of God in whose non-existence philosophers seem most\ninterested is the eternal, non-physical, omnipotent, omniscient, and\nomnibenevolent (i.e., morally perfect) creator-God worshipped by many\ntheologically orthodox Muslims, Jews, and Christians. Let\u2019s call\nthe proposition that a God of this sort exists\n\u201comni-theism\u201d. One interesting question, then, is how best\nto argue for atheism understood locally as the proposition that\nomni-theism is false.\n\nIt is often claimed that a good argument for atheism is impossible\nbecause, while it is at least possible to prove that something of a\ncertain sort exists, it is impossible to prove that nothing of that\nsort exists. One reason to reject this claim is that the descriptions\nof some kinds of objects are self-contradictory. For example, we can\nprove that no circular square exists because such an object would have\nto be both circular and non-circular, which is impossible. Thus, one\nway to argue for the nonexistence of the God of omni-theism (or\n\u201comni-God\u201d for short) is to argue that such a God is an\nimpossible object like a circular square.\n\nMany attempts have been made to construct such arguments. For example,\nit has been claimed that an omnibenevolent being would be impeccable\nand so incapable of wrongdoing, while an omnipotent being would be\nquite capable of doing things that would be wrong to do. There are,\nhowever, sophisticated and plausible replies to arguments like these.\nMore importantly, even if such an argument succeeded, omni-theists\ncould plausibly claim that, by \u201comnipotent\u201d, they mean,\nnot maximally powerful, but optimally powerful, where the optimal\ndegree of power may not be maximal if maximal power rules out\npossessing the optimal degree of some other perfection like moral\ngoodness.\n\nSimilar problems face attempts to show that omni-theism must be false\nbecause it is incompatible with certain known facts about the world.\nSuch arguments typically depend on detailed and contested\ninterpretations of divine attributes like omnibenevolence.\n\nA very different approach is based on the idea that disproof need not\nbe demonstrative. The goal of this approach is to show that the\nexistence of an omni-God is so improbable that confident belief in the\nnon-existence of such a God is justified. Two such arguments are\ndiscussed in detail below: the \u201clow priors argument\u201d and\nthe \u201cdecisive evidence argument\u201d. Each of these arguments\nemploys the same specific strategy, which is to argue that some\nalternative hypothesis to omni-theism is many times more probable than\nomni-theism. This doesn\u2019t imply that the alternative hypothesis\nis probably true, but it does imply that omni-theism is very probably\nfalse. In the case of the second argument, the alternative hypothesis\n(aesthetic deism) is arguably a form of theism, and even in the case\nof the first argument it is arguable that the alternative hypothesis\n(source physicalism) is compatible with some forms of theism (in\nparticular ones in which God is an emergent entity). This is not a\nproblem for either argument, however, precisely because both are\narguments for local atheism instead of global atheism.\n6.2 The Low Priors Argument\n\nThe basic idea behind the low priors argument is that, even if the\nagnostic is right that, when it comes to God\u2019s existence, the\nevidence is ambiguous or absent altogether, what follows is not that\ntheism has a middling probability all things considered, but instead\nthat theism is very probably false. This is said to follow because\ntheism starts out with a very low probability before taking into\naccount any evidence. (\u201cEvidence\u201d in this context refers\nto factors extrinsic to a hypothesis that raise or lower its\nprobability.) Since ambiguous or absent evidence has no effect on that\nprior or intrinsic probability, the posterior or all-things-considered\nprobability of theism is also very low. If, however, theism is very\nprobably false, then atheism must be very probably true and this\nimplies (according to the defender of the argument) that atheistic\nbelief is justified. (This last alleged implication is examined in\nsection 7.)\n\nThis sort of argument is very relevant to the issue of which of\natheism and theism is the appropriate \u201cdefault\u201d position.\nIf theism has a sufficiently low intrinsic probability, then atheism\nis arguably the correct default position in the sense that ambiguous\nor absent evidence will justify, not suspending judgment on the issue\nof God\u2019s existence, but instead believing that God does not\nexist. This is why Le Poidevin\u2019s argument for agnosticism\nincludes, not just a premise asserting that the relevant evidence is\nambiguous, but also one asserting that, at least in the case of\nversatile theism, we are in the dark when it comes to the issue of\nwhich of theism and atheism has a higher intrinsic probability.\nUnfortunately, much discussion of the issue of which position is the\ncorrect \u201cdefault position\u201d or of who has the \u201cburden\nof proof\u201d gets sidetracked by bad analogies to Santa Claus,\nflying spaghetti monsters, and Bertrand Russell\u2019s ([1952] 1997)\nfamous china teapot in elliptical orbit around the sun (see Garvey\n2010 and van Inwagen 2012 for criticism of some of these analogies).\nThe low priors argument implicitly addresses this important issue in a\nmuch more sophisticated and promising way.\n\nIn the version of the low priors argument formulated below, the basic\napproach described above is improved by comparing omni-theism, not\nsimply to its denial, but instead to a more specific atheistic\nhypothesis called \u201csource physicalism\u201d. Unlike ontological\nphysicalism, source physicalism is a claim about the source of mental\nentities, not about their nature. Source physicalists, whether they\nare ontological physicalists or ontological dualists, believe that the\nphysical world existed before the mental world and caused the mental\nworld to come into existence, which implies that all mental entities\nare causally dependent on physical entities. Further, even if they are\nontological dualists, source physicalists need not claim that mental\nentities never cause physical entities or other mental entities, but\nthey must claim that there would be no mental entities were it not for\nthe prior existence (and causal powers) of one or more physical\nentities. The argument proceeds as follows:\n\n\n(1)The\ntotal evidence does not favor omni-theism over source\nphysicalism.\n\n\n(2)Source\nphysicalism is many times more probable intrinsically than\nomni-theism.\n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)Source\nphysicalism is many times more probable than omni-theism.\n It follows from (3) that\n\n\n(4)Omni-theism\nis very probably false.\n It follows from (4) that\n\n\n(5)Atheism\n(understood here as the denial of omni-theism) is very probably\ntrue.\n\n\n\nOnly the argument\u2019s two premises\u2014steps (1) and\n(2)\u2014are controversial. The other steps in the argument all\nclearly follow from previous steps.\n\nA thorough examination of the arguments for and against premise (1) is\nobviously impossible here, but it is worth mentioning that a defense\nof this premise need not claim that the known facts typically thought\nby natural theologians to favor omni-theism over competing hypotheses\nlike source physicalism have no force. Instead, it could be claimed\nthat whatever force they have is offset at least to some significant\ndegree by more specific facts favoring source physicalism over\nomni-theism. Natural theologians routinely ignore these more specific\nfacts and thus appear to commit what might be called \u201cthe\nfallacy of understated evidence\u201d. More precisely, the point is\nthis. Even when natural theologians successfully identify some general\nfact about a topic that is more probable given omni-theism than given\nsource physicalism, they ignore other more specific facts about that\nsame topic, facts that, given the general fact, appear to be\nsignificantly more probable given source physicalism than given\nomni-theism.\n\nFor example, even if omni-theism is supported by the general fact that\nthe universe is complex, one should not ignore the more specific fact,\ndiscovered by scientists, that underlying this complexity at the level\nat which we experience the universe, is a much simpler early universe\nfrom which this complexity arose, and also a much simpler contemporary\nuniverse at the micro-level, one consisting of a relatively small\nnumber of different kinds of particles all of which exist in one of a\nrelatively small number of different states. In short, it is important\nto take into account, not just the general fact that the universe that\nwe directly experience with our senses is extremely complex, but also\nthe more specific fact that two sorts of hidden simplicity within the\nuniverse can explain that complexity. Given that a complex universe\nexists, this more specific fact is exactly what one would expect on\nsource physicalism, because, as the best natural theologians (e.g.,\nSwinburne 2004) say, the complexity of the universe cries out for\nexplanation in terms of something simpler. There is, however, no\nreason at all to expect this more specific fact on omni-theism since,\nif those same natural theologians are correct, then a simple God\nprovides a simple explanation for the observed complexity of the\nuniverse whether or not that complexity is also explained by any\nsimpler mediate physical causes.\n\nAnother example concerns consciousness. Its existence really does seem\nto be more likely given omni-theism than given source physicalism (and\nthus to raise the ratio of the probability of omni-theism to the\nprobability of source physicalism). But we know a lot more about\nconsciousness than just that it exists. We also know, thanks in part\nto the relatively new discipline of neuroscience, that conscious\nstates in general and even the very integrity of our personalities,\nnot to mention the apparent unity of the self, are dependent to a very\nhigh degree on physical events occurring in the brain. Given the\ngeneral fact that consciousness exists, we have reason on source\nphysicalism that we do not have on theism to expect these more\nspecific facts. Given theism, it would not be surprising at all if our\nminds were more independent of the brain than they in fact are. After\nall, if omni-theism is true, then at least one mind, God\u2019s, does\nnot depend at all on anything physical. Thus, when the available\nevidence about consciousness is fully stated, it is far from clear\nthat it significantly favors omni-theism.\n\nSimilar problems threaten to undermine appeals to\nfine-tuning\u2014that is, appeals to the fact that a number of\napparently independent physical parameters have values that, while not\nfixed by current physical theory, nevertheless happen to fall within a\nrelatively narrow \u201clife-permitting\u201d range assuming no\nchanges to other parameters. Arguably, given that fine-tuning is\nrequired for intelligent life and that an omni-God has reason to\ncreate intelligent life, we have more reason to expect fine-tuning on\nomni-theism than on source physicalism. Given such fine-tuning,\nhowever, it is far more surprising on omni-theism than on source\nphysicalism that our universe is not teeming with intelligent life and\nthat the most impressive intelligent organisms we know to exist are\nmerely human: self-centered and aggressive primates who far too often\nkill, rape, and torture each other.\n\nIn fairness to omni-theism, however, most of those humans are moral\nagents and many have religious experiences apparently of God. The\nproblem is that, while the existence of moral agents is\n\u201cpredicted\u201d by omni-theism better than by source\nphysicalism, it is also true that, given their existence, the variety\nand frequency of easily avoidable conditions that promote morally bad\nbehavior and that severely limit the freedom, agency, and autonomy of\ncountless human beings are much more likely on source physicalism. And\nwhile religious experiences apparently of God are no doubt more to be\nexpected if an omni-God exists than if human beings are the product of\nblind physical forces, it is also true that, given that such\nexperiences do occur, various facts about their distribution that\nshould be surprising to theists are exactly what one would expect on\nsource physicalism, such as the fact that many people never have them\nand the fact that those who do have them almost always have either a\nprior belief in God or extensive exposure to a theistic religion.\n\nIt seems, then, that when it comes to evidence favoring omni-theism\nover source physicalism, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.\nFurther, when combined with the fact that what we know about the level\nof well-being of sentient beings and the extent of their suffering is\narguably vastly more probable on source physicalism than on theism, a\nvery strong though admittedly controversial case for premise\n (1)\n can be made.\n\nWhat about premise\n (2)?\n Again, a serious case can be made for its truth. Such a case first\ncompares source physicalism, not to omni-theism, but to its opposite,\nsource idealism. Source idealists believe that the mental world\nexisted before the physical world and caused the physical world to\ncome into existence. This view is consistent with both ontological\nidealism and ontological dualism, and also with physical entities\nhaving both physical and mental effects. It entails, however, that all\nphysical entities are, ultimately, causally dependent on one or more\nmental entities, and so is not consistent with ontological\nphysicalism. The symmetry of source physicalism and source idealism is\na good pro tanto reason to believe they are equally probable\nintrinsically. They are equally specific, they have the same\nontological commitments, neither can be formulated more elegantly than\nthe other, and each appears to be equally coherent and equally\nintelligible. They differ on the issue of what is causally dependent\non what, but if Hume is right and causal dependence relations can only\nbe discovered by observation and not a priori, then that\nwon\u2019t affect the intrinsic probabilities of the two\nhypotheses.\n\nOmni-theism, however, is a very specific version of source idealism;\nit entails that source idealism is true but goes far beyond source\nidealism by making a number of very specific claims about the sort of\n\u201cmental world\u201d that produced the physical world. For\nexample, it adds the claim that a single mind created the physical\nuniverse and that this mind is not just powerful but specifically\nomnipotent and not just knowledgeable but specifically omniscient. In\naddition, it presupposes a number of controversial metaphysical and\nmeta-ethical claims by asserting in addition that this being is both\neternal and objectively morally perfect. If any of these specific\nclaims and presuppositions is false, then omni-theism is false. Thus,\nomni-theism is a very specific and thus intrinsically very risky form\nof source idealism, and thus is many times less probable intrinsically\nthan source idealism. Therefore, if, as argued above, source\nphysicalism and source idealism are equally probable intrinsically,\nthen it follows that premise\n (2)\n is true: source physicalism is many times more probable intrinsically\nthan omni-theism.\n6.3 The Decisive Evidence Argument\n\nNotice that the general strategy of the particular version of the low\npriors argument discussed above is to find an alternative to\nomni-theism that is much less specific than omni-theism (and\npartly for that reason much more probable intrinsically),\nwhile at the same time having enough content of the right sort to fit\nthe totality of the relevant data at least as well as theism does. In\nother words, the goal is to find a runner like source physicalism that\nbegins the race with a large head start and thus wins by a large\nmargin because it runs the race for supporting evidence and thus for\nprobability at roughly the same speed as omni-theism does. This\ndoesn\u2019t show that source physicalism is probable (a \u201clarge\nmargin\u201d in this context means a large ratio of one probability\nto another, not a large difference between the probabilities), because\nthere may be even better runners in the race; it does, however, show\nthat omni-theism loses the race by a large margin and thus is very\nprobably false.\n\nAn alternative strategy is to find a runner that begins the race tied\nwith omni-theism, but runs the race for evidential support much faster\nthan omni-theism does, thus once again winning the race by a margin\nthat is sufficiently large for the rest of the argument to go through.\nA good name for an argument pursuing this second strategy is the\n\u201cdecisive evidence argument\u201d. The choice of alternative\nhypothesis is crucial here just as it was in the low priors argument.\nOne promising choice is \u201caesthetic deism\u201d. (Another would\nbe a more detailed version of source physicalism that, unlike source\nphysicalism in general, makes the relevant data antecedently much more\nprobable than theism does.) In order to help ensure that omni-theism\nand aesthetic deism begin the race at the same starting\nline\u2014that is, have the same intrinsic\nprobability\u2014\u201caesthetic deism\u201d is best defined in\nsuch a way that it is almost identical to omni-theism. Thus, it may be\nstipulated that, like omni-theism, aesthetic deism implies that an\neternal, non-physical, omnipotent, and omniscient being created the\nphysical world. The only difference, then, between the God of\nomni-theism and the deity of aesthetic deism is what motivates them.\nAn omni-theistic God would be morally perfect and so strongly\nmotivated by considerations of the well-being of sentient creatures.\nAn aesthetic deistic God, on the other hand, would prioritize\naesthetic goods over moral ones. While such a being would want a\nbeautiful universe, perhaps the best metaphor here is not that of a\ncosmic artist, but instead that of a cosmic playwright: an\nauthor of nature who wants above all to write an interesting\nstory.\n\nAs everyone knows, good stories never begin with the line \u201cand\nthey lived happily ever after\u201d, and that line is the last line\nof any story that contains it. Further, containing such a line is\nhardly necessary for a story to be good. If aesthetic deism is true,\nthen it may very well be true that, \u201call the world\u2019s a\nstage, and all the men and women merely players\u201d\n(emphasis added). In any case, the hypothesis of aesthetic deism makes\n\u201cpredictions\u201d about the condition of sentient beings in\nthe world that are very different from the ones that the hypothesis of\nomni-theism makes. After all, what makes a good story good is often\nsome intense struggle between good and evil, and all good stories\ncontain some mixture of benefit and harm. This suggests that the\nobserved mixture of good and evil in our world decisively favors\naesthetic deism over omni-theism. And if that\u2019s right, then\naesthetic deism pulls far ahead of omni-theism in the race for\nprobability, thereby proving that omni-theism is very improbable.\n\nHere is one possible formulation of this argument:\n\n\n(1)Aesthetic\ndeism is at least as probable intrinsically as\nomni-theism.\n\n\n(2)The\ntotal evidence excluding \u201cthe data of good and evil\u201d does\nnot favor omni-theism over aesthetic deism.\n\n\n(3)Given\nthe total evidence excluding the data of good and evil, the data of\ngood and evil strongly favor aesthetic deism over\nomni-theism.\n It follows from (1), (2), and (3) that\n\n\n(4)Aesthetic\ndeism is many times more probable than\nomni-theism.\n It follows from (4) that\n\n\n(5)Omni-theism\nis very probably false.\n It follows from (5) that\n\n\n(6)Atheism\n(understood here as the denial of omni-theism) is very probably\ntrue.\n\n\n\nSteps (4)\u2013(6) of this argument are the same as steps\n(3)\u2013(5) of the low priors argument except that \u201csource\nphysicalism\u201d in step (3) of the low priors argument is replaced\nby \u201caesthetic deism\u201d in step (4) of the decisive evidence\nargument. This makes no difference as far as the inference from step\n(4) to step (5) is concerned. That inference, like the inferences from\nsteps (1)\u2013(3) to step (4) and from step (5) to step (6), is\nclearly correct. The key question, then, is whether premises (1), (2),\nand (3) are all true.\n\nIn spite of the nearly complete overlap between omni-theism and\naesthetic deism, Richard Swinburne (2004: 96\u2013109) would\nchallenge premise\n (1)\n on the grounds that aesthetic deism, unlike omni-theism, must posit a\nbad desire to account for why the deity does not do what is morally\nbest. Omni-theism need not do this, according to Swinburne, because\nwhat is morally best just is what is overall best, and thus an\nomniscient being will of necessity do what is morally best so long as\nit has no desires other than the desires it has simply by virtue of\nknowing what the best thing to do is in any given situation. This\nchallenge depends, however, on a highly questionable motivational\nintellectualism: it succeeds only if merely believing that an action\nis good entails a desire to do it. On most theories of motivation,\nthere is a logical gap between the intellect and desire. If such a gap\nexists, then it would seem that omni-theism is no more probable\nintrinsically than aesthetic deism.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a plausible challenge to premise\n (2)\n because, at least when it comes to the usual evidence taken to favor\ntheism over competing hypotheses like naturalism, aesthetic deism\naccounts for that evidence at least as well as omni-theism does. For\nexample, a deity interested in good narrative would want a world that\nis complex and yet ordered, that contains beauty, consciousness,\nintelligence, and moral agency. Perhaps there is more reason to expect\nthe existence of libertarian free will on omni-theism than on\naesthetic deism; but unless one starts from the truth of omni-theism,\nthere seems to be little reason to believe that we have such freedom.\nAnd even if one takes seriously introspective or other non-theological\nevidence for libertarian free will, it is not difficult to construct a\n\u201cde-odicy\u201d here: a good explanation in terms of aesthetic\ndeism either of the existence of libertarian free will or of why there\nis apparently strong but ultimately misleading evidence for its\nexistence. For example, if open theists are right that not even an\nomniscient being can know with certainty what (libertarian) free\nchoices will be made in the future, then aesthetic deism could account\nfor libertarian free will and other sorts of indeterminacy by claiming\nthat a story with genuine surprises is better than one that is\ncompletely predictable. Alternatively, what might be important for the\nstory is only that the characters think they have free will, not that\nthey really have it.\n\nFinally, there is premise\n (3),\n which asserts that the data of good and evil decisively favors\naesthetic deism over theism. In this context, the \u201cdata of good\nand evil\u201d include everything we know about how sentient beings,\nincluding humans, are benefitted or harmed. A full discussion of this\npremise is not possible here, but recognition of its plausibility\nappears to be as old as the problem of evil itself. Consider, for\nexample, the Book of Job, whose protagonist, a righteous man who\nsuffers horrifically, accuses God of lacking sufficient commitment to\nthe moral value of justice. The vast majority of commentators agree\nthat God does not directly respond to Job\u2019s charge. Instead,\nspeaking out of the whirlwind, He describes His design of the cosmos\nand of the animal kingdom in a way clearly intended to emphasize His\npower and the grandeur of His creation. Were it not for theological\nworries about God\u2019s moral perfection, the most natural\ninterpretation of this part of the story would be either that God\nagrees with Job\u2019s charge that He is unjust or that God denies\nthat Job can sensibly apply terms like \u201cjust\u201d and\n\u201cunjust\u201d to Him because He and Job are not members of any\nshared moral community (Morriston forthcoming; for an opposing view,\nsee Stump 2010: chapter 9). This is why Job\u2019s first response to\nGod\u2019s speech (before capitulating in his second response) is\njust to refuse to repeat his (unanswered) accusation. On this\ninterpretation, the creator that confronts Job is not the God he\nexpected and definitely not the God of omni-theism, but rather a being\nmuch more like the deity of aesthetic deism.\n\nThose who claim that a God might allow evil because it is the\ninevitable result of the universe being governed by laws of nature\nalso lend support, though unintentionally, to the idea that, if there\nis an author of nature, then that being is more likely motivated by\naesthetic concerns than moral ones. For example, it may be that\nproducing a universe governed by a few laws expressible as elegant\nmathematical equations is an impressive accomplishment, not just\nbecause of the wisdom and power required for such a task, but also\nbecause of the aesthetic value of such a universe. That value may very\nwell depend, however, on the creator\u2019s choosing not to intervene\nregularly in nature to protect His creatures from harm.\n\nMuch of the aesthetic value of the animal kingdom may also depend on\nits being the result of a long evolutionary process driven by\nmechanisms like natural selection. As Darwin (1859) famously said in\nthe last lines of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural\nSelection,\n\n\nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,\nhaving been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and\nthat, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed\nlaw of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most\nbeautiful and wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\n\n\nUnfortunately, such a process, if it is to produce sentient life, may\nalso entail much suffering and countless early deaths. One\nquestionable assumption of some natural order theodicists is to think\nthat such connections between aesthetic goods and suffering provide a\nmoral justification for God\u2019s allowing horrific\nsuffering. It is arguably far more plausible that in such a scenario\nthe value of preventing horrendous suffering would, from a moral point\nof view, far outweigh the value of regularity, sublimity, and\nnarrative. If so, then a morally perfect God would not trade\nthe former for the latter though a deity motivated primarily by\naesthetic reasons no doubt would.\n\nTo summarize, nearly everyone agrees that the world contains both\ngoods and evils. Pleasure and pain, love and hate, achievement and\nfailure, flourishing and languishing, and virtue and vice all exist in\ngreat abundance. In spite of that, some see signs of cosmic teleology.\nThose who defend the version of the decisive evidence argument stated\nabove need not deny the teleology. They do need to show that it is far\neasier to make sense of the \u201cstrange mixture of good and ill,\nwhich appears in life\u201d (Hume Dialogues, XI, 14) when\nthat teleology is interpreted as amoral instead of as moral (cf.\nMulgan 2015 and Murphy 2017) and in particular when it is interpreted\nas directed towards aesthetic ends instead of towards moral ends.\n7. An Argument against Agnosticism\n\nThe topic in\n section 4\n was Le Poidevin\u2019s argument for the truth of a modest form of\nagnosticism. In this section, an argument for the falsity of a more\nambitious form of agnosticism will be examined. Because the sort of\nagnosticism addressed in this section is more ambitious than the sort\ndefended by Le Poidevin, it is conceivable that both arguments succeed\nin establishing their conclusions.\n\nIn Le Poidevin\u2019s argument, the term \u201cagnosticism\u201d\nrefers to the position that neither versatile theism nor global\natheism is known to be true. In this section,\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d refers to the position that neither the\nbelief that omni-theism is true nor the belief that it is false is\nrationally permissible. This form of agnosticism is more ambitious\nbecause knowledge is stronger (in the logical sense) than rational\npermissibility: it can be rationally permissible to believe\npropositions that are not known to be true, but a proposition cannot\nbe known to be true by someone who is not rationally permitted to\nbelieve it. Thus, an appropriate name for this form of agnosticism is\n\u201cstrong agnosticism\u201d.\n\nAnother difference concerns the object of the two forms of\nagnosticism. The agnosticism in Le Poidevin\u2019s argument concerned\nversatile theism versus global atheism. In this section, the target is\nomni-theism versus the local atheistic position that omni-theism is\nfalse. The previous section focused on two arguments for the\nconclusion that this form of local atheism is very probably true. In\nthis section, the question is whether or not that conclusion, if\nestablished, could ground a successful argument against strong\nagnosticism.\n\nSuch an argument can be formulated as follows:\n\n\n(1)Atheism\n(understood here as the denial of omni-theism) is very probably\ntrue.\n\n\n(2)If atheism\nis very probably true, then atheistic belief is rationally\npermissible.\n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)Atheistic\nbelief is rationally permissible.\n\n\n(4)If strong\nagnosticism (about omni-theism) is true (that is, if withholding\njudgment about the truth or falsity of omni-theism is rationally\nrequired), then atheistic belief is not rationally\npermissible.\n It follows from (3) and (4) that\n\n\n(5)Strong\nagnosticism (about omni-theism) is false.\n\n\n\nPremise (1)\n was defended in\n section 6,\n premise (4) is true by the definition of \u201cstrong\nagnosticism\u201d, and steps\n (3)\n and\n (5)\n follow from earlier steps by modus ponens and modus\ntollens, respectively. This leaves premise\n (2),\n the premise that, if atheism is very probably true, then atheistic\nbelief is rationally permissible.\n\nOne might attempt to defend this premise by claiming that the\nprobabilities in\n premise (2)\n are rational credences and hence the truth of the so-called Lockean\nthesis (Foley 1992) justifies (2):\n\n\nIt is rational for a person S to believe a proposition\nP if and only if it is rational for S\u2019s\ncredence in P to be sufficiently high to make\nS\u2019s attitude towards P one of belief.\n\n\nThe Lockean thesis, however, is itself in need of justification.\nFortunately, though, nothing so strong as the Lockean thesis is needed\nto defend\n premise (2).\n For one thing, all the defender of (2) needs is an \u201cif\u201d,\nnot an \u201cif and only if\u201d. Also, the defender of (2) need\nnot equate, as the Lockean thesis does, the attitude of belief with\nhaving a high credence. Thus, all that is required is the following\nmore modest thesis (call it \u201cT\u201d):\n\n(T) If it is rationally\npermissible for S\u2019s credence in a proposition\nP to be (very) high, then it is rationally permissible for\nS to believe P. \n\n\nEven this more modest thesis, however, is controversial, because\nadopting it commits one to the position that rational (i.e.,\nrationally permissible) belief is not closed under conjunction. In\nother words, it commits one to the position that it is possible for\neach of a number of beliefs to be rational even though the additional\nbelief that those beliefs are all true is not rational.\n\nTo see why this is so, imagine that a million lottery tickets have\nbeen sold. Each player purchased only a single ticket, and exactly one\nof the players is certain to win. Now imagine further that an informed\nobserver has a distinct belief about each of the million individual\nplayers that that particular player will lose. According to thesis\nT, each of those million beliefs is rational. For example, if\nSue is one of the players, then according to T the\nobserver\u2019s belief that Sue will lose is rational because it is\nrational for the observer to have a (very) high credence in the\nproposition that Sue will lose. Since, however, it is certain that\nsomeone will win, it is also rational for the observer to believe that\nsome player will win. It is not rational, however, to have\ncontradictory beliefs, so it is not rational for the observer to\nbelieve that no player will win. This implies, however, that rational\nbelief is not closed under conjunction, for the proposition that no\nplayer will win just is the conjunction of all of the propositions\nthat say of some individual player that they will lose.\n\nDefenders of\n premise (2)\n will claim, very plausibly, that the implication of T that\nrational belief is not closed under conjunction is completely\ninnocuous. Isn\u2019t it obvious, for example, that it would not be\nrational for a fallible human being to believe that all of their many\nbeliefs are true, even if each of those beliefs were rational? Others\n(e.g., Oppy 1994: 151), however, regard the conclusion that rational\nbelief is not closed under conjunction as unacceptable and will for\nthat reason reject premise (2). So even if it can be shown that\nomni-theism is very probably false, it still won\u2019t be obvious to\neveryone that it is rationally permissible to be a local atheist about\nomni-theism and thus it still won\u2019t be obvious to everyone that\nstrong agnosticism about omni-theism is false.\n",
