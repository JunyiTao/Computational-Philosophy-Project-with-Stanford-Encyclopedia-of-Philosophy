    "main_text": "Works || The Shape and Character of the Silloi\n3. Evidence of Other Philosophical Activity\n\nAs was noted earlier, the surviving fragments of the Indalmoi\ninclude a line that is plausibly taken to point to the importance, for\nthe Pyrrhonist, of the appearances of things as a basis for decision\nand action. Whether or not it is this theme that is alluded to in the\ntitle Indalmoi itself (see above, in Section 2, Works), it\nlooks as if this is a topic to which Timon returned in several works.\nThe sole reference to Timon\u2019s On the Senses is a\nquotation that reads \u201cthat honey is sweet I do not posit, but\nthat it appears so I agree\u201d (Diogenes Laertius 9.105). Both the\ncontext in Diogenes, and the obvious implication of the words\nthemselves, suggest that here too Timon is making the same point: for\npractical purposes it is both possible and legitimate for Pyrrhonists\nto let themselves be guided by appearances of things, even while they\nrigorously refrain from attributing definite characteristics to those\nthings in their real nature. On this matter Timon\u2019s influence on\nthe Pyrrhonist tradition seems to have been far-reaching; the same\npoint and the same example (and even the notion of\n\u201cagreeing\u201d that things appear a certain way, although the\nGreek words are not identical) reappear in the opening pages of Sextus\nEmpiricus\u2019 Outlines of Pyrrhonism (1.20).\n\nThe same passage of Diogenes Laertius includes a reference to another\nremark of Timon, this time from the Pytho; according to\nDiogenes, Timon said in this work that he had not \u201cgone outside\nsun\u00eatheia.\u201d Sun\u00eatheia can mean\nseveral things. But the meaning that best fits the context, and the\none that tends to occur in epistemological contexts in general, is\n\u2018ordinary experience.\u2019 Diogenes is commenting on the\nPyrrhonists\u2019 response to the common objection that their\nphilosophy amounts to a rejection of life itself. The Pyrrhonists, he\nsays, reply that this is not so, since they readily accept that things\nappear in their many familiar ways; it is only at the level of the\nunderlying nature of things that they avoid definite pronouncements.\nThe comment from the Pytho is then cited as an instance of\nthis kind of reply. Timon, then, is apparently saying that, in\nallowing the appearances to guide his behavior, he is not doing away\nwith our everyday experience of things.\n\nThe fact that Timon needs to make this statement suggests that the\naccusation regularly leveled against the Pyrrhonists (as well as the\nskeptical Academy), that it would be impossible to live in accordance\nwith their philosophy, goes back to the earliest phase of the\ntradition. It was perhaps in response to this objection that Timon\ndeveloped this position on the practical value of the appearances.\nWhile we cannot exclude the possibility that it was already an element\nin Pyrrho\u2019s thinking, there is no evidence linking Pyrrho with\nany remarks about appearances; this may, then, be Timon\u2019s own\ncontribution, prompted by hostile criticism.\n\nThere are other instances where it is not clear whether Timon is\nsimply reproducing Pyrrho\u2019s outlook or adding creatively to it.\nFor example, Diogenes reports that in the Pytho Timon offered\na gloss on the phrase \u2018no more\u2019 (ouden mallon),\nnamely, \u2018determining nothing and withholding assent\u2019\n(9.76). The phrase ouden mallon became a stock Pyrrhonist\nexpression, and occurs several times in connection with Pyrrho\u2019s\nown views. But is Timon here giving his own distinctive explanation of\nthe significance of this phrase? Given the meager evidence available,\nwe cannot hope to settle the matter. As noted earlier, the passage of\nAristocles that expounds the early Pyrrhonist position is also\ncontroversial in this respect. While the passage\u00a0as a whole has\ngenerally been taken to be giving us the philosophy of\nPyrrho\u00a0(via the medium of a summary by Timon), it has also been\nsuggested\u00a0that large parts of the position outlined here are in\nfact additions by Timon to a core idea of Pyrrho\u2019s (see the\nentry on Pyrrho for details, also Brunschwig (1994), Marchard (2018)).\nSince so much of what we know about Pyrrho comes through Timon, the\nline between these two possibilities is often very difficult to\ndraw.\n\nThere are, though, two cases where it seems clear that Timon is\nspeaking for himself rather than reproducing the thoughts of Pyrrho.\nSextus (M 3.2) reports a comment (from Timon\u2019s On\nthe Physicists) about the legitimacy of using hypotheses. He also\ntwice reports a remark of Timon about divisibility and time\n(M 6.66, 10.197\u2014the wording is not quite identical, but\nit is clearly the same thought in both places); it is a reasonable\nsupposition that this too came from On the Physicists,\nalthough Sextus does not say so. Now in both cases Timon is involved\nin a very different kind of activity from anything attested for\nPyrrho. He is intervening in technical philosophical debates; the very\nconcepts at issue make this clear. But as we saw earlier,\nphilosophical debate was something that Pyrrho rigorously avoided;\nthis was emphasized by Timon himself as one of the main sources of his\ntranquility. Again, it appears that Timon does not entirely live up to\nthe ideal that he ascribes to his teacher.\n\nBeyond the fact that these are Timon\u2019s own ideas, the amount\nthat we can learn from Sextus\u2019 reports is less than one might\nhave hoped. On the subject of hypothesis, he simply tells us that\nTimon regarded it as a question of primary importance whether anything\nshould be assumed by hypothesis. The practice of assuming things by\nhypothesis appears to have had its original home in geometry, and it\nis not surprising that the remark is cited at the beginning of\nSextus\u2019 Against the Geometers. But the occurrence of\nthe remark in a work called Against the Physicists may\nsuggest that Timon had in mind a notion of unargued assumption that\nwas not restricted to any particular subject-matter. In any case, it\nis a fair conjecture that Timon\u2019s implied answer to the question\nwas \u2018no\u2019; accepting things by hypothesis is equivalent to\naccepting them without grounds, and this is a highly dubious\nprocedure. If so, Timon anticipates the Mode from Hypothesis, which is\none of the Five Modes of the later Pyrrhonists (and where the notion\nof hypothesis has lost its specific link with geometry).\n\nThe other claim that Sextus attributes to Timon is that no process\ndivisible into temporal parts\u2014such as coming into being,\nperishing, and the like\u2014can take place in an indivisible time.\nSextus uses this as an argument for the conclusion that the present is\nnot indivisible; but there is no clear indication that this was\nTimon\u2019s purpose as well. The claim itself is unobjectionable,\nindeed almost tautological; one can imagine numerous contexts in\ndebates about the nature of time in which it might have had a point.\nSome scholars have sought to link it to doctrines current in the\nimmediately preceding period, including those of Timon\u2019s first\nteacher Stilpo of Megara. But again, it is hard to connect such a\ntrivially true statement with any definite philosophical position. If\nTimon retained any of Stilpo\u2019s teachings, they were most likely\nin the area of ethics; Stilpo, and the Megarians generally, seem to\nhave espoused an ideal of mild or moderate feeling and freedom from\ndisturbance that is recognizably akin to Pyrrho\u2019s\ntranquility.\n",
