    "main_text": "The Structure of Appearance || Goodman on Analysis\n4.1 Goodman on Analysis\nBecause Goodman is interested in the nature and logic of\nconstitutional systems as such, he begins his discussion in The\nStructure of Appearance with meta-theoretical considerations.\nSince the project of SA is to develop a constitutional system that\ndefines other notions from a predetermined basis, the question is\nwhich conditions of adequacy should be in place for evaluating the\ndefinitions. Constitutional systems are systems of rational\nreconstruction, i.e., the concepts, objects, or truths that get\nconstituted by definition from the basis are supposedly counterparts\nof concepts, objects or truths that we accept already\npre-theoretically.\nOne might think that such a reconstruction is only successful\nif definiens and definienda are synonymous. However,\nGoodman argues that the definiens of an accurate definition\nneed have neither the same intension nor even the same extension as\nthe definiendum; thus, taking as an example Alfred North\nWhitehead\u2019s analysis of geometrical points, points in space may be\ndefined equally well as certain classes of straight lines or as\ncertain infinite convergent sets of concentric spheres; but these\nalternative definientia are neither cointensive (synonymous)\nnor coextensive with each other. A set of sets of straight lines is\njust not the same set of objects as a set of infinite convergent sets\nof concentric spheres. Hence, their accuracy notwithstanding, the\nrespective definitions are not coextensive with, let alone synonymous\nwith, the definiendum. Accuracy of constructional definitions\namounts to no more than a certain homomorphism of\nthe definiens with the definiendum. This means that\nthe concepts of the constructional system must provide a structural\nmodel for the explicanda in the sense that for every connection\nbetween entities that is describable in terms of the explicanda, there\nmust obtain a matching connection, stateable in terms of the\nrespective explicata or definientia, among the counterparts\nthat the entities in question have within the system. In this way the\ntwo different definitions of \u201cpoint\u201d serve their purpose\nequally well. The objects in the sets generated\u2014although being\nvery different in kind\u2014stand in just the right relations to one\nanother within the sets to serve as an explicatum for\n\u201cpoint\u201d as geometry demands. This rather pragmatic\ncriterion of adequacy for philosophical analyses serves Goodman well\nfor a number of reasons. The most important is perhaps that Goodman\ndoes not believe there was any such thing as identity in meaning of\ntwo different expressions (see our discussion of likeness of meaning\nabove). Thus, if synonymy was made the criterion of adequacy, no\nanalysis could ever satisfy it. But relaxing the criteria of adequacy\nfor philosophical analyses to structure-preservation also supports\nGoodman\u2019s more radical theses in epistemology and metaphysics,\nespecially in his later philosophy. One of his reasons to replace the\nnotion of truth with that of \u201crightness of symbolic\nfunction\u201d, the notion of certainty with that of\n\u201cadoption\u201d, and the notion of knowledge with that of\nunderstanding is the thought that the new system of concepts preserves\nthe structural relations of the old without preserving the\nphilosophical puzzles related to truth, certainty and knowledge (RP,\nchapter X).\n",
