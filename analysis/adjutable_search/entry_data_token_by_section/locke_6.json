    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding || Book II\n2.2 Book II\n\nIn Book II of the Essay, Locke gives his positive account of\nhow we acquire the materials of knowledge. Locke distinguishes a\nvariety of different kinds of ideas in Book II. Locke holds that the\nmind is a tabula rasa or blank sheet until experience in the\nform of sensation and reflection provide the basic\nmaterials\u2014simple ideas\u2014out of which most of our more\ncomplex knowledge is constructed. While the mind may be a blank slate\nin regard to content, it is plain that Locke thinks we are born with a\nvariety of faculties to receive and abilities to manipulate or process\nthe content once we acquire it. Thus, for example, the mind can engage\nin three different types of action in putting simple ideas together.\nThe first of these kinds of action is to combine them into complex\nideas. Complex ideas are of two kinds, ideas of substances and ideas\nof modes. Substances are independent existences. Beings that count as\nsubstances include God, angels, humans, animals, plants and a variety\nof constructed things. Modes are dependent existences. These include\nmathematical and moral ideas, and all the conventional language of\nreligion, politics and culture. The second action which the mind\nperforms is the bringing of two ideas, whether simple or complex, by\none another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting\nthem. This gives us our ideas of relations (II.12.1, N: 163). The\nthird act of the mind is the production of our general ideas by\nabstraction from particulars, leaving out the particular circumstances\nof time and place, which would limit the application of an idea to a\nparticular individual. In addition to these abilities, there are such\nfaculties as memory which allow for the storing of ideas.\n\nHaving set forth the general machinery of how simple and complex ideas\nof substances, modes, relations, and so forth are derived from\nsensation and reflection, Locke also explains how a variety of\nparticular kinds of ideas, such as the ideas of solidity, number,\nspace, time, power, identity, and moral relations arise from sensation\nand reflection. Several of these are of particular interest.\nLocke\u2019s chapter on power gives rise to a discussion of free will\nand voluntary action (see the entry on\n Locke on freedom).\n Locke also made a number of interesting claims in the philosophy of\nmind. He suggested, for example, that for all we know, God could as\neasily add the powers of perception and thought to matter organized in\nthe right way as he could add those powers to an immaterial substance\nwhich would then be joined to matter organized in the right way. His\naccount of personal identity in II. xxvii was revolutionary. (See the\nentry on\n Locke on personal identity).\n Both of these topics and related ones are treated in the\nsupplementary document:\n Some Interesting Issues in Locke\u2019s Philosophy of Mind\n\n\nIn what follows, we focus on some central issues in Locke\u2019s\naccount of physical objects. (See also the entry\n Locke\u2019s philosophy of science,\n which pursues a number of topics related to Locke\u2019s account of\nphysical objects that are of considerable importance but largely\nbeyond the scope of this general account of Locke\u2019s philosophy.)\nThese include Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy, the\nlimitations of the corpuscular philosophy and Locke\u2019s relation\nto Newton.\n\nLocke offers an account of physical objects based on the mechanical\nphilosophy and the corpuscular hypothesis. The adherents of the\nmechanical philosophy held that all material phenomena can be\nexplained by matter in motion and the impact of one body on another.\nThey viewed matter as passive. They rejected the \u201coccult\nqualities\u201d and \u201ccausation at a distance\u201d of the\nAristotelian and Scholastic philosophy. Robert Boyle\u2019s\ncorpuscularian hypothesis treated the material world as made up of\nparticles. Some corpuscularians held that corpuscles could be further\ndivided and that the universe was full of matter with no void space.\nAtomists, on the other hand, held that the particles were indivisible\nand that the material world is composed of atoms and the void or empty\nspace in which the atoms move. Locke was an atomist.\n\nAtoms have properties. They are extended, they are solid, they have a\nparticular shape and they are in motion or rest. They combine together\nto produce the familiar stuff and physical objects, the gold and the\nwood, the horses and violets, the tables and chairs of our world.\nThese familiar things also have properties. They are extended, solid,\nhave a particular shape, and are in motion and at rest. In addition to\nthese properties that they share with the atoms that compose them,\nthey have other properties such as colors, smells, tastes that they\nget by standing in relation to perceivers. The distinction between\nthese two kinds of properties goes back to the Greek atomists. It is\narticulated by Galileo and Descartes as well as Locke\u2019s mentor\nRobert Boyle.\n\nLocke makes this distinction in Book II Chapter 8 of the\nEssay and using Boyle\u2019s terminology calls the two\ndifferent classes of properties the primary and secondary qualities of\nan object. This distinction is made by both of the main branches of\nthe mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth and early eighteenth\ncentury. Both the Cartesian plenum theorists, who held that the world\nwas full of infinitely divisible matter and that there was no void\nspace, and the atomists such as Gassendi, who held that there were\nindivisible atoms and void space in which the atoms move, made the\ndistinction between these two classes of properties. Still, the\ndifferences between these two branches of the mechanical philosophy\naffect their account of primary qualities. In the chapter on Solidity\n(II.4) Locke rejects the Cartesian definition of body as simply\nextended and argues that bodies are both extended and impenetrable or\nsolid. The inclusion of solidity in Locke\u2019s account of bodies\nand of primary qualities distinguishes them from the void space in\nwhich they move.\n\nThe primary qualities of an object are properties which the object\npossesses independent of us\u2014such as occupying space, being\neither in motion or at rest, having solidity and texture. The\nsecondary qualities are powers in bodies to produce ideas in us like\ncolor, taste, smell and so on that are caused by the interaction of\nour particular perceptual apparatus with the primary qualities of the\nobject. Our ideas of primary qualities resemble the qualities in the\nobject, while our ideas of secondary qualities do not resemble the\npowers that cause them. Locke also distinguishes a second class of\nsecondary properties that are the powers that one substance has to\neffect another, e.g. the power of a fire to melt a piece of wax.\n\nThere has been considerable scholarly debate concerning the details of\nLocke\u2019s account of the distinction. Among the issues are which\nqualities Locke assigns to each of the two categories. Locke gives\nseveral lists. Another issue is what the criterion is for putting a\nquality in one list rather than another. Does Locke hold that all the\nideas of secondary qualities come to us by one sense while the ideas\nof primary qualities come to us through two or is Locke not making the\ndistinction in this way? Another issue is whether there are only\nprimary qualities of atoms or whether compounds of atoms also have\nprimary qualities. And while Locke claims our ideas of primary\nqualities resemble the primary qualities in objects, and the ideas of\nsecondary qualities do not resemble their causes in the object, what\ndoes \u2018resemble\u2019 mean in this context? Related to this\nissue is how we are supposed to know about particles that we cannot\nsense. It seems clear that Locke holds that there are certain\nanalogies between the middle sized macroscopic objects we encounter in\nthe world, e.g. porphyry and manna for example, and the particles that\ncompose these things. Maurice Mandelbaum called this process\n\u2018transdiction\u2019. These analogies allow us to say certain\nthings about the nature of particles and primary and secondary\nqualities. For example we can infer that atoms are solid and that heat\nis a greater rate of motion of atoms while cold is a slower motion.\nBut these analogies may not get us very far in grasping the necessary\nconnections between qualities in nature. Yet another issue is whether\nLocke sees the distinction as reductionistic. If what we mean by\nreductionistic here is that only the primary qualities are real and\nthese explain the secondary qualities then there does not seem to be a\nclear answer. Secondary qualities surely are nothing more than certain\nprimary qualities that affect us in certain ways. This seems to be\nreductionistic. But on Locke\u2019s account of \u201creal\nideas\u201d in II.30 both the ideas of primary and secondary\nqualities count as real. And while Locke holds that our ideas of\nsecondary qualities are caused by primary qualities, in certain\nimportant respects the primary qualities do not explain them. Locke\nholds that we cannot even conceive how the size, figure and motion of\nparticles could cause any sensation in us. So, knowing the size,\nfigure and motion of the particles would be of no use to us in this\nregard (see IV.3.11\u201340, N: 544\u2013546).\n\nLocke probably holds some version of the representational theory of\nperception, though some scholars dispute this. On such a theory what\nthe mind immediately perceives are ideas, and the ideas are caused by\nand represent the objects which cause them. Thus perception is a\ntriadic relation, rather than simply being a dyadic relation between\nan object and a perceiver. Such a dyadic relational theory is often\ncalled naive realism because it suggests that the perceiver is\ndirectly perceiving the object, and naive because this view is open to\na variety of serious objections. Some versions of the representational\ntheory are open to serious objections as well. If, for example, one\ntreats ideas as things, then one can imagine that because one sees\nideas, the ideas actually block one from seeing things in the external\nworld. The idea would be like a picture or painting. The picture would\ncopy the original object in the external world, but because our\nimmediate object of perception is the picture we would be prevented\nfrom seeing the original just as standing in front of a painting on an\neasel might prevent us from seeing the person being painted. Thus,\nthis is sometimes called the picture/original theory of perception.\nAlternatively, Jonathan Bennett called it \u201cthe veil of\nperception\u201d to emphasize that \u2018seeing\u2019 the ideas\nprevents us from seeing the external world. One philosopher who\narguably held such a view was Nicholas Malebranche, a follower of\nDescartes. Antoine Arnauld, by contrast, while believing in the\nrepresentative character of ideas, is a direct realist about\nperception. Arnauld engaged in a lengthy controversy with Malebranche,\nand criticized Malebranche\u2019s account of ideas. Locke follows\nArnauld in his criticism of Malebranche on this point (Locke, 1823,\nVol. IX: 250). Yet Berkeley attributed the veil of perception\ninterpretation of the representational theory of perception to Locke\nas have many later commentators including Bennett. A.D. Woozley puts\nthe difficulty of doing this succinctly:\n\n\n\u2026it is scarcely credible both that Locke should be able to see\nand state so clearly the fundamental objection to the picture-original\ntheory of sense perception, and that he should have held the same\ntheory himself. (Woozley 1964: 27)\n\n\nJust what Locke\u2019s account of perception involves, is still a\nmatter of scholarly debate. A review of this issue at a symposium\nincluding John Rogers, Gideon Yaffe, Lex Newman, Tom Lennon, and Vere\nChappell at a meeting of the Pacific Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association in 2003 and later expanded and published in\nthe Pacific Philosophical Quarterly (2004, volume 85, issue\n3) found most of the symposiasts holding the view that Locke holds a\nrepresentative theory of perception but that he is not a skeptic about\nthe external world in the way that the veil of perception doctrine\nmight suggest.\n\nAnother issue that has been a matter of controversy since the first\npublication of the Essay is what Locke means by the term\n\u2018substance\u2019. The primary/secondary quality distinction\ngets us a certain ways in understanding physical objects, but Locke is\npuzzled about what underlies or supports the primary qualities\nthemselves. He is also puzzled about what material and immaterial\nsubstances might have in common that would lead us to apply the same\nword to both. These kinds of reflections led him to the relative and\nobscure idea of substance in general. This is an \u201cI know not\nwhat\u201d which is the support of qualities which cannot subsist by\nthemselves. We experience properties appearing in regular clumps, but\nwe must infer that there is something that supports or perhaps\n\u2018holds together\u2019 those qualities. For we have no\nexperience of that supporting substance. It is clear that Locke sees\nno alternative to the claim that there are substances supporting\nqualities. He does not, for example, have a theory of tropes (tropes\nare properties that can exist independently of substances) which he\nmight use to dispense with the notion of substance. (In fact, he may\nbe rejecting something like a theory of tropes when he rejects the\nAristotelian doctrine of real qualities and insists on the need for\nsubstances.) He is thus not at all a skeptic about\n\u2018substance\u2019 in the way that Hume is. But, it is also quite\nclear that he is regularly insistent about the limitations of our\nideas of substances. Bishop Stillingfleet accused Locke of putting\nsubstance out of the reasonable part of the world. But Locke is not\ndoing that.\n\nSince Berkeley, Locke\u2019s doctrine of the substratum or substance\nin general has been attacked as incoherent. It seems to imply that we\nhave a particular without any properties, and this seems like a notion\nthat is inconsistent with empiricism. We have no experience of such an\nentity and so no way to derive such an idea from experience. Locke\nhimself acknowledges this point (I.4.18, N: 95). In order to avoid\nthis problem, Michael Ayers has proposed that we must understand the\nnotions of \u2018substratum\u2019 and \u2018substance in\ngeneral\u2019 in terms of Locke\u2019s distinction between real and\nnominal essences and particularly his doctrine of real essences\ndeveloped in Book III of the Essay rather than as a separate\nproblem from that of knowing real essences. The real essence of a\nmaterial thing is its atomic constitution. This atomic constitution is\nthe causal basis of all the observable properties of the thing, from\nwhich we create nominal essences. Were the real essence known, all the\nobservable properties could be deduced from it. Locke claims that the\nreal essences of material things are quite unknown to us.\nLocke\u2019s concept of substance in general is also a\n\u2018something I know not what\u2019. Thus, on Ayers\u2019\ninterpretation \u2018substance in general\u2019 means something like\n\u2018whatever it is that supports qualities\u2019 while the real\nessence means \u2018this particular atomic constitution that explains\nthis set of observable qualities\u2019. Thus, Ayers wants to treat\nthe unknown substratum as picking out the same thing as the real\nessence\u2014thus eliminating the need for particulars without\nproperties. This proposed way of interpreting Locke has been\ncriticized by scholars both because of a lack of textural support, and\non the stronger grounds that it conflicts with some things that Locke\ndoes say (see Jolley 1999: 71\u20133). As we have reached one of the\nimportant concepts in Book III, let us turn to that Book and\nLocke\u2019s discussion of language.\n",
