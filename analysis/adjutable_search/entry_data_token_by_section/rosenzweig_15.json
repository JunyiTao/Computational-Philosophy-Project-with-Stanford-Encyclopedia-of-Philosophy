    "main_text": "Life and Thought after The Star || Lehrhaus\n4.1 Lehrhaus\n\n\nIn the year after the war ended, as Rosenzweig prepared both the\nStar and his Hegel and the State for publication, he\nturned his attention back to some of those issues in Jewish education\nthat had occupied him during his exchanges with Hermann Cohen.\nEncouraged by a group of Jewish intellectuals in Frankfurt to join\ntheir efforts to establish a new institute for Jewish adult education,\nRosenzweig began to formulate a program for Jewish education for his\nassimilated Jewish contemporaries, Jews who were educated and\nsuccessful in a variety of fields but who were, for the most part,\n\u201camharatzim\u201d\u2014ignoramuses\u2014when it came to\nthe Jewish sources. Rosenzweig traced the challenges facing Jewish life\nin his time back to the emancipation, which had brought unimaginable\nfreedoms and opportunities to the Jews of Europe, but which had, at the\nsame time, severed the organic connection between Jewish life, on the\none hand, and Jewish study and practice, on the other, that had been\nthe signature of traditional Judaism. Those who fought against the\nassimilationist tide of the 19th Century and continued to\ndevote themselves to Jewish law, in Rosenzweig\u2019s eyes,\ntransformed the living Torah into a rigid set of laws and practices\nrequiring zealous obedience. In his own time, Rosenzweig thus claimed,\nneither the orthodox nor the liberal forms of Judaism set out a path of\nJewish study and practice that was livable. Rosenzweig\u2019s\neducational program made the re-discovery of one\u2019s own personal\nJewish life, or the renewed commitment to one\u2019s own Jewishness\nthe starting point of the path of Jewish learning, and thereby sought\nto ensure that whatever was learned, whatever practices were taken on,\nwould become part of a living Judaism.\n\n\nRosenzweig here brought certain Platonic insights regarding the\ndangers of enlightenment to bear on his program of Jewish education.\nHis goal, he claimed, was to make it possible for contemporary\n\u201chyphenated\u201d Jews to travel the path of return to Judaism\nwithout losing in the process all that had oriented them in their lives\nup to that point. Such an intent led him to assert, in a 1923 open\nletter to Martin Buber called \u201cThe Builders,\u201d that\nobserving particular laws and practices of the Torah and the Jewish\ntradition in his time had to be rooted in each individual Jew\u2019s\nability rather than in her will. Only that Jew who\nwas capable of hearing the divine voice of revelation speaking\nand commanding through a particular law or practice, could relate to\nsuch a law or practice as an integral, meaningful part of her Jewish\nlife, rather than as an obsolete ritual demanding rigid, rote\nobedience.\n\n\nThe institute for Jewish adult education which opened, under\nRosenzweig\u2019s leadership, in the fall of 1920, was called\n\u201cThe New Jewish Lehrhaus,\u201d and its name both\nlinked it to the traditional Jewish house of study, the \u201cBeit\nMidrash\u201d and, as \u201cnew\u201d, distanced itself from\ntraditional study at the same time. The Lehrhaus aimed to\nimplement, even in the form of instruction it adopted, the approach to\nJewish return Rosenzweig had formulated. It did so by doing away with\nthe usual distance in the classroom between teacher and students. In\nthe Lehrhaus, most teachers were intentionally not\nmasters of the subject they chose to teach; they did not come to the\nclassroom with answers, but saw themselves, rather, as engaged in a\nquestioning-in-common with their students. The job of the institute and\nits leader, Rosenzweig asserted, was to ensure the \u201cpedagogical\nfruitfulness of amhaaratzus [i.e., ignorance].\u201d Here the\nquestions that emerged naturally among thoughtful students who\nrecognized their own ignorance of Jewish sources, served to forge a\nliving and intellectually satisfying path of Jewish enlightenment.\n\n\nThe Lehrhaus attracted many of the leading, up-and-coming\nJewish intellectuals of Weimar Germany into its classrooms. In its\nearly years, Martin Buber, Eduard Strauss, Ernst Simon, Richard Koch,\nRudolf Hallo, and\u2014before his death\u2014Nehemiah Nobel, were\nheavily invested in the conceptual and practical development of the\ninstitute. Through the 1920s, the Lehrhaus enjoyed the\nparticipation of such notables and future notables as Siegfried\nKracauer, S.Y Agnon, Erich Fromm, Bertha Pappenheim, Gershom Scholem,\nLeo Strauss, and Leo Loewenthal.\n",
