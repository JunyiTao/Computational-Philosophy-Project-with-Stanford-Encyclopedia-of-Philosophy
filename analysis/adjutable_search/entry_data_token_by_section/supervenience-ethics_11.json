This\nassumption has recently been challenged by ethical\nparticularists, who claim that our ethical reasons and\nobligations cannot be codified into principles. Supervenience might\nseem to be relevant to this debate. For as\n Section 3.2\n above showed, some philosophers argue that the strong metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical entails that for every ethical property,\nthere will be a base property that is necessarily coextensive with it.\nFocusing on wrongness, this in turn has the apparent consequence that\nthere is a base property B such that:\n\nEntailment\n\nIt is metaphysically necessary that an action is wrong just in case\nthat action is B.\n\n\nOne might think that Entailment just is the schema for an ethical\nprinciple concerning wrongness: for example, if we substitute\n\u2018fails to maximize happiness\u2019 for \u2018is\nB\u2019 we seem to get a clear statement of a utilitarian\nethical principle. And this in turn might seem to cast doubt on the\ncoherence of particularism.\n\nThis reasoning, however, is too quick. To see this, note that\nsupervenience itself in no way guarantees that B will be some\nelegant base property like failing to maximize happiness. B\nmight instead be enormously complicated: at the limit, supervenience\nis compatible with B simply being a disjunction of an\ninfinitely long list of complete base specifications of various\npossible worlds. Call an instance of Entailment with such a base a\ngruesome entailment. It is not clear that such entailments\nconstitute principles that are incompatible with particularism. One\nreason to think that they do not is that genuine ethical principles\narguably have explanatory power. Margaret Little argues that\nthe \u201cradical over-specificity\u201d of gruesome entailments\nrenders them non-explanatory, and hence inapt to be principles (2000,\n286). Another reason to doubt that gruesome entailments are principles\nis that we ordinarily assume that ethical principles would be usable\nby agents (Dancy 2004, 87\u20138), but a gruesome\n\u201cprinciple\u201d is clearly not. (For a relevant argument that\nthe true instance of Entailment could not be gruesome,\nbecause it would need to be learnable by ordinary speakers, see\nJackson, Pettit, and Smith 2000).\n",
