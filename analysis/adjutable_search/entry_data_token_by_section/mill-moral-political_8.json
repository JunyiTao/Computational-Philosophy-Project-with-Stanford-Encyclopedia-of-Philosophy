Consider act utilitarianism. We might expect such a\nutilitarian to be motivated by pure disinterested benevolence and to\ndeliberate by calculating expected utility. But it is a practical\nquestion how to reason or be motivated, and act utilitarianism implies\nthat this practical question, like all practical questions, is\ncorrectly answered by what would maximize utility. Utilitarian\ncalculation is time-consuming and often unreliable or subject to bias\nand distortion. For such reasons, we may better approximate the\nutilitarian standard if we don\u2019t always try to approximate it.\nMill says that to suppose that one must always consciously employ the\nutilitarian principle in making decisions\n\n\n\u2026 is to mistake the very meaning of a standard of morals and\nconfound the rule of action with the motive of it. It is the business\nof ethics to tell us what are our duties, or by what test we may know\nthem; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive of all we\ndo shall be a feeling of duty; on the contrary, ninety-nine hundredths\nof all our actions are done from other motives, and rightly so done if\nthe rule of duty does not condemn them. (U II 18)\n\n\nLater utilitarians, such as Sidgwick, have made essentially the same\npoint, insisting that utilitarianism provides a standard of\nright action, not necessarily a decision procedure\n(Methods 413).\n\nIf utilitarianism is itself the standard of right conduct, not a\ndecision procedure, then what sort of decision procedure should the\nutilitarian endorse, and what role should the principle of utility\nplay in moral reasoning? As we will see, Mill thinks that much moral\nreasoning should be governed by secondary precepts or principles about\nsuch things as fidelity, fair play, and honesty that make no direct\nreference to utility but whose general observance does promote\nutility. These secondary principles should be set aside in favor of\ndirect appeals to the utilitarian first principle in cases in which\nadherence to the secondary precept would have obviously inferior\nconsequences or in which such secondary principles conflict\n(U II 19, 24\u201325).\n\nThe question that concerns us here is what kind of utilitarian\nstandard Mill endorses. Is he an act utilitarian, a rule utilitarian,\nor some other kind of indirect utilitarian?\n",
