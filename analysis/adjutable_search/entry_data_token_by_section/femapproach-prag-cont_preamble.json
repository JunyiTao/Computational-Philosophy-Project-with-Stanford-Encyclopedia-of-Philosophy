    "main_text": "\n\nFeminist philosophy is a large and growing subfield of the discipline.\nFeminist philosophers vary in their methodologies and philosophical\naims, and are often grouped by their approaches to philosophy, or by\nthe philosophical traditions that have influenced them (for example,\nas analytic, continental, or pragmatist feminists). This entry\nprovides an overview of the group of feminist thinkers whose work\nincorporates elements of both continental and pragmatist\nphilosophies.\n\nGiven the occasional confusion of the colloquial and the philosophical\nsenses of the term \u201cpragmatism\u201d and the slipperiness of\nthe term \u201ccontinental\u201d (or \u201cpostmodern\u201d)\nphilosophy, a word about the two fields is in order before turning to\nfeminist approaches to their intersections. The so-called classical\nperiod of American philosophy, best known for its creation of American\npragmatism, was developed in the United States from the late\nnineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century by figures such as\nJane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, John Dewey, William James, Alain Locke,\nGeorge Herbert Mead, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, and Alfred\nNorth\n Whitehead.[1]\n Waning in popularity after the Second World War, American pragmatist\nphilosophy experienced a revival in the 1970s, often credited to the\n\u201cneo-pragmatist\u201d work of Richard Rorty (see especially\nRorty 1979), that continues today. Far from being an anti-theoretical\nposition that champions level-headed practicality as is sometimes\nthought, pragmatist philosophy stresses the dynamic relationship\nbetween theory and practice and especially the value of each for\ntransforming the other. It seeks to undermine other sharp dichotomies\nas well, including those between body and mind, subject and object,\nends and means, and nature and culture. Viewing knowledge as a tool\nfor enriching experience, pragmatism tends to be pluralistic,\nexperimental, fallibilist, and naturalistic. Rejecting the quest for\nabsolute certainty, it takes a meliorist attitude that human action\nsometimes can improve the world.\n\nPragmatism\u2019s emphasis on experience, developed in the wake of Darwin\u2019s\nevolutionary theory, perhaps best distinguishes it from other\nphilosophical fields. Pragmatism demands that philosophy grow out of\nand test its merits in the \u201csoil\u201d of lived experience.\nThis is not to abjure abstraction, but rather to insist that\nphilosophy deal with the genuine problems of living organisms, not the\nartificial problems of an academic discipline. It is important to\nrealize, however, that pragmatists understand the concept of\nexperience as \u201cdouble-barrelled,\u201d in James\u2019s words (James\nquoted in Dewey 2000, 463). Experience refers not only to the\nso-called \u201csubjective\u201d experience of a living being, but\nalso to the \u201cobjective\u201d world that is experienced by it.\nBiology and evolutionary theory teach that plants and non-human\nanimals cannot live apart from the environments that feed and sustain\nthem. Pragmatist philosophy incorporates this lesson by insisting that\nall of experience, including human experience, needs to be understood\nas an interaction between organism and environment. Functional\ndistinctions can be made between the two, but for pragmatism, no sharp\ndichotomy between them exists.\n\nContinental philosophy is more difficult to define as a class.\nSomewhat ironically, the concept of continental philosophy is a\ncreation of philosophers in the United States who focus on (or who are\ninfluenced by) the work of post-Enlightenment European thinkers,\nespecially those in France and Germany. While the range of European\nfigures studied by continental philosophers is too large and varied to\nlist comprehensively here, one could say that it begins with\nnineteenth century theorists such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche;\ncontinues with twentieth century thinkers such as Theodor Adorno,\nLouis Althusser, Walter Benjamin, Simone de Beauvoir, Gilles Deleuze,\nMichel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger,\nEdmund Husserl, Jacques Lacan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Herbert\nMarcuse, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre; and extends into\nthe twenty-first century with contemporary writers such as Pierre\nBourdieu, Jacques Derrida, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Julia Kristeva, and\nLuce Irigaray.\n\nSince the specific fields represented by these theorists range from\ngenealogical philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism, and critical\ntheory to deconstruction, hermeneutics, post-structuralism, and\npsychoanalytic philosophy, the label \u201ccontinental\u201d must be\nunderstood more as an umbrella concept than a precise term.\nNevertheless, contemporary continental philosophies can be seen as\nsharing a suspicion of what Lyotard (1984) has called \u201cgrand\nnarratives,\u201d which are accounts of the world and human existence\nthat (attempt to) legitimate and provide them with meaning from a\nposition external to them. Some examples of grand narratives under\nattack by continental philosophers include the idea that facts and\nvalues are sharply opposed to one another, the assumption that the\nself is essentially unified, and the belief that the pursuit of\nknowledge is for its own sake rather than driven by particular human\ninterests. A rejection of grand narratives does not entail the\ninability to make distinctions, such as those between fact and value,\nknowledge and politics, inside and outside, and thing and process. It\ninstead means understanding those distinctions as made from a\nparticular perspective and within a particular context, and remaining\nopen to the criticism and possible rejection of them if they fail to\nserve the purposes for which they were selected. The outlook of\ncontinental philosophy thus tends to be historical and perspectival,\nemphasizing the co-constitutive relationship of subject and object,\npower and social-political location, and knowledge and truth.\n\nIn its perspectival, historical, and contextual approaches to\nphilosophy, continental theory finds significant points of contact not\nonly with American pragmatism, but also with much of contemporary\nfeminist philosophy. In general and especially when influenced by\ncontinental and pragmatist philosophy, feminist philosophy can be seen\nas targeting the grand narratives of patriarchy and male privilege,\narguing that many of the so-called objective and universal truths of\nphilosophy are instead pronouncements made from a\nparticular\u2014that is, male-biased\u2014point of view. Above all,\nas this essay will reveal, the dual impact of continental and\npragmatist philosophy contributes to a feminism that challenges the\nphilosophical construction of sharp dichotomies and opposed binaries.\nSuch a challenge is feminist because even when dualisms do not\nexplicitly refer to women, gender, or sexuality, they tend to be\nimplicated in and to produce masculine (and particularly white\nmasculine) privilege.\n\nIn spite of many affinities between pragmatist, continental, and\nfeminist philosophies, there have historically been few feminists\nwhose work is recognized as explicitly incorporating both of the other\ntraditions. Instead, there have been a handful of feminists well known\nfor working out of a continental tradition who also, in a less\nrecognized fashion, have drawn from pragmatist themes and figures. In\nwhat follows, we discuss five themes that emerge in the work of\nfeminists customarily associated with continental philosophy to\nilluminate the particular way that each combines pragmatist and\ncontinental thought. In the final section, we consider more recent\nwork by feminists pioneering new uses of the intersection of\ncontinental and pragmatist feminism, and suggest possible future\ndirections that the young field might take.\n",
