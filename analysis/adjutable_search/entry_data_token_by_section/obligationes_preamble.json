    "main_text": "\n\nIn discussion, one is normally expected to stick to the truth, at\nleast as far as one knows it, but one is also expected to avoid\ndenying what one has already accepted. These two expectancies can be\nunderstood as general prima facie duties or obligations for a person\nin a dialectical encounter: duties of honesty and coherence. The\nmedieval theories of Obligationes, or\n\u201cobligations\u201d were a genre of logic that was concerned\nespecially with the latter. These theories tried to explicate what is\nlogically required for a coherent defense of one\u2019s position. The\nbasic setting in which this duty of coherence was studied, was to\nimagine or undertake disputations where explicit deviation from truth\nwas allowed through some specific additional obligation laid down at\nthe beginning. The simplest such additional obligation was to require\nthe acceptance of some obviously false sentence that had to be\ndefended in the disputation so that the respondent avoids denying it\nwhile allowing the force of logical inferences to constrain the\nanswers. In the treatises, rules were laid out showing from a logical\npoint of view how the defense ought to proceed in order to avoid\ndenying what one has accepted.\n",
