    "main_text": "\n\n\nPierre Gassendi (b. 1592, d. 1655) was a French philosopher,\nscientific chronicler, observer, and experimentalist, scholar of\nancient texts and debates, and active participant in contemporary\ndeliberations of the first half of the seventeenth century.  His\nsignificance in early modern thought has in recent years been\nrediscovered and explored, towards a better understanding of the dawn\nof modern empiricism, the mechanical philosophy, and relations of\nmodern philosophy to ancient and medieval discussions. While Gassendi\nis perhaps best known in history of philosophy for his disputes with\nDescartes, his relations with other major figures, including Kepler,\nGalileo, Mersenne, Beeckman, and Hobbes, represented even more\nimportant transactions of ideas. And while Gassendi also sought to\ncommunicate anew the ideas of Epicurus, the Stoics, and other earlier\nthinkers, his resulting amalgam of perspectives provides a modern view\nof his own making, one of the touchstones of philosophy and science in\nhis times: our access to knowledge of the natural world is dependent\non the constraints and licenses that follow from our epistemic grasp\nbeing limited to information provided by senses.  Through this\narch-empiricism\u2014tempered by his priestly adherence to key\nelements of Church doctrine\u2014Gassendi views metaphysics as a\nrealm for speculation grounded in the possibility of empirical\nconfirmation, logic as (by turns) a psychologistic and probabilistic\nenterprise, knowledge of the external world as built on and forever\nsubject to sensory-based evidence, and ethics in quasi-hedonist,\npossibly quantifiable terms. Gassendi's philosophy is a constant\nreview of other sources, a thorough consideration of the landscape\ninto which his own empiricism fits and represents an alternative to\ncontrasting claims, past and present. What is sometimes thought of as\neclecticism\u2014particularly in the posthumous masterwork, the\nSyntagma Philosophicum\u2014actually recasts philosophy as a\nfully-referenced scholarly enterprise, advancing historical styles and\nrhetorical modes in philosophical research and exposition. In these\nchanges he matches even the magnitude of innovation that marks his\natomist matter theory, empiricist perspectives, explorations and\ndefenses of the new physics, objections to the Meditations,\nand refutations of contemporary Aristotelians and mystical\nthinkers. It has been argued\u2014perhaps unfairly\u2014that\nGassendi's core ideas are better preserved through the medium of\nwritings by Boyle, Locke, Huygens, and Newton. Yet his presentation of\nan empiricism, atomism, and new cosmology in historical and\nphilosophical context greatly advanced the community of scholarship in\nhis day, and represents what was then a fairly new model of research\nand exposition\u2014still in philosophical use today.\n",
