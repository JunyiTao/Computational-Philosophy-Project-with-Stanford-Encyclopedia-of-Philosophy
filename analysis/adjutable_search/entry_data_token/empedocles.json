The philosophical system responded to Parmenides\u2019\nrejection of change while embracing religious injunctions and magical\npractices. As a result, Empedocles has occupied a significant position\nin the history of Presocratic philosophy as a figure moving between\nmythos and logos, religion and science. Modern\ndebate arises from the lack of consensus on the number of his verse\nworks, their relation to one another, and the coherence of his\nphilosophical system as a whole. This entry will introduce Empedocles,\nhis life and work\u2014traditionally referred to as On\nNature and the Purifications\u2014as well as the\nscholarly debates that continue to dominate study of his philosophical\nsystem. It closes with the influence Empedocles had upon his\nsuccessors. The numbering of the fragments in this article follows\nthat of the Diels-Kranz edition [DK] and Laks and Most 2016;\ntranslations are from Laks and Most.\n\nThe sixth edition of Diels-Kranz\u2019s Die Fragmente der\nVorsokratiker remains the gold standard for the fragments of the\nPresocratic philosophers. In this system of classification, each\nPresocratic thinker is numbered (roughly) chronologically \u2013\nEmpedocles is DK 31 in the series, for example. Following this number\n(which we omit in cases where it is clear we are referring to\nEmpedocles), fragments of each philosopher are subdivided into one of\nthree categories: testimonia, or witnesses to the\nphilosopher\u2019s thought, constitute \u2018A\u2019 fragments; the\nactual words of the philosopher fall under the category of\n\u2018B\u2019 fragments; imitations come under \u2018C\u2019\nfragments. After a fragment\u2019s letter, each also receives a\nsequential distinguishing number. For example, the first fragment of\nEmpedocles referred to in this article, DK 31 A 1, signals that it\narises from the Diels-Kranz edition, focuses on Empedocles, and is\ntestimonium no. 1. In 2016, a new and updated edition of the\nPresocratic philosophers was published with a facing translation by\nAndr\u00e9 Laks and Glenn W. Most. It is now essential to consult\nthis monumental work of scholarship in addition to Diels-Kranz. For\nthis reason, we also include notations from Laks and Most\u2019s edition\nfollowing Diels-Kranz. Laks and Most follow a different system of notation for the\nfragments: \u2018P\u2019 (= person) fragments include those in which\na philosopher\u2019s person is discussed. These give information on a\nphilosopher\u2019s biography, personality, and memorable\nsayings. \u2018D\u2019 (= doctrine) fragments refer to all\nreferences to the doctrine of the philosopher, including their own\nwords. Finally, \u2018R\u2019 (= reception) fragments preserve later\nconceptions of the philosopher\u2019s doctrine.\n", "toc": [{"#LifeWrit": "1. Life and Writings"}, {"#Natu": "2.

Life and Writings\n\nThe philosopher Empedocles was a native of the south-central Sicilian\npolis of Acragas (Agrigento). Although the precise dates of his\nlifetime are unknown, the sources agree that he was born in the early\nfifth century BCE; according to Aristotle, he died at sixty years of\nage (DK 31 A 1 = P 5b). Rich detail on the philosopher\u2019s life\nsurvives in particular through a late biography written in Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers,\nwhich dates to the third century CE. Unfortunately, much of this is a\nromantic confection, and is often derivative of the verses of\nEmpedocles himself. It is likely that he was born to an aristocratic\nfamily; his grandfather kept horses and was remembered as a victor at\nthe Olympic Games. According to the fourth-century BCE sophist\nAlcidamas\u2019 Physics (A 1 = P 15), Empedocles was a\nstudent of Parmenides of Elea, and later became an adherent of\nAnaxagoras and Pythagoras. This intellectual apprenticeship, while\nhardly possible on chronological grounds, does accurately reflect the\nverses\u2019 engagement with Parmenides\u2019 theories of coming to\nbe and passing away, and Empedocles\u2019 familiarity with the\nPythagoreans and Anaxagoras is not unlikely. The third-century BCE\nbiographer of eminent philosophers, Hermippus, by contrast, held that\nhe was an emulator of Xenophanes (A 1 = P 14). In Empedocles\u2019\nlifetime, Acragas underwent a series of political transformations from\ntyranny to oligarchy to democracy. The biographical tradition\npersistently attributes democratic sensibilities to Empedocles: he is\nsaid to have championed the people against those advancing inequality\nor aiming at tyranny (A1 = P 18\u201319). Further, he was associated\nwith dismantling an oligarchy of the \u201cThousand\u201d and\nrejecting an offer of kingship; similarly, his father apparently\nforestalled a rising tyranny (D.L. 8.72). These anecdotes may explain\nEmpedocles\u2019 reputation as a talented orator in the absence of\nany prose treatises. In Aristotle\u2019s Sophist, he is\ncredited with rhetoric\u2019s invention (A 1 = R 5). So too,\nAristotle\u2019s On the Poets praised his kinship with Homer\nin the force of his language and metaphor (A 1 = R 1b). Significantly,\nGorgias was associated with him as a student (A 1 = P 24). Elsewhere,\nEmpedocles is reported to have been a physician (A 1 = P 24) and a\nfounder of the Sicilian school of medicine. Evidence for this\nreputation is present already in the late fifth century in the\nHippocratic On Ancient Medicine, which critiques\nEmpedocles\u2019 alliance of the study of nature and medicine (A 71 =\nR 6). Most provocatively, he is said to have brought a dead woman back\nto life and been worshipped as a god in his own lifetime (A 1 = P 29),\nnarratives clearly embellished from his poetry (B 112.4 = D 4.4). Like\nhis contemporaries, Empedocles supposedly travelled widely, visiting\nThurii after its foundation in 445/4, Olympia, and elsewhere in the\nPeloponnese. His enemies may have taken such an absence as an\nopportunity to exile the philosopher (A 1 = D.L. 8.67). Reports on his\ndeath are confused. We can be sure that he did not make the fiery leap\ninto Aetna, as was widely held in antiquity (Chitwood 1986). It is\npossible, but that is all, that he died in the Peloponnese (A 1 = P\n29.71b\u201372).\n\nThough his work has not survived intact, Empedocles enjoyed a dynamic\nafterlife among philosophers and their commentators, as well as\nphysicians and natural scientists. According to Diogenes Laertius,\nEmpedocles composed two poems, On Nature and the\nPurifications. Various other works were attributed to the\nphilosopher in antiquity, including a hymn to Apollo, a poem on the\ninvasion of Xerxes, medical texts, tragedies, epigrams, and political\nessays, but there is no unambiguous evidence for these. The\ninterpretation of the extant fragments from On Nature and the\nPurifications is complicated by the modern scholarly debate\non whether they in fact constitute two works, as Diogenes Laertius\nalleged, or a single philosophical project, as some recent scholars\nhave argued (Osborne 1987, Inwood 2001, Tr\u00e9panier 2004, Janko\n2005). The latter, heterodox position has been fueled further by the\nrecent publication of the Strasbourg papyrus (Martin & Primavesi\n1999, Primavesi 2008), which contains a portion of On Nature\nwith lines that had traditionally been assigned to the\nPurifications. This find unsettles the notion of a physical\ndoctrine separate from a religious one, showing that if there are two\nworks, these were much more closely thematically related than was\npreviously understood. Nevertheless, as the topics of the two parts\n(if they did belong to a single poem) are sufficiently distinct, we\ntreat them separately here. The first primarily concerns the\nformation, structure, and history of the physical world as a whole,\nand the formation of the animals and plants within it; the second\nconcerns morality and purification. For convenience, this article uses\nthe traditional names for the two collections of fragments. \n2. On Nature\n\nOn Nature is a bold and ambitious work. It is addressed\nvariously to the Muse, Calliope; Empedocles\u2019 disciple,\nPausanias; and perhaps also to the wider community of Acragas (Obbink\n1993). The poem\u2019s authority stems from its appeal to the divine\nfor inspiration. Empedocles\u2019 Muse does not, however, forestall\nthe labor that the addressee must invest in being cognitively\nreceptive to the message of the work (B3 = D44; B 4 = D 47). As in\ntraditional didactic verse, Empedocles cultivates a\n\u201cmaster-pupil\u201d relationship and promises Pausanias a\nmortal intelligence to soar beyond all others (B 2 = D 42). On\nNature contains an ontology of matter, barring complete\ndestruction or generation, and a cosmogony, motivated by the\naggregation and separation of Empedocles\u2019 four basic elements\nthrough the power of Love and Strife. Following this, the poem passes\nto zoogony and biology, as well as reflections on cognition and\nperception.\n2.1 Roots and Forces\n\nOn Nature is based on the claim that everything is composed\nof four roots; these are moved by two opposing forces, Love and\nStrife.\n\n\nHear first of all the four roots of all things:\nZeus the gleaming, Hera who gives life, Aidoneus,\nAnd N\u00eastis, who moistens with her tears the mortal fountain.\n(B6 = D 57)\n\n\n\nSince the roots are identified by the names of deities\u2014and not\nby the traditional names for the elements fire, earth, air, and\nwater\u2014there are rival interpretations of which deity is to be\nidentified with which root. Nevertheless, there is general agreement\nthat the passage refers to fire, earth, air (= aither, the upper,\natmospheric air, rather than the air that we breathe here on earth)\nand water (cf. B 109 = D 207). Aristotle credits Empedocles with being\nthe first to distinguish clearly these four elements\n(Metaphysics. 985a31\u20133). However, the fact that the\nroots have divinities\u2019 names indicates that each has an active\nnature and is not just inert matter (Rowett 2016). These roots and\nforces are eternal and equally balanced, although the influence of\nLove and of Strife waxes and wanes (B 6 and B 17.14\u201320 = D 57\nand D 73.245\u201351).\n\nIn fragment 17 of Diels-Kranz, apparently speaking of the physical\nworld as a whole, Empedocles states his fundamental thesis about the\nrelation of roots and forces:\n\n\n\nTwofold is what I shall say: for at one time they [i.e., the elements]\ngrew to be only one \n\nOut of many, at another time again they separate to be many out of\none. \n\nAnd double is the birth of mortal things, double their death. \n\nFor the one [i.e., birth] is both born and destroyed by the coming\ntogether of all things, \n\nWhile the other inversely, when they are separated, is nourished and\nflies apart (?). \n\nAnd these [scil. the elements] incessantly exchange their places\ncontinually, \n\nSometimes by Love all coming together into one, \n\nSometimes again each one carried off by the hatred of Strife. \n\n<Thus insofar as they have learned to grow as one out of many,>\n\n\nAnd inversely, the one separating again, they end up being many, \n\nTo that extent they become, and they do not have a steadfast lifetime;\n\n\nBut insofar as they incessantly exchange their places continually, \n\nTo that extent they always are, immobile in a circle. (B 17.1\u201313\n= D 73) \n\n\n\nImmediately one is struck by the comprehensive symmetry of this\nscheme. It seems to address coming-to-be and passing-away, birth and\ndeath, and it does so with an elegant balance. The four roots come\ntogether and blend, under the agency of Love, and they are driven\napart by Strife. At the same time, elements have an active drive\ntoward homogenization on the principal of affinity (Primavesi 2016).\nWhile this passage describes periods when one of the forces is\ndominant, it also describes a cycle. One force does not finally\ntriumph over the other; rather, their periods of dominance succeed one\nanother in continual alternation.\n\nEmpedocles argues that these roots and forces do not pass away nor is\nanything added to them. They are the permanent constituents of the\ncyclic drama just described:\n\n\n\nFor these are all equal and identical in age, \n\nBut each one presides over a different honor, each one has its own\ncharacter, \n\nAnd by turns they dominate while the time revolves. \n\nAnd besides these, nothing at all is added nor is lacking; \n\nFor if they perished entirely, they would no longer be. \n\nAnd this whole here, what could increase it, and coming from where? \n\nAnd how could it be completely destroyed, since nothing is empty of\nthese? \n\nBut these are themselves, but running the ones through the others \n\nThey become now this, now that, and each time are continually similar.\n(B 17.27\u201335 = D 73.258\u2013266) \n\n\n\nWe find similar terminology in Parmenides\u2019 poem when he argues\nthat the All is one and that it does not come to be:\n\n\n\nAnd was not, nor will it be at some time, since it is now, together,\nwhole \n\nOne, continuous. For what birth could you seek for it? \n\nHow, from what could it have grown? (B 8.5\u20137 = D 8.10\u201312).\n\n\n\nOf course, a notorious consequence of Parmenides\u2019 argument is\nthe impossibility of plurality and of the world of change that we\nexperience. By contrast, Empedocles argues for a plurality of\npermanent entities, i.e., the roots and forces. By incorporating\nplurality into his account, he can explain the changing world of our\nexperience as the combination and disaggregation of the enduring roots\nunder the influence of the enduring forces. \n2.2 Cosmogony\n\nCosmogony is due to the interplay of the four roots and the two\nforces. Each of the roots has its specific nature. Some\u2014like\nfire and water\u2014are traditionally seen as antagonistic;\nothers\u2014like fire and air\u2014are seen as compatible. However,\nEmpedocles did not think the specific natures of the roots could cause\nthem to organize themselves into a cosmos. Hence, he introduces Love\nand Strife. Love works by bringing together roots of different types\ninto harmony. It does so by instilling attraction among the different\ntypes of roots for one another; without Love, these roots would not\nnaturally cohere. While it is true that Love then pulls what is\nsimilar apart from what is similar, it does not do so by causing\nrepulsion for one another in similar roots. By contrast, Strife\naggregates similar roots together by instilling repulsion among\ndifferent types of roots for one another. The work of Strife is to\nreplace the attraction among different types of roots instilled by\nLove with repulsion. During the history of a cosmos, these forces are\nin contention, present together in waxing and waning strengths,\nthroughout the coming to be of the cosmos and its creatures and in\ntheir passing away.\n\nWhile all commentators take the passage at B17.1\u201313 (=D\n73.233\u2013244) as fundamental, their interpretations vary,\nsometimes widely. In the traditional sort of interpretation (see\nO\u2019Brien 1969, Wright 1981) this passage speaks about a two-part\nsymmetrical cosmic cycle, which endlessly repeats itself. We can trace\nthe history of one cycle, beginning with the point at which all the\nroots are united, completely intermingled and motionless under the\ntotal domination of Love, an image reminiscent of Parmenides\u2019\nspherical \u201cwhat-is\u201d. Then Strife enters and begins to\nseparate the roots out, until finally all are completely separated\ninto distinct, self-contained masses of fire, air, earth and water. At\nthis point, Love begins to unite the roots until, once again, they are\ncompletely intermingled and another cycle begins. In each half of the\ncycle, as the separation or unification proceeds, there is a cosmogony\n(generation of a cosmos or ordered world) and a zoogony (generation of\nanimals). In the first half-cycle, under the increasing influence of\nStrife, a cosmos and then animals come to be. In the second half,\nunder the increasing influence of Love, again a cosmos and animals\ncome to be. We will start with the traditional interpretations which\nhold that there are double cosmogonies and then look at the second\nstrain of interpretations where there is only one cosmogony.\n\nEmpedocles posits a stage in which Love is totally dominant and all\nthings are unified into a Sphere (B 27 and 29 = D 89 and 92). Since\nthis spherical unity includes the roots, they are presumably\nthoroughly intermingled with one another (for an alternative view,\nSedley 2016). The Sphere is the initial stage in the formation of the\ncosmos; it is not itself a cosmos. At this point, Strife begins to\ninsinuate itself into the Sphere (B 30 and 31 = D 94 and 95). The\noutcome is the separation of the roots into a cosmos (A 49 = D\n99a\u2013b). The latter requires a separation of roots into\nidentifiable masses of earth, air, water, and fire (B 38 = D 122),\neven though there might still be some (much diminished) presence of\neach root within each of the four masses. The roots of earth, water,\nair and fire would predominate in the respective masses, making them\nidentifiable as such. The mass of earth is at the center; water more\nor less surrounds the earth. Air forms the next layer. From fire at\nthe periphery, the sun comes to be as a distinct entity. This\ngeocentric formation is what the ancients usually recognized to be our\ncosmos. Since it is Strife that separates the roots, the cosmogony so\ndescribed is presumably dependent on Strife\u2019s influence.\n\nEmpedocles also describes a time when Strife has separated the roots.\nThis separation is total and is the opposite pole from the Sphere,\nwhich is a total mixture under the influence of Love.\n\n\n\nWhen Strife has reached the deepest depth \n\nOf the vortex, and Love has come to be in the center of the whirl, \n\nUnder her dominion all these [i.e., the elements] come together to be\nonly one, \n\nEach one coming from a different place, not brusquely, but willingly\n(B 35.20\u201323 = D 75.3\u20136) \n\n\nFirst of all, this somewhat mysterious description suggests that the\nmeans by which Strife separates the roots from the beginning is a\nvortex. Heavier elements like earth settle in the middle and lighter\nones like fire are pushed to the periphery. This reference to the\nvortex also implies that dominance by Strife is characterized by the\nwhirling motion of the cosmos as we know it. In addition, this\nfragment suggests the end of the rule of Strife and the beginning of\nthe rule of Love, as this principle begins to insinuate itself into\nthe elements. The latter part of this passage describes the unifying\neffect of Love. \n\nAt this point, we can start to consider the difference between\ntraditional and non-traditional interpretations of Empedocles\u2019\ncycle. While in traditional interpretations the separation by Strife,\nas described above in Fr. 30 and 31 (= D 94 and 95), produces at first\na cosmos, the continuing influence of Strife gradually increases the\nseparation. Eventually, when Strife is totally dominant as described\nin B35 (= D75), the roots are so thoroughly separated into their\nrespective places, each constituting a mass totally on its own, with\nno presence in it of any portion of any of the other roots, that the\ncosmos and all its movements are destroyed. These interpretations then\nhold that there is another cosmogony in the reverse progress from\ncomplete separation to complete unity, under the influence of Love.\nCertainly, the symmetry of the fundamental principle might suggest a\nsecond cosmogony. However, we do not find in the remains of\nEmpedocles\u2019 poem a description of another cosmogony, one taking\nplace under the influence of Love. Of course, that we do not find one\ndoes not mean that it did not exist, given the fragmentary nature of\nthe text. In fact, Aristotle suggests in a number of places (De\nCaelo II 13, 295a29; De Generatione et Corruptione II 7,\n334a5) that Empedocles was committed to such a second cosmogony. But\nhe says Empedocles shied away from holding to such a cosmogony because\nit is not reasonable to posit a cosmos coming to be from elements\nalready separated\u2014as though cosmogony can only happen through\nthe separation of elements out of a previously blended condition of\nthem all (De Caelo, III 2, 301a14). \n\nSuch issues lend weight to a second strain of interpretation (see Long\n1974, Bollack 1965\u20131969), which still reads the fundamental\nprinciple of B 17 (= D 73) as referring to alternating periods of\ndomination by Love and Strife. However, they hold that there is only\none cosmogony and one zoogony. In the vortex, Strife dominates in\norder to separate the roots into their respective places, shattering\nLove\u2019s Sphere. Strife\u2019s creation of separate elements\nallows for their recombination by Love to form a cosmos. As described\nabove, this would be a condition in which some portions of each of the\nother roots become intermingled. Love asserts her influence, forming\nthe cosmos (consisting of a world-order with continental land-masses,\noceans, rivers, winds, sun, moon, seasons, planets, stars, etc.). From\nthe mixture of roots in due proportions, there arise various forms of\nanimal life. Ultimately, both animals and cosmos perish as Love\ntotally reunifies the roots. Thus, finally, the Sphere is restored and\nthe cosmos ends. On this interpretation there is a single cosmogony\ngenerated by the increasing power of Love and a single zoogony under\nalternating dominance by Love and Strife. The idea of a single\ncosmogony and zoogony is attractive, in part, because it echoes other\nPresocratic philosophers.\n\nThe discovery and publication of twelfth-century Byzantine scholia on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics and On Generation and\nCorruption (Rashed 2001, 2014) that preserve an elaborate cosmic\ntime line for Love and Strife\u2019s rule has further divided\nscholarly opinion. The scholia record an increase of Love\u2019s\npower for sixty units of time; a perfect Sphere for forty units; and a\nrule of Strife lasting sixty units. Primavesi (2016) has linked this\nratio to Pythagorean number philosophy through the structure of a\ndouble tetractys. Nonetheless, the authenticity of the scholia\u2019s\ntime line in relation to Empedocles\u2019 philosophical system\nremains contested (Osborne 2005).\n2.3 Zoogony\n\nSo far we have concentrated primarily on the coming to be of the\ncosmos. However, the interplay of forces and roots also explains the\ncoming to be and destruction of animals:\n\n\n\nBut they, when light mixed with aether in a human (?)\u2026\n\nOr in the race of savage beasts or of bushes \n\nOr of birds, then \u2026 to be born; \n\nBut when they are separated apart, this in turn they call\n\u201cunfortunate destiny\u201d, \n\nAs is licit (themis), and I myself too apply it [i.e., this\nterm] in the same way. (B 9 = D54) \n\n\nEmpedocles uses a striking image to illustrate how roots are mixed to\nproduce animals:\n\n\n\nAs when painters color many-hued sacrificial offerings, \n\nBoth men, by reason of their skill, very expert in their art, \n\nThey grasp many-colored pigments in their hands, \n\nThen, having mixed them in harmony, the ones more, the others less, \n\nOut of these they compose forms similar to all things, \n\nCreating trees, men, and women, \n\nWild beasts and birds, water-nourished fish, \n\nAnd long-lived gods, the greatest in honors: \n\nIn this way may your mind not succumb to the error that it is from\nelsewhere [scil. than from the four elementary roots] \n\nThat comes the source of all the innumerable mortal things whose\nexistence is evident, \n\nBut know this exactly, once you have heard the word of a god. (B 23 =\nD 60) \n\n\nAlthough this analogy seems to describe the way Love combines\ndifferent roots, as we shall see Empedocles associated zoogony with\nthe influence of both forces. We can distinguish two sets of fragments\nthat tell of the way that living beings come to be. The first set\ntells about fantastic events and creatures; the second about\nnatural-sounding events and creatures.\n\nLet us start with the fantastic. Empedocles says that there was a time\nwhen separate limbs wandered around on their own:\n\n\n\nFrom it [scil. the earth] blossomed many faces without necks, \n\nNaked arms wandered about, bereft of shoulders, \n\nAnd eyes roamed about alone, deprived of brows. (B 57 = D 157). \n\n\nThe wandering and straying suggest aimless and disorderly movements\n(and so, some influence of Strife). Then, however, these separate\nlimbs combined in random ways to make fantastic creatures:\n\n\n\nMany grew double of face and double of chest, \n\nRaces of man-prowed cattle, while others sprang up inversely, \n\nCreatures of cattle-headed men, mixed here from men, \n\nThere creatures of women fitted with shadowy genitals. (B 61 = D 156)\n\n\n\nIn these fragments there is a change from separateness to combination\nand cooperation (Sedley 2016). Combination and cooperation are, of\ncourse, the work of Love. Whether this phase also produced\nnon-fantastic creatures, e.g., ox-headed oxen, is not clear. Aristotle\nseemed to think it did, because he says some of these combinations\nwere fitted to survive (Physics. II 8, 198b29).\n\nIn the second set of fragments we find an explanation of the way that\npresent day creatures come to be. \n\n\n\nCome then: how fire, separating off, drew upward the nocturnal\nsaplings \n\nOf much-weeping men and women\u2014 \n\nHear this. For my tale is not aimless nor ignorant. \n\nFirst, complete [or: rough] outlines sprang up from the earth \n\nPossessing a share of both, of water as of heat. \n\nThese fire sent upward, wishing to reach what was similar to it; \n\nAs yet they displayed neither the lovely framework of limbs \n\nNor the voice and the organ that is native to men. (B 62 = D 157) \n\n\nThis phase produces the earliest human forms, which are autochthonous,\nand they have yet to show entirely human features. Ultimately, from\nthese there developed men and women as we know them today (B\n63\u201365 = D 164, 162, 171, 172). At this point, sexual\nreproduction becomes the focus of Empedocles\u2019 account. Still,\nthis first phase begins with separation of elements, as the first\nlines of the fragment show, and so it involves some influence of\nStrife.\n\nIt has been proposed that the move from discrete necks, arms, and eyes\nto the existing, compound bodies of humans and animals is an\nanticipation of a kind of evolution through natural selection (Sedley\n2016). That is, single-limbed organisms joined together with one\nanother to produce temporary compounds that survived on the basis of\ntheir success in the environment, and eventually came to reproduce\nthemselves.\n\nIn the traditional interpretations, these fragments describe two\nzoogonies, one under the increasingly dominant influence of Love and\nthe other under the dominant influence of Strife. So, the living\nbeings produced by the work of Love belong to the era when Love rules\nand those brought into existence by Strife belong to the era when\nStrife rules. By contrast, in the second strain of interpretation,\nthere is only one zoogony, which takes place under the increasing\ninfluence of Love, although Strife is still present. Thus, there are\nnot two zoogonies happening in distinct cosmic cycles; rather there\nare fluctuations of Love and Strife within the progress from total\ndomination by Strife to that by Love. This question has been affected\nby a surprising discovery. In 1994, at the Biblioth\u00e8que\nNationale et Universitaire of Strasbourg, a papyrus was identified as\ncontaining extensive fragments of Empedocles\u2019 poem; some of this\nmaterial was hitherto unknown to modern readers. In the wake of this\ndiscovery, some scholars have argued the newly found material added\nweight to the traditional reading. For instance, Tr\u00e9panier\n(2003) argues that ensemble d (see Martin\nand Primavesi 1999: 144\u2013149) strengthens previous evidence for a\nkind of zoogony taking place under the influence of Strife, which is\nfully distinct from the kind of zoogony under the influence of Love.\nIn turn, distinct zoogonies imply distinct cosmogonies.\n\nHowever, the double zoogony implies that animals or their parts will\ncome to be through a process of separation. Since zoogony under\nincreasing Love is shown to be a kind of assembly of parts that leads\nto viable creatures, by parity of reasoning, zoogony under increasing\nStrife should be a sundering of wholes that leads to viable creatures\nor to the sort of parts that are condemned to further disintegration.\nThe task, then, for the traditionalists is to find in the manuscript\npassages that clearly show a sundering that produces viable creatures\nor parts thereof. In turn, the sundering must clearly belong to a\nstage in which Strife is not just dominant\u2014after all, their\nopponents recognize a fluctuation in the influence of Love and\nStrife\u2014but is achieving complete separation. While the\ntraditionalists have presented passages from the manuscript that they\nclaim to be such evidence, the claims have not gone unchallenged (see\nBalaud\u00e9 2010 and Laks 2001). At this point in the continuing\nscholarly debate perhaps it is not too bold to say that the new\nmaterial presents some\u2014not uncontested\u2014evidence for a\ndouble zoogony.\n\nThe question of the sequence of these stages is, perhaps, not as\nimportant as the fact that, on any view, Empedocles is proposing a way\nof explaining living beings by competing principles of Love and\nStrife. While each of the four roots has its particular quality, these\nqualities alone are not enough to explain how a cosmos, and its\ncreatures, come to be. Besides the interaction of fire, air, earth,\nand water, there must be other forces at work in order to have the\nworld we live in. Thus, the four roots, with the particular qualities,\nare not so naturally antagonistic as to defy combination but are\ncapable both of repelling one another and of coming together. On the\none hand, a lot of our world is the effect of disintegration because\nthe roots prove to be antagonistic due to Strife; on the other, they\nalso come together by harmonizing their particular qualities due to\nLove. When harmony is a creative force, how Love achieves combination\ncomes to the fore. The explanation of harmonizing what could be\nantagonistic achieves an important depth in the idea of a proportional\nmixture of roots. Empedocles says that flesh and blood are composed of\napproximately equal parts of earth, fire, water, and aither (B 98 = D\n190). Another proportion of elements produces bone (B 96 = D 192).\nThus, a proper balance harmonizes the roots and banishes antagonism.\nHowever we read the cycles of Love and Strife, then, this harmony of\npotentially opposing roots is only a phase. In the sphere of Love, the\nproportion that produces the variety of creatures gives way to a\nhomogenizing blend of roots.\n\nThese fragments seem related to ancient medicine, with its theory of\nthe proper mixture of hot and cold, dry and wet as constituting the\nhealthy condition of the body (recall that we are told that Empedocles\nwas a physician as well as a philosopher and poet). However, the\nextant fragments do not show any detailed connection with medical\nexplanations. The equal proportion in the mixture of blood does seem\nrelated to another kind of explanation. Blood has a central role to\nplay in Empedocles\u2019 account of biological processes, to which we\nnow turn; among other things, it is that whereby men think (B 105 = D\n240). It appears that the equal mixture allows discrimination of all\nthings (since, of course, all things are made up of the four elements\nin differing proportions).\n2.4 Perception/Cognition\n\nIt is not clear that Empedocles makes a distinction between perception\nand cognition. Certainly the tradition in antiquity, exemplified by\nAristotle, attributes to him only an account of perception, which is\nbased on the following:\n\n\n\nFor it is by earth that we see earth, by water water, \n\nBy aether divine aether, and by fire destructive fire, \n\nAnd fondness by fondness, and strife by baleful strife. (B 109 = D\n207) \n\n\nIf we take \u201csee\u201d (op\u00f4pamen) to mean sense\nperception, then this characterization suggests that such perception\nis by the likeness of external elements to internal elements. Then,\nsince roots and principles in the perceiver are related to the roots\nand principles in the perceived object, the passage suggests that\nelements in one correspond to elements in the other. This passage, of\ncourse, does not make clear how this correspondence results in the\nperception of color and shape. Still, Empedocles is able to explain,\nby way of \u201ceffluences\u201d how the elements in the perceived\nobject affect the elements in the perceiver. Everything gives off\neffluences (B 89 = D 208). These are tiny particles that flow out from\nobjects continually. One can then grasp one half of the\ncorrespondence; effluences from the perceived object flow to the\nperceiver, in particular to the perceptual organ. Then, effluences of\nfire would make contact with the fire in the eye. On this basis, since\nfire, e.g., is white, one can construct an account of the way that\nfire, and the other roots, are responsible for color perception.\nHowever, these sorts of explanation do not encompass the perception of\nLove and Strife, which seems to depend on deduction (B 17.21 = D\n73.252). \n\nIn view of such difficulties, some have argued that B 109 (= D 207)\nimplies a more general notion than sense perception. If\nop\u00f4pamen includes understanding and knowledge (as it\nseems to in the case of Love and Strife), then Empedocles is not\ntalking about the meeting of external and internal elements. Rather,\nhe implies a more abstract operation in which we acquire an\nintellectual grasp of the roots and the forces and do not just\nperceive them (see Kamtekar 2009). However, two recent studies that\nfocus on the perception of color imply that B 109 (= D207) describes\nsense perception (Ierodiakonou 2005 and Kalderon 2015:\n1\u201316).\n\nWhether B 109 is about sense perception or not, in another passage (B\n84 = D 215) Empedocles focuses on the senses when he talks about the\nway the eye functions (trans. Rashed 2007):\n\n\nJust as when someone, before taking to the road, constructs a lamp for\nhimself, \nA flame of gleaming fire in a stormy night, \nFitting, as protection against all winds, lantern casings \nThat scatter the breath of the buffeting winds, \nWhile the light, finer as it is, leaping through to the\noutside, \nShines on the threshold with its unimpaired beams, \nThus, after Aphrodite had fitted the ogygian fire enclosed in\nmembranes with pegs of love, \nShe poured round-eyed Kor\u00ea in filmy veils \nThese kept off the depth of water flowing round about them, \nBut allowed the fire to pass through to the outside, in that it is\nfiner, where they had been bored through with marvellous funnels.\n\n\n\nIn the lantern, the flame is shielded by a linen screen, but the light\nstill goes through the linen. So the eye has a membrane through which\nthe flame within the eye goes out. This account of the eye refers to\nanother important Empedoclean idea: the surface of the eye has\npassages through which the effluent fire goes out. Still, effluences\ngo in the other direction, as well, from the objects. This possibility\nsuggests another important Empedoclean idea. In a well-known passage\nof Plato\u2019s Meno where Socrates is supposed to be giving\nEmpedocles\u2019 theory of perception, effluences come from the\nobject of perception to the organ of perception. In this account there\nis also a way to distinguish the different kinds of perception.\nDifferent sized effluences from the object fit similarly shaped\nopenings or pores in the different organs. Then colors are effluences\nfrom objects fitted to the pores of the eye (A 92 = D 209). So,\nperception of color is based on a correspondence between the shape of\nthe pores in the eye and the shape of the particles that flow from the\nperceived object.\n\nEmpedocles\u2019 portrayal of the functions of the mind also seems\nbased on the philosophy of affinity. Its materialist basis is clear\nfrom Empedocles\u2019 contention that the blood around the heart is\nuniquely suited to cognition:\n\n\n\nNourished in the seas of back-springing blood, \n\nWhere above all is located what humans call thought: \n\nFor the blood around the heart is for humans their thought. (B 105 = D\n240). \n\n\nAs in Parmenides\u2019 account of thought as a \u201cmixture of\nmuch-wandering limbs\u201d (B 16 = D 51), so too in Empedocles\nthinking appears to result from the blended ratio (Palmer\n2019)\u2014in this case, of the mixture of earth, water, air, and\nfire (A 86 = D 237). It has been suggested that the roughly even\ndistribution of the four elements in blood is what makes it so suited\nto cognition (Long 1966). Though both cognition and sense perception\noperate on the basis of affinity, their relationship to one another is\nless clear. According to the traditional interpretation, cognition\ndoes not seem to rely upon the senses. Nor is there a single\n\u201ccommand center\u201d in the blood around the heart, where\neffluences from the sensory organs are relayed to. Instead, cognition\noperates as a sense in its own right. This materialist account of\ncognition has lately been called into question (Curd 2016). As\nEmpedocles is committed to the idea that all things have a share of\nthought (B 110 = D 257), then this must include things that have no\nblood. For humans, pericardial blood might then serve as a command\ncenter for sensory data, for evaluation and judgment.\n\nHowever we interpret the process of cognition, it is clear that\nthought has the potential to dramatically alter an individual\u2019s\nconstitution:\n\n\n\nFor if, leaning upon your firm organs of thought (prapides),\n\n\nWith pure efforts you gaze upon them benevolently, \n\nThey [i.e., the elements] will all be present to you throughout your\nlifetime \n\nAnd many other good things will come to you from them. For these\nthings themselves \n\nAre what makes each thing grow in one\u2019s character, according to\neach person\u2019s nature. \n\nBut if you covet different things, such as those that among men are \n\nCountless miseries that blunt their thoughts, \n\nCertainly they will abandon you quickly, as the time revolves, \n\nIn their desire to rejoin the race that is theirs. \n\nFor know that all things feel (phronesis) and have their\nshare of thought (noema). (B 110 = D 257)\n\n\nAcceptance of Empedocles\u2019 philosophical program is envisioned as\nbeing dependent upon his physicalist doctrine of the mixture of\nelements. Its adoption by the addressee relies on a constitution that\nis receptive to truth. Still, one remains capable of growing in wisdom\n(Sassi 2016). Alternatively, the disciple will increasingly become\ncognitively corrupted, \u201cblunted\u201d. The philosopher\nTheophrastus reports that Empedocles attributed individual\ntemperaments to the more or less favorable mixture of the elements\nwithin blood, which was responsible for intelligent, slothful, and\nimpetuous individuals (B 86 = D 237).\n\nIt is likely not coincidental that the balance of elements in blood\nthat is productive of thought approximates the elemental balance also\nfound within the Sphere under the influence of Love. This would\nsuggest that cognition is to be associated with Love. But the failure\nof perfect cognition should be linked to the imperfections of the\nmixture of the elements in blood, and this must be due to the\nco-presence of Strife (Long 1966).\n3. Purifications\n\nThe title of Empedocles\u2019 hexameter poem, Purifications,\nis not likely to be original; still, the title provides a valuable\nguide to its contents. Purification or cleansing\n(\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2) could be\nperformed both prior to pollution (to ward it off) and after it was\nincurred (to dissolve its power). Ritual and symbolic washing with\nwater or blood were lustral, as was abstinence from select harmful\npractices. Seers held that the purification of the body could remove\ndisease; at the same time, Pythagoreans and Orphic mystics apparently\nunderstood purification as the emancipation of the soul from the body.\nMusaeus and Epimenides also had Purifications attached to\ntheir names. Any one or indeed all of these associations may have\nattracted the title to Empedocles\u2019 work.\n\nApart from the relatively rare explicit citations from the\nPurifications, scholars have been hard pressed to identify\nwhat fragments come from this work as opposed to On Nature,\nand in general adhere to \u201critual\u201d themes as the deciding\nfactor. Additionally, the internal audience appears to be not a single\nindividual as Pausanias, but the people of Acragas in general, and so\nsecond-person plural addresses are often taken as evidence for the\nPurifications. At the start, Empedocles declares his divinity\nand his powers of prophecy and healing to his fellow citizens. In what\nfollows the fragments of the Purifications disclose an\nancient decree and an \u201coracle of Necessity\u201d of\ntransmigration for fallen daemons, \u201cspirits\u201d, as\npunishment for their alliance with Strife through bloodshed and\nperjury (B 115 = D 10 and 11). After becoming polluted, the daemon is\nsuccessively rejected by the elements and banished from the divine for\n30,000 seasons. Empedocles reveals that he too is a participant in\nthis cosmic peripatetic. Incarnation has the potential to expiate the\ncrime of the daemon, and by moving through a series of lives as\nplants, animals, and finally, humans, he returns to the banquets of\nthe gods. But in order to achieve this enlightened state, the daemon\nmust adhere to a rigid ethical program, refusing meat, beans, and the\nbay leaf, and heterosexual sex as well. These injunctions constitute a\nradical indictment of traditional Greek religion.\n\nTransmigration is governed by the four roots under the influence of\nLove and Strife, aligning the Purifications with the physical\ndoctrine of On Nature. Here, however, the ramifications of\nmatter, attraction, and repulsion are paramount for humans. Strife\nsets off the initial collapse of divine unity, creating the daemons\nwho descend into the cycle of incarnations. Their return to the\nworship of Love permits an eventual restoration to the divine.\nEmpedocles gives a vivid portrayal of her peaceful worship by early\nhumans; this near Golden Age is in stark contrast to those fragments\nthat inveigh against traditional sacrifices and the eating of meat in\nlanguage evocative of Agamemnon\u2019s sacrifice of Iphigenia and\nThyestes\u2019 cannibal feast of his children. Worship of Love allows\nfor a return to the divine. At last the daemons arise as gods;\nreleased from exile, they enjoy a blessed life (B 146 and 147 = D 39\nand 40). \n3.1 Transmigration\n\nTransmigration is central to the philosophical program of the\nPurifications. The doctrine already had adherents in the\nfollowers of Orphism and among the Pythagoreans, and Empedocles no\ndoubt drew upon this prominent south Italian and Sicilian tradition in\nadvocating for his own cycle of incarnations (Kingsley 1995, Palmer\n2019). One part of the cycle begins under the total domination of Love\nthrough the Sphere, with Strife exiled from the four roots. After\nthese have become blended, Strife \u201cleaps\u201d into action,\nbecoming the motivator of the pollution by those gods who perjure a\nsacred decree governed by Necessity. This triggers a chain reaction of\nbanishment and wandering for the newly fallen daemons in a fragment\ntraditionally taken as part of the Purifications\n(O\u2019Brien 2001):\n\n\n\nThere is an oracle of Necessity, an ancient decree of the gods, \n\nEternal, sealed by broad oaths: \n\nWhenever by crimes some one [scil. of them] pollutes his limbs, by\nmurder \n\n<\u2026> whoever commits a fault by perjuring himself on oath,\n\n\nThe divinities (daimones) who have received as lot a long\nlife, \n\nMust wander thrice ten thousand seasons far from the blessed ones, \n\nGrowing during this time in the different forms of mortal beings, \n\nExchanging the painful paths of life. \n\nFor the force of the aether chases them toward the sea, \n\nThe sea spits them out toward earth\u2019s surface, the earth toward\nthe rays \n\nOf the bright sun, and he [i.e., the sun] hurls them into the eddies\nof the aether. \n\nEach one receives them from another, but all hate them. \n\nOf them, I too am now one, an exile from the divine and a wanderer, \n\nI who relied on insane Strife. (B 115 = D 10)\n\n\nThe daemon\u2019s fate reworks a passage from Hesiod\u2019s\nTheogony (775\u2013806) that recounts the prerogatives of\nthe goddess Styx, who, after strife and quarrels have emerged,\npunishes the gods\u2019 perjury with an exile of nine years. Yet, as\nin On Nature, the four roots are crucial\u2014air, water,\nearth, and fire play a key role in the cycle of incarnation,\nsuccessively expelling the daemon from their spheres of influence.\nDetails on the beginning of the cycle remain frustratingly unclear. At\nwhat stage in the rising influence of Strife the gods pollute\nthemselves is ambiguous, as are the precise conditions under which the\ngods become daemons. As in epic and tragedy, there may be \u201cdual\nmotivation\u201d: Strife provokes transmigration, but the daemon\nremains accountable for its crimes.\n\nPunishment arises through exile from the gods and a long wandering;\nthe daemon is hated by all and reliant on Strife. Neither Zeus nor\nHades will receive it (B 142 = D 12). The fate of mortals in general\nis grim:\n\n\n\nAlas! Wretched race of mortals, miserable race! \n\nFrom such kinds of strife and from such groans you are born! (B 124 =\nD 17)\n\n\nThe persona loquens laments, \u201cI wept and wailed when I\nsaw an unaccustomed place\u201d (B118 = D 14), and finds himself,\n\u201cFar from what honor and from what abundance of\nbliss\u201d\u2026 (B 119 = D 15). Transmigration as part of the\nritual of purification mandates partaking in a world of suffering in\nwhich all life is fated to be born, become corrupt, and die. This\nreasserts the doctrine in On Nature that all things are\nmortal except for the four roots and Love and Strife, which combine\nand break down matter. Empedocles narrates his own dissolutions and\nrecombination, \n\n\n\nFor as for me, once I was already both a youth and a girl \n\na bush and a bird, and a sea-leaping, voyaging fish. (B 117 = D 13)\n\n\n\nThe wandering of the daemon forms a \u201cladder\u201d of\ntransmigration, in a cycle ascending from animal to plant to human.\nThis hierarchy of incarnation is further subdivided, with laurel at\nthe highest plant rung; lions at the highest animal one; and seers,\npoets, doctors, and leaders of men for humans (B 127, 146 = D 36, 39).\nTheoretically, the cycle applies to all living creatures. This\nconsideration necessitates the injunction against bloodshed and\nmeat-eating:\n\n\n\nWill you not desist from evil-sounding murder? Do you not see \n\nThat you are devouring each other in the carelessness of your mind? (B\n136 = D 28)\n\n\nHumans unaware of the cycle of transmigration commit murder by eating\nflesh. The verb in Greek for \u201cdevouring\u201d\n(\u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) is used of\nwild animals, highlighting the dehumanizing effect of being\ncarnivorous. The legal language of the gods\u2019 oath returns in the\nhuman sphere, where all humans are bound by the injunction against\nkilling (B 135 = D 27a). The hexameter verse form is used to\nspectacular effect in Empedocles\u2019 equation of ritual animal\nsacrifice to human sacrifice familiar from Agamemnon\u2019s slaughter\nof Iphigenia:\n\n\n\nThe father, lifting up his own son who has changed shape, \n\nCuts his throat, with a prayer\u2014fool that he is! The others are\nat a loss \n\nWhile they sacrifice the suppliant; but he [scil. the father], deaf to\nthe shouts, \n\nHas cut the throat and prepared an evil meal in his house. \n\nIn the same way, a son seizes his father and children their mother, \n\nAnd ripping out their life they devour the flesh of their dear ones.\n(B 137 = D 29)\n\n\nThe gnomic wisdom that \u201cnot to be born is best\u201d is\nmodified by Empedocles in light of his prior transgressions: \n\n\n\nAlas, that the pitiless day did not destroy me earlier, \n\nBefore I contrived terrible deeds of feeding around my lips. (B 139 =\nD 34) \n\n\nThis fragment finds an almost exact parallel in On Nature,\nagain pointing to the fundamental unity of what have been perceived as\nphysical and ritual doctrines. Vegetarianism becomes an antidote to\nthe cannibalism inherent in meat-eating, and the extant fragments show\nsimilar injunctions against bay leaves (B 140 = D 32) and beans (B 141\n= D 31).\n\nAt an earlier stage in the cycle with Love more powerful, humans\nenjoyed a kind of Golden Age of prosperity and peace. Under her\ninfluence, humans and animals are harmonious: beasts and birds become\ntame and gentle (B 130 = D 26). For these humans, the worship of Love\nrejects blood sacrifice for honey, myrrh, perfume, and votives (B 128\n= D 25). Early human history thus models the ethical norms that must\nbe recovered in Empedocles\u2019 modernity in order to become pure\nand advance in the cycle of incarnations. The focus upon ethics in the\nPurifications is a radical shift from prior Presocratic\ndiscourse (Barnes 1979). Abstaining from meat, bay, beans, and\nheterosexual congress may place the cycle in the realm of human\nmanipulation, and the Purifications thus has a didactic\nmessage with the potential to accelerate the daemon\u2019s path from\nhuman to divine being. More speculatively, it has been suggested that\nthe motion of the cycle itself can be changed on the basis of human\naction (Osborne 2005), though this has not gone unchallenged (Picot\n& Berg 2015). \n3.2 Gods and daemons\n\nThe prominence of the divine is made clear in the fragments of the\nPurifications. In an introduction or an introductory section,\nEmpedocles asks the Muse, Calliope, to aid his inspired discourse\nabout the \u201cblessed gods\u201d (B 131 = D 7). Who are these\nfigures? According to Hippolytus, Empedocles\u2019 gods include the\nfour elements\u2014Zeus, Hera, Aidoneus, and Nestis\u2014and the two\npowers, Love and Strife (Refutation of All Heresies 7.29).\nEach plays a crucial role in the cycle of transmigration outlined in\nthe poem: Strife governs the exile of the daemon; the elements hate\nand successively reject it; and the worship of Love creates the\nconditions for the daemon\u2019s restoration. This restoration to\ngodhood further expands the pantheon to include gods who enjoy a\nshared hearth and banqueting, the absence of human misery, and freedom\nfrom destruction (B 147 = D 40). They are subject to the divine\n\u201coracle of Necessity\u201d mandating against bloodshed and they\nfall into the cycle of transmigration after foreswearing it, becoming\ndaemons like Empedocles.\n\nDaemons constitute a sub-category of gods \u201cwho have received as\nlot a long life\u201d (B 115 = D 10), and by qualifying their\nimmortality Empedocles adapts their traditional association with fate\nand a protecting spirit for humans as is evident in, for example,\nHesiod (Erg. 122, 314). The cycle constantly renews the body\nof the daemon; in one fragment, a female subject is described as\n\u201cenveloping in an unfamiliar cloak of flesh\u201d (B 126 = D\n19) a figure regularly interpreted as the daemon. At the same time,\nthe fragments take for granted some set of stable qualities that are\nincrementally purified. In the absence of any Empedoclean discussion\nof the soul or an incorporeal carrier, scholars continue to debate the\nmaterial makeup of the daemon, with arguments for it as embodied Love\n(Kahn 1960); incorporeal imprints of the Sphere (Therme 2010); or\ncompounds of the roots (Tr\u00e9panier 2014). Presumably, unlike the\nroots and Love and Strife, these \u201clong-lived\u201d gods will be\nsubject to dissolution under the total reigns of Love or Strife (B 21\n= D 77a). \n\nDaemons occupy transient forms, incarnating into plant life, animals,\nand humans. Empedocles relates that they wander in these for thirty\nthousand seasons. Their exile on earth is well-expressed by Empedocles\nin his affirmation that while the daemon transmigrates, it neither\nreaches the abode of Zeus nor the palace of Hades (B 142 = D 12). It\nis a period of suffering and loss, underscoring the importance of the\nescape that is the daemon\u2019s return to godhood. Incarnation\nappears to form a \u201cladder\u201d. The highest order of plants is\nthe laurel, and of animals, the lion. Empedocles states of humans:\n\n\n\nAt the end they become seers, hymn singers, doctors, \n\nAnd leaders for humans on the earth, \n\nAnd then they blossom up as gods, the greatest in honors. (B 146 = D\n39)\n\n\nSince antiquity, these figures have been interpreted as ethically\nideal types, as closely allied with Love. If this is correct, then the\ndaemons have become purified of Strife at this end point in the cycle.\nAn alternative suggestion is that an alliance with Love and\npurification is unnecessary and that \u201ctime served\u201d is\nsufficient to graduate a daemon to godhood (Picot-Berg 2015). \n\nPerhaps the most important question mark surrounds the issue of the\nposition of the daemon in the wider cosmic alternation of Love and\nStrife. The fragments give no unequivocal direction on integrating\ntransmigration into the ultimate dissolution of the elements under\nStrife or their complete mixture under Love. Nor do scholars yet agree\non a methodology for approaching this issue (Marciano 2001). Much\nearlier scholarship rejected the compatibility of the cosmic and\ndaemonic cycles (Diels 1898). A related solution has been to suggest\nthat the cycle of the daemon is a mythological mirror of the physical\ncycles of Love and Strife (Primavesi 2008). More often, interpreters\nattempted to unite the cycles of transmigration within the broader\nmovements toward the one and the many. This suggests that there is no\neternal paradise for the daemon after attaining godhood again. \n4. Relation of On Nature to Purifications\n\nThe relation between On Nature and Purifications is\nthe subject of varied speculations. Once it was thought that the first\nwas a scientific work and the latter a religious one. Since these\ncategories were understood to be antithetical, there could be no\nrelation at all between them; Empedocles had just written two\nincompatible poems. More recently, as the usefulness of such a rigid\ndichotomy seemed less plausible, commentators have seen the teaching\nabout nature as continuous with Purifications. Both, after\nall, give a prominent place to Love and Strife. Nature, then, is ruled\nby the very same principles that are the key to understanding the\ndrama of the ethical life, as Empedocles represents that.\nUnderstanding how nature works, one will want to side with Love and\nnot Strife\u2014especially, one will want to avoid the shedding of\nblood, that whereby we think and perceive, the very principle of\nconscious life. This sort of approach sees a complementarity between\nthe natural philosophy and the religious narrative. However, in light\nof the Strasbourg manuscript, some have argued for a tighter unity.\nMartin and Primavesi, for instance, focus on a part of\nensemble a which describes the moment when\nStrife dominates in the vortex and Love comes to be in its center.\nThis description mirrors the same event described in B 35 (= D 75),\nexcept that, besides roots being united by Love, there are also\npersons of some sort being united in Love. According to the authors,\nthese persons are the incarnated daimones of\nPurifications; in turn, these daimones, whose\npunishment through incarnation is coming to an end, are also particles\nof Love. The dissolution of composite beings under Strife, then,\nliberates these particles of Love from their cycle of incarnation and\nthey unite in Love at its advent in the center of the whirl (Martin\n& Primavesi 1999: 83\u201386, 90\u201395). Such interpretations\nmight imply that there are not two poems but one. Nevertheless, the\nway textual support has been marshaled for these sorts of readings has\nnot gone uncriticized (see Laks 2002, Bollack 2005). A third\ninterpretation has recently been proposed, which views the differences\nin emphasis between the works as not necessarily establishing two\nseparate texts, but two \u2018levels\u2019 of teaching: esoteric and\nexoteric (Curd 2005). On this reading, Empedocles is in fact\naddressing two audiences, one general, represented by the people of\nAcragas and the second-person plural, and one specialized group of\nintimates, represented by the appeals to Pausanias and the use of the\nsecond-person singular. The general audience is instructed in public\nlectures on the necessity of purifying themselves and the means to do\nso. By contrast, the inner circle receives a detailed explanation of\nthe cosmos\u2019 inner workings, a more rigorous account of\nEmpedocles\u2019 daemonology, and unique powers.\n5. Influence\n\nAs a testament to the success of Empedocles\u2019 philosophy in its\nafterlife, the philosopher boasts the largest number of preserved\nPresocratic fragments. His popularity soon after his death is assured\nby a reference to him in the Hippocratic Ancient Medicine, in\nwhich the author protests that:\n\n\nSome doctors and experts (sophistae) say that it is\nimpossible for anyone to know medicine who does not know what a human\nbeing is [\u2026]. But what they are talking about belongs to\nphilosophy (philosophi\u0113), like Empedocles and other\npeople who have written about nature\u2014what a human being is from\nthe beginning, how he came about at first and what things he is\nconstituted of. (A 71 = R 6)\n\n\nPart of this success must be attributed to Empedocles\u2019\nreputation as a poet rivaling Homer for his inspired use of expression\nand metaphor (A 1 = R 1b).\n\nYet Empedocles\u2019 philosophical theories too excited great\ninterest in his successors. Plato regularly refers to him by name, and\nin the Symposium he puts in the mouth of the comic poet\nAristophanes a re-worked version of the origin of the human that\nlampoons Empedoclean Love and Strife and Empedocles\u2019\ninterpretation of the evolutionary development of the human species: a\nformer spherical unity is split into two and then only comes together\nthrough the influence of erotic Love (O\u2019Brien 2002). Aristotle\nwas similarly influenced by him; he mentions no philosopher with\ngreater frequency except Plato. His critiques range from\nEmpedocles\u2019 treatment of the generation of elements (R 8a), to\nthe problems of Love and Strife as motive principles (A 42 = R 12 and\n13), to the motionlessness of the earth (R 14), to the growth of\nplants and animals (A 70 = R 17), to the generation of animal\norganisms (R 19). His successor, Theophrastus, devotes a long,\nagonistic section of his On Sensations to attacking\nEmpedocles\u2019 interpretations of sight, sound, smell, and thought\n(A 86 = R 25). Timon of Phlius\u2019 Silloi ridiculed his\nuse of elements (A 1 = R 37). Empedocles remained a touchstone among\nthe Stoics and Epicureans as well: a pupil of Epicurus\u2019,\nHermarchus, wrote an Against Empedocles in twenty-two books\n(Obbink 1988), while in his De Rerum Natura, Lucretius offers\nfulsome\u2014though not unqualified\u2014praise of the Agrigentine,\nwho \u201cscarcely seems to have been born of human stock\u201d (A\n21.21 = R 31.733; complete translation of the entire work is in Rouse\n1924). Chrysippus is said to have interpreted passages of his poetry\n(R 40a\u2013b) and the Stoics were associated with the element of\nfire that Empedocles may have given some prominence to (A 31 = R\n41). Sallust composed an entire Empedoclea, which Cicero\ncommended to his brother (A 27 = R 36). Thanks to this robust early\ntradition, rich exegesis on Empedocles continued in commentaries\nwritten on these authors and by the early Christians until well into\nlate antiquity. Empedocles\u2019 immortal hold on his readers\ncontinues. Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s unfinished drafts of\nDer Tod des Empedokles continue to inspire modern analysis\n(Foti 2006), and Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cstillbirth\u201d tragedy on\nEmpedocles has been well-treated recently (Most 2005), as has Matthew\nArnold\u2019s \u201cEmpedocles on Etna\u201d (Kenny 2005).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Balaud\u00e9, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, 2010, <em>Le savoir-vivre\nphilosophique: Emp\u00e9docle, Socrate, Platon</em>, Paris: Bernard\nGrasset.
