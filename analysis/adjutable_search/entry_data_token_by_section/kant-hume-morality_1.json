Kant\u2019s Relationship to Hume and British Moral Philosophy\n\nHume exerted a profound influence on Kant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n(See, e.g., Guyer 2008, Kuehn 2017, Kuehn 1987b, and Kuehn 1983.) Kant\nreports that his \u201clabor\u201d in the Critique of Pure\nReason was fundamentally a response to \u201cthat Humean\nskeptical teaching\u201d (CPrR 5:32). But the impact of Hume\u2019s\nmoral philosophy was far less direct. On the one hand, Kant\u2019s early\nethical writings are filled with positive appraisals of moral sense\ntheory or sentimentalism, and his own views reveal a significant debt\nto this tradition. On the other hand, Kant seems to associate the best\nof this tradition with Hutcheson more than with Hume (Kuehn 2001:\n182). However, Hume exerted a powerful influence on Kant\u2019s\nanthropological writings and lectures (Louden 2017), and the\nanthropological side of Kant\u2019s enterprise shaped his thinking about\nthe application of a priori moral philosophy to real human\nbeings.\n\nSentimentalism\u2019s positive influence on Kant\u2019s work was strongest\nduring the early part of his career (e.g., Walschots 2017 and Sensen\n2017). The influence is most pronounced in two of his published works\nfrom the 1760s. In Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful\nand Sublime (1764), Kant notes and analyzes the various feelings\nof pleasure or displeasure, and attraction and aversion, people feel\nto different traits and temperaments in themselves and others (and to\ndifferent types of literature, objects in nature, etc.). His remarks\nabout morality convey a commitment to some form of sentimentalism,\nhowever idiosyncratic. He claims, for example, that the principles of\nmorality are \u201cnot speculative rules, but the consciousness of a\nfeeling that lives in every human breast and that extends much further\nthan to the special grounds of sympathy and complaisance\u201d (OFBS\n2.217). He describes this as \u201cthe feeling of the beauty and the\ndignity of human nature\u201d, proclaiming that one can \u201cbring\nabout the noble attitude that is the beauty of virtue\u201d only when\na person \u201csubordinates\u201d her particular inclinations\n\u201cto such an enlarged\u201d feeling of the beauty and dignity of\nhuman nature (OFBS 2.217). Kant advances similar claims in another\nwork from the period, Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the\nPrinciples of Natural Theology and Morality (1763), where he\ndistinguishes between the faculty for representing truth and the\nfaculty for experiencing the good, identifying the latter with\nfeeling. \u201cJust as there are unanalyzable concepts of\nthe true,\u201d Kant argues, \u201cso too there is an unanalyzable feeling\nof the good\u2026 One of the tasks of the understanding is to\nanalyze and render distinct the compound and confused concept of the\ngood by showing how it arises from simpler feelings of the good\u201d (I\n2:299).\n\nOther indications of sentimentalism\u2019s influence can be found in\nKant\u2019s notes and lectures from that period. For example, in the\nannouncement of his lectures for the winter semester of\n1765\u20131766, he asserts that \u201cthe distinction between good and\nevil in actions, and the judgment of moral rightness, can be known,\neasily and accurately, by the human heart through what is called\nsentiment, and that without elaborate necessity of proofs\u201d (WS 2:311).\nIn the same announcement, he states his intention to develop and\nclarify \u201cthe attempts of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume, which,\nthough imperfect and defective, have nevertheless come farthest in the\ndiscovery of the first principles of all morality\u201d (WS 2:311).\nSimilarly, in notes that appear to come from between 1764 and 1768,\nKant writes, \u201c[t]he rules of morality proceed from a special,\neponymous feeling, upon which the understanding is\nguided\u2026\u201d (NF 19:93 #6581).\n\nAs Kant\u2019s views developed over the 1760s, his view of sentimentalism\ngrew more negative. By the late 1760s, he was arguing that this\ntradition could not possibly provide an adequate account of moral\nobligation. Morality imposes unconditional requirements, and he became\nincreasingly convinced that sentimentalism could not explain or\njustify such requirements. Arguments for this conclusion became\ncentral to Kant\u2019s later writings and lectures. In several works,\nKant creates taxonomies of misguided, heteronomous ethical theories\nbased on material determining grounds\u2014in contrast to his theory\nof autonomy, in which the moral motive constitutes an objective,\nformal determining ground (see Wood 2005b [Other Internet Resources];\nIrwin 2009: chapters 68 and 71; and Schneewind 2009). Kant\ndistinguishes among these theories based on their accounts of the\nbasis of moral obligation or the fundamental moral principle (G\n4:441\u201344; CPrR 5:39\u201341; C 27: 252\u201354; M\n29:621\u201325). Such theories may assume either subjective\n(empirical) or objective (rational) determining grounds for the moral\nprinciple; and within each of these categories, there are theories\nthat assume these determining grounds are external, and others that\nassume they are internal. Objective, internal grounds include\nperfection (e.g., Wolff and the Stoics). Objective, external grounds\ninclude the will of God (e.g., Crusius). Subjective, external grounds\ninclude education (e.g., Montaigne) or civil constitution (e.g.,\nMandeville). Subjective, internal grounds can include physical\nfeeling, such as self-love (e.g., Epicurus) or self-interest (e.g.,\nHobbes), or moral feeling (e.g., Hutcheson) (CPrR 5:40; C 27:253).\nThus, Kant locates moral sense theories among those theories that\nassume a subjective, empirical, internal determining ground of moral\nfeeling as the principle of morality (cf. M 29:621).\n\nFrom the Groundwork on, Kant\u2019s objections to sentimentalism\nconcentrate on what he takes to be its fatal flaw. No empirical\nprinciples can ground moral laws because such laws bind all rational\nbeings universally, necessarily, and unconditionally. The authority of\nempirical principles, by contrast, depends on contingent aspects of\nhuman nature (G 4:442\u201343). Furthermore, variance in moral\nfeelings makes them an inadequate standard of good and evil (G 4:442).\nMoral feelings cannot be the source of the supreme moral principle\nbecause the supreme moral principle holds for all rational beings,\nwhereas feelings differ from person to person (M 29:625). If duty were\ngrounded in feeling, morality would bind some people (e.g., the\ntender-hearted) more strongly than others. Even if people were in\ncomplete agreement regarding their moral feelings, the agreement would\nbe a contingent matter, and thus an inadequate ground for the moral\nlaw, as Kant understands it. Indeed, if morality were grounded in\nfeeling, it would be arbitrary: God could have constituted us so that\nwe would get from vice the pleasurable, calm feelings of approval that\nwe now (allegedly) get from virtue (M 29:625). So for Kant, the\ncontingency of the ground of obligation offered by moral sense\ntheories renders those theories inadequate; only a priori\ndetermining grounds will do.\n\nAs these criticisms indicate, Kant\u2019s mature thinking vehemently\nrejects sentimentalism\u2019s approach to the foundation of morality. Yet\nthe influence of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume lingered long after\nKant came to believe that morality\u2019s true foundation lies in the\nautonomy of the will. In his notes, Kant remarks that while moral\nsense theories cannot justify our moral judgments, or provide the\nstandards that should guide them, such theories do offer compelling\nempirical explanations of how we actually judge action (NF 19:117\n#6626). In the same vein, he suggests that even if one rejects moral\nsense \u201cas a principle for the judgment of moral action,\u201d\none might still accept it as a theory \u201cof the mind\u2019s\nincentives to morality\u201d (M 29:625). Kant also continues to\nendorse some version of his earlier claim in Observations\nthat some of our feelings indicate a \u201csusceptibility of the soul\nwhich\u2026 makes it fit for virtuous impulses\u201d (OFBS 2:208).\nWe see this in the Metaphysics of Morals, for instance, where\nKant claims that moral feeling, conscience, love of one\u2019s\nneighbor, and self-respect all \u201clie at the basis of morality, as\nsubjective conditions of receptiveness to the concept of\nduty\u201d (MM 6:399; see Guyer 2010). The lingering influence of\nsentimentalism can also be seen in his emphasis on the obligation to\n\u201csympathize actively\u201d with others, and in the claim that\nwe have \u201can indirect duty to cultivate the compassionate natural\n(aesthetic) feelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means\nto sympathy based on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to\nthem\u2026. For this [compassion] is still one of the impulses that\nnature has implanted in us to do what the representation of duty alone\nmight not accomplish\u201d (MM 6:457).\n",
