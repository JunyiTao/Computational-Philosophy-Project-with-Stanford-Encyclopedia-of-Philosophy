    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nWe have only a few scant clues of his biography, and we cannot be sure\nof their veracity, especially in the issue of the date of his death.\nWe know that he lived the first half of his life in Egypt, before\nmoving to Karouan, Tunisia between the years of 905\u2013907. Most\nbiographers agree that he lived to the age of 100, though they\ndisagree on the years of birth and death. Sacid al-Andalusi\n(mid-11th century), in his work Kitab Tabakat\nal-Umam, indicates that he died in 932 (R. Blachere 1935, p.\n157). However, one of Israeli\u2019s pupils, Ibn al-Jazzar died in\n1009 at an approximate age of 80. If Israeli had died in 932, Ibn\nal-Jazzar would have been only five years old at his death, thus this\ndate is unlikely. Abraham Ibn Hasday, a translator of Israeli\u2019s\nworks from Arabic into Hebrew, provides the date of his passing as\n942. But Altmann and Stern (Isaac Israeli, p. xx) have\npointed out that Ibn Hasday likely made a transcription error in his\nquotation of Sacid al-Andalusi. Another student of Israeli,\nDunash Ibn Tamim, wrote a commentary on the Jewish mystical work\nSefer Yetzirah in 956, and indicated therein that Israeli was\nno longer alive, though not mentioning the year of his death.\n\nThe Arab chroniclers of physicians indicate that Isaac Israeli served\nas a doctor to Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi, the founder of the Fatimid\nDynasty of North Africa, who reigned from 910\u2013934. In his\ncapacity as physician, Israeli wrote several medical treatises which\nwere widely regarded in the Islamic world, and highly valued in\nChristian scholastic circles as well. These works include the Book\nof Fevers, the Book of Foodstuffs and Drugs, and the\nBook of Urine. Later Islamic historians relate accounts that\nthe first and third Fatimid rulers died from not following the sound\nadvice of Isaac Israeli, though the absence of these anecdotes in the\nearlier chronicles, combined with their literary trope-like character,\nrender the tales suspect. Nonetheless, these narratives do indicate\nthe great respect accorded to Isaac Israeli.\n\nAlthough the chronicler Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2019a, as well as titles of\nsome of Israeli\u2019s work in manuscripts, assign Israeli the\npatronymic term Abu Yacqub (\u201cfather of Jacob\u201d),\nthe biographers state that he never married or fathered children, and\nattribute to him the statement that his books will cause his name to\nbe remembered far better than children would. The assignment of\npatronymics to persons who did not marry and beget offspring is not\naltogether rare\u2014thus we also see the patronymic \u201cAbu\nAyub\u201d applied to the childless poet and philosopher Solomon Ibn\nGabirol. As some of Israeli\u2019s treatises have survived over a\nmillennium and remain the occasional subject of scholarly research,\nhis prediction is correct.\n",
