    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Career\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s academic life started in physics. He then switched to\nhistory of science, and as his career developed he moved over to\nphilosophy of science, although retaining a strong interest in the\nhistory of physics. In 1943, he graduated from Harvard summa cum\nlaude. Thereafter he spent the remainder of the war years in\nresearch related to radar at Harvard and then in Europe. He gained his\nmaster\u2019s degree in physics in 1946, and his doctorate in 1949, also in\nphysics (concerning an application of quantum mechanics to solid state\nphysics). Kuhn was elected to the prestigious Society of Fellows at\nHarvard, another of whose members was W. V. Quine. At this time, and\nuntil 1956, Kuhn taught a class in science for undergraduates in the\nhumanities, as part of the General Education in Science curriculum,\ndeveloped by James B. Conant, the President of Harvard. This course\nwas centred around historical case studies, and this was Kuhn\u2019s first\nopportunity to study historical scientific texts in detail. His\ninitial bewilderment on reading the scientific work of Aristotle was a\nformative experience, followed as it was by a more or less sudden\nability to understand Aristotle properly, undistorted by knowledge of\nsubsequent science. \n This led Kuhn to concentrate on history of science and in due\ncourse he was appointed to an assistant professorship in general\neducation and the history of science. During this period his work\nfocussed on eighteenth century matter theory and the early history of\nthermodynamics. Kuhn then turned to the history of astronomy, and in\n1957 he published his first book, The Copernican\nRevolution.\n In 1961 Kuhn became a full professor at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley, having moved there in 1956 to take up a post\nin history of science, but in the philosophy department. This enabled\nhim to develop his interest in the philosophy of science. At Berkeley\nKuhn\u2019s colleagues included Stanley Cavell, who introduced Kuhn to the\nworks of Wittgenstein, and Paul Feyerabend. With Feyerabend Kuhn\ndiscussed a draft of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\nwhich was published in 1962 in the series \u201cInternational\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science\u201d, edited by Otto Neurath and\nRudolf Carnap. The central idea of this extraordinarily\ninfluential\u2014and controversial\u2014book is that the development\nof science is driven, in normal periods of science, by adherence to\nwhat Kuhn called a \u2018paradigm\u2019. The functions of a paradigm\nare to supply puzzles for scientists to solve and to provide the tools\nfor their solution. A crisis in science arises when confidence is lost\nin the ability of the paradigm to solve particularly worrying puzzles\ncalled \u2018anomalies\u2019. Crisis is followed by a scientific\nrevolution if the existing paradigm is superseded by a rival. Kuhn\nclaimed that science guided by one paradigm would be\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 with science developed under a different\nparadigm, by which is meant that there is no common measure for\nassessing the different scientific theories. This thesis of\nincommensurability, developed at the same time by Feyerabend, rules\nout certain kinds of comparison of the two theories and consequently\nrejects some traditional views of scientific development, such as the\nview that later science builds on the knowledge contained within\nearlier theories, or the view that later theories are closer\napproximations to the truth than earlier theories. Most of Kuhn\u2019s\nsubsequent work in philosophy was spent in articulating and developing\nthe ideas in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\nalthough some of these, such as the thesis of incommensurability,\nunderwent transformation in the process.\nAccording to Kuhn himself (2000, 307), The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions first aroused interest among social\nscientists, although it did in due course create the interest among\nphilosophers that Kuhn had intended (and also before long among a much\nwider academic and general audience). While acknowledging the\nimportance of Kuhn\u2019s ideas, the philosophical reception was\nnonetheless hostile. For example, Dudley Shapere\u2019s review (1964)\nemphasized the relativist implications of Kuhn\u2019s ideas, and this set\nthe context for much subsequent philosophical discussion. Since the\nfollowing of rules (of logic, of scientific method, etc.) was regarded\nas the sine qua non of rationality, Kuhn\u2019s claim that\nscientists do not employ rules in reaching their decisions appeared\ntantamount to the claim that science is irrational. This was\nhighlighted by his rejection of the distinction between discovery and\njustification (denying that we can distinguish between the\npsychological process of thinking up an idea and the logical process\nof justifying its claim to truth) and his emphasis on\nincommensurability (the claim that certain kinds of comparison between\ntheories are impossible). The negative response among philosophers was\nexacerbated by an important naturalistic tendency in The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions that was then unfamiliar. A\nparticularly significant instance of this was Kuhn\u2019s insistence on the\nimportance of the history of science for philosophy of science. The\nopening sentence of the book reads: \u201cHistory, if viewed as a\nrepository for more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a\ndecisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now\npossessed\u201d (1962/1970, 1). Also significant and unfamiliar was\nKuhn\u2019s appeal to psychological literature and examples (such as\nlinking theory-change with the changing appearance of a Gestalt\nimage).\nIn 1964 Kuhn left Berkeley to take up the position of M. Taylor\nPyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science at Princeton\nUniversity. In the following year an important event took place which\nhelped promote Kuhn\u2019s profile further among philosophers. An\nInternational Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science was held at\nBedford College, London.  One of the key events of the Colloquium was\nintended to be a debate between Kuhn and Feyerabend, with Feyerabend\npromoting the critical rationalism that he shared with Popper. As it\nwas, Feyerabend was ill and unable to attend, and the papers delivered\nfocussed on Kuhn\u2019s work. John Watkins took Feyerabend\u2019s place in a\nsession chaired by Popper. The ensuing discussion, to which Popper and\nalso Margaret Masterman and Stephen Toulmin contributed, compared and\ncontrasted the viewpoints of Kuhn and Popper and thereby helped\nilluminate the significance of Kuhn\u2019s approach. Papers from these\ndiscussants along with contributions from Feyerabend and Lakatos, were\npublished several years later, in Criticism and the Growth of\nKnowledge, edited by Lakatos and Alan Musgrave (1970) (the fourth\nvolume of proceedings from this Colloquium). In the same year the\nsecond edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was\npublished, including an important postscript in which Kuhn clarified\nhis notion of paradigm.  This was in part in response to Masterman\u2019s\n(1970) criticism that Kuhn had used \u2018paradigm\u2019 in a wide\nvariety of ways; in addition, Kuhn felt that critics had failed to\nappreciate the emphasis he placed upon the idea of a paradigm as\nan exemplar or model of puzzle-solving.  Kuhn also, for the\nfirst time, explicitly gave his work an anti-realist element by\ndenying the coherence of the idea that theories could be regarded as\nmore or less close to the truth.\nA collection of Kuhn\u2019s essays in the philosophy and history of\nscience was published in 1977, with the title The Essential\nTension taken from one of Kuhn\u2019s earliest essays in which he\nemphasizes the importance of tradition in science. The following year\nsaw the publication of his second historical monograph Black-Body\nTheory and the Quantum Discontinuity, concerning the early\nhistory of quantum mechanics. In 1983 he was named Laurence\nS. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy at MIT. Kuhn continued\nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s to work on a variety of topics in both\nhistory and philosophy of science, including the development of the\nconcept of incommensurability, and at the time of his death in 1996 he\nwas working on a second philosophical monograph dealing with, among\nother matters, an evolutionary conception of scientific change and\nconcept acquisition in developmental psychology.\n2. The Development of Science\n In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn paints a\npicture of the development of science quite unlike any that had gone\nbefore. Indeed, before Kuhn, there was little by way of a carefully\nconsidered, theoretically explained account of scientific\nchange. Instead, there was a conception of how science ought to\ndevelop that was a by-product of the prevailing philosophy of science,\nas well as a popular, heroic view of scientific progress. According to\nsuch opinions, science develops by the addition of new truths to the\nstock of old truths, or the increasing approximation of theories to\nthe truth, and in the odd case, the correction of past errors. Such\nprogress might accelerate in the hands of a particularly great\nscientist, but progress itself is guaranteed by the scientific\nmethod.\nIn the 1950s, when Kuhn began his historical studies of science,\nthe history of science was a young academic discipline. Even so, it\nwas becoming clear that scientific change was not always as\nstraightforward as the standard, traditional view would have it. Kuhn\nwas the first and most important author to articulate a developed\nalternative account. Since the standard view dovetailed with the\ndominant, positivist-influenced philosophy of science, a non-standard\nview would have important consequences for the philosophy of\nscience. Kuhn had little formal philosophical training but was\nnonetheless fully conscious of the significance of his innovation for\nphilosophy, and indeed he called his work \u2018history for philosophical\npurposes\u2019 (Kuhn 2000, 276).\n According to Kuhn the development of a science is not uniform but\nhas alternating \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018revolutionary\u2019\n(or \u2018extraordinary\u2019) phases. The revolutionary phases are\nnot merely periods of accelerated progress, but differ qualitatively\nfrom normal science. Normal science does resemble the standard\ncumulative picture of scientific progress, on the surface at\nleast. Kuhn describes normal science as \u2018puzzle-solving\u2019\n(1962/1970a, 35\u201342). While this term suggests that normal\nscience is not dramatic, its main purpose is to convey the idea that\nlike someone doing a crossword puzzle or a chess problem or a jigsaw,\nthe puzzle-solver expects to have a reasonable chance of solving the\npuzzle, that his doing so will depend mainly on his own ability, and\nthat the puzzle itself and its methods of solution will have a high\ndegree of familiarity. A puzzle-solver is not entering completely\nuncharted territory. Because its puzzles and their solutions are\nfamiliar and relatively straightforward, normal science can expect to\naccumulate a growing stock of puzzle-solutions. Revolutionary science,\nhowever, is not cumulative in that, according to Kuhn, scientific\nrevolutions involve a revision to existing scientific belief or\npractice (1962/1970a, 92). Not all the achievements of the preceding\nperiod of normal science are preserved in a revolution, and indeed a\nlater period of science may find itself without an explanation for a\nphenomenon that in an earlier period was held to be successfully\nexplained. This feature of scientific revolutions has become known as\n\u2018Kuhn-loss\u2019 (1962/1970a, 99\u2013100).\n If, as in the standard picture, scientific revolutions are like\nnormal science but better, then revolutionary science will at all\ntimes be regarded as something positive, to be sought, promoted, and\nwelcomed. Revolutions are to be sought on Popper\u2019s view also, but not\nbecause they add to positive knowledge of the truth of theories but\nbecause they add to the negative knowledge that the relevant theories\nare false. Kuhn rejected both the traditional and Popperian views in\nthis regard. He claims that normal science can succeed in making\nprogress only if there is a strong commitment by the relevant\nscientific community to their shared theoretical beliefs, values,\ninstruments and techniques, and even metaphysics. This constellation\nof shared commitments Kuhn at one point calls a \u2018disciplinary\nmatrix\u2019 (1970a, 182) although elsewhere he often uses the term\n\u2018paradigm\u2019. Because commitment to the disciplinary matrix\nis a pre-requisite for successful normal science, an inculcation of\nthat commitment is a key element in scientific training and in the\nformation of the mind-set of a successful scientist. This tension\nbetween the desire for innovation and the necessary conservativeness\nof most scientists was the subject of one of Kuhn\u2019s first essays in\nthe theory of science, \u201cThe Essential Tension\u201d (1959). The\nunusual emphasis on a conservative attitude distinguishes Kuhn not\nonly from the heroic element of the standard picture but also from\nPopper and his depiction of the scientist forever attempting to refute\nher most important theories.\n This conservative resistance to the attempted refutation of key\ntheories means that revolutions are not sought except under\nextreme circumstances. Popper\u2019s philosophy requires that a single\nreproducible, anomalous phenomenon be enough to result in the\nrejection of a theory (Popper 1959, 86\u20137). Kuhn\u2019s view is that during\nnormal science scientists neither test nor seek to confirm the guiding\ntheories of their disciplinary matrix. Nor do they regard anomalous\nresults as falsifying those theories. (It is only speculative\npuzzle-solutions that can be falsified in a Popperian fashion during\nnormal science (1970b, 19).) Rather, anomalies are ignored or explained\naway if at all possible. It is only the accumulation of particularly\ntroublesome anomalies that poses a serious problem for the existing\ndisciplinary matrix. A particularly troublesome anomaly is one that\nundermines the practice of normal science. For example, an anomaly\nmight reveal inadequacies in some commonly used piece of equipment,\nperhaps by casting doubt on the underlying theory. If much of normal\nscience relies upon this piece of equipment, normal science will find\nit difficult to continue with confidence until this anomaly is\naddressed. A widespread failure in such confidence Kuhn calls a\n\u2018crisis\u2019 (1962/1970a, 66\u201376).\n The most interesting response to crisis will be the search for a\nrevised disciplinary matrix, a revision that will allow for the\nelimination of at least the most pressing anomalies and optimally the\nsolution of many outstanding, unsolved puzzles. Such a revision\nwill be a scientific revolution. According to Popper the revolutionary\noverthrow of a theory is one that is logically required by an\nanomaly. According to Kuhn however, there are no rules for deciding\nthe significance of a puzzle and for weighing puzzles and their\nsolutions against one another. The decision to opt for a revision of a\ndisciplinary matrix is not one that is rationally compelled; nor is\nthe particular choice of revision rationally compelled. For this\nreason the revolutionary phase is particularly open to competition\namong differing ideas and rational disagreement about their relative\nmerits. Kuhn does briefly mention that extra-scientific factors might\nhelp decide the outcome of a scientific revolution\u2014the\nnationalities and personalities of leading protagonists, for example\n(1962/1970a, 152\u20133). This suggestion grew in the hands of some\nsociologists and historians of science into the thesis that the\noutcome of a scientific revolution, indeed of any step in the\ndevelopment of science, is always determined by socio-political\nfactors. Kuhn himself repudiated such ideas and his work makes it\nclear that the factors determining the outcome of a scientific\ndispute, particularly in modern science, are almost always to be found\nwithin science, specifically in connexion with the puzzle-solving\npower of the competing ideas.\n Kuhn states that science does progress, even through revolutions\n(1962/1970a, 160ff). The phenomenon of Kuhn-loss does, in Kuhn\u2019s\nview, rule out the traditional cumulative picture of progress. The\nrevolutionary search for a replacement paradigm is driven by the\nfailure of the existing paradigm to solve certain important\nanomalies. Any replacement paradigm had better solve the majority of\nthose puzzles, or it will not be worth adopting in place of the\nexisting paradigm. At the same time, even if there is some Kuhn-loss,\na worthy replacement must also retain much of the problem-solving\npower of its predecessor (1962/1970a, 169). (Kuhn does clarify the\npoint by asserting that the newer theory must retain pretty well all\nits predecessor\u2019s power to solve quantitative problems. It may however\nlose some qualitative, explanatory power [1970b, 20].) Hence we can\nsay that revolutions do bring with them an overall increase in\npuzzle-solving power, the number and significance of the puzzles and\nanomalies solved by the revised paradigm exceeding the number and\nsignificance of the puzzles-solutions that are no longer available as\na result of Kuhn-loss. Kuhn is quick to deny that there is any\ninference from such increases to improved nearness to the truth\n((1962/1970a, 170\u20131). Indeed he later denies that any sense can\nbe made of the notion of nearness to the truth (1970a, 206).\n\nRejecting a teleological view of science progressing towards the\ntruth, Kuhn favours an evolutionary view of scientific progress\n(1962/1970a, 170\u20133), discussed in detail by Wray (2011) (see\nalso Bird 2000 and Renzi 2009). The evolutionary development of an\norganism might be seen as its response to a challenge set by its\nenvironment. But that does not imply that there is some ideal form of\nthe organism that it is evolving towards. Analogously, science\nimproves by allowing its theories to evolve in response to puzzles and\nprogress is measured by its success in solving those puzzles; it is\nnot measured by its progress towards to an ideal true theory.  While\nevolution does not lead towards ideal organisms, it does lead to\ngreater diversity of kinds of organism.  As Wray explains, this is the\nbasis of a Kuhnian account of specialization in science, an account\nthat Kuhn was developing particularly in the latter part of his\ncareer.  According to this account, the revolutionary new theory that\nsucceeds in replacing another that is subject to crisis, may fail to\nsatisfy all the needs of those working with the earlier theory.  One\nresponse to this might be for the field to develop two theories, with\ndomains restricted relative to the original theory (one might be the\nold theory or a version of it).  This formation of new specialties\nwill also bring with it new taxonomic structures and so leads to\nincommensurability.\n3. The Concept of a Paradigm\nA mature science, according to Kuhn, experiences alternating phases\nof normal science and revolutions. In normal science the key theories,\ninstruments, values and metaphysical assumptions that comprise the\ndisciplinary matrix are kept fixed, permitting the cumulative\ngeneration of puzzle-solutions, whereas in a scientific revolution the\ndisciplinary matrix undergoes revision, in order to permit the\nsolution of the more serious anomalous puzzles that disturbed the\npreceding period of normal science.\nA particularly important part of Kuhn\u2019s thesis in The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions focuses upon one specific component of\nthe disciplinary matrix. This is the consensus on exemplary instances\nof scientific research. These exemplars of good science are what Kuhn\nrefers to when he uses the term \u2018paradigm\u2019 in a narrower\nsense.  He cites Aristotle\u2019s analysis of motion, Ptolemy\u2019s\ncomputations of plantery positions, Lavoisier\u2019s application of the\nbalance, and Maxwell\u2019s mathematization of the electromagnetic field as\nparadigms (1962/1970a, 23). Exemplary instances of science are\ntypically to be found in books and papers, and so Kuhn often also\ndescribes great texts as paradigms\u2014Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest,\nLavoisier\u2019s Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de\nchimie, and Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica and\nOpticks (1962/1970a, 12).  Such texts contain not only the\nkey theories and laws, but also\u2014and this is what makes them\nparadigms\u2014the applications of those theories in the solution of\nimportant problems, along with the new experimental or mathematical\ntechniques (such as the chemical balance in Trait\u00e9\n\u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie and the calculus in\nPrincipia Mathematica) employed in those applications.\nIn the postscript to the second edition of The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions Kuhn says of paradigms in this sense that\nthey are \u201cthe most novel and least understood aspect of this\nbook\u201d (1962/1970a, 187). The claim that the consensus of a\ndisciplinary matrix is primarily agreement on paradigms-as-exemplars\nis intended to explain the nature of normal science and the process of\ncrisis, revolution, and renewal of normal science. It also explains\nthe birth of a mature science. Kuhn describes an immature science, in\nwhat he sometimes calls its \u2018pre-paradigm\u2019 period, as\nlacking consensus. Competing schools of thought possess differing\nprocedures, theories, even metaphysical presuppositions. Consequently\nthere is little opportunity for collective progress. Even localized\nprogress by a particular school is made difficult, since much\nintellectual energy is put into arguing over the fundamentals with\nother schools instead of developing a research tradition. However,\nprogress is not impossible, and one school may make a breakthrough\nwhereby the shared problems of the competing schools are solved in a\nparticularly impressive fashion. This success draws away adherents\nfrom the other schools, and a widespread consensus is formed around\nthe new puzzle-solutions.\nThis widespread consensus now permits agreement on\nfundamentals. For a problem-solution will embody particular theories,\nprocedures and instrumentation, scientific language, metaphysics, and\nso forth. Consensus on the puzzle-solution will thus bring consensus\non these other aspects of a disciplinary matrix also. The successful\npuzzle-solution, now a paradigm puzzle-solution, will not solve all\nproblems. Indeed, it will probably raise new puzzles. For example, the\ntheories it employs may involve a constant whose value is not known\nwith precision; the paradigm puzzle-solution may employ approximations\nthat could be improved; it may suggest other puzzles of the same kind;\nit may suggest new areas for investigation. Generating new puzzles is\none thing that the paradigm puzzle-solution does; helping solve them\nis another. In the most favourable scenario, the new puzzles raised by the paradigm\npuzzle-solution can be addressed and answered using precisely the\ntechniques that the paradigm puzzle-solution employs. And since the\nparadigm puzzle-solution is accepted as a great achievement, these\nvery similar puzzle-solutions will be accepted as successful solutions\nalso. This is why Kuhn uses the terms \u2018exemplar\u2019 and\n\u2018paradigm\u2019. For the novel puzzle-solution which\ncrystallizes consensus is regarded and used as a model of exemplary\nscience. In the research tradition it inaugurates, a\nparadigm-as-exemplar fulfils three functions: (i) it suggests new\npuzzles; (ii) it suggests approaches to solving those puzzles; (iii)\nit is the standard by which the quality of a proposed puzzle-solution\ncan be measured (1962/1970a, 38\u20139). In each case it is similarity to\nthe exemplar that is the scientists\u2019 guide.\nThat normal science proceeds on the basis of perceived similarity\nto exemplars is an important and distinctive feature of Kuhn\u2019s new\npicture of scientific development. The standard view explained the\ncumulative addition of new knowledge in terms of the application of\nthe scientific method. Allegedly, the scientific method encapsulates\nthe rules of scientific rationality. It may be that those rules could\nnot account for the creative side of science\u2014the generation of\nnew hypotheses. The latter was thus designated \u2018the context of\ndiscovery\u2019, leaving the rules of rationality to decide in the\n\u2018context of justification\u2019 whether a new hypothesis should,\nin the light of the evidence, be added to the stock of accepted\ntheories. \nKuhn rejected the distinction between the context of discovery and\nthe context of justification (1962/1970a, 8), and correspondingly\nrejected the standard account of each. As regards the context of\ndiscovery, the standard view held that the philosophy of science had\nnothing to say on the issue of the functioning of the creative\nimagination. But Kuhn\u2019s paradigms do provide a partial explanation,\nsince training with exemplars enables scientists to see new\npuzzle-situations in terms of familiar puzzles and hence enables them\nto see potential solutions to their new puzzles. \nMore important for Kuhn was the way his account of the context of\njustification diverged from the standard picture. The functioning of\nexemplars is intended explicitly to contrast with the operation of\nrules. The key determinant in the acceptability of a proposed\npuzzle-solution is its similarity to the paradigmatic\npuzzle-solutions. Perception of similarity cannot be reduced to rules,\nand a fortiori cannot be reduced to rules of rationality. This\nrejection of rules of rationality was one of the factors that led\nKuhn\u2019s critics to accuse him of irrationalism\u2014regarding science\nas irrational. In this respect at least the accusation is wide of the\nmark. For to deny that some cognitive process is the outcome of\napplying rules of rationality is not to imply that it is an irrational\nprocess: the perception of similarity in appearance between two\nmembers of the same family also cannot be reduced to the application\nof rules of rationality. Kuhn\u2019s innovation in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions was to suggest that a key element in\ncognition in science operates in the same fashion.\n4. Incommensurability and World-Change\nThe standard empiricist conception of theory evaluation regards our\njudgment of the epistemic quality of a theory to be a matter of\napplying rules of method to the theory and the evidence. Kuhn\u2019s\ncontrasting view is that we judge the quality of a theory (and its\ntreatment of the evidence) by comparing it to a paradigmatic\ntheory. The standards of assessment therefore are not permanent,\ntheory-independent rules. They are not rules, because they involve\nperceived relations of similarity (of puzzle-solution to a\nparadigm). They are not theory-independent, since they involve\ncomparison to a (paradigm) theory. They are not permanent, since the\nparadigm may change in a scientific revolution. For example, to many\nin the seventeenth century, Newton\u2019s account of gravitation, involving\naction at a distance with no underlying explanation, seemed a poor\naccount, in that respect at least, when compared, for example, to\nPtolemy\u2019s explanation of the motion of the planets in terms of\ncontiguous crystalline spheres or to Descartes\u2019 explanation in\nterms of vortices. However, later, once Newton\u2019s theory had become\naccepted and the paradigm by which later theories were judged, the lack\nof an underlying mechanism for a fundamental force was regarded as no\nobjection, as, for example, in the case of Coulomb\u2019s law of\nelectrostatic attraction. Indeed, in the latter case the very\nsimilarity of Coulomb\u2019s equation to Newton\u2019s was taken to be in its\nfavour.\nConsequently, comparison between theories will not be as\nstraightforward as the standard empiricist picture would have it,\nsince the standards of evaluation are themselves subject to\nchange. This sort of difficulty in theory comparison is an instance of\nwhat Kuhn and Feyerabend called\n\u2018incommensurability\u2019. Theories are incommensurable when\nthey share no common measure. Thus, if paradigms are the measures of\nattempted puzzle-solutions, then puzzle-solutions developed in\ndifferent eras of normal science will be judged by comparison to\ndiffering paradigms and so lack a common measure. The term\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 derives from a mathematical use,\naccording to which the side and diagonal of a square are\nincommensurable in virtue of there being no unit that can be used to\nmeasure both exactly. Kuhn stressed that incommensurability did not\nmean non-comparability (just as the side and diagonal of a\nsquare are comparable in many respects). Even so, it is clear that at\nthe very least Kuhn\u2019s incommensurability thesis would make theory\ncomparison rather more difficult than had commonly been supposed, and\nin some cases impossible.\nWe can distinguish three types of incommensurability in Kuhn\u2019s\nremarks: (1) methodological\u2014there is no common measure because\nthe methods of comparison and evaluation change; (2)\nperceptual/observational\u2014observational evidence cannot provide a\ncommon basis for theory comparison, since perceptual experience is\ntheory-dependent; (3) semantic\u2014the fact that the languages of\ntheories from different periods of normal science may not be\ninter-translatable presents an obstacle to the comparison of those\ntheories. (See Sankey 1993 for a useful discussion of Kuhn\u2019s changing\naccounts of incommensurability.)\n4.1 Methodological Incommensurability\nThe incommensurability illustrated above whereby puzzle-solutions\nfrom different eras of normal science are evaluated by reference to\ndifferent paradigms, is methodological incommensurability. Another\nsource of methodological incommensurability is the fact that\nproponents of competing paradigms may not agree on which problems a\ncandidate paradigm should solve (1962/1970a, 148). In general the\nfactors that determine our choices of theory (whether puzzle-solutions\nor potential paradigm theories) are not fixed and neutral but vary and\nare dependent in particular on the disciplinary matrix within which\nthe scientist is working. Indeed, since decision making is not\nrule-governed or algorithmic, there is no guarantee that those working\nwithin the same disciplinary matrix must agree on their evaluation of\ntheory (1962/1970a, 200), although in such cases the room for\ndivergence will be less than when the disputants operate within\ndifferent disciplinary matrices. Despite the possibility of\ndivergence, there is nonetheless widespread agreement on the desirable\nfeatures of a new puzzle-solution or theory. Kuhn (1977, 321\u20132)\nidentifies five characteristics that provide the shared basis\nfor a choice of theory: 1. accuracy; 2. consistency (both internal and\nwith other relevant currently accepted theories); 3. scope (its\nconsequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain);\n4. simplicity (organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena);\n5. fruitfulness (for further research). Even though these are, for\nKuhn, constitutive of science (1977c, 331; 1993, 338) they cannot\ndetermine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy\nthese criteria may be disputable (e.g. does simplicity concern the\nontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical\nform?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room\nfor disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there\ncan be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one\nanother, especially when they conflict.\n4.2 Perception, Observational Incommensurability, and World-Change\nAn important focus of Kuhn\u2019s interest in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions was on the nature of perception and how it\nmay be that what a scientist observes can change as a result of\nscientific revolution. He developed what has become known as the\nthesis of the theory-dependence of observation, building on the work\nof N. R. Hanson (1958) while also referring to psychological studies\ncarried out by his Harvard colleagues, Leo Postman and Jerome Bruner\n(Bruner and Postman 1949). The standard positivist view was that\nobservation provides the neutral arbiter between competing\ntheories. The thesis that Kuhn and Hanson promoted denied this,\nholding that the nature of observation may be influenced by prior\nbeliefs and experiences. Consequently it cannot be expected that two\nscientists when observing the same scene will make the same\ntheory-neutral observations. Kuhn asserts that Galileo and an\nAristotelian when both looking at a pendulum will see different things\n(see quoted passage below).\nThe theory-dependence of observation, by rejecting the role of\nobservation as a theory-neutral arbiter among theories, provides\nanother source of incommensurability. Methodological\nincommensurability (\u00a74.1 above) denies that there are universal\nmethods for making inferences from the data. The theory-dependence of\nobservation means that even if there were agreed methods of inference\nand interpretation, incommensurability could still arise since\nscientists might disagree on the nature of the observational data\nthemselves. \nKuhn expresses or builds on the idea that participants in different\ndisciplinary matrices will see the world differently by claiming that\ntheir worlds are different: \n In a sense I am unable to explicate further, the\nproponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different\nworlds. One contains constrained bodies that fall slowly, the other\npendulums that repeat their motions again and again. In one, solutions\nare compounds, in the other mixtures. One is embedded in a flat, the\nother in a curved, matrix of space. Practicing in different worlds,\nthe two groups of scientists see different things when they look from\nthe same point in the same direction (1962/1970a, 150).\n\nRemarks such as these gave some commentators the impression that\nKuhn was a strong kind of constructivist, holding that the way the\nworld literally is depends on which scientific theory is currently\naccepted. Kuhn, however, denied any constructivist import to his\nremarks on world-change. (The closest Kuhn came to constructivism was\nto acknowledge a parallel with Kantian idealism, which is discussed\nbelow in Section 6.4.)\nKuhn likened the change in the phenomenal world to the\nGestalt-switch that occurs when one sees the duck-rabbit diagram first\nas (representing) a duck then as (representing) a rabbit, although he\nhimself acknowledged that he was not sure whether the Gestalt case was\njust an analogy or whether it illustrated some more general truth\nabout the way the mind works that encompasses the scientific case\ntoo.\n4.3 Kuhn\u2019s Early Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\n Although the theory-dependence of observation plays a significant\nrole in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, neither it\nnor methodological incommensurability could account for all the\nphenomena that Kuhn wanted to capture with the notion of\nincommensurability. Some of his own examples are rather\nstretched\u2014for instance he says Lavoisier saw oxygen where\nPriestley saw dephlogisticated air, describing this as a\n\u2018transformation of vision\u2019 (1962/1970a, 118). Moreover\nobservation\u2014if conceived of as a form of perception\u2014does not\nplay a significant part in every science. Kuhn wanted to explain his\nown experience of reading Aristotle, which first left him with the\nimpression that Aristotle was an inexplicably poor scientist (Kuhn 1987). But\ncareful study led to a change in his understanding that allowed him to\nsee that Aristotle was indeed an excellent scientist. This could not\nsimply be a matter of literally perceiving things differently. Kuhn\ntook the incommensurability that prevented him from properly\nunderstanding Aristotle to be at least partly a linguistic, semantic\nmatter. Indeed, Kuhn spent much of his career after The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions attempting to articulate a semantic\nconception of incommensurability.\nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn asserts\nthat there are important shifts in the meanings of key terms as a\nconsequence of a scientific revolution. For example, Kuhn says:\n\n\u2026 the physical referents of these Einsteinian concepts are\nby no means identical with those of the Newtonian concepts that bear\nthe same name. (Newtonian mass is conserved; Einsteinian is\nconvertible with energy. Only at low relative velocities may the two\nbe measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived\nto be the same.) (1962/1970a, 102) \nThis is important, because a standard conception of the transition\nfrom classical to relativistic physics is that although Einstein\u2019s\ntheory of relativity supersedes Newton\u2019s theory, what we have is an\nimprovement or generalization whereby Newton\u2019s theory is a special\ncase of Einstein\u2019s (to a close approximation). We can therefore say\nthat the later theory is closer to the truth than the older\ntheory. Kuhn\u2019s view that \u2018mass\u2019 as used by Newton cannot\nbe translated by \u2018mass\u2019 as used by Einstein allegedly\nrenders this kind of comparison impossible. Hence incommensurability\nis supposed to rule out convergent realism, the view that science\nshows ever improving approximation to the truth. (Kuhn also thinks,\nfor independent reasons, that the very ideas of matching the truth and similarity\nto the truth are incoherent (1970a, 206).)\nKuhn\u2019s view as expressed in the passage quoted above depends upon\nmeaning holism\u2014the claim that the meanings of terms are\ninterrelated in such a way that changing the meaning of one term\nresults in changes in the meanings of related terms: \u201cTo make\nthe transition to Einstein\u2019s universe, the whole conceptual web whose\nstrands are space, time, matter, force, and so on, had to be shifted\nand laid down again on nature whole.\u201d (1962/1970a, 149). The\nassumption of meaning holism is a long standing one in Kuhn\u2019s\nwork. One source for this is the later philosophy of\nWittgenstein. Another not unrelated source is the assumption of holism\nin the philosophy of science that is consequent upon the positivist\nconception of theoretical meaning. According to the latter, it is not\nthe function of the theoretical part of scientific language to refer\nto and describe unobserved entities. Only observational sentences\ndirectly describe the world, and this accounts for them having the\nmeaning that they do. Theories permit the deduction of observational\nsentences. This is what gives theoretical expressions their\nmeaning. Theoretical statements cannot, however, be reduced to\nobservational ones. This is because, first, theoretical propositions\nare collectively involved in the deduction of observational\nstatements, rather than singly.  Secondly, theories generate\ndispositional statements (e.g. about the solubility of a substance,\nabout how they would appear if observed under certain circumstances,\netc.), and dispositional statements, being modal, are not equivalent\nto any truth-function of (non-modal) observation\nstatements. Consequently, the meaning of a theoretical sentence is not\nequivalent to the meaning of any observational sentence or combination\nof observational sentences. The meaning of a theoretical term is a\nproduct of two factors: the relationship of the theory or theories of\nwhich it is a part to its observational consequences and the role that\nparticular term plays within those theories. This is the\ndouble-language model of the language of science and was the standard\npicture of the relationship of a scientific theory to the world when\nKuhn wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn\u2019s\nchallenge to it lay not in rejecting the anti-realism implicit in the\nview that theories do not refer to the world but rather in undermining\nthe assumption that the relationship of observation sentence to the\nworld is unproblematic. By insisting on the theory-dependence of\nobservation, Kuhn in effect argued that the holism of theoretical\nmeaning is shared by apparently observational terms also, and for this\nreason the problem of incommensurability cannot be solved by recourse\nto theory-neutral observation sentences.\n(Although it is true that Kuhn uses the expression \u2018physical\nreferent\u2019 in the passage quoted above, this should not be taken\nto mean an independently existing worldly entity. If that were the\ncase, Kuhn would be committed to the worldly existence of both\nNewtonian mass and Einsteinian mass (which are nonetheless not the\nsame). It is implausible that Kuhn intended to endorse such a view. A\nbetter interpretation is to understand Kuhn as taking reference, in\nthis context, to be a relation between a term and a hypothetical\nrather than worldly entity. Reference of anything like the Fregean,\nworldly kind plays no part in Kuhn\u2019s thinking. Again this may be seen\nas a reflection of the influence of one or other or both of the\n(later) Wittgensteinian downplaying of reference and of the positivist\nview that theories are not descriptions of the world but are in one\nway or another tools for the organization or prediction of\nobservations.)\n4.4 Kuhn\u2019s Later Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\nAlthough Kuhn asserted a semantic incommensurability thesis in\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions he did not there\narticulate or argue for the thesis in detail. This he attempted in\nsubsequent work, with the result that the nature of the thesis changed\nover time. The heart of the incommensurability thesis after The\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions is the idea that certain\nkinds of translation are impossible. Early on Kuhn drew a parallel\nwith Quine\u2019s thesis of the indeterminacy of translation (1970a, 202;\n1970c, 268). According to the latter, if we are translating one\nlanguage into another, there are inevitably a multitude of ways of\nproviding a translation that is adequate to the behaviour of the\nspeakers. None of the translations is the uniquely correct one, and in\nQuine\u2019s view there is no such thing as the meaning of the words to be\ntranslated. It was nonetheless clear that Quine\u2019s thesis was rather\nfar from Kuhn\u2019s thesis, indeed that they are incompatible. First, Kuhn\nthought that incommensurability was a matter of there being no fully\nadequate translation whereas Quine\u2019s thesis involved the availability\nof multiple translations. Secondly, Kuhn does believe that the\ntranslated expressions do have a meaning, whereas Quine denies\nthis. Thirdly, Kuhn later went on to say that unlike Quine he does not\nthink that reference is inscrutable\u2014it is just very difficult to\nrecover (1976, 191). \nSubsequently, Kuhn developed the view that incommensurability\narises from differences in classificatory schemes.  This is taxonomic\nincommensurability. A field of science is governed by a taxonomy,\nwhich divides its subject matter into kinds. Associated with a\ntaxonomy is a lexical network\u2014a network of related terms. A\nsignificant scientific change will bring with it an alteration in the\nlexical network which in turn will lead to a re-alignment of the\ntaxonomy of the field. The terms of the new and old taxonomies will\nnot be inter-translatable.\nThe problematic nature of translation arises from two\nassumptions. First, as we have seen, Kuhn assumes that meaning is\n(locally) holistic. A change in the meaning of one part of the lexical\nstructure will result in a change to all its parts. This would rule\nout preservation of the translatability of taxonomies by redefining\nthe changed part in terms of the unchanged part. Secondly, Kuhn adopts\nthe \u2018no-overlap\u2019 principle which states that categories in\na taxonomy must be hierarchically organised: if two categories have\nmembers in common then one must be fully included within the other;\notherwise they are disjoint\u2014they cannot simply overlap. This\nrules out the possibility of an all-encompassing taxonomy that\nincorporates both the original and the changed taxonomies.  (Ian\nHacking (1993) relates this to the world-change thesis: after a\nrevolution the world of individuals remains as it was, but scientists\nnow work in a world of new kinds.)\nKuhn continued to develop his conceptual approach to\nincommensurability. At the time of his death he had made considerable\nprogress on a book in which he related incommensurability to issues in\ndevelopmental psychology and concept acquisition.\n5. History of Science\n Kuhn\u2019s historical work covered several topics in the history of\nphysics and astronomy. During the 1950s his focus was primarily on the\nearly theory of heat and the work of Sadi Carnot. However, his first\nbook concerned the Copernican revolution in planetary astronomy\n(1957). This book grew out of the teaching he had done on James\nConant\u2019s General Education in Science curriculum at Harvard but also\npresaged some of the ideas of The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions. In detailing the problems with the Ptolemaic system\nand Copernicus\u2019 solution to them, Kuhn showed two things. First,\nhe demonstrated that Aristotelian science was genuine science and that\nthose working within that tradition, in particular those working on\nPtolemaic astronomy, were engaged in an entirely reasonable and\nrecognizably scientific project. Secondly, Kuhn showed that Copernicus\nwas himself far more indebted to that tradition than had typically\nbeen recognized. Thus the popular view that Copernicus was a modern\nscientist who overthrew an unscientific and long-outmoded viewpoint is\nmistaken both by exaggerating the difference between Copernicus and\nthe Ptolemaic astronomers and in underestimating the scientific\ncredentials of work carried out before Copernicus. This mistaken\nview\u2014a product of the distortion caused by our current state of\nknowledge\u2014can be rectified only by seeing the activities of\nCopernicus and his predecessors in the light of the puzzles presented\nto them by tradition that they inevitably had to work with. While Kuhn\ndoes acknowledge the influence of causes outside science (such as a\nresurgence in Sun worship (1962/70a, 152\u20133)), he nonetheless\nemphasizes the fact that astronomers were responding primarily to\nproblems raised within science. What appealed to them in\nCopernicus\u2019 model was its ability to do away with ad hoc devices\nin Ptolemy\u2019s system (such as the equant), to explain key phenomena in\na pleasing fashion (the observed retrograde motion of the planets),\nand to explain away otherwise inexplicable coincidences in Ptolemy\u2019s\nsystem (such as the alignment of the Sun and the centres of the\nepicycles of the inferior planets).\nIn the 1960s Kuhn\u2019s historical work turned toward the early history\nof quantum theory, culminating in his book Black-Body Theory and\nthe Quantum Discontinuity. According to classical physics a\nparticle could possess any energy in a continuous range and if it\nchanges energy it does so in a continuous fashion, possessing at some\npoint in time every energy between the initial and final energy\nstates. Modern quantum theory denies both these classical\nprinciples. Energy is quantised\u2014a particle may possess only one\nof a set of discrete energies. Consequently if it changes in energy\nfrom one value to the next permitted value it does so discontinuously,\njumping straight from one energy to the other without taking any of\nthe intermediate (\u2018forbidden\u2019) values. In order to explain\nthe distribution of energy within a cavity (black-body radiation),\nPlanck used the device of dividing up the energy states into multiples\nof the unit or \u2018quantum\u2019 h\u03bd (where \u03bd is the\nfrequency of radiation and h is what subsequently became\nknown as Planck\u2019s constant). Planck did this in order to employ a\nstatistical technique of Boltzmann\u2019s whereby the range of possible\ncontinuous energies is divided into \u2018cells\u2019 of\nsimilar energies that could be treated together for mathematical\npurposes. Kuhn notes that Planck was puzzled that in carrying out his\nderivation, only by fixing the cell size at h\u03bd could he\nget the result he wanted\u2014the technique should have worked for any\nway of dividing the cells, so long as they were small enough but not\ntoo small. This work of Planck\u2019s was carried out in the period 1900\u20131,\nwhich is the date tradition has accorded to the invention of the\nquantum concept. However, argued Kuhn, Planck did not have in mind a\ngenuine physical discontinuity of energies until 1908, which is after\nAlbert Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest had themselves emphasized it in\n1905\u20136.\n Many readers were surprised not to find mention of paradigms or\nincommensurability. Kuhn later added an Afterword, \u201cRevisiting\nPlanck\u201d, explaining that he had not repudiated or ignored those\nideas but that they were implicit in the argument he gave. Indeed the\nwhole essay may be seen as a demonstration of an incommensurability\nbetween the mature quantum theory and the early quantum theory of\nPlanck which was still rooted in classical statistical physics. In\nparticular the very term \u2018quantum\u2019 changed its meaning\nbetween its introduction by Planck and its later use. Kuhn argues that\nthe modern quantum concept was introduced first not by Planck but by\nEinstein. Furthermore, this fact is hidden both by the continued use\nof the same term and by the same distortion of history that has\naffected our conception of Ptolemy and Copernicus. As in\nCopernicus\u2019 case, Planck has been seen as more revolutionary\nthan in fact he was. In Planck\u2019s case, however, this misconception was\nalso shared by Planck himself later in life.\n6. Criticism and Influence\nKuhn\u2019s work met with a largely critical reception among\nphilosophers. Some of this criticism became muted as Kuhn\u2019s work\nbecame better understood and as his own thinking underwent\ntransformation. At the same time other developments in philosophy\nopened up new avenues for criticism. That criticism has largely\nfocussed on two areas. First, it has been argued that Kuhn\u2019s account\nof the development of science is not entirely accurate. Secondly,\ncritics have attacked Kuhn\u2019s notion of incommensurability, arguing\nthat either it does not exist or, if it does exist, it is not a\nsignificant problem. Despite this criticism, Kuhn\u2019s work has been\nhugely influential, both within philosophy and outside it. The\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions was an important stimulus to\nwhat has since become known as \u2018Science Studies\u2019, in particular the\nSociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK).\n6.1 Scientific Change\nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions periods of\nnormal science and revolutionary science are clearly distinguished.\nIn particular paradigms and their theories are not questioned and not\nchanged in normal science whereas they are questioned and are changed\nin revolutionary science.  Thus a revolution is, by definition\nrevisionary, and normal science is not (as regards\nparadigms). Furthermore, normal science does not suffer from the\nconceptual discontinuities that lead to incommensurability whereas\nrevolutions do. This gives the impression, confirmed by Kuhn\u2019s\nexamples, that revolutions are particularly significant and reasonably\nrare episodes in the history of science.\nThis picture has been questioned for its accuracy.  Stephen Toulmin\n(1970) argues that a more realistic picture shows that revisionary\nchanges in science are far more common and correspondingly less\ndramatic than Kuhn supposes, and that perfectly \u2018normal\u2019\nscience experiences these changes also.  Kuhn could reply that such\nrevisions are not revisions to the paradigm but to the non-paradigm\npuzzle-solutions provided by normal science.  But that in turn\nrequires a clear distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic\ncomponents of science, a distinction that, arguably, Kuhn has not\nsupplied in any detail.\nAt the same time, by making revisionary change a necessary\ncondition of revolutionary science, Kuhn ignores important discoveries\nand developments that are widely regarded as revolutionary, such as\nthe discovery of the structure of DNA and the revolution in molecular\nbiology. Kuhn\u2019s view is that discoveries and revolutions come about\nonly as a consequence of the appearance of anomalies. Yet it is also\nclear that a discovery might come about in the course of normal\nscience and initiate a \u2018revolution\u2019 (in a non-Kuhnian\nsense) in a field because of the unexpected insight it provides and\nthe way it opens up opportunities for new avenues of research.  The\ndouble-helical structure of DNA was not expected but immediately\nsuggested a mechanism for the duplication of genetic information\n(e.g. in mitosis), which had enormous consequences for subsequent\nbiological research.\n6.2 Incommensurability\nKuhn\u2019s incommensurability thesis presented a challenge not only to\npositivist conceptions of scientific change but also to realist ones.\nFor a realist conception of scientific progress also wishes to assert\nthat, by and large, later science improves on earlier science, in\nparticular by approaching closer to the truth.  A standard realist\nresponse from the late 1960s was to reject the anti-realism and\nanti-referentialism shared by both Kuhn\u2019s picture and the preceding\ndouble-language model. If we do take theories to be potential\ndescriptions of the world, involving reference to worldly entities,\nkind, and properties, then the problems raised by incommensurability\nlargely evaporate. As we have seen, Kuhn thinks that we cannot\nproperly say that Einstein\u2019s theory is an improvement on Newton\u2019s in\nthe sense that the latter as deals reasonably accurately\n(only) with a special case of the former. Whether or not the key terms\n(such as \u2018mass\u2019) in the two theories differ in meaning, a\nrealist and referentialist approach to theories permits one to say\nthat Einstein\u2019s theory is closer to the truth than Newton\u2019s. For truth\nand nearness to the truth depend only on reference and not on\nsense. Two terms can differ in sense yet share the same reference, and\ncorrespondingly two sentences may relate to one another as regards\ntruth without their sharing terms with the same sense. And so even if\nwe retain a holism about the sense of theoretical terms and allow that\nrevolutions lead to shifts in sense, there is no direct inference from\nthis to a shift in reference. Consequently, there is no inference to\nthe inadmissibility of the comparison of theories with respect to\ntheir truth-nearness.\nWhile this referentialist response to the incommensurability thesis\nwas initially framed in Fregean terms (Scheffler 1967), it received\nfurther impetus from the work of Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975b),\nwhich argued that reference could be achieved without anything akin to\nFregean sense and that the natural kind terms of science exemplified\nthis sense-free reference. In particular, causal theories of reference\npermit continuity of reference even through fairly radical theoretical\nchange. (They do not guarantee continuity in reference, and changes in\nreference can occur on some causal theories, e.g. Gareth Evans\u2019s\n(1973). Arguing that they do occur would require more, however, than\nmerely pointing to a change in theory.  Rather, it seems, cases of\nreference change must be identified and argued for on a case by case\nbasis.) Therefore, if taken to encompass terms for quantities and\nproperties (such as \u2018mass\u2019), the changes that Kuhn\nidentified as changes in meaning (e.g. those involved in the shift\nfrom Newtonian to relativistic physics) would not necessarily be\nchanges that bear on reference, nor, consequently, on comparison for\nnearness to the truth.  The simple causal theory of reference does\nhave its problems, such as explaining the referential mechanism of\nempty theoretical terms (e.g.caloric and phlogiston) (c.f. En\u00e7\n1976, Nola 1980). Causal-descriptive theories (which allow for a\ndescriptive component) tackle such problems while retaining the key\nidea that referential continuity is possible despite radical theory\nchange (Kroon 1985, Sankey 1994).\nOf course, the referentialist response shows only that reference\ncan be retained, not that it must be.  Consequently it is only a\npartial defence of realism against semantic incommensurability.  A\nfurther component of the defence of realism against incommensurability\nmust be an epistemic one.  For referentialism shows that a term can\nretain reference and hence that the relevant theories may be such that\nthe later constitutes a better approximation to the truth than the\nearlier.  Nonetheless it may not be possible for philosophers or\nothers to know that there has been such progress. Methodological\nincommensurability in particular seems to threaten the possibility of\nthis knowledge.  Kuhn thinks that in order to be in a position to\ncompare theories from older and more recent periods of normal science\none needs a perspective external to each and indeed any era of\nscience\u2013what he calls an \u2018Archimedean platform\u2019\n(1992, 14).  However, we never are able to escape from our current\nperspective. A realist response to this kind of incommensurability may\nappeal to externalist or naturalized epistemology.  These (related)\napproaches reject the idea that for a method to yield knowledge it\nmust be independent of any particular theory, perspective, or\nhistorical/cognitive circumstance.  So long as the method has an\nappropriate kind of reliability it can generate knowledge.  Contrary\nto the internalist view characteristic of the positivists (and, it\nappears, shared by Kuhn) the reliability of a method does not need to\nbe one that must be evaluable independently of any particular\nscientific perspective. It is not the case, for example, that the\nreliability of a method used in science must be justifiable by a\npriori means.  Thus the methods developed in one era may indeed\ngenerate knowledge, including knowledge that some previous era got\ncertain matters wrong, or right but only to a certain degree. A\nnaturalized epistemology may add that science itself is in the\nbusiness of investigating and developing methods.  As science develops\nwe would expect its methods to change and develop also.\n6.3 Kuhn and Social Science\nKuhn\u2019s influence outside of professional philosophy of science may\nhave been even greater than it was within it. The social sciences in\nparticular took up Kuhn with enthusiasm.  There are primarily two\nreasons for this.  First, Kuhn\u2019s picture of science appeared to permit\na more liberal conception of what science is than hitherto, one that\ncould be taken to include disciplines such as sociology and\npsychoanalysis.  Secondly, Kuhn\u2019s rejection of rules as determining\nscientific outcomes appeared to permit appeal to other factors,\nexternal to science, in explaining why a scientific revolution took\nthe course that it did.\nThe status as genuine sciences of what we now call the social and\nhuman sciences has widely been held in doubt.  Such disciplines lack\nthe remarkable track record of established natural sciences and seem\nto differ also in the methods they employ.  More specifically they\nfail by pre-Kuhnian philosophical criteria of sciencehood. On the one\nhand, positivists required of a science that it should be verifiable\nby reference to its predictive successes.  On the other, Popper\u2019s\ncriterion was that a science should be potentially falsifiable by a\nprediction of the theory.  Yet psychoanalysis, sociology and even\neconomics have difficulty in making precise predictions at all, let\nalone ones that provide for clear confirmation or unambiguous\nrefutation.  Kuhn\u2019s picture of a mature science as being dominated by\na paradigm that generated sui generis puzzles and criteria for\nassessing solutions to them could much more easily accommodate these\ndisciplines.  For example, Popper famously complained that\npsychoanalysis could not be scientific because it resists\nfalsification.  Kuhn\u2019s account argues that resisting falsification is\nprecisely what every disciplinary matrix in science does.\nEven disciplines that could not claim to be dominated by a settled\nparadigm but were beset by competing schools with different\nfundamental ideas could appeal to Kuhn\u2019s description of the\npre-paradigm state of a science in its infancy.  Consequently Kuhn\u2019s\nanalysis was popular among those seeking legitimacy as science (and\nconsequently kudos and funding) for their new disciplines.  Kuhn\nhimself did not especially promote such extensions of his views, and\nindeed cast doubt upon them.  He denied that psychoanalysis is a\nscience and argued that there are reasons why some fields within the\nsocial sciences could not sustain extended periods of puzzle-solving\nnormal science (1991b).  Although, he says, the natural sciences\ninvolve interpretation just as human and social sciences do, one\ndifference is that hermeneutic re-interpretation, the search for new\nand deeper intepretations, is the essence of many social scientific\nenterprises.  This contrasts with the natural sciences where an\nestablished and unchanging interpretation (e.g. of the heavens) is a\npre-condition of normal science.  Re-intepretation is the result of a\nscientific revolution and is typically resisted rather than actively\nsought. Another reason why regular reinterpretation is part of the\nhuman sciences and not the natural sciences is that social and\npolitical systems are themselves changing in ways that call for new\ninterpretations, whereas the subject matter of the natural sciences is\nconstant in the relevant respects, permitting a puzzle-solving\ntradition as well as a standing source of revolution-generating\nanomalies.\nA rather different influence on social science was Kuhn\u2019s influence\non the development of social studies of science itself, in particular\nthe \u2018Sociology of Scientific Knowledge\u2019. A central claim\nof Kuhn\u2019s work is that scientists do not make their judgments as the\nresult of consciously or unconsciously following rules.  Their\njudgments are nonetheless tightly constrained during normal science by\nthe example of the guiding paradigm.  During a revolution they are\nreleased from these constraints (though not completely).  Consequently\nthere is a gap left for other factors to explain scientific judgments.\nKuhn himself suggests in The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions that Sun worship may have made Kepler a Copernican\nand that in other cases, facts about an individual\u2019s life history,\npersonality or even nationality and reputation may play a role\n(1962/70a, 152\u20133).  Later Kuhn repeated the point, with the additional\nexamples of German Romanticism, which disposed certain scientists to\nrecognize and accept energy conservation, and British social thought\nwhich enabled acceptance of Darwinism (1977c, 325). Such suggestions\nwere taken up as providing an opportunity for a new kind of study of\nscience, showing how social and political factors external to science\ninfluence the outcome of scientific debates. In what has become known\nas social constructivism/constructionism (e.g. Pickering 1984) this\ninfluence is taken to be central, not marginal, and to extend to the\nvery content of accepted theories. Kuhn\u2019s claim and its exploitation\ncan be seen as analogous to or even an instance of the exploitation of\nthe (alleged) underdetermination of theory by evidence (c.f. Kuhn\n1992, 7).  Feminists and social theorists (e.g. Nelson 1993) have\nargued that the fact that the evidence, or, in Kuhn\u2019s case, the shared\nvalues of science, do not fix a single choice of theory, allows\nexternal factors to determine the final outcome (see Martin 1991 and\nSchiebinger 1999 for feminist social constructivism).  Furthermore,\nthe fact that Kuhn identified values as what guide judgment\nopens up the possibility that scientists ought to employ different\nvalues, as has been argued by feminist and post-colonial writers\n(e.g. Longino 1994).\nKuhn himself, however, showed only limited sympathy for such\ndevelopments. In his \u201cThe Trouble with the Historical Philosophy\nof Science\u201d (1992) Kuhn derides those who take the view that in\nthe \u2018negotiations\u2019 that determine the accepted outcome of\nan experiment or its theoretical significance, all that\ncounts are the interests and power relations among the\nparticipants. Kuhn targeted the proponents of the Strong Programme in\nthe Sociology of Scientific Knowledge with such comments; and even if\nthis is not entirely fair to the Strong Programme, it reflects Kuhn\u2019s\nown view that the primary determinants of the outcome of a scientific\nepisode are to be found within science. External history of science\nseeks causes of scientific change in social, political, religious and\nother developments of science. Kuhn sees his work as \u201cpretty\nstraight internalist\u201d (2000: 287).  First, the five values Kuhn\nascribes to all science are in his view constitutive of science.  An\nenterprise could have different values but it would not be science\n(1977c, 331; 1993, 338).  Secondly, when a scientist is influenced by\nindividual or other factors in applying these values or in coming to a\njudgment when these values are not decisive, those influencing factors\nwill typically themselves come from within science (especially in\nmodern, professionalized science). Personality may play a role in the\nacceptance of a theory, because, for example, one scientist is more\nrisk-averse than another (1977c, 325)\u2014but that is still a\nrelationship to the scientific evidence. Even when reputation plays a\npart, it is typically scientific reputation that encourages\nthe community to back the opinion of an eminent scientist.  Thirdly,\nin a large community such variable factors will tend to cancel out.\nKuhn supposes that individual differences are normally distributed and\nthat a judgment corresponding to the mean of the distribution will\nalso correspond to the judgment that would, hypothetically, be\ndemanded by the rules of scientific method, as traditionally conceived\n(1977c, 333).  Moreover, the existence of differences of response\nwithin the leeway provided by shared values is crucial to science,\nsince it permits \u201crational men to disagree\u201d (1977c, 332)\nand thus to commit themselves to rival theories.  Thus the looseness\nof values and the differences they permit \u201cmay . . . appear an\nindispensable means of spreading the risk which the introduction or\nsupport of novelty always entails\u201d (Ibid.).\n6.4 Recent Developments\nEven if Kuhn\u2019s work has not remained at the centre of the\nphilosophy of science, a number of philosophers have continued to find\nit fruitful and have sought to develop it in a number of\ndirections. Paul Hoyningen-Huene (1989/1993), as a result of working\nwith Kuhn, developed an important neo-Kantian interpretation of his\ndiscussion of perception and world-change. We may distinguish between\nthe world-in-itself and the \u2018world\u2019 of our perceptual and\nrelated experiences (the phenomenal world). This corresponds to the\nKantian distinction between noumena and phenomena. The important\ndifference between Kant and Kuhn is that Kuhn takes the general form\nof phenomena not to be fixed but changeable. A shift in paradigm can\nlead, via the theory-dependence of observation, to a difference in\none\u2019s experiences of things and thus to a change in one\u2019s phenomenal\nworld.  This change in phenomenal world articulates the sense in which\nthe world changes as a result of a scientific revolution while also\ncapturing Kuhn\u2019s claims about the theory-dependence of observation and\nconsequent incommensurability (Hoyningen-Huene 1990).\nA rather different direction in which Kuhn\u2019s thought has been\ndeveloped proposes that his ideas might be illuminated by advances in\ncognitive psychology. One the one hand work on conceptual structures\ncan help understand what might be correct in the incommensurability\nthesis (Nersessian 1987, 2003). Several authors have sought in\ndifferent ways to emphasize what they take to be the Wittgensteinian\nelement in Kuhn\u2019s thought (for example Kindi 1995, Sharrock and Read\n2002). Andersen, Barker, and Chen (1996, 1998, 2006) draw in\nparticular on Kuhn\u2019s version of Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of family\nresemblance. Kuhn articulates a view according to which the extension\nof a concept is determined by similarity to a set of exemplary cases\nrather than by an intension. Andersen, Barker, and Chen argue that\nKuhn\u2019s view is supported by the work of Rosch (1972; Rosch and Mervis\n1975) on prototypes; furthermore, this approach can be developed in\nthe context of dynamic frames (Barsalou 1992), which can then\nexplain the phenomenon of (semantic) incommensurability.\nOn the other hand, the psychology of analogical thinking and\ncognitive habits may also inform our understanding of the concept of a\nparadigm. Kuhn himself tells us that \u201cThe paradigm as shared\nexample is the central element of what I now take to be the most novel\nand least understood aspect of [The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions]\u201d (1970a, 187). Kuhn, however, failed to\ndevelop the paradigm concept in his later work beyond an early\napplication of its semantic aspects to the explanation of\nincommensurability. Nonetheless, other philosophers, principally\nHoward Margolis (1987, 1993) have developed the idea that habits of\nmind formed by training with paradigms-as-exemplars are an important\ncomponent in understanding the nature of scientific development.  As\nexplained by Nickles (2003b) and Bird (2005), this is borne out by\nrecent work by psychologists on model-based and analogical thinking.\n6.5 Assessment\nAssessing Kuhn\u2019s significance presents a conundrum.  Unquestionably\nhe was one of the most influential philosophers and historians of\nscience of the twentieth century. His most obvious achievement was to\nhave been a major force in bringing about the final demise of logical\npositivism.  Nonetheless, there is no characteristically Kuhnian\nschool that carries on his positive work.  It is as if he himself\nbrought about a revolution but did not supply the replacement\nparadigm.  For a period in the 1960s and 1970s it looked as if there\nwas a Kuhnian paradigm \u2018historical philosophy of science\u2019,\nflourishing especially in newly formed departments of history and\nphilosophy of science.  But as far as the history of science and\nscience studies more generally are concerned, Kuhn repudiated at least\nthe more radical developments made in his name.  Indeed part of Kuhn\u2019s\nfame must be due to the fact that both his supporters and his\ndetractors took his work to be more revolutionary (anti-rationalist,\nrelativist) than it really was.\nTurning to the philosophy of science, it was clear by the end of\nthe 1980s that the centreground was now occupied by a new realism, one\nthat took on board lessons from general philosophy of language and\nepistemology, in particular referentialist semantics and a belief in\nthe possibility of objective knowledge and justification.  There is\nsome irony therefore in the fact that it was the demise of logical\npositivism/empiricism that led to the rebirth of scientific realism\nalong with causal and externalist semantics and epistemology,\npositions that Kuhn rejected.\nOne way of understanding this outcome is to see that Kuhn\u2019s\nrelationship on the one hand to positivism and on the other hand to\nrealism places him in an interesting position. Kuhn\u2019s thesis of the\ntheory-dependence of observation parallels related claims by\nrealists. In the hands of realists the thesis is taken to undermine\nthe theory-observation dichotomy that permitted positivists to take an\nanti-realist attitude to theories. In the hands of Kuhn however, the\nthesis is taken, in effect, to extend anti-realism from theories to\nobservation also.  This in turn fuels the thesis of\nincommensurability. The fact that incommensurability is founded upon a\nresponse to positivism diametrically opposed to the realist response\nexplains why much of Kuhn\u2019s later philosophical work, which developed\nthe incommensurability thesis, has had little impact on the majority\nof philosophers of science.\nThe explanation of scientific development in terms of paradigms was\nnot only novel but radical too, insofar as it gives a naturalistic\nexplanation of belief-change. Naturalism was not in the early 1960s\nthe familiar part of philosophical landscape that it has subsequently\nbecome.  Kuhn\u2019s explanation contrasted with explanations in terms of\nrules of method (or confirmation, falsification etc.) that most\nphilosophers of science took to be constitutive of\nrationality. Furthermore, the relevant disciplines (psychology,\ncognitive science, artificial intelligence) were not then advanced\nenough to to support Kuhn\u2019s contentions concerning paradigms, or those\ndisciplines were antithetical to Kuhn\u2019s views (in the case of\nclassical AI). Now that naturalism has become an accepted component of\nphilosophy, there has recently been interest in reassessing Kuhn\u2019s\nwork in the light of developments in the relevant sciences, many of\nwhich provide corroboration for Kuhn\u2019s claim that science is driven by\nrelations of perceived similarity and analogy. It may yet be that a\ncharacteristically Kuhnian thesis will play a prominent part in our\nunderstanding of science.\n",
