    "main_text": "Action and Mind || Problems of Irrationality\n2.3 Problems of Irrationality\n\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the rationality of the mental as one of\nthe cornerstones of anomalous monism (as well as to the account of\n\u2018radical interpretation\u2019 [see \u2018Meaning and\nTruth\u2019 below]) led him to take a special interest in the problem\nof apparently irrational belief and action \u2013 something first\naddressed in \u2018How is Weakness of the Will\nPossible?\u2019(1970a). While Davidson treats irrationality as a real\nfeature of our mental lives, he offers a way of dealing with it that\naims at preserving, in some sense, the overall rationality of the mind\n(see especially \u2018Two Paradoxes of Irrationality\u2019 [1982b]).\nA belief or desire in the mind of one person can cause a belief or\ndesire in the mind of another without this compromising the\nrationality of the mental. (Davidson\u2019s example is my growing of\na beautiful flower because I desire you to enter my garden \u2013 you\ndevelop a craving to see the flower as a result of my desire and my\ndesire has thereby caused, without being a reason for, your craving).\nDavidson suggests that we should view the same sort of relation as\nsometimes holding within a single mind. To this end we should view the\nmind as weakly \u2018partitioned\u2019 so that different attitudes\nmay be located within different \u2018territories\u2019 and need\nnot, therefore, be taken to come into direct conflict.\n\nDavidson\u2019s thinking about irrationality was increasingly\ninfluenced by an engagement with psychoanalytic thinking. Marcia\nCavell had strong psychoanalytic interests, and in The\nPsychoanalytic Mind (Cavell 1993), she connects Davidson\u2019s\nthought directly with that of Freud.\n",
