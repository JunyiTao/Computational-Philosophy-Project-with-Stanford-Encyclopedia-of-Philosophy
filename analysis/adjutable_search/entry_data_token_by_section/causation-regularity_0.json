    "main_text": "Regularity Theories of Causation\n1. Regularity Theories of Causation\n\nThe core idea of regularity theories of causation is that causes are\nregularly followed by their effects. A genuine cause and its effect\nstand in a pattern of invariable succession: whenever the cause\noccurs, so does its effect. This regular association is to be\nunderstood by contrast to a relation of causal power or efficacy. On a\nregularity theory, a cause and its effect only instantiate a\nregularity. No causal powers are posited in virtue of which a cause\nbrings about its effect. Moreover, no metaphysical entities or\nconnections are posited which would ground the regularities in the\nworld. Causation is not conceived of as a metaphysically thick\nrelation of production, but rather as simple instantiation of\nregularity.\n",
