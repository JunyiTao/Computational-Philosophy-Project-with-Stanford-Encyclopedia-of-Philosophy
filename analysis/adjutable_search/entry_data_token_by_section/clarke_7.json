    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Matter and the Laws of Nature\n3.3 Matter and the Laws of Nature\n\nClarke steadfastly maintained that matter does not have an essential,\naccidental, or super-added power of self-motion. \u201cAll things\ndone in the world, are done either immediately by God himself, or by\ncreated intelligent beings: matter being evidently not at all capable\nof any laws or powers whatsoever.\u201d Consequently, the so called\n\u201ceffects of the natural powers of matter, and laws of motion; of\ngravitation, attraction, or the like\u201d properly speaking are but\nthe \u201ceffects of God\u2019s acting upon matter continually and\nevery moment, either immediately by himself, or mediately by some\ncreated intelligent beings.\u201d Thus, the course of nature is\n\u201cnothing else but the will of God producing certain effects in a\ncontinued, regular, constant and uniform manner which\u2026being in\nevery moment perfectly arbitrary, is as easy to be altered at any\ntime, as to be preserved\u201d (D 149, W 2.698). The laws of nature\nare thus not absolutely necessary but only morally necessary,\ncontinuing as they do only because of the unchanging will of God. (For\nmore on Clarke\u2019s theory of necessity see Yenter 2014, 265\u2013266).\n\nWith regard to the much contested interpretation of Newton on gravity,\nhe declares that Newton \u201cdoes not mean to say that attraction is the\ncause of bodies coming together; but by attraction he means to express\nthe effect\u201d (Kassler 2014; 145\u2013146). Leibniz, in his correspondence\nwith Clarke, denies this reading of Newton that makes no metaphysical\ncommitment to gravity as force, suggesting two importantly different\nreadings of Newton (Janiak 2007). While Newton would not speculate\npublicly on metaphysical matters, Clarke argued that this effect could\nnot be the work of body. Rather, God and designated (subordinate,\nintelligent, immaterial) agents, act throughout the world by being\npresent where they act, which is the explanation for gravity and all\nother movements of matter (Brown 2016, 42ff; but see Schliesser 2013,\n44 & 48 for a more modest reading).\n\nThe claim that matter has not even an accidental power of self-motion\nwas central to Clarke\u2019s attempt to exhibit the manifest activity\nof God in the Newtonian world and refute Spinozism (Schliesser 2012,\n443\u2013449). The claim was radical for the time and elicited many\nresponses. Collins, in a letter to John Trenchard, was angered and\nunimpressed by Clarke\u2019s arguments, which was a common reaction for\nthe growing number of freethinkers (Jacob 1977; 20). Andrew Baxter\n(1733, with an important appendix added in 1750) would later extend\nClarke\u2019s arguments against self-motion, showing that they apply to\nether as well as matter, at a time when ether theories had gained\npopularity as interpretations of Newton and as hypotheses for\nexplaining gravity.\n\nDespite his insistence on God\u2019s continual activity in the world,\nClarke was not, strictly, an occasionalist. Unlike the occasionalists,\nClarke does not claim that God is the real cause of interactions\nbetween finite minds and matter. Furthermore, matter has a single\n\u201cNegative Power\u201d of staying at rest or continuing\nin motion (W 2.697; Winkler 1989).\n",
