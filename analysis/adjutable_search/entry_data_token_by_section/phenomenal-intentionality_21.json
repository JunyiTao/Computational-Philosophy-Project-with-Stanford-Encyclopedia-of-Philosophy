    "main_text": "Cognitive phenomenology || Self-knowledge\n5.5 Self-knowledge\n\nPitt (2004) argues that there is a kind of self-knowledge that can\nonly be explained by cognitive phenomenology. Pitt\u2019s argument\nnot only aims to establish that there is a proprietary and\nindividuative cognitive phenomenology but also that this\nphenomenology is constitutive of thought\u2019s content,\ni.e., that thought\u2019s content is phenomenal intentional content.\n\n\nPitt\u2019s argument runs as follows: Normally, we can consciously,\nintrospectively, and non-inferentially (1) distinguish an occurrent\nthought from other mental states, (2) distinguish an occurrent thought\nfrom other occurrent thoughts, and (3) identify which occurrent\nthoughts we are thinking. Pitt considers various explanations of these\nabilities, and argues that the only plausible explanation is that\nthought has a proprietary, individuative, and constitutive\nphenomenology. Thought\u2019s proprietary phenomenology explains how\nwe can tell the difference between thoughts and other kinds of mental\nstates, thought\u2019s individuative phenomenology explains how we\ncan tell the difference between one thought and another, and\nthought\u2019s phenomenology being constitutive of its content\nexplains how we can identify which thoughts we are thinking. \n\nLevine (2011) argues that Pitt (2004) fails to rule out an alternative\nexplanation of the relevant kind of self-knowledge: immediate\nself-knowledge is a matter of non-inferentially coming to have an\nintentional state that represents that one is thinking what one is in\nfact thinking. In having such a state, one is automatically aware of\nits content. Pitt (2011) responds that, when properly understood,\nLevine\u2019s proposal can\u2019t work unless there is the contested\nkind of cognitive phenomenology. \n\nGoldman (1993a,b) also uses considerations from self-knowledge to\nargue for a phenomenology of thought. He argues that the way we can\ntell what mental states we are in is not through their functional\nroles or neural properties, but through their phenomenal properties.\nIn the case of cognitive states, the best explanation for how we can\ndiscriminate between different strengths of desires or degrees of\nbelief is that thoughts have an accompanying phenomenology. \n",
