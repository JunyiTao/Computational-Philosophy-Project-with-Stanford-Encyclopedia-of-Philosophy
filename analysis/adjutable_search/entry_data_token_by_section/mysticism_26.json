One reason is that it is\ndoubtful if many experiencers of God make truth claims solely on the\nbasis of their mystical experiences, rather than within a doxastic\npractice. For example, Teresa of Avila said that one can tell if an\nexperience comes from God or from the Devil by its fruits in actions\nand personality, the vividness of the memory of the experience,\nconformity to Christian scripture, and confirmation by church\nsuperiors. Mystical experiences as such were given no special\nauthority. Classical mystics in general did not take their mystical\nexperiences as verifying the doctrines of their basic scriptures but\nvice versa \u2014 the fundamental scriptures vouched\nfor the validity of genuine mystical experiences.\n\nIn addition, if identification of God takes place in\na holistic practice (see Sections 9.2, 9.4), then quite plausibly\nthis is a social practice in which one judges one\u2019s mystical\nexperiences to be of God.\n\nFinally, it is an open question to what extent alleged God-experiences\nare sufficiently detailed to provide grounds to the subject that they\nare of God. Hence, a subject\u2019s judgment that a\nparticular encounter is with God might well be a matter of\nassimilating the event into a larger social practice.\n",
