    "main_text": "The Paradoxes Reconsidered || The Theological Paradox\n4.7 The Theological Paradox\n\nThe solution provided by RI is straightforward: we need to state the\ndoctrine not in terms of absolute identity, but in terms of relative\nidentity. So instead of one predicate of absolute identity the\ntrinitarian creed may need two predicates of relative identity, e.g.,\nbeing the same person and being the same being (cf. van Inwagen 1988,\n2003), or, as suggested by (Anscombe and Geach 1961), being the same\nperson and being the same God. Then we may reformulate the creed as\nfollows:\n\nThe Father is a God.\nThe Son is a God.\nThe Holy Spirit is a God.\nThe Father is not the same person as the Son.\nThe Father is not the same person as the Holy Spirit.\nThe Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit.\nThere is at most one God, i.e., if \\(x\\) is a God and \\(y\\) is a\nGod, then \\(x\\) is the same being as \\(y\\).\n\n\nVan Inwagen produced a model (in the sense of formal semantics) where\nall these statements are satisfied, so under this interpretation the\ndoctrine of Trinity comes out consistent. Incidentally let me note\nthat he also gave an analogous interpretation for the doctrine of\nIncarnation (see van Inwagen 1994). For an extended discussion of the\ncoherence of this solution see the section on relative identity\ntheories in the entry on\n Trinity.\n Note that Branson (2019) provides a taxonomy of all possible\nsolutions to the paradox, including the ones that resort to relative\nidentity.\n",
