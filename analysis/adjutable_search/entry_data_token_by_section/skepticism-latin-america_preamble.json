    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry examines the development and impact of the study of\nphilosophical skepticism throughout Latin America. It also highlights\nsome significant trends and important contributions made to this\nvenerable tradition by a number of Latin American philosophers.\n\nSkepticism is a philosophical activity of investigation characterized\nby the notion of suspension of judgment. Whereas dogmatists affirm or\ndeny a proposition on a given philosophical topic, skeptics neither\naffirm nor deny any proposition, i. e., they remain uncommitted to any\ndogmatic doctrine. According to skeptics, the basic opposition in\nphilosophy is that between those who endorse a philosophical theory\nand those who, after having inquired into the truth, did not find an\nanswer to the questions under examination. That is why skepticism came\nto be seen by dogmatic philosophers as a major challenge to their\nphilosophical project of finding the truth. Epistemologists and\nmetaphysicians alike set themselves the task of overcoming skepticism\nin order to establish their own doctrines. Thus, one constantly finds\ndogmatic philosophers trying to refute the skeptic. One criterion to\naccept a philosophical proposal is to determine to what extent it\novercomes the skeptical challenge.\n\nIn ancient times, skepticism had two main different forms: Pyrrhonism\nand Academic skepticism. Rediscovered in the Renaissance, skepticism\nbecame one of the pillars of modern philosophy, not only after modern\nskeptics, such as Michel de Montaigne, Pierre Bayle and David Hume,\ngave new impulse to it, but also because of the many answers to it\ndeveloped by philosophers such as Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9\nDescartes, George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. In the analytic\ntradition, from G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell onwards, skepticism\nis a central topic of concern. This surprisingly long history shows\nnot only how deep is the skeptical challenge, but also how fascinating\nthe skeptical stance turns out to be.\n\nSimilarly to philosophers in many other parts of the world, Latin\nAmerican philosophers have faced skeptical challenges and have devoted\nclose attention to skepticism. They adopt, by and large, the same\nunderstanding of skepticism, share the same historical tradition, from\nPyrrho to contemporary analytic philosophy, that philosophers\nelsewhere have engaged with, and carry out the same kind of research\nas scholars all over the world do. What is specific about Latin\nAmerican scholars on skepticism is the fact that they are, in general,\nmore sympathetic toward skepticism than philosophers elsewhere tend to\nbe. Consequently, one finds not only studies on the history of\nskepticism and philosophical criticisms, but also developments of new\nforms of skepticism, which are worth considering with some care.\n",
