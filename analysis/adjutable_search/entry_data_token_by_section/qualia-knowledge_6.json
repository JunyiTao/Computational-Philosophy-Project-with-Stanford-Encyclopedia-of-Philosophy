    "main_text": "Objections || Complete Physical Knowledge without Knowledge of all the Physical Facts\n4.2 Complete Physical Knowledge without Knowledge of all the Physical Facts\n\nIt may appear obvious that premise P1 (Mary has complete physical\nknowledge about human color vision) implies C1 (Mary knows all the\nphysical facts about human color vision). If all physical facts can be\nknown under some physical conceptualization, then a person who has\ncomplete physical knowledge about a topic knows all the relevant\nphysical facts. But a few philosophers can be understood as objecting\nagainst precisely this apparently unproblematic step. Harman (1990)\nargues that Mary does not know all the functional facts concerning\nhuman color vision because she lacks the concept of what it is for an\nobject to be red, blue, etc. Flanagan (1992) distinguishes\nmetaphysical physicalism from linguistic\nphysicalism. While metaphysical physicalism is the ontological\nclaim that there are no non-physical individuals, properties or\nrelations and no non-physical facts, linguistic physicalism says that\n\u201ceverything physical can be expressed or captured in the\nlanguages of the physical sciences.\u201d According to Flanagan\nMary\u2019s case may refute linguistic physicalism but does not refute\nmetaphysical physicalism. Alter (1998) points out that the knowledge\nargument needs the premise that all physical facts can be learned\ndiscursively and argues that this assumption has not been established.\nIt may be argued against this view that it becomes hard to understand\nwhat it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the\nassumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those\nproperties and facts that can be expressed in physical\nterminology.\n",
