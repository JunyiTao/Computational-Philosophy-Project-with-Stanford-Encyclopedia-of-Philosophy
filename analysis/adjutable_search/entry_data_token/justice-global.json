The study of justice has been concerned with what we owe one\nanother, what obligations we might have to treat each other fairly in\na range of domains, including over distributive and recognitional\nmatters. Contemporary political philosophers had focused their\ntheorizing about justice almost exclusively within the state, but the\nlast twenty-five years or so has seen a marked extension to the global\nsphere, with a huge expansion in the array of topics covered. While\nsome, such as matters of just conduct in war, have long been of\nconcern, others are more recent and arise especially in the context of\ncontemporary phenomena like intensified globalization, economic\nintegration, and potentially catastrophic pandemics and anthropogenic\nclimate change.\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s seminal book The Law of Peoples initiated\nmany debates about global justice (Rawls 1999). Several questions soon\nbecame prominent in discussions including: What principles should\nguide international action? What responsibilities do we have to the\nglobal poor? Should global inequality be morally troubling? Are there\ntypes of non-liberal people who should be tolerated? What kind of\nforeign policy is consistent with liberal values? Is a\n\u201crealistic utopia\u201d possible in the global domain? How\nmight we transition effectively towards a less unjust world?\n\nContemporary events also played an enormous role in prompting\nphilosophical inquiries. Prominent cases of genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, forms of terrorism uncommon prior to 2001, intensified\ninterest in immigration to affluent countries, increased dependence on\nthe labor of those from low-income countries, and enormous threats to\nwell-being, security and the environment became common catalysts for\nfurther work. Philosophers began to reflect on questions such as: Is\nit ever permissible to engage in coercive military action for\nhumanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or prevent large-scale\nviolations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be justified? Should\naffluent countries open their borders more generously than they\ncurrently do to those from low-income countries who would like to\nimmigrate to them? Are our current global economic arrangements fair\nones and if not, how should they be transformed? What responsibilities\ndo we have to one another in a globalized, post-Westphalian world\norder? How should we allocate responsibilities for reducing global\ninjustice in our world, such as in the case of distributing costs\nassociated with addressing climate change?\n\nIncreased interest concerning issues of global justice also coincided\nwith enhanced interest in the place and value of nationalism. These\nexplorations tracked events such as nationalist clashes which spilled\nover into widespread suffering (notably in the former Yugoslavia and\nRwanda), increased calls for national self-determination to carry\nconsiderable weight, such as in state recognition for Palestinians or\nTibetans, and also in the case of secession (prominently, Quebec). In\nthis area global justice theorists have been concerned with a range of\nimportant questions such as: Under what conditions should claims to\nnational self-determination be granted substantial weight? When should\nself-determination yield to concern for protecting human rights? Are\ncommitments to nationalism and global justice compatible? Is genuine\ndemocracy only possible at the state level or are there robust forms\nof democracy that are possible in more international fora? How are\nideals of democracy best incorporated into defensible global\ninstitutional arrangements? Is world justice possible without a world\nstate? In recent years reflection on existential threats like climate\nchange, war, and pandemics and how perspectives of the oppressed might\ninform the future of the sub-discipline, have contributed new\ndimensions to answering core questions along with adding central\nquestions within the field.\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to give an orientation to the\nenormous and rapidly expanding field of global justice. There are\nseveral entries in this encyclopedia that already cover some of the\ncore topics well and these will be cross-referenced. But there are\nstill many important gaps, along with some missing context as to how\nsome topics fit together. This entry aims primarily to address these\nneeds.\n", "toc": [{"#SomeDefiIssu": "1.

Some Definitional Issues\n1.1 Global and International Justice\n\nA distinction is often drawn between global and\ninternational justice. The key point of difference between\nthese two notions involves clarifying the entities among which justice\nis sought. In international justice the nation or state is taken as\nthe central entity of concern and justice among nations or states is\nthe focus. In the domain of global justice, by contrast, theorists do\nnot seek primarily to define justice between states or nations. Rather\nthey drill down through the state shell and inquire about what justice\nrequires among human beings. Global justice inquiries take individual\nhuman beings as of primary concern and seek to give an account of what\nfairness among such agents involves. There are several types of\nactions that cut across states or involve different agents,\nrelationships, and structures that might be invisible in an inquiry\nseeking justice among states exclusively. Many different kinds of\ninteractions are not circumscribed by state membership and yet can\nimportantly affect human beings\u2019 most fundamental interests, so\nasking the question about what individual human beings owe one another\noften uncovers significant neglected features of relationships and\nstructures that are of normative concern. Global justice analyses are\nnot precluded from yielding state-level obligations; indeed, they\ntypically do. However, they consider a wider array of possible agents\nand organizations that might have duties as well.\n\nThere are advantages associated with both types of inquiries. An\nimportant advantage of asking what states owe one another is that much\ninternational law presupposes the states system and requires states to\nperform various actions to promote justice. In this way,\nresponsibilities often appear to be clearly allocated to particular\nparties thus making it quite precise who ought to do what in our\nactual world. One advantage of global justice inquiries is that we are\nnot forced to take states as a fixed constraint and we can therefore\nconsider a range of relevant relationships, capacities and roles that\nalso structure our interactions and might be relevant to how we ought\nto conceptualize global responsibilities. While asking about what\nindividuals owe each other may well have implications for states and\ntheir obligations, a range of other agents and institutions may also\nhave relevant justice obligations. These responsibilities can become\nmore visible when we explore what individuals owe each other. The two\napproaches have different strengths and can complement each other, but\nin contemporary debate they are often taken as rivals competing to\nprovide the most plausible framework.\n\nFor further discussion of international justice, see the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n1.2 What is a Theory of Global Justice?\n\nIn general, a theory of global justice aims to give us an account of\nwhat justice on a global scale consists in and this often includes\ndiscussion of the following components:\n\nidentifying what should count as important problems of global\njustice\npositing solutions to each identified problem\nidentifying who might have responsibilities in addressing the\ntarget problem\narguing for positions about what particular agents (or collections\nof agents) ought to do in connection with solving each problem\nand\nproviding a normative view which grounds (1)\u2013(4).\n\n\nTheories of global justice aim to help us understand our world better\nand what our responsibilities are in it. While some theorists aim\npurely at theoretical understanding, others hope also to provide an\nanalysis that can be useful in practical policy making concerning\nglobal justice matters.\n1.3 When is a Problem a Global Justice Problem?\n\nProblems of global justice arise when one (or more) of the following\nconditions obtain:\n\nActions stemming from an agent, institution, practice, activity\n(and so on) that can be traced to one (or more) states negatively\naffect residents in another state.\nInstitutions, practices, policies, activities (and so on) in one\n(or more) states could bring about a benefit or reduce harm to those\nresident in another state.\nThere are normative considerations that require agents in one\nstate to take certain actions with respect to agents or entities in\nanother. Such actions might be mediated through institutions,\npolicies, or norms.\nWe cannot solve a problem that affects residents of one or more\nstates without co-operation from other states.\n\n\nSo, in general, a problem is one of global justice when the problem\neither affects agents resident in more than one state or the problem\nis unresolvable without their co-operation. For the problem to be\nconsidered genuinely global rather than regional it should affect more\nthan one regional area.\n2. Principles to Guide Behavior in International and Global Matters\n\nWhat sorts of duties of justice, if any, exist among human beings who\ndo not reside in the same country? If there are such duties, what\ngrounds them? Some argue that John Rawls\u2019s principles developed\nfor the case of domestic justice, notably, the Fair Equality of\nOpportunity Principle or the Difference Principle, should apply\nglobally (Beitz 1999; Caney 2005a; Moellendorf 2002). Others maintain\nthat the content of our duties to one another is best explored by\nexamining alternative concepts not featured in the Rawlsian corpus,\nsuch as capabilities or human rights (Nussbaum 2006; Pogge 2008;\nNussbaum 2015).\n\nMuch discussion about what we owe one another in the global context is\ninfluenced by the work of John Rawls, so a short synopsis is needed to\nsituate debates. Since discussion of these issues is amply covered in\nthe entries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n John Rawls,\n this will be a compressed summary focusing only on the most central\naspects of the debate that have a bearing on core topics of global\njustice.\n2.1 The Influence of Rawls\u2019s Law of Peoples\n\nIn The Law of Peoples, John Rawls argues for eight principles\nthat he believes should regulate international interactions of\npeoples. For Rawls, a \u201cpeople\u201d is constituted by a group\nof persons who have in common sufficient characteristics such as\nculture, history, tradition, or sentiment. Rawls uses the term\n\u201cpeople\u201d in ways that relevantly correspond with how many\nuse the term \u201cnation\u201d. In addition, Rawls often assumes\nthat, for the most part, each people has a state.\n\nThe eight principles Rawls endorses acknowledge peoples\u2019\nindependence and equality, that peoples have the right to\nself-determination along with having duties of non-intervention, that\nthey ought to observe treaties, honor a particular list of human\nrights, should conduct themselves in certain appropriate ways if they\nengage in warfare, and that they have duties to assist other peoples\nin establishing institutions to enable people\u2019s\nself-determination. He also advocates for international institutions\ngoverning trade, borrowing, and other international matters that are\ncharacteristically dealt with by the United Nations.\n\nSeveral claims have been the subject of much debate between critics\nand defenders of Rawls\u2019s position. In particular, Rawls believes\nthat so long as all peoples have a set of institutions that enable\ncitizens to lead decent lives, any global inequality that might remain\nis not morally troubling. Critics draw attention to the ways in which\nglobal inequality \u2013 perhaps in levels of power or affluence\n\u2013 can convert into opportunities for deprivation and\ndisadvantage. For instance, the global advantaged can use their\nsuperior position to influence the rules that govern international\ninstitutions \u2013 such as trade practices \u2013 which can\nfacilitate further opportunities for increased advantage and so they\ncan indeed threaten the abilities of others in distant lands to lead\ndecent lives (Pogge\n 2008).[1]\n\nAnother important issue that underlies debate between Rawls and his\ncritics concerns different views about the nature and origins of\nprosperity. Rawls gives a particularly strong statement of what he\ntakes the causes of prosperity to be. He claims that the causes of the\nwealth of a people can be traced to the domestic political culture,\nthe virtues and vices of leaders, and the quality of domestic\ninstitutions. He says:\n\nI believe that the causes of the wealth of a people and the forms it\ntakes lie in their political culture and in the religious,\nphilosophical, and moral traditions that support the basic structure\nof their political and social institutions, as well as in the\nindustriousness and cooperative talents of its members \u2026 The\ncrucial elements that make the difference are the political culture,\nthe political virtues and civic society of the country (Rawls 1999,\n108).\n\n\nCritics observe that in addition to local factors, there are also\ninternational ones which play an important role in prospects for\nwell-being. Thomas Pogge prominently helps bring some of these into\nview. The international borrowing and resource privileges, are good\nexamples of the ways in which international practices can have\nprofound effects on domestic factors which undeniably also play a role\nin promoting prosperity. According to the international borrowing\nprivilege, governments may borrow amounts of money on behalf of the\ncountry and the country thereby incurs an obligation to repay the\ndebt. The international resource privilege refers to a\ngovernment\u2019s ability to do what it likes with resources,\nincluding selling them to whomever it chooses to and at what price.\nAny group that exercises effective power in a state is internationally\nrecognized as the legitimate government of that territory and enjoys\nthe two privileges. But, Pogge argues, this sets up undesirable\nincentives that hamper developing countries\u2019 abilities to\nflourish (Pogge 2008). These include incentivizing those strongly\nmotivated to hold office for material gain to take power by force or\nexercise it in ways that help reinforce oppressive governments\u2019\nabilities to retain control. The global advantaged benefit greatly\nfrom these privileges and so have little incentive to reform them.\nBut, according to Pogge, reforms are sorely needed. If only\nsufficiently legitimate governments are able to enjoy these\nprivileges, the international community would remove one important\nobstacle developing countries currently face.\n\nDefenders of Rawls\u2019s views argue that his position is more\ncomplex than is commonly acknowledged and allows for both a principled\nstance on some fundamental values along with appropriate openness to\nalternative ways in which legitimate and decent peoples might organize\ntheir collective lives (Reidy 2004; Freeman 2006). They argue that\nRawls\u2019s position shows great sensitivity to a number of factors\nthat must be weighed in considering right conduct in international\naffairs. For instance, when Rawls makes his bold claims about the\ncauses of wealth it is useful to bear in mind the context in which he\nis arguing. Against an assumption that resources are enormously\nimportant for a society\u2019s ability to flourish, Rawls emphasizes\nthe importance of strong institutions, political culture and other\nlocal factors, in sustaining decent lives for citizens. Rawls also\nreflects on the difficulty of changing political culture, noting that\nsimply transferring resources will not help. Interestingly, in a\nlittle discussed passage, Rawls ventures that an \u201cemphasis on\nhuman rights may work to change ineffective regimes and the conduct of\nrulers who have been callous about the well-being of their own\npeople\u201d (Rawls 1999, 109). For more on whether Rawls provides us\nwith a cogent model that can provide sage guidance in international\nmatters see the entries on on\n international distributive justice\n and\n John Rawls.\n See also Martin and Reidy (2006). For the purposes of this entry we\nneed only summarize some key questions that were influential in\nsetting the terms of discussion about global justice for some\ntime.\n\nSome key questions are:\n\nWhat principles should govern interactions among peoples at the\nglobal level?\nWhat are the causes of prosperity and are they traceable entirely\nto domestic factors or are international considerations relevant?\nWhat should count as the kind of prosperity or well-being that we\nare aiming to promote?\nDo we have an obligation to ensure people have their basic needs\nmet and can otherwise lead \u201cdecent\u201d lives, or should we be\nmore concerned with global socio-economic equality?\nWhat duties do we have to those peoples who do not yet have what\nthey need for self-determination or prosperity?\nIf human rights serve an important role in world affairs, which\nrights should be on our list of those to endorse? What duties arise\nfrom such commitment?\nCan we properly hold nations to be entirely responsible for the\nwell-being of their people and if so, in what kinds of conditions\nmight this make sense? How do we encourage nations to take\nresponsibility for their people\u2019s well-being?\nWhen we consider what we owe one another, do compatriots deserve\nspecial consideration?\n\n\nWe trace some of the influential positions that have shaped answers to\nthese questions next.\n2.2 What Global Duties Do We Have?\n\nOne of the most visible and large-scale contemporary global justice\nproblems we face is that of global poverty. What ought we to do for\nthe 1 billion or so people who currently live in poverty? This is a\nhuge area nicely canvassed in the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n A few seminal arguments deserve mention here as well, however. In a\nclassic argument Peter Singer describes a so-called easy rescue case\nin which an infant is drowning in a shallow pond. You happen by and\ncan save the child with minimal effort and inconvenience on your part.\nSinger argues that you would be obligated to assist using the\nprinciple that when it is in our power to prevent something bad from\nhappening without sacrificing anything significant or comparable, it\nis wrong not to prevent the bad from occurring. So, Singer argues that\nwe have extensive duties to assist needy others, whether they be\ngeographically proximate or not. We have extensive duties to assist\nthe global poor who, with equally minimal effort on our part, can be\nsaved from dire circumstances, since the same principle applies in\nboth cases (Singer 1972). (For more treatment see Unger 1996 and for\ncriticism see Lichtenberg 2013).\n\nThomas Pogge offers another influential contribution in World\nPoverty and Human Rights. He argues that since developed\ncountries impose a coercive global order on the poor that foreseeably\nand avoidably causes great harm, they have important responsibilities\nto reform the global order such that it ceases to do so and instead\nbetter secures human rights (Pogge 2002, 2008, 2010). We harm the\nglobal poor when we collaborate in imposing an unjust global\ninstitutional order on them and, moreover, that order is unjust when\nit foreseeably perpetuates large-scale human rights deficits that can\nreasonably be avoided were we to make quite feasible institutional\nmodifications (Pogge 2002, 2008, 2010). We also harm the poor when we\ndeprive them of their resources and through a shared and violent\nhistory (Pogge 2008). While Singer emphasizes our capacity to assist\nwith need satisfaction, Pogge emphasizes instead our contributions to\nthe problem as grounding our duties.\n\nWhen discussing our duties to one another there is also vigorous\ndebate about what the content and target of our duties should be,\nalong with discussion about what are the best ways to discharge these.\nTraditional dominant economic approaches to promoting prosperity have\nfocused on raising income levels or increasing Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP). Railing against such approaches, Amartya Sen suggested that the\ncapabilities approach provides an improved measure of well-being and\nconstitutes a better way to capture changes in people\u2019s\ncondition over time (Sen 1980). Exploring what people are able to do\nand be provides a more appropriate standard by which to evaluate\nwhether their condition has improved rather than focusing exclusively\non their incomes or per capita GDP. Martha Nussbaum develops this\napproach and argues for a list of ten capabilities that should be\nsecured for all people in all places. This universal list can provide\nan important tool in persuading governments to make reforms conducive\nto their citizens\u2019 flourishing. (See the entry on\n the capability approach\n for more.) Another important discourse for discussing duties is that\nof human rights which is discussed in\n Section 2.4\n below. Before we continue it is important to mention that there are\nmany possible ways to understand the content of our duties to one\nanother. (For more see entries on\n egalitarianism,\n equality,\n sufficiency,\n capability theory,\n well-being,\n and\n needs in moral and political philosophy).\n The issue of our duties to one another is a vast topic and we\ncontinue to discuss it throughout this entry. This section serves only\nas an introduction.\n2.3 Cosmopolitanism, Duties to Non-Compatriots, and Compatriots\n\nWhen considering what we owe one another, are compatriots special? Do\nwe have the same duties to non-compatriots as we have to compatriots\nor is there some principled way in which these two sets of duties\nought to differ?\n\nNationalists argue that we belong to national communities and any\naccount of our global responsibilities that ignores this omits an\nimportant aspect of how we relate \u2013 and ought to relate \u2013\nto one another. They argue that nations can provide a valuable\ngrounding for social attachment, identity and meaning in life, and can\nground special obligations to strengthen national life and assist\nco-nationals (Miller 1995; Tamir 1993; Lenard 2012). Others defend the\nvalue of nationalism on instrumental grounds; there is nothing\ninherently special about our co-national relationships but state\nboundaries are useful in assigning important duties to particular\nagents (Goodin 1998). In a world of great unmet need, paying special\nattention to one\u2019s co-nationals can be justified (Goodin 1998;\nLenard\n 2012).[2]\n\nIn the words of Diogenes, widely credited as the first person to\npropound cosmopolitan views, cosmopolitans see themselves as\n\u201ccitizens of the world\u201d. Contemporary cosmopolitans\ntypically hold that every human being has standing as an ultimate unit\nof moral concern and is entitled to equal consideration of her\ninterests no matter what other affiliations, especially national\naffiliations, she might have. Drawing on the idea that we all have\nequal moral worth, cosmopolitans seek to broaden our moral horizons so\nthat we do not forget about the responsibilities we have to others\nbeyond state borders, even when we have local responsibilities as\nwell.\n\nProminent cosmopolitans frequently offer accounts that feature\ndifferent elements. Martha Nussbaum emphasizes that, as human beings,\nwe belong to a global community of human persons (Nussbaum 1996).\nNussbaum argues that while love for one\u2019s country might have a\nlegitimate place in people\u2019s conceptions of a good life, we\nshould not overlook the many other relationships we are in which\nconnect us to others in the world. We need to draw the global\ncommunity in closer to the local one, and, more generally, aim to see\nourselves as members of overlapping communities which also have\nimportant claims on us.\n\nBy contrast, Thomas Pogge focuses on the implications of\ncosmopolitanism for the global institutional order. We need to ensure\nthat global institutional structures give equal consideration to\neveryone\u2019s interests. He says, \u201cInsofar as human agents\nare involved in the design or administration of global rules,\npractices, or organizations, they ought to disregard their private and\nlocal, including national, commitments and loyalties to give equal\nconsideration to the needs and interests of every human being on this\nplanet\u201d (Pogge 2013, 298). This equal-consideration-of-interests\nrequirement only applies to such contexts. While such impartiality\nnorms are perfectly familiar within the state, for instance, when\njudges operate in law courts, we have yet to realize the requirement\nat the global level.\n\nIt is often assumed that cosmopolitanism must necessarily be in\ntension with more local attachments to friends, family or compatriots.\nSome cosmopolitans believe such conflict is inevitable, unproblematic\nand a necessary part of understanding what cosmopolitanism entails\n(Ypi 2013a). Others argue for different ways in which the apparent\ntensions could be resolved (Pogge 2013; Tan 2004; Appiah 2007; Cabrera\n2020). As we see above, Pogge emphasizes the clear separation of\nspheres in which equal consideration of people\u2019s interests\napplies. Kok-Chor Tan offers a similar argument. His strategy is to\nshow that cosmopolitan principles should govern global institutional\nstructures that ensure people are treated as equals in their\nentitlements (Tan 2004). When this is the case there can be a\nlegitimate role for patriotism that operates within such constraints.\nPartiality to co-nationals need not conflict with cosmopolitan\nobligations. Another notable strategy is to argue that we cannot\nachieve justice at a national level unless we attend to justice at a\nglobal level. On this view, we have at least instrumental reasons to\ncare about global justice, even if we care deeply about social justice\nin our nation (Banai; Ronzoni and Schemmel 2011; Ronzoni 2013).\n\nThere is an important debate among egalitarian theorists about whether\nour concern with equality should be confined to members of the same\nstate or whether it should extend to all globally. Some theorists\nargue that careful consideration of notions such as reciprocity,\ncoercion, or fair terms of co-operation mandate that we give special\nweighting to the interests of compatriots (Blake 2013). Others, by\ncontrast, argue that these concerns, when properly understood, point\nin the direction of equally strong duties to non-compatriots. One form\nof the argument that we have special duties to compatriots that are\nnot shared with non-compatriots, draws on the coercive legal structure\nthat applies within states and claims that such coercive structures do\nnot apply outside of them (R. Miller 1998; Blake 2001). Another highly\ninfluential version claims that there is a difference in the authority\nto enforce justice within and outside the state (Nagel 2005). There\nare many important challenges to such positions. One important line of\nargument maintains that coercion is indeed relevant in triggering\nduties of egalitarian justice, but since this is rampant at the global\nlevel it activates global not just national egalitarian duties (Cohen\nand Sabel 2006; Abizadeh 2007; Valentini 2012). So, the same\ningredients Nagel identifies as crucial in generating state authority\nexist at the global level as well (Cohen and Sabel 2006). Nicole\nHassoun argues that there are many coercive international institutions\nand that, to be legitimate, these institutions must ensure that\neveryone they subject to coercive rules can secure what they need to\nconsent or object to these rules. This requires adequate food, water,\nshelter, education, healthcare and the social and emotional support\nthey require for sufficient autonomy (Hassoun 2012). Laura Valentini\nsuggests coercion requires freedom as independence (non-domination)\nbut this does not require egalitarianism in the global sphere. Rather,\na just global order would be inclusive, not oppressive (Tan 2013, 25).\nOthers provide novel ways of defending cosmopolitan egalitarian\ntheories or combining them with statist commitments. Pablo Gilabert\narticulates a contractualist theory of egalitarian justice that\ngenerates positive obligations to eradicate severe poverty globally\neven without robust international institutions or cosmopolitan\nsolidarity (2012). Similarly, Lea Ypi defends a statist\ncosmopolitanism that stresses the importance of political obligations\nto support cosmopolitan ends. She suggests a significant degree of\nequality is important for helping everyone secure a basic minimum and\ncultural resources, a sense of justice, and education can help promote\nthis equality (Ypi 2012; on education and global justice, in\nparticular, see Culp 2020a). Ypi sees fostering the commitment to\ncosmopolitan ideals as a political, as well as moral, task (Ypi\n2013a).\n\nOnce again, these are vast topics and more treatment can be found\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia, such as the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n For comprehensive treatment of nationalism and cosmopolitanism see\nthe entries on\n nationalism\n and\n cosmopolitanism,\n respectively.\n2.4 Human Rights Fulfillment\n\nDiscussion of global justice matters often invokes concern for human\nrights. In fact, for all their differences, both nationalists and\ncosmopolitans frequently agree that a good way to think about some of\nour duties to one another is via human rights. Human rights can and do\ntherefore serve as an important discourse for furthering discussion\nabout our global responsibilities.\n\nRespecting human rights is an important requirement in much\ninternational law and can be a key criterion in evaluating whether\ngovernments are considered legitimate by the international community.\nThe United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a highly\ninfluential account of all human beings\u2019 basic entitlements and\nthis document often plays an important role in real world debates\nabout justice matters. See the comprehensive entry on\n human rights\n for more detail. Here we have space to discuss only two issues that\nhave been prominent in debates about global justice.\n\nThe first concerns the kinds of duties we have in relation to human\nrights. Against a conventional view widespread before 1980, Henry Shue\nargues that if rights to physical security are basic, so are rights to\nsubsistence (Shue 1980). A careful analysis of the duties associated\nwith human rights indicates that the commonly held distinction between\npositive and negative duties cannot be maintained. All rights have a\nrange of both positive and negative duties associated with them.\n\nThe second prominent issue concerns whether our failures in relation\nto fulfilling human rights amount to rights violations. Thomas Pogge\n(2008) offers an influential account of duties with respect to human\nrights. Our current global order perpetuates global poverty on a\nmassive scale, but since feasible reforms to that order could avert\nthis harm, our failure to make reforms not only implicates us in the\nmisery but also in the violation of the rights of the\n poor.[3]\n We therefore have extensive obligations to reform our global order so\nthat the rights of the poor can be fulfilled.\n\nMany theorists have done important work on a range of issues\nconcerning human rights and international obligations (Buchanan 2004;\nHessler 2005; Nickel 2007; Beitz 2009; Holder and Reidy 2013; Song\n2019). Theorists have also focused attention on particular rights,\nprominently the right to health (Wolff 2013). Some important questions\ninclude: What are human rights\u2019 grounds or can they be defined\nby their functions? Are human rights properly moral or\npolitical/legal? Does respect for rights conflict with community\nobligations or respect for culture? What is the proper role of human\nrights in morality, law, and policy? How should we best understand the\nnormative implications of our contemporary human rights practice?\n(Wolff 2013; Cruft, Liao, and Renzo 2015; Gilabert 2019; Etinson 2018;\nO\u2019Neill 2005; Beitz 2009; Brock 2023).\n\nFor more treatment of issues, especially concerning what human rights\nare, which rights are rightly construed as human rights, and how human\nrights function in international law, see the entry on\n human rights.\n3. The Proper Use of Force, Military Intervention, and its Aftermath\n3.1 War and Just Conduct\n\nWithin the field of global justice, issues concerning war have one of\nthe longest histories. The just war framework has been influential in\nsetting the terms of much debate about the proper use of force in\ninternational affairs. Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\noffered some of the earliest accounts of the criteria that should be\nmet for war to be justified. Two areas have been especially thoroughly\nstudied: (1) the conditions under which entry into the war is\njustified (Jus Ad Bellum) and (2) the conditions for fair conduct\nwithin the war (Jus In Bello). While having a just cause is standardly\nheld to be a necessary condition for a war to be justified, it is not\nsufficient. Theorists often disagree about which additional conditions\nmust be satisfied for a war to be characterized as a just war. The\nmost common additional conditions proposed are that the war should be\nundertaken by a proper authority, with the right intentions, when the\nwar would follow requirements of proportionality (the ends to be\nsecured would warrant going to war), only as a last resort, and when\nthere are reasonable prospects of success. On traditional accounts of\njust war theory all conditions must be met, while several theorists\nchallenge whether they are all necessary (Mellow 2006; Moellendorf\n2002; Walzer 1983).\n\nOnce the fighting begins two central principles guide evaluation of\nwhether the war is being conducted fairly: one which respects the\ndistinction between combatants and noncombatants (The Principle of\nNon-Combatant Immunity) and another that governs what counts as the\nproportional use of force (Proportionality). On the first, it is not\nlegitimate to use force against civilians and, even though some\ncollateral civilian damage may occur, it is wrong to deliberately\ntarget non-combatants. On the second, combatants may only use the\nforce necessary to achieve their ends \u2013 the force used must be\nproportional to the ends that are to be secured in conducting the war.\nThere are further requirements governing fairness, such as\nrequirements to comply with international laws and treat prisoners\nfairly, but the two featured principles are the most commonly invoked\nin normative analyses of Jus In Bello.\n\nThe third part of just war theory (Jus Post Bellum) concerns\nhow the war concludes and the transition back to a situation of peace\n(Bass 2004, Rodin 2008). It deals with issues such as compensation,\npunishment, and reform (Ohlin 2014). A fourth component has been\nsuggested especially in light of engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan\nin the years 2001\u20132011, namely, justice in exiting the war\n(Jus Ex Bello), which concerns when it is appropriate to end\na war (Moellendorf 2008; Rodin 2008).\n\nThere are many contemporary global justice issues concerning the\nappropriate use of force (and its aftermath) that currently command\nattention including: Is drone warfare (or any kind of warfare)\npermissible? Can terrorism ever be justified? Are \u201ctargeted\nassassinations\u201d (where leaders who are primarily responsible for\ndecisions to go to war are targeted for assassination) justifiable?\nMay we engage in a war in order to prevent an anticipated \u201cworse\nwar\u201d? Is torture to contain major global threats permissible? Is\nthe attempt to contain nuclear weapons development by those who have\nthem already fraught with hypocrisy? How should we deal best with\nsocieties in a state of transitional justice? Is there a place for\n\u201cTruth and Reconciliation Committees\u201d (Walker 2006)? When\nare political apologies for historic injustice in warfare appropriate?\nSome suggest that the changing nature of combat has fundamentally\naltered the ethics of war, for instance emphasizing how individuals\ncan be held morally accountable for their participation and actions\ncontributing to unjust wars (Ryan 1983; McMahan 2009; Pfaffe 2020;\nOhlin 2014; Reitan 2018). Scholars also consider different ways to\nengage in defensible non-militaristic international reform\ninterventions (Rafanelli 2021).\n\nHere we consider very briefly only two further issues that continue to\nattract widespread current interest in the global justice literature:\nHumanitarian Intervention and Terrorism. See the entry on\n terrorism\n for an extended analysis of such questions. See the entry on\n war\n for a comprehensive overview of issues concerning justice in war.\n3.2 Humanitarian Intervention\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, may we engage in military intervention\naimed at stopping genocide? In recent years this issue has become\nsalient as large-scale human rights violations and suffering unfolded\nin Rwanda, the Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Libya. Against the\ntraditional understanding that respecting state sovereignty requires\nnon-interference, successful arguments were marshaled that there are\nimportant responsibilities to protect the vulnerable (International\nCommission on Intervention and State Sovereignty 2001). Leaning\nheavily on the conventional conditions contained in the just war\nframework, the International Commission on Intervention and State\nSovereignty argued that we may engage in war aimed at protecting those\nwho suffer at the hands of governments unwilling or unable to stop\nlarge-scale human rights abuses. The commission produced an\ninfluential report \u201cThe Responsibility to Protect\u201d which\nwas accepted by the United Nations in 2005, and the principles\ncontained in the report have guided decisions about cases, such as\nLibya in 2011 and Syria in 2012. One frequently voiced concern about\nhumanitarian interventions is whether they are just another form of\nimperialism. How will interveners be held accountable for their\nactions? Taking such concerns seriously Allen Buchanan and Robert\nKeohane advocate for a series of innovative mechanisms of\naccountability, both before and after the proposed intervention takes\nplace, to allay fears about abuse (Buchanan and Keohane 2004).\n3.3 Terrorism\n\nWhat kinds of violence count as terrorism? Is there a difference\nbetween state terrorism and that perpetrated by insurgent\norganizations? Might terrorism be justified under certain\ncircumstances? Terrorism centrally involves either using or\nthreatening to use violence against people, commonly taken to be\ninnocent, in order to produce results that would not otherwise occur\n(Coady and O\u2019Keefe 2002; Primoratz 2013). Some challenge that\nthe targets are innocent. As terrorists often point out about citizen\ncomplicity in atrocities, citizens pay taxes and vote, and their\ngovernments undertake actions that they can be said to sanction and\nfrom which they benefit, so it is coherent to hold citizens\nresponsible for their governments\u2019 actions. On this argument,\ncitizens can be legitimate targets of violence. In addition, there is\nrelevant precedent from governments targeting civilians when they\nperceive the situation to be one of a \u201csupreme emergency\u201d,\nas happened in the case of Britain targeting German civilians in the\nSecond World War. So when governments judge that some moral disaster\nis sufficiently likely, it can be repelled using unorthodox and\notherwise repugnant means.\n4. Global Economic Injustice\n\nDo global economic arrangements \u2013 especially economic\nglobalization \u2013 give rise to important responsibilities?\nGlobalization is a complex phenomenon, characterized by the faster\nmovement of people, goods, and ideas across borders but with many\nfacets. For our purposes we need to note only some of its\ncharacteristic central features. These include (i) an increasingly\nglobally integrated economy, (ii) dominated by transnational\ncorporations engaged in activities (such as production and\ndistribution) that span multiple countries, (iii) increasing\nregulation of economic matters by supranational institutions (such as\nthe World Trade Organization), (iv) general commitment to removal of\nbarriers to \u201cfree trade,\u201d and (v) higher levels of\neconomic interdependence. While there is much debate about the\nlong-term effects of globalization and whether they are on balance\ngood or bad, at this stage, the effects of globalization have been\nmixed. For some, globalization has brought improvements, while it has\nworsened the position of others (Singer 2002; Hassoun 2008; Risse\n2012a; Risse and Wollner 2019).\n\nPhilosophers have been concerned with answers to a range of questions\nsuch as: What kinds of economic arrangements are just? Should our\ninternational institutions be reformed to better reflect fair terms of\nco-operation in our globalized world? Can globalization be better\nmanaged so that it works to assist the global poor more effectively?\nAre protectionist policies in trade justified or, rather, is free\ntrade required by considerations of justice? Should poor working\nconditions in developing countries be a matter of concern for citizens\nand consumers in affluent, developed countries? If so, how might\nharmful employment conditions be effectively improved?\n\nWhile Thomas Pogge argues that globalization has harmed the poor on a\nmassive scale, Mathias Risse argues that this is not at all clear\n(Pogge 2010; Risse 2005). Risse argues that in many ways the global\norder must be credited with benefiting the global poor as well. He\nchallenges Pogge\u2019s claim that there are feasible alternatives to\nour global order that could be easily implemented and would avert the\nharm to which Pogge draws attention.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) has been an important focal point\nfor discussion about global economic justice. In particular, critics\nargue that some of its policies, such as those that generally advocate\nfree trade but allow protectionism in affluent developed countries,\ninvolve grave hypocrisy and unfairness to some of the world\u2019s\nmost vulnerable people, while others defend some key WTO provisions\n(Risse and Wollner 2019; Pogge 2001; Moellendorf 2002; Hassoun 2009a,\n2011; James 2012). For further reading see: de Bres 2016. There are\nalso large disparities in the resources at the disposal of various\nparties such that weaker parties often suffer huge disadvantages in\nbeing able to negotiate agreements that work well for them. In these\nsorts of ways agents in developed countries (such as governments,\ncitizens or firms) can take unfair advantage of those in developing\ncountries (R. Miller 2010; Barry and Reddy 2008).\n\nMore generally, there are concerns related to the extraordinary power\nof multinationals and the undue influence they are able to exercise in\nnegotiating deals favorable to them at the expense of the interests of\nthe most vulnerable. So-called sweatshops (in which workers typically\nlabor under harsh and hazardous conditions) are also a frequently\nraised example of how western consumers are implicated in far away\nsuffering, given the high level of dependence in high-income countries\non labor from low-income ones. When we purchase products manufactured\nin sweatshops are we guilty of contributing to exploitation and if so,\nwhat ought we to do to mitigate these unfairnesses? Christian Barry\nand Sanjay Reddy offer an innovative proposal to incentivize\nimprovements in labor standards and wage levels in poor developing\ncountries (Barry and Reddy 2008). This \u201cJust Linkage\u201d\nproposal offers some additional desirable opportunities for enhanced\ninternational trade to those who meet higher standards.\n\nIn this domain, philosophers have also examined a range of other\nissues including obligations to forgive odious debt and whether\nmicro-finance is to be welcomed as a positive force for the global\npoor (Barry, Herman and Tomitova 2007; Khader 2014; Sorell and Cabrera\n2015; Hassoun 2019).\n\nSeveral philosophers have considered individuals\u2019 obligations to\npromote economic justice through ethical consumption. There is an\nimportant debate on whether ethical consumption is helpful and\nrequired (Risse 2005; Walton 2014). Some argue that ethical\nconsumption is only permissible when appropriately democratic (Hussain\n2012; Barry and MacDonald 2018). Others argue that ethical consumption\nis permissible as long as it promotes positive change (Hassoun 2018;\nBerkey 2021; Budolfson 2015).\n\nOther more general concerns about exploitation and economic justice\ncan be found at the entries on\n exploitation\n and\n normative economics and economic justice.\n See also the entry on\n globalization.\n5. Global Gender Justice\n\nThe effects of poverty do not fall equally on men and women, nor on\nboys and girls. In general, poverty makes the lives of women and girls\nharder than their male counterparts, as cultural expectations often\ndictate that women and girls do more care and domestic work or go\nwithout (or much less) when resources are scarce. This can\nsignificantly thwart women and girls\u2019 well-being, as education,\nhealth care, and food are routinely withheld in favor of distribution\nto men and boys.\n\nCultural perceptions of gender roles can often lead to practices\nhighly damaging to the most fundamental interests of women and girls.\nThese include \u201chonor killings\u201d (where it is believed\nculturally permissible to kill a girl or woman who is perceived to\nhave brought shame to the family), genital mutilation, infanticide,\nforced prostitution, arranged marriage, and legal recognition of\nproperty and inheritance rights that significantly disadvantage women\nand girls. Poverty can exacerbate such vulnerabilities so we have\nfurther reasons to address it as a matter of urgency (Jaggar 2009,\n2013, 2014). Martha Nussbaum has argued for a list of ten capabilities\nthat all human persons, no matter what their gender, ought to be\npositioned to exercise. She argues that this approach offers a\npowerful tool for persuasion in cases where girls and women are denied\nthese opportunities by local actors in different cultures.\n\nAlison Jaggar prominently argues that various structures create and\nrecreate transnational gendered vulnerabilities and she illustrates\nwith practices common in domestic work and the sex industry (Jaggar\n2009, 2014). Anca Gheaus has argued that patterns of international\nimmigration \u2013 where women typically provide an international\nmarket for care work \u2013 constitute a kind of care drain. This\nwork is not fully voluntary occurring against a background of unjust\noptions, and amounts to a major issue for women and their families as\nwell as countries and global justice more broadly (Gheaus 2013;\nEckenwiler 2009). Others focus on how universal values can inform\nfeminist approaches and discuss how concrete issues like globalization\naffect women (Khader 2014, 2018; Parekh and Wilcox 2018). (For more\nsee also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization).\n\nSome important policies have influenced international discourse in\ncombating gender injustice. The Millennium Development Goals (MGDs)\nincludes as a third goal the promotion of gender equality and the\nempowerment of women (for discussion of the MGDs, see: Pogge and\nSengupta 2020). The 1995 Beijing Platform for Action set the stage for\nseveral International Covenants and before that the United Nations\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen afforded some important protection for women\u2019s human\nrights. Some theorists are suspicious of human rights language and are\ninclined to reject what they perceive as a masculine or neocolonial\ndiscourse that trumpets individual autonomy in a way that fails to\nacknowledge, adequately, our fundamental human interdependence and\nhistory of oppression (Jaggar 2020). While there certainly is a place\nfor discussion of these important themes, others argue that we should\nnot lose sight of the important victories human rights have also been\nable to secure, despite still having a long way to go (United Nations\nn.d.). The rhetoric of human rights has enabled substantial gains for\npromoting gender equality and protection of women\u2019s fundamental\ninterests, so it has at least strategic value.\n\nFor a good survey of recent work on global gender justice, see Jaggar\n2020. For more on solutions to often discussed problems, such as\nadaptive preferences, see Khader 2011, 2018. For more see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on globalization\n and\n feminist perspectives on power.\n6. Race and Global Justice\n\nDiscussion of how histories of imperialism and racial discrimination\nhave shaped current patterns of global injustice have become more\nprominent in Anglo-American discussions of global justice. In\nparticular, concerns arise about how colonial histories affect\ncontinued oppression and exploitation of racial minority groups on a\nglobal scale (Mills 1997; Bell 2019; Boxill 2009; Okeja 2019; Buckinx,\nTrejo-Mathys, and Waligore 2015a; Lu 2017). Shining a light on how\ncolonialists often embraced beliefs about racial inferiority and\nsuperiority, theorists argue that white supremacy has played an\nimportant role in structuring ways of thinking about global justice.\nKey questions that emerge from such analysis include: Have debates\nabout global justice been inclined to ignore imperial histories\n(especially of racial domination) and if so, how should that be taken\ninto account now? Are egalitarian cosmopolitan accounts effectively\ntrying to promote liberal imperialism or can such discourse\neffectively combat it? What alternative resources can we find in other\ntraditions of political thought and practice for theorizing global\njustice in insightful ways? While some argue that liberalism and\nimperialism are inextricable (Mehta 1999), others are more optimistic\nabout liberalism\u2019s prospects. Yet others believe that sometimes\nimperial-like solutions are necessary to solve especially challenging\nproblems (Ignatieff 2003). (For a good range of views see Bell\n2019).\n\nReflecting on the philosophical field of global justice, it is notable\nthat until more recently, race is often absent from some of the most\nprominent discussions of global justice. Charles Mills was an\nespecially important figure in drawing attention to these omissions.\nIn his view, this means that theoretical debates have largely ignored\nor misunderstood \u201csome of the principal sources and sites of\ninjustice\u201d (2019). These omissions can often be traced to\ndominant methods in Anglo-American philosophy in which ideal\ntheorizing (in a Rawlsian fashion in particular) brackets out certain\nissues in a conscious way. But putting to the side issues of (say)\nracial domination means we will be blind to core histories and\npractices, such as slavery, imperialism, and racism that structure our\ncontemporary world.\n\nDiscussion of race and empire have not been completely ignored by\nglobal justice theorists. For instance, there is an important\nliterature on historical injustice and reparations (Butt 2008; Tan\n2007; Lu 2016; Barry and Goodin 2009), and another on trying to\nidentify how to describe the wrongs of colonialism (Ypi 2013b; Stilz\n2015; Valentini 2015). Margaret Moore draws attention to the ways in\nwhich the dispossession of land and racial domination are particularly\nimportant features in identifying the wrongs of settler colonialism\n(2016). And yet, the concerns Mills raises still resonate. What would\nglobal justice theorizing look like if it placed histories and\ncontemporary practices of racial domination at its core? How can we\nbetter integrate histories of colonialism and racial domination into\nour thinking about current problems of global justice?\n\nFor some, this means we must reject theoretical frameworks and\nvocabularies currently on offer by most political philosophers; others\ndo not believe wholesale rejection is needed. (For a good review of\npositions see Bell 2019). Charles Mills exemplifies the first\napproach. For Mills, global justice theorists have failed to take\nseriously global white supremacy and its legacy and this is especially\nnoteworthy given its role in understanding current patterns of global\ninequality, poverty and violence (1997, 2019). We need to consider\nthis history and make race a central site of investigation for global\njustice theorizing, which requires rejecting Rawlsian-style ideal\ntheorizing. It would also involve giving a more prominent role to\nissues of corrective justice and seeking compensation for the\nwide-scale massive injustices perpetrated through structures of global\nwhite supremacy. Similar views can be found in the work of\nOl\u00faf\u00e9\u0323mi T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 who writes:\n\u201cInjustice and oppression are global in scale\u2026 [b]ecause\nTrans-Atlantic slavery and colonialism built the world we live in, and\nslavery and colonialism were unjust and oppressive\u201d, reparations\nrequire remaking the \u201cworld system\u201d\n(T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 2022, 1). On his account, reparations\nrequire, among other things, reconciliation and eliminating\ninstitutional racism (T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 2022, 4).\n\nAnother very important literature has emerged concerning the many\nalternative understandings of justice that can be found in places\nformerly dominated by colonial occupation. Indigenous philosophies\nhave many important insights to offer (Lauer 2017; Metz 2017; Watene\n2022). In particular, scholars often consider the prospects for\nindigenous perspectives to promote global environmental justice (Whyte\n2014; Watene 2022). Locally embedded frameworks often support, but\nalso provide new alternatives to, traditional approaches to human\nneeds, rights, international development and justice issues more\ngenerally (Lauer 2017; Menkiti 2017; Metz 2017).\n\nInes Valdez (2019) argues we should substitute discourse centered on\nobligations and duties with one centered on power, coalition-building\nand contestation. Kimberley Hutchings (2019) emphasizes that in\ndecolonizing our theorizing about global justice, we have to change\nthe way we see the practice of global justice theorizing. We need to\nthink of the latter less as a way to arrive at answers to global\njustice questions and more as a way to live with others without\nsubsuming them into a particular world. Rather, opening up the\nconversation to sharing different perspectives we embark on a\ncollaborative approach to experiments in living and being with others.\nIt is not about finding new answers to what we mean by justice but\nrather \u201cabout finding new ways of relating to ourselves and to\neach other in our pursuit of whatever we may think of as\njustice\u201d (2019, 121). Adopting such perspectives may reduce some\nnoted tensions in being part of a world community and others that are\nsmaller, drawn along racial, ethnic or other identity lines (Appiah\n2007).\n\nFor more on these topics see the entries on\n colonialism,\n race,\n black reparations,\n reconciliation,\n transitional justice,\n and\n critical philosophy of race.\n7. Immigration\n\nThere are many issues debated in the global justice literature\nconcerning migration, whether temporary, permanent, legally sanctioned\nor undocumented. These include: Should states have the right to\ncontrol their borders? Even if they have such a right, should states\nbe more generous in admitting would-be migrants, especially\nconsidering the facts about global disparities in life prospects? When\naffluent developed states refuse to open their borders to the\neconomically disadvantaged, is this equivalent to members of the\naristocracy unjustly protecting their privilege, as was the case in\nfeudal times? What responsibilities are there to refugees? Can\nundocumented immigration be justified under certain contemporary\ncircumstances? What sorts of criteria may affluent developed countries\nuse when selecting migrants from the pool of applicants for\ncitizenship? May they legitimately consider how prospective migrants\nwould fit in with current citizens, favoring certain religious,\nlinguistic, or ethnic affiliations to manage compatibility? When\nmaking migrant selection decisions, should they consider the effects\non those who remain in countries of origin and if so, is this fair to\nthe would-be migrants who would be excluded on grounds of alleged\nnegative impacts for home country citizens? If states admit migrant\nworkers, are there moral constraints on how they should be treated?\nWould admitting temporary workers without simultaneously allowing them\na pathway to citizenship be unjust? What responsibilities do we have\nin relation to human trafficking?\n\nThere are several now classic defenses of state\u2019s rights to\ncontrol borders. David Miller (Miller 2005, 2007), Michael Walzer\n(Walzer 1981) and Christopher Wellman (Wellman and Cole 2011) have\nbeen particularly important. Prominent proponents of the alternative\n\u201cOpen Borders\u201d position include Joseph Carens (Carens\n1987, 2013), Philip Cole (Cole 2000; Wellman and Cole 2011), Chandran\nKukathas (2021) and Alex Sager (2018). While many theorists discuss\nthe responsibilities to refugees and guest workers, Walzer\u2019s\ntreatment is particularly influential, especially in arguing for his\nview that guest worker programs are only justified when they offer\nsuch \u201cguests\u201d a proper pathway to full and equal\ncitizenship (Walzer 1981). See also: Owen 2020 and Miller 2020. Within\nthe global justice literature, there is considerable discussion of the\nethics of recruiting migrants away from poor countries. Whether brain\ndrain issues should be salient for migration decisions has been a\nfocal point for some discussion (Carens 2013; Oberman 2013; Brock and\nBlake 2015; Bertram 2018). More generally, much recent discussion\nconcerns justice in state admission policies and the kinds of factors\nthat may or should be included in deciding who to admit and exclude\n(Wellman and Cole 2011; Lister 2010; Oberman, Fine and Ypi 2016; Blake\n2019; Sager 2018; Song 2018; Brock 2020; Morgan 2020; Wilcox 2021;\nHidalgo 2021; Buckinx 2019; Jaggar 2020; Vasanthakumar 2022). There\nhas been considerable discussion of appropriate treatment for refugees\n(see especially Serena Parekh 2017, 2020 and Brock 2020). And\ndiscussion has also focused on duties for those who leave their\ncountries of origin (Vasanthakumar 2022; Brock and Blake 2015). For\nmore detailed coverage of issues concerning migration matters, see the\nentry on\n immigration.\n8. Global Environmental Issues\n\nPatterns of human behavior that destroy habitats, accelerate species\nextinction, exacerbate toxic levels of pollution, degrade the oceans,\ncontribute to ozone layer destruction, or increase population levels\nare all issues of global environmental concern (Armstrong 2022;\nGardiner 2011; Gardiner, Caney, Jamieson, Shue, and Pachauri 2010).\nHowever, although there are many global environmental topics that are\nrightly concerns of global justice, there is one that dominates\ndiscussion and that concerns our responsibilities with respect to\nclimate change. Here we focus exclusively on this issue.\n\nAmong the scientific community it is no longer controversial that\nanthropogenic climate change is real and a significant threat to the\nwell-being of both current and future generations. But it is also\nwidely acknowledged that human development is an important way to\naddress high levels of global poverty, that such development is energy\nintensive, and the cheapest sources of energy available are not likely\nto be clean energy types. These considerations significantly affect\nefforts to deal with problems presented by climate change. There is\nmuch discussion about the principles that should inform a fair treaty\naimed at dealing with addressing climate change that also gives\nappropriate weight to concerns for human development (Shue 2014;\nAthanasiou et al. 2022). Some of the main contenders include\nprinciples that recognize causal responsibility for high emission\nlevels, principles that are sensitive to ability to pay, and ones\naccording to which those who have benefited from emissions should now\nbe expected to absorb more costs.\n\nWe have not all contributed equally to the problems created by\nemissions; industrialized nations have contributed historically at\nmuch higher levels than those that are still developing. And so we\nshould endorse the guidelines that those who have polluted more should\npay more to help redress current problems (The Polluter Pays\nPrinciple). However critics argue that this principle unfairly holds\nsome responsible when they did not know they were causing harm, since\nit was not widely known that greenhouse gases could result in climate\nchange prior to 1990. So on this view, responsibility for emissions\nprior to 1990 should not conform with the Polluter Pays Principle,\neven if it is used to allocate costs after 1990. Others reply that\ncountries can still be liable for causing harm even if they lack moral\nresponsibility for doing so (Shue 2014). A second principle that is\noften discussed is The Beneficiary Pays Principle. Those who live in\nindustrialized countries have typically benefited greatly from high\nlevels of emissions so it is not unfair if they are expected to pay a\nhigher proportion of costs. Critics object that a history of\nbenefiting is an insufficiently strong consideration for assigning\nresponsibilities now: in many cases whether or not people benefit is\nlargely outside of their control. According to a third popular\nprinciple, The Ability to Pay Principle, the capacity of agents to pay\nfor costs associated with mitigating climate change should be\nrelevant. Again, some object that the ability to pay is a poor\nprinciple for assigning responsibility.\n\nMore recently, philosophers have evaluated different proposals for not\nonly mitigating and distributing the costs of climate change but also\nadaptation to its diverse effects (Gosseries 2004; Vanderheiden 2008;\nGardiner, Caney, Jamieson, Shue, and Pachauri 2010; Blomfield 2019;\nShue 2014, 2021; Brooks 2020). Moreover, they have considered how we\ncan mobilize hope in the face of the seemingly tragic consequences of\nour failures to both address the challenges of climate change and\nhuman development in a timely manner (Moellendorf 2022; Cripps 2022;\nMalm 2021; Mckinnon 2022). Some of this work connects to important\ndebates about feasibility and institutional mechanisms for addressing\nclimate change fairly (Caney 2020; Gheaus 2013; Gilabert and\nLawford-Smith 2012). For more on climate justice see the entries on\n climate justice\n and\n climate science\n (Parker 2018; Caney 2022). Comprehensive treatment of climate justice\nrequires addressing the issue of responsibilities to future\ngenerations (Meyer and Gossieries 2009). For important treatment of\nour responsibilities to other generations see the entry on\n intergenerational justice.\n9. Global Health Issues\n\nOne striking feature of the state of global health is that there are\nlarge inequalities in health outcomes and opportunities for health.\nConsider that life expectancy can vary a great deal. A person born in\nSierra Leone can expect to live about 40 years whereas one born in\nJapan can expect to live for 80 years. Malaria has been almost\nentirely eradicated in high-income countries, but it still kills about\na million people in developing countries per year (United Nations\n2009). A woman in Niger has a 1 in 7 chance of dying in childbirth,\nwhereas this is 1 in 11 000 for women in Canada (Benatar and Brock\n2011, 2021). The global burden of disease is by no means evenly spread\nnor does workforce capability correspond with areas of highest need.\nIn fact many of the countries that suffer from the greatest burdens of\ndisease have the fewest skilled healthcare workers. In addition,\npharmaceutical companies do not spend their research and development\nbudgets in ways that match where the needs are greatest. Rather,\nseeking the most profitable ventures, they are much more likely to\nspend resources developing drugs for lucrative markets where the\npayoffs are greatest, even when the marginal benefits to consumers are\nsmall. One example is the research and development resources\npharmaceutical companies frequently spend on developing drugs that are\nsimilar to others already available, rather than developing treatments\nfor diseases for which there are no cures. Historically, it is\nestimated that drug companies spent approximately 90% of their\nresearch and development resources in seeking treatment for about 10%\nof diseases and some argue that justice requires reorienting\nincentives for new research and development to better align with the\nglobal disease burden (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Working Group\n2001; Flory and Kitcher 2004).\n\nThe poor in developing countries are also often more vulnerable to\ndisease and less able to resist disease because of poor living\nconditions related to poverty. Lack of clean water, clean energy\nsources, inadequate nutrition, and other social determinants of health\nplay a key role in explaining this increased vulnerability. Living in\novercrowded houses can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases,\nsuch as tuberculosis. So, a number of issues that sustain poverty or\nexacerbate people\u2019s vulnerability to disease as a result of\npoverty should be of concern (Benatar and Brock 2021). As Norman\nDaniels argues, health inequalities among different social groups can\nbe considered unjust when they result from unjust distribution in\nfactors that are socially controllable that affect population health\n(Daniels 2011, 101). On this view many health inequalities that exist\nare ones that ought to be of concern as they meet this criterion. How\nshould responsibilities for improving this situation be allocated? In\nmany ways, but here we pick out just a few that have received\nconsiderable attention in the philosophical literature.\n\nThe current system of intellectual property rights is one troubling\narea. The World Trade Organization grants product patents for a twenty\nyear period which effectively renders many new medicines unaffordable\nfor the vast majority of the world\u2019s population and those in\ngreatest need. There are a number of innovative proposals aimed at\naddressing these issues. One prominent example is the Health Impact\nFund proposal developed by Thomas Pogge, which offers alternative ways\nto reward pharmaceutical companies, notably by how much impact they\nhave on actually curing diseases (Pogge 2008). The greater their\nimpact, the larger the share of the rewards they would receive from\nthe Health Impact Fund. Nicole Hassoun proposes a \u201cGlobal Health\nImpact\u201d certification program for rating pharmaceutical\ncompanies\u2019 contributions to the global poor (Hassoun 2020).\nCompanies would compete for the gold star rankings which could\nsignificantly affect consumption choices and thereby expected profits.\nIn both cases the aim is to create important incentives for key agents\nto care about how their products affect the global poor.\n\nThere are many other issues that concern philosophers in the domain of\nglobal health. There are worrying practices of experimentation on\ndisadvantaged subjects in developing countries (Emanuel et al. 2004).\nIncreasingly, clinical research has been outsourced to poor,\ndeveloping countries with populations that are often highly\nvulnerable. We might wonder about whether these populations are being\nexploited and whether the participants have compromised abilities to\nconsent to drug trials. In many cases the trials bring considerable\nhealth benefits that would not come their way were it not in the\ninterests of pharmaceutical companies to do clinical research in those\nlocations. If sufficient benefits accrue for local populations, some\nargue that these cases need not be of concern, while others disagree\n(Emanuel et al. 2004; London 2011).\n\nNew infectious diseases and the threat of pandemics are creating\nfurther questions about our responsibilities. Often the case is made\nthat national interests in public health in developed countries\nmandate concern for infectious diseases that originate in developing\ncountries. When resources for addressing these threats are limited,\nsome argue it is acceptable for states to prioritize their\npopulations, while others disagree (Hassoun 2021; Ferguson and Caplan\n2021; Savulescu 2020). There are also important debates about how to\ndistribute vaccines across borders and about whether other public\nhealth policies \u2013 e.g. immunity passports \u2013 violate\nindividual rights or are justified for protecting public health\n(Emanuel et al. 2020; Emanuel et al. 2021; Herlitz et al. 2021; Liu,\nSalwi, and Drolet 2020; Persad and Emanuel 2020; Voigt 2022; Jecker\n2022; Bramble 2020; Baylis and Kofler 2020a, 2020b; Jecker, Wightman,\nand Diekema, forthcoming). Some argue that global justice \u2013\nsolidarity and respect for human rights \u2013 demands addressing\ndiseases that are not as transmissible as COVID-19 and may not pose as\nsignificant threats to many people in developed countries (Daniels\n2007; Atuire and Hassoun 2023; Gould 2018; Lenard and Straehle 2012;\nBenatar and Brock 2021; Herlitz et al. 2021). There is also\nsignificant concern for fair procedures in addressing health crises\nglobally.\n\nFor more see also\n public health ethics,\n and\n justice, inequality, and health.\n10. Some Issues that Cut Across Several Themes\n10.1 Natural Resources and Global Justice\n\nDiscussion of natural resources often figures prominently in several\ntopics of global justice. Some relevant questions include: Are\nnational communities entitled to the resources they find on their\nterritories? Should principles of global justice apply to our\narrangements for justly distributing natural resources? Charles Beitz\nwas an early proponent of a resource distribution principle, according\nto which natural resources should be allocated such that each society\nis able to provide adequately for its population (Beitz 1975). We saw\nin\n Section 2\n that Rawls believes that resources are not important to prosperity in\nthe ways many imagine. Rather, institutional resilience matters more.\nBy contrast, Thomas Pogge highlights the ways in which international\npractices concerning the distribution of resources create considerable\nobstacles for prosperity in developing countries. In short, these\npractices create incentives for the wrong kinds of people to take\npower through illegitimate means and to focus on retaining power at\nthe expense of other goals governments should have, such as trying to\nimprove the well-being of their citizens. We need to modify these\ninternational practices so they do not create such an unfavorable\nenvironment. In addition, Pogge proposes a Global Resources Dividend\nas one measure by which practices concerning natural resource\ndistribution would work in some small way to the benefit of the global\npoor. On this Global Resources Dividend proposal there would be a\nsmall tax on resource extraction, payable by the consumers of\nresources, and available for projects that would assist in helping\neveryone to be able to meet their basic needs with dignity (Pogge\n2008).\n\nLeif Wenar is also concerned with prevailing practices governing the\nsale of natural resources and their products (Wenar 2010, 2016). When\nconsumers in wealthy states buy goods from developing countries, this\nis often similar to consciously receiving stolen goods. Legitimate\nresource sales require general agreement from citizens. Evidence of\nagreement requires that: (i) owners must be informed about sales, (ii)\nowners must be able to express dissent freely should they have doubts\nabout sales, and (iii) owners should be able to stop resource sales\nwithout fearing grave consequences such as violence and intimidation.\nWenar aims to outlaw dispossession of citizens\u2019 resources by\npromoting various practices that would satisfy these conditions and\npromote clean trade (Wenar 2016).\n\nFor various reasons (including strategic ones) Thomas Pogge and Leif\nWenar do not directly challenge the right of nations to own resources\non their territories. Policy recommendations, are much more likely to\nbe effective if they can fit within the main structures of\ninternational conventions. However, other theorists do take up this\nissue including Hillel Steiner (2005), Tim Hayward (2005) and Mathias\nRisse (2005, 2012b). Steiner argues that all inhabitants of the world\nare entitled to an equal share in the value of all land and he\nadvocates for the \u201cGlobal Fund\u201d which aims to ensure that\nequal share entitlements can be secured. The Global Fund would\nconstitute a clearing house for payments and disbursements (Steiner\n2005).\n\nAppealing to accounts of ownership of resources, some philosophers\ndraw out important implications for diverse global justice debates.\nMathias Risse argues that we all, collectively, own the resources of\nthe earth and this has profound implications for a range of global\njustice issues, including immigration. When people are under-utilizing\ntheir \u201crightful shares\u201d of territory, they cannot complain\nwhen co-owners would like to occupy some of it. Some theorists\nconcerned with environmental issues also discuss our rights with\nrespect to natural resources. Some argue that we have equal rights to\naccess the earth\u2019s resources. Tim Hayward, for instance, argues\nthat we have equal rights to ecological space (Hayward 2005). This is\noften appealed to when there is a perception that we have exceeded our\nshare, such as in levels of carbon emissions and consumption more\ngenerally.\n\nAccounts according to which we have equal rights to resources, land,\necological space and so on, are often accused of suffering from an\nimportant common problem. It is difficult to defend a clear and\ncompelling account of the value of resources as these can vary\nconsiderably in different social, cultural and technological contexts.\nBut we need to be able to quantify resource values to some plausible\nextent, if we are to determine whether people are enjoying or\nexceeding their equal shares (Armstrong 2017).\n\nOthers defend territorial sovereignty for other reasons. Some, like\nCara Nine argue that collectives have a right to territory when they\n\u201cestablish legitimate, minimal conditions for justice within a\ngeographical region\u201d (Nine 2012, 2022). While Anna Stilz argues\nthat states allow people to associate in specific geographical\nlocations and realize economic, social, and cultural values free from\ninterference as long as they respect others\u2019 rights to associate\nas well (Stilz 2019). She defends collective self-determination that\nrepresents subjects\u2019 political will and ensures self-directed\nagency and non-alienation where this is compatible with global\njustice. Stilz maintains that actual states only have a legitimate\nright to territory if they have rightful occupancy, implement a system\nof basic justice, and represent the shared will of most inhabitants.\nBut, even when they do not, she thinks states can be justified in\nruling a territory if they are the only available way of providing\ndecent rule or changing their boundaries will jeopardize urgent\ninterests or come with high costs (Stilz 2019).\n\nOthers argue against territorial sovereignty or for reconceiving\nsovereignty in a way that encourages respect for human rights and can\nlimit our tendency towards war, coercion, inequality and collective\naction problems (Chatterjee 2011; Held 1995). Some maintain that all\nwho are affected by states\u2019 actions should have a say in their\nrules while others reject this conclusion. For discussion, see\nBuchanan and Keohane 2011. For other important work on territory, see\nthe entry on\n territorial rights and territorial justice.\n10.2 Allocating Responsibilities for Global Problems\n\nThere are a number of global justice problems that need to be\naddressed, and this raises the issue of how to allocate\nresponsibilities fairly. Who should do what to reduce global\ninjustices? Several different agents, groups, organizations and\ninstitutions could play a role. Which responsibilities should devolve\nto corporations, governments, consumers, citizens, international\norganizations or social movements? Some frequently discussed proposals\nfocus on agents\u2019 contributions to a problem, their patterns of\nbenefit from the problem, and their capacity to take constructive\naction now. Two influential frameworks deserve more extended\ntreatment, notably that of Iris Marion Young concerning a social\nconnection model for allocating responsibilities for structural\ninjustice and that of David Miller concerning remedial responsibility\n(Young 2011; Miller 2007).\n\nIn contrast to the idea of responsibility as involving finding fault\nand individual liability, Iris Marion Young develops a forward-looking\nmodel which she argues is more appropriate. She draws on the idea that\nparticipation via institutions sometimes produces injustice, so we\nhave particular responsibilities to address injustice. We share\nresponsibility for addressing injustice but we may have different\ndegrees and kinds of responsibility. She offers different parameters\nof reasoning that can help individuals and organizations decide what\nmight make the most sense for them to do in efforts to remedy\ninjustice, given that there are so many injustices, whereas time and\nresources are limited. Using the case study of the global apparel\nindustry she illustrates how the fact that we are positioned\ndifferently can entail varying but important responsibilities for all\nwho participate in activities that sustain sweatshops. There are at\nleast four parameters that agents can use in their reasoning:\n\nPower: we have different levels of influence and capacities to\nchange processes. We should focus on those areas where we have greater\ncapacities to change worrisome structural processes. This might mean\nfocusing on a few key players who have both greater capacity to make\nchanges themselves and to influence others.\nPrivilege: some people have more privilege than others in relation\nto structures. So middle-class clothing consumers have more\ndiscretionary income, choice and ability to absorb costs \u2013 they\ncan change their clothing purchasing practices more easily than those\nwho earn minimum wage, have little discretionary income, and little\nability to absorb further costs.\nInterest: All who have an interest in changing oppressive\nstructures have responsibilities in connection with remedying these.\nThis entails that \u201cvictims\u201d too have important\nresponsibilities since they have a great interest in eliminating\noppression. In a nuanced analysis she argues that they might have\nresponsibilities in certain contexts, such as to speak out about the\nharsh conditions in which they work. They must take some\nresponsibility for resisting and challenging the structures. Without\ntheir participation the need for reforms may be rationalized away or\nreforms may not take the required form. These obligations may not\nalways exist, especially when the costs of resistance would require\nextraordinary sacrifices.\nCollective ability: In some cases we already have collective\norganization capacities and resources that are well established.\nSometimes it just makes good practical sense to draw on these. So, for\ninstance, sometimes student associations, faith-based organizations,\nunions, or stockholder groups already exercise significant power in\nbeing able to coordinate like-minded members who are willing to take\ncertain actions. She encourages us to harness organizational resources\nwhere doing so would prove effective.\n\n\nIn summary, Young encourages us to think about how we can best take\nresponsibility for reducing structural injustice by reflecting on\nthese four parameters \u2013 different positions of power, privilege,\ninterest and collective ability. (For comprehensive review of the\nmerits of Young\u2019s approach see McKeown 2018, 2021.)\n\nDavid Miller offers a tremendously influential connection theory of\nresponsibility that also discusses our remedial responsibilities.\nThere are six ways in which we can be connected to someone, P, who\nneeds help and so be held remedially responsible for assisting. These\nconnections give rise to six ways in which remedial responsibility can\nbe identified. We might be morally responsible for P\u2019s\ncondition; we might be outcome or causally responsible for P\u2019s\ncondition; we might have had no causal role in their condition but\nhave benefited from it; we might have capacity to assist P; or we\nmight be connected to P through ties of\n community.[4]\n\nThere is a huge literature on taking responsibility for remedying or\npreventing future global injustice, including discussing the merits of\nthese two dominant approaches. For some other innovative contributions\nsee, for instance, Barry and Overland 2016, Dahan, Lerner and\nMilman-Sivan 2023, 2016, McKeown 2018, 2021, Brock 2023.\n\nMore recently attention has focused on what those on the receiving end\nof injustice may permissibly do. Alejandra Mancilla (2016) argues that\nthe needy can take what they need and use material resources for self\npreservation even if that requires taking from others. In doing so she\nexpands on James Sterba\u2019s earlier arguments against libertarians\nfor similar conclusions (Sterba 2008, 1996). Also see (Cabrera 2004).\nOthers like Cecil Fabre, Johan Olsthoorn, and Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen\nargue that sometimes poor states may wage war on the affluent for\nsubsistence (Lipper-Rasmussen 2013; Fabre 2016; Olsthoorn 2021).\n[Some, like Peter Unger and Gerhart \u00d8verland argue that it is\nacceptable to force others to assist in poverty-alleviation under at\nleast some circumstances (Unger 1996; \u00d8verland 2009)].\n\nIn the global justice literature, there are also important concerns\nabout the distribution of responsibilities among collective and\nindividual agents. Prominently, can we hold nations responsible for\nglobal injustices or remedying such injustices? This raises important\nquestions about collective responsibility that are well treated\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the entry on\n collective responsibility).\n10.3 Authority in the Global Domain: Do We Need a World State to Secure Global Justice?\n\nIs it possible to have global justice in the absence of a world state?\nHobbes argues that this is not possible since there is no global\nauthority that can secure and enforce the requirements of justice. He\npresents the classic so-called realist case, which is highly\ninfluential in international politics, such that there is a state of\nnature in the international realm. All states compete in pursuing\ntheir own advantage and since there is no global authority there can\nbe no justice in international affairs. Also for an overview of some\nkey work on realism in political philosophy, see the entry on\n political realism in international relations\n and Rossi and Sleat 2014.\n\nOthers are more optimistic. Since we already have a high level of\ninteraction among states, organizations and other agents, this has\ngenerated various norms and expectations about appropriate conduct\nthat guides behavior in the international sphere (Beitz 1999).\nMoreover, we have a strong interest in co-operation when this is\nnecessary to deal practically with a range of problems that have\nglobal reach. Global governance is concerned with how we manage\ninterests affecting the residents of more than one state in the\nabsence of a world state. There is already a high level of\nco-operation among a variety of networks, organizations and other\ngroups of interested parties at the sub-state level, and this is\npowerfully influencing the redesign of best practice norms in\nparticular domains (Slaughter 2004). Some argue for a global state or\ndemocratic system \u2013 often with subsidiarity or some kind of\npoly-centric political order, and others argue for more limited forms\nof legitimate global governance (Cabrera 2018; Gould 2004, 2014; Held\n2004; Kuper 2004; Buchanan and Keohane 2006).\n\nOther change agents that can and have exercised considerable reform\npressures include global social movements, such as the anti-sweatshop\nmovement, the fair trade movement, and other ethical consumption\nmovements. Global activism has been an important source of incremental\nchange. These simple examples show that much more is possible in the\nabsence of a world state than realists acknowledge.\n\nFor more on issues of world government, see the entry on\n world government,\n which provides extended treatment of this issue.\n11. The Contribution to Public Policy, Interdisciplinary Engagement, and New Methods\n\nPhilosophers are contributing in important ways to discussions of\nglobal justice policy issues. As illustrations, in this entry we have\ncanvassed several institutional reform proposals for addressing global\ninjustices which have enjoyed widespread attention, both within the\nacademy and beyond. These include Thomas Pogge\u2019s Health Impact\nFund and Nicole Hassoun\u2019s Global Health Impact proposals\n (Section 9)\n along with Pogge\u2019s proposal for a Global Resources Dividend\n (Section 10.1),\n Christian Barry and Sanjay Reddy\u2019s Just Linkage Proposal to\nhelp improve working conditions\n (Section 4),\n Allan Buchanan and Robert Keohane\u2019s institutional innovations\nto secure accountability in the use of military force\n (Section 3.2),\n and the innovative work of Leif Wenar concerning proposals for clean\ntrade\n (Section 10.1).\n\nIn addition to those illustrations already highlighted in this\narticle, philosophers are having an impact on policy discussions in a\nwide range of areas including climate change and contributing ideas to\nthe Human Development Reports (United Nations Development Programme\n2020, United Nations Development Programme 2022). They have\ncontributed to influential international multi-disciplinary projects\nthat seek alternative ways to measure quality of health, life or\npoverty (Nussbaum and Sen 1993, Esposito and Hassoun 2017, Wisor et\nal. 2014). Philosophers have also discussed rampant abusive tax\npractices by corporations and wealthy individuals and how this\ndeprives developing countries of much-needed income for human\ndevelopment in developing countries (Brock 2009). There are also\nimportant discussions of global income taxes, carbon taxes, financial\ntransaction taxes and Tobin Taxes (Moellendorf 2009; Caney 2005b;\nBrock 2009). The pervasive problems associated with corruption have\nbeen attracting increased attention (Wenar 2016; Brock 2023). So,\nphilosophers continue to make an important contribution to policy\ndebates and this is also likely to be an area in which important\nfuture work on global justice will concentrate.\n\nPhilosophers are also engaging in more interdisciplinary research and\nglobal justice theorists sometimes do experimental or more broadly\nempirical philosophy (Miller 2001; Appiah 2007; Hassoun 2009b, 2014;\nLindauer 2020; Lindauer et al. 2023; Buckland et al. 2022;\nP\u00f6lzler and Hannikainen 2022). Furthermore, there is some\nsophisticated work in related disciplines and there is significant\nroom for fruitful interdisciplinary future research (Cappelen, Fest,\nS\u00f8rensen and Tungodden 2020).\n\nPhilosophers also play central roles in methodological innovation,\nwhich can in turn play an important role in informing debates about\ntheory and public policy. As one prominent example of the\ncontributions of new global justice methodologies, it is worth noting\nthe emergence of \u201cEngaged Theorizing\u201d (see website listed\nunder internet resources), especially in the global justice context\n(Ackerly 2018; Deveaux 2015, 2021; Cabrera 2010; Lu 2017; Rafanelli\n2021; Reed-Sandoval 2020). Such approaches take lived experience,\nsocial action campaigns, and justice movements as the central\nimportant starting point for normative theorizing. Using interpretive,\nqualitative, and normative analysis, engaged political theorists try\nto align political philosophy with the questions, goals, and needs of\ncommunities seeking social justice. In these ways there have been\nimportant new attempts to bring philosophy to bear on our contemporary\nglobal realities, with significant progress made in bridging the\ndivisions between theory and practice.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, A., 2007, \u201cCooperation, Pervasive Impact, and\nCoercion: On the Scope (not site) of Distributive Justice,\u201d\n<em>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</em>, 35(4): 318\u2013358.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2010, \u201cCitizenship, Immigration and\nBoundaries,\u201d in Ethics and World Politics, Duncan Bell (ed.),\nOxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 358\u2013376.", "Ackerly, B., 2018, <em>Just Responsibility</em>: A Human Rights\nTheory of Global Justice, Oxford University Press.", "Altman, A. and C.H.
