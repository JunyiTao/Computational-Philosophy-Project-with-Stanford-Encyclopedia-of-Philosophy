    "main_text": "Systems of connexive logic || Connexive logic based on subtraction negation\n4.3 Connexive logic based on subtraction negation\n\nAlbeit according to Routley (1978), Routley et al. (1982) and\nRoutley and Routley (1985) there is a close relation between connexive\nlogic and the idea of negation as cancellation, Routley suggested a\nsemantics using a generation relation and the star negation in ternary\nframes for relevance logics, whereas connexive logics based in a\nstraightforward way on the cancellation view of negation have been\nworked out by Priest (1999). Priest (1999) directly translates a\ndefinition of entailment that enforces the null-content account of\ncontradictions into evaluation clauses. A model is a structure M\n= <W, g,\nv>, where W is a non-empty set of possible\nworlds, g is a distinguished element from W, and\nv is a valuation function from the set of propositional\nvariables into the set of classical truth values {1, 0}. Two clauses\nfor evaluating implications at possible worlds are considered\n(notation adjusted):\n\n(a) M, s \u22a8 A\n\u2192 B iff (i) there is a world u with M,\nu \u22a8 A and (ii) for\nevery world u, M, u\n\u22a8 A then M, u\n\u22a8 B;\n\n(b) M, s \u22a8 A\n\u2192 B iff (i) there is a world u with M,\nu \u22a8 A, (ii) there\nis a world u with M, u\n\u22ad B, and (iii) for every world u, M,\nu \u22a8 A then M,\nu \u22a8 B.\n\n\nCondition (i) ensures that nothing is implied by an unsatisfiable\nantecedent. The evaluation clauses for the other connectives are\nclassical. A formula A is true in a model (M\n\u22a8 A) iff M,\ng \u22a8 A; and\nA is valid iff A is true in every model. Condition\n(ii) ensures that the law of contraposition is valid. A set \u0394 of\nformulas is true in a model iff every element of \u0394 is true in\nthe model.\n\nThere are two notions of entailment (\u0394 \u22a8 A), one\ncoming with clause (a) the other with clause (b):\n\n(a) \u0394\u22a8 A iff \u0394 is true in some model, and\nevery model in which \u0394 is true is a model in which A is\ntrue;\n\n(b) \u0394\u22a8 A iff \u0394 is true in some model,\n~A is true in some model, and every model in which \u0394 is\ntrue is a model in which A is true.\n\n\nThese two connexive logics arise from the idea of negation as\ncancellation in a straightforward way. They are neither monotonic nor\nclosed under uniform substitution. Proof systems and decision\nprocedures for them can be obtained from a straightforward faithful\ntranslation \u03c4 into the modal logic S5, cf. the\nentry\n logic: modal.\n For implications A \u2192 B the translation is\ndefined as follows, where \u2283 is material implication and \u00ac is\nclassical negation:\n\n(a) \u25ca\u03c4(A) \u2227 \u25a1(\u03c4(A) \u2283\n\u03c4(B));\n\n(b) \u25ca\u03c4(A) \u2227 \u25ca\u00ac\u03c4(B) \u2227\n\u25a1(\u03c4(A) \u2283 \u03c4(B)).\n\n\nFerguson (2015) observes that the intersection of the semantical\nconsequence relations of variant (a) of Priest\u2019s logic and the\nnegation, conjunction, disjunction fragment of Bochvar\u2019s\n3-valued logic (cf. the entry\n many-valued logic)\n results in a known system of containment logic, namely the system\nRC presented in Johnson 1976.\n\nAlthough the semantics of Priest\u2019s connexive logics is simple\nand transparent, the underlying idea of subtraction negation is not\nunproblematic. Priest (1999, 146) mentions strong fallibilists who\n\u201cendorse each of their views, but also endorse the claim that\nsome of their views are false\u201d. Their contradictory opinions in\nfact hardly are contentless, so that the cancellation account of\nnegation and, as a result, systems of connexive logic based on\nsubtraction negation appear not to be very well-motivated. In Skurt\nand Wansing 2018, it is argued that the metaphoric notion of negation\nas cancellation is conceptually unclear and that Routley\u2019s\n(Routley et al. 1982)) suggestion to replace it by a notion\nof negation as subtraction in generalized arithmetic is unclear at\nleast insofar as it has not been worked out in detail.\n",
