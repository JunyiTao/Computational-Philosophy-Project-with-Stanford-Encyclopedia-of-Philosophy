    "main_text": "Some Fundamental Principles of Leibniz's Philosophy || The Principle of the Best\n3.1 The Principle of the Best\n\n\nLeibniz presented a number of arguments for the existence of God,\nwhich represent great contributions to philosophical theology and\nwhich will be discussed below. But one of the most basic principles of\nhis system is that God always acts for the best. While this is\ngenerally treated as an axiom, the opening of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics does present something of an argument for it:\n\u201cGod is an absolutely perfect being\u201d; \u201cpower and\nknowledge are perfections, and, insofar as they belong to God, they do\nnot have limits\u201d; \u201cWhence it follows that God, possessing\nsupreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only\nmetaphysically, but also morally speaking\u2026\u201d (AG 35) This\nmight not appear a surprising claim from a theist, but it is not\nobvious that God must always act for the best or even create the best\nworld. (See Adams 1972) And Leibniz sometimes implicitly, sometimes\nexplicitly, appeals to this principle in his metaphysics, most notably\nwhen he is also employing the Principle of Sufficient Reason.  Indeed,\nwhen it comes to the creation of the world, the \u201csufficient\nreason\u201d for God's choice of this world is that this world is the\n\u201cbest\u201d of all possible worlds; in other words, in this\ncase the Principle of Sufficient Reason is essentially the Principle\nof the Best. \n",
