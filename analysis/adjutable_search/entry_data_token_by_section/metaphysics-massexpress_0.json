These\nreactions are required by the previous embrace of what we could call\n\u2018Thing Theory.\u2019 Thing Theory, very roughly, is the view\nthat (excluding properties and\n relations)[1],\n all concrete existents are either things fundamentally, or reducible\nto fundamental things.\n\nPeter Strawson, in his influential Individuals claims\n\u201cAnything whatever can be introduced into discussion by means of\na singular, definitely identifying substantival expression \u2026\nanything whatever can be identifyingly referred to \u2026 Anything\nwhatever can appear as a logical subject, an\n \u201cindividual.\u2019\u201d[2]\n\nIn Quine\u2019s influential Word and Object he speaks about\n\u201climning the true and ultimate structure of reality,\u201d\n(1960, 221) and according to him, for an object to exist is for it to\nbe necessarily quantified over in an idealized and regimented logical\nlanguage used to truly and comprehensively describe the world. And he\nclaims that the values of the variables of such a theory will only\nrange over sets and physical objects, so \u201cas far as he is\nconcerned \u2026 only physical objects and sets really exist,\u201d\nand, it must be noted, both objects and sets, even if the latter are\nabstract, are all regarded as \u2018things\u2019 or\n \u2018objects\u2019[3]\n\nAnd, from a recent abstract of a book chapter, we have the terse\n\u201cthe world is a world of objects\u201d (Heil 2003, Ch. 15).\nThis family of views goes back to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\nZeta and the Categories. (See the section on\n substance, matter, and subject in the entry on Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics\n for details.)\n\nBut if the world is a world of things, what are they in general? What\nthings, individuals, or objects are is itself a controversial and\nmurky matter, and goes beyond the purview of this article (for more,\nsee these related entries:\n object,\n ordinary objects,\n sortals,\n substance). Related terms in philosophy for \u2018thing\u2019 are\n substance,[4]\nprimary substance, particular, concrete\nparticular, existent, being, entity,\nsubstratum, term, and so on. For the purposes of\nthis entry, we will take a rather minimalistic view of thinghood. We\nwill regard a thing or object as whatever satisfies this\ndefinition:\n\n(Thinghood) x is a thing or object\nif and only if:\n\n\nx falls under some F, and F is\nsingular. [Furthermore, the plural \u201cthe Fs\u201d is\nwell-formed and does not refer to kinds (e.g., in \u2018the wines of\nFrance\u2019).]\nx can be unqualifiedly counted as one. [i.e.,\nx can take \u2018one\u2019 as an unqualified numerical\ndeterminer, without recourse to measurement, \u2018packaging\u2019,\nor partitive phrases (e.g., \u2018one dog\u2019, versus \u2018one\ngallon of water\u2019 or \u2018one water molecule\u2019).] (See\nLaycock 2006, chapter 2)\nx is concrete (i.e., x is not a universal,\nproperty, relation, or abstract entity).\n\n\n\nAnd now, using the notion of Thinghood, a minimalist Thing Theory can\nbe captured as follows:\n\n(TT)\nWhatever exists is a thing, or is reducible to a thing or\nthings.\n\n\nThing theorists hold that whatever exists is unqualifiedly countable\nas one, or reducible to such things. For the Thing Theorist \u201cto\nbe is to be countable.\u201d Some Stuff Ontologists would\ncounter\u2014\u201cto be is to be either countable or\nmeasurable\u201d (a gloss on Burge 1975, p.\u2009459).\n\nAll three Thing-Theoretic views in section\n 2\n maintain that, fundamentally, it all boils down to things.\n\u2018Matter\u2019 always refers to parcels (or \u2018sums\u2019)\nof matter, and parcels are always particular things, which can even be\ncounted in principle. (If there are n simple and discrete\nfundamental things across all of space-time, then there are at most\n(2n \u2212 1) things total in the cosmos).\nMasses-as-sets can always be held to be sets of things, and plural\nreference can always be held to be reference to a number of\nthings.\n\nWe can view \u2018Stuff Ontologies\u2019 as views which, in some\nsense, depart from this picture and \u2018take stuff\nseriously.\u2019 That is, a Stuff Ontology is any view which departs\nfrom Thing Theory in important respects so as to allow non-thing-like\nstuff to be part of the fundamental furniture of the world, whereas\nThing Theorists believe that stuff-talk modeled on mass term use has\nno proper place in the fundamental correct description of the\nworld.\n\nStuff Ontologists can either (i) eliminate things, (ii) accept that\nthere are things, but hold that they are merely derivative entities\nwhich are parasitic on the fundamental stuff of the world, or (iii)\nhold that both stuff and things are fundamental, and are\n inter-irreducible.[5]\n",
