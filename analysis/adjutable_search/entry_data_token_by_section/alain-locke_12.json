    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Young Negro\n5.2 The Young Negro\n\nLocke explains that the aesthetic renaissance that took place in\nHarlem and elsewhere was primarily a movement of young artists. The\nyouth, Locke claims, speak in distinctive overtones, and \u201cout of\na unique experience and with particular representativeness\u201d (NN\n47). The experiences of young American Negroes is uniquely\nrepresentative because\n\n[a]ll classes of people under social pressure are permeated with a\ncommon experience; they are emotionally welded as others cannot be.\nWith them, even ordinary living has epic depth and lyric intensity,\nand this, their material handicap, is their spiritual advantage. (NN\n47)\n\n\nHere we find an interesting problem in Lockean exegesis: How is it\nthat the aesthetic contribution is at once characterized by a\ndisavowal of representativeness, while at the same time being uniquely\nrepresentative? Locke goes on to note that\n\n[r]acial expression as a conscious motive, it is true, is fading out\nof our latest art, but just as surely the age of truer, finer group\nexpression is coming in\u2014for race expression does not need to be\ndeliberate to be vital. Indeed, at its best it never is. (NN 47)\n\n\nLocke's resolution of the seeming paradox comes by way of recognizing\nthat \u201c[o]ur poets have now stopped speaking for the\nNegro[;]\u201d the sort of representativeness characteristic of past\naesthetic pursuits and instead now \u201cspeak as Negroes\u201d (NN\n48). The main difference being that \u201c[w]here formally they spoke\nto others and tried to interpret,\u201d the experiences of\nAfrican-Americans for white or other nonblack audiences \u201cthey\nnow speak to their own and try to express.\u201d \u201cThey\nhave\u201d he notes \u201cstopped posing, being nearer the\nattainment of poise\u201d (NN 48). With this change in the mind of\nthe Negro artist the aim of art is no longer the presentation of an\nideal type, or an effective counter-stereotype; instead, it is the\nexpression of the universal truth contained in the particularity of\nNegro experiences.\n\nThis is a major theme that runs throughout all of Locke's aesthetic\nphilosophy; the idea that within a particular manifestation of human\nexperience can be found something of universal human significance.\nIndeed, this is the quintessential marker of \u201chigh art\u201d or\n\u201cclassical art\u201d. In the case of the young Negro artist\nLocke claims \u201c[r]ace for them is but an idiom of experience, a\nsort of added enriching adventure and discipline, giving subtler\novertones to life, making it more beautiful and interesting, even if\nmore poignantly so. When viewed from this more objective attitude and\n\u201cso experienced, it affords a deepening rather than narrowing of\nsocial vision\u201d (NN 48).\n\nThe youth \u201cconstitute a new generation, not because of years\nonly, but because of the new aesthetic and a new philosophy of\nlife\u201d (NN 49). Locke explicates this new aesthetic philosophy by\nway of comparison to \u201c[t]he elder generation of Negro\nwriters\u201d who were resigned to expressing themselves in\n\u201ccautious moralism and guarded idealizations\u201d (NN 49).\nThis generation of artists, with\n\nthe repercussions of prejudice\u2026heavy on its heart\u2026felt\nart must fight social battles and compensate social wrongs; \u201cBe\nrepresentative\u201d: put the better foot foremost, was the\nunderlying mood. (NN 50)\n\n\nThis hampered both the individual expressivity of the older generation\nof artists as well as their ability to communicate cross culturally\nthe truth of black experiences. The artist was not free to speak his\nheart or mind, but had to remain cognizant of the way he presented the\nNegro yet again. With the youth of the Harlem Renaissance there came a\n\u201cnewer motive,\u201d for the younger generation of American\nNegro artists the aim \u201cin being racial is to be so purely for\nthe sake of art.\u201d (NN 51) The new artist does not take folksy\nracial types to be emblematic of anything but the individual artist.\nLocke sees this manifested in the artist's ability to make of\n\u201cthe racial substance something technically distinctive,\u201d\na method of giving expression to a specific type of experience that\nallows for full expression of that experience across cultural, racial,\nor ethnic boundaries. In this way techniques that exist as \u201can\nidiom of style may become a contribution to general resources of\nart\u201d; (NN 51) available in the end, not only to those who\ncreated, cultivated and refined them, but to any artist who wished to\ndeal with that particular idiom.\n",
