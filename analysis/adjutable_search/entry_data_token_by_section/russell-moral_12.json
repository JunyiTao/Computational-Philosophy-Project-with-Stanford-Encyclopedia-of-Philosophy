    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || Geach\u2019s Problem\n8.5 Geach\u2019s Problem\n\nBut there is another broadly logical objection to emotivism that is\nmuch more difficult for Russell to meet. The objection was first\nmooted by W.D. Ross (1939) but it was reinvented and refined by P.T.\nGeach (1960, 1965), who modestly attributes it to Frege. Consider the\nfollowing obviously valid argument:\n\n(1)\nIt is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art.\n(2)\nIf it is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art, then\nit is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(3)\nIt is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nIn this argument, the sentence \u201cIt is always good to contemplate\nbeautiful works of art\u201d, occurs twice. In (1) it occurs by\nitself as an assertion; in (2) it occurs unasserted as part of a\nlarger sentence. We know what the sentence is supposed to mean at its\nfirst occurrence\u2014despite its indicative appearance it is really\nin the optative mood and expresses a wish: \u201cWould that everyone\nalways desired to desire to contemplate beautiful works of\nart!\u201d. But what about its second occurrence where it\nappears as the antecedent to a conditional? Is it expressing that wish\nthere? Surely not. For someone can subscribe to the conditional (2)\nwhilst rejecting the relevant wish. For example, we can imagine\nsomebody reasoning like this:\n\n(1\u2032)\nIt is not good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David [perhaps\nbecause it arouses unhealthy sexual appetites for strapping\nfifteen-year-olds].\n(2)\nIf it is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art, then\nit is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(3\u2032)\nIt is not always good to contemplate beautiful works of art.\n\n\nThe person who accepts this argument clearly does not wish\nthat everyone should always desire to contemplate beautiful works of\nart. But she subscribes to premise (2) nonetheless. Thus the sentence\n\u201cit is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art\u201d,\ncannot generally be construed as an optative when it occurs in an\nembedded context (that is when it occurs as a sub-sentence within a\nlarger, more complex sentence). This is already a very damaging\nobjection to Russell\u2019s theory of how \u201cgood\u201d functions,\nsince it shows that the theory is radically incomplete. Russell can\nonly account for a very restricted class of cases, namely those in\nwhich sentences of the form \u201cX is good\u201d are used by\nthemselves to make an assertion, not the numerous cases in which such\nsentences occur, unasserted, as components of larger sentences. (It\nis, so to speak, a theory of the semantic atoms that cannot account\nfor their role within semantic molecules.) But there is worse to come.\nSuppose Russell added one or more epicycles to his theory to explain\nhow \u201cX is good\u201d manages to be meaningful in\nunasserted contexts. The revised theory would have to distinguish\nbetween different uses of \u201cgood\u201d, giving one account for\nasserted contexts and a different account (or set of accounts) for the\nunasserted contexts. Thus \u201cX is good\u201d would\nsometimes be a disguised optative and sometimes something else. (Never\nmind what\u2014it does not really matter.) Now, consider the\nfollowing argument schema:\n\nX is good.\nIf X is good then Q.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nQ\n\n\nIn this argument \u201cX is good\u201d would have one meaning\nin premise (i)\u2014in which it would be an optative\u2014and\nanother in premise (ii)\u2014in which it would be a creature of some\nother semantic kind. (I have emphasized the point by putting the first\noccurrence in italics and the second in bold.) But an argument is only\nvalid if the words involved retain the same meanings throughout the\ninference. If not, we have an instance of the fallacy of equivocation.\nSo it looks as if any attempt to deal with Geach\u2019s first\nproblem by explaining how \u201cgood\u201d works in unasserted\ncontexts would have the unintended side-effect of converting obviously\nvalid arguments such as the above into instances of equivocation. Not\nonly is the theory radically incomplete\u2014if it were\ncompleted, it would reduce a huge number of obviously valid arguments\nto invalidity by construing them as equivocal.\n\nThis is, perhaps, the leading problem for non-cognitivist or\nexpressivist theories of value and a vast amount of ink has been spilt\ntrying to solve it. (See, for instance, A. Miller, 2013,\nContemporary Metaethics: an Introduction, 2nd edn:\n6, 37\u20139, 53\u201367, 68, 70\u20131, 73, 79n23, 89\u2013102,\n118, 127\u201332 & 245 and Schroeder, 2010, Non-Cognitivism\nin Ethics: chs. 3, 4 & 7.) It would take me too far afield to\ndiscuss the matter in detail. Suffice to say that Russell\u2019s theory\nfaces ship-wreck unless this problem can be solved and, in my opinion,\nthe problem is insoluble.\n",
