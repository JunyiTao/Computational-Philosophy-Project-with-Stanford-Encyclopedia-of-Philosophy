    "main_text": "Imitation || Republic 3: impersonation\n2.2 Republic 3: impersonation\n\nPlato cites mim\u00easis as a characteristic of poetry alone\nin Republic Book 3 and Laws Book 4.\n\nBooks 2 and 3 of the Republic assess poetry\u2019s role in the\ncurriculum for the city\u2019s guardian class. The first part of this\npassage, mainly in Book 2, condemns the images of gods and demigods\nthat Homer and the tragedians have produced, both blaspheming and\nsetting bad examples to the young (377e\u2013392c). After this\ncriticism of content Socrates turns to what he labels the \u201cstyle\n[lexis]\u201d of narration. Poetic narration can take place\nthrough narration alone, through mim\u00easis alone, or with\na mix of the two (392d).\n\nAlready this way of differentiating storytelling styles is irregular,\nas if one analyzed walking into pure walking, running, and a\ncombination of the two, as a method for understanding\nrunning. Such an analysis would mark the act of running as\nfailed or deviant walking. Likewise the taxonomy of narrations\npresumes that mim\u00easis is deviant.\n\nThe subsequent pages continue treating mim\u00easis as\nanomalous, or rather as comprehensible only under the sign of anomaly\nand failure. Socrates defines imitation, develops two arguments\nagainst it, and finally proclaims that no mimetic poetry will be\nadmitted into the city that the Republic is founding.\n\nThe defining example establishes mim\u00easis as\nimpersonation. Homer\u2019s poems alternate between third-person accounts\nof events (in which Homer narrates in his own voice) and speeches of\nthe characters involved in those events. When Homer relates\nAgamemnon\u2019s rebuke to the priest Chryses he uses the abusive language\nthat a warriors\u2019 king would use when such a king refused to show mercy\n(393a\u2013c). The presentation of character is, notably, ambiguous\nbetween the act of writing or composing the words of a\ncharacter like Agamemnon, and the act of reciting\n(performing, acting out) the words. The ambiguity (seen also in\nAristophanes) lets Socrates deploy more than one argument against the\npresentation of characters.\n\nThe main argument is blunt but clear, and plausible enough. What the\nnew city really does not want is the presentation of base types,\nbecause acting such parts fosters the behaviors that are found in the\npersons being mimicked (395c\u2013397e). Attempts to read this\nimpersonation as attention to appearance alone (Lear 2011) have the\nadvantage of unifying Book 3 with Book 10, but sacrifice the\npsychological simplicity behind the argument.\n\nIf acting a part does lead to taking on the characteristics of the\npart, then in one respect Plato has a powerful point and in another\nrespect is generating a misleading argument. The point is powerful\ninasmuch as it lets Plato ban all portrayals of vicious and ignoble\ncharacters but not the portrayals of brave soldiers, philosophers, and\nother wholesome types. Moreover the factual premise is believable.\nTaking on someone else\u2019s traits and tics can have a more lasting\neffect than the Republic\u2019s critics sometimes acknowledge.\nActors even today comment on how a role changed them.\n\nEven this most plausible part of the argument runs into trouble.\nPlato\u2019s list of things unworthy of imitation proves surprisingly\ncommodious. Alongside villains one finds women, slaves, animals,\nmusical instruments, gears and pulleys, and sounds of water. And these\nlast examples beg the question. Sounding like machinery does not make\nthe imitator more like a gear or pulley; it must be a deranged\npractice only insofar as all impersonation is deranged. And that is\nwhat the argument was aiming to prove.\n\nBut the significantly misleading nature of the argument goes beyond a\nmoment of overstatement. The case against mim\u00easis\nmisleads in that it exploits the ambiguity between impersonation as\nsomething a writer does and impersonation as the performer\u2019s task. In\n1963 Eric Havelock stressed the importance of this ambiguity to Book\n3; but Havelock understated the degree to which Plato exploited the\nambiguity. The most convincing part of Book 3 has to assume that\nmim\u00easis is performance, both because such effects as\nthunder are mimicked in performance, not on the page; and because the\nbad effects of impersonation on character make more sense when\ndescribing young actors\u2019 playing a vicious role than grown playwrights\nin the act of writing that role.\n\nOn the other hand performance does not involve a whole population.\nMany young male Athenians did participate in choruses for comedy and\ntragedy. Each year a few dozen future farmers and doctors, generals\nand gentlemen, spent a season preparing for their time on stage. Even\nso, the extensiveness of the practice among young people does not\njustify barring all drama from the city and from the sight of each\ncitizen, and that is what Plato\u2019s concluding ban comes to:\n\nIf a man were to arrive in the city whose wisdom [sophia]\nempowered him to become everything and to mimic all\nthings\u2014together with the poems he wanted to perform\n[epideixasthai]\u2014 we would worship him as someone holy\n[hieron] and wonderful and pleasant, but tell him there is no\nman like him in our city, nor by our traditional law [themis]\ncan come to be here; and we would send him off to another city after\npouring myrrh on his head and crowning him with wool. (398a)\n\n\nThe religious language is lavish, and significant. No ordinary deeds\nare being excluded but ones that smell of sacred power. And Plato\u2019s\ncensorship will be complete. The city fathers running mimetic poetry\nout of town have broadened their scope from the young guardians\u2019\neducation to the cultural life of a community. The literary\nrepresentation of characters will receive no hearing anywhere. It is\neven doubtful whether the city will permit dramatic poems to circulate\nin written form. The poet has had to bring his writings with him, and\nhe cannot get his foot in the door.\n\nThe poet is a visitor because mimetic poetry has no natural home in\nthe philosophers\u2019 town. Moreover he arrives offering to recite his\npoems. That they are his makes him a poet, that he comes to\nrecite them makes him a performer. Thus he embodies the\nambiguity built into Book 3\u2019s definition of mim\u00easis. If\nthe fate of imitative composition stands or falls with the fate of\nimitative performance, a reasonable worry about behaviors that young\npeople experiment with balloons into an argument against a mammoth\nbody of literature. In short, the ambiguity in Plato\u2019s definition of\nimitation does not merely remind us (as Havelock argued) that he is\nwitnessing the transition from oral to written culture. It makes\nPlato\u2019s grand conclusion possible.\n\nImitation is a formal concept in Book 3. This is to say 1) that one\ncan distinguish poetic mim\u00easis from poetic narration by\nlooking for a formal element in the poetry; and 2) that\nmim\u00easis may make poetry more deleterious than it would\notherwise be, but does not work these bad effects by itself, only when\nthe characters represented are bad to begin with. The definition of\nimitation in Book 3 entails no general ideas of similarity or\nlikeness. Mim\u00easis functions as a technical term with a\nnarrowly literary meaning, no more inherently philosophical than is\nthe distinction one would draw in English today between direct and\nindirect discourse.\n\nBook 10 will look at imitation from a different perspective. Space\ndoes not permit a review of all existing proposals about how to square\nthe two passages. Whether Books 3 and 10 offer compatible\naccounts of mim\u00easis, and how one might make\nthem compatible, remains the most controversial question about Plato\u2019s\naesthetics. (See Belfiore 1984, Halliwell 1988, Nehamas 1982; and for\na superb summary of the main proposals, Naddaff 2002, 136n8. Lear 2011\nis a recent argument in favor of the two passages\u2019 agreement with one\nanother.) Still one may trust a few summative statements.\nRepublic 10 revises the formal aspects of\nmim\u00easis with a picturing or portrayal that involves\nmore than direct quotation. The enhanced concept cannot be understood\nwithout reference to the Republic\u2019s psychological theory. And\nin its expanded form the term refers to something bad in itself.\n",
