Given the above discussion, it should be clear that Frege\nat some point in Gg endorsed existence claims, either directly\nin his formalism or in his metalanguage, for the following entities:\n\n\nconcepts (more generally, functions)\nextensions (more generally, courses-of-value or value-ranges)\ntruth-values\nnumbers\n\n\nAlthough Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities\n(truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the\nexistence of concepts and extensions are derivable from his Rule of\nSubstitution and Basic Law V, respectively.\n\nIn light of these existence claims, a Kantian might well suggest not\nonly that explicit existence claims are synthetic rather than analytic\n(i.e., aren\u2019t true in virtue of the meanings of the words\ninvolved) but also that since the Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V\nimply existence claims, Frege cannot claim that such principles are\npurely analytic principles of logic. If the Kantian is right, then\nsome other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to\naccount for our knowledge of the existence claims of arithmetic.\n",
