    "main_text": "Problem II: Anomalous Monism || The Ascent to Properties Reconsidered\n5.5 The Ascent to Properties Reconsidered\n\nDavidson replies to his critics in \u201cThinking Causes\u201d\n(Davidson 1993). In that paper he sometimes speaks favorably of\n\u201ccausally efficacious\u201d properties, and he helps himself to\nboth hedged laws and counterfactuals to secure the efficacy of mental\nproperties. But his considered position appears less conciliatory. He\nclearly denies a crucial assumption of his critics, namely, that\ncauses do their causing in virtue of their properties. When an event\ncauses something, it doesn\u2019t do so qua this or that: it\njust causes what it does, full stop. Were this so, none of the\nproperty-based problems discussed here could get off the ground (Crane\n1995; Campbell 1997; Gibb 2006).\n\nSuch a response seems to miss the point (Kim 1993b; McLaughlin 1993;\nSosa 1993). All parties in this dispute agree that mental events can\ncause physical events. The difficulty is to understand how they could\ndo so in virtue of their mental (rather than their physical)\nproperties, how they could have physical effects qua mental.\nThe principle of the Nomological Character of Causation (\u00a75.1)\napparently requires that, when one event causes another, it does so in\nsolely virtue of its physical properties.\n\nBut Davidson is part of a\n nominalist\n tradition that rejects properties, at least as his critics conceive\nof them. Davidson instead formulates anomalous monism in terms of\npredicates and descriptions. An event is mental if it answers to a\nmental predicate (that is, it can be picked out using a mental\ndescription), physical if it answers to a physical predicate (it can\nbe referred to using a physical description). Davidson\u2019s critics\nassume that if an event answers to both sorts of predicate, it\nincludes a mental property and a physical property. But Davidson\nthinks about the mental\u2013physical distinction as merely a\ndifference in description, not as the expression of an ontological\ndivide between kinds of property. For Davidson, then, it makes no more\nsense to ask whether an event had a particular effect in virtue of\nbeing mental or in virtue of being physical than it would to ask\nwhether its effect stemmed from its being described in English or in\nGerman. (For further discussion, see Heil 2009.)\n",
