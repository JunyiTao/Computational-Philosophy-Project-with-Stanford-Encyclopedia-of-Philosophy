    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || The Sensory\n5.2 The Sensory\nSellars\u2019s treatment of the sensory is particularly complex;\nthis article can only summarize.  The context is, again, the idea that\nour concepts of sensory states are, in some important ways, like\ntheoretical concepts.  Concepts of sensory states, however, are\nintroduced to explain different phenomena from those that concepts of\nintentional states are introduced to explain.  They are originally\nintroduced to explain illusions, hallucinations and such, cases in\nwhich people sincerely report and behave as if perceiving something\nthat is not there.  Once introduced for those purposes, however, such\nconcepts must be applied generally: we cannot think that we have\nsensations only in cases of illusion and hallucination.  A\nphilosophically satisfactory theory of the sensory must account for\nthe complexity and peculiarities of the language of sensory\nexperience, both illusory and veridical.\nIt is therefore crucial to my thesis to emphasize that\nsense impressions or raw feels are common sense theoretical constructs\nintroduced to explain the occurrence not of white rat type\ndiscriminative behavior, but rather of perceptual propositional\nattitudes, and are therefore bound up with the explanation of why\nhuman language contains families of predicates having the logical\nproperties of words for perceptible qualities and relations.  (IAMB in\nPP: 387; in ISR: 366)\nSellars then argues that the language of perceptible qualities and\nrelations cannot be reduced to or replaced by any vocabulary we\ncurrently project to be adequate to the behavior of mere physical\nobjects.\nThe argument for this claim is complex.  There is a\nquasi-historical story about how the conception of the proper and\ncommon sensibles has been transformed over the course of human history\nand an argument that this story is constrained in a particular way\nthat blocks a reductive interpretation of our concepts of the sensory\n(the so-called \u2018grain argument\u2019).  Nonetheless, Sellars\nargues that, in the end, sensory states will turn out to be physical\nstates of a very particular ilk that exist only in the context of\nliving organisms.  They are, in the terminology Sellars developed with\nhis colleague Paul Meehl, physical1 but not\nphysical2, where \nPhysical1: an event or entity\nis physical1 if it belongs in the space-time\nnetwork.\nPhysical2: an event or entity\nis physical2 if it is definable in terms of\ntheoretical primitives adequate to describe completely the actual\nstates though not necessarily the potentialities of the universe\nbefore the appearance of life. (CE: 252)\nSensory states are, thus, historically emergent in the universe,\nbut nonetheless physical: the effort to provide a complete description\nand explanation of the physics of sentient beings will expand the\ntheoretical primitives utilized in that science, relocating the\nlogical space of the proper and common sensibles within physics as a\nprimitive vocabulary.  \nThe quasi-history of our sensory concepts starts with a mythical\nbeginning in which the concepts that we think of as concepts of\nsensible qualities are taken to be concepts of the very substance of\nthings.  \u2018Blue triangle\u2019 is construed as we would now\nconstrue \u2018metal triangle\u2019.  But treating sensibles as\nsubstantive cannot go very far; it does not provide a useful way of\nclassifying, explaining, and predicting the behavior of the things we\nencounter.  The sensibles soon become treated as\noccurrent qualities of substances with complex causal profiles.\nThe view that the sensibles are modifications of substances is then\nsupplemented with the notion that they possess a subsidiary and\nanalogous being-for-mind that explains our ability to apprehend them\ndirectly (unlike causal dispositions) and to be sometimes mistaken\nabout their presence.  In the current manifest image, this is how we\nthink of sensible properties, according to Sellars.  Physical objects\nare colored, odorous, etc., but \u2018color,\u2019\n\u2018odor,\u2019etc. also apply in an analogous way to our sensory\nstates.  The rise of a new, atomistic science has started to push our\nconception of the sensibles in new directions.  First, it encourages a\nreinterpretation of the distinction between the common and the proper\nsensibles.  The common sensibles, those available to more than one\nsense, include such geometric and dynamic properties as shape and\nmotion; these apply to physical objects and their microconstituents,\nbecause physical explanations exploit such properties.  The proper\nsensibles are the qualities available only to specific senses,\nincluding colors, odors, etc., and they do not apply to the\nmicroconstituents of physical objects, because they do no explanatory\nwork in physical laws.  Primary and secondary qualities are distinct\nin kind, and secondary qualities are demoted to second-class,\nsubjective status.  They exist only in the mind, as states of the\nperceiver.  The next move seems clear: the mind itself is subjected to\nscientific investigation and becomes increasingly identified with the\nbrain or central nervous system.  But the proper sensibles can no more\nexist in the brain than in any other kind of matter.  This brings us\nto our current predicament: we are unable to find a place in the world\nfor the proper sensibles, which have been brutually (and\nmetaphysically) severed from the common sensibles, even though color\nand extension, for example, seem intrinsically related.\nThis streamlined historical view is combined with the \u2018grain\nargument\u2019, which encapsulates the reasoning that led to the\ndenial that physical objects are really colored.  This argument poses\na challenge to materialism by purporting to show that the proper\nsensibles cannot be reduced to properties or relations of more basic\nphysical particles that lack these properties. \nBefore considering the grain argument per se, however, we\nneed to look at Sellars\u2019s phenomenology of perceptual and\nimaginative experience.  Sellars carefully distinguishes between\npropositional seeing and objectual seeing, and between seeing an\nobject and what we see of the object.  All perceptual\nexperience, in his view, has conceptual content, which shows up\nin the propositional content of a seeing or in what we see an\nobject as.  But he is also firmly convinced that not everything\nin perception is present as conceptual content, as something thought\nof or believed in.  \u201cWe see not only\nthat the ice cube is pink, and see it as pink, we\nsee the very pinkness of the object; also its very shape\n\u2014 though from a certain point of view\u201d (SSOP \u00a725:\n88). What we see of the ice cube is present to us in a\ndifferent way from that in which the (merely) conceptual content of\nour experience is present to us. What is needed is:\nan analysis of the sense in which we see of the pink ice\ncube its very pinkness.  Here, I believe, sheer phenomenology or\nconceptual analysis takes us part of the way, but finally lets\nus down. How far does it take us? Only to the point of assuring us\nthat\n\nSomething, somehow a cube of pink in physical space\nis present in the perception other than as merely believed in\n(SSOP \u00a726: 89).\nSellars takes it that this claim states a structural feature of the\nmanifest image.  It is, note, incompatible with views that reject the idea that\nthere is a nonconceptual component in perception\u2014which Sellars\nwould think are confused about the place of sensible qualities in the\nmanifest image.  The real challenge is filling in the placeholders in\nthe above claim: what kind of thing that is in what kind of way a cube\nof pink in physical space is present in one\u2019s perception, and\nhow can it be present in a way other than as believed in?  \nThe grain argument is meant to cut off reductive replies to these\nquestions.  Sellars\u2019s commentators have often taken it to be a\nvery complex and obscure argument, but Sellars seems to think it is\nfairly straightforward.  The grain argument works only against\nattempts to reduce sensory phenomena to more basic\natomistic/mechanistic entities.  If the world does not have an\nultimate \u2018grain,\u2019 then the argument won\u2019t apply.\nThe notion of a reduction must also be specified, for it is\nnotoriously multivalent.  Sellars\u2019s notion of reduction is\nfairly straightforward:\nif an object is in a strict sense a system of objects,\nthen every property of the object must consist in the fact that its\nconstituents have such and such qualities and stand in such and such\nrelations or, roughly,\n\nevery property of a system of objects consists of\nproperties of, and relations between, its constituents (PSIM in SPR:\n27).\nBut the proper sensibles are not reducible in this way to the\nproperties and relations of micro-objects.\nPink does not seem to be made up of imperceptible\nqualities in the way in which being a ladder is made up of being\ncylindrical (the rungs), rectangular (the frame), wooden, etc. The\nmanifest ice cube presents itself to us as something which is pink\nthrough and through, as a pink continuum, all the regions of which,\nhowever small, are pink. It presents itself to us as ultimately\nhomogeneous; and an ice cube variegated in colour is, though not\nhomogeneous in its specific colour, \u2018ultimately\nhomogeneous\u2019, in the sense to which I am calling attention, with\nrespect to the generic trait of being coloured (PSIM in SPR:\n26).\nIn a world that science teaches us is a blooming, buzzing confusion\nof unobservable submicroscopic entities, there seems to be no room for\nthe smoothly homogeneous, either \u2018out there\u2019 or \u2018in\nthe head.\u2019 The dense, continuous, homogeneously colored objects\nof the manifest image are appearances of systems of\nimperceptible particles.  Sense impressions are posited to explain how\nsystems of particles appear the way they do; they cannot themselves\nturn out to be another kind of system of particles, or the explanation\nfails.\nIf this argument is right, then the postulation of sense\nimpressions must differ in some important ways from the kind of\ntheoretical postulation that typically results in a belief in new\nmicroentities.  And this is what Sellars argues.\n[T]he theory of sense impressions does\nnot introduce, for example, cubical volumes of pink. It\nreinterprets the categorial status of the cubical volumes of\npink of which we are perceptually aware. Conceived in the manifest\nimage as, in standard cases, constituents of physical objects\nand in abnormal cases, as somehow \u2018unreal\u2019 or\n\u2018illusory\u2019, they are recategorized as sensory\nstates of the perceiver and assigned various explanatory roles in the\ntheory of perception\u2026 .  47. The pinkness of a pink\nsensation is \u2018analogous\u2019 to the pinkness of a manifest\npink ice cube, not by being a different quality which is in\nsome respect analogous to pinkness (as the quality a Martian\nexperiences in certain magnetic fields might be analogous to pink with\nrespect to its place in a quality space), but by being the same\n\u2018content\u2019 in a different categorical \u2018form\u2019\n(FMPP III: 73).\nSellars holds, then, that the logical space of the sensible\nqualities has been successively recategorized in different stages of\nhuman development.  He proposes that this history will take one more\nturn as science develops further: unable to reduce or eliminate the\nsensibles, science will postulate a distinctive set of\nentities, sensa, to be the final embodiment of the sensible\nqualities, physical1 but not physical2.  Sellars\nis a physicalist about color, not because he thinks colors can be\nreduced to more basic properties and relations of physical objects,\nbut because physics will have to expand to accommodate the sensible\nqualities, color included, as primitive entities.  \nThere are still further twists and turns in Sellars\u2019s\ntreatment of the sensory.
