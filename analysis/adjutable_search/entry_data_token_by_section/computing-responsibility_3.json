    "main_text": "Challenges to moral responsibility || Free to act\n1.3 Free to act\n\nThe freedom to act is probably the most important condition for\nattributing moral responsibility and also one of the most contested\n(Talbert 2022). We tend to excuse people from moral blame if they had\nno other choice but to act in the way that they did. We typically do\nnot hold people responsible if they were coerced or forced to take\nparticular actions. In moral philosophy, the freedom to act can also\nmean that a person has free will or autonomy (Fisher 1999). Someone\ncan be held morally responsible because she acts on the basis of her\nown authentic thoughts and motivations and has the capacity to control\nher behavior (Johnson 2001). Note that this conception of autonomy is\ndifferent from the way the term \u2018autonomy\u2019 is often used\nin computer science, where it tends to refer to the ability of a robot\nor computer system to independently perform (i.e. without the\n\u2018human in the loop\u2019) complex tasks in unpredictable\nenvironments for extended periods of time (Noorman 2009, Zerilli et al\n2021).\n\nNevertheless, there is little consensus on what capacities human\nbeings have, that other entities do not have, which enables them to\nact freely (see the entries on\n free will,\n autonomy in moral and political philosophy,\n personal autonomy\n and\n compatibilism).\n Does it require rationality, emotion, intentionality or cognition?\nIndeed, one important debate in moral philosophy centers on the\nquestion of whether human beings really have autonomy or free will?\nAnd, if not, can moral responsibility still be attributed (Talbert\n2022)?\n\nIn practice, attributing autonomy or free will to humans on the basis\nof the fulfillment of a set of conditions turns out to be a less than\nstraightforward endeavor. We attribute autonomy to persons in degrees.\nAn adult is generally considered to be more autonomous than a child.\nAs individuals in a society our autonomy is thought to vary because we\nare manipulated, controlled or influenced by forces outside of\nourselves, such as by our parents or through peer pressure. Moreover,\ninternal physical or psychological influences, such as addictions or\nmental problems, are perceived as further constraining the autonomy of\na person.\n\nComputing, like other technologies, adds an additional layer of\ncomplexity to determining whether someone is free to act, as it\naffects the choices that humans have and how they make them. One of\nthe biggest application areas of computing is the automation of\ndecision-making processes and control. Automation can help to\ncentralize and increase control over multiple processes for those in\ncharge, while it limits the discretionary power of human operators on\nthe lower-end of the decision-making chain. An example is provided by\nthe automation of decision-making in public administration (Bovens and\nZouridis 2002). Large public sector organizations have over the last\ndecades progressively standardized and formalized their production\nprocesses. In a number of countries, the process of issuing decisions\nabout (student) loans, social benefits, speeding tickets or tax\nreturns is carried out to a significant extent by computer systems.\nThis has reduced the scope of the administrative discretion that many\nofficials, such as tax inspectors, welfare workers, and policy\nofficers, have in deciding how to apply formal policy rules in\nindividual cases (Eubanks 2018). In some cases, citizens no longer\ninteract with officials that have significant responsibility in\napplying their knowledge of the rules and regulations to decide what\nis appropriate (e.g., would it be better to let someone off with a\nwarning or is a speeding ticket required?). Rather, decisions are\npre-programmed in the algorithms that apply the same measures and\nrules regardless of the person or the context (e.g., a speeding camera\ndoes not care about the context or personal circumstances), and the\nhuman beings that citizens do interact with have little opportunity to\ninterrogate or change decisions (Dignum 2020). Responsibility for\ndecisions made, in these cases, has moved from \u2018street-level\nbureaucrats\u2019 to the \u2018system-level bureaucrats\u2019, such\nas managers and computer experts, that decide on how to convert policy\nand legal frameworks into algorithms and decision-trees (Bovens and\nZouridis 2002).\n\nThe automation of bureaucratic processes illustrates that some\ncomputer technologies are intentionally designed to limit the\ndiscretion of some human beings. An example is the anti-alcohol lock\nthat is already in use in a number of countries, including the USA,\nCanada, Sweden and the UK. It requires the driver to pass a breathing\ntest before she can start the car. This technology forces a particular\nkind of action and leaves the driver with hardly any choice. Other\ntechnologies might have a more subtle way of steering behavior, by\neither persuading or nudging users (Verbeek 2016). For example, the\nonboard computer devices in some cars that show, in real-time,\ninformation about fuel consumption can encourage the driver to\noptimize fuel efficiency. Such technologies are designed with the\nexplicit aim of making humans behave responsibly by limiting their\noptions or persuading them to choose in a certain way.\n\nNot all these technologies are designed to stimulate morally good\nbehavior. Yeung notes that these kinds of decision-guidance techniques\nhave become a key element of current day Big-Data analytic techniques,\nas used on social media and in advertising. She argues that these\n\u2018hyper nudges\u2019 are extremely powerful techniques to\nmanipulate the behaviour of internet users and users of Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices due to their networked, continuously updated,\ndynamic and pervasive nature. As they gather data from a wide range of\nsources about users to continuously make predictions in real-time\nabout the habits and preferences of users, they can target\nadvertisement, information and price incentives to gently and\nunobtrusively nudge these users in directions preferred by the those\nthat control the algorithms (Yeung, 2017). When these nudges are\nhardly noticeable and have a powerful effect, one can wonder how\nautonomous the decision making of these users is. This is the case,\nfor example, with dark patterns, which use interfaces on websites or\napps that are designed to trick users to do things that did not intend\nto do, such as purchasing additional expensive insurance (Ravenscraft\n2020). \n\nVerbeek notes that critics of the idea of intentionally developing\ntechnology to enforce morally desirable behavior have argued that it\njettisons the democratic principles of our society and threatens human\ndignity. They argue that it deprives humans of their ability and\nrights to make deliberate decisions and to act voluntarily. In\naddition, critics have claimed that if humans are not acting freely,\ntheir actions cannot be considered moral. These objections can be\ncountered, as Verbeek argues, by pointing to the rules, norms,\nregulations and a host of technological artifacts that already set\nconditions for actions that humans are able or allowed to perform.\nMoreover, he notes, technological artifacts, as active mediators,\naffect the actions and experiences of humans, but they do not\ndetermine them. Some people have creatively circumvented the strict\nmorality of earlier versions of the alcohol lock by having an air pump\nin the car (Vidal 2004). Nevertheless, these critiques underline the\nissues at stake in automating decision-making processes: computing can\nset constraints on the freedom a person has to act and thus affects\nthe extent to which she can be held morally responsible.\n\nThe challenges that computer technologies present with regard to the\nconditions for ascribing responsibility indicate the limitations of\nconventional ethical frameworks in dealing with the question of moral\nresponsibility. Traditional models of moral responsibility seem to be\ndeveloped for the kinds of actions performed by an individual that\nhave directly visible consequences (Waelbers 2009, Coeckelbergh\n2009). However, in today\u2019s society attributions of\nresponsibility to an individual or a group of individuals are\nintertwined with the artifacts with which they interact as well as\nwith intentions and actions of other human agents that these artifacts\nmediate. Acting with computer technologies may require a different\nkind of analysis of who can be held responsible and what it means to\nbe morally responsible. Below I discuss two ways in which scholars\nhave taken up this challenge: 1) reconsidering what it means to be a\nmoral agent and 2) reconsidering the concept of moral\nresponsibility.\n",
