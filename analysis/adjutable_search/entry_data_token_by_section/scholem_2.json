Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism and Origins of the Kabbala\n\n\nIt is not without irony that Scholem's most celebrated works\nwere written in German or Hebrew yet his most popular and arguably most\ninfluential work Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism was written\nin English at a time when most scholarship in Judaica was still being\nwritten in German. By the end of the 1930's Scholem was already\nhard at work on Sabbateanism which would result in a major book (two\nvolumes in Hebrew, one large volume in English) entitled Sabbatei\nZevi: Mystical Messiah. A preliminary study on Sabbatean\nantinomianism \u201cRedemption through Sin\u201d was published in\n1936 and then appeared in English in 1970. During that time, in the\nlate 1930's, Scholem received an invitation from the Jewish\nInstitute of Religion in New York City to deliver a series of lectures\non Jewish Mysticism. He accepted the invitation and wrote the lectures\nin English (a first for him). These lectures were subsequently\npublished as Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism in 1941. This\nwork was a watershed for the entire field of Kabbala studies and Jewish\nStudies more generally. For the first time he offered a synoptic yet\ndetailed presentation of the entire history of Kabbala beginning with\nthe German Rhineland pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz) from the\n12th century until Hasidism in the 18th and\n19th centuries. In this work Scholem presents his theory of\nthe authorship and construction of the Zohar, one of the first\nprogrammatic studies of the enigmatic kabbalist Abraham Abulafia, and\noffers the first glimpses of his own historiography. Moreover, the last\npage of Major Trends presents a few parenthetical observations\nabout the \u201cpossibility for Jewish mysticism today\u201d that\nwould occupy a number of essays later in his career. His\nhistoriographical musings in Major Trends are important\nbecause it is here we are presented with Scholem's dialectical\napproach to history and his claim, for example, that Lurianic Kabbala\nwith its intense focus on creation as rupture and catastrophe was a\nresponse to the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492. This suggests that\nkabbalistic circles were using metaphysics to reify historical reality,\nwhich led Scholem to coin the term \u201chistoriosophy\u201d to\ndescribe his understanding of history and metaphysics. It also offers\nanother first glimpse of his work on Sabbateanism which Scholem claimed\nwas a heretical but not necessary deviant form of Jewish mysticism. By\nthat I mean that even fairly early in his career Scholem held that\nKabbala is a theology that requires a normative law (tradition)\n\u2014 largely as a foil \u2014 but is always in dialectical\ntension with that law. The fact that antinomianism rose to the surface\nin the Sabbatean movement, breaking the normative tradition through its\ncombination of messianism and mysticism, should not be seen as an\naberration as much as a tragic inevitability. This Sabbatean heresy,\nargued Scholem, did not end with the failure of the movement but\ninfluenced, and even set the conditions for, Jewish modernity. His\nspeculations about possible influences between Sabbatean and Reform\nJudaism in Hungary were duly criticized by Jacob Katz for lack of\nhistorical evidence. However, the more theoretical and structural point\nabout Kabbala more generally and Sabbateanism in particular as being in\ntension with normative Jewish law (halakha) and the ways that\nSabbateanism may have (indirectly) informed early Reform which rejected\nhalakha outright is a topic worthy of further thought even though it\nmay be historically unprovable. While direct links between Sabbateans\nand Reformers have not been definitively unearthed, the geographical\nproximity of Sabbateans and early Reformers in Hungary and the extent\nto which Sabbateans functioned in clandestine ways is curious.\n\n\nOne of the great merits of Major Trends, and why it has\nbeen as influential as it has, is that all the \u201ctrends\u201d\nincluded therein are set side by side to give one a sense that there is\na definite trajectory to mystical Judaisms even if that trajectory does\nnot follow a straight line. The descriptive part of the book begins (in\nChapter 2) with hekhalot mysticism and other pre-rabbinic and\nrabbinic mysticisms that appear in such apocryphal works as the Book of\nEnoch, including angelology and magic. It then moves on to the\nRhineland German pietists, Abraham Abulafia and only then reaches the\ntextus classicus of medieval Kabbala, the Zohar. What are\nconspicuous in their absence are Sefer Yezeria (the Book of\nCreation) and Sefer ha-Bahir (the Book of Illumination). These\nomissions are intentional. This work is intended to discuss major\ntrends in Jewish mysticism and not major trends in\nKabbala. The distinction is an important one for Scholem. He\ndevotes another work called the Origins of the Kabbala (that\nappears in different versions in German, Hebrew, and English) where he\npresents a detailed analysis of the emergence of Kabbala beginning with\nthe Bahir and the Provencal circle, and maturing in Castile and Gerona\nin the two centuries immediately preceding the appearance of the Zohar\nin Guadalajara Spain at the end of the 13th century. The\nfirst chapter of Major Trends offers us one of Scholem's\nearliest lengthy statements on the phenomenology of mysticism that is\nexpanded later in his lectures at the Eranos conferences and published\nin the 1960's. It is here Scholem tries to define\n\u201cmysticism\u201d (he admits he is unsuccessful in doing so) and\nit is here he reveals some of the people he values as preceding him in\nthis endeavor (both Jewish and Christian scholars of Kabbala). This\nfirst chapter is an important part of Scholem's early move to\nexpand beyond the formal study of Kabbala into the area of philosophy\nof religion.\n\n\nScholem is convinced that Kabbala is a medieval phenomenon. That is,\nwhile there are important works of Jewish mysticism composed before the\nMiddle Ages, the metaphysics and cosmology we know as Kabbala emerges\nas a reaction against the rationalism of medieval Jewish philosophy\nthat posits a distant and unapproachable God in line with the\nAristotelian and Platonic (and Neoplatonic) schools. These kabbalists,\nwhile protesting such rationalism, were themselves very influenced by\ntwo dominant trends: Gnosticism and Neo-Platonism. In his\nOrigins, Scholem traces both Gnostic and Neoplatonic\ninfluences on these early kabbalistic thinkers, viewing them as deeply\nembedded in their medieval context. Kabbala in this period emerged in\nthree locales: Provence, Castile, and Gerona and included prominent\nrabbinic figures, most importantly Moses Nahmanides. Origins of the\nKabbala begins with an analysis of the Book Bahir (taken\nlargely from his doctoral thesis) a work Scholem claims emerges from a\ncircle of mystics led by the enigmatic Isaac the Blind in Provence\nalthough he suggests some strata of this enigmatic work may originate\nin some unknown Jewish Gnostic groups. For Scholem, the Bahir\nis the first book of Kabbala. When we move to Castile and Gerona,\nKabbala becomes more actively engaged in posing an alternative theology\nto rationalist philosophy. Scholem maintains that the Gerona school was\nnot an independent entity but more of an extension of the earlier\nProvencal circle that produced the Bahir. This polemic (between\nphilosophers and kabbalists and between Talmudists and kabbalists)\ncontinued until the end of the sixteenth century when Kabbala won the\nhearts and minds of many Jews after the Spanish expulsion in 1492 and\nthe forced conversions and expulsions in Portugal in 1496. Scholem\nargued this was in large part due to two factors: First, that\nphilosophy too easily justified bogus Jewish conversion, that is, the\nchoice to internalize Judaism and abandon outward ritual; and more\nimportantly, that philosophy could not offer solace for the historical\ncrisis of the expulsion. After the expulsion Kabbala moves from the\nperiphery to become the default theology of Judaism. It is in these\npolemical centuries, however, that Kabbala develops its most important\nfeatures that become the foundation of all subsequent Kabbala. One is\nits emanationist theory of creation and the descent of divine effluence\ninto the world. Another is its elaborate version of ta'amei\nha-mitzvot or reasons for the commandments (a discipline initiated\nin its medieval form by the most famous Jewish rationalist Moses\nMaimonides). Unlike many earlier pre-kabbalistic mysticisms, this\ninextricably connects mystical doctrine to Jewish law and ritual. A\nclassic example of this is Ezra of Gerona's Ta'amei\nha-Mitzvot printed erroneously in the name of Nahmanides. Another\nis the beginning of kabbalistic exegesis of Scripture. Bahya ben Asher\nof Saragossa's kabbalistic commentary is a classical example of\nthis phenomenon in the pre-zoharic period that is expanded and deepened\nlater in the Zohar and its commentaries. Yet another is the\nproliferation of mystical commentaries on prayer that first emerge in\nthe Provencal fraternities of Isaac the Blind. Finally in this period\nwe see the first systematic cosmologies that become templates for later\nkabbalistic doctrine. One example would be Azriel of Gerona's\nSefer Esser Sephirot. I will discuss the historiographic\nissues implicit in these two works in another section. Suffice it to\nsay that given the many publications of Scholem in this middle period\nof his career, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism and\nOrigins of the Kabbala stand out as the most important and\ninfluential. \n",
