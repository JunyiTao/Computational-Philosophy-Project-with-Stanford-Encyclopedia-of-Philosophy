    "main_text": "Results Related to the Incompleteness Theorems || Concrete Cases of Unprovable Statements\n4.5 Concrete Cases of Unprovable Statements\n\nThe undecidable sentences provided by G\u00f6del\u2019s proofs are\n(if written out) extremely complicated formulas with no intuitive\nsignificance, construed only for the purposes of the incompleteness\nproofs. The question then arises whether there are any simple and\nnatural mathematical statements which are likewise undecidable in\nchosen basic theories, e.g., in PA. There are now\nvarious specific statements with clear mathematical content which are\nknown to be undecidable in some standard theories (though, just how\nnatural even these are has been disputed; see Feferman 1989b). Some\nwell known, natural examples are listed below, beginning with some\nquite natural mathematical statements which are independent of\nPA, and proceeding to more and more powerful\ntheories. Sometimes such results are called variants of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, or their proofs of independence\nalternative proofs of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, but this is\nmisleading: interesting as they may be, they don\u2019t have the\ngenerality of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems proper, but only provide\nstatements independent of a particular theory.\n\nIt is often stated that before the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem\n(see below), no such natural independent mathematical statements were\nknown. This is not, however, strictly speaking, correct. Already much\nearlier, around 1935, Gerhard Gentzen (see the entry on the\n development of proof theory)\n had provided such a statement. It is very natural to generalize the\nidea of induction from the domain of natural numbers to the domain of\nordinal numbers. In set theory, such generalizations are called\nprinciples of transfinite induction. Though some constructivists may\nbe sceptical about the legitimacy of full set theory, there are\nlimited and more concrete cases of transfinite induction (only dealing\nwith some well-defined classes of countable ordinals) that are\nperfectly acceptable even from the constructivist or intuitionist\nviewpoint. One important case is the principle of transfinite\ninduction up to the ordinal called \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Gentzen\nshowed that the consistency of PA can be proved if\nthis transfinite induction principle is assumed. Therefore, because of\nthe second incompleteness theorem, the principle itself cannot be\nprovable in PA (Gentzen 1936).\n\nRamsey\u2019s theorem is a result in infinitary combinatorics,\nestablished by Frank Ramsey (1930), and deals with possibilities of\n\u201ccolouring\u201d for certain graphs. Jeff Paris and Leo\nHarrington formulated a finitary variant of Ramsey\u2019s theorem,\nand showed that it is not provable in PA (Paris &\nHarrington 1977). This provides a quite natural statement of finite\ncombinatorics which is independent of PA. Perhaps an\neven cleaner example is Goodstein\u2019s theorem, due to Reuben\nGoodstein (1944), which is purely number theoretic in nature. First\none defines a certain natural class of sequences of natural numbers,\nnow called \u201cGoodstein sequences\u201d. The theorem states that\nevery Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Goodstein\u2019s\ntheorem is certainly a natural mathematical statement, for it was\nformulated and proved (obviously by proof methods that go beyond\nPA) by Goodstein long before (that is, in 1944) it\nwas shown, in 1982, that the theorem is not provable in\nPA (Kirby & Paris 1982). \n\nMoving now to stronger theories beyond PA, one can\nmention, for example, Kruskal\u2019s Theorem. This is a theorem which\nconcerns certain orderings of finite trees (Kruskal 1960). Harvey\nFriedman showed that this theorem is unprovable even in subsystems of\nsecond-order arithmetic much stronger than PA (see\nSimpson 1985). In particular, it is not provable in any theory which\nis predicatively justified (under a widely accepted explication of\n\u201cpredicative\u201d, cf. the section on predicativism in the\nentry on the\n philosophy of mathematics).\n\nThere are some concrete examples of mathematical statements undecided\neven in stronger theories which come from the so-called descriptive\nset theory. This field of mathematics is related to topology and was\ninitiated by the French semi-intuitionists (Lebesgue, Baire, Borel;\nsee the section on descriptive set theory, etc., in the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics).\n It studies sets which possess relatively simple definitions (in\ncontradistinction to the ideas of arbitrary sets and various higher\npower-sets, which the semi-intuitionists rejected as meaningless)\ncalled projective or analytic sets. Classically these were defined as\nthe sets that can be built up from a countable intersection of open\nsets by taking continuous images and complements finitely many times;\nthey coincide with the sets which are definable in the language of\nP\\(^2\\). In particular, the so-called Borel sets can\nbe simply defined both by a formula of the form \\(\\exists XA(x)\\) and\nby a formula of the form \\(\\forall XB(x)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do\nnot contain any set variables (in logician\u2019s terminology, Borel\nsets are the \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\) sets). A Borel function is defined\nanalogously (see, e.g., Martin 1977).\n\nHarvey Friedman has established the following theorem: roughly, if\n\\(S\\) is a Borel set, then there exists a Borel function \\(f\\)\nsuch that the graph of \\(f\\) is either included in or disjoint from\n\\(S\\). Friedman showed that this simple-sounding theorem is not\nprovable even in full second-order arithmetic\nP\\(^2\\), but proving it necessarily requires\nthe full power of ZFC (see Simpson 1999: 23).\n\nFurther, it was a traditional question of descriptive set theory (a\nquestion which can be formulated in the language of second order\narithmetic) whether all projective sets (see above) are Lebesque\nmeasurable. This remained an open problem for many decades, and for a\ngood reason: it turned out that the statement is independent even of\nthe full ZFC set theory (see Solovay 1970). Only by\npostulating the existence of some extremely large cardinals (so-called\nWoodin cardinals) can the hypothesis that all projective sets are\nLebesque measurable be proved (this was achieved as a consequence of\ntheir work on so-called projective determinacy by Woodin, Martin and\nSteel; see Woodin 1988; Martin & Steel 1988, 1989). \n\nSometimes Paul Cohen\u2019s celebrated result that the Continuum\nHypothesis (CH) is independent of ZFC (Cohen 1963,\n1964; see the entry on\n independence and large cardinals).\n However, this case is very different. In all the above independence\nresults the relevant statements are still theorems of mathematics,\ntaken as shown to be true (the last case, which requires large\ncardinal axioms that go beyond ZFC, is more\ncontroversial; still, at least many set-theoreticians find such axioms\nplausible). And with the first incompleteness theorem itself, the\ntruth of the unprovable statement easily follows, given that the\nassumption of the consistency of the system is indeed correct.\nHowever, in the case of Cohen\u2019s result, there is absolutely no\nindication whether CH should be considered true, false, or perhaps\nlacking a truth-value. \n",
