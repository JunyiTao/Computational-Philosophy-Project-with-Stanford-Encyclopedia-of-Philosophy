    "main_text": "The intuitive primacy of positive truths\n6. The intuitive primacy of positive truths\n\nHenri Bergson maintained that the positive nature of reality pre-empts\nnothingness (Sorensen 2022, 283). The absence of green mammals is not\na brute fact. \u2018There are no green mammals\u2019 is made true by\na positive fact that all mammals are hairy and there are only two\npigments for hair - one producing black or brown hair, the other\nyellow or reddish orange. No mixture of those pigments yields green.\nOnce we have the positive facts and the notion of negation, we can\nderive all the negative facts. \u2018There is nothing\u2019 would be\na contingent, negative fact. But then it would have to be grounded on\nsome positive reality. That positive reality would ensure that there\nis something rather than nothing.\n\nHuman beings have a strong intuition that positive truths, such as\n\u2018Elephants are huge\u2019 are more fundamental than negative\ntruths such as \u2018Elephants do not jump\u2019. The robustness of\nthis tendency makes negative things objects of amusement. Consider the\nProfessor\u2019s remark during his chilly banquet in Lewis\nCarroll\u2019s Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ll enjoy the dinner\u2014such as it is; and\nthat you won\u2019t mind the heat\u2014such as it\nisn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nThe sentence sounded well, but somehow I couldn\u2019t quite\nunderstand it \u2026 (chapter 22)\n\n\nHow can we perceive absences? They seem causally inert and so not the\nsort of thing that we could check empirically. Negative truths seem\nredundant; there are no more truths than those entailed by the\nconjunction of all positive truths. The negative truths seem\npsychological; we only assert negative truths to express a frustrated\nexpectation. When Jean Paul Sartre (1969, 41) arrives late for his\nappointment with Pierre at the cafe, he sees the absence of Pierre but\nnot the absence of the Duke of Wellington.\n\nPhilosophers have had much trouble vindicating any of these\nintuitions. They still try to preserve as much of the positivity as\nthey can. For instance, Stephen Mumford (2021) characterizes himself\nas a \u201csoft Parmenidean\u201d. His 21st century willingness to\ntolerate some negativity is informed by Bertrand Russell\u2019s 20th\ncentury failure to reduce negative truths to positive truths. Russell\n(1985) tried paraphrasing \u2018The cat is not on the mat\u2019 as\n\u2018There is a state of affairs incompatible with the cat being on\nthe mat\u2019. But this paraphrase is covertly negative; it uses\n\u2018incompatible\u2019 which means not compatible. He\ntried modeling \u2018Not p\u2019 as an expression of\ndisbelief that p. But \u2018disbelief\u2019 means believing\nthat something is not the case. Is it even clear that\nabsences are causally inert? Trapped miners are killed by the absence\nof oxygen. In the end Russell surrendered his intuition that reality\nis positive. In a famous lecture at Harvard, Russell concluded that\nirreducibly negative facts exist. He reports this nearly caused a\nriot.\n\nWere it not for the threat to social order, one might stand the\nintuition on its head: Negative truths are more fundamental than\npositive truths. From a logical point of view, there is greater\npromise in a reduction of positive truths to negative truths. Positive\ntruths can be analyzed as the negations of negative truths or perhaps\nas frustrated disbelief. Positive truths would then be the redundant\nhanger-ons, kept in circulation by our well-documented difficulty in\ncoping with negative information. Think of photographic negatives.\nThey seem less informative than positive prints. But since the prints\nare manufactured from the negatives, the negatives must be merely more\ndifficult for us to process.\n\nAs difficult as negation might be psychologically, it is easier to\nwork with than the alternatives suggested by Henry Sheffer. In 1913,\nhe demonstrated that all of the logical connectives can be defined in\nterms of the dual of conjunction, now known as NAND (short for NOT\nAND). Sheffer translates \u2018p NAND q\u2019 as\n\u2018either not p or not q\u2019. \u2018Not\np\u2019 is defined as \u2018p NAND\np\u2019. Sheffer notes that the dual of disjunction, NOR\n(short for NOT OR), can also define all the connectives. Sheffer\ntranslates \u2018p NOR q\u2019 as \u2018neither\np nor q\u2019. From a logical point of view,\nnegation is dispensable. This raises hope that all of\nParmenides\u2019 paradoxes of negation can be translated away.\n\nBertrand Russell quickly incorporated NAND into Principia\nMathematica. Sheffer\u2019s functions have also been a great\neconomy to the assembly line symbol manipulation of computers (as\nwitnessed by the popularity of NAND gates and NOR gates). However,\nhuman beings have trouble achieving fluency with Sheffer\u2019s\nconnectives. Even Sheffer translates them negatively. Psychologically,\nthe phrases \u2018either not p or not q\u2019 and\n\u2018neither p nor q\u2019 are each heard as a\ndouble dose of negation rather than as an alternative to negation.\n\nBut we could let computers do our metaphysics just as we let them do\nour taxes. The only serious objection is that the problems of negation\ndo not really go away when we translate into artificial languages. For\ninstance, the challenge posed by negative existential sentences such\nas \u2018Pegasus does not exist\u2019 persists when translated as\n\u2018Pegasus exists NAND Pegasus exists\u2019. Any desire to make\n\u2018Pegasus does not exist\u2019 come out true warrants a desire\nto make \u2018Pegasus exists NAND Pegasus exists\u2019 come out\ntrue. (Since classical logic does not permit empty names, the NAND\nexistential sentence will not be true.)\n\nThe more general concern is that the problems which are naturally\ncouched in terms of negation persist when they are translated into a\ndifferent logical vocabulary. Given that the translation preserves the\nmeaning of the philosophical riddle, it will also preserve its\ndifficulty.\n\nWe engage in negative thinking to avoid highly complicated positive\nthinking. What is the probability of getting at least one head in ten\ntosses of a coin? Instead of directly computing the probability of\nthis highly disjunctive positive event, we switch to a negative\nperspective. We first calculate the probability of a total absence of\nheads and then exploit the complement rule: Probability (at least one\nhead) = 1 \u2212 Probability (no heads). An apt anagram of NEGATIVISM\nis TIMESAVING.\n\nSome possible worlds are easier to contemplate negatively. Thales said\nthat all is water. Suppose he was nearly right except for the\nexistence of two bubbles. These two absences of water become the\ninteresting players (just as two drops of water in an otherwise empty\nspace become interesting players in the dual of this universe). How\nwould these bubbles relate to each other? Would the bubbles repel each\nother? Would the bubbles be mutually unaffected? Deep thinking about\ngravity yields the conclusion that the bubbles would attract each\nother! (Epstein 1983, 138\u20139)\n\nThe hazard of drawing metaphysical conclusions from psychological\npreferences is made salient by caricatures. We know that caricatures\nare exaggerated representations. Despite the flagrant distortion (and\nactually because of it) we more easily recognize people from moderate\ncaricatures rather than from faithful portraits.\n\nFor navigational purposes, we prefer schematic subway maps over ones\nthat do justice to the lengths and curves of the track lines. But this\nis not a basis for inferring that reality is correspondingly\nschematic.\n\nOur predilection for positive thinking could reflect an objective\nfeature of our world (instead of being a mere anthropocentric\nprojection of one style of thought). But if this objective\npositiveness is itself contingent, then it does not explain why there\nis something rather than nothing. For Bergson\u2019s explanation to\nsucceed, the positive nature of reality needs to be a metaphysically\nnecessary feature.\n",
