    "main_text": "Triadism and the Universal Categories\n9. Triadism and the Universal Categories\n\n\nMerely to say that Peirce was extremely fond of placing things into\ngroups of three, of trichotomies, and of triadic relations, would fail\nmiserably to do justice to the overwhelming obtrusiveness in his\nphilosophy of the number three. Indeed, he made the most fundamental\ncategories of all \u201cthings\u201d of any sort whatsoever the\ncategories of \u201cFirstness,\u201d \u201cSecondness,\u201d and\n\u201cThirdness,\u201d and he often described \u201cthings\u201d\nas being \u201cfirsts\u201d or \u201cseconds\u201d or\n\u201cthirds.\u201d For example, with regard to the trichotomy\n\u201cpossibility,\u201d \u201cactuality,\u201d and\n\u201cnecessity,\u201d possibility he called a first, actuality he\ncalled a second, and necessity he called a third. Again: quality was a\nfirst, fact was a second, and habit (or rule or law) was a\nthird. Again: entity was a first, relation was a second, and\nrepresentation was a third. Again: rheme (by which Peirce meant a\nrelation of arbitrary adicity or arity) was a first, proposition was a\nsecond, and argument was a third. The list goes on and on. Let us\nrefer to Peirce\u2019s penchant for describing things in terms of\ntrichotomies and triadic relations as Peirce\u2019s\n\u201ctriadism.\u201d\n\n\nIf Peirce had a general technical rationale for his triadism, Peirce\nscholars have not yet made it abundantly clear what this rationale\nmight be. He seemed to base his triadism on what he called\n\u201cphaneroscopy,\u201d by which word he meant the mere\nobservation of phenomenal appearances. He regularly commented that the\nphenomena in the phaneron just do fall into three groups and\nthat they just do display irreducibly triadic relations. He\nseemed to regard this matter as simply open for verification by direct\ninspection.\n\n\nAlthough there are many examples of phenomena that do seem more or\nless naturally to divide into three groups, Peirce seems to have been\ndriven by something more than mere examples in his insistence on\napplying his categories to almost everything imaginable. Perhaps it\nwas the influence of Kant, whose twelve categories divide into four\ngroups of three each. Perhaps it was the triadic structure of the\nstages of thought as described by Hegel. Perhaps it was even the\ntriune commitments of orthodox Christianity (to which Peirce, at least\nin some contexts and during some swings of mood, seemed to\nsubscribe). Certainly involved was Peirce\u2019s commitment to the\nineliminability of mind in nature, for Peirce closely associated the\nactivities of mind with the aforementioned triadic relation that he called\nthe \u201csign\u201d relation. (More on this topic appears below.)\nAlso involved was Peirce\u2019s so-called \u201creduction thesis\u201d in\nlogic (on which more will given below), to which Peirce had concluded\nas early as 1870.\n\n\nIt is difficult to imagine even the most fervently devout of the\npassionate admirers of Peirce, of which there are many, saying that\nhis account (or, more accurately, his various accounts) of the three\nuniversal categories is (or are) absolutely clear and compelling. Yet,\nin almost everything Peirce wrote from the time the categories were\nfirst introduced, Peirce\u2019s firsts, seconds, and thirds found a\nplace. Giving their exact and general analysis and providing an exact\nand general account of their rationale, if there be such, constitute\nchief problems in Peirce scholarship.\n",
