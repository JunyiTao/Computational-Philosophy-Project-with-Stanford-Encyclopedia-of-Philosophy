    "main_text": "Other Topics and Approaches || Feminist epistemology\n6.3 Rationality debates\n\nIn addition to being of central interest within TE,\nrationality is central to our self-conception: Aristotle held\nthat we are \u201crational animals\u201d, a presumption built into\nthe very name of our species (\u201chomo sapiens\u201d);\nand the thought that humans are rational, perhaps distinctively so,\nappears to be part of the popular fabric of thought about ourselves.\nThere is long-standing disagreement among epistemologists as to the\nnature of epistemic rationality\n(\u201crationality\u201d)\u2014which, on one understanding, is\ndistinguished from other forms of rationality by being concerned with\nthe effective pursuit of the distinctively cognitive-epistemic end of\ntrue belief. There has also recently arisen heated debate\u2014often\ntermed \u201cthe Rationality Wars\u201d\u2014among psychologists\nand philosophers of psychology concerning what we should say in the\nface of empirical findings about humans\u2019 apparently\ndisappointing performance on certain \u201creasoning tasks\u201d.\nAccording to some, those results force us to confront the possibility\nthat humans may in fact be quite irrational. According to others, such\nresults, together with a psychologically realistic view of how human\nreasoning actually proceeds, point up the need to revise standard\nviews of what rationality involves. (Much of the resulting debate\nrecapitulates, in broad terms, the debate within TE as to the nature\nof justified, or rational,\n belief.[28])\n\nFor example, well-known experimental findings\u2014e.g., those of\nTversky and Kahneman (1982) concerning probabilistic reasoning, and\nthose of Wason (1968) concerning deductive reasoning\u2014cannot be\ntaken to illustrate failures in rationality unless we assume what\nStein (1996) calls \u201cthe Standard Picture\u201d (SP):\n\n\nAccording to this picture, to be rational is to reason in accordance\nwith principles of reasoning that are based on rules of logic,\nprobability theory and so forth. If the standard picture of reasoning\n[rationality] is right, principles of reasoning that are based on such\nrules are normative principles of reasoning, namely they are the\nprinciples we ought to reason in accordance with. (Stein 1996: 4)\n\n\nAccording to some, rather than suggesting that humans are irrational,\nthe relevant findings (among many other considerations) give us good\noccasion to ask whether it is reasonable to see \u201cthe Standard\nPicture\u201d as providing the relevant normative standard.\nDiscussion of the ensuing debate would take us too far afield here\n(but see note 27). For present purposes, it suffices to note that it\nshares many features with the debate within and about NE. Empirical\nresults and considerations of psychological feasibility play a large\nrole within the rationality debate, and many of the facts and factors\nappealed to by friends of NE in their critique of TE (see\n Sections 1.2\n and\n 3.2\n above, e.g.) reappear here either as criticisms of SP, or as\nproffered constraints upon an adequate conception of rationality.\nFinally, as with debates within and about NE generally, discussions of\nrationality involve appeals to both normative and psychological\nconsiderations, with many of the most contested issues having to do\nwith how best to balance their sometimes-competing claims.\n",
