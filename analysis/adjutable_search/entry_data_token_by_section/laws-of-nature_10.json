The\ncontrast is supposed to be between universal generalizations of the\nsort discussed above (e.g., that all inertial bodies have no\nacceleration) and seemingly less formal generalizations like that,\nother things being equal, smoking causes cancer. The idea is that the\nformer would be contradicted by a single counterinstance, say, one\naccelerating inertial body, though the latter is consistent with there\nbeing one smoker who never gets cancer. Though in theory this\ndistinction is easy enough to understand, in practice it is often\ndifficult to distinguish strict from ceteris-paribus\ngeneralizations. This is because many philosophers think that many\nutterances which include no explicit ceteris-paribus clause\nimplicitly do include such a clause.\n\nFor the most part, philosophers have thought that if scientists have\ndiscovered any exceptionless regularities that are laws, they have\ndone so at the level of fundamental physics. A few philosophers,\nhowever, are doubtful that there are exceptionless regularities at\neven this basic level. For example, Cartwright has argued that\nthe descriptive and the explanatory aspects of laws conflict.\n\u201cRendered as descriptions of fact, they are false; amended to be\ntrue, they lose their fundamental explanatory force\u201d (1980, 75).\nConsider Newton\u2019s gravitational principle, F =\nGmm\u2032/r2.\nProperly understood, according to Cartwright, it says that for any two\nbodies the force between them is\nGmm\u2032/r2. But\nif that is what the law says then the law is not an exceptionless\nregularity. This is because the force between two bodies is influenced\nby other properties than just their mass and the distance between\nthem, by properties like the charge of the two bodies as described by\nCoulomb\u2019s law. The statement of the gravitational principle can\nbe amended to make it true, but that, according to Cartwright, at\nleast on certain standard ways of doing so, would strip it of its\nexplanatory power. For example, if the principle is taken to hold only\nthat F = Gmm\u2032/r2\nif there are no forces other than\ngravitational forces at work, then though it would be true it would\nnot apply except in idealized circumstances. Lange (1993) uses a\ndifferent example to make a similar point. Consider a standard\nexpression of the law of thermal expansion: \u2018Whenever the\ntemperature of a metal bar of length L0\nchanges by T, the length of the bar\nchanges by L = kL0T,\u2019\nwhere k is a\nconstant, the thermal expansion coefficient of the metal. If this\nexpression were used to express the strict generalization\nstraightforwardly suggested by its grammar, then such an utterance\nwould be false since the length of a bar does not change in the way\ndescribed in cases where someone is hammering on the ends of the bar.\nIt looks like the law will require provisos, but so many that the only\napparent way of taking into consideration all the required provisos\nwould be with something like a ceteris-paribus clause. Then\nthe concern becomes that the statement would be empty. Because of the\ndifficulty of stating plausible truth conditions for ceteris-paribus\nsentences, it is feared that \u2018Other things being equal,\nL = kL0T\u2019\ncould only mean\n\u2018L = kL0T\nprovided that L =\nkL0T.\u2019\n\nEven those who agree with the arguments of Cartwright and Lange\nsometimes disagree about what ultimately the arguments say about laws.\nCartwright believes that the true laws are not exceptionless\nregularities, but instead are statements that describe causal powers.\nSo construed, they turn out to be both true and explanatory. Lange\nends up holding that there are propositions properly adopted as laws,\nthough in doing so one need not also believe any exceptionless\nregularity; there need not be one. Giere (1999) can usefully be\ninterpreted as agreeing with Cartwright\u2019s basic arguments but\ninsisting that law-statements don\u2019t have implicit provisos or\nimplicit ceteris-paribus clauses. So, he concludes that there\nare no laws.\n\nEarman and Roberts hold that there are exceptionless and lawful\nregularities. More precisely, they argue that scientists doing\nfundamental physics do attempt to state strict generalizations that\nare such that they would be strict laws if they were true:\n\nOur claim is only that \u2026 typical theories from fundamental\nphysics are such that if they were true, there would be\nprecise proviso free laws. For example, Einstein\u2019s gravitational\nfield law asserts \u2014 without equivocation, qualification,\nproviso, ceteris paribus clause \u2014 that the Ricci\ncurvature tensor of spacetime is proportional to the total\nstress-energy tensor for matter-energy; the relativistic version of\nMaxwell\u2019s laws of electromagnetism for charge-free flat\nspacetime asserts \u2014 without qualification or proviso \u2014\nthat the curl of the E field is proportional to the\npartial time derivative, etc. (1999, 446).\n\n\nAbout Cartwright\u2019s gravitational example, they think (473, fn.\n14) that a plausible understanding of the gravitational principle is\nas describing only the gravitational force between the two\nmassive bodies. (Cartwright argues that there is no such component\nforce and so thinks such an interpretation would be false. Earman and\nRoberts disagree.) About Lange\u2019s example, they think the law\nshould be understood as having the single proviso that there be no\nexternal stresses on the metal bar (461). In any case, much more would\nneed to be said to establish that all the apparently strict\nand explanatory generalizations that have been or will be stated by\nphysicists have turned or will turn out to be false. (Earman, et\nal., 2003 includes more recent papers by both Cartwright and\nLange, and also many other papers on ceteris-paribus\nlaws.)\n",
