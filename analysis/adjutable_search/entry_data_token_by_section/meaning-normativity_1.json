    "main_text": "Interpretations of the Normativity Thesis || Varieties of Normativity\n1.2 Varieties of Normativity\n\nNormativism claims that nothing can have meaning/content unless norms\nof a certain kind are valid, or in\n force.[5]\n A second basic question thus is: what kind of norm would that be?\n\nThe most basic distinction relevant here is that between norms for\naction and norms of\n being.[6]\n Norms of being are often associated with evaluations; they tell us\nthat a certain state of affairs ought to obtain, i.e., is\nvaluable or good in a certain sense. Norms for action, on the other\nhand, tell us what to do. Both can either be prima\nfacie (or pro tanto) or categorical (cf. Ross 1930\n[1987]). Prima facie norms or evaluations can be overridden\nor outweighed (by other norms, obligations or evaluations),\ncategorical ones cannot. Both norms of action and values can also be\ncategorized by provenance: There are the norms of morals, etiquette,\nand prudence, the laws of the state, and the rules of games.\nAnalogously, values of different kinds can be distinguished. The\nnormativity of meaning/content typically is construed in terms of\nnorms for action.\n\nConcerning norms for action, we can distinguish between instrumental\nand non-instrumental norms. An instrumental norm tells us what to do\nin order to reach a certain goal, where the relation between means and\nend is contingent. Its normative force for an agent is contingent upon\nthe agent\u2019s goals. An example would be:\n\n(D)\nIf you want to make the hut habitable, you ought to heat it (von\nWright 1963: 10).\n\n\nAmong non-instrumental norms we can further distinguish between\nprescriptions and other norms for action, and thirdly between\nconstitutive and non-constitutive rules or\n norms.[7]\n\nPrescriptions can typically be formulated in deontic vocabulary, i.e.,\nin terms of what is prescribed, forbidden, or\n allowed/proscribed.[8]\n They can be conditional (CP) or unconditional (P). For conditional\nprescriptions, we can distinguish between those where the deontic\noperator (\u201cought\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d) takes wide scope\nover the conditional \\((\\CP_w )\\), and those where it takes narrow\nscope \\((\\CP_n )\\):\n\n(P)\nYou ought to do \\(X\\).\n\\((\\CP_w )\\)\nYou ought to (if \\(C\\) then do \\(X)\\).\n\\((\\CP_n )\\)\nIf \\(C\\), you ought to (do \\(X)\\).\n\n\nThe main difference between \\((\\CP_w )\\) and \\((\\CP_n )\\) is that on\n\\((\\CP_w )\\), there are two ways of discharging your obligation: by\ndoing \\(X\\) or by making it the case that \\(C\\) is not fulfilled. Not\nso on \\((\\CP_n )\\): once \\(C\\) is fulfilled, you must do \\(X\\). Only\non \\((\\CP_n )\\), that is, can the consequent be detached.\n\nFor prescriptions, two principles are usually taken to hold\nintuitively. These are the principle that ought implies\ncan, and the principle that ought implies the\npossibility of violation. Both principles are somewhat controversial,\nbut have initial plausibility as there would not seem to be much point\nto prescribing, forbidding, or allowing impossible things (cf.\nWilliamson 2000: 241).\n\nMany norms or rules concern types of action or activities that exist\nindependently of them. Constitutive rules or norms, by contrast, in\nsome sense \u201ccreate\u201d the very actions or activities they\nregulate. Rules of games are prime examples. According to Midgley\n(1959) and Searle (1969; 33ff), constitutive rules typically, and\nnaturally, can be put into the following form:\n\n(CR)\nIn \\(C\\), doing \\(X\\) counts as doing \\(Y\\).\n\n\nAccording to this suggestion, constitutive rules tell us that, in a\ncertain context \\(C\\) (for instance, a game of soccer), an action of\ntype \\(Y\\) (for instance, scoring a goal) can be performed by means of\nperforming an action of a different type \\(X\\) (for instance, kicking\nthe ball into a netted box). According to Searle, constitutive rules\nplay an important role in social ontology: \u201cinstitutional\nfacts\u201d (facts concerning social statuses such as being money,\nhaving meaning, or being an assertion) can be explained in terms of\ncollective acceptance of rules of this kind (cf. Searle 1995, 2010).\nOther accounts of social institutions in terms of rules constitutive\nof social statuses have stressed the normative consequences of having\na such a status (cf., e.g., Ransdell 1971, Hindriks 2009).\n\nDespite its predominance in the literature, the characterization of\nconstitutive rules by means of forms like\n (CR)\n is too narrow, however. There are prescriptions that are constitutive\nof certain games\u2014for instance, that spearing is forbidden is\nconstitutive of ice-hockey\u2014and these do not naturally fit the\n(CR) form. It is better to characterize a set of rules or norms as\nconstitutive of a certain type of action/activity \\(A\\) iff \\(A\\)\ncannot be performed, or engaged in, unless these norms are in force\n(cf. Pagin 1987; Gl\u00fcer & Pagin 1998; Kaluzi\u0144ski 2018;\nReiland 2020; Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n 2022).[9]\n\nWith these distinctions in place, we can proceed to mapping the\ndebates concerning the normativity of meaning/content. Given that the\nnorms in question are supposed to be essential to meaning/content, we\ncan already now see that what we are looking for are non-instrumental\nnorms of purely semantic provenance. MD/CD norms will moreover have to\nbe of the constitutive kind.\n",
