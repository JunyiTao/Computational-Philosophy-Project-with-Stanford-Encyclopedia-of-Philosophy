Newton made this notion precise in Corollary VI to the laws of\nmotion: \n\nIf bodies are moved in any way among themselves, and are urged by\nequal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all continue\nto move among themselves in the same way as if they were not acted on\nby those forces. (1687b, p. 20.)\n\n\nAs Corollaries IV and V implied, for a given system of interacting\nbodies, their center of gravity is unmoved by the actions of the\nbodies among themselves, and will remain at rest or in uniform motion\nas long as the bodies are not disturbed by any external forces. This,\nas we noted, was as close as Newton could come to the notion of an\ninertial frame. Corollary VI shows that, in very special ideal\ncircumstances\u2014accelerative forces that act equally on all bodies\nwithin a system, and accelerate them all in parallel\ndirections\u2014an accelerating system of bodies will behave,\ninternally, as if there were no external forces acting on it at all.\nYet Newton\u2019s discovery was not limited to the point made\nexplicitly in Corollary VI. Rather, it was threefold. The second point\nwas that there was in fact a force acting equally and in parallel\nlines, at least to a high approximation, on important systems of\ncelestial bodies. The system of Jupiter and its satellites, for\nexample, is obviously accelerating, as its center of gravity completes\nan approximately elliptical orbit around the Sun bound by accelerative\nforces toward the Sun\u2019s center. But because the accelerations of\nall the bodies are nearly equal and parallel, their motions among\nthemselves are nearly the same as if no such forces acted, and the\nsystem may be treated as the sort of system described in Corollary V.\nEvidently the accelerations are unequal, since Jupiter and the\nsatellites are at varying distances from the sun, and they cannot be\nparallel since they are all directed at the center of the sun. But\nthese differences of distance and direction are so small, in\ncomparison with the distance of the entire system from the sun, that\nthey may be neglected. And the same applies to the centripetal\nacceleration of Saturn\u2019s system. \n\nNewton applied this same reasoning to the entire solar system: even if\nthe entire system were accelerating toward some unknown gravitational\nsource, he could treat the solar system itself as if it were an\nisolated system. He argued, from the analysis of accelerations within\nthe system, that outside forces must be acting more or less equally\nand in parallel directions on all parts of the system.\n\nIt may be imagined that the sun and planets are impelled by some other\nforce equally and in the direction of parallel lines; but such a force\n(by Cor. VI of the Laws of Motion) would not change the situation of\nthe planets among themselves, nor would produce any sensible effect;\nbut we are concerned with the causes of sensible effects. Let us,\ntherefore, neglect every such force as precarious, and of no bearing\non the phenomena of the heavens\u2026. (1687a, article 13.)\n\n\nNewton raised this point in order to show that the possibility of such\na force acting on the whole solar system would not affect his\ncalculations of the forces acting within the system. In the\ncalculation relevant to this passage, Newton was using Corollary VI to\ndefend the inference that the force responsible for Jupiter\u2019s\norbit is directed to the Sun rather than to the Earth: neglecting any\nsuch imaginary force, \u201cthen all the remaining force by\nwhich\u2026 Jupiter is urged will tend (by prop. 3, corol. 1) toward\nthe center of the sun\u201d (ibid). This calculation formed an\nimportant step in the argument for a heliocentric system. Such a use\nof Corollary VI parallels, therefore, his use of Corollary V (and its\nearlier form, \u201cLaw 3\u201d) to show that the \u201cframe of\nthe system of the world\u201d could be determined without regard to\nthe system\u2019s uniform motion in absolute space. \n\nIndeed, the analogy between the two kinds of case helps to explain\nNewton\u2019s changing the relativity principle from a law to a\nCorollary, for this coincides historically with his first use of\nCorollary VI. The two Corollaries identify two classes of frames of\nreference that may be treated as equivalent, because they involve,\nrespectively, theoretically and practically indistinguishable states\nof motion. The frames corresponding to Corollary VI may be called\n\u201cquasi-inertial,\u201d because \u201capproximately\ninertial\u201d might be misleading: a closed orbit around the\nSun\u2014like that of Jupiter\u2019s system\u2014is not a good\napproximation to an inertial motion, and the system can hardly be\nconsidered isolated. But over sufficiently limited segments of its\norbit, its motion is sufficiently close to being inertial.\nMoreover\u2014and most important\u2014the accelerative forces toward\nthe sun are close enough to being equal and parallel that the forces\nacting within the system can be effectively isolated from the forces\nfrom without. Hence, while \u201cquasi-inertial\u201d is a useful\nterm for the reference-frame corresponding to such a group of bodies,\na useful description for the group itself is George Smith\u2019s\n\u201cquasi-insular system\u201d (Smith 2019). A system of masses\nbound in orbit around a larger mass is by no means isolated, yet in\nthe right conditions it may be treated as if it were. The modern term,\n\u201clocal inertial frame,\u201d is not inappropriate (cf. Schutz\n1990, p. 124). But it typically designates the local coordinate frame\nof a given inertial observer, rather than the sort of \u201cwhole\nspace\u201d that Newton had in mind, as encompassing a celestial\nsystem as large as that of Jupiter, or the solar system as a whole.\nMoreover, it is typically used in a context in which a global inertial\nframe, with respect to which any such Newtonian system has a definite\nacceleration, would not be assumed to exist. \n\nThis last point leads to the third point of Newton\u2019s discovery:\nthat the \u201cquasi-inertial\u201d system is part of a mathematical\nframework for approximative reasoning, to determine the precise degree\nof isolation that a group of interacting bodies may be said to\npossess. Proposition III of the Principia established\nNewton\u2019s method for treating a body orbiting a second body which\nis, itself, subject to a centripetal force:\n\nProposition III, Theorem III: Every body, that, by a radius drawn to\nthe centre of another body, in any way moved, describes areas about\nthat centre proportional to the times, is urged by a force compounded\nout of the centripetal force tending to that other body, and of all\nthe accelerative force by which that other body is impelled.(1687b, p.\n39).\n\n\nIn other words, if an orbiting body obeys Kepler\u2019s area law,\nthen any accelerative force acting on the central body is simply added\nto the centripetal force that maintains the orbiting body in its\norbit.\n\nThis principle of composition formed the mathematical basis for\nNewton\u2019s treatment of quasi-inertial frames. When a system of\nlesser bodies is, as a whole, revolving around a greater body, we have\na geometrical framework to describe how closely the motions of the\nlesser system approximate the conditions of Corollary VI:\n\nBook I, Proposition LXV, Case 2: Suppose that the accelerative\nattractions towards the greater body to be among themselves\nreciprocally as the squares of the distances; and then, by increasing\nthe distance of the great body till the differences of the straight\nlines drawn from that to the others in respect of their length, and\nthe inclinations of those lines to each other, are less than any\ngiven, then the motions of the parts of the system, will continue with\nno errors except such as are less than any given. And because, by the\nsmall distance of those parts from each other, the whole system is\nattracted as if it were only one body, it will therefore be moved by\nthis attraction as if it were one body\u2026.(1687b, p. 172.)\n\n\nThus the situation described by Corollary VI, in Newton\u2019s\nanalysis, emerges as a limiting case of an orbiting system under an\ninverse-square force. As the size of the orbit is arbitrarily\nincreased, the accelerations toward the center become\nindistinguishable from equal and parallel accelerations. Evidently,\nNewton\u2019s proposition provides, characteristically, a general\nmethod for treating a variety of possible configurations. But it\nenabled Newton to address the specific physical fact of the variation\nin the Sun\u2019s gravity, and its consequences for the superposition\nupon it of lesser gravitating systems. At the distance of Jupiter or\nSaturn, a revolving system can be a very nearly regular Keplerian\nsystem. As the distance to the Sun decreases, however, differences in\nmagnitude and direction of the accelerations become significant, and\nat the distance of the Earth-Moon system the motions become nearly\nintractable. The decisive factor is the proportion between the size of\nthe orbiting system and its distance from the center of attraction.\n\n\nThe actual existence of quasi-inertial frames, corresponding to the\nabstract cases of Proposition LXV, was a crucial part of\nNewton\u2019s argument for universal gravitation\u2014more\nprecisely, that the force holding the planets and their satellites in\ntheir respective orbits is, in fact, the same force as gravity. One\ncrucial ground for the identification was the fact that the\ninterplanetary force shares the most striking feature of terrestrial\ngravity, namely, that it imparts the same acceleration to all\nterrestrial bodies. This principle was discovered by Galileo, of\ncourse, but Newton tested it more severely, and with a greater variety\nof test bodies. He constructed pendulums of identical wooden boxes\nsuspended from strings of equal length, which he filled with different\nmaterials; he found that these differences made no difference to the\nspeed of falling over many oscillations of the pendulums. By this\nmeans he showed that Galileo\u2019s principle holds to a much higher\ndegree of accuracy than Galileo was able to show, and inferred that a\nbody\u2019s weight toward the earth is generally proportional to its\nmass. (1687b, Book III, Proposition VI). But Newton extended this\nprinciple beyond terrestrial gravity, to the accelerative forces\nacting on the planets and their satellites. Proposition IV, Corollary\nVI, from Book I, showed that an orbiting body that obeys\nKepler\u2019s third law is urged toward the center by an\ninverse-square force. Newton could then show that the centripetal\nforces acting on Jupiter\u2019s moons depend only on the\ninverse-square of the distance towards Jupiter\u2019s center: \n\nsince the satellites of Jupiter perform their revolutions in times\nthat observe the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from\nJupiter\u2019s center, their accelerative gravities towards Jupiter\nwill be inversely as the squares of their distances from\nJupiter\u2019s centre; that is, equal, at equal distances\u2026.\nAnd by the same argument, if the circumsolar planets were let fall at\nequal distances from the Sun, they would, in their descent towards the\nSun, describe equal spaces in equal times. But forces that equally\naccelerate unequal bodies must be as those bodies; that is to say, the\nweights of the planets towards the Sun must be as their quantities of\nmatter. (Ibid.)\n\n\nIn each of these cases, that is, Newton found that the centripetal\nacceleration behaves like gravitational acceleration, and so the\nbodies\u2019 forces toward their respective centers are, essentially,\ntheir weights toward those centers. Moreover, the orbits of\nJupiter\u2019s moons provided a completely novel test of\nGalileo\u2019s principle, on an extremely large scales of mass and\ndistance. For he showed that Jupiter and its moons\u2014within the\nlimits of observational accuracy\u2014undergo the same accelerations\ntoward the sun (cf. 1687b, Book I, Proposition 65; Book III,\nProposition VI). Any non-negligible difference in these accelerations\nwould produce corresponding irregularities in the satellites\u2019\norbits. \n\nThe proportionality of weight to mass was understood in its broader\nfoundational significance, as the equivalence of gravitational and\ninertial mass, through Einstein\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nequivalence\u201d (cf. Einstein 1916; see also Norton 1985). In\nEinstein\u2019s reasoning, the identity of inertia and gravitation\nhelped to undermine the special status of inertial motion, and\nsuggested the extension of the relativity principle from inertial\nframes to frames in any state of motion whatever. If an inertial\nframe, K, cannot be distinguished from another frame K\u2032 that is\nuniformly accelerated with respect to K, then K\u2032 may equally be\ntreated as a \u201cprivileged\u201d or \u201cstationary\u201d\nframe: \u201cthey have equal title as systems of reference for the\ndescription of physical phenomena\u201d (Einstein 1916, p. 114). This\ncircumstance undermines a defining characteristic of inertial frames:\nthat with respect to a given inertial frame, every other inertial\nframe is in uniform rectilinear motion. Corollary VI points the way,\nafter all, toward an extended relativity principle.\n\nThe assumption of the complete physical equivalence of the systems of\nco-ordinates, K and K\u2032, we call the \u201cprinciple of\nequivalence;\u201d this principle is evidently intimately connected\nwith the theorem of the equality between the inert and the\ngravitational mass, and signifies an extension of the principle of\nrelativity to co-ordinate systems which are in non-uniform motion\nrelatively to each other. In fact, through this conception we arrive\nat the unity of the nature of inertia and gravitation. (Einstein\n1922).\n\n\nThis reasoning, in turn, suggested the connection between the\ngravitational field and the curvature of space-time. (See Einstein\n1916; see also Related Entries:\n Einstein, Albert: philosophy of science |\n \n general relativity: early philosophical interpretations of).\n \n\nEven independently of Einstein\u2019s theory, however, one might see\nin hindsight that Newton\u2019s application of Corollary VI, and his\nidentification of what we\u2019ve been calling quasi-inertial frames,\nalready undermined the idea of an inertial frame. As we saw, Newton\ncould treat a quasi-inertial system like that of Jupiter and its\nmoons, not as essentially different from the system of the Earth and\nthe Moon, but as a limiting case of such a system: as the whole system\nbecomes sufficiently far from the central body, the differences among\nthe accelerations of its parts toward their common center become\nnegligibly small. In other words, Newton could treat such systems, and\nthe mathematical description of the differences among them, as\nrevealing the structure and workings of the sun\u2019s gravity,\nrather than as questioning the fundamental distinction between uniform\nand accelerated motion. In that sense, he was not proposing the\n\u201ccomplete physical equivalence\u201d of uniformly accelerating\nsystems with uniformly moving systems (inertial frames). But even\nNewton recognized, as we also saw, that the solar system as a whole\nmight have an unknown and practically unknowable acceleration. In\neffect, he explained why his analysis of accelerations of the bodies\nin the system, among themselves, required no knowledge of any absolute\naccelerations. In the 19th century, Maxwell, without questioning the\nunderlying framework of absolute space and time, pointed out that\nCorollary VI implied a kind of relativity of acceleration (1878, pp.\n51\u201352). Viewing the foregoing in hindsight, more recent\nliterature has suggested that the physics of the Principia did not\nreally require the notion of inertial frame at all, and therefore that\na weaker geometry than Newtonian spacetime would be a sufficient\nbackground structure for Newton\u2019s dynamical reasoning (cf.\nSaunders, 2013). It is further suggested, following Cartan (1923,\n1924), that the space-time structure and the gravitational field be\nunified in a curved space-time (cf. section 9, below), as a Newtonian\nversion of general relativity (cf. Malament 2012, chapter 4; see also\nKnox, 2014 and Weatherall 2018). The relevant conceptual resources and\nmathematical techniques for such approaches, evidently, developed only\nin the aftermath of general relativity. We return to this theme in\n2.5.\n",
