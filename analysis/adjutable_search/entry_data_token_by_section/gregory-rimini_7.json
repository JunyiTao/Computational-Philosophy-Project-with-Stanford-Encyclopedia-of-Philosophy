    "main_text": "Economic Thought\n6. Economic Thought\n\nAlthough his commentary on books I and II of the Sentences is\nby far Gregory\u2019s largest and most important work, historians of\nmedieval philosophy have recently devoted some attention to his sole\nwriting on economic thought, which was printed in Reggio Emilia in\n1508 as the Tractatus de imprestantiis Venetorum et de usura\nand reprinted in Rimini itself over a century later in 1622 (Rimini\n1508; Lambertini 2003, 2009; Kirshner 2015). The only known manuscript\nwitness is in a codex containing various political and economic\ntracts: Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr. J. X.\n51, ff. 201r-212r. The manuscript carries a different redaction of the\ntext, but it can be used to correct the printed editions and should\nform the basis of a future critical edition. The title and explicit in\nthe manuscript further identify the work as a quaestio\ndisputata on the forced loans of the Venetian commune according\nto the determination of Gregory of Rimini, Master of Theology and\nprior general of the Augustinians. Terminology in the text itself\nconfirms that rather than a purely written work, the piece derives\nfrom an oral disputation, although the internal structure and the\nexistence of two redactions indicate that it was much revised\nafterwards. Since we know that theologians\u2019 administrative\nresponsibilities did not preclude their participation in such events\nas quodlibetal disputations, it is possible that the debate took place\nwhile Gregory was his order\u2019s prior general as the incipit says,\ni.e., in the latter half of 1357 or in 1358, which would make it his\nlast word on intellectual matters.\n\nGregory was actually asked two questions, and he combined them in his\ndetermination. The first was whether it was licit for a creditor to\nreceive interest on a forced loan. Various Italian communes resorted\nto forced loans from their citizens to raise money, paying in return\nan annual sum but never the principal. In the case of Venice, the\nforced lender received 5%. The second question asked whether it was\nlicit for someone else to acquire the title to the loan from the\nforced lender, for a sum smaller than the initial loan, and continue\nto receive the annual sum from the commune. For example, the\ngovernment could demand $100 from a citizen, promising to pay $5 each\nyear. Another citizen could then pay $25 to the first citizen and\nacquire the right to receive the annual payment of $5.\n\nThe issue was a concrete one in the fourteenth century, and several\nscholars were asked similar or even identical questions, which allows\nus to place Gregory\u2019s determination in a historical context. One\nwriter gave a liberal response to the first question, that the mere\nfact that the loan was forced made the creditor\u2019s receiving of\n5% interest licit, while the same author considered the second\ntransaction an acceptable contract of sale and not a purchase of a\nloan. A more conservative author, on the other hand, viewed the 5% as\nusury, unless it constituted a spontaneous gift from the commune to\nthe citizen and as long as the citizen did not intend to profit. In\nthis case, the gift could not be purchased licitly by another,\nnaturally, for the unforced buyer would surely be a usurer.\n\nGregory\u2019s treatment has been singled out as historically\nsignificant. Gregory\u2019s procedure reflects his earlier\nSentences commentary in his careful structure. Following\nopening arguments, Gregory divides the determination into four\narticles, first defining his terms, second discussing the sinfulness\nof usury, third answering the questions, and fourth responding to the\nopening arguments. Although Gregory is a Master of Theology, he\nanswers the question as a philosopher, employing rational arguments.\nFor Gregory, usury is wrong pure and simple, since it breaks the rule\nof equality in exchanges. One might view this as a conservative\napproach, but Gregory\u2019s general position may entail a liberal\nimplementation of his theory, since the determining factor lies in\none\u2019s conscience, in one\u2019s intent: \u201cUsury is profit\nintended from a loan.\u201d Gregory\u2019s emphasis on the\nrole of intent and conscience here is unusual. In the case at hand,\nVenice can legitimately pay the 5% only if the commune\u2019s motives\nare honorable, either because it believes it is paying for damages or\nreturning a kindness, although Gregory excludes from the rubric\n\u201cdamages\u201d the opportunity costs from the resulting\nnon-acquisition of possible profits, thus further demonstrating his\nawareness of business and banking practices. Since Venice pays all\nforced creditors such a regular annual fee, however, it does not seem\nto Gregory to be paid for either of those reasons. Still, he leaves it\nup to the conscience.\n\nThis applies to the second question as well. The creditor who has\ngiven the loan in good conscience and without hope of profit has not\ncommitted usury, so he has \u201ca right over the commune\u201d that\nhe can sell licitly. Moreover, the buyer can purchase this licitly, as\nlong as he does not intend to profit thereby. But if this is not the\ncase, if profit is intended, the sin of usury is committed, more\nseriously than in the first case, since no force is involved.\n\nGregory\u2019s determination would allow Venice and its creditors to\nproceed with their practice of forced loans and creditors\u2019\ntransfers of annual payments without outward restrictions from the\nChurch. Perhaps he was being practical given the complexities of the\nsituation. By stressing the role of intent and conscience, he freed\ninvestors to pursue their projects. But without drawing clear lines\nseparating the legitimate from the illegitimate, he burdened them to\nconsider their motives in each and every transaction, warning that\nwhether they are usurers in truth will be determined before God at the\njudgment of souls.\n",
