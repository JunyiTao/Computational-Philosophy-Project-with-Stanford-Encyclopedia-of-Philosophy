    "preamble": "\n\nIn the discipline of international relations there are contending\ngeneral theories or theoretical perspectives. Realism, also known as\npolitical realism, is a view of international politics that stresses\nits competitive and conflictual side. It is usually contrasted with\nidealism or liberalism, which tends to emphasize cooperation. Realists\nconsider the principal actors in the international arena to be states,\nwhich are concerned with their own security, act in pursuit of their\nown national interests, and struggle for power. The negative side of\nthe realists\u2019 emphasis on power and self-interest is often their\nskepticism regarding the relevance of ethical norms to relations among\nstates. National politics is the realm of authority and law, whereas\ninternational politics, they sometimes claim, is a sphere without\njustice, characterized by active or potential conflict among states,\nwhere ethical standards do not apply.\n\nNot all realists, however, deny the presence of prescriptive ethics in\ninternational relations. The distinction should be drawn between\nclassical realism\u2014represented by such twentieth-century\ntheorists as Reinhold Niebuhr and Hans Morgenthau\u2014and radical or\nextreme realism. While classical realism emphasizes the concept of\nnational interest, it is not the Machiavellian doctrine \u201cthat\nanything is justified by reason of state\u201d (Bull 1995, 189). Nor\ndoes it involve the glorification of war or conflict. The classical\nrealists do not reject the possibility of moral judgment in\ninternational politics. Rather, they are critical of\nmoralism\u2014abstract moral discourse that does not take into\naccount political realities. They assign ethical value to successful\npolitical action based on prudence: the ability to judge the rightness\nof a given action from among possible alternatives on the basis of its\nlikely political consequences.\n\nRealism encompasses a variety of approaches and claims a long\ntheoretical tradition. Among its founding fathers, Thucydides,\nMachiavelli and Hobbes are the names most usually mentioned.\nTwentieth-century classical realism has today been largely replaced by\nneorealism, which is an attempt to construct a more scientific\napproach to the study of international relations. Both classical\nrealism and neorealism have been subjected to criticism from IR\ntheorists representing liberal, critical, and post-modern\nperspectives. The growing tensions among superpowers have revived the\nrealist-idealist debate in the twenty-first century and have led to a\nresurgence of interest in the realist tradition.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Roots of the Realist Tradition\n1.1 Thucydides and the Importance of Power\n\nLike other classical political theorists, Thucydides (c. 460\u2013c.\n400 B.C.E.) saw politics as involving moral questions. Most\nimportantly, he asks whether relations among states to which power is\ncrucial can also be guided by the norms of justice. His History of\nthe Peloponnesian War is in fact neither a work of political\nphilosophy nor a sustained theory of international relations. Much of\nthis work, which presents a partial account of the armed conflict\nbetween Athens and Sparta that took place from 431 to 404 B.C.E.,\nconsists of paired speeches by personages who argue opposing sides of\nan issue. Nevertheless, if the History is described as the\nonly acknowledged classical text in international relations, and if it\ninspires theorists from Hobbes to contemporary international relations\nscholars, this is because it is more than a chronicle of events, and a\ntheoretical position can be extrapolated from it. Realism is expressed\nin the very first speech of the Athenians recorded in the\nHistory\u2014a speech given at the debate that took place in\nSparta just before the war. Moreover, a realist perspective is implied\nin the way Thucydides explains the cause of the Peloponnesian War, and\nalso in the famous \u201cMelian Dialogue,\u201d in the statements\nmade by the Athenian envoys.\n1.1.1 General Features of Realism in International Relations\n\nInternational relations realists emphasize the constraints imposed on\npolitics by the nature of human beings, whom they consider egoistic,\nand by the absence of international government. Together these factors\ncontribute to a conflict-based paradigm of international relations, in\nwhich the key actors are states, in which power and security become\nthe main issues, and in which there is little place for ethical norms.\nThe set of premises concerning state actors, egoism, anarchy, power,\nsecurity, and ethics that define the realist tradition are all present\nin Thucydides.\n\n(1) Human nature is a starting point for classical political realism.\nRealists view human beings as inherently egoistic and self-interested\nto the extent that self-interest overcomes moral principles. At the\ndebate in Sparta, described in Book I of Thucydides\u2019\nHistory, the Athenians affirm the priority of self-interest\nover morality. They say that considerations of right and wrong have\n\u201cnever turned people aside from the opportunities of\naggrandizement offered by superior strength\u201d (chap. 1 par.\n76).\n\n(2) Realists, and especially today\u2019s neorealists, consider the\nabsence of government, literally anarchy, to be the primary\ndeterminant of international political outcomes. The lack of a common\nrule-making and enforcing authority means, they argue, that the\ninternational arena is essentially a self-help system. Each state is\nresponsible for its own survival and is free to define its own\ninterests and to pursue power. Anarchy thus leads to a situation in\nwhich power has the overriding role in shaping interstate relations.\nIn the words of the Athenian envoys at Melos, without any common\nauthority that can enforce order, \u201cthe independent states\nsurvive [only] when they are powerful\u201d (5.97).\n\n(3) Insofar as realists envision the world of states as anarchic, they\nlikewise view security as a central issue. To attain security, states\ntry to increase their power and engage in power-balancing for the\npurpose of deterring potential aggressors. Wars are fought to prevent\ncompeting nations from becoming militarily stronger. Thucydides, while\ndistinguishing between the immediate and underlying causes of the\nPeloponnesian War, does not see its real cause in any of the\nparticular events that immediately preceded its outbreak. He instead\nlocates the cause of the war in the changing distribution of power\nbetween the two blocs of Greek city-states: the Delian League, under\nthe leadership of Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, under the\nleadership of Sparta. According to him, the growth of Athenian power\nmade the Spartans afraid for their security, and thus propelled them\ninto war (1.23). Referring to this situation, Graham Allison has\npopularized the expression \u201cThucydides trap\u201d to describe\nthe danger which occurs when a rising power rivals an established one\n(2017). \n\n(4) Realists are generally skeptical about the relevance of ethics to\ninternational politics. This can lead them to claim that there is no\nplace for morality in the prescriptive sense in international\nrelations, or that there is a tension between demands of morality and\nrequirements of successful political action, or that states have their\nown morality that is different from customary morality, or that\nmorality, if employed at all, is merely used instrumentally to justify\nstates\u2019 conduct. A clear case of the rejection of ethical norms\nin relations among states can be found in the \u201cMelian\nDialogue\u201d (5.85\u2013113). This dialogue relates to the events\nof 416 B.C.E., when Athens invaded the island of Melos. The Athenian\nenvoys presented the Melians with a choice, destruction or surrender,\nand from the outset asked them not to appeal to justice, but to think\nonly about their survival. In the envoys\u2019 words, \u201cWe both\nknow that the decisions about justice are made in human discussions\nonly when both sides are under equal compulsion, but when one side is\nstronger, it gets as much as it can, and the weak must accept\nthat\u201d (5.89). To be \u201cunder equal compulsion\u201d means\nto be under the force of law, and thus to be subjected to a common\nlawgiving authority (Korab-Karpowicz 2006, 234). Since such an\nauthority above states does not exist, the Athenians argue that in\nthis lawless condition of international anarchy, the only right is the\nright of the stronger to dominate the weaker. They explicitly equate\nright with might, and exclude considerations of justice from foreign\naffairs.\n1.1.2 The \u201cMelian Dialogue\u201d\u2014The First Realist-Idealist Debate\n\nWe can thus find strong support for a realist perspective in the\nstatements of the Athenians. The question remains, however, to what\nextent their realism coincides with Thucydides\u2019 own viewpoint.\nAlthough substantial passages of the \u201cMelian Dialogue,\u201d as\nwell as other parts of the History support a realistic\nreading, Thucydides\u2019 position cannot be deduced from such\nselected fragments, but rather must be assessed on the basis of the\nwider context of his book. In fact, even the \u201cMelian\nDialogue\u201d itself provides us with a number of contending\nviews.\n\nPolitical realism is usually contrasted by IR scholars with idealism\nor liberalism, a theoretical perspective that emphasizes international\nnorms, interdependence among states, and international cooperation.\nThe \u201cMelian Dialogue,\u201d which is one of the most frequently\ncommented-upon parts of Thucydides\u2019 History, presents\nthe classic debate between the idealist and realist views: Can\ninternational politics be based on a moral order derived from the\nprinciples of justice, or will it forever remain the arena of\nconflicting national interests and power?\n\nFor the Melians, who employ idealistic arguments, the choice is\nbetween war and subjection (5.86). They are courageous and love their\ncountry. They do not wish to lose their freedom, and in spite of the\nfact that they are militarily weaker than the Athenians, they are\nprepared to defend themselves (5.100; 5.112). They base their\narguments on an appeal to justice, which they associate with fairness,\nand regard the Athenians as unjust (5.90; 5.104). They are pious,\nbelieving that gods will support their just cause and compensate for\ntheir weakness, and trust in alliances, thinking that their allies,\nthe Spartans, who are also related to them, will help them (5.104;\n5.112). Hence, one can identify in the speech of the Melians elements\nof the idealistic or liberal world view: the belief that nations have\nthe right to exercise political independence, that they have mutual\nobligations to one another and will carry out such obligations, and\nthat a war of aggression is unjust. What the Melians nevertheless lack\nare resources and foresight. In their decision to defend themselves,\nthey are guided more by their hopes than by the evidence at hand or by\nprudent calculations.\n\nThe Athenian argument is based on key realist concepts such as\nsecurity and power, and is informed not by what the world should be,\nbut by what it is. The Athenians disregard any moral talk and urge the\nMelians to look at the facts\u2014that is, to recognize their\nmilitary inferiority, to consider the potential consequences of their\ndecision, and to think about their own survival (5.87; 5.101). There\nappears to be a powerful realist logic behind the Athenian arguments.\nTheir position, based on security concerns and self-interest,\nseemingly involves reliance on rationality, intelligence, and\nforesight. However, upon close examination, their logic proves to be\nseriously flawed. Melos, a relatively weak state, does not pose any\nreal security threat to them. The eventual destruction of Melos does\nnot change the course of the Peloponnesian War, which Athens will lose\na few years later.\n\nIn the History, Thucydides shows that power, if it is\nunrestrained by moderation and a sense of justice, brings about the\nuncontrolled desire for more power. There are no logical limits to the\nsize of an empire. Drunk with the prospect of glory and gain, after\nconquering Melos, the Athenians engage in a war against Sicily. They\npay no attention to the Melian argument that considerations of justice\nare useful to all in the longer run (5.90). And, as the Athenians\noverestimate their strength and in the end lose the war, their\nself-interested logic proves to be very shortsighted indeed.\n\nIt is utopian to ignore the reality of power in international\nrelations, but it is equally blind to rely on power alone. Thucydides\nappears to support neither the naive idealism of the Melians nor the\ncynicism of their Athenian opponents. He teaches us to be on guard\n\u201cagainst na\u00efve-dreaming on international politics,\u201d\non the one hand, and \u201cagainst the other pernicious extreme:\nunrestrained cynicism,\u201d on the other (Donnelly 2000, 193). If he\ncan be regarded as a political realist, his realism nonetheless\nprefigures neither realpolitik, in which prescriptive ethics\nis rejected, nor today\u2019s scientific neorealism, in which moral\nquestions are largely ignored. Thucydides\u2019 realism, neither\nimmoral nor amoral, can rather be compared to that of Hans Morgenthau,\nRaymond Aron, and other twentieth-century classical realists, who,\nalthough sensible to the demands of national interest, would not deny\nthat political actors on the international scene are subject to moral\njudgment. \n1.2 Machiavelli\u2019s Critique of the Moral Tradition\n\nIdealism in international relations, like realism, can lay claim to a\nlong tradition. Unsatisfied with the world as they have found it,\nidealists have always tried to answer the question of \u201cwhat\nought to be\u201d in politics. Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero were all\npolitical idealists who believed that there were some universal moral\nvalues on which political life could be based. Building on the work of\nhis predecessors, Cicero developed the idea of a natural moral law\nthat was applicable to both domestic and international politics. His\nideas concerning righteousness in war were carried further in the\nwritings of the Christian thinkers St. Augustine and St. Thomas\nAquinas. In the late fifteenth century, when Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli was born, the idea that politics, including the relations\namong states, should be virtuous, and that the methods of warfare\nshould remain subordinated to ethical standards, still predominated in\npolitical literature.\n\nMachiavelli (1469\u20131527) challenged this well-established moral\ntradition, thus positioning himself as a political innovator. The\nnovelty of his approach lies in his critique of classical Western\npolitical thought as unrealistic, aiming too high, and in his\nseparation of politics from ethics. He thereby lays the foundations\nfor modern politics focussed on self-interest. In chapter XV of\nThe Prince, Machiavelli announces that in departing from the\nteachings of earlier thinkers, he seeks \u201cthe effectual truth of\nthe matter rather than the imagined one.\u201d The \u201ceffectual\ntruth\u201d is for him the only truth worth seeking. It represents\nthe sum of the practical conditions that he believes are required to\nmake both the individual and the country prosperous and strong.\nMachiavelli replaces the ancient virtue (a moral quality of\nthe individual, such as justice or self-restraint) with\nvirt\u00f9, ability or vigor. As a prophet of\nvirt\u00f9, he promises to lead both nations and\nindividuals to earthly glory and power.\n\nMachiavellianism is a radical type of political realism that\nis applied to both domestic and international affairs. It is sometimes\ncalled realpolitik, and is a doctrine which denies the\nrelevance of ethics in politics, and claims that all means (moral and\nimmoral) are justified to achieve certain political ends. Although\nMachiavelli never uses the phrase ragione di stato or its\nFrench equivalent, raison d\u2019\u00e9tat, what\nultimately counts for him is precisely that: whatever is good for the\nstate, rather than ethical scruples or norms\n\nMachiavelli justified immoral actions in politics, but never refused\nto admit that they are evil. He operated within the single framework\nof traditional morality. It became a specific task of his\nnineteenth-century followers to develop the doctrine of a double\nethics: one public and one private, to push Machiavellian realism to\neven further extremes, and to apply it to international relations. By\nasserting that \u201cthe state has no higher duty than of maintaining\nitself,\u201d Hegel gave an ethical sanction to the state\u2019s\npromotion of its own interest and advantage against other states\n(Meinecke 357). Thus he overturned the traditional beliefs about\nmorality. The good of the state was perversely interpreted by him as\nthe highest moral value, with the extension of national power regarded\nas a nation\u2019s right and duty. Then, referring to Machiavelli,\nHeinrich von Treitschke declared that the state was power, precisely\nin order to assert itself as against other equally independent powers,\nand that the supreme moral duty of the state was to foster this power.\nHe considered international agreements to be binding only insofar as\nit was expedient for the state. The idea of an autonomous ethics of\nstate behavior and the concept of realpolitik were thus\nintroduced. Traditional, customary ethics was denied and power\npolitics was associated with a \u201chigher\u201d type of morality.\nThese concepts, along with the belief in the superiority of Germanic\nculture, served as weapons with which German statesmen, from the\neighteenth century to the end of the Second World War, justified their\npolicies of conquest and extermination.\n\nMachiavelli is often praised for his prudential advice to leaders\n(which has caused him to be regarded as a founding master of modern\npolitical strategy) and for his defense of the republican form of\ngovernment. There are certainly many aspects of his thought that merit\nsuch praise. Nevertheless, it is also possible to see him as the\nthinker who bears foremost responsibility for the de-moralization of\nEurope. The argument of the Athenian envoys presented in\nThucydides\u2019 \u201cMelian Dialogue,\u201d that of Thrasymachus\nin Plato\u2019s Republic, or that of Carneades, to whom\nCicero refers\u2014all of these challenge the ancient and Christian\nviews of the unity of politics and ethics. However, before\nMachiavelli, this amoral or immoral mode of thinking had never\nprevailed in the mainstream of Western political thought. It was the\nforce and timeliness of his justification of resorting to evil as a\nlegitimate means of achieving political ends that persuaded so many of\nthe thinkers and political practitioners who followed him. The effects\nof Machiavellian ideas, such as the notion that the employment of all\npossible means was permissible in war, would be seen on the\nbattlefields of modern Europe, as mass citizen armies fought against\neach other to the bitter end without regard for the rules of justice.\nThe tension between expediency and morality lost its validity in the\nsphere of politics. The concept of a double ethics that created a\nfurther damage to traditional morality, was invented. The doctrine of\nraison d\u2019\u00e9tat ultimately led to the politics of\nLebensraum, two world wars, and the Holocaust.\n\nPerhaps the greatest problem with realism in international relations\nis that it has a tendency to slip into its extreme version, which\naccepts any policy that can benefit the state at the expense of other\nstates, no matter how morally problematic the policy is. Even if they\ndo not explicitly raise ethical questions, in the works of Waltz and\nof many other of today\u2019s neorealists, a double ethics, public\nand private, is presupposed, and words such realpolitik no\nlonger have the negative connotations that they had for classical\nrealists, such as Hans Morgenthau.\n1.3 Hobbes\u2019s Anarchic State of Nature\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131683) was part of an intellectual movement\nwhose goal was to free the emerging modern science from the\nconstraints of the classical and scholastic heritage. According to\nclassical political philosophy, on which the idealist perspective is\nbased, human beings can control their desires through reason and can\nwork for the benefit of others, even at the expense of their own\nbenefit. They are thus both rational and moral agents, capable of\ndistinguishing between right and wrong, and of making moral choices.\nThey are also naturally social. With great skill Hobbes attacks these\nviews. His human beings, extremely individualistic rather than moral\nor social, are subject to \u201ca perpetual and restless desire of\npower after power, that ceases only in death\u201d\n(Leviathan XI 2). They therefore inevitably struggle for\npower. In setting out such ideas, Hobbes contributes to some of the\nbasic conceptions fundamental to the realist tradition in\ninternational relations, and especially to neorealism. These include\nthe characterization of human nature as egoistic, the concept of\ninternational anarchy, and the view that politics, rooted in the\nstruggle for power, can be rationalized and studied\nscientifically.\n\nOne of the most widely known Hobbesian concepts is that of the\nanarchic state of nature, seen as entailing a state of war\u2014and\n\u201csuch a war as is of every man against every man\u201d (XII 8).\nHe derives his notion of the state of war from his views of both human\nnature and the condition in which individuals exist. Since in the\nstate of nature there is no government and everyone enjoys equal\nstatus, every individual has a right to everything; that is, there are\nno constraints on an individual\u2019s behavior. Anyone may at any\ntime use force, and all must constantly be ready to counter such force\nwith force. Hence, driven by acquisitiveness, having no moral\nrestraints, and motivated to compete for scarce goods, individuals are\napt to \u201cinvade\u201d one another for gain. Being suspicious of\none another and driven by fear, they are also likely to engage in\npreemptive actions and invade one another to ensure their own safety.\nFinally, individuals are also driven by pride and a desire for glory.\nWhether for gain, safety, or reputation, power-seeking individuals\nwill thus \u201cendeavor to destroy or subdue one another\u201d\n(XIII 3). In such uncertain conditions where everyone is a potential\naggressor, making war on others is a more advantageous strategy than\npeaceable behavior, and one needs to learn that domination over others\nis necessary for one\u2019s own continued survival.\n\nHobbes is primarily concerned with the relationship between\nindividuals and the state, and his comments about relations among\nstates are scarce. Nevertheless, what he says about the lives of\nindividuals in the state of nature can also be interpreted as a\ndescription of how states exist in relation to one another. Once\nstates are established, the individual drive for power becomes the\nbasis for the states\u2019 behavior, which often manifests itself in\ntheir efforts to dominate other states and peoples. States, \u201cfor\ntheir own security,\u201d writes Hobbes, \u201cenlarge their\ndominions upon all pretences of danger and fear of invasion or\nassistance that may be given to invaders, [and] endeavour as much as\nthey can, to subdue and weaken their neighbors\u201d (XIX 4).\nAccordingly, the quest and struggle for power lies at the core of the\nHobbesian vision of relations among states. The same would later be\ntrue of the model of international relations developed by Hans\nMorgenthau, who was deeply influenced by Hobbes and adopted the same\nview of human nature. Similarly, the neorealist Kenneth Waltz would\nfollow Hobbes\u2019 lead regarding international anarchy (the fact\nthat sovereign states are not subject to any higher common sovereign)\nas the essential element of international relations.\n\nBy subjecting themselves to a sovereign, individuals escape the war of\nall against all which Hobbes associates with the state of nature;\nhowever, this war continues to dominate relations among states. This\ndoes not mean that states are always fighting, but rather that they\nhave a disposition to fight (XIII 8). With each state deciding for\nitself whether or not to use force, war may break out at any time. The\nachievement of domestic security through the creation of a state is\nthen paralleled by a condition of inter-state insecurity. One can\nargue that if Hobbes were fully consistent, he would agree with the\nnotion that, to escape this condition, states should also enter into a\ncontract and submit themselves to a world sovereign. Although the idea\nof a world state would find support among some of today\u2019s\nrealists, this is not a position taken by Hobbes himself. He does not\npropose that a social contract among nations be implemented to bring\ninternational anarchy to an end. This is because the condition of\ninsecurity in which states are placed does not necessarily lead to\ninsecurity for their citizens. As long as an armed conflict or other\ntype of hostility between states does not actually break out,\nindividuals within a state can feel relatively secure.\n\nThe denial of the existence of universal moral principles and norms in\nthe relations among states brings Hobbes close to the Machiavellians\nand the followers of the doctrine of raison\nd\u2019\u00e9tat. His theory of international relations, which\nassumes that independent states, like independent individuals, are\nenemies by nature, asocial and selfish, and that there is no moral\nlimitation on their behavior, is a great challenge to the idealist\npolitical vision based on human sociability and to the concept of the\ninternational jurisprudence that is built on this vision. However,\nwhat separates Hobbes from Machiavelli and associates him more with\nclassical realism is his insistence on the defensive character of\nforeign policy. His political theory does not put forward the\ninvitation to do whatever may be advantageous for the state. His\napproach to international relations is prudential and pacific:\nsovereign states, like individuals, should be disposed towards peace\nwhich is commended by reason.\n\nWhat Waltz and other neorealist readers of Hobbes\u2019s works\nsometimes overlook is that he does not perceive international anarchy\nas an environment without any rules. By suggesting that certain\ndictates of reason apply even in the state of nature, he affirms that\nmore peaceful and cooperative international relations are possible.\nNeither does he deny the existence of international law. Sovereign\nstates can sign treaties with one another to provide a legal basis for\ntheir relations. At the same time, however, Hobbes seems aware that\ninternational rules will often prove ineffective in restraining the\nstruggle for power. States will interpret them to their own advantage,\nand so international law will be obeyed or ignored according to the\ninterests of the states affected. Hence, international relations will\nalways tend to be a precarious affair. This grim view of global\npolitics lies at the core of Hobbes\u2019s realism.\n2. Twentieth Century Classical Realism\n\nTwentieth-century realism was born in response to the idealist\nperspective that dominated international relations scholarship in the\naftermath of the First World War. The idealists of the 1920s and 1930s\n(also called liberal internationalists or utopians) had the goal of\nbuilding peace in order to prevent another world conflict. They saw\nthe solution to inter-state problems as being the creation of a\nrespected system of international law, backed by international\norganizations. This interwar idealism resulted in the founding of the\nLeague of Nations in 1920 and in the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928\noutlawing war and providing for the peaceful settlements of disputes.\nU.S. President Woodrow Wilson, scholars such as Norman Angell, Alfred\nZimmern, and Raymond B. Fosdick, and other prominent idealists of the\nera, gave their intellectual support to the League of Nations. Instead\nof focusing on what some might see as the inevitability of conflict\nbetween states and peoples, they chose to emphasize the common\ninterests that could unite humanity, and attempted to appeal to\nrationality and morality. For them, war did not originate in an\negoistic human nature, but rather in imperfect social conditions and\npolitical arrangements, which could be improved. Yet their ideas were\nalready being criticized in the early 1930s by Reinhold Niebuhr and\nwithin a few years by E. H. Carr. The League of Nations, which the\nUnited States never joined, and from which Japan and Germany withdrew,\ncould not prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. This fact,\nperhaps more than any theoretical argument, contributed to the\ndevelopment of the realist theory. Although the United Nations,\nfounded in 1945, can still be regarded as a product of idealist\npolitical thinking, the discipline of international relations was\nprofoundly influenced in the initial years of the post-war period by\nthe works of \u201cclassical\u201d realists such as John H. Herz,\nHans Morgenthau, George Kennan, and Raymond Aron. Then, during the\n1950s and 1960s, classical realism came under challenge of scholars\nwho tried to introduce a more scientific approach to the study of\ninternational politics. During the 1980s it gave way to another trend\nin international relations theory\u2014neorealism.\n\nSince it is impossible within the scope of this article to introduce\nall of the thinkers who contributed to the development of\ntwentieth-century classical realism, E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau,\nas perhaps the most influential among them, have been selected for\ndiscussion here.\n2.1 E. H. Carr\u2019s Challenge to Utopian Idealism\n\nIn his main work on international relations, The Twenty\nYears\u2019 Crisis, first published in July 1939, Edward Hallett\nCarr (1892\u20131982) attacks the idealist position, which he\ndescribes as \u201cutopianism.\u201d He characterizes this position\nas encompassing faith in reason, confidence in progress, a sense of\nmoral rectitude, and a belief in an underlying harmony of interests.\nAccording to the idealists, war is an aberration in the course of\nnormal life and the way to prevent it is to educate people for peace,\nand to build systems of collective security such as the League of\nNations or today\u2019s United Nations. Carr challenges idealism by\nquestioning its claim to moral universalism and its idea of the\nharmony of interests. He declares that \u201cmorality can only be\nrelative, not universal\u201d (19), and states that the doctrine of\nthe harmony of interests is invoked by privileged groups \u201cto\njustify and maintain their dominant position\u201d (75).\n\nCarr uses the concept of the relativity of thought, which he traces to\nMarx and other modern theorists, to show that standards by which\npolicies are judged are the products of circumstances and interests.\nHis central idea is that the interests of a given party always\ndetermine what this party regards as moral principles, and hence,\nthese principles are not universal. Carr observes that politicians,\nfor example, often use the language of justice to cloak the particular\ninterests of their own countries, or to create negative images of\nother people to justify acts of aggression. The existence of such\ninstances of morally discrediting a potential enemy or morally\njustifying one\u2019s own position shows, he argues, that moral ideas\nare derived from actual policies. Policies are not, as the idealists\nwould have it, based on some universal norms, independent of interests\nof the parties involved.\n\nIf specific ethical standards are de facto founded on interests,\nCarr\u2019s argument goes, there are also interests underlying what\nare regarded as absolute principles or universal moral values. While\nthe idealists tend to regard such values, such as peace or justice, as\nuniversal and claim that upholding them is in the interest of all,\nCarr argues against this view. According to him, there are neither\nuniversal values nor universal interests. He claims that those who\nrefer to universal interests are in fact acting in their own interests\n(71). They think that what is best for them is best for everyone, and\nidentify their own interests with the universal interest of the world\nat large.\n\nThe idealist concept of the harmony of interests is based on\nthe notion that human beings can rationally recognize that they have\nsome interests in common, and that cooperation is therefore possible.\nCarr contrasts this idea with the reality of conflict of\ninterests. According to him, the world is torn apart by the\nparticular interests of different individuals and groups. In such a\nconflictual environment, order is based on power, not on morality.\nFurther, morality itself is the product of power (61). Like Hobbes,\nCarr regards morality as constructed by the particular legal system\nthat is enforced by a coercive power. International ethical norms are\nimposed on other countries by dominant nations or groups of nations\nthat present themselves as the international community as a whole.\nThey are invented to perpetuate those nations\u2019 dominance.\n\nValues that idealists view as good for all, such as peace, social\njustice, prosperity, and international order, are regarded by Carr as\nmere status quo notions. The powers that are satisfied with\nthe status quo regard the arrangement in place as just and therefore\npreach peace. They try to rally everyone around their idea of what is\ngood. \u201cJust as the ruling class in a community prays for\ndomestic peace, which guarantees its own security and predominance,\n\u2026 so international peace becomes a special vested interest of\npredominant powers\u201d (76). On the other hand, the unsatisfied\npowers consider the same arrangement as unjust, and so prepare for\nwar. Hence, the way to obtain peace, if it cannot be simply enforced,\nis to satisfy the unsatisfied powers. \u201cThose who profit most by\n[international] order can in the longer run only hope to maintain it\nby making sufficient concessions to make it tolerable to those who\nprofit by it least\u201d (152). The logical conclusion to be drawn by\nthe reader of Carr\u2019s book is the policy of appeasement.\n\nCarr was a sophisticated thinker. He recognized himself that the logic\nof \u201cpure realism can offer nothing but a naked struggle for\npower which makes any kind of international society impossible\u201d\n(87). Although he demolishes what he calls \u201cthe current\nutopia\u201d of idealism, he at the same time attempts to build\n\u201ca new utopia,\u201d a realist world order (ibid.).\nThus, he acknowledges that human beings need certain fundamental\nprinciples or beliefs that are shared across different cultures, and\ncontradicts his own earlier argument by which he tries to deny\nuniversality to any norms or values. To make further objections to his\nposition, the fact, as he claims, that the language of universal\nvalues can be misused in politics for the benefit of one party or\nanother, and that such values can only be imperfectly implemented in\npolitical institutions, does not mean that such values do not exist.\nThere is a deep yearning in many human beings, both privileged and\nunprivileged, for peace, order, prosperity, and justice. The\nlegitimacy of idealism consists in the constant attempt to reflect\nupon and uphold these values. Idealists fail if in their attempt they\ndo not pay enough attention to the reality of power. On the other\nhand, in the world of \u201cpure realism,\u201d in which all values\nare made relative to interests, life turns into nothing more than a\npower game and is unbearable.\n\nThe Twenty Years\u2019 Crisis touches on a number of\nuniversal ideas, but it also reflects the spirit of its time. While we\ncan fault the interwar idealists for their inability to construct\ninternational institutions strong enough to prevent the outbreak of\nthe Second World War, this book indicates that interwar realists were\nlikewise unprepared to meet the challenge. Carr frequently refers to\nGermany under Nazi rule as if it were a country like any other. He\nsays that should Germany cease to be an unsatisfied power and\n\u201cbecome supreme in Europe,\u201d it would adopt a language of\ninternational solidarity similar to that of other Western powers (79).\nThe inability of Carr and other realists to recognize the perilous\nnature of Nazism, and their belief that Germany could be satisfied by\nterritorial concessions, helped to foster a political environment in\nwhich the latter was to grow in power, annex Czechoslovakia at will,\nand be militarily opposed in September 1939 by Poland alone.\n\nA theory of international relations is not just an intellectual\nenterprise; it has practical consequences. It influences our thinking\nand political practice. On the practical side, the realists of the\n1930s, to whom Carr gave intellectual support, were people opposed to\nthe system of collective security embodied in the League of Nations.\nWorking within the foreign policy establishments of the day, they\ncontributed to its weakness. Once they had weakened the League, they\npursued a policy of appeasement and accommodation with Germany as an\nalternative to collective security (Ashworth 46). After the annexation\nof Czechoslovakia, when the failure of the anti-League realist\nconservatives gathered around Neville Chamberlain and of this policy\nbecame clear, they tried to rebuild the very security system they had\nearlier demolished. Those who supported collective security were\nlabeled idealists.\n2.2 Hans Morgenthau\u2019s Realist Principles\n\nHans J. Morgenthau (1904\u20131980) developed realism into a\ncomprehensive international relations theory. Influenced by the\nProtestant theologian and political writer Reinhold Niebuhr, as well\nas by Hobbes, he places selfishness and power-lust at the center of\nhis picture of human existence. The insatiable human lust for power,\ntimeless and universal, which he identifies with animus\ndominandi, the desire to dominate, is for him the main cause of\nconflict. As he asserts in his main work, Politics among Nations:\nThe Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948,\n\u201cinternational politics, like all politics, is a struggle for\npower\u201d (25).\n\nMorgenthau systematizes realism in international relations on the\nbasis of six principles that he includes in the second edition of\nPolitics among Nations. As a traditionalist, he opposes the\nso-called scientists (the scholars who, especially in the 1950s, tried\nto reduce the discipline of international relations to a branch of\nbehavioral science). Nevertheless, in the first principle he states\nthat realism is based on objective laws that have their roots in\nunchanging human nature (4). He wants to develop realism into both a\ntheory of international politics and a political art, a useful tool of\nforeign policy.\n\nThe keystone of Morgenthau\u2019s realist theory is the concept\nof power or \u201cof interest defined in terms of power,\u201d\nwhich informs his second principle: the assumption that political\nleaders \u201cthink and act in terms of interest defined as\npower\u201d (5). This concept defines the autonomy of politics, and\nallows for the analysis of foreign policy regardless of the different\nmotives, preferences, and intellectual and moral qualities of\nindividual politicians. Furthermore, it is the foundation of a\nrational picture of politics.\n\nAlthough, as Morgenthau explains in the third principle, interest\ndefined as power is a universally valid category, and indeed an\nessential element of politics, various things can be associated with\ninterest or power at different times and in different circumstances.\nIts content and the manner of its use are determined by the political\nand cultural environment.\n\nIn the fourth principle, Morgenthau considers the relationship between\nrealism and ethics. He says that while realists are aware of the moral\nsignificance of political action, they are also aware of the tension\nbetween morality and the requirements of successful political action.\n\u201cUniversal moral principles,\u201d he asserts, \u201ccannot be\napplied to the actions of states in their abstract universal\nformulation, but \u2026they must be filtered through the concrete\ncircumstances of time and place\u201d (9). These principles must be\naccompanied by prudence for as he cautions \u201cthere can be no\npolitical morality without prudence; that is, without consideration of\nthe political consequences of seemingly moral action\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nPrudence, the ability to judge the rightness of a given action from\namong possible alternatives on the basis of its likely political\nconsequences, and not conviction of one\u2019s own moral or\nideological superiority, should guide political decisions. This is\nstressed in the fifth principle, where Morgenthau again emphasizes the\nidea that all state actors, including our own, must be looked at\nsolely as political entities pursuing their respective interests\ndefined in terms of power. By taking this point of view\nvis-\u00e0-vis its counterparts and thus avoiding ideological\nconfrontation, a state would then be able to pursue policies that\nrespected the interests of other states, while protecting and\npromoting its own.\n\nInsofar as power, or interest defined as power, is the concept that\ndefines politics, politics is an autonomous sphere, as Morgenthau says\nin his sixth principle of realism. It cannot be subordinated to\nethics. However, ethics does still play a role in politics. \u201cA\nman who was nothing but \u2018political man\u2019 would be a beast,\nfor he would be completely lacking in moral restraints. A man who was\nnothing but \u2018moral man\u2019 would be a fool, for he would be\ncompletely lacking in prudence\u201d (12). Political art requires\nthat these two dimensions of human life, power and morality, be taken\ninto consideration.\n\nWhile Morgenthau\u2019s six principles of realism contain repetitions\nand inconsistencies, we can nonetheless obtain from them the following\npicture: Power or interest is the central concept that makes politics\ninto an autonomous discipline. Rational state actors pursue their\nnational interests. Therefore, a rational theory of international\npolitics can be constructed. Such a theory is not concerned with the\nmorality, religious beliefs, motives or ideological preferences of\nindividual political leaders. It also indicates that in order to avoid\nconflicts, states should avoid moral crusades or ideological\nconfrontations, and look for compromise based solely on satisfaction\nof their mutual interests.\n\nAlthough he defines politics as an autonomous sphere, Morgenthau does\nnot separate ethics from politics. The act of protecting one\u2019s\ncountry has for him a deep moral significance. Ultimately directed\ntoward the objective of national survival, it involves prudence that\nis related to choosing the best course of action. The effective\nprotection of citizens\u2019 lives from harm in case of an\ninternational armed conflict is not merely a forceful physical action;\nit also has prudential and moral dimensions.\n\nMorgenthau regards realism as a way of thinking about international\nrelations and a useful tool for devising policies. However, some of\nthe basic conceptions of his theory, and especially the idea of\nconflict as stemming from human nature, as well as the concept of\npower itself, have provoked criticism.\n\nInternational politics, like all politics, is for Morgenthau a\nstruggle for power because of the basic human lust for power. But\nregarding every individual as being engaged in a perpetual quest for\npower\u2014the view that he shares with Hobbes\u2014is a\nquestionable premise. Human nature cannot be revealed by observation\nand experiment. It cannot be proved by any empirical research, but\nonly disclosed by philosophy, imposed on us as a matter of belief, and\ninculcated by education.\n\nMorgenthau himself reinforces the belief in the human drive for power\nby introducing a normative aspect of his theory, which is rationality.\nA rational foreign policy is considered \u201cto be a good foreign\npolicy\u201d (7). But he defines rationality as a process of\ncalculating the costs and benefits of all alternative policies in\norder to determine their relative utility, i.e. their ability to\nmaximize power. Statesmen \u201cthink and act in terms of interest\ndefined as power\u201d (5). Only intellectual weakness of policy\nmakers can result in foreign policies that deviate from a rational\ncourse aimed at minimizing risks and maximizing benefits. Hence,\nrather than presenting an actual portrait of human affairs, Morgenthau\nemphasizes the pursuit of power and the rationality of this pursuit,\nand sets it up as a norm.\n\nAs Raymond Aron and other scholars have noticed, power, the\nfundamental concept of Morgenthau\u2019s realism, is ambiguous. It\ncan be either a means or an end in politics. But if power is only a\nmeans for gaining something else, it does not define the nature of\ninternational politics in the way Morgenthau claims. It does not allow\nus to understand the actions of states independently from the motives\nand ideological preferences of their political leaders. It cannot\nserve as the basis for defining politics as an autonomous sphere.\nMorgenthau\u2019s principles of realism are thus open to doubt.\n\u201cIs this true,\u201d Aron asks, \u201cthat states, whatever\ntheir regime, pursue the same kind of foreign policy\u201d (597) and\nthat the foreign policies of Napoleon or Stalin are essentially\nidentical to those of Hitler, Louis XVI or Nicholas II, amounting to\nno more than the struggle for power? \u201cIf one answers yes, then\nthe proposition is incontestable, but not very instructive\u201d\n(598). Accordingly, it is useless to define actions of states by\nexclusive reference to power, security or national interest.\nInternational politics cannot be studied independently of the wider\nhistorical and cultural context.\n\nCarr and Morgenthau concentrate primarily on international relations.\nHowever, their political realism can also be applied to domestic\npolitics. To be a classical realist is in general to perceive politics\nas a conflict of interests and a struggle for power, and to seek peace\nby recognizing common interests and trying to satisfy them, rather\nthan by moralizing. Bernard Williams and Raymond Geuss, influential\nrepresentatives of the new political realism, a movement in\ncontemporary political theory, criticize what they describe as\n\u201cpolitical moralism\u201d and stress the autonomy of politics\nagainst ethics. However, political theory realism and international\nrelations realism seem like two separate research programs. As noted\nby several scholars (William Scheuerman, Alison McQueen, Terry Nardin.\nDuncan Bell), those who contribute to realism in political theory give\nlittle attention to those who work on realism in international\npolitics.\n3. Neorealism\n\nIn spite of its ambiguities and weaknesses, Morgenthau\u2019s\nPolitics among Nations became a standard textbook and\ninfluenced thinking about international politics for a generation or\nso. At the same time, there was an attempt to develop a more\nmethodologically rigorous approach to theorizing about international\naffairs. In the 1950s and 1960s a large influx of scientists from\ndifferent fields entered the discipline of International Relations and\nattempted to replace the \u201cwisdom literature\u201d of classical\nrealists with scientific concepts and reasoning (Brown 35). This in\nturn provoked a counterattack by Morgenthau and scholars associated\nwith the so-called English School, especially Hedley Bull, who\ndefended a traditional approach (Bull 1966).\n\nAs a result, the discipline of international relations has been\ndivided into two main strands: traditional or non-positivist and\nscientific or positivist (neo-positivist). At a later stage the third\nstrand: post-positivism has been added. The traditionalists raise\nnormative questions and engage with history, philosophy and law. The\nscientists or positivists stress a descriptive and explanatory form of\ninquiry, rather than a normative one. They have established a strong\npresence in the field. Already by the mid-1960s, the majority of\nAmerican students in international relations were trained in\nquantitative research, game theory, and other new research techniques\nof the social sciences. This, along with the changing international\nenvironment, had a significant effect on the discipline. \n\nNotwithstanding their methodological differences, realists\u2019\nassumption is that the state is the key actor in international\npolitics, and that competitive and conflictual relations among states\nare the core of actual international relations. However, with the\nreceding of the Cold War during the 1970s, one could witness the\ngrowing importance of other actors: international and non-governmental\norganizations, as well as of multinational corporations. This\ndevelopment led to a revival of idealist thinking, which became known\nas neoliberalism or pluralism. While accepting some basic assumptions\nof realism, the leading pluralists, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye,\nhave proposed the concept of complex interdependence to\ndescribe this more sophisticated picture of global politics. They\nwould argue that states could effectively cooperate with each other\nfor mutual benefit and there can be progress in international\nrelations, and that the future does not need to look like the\npast.\n3.1 Kenneth Waltz\u2019s International System\n\nThe realist retort came most prominently from Kenneth N. Waltz, who\nreformulated realism in international relations in a new and\ndistinctive way. In his book Theory of International\nPolitics, first published in 1979, he responded to the liberal\nchallenge and attempted to cure the defects of the classical realism\nof Hans Morgenthau with his more scientific approach, which has become\nknown as structural realism or neorealism. Whereas Morgenthau rooted\nhis theory in the struggle for power, which he related to human\nnature, Waltz made an effort to avoid any philosophical discussion of\nhuman nature, and set out instead to build a theory of international\npolitics using microeconomics as a model. In his works, he argues that\nstates in the international system are like firms in a domestic\neconomy and have the same fundamental interest: to survive.\n\u201cInternationally, the environment of states\u2019 actions, or\nthe structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states\nprefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act\nwith relative efficiency to achieve that end\u201d (93).\n\nWaltz maintains that by paying attention to the individual state, and\nto ideological, moral and economic issues, both traditional liberals\nand classical realists make the same mistake. They fail to develop a\nserious account of the international system\u2014one that can be\nabstracted from the wider socio-political domain. Waltz acknowledges\nthat such an abstraction distorts reality and omits many of the\nfactors that were important for classical realism. It does not allow\nfor the analysis of the development of specific foreign policies.\nHowever, it also has utility. Notably, it assists in understanding the\nprimary determinants of international politics. To be sure,\nWaltz\u2019s neorealist theory cannot be applied to domestic\npolitics. It cannot serve to develop policies of states concerning\ntheir international or domestic affairs. His theory helps only to\nexplain why states behave in similar ways despite their different\nforms of government and diverse political ideologies, and why, despite\ntheir growing interdependence, the overall picture of international\nrelations is unlikely to change.\n\nAccording to Waltz, the uniform behavior of states over centuries can\nbe explained by the constraints on their behavior that are imposed by\nthe structure of the international system. A system\u2019s structure\nis defined first by the principle by which it is organized, then by\nthe differentiation of its units, and finally by the distribution of\ncapabilities (power) across units. Anarchy, or the absence of central\nauthority, is for Waltz the ordering principle of the international\nsystem. The units of the international system are states. Waltz\nrecognizes the existence of non-state actors, but dismisses them as\nrelatively unimportant. Since all states want to survive, and anarchy\npresupposes a self-help system in which each state has to take care of\nitself, there is no division of labor or functional differentiation\namong them. While functionally similar, they are nonetheless\ndistinguished by their relative capabilities (the power each of them\nrepresents) to perform the same function.\n\nConsequently, Waltz sees power and state behavior in a different way\nfrom the classical realists. For Morgenthau power was both a means and\nan end, and rational state behavior was understood as simply the\ncourse of action that would accumulate the most power. In contrast,\nneorealists assume that the fundamental interest of each state is\nsecurity and would therefore concentrate on the distribution of power.\nWhat also sets neorealism apart from classical realism is\nmethodological rigor and scientific self-conception (Guzinni 1998,\n127\u2013128). Waltz insists on empirical testability of knowledge\nand on falsificationism as a methodological ideal, which, as he\nhimself admits, can have only a limited application in international\nrelations. \n\nThe distribution of capabilities among states can vary; however,\nanarchy, the ordering principle of international relations, remains\nunchanged. This has a lasting effect on the behavior of states that\nbecome socialized into the logic of self-help. Trying to refute\nneoliberal ideas concerning the effects of interdependence, Waltz\nidentifies two reasons why the anarchic international system limits\ncooperation: insecurity and unequal gains. In the context of anarchy,\neach state is uncertain about the intentions of others and is afraid\nthat the possible gains resulting from cooperation may favor other\nstates more than itself, and thus lead it to dependence on others.\n\u201cStates do not willingly place themselves in situations of\nincreased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of\nsecurity subordinate economic gain to political interest.\u201d\n(Waltz 1979, 107).\n\nBecause of its theoretical elegance and methodological rigor,\nneorealism has become very influential within the discipline of\ninternational relations. In the eyes of many scholars,\nMorgenthau\u2019s realism has come to be seen as\nanachronistic\u2014\u201can interesting and important episode in the\nhistory of thinking about the subject, no doubt, but one scarcely to\nbe seen as a serious contribution of the rigorously scientific\ntheory\u201d (Williams 2007, 1). However, while initially gaining\nmore acceptance than classical realism, neorealism has also provoked\nstrong critiques on a number of fronts.\n3.2 Objections to Neorealism\n\nIn 1979 Waltz wrote that in the nuclear age the international bipolar\nsystem, based on two superpowers\u2014the United States and the\nSoviet Union\u2014was not only stable but likely to persist\n(176\u20137). With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent\ndisintegration of the USSR this prediction was proven wrong. The\nbipolar world turned out to have been more precarious than most\nrealist analysts had supposed. Its end opened new possibilities and\nchallenges related to globalization. This has led many critics to\nargue that neorealism, like classical realism, cannot adequately\naccount for changes in world politics.\n\nThe new debate between international (neo)realists and (neo)liberals\nis no longer concerned with the questions of morality and human\nnature, but with the extent to which state behavior is influenced by\nthe anarchic structure of the international system rather than by\ninstitutions, learning and other factors that are conductive to\ncooperation. In his 1989 book International Institutions and State\nPower, Robert Keohane accepts Waltz\u2019s emphasis on\nsystem-level theory and his general assumption that states are\nself-interested actors that rationally pursue their goals. However, by\nemploying game theory he shows that states can widen the perception of\ntheir self-interest through economic cooperation and involvement in\ninternational institutions. Patterns of interdependence can thus\naffect world politics. Keohane calls for systemic theories that would\nbe able to deal better with factors affecting state interaction, and\nwith change.\n\nCritical theorists, such as Robert W. Cox, also focus on the alleged\ninability of neorealism to deal with change. In their view,\nneorealists take a particular, historically determined state-based\nstructure of international relations and assume it to be universally\nvalid. In contrast, critical theorists believe that by analyzing the\ninterplay of ideas, material factors, and social forces, one can\nunderstand how this structure has come about, and how it may\neventually change (Cox 1986). They contend that neorealism ignores\nboth the historical process during which identities and interests are\nformed, and the diverse methodological possibilities. It legitimates\nthe existing status quo of strategic relations among states and\nconsiders the scientific method as the only way of obtaining\nknowledge. It represents an exclusionary practice, an interest in\ndomination and control.\n\nWhile realists are concerned with relations among states and national\nsecurity, the focus for critical theorists is human security and\nsocial emancipation. They focus on social, economic and environmental\nsecurity for the individual and the group. Despite their differences,\ncritical theory, postmodernism and feminism all take issue with the\nnotion of state sovereignty and envision new political communities\nthat would be less exclusionary vis-\u00e0-vis marginal and\ndisenfranchised groups. Critical theory argues against state-based\nexclusion and denies that the interests of a country\u2019s citizens\ntake precedence over those of outsiders. It insists that politicians\nshould give as much weight to the interests of foreigners as they give\nto those of their compatriots and envisions political structures\nbeyond the \u201cfortress\u201d nation-state. Postmodernism\nquestions the state\u2019s claim to be a legitimate focus of human\nloyalties and its right to impose social and political boundaries. It\nsupports cultural diversity and stresses the interests of minorities.\nFeminism argues that the realist theory exhibits a masculine bias and\nadvocates the inclusion of woman and alternative values into public\nlife.\n\nSince critical theories and other alternative theoretical perspectives\nquestion the existing status quo, make knowledge dependent on power,\nand emphasize identity formation and social change, they are not\ntraditional or non-positivist. They are sometimes called\n\u201creflectivist\u201d or \u201cpost-positivist\u201d (Weaver\n165) and represent a radical departure from the neorealist and\nneoliberal \u201crationalist\u201d or \u201cpositivist\u201d\ninternational relation theories. For critical security theorists,\nsecurity is not an objective phenomenon. It is essentially social,\nsocially constructed and serves a political agenda. It legitimizes and\nimposes a political program on society that serves the dominant group.\nAccording to the critical securitization theory, the securitizing\nactor, who could be a politician or the governing party,\n\u201cencodes a subject or a group as an existential threat to the\nreference object\u201d (Ari 147). The object could be a state or a\nnon-state group. Such a discursive practice defines threat and\ndanger.\n\nConstructivists, such as Alexander Wendt, try to build a bridge\nbetween these two approaches, positivist and post-positivist, by on\nthe one hand, taking the present state system and anarchy seriously,\nand on the other hand, by focusing on the formation of identities and\ninterests. Countering neorealist ideas, Wendt argues that self-help\ndoes not follow logically or casually from the principle of anarchy.\nIt is socially constructed. Wendt\u2019s idea that states\u2019\nidentities and interests are socially constructed has earned his\nposition the label \u201cconstructivism\u201d. Consequently, in his\nview,\u201cself-help and power politics are institutions, and not\nessential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of\nit\u201d (Wendt 1987 395). There is no single logic of anarchy but\nrather several, depending on the roles with which states identify\nthemselves and each other. Power and interests are constituted by\nideas and norms. Wendt claims that neorealism cannot account for\nchange in world politics, but his norm-based constructivism can.\n\nA similar conclusion, although derived in a traditional way, comes\nfrom the non-positivist theorists of the English school (International\nSociety approach) who emphasize both systemic and normative\nconstraints on the behavior of states. Referring to the classical view\nof the human being as an individual that is basically social and\nrational, capable of cooperating and learning from past experiences,\nthese theorists emphasize that states, like individuals, have\nlegitimate interests that others can recognize and respect, and that\nthey can recognize the general advantages of observing a principle of\nreciprocity in their mutual relations (Jackson and S\u00f8rensen\n167). Therefore, states can bind themselves to other states by\ntreaties and develop some common values with other states. Hence, the\nstructure of the international system is not unchangeable as the\nneorealists claim. It is not a permanent Hobbesian anarchy, permeated\nby the danger of war. An anarchic international system based on pure\npower relations among actors can evolve into a more cooperative and\npeaceful international society, in which state behavior is shaped by\ncommonly shared values and norms. A practical expression of\ninternational society are international organizations that uphold the\nrule of law in international relations, especially the UN.\n4. Conclusion: The Cautionary and Changing Character of Realism\n\nAn unintended and unfortunate consequence of the debate about\nneorealism is that neorealism and a large part of its critique (with\nthe notable exception of the English School) has been expressed in\nabstract scientific and philosophical terms. This has made the theory\nof international politics almost inaccessible to a layperson and has\ndivided the discipline of international relations into incompatible\nparts. Whereas classical realism was a theory aimed at supporting\ndiplomatic practice and providing a guide to be followed by those\nseeking to understand and deal with potential threats, today\u2019s\ntheories, concerned with various grand pictures and projects, are\nill-suited to perform this task. This is perhaps the main reason why\nthere has been a renewed interest in classical realism, and\nparticularly in the ideas of Morgenthau. Rather than being seen as an\nobsolete form of pre-scientific realist thought, superseded by\nneorealist theory, his thinking is now considered to be more complex\nand of greater contemporary relevance than was earlier recognized\n(Williams 2007, 1\u20139). It fits uneasily in the orthodox picture\nof realism he is usually associated with. \n\nIn recent years, scholars have questioned prevailing narratives about\nclear theoretical traditions in the discipline of international\nrelations. Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and other thinkers have\nbecome subject to re-examination as a means of challenging prevailing\nuses of their legacies in the discipline and exploring other lineages\nand orientations. Morgenthau has undergone a similar process of\nreinterpretation. A number of scholars (Hartmut Behr, Muriel Cozette,\nAmelia Heath, Sean Molloy) have endorsed the importance of his thought\nas a source of change for the standard interpretation of realism.\nMurielle Cozette stresses Morgenthau\u2019s critical dimension of\nrealism expressed in his commitment to \u201cspeak truth to\npower\u201d and to \u201cunmask power\u2019s claims to truth and\nmorality,\u201d and in his tendency to assert different claims at\ndifferent times (Cozette 10\u201312). She writes: \u201cThe\nprotection of human life and freedom are given central importance by\nMorgenthau, and constitute a \u2018transcendent standard of\nethics\u2019 which should always animate scientific enquiries\u201d\n(19). This shows the flexibility of his classical realism and reveals\nhis normative assumptions based on the promotion of universal moral\nvalues. While Morgenthau assumes that states are power-oriented\nactors, he at the same time acknowledges that international politics\nwould be more pernicious than it actually is were it not for moral\nrestraints and the work of international law(Behr and Heath 333). \n\nAnother avenue for the development of a realist theory of\ninternational relations is offered by Robert Gilpin\u2019s seminal\nwork War and Change in World Politics. If this work were to\ngain greater prominence in IR scholarship, instead of engaging in\nfruitless theoretical debates, we would be better prepared today\n\u201cfor rapid power shifts and geopolitical change\n\u201d(Wohlforth, 2011 505). We would be able to explain the causes\nof great wars and long periods of peace, and the creation and waning\nof international orders. Still another avenue is provided by the\napplication of the new scientific discoveries to social sciences. The\nevidence for this is, for example, the recent work of Alexander Wendt,\nQuantum Mind and Social Science. A new realist approach to\ninternational politics could be based on the organic and holistic\nworld view emerging from quantum theory, the idea of human evolution,\nand the growing awareness of the role of human beings in the\nevolutionary process (Korab-Karpowicz 2017). \n\nRealism is thus more than a static, amoral theory, and cannot be\naccommodated solely within a positivist interpretation of\ninternational relations. It is a practical and evolving theory that\ndepends on the actual historical and political conditions, and is\nultimately judged by its ethical standards and by its relevance in\nmaking prudent political decisions (Morgenthau 1962). In place of the\ntwentieth-century Cold War ideological rivalry, the main competition\nin the twenty-first-century is between the ideologies justifying the\nexpansion of the US-dominated unipolar world and those supporting the\nreestablishment of a multipolar one (M\u00fcllerson 2017).\nConsequently, the growing tensions among superpowers have contributed\nto the revival of the idealist-realist debate and have caused a\nresurgence of interest in realism. John Mearsheimer is an important\nthinker in this respect, known for his pessimistic concept of\noffensive realism, which assumes that powerful states, such as the\nUnited States, would aim at the maximization of power and domination\nover others (Mearsheimer 2001). His late work, The Liberal\nDelusion (Mearsheimer 2019), in which he presents realist\narguments against a liberal position, can already be considered a\nclassic of the theory of international relations. \n\nAs the current revival of interest proves, realism is a theory for\ndifficult times, when security becomes a real issue. This happens when\ncountries face the danger of an armed conflict. In such situations,\nrealism performs a useful cautionary role. It warns us against\nprogressivism, moralism, legalism and other orientations that lose\ntouch with the reality of self-interest and power. It is a necessary\ncorrective to an overoptimistic liberal belief in international\ncooperation and change resulting from interdependence, as well as to a\ncritical theory claim that our insecurity is merely a result of\nsecuritization.\n\nNevertheless, when it becomes a dogmatic enterprise, by focusing on\nconflict alone, realism fails to perform its proper function as a\ntheory of international relations. By remaining stuck in a\nstate-centric and excessively simplified \u201cparadigm\u201d such\nas neorealism and by denying the possibility of any progress in\ninterstate relations, it turns into an ideology. Its emphasis on power\npolitics and national interest can be misused to justify aggression.\nIt has therefore to be supplanted by theories that take better account\nof the dramatically changing picture of global politics. To its merely\nnegative, cautionary function, positive norms must be added. These\nnorms extend from the rationality and prudence stressed by classical\nrealists; through the vision of multilateralism, international law,\nand an international society emphasized by liberals and members of the\nEnglish School; to the cosmopolitanism and global solidarity advocated\nby many of today\u2019s writers.\n",
