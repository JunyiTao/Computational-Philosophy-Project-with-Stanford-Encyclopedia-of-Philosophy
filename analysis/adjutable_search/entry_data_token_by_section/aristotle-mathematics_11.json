    "main_text": "Universal Mathematics\n8. Universal Mathematics\n\n\nAncillary to his discussions of being qua being and theology\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), Aristotle suggests an analogy with\nmathematics. If the analogy is that there is a super-science of\nmathematics coverying all continuous magnitudes and discrete\nquantities, such as numbers, then we should expect that Greek\nmathematicians conceived of a general mathematical subject as a\nprecursor of algebra, Descartes' mathesis universalis (universal\nlearning/mathematics), and mathematical logic. \n\n\nAristotle reports (Posterior Analytics. i.5, cf.\nMetaphysics xiii.2) that whereas mathematicians proved\ntheorems such as a : b = c : d\n=> a : c = b : d (alternando)\nseparately for number, lines, planes, and solids, now there is one\nsingle general or universal proof for all (see Section 3). The\ndiscovery of universal proofs is usually associated with Eudoxus'\ntheory of proportion. For Aristotle this creates a problem since a\nscience concerns a genus or kind, but also there seems to be no kind\ncomprising number and magnitude. Some scholars have proposed that a\nuniversal science of \u2018posology\u2019 (a science of quantity)\ntakes the whole category of quantity as its subject.\n\n\nAristotle seems more reticent, describing the proofs as concerning\nlines, etc., qua having such and such increment (An. Post.\nii.17). He seems to identify such a super-mathematics\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), but seems to imply that it does not\ntake a determinate kind as its subject. Another possibility is that the\ncommon science has theorems which apply by analogy to the different\nmathematical kinds.\n\n\nElsewhere (Metaphysics xi.4), where Aristotle builds an\nanalogy with the science of being qua being, he seems to suggest that\nuniversal proofs of quantities (here too including numbers) concern\ncontinuous quantity (unlike the similar passage in Metaphysics\niv.3). If so and if this is by Aristotle, it would correspond to the\ngeneral theory of proportions as it comes down to us. One may well\nwonder if scholars have been led astray by a hyperbole about universal\nproofs.\n\n\nIronically, extant Greek mathematics shows no traces of an\nAristotelian universal mathematics. The theory of ratio for magnitudes\nin Euclid, Elements v is completely separate from the\ntreatment of ratio for number in Elements vii and parts of\nviii, none of which appeals to v, even though almost all of the proofs\nof v could apply straightforwardly to numbers. For example, Euclid\nprovides separate definitions of proportion (v def. 5, and vii def.\n20). Compare the rule above (alternando),which is proved at v.16, while\nthe rule follows trivially for numbers from the commutivity of\nmultiplication and vii.19: ad = bc \u21d4 a\n: b = c : d.\n9. Place and continuity of Magnitudes\n\n\nIn Plato's Academy, some philosophers suggested that lines are composed\nof indivisible magnitude, whether a finite number (a line of\nindivisible lines) or a infinite number (a line of infinite points).\nAristotle builds a theory of continuity and infinite divisibility of\ngeometrical objects. Aristotle denies both conceptions. Yet, he needs\nto give an account of continuous magnitudes that is also free from\nparadoxes that these theories attempted to avoid. The elements of his\naccount may be found principally in Physics iv.1-5 and v.1 and\nvi. Aristotle's account pertains to perceptible magnitudes. However, it\nis clear that he understands this to apply to magnitudes in mathematics\nas well. \n\n\nAristotle has many objections to thinking of a line as composed of\nactual points (likewise, a plane of lines, etc.), including:\n\nNo point in a line is adjacent to another point.\nIf a line is composed of actual points, than to move a distance an\nobject would have to complete an infinite number of tasks (as suggested\nby Zeno's arguments against motion)\n\n\n\nTo say that a line is comprised of an infinity of potential points\nis no more than to say that a line may be divided (with a line-cutter,\nwith the mind, etc.) anywhere on it, that any potential point may be\nbrought to actuality. The continuity of a line consists in the fact\nthat any actualized point within the line will hold together the line\nsegments on each side. Otherwise, it makes no sense to speak of a\npotential point actually holding two potential lines together.\n\n\nSuppose I have a line AB and cut it at C. The\nlines AC and CB are distinct. Is C one point\nor two?\nC is one point in number.\n\nC is two points in its being or formula\n(logos).\n\n\nThis merely means that we can treat it once or twice or as many times\nas we choose. Note that Aristotle says the same thing about a\ncontinuous proportion. in a : b = b :\nc, b is one magnitude in being, but is used as two. \n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nPlace and continuity of Magnitudes\n10. Unit (monas) and Number (arithmos)\n10.1 Background\n\n\nGreek mathematicians tend to conceive of number (arithmos) as\na plurality of units. Perhaps a better translation, without our deeply\nentrenched notions, would be \u2018count\u2019. Their conception\ninvolves: \n\nA number is constructed out of some countable entity, unit\n(monas).\nNumbers are more like concatenations of units and are not sets. To\ndraw a contrast with modern treatments of numbers, a Greek pair or a\ntwo is neither a subset of a triple, nor a member of a triple. It is a\npart of three. If I say that ten cows are hungry, then I am not saying\nthat a set is hungry. Or to point to another use of \u2018set\u2019, my 12 piece\nteaset is in a cabinet, not in an abstract universe. So too, these ten\nunits are a part of these twenty units: \n\n\n\nOne (a unit) typically is not a number (but Aristotle is ambivalent\non this), since a number is a plurality of units.\nAt least in theoretical discussions of numbers, a fractional part\nis not a number.\nIn other words, numbers are members of the series: 2, 3, \u2026,\nwith 1 conceived as the \u2018beginning\u2019 (arch\u00ea)\nof number or as the least number.\nIn early Greek mathematics (5th century), numbers were represented\nby arrangements of pebbles. Later (at least by the 3rd century BCE)\nthey were represented by evenly divided lines.\n\n\n\nFor Aristotle and his contemporaries there are several fundamental\nproblems in understanding number and arithmetic:\n\nThe precision problem of mathematicals is similar in the case of\ngeometrical entities and units (see Section 6). Consider, for example,\nPlato's discussion of incompatible features of a finger as presenting\none or two things to sight. Aristotle deals with the problem in his\ndiscussion of measure (see Section 10.1).\nThe separability problem is the same as for geometry (see Section\n6).\nThe plurality problem of mathematicals (Section 6) is similar in\nthe case of geometrical entities and units, with some differences. To\ncount \u2018perceptible\u2019 units, or rather units from abstraction\n(cf. Section 7.1), one needs some principle of individuating units,\nwhat one is counting, whether cows or categories of predication.\nAristotle says that one can always find an appropriate classification\n(we may assume that some classifications would be fairly convoluted,\nbut that this is at best an aesthetic and not a logical problem). For\nunits, one will use the same principle that allows one to individuate\ntriangles. This is why Aristotle can describe a point as\nunit-having-position. Arithmetic involves the study of entities qua\nindivisible.\nThe unity problem of numbers: This problem\nbedevils philosophy of mathematics from Plato to Husserl. What makes a\ncollection of units a unity which we identify as a number? It cannot be\nphysical juxtaposition of units. Is it merely mental stipulation?\n\n\n\nAristotle does not seem bothered by:\n\nThe overlap problem: What guarantees that when I\nadd this 3 and this 5 that the correct result is not 5, 6, or 7, namely\nthat some units in this 3 are not also in this 5.\n\n\n\nAristotle presents three Academic solutions to these problems. Units\nare comparable if they can be counted together (such as the ten cows in\nthe field). Units are not comparable, if it is conceptually impossible\nto count them together (a less intuitive notion). \n\nIncomparable Units: Form numbers are conceived as\nordinals, with units conceived as being well ordered. What makes this\nnumber 3 is not that it is a concatenation of three units, but that its\nunit is the third unit in this series of units. Hence, it is simply\nfalse that there is a unity of the first three units forming a number\nthree. What makes an ordinary concatenation, e.g., a herd of cows, ten\ncows is that they can be counted according to the series of\nForm-numbers. The notion of incomparable numbers lacks the basic\nconception of numbers as concatenations of units.\nComparable/Incomparable Units: Form numbers are,\nof course, special. Each is a complete unity of units. For example, the\nForm of 3 is a unity of three units. Since it is a unity, it cannot be\nan accident that these three units form this unity. They are comparable\nwith each other in the sense that together they comprise Three Itself\nand perhaps cannot be conceived separately. Hence, they cannot be parts\nof any other Form number. We cannot take 2 units from the Three Itself\nand add them to 4 units in the Six itself, to get a Form-number of the\nSeven itself. Myles Burnyeat once suggested an analogy with a sequence\nof playing cards of one suit, say\n diamonds.[1]\n Each card from ace (unit) to ten contains the appropriate diamonds\n(from 1 to 10) on each card, unified by their being on their\nparticular card. Yet we don't count up two diamonds from the deuce and\ntwo from the trey, but treat each card as a complete unity.\nComparable Units: These are intermediate or\nmathematical numbers (see Section 6). There is a unlimited number of\nunits (enough to do arithmetic), which are arranged and so forth.\nComparable numbers solve the plurality problem, but not the unity\nproblem.\n\n\n\nAristotle reports that some Academics opted for a version of\nIncomparable or Comparable/Incomparable Units to solve the unity\nproblem and introduced comparable units as the objects of mathematical\ntheorems, e.g., given some comparable units, they are even if they can\nbe divided in half, into two concatenations corresponding to\n(participating in) the same Form-number.\n10.2 Measure (metron)\n10.2.1 Background\n\n\nGreeks used an Egyptian system of fractions. With the exception of 2/3,\nall fractions are proper parts which modern readers will see as unit\nfractions: 1/n. For example, 2/5 is 1/3 1/15 (that is, the sum of 1/3\nand 1/15). Additionally, Greeks used systems of measure, as we do, with\nunits of measure being divided up into more refined units of measure. 1\nfoot is 16 finger-widths (inches). Hence, one can always eliminate\nfractions by going, as we do, to a more refined measure (1, 1/2, 1/4\nfeet or 1 foot 12 inches). This feature of measure may be reflected in\nPlato's observation (Rep. vii) that in arithmetic, one can\nalways eliminate parts of units. \n10.2.2 Aristotle's views\n\n\nSince Aristotle (esp. Metaphysics x.1-2) treats measurement under his\ndiscussions of units (and hence number), it turns out that the\nprecision problem becomes a problem of sorting out precise units of\nmeasure. Hence, in the case discrete quantities, such as cows, the unit\nis very precise, one cow. In the case of continuous quantities, the\nmost precise unit of time is the time it takes for the fixed stars (the\nfastest things in the universe) to move the smallest perceptible\ndistance. But a point or indivisible with position removed or a cow qua\nunit, i.e., a mathematical unit, is precise. \n10.3 Time\n\n\nAristotle's treatment of time (Physics iv.10-14) includes some\nobservations about numbers which come closest to being an account of\nnumber. Aristotle defines time as the number or count of change and\nthen proceeds to distinguish two senses of number, what is counted\n(e.g., ten cows as measured by the cow-unit, or ten feet as measured by\nthe foot-unit) and that by which we count. Time is number in the first\nsense, not as so-many changes, but as so-much change as measured by a\nunit of change. Aristotle clarifies the distinction between what is\ncounted (or is countable) and that by which we count. These five black\ncats (number as what is counted) are different from these five brown\ncats, but their number (that by which we count) is the same. \n\n\n\nBut what are the numbers by which we count? Aristotle says nothing, but\nwe may speculate that the five by which we count is the single formal\nexplanation of what makes the five black cats five and what makes the\nfive brown cats five. Hence, Aristotle probably subscribes to an\nAristotelian version of the distinction between intermediate and\nForm-numbers. \n\n\nAristotle's discussion of time also gives us some insight into the\nunity problem. What gives the five black cats unity is just that they\ncan be treated as a unity. From this it follows for Aristotle that\nthere can be no number without mind. Nothing is countable unless there\nexists a counter.\n11. Mathematics and Hypothetical Necessity\n\n\nIt is often supposed, for Aristotle, mathematical explanation plays no\nrole in the study of nature, especially in biology. This conception is,\nmost of all, a product of anti-scholastics of the late Renaissance, who\nsought to draw the greatest chasm between their own mechanism and\nscholasticism. Mathematics plays a vital role in both. The principal\nway in which mathematics enters into biological explanation is through\nhypothetical necessity: \nIf X is to have feature Y (which is good\nfor X), then it is a feature of its matter that Z be\nthe case.\n\nZ may be a constraint determined by a mathematical fact.\nFor example, animals by nature do not have an odd number of feet. For\nif one had an odd number of feet, it would walk awkardly or the feet\nwould have to be of different lengths (De incessuanimalium 9).\nTo see this, imagine an isosceles triangle with a altitude drawn.\n12. The Infinite (apeiron)\n\n\nAristotle famously rejects the infinite in mathematics and in\nphysics, with some notable exceptions. He defines it thus:\nThe infinite is that for which it is always possible to\ntake something outside.\n\n\nImplicit in this notion is an unending series of magnitudes, which will\nbe achieved either by dividing a magnitude (the infinite by division)\nor by adding a magnitude to it (the infinite by addition). This is why\nhe conceives of the infinite as pertaining to material explanation, as\nit is indeterminate and involves potential cutting or joining (cf.\nSection 7.5). \n\n\nAristotle argues that in the case of magnitudes, an infinitely large\nmagnitude and an infinitely small magnitude cannot exist. In fact, he\nthinks that universe is finite in size. He also agrees with Anaxagoras,\nthat given any magnitude, it is possible to take a smaller. Hence, he\nallows that there are infinite magnitudes in a different sense. Since\nit is always possible to divide a magnitude, the series of division is\nunending and so is infinite. This is a potential, but never actual\ninfinite. For each division potentially exists. Similarly, since it is\nalways possible to add to a finite magnitude that is smaller than the\nwhole universe continually smaller magnitudes, there is a potential\ninfinite in addition. That series too need never end. For example, if I\nadd to some magnitude a foot board, and then less than a half a foot,\nand then less than a fourth, and so forth, the total amount added will never\nexceed two feet. Aristotle claims that the mathematician never needs\nany other notion of the infinite.\n\n\nHowever, since Aristotle believes that the universe has no beginning\nand is eternal, it follows that in the past there have been an infinite\nnumber of days. Hence, his rejection of the actual infinite in the case\nof magnitude does not seem to extend to the concept of time.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle on the Infinite\n13. Aristotle and the Evidence for the History of Mathematics\n\n\nAs philosophers usually do, Aristotle cites simple or familiar examples\nfrom contemporary mathematics, although we should keep in mind that\neven basic geometry such as we find in Euclid's Elements would\nhave been advanced studies. The average education in mathematics would\nhave been basic arithmetical operations (possibly called\nlogistik\u00ea) and metrological geometry (given certain\ndimensions of a figure, to find other dimensions), such as were also\ntaught in Egypt. Aristotle does allude to this sort of mathematics on\noccasion, but most of his examples come from the sort of mathematics\nwhich we have come to associate with Greece, the constructing of\nfigures from given figures and rules, and the proving that figures have\ncertain properties, and the \u2018discovery\u2019 of numbers with\ncertain properties or proving that certain classes of numbers have\ncertain properties. If we attend carefully to his examples, we can even\nsee an emerging picture of elementary geometry as taught in the\nAcademy. In the supplement are provided twenty-five of his favorite\npropositions (the list is not exhaustive). \n\n\nAristotle also makes some mathematical claims that are genuinely\nproblematic. Was he ignorant of contemporary work? Why does he ignore\nsome of the great problems of his time? Is there any reason why\nAristotle should be expected, for example to refer to conic sections?\nNonetheless, Aristotle does engage in some original and difficult\nmathematics. Certainly, in this Aristotle was more an active\nmathematician than his mentor, Plato.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle and Greek Mathematics\nGlossary\n\n\nThe standard English translation is given first, and, where\nappropirate, other more idiomatic translations.
