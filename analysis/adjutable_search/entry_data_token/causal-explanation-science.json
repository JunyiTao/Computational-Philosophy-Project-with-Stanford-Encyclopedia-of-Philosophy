For a discussion of earlier\naccounts of explanation including the deductive-nomological (DN)\nmodel, Wesley Salmon\u2019s statistical relevance and causal\nmechanical models, and unificationist models, see the general entry on\n scientific explanation.\n Recent accounts of non-causal explanation will be discussed in a\nseparate entry. In addition, a substantial amount of recent discussion\nof causation and causal explanation has been conducted within the\nframework of causal models. To avoid overlap with the entry on\n causal models\n we do not discuss this literature here.\n\nOur focus in this entry is on the following three accounts \u2013\nSection 1 those that focus on mechanisms and mechanistic explanations,\nSection 2 the kairetic account of explanation, and Section 3\ninterventionist accounts of causal explanation. All of these have as\ntheir target explanations of why or perhaps how some\nphenomenon occurs (in contrast to, say, explanations of what\nsomething is, which is generally taken to be non-causal) and they\nattempt to capture causal explanations that aim at such explananda.\nSection 4 then takes up some recent proposals having to do with how\ncausal explanations may differ in explanatory depth or goodness.\nSection 5 discusses some issues having to do with what is distinctive\nabout causal (as opposed to non-causal) explanations.\n\nWe also make the following preliminary observation. An account of\ncausal explanation in science may leave open the possibility that\nthere are other sorts of explanations of a non-causal variety (it is\njust that the account does not claim to capture these, at least\nwithout substantial modifications) or it may, more ambitiously, claim\nthat all explanations of the why/how variety are, at least in some\nextended sense, causal. The kairetic model makes this latter claim, as\ndo many advocates of mechanistic models. By contrast, interventionist\nmodels, need not deny that there are non-causal explanations, although\nthe version described below does not attempt to cover such\nexplanations. Finally, we are very conscious that, for reasons of\nspace, we omitted many recent discussions of causal explanation from\nthis entry. We provide brief references to a number of these at the\nend of this article (Section 6).\n", "toc": [{"#MechMechExpl": "1. Mechanisms and Mechanistic Explanations "}, {"#KairAccoExpl": "2.

Mechanisms and Mechanistic Explanations\n\nMany accounts of causation and explanation assign a central importance\nto the notion of mechanism. While discussions of mechanism are present\nin the early modern period, with the work of Descartes and others, a\ndistinct and very influential research program emerged with the\n\u201cnew mechanist\u201d approaches of the late twentieth and early\ntwenty-first century. This section focuses on work in this\ntradition.\n\nWesley Salmon\u2019s causal mechanical (CM) model of explanation\n(Salmon 1984) was an influential late twentieth century precursor to\nthe work on mechanisms that followed. The CM model is described in the\nSEP entry on\n scientific explanation\n and readers are referred to this for details. For present purposes we\njust note the following. First, Salmon\u2019s model is proposed as an\nalternative to the deductive-nomological (DN) model and the \u201cnew\nmechanist\u201d work that follows also rejects the DN model, although\nin some cases for reasons somewhat different from Salmon\u2019s. Like\nthe CM model and in contrast to the DN model, the new mechanist\ntradition downplays the role of laws in explanation, in part because\n(it is thought) there are relatively few laws in the life sciences,\nwhich are the primary domain of application of recent work on\nmechanisms. Second, although Salmon provides an account of causal\nrelationships that are in an obvious sense \u201cmechanical\u201d,\nhe focuses virtually entirely on physical examples (like billiard ball\ncollisions) rather than examples from the life sciences. Third Salmon\npresents his model as an \u201contic\u201d account of explanation,\naccording to which explanations are things or structures in the world\nand contrasts this with what he regarded as \u201cepistemic\u201d\naccounts of explanation (including in his view, the DN model) which\ninstead conceive of explanations as representations of what is in the\nworld (Salmon 1984). This \u201contic\u201d orientation has been\nimportant in the work of some of the new mechanists, such as Craver\n(2007a), but less so for others. Finally, Salmon\u2019s model\nintroduces a distinction between the \u201cetiological\u201d aspects\nof explanation which have to do with tracing the causal history of\nsome event E and the \u201cconstitutive\u201d aspects which\nhave to do with \u201cthe internal causal mechanisms that account for\nE\u2019s nature\u201d (Salmon 1984: 275). This focus on the\nrole of \u201cconstitution\u201d is retained by a number of the new\nmechanists.\n\nWe may think of the \u201cnew mechanism\u201d research program\nproperly speaking as initiated by writers like Bechtel and Richardson\n(1993 [2010]), Glennan (1996, 1997), and Machamer, Darden, and Craver\n(2000). Although these writers provide accounts that differ in\n detail,[1]\n they share common elements: mechanisms are understood as causal\nsystems, exhibiting a characteristic organization, with multiple\ncausal factors that work together in a coordinated manner to produce\nsome effect of interest. Providing a mechanistic explanation involves\nexplaining an outcome by appealing to the causal mechanism that\nproduces it. The components of a mechanism stand in causal\nrelationships but most accounts conceptualize the relationship between\nthese components and the mechanism itself as a part-whole or\n\u201cconstitutive relationship\u201d \u2013 e.g., a human cell is constituted\nby various molecules, compounds and organelles, the human visual\nsystem is constituted by various visual processing areas (including\nV1\u2013V5) and an automobile engine may be constituted by pistons,\ncylinders, camshaft and carburetor, among other components. Such\npart/whole relations are generally conceptualized as non-causal\n\u2013 that is, constitution is seen as a non-causal relationship.\nThus, on these accounts, mechanisms are composed of or constituted by\nlower-level causal parts that interact together to produce the\nhigher-level behavior of the (whole) mechanism understood as some\neffect of interest. This part-whole picture gives mechanistic\nexplanation a partially reductive character, in the sense that\nhigher-level outcomes characterizing the whole mechanism are explained\nby the lower-level causes that produce them. In many accounts this is\ndepicted in nested, hierarchical diagrams describing these relations\nbetween levels of mechanisms (Craver 2007a).\n\nAlthough philosophical discussion has often focused on the role of\nconstitutive relations in mechanisms and how best to understand these,\nit is, as noted above, also common to think of mechanism as consisting\nof factors or components that stand in causal\n(\u201cetiological\u201d) relations to one another with accompanying\ncharacteristic spatial, temporal or geometrical organization. This\nfeature of mechanism and mechanistic explanation is emphasized by\nIllari and Williamson (2010, 2012) and Woodward (2002, 2013). In\nparticular, elucidating a mechanism is often understood as involving\nthe identification of \u201cmediating\u201d factors that are\n\u201cbetween\u201d the input to the mechanism and its eventual\noutput \u2013 \u201cbetween\u201d both in the sense of causally\nbetween and in the sense that the operation of these mediating factors\noften can be thought of as spatially and temporally between the input\nto the mechanism and its output. (The causal structure and the\nspatiotemporal structure thus \u201cmirror\u201d or run parallel to\neach other.) Often this information about intermediates can be thought\nof as describing the \u201csteps\u201d by which the mechanism\noperates over time. For example, mechanistic explanations of the\naction potential will cite the (anatomical) structure of the neural\ncell membrane, the relative location and structure of ion channels (in\nthis membrane), ion types on either side of this membrane, and the\nvarious temporal steps in the opening and closing of ion channels that\ngenerate the action potential. A step-by-step description of this\nmechanism cites all of these parts and their interactions from the\nbeginning of the causal process to the end. In this respect a\ndescription of a mechanism will provide more detail than, say,\ndirected acyclic graphs which describe causal relations among\nvariables but do not provide spatio-temporal or geometrical\ninformation.\n\nA hotly debated issue in the literature on mechanisms concerns the\namount of detail descriptions of mechanisms or mechanistic\nexplanations need to contain. While some mechanists suggest that\nmechanisms (or their descriptions) can be abstract or lacking in\ndetail (Levy & Bechtel 2012), it is more commonly claimed that\nmechanistic explanations must contain significant detail \u2013\nperhaps as much \u201crelevant\u201d detail as possible or at least\nthat this should be so for an \u201cideally complete\ndescription\u201d of a mechanism (see Craver 2006 and the discussion\nin\n Section 4).\n Thus, a mere description of an input-output causal relation, even if\ncorrect, lacks sufficient detail to count as a description of a\nmechanism. For example, a randomized control trial can support the\nclaim that drug X causes recovery Y, but this alone\ndoesn\u2019t elucidate the \u201cmechanism of action\u201d of the\ndrug. Craver (2007a: 113\u20134) goes further, suggesting that even\nmodels that provide substantial information about anatomical\nstructures and causal intermediaries are deficient qua\nmechanistic explanations if they omit detail thought to be relevant.\nFor example, the original Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the action\npotential identified a role for the opening and closing of membrane\nchannels but did not specify the molecular mechanisms involved in the\nopening and closing of those channels. Craver (2006, 2007a, 2008)\ntakes this to show that the HH model is explanatorily deficient\n\u2013 it is a \u201cmechanism sketch\u201d rather than a fully\nsatisfactory mechanistic explanation. (This is echoed by Glennan who\nstates that the monocausal model of disease \u2013 a one cause-one\neffect relationship \u2013 is \u201cthe sketchiest of mechanism\nsketches\u201d [Glennan 2017: 226].) This \u201cthe more relevant\ndetail the better\u201d view has in turn been criticized by those who\nthink that one can sometimes improve the quality of an explanation or\nat least make it no worse by omitting detail. For such criticism see,\ne.g., Batterman and Rice (2014), Levy (2014), Chirimuuta (2014), Ross\n(2015, 2020), etc. and for a response see by Craver and Kaplan\n (2020).[2]\n\nThe new mechanists differ among themselves in their views of causation\nand their attitudes toward general theories of causation found in the\nphilosophical literature. Since a mechanism involves components\nstanding in causal relations, one might think that a satisfactory\ntreatment of mechanisms should include an account of what is meant by\n\u201ccausal relations\u201d. Some mechanists have attempted to\nprovide such an account. For example, Craver (2007a) appeals to\nelements of Woodward\u2019s interventionist account of causation in\nthis connection and for other purposes \u2013 e.g., to provide an\naccount of constitutive relevance (Craver 2007b). By contrast, Glennan\n(1996, 2017) argues that the notion of mechanism is more fundamental\nthan that of causation and that the former can be used to elucidate\nthe latter \u2013 roughly, X causes Y when there is\na mechanism connecting X to Y. Of course, for\nGlennan\u2019s project this requires that mechanism is elucidated in\na way that doesn\u2019t appeal to the notion causation. Yet another\nview, inspired by Anscombe (1971) and advocated by Machamer, Darden,\nand Craver (MDC) (2000), Machamer (2004) and others, eschews any\nappeal to general theories of causation and instead describes the\ncausal features of mechanism in terms of specific causal verbs. For\nexample, according to MDC, mechanisms involve entities that engage in\n\u201cactivities\u201d, with examples of the latter including\n\u201cattraction\u201d, \u201crepulsion\u201d,\n\u201cpushing\u201d and so on (MDC 2000: 5). It is contended that no\nmore general account according to which these are instances of some\ncommon genus (causation) is likely to be illuminating. A detailed\nevaluation of this claim is beyond the scope of this entry, but we do\nwish to note that relatively general theories of causation that go\nbeyond the cataloging of particular causal activities now flourish not\njust in philosophy but in disciplines like computer science and\nstatistics (Pearl 2000 [2009]; Morgan & Winship, 2014) where they\nare often thought to provide scientific and mathematical\nillumination.\n\nAnother issue raised by mechanistic accounts concerns their scope. As\nwe have seen these accounts were originally devised to capture a form\nof explanation thought to be widespread in the life sciences. This\naspiration raises several questions. First, are all explanations in\nthe life sciences \u201cmechanistic\u201d in the sense captured by\nsome model of mechanistic explanation? Many new mechanists have\nanswered this question in the affirmative but there has been\nconsiderable pushback to this claim, with other philosophers claiming\nthat there are explanations in the life sciences that appeal to\ntopological or network features (Lange 2013; Huneman 2010; Rathkopf\n2018; Kosti\u0107 2020; Ross 2021b), to dynamical systems models (Ross\n2015) and to other features deemed \u201cnon-mechanical\u201d as\nwith computational models in neuroscience (Chirimuuta 2014, 2018).\nThis debate raises the question of how broadly it is appropriate to\nextend the notion of \u201cmechanism\u201d (Silberstein &\nChemero 2013).\n\nWhile the examples above are generally claimed to be non-causal and\nnon-mechanistic, a further question is whether there are also types of\ncausal explanation that are non-mechanistic. Answering this\nquestion depends, in part, on how \u201cmechanism\u201d is defined\nand what types of causal structures count as \u201cmechanisms\u201d.\nIf mechanisms have the particular features mentioned above \u2013\npart-whole relationships, some significant detail, and mechanical\ninteractions \u2013 it would seem clear that some causal explanations\nare non-mechanistic in the sense that they cite causal systems and\ninformation with different features. For example, causal systems\nincluding pathways, networks, and cascades have been advanced as\nimportant types of causal structures that do not meet standard\nmechanism characteristics (Ross 2018, 2021a, forthcoming). Other\nexamples include complex causal processes that lack machine-like and\nfixed causal parts (Dupr\u00e9 2013). This work often questions\nwhether \u201cmechanism\u201d fruitfully captures the diversity of\ncausal structures and causal explanations that are present in\nscientific contexts.\n\nThere is an understandable tendency among mechanists to attempt to\nextend the scope of their accounts as far as possible but presumably\nthe point of the original project was that mechanistic explanations\nhave some distinctive features. Extending the models too far\nmay lead to loss of sight of these. The problem is compounded by the\nfact that \u201cmechanism\u201d is used in many areas of science as\ngeneral term of valorization or approval, as is arguably the case for\ntalk of the \u201cmechanism\u201d of natural selection or of\n\u201cexternalizing tendencies\u201d as a \u201cmechanism\u201d\nleading to substance abuse. The question is whether these candidates\nfor mechanisms have enough in common with, say, the mechanism by which\nthe action potential is produced to warrant the treatment of both by\nsome common model. Of course, this problem also arises when one\nconsiders the extent to which talk of mechanisms is appropriate\noutside of the life sciences. Chemists talk of mechanisms of reaction,\nphysicists of the Higgs mechanism, and economists of mechanism design,\nbut again this raises the question of whether an account of\nmechanistic explanation should aspire to cover all of these.\n2. The Kairetic Account of Explanation\n\nThis account is developed by Michael Strevens in his Depth\n(2008) and in a number of papers (2004, 2013, 2018). Strevens\ndescribes his theory as a \u201ctwo factor\u201d account (Strevens\n2008: 4). The first factor \u2013 Strevens\u2019 starting point\n\u2013 is the notion of causation or dependence (Strevens calls it\n\u201ccausal influence\u201d) that figures in fundamental physics.\nStrevens is ecumenical about what this involves. He holds that a\nnumber of different philosophical treatments of causal influence\n\u2013 conserved quantity, counterfactual or interventionist \u2013\nwill fit his purposes. This notion of causal influence is then used as\ninput to an account of causal explanation \u2013\nStrevens\u2019 second factor. A causal explanation of an individual\nevent e (Strevens\u2019 starting point) assembles all and\nonly those causal influences that make a difference to (are\nexplanatorily relevant to) e. A key idea here is the notion of\ncausal entailment (Strevens 2008:\n 74).[3]\n A set of premises that causally entail that e occurs\ndeductively entail this claim and do this in a way that\n\u201cmirrors\u201d the causal influences (ascertained from the\nfirst stage) leading to e. This notion of mirroring is\nlargely left at an intuitive level but as an illustration a derivation\nof an effect from premises describing the cause mirrors the causal\ninfluences leading to the effect while the reverse derivation from\neffect to cause does not. However, more than mirroring is required for\ncausal explanation: The premises in a causal entailment of the sort\njust described are subjected to a process (a kind of\n\u201cabstraction\u201d) in which premises that are not necessary\nfor the entailment of e are removed or replaced with weaker\nalternatives that are still sufficient to entail e \u2013\nthe result of this being to identify factors which are genuinely\ndifference-makers or explanatorily relevant to e. The result\nis what Strevens calls a \u201cstand-alone\u201d explanation for\ne (Strevens 2008: 70). (Explanatory relevance or\ndifference-making is thus understood in terms of what, so to speak, is\nminimally required for causal entailment, constrained by a\ncohesiveness requirement described below, rather than, as in some\nother models of explanation, in terms of counterfactuals or\nstatistical relevance.) As an illustration, if the event e is\nthe shattering of a window the causal influences on e,\nidentified from fundamental physics, will be extremely detailed and\nwill consist of influences that affect fine grained features of\ne\u2019s occurrence, having to do, e.g., with exactly how\nthe window shatters. But to the extent that the explanandum is just\nwhether e occurs most of those details will be irrelevant in\nthe sense that they will affect only the details of how the shattering\noccurs and not whether it occurs at all. Dropping these details will\nresult in a derivation that still causally entails e. The causal\nexplanation of e is what remains after all such details have\nbeen dropped and only what is necessary for the causal entailment of\ne is retained.\n\nAs Strevens is fully aware, this account faces the following apparent\ndifficulty. There are a number of different causal scenarios that\nrealize causes of bottle shatterings \u2013 the impact of rocks but\nalso, say, sonic booms (cf. Hall 2012). In Strevens\u2019 view, we\nshould not countenance causal explanations that disjoin causal models\nthat describe such highly different realizers, even though weakening\nderivations via the inclusion of such disjunctions may preserve causal\nentailment. Strevens\u2019 solution appeals to the notion of\ncohesion; when different processes serve as\n\u201crealizers\u201d for the causes of e, these must be\n\u201ccohesive\u201d in the sense that they are \u201ccausally\ncontiguous\u201d from the point of view of the underlying physics.\nRoughly, contiguous causal processes are those that are nearby or\nneighbors to one another in a space provided by fundamental\n physics.[4]\n Sonic booms and rock impacts do not satisfy this cohesiveness\nrequirement and hence models involving them as disjunctive premises\nare excluded. Fundamental physics is thus the arbitrator of whether\nupper-level properties with different realizers are sufficiently\nsimilar to satisfy the cohesion requirement. Or at least this is so\nfor deep \u201cstand alone\u201d explanations in contrast to those\nexplanations that are \u201cframework\u201d dependent (see\nbelow).\n\nAs Strevens sees it, a virtue of his account is that it separates\ndifficult (\u201cmetaphysical\u201d) questions about the nature of\nthe causal relationships (at least as these are found in physics which\nis Strevens\u2019 starting point) from issues about causal\nexplanation, which are the main focus of the kairetic account. It also\nfollows that most of the causal claims that we consider in common\nsense and in science (outside of fundamental physics) are in fact\nclaims about causal explanation and explanatory relevance as\ndetermined by the kairetic abstraction procedure rather than claims\nabout causation per se. In effect when one claims that \u201caspirin\ncauses headache relief\u201d one is making a rather complicated\ncausal explanatory claim about the upshot of the application of the\nabstraction procedure to the causal claims that, properly speaking,\nare provided by physics. This contrasts with an account in which\ncausal claims outside of physics are largely univocal with causal\nclaims (assuming that there are such) within physics.\n\nWe noted above that Strevens imposes a cohesiveness requirement on his\nabstraction procedure. This seems to have the consequence that\nupper-level causal generalizations that have realizers that are rather\ndisparate from the point of view of the underlying physics are\ndefective qua explainers, even though there are many examples\nof such generalizations that (rightly or wrongly) are regarded as\nexplanatory. Strevens addresses this difficulty by introducing the\nnotion of a framework \u2013 roughly a set of\npresuppositions for an explanation. When scientists\n\u201cframework\u201d some aspect of a causal story, they put that\naspect aside (it is presupposed rather an explicit part of the\nexplanation) and focus on getting the story right for the part that\nremains. A common example is to framework details of implementation,\nin effect black-boxing the low-level causal explanation of why certain\nparts of a system behave in the way they do. The resulting explanation\nsimply presupposes that these parts do what they do, without\nattempting to explain why. Consequently, the black boxes in such\nexplanations are not subject to the cohesion requirement, because they\nare not the locus of explanatory attention . Thus although\nexplanations appealing to premises with disparate realizers are\ndefective when considered by themselves as stand-alone explanations,\nwe may regard such explanations as dependent on a framework with the\nframework incorporating information about a presupposed mechanism that\nsatisfies the coherence\n constraint.[5]\n When this is the case, the explanation will be acceptable\nqua frameworked explanation. Nonetheless in such cases the\nexplanation should in principle be deepened by making explicit the\ninformation presupposed in the framework.\n\nStrevens describes his account as \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather\nthan \u201cnormative\u201d in aspiration. Presumably, however, it is\nnot intended as a description of the bases on which lay people or\nscientists come to accept causal explanations outside of fundamental\nphysics \u2013 people don\u2019t actually go through the abstraction\nfrom fundamental physics process that Strevens describes when they\narrive at or reason about upper-level causal explanations. Instead, as\nwe understand his account, it is intended to characterize something\nlike what must be the case from the point of view of fundamental\nphysics for upper-level causal judgments to be explanatory \u2013 the\nexplanatory upper-level claims must fit with physics in the right way\nas specified in Strevens\u2019 abstraction procedure and the\naccompanying cohesiveness\n constraint.[6]\n Perhaps then the account is intended to be descriptive in the sense\nthat the upper-level causal explanations people regard as satisfactory\ndo in fact satisfy the constraints he describes. In addition, the\naccount is intended to be descriptive in the sense that it contends\nthat as a matter of empirical fact people regard their explanations as\ncommitted to various claims about the underlying physics even if these\nclaims are presently unknown \u2013 e.g., to claims about the\ncohesiveness of these\n realizers.[7]\n At the same time the kairetic account is also normative in the sense\nthat it judges that explanations that fail to satisfy the constraints\nof the abstraction procedure are in some way unsatisfactory \u2013\nthus people are correct to have the commitments described above.\n\nDepth also contains an interesting treatment of the role of\nidealizations in explanation. It is often thought that idealizations\ninvolve the presence of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d, or\n\u201cdistortions\u201d. Strevens claims that these\n\u201cfalse\u201d features involve claims that do not have to do\nwith difference-makers, in the sense captured by the abstraction\nprocedure. Thus, according to the kairetic model, it does not matter\nif idealizations involve falsehoods or if they omit certain\ninformation since the falsehoods or omitted information do not concern\ndifference-makers \u2013 their presence thus does not detract from\nthe resulting explanation. Moreover, we can think of idealizations as\nconveying useful information about which factors are not\ndifference-makers.\n\nThe kairetic account covers a great deal more that we lack the space\nto discuss including treatments of what Strevens calls\n\u201centanglement\u201d, equilibrium explanations, statistical\nexplanation and much else.\n\nAs is always the case with ambitious theories in philosophy, there\nhave been a number of criticisms of the kairetic model. Here we\nmention just two. First, the kairetic model assumes that all\nlegitimate explanation is causal or at least that all explanation must\nin some way reference or connect with causal information. (A good deal\nof the discussion in Depth is concerned to show that\nexplanations that might seem to be non-causal can nonetheless be\nregarded as working by conveying causal information.) This claim that\nall explanation is causal is by no means an implausible idea \u2013\nuntil recently it was widely assumed in the literature on explanation\n(Skow 2014). Nonetheless this idea has recently been challenged by a\nnumber of philosophers (Baker 2005; Batterman 2000, 2002, 2010a; Lange\n2013, 2016; Lyon 2012; Pincock 2007). Relatedly, the kairetic account\nassumes that fundamental physics is \u201ccausal\u201d \u2013\nphysics describes causal relations, and indeed lots of causal\nrelations, enough to generate a large range of upper-level causal\nexplanations when the abstraction procedure is applied. Some hold\ninstead that the dependence relations described in physics are either\nnot causal at all (causation being a notion that applies only to\nupper-level or macroscopic relationships) or else that these\ndependence relations lack certain important features (such as\nasymmetry) that are apparently present in causal explanatory claims\noutside of physics (Ney 2009, 2016). These claims about the absence of\ncausation in physics are controversial but if correct, it follows that\nphysics does not provide the input that Strevens\u2019 account\n needs.[8]\n\nA second set of issues concern the kairetic abstraction process. Here\nthere are several worries. First, the constraints on this process have\nstruck some as vague since they involve judgments of cohesiveness of\nrealizers from the point of view of underlying physics. Does physics\nor any other science really provide a principled, objective basis for\nsuch judgments? Second, it seems, as suggested above, that upper-level\ncausal explanations often generalize over realizers that are very\ndisparate from the point of view of the underlying physics. Potochnik\n(2011, 2017) focuses on the example, also discussed by Strevens, of\nthe Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations which are applied to a large variety\nof different organisms that stand in predator/prey relations. Strevens\nuses his ideas about frameworks to argue that use of the LV equations\nis in some sense justifiable, but it also appears to be a consequence\nof his account (and Strevens seems to agree) that explanations\nappealing to the LV equations are not very deep, considered as\nstandalone explanations. But, at least as a descriptive matter,\nPotochnik claims, this does not seem to correspond to the judgments or\npractices of the scientists using these equations, who seem happy to\nuse the LV equations despite the fact that they fail to satisfy the\ncausal contiguity requirement. Potochnik thus challenges this portion\nof the descriptive adequacy of Strevens\u2019 account. Of course, one\nmight respond that these scientists ought to judge in accord\nwith Strevens\u2019 account, but as noted above, this involves taking\nthe account to have normative implications and not as merely\ndescriptive.\n\nA more general form of this issue arises in connection with\n\u201cuniversal\u201d behavior (Batterman 2002). There are a number\nof cases in which physical and biological systems that are very\ndifferent from one another in terms of their low-level realizers\nexhibit similar or identical upper-level behavior (Batterman 2002;\nBatterman & Rice 2014; Ross 2015). As a well-known example,\nsubstances as diverse as ferromagnets and various liquid/gas systems\nexhibit similar behavior around their critical points (Batterman 2000,\n2002). Renormalization techniques are often thought to explain this\ncommonality in behavior, but they do so precisely by showing that the\nphysical details of these systems do not matter for (are irrelevant\nto) the aspects of their upper-level behavior of interest. The\nfeatures of these systems that are relevant to their behavior have to\ndo with their dimensionality and symmetry properties among others and\nthis is revealed by the renormalization group analysis (RGA)\n(Batterman 2010b). One interesting question is whether we can think of\nthat analysis as an instance of Strevens\u2019 kairetic procedure. On\nthe one hand the RGA can certainly be viewed as an abstraction\nprocedure that discards non-difference-making factors. On the other\nhand, it is perhaps not so clear the RGA respects the cohesiveness\nrequirements that Strevens proposes since the upshot is that systems\nthat are very different at the level of fundamental physics are given\na common explanation. That is, the RGA does not seem to work by\nshowing (at least in any obvious way) that the systems to which it\napplies are contiguous with respect to the underlying\n physics.[9]\n\nAnother related issue is this: a number of philosophers claim that the\nRGA provides a non-causal explanation (Batterman 2002, 2010a;\nReutlinger 2014). As we have seen, Strevens denies that there are\nnon-causal explanations in his extended sense of \u201ccausal\u201d\nbut, in addition, if it is thought the RGA implements Strevens\u2019\nabstraction procedure, this raises the question of whether (contrary\nto Strevens\u2019 expectations) this procedure can take causal\ninformation as input and yield a non-causal explanation as output. A\ncontrary view, which may be Strevens\u2019, is that as long as the\nexplanation is the result of applying the kairetic procedure to causal\ninput, that result must be causal.\n\nThe issue that we have been addressing so far has to do with whether\ncausal contiguity is a defensible requirement to impose on upper-level\nexplanations. There is also a related question \u2013 assuming that\nthe requirement is defensible, how can we tell whether it is\nsatisfied? The contiguity requirement as well as the whole abstraction\nprocedure with which it is associated is characterized with reference\nto fundamental physics but, as we have noted, users of upper-level\nexplanations usually have little or no knowledge of how to connect\nthese with the underlying physics. If Strevens\u2019 model is to be\napplicable to the assessment of upper-level explanations it must be\npossible to tell, from the vantage point of those explanations and the\navailable information that surrounds their use, whether they satisfy\nthe contiguity and other requirements but without knowing in detail\nhow they connect to the underlying physics. Strevens clearly thinks\nthis is possible (as he should, given his views) and in some cases\nthis seems plausible. For example, it seems fairly plausible, as we\ntake Strevens to assume, that predator/prey pairs consisting of lions\nand zebras are disparate from pairs consisting of spiders and house\nflies from the point of view of the underlying physics and thus\nconstitute heterogeneous realizers of the LV\n equations.[10]\n On the other hand, in a case of pre-emption in which Billy\u2019s\nrock shatters a bottle very shortly before Suzy\u2019s rock arrives\nat the same space, Strevens seems committed to the claim that these\ntwo causal processes are non-contiguous \u2013 indeed he needs this\nresult to avoid counting Suzy\u2019s throw as a cause of the\n shattering[11]\n (Non-contiguity must hold even if the throws involve rocks with the\nsame mass and velocity following very similar trajectories, differing\nonly slightly in their timing.) In other examples, Strevens claims\nthat airfoils of different flexibility and different materials satisfy\nthe contiguity constraint, as do different molecular scattering\nprocesses in gases \u2013 apparently this is so even if the latter\nare governed by rather different potential functions (as they\nsometimes are) (Strevens 2008: 165\u20136). The issue here is not\nthat these judgments are obviously wrong but rather that one would\nlike to have a more systematic and principled story about the basis on\nwhich they are to be made.\n\nThat said, we think that Strevens has put his finger on an important\nissue that deserves more philosophical attention. This is that there\nis something explanatorily puzzling or incomplete about a stable\nupper-level generalization that appears to have very disparate\nrealizers: one naturally wants a further explanation of how this comes\nabout \u2013 one that does not leave it as a kind of unexplained\ncoincidence that this uniformity of behavior\n occurs.[12]\n The RGA purports to do this for certain aspects of behavior around\ncritical points and it does not seem unreasonable to hope for accounts\n(perhaps involving some apparatus very different from the RGA) for\nother cases. What is less clear is whether such an explanation will\nalways appeal to causal contiguity at the level of fundamental physics\n\u2013 for example in the case of the RGA the relevant factors (and\nwhere causal contiguity appears to obtain) are relatively abstract and\nhigh-level, although certainly \u201cphysical\u201d.\n3. Interventionist Theories\n\nInterventionist theories are intended both as theories of causation\nand of causal explanation. Here we provide only a very quick overview\nof the former, referring readers to the entry\n causation and manipulability\n for more detailed discussion of the former and instead focus on\ncausal explanation. Consider a causal claim (generalization) of the\nform\n\n(G)\n\u201cC causes E\u201d\n\n\nwhere \u201cC\u201d and \u201cE\u201d are\nvariables \u2013 that is, they refer to properties or quantities that\ncan take at least two values. Examples are \u201cforces cause\naccelerations\u201d and \u201cSmoking causes lung cancer\u201d.\nAccording to interventionist accounts (G) is true if and only if there\nis a possible intervention I such that if I were to\nchange the value of C, the value of E or the\nprobability distribution of E would change (Woodward 2003).\nThe notion of an intervention is described in more detail in the\n causation and manipulability\n entry, but the basic idea is that this is an unconfounded\nexperimental manipulation of C that changes E, if at\nall, via a route that goes through C and not in any other\nway. Counterfactuals that describe would happen if an intervention\nwere to be performed are called interventionist\ncounterfactuals. A randomized experiment provides one paradigm of\nan intervention.\n\nCausal explanations can take several different forms within an\ninterventionist\n framework[13]\n \u2013 for instance, a causal explanation of some explanandum \\(E\n=e\\) requires:\n\n(3.1)\nSpecification of a true causal generalization \\(E= f(C)\\) \u2013\nthat is, some set of values of \\(C\\) is mapped into values of \\(E\\) by\n\\(f\\) \u2013 meeting the interventionist criterion for causation\ndescribed above,\n\n\nas well as\n\n(3.2)\nOne or more initial conditions \\(C=c\\) (\\(C\\) being the\nindependent variable or variables that figure in\n (3.1))\n such that \\(E\\) is derivable from (3.1) and\n (3.2)\n\n\nand also meeting the condition\n\n(3.3)\nWhen combined with other initial conditions\n (3.1)\n tells us how the value e of E would change under\nchanges in the initial conditions in specified in\n (3.2).\n\n\nBy meeting these conditions (and especially in virtue of satisfying\n(3.3)) an explanation answers what Woodward (2003) calls\n\u201cwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions\u201d\n(w-questions) about E \u2013 it tells us how E\nwould have been different under changes in the values of the\nC variable from the value specified in (3.2).\n\nAs an example, consider an explanation of why the strength (E) of the\nelectrical field created by a long straight wire along which the\ncharge is uniformly distributed is described by \\(E= \\lambda/2 \\pi r\n\\epsilon_{o}\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) is the charge density and \\(r\\) is\nthe distance from the wire. An explanation of this can be constructed\nby appealing to Coulomb\u2019s law (playing the role of\n (3.1)\n above) in conjunction with information about the shape of the wire\nand the charge distribution along it\n ((3.2)\n above). This information allows for the derivation of \\(E= \\lambda/2\n\\pi r \\epsilon_{o}\\) but it also can be used to provide answers to a\nnumber of other w-questions. For example, Coulomb\u2019s law and a\nsimilar modeling strategy can be used to answer questions about what\nthe field would be if the wire had a different shape (e.g., if twisted\nto form a loop) or if it was somehow flattened into a plane or\ndeformed into a sphere.\n\nThe condition that the explanans answer a range of w-questions is\nintended to capture the requirement that the explanans must be\nexplanatorily relevant to the explanandum. That is, factors having to\ndo with the charge density and the shape of the conductor are\nexplanatorily relevant to the field intensity because changes in these\nfactors would lead to changes in the field intensity. Other factors\nsuch as the color of the conductor are irrelevant and should be\nomitted from the explanation because changes in them will not lead to\nchanges in the field intensity. As an additional illustration,\nconsider Salmon\u2019s (1971a: 34) example of a purported explanation\nof (F) a male\u2019s failure to get pregnant that appeals to\nhis taking birth control pills (B). Intuitively (B)\nis explanatorily irrelevant to (F). The interventionist model\ncaptures this by observing that B fails to satisfy the\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different requirement with respect to\nF: F would not change if B were to change.\n(Note the contrast with the rather different way in which the kairetic\nmodel captures explanatory relevance.)\n\nAnother key idea of the interventionist model is the notion of\ninvariance of a causal generalization (Woodward &\nHitchcock 2003). Consider again a generalization (G) relating \\(C\\) to\n\\(E\\), \\(E= f(C)\\). As we have seen, for (G) to describe a causal\nrelationship at all it must at least be the case that (G) correctly\ntells how E would change under at least some interventions on\nC. However, causal generalizations can vary according to the\nrange of interventions over which this is true. It might be that (G)\ncorrectly describes how E would change under some substantial\nrange R of interventions that set C to different\nvalues or this might instead be true only for some restricted range of\ninterventions on C. The interventions on C over\nwhich (G) continues to hold are the interventions over which (G) is\ninvariant. As an illustration consider a type of spring for\nwhich the restoring force F under extensions X is\ncorrectly described by Hooke\u2019s law:\n\n(3.4)\n\\(F=-kX\\)\n\n\nfor some range R of interventions on X. Extending\nthe spring too much will cause it to break so that its behavior will\nno longer be described by Hooke\u2019s law.\n (3.4)\n is invariant under interventions in R but not so for\ninterventions outside of R. (3.4) is, intuitively, invariant\nonly under a somewhat narrow range of interventions. Contrast (3.4)\nwith the gravitational inverse square law:\n\n(3.5)\n\\(F= Gm_{1}m_{2}/r^{2}\\).\n\n\n(3.5)\n is invariant under a rather wide range of interventions that set\n\\(m_1,\\) \\(m_2,\\) and \\(r\\) to different values but there are also\nvalues for these variables for which (3.5) fails to hold \u2013 e.g.,\nvalues at which general relativistic effects become important.\nMoreover, invariance under interventions is just one variety of\ninvariance. One may also talk about the invariance of a generalization\nunder many other sorts of changes \u2013 for example, changes in\nbackground conditions, understood as conditions that are not\nexplicitly included in the generalization itself. As an illustration,\nthe causal connection between smoking and lung cancer holds for\nsubjects with different diets, in different environmental conditions,\nwith different demographic characteristics and so\n on.[14]\n However, as explained below, it is invariance under interventions\nthat is most crucial to evaluating whether an explanation is good or\ndeep within the interventionist framework.\n\nGiven the account of causal explanation above it follows that for a\ngeneralization to figure in a causal explanation it must be invariant\nunder at least some interventions. As a general rule a generalization\nthat is invariant under a wider range of interventions and other\nchanges will be such that it can be used to answer a wider range of\nw-questions. (See\n section 4\n below.) In this respect such a generalization might be regarded as\nhaving superior explanatory credentials \u2013 it at least explains\nmore than generalizations with a narrower range of invariance.\nGeneralizations that are invariant under a very wide range of\ninterventions and that have the sort of mathematical formulation that\nallows for precise predictions are those that we tend to regard as\nlaws of nature. Generalizations that have a narrower range of\ninvariance like Hooke\u2019s \u201claw\u201d capture causal\ninformation but are not plausible candidates for laws of nature. An\ninterventionist model of form\n (3.1\u20133.3)\n above thus requires generalizations with some degree of invariance or\nrelationships that support interventionist counterfactuals, but it\ndoes not require laws. In this respect, like the other models\nconsidered in this entry, it departs from the DN model which does\nrequire laws for successful explanation (see the entry on\n scientific explanation).\n\nTurning now to criticisms of the interventionist model, some of these\nare also criticisms of interventionist accounts of causation. Several\nof these (and particularly the delicate question of what it means for\nan intervention to be \u201cpossible\u201d) are addressed if not\nresolved in the\n causation and manipulability\n entry.\n\nAnother criticism, not addressed in the above entry, concerns the\n\u201ctruth makers\u201d or \u201cgrounds\u201d for the\ninterventionist counterfactuals that figure in causal explanation.\nMany philosophers hold that it is necessary to provide a metaphysical\naccount of some kind for these. There are a variety of different\nproposals \u2013 perhaps interventionist counterfactuals or causal\nclaims more generally are made true by \u201cpowers\u201d or\n\u201cdispositions\u201d. Perhaps instead such counterfactuals are\ngrounded in laws of nature, with the latter being understood in terms\nof some metaphysical framework, as in the Best Systems Analysis. For\nthe most part interventionists, have declined to provide truth\nconditions of this sort and this has struck some metaphysically minded\nphilosophers as a serious omission. One response is that while it\ncertainly makes sense to ask for deeper explanations of why various\ninterventionist counterfactuals hold, the only explanation that is\nneeded is an ordinary scientific explanation in terms of some deeper\ntheory, rather than any kind of distinctively\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d explanation (Woodward 2017b). For example,\none might explain why the interventionist counterfactual \u201cif I\nwere to drop this bottle it will fall to the ground\u201d is true by\nappealing to Newtonian gravitational theory and\n\u201cgrounding\u201d it in this way. (There is also the task of\nproviding a semantics for interventionist counterfactuals and here\nthere have been a variety of proposals \u2013 see, e.g., Briggs 2012.\nBut again, this needn\u2019t take the form of providing metaphysical\ngrounding.) This response raises the question of whether in addition\nto ordinary scientific explanations there are metaphysical\nexplanations (of counterfactuals, laws and so on) that it is the task\nof philosophy to provide \u2013 a very large topic that is beyond the\nscope of this entry.\n\nYet another criticism (pressed by Franklin-Hall 2016 and Weslake 2010)\nis that the w-condition implies that explanations at the lowest level\nof detail are always superior to explanations employing upper-level\nvariables \u2013 the argument being that lower-level explanations\nwill always answer more w-questions than upper-level explanations.\n(But see Woodward (2021) for further discussion.)\n4. Explanatory Depth\n\nPresumably all models of causal explanation (and certainly all of the\nmodels considered above) agree that a causal explanation involves the\nassembly of causal information that is relevant to the explanandum of\ninterest, although different models may disagree about how to\nunderstand causation, causal relevance, and exactly what causal\ninformation is needed for explanation. There is also widespread\nagreement (at least among the models considered above) that causal\nexplanations can differ in how deep or good they are. Capturing what\nis involved in variations in depth is thus an important task for a\ntheory of causal explanation (or for that matter, for any theory of\nexplanation, causal or non-causal). Unsurprisingly different\ntreatments of causal explanation provide different accounts of what\nexplanatory depth consists in. One common idea is that explanations\nthat drill down (provide information) about lower-level realizing\ndetail are (to that extent) better \u2013 this is taken to be one\ndimension of depth even if not the only one.\n\nThis idea is discussed by Sober (1999) in the context of reduction,\nmultiple realizability, and causal explanations in biology. Sober\nsuggests that lower-level details provide objectively superior\nexplanations compared to higher-level ones and he supports this in\nthree main ways. First, he suggests that for any explanatory target,\nlower-level details can always be included without detracting from an\nexplanation. The worst offense committed by this extra detail is that\nit \u201cexplains too much,\u201d while the same cannot be said for\nhigher-level detail (Sober 1999: 547). Second, Sober claims that\nlower-level details do the \u201cwork\u201d in producing\nhigher-level phenomena and that this justifies their privilege or\npriority in explanations. A similar view is expressed by Waters, who\nclaims that higher-level detail, while more general, provides\n\u201cshallow explanations\u201d compared to the \u201cdeeper\naccounts\u201d provided by lower-level detail (1990: 131). A third\nreason is that physics has a kind of \u201ccausal completeness\u201d\nthat other sciences do not have. It is argued that this causal\ncompleteness provides an objective measure of explanatory strength, in\ncontrast to the more \u201csubjective\u201d measures sometimes\ninvoked in defenses of the explanatory credentials of upper\nlevel-sciences. As Sober (1999: 561) puts it,\n\n\nillumination is to some degree in the eye of the beholder; however,\nthe sense in which physics can provide complete explanations is\nsupposed to be perfectly objective.\n\n\nFurthermore,\n\n\nif singular occurrences can be explained by citing their causes, then\nthe causal completeness of physics [ensures] that physics has a\nvariety of explanatory completeness that other sciences do not\npossess. (1999: 562)\n\n\nCases where some type-level effect (e.g., a disease) has a shared\ncausal etiology at higher-levels, but where this etiology is\nmultiply-realized at lower ones present challenges for such views\n(Ross 2020). In Sober\u2019s example, \u201csmoking causes lung\ncancer\u201d is a higher-level (macro) causal relationship. He\nsuggests that lower-level realizers of smoking (distinct carcinogens)\nprovide deeper explanations of this outcome. One problem with this\nclaim is that any single lower-level carcinogen only \u201cmakes a\ndifference to\u201d and explains a narrow subset of all cases of the\ndisease. By contrast, the higher-level causal factor\n\u201csmoking\u201d makes a difference to all (or most) cases\nof this disease. This is reflected in the fact that biomedical\nresearchers and nonexperts appeal to smoking as the cause of lung\ncancer and explicitly target smoking cessation in efforts to control\nand prevent this disease. This suggests that there can be drawbacks to\nincluding too much lower-level detail.\n\nThe kairetic theory also incorporates, in some respects, the idea that\nexplanatory depth is connected to tracking lower-level detail. This is\nreflected in the requirement that deeper explanations are those that\nare cohesive with respect to fundamental physics \u2013 at the very\nleast we will be in a better position to see that this requirement is\nsatisfied when there is supporting information about low-level\n realizers.[15]\n On the other hand, as we have seen, the kairetic abstraction\nprocedure taken in itself pushes away from the inclusion of specific\nlower-level detail in the direction of greater generality which, in\nsome form or other, is also regarded by most as a desirable feature in\nexplanations, the result being a trade-off between these two\ndesiderata. The role of lower-level detail is somewhat different in\nmechanistic models since in typical formulations generality per se is\nnot given independent weight, and depth is associated with the\nprovision of more rather than less relevant detail. Of course a great\ndeal depends on what is meant by \u201crelevant detail\u201d. As\nnoted above, this issue is taken up by Craver in several papers,\nincluding most recently, Craver and Kaplan (2020) who discuss what\nthey call \u201cnorms of completeness\u201d for mechanistic\nexplanations, the idea being that there needs to be some\n\u201cstopping point\u201d at which a mechanistic explanation is\ncomplete in the sense that no further detail needs to be provided.\nClearly, whatever \u201crelevant detail\u201d in this connection\nmeans it cannot mean all factors any variation in which would make a\ndifference to some feature of the phenomenon P which is the\nexplanatory target. After all, in a molecular level explanation of\nsome P, variations at the quantum mechanical level \u2013\nsay in the potential functions governing the behavior of individual\natoms will often make some difference to P, thus requiring\n(on this understanding of relevance) the addition of this information.\nTypically, however, such an explanation is taken by mechanists to be\ncomplete just at the molecular level \u2013 no need to drill down\nfurther. Similarly, from a mechanistic point of view an explanation\nT of the behavior of a gas in terms of thermodynamic\nvariables like pressure and temperature is presumably less than fully\nadequate since the gas laws are regarded by some if not most\nmechanists as merely \u201cphenomenological\u201d and not as\ndescribing a mechanism. A statistical mechanical explanation (SM) of\nthe behavior of the gas is better qua mechanistic explanation\nbut ordinarily such explanations don\u2019t advert to, say, the\ndetails of the potentials (DP) governing molecular interactions, even\nthough variations in these would make some difference to some aspects\nof the behavior of the gas. The problem is thus to describe a norm of\ncompleteness that allows one to say that SM is superior to T\nwithout requiring DP rather than SM. Craver and Kaplan\u2019s\ndiscussion (2020) is complex and we will not try to summarize it\nfurther here except to say that it does try to find this happy medium\nof capturing how a norm of completeness can be met, despite its being\nlegitimate to omit some detail.\n\nA closely related issue is this: fine-grained details can be relevant\nto an explanandum in the sense that variations in those details may\nmake a difference to the explanandum but it can also be the case that\nthose details sometimes can be \u201cscreened off\u201d from or\nrendered conditionally irrelevant to this explanandum (or\napproximately so) by other, more coarse grained variables that provide\nless detail, as described in Woodward 2021. For example, thermodynamic\nvariables can approximately screen off statistical mechanical\nvariables from one another. In such a case is it legitimate to omit\n(do norms about completeness permit omitting) the more fine-grained\ndetails as long as the more coarse-grained but screening off detail is\nincluded?\n\nInterventionist accounts, at least in the form described by Woodward\n(2003), Hitchcock and Woodward (2003) offer a somewhat different\ntreatment of explanatory depth. Some candidate explanations will\nanswer no w-questions and thus fail to be explanatory at all. Above\nthis threshold explanations may differ in degree of goodness or depth,\ndepending on the extent to which they provide more rather than less\ninformation relevant to answering w-questions about the explanandum\n\u2013 and thus more information about what the explanandum depends\non. For example, an explanation of the behavior of a body falling near\nthe earth\u2019s surface in terms of Galileo\u2019s law \\(v=gt\\) is\nless deep than an explanation in terms of the Newtonian law of\ngravitation since the latter makes explicit how the rate of fall\ndepends on the mass of the earth and the distance of the body above\nthe earth\u2019s surface. That is, the Newtonian explanation provides\nanswers to questions about how the velocity of the fall would have\nbeen different if the mass of the earth had been different, if the\nbody was falling some substantial distance away from the earth\u2019s\nsurface and so on, thus answering more w-questions than the\nexplanation appealing to Galileo\u2019s law.\n\nThis account associates generality with explanatory depth but this\nconnection holds only for a particular kind of generality. Consider\nthe conjunction of Galileo\u2019s law and Boyle\u2019s law. In one\nobvious sense, this conjunction is more general than either\nGalileo\u2019s law or Boyle\u2019s law taken alone \u2013 more\nsystems will satisfy either the antecedent of Galileo\u2019s law or\nthe antecedent of Boyle\u2019s law than one of these generalizations\nalone. On the other hand, given an explanandum having to do with the\npressure P exerted by a particular gas, the conjunctive law\nwill tell us no more about what P depends on than\nBoyle\u2019s law by itself does. In other words, the addition of\nGalileo\u2019s law does not allow us to answer any additional\nw-questions about the pressure than are answered by Boyle\u2019s law\nalone. For this reason, this version of interventionism judges that\nthe conjunctive law does not provide a deeper explanation of\nP than Boyle\u2019s law despite the conjunctive law being in\none sense more general (Hitchcock & Woodward 2003).\n\nTo develop this idea in a bit more detail, let us say that the\nscope of a generalization has to do with the number of\ndifferent systems or kinds of systems to which the generalization\napplies (in the sense that the systems satisfy the antecedent and\nconsequents of the generalization). Then the interventionist analysis\nclaims that greater scope per se does not contribute to explanatory\ndepth. The conjunction of Galileo\u2019s and Boyle\u2019s law has\ngreater scope than either law alone, but it does not provide deeper\nexplanations.\n\nAs another, perhaps more controversial, illustration consider a set of\ngeneralizations N1 that successfully explain (by interventionist\ncriteria) the behavior of a kind of neural circuit found only in a\ncertain kind K of animal. Would the explanatory credentials\nof N1 or the depth of the explanations it provides be improved if this\nkind of neural circuit was instead found in many different kinds of\nanimals or if N1 had many more instances? According to the\ninterventionist treatment of depth under consideration, the answer to\nthis question is \u201cno\u201d (Woodward 2003: 367). Such an\nextension of the application of N1 is a mere increase in scope.\nLearning that N1 applies to other kinds of animals does not tell us\nanything more about what the behavior of the original circuit depends\non than if N1 applied just to a single kind of animal.\n\nIt is interesting that philosophical discussions of the explanatory\ncredentials of various generalizations often assume (perhaps tacitly)\nthat greater scope (or even greater potential scope in the sense that\nthere are possible \u2013 perhaps merely metaphysically possible\n\u2013 but not actual systems to which the generalization would\napply) per se contributes to explanatory goodness. For example, Fodor\nand many others argue for the explanatory value of folk psychology on\nthe grounds that its generalizations apply not just to humans but\nwould apply to other systems with the appropriate structure were these\nto exist (perhaps certain AI systems, Martians if appropriately\nsimilar to humans etc.) (Fodor 1981: 8\u20139). The interventionist\ntreatment of depth denies there is any reason to think the explanatory\nvalue of folk psychology would be better in the circumstances imagined\nabove than if it applied only to humans. As another illustration,\nWeslake (2010) argues that upper-level generalizations can provide\nbetter or deeper explanations of the same explananda than lower-level\ngeneralizations if there are physically impossible [but metaphysically\npossible] systems to which the upper-level explanation applies but to\nwhich the lower-level explanation does not (2010: 287), the reason\nbeing that in such cases the upper- level explanation is more general\nin the sense of applying to a wider variety of systems. Suppose for\nexample, that for some systems governed by the laws of thermodynamics,\nthe underlying micro theory is Newtonian mechanics and for other\n\u201cpossible\u201d or actual systems governed by the same\nthermodynamic laws, the correct underlying micro-theory is quite\ndifferent. Then, according to Weslake, thermodynamics provides a\ndeeper explanation than the either of the two micro-theories. This is\nalso an argument that identifies greater depth with greater scope. The\nunderlying intuition about depth here is, so to speak, the opposite of\nStrevens\u2019 since he would presumably draw the conclusion that in\nthis scenario the generalizations of thermodynamics would lack causal\ncohesion if the different realizing microsystems were actual.\n\nThis section has focused on recent discussion of the roles played by\nthe provision of more underlying detail, and generality (in several\ninterpretations of that notion) in assessments of the depth of causal\nexplanation. It is arguable that there are a number of other\ndimensions of depth that we do not discuss \u2013 readers are\nreferred to Glymour (1980), Wigner (1967), Woodward (2010), Deutsch\n(2011) among many others.\n5. Non-causal and Mathematical Explanation\n\nWe noted above that there has been considerable recent interest in the\nquestion of whether there are non-causal explanations (of the\n\u201cwhy\u201d variety) or whether instead all explanations are\ncausal. Although this entry does not discuss non-causal explanations\nin detail, this issue raises the question of whether there is anything\ngeneral that might be said about what makes an explanation\n\u201ccausal\u201d as opposed to \u201cnon-causal\u201d. In what\nfollows we review some proposals about the causal/non-causal contrast,\nincluding ideas that abstract somewhat from the details of the\ntheories described in previous sections.\n\nWe will follow the philosophical literature on this topic by focusing\non candidate explanations that target empirical explananda within\nempirical science but (it is claimed) explain these non-causally.\nThese contrast with explanations within mathematics, as when some\nmathematical proofs are regarded as explanatory (of mathematical\nfacts). Accounts of non-causal explanation in empirical science\ntypically focus on explanatory factors that seem\n\u201cmathematical\u201d, that abstract from lower-level causal\ndetails, and/or that are related to the explanatory target via\ndependency relations that are (in some sense) non-empirical, even\nthough the explanatory target appears to be an empirical claim. A\ncommon suggestion is that explanations exhibiting one or more of these\nfeatures, qualify as non-causal. Purported examples include appeals to\nmathematical facts to explain various traits in biological systems,\nsuch as the prime-number life cycles of cicadas, the hexagonal-shape\nof the bee\u2019s honeycomb, and the fact that seeds on a sunflower\nhead are described by the golden angle (Baker 2005; Lyon & Colyvan\n2008; Lyon 2012). An additional illustration is Lange\u2019s claim\n(e.g., 2013: 488) that one can explain why 23 strawberries cannot be\nevenly divided among three children by appealing to the mathematical\nfact that 23 is not evenly divisible by three. It is claimed that in\nthese cases, explaining the outcome of interest requires appealing to\nmathematical relationships, which are distinct from causal\nrelationships, in the sense that the former are non-contingent and\npart of some mathematical theory (e.g., arithmetic, geometry, graph\ntheory, calculus) or a consequence of some mathematical axiom\nsystem.\n\nA closely related idea is that in addition to appealing to\nmathematical relationships, non-causal explanations abstract from\nlower-level detail, with the implication that although these details\nmay be causal, they are unnecessary for the explanation which is\nconsequently taken to be non-causal. The question of whether it is\npossible to traverse each bridge in the city of K\u00f6nigsberg\nexactly once (hereafter just \u201ctraverse\u201d) is a\nmuch-discussed example. Euler provided a mathematical proof that\nwhether such traversability is possible depends on higher-level\ntopological or graph-theoretical properties concerning the\nconnectivity of the bridges, as opposed to any lower-level causal\ndetails of the system (Euler 1736 [1956]; Pincock 2012). This\nexplanatory pattern is similar to other topological or network\nexplanations in the literature, which explain despite abstracting from\nlower-level causal detail (Huneman 2012; Kostic 2020; Ross 2021b).\nOther candidates for non-causal explanations are minimal model\nexplanations, in which the removal of at least some or perhaps all\ncausal detail is used to explain why systems which differ\nmicrophysically all exhibit the same behavior in some respects\n(Batterman 2002; Chirimuuta 2014; Ross 2015; and the entry on\n models in science).\n\nStill other accounts (not necessarily inconsistent with those\ndescribed above) attempt to characterize some non-causal explanations\nin terms of the absence of other features (besides those described\nabove). Woodward (2018) discusses two types of cases.\n\n(5.1)\nCases in which the factors cited in the explanans are not possible\ntargets of physical interventions, although we can still ask what\nwould be the case if those factors were different.\n(5.2)\nCases in which, although the factors in the explanans are possible\ntargets of interventions, the dependency relation between explanans\nand explanandum is \u201cmathematical\u201d rather than\ncontingent.\n\n\nAn example of\n (5.1)\n is a purported explanation relating the possibility of stable\nplanetary orbits to the dimensionality of space \u2013 given natural\nassumptions, stable orbits are possible in a three-dimensional space\nbut not possible in a space of dimensionality greater than three, so\nthat the possibility of stable orbits in this sense seems to depend on\nthe dimensionality of space. (For discussion see Ehrenfest 1917;\nB\u00fcchel 1963 [1969]; Callendar 2005). Assuming it is not possible\nto intervene to change the dimensionality of space, this explanation\n(if that is what it is) is treated as non-causal within an\ninterventionist framework because of this impossibility. In other\nwords, the distinction between explanations that appeal to factors\nthat are targets of possible interventions and those that appeal to\nfactors that are not targets of possible interventions is taken to\nmark one dividing line between causal and non-causal explanations.\n\nIn the second set of cases\n (5.2),\n there are factors cited in the explanans that can be changed\nunder interventions but the relationship between this property and the\nexplanandum is non-contingent and \u201cmathematical\u201d. For\nexample, it is certainly possible to intervene to change the\nconfiguration of bridges in K\u00f6nigsberg and in this way to change\ntheir traversability but the relation between the bridge configuration\nand their traversability is, as we have seen, non-contingent. Many of\nthe examples mentioned earlier \u2013 the cicada, honeybee, and\nsunflower cases \u2013 are similar. In these cases, the\nnon-contingent character of the dependency relation between explanans\nand explanandum is claimed to mark off these explanations as\nnon-causal.\n\nA feature of many of the candidates for non-causal explanation\ndiscussed above (and arguably another consideration that distinguishes\ncausal from non-causal explanations) is that the non-causal\nexplanations often seem to explain why some outcome is\npossible or impossible (e.g., why stable orbits are\npossible or impossible in spaces of different dimensions, why it is\npossible or not to traverse various configurations of bridges). By\ncontrast it seems characteristic of causal explanations that they are\nconcerned with a range of outcomes all of which are taken to be\npossible and instead explain why one such outcome in contrast to an\nalternative is realized (why an electric field has a certain strength\nrather than some alternative strength.)\n\nWhile many have taken the above examples to represent clear cases of\nnon-causal, mathematical explanation, others have argued that these\nexplanations remain causal through-and-through. One example of this\nexpansive position about causal explanation is Strevens (2018).\nAccording to Strevens, the K\u00f6nigsberg and other examples are\ncases in which mathematics plays a merely representational role, for\nexample the role of representing difference-makers that dictate the\nmovement of causal processes in the world. Strevens refers to these as\n\u201cnon-tracking\u201d explanations, which identify limitations on\ncausal processes that can explain their final outcome, but not the\nexact path taken to them (Strevens 2018: 112). For Strevens the\ntopological structure represented in the K\u00f6nigsberg\u2019s case\ncaptures information about causal structure or the web of causal\ninfluence \u2013 in this way the information relevant to the\nexplanation, although abstract, is claimed to be causal. While this\nargument is suggestive, one open question is how the kairetic account\ncan capture the fact that some of these cases involve explanations of\nimpossibilities, where the source of the impossibility is not\nobviously \u201cstructural\u201d (Lange 2013, 2016). For example,\nthe impossibility of evenly dividing 23 by 3 does not appear to be a\nconsequence of the way in which a structure influences some causal\n process.[16]\n\nIn addition to the examples and considerations just described, the\nphilosophical literature contains many other proposed contrasts\nbetween causal and non-causal explanations, with accompanying claims\nabout how to classify particular cases. For example, Sober (1983)\nclaims that \u201cequilibrium explanations\u201d are non-causal.\nThese are explanations in which an outcome is explained by showing\nthat, because it is an equilibrium (or better, a unique equilibrium) ,\nany one of a large number of different more specific processes would\nhave led to that outcome. As an illustration, for sexually reproducing\npopulations meeting certain additional conditions (see below), natural\nselection will produce an equilibrium in which there are equal numbers\nof males and females, although the detailed paths by which this\noutcome is produced (which conception events lead to males or females)\nwill vary on different occasions. The underlying intuition here is\nthat causal explanations are those that track specific trajectories or\nconcrete processes, while equilibrium explanations do not do this. By\ncontrast the kairetic theory treats at least some equilibrium\nexplanations as causal in an extended sense (Strevens 2008: 267).\nInterventionist accounts at least in form described in Woodward (2003)\nalso take equilibrium explanations to be causal to the extent that\ninformation is provided about what the equilibrium itself depends on.\n(That is, the interventionist framework takes the explanandum to be\nwhy this equilibrium rather than some alternative equilibrium\nobtains.) For example, the sex ratio equilibrium depends on such\nfactors as the amount of parental investment required to produce each\nsex. Differences in required investment can lead to equilibria in\nwhich there are unequal numbers of males and females. On\ninterventionist accounts, parental investment is thus among the causes\nof the sex ratio because it makes a difference for which equilibrium\nis realized. Interventionist accounts are able to reach this\nconclusion because they treat relatively \u201cabstract\u201d\nfactors like parental investment as causes as long as interventions on\nthese are systematically associated with associated with changes in\noutcomes. Thus, in contrast to some of the accounts described above,\ninterventionism does not regard the abstractness per se of an\nexplanatory factor as a bar to interpreting it as causal.\n\nThere has also been considerable discussion of whether computational\nexplanations of the sort found in cognitive psychology and cognitive\nneuroscience that relate inputs to outputs via computations are causal\nor mechanistic. Many advocates (Piccinini 2006; Piccinini & Craver\n2011) of mechanistic models of explanation have regarded such\nexplanations as at best mechanism sketches, since they say little or\nnothing about realizing (e.g., neurobiological) detail. Since these\nwriters tend to treat \u201cmechanistic explanation\u201d,\n\u201ccausal explanation\u201d and even \u201cexplanation\u201d as\nco-extensional, at least in the biomedical sciences, they seem to\nleave no room for a notion of non-causal explanation. By contrast\ncomputational explanations count as causal by interventionist lights\nas long as they correctly describe how outputs vary under\ninterventions on inputs (Rescorla 2014). But other analyses of\ncomputational models suggest that they are similar to non-causal forms\nof explanation (Chirimuuta 2014, 2018).\n6. Additional Issues\n\nBesides the authors discussed above, there is a great deal of\nadditional recent work related to causal explanation that we lack the\nspace to discuss. For additional work on the role of abstraction and\nidealization in causal explanation (and whether the presence of\nvarious sorts of abstraction and idealization in an explanation\nimplies that it is non-causal) see Janssen and Saatsi (2019),\nReutlinger and Andersen (2016), Blanchard (2020), Rice (2021), and\nPincock (2022). Another set of issues that has received a great deal\nof recent attention concerns causal explanation in contexts in which\ndifferent \u201clevels\u201d are present (Craver & Bechtel 2007;\nBaumgartner 2010; Woodward 2020) This literature addresses questions\nof the following sort. Can there be \u201cupper-level\u201d\ncausation at all or does all causal action occur at some lower,\nmicrophysical level, with upper-level variables being casually inert?\nCan there be \u201ccross-level\u201d causation \u2013 e.g.,\n\u201cdownward\u201d causation from upper to lower levels? Finally,\nin addition to the work on explanatory depth discussed in\n Section 4,\n there has been a substantial amount of recent work on distinctions\namong different sorts of causal claims (Woodward 2010; Ross 2021a;\nRoss & Woodward 2022) and on what makes some causes more\nexplanatorily significant than others (e.g., Potochnik 2015).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Andersen, Holly, 2014a, \u201cA Field Guide to Mechanisms: Part\nI: A Field Guide to Mechanisms I\u201d, <em>Philosophy Compass</em>,\n9(4): 274\u2013283. doi:10.1111/phc3.12119", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014b, \u201cA Field Guide to Mechanisms:\nPart II: A Field Guide to Mechanisms II\u201d, <em>Philosophy\nCompass</em>, 9(4): 284\u2013293. doi:10.1111/phc3.12118", "Anscombe, G.
