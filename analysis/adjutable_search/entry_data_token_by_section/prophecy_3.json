    "main_text": "Ockhamism and the Past\n4. Ockhamism and the Past\n\nWilliam Ockham\n (c.1285\u20131347), a highly influential Christian philosopher and\ntheologian from the medieval period, suggested an interesting way of\naccounting for God\u2019s knowledge of the contingent future and\nresolving the problem of prophecy. (For more detailed presentations of\nOckham\u2019s views, see the introduction to Ockham 1983 by Adams and\nthe introduction to Molina 1988 by Freddoso.) Ockham claims that what\na prophet has truly revealed about the contingent future \u201ccould\nhave been and can be false\u201d (Ockham Predestination,\n44), even though the existence of the prophecy in the past is\n\u201cever afterwards necessary\u201d (Ockham\nPredestination, 44). As Calvin Normore puts it, \u201cAfter\nGod has revealed a future contingency it is necessary that the\nphysical or mental things he used to reveal it have existed, but what\nis revealed is not necessary\u201d (Normore 1982, 373). In terms of\nour example involving Jesus\u2019 prophecy concerning Peter\u2019s\ndenial, Ockham\u2019s idea is that were Peter to choose freely not to\ndeny Jesus instead, then Jesus would never have prophesied that Peter\nwould deny him. (Some philosophers like to call this kind of\nproposition a \u201cback-tracking counterfactual\u201d, because it\nis a subjunctive conditional statement whose consequent refers to an\nearlier time than its antecedent.) In other words, if a person were\nabout to choose freely to do something, then God would have known\nabout it from eternity, and hence would have acted accordingly. \n\nIf this is right, then Ockham\u2019s idea seems to imply that we have\nthe ability to do something now such that if we were to do it, then\nthe past would have been different (because God would known what we\nwould do differently and hence would have acted differently in the\npast). Some philosophers refer to this kind of ability as\n\u201ccounterfactual power over the past.\u201d Alvin Plantinga has\nthis idea in mind in his defense of Ockham\u2019s account of\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the contingent future when he says that\n\u201cit is possible that there is an action such that it is within\nyour power to perform it and such that if you were to perform it, then\nGod would not have created Abraham\u201d (Plantinga 1986, 257). Along\nthe same lines, Edward Wierenga suggests that according to Ockham,\nPeter has the power to do something such that if he were to do it,\nthen Jesus would not have intended what he said about Peter\u2019s\nfuture denials as a prophecy (Wierenga 1991, 440). In other words,\nJesus uttered words that actually did constitute a prophecy, but those\nsame words would not have been a prophecy had Peter chosen otherwise\n(Wierenga 1991, 440). \n\nMore recently, Trenton Merricks (2009) has defended the idea that\nGod\u2019s past beliefs depend upon our future free choices (although\nhe distinguishes his proposal from Ockham\u2019s: see Fischer and\nTodd 2011 and the reply in Merricks 2011a).\n\nBut doesn\u2019t this attribute to Peter a rather odd power over the\npast? Once Jesus says certain words with a certain intention, is it\ncoherent to say that Peter still has a choice about whether or not to\nbetray Jesus? Some philosophers have expressed doubts along these\nlines about whether or not Ockham\u2019s approach is ultimately\nsuccessful. Alfred J. Freddoso, for instance, claims that\n\u201cOckhamism commits one to having to choose between the Scylla of\nclaiming that God can undo the causal history of the world and the\nCharybdis of claiming that divine prophecies might be deceptive or\nmistaken\u201d (Freddoso 1988, 61; see also Warfield 2009). Finch and\nRea (2008) have also argued that a commitment to Ockham\u2019s\nsolution is incompatible with a belief in presentism, the view that\nonly the present moment is real. Whether or not these things are so,\none might wonder about the prospects for another solution. \n",
