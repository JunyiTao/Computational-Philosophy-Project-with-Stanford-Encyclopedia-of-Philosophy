    "main_text": "Nicholas\u2019 Thought || Symbols and Philosophical Theology\n2.3 Symbols and Philosophical Theology\n\nThe relationship between On Learned Ignorance and On\nConjectures sets a pattern for the many shorter theoretical works\nNicholas was to write in the two decades that followed. The basic\ninsights and the framework laid out in On Learned Ignorance\nis never discarded and never substantively modified. Instead\nNicholas\u2019 dialogues and briefer treatises can be read as\nproposing many different metaphors or symbols for understanding his\nteaching about the relationship between God and creatures. Three\nexamples of these metaphors may give some idea of the power and\nfreshness of his speculative imagining. The first is his use of the\nicon and the wall in The Vision of God (1453); the second his\nattempt to capture the God-creature connection by describing God as\n\u201cNot Other\u201d in the dialogue by that name (On the Not\nOther, 1461); the third his fascination with mathematics and its\nsymbolic potential. While Cusanus never surrenders his initial insight\nthat there is no proportion between infinite and finite, thinking\nthrough these later symbols and neologisms lets us see how these\nindirect means enable some movement of mind and heart towards the\ndivine Mystery with whom we are ever connected.\n2.3.1 The Icon and the Wall\n\nCusanus wrote The Vision of God in the form of a prayer,\nresponding to the request of the Benedictines of Tegernsee for a\ntreatise on mystical theology. With it he sent them an\n\u201call-seeing\u201d icon and proposed an exercise for its use to\ngive them some understanding of God\u2019s seeing their attempts to\nsee God. The icon was probably a \u201cVeronica\u201d or image of\nthe face of the suffering Jesus in which the eyes were portrayed as\nlooking out of the picture plane. As a result, from whatever\nstandpoint one looked at the painting, it seemed the eyes of Jesus\nlooked directly into the viewer\u2019s own eyes. Thus it could\nsymbolize at once both God\u2019s vision of us and our vision of God\n(the combined objective and subjective senses of visio\nDei).\n\nNicholas begins by warning that \u201cWhatever is apparent with\nregard to the icon of God\u2019s sight is truer with regard to\nGod\u2019s true sight.\u201d(c. 1) And what does appear when we\nplace ourselves with the monks viewing the painting and reflect? Since\nit is a painting we see, what we seem to experience as we look into\nthe eyes of Jesus is not really taking place. The face portrayed\nneither looks at nor sees anyone; in fact, the viewer\u2019s gaze is\nthe norm for this experience of a face-to-face encounter. Yet because\nof the spatial and temporal simultaneity the apparent gaze of the icon\ninvites the viewer to enter into the world of the painting and tends\nto privilege what is portrayed, namely Jesus gazing at me. I move back\nand forth from my customary reactions when eyes are looking into my\neyes to the realization that this eye contact is illusory.\n\nBut the illusory image in this case is of Christ suffering and looking\nat me. If this painting is to mediate between my reality and what it\nportrays, it obviously invites me to look beyond, since this is an\nimage of the One who is the image of the Father. Twice\nremoved from the actual divine seeing and being seen it is supposed to\nsymbolize, Nicholas\u2019 use of this icon lets us understand how far\nwe stand from God\u2019s own seeing. Yet Nicholas\u2019 initial\nwarning also reminds us that what is symbolized here by the painting\nis all the more so in reality. We are in truth preceded and embraced\nby Christ\u2019s seeing us.\n\nIn seeing we are seen\u2014this mutual relatedness is at least what\nthe icon symbolizes. But Nicholas goes further, proposing that\nGod\u2019s seeing and God\u2019s being seen are identical:\n\nO Lord, when you look upon me with an eye of graciousness, what is\nyour seeing, other than your being seen by me? In seeing me, you who\nare deus absconditus [hidden God] give yourself to be seen by\nme. No one can see You except insofar as you grant that you be seen.\nTo see you is not other than that you see the one who sees you. (c.5,\nHopkins translation)\n\n\nIn this way God seen is identically God seeing. The reason is that for\nGod to be seen by any creature is nothing else than for God to\n\u201csee\u201d that creature gazing. But the icon also reminds us\nof our distance from seeing God. I can see the depicted eyes of Jesus\neven though no real eyes are present. But I cannot see the divine face\nor its vision even though God\u2019s reality is present and\n\u201csees\u201d me. The dialectic of divine presence and absence,\nof human seeing and not seeing that I experience with the icon is thus\nturned inside out. When I look at the icon of Christ, what seems\npresent, its seeing, is really absent, yet God\u2019s seeing is\nreally present though it seems absent.\n\nWhat the icon thus symbolizes is the experienced simultaneous\nconnection of different levels of reality. Indeed, I have separate\nreality as a contracted image of God only through my relation to my\ndivine Source. What is telling about Nicholas\u2019 version of seeing\nGod is neither what vision discerns nor what practices one must follow\nin order to gain the correct standpoint for such seeing. Rather he\nrevises the meaning of \u201cseeing God\u201d so that God is both\nsubject and object of our purported vision of God.\n\nYet this vision of God is merely purported. Cusanus leads us through a\nseries of reflections on seeing and on the face of God only to let us\nrealize that, whatever ratio or discursive reason comes to\nrealize, God is located beyond both imaginative exercise and\nconceptual understanding. Nicholas symbolizes our approach to this\nbeyond by encouraging us to enter \u201cinto a certain secret and\nhidden silence wherein there is no knowledge or concept of a\nface,\u201d characterizing it as an \u201cobscuring mist, haze,\ndarkness or ignorance.\u201d (c.6) He invokes the coincidence of\nopposites from On Learned Ignorance and, in chapter 9 of\nThe Vision of God, proposes his second central metaphor: the\nwall of paradise. God dwells inside this wall, and the wall also\nsymbolizes the coincidence of opposites and thus the defeat of\ndiscursive reason and the principle of contradiction.\n\nJust how are we to think through the coincidence of opposites and\nattempt to move beyond the wall to some sort of \u201cseeing\u201d\nGod? Nicholas proposes that three locations in relation to the wall\nmap three stages in the mystical quest, using the metaphorical couple\nof \u201cenfolding/unfolding\u201d from On Learned\nIgnorance. Reason can understand things enfolded in or identical\nwith God as different from the same things unfolded in the created\nuniverse. At this first stage we are outside the wall. The second\nstage is at the wall itself, where Nicholas places us with Christ at\nthe door or threshold of an entrance in the wall. Here enfolding and\nunfolding coincide and we encounter the barrier of the coincidence of\nopposites. At best we acknowledge that creating and being created are\none and the same in God. A third stage is beyond the entrance and\ninside the wall where enfolding/unfolding fall away and Cusanus points\nto God\u2019s silent presence and utter transcendence, \u201cfree\nfrom whatever can be spoken of or thought of\u201d (c.11) The third\nstage involves recognition that God\u2019s infinity remains\nunknowable to us in conceptual terms.\n\nCusanus proposes some possible indirect routes that will give us no\npositive insight or conceptual grasp of the divine Essence. For\ninstance, if we look to the very oppositions and contradictions that\nplague our normal thinking about God, we may do more justice to the\nunique relation between God and creatures. In his words, \u201cthe\noppositeness of opposites is oppositeness without oppositeness.\u201d\n(c.13) He identifies the infinite God with this \u201coppositeness of\nopposites.\u201d Now the \u201copposites\u201d in question are the\nordinary things of our experience that are separate and distinct and\nthat may have opposed or mutually exclusive properties.\n\nDesignating God as the Oppositeness of such opposites can take us from\nthe distinctions and oppositions with which we are familiar to the One\nwho is responsible for there being such oppositions. God is distinct\nfrom these oppositions and differences but only in a way that\nestablishes their reality. Yet God\u2019s oppositeness is\n\u201cwithout oppositeness\u201d since God\u2019s distinctiveness\nis unlimited and beyond familiar oppositions. In fact, God\u2019s\noppositeness encompasses or enfolds all opposites in God as\nidentically God and encompasses or unfolds all opposites in creation\nby constituting them as what they are in all their determinate, finite\ndifferences. We are to think together both the way finite\nthings are opposed and God\u2019s transcendent oppositeness\nthat is \u201copposed\u201d to those opposites, not as they are to\none another, but so as to be ontologically responsible for the\noppositions with which we are familiar.\n2.3.2 God is the Not Other\n\nIn De li Non Aliud/On the Not Other (1462) Nicholas returns\nto the ancient Platonic categories of the One and the Other in order\nto re-construe in novel language what Christians believe about the\ndependence of creatures on their Creator. Several of Cusanus\u2019\nlater works use verbal coinages or Latin neologisms as\n\u201cnames\u201d or characterizations of God that are original with\nhim, though they have earlier echoes in Christian Neoplatonism. In\nthis dialogue he uses the expression \u201cthe not other\u201d as a\nsubstantive for God as the divine Not-Other, even though we are more\nfamiliar with the phrase in comparative expressions that are negative\nways of stating self-identity. For instance, \u201cthe tree is not\nother than (= the same as, identical with) the tree.\u201d\n\nWhen we use reason to recognize differences and to make distinctions,\nwe are attempting to do justice to the plurality and variety of the\nnatural and cultural realms with which we are most familiar. Even\nthings of the same kind are different numerically, and speaking and\nthinking clearly about things and their features requires our\ndifferentiating what is determinate about them. We expect them to stay\nthe same as they are and to remain different from other things and we\nreflect this in our language of identity and difference when we\ndescribe and define what we perceive and understand.\n\nNicholas is attempting to capitalize on the way we differentiate\ncreated things to signal and symbolize their divine Creator. While\neach created thing is not other than itself, so to speak, it certainly\nis other or different from other things. And created things are\ndifferent from God as well. But Nicholas is proposing a way of\n\u201cnaming\u201d God that will underline how God\u2019s\ndifference from God\u2019s creatures is not even close to one\ncreature\u2019s difference from another creature. God\u2019s\ndifference is categorially different, so to speak, from one\ncreature\u2019s otherness from a second creature. Cusanus can thus\nparadoxically assert that God is \u201cnot other\u201d than anything\nGod has created and is sustaining in being. Indeed, we do well to\nthink of God as \u201cthe Not-Other.\u201d\n\nHere is what Nicholas writes:\n\nNot Other is not an other, nor is it other than any other, nor is it\nan other in an other\u2014for no other reason than that it is Not\nOther, which can in no way be other, as if it something were lacking\nto it, as to an other. For an other which is other than something\nlacks that than which it is other. But Not Other, because it is not\nother than anything, does not lack anything nor can anything be\noutside it. (c.6)\n\n\nWe may paraphrase this rather cryptic passage as follows. The divine\nNot-Other is simply not one of the things we are familiar with in the\nworld we inhabit, where all is multiplicity and difference, where each\nthing or state of affairs is other than or different from every other\nexistent thing or situation that obtains. Nicholas terms the multiple\nthings we deal with \u201cothers\u201d because each one of them,\neach \u201cother,\u201d is distinct from every other thing. Nicholas\nalso proposes that such finite things possess and lack what things\ndifferent from them possess\u2014to be other or distinct is precisely\nnot to be one or any of the finite others. Our language and thought\nbusy themselves in finding and making further distinctions and\ndivisions between things and parts of things, between one condition\nand another, between one state of affairs and another. So we come to\nknow that one thing is other than or separate from another thing or\nthat we find it in another that is related to, yet different from,\nsomething else.\n\nNicholas\u2019 central point is that the divine Not-Other is nothing\nlike all the finite, limited others of our experience. Nicholas\nwrites, \u201cNot Other does not lack anything.\u201d Even in common\nsense terms, any given thing is \u201cplenty lacking,\u201d to speak\ncolloquially. No matter what it has, it arguably is lacking some of\nwhat it should have as a specimen of its type, and it certainly lacks\nwhat other things not of its kind possess. One way to think of the\nfinite things with which we are familiar is to consider that their\nbeing limited means that they are just so much and not more. But this\nis exactly how we should not think of God, who \u201cdoes not lack\nanything\u201d and outside of whom nothing can exist. As Nicholas\nsays, \u201cBut God is Not-Other because God is not other than other,\neven though \u2018not other\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 seem\nopposed. But other is not opposed to God from whom it has that it is\nother.\u201d (c.6)\n\nThe opposition in this case is entirely different because, though\ncreatures are dependent functions of God and may be interdependent\nfunctions of one another, God is not a dependent function of\ncreatures. God is precisely not any of the others and so is not other\nor different in the way creatures are. We thus have two sorts of\ndifferentiation or otherness, the opposition between distinct\ncreatures and the opposition between creatures and God. The\n\u201cNot\u201d in \u201cNot-Other\u201d differentiates God from\ncreatures but does not exclude the divine Not-Other since the\nNot-Other ontologically determines creatures. Thinking God as\nNot-Other requires a characteristic Cusan dialectical thinking, not\nsimply affirming or denying difference. We are to recognize and\nacknowledge that the divine Not-Other is both not one of the\nothers and at once not other than any or all of them.\n\nTo put this more formally, the difference or opposition between\ncreated things is both symmetrical and transitive. The basis for their\ndistinction is their identity: their symmetrical otherness is the\nresult of their substantial not-otherness, so to speak. But created\nthings\u2019 difference from God is asymmetrical and intransitive.\nTrue, the divine Not-Other is not one of the creatures, but in a\ndifferent way than they are different from one another. Cusanus gives\nexpression to this important difference between finite and Infinite\nwhen he asserts that the divine Not-Other is not other than\nany created other. Negatively, the Not-Other is not finite as the\nothers are; positively, the reflexivity characteristic of a limited\nthing\u2019s self-identity also characterizes the Not-Other\u2019s\nrelation with it.\n\nJust as any creature is not other than itself so it is not other than\nthe divine Not-Other. The divine Not-Other both is and is not every\nfinite other. The reason is that distinct created things possess their\nvery status as beings, and thus their otherness, from and through God.\nGod, the divine Not-Other, is causally responsible for things\u2019\nexisting as separate and self-identical others. For Nicholas, nothing\ncan have being outside of God.\n2.3.3 Mathematics and God\n\nRecent publications, and in particular, D.Albertson\u2019s\nMathematical Theologies(2014), have highlighted another key\ntheme and its attendant metaphors in Nicholas\u2019 works:\nmathematics and number. Cusanus believes that no knowledge we have is\nmore certain than mathematics, given that it is the construction of\nour own minds. Mathematical ideas are the paradigm of how the human\nmind unfolds a conceptual universe that parallels and forms an image\nof God\u2019s unfolding of the created world. Number here refers\nprimarily to arithmetic and geometry, to the whole numbers and to\nplane and solid figures. The latter are often imagined as in movement\nor constructing other figures. Nicholas joins enfolding/unfolding and\nthe certainty of mathematics to the Christian tradition that\neverything is created in the divine word or Logos.\n\nGeometrical figures are used early in Book 1 of On Learned\nIgnorance to illustrate how our knowledge of created things is\nonly approximative. A bit later we are led to extrapolate straight and\ncurved lines as an aid to understanding the coincidence of opposites\nand to moving human thought towards the God who is unknowable by\nreason. Book 2 uses number to illustrate enfolding and\nunfolding\u2014as the number series unfolds what is enfolded in the\nunit, so God unfolds all created things. Nicholas later introduces the\ngeometrical image of the sphere whose center is everywhere and whose\ncircumference is nowhere to explain how the physical universe\u2019s\nlack of boundaries is an image of God\u2019s infinity. Book 2 also\nopens and closes with reflection on the quadrivium: arithmetic,\ngeometry, music and astronomy. Book 3 returns to the image of the\ninfinite sphere for the combination of absolute and contracted reality\nin the God-man.\n\nOn Conjectures moves directly into arithmetic and geometry\nwith its conjectural reflections on the decade\u2019s embracing all\nnumber and with its ordering of reality\u2019s oneness and otherness\nusing the spatial diagrams P and U that employ cones and spheres. Just\nas the number series unfolds the unit, so the created universe unfolds\nGod\u2019s creating, and human concepts (such as numbers and\ngeometric figures) unfold the oneness of the human mind. In this way a\nhuman being is truly a \u201csecond God.\u201d\n\nNicholas\u2019 later works of the 1450s extend the notion of number\nand of enfolding/unfolding that he inherited from Boethius and the\ntwelfth-century school of Chartres. Number and size (multitudo et\nmagnitudo) are central to The Layman: On Mind where\nmeasuring is proposed as the layman\u2019s definition of the human\nmind. Measuring is then used directly in The Layman: Experiments\nwith Weights. Nicholas proposes that the Divine Word in whom all\nthings are created or unfolded in time is to be thought together with\nhuman measuring as the closest sign or image of the Divine Oneness. In\nthe background stands the saying from the Book of Wisdom11.21\nthat in creating God ordered \u201call things in measure, number and\nweight.\u201d This way number and mathematical ideas take on more\nthan their usual employment for human ends and become a way to the\nCreator always present to creaturely unfoldings in human thought.\n\nThe Vision of God (1453) proposes an exercise for the monks\nbased on the center and circumference of circle wherein seeing from\nthe circumference and being seen from the center collapse into a\nfigure of mystical oneness: being seen seeing. In the same year\nNicholas composes Complementary Theological Considerations (De\ntheologicis complementis). There he features God as a\nmathematician who creates in the Equality of the Divine\nWord\u2014unfolding as well human beings whose quadrivial mathematics\nis an image of the divine creativity. God is now named \u201cinfinite\nangle\u201d that unites maximal and minimal angles and the\nnon-quantitative number of everything. Nicholas thus brings together\nhis theological and mathematical concepts from the 1440s and unites\nnumber, enfolding/unfolding and the Divine Word.\n",
