    "main_text": "Arguments for Value Incommensurability and Incomparability || Constitutive Incommensurability\n3.1 Constitutive Incommensurability\n\nIt has been argued that value incomparability is constitutive of\ncertain goods and values and consequently we should assume its\nexistence. Two versions of this second argument will be discussed\nhere.\n\nOne version of this argument comes from Joseph Raz. Consider being\noffered a significant amount of money to leave one\u2019s spouse for\na month. The indignation that is typically experienced in response to\nsuch an offer, according to Raz, is grounded in part in the symbolic\nsignificance of certain actions (1986, 349). In this case, \u201cwhat\nhas symbolic significance is the very judgment that companionship is\nincommensurable with money\u201d (1986, 350). Although this form of\nvalue incommensurability looks like trumping, Raz does not see this as\na case of trumping. He rejects the view that companionship is more\nvaluable than money. If such a view were correct, then those who forgo\ncompanionship for money would be acting against reason (1986, 352).\nInstead, Raz takes the view that a \u201cbelief in incommensurability\nis itself a qualification for having certain relations\u201d (1986,\n351). Someone who does not regard companionship and money as\nincommensurable simply has chosen a kind of life that may be\nfulfilling in many ways, but being capable of having companionship is\nnot one of them.\n\nIn Raz\u2019s account, the symbolic significance of judging money to\nbe incommensurable with companionship involves the existence of a\nsocial convention that determines participation in that convention\n(e.g., marriage) that requires a belief in value incommensurability.\nThis conventional nature of belief in value incommensurability in\nRaz\u2019s account raises a question for some authors about its\nrobustness as an account of value incommensurability. For example,\nChang objects that incommensurability appears to become relative to\none\u2019s participation in social conventions (2001, 48). It remains\nan open question how much of a problem this point raises. Raz\u2019s\naccount appears to illustrate a basic sense in which the values of\nmoney and companionship can be incommensurable. Insofar as it is not\nagainst reason to choose money over companionship, there is no general\nway to resolve a conflict of values between money and companionship.\nIn Raz\u2019s account, the resolution depends upon which social\nconvention one has chosen to pursue.\n\nElizabeth Anderson advances a second argument for constitutive\nincommensurability. Her account is grounded in a pragmatic account of\nvalue. Anderson reduces \u201c\u2018x is good\u2019 roughly to\n\u2018it is rational to value x,\u2019 where to value something is\nto adopt toward it a favorable attitude susceptible to rational\nreflection\u201d (1997, 95). She argues that in virtue of these\nattitudes there may be no good reason to compare the overall values of\ntwo goods. Pragmatism holds that if such a comparison serves no\npractical function, then the comparative value judgment has no truth\nvalue, meaning that the goods are incommensurable (1997, 99). Because\nthe favorable attitudes one adopts toward goods help to make them\ngood, Anderson\u2019s account can be seen as an argument for\nconstitutive incommensurability (Chang 2001, 49).\n\nAnderson advances three ways in which there may be no good reason to\ncompare the overall values of goods. First, it may be boring or\npointless to engage in comparison. To illustrate, \u201cthe project\nof comprehensively ranking all works of art in terms of their\nintrinsic aesthetic value is foolish, boring, and stultifying\u201d\n(1997, 100). Second, Anderson points to instances in which \u201cit\nmakes sense to leave room for the free play of nonrational motivations\nlike whims and moods\u201d as in the choice of what to do on a\nleisurely Sunday afternoon (1997, 91). Third, Anderson argues that the\nroles that goods play in deliberation can be so different that\n\u201cattempts to compare them head to head are incoherent\u201d\n(1997, 91). Imagine that the only way to save one\u2019s dying mother\nis to give up a friendship. Rather than compare their overall values,\nargues Anderson, ordinary moral thinking focuses on what one owes to\none\u2019s mother and one\u2019s friends (1997, 102). This focus on\nobligation recognizes mother and friend each to be intrinsically\nvaluable and yet valuable in different ways (1997, 103). There is no\ngood reason, according to Anderson, to compare their overall values\nwith regard to some common measure.\n\nChang argues against each of the three points raised by Anderson\n(Chang 2001). In response to the first point, Chang notes there are\noccasions in which comparisons do need to be made between goods for\nwhich Anderson argues there is no good reason to make comparisons. In\nresponse to the second point, Chang argues that the range of instances\nfor which the second argument applies is small. In response to the\nthird point, Chang contends that Anderson\u2019s argument assumes\nthat if goods are comparable then they have some value or evaluative\nproperty in common. Chang points out that this need not be the\ncase.\n",
