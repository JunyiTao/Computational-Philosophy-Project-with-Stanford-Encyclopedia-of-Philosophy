Therefore it may seem rather tempting to try to incorporate\nconsiderations on truth values into the broader context of traditional\ntruth-theories, such as correspondence, coherence, anti-realistic, or\npragmatist conceptions of truth. Yet, it is unlikely that such\nattempts can give rise to any considerable success. Indeed, the\nimmense fruitfulness of Frege\u2019s introduction of truth values\ninto logic to a large extent is just due to its philosophical\nneutrality with respect to theories of truth. It does not commit one\nto any specific metaphysical doctrine of truth. In one significant\nrespect, however, the idea of truth values contravenes traditional\napproaches to truth by bringing to the forefront the problem of its\ncategorial classification.\n\nIn most of the established conceptions, truth is usually treated as a\nproperty. It is customary to talk about a \u201ctruth\npredicate\u201d and its attribution to sentences, propositions,\nbeliefs or the like. Such an understanding corresponds also to a\nroutine linguistic practice, when one operates with the adjective\n\u2018true\u2019 and asserts, e.g., \u2018That 5 is a prime number\nis true\u2019. By contrast with this apparently quite natural\nattitude, the suggestion to interpret truth as an object may seem very\nconfusing, to say the least. Nevertheless this suggestion is also\nequipped with a profound and strong motivation demonstrating that it\nis far from being just an oddity and has to be taken seriously (cf.\nBurge 1986).\n\nFirst, it should be noted that the view of truth as a property is not\nas natural as it appears on the face of it. Frege brought into play an\nargument to the effect that characterizing a sentence as true\nadds nothing new to its content, for \u2018It is true that 5 is a\nprime number\u2019 says exactly the same as just \u20185 is a prime\nnumber\u2019. That is, the adjective \u2018true\u2019 is in a sense\nredundant and thus is not a real predicate expressing a real\nproperty such as the predicates \u2018white\u2019 or\n\u2018prime\u2019 which, on the contrary, cannot simply be\neliminated from a sentence without an essential loss for its content.\nIn this case a superficial grammatical analogy is misleading. This\nidea gave an impetus to the deflationary conception of truth\n(advocated by Ramsey, Ayer, Quine, Horwich, and others, see the entry\non\n the deflationary theory of truth).\n\nHowever, even admitting the redundancy of truth as a property, Frege\nemphasizes its importance and indispensable role in some other\nrespect. Namely, truth, accompanying every act of judgment as its\nultimate goal, secures an objective value of cognition by\narranging for every assertive sentence a transition from the level of\nsense (the thought expressed by a sentence) to the level of denotation\n(its truth value). This circumstance specifies the significance of\ntaking truth as a particular object. As Tyler Burge explains:\n\n\nNormally, the point of using sentences, what \u201cmatters to\nus\u201d, is to claim truth for a thought. The object, in the sense\nof the point or objective, of sentence use was truth. It is\nilluminating therefore to see truth as an object. (Burge 1986: 120)\n\n\n\nAs it has been observed repeatedly in the literature (cf., e.g., Burge\n1986, Ruffino 2003), the stress Frege laid on the notion of a truth\nvalue was, to a great extent, pragmatically motivated. Besides an\nintended gain for his system of \u201cBasic Laws\u201d (Frege\n1893/1903) reflected in enhanced technical clarity, simplicity, and\nunity, Frege also sought to substantiate in this way his view on logic\nas a theoretical discipline with truth as its main goal and primary\nsubject-matter. Incidentally, Gottfried Gabriel (1986) demonstrated\nthat in the latter respect Frege\u2019s ideas can be naturally linked\nup with a value-theoretical tradition in German philosophy of the\nsecond half of the 19th century; see also (Gabriel 2013) on\nthe relation between Frege\u2019s value-theoretically inspired\nconception of truth values and his theory of judgement. More\nspecifically, Wilhelm Windelband, the founder and the principal\nrepresentative of the Southwest school of Neo-Kantianism, was actually\nthe first who employed the term \u201ctruth value\u201d\n(\u201cWahrheitswert\u201d) in his essay \u201cWhat is\nPhilosophy?\u201d published in 1882 (see Windelband 1915: 32), i.e.,\nnine years before Frege 1891, even if he was very far from treating a\ntruth value as a value of a function.\n\nWindelband defined philosophy as a \u201ccritical science about\nuniversal values\u201d. He considered philosophical statements to be\nnot mere judgements but rather assessments, dealing with some\nfundamental values, the value of truth being one of the most\nimportant among them. This latter value is to be studied by logic as a\nspecial philosophical discipline. Thus, from a value-theoretical\nstandpoint, the main task of philosophy, taken generally, is to\nestablish the principles of logical, ethical and aesthetical\nassessments, and Windelband accordingly highlighted the triad of basic\nvalues: \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d. Later this triad was taken up by Frege in\n1918 when he defined the subject-matter of logic (see below). Gabriel\npoints out (1984: 374) that this connection between logic and a value\ntheory can be traced back to Hermann Lotze, whose seminars in\nG\u00f6ttingen were attended by both Windelband and Frege.\n\nThe decisive move made by Frege was to bring together a philosophical\nand a mathematical understanding of values on the basis of a\ngeneralization of the notion of a function on numbers. While Frege may\nhave been inspired by Windelband\u2019s use of the word\n\u2018value\u2019 (and even more concretely \u2013 \u2018truth\nvalue\u2019), it is clear that he uses the word in its mathematical\nsense. If predicates are construed as a kind of functional expressions\nwhich, being applied to singular terms as arguments, produce\nsentences, then the values of the corresponding functions must be\nreferences of sentences. Taking into account that the range of any\nfunction typically consists of objects, it is natural to conclude that\nreferences of sentences must be objects as well. And if one now just\ntakes it that sentences refer to truth values (the True and\nthe False), then it turns out that truth values are indeed\nobjects, and it seems quite reasonable to generally explicate truth\nand falsity as objects and not as properties. As Frege explains:\n\n\nA statement contains no empty place, and therefore we must take its\nBedeutung as an object. But this Bedeutung is a\ntruth-value. Thus the two truth-values are objects. (Frege 1891,\ntrans. Beaney 1997: 140) \n\n\nFrege\u2019s theory of sentences as names of truth values has been\ncriticized, for example, by Michael Dummett who stated rather\ndramatically:\n\n\nThis was the most disastrous of the effects of the misbegotten\ndoctrine that sentences are a species of complex singular terms, which\ndominated Frege\u2019s later period: to rob him of the insight that\nsentences play a unique role, and that the role of almost every other\nlinguistic expression \u2026 consists in its part in forming\nsentences. (Dummett 1981: 196) \n\n\nBut even Dummett (1991: 242) concedes that \u201cto deny that\ntruth-values are objects \u2026 seems a weak response\u201d.\n",
