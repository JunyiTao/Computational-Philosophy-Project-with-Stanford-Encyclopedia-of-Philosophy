    "main_text": "Albertus Magnus and the Sciences\n6. Albertus Magnus and the Sciences\n\n\nIn the first section of his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics Albertus Magnus discusses the possibility of the study of\nnatural science. If science could only study particulars, Albert\nargues, then there would be no science in the sense of the\ndemonstration of necessary causes because there would be as many\nsciences as there are particulars. But particulars, Albert goes on to\npoint out, belong to definite kinds (species) and these can be studied\nbecause their causes can be demonstrated. Species have common\nattributes and a determined subject of which the attributes can be\ndetermined with necessity. Thus science is possible.\n\n\nAnd this conviction about science being possible, as opposed to the\nPlatonic and Neoplatonic tendency to discount the world of particular\nreality, and its presumed unaccountable changeableness, was not just a\ntheoretical position on Albert\u2019s part. He devotes a great deal of\nhis time and attention to the actual empirical study of the\nrelationships between attributes and natural subjects. Furthermore, he\norders such study into what today would be called the \u201cnatural\nsciences\u201d. Besides the study of the heavens and the earth and\ngeneration and corruption that he found in Aristotle, he adds the study\nof meteors, the mineral, animal, and vegetable kingdoms.\n\n\nAlbert inherited astronomy as part of the scholastic curriculum known\nas the quadrivium. But his interest in this science\nwas not merely conceptual; he was also interested in using mathematical\ncalculations and conferring with astronomical tables to study the\nnature of celestial bodies. He was concerned with the constellations,\nthe sizes of planets and stars and their positions and movements in the\nheavens. He seems to have known about astronomical instruments,\nparticularly the astrolabe, but gives no clue as to what method of\ninvestigation he used to carry out his studies. He did make it clear,\nhowever, that the principles of physics had to be applied to celestial\nbodies, which he regarded as natural physical bodies moving in real\nspace.\n\n\nBesides studying the properties of the celestial bodies themselves, he\nalso was concerned with their effects on terrestrial objects. For\nexample, he seems to have understood that the tides on earth were\nrelated to celestial bodies.\n\n\nAfter astronomy, Albert develops a particular order in which he\nproposes to study the other sciences. In his Meteora, he\nexplains that sublunary moveable bodies can be studied in three ways.\nFirst, in so far as they come into and pass out of being (generation\nand corruption). Then they must be investigated with respect to their\nmixture with other moveable bodies. And lastly, they need to be studied\nwith respect to their contraction to the mineral, vegetable, and animal\nspecies. This last phase of his plan, however, is where Albert made his\nown contribution to the development of modern science as it is known\ntoday. That is, he undertook his own empirical investigations into the\nmineral, plant, and animal kingdoms.\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s Treatise on Minerals (De mineralibus)\nshows that he undertakes his own observations and did not merely\ncollate authorities on the topic. He studies different kinds of\nminerals and metals as well as rare stones. Beginning with the mineral\nkingdom, he notes the properties of each mineral specimen, including\nwhere it was found along with its cause or causes. Next, he deals with\nrare stones, investigating the powers of these specimens along with\ntheir causes. He then produces an alphabetical list of a large number\nof these more precious stones. Throughout the treatise, Albert is\ncareful always to proceed from the effects or properties of the mineral\nworld to hypotheses concerning their causes. It is clear from his text\nthat he himself made a number of studies (experiments) with different\nminerals.\n\n\nNext, Albert studies the plant kingdom. In his Treatise on\nPlants (De vegetabilibus), as in his Treatise on\nMinerals, he combines his own observations with those of other\nauthorities, providing an alphabetical list of plants as he did for\nstones in his Treatise on Minerals. But he adds a long section\non the cultivation of plants. He makes the interesting observation that\nthe properties of certain plants are caused by celestial bodies. He\nalso indicates the medicinal properties of certain plants, although he\nis careful to point out that his principal concern is in understanding\nthe nature of plants based on a study of their properties and\nvirtues.\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s interest in the natural order concludes with his\ninvestigations of the final level of natural beings, the animal\nkingdom. His Treatise on Animals (De animalibus)\ninvolves Aristotle\u2019s studies of animals as well as material taken\nfrom Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9\u2019s encyclopedic On the Nature\nof Things (De natura rerum). But Albert inserts his own\nstudies of animals into the treatise. He investigates the causes of the\nproperties of different kinds of animals based on their operations and\npowers. Again, Albert organizes a kind of dictionary of animals based\non their various species, listed in alphabetical order as he had done\nin the other special sciences.\n\n\nIt seems to have been of considerable importance to Albert to do two\nthings in developing his scientific investigations. First, to review\nand organize the authorities in each of the branches of science and\nsecond to test by his own experience the claims made by these\nauthorities. In this way, he was careful to accommodate readers who\nwere used to consulting authorities instead of experience by providing\na context in which he could introduce his new findings.\n",
