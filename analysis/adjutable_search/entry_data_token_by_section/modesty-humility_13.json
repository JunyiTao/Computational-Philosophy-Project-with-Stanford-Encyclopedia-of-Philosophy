    "main_text": "Non-Doxastic Accounts || Attention\n3.5 Attention\n\n\nAttention accounts of modesty see it as rooted in patterns of\nmotivated conscious attention. Bommarito (2013) argues that being\nmodest is a matter of motivated inattention to one\u2019s own good\nqualities and attention to external factors that brought them about.\nIt\u2019s not that the modest person doesn\u2019t know about their\ngood qualities, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t think about them very\noften. And when they do think about them, they tend to emphasize the\nrole of situational factors in bringing them about, emphasizing things\nlike having good teachers, supportive parents, or fortunate\ncircumstances. A similar proposal is hinted at by Hastings Rashdall\nwhen he describes immodesty as \u201c\u2026 habitual dwelling with\nsatisfaction upon one\u2019s own capacities or one\u2019s own\nmerits\u201d (1907, 205).\n\n\nSuch habits of attention are compatible with, but do not require\nignorance. This view allows Bommarito (2013, 113) to highlight cases\nwhere uttering the sentence \u201cI am modest\u201d does not seem\nself-undermining as when others are publicly discussing one\u2019s\nmodesty and only an admission will allow the conversation to move on\nto other topics. He later discusses modesty as an \u201cinner\nvirtue\u201d that can be involuntary and lack any outward behavioral\nexpression; see Bommarito (2018, 160\u2013169).\n",
