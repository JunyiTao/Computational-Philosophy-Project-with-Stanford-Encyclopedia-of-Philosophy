    "main_text": "The Normativity of Law\n4. The Normativity of Law\n\nTraditional approaches to law treat legal rules as normative,\ni.e., as giving citizens reasons for action. These approaches present\ntwo philosophical questions: what is the nature of the reasons for\naction that law gives? and do individuals have a general obligation to\nobey the law? The first question is generally understood as asking\nwhether a legal rule provides a moral reason for action. The second\nquestion has been extensively examined in the legal and philosophical\nliterature. Murphy [2014] provides a clear perspective on this\nliterature.\n\nClaims (IV) and (V) assert that individuals respond to legal rules in\nan economic way. On classical economic accounts of rationality, an\neconomic response is a prudential rather than a moral response. Legal\nrules, on the economic account, thus do give individuals reasons to\nact, but they are not regarded as moral reasons. A traffic sign\ndesignating a street as within a school zone both indicates that\nchildren may dart into the street and sets a reduced speed limit. Each\nof these indication provides the agent with reasons for action. The\nrule thus affects the agent\u2019s behavior by affecting his beliefs\nabout the likelihood of a causing an injury when traveling at various\nspeeds and his beliefs about the expected costs of different courses\nof conduct. The sign and the legal rule give the agent prudential\nreasons for action. Economic analysis of law in its current form thus\nlargely adopts the Holmesian \u201cbad man\u201d theory of law.\n\nCritics of economic analysis of law contend that this failure to\naddress the normativity of law provides ample grounds on which to\nreject its adequacy as a theory of law. This argument, however, does\nnot satisfactorily address two questions.\n\nTo understand the first question, recall that, in the projects of\npolicy analysis and political economy, micro-economic theory serves as\na positive theory of behavior. For the critics\u2019 objection to\napply, then, the normativity of law must have behavioral implications.\nLegal obligation thus must influence behavior. Whether the economic\ntheory of behavior can accommodate legal normativity must depend on\nwhat behavior that normativity induces. \n\nPhilosophers, however, have not addressed this question. Their\ninvestigations of practical reason generally and of legal reasons in\nparticular typically understand their inquiry as setting the\nrequirements of practical rationality not as being an actual theory of\nbehavior.\n\nThe second question arises once the implications of legal normativity\nfor behavior have been identified. Can the economic theory of behavior\naccommodate the requisite normative behavior?\n\u201cAccommodation\u201d in this context means that economic theory\ncan generate models that predict the behavior that a legal obligation\ninduces. Clearly, standard economic models do not attempt to\naccommodate normativity. The economic theory of behavior, however, is\nvery flexible. Section 4.3 suggests some basic strategies that\neconomic theorists might adopt to accommodate normativity. \n\nTo set the stage for this analysis, we first set out a simple example\nof choice against which to assess different understandings of\nbehavior. We then consider why philosophers of law and lawyers\ngenerally might think that law provides non-prudential reasons for\naction.\n",
