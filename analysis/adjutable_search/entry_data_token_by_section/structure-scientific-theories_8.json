    "main_text": "The Semantic View\n3. The Semantic View\n\nAn overarching theme of the Semantic View is that analyzing theory\nstructure requires employing mathematical tools rather than predicate\nlogic. After all, defining scientific concepts within a specific\nformal language makes any axiomatizing effort dependent on the choice,\nnature, and idiosyncrasies of that narrowly-defined language. For\ninstance, Suppes understands first-order predicate logic, with its\n\u201clinguistic\u201d rather than \u201cset-theoretical\u201d\nentities, as \u201cutterly impractical\u201d for the formalization\nof \u201ctheories with more complicated structures like probability\ntheory\u201d (Suppes 1957, 232, 248\u20139; cf. Suppes 2002). Van\nFraassen, another influential defender of the Semantic View, believes\nthat the logical apparatus of the Syntactic View \u201chad moved us\nmille milles de toute habitation scientifique, isolated in\nour own abstract dreams\u201d (van Fraassen 1989, 225). Indeed, what\nwould the appropriate logical language for specific mathematical\nstructures be, especially when such structures could be reconstructed\nin a variety of formal languages? Why should we imprison mathematics\nand mathematical scientific theory in syntactically defined\nlanguage(s) when we could, instead, directly investigate the\nmathematical objects, relations, and functions of scientific theory?\n\n\nConsistent with the combat strategy (discussed in the Conclusion),\nhere is a list of grievances against the Syntactic View discussed at\nlength in the work of some semanticists.\n\nFirst-Order Predicate Logic Objection. Theoretical\nstructure is intrinsically and invariably tied to the specific choice\nof a language, \\(L_T\\), expressed in first-order predicate logic. This\nplaces heavy explanatory and representational responsibility on\nrelatively inflexible and limited languages.\nTheory Individuation Objection. Since theories are\nindividuated by their linguistic formulations, every change in\nhigh-level syntactic formulations will bring forth a distinct theory.\nThis produces a reductio: if \\(T_1 = p \\rightarrow q\\) and \\(T_2 =\n\\neg p \\vee q\\) then \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\), though logically equivalent,\nhave different syntactic formulations and would be distinct\ntheories.\nTheoretical/Observational Languages Objection. Drawing\nthe theoretical/observational distinction in terms of language is\ninappropriate, as observability pertains to entities rather than to\nconcepts.\nUnintended Models Objection. There is no clear way of\ndistinguishing between intended and unintended models for\nsyntactically characterized theories (e.g., the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem, Bays 2014).\nConfused Correspondence Rules Objection. Correspondence\nrules are a confused medley of direct meaning relationships between\nterms and world, means of inter-theoretic reduction, causal\nrelationship claims, and manners of theoretical concept testing.\nTrivially True yet Non-Useful Objection. Presenting\nscientific theory in a limited axiomatic system, while clearly\nsyntactically correct, is neither useful nor honest, since scientific\ntheories are mathematical structures.\nPractice and History Ignored Objection. Syntactic\napproaches do not pay sufficient attention to the actual practice and\nhistory of scientific theorizing and experimenting.\n\n\nWhat, then, does the Semantic View propose to put in the Syntactic\nView\u2019s place?\n",
