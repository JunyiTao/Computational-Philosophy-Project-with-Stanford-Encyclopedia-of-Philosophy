    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Argument from the Original Position: The Check for Stability\n4.8 The Argument from the Original Position: The Check for Stability\n\nHaving selected the two principles of justice as fairness, the parties\nturn to the second part of the original position: the check that these\nprinciples can order a society stably over time. The parties check,\nthat is, whether those who grow up under institutions arranged by\nthese principles will develop sufficient willingness to abide by them\nthat the principles can serve as the focus of an enduring overlapping\nconsensus.\n\nRawls argues that the parties will see that his two principles are\ncongruent with each citizen\u2019s good. Under the two principles,\nthe society\u2019s basic institutions affirm the freedom and equality\nof each citizen, giving a public basis for each citizen\u2019s\nself-respect. This public basis of self-respect is vital for citizens\nto be able to pursue their life plans with energy and confidence.\nCitizens will also see that the basic liberties allow sufficient\nsocial space for them to pursue their reasonable conceptions of the\ngood. Whether poor or rich, citizens will tend not to be envious or\nimperious, as they will see how the economy works toward the\nreciprocal advantage of all. And citizens may be satisfied by\nreflecting on the collective good that they can achieve with each\nother, by working together to maintain just institutions over\ntime.\n\nGiven that the two principles are congruent with citizens\u2019 good,\nRawls argues that it is reasonable to suppose that citizens will\ndevelop a desire to act in accordance with them. People become\nattached to people and institutions that they see benefiting them, and\nthe two principles create a social world in which each citizen can\npursue her own ends on a basis of mutual respect with other citizens.\nSince this is experienced as a good, the principles will gain\ncitizens\u2019 willing and stable allegiance. \u201cThe most stable\nconception of justice,\u201d Rawls says, \u201cis one that is\nperspicuous to our reason, congruent with our good, and rooted not in\nabnegation but in affirmation of the self\u201d (TJ,\n261).\n",
