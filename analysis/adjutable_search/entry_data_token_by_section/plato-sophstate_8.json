Not-Being and Being\n\n\nTo define the sophist as an expert in deception, as someone who \nproduces false appearances by means of statements, the Stranger needs\nto show that Parmenides was wrong; he needs to demonstrate that it is\npossible to say and to think that things-that-are-not are, and to do \nso without contradiction. He starts with a series of puzzles about \nnot-being and then suggests that we may be in similar confusion about\nbeing.\n",
