    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science || Economy and Unity of Science\n4.4 Economy and Unity of Science\n\n\nOne and the same view underlies both my epistemological-physical\nwritings and my present attempt to deal with the physiology of the\nsenses \u2014 the view, namely, that all metaphysical elements are to\nbe eliminated as superfluous and as destructive of the economy of\nscience. [AS: xxxviii]\n\n\nThe idea of an economy of nature dates back at least to Linnaeus, is\npresent throughout nineteenth century evolutionary ideas, and finds\nanother home in Mach. Nature is an organized and frugal\nsystem. Excess exists only in a vestigial sense; everything has\nits place. For Darwin, the economy of nature had a ready explanation in\nnatural selection, and the non-economical aspects of nature, such as\nvestigial organs, took on great significance. A logic of biology\ntook hold: where once economy was an observed feature of nature,\nit now became a necessary feature. Even the apparent\nnon-economical aspects were ultimately economical. Where once\neconomy required explanation, it now became the explanation. A\nphenomenon of nature turned into a force of nature. As is typical\nfor Mach, widely accepted biological principles become uncritically\nheld cornerstones of his epistemology.\n\n\nOf course, the metaphor of economy is also used in economics.\nAccording to Mach\u2019s own recollections of his intellectual\ndevelopment in a 1910 essay, \u201cThe Guiding Principles of My\nScientific Theory,\u201d he first understood science as\n\u2018okonomisch\u2019 in 1864, through discussions with his\nfriend E. Hermann, a political economist. In the same passage,\nMach proceeds to note that he was well prepared for this idea through\nhis biological background, and in fact the two combined to form what\nbecame his \u2018biological-economical theory of knowledge\u2019.\n[Mach 1910: 30\u201331]\n\n\nThe purpose of science is to give the most economical description of\nnature as possible, because science is to provide conceptions which can\nhelp us better orient ourselves to our world, and if science is\nuneconomical then it is useless in this regard. Put another way,\nMach\u2019s reason for insisting that economy must be a guiding\nprinciple in accepting or rejecting a theory is that uneconomical\ntheories cannot fulfill their biological function, which, as we have\nseen previously, he insists is (in a descriptive sense) the function of\nscience. The biological purpose of science is the improvement or\nthe better adaptation of memory in service of the organism\u2019s\ndevelopment:\n\n\nThe aim of scientific economy is to provide us with a picture of the\nworld as complete as possible \u2014 connected, unitary, calm and not\nmaterially disturbed by new occurrences: in short a world picture\nof the greatest possible stability. The nearer science approaches\nthis aim, the more capable will it be of controlling the disturbances\nof practical life, and thus serving the purpose out of which its\nfirst germs were developed. [PH: 336, italics\nadded]\n\n\nDisturbances in environments cause maladaptations; progressive\nadaptation only has meaning in reference to that which is stable.\nScience must be economical so that a stable basis for our orientation\ncan be built up, and this leads to a crucial point: as science\nencompasses more and more of the world, and as these theories work\nthemselves into our unconscious memory, more and more of the world\nbecomes part of our pre-existing cognitive structure. That is, the role\nof science is to improve our orientation to the world.\n\n\nLet us look in depth at a discussion of these issues occurring in\nScience and Mechanics in a chapter entitled \u201cThe Economy\nof Science.\u201d The section occurs toward the end of the book,\nand begins: \u201cIt is the object of science to replace, or\nsave experiences, by the reproduction and anticipation of\nfacts in thought. Memory is handier than experience, and often\nanswers the same purpose.\u201d [SM: 577] The\neconomical role of science is to allow us to understand and react to\nnature prior to experience; just as a newborn chicken knows what to do\nas soon as it is hatched due to its accumulated memory (it\ndoesn\u2019t need to learn on its own as the learning has already been\ndone by its ancestors), so we now learn from science how to anticipate\nthe world. Our memory encompasses more and more of the world,\nthus allowing better and better orientation.\n\n\nThe drive for economy is itself a biological instinct, which science\nmust thus also fulfill. In a larger sense, economy is tied to the\ninnate tendency toward survival or search for better orientation\ndiscussed earlier. Evolution is guided by these principles; life\nas a product of evolution has a tendency toward these principles, and\nwe as humans have these tendencies hard-wired into us\u2014even to the\npoint that our very conception of self-existence arises out of it; in\nAnalysis of Sensations, the ego is described as arising from\nan \u201cideal mental economical unity.\u201d [AS: 22]\n\n\nAn important application of this idea of economy occurs when two\ntheories, formerly separate, come in contact. For Mach this is a\ncentral concern: he is driven to unify psychology and\nphysics. At issue here is the economical requirement of needing a\nsingle orientating perspective: \u201cBut anyone who has in mind\nthe gathering up of the sciences into a single whole, has to look for a\nconception to which he can hold in every department of\nscience.\u201d [AS: 312] When theories come in\ncontact with each other, adaptation of one to the other must take\nplace: \u201cEpistemological criticism [is not a problem for the\nphysicist]. But when it is a question of bringing into connection\ntwo adjacent departments, each of which has been developed in its\nspecial way, the connection cannot be effected by means of the limited\nconceptions of a narrow special department. By means of more\ngeneral considerations, conceptions have to be created which shall be\nadequate for the wider domain.\u201d [AS: 313] It is\nuneconomical to have one theory for physics and another for psychology;\nthe mind demands that the two be brought together. Attempts at\nsuch mutual adaptation have so far been failures and Mach hopes that\nhis ideas can facilitate this:\n\n\nTo the physicist, qua physicist, the idea of \u201cbody\u201d\n\u2026 [assists in] a real facilitation of view, and is not the cause\nof disturbance\u2026. When, however, physics and psychology meet,\nthe ideas held in the one domain prove to be untenable in the\nother. From the attempt at mutual adaptation arise the various\natomic and monadistic theories \u2014 which, however, never attain\ntheir end. If we regard sensations, in the sense above defined\n(p. 13), as the elements of the world, the problems referred to appear\nto be disposed of in all essentials, and the first and most important\nadaptation to be consequently effected. This fundamental view\n(without any pretension to being a philosophy for all eternity) can at\npresent be adhered to in all fields of experience \u2026\n[AS: 32]\n\n\nThe inherent non-metaphysical unity of the physical and psychical is\nnot concocted, rather the disunity is what is artificial.\nMach\u2019s ideas on the unity of science, then, arise out of his\nbio-economical model of science.\n",
