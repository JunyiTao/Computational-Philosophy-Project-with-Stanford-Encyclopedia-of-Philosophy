With the development of this\ndiscourse, however, questions emerged as to what constitutes\n\u2018everyday\u2019 and \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in everyday\naesthetics. Inclusion of not only daily activities like eating,\ngrooming, dressing, and cleaning but also occasional and even rare\nevents such as parties, sporting events, holidays, weddings, and\ntravelling calls into question whether \u2018everyday\u2019 should\nbe understood literally. \n\nFurthermore, what may count as an everyday activity for one person may\nbe a special occasion for other people. Working on a farm constitutes\na farmer\u2019s everyday life, while it is a rare experience sought\nby a city dweller who participates in a tour that incorporates work\nexperience, such as a day working in a vineyard. Besides\npeople\u2019s occupation and lifestyle, diverse living environments\ndetermine what is included in their everyday life. For those residents\nin a densely populated urban area with a developed network of public\ntransportation, as well as for those living in different parts of the\nworld, riding in a car may be a rare occasion, while it is a daily\nroutine for many living in typical American suburbs. Finally, some\npeople\u2019s daily lives consist of constant travels, as in the case\nof a famed conductor, Valery Gergiev (Puolakka 2019).\n\nThe notion of \u2018everyday\u2019 thus becomes hopelessly unwieldy,\nand it is impossible to come up with a list of objects and activities\nthat belong to it. However, one could point to some core activities\nand objects that transcend individual and cultural differences, such\nas eating, dressing, grooming, shelter, and basic utilitarian objects,\nsuch as clothing, furniture, and eating implements (Melchionne 2013).\nThe most important factor for the purpose of everyday aesthetics,\nhowever, is not so much an inventory of objects and activities but\nrather the typical attitude we take toward them. We tend to experience\nthese objects and activities mostly with practical considerations that\neclipse their aesthetic potentials (Bullough 1912\u201313; Stolnitz\n1969; Ziff 1997). These experiences are generally regarded as\nordinary, commonplace, and routine. Such characterization may be the\nbest way to capture \u2018everyday,\u2019 allowing diverse\noccupations, lifestyles, and living environments that give rise to\ndifferent ingredients of everyday life. \n\nMany advocates of everyday aesthetics, however, also include rare,\nstandout, and more artistically-charged occasions in its scope. For\nexample, a holiday celebration is laden with all kinds of aesthetic\nconsiderations, ranging from interior and exterior decorations to\nspecial dishes, a carefully-arranged table setting and festive music.\nMany of us specifically attend to these aesthetic aspects both as\nproviders and as receivers, giving aesthetics a predominant role in\nthese experiences. In light of these different kinds of experiences,\nsome suggest allowing gradation among various objects and activities,\nwith one end designating the most quotidian objects and activities\nthat are experienced primarily with a practical mindset, and the other\nend those occasions standing out from daily life and marked by much\nmore conscious attention to the aesthetic dimension, rendering the\nexperience more like art appreciation (Naukkarinen 2013; Leddy\n2015).\n\nThus, recent discussion of the notion of everyday emphasizes\nrelationality and lability, a temporary framework that responds to\nspecific time and place, whether it regards the course of an\nindividual\u2019s life (such as a painting becoming a part of\none\u2019s everyday life after being purchased and hung on the living\nroom wall), or a general societal change, such as the increasing\npresence of the digital world today. Accordingly, the distinction\nbetween ordinary/extraordinary, familiar/unfamiliar, and\nevent-like/routine-like that dominate the discussion of everyday\nshould not be understood as something stationary, static, and fixed\n(Haapala 2017; Potgieter 2017).\n\nDebates surrounding what constitutes \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in\neveryday aesthetics are not unique to this discourse. The nature of\naesthetics has been a perennial point of contention in aesthetics at\nlarge, whether regarding fine arts, nature, popular culture or\neveryday objects and activities (see in particular the entries on the\nConcept of the Aesthetic and Dewey\u2019s Aesthetics). However, there\nare at least two points of particular interest and significance\nregarding the notion of \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in everyday\naesthetics. First is the status of bodily sensations. They can be felt\nby us as we receive sensory stimulation such as the wafting smell of\nbaked goods, the sensation of silk against our skin, the taste of\nsushi, or the feeling of massage. They can also result from bodily\nactivities, such as running, chopping vegetables, using tools, or\nmowing the lawn. The debate regarding whether or not these bodily\nsensations belong to the realm of aesthetics proper is not new. The\nbest-known classical treatment of this issue is Immanuel Kant\u2019s\ndistinction between the beautiful and the agreeable or the pleasant.\nMany contemporary art projects also give rise to this discussion\nthrough the creation of olfactory art, art happenings that include\ncooking and eating, and participatory art that requires the\naudience\u2019s bodily engagement. However, the issue becomes more\nacute with everyday aesthetics because our daily experience is\npermeated by sensory experiences and bodily activities (see Sections 7\nand 8 for further discussion).\n\nAnother important issue regarding the term \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in\neveryday aesthetics is the distinction between its honorific and\nclassificatory use. In both aesthetics discourse and common\nvernacular, the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 is generally used in the\nhonorific sense. Hence, something having an aesthetic property is\ngenerally regarded positively and gaining an aesthetic experience is\nunderstood to mean that it is a meaningful and satisfying experience.\nHowever, increasing number of everyday aestheticians return to the\nroot meaning of \u2018aesthetic\u2019 as sensory perception gained\nwith sensibility and imagination, whatever its evaluative valence may\nbe. Some things strike us with powerful positive aesthetic values, as\nin a great work of art or a spectacular landscape, while other things\ndo not affect us much because they are boring, non-descript, or plain.\nThen there are those objects and phenomena that offend or disturb us\nprofoundly because their sensuous appearance is hideous, monstrous, or\nappalling, without any overall redeeming value such as an artistic\nmessage. Everyday aesthetics casts a wide net for capturing these\ndiverse dimensions of our aesthetic life. It is noteworthy that in\nacademic discourses outside of philosophical aesthetics,\n\u2018aesthetics\u2019 is often regarded in the classificatory\nsense, such as the aesthetics of manners, which includes both polite\nand rude behaviors, and the aesthetics of politics which, among other\nthings, refers to the social and political construction of what counts\nas the sensible (Mandoki 2007; Ranci\u00e8re 2009; Vihalem\n2018).\n\nSome recent writers propose that everyday aesthetics will be better\nserved by characterizing the aesthetic as a specific mode of\nperception. Everyday aestheticians who emphasize the difference of\neveryday aesthetic experience from a typical experience of art tend to\ncharacterize the former\u2019s passivity and minimize the mediation\nof various conceptual considerations, emotional involvement, and\nimaginative engagement typically required in experiencing art. While\nit is agreed that the aesthetic is based upon our sensory perception,\nwithout a more active, creative, and imaginative involvement, those\ncritics point out, there is nothing distinctly aesthetic about mere\nsensations. One suggested solution is to characterize an aesthetic\nexperience as a dynamic and dialectic process of sensory perception\nand reflectivity that form aisthesis which leads to a\ndialogical relationship with the object we are perceiving (Matteucci\n2017). This more general theory of aesthetic perception will help\novercome the aforementioned two issues everyday aestheticians were\ngrappling with, namely inclusion of all sensory modes and rendering\nthe term valence-neutral. As will be discussed later in Section 8, one\nof the issues everyday aesthetics needs to determine is whether it\ncarves out an independent arena of aesthetics or it is rather a\ncontinuation of aesthetics that had been established with art as the\nprimary model. Those who advocate the continuity model argue that the\ndialogical mode of perception that integrates reflectivity provides\nthe specifically aesthetic character to everyday experience (Nielsen\n2005; Mateucci 2017; Potgieter 2017).\n",
