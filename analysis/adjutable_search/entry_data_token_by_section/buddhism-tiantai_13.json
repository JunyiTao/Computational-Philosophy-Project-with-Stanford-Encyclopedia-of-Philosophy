    "main_text": "Practice and Doctrinal Diversity\n5. Practice and Doctrinal Diversity\n\nTiantai is encyclopedic in its approach to Buddhist practice; as one\nmight expect in light of its view of \u201cexclusion\u201d in\ngeneral, it excludes nothing. Hence in Tiantai works we find\nextensive, detailed cataloging of a huge diversity of traditional\nBuddhist practices, from rituals and devotions to meditations and\ncontemplations of all kinds, derived from all strata of previous\nBuddhist culture. This accords not only with the philosophical\nobjection to the possibility of any final mutual exclusion of entities\nrehearsed above, but also to the Lotus Sutra notion of\nup\u0101ya, and the expansion of the range of Conventional\nTruth in the Three Truths: the diversity of sentient beings is\nlimitless, their specific delusions and attachments and sufferings are\nof limitless specific types, and thus the appropriate remedial\npractices and doctrines for them are limitless. This is also the\njustification for the \u201ctrivialist\u201d position that all\npossible claims are true, for \u201ctrue\u201d in the Tiantai\ncontext meansonly a remedial up\u0101ya serving as a raft to\novercome itself, but doing so by totalization of itself, thereby\nundermining itself, expressing itself in and as all other things,\nintersubsuming all other truth-claims, thereby become all the more\npresent as all the more absent.\n",
