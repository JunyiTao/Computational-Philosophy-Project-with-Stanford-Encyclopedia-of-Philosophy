On a\nworld-involving view, the mere fact that the agent is veridically\nperceiving means that the agent has a kind of justification that no\nhallucinating subject could have. Such a view is sometimes also\nreferred to as \u201cepistemological disjunctivism\u201d (Pritchard\n2012), though some proponents reject this label (Schellenberg 2018).\nOn this sort of view, the agent in the \u201cgood\u201d case\n(veridical perception) has the best sort of empirical evidence one\ncould hope for: the world itself is made manifest through perception;\nthe agent in the \u201cbad\u201d case (hallucination) has either no\njustification at all (Byrne 2014, 2016) or a different and presumably\ninferior kind of justification (Williamson 2000, Millar 2011, 2019,\nSchellenberg 2013, 2018).\n\nCommon to the various forms of epistemological disjunctivism is the\nidea that, normally, when you see a barn, you thereby know that\nthere\u2019s a barn in front of you. This can be understood in two\nvery different ways. On the \u201cevidential\u201d construal, the\nrelevant seeing is a non-doxastic, non-epistemic factive experiential\nstate, on which your belief that there\u2019s a barn is based. This\nstate can be understood along the lines of metaphysical disjunctivism\n (section 2.1.4,\n 2.3.3 above), as a world-involving relation of a subject to a\nperceptual object; or it can be understood as an internal (e.g.,\nrepresentational) state that has a different epistemic potency when\nit\u2019s veridical. On the \u201cconstitutive\u201d construal,\nyour seeing that there\u2019s a barn just is your knowing that\nthere\u2019s a barn, since seeing that p is a determinate of the\ndeterminable, knowing that p. The first kind of seeing is consistent\nwith the agent being in fake barn country (see entry on\n epistemology),\n or having good reasons to believe they\u2019re being deceived, or\nsuspending belief about whether there\u2019s a barn; the second kind\nof seeing\u2014assuming that defeaters and environmental luck block\nknowledge, and that knowledge requires belief\u2014is not.\n\nThe pioneer of this general approach is John McDowell (1982), although\nit is difficult to know just what view he endorses. There are hints of\nmetaphysical disjunctivism and an evidential construal of seeing,\nespecially in earlier writings, although he has long insisted that one\ndoes not see that there\u2019s a barn in fake barn country. One\npossibility is that McDowell\u2019s talk about seeing is simply a\nparticular kind of \u201cconclusive reason\u201d (in the sense of\nDretske 1971) (Graham and Pederson 2020).\n\nOne key motivation for a world-involving approach is the idea that if\nthe warrant (/evidence/justification) that we have in the good case is\nno different from the warrant we have in the bad case, then it must be\nin itself neutral between these possibilities and thus can\u2019t\njustify, say, the belief that there\u2019s a real table there, rather\nthan a hallucinated table\u2014at least, not without a hefty\ncontribution from background knowledge (McDowell 1982, 2011, 2018). A\nsecond motivation is the claim that some or all evidence is factive.\nSome epistemologists hold that all evidence is factive, in the sense\nthat only true things can serve as evidence (Williamson 2000,\nLittlejohn 2012, Byrne 2014); this would preclude hallucinations from\nconferring evidence on perceptual beliefs. Schellenberg (2013, 2018)\nargues that successful exercises of perceptual capacities yield a\nspecial, superior, kind of evidence\u2014\u201cfactive\nevidence\u201d\u2014which is absent in cases of hallucination,\nthough she thinks hallucinations do provide another kind of evidence\n (section 3.1.4\n above).\n\nDirect world-involvement theories tend to be instances of modest\nfoundationalism\n (section 3.1.4\n above), holding that perceptual knowledge and justification are\ndirect, and therefore denying the Metaevidential Principle, at least\nin a form that holds that the metaevidential knowledge/justification\nis prior to the perceptual knowledge/justification. Some\nproponents also reject the No-Good-Reason Claim, holding that in\nveridical perception, not only is the world manifest to us, but so is\nthat fact (Pritchard 2012, McDowell 2011), even though the good case\nand the bad case are in some sense indistinguishable. This would\nsupport a form of access internalism, though an unusual one and one\nthat some other internalists will find unsatisfactory (Smithies 2013).\nAlthough mentalist internalism is defined in terms of nonfactive\nmental states, McDowell\u2019s defense of epistemological\ndisjunctivism has always been motivated by a kind of internalism, and\nhe thinks that states of seeing, though factive, satisfy whatever\nneeds our internalist intuitions demand. Other versions of the view\nare staunchly externalist (Williamson 2000, Schellenberg 2013).\n\nThe biggest objection to this general approach is that it\ndoesn\u2019t allow or doesn\u2019t illuminate perceptual\njustification in cases of error, at least not in cases of\nhallucination. Those with more conventional internalist intuitions\nwill think that some or all hallucination victims will be just as\njustified as veridical perceivers (even though the former won\u2019t\nbe in a position thereby to know). In fact, the New Evil Demon\nobjection to reliabilism\n (section 3.1.6\n above, entry on\n reliabilist epistemology)\n takes this as an obvious starting point, and many externalists have\ncrafted or modified their theories to accommodate this intuition\n(Goldman 1986, 1988, Graham 2012). Some disjunctivists have tried to\nblunt the impact of this objection by suggesting that there\u2019s\nanother kind of justification or another route to justification\navailable in the bad case. Schellenberg (2013, 2018) allows that\nthere\u2019s a degree or dimension of justification available even in\nthe bad case; and Williamson (2000) suggests that sufficiently\nsophisticated hallucinators have introspective knowledge that things\nlook F, and this affords them inferential justification for thinking\nthat something is F.\n",
