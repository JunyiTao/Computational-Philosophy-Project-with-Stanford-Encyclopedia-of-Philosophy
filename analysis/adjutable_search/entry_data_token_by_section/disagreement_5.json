    "main_text": "Peer Disagreements || The Equal Weight View\n5.1 The Equal Weight View\n\n\nThe Equal Weight View is perhaps the most prominently discussed view\non the epistemic significance of disagreement. Competitor views of\npeer disagreements are best understood as a rejection of various\naspects of the Equal Weight View, so it is a fitting place to begin\nour examination. As we see it, the Equal Weight View is a combination\nof three claims:\n\n\nDefeat: Learning that a peer disagrees with you about \\(P\\)\ngives you a reason to believe you are mistaken about \\(P\\).\n\nEqual Weight: The reason to think you are mistaken about\n\\(P\\) coming from your peer\u2019s opinion about \\(P\\) is just as\nstrong as the reason to think you are correct about \\(P\\) coming from\nyour opinion about \\(P\\).\n\nIndependence: Reasons to discount your peer\u2019s opinion\nabout \\(P\\) must be independent of the disagreement itself.\n\n\n\nDefenses of the Equal Weight View in varying degrees can be found in\nBogardus 2009, Christensen 2007, Elga 2007, Feldman 2006, and Matheson\n2015a. Perhaps the best way to understand the Equal Weight View comes\nfrom exploring the motivation that has been given for the view. We can\ndistinguish between three broad kinds of support that have been given\nfor the view: examining central cases, theoretical considerations, and\nthe use of analogies. The central case that has been used to motivate\nthe Equal Weight View is Christensen\u2019s Restaurant Check\nCase.\n\nThe Restaurant Check Case. Suppose that five of us go out to\ndinner. It\u2019s time to pay the check, so the question we\u2019re\ninterested in is how much we each owe. We can all see the bill total\nclearly, we all agree to give a 20 percent tip, and we further agree\nto split the whole cost evenly, not worrying over who asked for\nimported water, or skipped desert, or drank more of the wine. I do the\nmath in my head and become highly confident that our shares are $43\neach. Meanwhile, my friend does the math in her head and becomes\nhighly confident that our shares are $45 each.  (Christensen 2007,\n193.)\n\n\nUnderstood as a case of peer disagreement, where the friends have a\ntrack record of being equally good at such calculation, and where\nneither party has a reason to believe that on this occasion either\nparty is especially sharp or dull, Christensen claims that upon\nlearning of the disagreement regarding the shares he should become\nsignificantly less confident that the shares are $43 and significantly\nmore confident that they are $45. In fact, he claims that these\ncompetitor propositions ought to be given roughly equal credence.\n\n\nThe Restaurant Check Case supports Defeat since in learning\nof his peer\u2019s belief, Christensen becomes less justified in his\nbelief. His decrease in justification is seen by the fact that he must\nlower his confidence to be in a justified position on the issue.\nLearning of the disagreement gives him reason to revise and an\nopportunity for epistemic improvement. Further, the Restaurant Check\nCase supports Equal Weight, since the reason Christensen\ngains to believe he is mistaken is quite strong. Since he should be\nequally confident that the shares are $45 as that they are $43, his\nreasons equally support these claims. Giving the peer opinions equal\nweight has typically been understood to require \u2018splitting the\ndifference\u2019 between the peer opinions, at least when the two\npeer opinions exhaust one\u2019s evidence about the opinions on the\nmatter.  Splitting the difference is a kind of doxastic compromise\nthat calls for the peers to meet in the middle. So, if one peer\nbelieves \\(P\\) and one peer disbelieves \\(P\\), giving the peer\nopinions equal weight would call for each peer to suspend judgment\nabout \\(P\\). Applied to the richer doxastic picture that includes\ndegrees of belief, if one peer as a 0.7 degree of belief that \\(P\\)\nand the other has a 0.3 degree of belief that \\(P\\), giving the peer\nopinions equal weight will call for each peer to adopt a 0.5 degree of\nbelief that \\(P\\). It is important to note that what gets\n\u2018split\u2019 is the peer attitudes, not the content of the\nrelevant propositions. For instance, in the Restaurant Check Case,\nsplitting the difference does not require believing that the shares\nare $44. Perhaps it is obvious that the shares are not an even amount.\nSplitting the difference is only with respect to the disparate\ndoxastic attitudes concerning any one proposition (the disputed target\nproposition). The content of the propositions believed by the parties\nare not where the compromise occurs. Finally, the Restaurant Check\nCase supports Independence. The reasons that Christensen\ncould have to discount his peer\u2019s belief about the shares could\ninclude that he had a little too much to drink tonight, that he is\nespecially tired, that Christensen double checked but his friend\ndidn\u2019t, etc., but could not include that the shares actually are\n$43, that Christensen disagrees, etc.\n\n\nTheoretical support for the Equal Weight View comes from first\nthinking about ordinary cases of testimony. Learning that a reliable\ninquirer has come to believe a proposition gives you a reason to\nbelieve that proposition as well. The existence of such a reason does\nnot seem to depend upon whether you already have a belief about that\nproposition. Such testimonial evidence is some evidence to believe the\nproposition regardless of whether you agree, disagree, or have never\nconsidered the proposition. This helps motivate Defeat, since\na reason to believe the proposition when you disbelieve it amounts to\na reason to believe that you have made a mistake regarding that\nproposition. Similar considerations apply to more fine-grained degrees\nof confidence. Testimonial evidence that a reliable inquirer has\nadopted a 0.8 degree of belief that \\(P\\) gives you a reason to adopt\na 0.8 degree of belief toward \\(P\\), and this seems to hold regardless\nof whether you already have a level of confidence that \\(P\\).\n\nEqual Weight is also motivated by considerations regarding\ntestimonial evidence. The weight of a piece of testimonial evidence is\nproportional to the epistemic position of the testifier (or what the\nhearer\u2019s evidence supports about the epistemic position of the\ntestifier). So, if you have reason to believe that Jai\u2019s\nepistemic position with respect to \\(P\\) is inferior to Mai\u2019s,\nthen discovering that Jai believes \\(P\\) will be a weaker reason to\nbelieve \\(P\\) than discovering that Mai believes \\(P\\). However, in\ncases of peer disagreement, both parties are in an equally good\nepistemic position, so it would follow that their opinions on the\nmatter should be given equal weight.\n\n\nFinally, Independence has been theoretically motivated by\nexamining what kind of reasoning its denial would permit. In\nparticular, a denial of independence has been thought to permit a\nproblematic kind of question-begging by allowing one to use\none\u2019s own reasoning to come to the conclusion that their peer is\nmistaken.  Something seems wrong with the following line of reasoning,\n\u201cMy peer believes not-\\(P\\), but I concluded \\(P\\), so my peer\nis wrong\u201d or \u201cI thought \\(S\\) was my peer, but \\(S\\)\nthinks not-\\(P\\), and I think \\(P\\), so \\(S\\) is not my peer after\nall\u201d (see Christensen (2011). Independence forbids both of these\nways of blocking the reason to believe that you are mistaken from the\ndiscovery of the disagreement.\n\n\nThe Equal Weight View has also been motivated by way of analogies.  Of\nparticular prominence are analogies to thermometers. Thermometers take\nin pieces of information as inputs and given certain temperature\nverdicts as outputs. Humans are a kind of cognitive machine that takes\nin various kinds of information as inputs and give doxastic attitudes\nas outputs. In this way, humans and thermometers are\nanalogous. Support for the Equal Weight View has come from examining\nwhat it would be rational to believe in a case of peer thermometer\ndisagreement. Suppose that you and I know we have equally reliable\nthermometers and while investigating the temperature of the room we\nare in discover that our thermometers give different outputs (yours\nreads \u201875\u2019 and mine reads \u201872\u2019). What is it\nrational for us to believe about the room temperature? It seems it\nwould be irrational for me to continue believing it was 72 simply\nbecause that was the output of the thermometer that I was\nholding. Similarly, it seems irrational for me to believe that your\nthermometer is malfunctioning simply because my thermometer gave a\ndifferent output. It seems that I would need some information\nindependent from this \u2018disagreement\u2019 to discount your\nthermometer. So, it appears that I have been given a reason to believe\nthat the room\u2019s temperature is not 72 by learning of your\nthermometer, that this reason is as strong as my reason to believe it\nis 72, and that this reason is only defeated by independent\nconsiderations. If the analogy holds, then we have reason to accept\neach of the three theses of the Equal Weight View.\n\n\nThe Equal Weight View is not the only game in town when it comes to\nthe epistemic significance of disagreement. In what follows we will\nexamine the competitor views of disagreement highlighting where and\nwhy they depart from the Equal Weight View.\n",
