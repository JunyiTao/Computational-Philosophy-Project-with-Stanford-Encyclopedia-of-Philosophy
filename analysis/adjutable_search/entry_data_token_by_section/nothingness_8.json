    "main_text": "The problem of multiple nothings\n9. The problem of multiple nothings\n\nMany of the principles used to rule out total emptiness also preclude\nsmall pockets of emptiness. Leibniz says that the actual world must\nhave something rather than nothing because the actual world must be\nthe best of all possible worlds, and something is better than nothing.\nBut by the same reasoning, Leibniz concludes there are no vacuums in\nthe actual world: more is better than less.\n\nLeibniz also targets the possibility of there being more than one\nvoid. If there could be more than one void, then there could be two\nvoids of exactly the same shape and size. These two voids would be\nperfect twins; everything true of one void would be true of the other.\nThis is precluded by the principle of the identity of indiscernibles:\nif everything true of x is true of y, then\nx is identical to y.\n\nA second problem with multiple voids arises from efforts to paraphrase\nthem away. From the time of Melissus, there have been arguments\nagainst the possibility of a void existing in the manner that an\nobject exists: \u201cNor is there any void, for void is nothing, and\nnothing cannot be.\u201d (Guthrie 1965, 104) If you say there is a\nvacuum in the flask, then you are affirming the existence of something\nin the flask\u2014the vacuum. But since \u2018vacuum\u2019 means an\nabsence of something, you are also denying that there is something in\nthe flask. Therefore, \u2018There is a vacuum in the flask\u2019 is\na contradiction.\n\nSome react to Melissus\u2019s argument by analyzing vacuums as\nproperties of things rather than things in their own right. According\nto C. J. F. Williams (1984, 383), \u2018There is a vacuum in the\nflask\u2019 should be rendered as \u2018The flask noths\u2019. He\ndoes this in the same spirit that he renders \u2018There is fog in\nWinchester\u2019 as \u2018Winchester is foggy\u2019 and\n\u2018There is a smell in the basement\u2019 as \u2018The basement\nsmells\u2019.\n\nIf this paraphrase strategy works for vacuums, it ought to work for\nthe more prosaic case of holes. Can a materialist believe that there\nare holes in his Swiss cheese? The holes are where the matter is not.\nSo to admit the existence of holes is to admit the existence of\nimmaterial objects!\n\nOne response is to paraphrase \u2018There is a hole in the\ncheese\u2019 as \u2018The cheese holes\u2019 or, to be a bit easier\non the ear, as \u2018The cheese is perforated\u2019. What appeared\nto be a wild existential claim has been domesticated into a comment on\nthe shape of the cheese.\n\nBut how are we to distinguish between the cheese having two holes as\nopposed to one? (Lewis and Lewis 1983, 4) Well, some cheese is singly\nperforated, some cheese is doubly-perforated, yet other cheese is\nn-perforated where n equals the number of holes in\nthe cheese.\n\nWhoa! We must be careful not to define\n\u2018n-perforation\u2019 in terms of holes; that would\nre-introduce the holes we set out to avoid.\n\nCan holes be evaded by confining ourselves to the process of\nperforation? Single-hole punchers differ from triple-hole punchers by\nhow they act; singlely rather than triply.\n\nThe difficulty with this process-oriented proposal that the product, a\nhole, is needed to distinguish between successful and merely attempted\nperforation. Furthermore, the paraphrase is incomplete because it does\nnot extend to holes that arise from processes such as looping. If the\nuniverse popped into existence five minutes ago, then most holes\nformed without any process.\n\nCan we just leave expressions of the form\n\u2018n-perforated\u2019 as primitive, unanalyzed shape\npredicates? David and Stephanie Lewis (1983) note that this strands us\nwith an infinite list of primitive terms. Such a list could never have\nbeen memorized. The Lewises do not see how\n\u2018n-perforated\u2019 can be recursively defined without\nalluding to holes.\n\nThe paraphrase prospects seem equally bleak for being\n\u2018n-vacuumed\u2019. Big meteorites pass through the\natmosphere in about one second leaving a hole in the\natmosphere\u2014a vacuum in \u201cthin air\u201d. The air cannot\nrush in quickly enough to fill the gap. This explains why rock vapor\nfrom the impact launches back up into the atmosphere and later rains\ndown widely on the surface. During a meteorite shower, the atmosphere\nis multiply vacuumed. But this is just to say that there are many\nvacuums in the atmosphere.\n",
