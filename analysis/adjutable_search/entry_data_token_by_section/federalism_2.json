    "main_text": "History of Federalism || Some global perspectives\n2.1 Some global perspectives\n\nWe find federal modes of political organisation on many continents,\nand contributions to theories about federalism in written sources\nacross philosophical traditions. A range of philosophical\ncontributions underscore that federal perspectives can apply to a wide\nrange of units other than the sovereign states central in European and\nU.S. thought.\n\nThe tribal organisation of the M\u0101ori in what is now New Zealand\nincluded family groups (whanau), who would work together and\ncollaborate for defense as a clan (hap\u016b). The tribe\n(iwi) would in turn operate as a federation among several\nhap\u016b for common defense (Ballara 1998, 19).\n\nSeveral extinct African societies had federal elements. Edward Wamala\ndescribes what we recognise as federal features in pre-14th century\nGanda society, in what later became the kingdom of the Baganda, now\npart of Uganda. The power structures between the chief\n(ssabataka) and heads of tribes (mutaka) was one of\nprimus inter pares. The tribes enjoyed immunity, in that the\nhigher units should no usurp the responsibilities of the lower units\nof power but only promote the well-being of the lower units (Wamala\n2004: 436\u2013437)\n\nNahua (Aztek) culture illustrates multi-level federalism: Tlaxilacalli\n- badly translated and understood as \u201cneighbourhoods\u201d -\nwould submit to the authority of the sovereign local polity, or\naltepetl, which then scaled up to autonomous mega-provinces\n(huei altepetl) and finally to the entire empire. At each\nlevel, submission was traded for autonomy, undercutting any attempt at\ndirect centralising rule (Johnson 2017). In the 1428 triple alliance\nfor military purposes among the three city-states (altepeme)\nof Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Totoquihuatzin, each of these rules over\ntheir dependent altepetl without interference by the other\ntwo (Lockhart 1992).\n\nThe Confucian political philosopher Mencius (379\u2013298 BC) laid\nout a three level \u2018familial\u2019 order (Chan 2003). The family\nhad primary responsibility for those unable to care for themselves,\nand rulers should be the parents of the people. (Mencius 2003, 1B.13).\nWhen the family could not assist, the community network\nshould provide support. Only when the community was unable\nwould what we might call the state have an obligation to\naid.\n\nWe find expressions of federalism in the third pillar of Islam:\nObligatory charity in the form of zakat provided to certain\nneedy persons outside one\u2019s own household (Qur\u2019an 9: 103).\nEvery able Muslim must provide a fixed proportion of their net\nwealth\u20142.5%\u2014to support others in need. The role of the\nstate may vary when it comes to assess, collect and distribute zakat.\nIn some states, the collection or distribution of zakat is the\nresponsibility of civil society organisations or mosques. In other\nstates, it is the government\u2019s responsibility to either ensure\nthat zakat is managed if Muslims fail to pay; or the whole system may\nbe managed by the state (Bilo and Mechado 2018).\n\nThe sub-Saharan philosophy of Ubuntu has federal features that have\nalso contributed to legal theory. The term \u2018Ubuntu\u2019 stems\nfrom the Nguni phrase \u201cUmuntu ngumuntu ngabantu\u201d\nmeaning a person is a person through other persons. Ubuntu emphasises\nthe harmonious relationships between persons as constitutive of the\nindividual, underscoring compassion and commitment to one\nanother\u2019s growth (Mbiti 1969, G\u00e4deke 2019, Metz 2011). The\ntask of governments at various territorial levels is to promote\nharmonious flourishing and community of the constituent parts (Shutte\n2001). Ubuntu was included in the epilogue of the 1993 Interim\nConstitution of South Africa, but not explicitly in its 1996\nConstitution.\n\nThe confederacy among five (later six) Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)\nnations dates back to between the 12th and 15th century. The oral\nconstitution\u2014The Great Law of Peace\u2014specified that each\nnation elected delegates, or sachems, who dealt with internal\naffairs. The confederacy\u2019s Grand Council could not interfere\nwith the internal affairs of each tribe, but would discuss particular\nmatters of common concern such as war, peace, and treaty making. The\nHaudenosaunee practice of granting the member units immunity\napparently influenced Benjamin Franklin\u2019s and others\u2019 call\nfor a union among the English colonies (Fenton 1998). Iris Marion\nYoung explored this tradition to develop a theory of federalism that\nwould secure immunity and redress power imbalances (Young 2000; Levy\n2008).\n",
