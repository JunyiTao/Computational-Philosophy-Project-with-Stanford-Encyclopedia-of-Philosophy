But questions\nabout the reality and nature of artifact kinds also arise for those\nwho do take artifacts to exist. As we have seen, these theorists\nresist the objection that the mind-dependence of artifacts compromises\ntheir ontological status. But this objection resurfaces with regard to\nartifact kinds. The mind-dependence of artifacts implies, at a\nminimum, that an account of artifact kinds will be very different from\nan account of natural kinds. This implication is resisted by Crawford\nElder (2004; 2007), who seeks to establish the existence of\nartifacts on the basis of a realist account of kinds. On Elder\u2019s\nview, artifact kinds and many natural kinds are equally copied kinds,\nand equally mind-independent. A copied kind is defined by a set of\nproperties that naturally cluster together\u2014a distinctive shape\nor make-up, a proper function established by a mechanism that copies\nthings of that shape on the basis of successful performance, and a\nhistorically proper placement. For example, cats\u2019 whiskers are\ndistinctively shaped organs that are copied from cat to cat by a\nbiologically based reproductive mechanism because they help cats get\naround in the dark by performing successfully as touch receptors\nstrategically located with respect to the cat\u2019s other bodily\nparts. Similarly, floor lamps are distinctively shaped artifacts that\nare copied from household to household by a socially based\nreproductive mechanism because they help humans get around in the dark\nby performing successfully as light sources strategically located with\nrespect to other household furniture. Human intentional states do, of\ncourse, figure in the copying process for artifacts. However, Elder\nargues:\n\n\n[C]reation does not begin with the artisan\u2019s intending what he\ndoes. Rather, the essential properties that his product will inherit\nstem from a history of function and of copying that began well before\nthe artisan undertook his work. This history reaches forward through\nthe artisan\u2019s motions\u2014it shapes his shaping. Its existence\nand its efficacy are independent, largely or even entirely, of the\nartisan\u2019s will. (Elder 2004, 142\u2013143)\n\n\nAll copied kinds are thus natural, mind-independent kinds whose\nclustered features we discover rather than invent.\n\nOne acknowledged problem with Elder\u2019s account is that many\nerstwhile artifact kinds turn out not to be copied kinds. Neckties,\nfor example, do not qualify because they do not appear to have a\nproper function (Elder 2004, 158\u2013159). But his account does\nhave the virtue of drawing out useful analogies between natural kinds\nand artifact kinds. A number of other accounts also focus on analogies\nbetween (at least some) natural kinds and (at least some) artifact\nkinds (Lowe 2014; Franssen & Kroes 2014). The underlying motive\nfor pushing this analogy, clearly, is the fear that artifact kinds are\nnot real if human intentional states and/or classificatory practices\nare constitutive of what kinds there are.\n\nAmie Thomasson does not share this fear. In a series of important\npapers (2003; 2007b; 2014), she points out that realists\nabout kinds are not, in fact, forced to choose between showing that\nartifact kinds can be understood on the mind-independent model of\nnatural kinds, or denying that artifact kinds are real. There is a\nthird option\u2014denying that mind-independence is the touchstone of\nreality. Thomasson then builds human intentions and their historical\nconnections into her account of artifact kinds.\n\n\nNecessarily, for all x and all artifactual kinds K,\nx is a K only if x is the product of a\nlargely successful intention that (Kx), where one intends\n(Kx) only if one has a substantive concept of the nature of\nKs that largely matches that of some group of prior makers of\nKs (if there are any) and intends to realize that concept by\nimposing K-relevant features on the object. (Thomasson\n2003, 600)\n\n\nThus for Thomasson, human intentions and concepts are actually\nconstitutive of artifact kinds. Thomasson (2014) also objects to the\ncommon assumption that concepts of artifact kinds revolve exclusively\naround intended function. While it is true that in\nEnglish we often label artifact kinds in accordance with\nfunction\u2014flashlight, bedspread, pincushion, frying pan, and so\non\u2014artifacts actually have an array of features that figure in\ntheir concepts. These include structural or perceptible features, for\nexample, that are also often reflected in our terms\u2014armchair,\ntripod, zebra crossing (definitely not a function designation!), fork,\nand so on. Most importantly for Thomasson, they also include normative\nfeatures concerned with how that kind of artifact is to be treated or\nregarded. Although sponges and paper towels can both be used to wipe\nup spills, it is normal to dispose of the paper towel, but to clean\nthe sponge and reuse it.\n\nA distinct approach to artifact kinds is proposed by Thomas Reydon\n(2014). He points out that the nature of natural kinds is currently in\nplay in philosophy of science. Their mind-independence is\ntraditionally predicated on their having essences. But essentialism\nran into trouble when Darwin showed that species\u2014up to that\npoint the very paradigm of natural kinds\u2014are historically fluid\nand have no clear boundaries. Similar problems have now been\nrecognized even in the kinds of chemistry and physics (Khalidi 2013).\nNevertheless, grouping natural objects into kinds does license useful\ninferences and ground successful explanations. This has led to what\nReydon calls an \u201cepistemological turn\u201d.\n\n\nThe principal criteria for being a natural kind used to be\nmetaphysical: a kind is a natural kind if and only if it really exists\nin the world\u2026independently of human consciousness, human\ninterests, and human practices, and is associated with a particular\nkind essence\u2026. On the alternative approach the principal\ncriteria for being a natural kind no longer are metaphysical but\nepistemological: what counts is being useful in human\nepistemic practices, such as inference and explanation, by\ncorresponding in some way (which is still to be explicated)\nto the state of affairs in nature. (Reydon 2014, 132)\n\n\nRather than assimilating artifact kinds to natural kinds by showing\nthat artifacts are actually mind-independent in some way, as Elder and\nothers have tried to do, the epistemological turn suggests that since\nnatural kinds were never mind-independent to begin with, there is in\nprinciple no barrier to a unified account of artifact and natural\nkinds.\n\nFinally, we should note that questions have been raised about the\nlegitimacy of the kind\u2014or perhaps more precisely, the\ncategory\u2014\u201cartifact\u201d itself. We have already touched\non this in\n Section 1\n above, in the context of the definitional issues raised by the\ncontinuum problem. This discussion clearly reflects Reydon\u2019s\nepistemological turn in that it foregrounds methodological\nconsiderations and lets the ontological chips fall where they may. We\nwill discuss methodological issues in\n Section 3.\n",
