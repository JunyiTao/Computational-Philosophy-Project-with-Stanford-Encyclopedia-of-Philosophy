The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s PhD dissertation of 1813, The Fourfold Root\nof the Principle of Sufficient Reason, examines what many\nphilosophers have recognized as an innate tendency to assume that in\nprinciple, the universe is a thoroughly understandable place. His\ndissertation, in effect, critically examines the disposition to assume\nthat what is real is what is rational. A century earlier, G.W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) had defined the principle of this assumption \u2013\nthe principle of sufficient reason \u2013 in his Monadology\n(1714) as that which requires us to acknowledge that there is no fact\nor truth that lacks a sufficient reason why it should be so, and not\notherwise.\n\nAlthough the principle of sufficient reason might seem to be\nself-evident, it does yield surprising results. For example, we can\nappeal to this principle to argue that there can be no two individuals\nexactly alike, because there would otherwise be no sufficient reason\nwhy one of the individuals was in one place, while the other\nindividual was in another. The principle also supports the argument\nthat the physical world was not created at any point in time, since\nthere is no sufficient reason why it would be created at one point in\ntime rather than another, since all points in time are qualitatively\nthe same. Moreover, if the principle of sufficient reason\u2019s\nscope of applicability is assumed to be limitless, then there is a\ndefinite answer to the question, \u201cWhy is there something, rather\nthan nothing?\u201d Schopenhauer was keen to question the universal\nextension of the principle of sufficient reason, mainly owing to his\nadvocacy of Kant\u2019s view that human rationality lacks the power\nto answer metaphysical questions, since our knowledge is limited by\nour specific and narrowly-circumscribed capacities for organizing our\nfield of sensation.\n\nSchopenhauer observed as an elementary condition, that to employ the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, we must think about something specific\nthat stands in need of explanation. This indicated to him that at the\nroot of our epistemological situation, we must assume the presence of\na subject that thinks about some object to be\nexplained. From this, he concluded that the general root of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason is the distinction between subject and\nobject that must be presupposed as a condition for the very enterprise\nof looking for explanations (The Fourfold Root, Section 16)\nand as a condition for knowledge in general. \n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s claim that the subject-object distinction is the\nmost general condition for human knowledge has its theoretical source\nin Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, for Kant similarly\ngrounded his own theory of knowledge upon a highly-abstracted,\nformalized, and universalized subject-object distinction. Kant\ncharacterized the subjective pole of the distinction as the\ncontentless transcendental unity of self-consciousness and the\nobjective pole as the contentless transcendental object that\ncorresponds to the concept of an object in general (CPR, A\n109). The general root of the principle of sufficient reason, as\nSchopenhauer characterizes it, is at the root of Kant\u2019s\nepistemology as well. \n\nFollowing the demanding conceptions of knowledge typical of his time\nthat had been inspired by Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s\n(1596\u20131650) quest for certainty (see Descartes\u2019s\n\u201cmethod of doubt\u201d and his \u201ccogito\u201d\n[Latin, for \u201cI think\u201d]), Schopenhauer maintained that if\nany explanation is to be genuine, then whatever is explained cannot be\nthought to have arisen by accident, but must be regarded as having\nbeen necessary. Schopenhauer\u2019s investigation into the principle\nof sufficient reason can thus be alternatively characterized as an\ninquiry into the nature of the various kinds of necessary connection\nthat can arise between different kinds of objects.\n\nInspired by Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the four basic kinds of\nexplanatory reason or four [be]causes (Physics, Book II,\nChapter 3), Schopenhauer defines four kinds of necessary connection\nthat arise within the context of seeking explanations, and he\ncorrespondingly identifies four independent kinds of objects in\nreference to which explanations can be given: \n\nmaterial things\nabstract concepts\nmathematical and geometrical constructions\npsychologically-motivating forces\n\n\nCorresponding to these four kinds of objects, Schopenhauer links in\nparallel, four different kinds of reasoning. He associates material\nthings with reasoning in terms of cause and effect; abstract concepts\nwith reasoning in terms of logic; mathematical and geometrical\nconstructions with reasoning in reference to numbers and spaces; and\nmotivating forces with reasoning in reference to intentions, or what\nhe calls moral reasoning. In sum, he identifies the general root of\nthe principle of sufficient reason as the subject-object distinction\nin conjunction with the thought of necessary connection, and the\nfourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason as the\nspecification of four different kinds of objects for which we can seek\nexplanations, in association with the four independent styles of\nnecessary connection along which such explanations can be given,\ndepending upon the different kinds of objects involved.\n\nOne of Schopenhauer\u2019s most significant assertions is that the\nfour different modes of explanation only run in parallel with each\nother, and cannot coherently be intermixed. If we begin by choosing a\ncertain style of explanation, then we immediately choose the kinds of\nobject to which we can refer. Conversely, if we begin by choosing a\ncertain kind of object to explain, we are obliged to use the style of\nreasoning associated with that kind of object. It thus violates the\nrationality of explanation to confuse one kind of explanation with\nanother kind of object. We cannot begin with a style of explanation\nthat involves material objects and their associated cause-and-effect\nrelationships, for example, and then argue to a conclusion that\ninvolves a different kind of object, such as an abstract concept.\nLikewise, we cannot begin with abstract conceptual definitions and\naccordingly employ logical reasoning for the purposes of concluding\nour argumentation with assertions about things that exist.\n\nWith this set of regulations about what counts as a legitimate way to\nconduct explanations, Schopenhauer ruled out the often-cited and\n(especially during his time) philosophically often-relied-upon\ncosmological and ontological arguments for God\u2019s existence, and\nalong with them, all philosophies that ground themselves upon such\narguments. He was adamant that the German Idealist outlooks of Fichte,\nSchelling and Hegel rested upon explanatory errors of this kind, and\nhe regarded those outlooks as fundamentally wrongheaded styles of\nthought, for he saw their philosophies as being specifically grounded\nupon versions of the ontological argument for God\u2019s existence.\nHis frequent condemnation of German Idealism was advanced in light of\nwhat he considered to be sound philosophical reasons, despite his uncompromising ad hominem attacks on Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, who he described repeatedly as \u201chumbugs\u201d and \u201ccharlatans.\u201d\n",
