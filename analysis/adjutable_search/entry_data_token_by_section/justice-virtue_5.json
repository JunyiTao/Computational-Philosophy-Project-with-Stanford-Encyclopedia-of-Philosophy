    "main_text": "Recent Developments\n6. Conclusion\n\nThere are many different conceptions of the virtue of justice, and\nonly some of them are distinctively virtue ethical. Many non-virtual\nethical approaches put forward theories of virtue, and what\ndistinguishes them from virtue ethics is that the given theory of\nvirtue comes later in the order of explanation, rather than itself\nserving as the basis for understanding (all of) morality. This is\nespecially the case with justice, where (as we have seen) it is\nnaturally tempting to account for the norms of justice first\nand derive an account of the virtue in light of those norms.\nThe question of the priority of norms of justice or the virtue of\njustice is likely to continue to generate exploration and debate, as\nis the question of how our lives as social and political animals\ncontributes to understanding the virtue of justice. These vexed\nquestions have inspired a profusion of views and no doubt will\ncontinue to do so. \n",
