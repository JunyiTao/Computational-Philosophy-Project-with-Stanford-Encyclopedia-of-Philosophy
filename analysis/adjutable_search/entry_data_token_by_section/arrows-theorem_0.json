    "main_text": "The Will of the People?\n1. The Will of the People?\nSome of the trouble with social orderings is visible in a simple\nbut important example. Say there are three\nalternatives \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to choose\namong. There is a group of three people 1, 2 and 3 whose preferences\nare to inform this choice, and they are asked to rank the alternatives\nby their own lights from better to worse. Their individual preference\norderings turn out to be:\n\nABC\nBCA\nCAB\n\nThat is, person 1 prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\),\nprefers \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and prefers \\(A\\)\nto \\(C\\); person 2 prefers \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and so\non. Now, we might hope somehow to arrive at a single\n\u201csocial\u201d ordering of the alternatives that reflects the\npreferences of all three. Then we could choose whichever alternative\nis, socially, best\u2014or, if there is a tie for first place, we\ncould choose some alternative that is as good as any other. Suppose,\ntaking the alternatives pair by pair, we put the matter to a vote: we\ncount one alternative as socially preferred to another if\nthere are more voters who prefer it than there are who prefer the\nother one. We determine in this way that \\(A\\) is socially\npreferred to \\(B\\), since two voters (1 and 3) prefer \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\), but only one (voter 2) prefers \\(B\\)\nto \\(A\\). Similarly, there is a social preference for \\(B\\)\nto \\(C\\). We might therefore expect to find that \\(A\\) is\nsocially preferred to \\(C\\). By this reckoning, though, it is\njust the other way around, since there are two voters who\nprefer \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). We do not have a\nsocial ordering of the alternatives at all. We have\na cycle. Starting from any alternative, moving to a socially\npreferred one, and from there to the next, you soon find\nyourself back where you \nstarted.[1]\nThis is the \u201cparadox of voting\u201d. Discovered by the\nMarquis de Condorcet (1785), it shows that possibilities for\nchoosing rationally can be lost when individual preferences are\naggregated into social preferences. Voter 1 has \\(A\\) at the top\nof his individual ordering. This voter\u2019s preferences can\nbe maximized, by choosing \\(A\\). The preferences of 2 or\n3 can also be maximized, by choosing instead their maxima, \\(B\\)\nor \\(C\\). Pairwise majority decision doesn\u2019t result in a social\nmaximum, though. \\(A\\) isn\u2019t one because a majority prefers\nsomething else, \\(C\\).  Likewise, \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are\nnot social maxima. The individual preferences lend themselves to\nmaximization; but, because they cycle, the social preferences do\nnot.\nAre there other aggregation procedures that are better than\npairwise majority decision, or do the different ones have shortcomings\nof their own? Condorcet, his contemporary Jean Charles de Borda\n(1781), and later Charles Dodgson (1844) and Duncan Black (1948),\namong others, all addressed this question by studying various\nprocedures and comparing their properties. Arrow broke new ground by\ncoming at it from the opposite direction. Starting with various\nrequirements that aggregation procedures might be expected to meet, he\nasked which procedures fill the bill. Among his requirements\nis Social Ordering, which insists that the result of\naggregation is always an ordering of the alternatives, never a\ncycle. After the introduction in\n Section 2 of\nthe technical framework that Arrow set up in order to study social\nchoice,\n Section 3.1 sets out further conditions\nthat he imposed. Briefly, these are: Unrestricted Domain\nwhich says that aggregation procedures must be able to handle any\nindividual preferences at all; Weak Pareto, which requires\nthem to respect unanimous individual\npreferences; Non-Dictatorship, which rules out procedures by\nwhich social preferences always agree with the strict preferences of\nsome one individual; and finally Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives, which says that the social comparison among any two\ngiven alternatives is to depend on individual preferences among only\nthat pair. Arrow\u2019s theorem, stated in\n Section 3.2, tells us that, except in\n the very simplest of cases, no\naggregation procedure whatsoever meets all the requirements.\nThe tenor of Arrow\u2019s theorem is deeply antithetical to the\npolitical ideals of the Enlightenment. It turns out that Condorcet\u2019s\nparadox is indeed not an isolated anomaly, the failure of one specific\nvoting method. Rather, it manifests a much wider problem with the very\nidea of collecting many individual preferences into one. On the face\nof it, anyway, there simply cannot be a common will of all the people\nconcerning collective decisions, that assimilates the tastes and\nvalues of all the individual men and women who make up a society.\nThere are some who, following Riker (1982), take Arrow\u2019s theorem to\nshow that democracy, conceived as government by the will of the\npeople, is an incoherent illusion. Others argue that some conditions\nof the theorem are unreasonable, and from their point of view the\nprospects for collective choice look much brighter. After presenting\nthe theorem itself, this entry will take up some main points of\ncritical discussion. Section 4 considers the\nmeaning and scope of Arrow\u2019s conditions. Section 5\ndiscusses aggregation procedures that are available when not all of\nArrows conditions need be satisfied, or when different underlying\nassumptions are made about the nature of social\nchoice. Section 6 concludes with an overview of\nproposals to study within Arrow\u2019s technical framework certain\naggregation problems other than the one that concerned him. \nAmartya Sen once expressed regret that the theory of social choice\ndoes not share with poetry the amiable characteristic of communicating\nbefore it is understood (Sen 1986). Arrow\u2019s theorem is not especially\ndifficult to understand and much about it is readily communicated, if\nnot in poetry, then at least in plain English.  Informal presentations\ngo only so far, though, and where they stop sometimes\nmisunderstandings start. This exposition uses a minimum of technical\nlanguage for the sake of clarity.\n",
