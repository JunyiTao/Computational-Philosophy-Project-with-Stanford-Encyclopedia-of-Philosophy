If liberty of expression is not highly valued, as\nhas often been the case, there is no problem; freedom of expression is\nsimply curtailed in favor of other values. It becomes a volatile issue\nwhen it is highly valued because only then do the limitations placed\nupon it become controversial. The first thing to note in any sensible\ndiscussion of freedom of speech is that it will have to be limited.\nEvery society places some limits on the exercise of speech because it\nalways takes place within a context of competing values. In this\nsense, Stanley Fish is correct when he says that there is no such\nthing as free speech (in the sense of unlimited speech). Free speech\nis simply a useful term to focus our attention on a particular form of\nhuman interaction and the phrase is not meant to suggest that speech\nshould never be limited. One does not have to fully agree with Fish\nwhen he says , \u201cfree speech in short, is not an independent\nvalue but a political prize\u201d (1994,102) but it is the case that\nno society has existed where speech has not been limited to some\nextent. Haworth (1998) makes a similar point when he suggests that a\nright to freedom of speech is not something we have, not something we\nown, in the same way as we possess arms and legs. \n\nAlexander and Horton (1984) agree. They note that \u201cspeech\u201d\nencapsulates many different activities: speaking, writing, singing,\nacting, burning flags, yelling on the street corner, advertising,\nthreats, slander and so on. One reason for thinking that speech is not\nspecial simpiciter is that some of these forms of\ncommunication are more important than others and hence require\ndifferent levels of protection. For example, the freedom to criticize\na government is generally thought to be more important than the\nfreedom of an artist to offend her audience. If two speech acts clash\n(when yelling prevents a political speech) a decision has to be made\nto prioritize one over the other, which means that there can be no\nunlimited right to free speech. For example, Alexander and Horton\n(1984) claim that arguments defending speech on democratic grounds\nhave many parts. One is a claim that the public needs a great deal of\ninformation in order to make informed decisions. Another is that\nbecause government is the servant of the people, it should not be\nallowed to censor them. Such arguments show that one of the main\nreasons for justifying free speech (political speech) is important,\nnot for its own sake but because it allows us to exercise another\nimportant value (democracy). Whatever reasons we offer to protect\nspeech can also be used to show why some speech is not special. If\nspeech is defended because it promotes autonomy, we no longer have\ngrounds for protecting speech acts that undermine this value. If our\ndefence of speech is that it is crucial to a well-functioning\ndemocracy, we have no reason to defend speech that is irrelevant to,\nor undermines, this goal. And if we agree with John Stuart Mill (1978)\nthat speech should be protected because it leads to the truth, there\nseems no reason to protect the speech of anti-vaccers or creationists.\n\n\nSpeech is important because we are socially situated and it makes\nlittle sense to say that Robinson Crusoe has a right to free speech.\nIt only becomes necessary to talk of such a right within a social\nsetting, and appeals to an abstract and absolute right to free speech\nhinder rather than help the debate. At a minimum, speech will have to\nbe limited for the sake of order. If we all speak at once, we end up\nwith an incoherent noise. Without some rules and procedures we cannot\nhave a conversation at all and consequently speech has to be limited\nby protocols of basic civility. \n\nIt is true that many human rights documents give a prominent place to\nthe right to speech and conscience, but such documents also place\nlimits on what can be said because of the harm and offense that\nunlimited speech can cause, (I will discuss this in more detail\nlater). Outside of the United States of America speech does not tend\nto have a specially protected status and it has to compete with other\nrights claims for our allegiance. John Stuart Mill, one of the great\ndefenders of free speech, summarized these points in On\nLiberty, where he suggests that a struggle always takes place\nbetween the competing demands of authority and liberty. He claimed\nthat we cannot have the latter without the former: \n\nAll that makes existence valuable to anyone depends on the\nenforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules\nof conduct, therefore, must be imposed\u2014by law in the first\nplace, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for\nthe operation of law. (1978, 5)\n\n\nThe task, therefore, is not to argue for an unlimited domain of free\nspeech; such a concept cannot be defended. Instead, we need to decide\nhow much value we place on speech in relation to other important\nideals such as privacy, security, democratic equality and the\nprevention of harm and there is nothing inherent to speech that\nsuggests it must always win out in competition with these values.\nSpeech is part of a package deal of social goods: \u201cspeech, in\nshort, is never a value in and of itself but is always produced within\nthe precincts of some assumed conception of the good\u201d (Fish,\n1994, 104). In this essay, I will examine some conceptions of the good\nthat are deemed to be acceptable limitations on speech. I will start\nwith the harm principle and then move on to other more encompassing\narguments for limiting speech. \n\nBefore we do this, however, the reader might wish to disagree with the\nabove claims and warn of the dangers of the \u201cslippery\nslope.\u201d As Frederick Schauer (1985) has demonstrated, slippery\nslope arguments make the claim that a current acceptable change (he\ncalls this the instant case) to the status quo regarding speech will\nlead to some intolerable future state of affairs (what he calls the\ndanger case) once the instant case prohibiting speech is introduced.\nThe assumption is that the instant case is acceptable; otherwise it\nwould be critiqued in its own right. The complaint is that a change\nfrom the status quo to the instant case will lead to unwanted future\nlimitations on speech and should be avoided (even if a change to the\ninstant case would be immediately desirable). The slippery slope\nargument has to make a clear distinction between the instant and the\ndanger case. If the former was part of the latter then it is not a\nslippery slope argument but simply an assertion about the unwarranted\nbreadth of the instant case. The claim being made is that a change to\nan acceptable instant case that is distinct from the danger case\nshould nevertheless be prohibited because a change from the status quo\nto the instant case will necessarily transport us to the danger case.\n\n\nAs Schuer says this is not very compelling because it needs to be\ndemonstrated, rather than merely stated, that the move from the status\nquo is so much more likely to lead to the danger case. Part of the\nproblem is that slippery slope arguments are often presented in a way\nthat suggests we can be on or off the slope. In fact, no such choice\nexists: we are necessarily on the slope whether we like it or\nnot, and the task is always to decide how far up or down we choose to\ngo, not whether we should step off the slope altogether. We need to\nkeep in mind that the slippery-slope claim is not that the proposed\ninstant case will lead to minor changes in the future, but that a\nsmall change now will have drastic and tyrannical consequences. The\nslippery-slope argument seems to suggest that the instant case is so\nflawed that any change to it from the status quo (which again, is a\nposition already on the slope) puts us in imminent threat of sliding\ninto the danger case. Unfortunately, the causal mechanisms for how\nthis must necessarily happen are usually unspecified. Anyone\nmaking such claims should be willing to demonstrate how this unlikely\nevent will happen before being taken seriously. Such a person is not\nsimply advocating caution; she is claiming that there is an imminent\nrisk of moving from an acceptable instant case to an unacceptable\ndanger case. This is not to say that slippage cannot occur. One\nsafeguard against this is to be as precise as possible in our use of\nlanguage. If harm to others is our preferred stopping point on the\nslope, we need to specify in clear terms what counts as harm and what\ndoes not. Sometimes we will fail in this task, but precision puts\nbrakes on the instant case and limits its capacity for sliding down\nthe slope. \n\nThose who support the slippery slope argument tend to make the claim\nthat the inevitable consequence of limiting speech is a slide into\ncensorship and tyranny. It is worth noting, however, that the slippery\nslope argument can be used to make the opposite point; one could argue\nthat we should not allow any removal of government interventions (on\nspeech or any other type of freedom) because once we do we are on the\nslippery slope to anarchy, the state of nature, and a life that Hobbes\ndescribed in Leviathan as \u201csolitary, poore, nasty,\nbrutish, and short\u201d (1968, 186). It is possible that some\nlimits on speech might, over time, lead to further\nrestrictions\u2014but they might not. And if they do, those\nlimitations might also be justified. The main point is that once we\nabandon the incoherent position that there should be no limits on\nspeech, we have to make controversial decisions about what can and\ncannot be expressed; this comes along with the territory of living\ntogether in communities.\n\n\nAnother thing to note before we engage with specific arguments for\nlimiting speech is that we are in fact free to speak as we like.\nHence, freedom of speech differs from some other types of free action.\nIf the government wants to prevent citizens engaging in certain\nactions, riding motor bikes for example, it can limit their freedom to\ndo so by making sure that such vehicles are no longer available;\ncurrent bikes could be destroyed and a ban can be placed on future\nimports. Freedom of speech is a different case. A government can limit\nsome forms of free expression by banning books, plays, films etc. but\nit cannot make it impossible to say certain things. The only thing it\ncan do is punish people after they have spoken. This means\nthat we are free to speak in a way that we are not free to ride\noutlawed motorbikes. This is an important point; if we insist that\nlegal prohibitions remove freedom then we have to hold the\nincoherent position that a person was unfree at the very moment she\nperformed a speech act. The government would have to remove our vocal\ncords for us to be unfree in the same way as the motorcyclist is\nunfree.\n\nA more persuasive analysis suggests that the threat of a sanction\nmakes it more difficult and potentially more costly to exercise our\nfreedom of speech. Such sanctions take two major forms. The first, and\nmost serious, is legal punishment by the state, which usually consists\nof a financial penalty, but can stretch to imprisonment (which then,\nof course, further restricts the persons free speech). The second\nthreat of sanction comes from social disapprobation. People will often\nrefrain from making public statements because they fear the ridicule\nand moral outrage of others. For example, one could expect to be\npublicly condemned if one made racist comments during a public lecture\nat a university. Usually it is the first type of sanction that catches\nour attention but, as we will see, John Stuart Mill provides a strong\nwarning about the chilling effect of the latter form of social\ncontrol.\n\nWe seem to have reached a paradoxical position. I started by claiming\nthat there can be no such thing as a pure form of free speech: now I\nseem to be arguing that we are, in fact, free to say anything we like.\nThe paradox is resolved by thinking of free speech in the following\nterms. I am, indeed, free to say (but not necessarily to publish) what\nI like, but the state and other individuals can sometimes make that\nfreedom more or less costly to exercise. This leads to the conclusion\nthat we can attempt to regulate speech, but we cannot prevent it if a\nperson is undeterred by the threat of sanction. The issue, therefore,\nboils down to assessing how cumbersome we wish to make it for people\nto say certain things. I have already suggested that all societies do\n(correctly) make some speech more costly than others. If the reader\ndoubts this, it might be worth considering what life would be like\nwith no sanctions on libelous statements, child pornography,\nadvertising content, and releasing state secrets. The list could go\non. \n\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that the problem we face is deciding\nwhere, not whether, to place limits on speech, and the next sections\nlook at some possible solutions to this puzzle. \n",
