    "main_text": "Value\n13. Value\n\nSixthly (and perhaps most importantly of all) it is widely thought\nthat the most important thing about God\u2014thing that most makes us\ncall him \u2018God\u2019\u2014is his perfection or goodness. God is\na being \u2018worthy of worship.\u2019 Can the pantheist say this of\nthe cosmos as a whole? A variety of positions are possible. (1) Any\npantheistic world-view arrived at by extending the reach of the\ntraditional theistic God will find it relatively easy to assert the\nsame value to the cosmos that it attributed to God, but there are\nother possibilities as well. (2) Insofar as the pantheist assertion of\nunity may be understood as an assertion of complete and coherent\nintegration, and disvalue held to lie in conflict, disharmony or\nincompleteness, then it may be possible to argue that the culmination\nof metaphysical unity constitutes also the culmination of value. For\nexample, the Absolute Idealist Bernard Bosanquet states, \u201cWe\ncannot describe perfection; that is, we cannot enumerate its\ncomponents and state their form and connection in detail. But we can\ndefine its character as the harmony of all being. And good is\nperfection in its character of satisfactoriness; that which is\nconsidered as the end of conations and the fruition of desires\u201d\n(Bosanquet 1913,194). (3) More naturalistically, it might be suggested\nthan pantheism tells us that nature is our proper home and, as such,\nour proper good. Everything has its place in a wider system which both\nsupports it and to which it contributes. As natural creatures our most\nfulfilling life is found in and at one with nature. (4) Lastly, it\nshould be noted that many scientific pantheists argue that nature has\nno intrinsic value whatsoever. It is merely something that\nwe happen to love and venerate in the highest degree.\n",
