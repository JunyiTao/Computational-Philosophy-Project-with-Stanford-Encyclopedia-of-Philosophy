    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || Supervenience, Grounding, and Ontological Dependence\n3.5 Supervenience, Grounding, and Ontological Dependence\n\nThere is now a large literature on grounding and ontological\ndependence, including an entry for each in this encyclopedia. Roughly,\none fact grounds another when the latter obtains in virtue of the\nformer: the former in some sense makes the latter obtain. It is a\nproductive, generative relation. (Bennett 2017 claims that there are\nseveral such relations, which she calls building relations. Talk of\nproduction and generation naturally invites a question about the\nrelation between grounding or building and causation; see Schaffer\n2016, Bennett 2017 chapter 4, Bernstein 2017, and A. Wilson 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relation between grounding and causation.) Roughly,\nan entity ontologically depends on another when the former would not\nexist without the latter. Much, much more can be and has been said\nabout these relations, but this is enough for our purposes. \n\nGrounding and ontological dependence are distinct from each other. The\nsimplest way to see this is by means of the kinds of case that\nrevealed to David Lewis that causation is distinct from causal\ndependence (1973): preemption and overdetermination. Just as cases of\ncausal overdetermination and preemption involve causation without\ncausal dependence, so too do cases of \u2018grounding\noverdetermination\u2019 and \u2018grounding preemption\u2019\ninvolve grounding without ontological dependence. For example, the\nfact that I exist grounds the fact that something exists, but the\nobtaining of the latter fact does not depend upon the obtaining of the\nformer; the fact that something exists is massively overgrounded.\n\nBecause grounding and ontological dependence are distinct, the claim\nthat supervenience is not the same as grounding is distinct from the\nclaim that supervenience is not the same as ontological dependence.\nNonetheless, many of the same considerations are relevant.\n\nOne such consideration is that these relations may not have the same\nrelata. Supervenience is typically said to be a relation between\nproperties or families of properties, but at least some of\ngrounding\u2019s advocates say that it is a relation between facts\nonly (e.g. Rosen 2010, Audi 2012), and ontological dependence seems to\nobtain between members of a variety of ontological categories.\nHowever, it is not clear how seriously to take this kind of concern,\nsince notions of fact supervenience and property grounding can easily\nbe defined. \n\nA second way to see that supervenience is not identical to either\ngrounding or ontological dependence is to note that the latter two\nrelations are widely (though not universally) thought to be\nirreflexive and asymmetrical. Nothing can ground or ontologically\ndepend upon itself, and nothing can ground or ontologically depend on\nsomething that also grounds or depends on it. But as we have seen,\nsupervenience is reflexive and not asymmetrical (see\n Section 3.2).\n (For challenges to the claim that dependence and/or grounding are\nirreflexive and asymmetric, see Jenkins 2011, Bliss 2014, Wilson 2014,\nand Barnes 2018; for a reply to these challenges, see Bennett 2017,\nsect. 3.2). \n\nA third way to see that supervenience is not the same as either\ngrounding or ontological dependence is that the following conditionals\nare false:\n\nif A supervenes on B, B grounds\nA\nif A supervenes on B, A ontologically\ndepends on B\n\n\nAs McLaughlin put it in 1995, a mere supervenience claim does not\nentail any \u201cin virtue of\u201d claim. Here are a couple of ways\nto see this. As noted above, for any property F, being\nF supervenes on being ~F: two things cannot differ\nwith respect to being F without differing with respect to\nbeing ~F. But, of course, being ~F does not ground\nbeing F, and being F does not ontologically depend\non being ~F!\n\nAnother way to see that the conditionals are false is to notice that\nproperties everything has necessarily and ones that nothing can\npossibly have supervene, with the same sort of necessity, on\nany property whatsoever. (The fact that the necessary and the\nimpossible supervene on anything and everything poses not one but\ntwo problem for attempts to use supervenience to define\nphysicalism. See\n Section 5.4.)\n The property being self-identical supervenes on the property\nbeing an antique; the property being both a kangaroo and\nnot a kangaroo supervenes upon the property being dusty.\nThe reason is simple enough. No two things can differ with respect to\neither necessary or impossible properties, period; thus no two things\ncan differ with respect to such properties without also differing with\nrespect to B-properties, for any property set B.\nNothing can be both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo, so no two things\ncan differ with respect to that property, and thus no two things can\ndiffer with respect to that property without also differing with\nrespect to being dusty, or being purple, or being a steam engine, etc.\nBut it is not the case that being both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo\nis ontologically dependent upon being dusty, or that being dusty\ngrounds being both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo. Being dusty has\nnothing to do with it at all.\n\nFor yet another reason for denying that the supervenience of\nA-properties on B-properties entails anything about\ngrounding or ontological dependence, see the discussion of certain\nforms of global supervenience in Section 4.3.5. Author\u2019s\nnote: the main ideas in this section have been in place since the\noriginal 2005 edition, though the section was substantively revised in\n2018 to be more careful about the differences between grounding,\nontological dependence, and ontological priority. (The 2023 revision\nmerely involved trivial edits.)\n\n",
