    "main_text": "Symmetric 2\u00d72 PD With Ordinal Payoffs\n1. Symmetric 2\u00d72 PD With Ordinal Payoffs\n\nIn its simplest form the PD is a game described by the payoff\nmatrix:\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(R,R\\)\n\\(S,T\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(T,S\\)\n\\(P,P\\) \n\n\nsatisfying the following chain of inequalities:\n\n(PD1) \\(T \\gt R \\gt P\n\\gt S\\)\n\n\nThere are two players, Row and Column. Each has two possible moves,\n\u201ccooperate\u201d (\\(\\bC\\)) or \u201cdefect\u201d (\\(\\bD\\)),\ncorresponding, respectively, to the options of remaining silent or\nconfessing in the illustrative anecdote above. For each possible pair\nof moves, the payoffs to Row and Column (in that order) are listed in\nthe appropriate cell. \\(R\\) is the \u201creward\u201d payoff that\neach player receives if both cooperate. \\(P\\) is the\n\u201cpunishment\u201d that each receives if both defect. \\(T\\) is\nthe \u201ctemptation\u201d that each receives as sole defector and\n\\(S\\) is the \u201csucker\u201d payoff that each receives as sole\ncooperator. We assume here that the game is symmetric, i.e., that the\nreward, punishment, temptation and sucker payoffs are the same for\neach player, and payoffs have only ordinal significance, i.e., they\nindicate whether one payoff is better than another, but tell us\nnothing about how much better. It is now easy to see that we have the\nstructure of a dilemma like the one in the story. Suppose Column\ncooperates. Then Row gets \\(R\\) for cooperating and \\(T\\) for\ndefecting, and so is better off defecting. Suppose Column defects.\nThen Row gets \\(S\\) for cooperating and \\(P\\) for defecting, and so is\nagain better off defecting. The move \\(\\bD\\) for Row is said to\nstrictly dominate the move \\(\\bC\\): whatever Column does, Row\nis better off choosing \\(\\bD\\) than \\(\\bC\\). By symmetry \\(\\bD\\) also\nstrictly dominates \\(\\bC\\) for Column. Thus two \u201crational\u201d\nplayers will defect and receive a payoff of \\(P\\), while two\n\u201cirrational\u201d players can cooperate and receive greater\npayoff \\(R\\). In standard treatments, game theory assumes rationality\nand common knowledge. Each player is rational, knows the other is\nrational, knows that the other knows he is rational, etc. Each player\nalso knows how the other values the outcomes. But since \\(\\bD\\)\nstrictly dominates \\(\\bC\\) for both players, the argument for dilemma\nhere requires only that each player knows his own payoffs. (The\nargument remains valid, of course, under the stronger standard\nassumptions.) It is also worth noting that the outcome \\((\\bD, \\bD)\\)\nof both players defecting is the game's only strict nash equilibrium,\ni.e., it is the only outcome from which each player could only do\nworse by unilaterally changing its move. Flood and Dresher's interest\nin their dilemma seems to have stemmed from their view that it\nprovided a counterexample to the claim that the nash equilibria of a\ngame constitute its natural \u201csolutions\u201d.\n\nIf there can be \u201cties\u201d in rankings of the payoffs,\ncondition PD1 can be weakened without destroying the nature of the\ndilemma. For suppose that one of the following conditions obtains:\n\n(PD2) \\(T \\gt R \\gt P\n\\ge S\\), or\n \\(T \\ge R \\gt P \\gt\nS\\)\n\n\nThen, for each player, although \\(\\bD\\) does not strictly dominate\n\\(\\bC\\), it still weakly dominates in the sense that each\nplayer always does at least as well, and sometimes better, by playing\n\\(\\bD\\). Under these conditions it still seems rational to play\n\\(\\bD\\), which again results in the payoff that neither player\nprefers. Let us call a game that meets PD2 a weak PD. Note\nthat in a weak PD that does not satisfy PD1 mutual defection is no\nlonger a nash equilibrium in the strict sense defined above. It is\nstill, however, the only nash equilibrium in the weaker sense, that\nneither player can improve its position by unilaterally changing its\nmove. Again, one might suppose that if there is a unique nash\nequilibrium of this weaker variety, rational self-interested players\nwould reach it.\n",
