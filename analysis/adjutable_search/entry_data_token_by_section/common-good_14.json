Markets, Competition and the Invisible Hand\n\nA third important topic in philosophical reflection about the common\ngood is the market. Citizens have a relational obligation to care\nabout certain common interests, and social coordination through\nmarkets can draw citizens into a pattern of production activity and\nconsumption activity that answers to these interests. For example,\nmarkets can lead citizens to make better use of land and labor in\nsociety, thereby generating more resources for everyone to use in\npursuing their various ends. The problem is that market coordination\ninvolves a privatized form of reasoning, and the proper functioning of\nthe market may require citizens not to reason from the\nstandpoint of the common good.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose that a society uses markets to coordinate the\neducation of citizens (see Friedman 1962). A system of for-profit\nschools would operate as firms, hiring teachers, buying computers, and\nselling education services to the public. Parents, in turn, would act\nas consumers, buying the best education for their children at the\nlowest cost. Each citizen in this arrangement would reason from the\nstandpoint of her own private concerns: as school managers, citizens\nwould aim to maximize profits, and as parents, citizens would aim to\nget the best education for their children at the lowest cost. No one\nwould act out of a concern for the education system as a shared\nfacility that serves common interests. In fact, the market may require\ncitizens to avoid this perspective. After all, to lower costs\neffectively, school managers must not show too much concern for the\neducation of their students. And in order to improve the education of\ntheir own children, parents must not show too much concern for the\neducation of other people\u2019s children.\n\nWe can divide the philosophical debate into two camps. The first camp\nsays that market society\u2014i.e., a social order that relies\nextensively on markets to coordinate social life\u2014is compatible\nwith the requirements of the political relationship. Theorists in this\ncamp include Adam Smith (1776), G.W.F. Hegel (1821), John Rawls\n(1971), Michael Sandel (2009) and perhaps Michael Walzer (1983). We\nmight also include deliberative democrats such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas\n(1992) and Joshua Cohen (Cohen & Sabel\n 1997).[23]\n\nAs an example of someone in the first camp, consider Hegel (1821) and\nhis view of the market. Hegel follows Adam Smith in thinking that the\nmarket draws citizens into a pattern of specialization that serves\ncommon interests. The market does this through prices. Each citizen\nfinds that she can do better for herself by developing her talents and\nselling her labor at the going rate, then buying the goods\nthat she needs from others. But following price signals\ninvolves a form of reasoning that is focused only on private\ninterests, not the common good. As a result, it is essential, on\nHegel\u2019s view, that the realm of market activity must be\nintegrated into a wider political community. As members of a political\ncommunity, citizens (or at least some citizens) discuss their common\ninterests in the public sphere, vote in elections, and find their\nviews represented in legislative deliberations that shape an official\nconception of the common good. This official conception shapes the\nlaws and guides the government in managing the economy. So even if\ncitizens do not reason from the standpoint of the common good as\nmarket actors, their lives as a whole are organized by a form\nof reasoning that is focused on maintaining shared facilities\nfor the sake of common interests.\n\nThe other camp in the disagreement says that market society is not\ncompatible with the requirements of the political relationship.\nTheorists in this camp include Aristotle (see Pol.\n1256b39\u20131258a17), Rousseau (1762b), Marx (1844, 1867), and G.A.\nCohen (2009). Marx\u2019s view provides an interesting contrast to\nHegel\u2019s.\n\nMarx agrees with Hegel that members of a political community must\norganize their activities in light of a conception of the common\ngood. But he does not think that members live up to the ideal if most\nof them never actually reason from this standpoint. A political\ncommunity must be \u201cradically democratic\u201d in the sense that\nordinary citizens participate directly in the collective effort to\norganize social life by appeal to a conception of the common good\n(Marx 1844). What makes social coordination through markets\nproblematic is that market actors are drawn into certain patterns of\nactivity through prices, which means that they never actually reason\nwith each other in terms of the common good. On Marx\u2019s view, a\nproperly ordered political community would move beyond this opaque\nform of social coordination:\n\n\nThe life-process of society, which is based on the process of material\nproduction, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated\nas production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated\nby them in accordance with a settled plan. (Marx 1867 [1967:84]).\n\n\nIn a properly ordered political community, members will transcend the\nauthoritarian mysticism of price coordination and organize their\nproduction and consumption activities through an open and transparent\nprocess of reasoning that makes explicit to everyone how their\nactivities serve common interests.\n\nMany contemporary issues in political philosophy revolve around\nquestions about the market and the standpoint of the common good. Most\ntheorists today hold views that fall somewhere between the two camps I\njust described: they argue for some more nuanced view about when\ncitizens are supposed to adopt a privatized perspective and when they\nmust reason from the standpoint of the common good.\n\nWhen it comes to corporations and corporate executives, for example,\nThomas Christiano (2010) argues for a certain kind of socially\nconscious orientation: corporate leaders must reason from the\nstandpoint of the common good at least in limiting their strategic\npursuit of private objectives in a way that is consistent with the\nbroader social objectives established by democratic\n majorities.[24]\n Joseph Heath (2014) argues for a more limited view, such that market\nactors must not take a purely privatized perspective in cases where\nexternalities and other market failures would prevent the market\nprocess from generating attractive results. A great deal of work\nremains to be done when it comes to other aspects of market life that\nmay require citizens to reason from a more socially conscious\nperspective, particularly when it comes to labor rights, political\nliberties and climate change.\n\nAnother important set of contemporary issues has to do with\ncompetition. Market coordination typically works through a process in\nwhich citizens compete with one another for important goods. In the\nUnited States, for instance, labor market participants compete for\njobs that substantially determine who gets access to different levels\nof income, and by extension, different levels of health care, police\nprotection, consideration in the justice system, and political\ninfluence. As citizens square off against each other, each one strives\nto secure important goods for herself, knowing that her activities\nwill\u2014if successful\u2014effectively deprive some other citizen\nof these same goods. In this way, labor market competition requires\ncitizens to act with an extreme form of disregard for how their\nactions affect one another\u2019s basic interests.\n\nMany philosophers believe that the antagonistic structure of market\ncompetition is inconsistent with the relational obligation that\nmembers of a political community have to care about certain common\ninterests. G.A. Cohen (2009: 34\u201345) articulates the problem in\nterms of a \u201csocialist principle of community\u201d that rules\nout social arrangements that require people to view one another simply\nas obstacles that must be overcome. Hussain (forthcoming) takes a more\nmoderate view, arguing that there is a difference between a\n\u201cfriendly competition\u201d and a \u201clife or death\nstruggle\u201d. The political relationship allows for a certain\ndegree of competition among citizens, but it limits how severely\ninstitutions can pit citizens against each other when it comes to\ngoods that are part of the common good, e.g., health care, education,\nand the social bases of self-respect.\n",
