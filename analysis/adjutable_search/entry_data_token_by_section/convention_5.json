    "main_text": "Analyzing social convention || Hume\n3.1 Hume\n\n\nHume\u2019s analysis of convention, while compressed, has proved\nremarkably fertile. As Hume puts it in the Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, a convention is\n\n\na sense of common interest; which sense each man feels in his own\nbreast, which he remarks in his fellows, and which carries him, in\nconcurrence with others into a general plan or system of actions,\nwhich tends to public utility. (p. 257)\n\n\nOn this definition, a convention prevails in a population when each\nmember of the population plays his part in some system of actions\nbecause he perceives that it is in his interest to do so, given that\nothers perceive it is in their interests to do so. Several features of\nthis definition deserve emphasis. First, a convention contributes to\nthe mutual benefit of its participants. Second, a convention need not\nresult from explicit promise or agreement. Third, each participant\nbelieves that other participants obey the convention. Fourth, given\nthis belief, each participant has reason to obey the convention\nherself. This fourth point emerges even more sharply in the\nTreatise: \u201cthe actions of each of us have a reference to\nthose of the other, and are perform\u2019d upon the supposition, that\nsomething is to be perform\u2019d on the other part\u201d (p. 490).\nHume illustrates his approach with the memorable example of two men\nsitting in a row-boat. In order to move at all, they must synchronize\ntheir rowing, which they do without any explicit agreement.\n\n\nHaving clarified convention, Hume deploys it to illuminate property,\njustice, promising, and government. In each case, Hume offers a\nbroadly conventionalist account (see the entry on Hume\u2019s moral\nphilosophy for details). For instance, property emerges from the state\nof nature through a social convention \u201cto bestow stability on\nthe possession of those external goods, and leave every one in the\npeaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and\nindustry\u201d (Treatise, p. 489). This convention makes it\nthe case that certain goods are \u201cowned\u201d by certain people,\nwho enjoy exclusive rights to their use or dispensation. Similarly,\nHume argues that the obligation to keep one\u2019s promises is intelligible\nonly with reference to convention that, when one employs a certain\n\u201cform of words\u201d (e.g., \u201cI promise to\n\\(j\\)\u201d), one thereby expresses a resolution to \\(j\\)\nand subjects oneself to penalty if one does not \\(j\\).\n\n\nIn both the Treatise and \u201cOf the Original\nContract,\u201d Hume rejects a Hobbesian conception of government as\narising from the state of nature through a social contract. Hume offers\nvarious criticisms, but a particularly fundamental objection is that\nHobbes adopts a misguided order of explanation. Hobbes explains\ngovernment as the result of phenomena, such as promising or\ncontracting, that themselves rest upon convention and hence\ncould not arise in a pure state of nature. Hume contends that promising\nand government arise independently, albeit in the same basic way and\nfrom the same basic source:\n convention.[6]\n\n\nPerhaps the most notable feature of Hume\u2019s account is that it\nprovides a detailed model of how social order can arise from rational\ndecisions made by individual agents, without any need for either\nexplicit covenant or supervision by a centralized authority. In this\nrespect, Hume\u2019s discussion prefigures Adam Smith\u2019s\n\u201cinvisible hand\u201d analysis of the marketplace.\n",
