    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || Intermittence\n1.4 Intermittence\n\n\nMargolis (1958) explicitly endorses one implication of his\nhypothesis regarding the way of being or Seinsweise of the\nwork of art. In the absence of the right sort of attention, the\nwork ceases to exist, even though the physical system remains\nintact. Yet the same work can return to existence when the same\nsort of imaginative attention is directed upon the physical system that\nconstitutes the supervenience base of the artwork, thereby\n\u201creviving\u201d the correlative aesthetic design.\n\n\nSeveral philosophers (e.g., Eleanor Rowland 1913, 117, Gilson 1957,\nHilde Hein 1959, Andrew Harrison 1967\u201368, Currie 1989, 57) have\nquestioned the wisdom of allowing that the existence of a work is\nintermittent. An early example is Johannes Volkelt (1905, 11), who\nasserts that the statue of Zeus in Otricoli was a work of art\nthroughout the many centuries during which it lay buried and\nunobserved. As Wolterstorff later put it, \u201cHave not\nBeethoven\u2019s quartets, Rembrandt\u2019s prints, and\nYeats\u2019s poems existed at least ever since their\ncomposition?\u201d (1980, 43). As will become apparent below, a\ndesire to find some alternative to the hypothesis of intermittent\nexistence has influenced some of the proposals about the category of\nenduring or perduring entities to which artworks should be said to\nbelong. For example, Andrew Paul Ushenko characterized works as powers\nso as to avoid the intermittence problem (1953, 47), and similar\nintuitions motivated Pepper\u2019s (1965)\n\u201cdouble-dispositional\u201d account, according to which a\nwork\u2019s continuous existence depends on the \u201cpassive\ndisposition\u201d of a physical object as well as the \u201cdynamic\ndisposition\u201d of the observer.\n",
