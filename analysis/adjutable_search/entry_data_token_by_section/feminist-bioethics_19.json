For example, since the early 2000s,\npublic health ethics have become a recognized part of mainstream\nbioethics, yet many of the concerns of public health ethics were\nanticipated by feminist health care movements at least a couple of\ndecades earlier. Feminist approaches are centrally concerned with\njustice and equality, and the role of power relations\u2014primarily,\nbut not solely, gendered power relations\u2014in the generation of\ninequity. In the context of public health, feminist analyses are\nattentive to the connections between gender, health, and population\nhealth inequities overall, but also look at how the social and\npolitical distortions of power affect all the processes of public\nhealth (Rogers 2006: 351), from policy making through to program\ndelivery (Baylis, Kenny, & Sherwin 2008).\n\nIn addition, a growing number of feminist bioethicists are moving\ntowards topics that have not been associated conventionally with\nbiomedicine but that nevertheless have powerful indirect effects on\nhuman health. Some authors have developed a specifically feminist\nbioethics of food consumption and production (Rawlinson & Ward\n2016; Rawlinson 2019) in relation to ideas about vulnerability,\necological dependence, and global justice (Gilson 2015; Reiheld 2016),\nand have analyzed changes in agricultural and food production\npractices through the lens of power and gender dynamics (Di Chiro\n2017; Gilson & Kenehan 2019; Littig 2017; Wichterich 2015).\n\nSome recent feminist work has taken these concerns beyond an\nexclusively human focus. It understands \u201cbio\u201d to encompass\nall aspects of the living world, in line with a longstanding\necofeminist view that environmental damage reflects patriarchy and\nmale domination (Agarwal 1992; Plumwood 1993; see Elmhirst 2018 for a\nrecent overview of the field). There is a growing emphasis on the\nconsequences of environmental damage and climate change for humans and\nthe biosphere overall (Dwyer 2013; Whyte & Cuomo 2016; Zoloth\n2017; Buckingham & Le Masson 2017; Bee & Park 2022). Some of\nthese areas have benefited from strong cross-fertilization between\nfeminist bioethics and feminist science and technology studies (STS),\nwith scholars working productively around the borders between the\ntwo.\n",
