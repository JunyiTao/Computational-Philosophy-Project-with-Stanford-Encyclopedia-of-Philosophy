    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Measurement || Theory-ladenness of measurement\n8.3 Accuracy and precision\n\nTwo key aspects of the reliability of measurement outcomes are\naccuracy and precision. Consider a series of repeated weight\nmeasurements performed on a particular object with an equal-arms\nbalance. From a realist, \u201cerror-based\u201d perspective, the\noutcomes of these measurements are accurate if they are close\nto the true value of the quantity being measured\u2014in our case,\nthe true ratio of the object\u2019s weight to the chosen\nunit\u2014and precise if they are close to each other. An\nanalogy often cited to clarify the error-based distinction is that of\narrows shot at a target, with accuracy analogous to the closeness of\nhits to the bull\u2019s eye and precision analogous to the tightness\nof spread of hits (cf. JCGM 2012: 2.13 & 2.15, Teller 2013: 192).\nThough intuitive, the error-based way of carving the distinction\nraises an epistemological difficulty. It is commonly thought that the\nexact true values of most quantities of interest to science are\nunknowable, at least when those quantities are measured on continuous\nscales. If this assumption is granted, the accuracy with which such\nquantities are measured cannot be known with exactitude, but only\nestimated by comparing inaccurate measurements to each other. And yet\nit is unclear why convergence among inaccurate measurements should be\ntaken as an indication of truth. After all, the measurements could be\nplagued by a common bias that prevents their individual inaccuracies\nfrom cancelling each other out when averaged. In the absence of\ncognitive access to true values, how is the evaluation of measurement\naccuracy possible?\n\nIn answering this question, philosophers have benefited from studying\nthe various senses of the term \u201cmeasurement accuracy\u201d as\nused by practicing scientists. At least five different senses have\nbeen identified: metaphysical, epistemic, operational, comparative and\npragmatic (Tal 2011: 1084\u20135). In particular, the epistemic or\n\u201cuncertainty-based\u201d sense of the term is metaphysically\nneutral and does not presuppose the existence of true values. Instead,\nthe accuracy of a measurement outcome is taken to be the closeness of\nagreement among values reasonably attributed to a quantity given\navailable empirical data and background knowledge (cf. JCGM 2012: 2.13\nNote 3; Giordani & Mari 2012; de Courtenay and Gr\u00e9gis\n2017). Thus construed, measurement accuracy can be evaluated by\nestablishing robustness among the consequences of models representing\ndifferent measurement processes (Basso 2017; Tal 2017b; Bokulich 2020;\nStaley 2020).\n\nUnder the uncertainty-based conception, imprecision is a special type\nof inaccuracy. For example, the inaccuracy of weight measurements is\nthe breadth of spread of values that are reasonably attributed to the\nobject\u2019s weight given the indications of the balance and\navailable background knowledge about the way the balance works and the\nstandard weights used. The imprecision of these measurements is the\ncomponent of inaccuracy arising from uncontrolled variations to the\nindications of the balance over repeated trials. Other sources of\ninaccuracy besides imprecision include imperfect corrections to\nsystematic errors, inaccurately known physical constants, and vague\nmeasurand definitions, among others (see\n Section 7.1).\n\nPaul Teller (2018) raises a different objection to the error-based\nconception of measurement accuracy. He argues against an assumption he\ncalls \u201cmeasurement accuracy realism\u201d, according to which\nmeasurable quantities have definite values in reality. Teller argues\nthat this assumption is false insofar as it concerns the quantities\nhabitually measured in physics, because any specification of definite\nvalues (or value ranges) for such quantities involves idealization and\nhence cannot refer to anything in reality. For example, the concept\nusually understood by the phrase \u201cthe velocity of sound in\nair\u201d involves a host of implicit idealizations concerning the\nuniformity of the air\u2019s chemical composition, temperature and\npressure as well as the stability of units of measurement. Removing\nthese idealizations completely would require adding infinite amount of\ndetail to each specification. As Teller argues, measurement accuracy\nshould itself be understood as a useful idealization, namely as a\nconcept that allows scientists to assess coherence and consistency\namong measurement outcomes as if the linguistic expression of\nthese outcomes latched onto anything in the world. Precision is\nsimilarly an idealized concept, which is based on an open-ended and\nindefinite specification of what counts as repetition of measurement\nunder \u201cthe same\u201d circumstances (Teller 2013: 194).\n",
