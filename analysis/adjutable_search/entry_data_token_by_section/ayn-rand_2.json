An\nintrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors\nexternal to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature\ndepends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined,\nvariously, as that which depends on the relation between a living\nentity\u2019s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its\nenvironment, or as that which depends on the relation between a\nproperly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality.\nCommentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand\u2019s\nviews on this issue.\n\nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third\ncategory or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false\ndichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand\u2019s\nview, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the\nexistence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless\ndebates over the false alternative \u201cintrinsic or\nsubjective?\u201d in cases where the phenomenon in question is\nneither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective.\n\nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in\na sense all of Rand\u2019s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses\n\u201cthe supremacy of actual living over all other\nconsiderations\u201d, and insists that philosophy needs to be\n\u201cbrought up to the realm of actual\nliving\u201d\u2014adding \u201cI say intentionally brought\nup to it, not down\u201d (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p.\n72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself\nwith the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral\nand political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane\nstrata of metaphysics and epistemology\u2014as when she identifies\nerrors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or\nmind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and\npersonal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand\u2019s\nemphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total\ncontext of one\u2019s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to\ncompartmentalization.\n\nRand\u2019s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract\ntheory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her\nphilosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others\nhyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche\u2019s influence, as well\nas the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play\na role. Rand also tended\u2014perhaps owing in part to the same two\ninfluences\u2014to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the\npsychological flaws of their authors.\n\nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand\u2019s views on epistemology\nand metaphysics, please see the supplementary document\n Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\n",
