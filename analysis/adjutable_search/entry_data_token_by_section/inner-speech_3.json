    "main_text": "Inner Speech and Thought || Inner Speech and Thought Facilitation\n2.2 Inner Speech and Thought Facilitation\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to how inner speech might play\na substantive role in facilitating thought or thought\nprocesses\u2014a role that goes beyond merely expressing thought\nprocesses.\n\nFirst, inner speech is often thought to play an important role in\nworking memory. According to Alan Baddeley\u2019s influential theory\nof working memory (e.g., Baddeley 1992), we can retain a series of\nwords or numbers in working memory by reciting them in inner speech. A\nshort series of items will be retained long enough to recite them\nagain. One can iterate this process via a \u201cphonological\nloop\u201d for as long as desired.\n\nFollowing Vygotsky (1934 [1986]), Clowes (2007) and Jorba &\nVicente (2014) hold that inner speech can serve as a tool for\ndirecting our own attention, just as external speech can serve as a\ntool to direct the attention of others. In making this case, both draw\non the Vygotskyan developmental account of inner speech, on which\ninner speech is derived from the external phenomenon. See also\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015), who make the same point\nbut are less directly influenced by Vygotsky\u2019s original (1934\n[1986]) developmental account.\n\nThere is evidence that inner speech facilitates various executive\nfunction tasks, such as planning, task-switching, and inhibiting\nimpulsive and inappropriate responses, without being essential to\nthem. The evidence that inner speech can play a role in these tasks is\nprimarily empirical. For reviews of the relevant literature, see\nAlderson-Day & Fernyhough (2015) and Petrolini, Jorba, &\nVicente (2020).\n\nMunroe (2022b; forthcoming) argues that inner speech plays a role in\nreasoning which goes beyond merely aiding or improving it. He notes\nthat reasoning processes often involve preserving representations in\nworking memory. In doing complex mental arithmetic, for example, one\nmight recite in inner speech the word for a number which they have\ndetermined will be needed later in the process, e.g., when regrouping\nvalues (i.e., \u201ccarrying\u201d and \u201cborrowing\u201d). The\nnumber word will be stored in working memory via the process described\nabove. But, on Baddeley\u2019s model of working memory, which Munroe\nis working with, only sensory representations can be stored in working\nmemory. In the present context, this means that only auditory\nrepresentations of the relevant word sounds can be stored, not the\nconceptual content which the word would have if spoken aloud (or,\npossibly, if it were produced in inner speech in a different context,\ndepending on one\u2019s view on the contents of inner\nspeech\u2014see\n Section 3).\n When one needs to use the number at a later stage in the process,\nthey will need to interpret the sensory representation which they are\nproducing. For example, if they are reciting a sound corresponding to\nthe word, \u201csix\u201d, in inner speech, they will need to\ninterpret that as the word referring to the number, six, so that six\nbecomes the number that they now use to continue their calculations.\nIf this is so, then interpreting the inner speech that one was\nproducing, and thus the inner speech itself, was essential to the\nreasoning process, not merely a dispensable aid. Munroe holds that the\nsame will apply in many reasoning processes performed that require\nmaking use of an intermediate conclusion.\n\nA number of theorists\u2014especially those working in neo-empiricist\n(Barsalou 1999; Prinz 2011, 2012) and embodied cognition traditions\n(Borghi et al. 2017; Dove 2014)\u2014have also proposed that inner\nspeech plays an important role in facilitating abstract thought, i.e.,\nthought about objects or properties that are not easily perceived.\nHere the idea is that language perception and production\nabilities\u2014and their internalization, via inner\nspeech\u2014provide means for explaining the acquisition and use of\nabstract concepts in broadly sensorimotor terms. In particular, Guy\nDove (2014, 2018, 2020, 2022) develops a view where\nlanguage\u2014often in the form of inner speech\u2014is used as a\n\u201cscaffold\u201d or \u201ctool\u201d for enabling thought\nabout abstract entities, and where the capacity for abstract concept\nuse is closely tied to the capacity for language.\n\nFinally, if subsystems and modules in the mind function in isolation\nfrom one another to any significant extent, then inner speech may play\nan important role in integrating their output. Carruthers (2002, 2006)\nsuggests that the process of language production generally, including\nthe production of inner speech, is especially well suited to integrate\nthe output of multiple modules, because of the combinatorial nature of\nlanguage. In producing an episode of inner speech, one can thus\nexpress complex content, which is then distributed to mental modules\nand subsystems for further processing. Other sources relevant to inner\nspeech and the integration of information produced by different parts\nof the mind include Baars (1988) and Dennett (1991).\n",
