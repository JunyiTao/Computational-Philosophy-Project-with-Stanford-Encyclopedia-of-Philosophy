    "main_text": "Sources of Knowledge and Justification || Testimony\n5.5 Testimony\n\nTestimony differs from the sources we considered above because it\nisn\u2019t distinguished by having its own cognitive faculty. Rather,\nto acquire knowledge of p through testimony is to come to know\nthat p on the basis of someone\u2019s saying that p.\n\u201cSaying that p\u201d must be understood broadly, as\nincluding ordinary utterances in daily life, postings by bloggers on\ntheir blogs, articles by journalists, delivery of information on\ntelevision, radio, tapes, books, and other media. So, when you ask the\nperson next to you what time it is, and she tells you, and you thereby\ncome to know what time it is, that\u2019s an example of coming to\nknow something on the basis of testimony. And when you learn by\nreading the Washington Post that the terrorist attack in\nSharm el-Sheikh of 22 July 2005 killed at least 88 people, that, too,\nis an example of acquiring knowledge on the basis of testimony.\n\nThe epistemological puzzle testimony raises is this: Why is testimony\na source of knowledge? An externalist might say that testimony is a\nsource of knowledge if, and because, it comes from a reliable source.\nBut here, even more so than in the case of our faculties, internalists\nwill not find that answer satisfactory. Suppose you hear someone\nsaying \u201cp\u201d. Suppose further that person is in fact\nutterly reliable with regard to the question of whether p is\nthe case or not. Finally, suppose you have no clue whatever as to that\nperson\u2019s reliability. Wouldn\u2019t it be plausible to conclude\nthat, since that person\u2019s reliability is unknown to you, that\nperson\u2019s saying \u201cp\u201d does not put you in a\nposition to know that p? But if the reliability of a\ntestimonial source is not sufficient for making it a source of\nknowledge, what else is needed? Thomas Reid suggested that, by our\nvery nature, we accept testimonial sources as reliable and tend to\nattribute credibility to them unless we encounter special contrary\nreasons. But that\u2019s merely a statement of the attitude we in\nfact take toward testimony. What is it that makes that attitude\nreasonable? It could be argued that, in one\u2019s own personal\nexperiences with testimonial sources, one has accumulated a long track\nrecord that can be taken as a sign of reliability. However, when we\nthink of the sheer breadth of the knowledge we derive from testimony,\none wonders whether one\u2019s personal experiences constitute an\nevidence base rich enough to justify the attribution of reliability to\nthe totality of the testimonial sources one tends to trust (see E.\nFricker 1994 and M. Fricker 2007 for more on this issue). An\nalternative to the track record approach would be to declare it a\nnecessary truth that trust in testimonial sources is at least prima\nfacie justified. While this view has been prominently defended, it\nrequires an explanation of what makes such trust necessarily prima\nfacie justified. Such explanations have proven to be\n controversial.[60]\n\n",
