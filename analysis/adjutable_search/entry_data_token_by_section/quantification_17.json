Historically, however, this\ncombination came under sustained attack by Quine, who, like Carnap,\nassumed that \\(\\Box\\) could only interpreted in terms of logical\nnecessity or analyticity. As Carnap himself recognized, the linguistic\nconception of necessity raises the question of how to assign\nintelligible truth conditions to de re modal generalizations\nof the form \\(\\exists x \\Box\n Px\\).[25]\n For the truth conditions for such a sentence appear to require one to\nmake sense of the truth of an open formula of the form \\(\\Box Px\\)\nwith respect to an assignment of a value to the variable \\(x\\). If we\nread \\(\\Box\\) to mean: \u201cit is analytic that\u201d, then one may\nwonder what sense could be made of the claim that an open formula\n\\(Px\\) is analytic with respect to an assignment of an object to\n\\(x\\). Quine had anticipated the issue in Quine (1943), and he pressed\nthe criticism again in Quine (1953, 1960). Quine\u2019s objections\nare commonly taken not to apply to other interpretations of \\(\\Box\\)\nin terms of metaphysical necessity as discussed, for example, in\nKripke (1980). When we move past Quine\u2019s criticisms and combine\npure quantificational logic with propositional modal logic, we obtain\nquantified modal logic.\n\nThe interaction of quantification and modality turns out to raise\ndifficult philosophical problems. As we will see, some of these\ndifficulties have, in fact, inclined some philosophers to rethink the\nscope of pure quantificational logic. The problem is that certain\ntheorems of quantified modal logic suggest that everything is\nnecessarily something. The subject matter of ontology is necessary:\nnothing could have failed to be something.\n4.4.1 Quantification and Modality\n\nQuantified modal logic is the system that combines pure\nquantificational logic with propositional modal logic. Propositional\nmodal logic investigates the logic of the modal operators \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) and is discussed in the entry on\n modal logic.\n The language of propositional modal logic supplements the language of\npropositional logic with the sentential operator \\(\\Box\\), and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) may then be explicitly defined as \\(\\neg \\Box \\neg\\). A\nweak propositional modal logic called K logic includes as axioms all\ntautologies and all instances of schema K:\n\n(K)\\(\\Box(A \\rightarrow\nB) \\rightarrow (\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box B)\\)\n\n\nThe rules of inference of the system include modus ponens and\nwhat is often known as a rule of necessitation:\n\n(RN)from \\(A\\), infer\n\\(\\Box A\\)\n\n\nThe combination of propositional modal logic and pure quantificational\nlogic is often called quantified modal logic and is discussed in\nsection 13 of the entry on\n modal logic\n and the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n This combination immediately delivers what we may call the\nnecessity of being:\n\n(NB)\\(\\forall x \\Box\n\\exists y(x=y)\\)\n\n\nThe key to this observation is that the open formula \\(\\exists y (x =\ny)\\) is a theorem of pure quantificational logic. Successive\napplications of the rule of necessitation and universal generalization\nare all it takes to complete the proof.\n\nOn the alethic interpretation of \\(\\Box\\) in terms of metaphysical\nnecessity, this theorem reads as the claim that everything is\nnecessarily something. Take the Griffith Observatory, for example. It\nis a consequence of the theorem that it is necessarily something. The\nGriffith Observatory would have been something even if no funds had\nbeen available for construction and nothing had ever been built in the\nsite it occupies. And what is true of the Griffith Observatory is true\nof us: each of us is necessarily something. When we combine this\nresult with the link between quantification and existence, we conclude\nthat everything exists necessarily, which flies in the face of the\nassumption that we exist only contingently.\n\nWith the help of schema K, one may prove the Converse Barcan\nFormula:\n\n(CBF)\\(\\Box \\forall x A\n\\rightarrow \\forall x \\Box \\ A\\)\n\n\nOn the alethic interpretation of the modality, this states that if\nnecessarily, everything is \\(A\\), everything is necessarily \\(A\\). The\nproof is given, for example, in one of the supplements to the entry on\nthe\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n But this provides another route to the necessity of being: since\nnecessarily, everything is something, everything is necessarily\nsomething. In the presence of a further plausible modal principle, B,\nwe may even prove the Barcan Formula. The Brouwerian principle, B,\nstates that whatever is the case is necessarily, possibly the\ncase:\n\n(B)\\(A \\rightarrow \\Box\n\\Diamond A\\)\n\n\nThe Barcan Formula states that if everything is necessarily \\(A\\),\nthen necessarily, everything is \\(A\\):\n\n(BF)\\(\\forall x \\Box\nA \\rightarrow \\Box \\forall x A\\)\n\n\nOr, equivalently:\n\n\\(\\Diamond \\exists x\nA \\rightarrow \\exists x \\Diamond A\\)\n\n\nThe entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate\n includes a supplement with a proof of BF against the background of\n(B). But this formula is deemed unacceptable by many philosophers.\nConsider my plans to build a bookcase. Even if I never manage to build\none, it is certainly possible for me to build one. So, it is possible\nfor there to be some bookcase I have built. By the Barcan Formula, it\nseems to follow that something is possibly a bookcase I build. The\nBarcan Formula does not settle whether or not this object is in fact a\nconcrete object, much less a bookcase one may in fact use to store\none\u2019s books. In fact, to deny this is one way to come to terms\nwith the Barcan Formula.\n4.4.2 Quantification and Tense\n\nWhat is true of the combination of pure quantificational logic with\npropositional modal logic is mutatis mutandis true of the\ncombination of pure quantificational logic and propositional tense\nlogic. Certain theorems of quantified tense logic suggest that\neverything has always been, is, and will always be something. The\ndomain of ontology is immutable: nothing ever fails to be\nsomething.\n\nPropositional tense logic investigates the logic of tense operators\nlike \\(H\\), read: \u201cit has always been the case that\u201d,\n\\(P\\), read: \u201cit was the case that\u201d, \\(G\\), read:\n\u201cit will always be the case that\u201d, and \\(F\\), read:\n\u201cit will be the case that\u201d. In place of K, we have\ndistribution axioms:\n\n\\(H(A \\rightarrow B)\n\\rightarrow (HA \\rightarrow HB)\\)\n\\(G(A \\rightarrow B)\n\\rightarrow (GA \\rightarrow GB)\\)\n\n\nAnd in place of the rule of necessitation, we have rules of temporal\ngeneralization:\n\nfrom \\(A\\), infer\n\\(HA\\)\nfrom \\(A\\), infer\n\\(GA\\)\n\n\nMore details are provided in the entry on\n temporal logic.\n\nThe combination of propositional tense logic and pure quantificational\nlogic immediately delivers the eternality of being:\n\n(EB)\\(\\forall x\n(G\\exists y(x = y) \\wedge \\exists y(x = y) \\ \\wedge F\\exists y(x =\ny))\\),\n\n\nwhich states that everything has has always been, is, and will always\nbe, something. The Griffith Observatory was something even before it\nwas built in 1935\u2014and will always be something\u2014even\nbillions of years from now. And what is true of the Griffith\nObservatory is true of us: each of us has always been, is, and will be\nsomething\u2014even before our birth and long after our death.\n\nQuantified tense logic proves temporal versions of CBF:\n\n\\(H \\forall xA\n\\rightarrow \\forall x H A\\)\n\\(G\\forall x A\n\\rightarrow \\forall x G A\\)\n\n\nAnd, finally, we have two temporal versions of BF:\n\n\\(\\forall x H A\n\\rightarrow H \\forall x A\\)\n\\(\\forall x G A\n\\rightarrow G \\forall x A\\)\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the difficulty, we may take the contrapositive\nof the temporal version of BF for \\(H\\), where \\(P\\) is defined as\nusual, as: \\(\\neg H \\neg\\):\n\n\\(P \\exists x A\n\\rightarrow \\exists x P A\\)\n\n\nWe infer, for example, that there were dinosaurs only if there are\npast dinosaurs. If to exist is to be something, then past dinosaurs\nexist. But whether this commits us to flesh-and-blood dinosaurs is of\ncourse a different matter, since being a past dinosaur need not\nrequire being a dinosaur.\n4.4.3 From Logic to Ontology\n\nThe interaction between pure quantificational logic and tense and\nmodality suggests the domain of ontology is immutable and necessary.\nBut we can only draw these conclusions by making use of some auxiliary\nassumptions, some of which are far from obvious. The highly\ncounterintuitive character of the conclusions has consequently led\nmany philosophers to place some of the auxiliary assumptions under\nclose scrutiny. Other philosophers have followed argument where it\nleads, and they have sought to reconcile the eternal and necessary\ncharacter of the domain of ontology with the apparent temporary and\ncontingent character of existence. In fact, Williamson 2013 set out to\nprovide a separate battery of arguments for the necessity and\nimmutability of ontology.\n\nOne auxiliary assumption one may question is the traditional link\nbetween quantification and existence. Even if there is no change in\nthe domain of quantification, you may nevertheless think that\nexistence is only temporary. Socrates did not exist either before 490\nBCE or after 399 BCE, and the mere fact that he is, has and will\nalways be something is not reason to attribute existence to him. One\nvariant of this move is a direct descendant of Meinong\u2019s view on\nexistence as a mere species of being. But to the extent to which\nMeinongianism may be accompanied with the implausible thesis that no\nmatter what condition we substitute for \\(F\\) in \u201cthe \\(F\\) is\n\\(F\\)\u201d gives rise to a true sentence, it would seem to entail\nthat \u201cthe round square is a round square\u201d is true, which\nseems hopeless. But the Meinongian thesis is not compulsory for more\nplausible developments of the view that not everything exists, even\nthough everything is\n something.[26]\n What is not negotiable, though, is the thesis that existence should\nnot be taken to be expressed by a quantificational expression, but\nrather by a predicate which may or not apply to objects in the domain.\nThe moral of the temporal versions of BF and CBF is only that\nunrestricted quantification ranges over an immutable and necessary\ndomain of objects, whether or not they enjoy temporary and contingent\nexistence. The difficult question remains of how to answer\nQuine\u2019s question \u201cwhat is there?\u201d once one abandons\nthe thesis that no matter what condition \\(F\\) may be, there are\nobjects that satisfy the condition. For more on different variants of\nMeinongianism, the reader may consult the entry on\n existence.\n\nThere is, in the second place, the assumption that the axioms of pure\nquantificational logic remain true when we expand the language to\ninclude other sentential operators, whether temporal, modal or\n otherwise.[27]\n What is perhaps the most common response to our predicament is to\nrecoil from pure quantificational logic into a suitably weakened\nvariant of it. This is, for example, the path taken in Kripke (1963),\nwhere Kripke proposes to weaken the axiom of universal instantiation\nin line with the first version of inclusive quantificational logic\ndiscussed earlier. Since \\(\\exists y(x = y)\\) is not a theorem of\ninclusive quantificational logic, we are not in a position to\nnecessitate, which blocks the derivation of the necessity of\n being.[28]\n Kripke\u2019s quantified modal logic is discussed in the entry on\nthe\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n Others have fallen back into alternative forms of free logic, but\nthere appears to be no consensus as to which one is the best\nalternative to pure quantificational logic. It may be helpful to note,\nhowever, that some of the relevant free logics merely restrict the\naxiom of universal instantiation by means of an existence predicate\nand do nothing to block the derivation of other allegedly problematic\nprinciples such as the necessity of identity, which is the thesis that\neverything is necessarily self-identical. Since, presumably, an object\ncan only be necessarily self-identical if it exists necessarily,\nopponents of CBF will also want to have some resources to block the\nnecessity of identity.\n\nThe derivability of the necessity of identity from the axioms of\nidentity and the rule of necessitation may perhaps invite one to\nconsider another option. Maybe the culprit is not pure\nquantificational logic, but rather the indiscriminate use of the rule\nof necessitation. The rationale for necessitation is that every\nprovable sentence should be necessarily true, but it is not clear how\nthis thought is supposed to generalize to open formulas, which,\nstrictly speaking, are not true or false. Open formulas are merely\ntrue or false under an assignment of values to their free variables.\nBut the fact that \\(x = x\\), for example, is true under an assignment\n\\(s\\) on which \\(x\\) is assigned a table is no reason to think that\n\\(x = x\\) is necessarily true under such an assignment if you think\nthat the table could have not been\nthere.[29]\nOne problem for\nthis strategy is that it is of little help when we allow closed terms\nsuch as constant symbols into the language of quantified modal\nlogic. In the presence of constant symbols, classical quantificational\nlogic allows us to derive the sentence \\(\\exists x (a = x)\\) as a\ntheorem, whence, by necessitation for complete sentences, we infer\n\\(\\Box \\exists x(a = x)\\), which seems objectionable if \\(a\\) is\nsuppose to regiment a name for an object that exists only\ncontingently. One could avoid the problems by barring closed terms\nfrom the language, but such a radical exclusion seems ad hoc\nand artificial. So, if one chooses to restrict necessitation, one must\nprovide a different rationale for it. Deutsch (1990) provides an\nexample of this strategy.\n\nThe fourth and final option to consider is to take the derivability of\nCBF in tense and modal logic at face value, and embrace the conclusion\nthat existence is indeed immutable and necessary. These are the theses\nthat Williamson (2013) calls \u201cpermanentism\u201d and\n\u201cnecessitism\u201d. The task for each approach is to explain\nour initial reluctance to embrace them in the first place. Take the\napparent resistance to accept the claim that Socrates will always be\nsomething despite the fact that he died in 399 BCE. The permanentist\nmay respond that if we are initially disinclined to accept this claim,\nit is only because we mistakenly think that because a person, for\nexample, is a concrete object, a past or a future person must be\nconcrete as well. Socrates, which is a past person, was not a person\neither before 490 BCE or after 399 BCE; indeed, Socrates is now not a\nperson, nor will he be one in the future. Likewise, a merely possible\nperson need not be a person either and neither the Barcan nor the\nConverse Barcan Formula threaten the temporary and contingent\ncharacter of concreteness. Since I could have found the time, skill\nand energy to build a bookcase, some object is possibly a bookcase\nbuilt by me. But the necessitist will be at pains to add that to be a\npossible bookcase built by me is not to be a bookcase built by me,\nmuch less a bookcase. This outlook is defended by Linsky & Zalta\n(1994) and Williamson (2013). But there are other points of contact.\nFor example, all versions of necessitism must reject unqualified\n\u201cessentialist\u201d theses such as the view that a person is\nnecessarily a person; at most, one can perhaps maintain the weaker\nthesis that a person is necessarily if concrete, a person. Likewise,\nall versions of necessitism seem committed to the actual existence of\nmany more nonsets than can form a set. Sider (2009), for example,\nargues that necessitism is committed to the actual existence of at\nleast \\(\\kappa\\) nonsets for each set-theoretic cardinal \\(\\kappa\\).\nAnd Hawthorne & Uzquiano (2011) raises other cardinality problems\nfor a combination of necessitism with certain common mereological\nassumptions.",
