    "main_text": "Evolutionary Game Theory\n7. Evolutionary Game Theory\n\nGintis (2009b,\n 2009b) feels justified in stating that \u201cgame theory is a\nuniversal language for the unification of the behavioral\nsciences.\u201d There are good examples of such unifying work.\nBinmore\n (1998,\n 2005a) models history of increasing social complexity as a\nseries of convergences on increasingly efficient equilibria in\ncommonly encountered transaction games, interrupted by episodes in\nwhich some people try to shift to new equilibria by moving off stable\nequilibrium paths, resulting in periodic catastrophes. (Stalin, for\nexample, tried to shift his society to a set of equilibria in which\npeople cared more about the future industrial, military and political\npower of their state than they cared about their own lives. He was not\nsuccessful in the long run; however, his efforts certainly created a\nsituation in which, for a few decades, many Soviet people attached far\nless importance to other people\u2019s lives than usual.) A\ngame-theoretic perspective indeed seems pervasively useful in\nunderstanding phenomena across the full range of social sciences. In\n Section 4,\n for example, we considered Lewis\u2019s recognition that each human\nlanguage amounts to a network of Nash equilibria in coordination games\naround conveyance of information.\n\nGiven his work\u2019s vintage, Lewis restricted his attention to\nstatic game theory, in which agents are modeled as deliberately\nchoosing strategies given exogenously fixed\nutility-functions. As a result of this restriction, his account\ninvited some philosophers to pursue a misguided quest for a general\nanalytic theory of the rationality of conventions (as noted by\n Bickhard 2008).\n Though Binmore has criticized this focus repeatedly through a\ncareer\u2019s worth of contributions (see the references for a\nselection),\n Gintis (2009a)\n has recently isolated the underlying problem with particular clarity\nand tenacity. NE and SPE are brittle solution concepts when\napplied to naturally evolved computational mechanisms like animal\n(including human) brains. As we saw in\n Section 3\n above, in coordination (and other) games with multiple NE, what it is\neconomically rational for a player to do is highly sensitive to the\nlearning states of other players. In general, when players find\nthemselves in games where they do not have strictly dominant\nstrategies, they only have uncomplicated incentives to play NE or SPE\nstrategies to the extent that other players can be expected to find\ntheir NE or SPE strategies. Can a general theory of\nstrategic rationality, of the sort that philosophers have sought, be\nreasonably expected to cover the resulting contingencies? Resort to\nBayesian reasoning principles, as we reviewed in\n Section 3.1,\n is the standard way of trying to incorporate such uncertainty into\ntheories of rational, strategic decision. However, as\n Binmore (2009)\n argues following the lead of\n Savage (1954),\n Bayesian principles are only plausible as principles of\nrationality itself in so-called \u2018small worlds\u2019, that\nis, environments in which distributions of risk are quantified in a\nset of known and enumerable parameters, as in the solution to our\nriver crossing game from\n Section 3.\n In large worlds, where utility functions, strategy sets and\ninformational structure are difficult to estimate and subject to\nchange by contingent exogenous influences, the idea that Bayes\u2019s\nrule tells players how to \u2018be rational\u2019 is quite\nimplausible. But then why should we expect players to choose NE or SPE\nor sequential-equilibrium strategies in wide ranges of social\ninteractions?\n\nAs\n Binmore (2009)\n and\n Gintis (2009a)\n both stress, if game theory is to be used to model actual, natural\nbehavior and its history, outside of the small-world settings on which\nmicroeconomists (but not macroeconomists or political scientists or\nsociologists or philosophers of science) mainly traffic, then we need\nsome account of what is attractive about equilibria in games even when\nno analysis can identify them by taming all uncertainty in such a way\nthat it can be represented as pure risk. To make reference again to\nLewis\u2019s topic, when human language developed there was no\nexternal referee to care about and arrange for Pareto-efficiency by\nproviding focal points for coordination. Yet somehow people agreed,\nwithin linguistic communities, to use roughly the same words and\nconstructions to say similar things. It seems unlikely that any\nexplicit, deliberate strategizing on anyone\u2019s part played a role\nin these processes. Nevertheless, game theory has turned out to\nfurnish the essential concepts for understanding stabilization of\nlanguages. This is a striking point of support for Gintis\u2019s\noptimism about the reach of game theory. To understand it, we must\nextend our attention to evolutionary games.\n\nGame theory has been fruitfully applied in evolutionary biology, where\nspecies and/or genes are treated as players, since pioneering work by\n Maynard Smith (1982)\n and his collaborators. Evolutionary (or dynamic) game theory\nsubsequently developed into a significant mathematical extension, with\nseveral distinct sub-extensions, applicable to many settings apart\nfrom the biological.\n Skyrms (1996)\n uses evolutionary game theory to try to answer questions Lewis could\nnot even ask, about the conditions under which language, concepts of\njustice, the notion of private property, and other non-designed,\ngeneral phenomena of interest to philosophers would be likely to\narise. What is novel about evolutionary game theory is that moves are\nnot chosen through deliberation by the individual agents. Instead,\nagents are typically hard-wired with particular strategies, and\nsuccess for a strategy is defined in terms of the number of copies of\nitself that it will leave to play in the games of succeeding\ngenerations, given a population in which other strategies with which\nit acts are distributed at particular frequencies. In this kind of\nproblem setting, the strategies themselves are the players, and\nindividuals who play these strategies are their relatively blind\nexecutors, who receive the immediate-run costs and benefits associated\nwith outcomes not because they choose the outcomes in question, but\nbecause ancestors from whom they inherited their strategic\ndispositions recurrently benefited from the outcomes of their\nsimilar games.\n\nThe discussion here will closely follow Skyrms\u2019s. This involves\na restriction in generality. Reference was made above to evolutionary\ngame theory as including \u2018distinct sub-extensions\u2019. What\nwas meant by that is that, like classical game theory, it features a\nplurality of \u2018solution\u2019 concepts. Strictly speaking, these\nare different concepts of dynamic stability, which is a\ndifferent idea of equilibrium from the economic equilibrium notion\nrepresented by classical game-theoretic literal solution\nconcepts. An extensive literature (see immediately below) maps the\nstability concepts for evolutionary games onto the classical solution\nconcepts. Reviewing the range of stability concepts would involve\nredundancy in the present context, because that is the main task of a\nsister entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by J.\nMcKenzie Alexander:\n Game Theory, Evolutionary.\n This complements a fuller exposition with emphasis on philosophical\nissues in\n Alexander (2023),\n which in turn rests on formal foundations reviewed in classic texts\nby\n Weibull (1995)\n and\n Samuelson (1997).\n The Skyrms analysis summarized here relies on just one of the\nstability concepts, the replicator dynamics.\n\nConsider how natural selection works to change lineages of animals,\nmodifying, creating and destroying species. The basic mechanism is\ndifferential reproduction. Any animal with heritable\nfeatures that increase its expected relative frequency of\noffspring in a population of organisms will tend to increase in\nprevalence so long as the environment remains relatively stable. These\noffspring will typically inherit the features in question (with some\nvariation due to mutations, and some variation in frequencies due to\nstatistical noise). Therefore, the proportion of these features in the\npopulation will gradually increase as generations pass. Some of these\nfeatures may go to fixation, that is, eventually take over\nthe entire population (until the environment changes).\n\nHow does game theory enter into this? Often, one of the most important\naspects of an organism\u2019s environment will be the behavioural\ntendencies of other organisms. We can think of each lineage as\n\u2018trying\u2019 to maximize its reproductive fitness (i.e.,\nfuture frequencies of its distinctive genetic structures) through\nfinding strategies that are optimal given the strategies of other\nlineages. So evolutionary theory is another domain of application for\nnon-parametric analysis.\n\nIn evolutionary game theory, we no longer think of individuals as\nchoosing strategies as they move from one game to another. This is\nbecause our interests are different. We\u2019re now concerned less\nwith finding the equilibria of single games than with discovering\nwhich equilibria are stable, and how they will change over time. So we\nnow model the strategies themselves as playing against each\nother. One strategy is \u2018better\u2019 than another if it is\nlikely to leave more copies of itself in the next generation, when the\ngame will be played again. We study the changes in distribution of\nstrategies in the population as the sequence of games unfolds.\n\nFor the replicator dynamics, we introduce a new dynamic stability\n(\u2018equilibrium\u2019) concept, due to\n Maynard Smith (1982).\n A set of strategies, in some particular proportion (e.g., 1/3:2/3,\n1/2:1/2, 1/9:8/9, 1/3:1/3:1/6:1/6\u2014always summing to 1) is at an\nESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) equilibrium just in case\n(1) no individual playing one strategy could improve its reproductive\nfitness by switching to one of the other strategies in the proportion,\nand (2) no mutant playing a different strategy altogether could\nestablish itself (\u2018invade\u2019) in the population.\n\nThe principles of evolutionary game theory are best explained through\nexamples. Skyrms begins by investigating the conditions under which a\nsense of justice\u2014understood for purposes of his specific\nanalysis as a disposition to view equal divisions of resources as fair\nunless efficiency considerations suggest otherwise in special\ncases\u2014might arise. He asks us to consider a population in which\nindividuals regularly meet each other and must bargain over resources.\nBegin with three types of individuals:\n\nFairmen always demand exactly half the resource.\nGreedies always demand more than half the resource. When\na greedy encounters another greedy, they waste the resource in\nfighting over it.\nModests always demand less than half the resource. When a\nmodest encounters another modest, they take less than all of the\navailable resource and waste some.\n\n\nEach single encounter where the total demands sum to 100% is\na NE of that individual game. Similarly, there can be many dynamic\nequilibria. Suppose that Greedies demand 2/3 of the resource and\nModests demand 1/3. Then, given random pairing for interaction, the\nfollowing two proportions are ESSs: \n\nHalf the population is greedy and half is modest. We can calculate\nthe average payoff here. Modest gets 1/3 of the resource in every\nencounter. Greedy gets 2/3 when she meets Modest, but nothing when she\nmeets another Greedy. So her average payoff is also 1/3. This is an\nESS because Fairman can\u2019t invade. When Fairman meets Modest he\ngets 1/2. But when Fairman meets Greedy he gets nothing. So his\naverage payoff is only 1/4. No Modest has an incentive to change\nstrategies, and neither does any Greedy. A mutant Fairman arising in\nthe population would do worst of all, and so selection will not\nencourage the propagation of any such mutants.\nAll players are Fairmen. Everyone always gets half the resource,\nand no one can do better by switching to another strategy. Greedies\nentering this population encounter Fairmen and get an average payoff\nof 0. Modests get 1/3 as before, but this is less than Fairman\u2019s\npayoff of 1/2.\n\n\nNotice that equilibrium (i) is inefficient, since the average payoff\nacross the whole population is smaller. However, just as inefficient\noutcomes can be NE of static games, so they can be ESSs of\nevolutionary ones. \n\nWe refer to equilibria in which more than one strategy occurs as\npolymorphisms. In general, in Skyrms\u2019s game, any\npolymorphism in which Greedy demands \\(x\\) and Modest demands \\(1-x\\)\nis an ESS. The question that interests the student of justice concerns\nthe relative likelihood with which these different equilibria\narise.\n\nThis depends on the proportions of strategies in the original\npopulation state. If the population begins with more than one Fairman,\nthen there is some probability that Fairmen will encounter each other,\nand get the highest possible average payoff. Modests by themselves do\nnot inhibit the spread of Fairmen; only Greedies do. But Greedies\nthemselves depend on having Modests around in order to be viable. So\nthe more Fairmen there are in the population relative to\npairs of Greedies and Modests, the better Fairmen do on\naverage. This implies a threshold effect. If the proportion of Fairmen\ndrops below 33%, then the tendency will be for them to fall to\nextinction because they don\u2019t meet each other often enough. If\nthe population of Fairmen rises above 33%, then the tendency will be\nfor them to rise to fixation because their extra gains when they meet\neach other compensates for their losses when they meet Greedies. You\ncan see this by noticing that when each strategy is used by 33% of the\npopulation, all have an expected average payoff of 1/3. Therefore, any\nrise above this threshold on the part of Fairmen will tend to push\nthem towards fixation.\n\nThis result shows that and how, given certain relatively general\nconditions, justice as we have defined it can arise\ndynamically. The news for the fans of justice gets more cheerful still\nif we introduce correlated play (not to be confused with the\ncorrelated equilibrium concept mentioned in\n Section 3.1\n and elsewhere in this article).\n\nThe model we just considered assumes that strategies are not\ncorrelated, that is, that the probability with which every strategy\nmeets every other strategy is a simple function of their relative\nfrequencies in the population. We now examine what happens in our\ndynamic resource-division game when we introduce correlation. Suppose\nthat Fairmen have a slight ability to distinguish and seek out other\nFairmen as interaction partners. In that case, Fairmen on average do\nbetter, and this must have the effect of lowering their threshold for\ngoing to fixation.\n\nAn evolutionary game modeler studies the effects of correlation and\nother parametric constraints by means of running large computer\nsimulations in which the strategies compete with one another, round\nafter round, in the virtual environment. The starting proportions of\nstrategies, and any chosen degree of correlation, can simply be set in\nthe program. One can then watch its dynamics unfold over time, and\nmeasure the proportion of time it stays in any one equilibrium. These\nproportions are represented by the relative sizes of the basins of\nattraction for different possible equilibria. Equilibria are\nattractor points in a dynamic space; a basin of attraction for each\nsuch point is then the set of points in the space from which the\npopulation will converge to the equilibrium in question.\n\nIn introducing correlation into his model, Skyrms first sets the\ndegree of correlation at a very small .1. This causes the basin of\nattraction for equilibrium (i) to shrink by half. When the degree of\ncorrelation is set to .2, the polymorphic basin reduces to the point\nat which the population starts in the polymorphism. Thus very small\nincreases in correlation produce large proportionate increases in the\nstability of the equilibrium where everyone plays Fairman. A small\namount of correlation is a reasonable assumption in most populations,\ngiven that neighbours tend to interact with one another and to mimic\none another (either genetically or because of tendencies to\ndeliberately copy each other), and because genetically and culturally\nsimilar animals are more likely to live in common environments. Thus\nif justice can arise at all it will tend to be dominant and\nstable.\n\nMuch of political philosophy consists in attempts to produce deductive\nnormative arguments intended to convince an unjust agent that she has\nreasons to act justly. Skyrms\u2019s analysis suggests a quite\ndifferent approach. Fairman will do best of all in the dynamic game if\nhe takes active steps to preserve correlation. Therefore, there is\nevolutionary pressure for both moral approval of justice and\njust institutions to arise. Most people may think that\n50\u201350 splits are \u2018fair\u2019, and worth maintaining by\nmoral and institutional reward and sanction, because we are\nthe products of a dynamic game that promoted our tendency to think\nthis way.\n\nThe topic that has received most attention from evolutionary game\ntheorists is altruism, defined as any behaviour by an\norganism that decreases its own expected fitness in a single\ninteraction but increases that of the other interactor. It is arguably\ncommon in nature. How can it arise, however, given Darwinian\ncompetition?\n\nSkyrms studies this question using the dynamic Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma as his example. This is simply a series of PD games played in\na population, some of whose members are defectors and some of whom are\ncooperators. Payoffs, as always in evolutionary games, are measured in\nterms of expected numbers of copies of each strategy in future\ngenerations.\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{U}(A)\\) be the average fitness of strategy \\(A\\) in the\npopulation. Let \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) be the average fitness of the whole\npopulation. Then the proportion of strategy \\(A\\) in the next\ngeneration is just the ratio \\(\\mathbf{U}(A)/\\mathbf{U}\\). So if \\(A\\)\nhas greater fitness than the population average \\(A\\) increases. If\n\\(A\\) has lower fitness than the population average then \\(A\\)\ndecreases.\n\nIn the dynamic PD where interaction is random (i.e., there\u2019s no\ncorrelation), defectors do better than the population average as long\nas there are cooperators around. This follows from the fact that, as\nwe saw in\n Section 2.4,\n defection is always the dominant strategy in a single game. 100%\ndefection is therefore the ESS in the dynamic game without\ncorrelation, corresponding to the NE in the one-shot static PD.\n\nHowever, introducing the possibility of correlation radically changes\nthe picture. We now need to compute the average fitness of a strategy\ngiven its probability of meeting each other possible\nstrategy. In the evolutionary PD, cooperators whose probability\nof meeting other cooperators is high do better than defectors whose\nprobability of meeting other defectors is high. Correlation thus\nfavours cooperation.\n\nIn order to be able to say something more precise about this\nrelationship between correlation and cooperation (and in order to be\nable to relate evolutionary game theory to issues in decision theory,\na matter falling outside the scope of this article), Skyrms introduces\na new technical concept. He calls a strategy adaptively\nratifiable if there is a region around its fixation point in the\ndynamic space such that from anywhere within that region it will go to\nfixation. In the evolutionary PD, both defection and cooperation are\nadaptively ratifiable. The relative sizes of basins of attraction are\nhighly sensitive to the particular mechanisms by which correlation is\nachieved. To illustrate this point, Skyrms builds several\nexamples.\n\nOne of Skyrms\u2019s models introduces correlation by means of a\nfilter on pairing for interaction. Suppose that in round 1 of\na dynamic PD individuals inspect each other and interact, or not,\ndepending on what they find. In the second and subsequent rounds, all\nindividuals who didn\u2019t pair in round 1 are randomly paired. In\nthis game, the basin of attraction for defection is large\nunless there is a high proportion of cooperators in round\none. In this case, defectors fail to pair in round 1, then get paired\nmostly with each other in round 2 and drive each other to extinction.\nA model which is more interesting, because its mechanism is less\nartificial, does not allow individuals to choose their partners, but\nrequires them to interact with those closest to them. Because of\ngenetic relatedness (or cultural learning by copying) individuals are\nmore likely to resemble their neighbours than not. If this (finite)\npopulation is arrayed along one dimension (i.e., along a line), and\nboth cooperators and defectors are introduced into positions along it\nat random, then we get the following dynamics. Isolated cooperators\nhave lower expected fitness than the surrounding defectors and are\ndriven locally to extinction. Members of groups of two cooperators\nhave a 50% probability of interacting with each other, and a 50%\nprobability of each interacting with a defector. As a result, their\naverage expected fitness remains smaller than that of their\nneighbouring defectors, and they too face probable extinction. Groups\nof three cooperators form an unstable point from which both extinction\nand expansion are equally likely. However, in groups of four or more\ncooperators at least one encounter of a cooperator with a cooperator\nsufficient to at least replace the original group is guaranteed. Under\nthis circumstance, the cooperators as a group do better than the\nsurrounding defectors and increase at their expense. Eventually\ncooperators go almost to fixation\u2014but nor quite. Single\ndefectors on the periphery of the population prey on the cooperators\nat the ends and survive as little \u2018criminal communities\u2019.\nWe thus see that altruism can not only be maintained by the dynamics\nof evolutionary games, but, with correlation, can even spread and\ncolonize originally non-altruistic populations.\n\nDarwinian dynamics thus offers qualified good news for cooperation.\nNotice, however, that this holds only so long as individuals are stuck\nwith their natural or cultural programming and can\u2019t re-evaluate\ntheir utilities for themselves. If our agents get too smart and\nflexible, they may notice that they\u2019re in PDs and would each be\nbest off defecting. In that case, they\u2019ll eventually drive\nthemselves to extinction\u2014unless they develop stable, and\neffective, norms that work to reinforce cooperation. But, of course,\nthese are just what we would expect to evolve in populations of\nanimals whose average fitness levels are closely linked to their\ncapacities for successful social cooperation. Even given this, these\npopulations will go extinct unless they care about future generations\nfor some reason. But there\u2019s no non-sentimental reason that\ndoesn\u2019t already presuppose altruistic morality as to why agents\nshould care about future generations if each new generation\nwholly replaces the preceding one at each change of cohorts. For this\nreason, economists use \u2018overlapping generations\u2019 models\nwhen modeling intertemporal distribution games. Individuals in\ngeneration 1 who will last until generation 5 save resources for the\ngeneration 3 individuals with whom they\u2019ll want to cooperate;\nand by generation 3 the new individuals care about generation 6; and\nso on.\n\nGintis (2009a)\n argues that when we set out to use evolutionary game theory to unify\nthe behavioral sciences, we should begin by using it to unify game\ntheory itself. We have pointed out at several earlier points in the\npresent article that NE and SPE are problematic solution concepts in\nmany applications where stable norms or explicit institutional rules\nare missing because agents only have incentives to play NE or SPE to\nthe extent that they are confident that other agents will do likewise.\nTo the extent that agents do not have such confidence, what should be\npredicted is general disorder and social confusion. But now we can\npull together a number of strands from earlier sections. From\n Aumann (1974),\n we have the result that correlated equilibrium can solve this problem\nfor Bayesian learners under certain conditions. Gintis makes this\nconcrete by imagining the presence of what he calls a\n\u2018choreographer\u2019. Evolutionary game theory shows how a\nDarwinian selection process can serve as such a choreographer.\n\nBut then where intelligent strategic agents, such as humans, are\nconcerned, the natural choreographer can be usurped, because the\nagents might aim to optimize utility functions where the arguments do\nnot correspond to the fitness criteria on which their selection\nhistory operated. Then the players need equilibrium selection\nmechanisms of some kind to avoid miscoordination. Cultural evolution,\nanother Darwinian selection process, might provide them with norms\nthat serve as focal points. This is not sufficient to ensure\napplication of the Harsanyi Doctrine, which is needed to ensure\nidentification of correlated equilibrium\n (Aumann 1987).\n A main problem is that norms can unravel if they depend on preference\nfalsification. But people can negotiate new norms on the fly through\nmindshaping. Conditional game theory (2.0) provides one model of the\nstrategic aspect of such mindshaping, which also allows players to\nlearn about one another\u2019s systematic departures from expected\nutility theory and thus recover the conditions for the Harsanyi\nDoctrine to apply.\n\nBut, of course, real humans often encounter one another as cultural\nstrangers, who \u2018play for real\u2019 without prior opportunities\nfor fully informative pre-play. When we wonder about the value of\ngame-theoretic models in application to human behavior outside of\nwell-structured markets or tightly regulated institutional settings,\nmuch hinges on what we take to be plausible and empirically validated\nsources of coordinated information and beliefs. When and how can we\nsuppose that people have incentives to access such information and\nbeliefs, which typically involves costs? This has been a subject of\nextensive recent debate, which we will review in\n Section 8.3\n below.\n",
