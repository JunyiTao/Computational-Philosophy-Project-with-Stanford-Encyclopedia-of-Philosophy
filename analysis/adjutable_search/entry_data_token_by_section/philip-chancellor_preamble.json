    "main_text": "\n\n\nPhilip the Chancellor was an influential figure in a number of\ndifferent circles in the first half of the thirteenth century. He\nenjoyed a long though rather turbulent ecclesiastical career and was\nfamous for his sermons and his lyric poetry, the latter of which has\nreceived attention by a number of musicologists in recent years (see\nDronke 1987, Payne 1991, Traill 2003). In the areas of philosophy and\ntheology, his major work, Summa de bono, which was composed\nsometime in the 1220s\u20131230s, was a ground-breaking achievement\nin many ways. Philip was one of the first to organize a Summa\naround a central foundational principle, the notion of the\ngood. Summa de bono also contains most likely the earliest\ntreatment of a topic that rose to prominence in the later medieval\nperiod, the doctrine of the transcendentals. Elements of Philip\u2019s\ntheory of action drew comments from such later notables as Albert the\nGreat. Summa de bono was a well-respected and influential\nwork in the thirteenth century (see Keeler 1937, Callus 1941\u201343,\nPrincipe 1962). \n",
