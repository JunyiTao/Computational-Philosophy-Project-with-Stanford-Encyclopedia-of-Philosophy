    "main_text": "\n\nOver the past four decades, philosophy of science has grown\nincreasingly \u201clocal\u201d. Concerns have switched from general\nfeatures of scientific practice to concepts, issues, and puzzles\nspecific to particular disciplines. Philosophy of neuroscience is one\nnatural result. This emerging area was also spurred by remarkable\ngrowth in the neurosciences themselves. Cognitive and computational\nneuroscience continues to encroach directly on issues traditionally\naddressed within the humanities, including the nature of\nconsciousness, action, knowledge, and normativity. Cellular,\nmolecular, and behavioral neuroscience using animal models\nincreasingly encroaches on cognitive neuroscience\u2019s domain.\nEmpirical discoveries about brain structure and function suggest ways\nthat \u201cnaturalistic\u201d programs might develop in detail,\nbeyond the abstract philosophical considerations in their favor.\n\nThe literature has distinguished \u201cphilosophy of\nneuroscience\u201d from \u201cneurophilosophy\u201d for two\ndecades. The former concerns foundational issues within the\nneurosciences. The latter concerns application of neuroscientific\nconcepts to traditional philosophical questions. Exploring various\nconcepts of representation employed in neuroscientific theories is an\nexample of the former. Examining implications of neurological\nsyndromes for the concept of a unified self is an example of the\nlatter. In this entry, we will develop this distinction further and\ndiscuss examples of both. Just as has happened in the field\u2019s\nhistory, work in both of these areas is scattered throughout most all\nsections below. Throughout we will try to specify which area landmark\nwork falls into, when this location isn\u2019t obvious.\n\nOne exciting aspect about working in philosophy of neuroscience or\nneurophilosophy is the continual element of surprise. Both fields\ndepend squarely on developments in neuroscience, and one simply has no\ninkling what\u2019s coming down the pike in that incredibly\nfast-moving science. Last year\u2019s speculative fiction is this\nyear\u2019s scientific reality. But this feature makes a once-a-half\ndecade updated encyclopedia entry difficult to manage. The scientific\ndetails philosophers were reflecting on at past updates can now read\nwoefully dated. Yet one also wants to capture some history of the\nongoing fields. Our solution to this dilemma has been to keep previous\ndiscussions, to reflect that history, but to add more recent\nscientific and philosophical updates, not only to sections of this\nentry added at later times, but also peppered through the earlier\ndiscussions. It\u2019s not always a perfect solution, but it does\npreserve something of the history of the philosophy of neuroscience\nand neurophilosophy against the continual advances in the sciences\nthese philosophical fields depend upon. \n",
