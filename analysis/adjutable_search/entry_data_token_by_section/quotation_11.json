    "main_text": "Five Theories of Quotation || Disquotational Theory of Quotation\n3.4 Disquotational Theory of Quotation\n\nLess baroque than the Demonstrative Theory, the Disquotational Theory\nis probably the simplest, most natural and obvious account of\nquotation. It is endorsed by a wide range of authors, often in\npassing, as if completely obvious. A simple version of it can be found\nin Richard\u2019s Disquotational Schema (DQR):\n\nDQR: For any expression \\(e\\), the left quote (lq) followed by e\nfollowed by the right quote (rq) denotes e (Richard 1986, p. 397)\n\nLudwig and Ray write:\n\nIts semantic function is given by the following reference clause in\nthe theory: (ref\\((\\ulcorner\\)\u2018E\u2019\\(\\urcorner)\n=\\) E (Ludwig and Ray, 1998, p.163, note 43)\n\n\nwhere the \u2018\\(\\ulcorner\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\urcorner\\)\u2019 are the left and right corner quotes.\n(See also Smullyan 1957, Mates 1972, p. 21; Wallace 1972, p. 237;\nSalmon 1986, p. 6, Gomez-Torrente 2001, Botteral and Stainton 2005. A\nnearby view is the minimalism of Cappelen and Lepore 2007; discussion\nof it can be found in Garcia-Carpintero 2011.)\n\nOn this account, quotations are not proper names, or descriptions or\ndemonstratives but rather they are functors that take an expression as\ntheir argument and return it as value.\n3.4.1 Strengths of Disquotational Theory\n\nThe two most obvious strengths of the Disquotational Theory are its\nsimplicity and intuitiveness. If asked how quotation functions, the\nobvious reply is something along the lines of (DQR). It is also an\naxiom (or axiom schema) that\u2019s pleasingly simple and requires no\ncomplicated assumptions about the surface structure of the sentence\n(in this respect, it has a clear edge on the Demonstrative\nTheory).\n\nIn addition to be being exceedingly simple and intuitive, this theory\neasily accounts for three of the Basic Facts about Quotation.\n\nFirst, it explains opacity: \u2018bachelor\u2019 and\n\u2018unmarried man\u2019 have different semantic values because\nwhat is between the quotation marks are distinct expressions. An\nexpression\u2019s semantic value is irrelevant for determining the\nsemantic value of the quotation of that expression, thus accounting\nfor (BQ1).\n\nSecond, since quotations are functor expressions without internal\nstructure, (BQ2) is explained: there\u2019s no possibility of\nquantifying into a quotation on this view.\n\nFinally, since quotations, as functors, map all expressions onto\nthemselves, this account can explain the special relationship between\na quotation and the quoted expression\u2014namely,\nidentity\u2014thus explaining (BQ4).\n3.4.2 Weaknesses of the Disquotational Theory\n\nEven with these advantages, at least three serious difficulties\nconfront the Disquotational Theory. First, (BQ3) says that we can\nuse quotation to refer to symbols that are not in the English lexicon,\nas in (9) and (10):\n\n\n(9)\n\u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 is not a part of any English expression.\n(10)\n\u2018\u2766\u2019 is not an expression in any language.\n\n\n(DQR) says we can take any expression e, put quotation marks\naround e, and what results is an expression that refers to e. What\nexactly is meant by \u2018any expression\u2019 in (DQR)? Richard\noffers the following answer:\n\nIt is easy enough to come up with a finite list of\nelements (the letters, punctuation symbols, the digits, the space,\netc.) and an operation (concatenation) with which one can generate all\nof the concatenates\u2026If we are formalizing a grammar for a\nlanguage with quotation names, we would include, as part of the\nspecification of the lexicon, a proviso to the effect that, for each\nconcatenate e, the left quote (lq), followed by e, followed by the\nright quote (rq) is a singular term (Richard 1986, pp. 386\u201389,\nour emphasis).\n\n\nIf this is how expressions are generated, how then are we to account\nfor the truth of (9) and (10)? More generally, the worry is this:\n(DQR) needs to specify, in some manner or other, the domain of\nexpressions over which it quantifies. How can it do this without\nunreasonably limiting the kinds of symbols that can be\n quoted?[11]\n (See Lepore (1999) for elaboration on this point.)\n\nSecond, according to (BQ6), a theory of quotation should leave room\nfor dual use and mention. It is hard to see how (DQR) leaves such\nroom. If quotes are referring expressions (as they are according to\nDQR), then if we let \u2018Ted\u2019 name the expression \u2018has\na certain anomalous feature\u2019, (12) should say the same as,\nexpress the same proposition as, (17).\n\n(12)\nQuine said that quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n(17)\nQuine said that quotation Ted.\n\n\nNot only should (12) and (17) express the same proposition, according\nto DQR, they should also have the same logical form. That\u2019s an\nobviously incorrect account of (12). (For further discussion of mixed\nquotation see\n Section 4\n below.)\n\nFinally, those who raise Objection 4 against the Demonstrative Theory\nwould probably raise the same objection here: the Disquotational\nTheory fails to account for quotation without quotation marks. All the\nwork is being done by quotation marks, so there\u2019s no room for\nquotation without quotation marks. (DQR) proponents would presumably\nbe as unimpressed as Demonstrative Theorists and their replies would\nbe much the same (see above).\n",
