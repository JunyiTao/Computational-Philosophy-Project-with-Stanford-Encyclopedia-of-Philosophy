    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Sexual Preferences and Orientation\n1.4 Sexual Preferences and Orientation\n\nSexual orientation is commonly understood as a person\u2019s standing\nsexual preference for men, women, or both. It is a basic preference,\nunlike, say, the preference for hair color or buttock size. It is also\nan organizing preference: other sexual preferences are built upon it\n(Stein 1999, ch. 2). A foot fetishist is either gay, straight or\nbisexual, before he is a foot fetishist, though it is an empirical\nquestion whether there can be sexual orientations for body parts (or\nobjects) regardless of the gender or sex of the person\u2019s body\npart (Stein 1999, ch. 2; Wilkerson 2013). It is unclear, however, how\nto distinguish orientations from mere preferences; saying that the\nformer are basic whereas the latter are not seems to merely reflect\ncommon views of the distinction (Dembroff 2016, 12; Stock 2019, 315).\nHalwani (forthcoming) argues that, given the importance we attach to\norientations, it is a necessary condition for a sexual desire to be an\norientation that its fulfillment is needed for the well-being of the\nperson with the desire, whereas preferences are not tied to well-being\nin such strong ways.\n\nMere sexual preferences vary tremendously, targeting people, objects,\nactivities, and sexual positions, probably because they are a function\nof the person\u2019s individual history and the available social and\ncultural options (on this variety, see Love 1992). Some preferences\nare considered perverted (e.g., coprophilia), some immoral (e.g.,\npedophilia), and some both. Yet with others it is not so obvious, such\nas sexual preferences for members of particular races or ethnic\ngroups. Perhaps X\u2019s preference for Asian women is\ninnocent, on a par with the preference for tall people. But it might\nalso indicate an ethical fault if, say, racially ugly stereotypes\ninform it (Barn 2022; Halwani 2017b [2022]; Kershnar 2019; Zheng\n2016).\n\nReturning to sexual orientation, some philosophers have claimed that\nits popular conception relies on dubious assumptions (Corvino 2006a;\nDembroff 2016).\n\n(1)\nIt assumes three basic orientations: homosexual, heterosexual, and\nbisexual (or only two if one thinks, as does Kathleen Stock, that\nbisexuality is not a third orientation but an amalgam of the other\ntwo, such that bisexuals have two sexual orientations, heterosexuality\nand homosexuality [2019, 298\u2013300]).\n(2)\nIt includes the gender or sex of the person who has the\norientation as an essential element of the orientation;\nX\u2019s being gay means that X has the same\nsex/gender as the target of the orientation.\n(3)\nIt is ambiguous between sex and gender: is a straight man\nattracted to the gender or the sex of women? And is the man straight\nbecause of his gender or sex?\n(4)\nIt assumes a binary of gender/sex for both parties, excluding\npeople who exist outside the binary.\n(5)\nIt is ambiguous between sexual and emotional attraction: if a man\nis emotionally attracted to other men, does that mean that he is gay\nor something else?\n(6)\nIt is silent on what counts as the basic components of the\norientation: is it behavior, desires, or fantasies?\n(7)\nFinally, it assumes the cross-temporal and cross-cultural\nexistence of the three sexual orientations: there were gay men and gay\nwomen in 15th century Russia just as there were in\n21st century North America, albeit with adjustment for\ncultural variances.\n\n\n(1) Is there a good reason to believe that there are only three sexual\norientations? Some men are attracted to people with female features\nfrom the waist up but male features from the waist down (a penis),\nthus not easily accommodated by the above three-way division of sexual\norientations. It is also unclear whether the many men who are\nattracted to both young boys and women\u2014this is true of many\ncultures around the world, past and present\u2014are bisexual. It is\nalso possible that there are age- and species-orientations, such as\npedophilia and zoophilia. Such potential orientations threaten to\nseriously expand the number of sexual orientations (consider that\ngenuine zoophiles\u2014people who have long-standing desires to have\nsex with nonhuman animals\u2014will have as many sexual orientations\nas there are different types of animals to which they are attracted\n(Wilkerson 2013)). Whether we can maintain that there are only three\n(or two) sexual orientations depends on the answers to these questions\nand our tolerance for exceptions to the three. It also depends on the\nreasons for classifying people by sexual orientation (see Andler 2020;\nDembroff 2016; Stock 2019).\n\n(2) It is unclear why the gender/sex of the person with the\norientation should be a component of the conception of sexual\norientation. Under the popular conception, if a formerly straight man\nis currently a woman (after transitioning), they would now be a\nlesbian (assuming that their sexual desires for women does not\nchange). But if we omit the person\u2019s own gender from the\nconception, the person\u2019s sexual orientation remains the same.\nPerhaps the answer to this issue depends on the political and moral\ngains reaped by conceiving of sexual orientation in one or the other\nway (Dembroff 2016; Stock 2019, 307\u2013313).\n\n(3) The lack of distinction between sex and gender makes it hard to\nclassify cases such as this: X is attracted to Y who\nis anatomically male (sex) but who self-presents as a woman (gender).\nAssume that X\u2019s own gender and sex are male. Then,\nwhether we claim that X is gay or is straight, we face\nobstacles: if X is gay, X would not be attracted to\nsomeone who appears as a woman. If X is straight, X\nwould not be attracted to someone who is anatomically male. The\npopular concept of orientation leaves such cases unclassified (Corvino\n2006a; Wilkerson 2013; but see Stock 2019, 303\u2013307 for a way to\naccommodate gender attractions on the sex-based account of sexual\norientations). The difficulty of such cases has led some philosophers\nto include both sex and gender as the bases of sexual orientation\n(Diamond 2022; Dembroff 2016). Perhaps the distinction between\norientations and preferences is relevant here, such that gender-based\nattractions might be considered preferences, whereas sex-based\nattractions are orientations (or vice versa).\n\n(4) Connected to the previous point is that the popular understanding\nof sexual orientation assumes a binary conception of sex/gender,\nalbeit one that can include trans people. A straight woman is a woman,\ncis or trans, who is attracted to men, cis or trans (a cisperson is\nsomeone whose gender identity\u2014e.g., being a man\u2014matches\ntheir biological sex\u2014being male). Thus, there is no room for\npeople who are gender fluid or whose gender or sex identification\nexists outside the binary (Dembroff 2016).\n\n(5) Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Human\nRights Campaign understand \u201csexual orientation\u201d as\nincluding emotional attraction. The former\u2019s definition\nstates,\n\n\nSexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional,\nromantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes.\n(American Psychological Association, Introduction to \u201cSexual\nOrientation and Homosexuality\u201d, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nThus, the APA believes that a man would be straight were he to be\nemotionally (even if neither romantically nor sexually) attracted to a\nwoman. Yet it is possible that he is nonetheless sexually attracted to\nmen, a result that leads to conceptual trouble. Perhaps keeping the\nconception of sexual orientation limited to sexual attraction\nso as to avoid such trouble is better (though adding romantic\nattractions is plausible, given that they usually include a sexual\ndimension) (Dembroff 2016).\n\n(6) The popular conception of sexual orientation is not so crude as to\nrely solely on behavior, but it is silent about on what we should\nrely. Desires and fantasies are obvious candidates. But occurrent\ndesires are not a good guide to sexual orientation: a shepherd can\nsexually desire sex with a sheep, but he need not be a zoophile, even\nwere his desire for the sheep to recur. David\u2014a straight\nguy\u2014might desire oral sex from another man (Tom) or other men.\nRecourse to \u201cenduring desires,\u201d as in the APA\u2019s\ndefinition, might not do the trick if the conditions under which David\ndesires oral sex from other men recur. Other information, such as\ncounter-factual information as to what the person would do under\nsuch-and-such conditions (e.g., Stein\u2019s \u201cideal\nconditions\u201d; 1999, ch. 2), is needed\u2014if David prefers a\nwoman\u2019s mouth under ideal conditions, then he is straight. But\nstating these conditions is tough. What if David prefers the way that\nTom performs oral sex? David might, under some conditions, still opt\nfor Tom (Corvino 2006a; cf. D\u00edaz-Le\u00f3n, 2022).\n\nPerhaps fantasies are a better guide if there is a good way to\ndistinguish between fantasies that indicate the person\u2019s sexual\norientation and those that don\u2019t (after all, David\u2019s\ndesire for Tom is a fantasy of sorts; Storms 1980). This might push us\nto ideal conditions again, to distinguish between someone\u2019s real\nand \u201cfake\u201d fantasies. Or we might rely on initial sexual\nimpulses: what sexually catches the eye of someone, without much\nthought: David does desire Tom\u2019s oral skills, but what captures\nDavid\u2019s sexual eye are women, not men.\n\n(7) Philosophers and historians of sex are roughly divided into social\nconstructionists and essentialists. Weak social constructionism claims\nthat the concepts of \u201chomosexuality,\u201d\n\u201cheterosexuality,\u201d \u201cnatural sexuality,\u201d and\nsimilar concepts are limited to a specific time period and\ngeographical region. This version is weak because it is only concerned\nwith how sexuality is conceptualized: there might have been\nhomosexuals in ancient Greece, but the ancient Greeks did not think\nabout them using the concept \u201chomosexual.\u201d Strong social\nconstructionism\u2014more in line with Michel Foucault\u2019s views\n(1976)\u2014claims that the very existence of homosexual and\nheterosexual orientations is geographically and temporally limited;\nour concepts of \u201chomosexual\u201d and\n\u201cheterosexual\u201d do not refer to anything when used to refer\nto other times and regions. Essentialists claim that homosexuals,\nheterosexuals, and bisexuals have existed in various times and\ncultures (see Card 1995, ch. 3; Corvino 1997, pt. III; Corvino 2006b;\nDe Cecco 1981; Mohr 1992, ch. 7; Stein 1992, 1999, ch. 4; Wilkerson\n2013).\n\nEssentialism has difficulty accounting for the historical and cultural\nevidence: Were all the ancient Athenians who had sex with boys and\nwomen bisexuals? Possibly, but then why, in such social\nconfigurations, do we find a preponderance of bisexual men? If they\nwere not all bisexuals, what were they? Neither\n\u201chomosexual\u201d nor \u201cheterosexual\u201d seems\nadequate. Perhaps then such men had an altogether different sexual\norientation. Perhaps one option is to argue that most Athenian men\nwere bisexuals, and their preponderance can be explained by the lack\nof social strictures that most people be straight, and their\npreferences for male youths, as opposed to male adults, can be\nexplained by another set of social strictures, namely, that men should\nbe sexually attracted to femininity. This explanation renders\nessentialism intact while allowing for a robust role for social\nfactors to shape sexual desires. Related to this, essentialism has to\nbe universally true for it to be true at all, for if it excludes some\ncultures and times, it concedes the truth of social constructionism.\nBut if true of every single culture, it would be a very strong thesis,\nand the need for evidence becomes more urgent. Perhaps, then, some\nversion of social constructionism is true. Our sexual desires are\nbiologically rigid enough to target mostly members of our species, but\nnot so rigid as to reflect only our three basic sexual orientations,\nthough social constructionism would have to properly accommodate\nevolutionary biology\u2019s \u201cdesigning\u201d us for\nprocreation (Halperin 1990, ch.1).\n\nPhilosophers have only recently shown increased interest in asexuality\nand asexuals, even though non-philosophers had already started to\naddress it (Bogaert 2012, 2015). Asexuals are not sexually attracted\nto others (they are thus not to be confused with incels, who are\nsexually attracted to others). According to Anthony Bogaert, this does\nnot mean that they do not experience sexual desires, do not engage in\nsexual activity, or do not experience romance (see also Brunning and\nMcKeever 2021; Eaton and Szustak 2022). Asexuals experience sexual\ndesire and arousal because sexual desire is physiological and its\n(successful) satisfaction can yield physical pleasure (Bogaert 2012,\n21, 74). They also sometimes masturbate for the sheer pleasure of it\nor to release tension, including while fantasizing, though the\nfantasies are disconnected from the asexual person who is fantasizing:\nthey \u201cview themselves as not being part of the sexual acts they\nare fantasizing about or viewing\u201d (Bogaert 2012, 63).\n\nLuke Brunning and Natasha McKeever accept the basics of\nBogaert\u2019s view; they understand attraction as an\n\u201cinvoluntary way of being inclined toward things around\nus\u201d (2021, 499). So to be sexually attracted to others is to\nexperience them as \u201c\u2018inviting\u2019 certain forms of\nsexual engagement\u201d (2021, 499). Asexuals, then, do not\nexperience other people as sexually \u201cinviting.\u201d\nUnderstanding asexuality as lack of sexual attraction, not as lack of\nsexual desire or capacity to experience sexual pleasure, coheres with\nthe above understanding of sexual desire as seeking pleasure, except\nthat in the case of asexuals, feeling sexual desire is not triggered\nby sexual attraction (to anyone). It raises, however, the issue of the\naptness of using the label \u201casexual\u201d to refer to people\nwho can experience sexual desire and pleasure. Bogaert argues that\nunderstanding asexuality in terms of (lack of) attraction helps us see\nit as a sexual orientation and it better explains the type of people\nunder consideration\u2014that is, as a type of person, asexuals\nexperience lack of sexual attraction, not lack of sexual desire (2012,\n22).\n\nWhether asexuality is a sexual orientation is a complex issue. Stock\nclaims that asexuality is not an orientation but an absence of one\n(2019, 300). Others argue that if orientations are patterns of\nattraction, asexuality is an orientation in that asexuals also evince\na pattern. Moreover, their lack of sexual attraction is stable and\nidentity conferring, which seems to assimilate it to an orientation\n(Brunning and McKeever 2021, 4). But the claim that asexuality is an\norientation relies mostly on political and moral reasons, in that\nthinking of it as an orientation might secure asexuals social and\nlegal protections (Brunning and McKeever 2021, 4; Eaton and Szustak\n2022, 134).\n",
