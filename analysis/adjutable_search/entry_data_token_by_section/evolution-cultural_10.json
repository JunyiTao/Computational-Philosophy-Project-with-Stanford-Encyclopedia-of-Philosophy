Yet one may reasonably ask why it should be the case that we\nhave the ability to learn from others at all, given the adaptive costs\nof such a disposition.\n\nBoyd and Richerson (1985) claim that the overall adaptive benefits of\nlearning from non-parents outweigh the costs (Richerson & Boyd\n2005: Ch. 4). They give several reasons for this view. Suppose an\ninventive (or lucky) individual discovers some behavior, or technique,\nwhich augments fitness. If other individuals in the population can\ncopy that behavior, then their fitness will probably be augmented,\ntoo. It will often be difficult for individuals to ascertain which\nbehaviors in fact augment fitness, hence which behaviors should be\ncopied. The problem, then, is how to tune a learning mechanism so that\nbeneficial behaviors are copied, while non-beneficial behaviors are\nnot.\n\nBoyd and Richerson suggest that prestige bias can overcome\nthis problem: if individuals copy techniques from those who are in\nprestigious positions, then this increases the chances that they will\ncopy techniques that are, in fact, beneficial. As they put it,\n\u201cDetermining who is a success is much easier than\ndetermining how to be a success\u201d (Richerson & Boyd\n2005: 124). Moreover, evidence has been accumulating for the reality\nof prestige bias. Henrich and Broesch (2011) have argued, based on\nfieldwork in Fiji, that an individual\u2019s perceived success in a\nsingle domain of activity (for example, yam cultivation) predicts\nwhether that individual will be asked for advice in other domains (for\nexample, fishing). In other words, they claim that individuals are\naccorded a broad form of prestige, which affects their likelihood of\nserving as a cultural model. The value of prestige bias relies on the\nsupposition that those individuals who are able to get themselves into\nprestigious positions have a better than average tendency to make use\nof fitness-enhancing techniques.\n\nRicherson and Boyd (2005: 120\u201322) suggest other learning\nheuristics may be adaptive too. One we mentioned above is\nconformist bias. To say that someone has conformist bias is\nto say that the person in question tends to imitate those behaviors,\nbeliefs or other dispositions that are present among a high frequency\nof individuals in the population. More precisely, this bias is usually\ndefined as a heightened, or exaggerated, tendency to imitate the most\ncommon behavior. They argue (along with many others in the field) that\nconformist learning provides an individual learner with behaviors that\nare appropriate to novel situations. More specifically, they argue\nthat it is more adaptive in this regard than not imitating others at\nall, and more adaptive than imitating randomly-chosen members of a\npopulation. Conformist learning, they say, can help with the\nacquisition of behaviors appropriate to a new biological environment:\nwhen moving into a new habitat, with unknown plants and animals, it is\nbest to eat the foods the locals eat, for one thereby avoids\npoisoning. But it can also lead to the generation of socially\nappropriate behaviors, which will obviate ostracism or attack.\nSupporting this idea, Harris and Corriveau\u2019s (2011) empirical\nwork concludes that while young children are unselective with regard\nto what they learn, they are far more selective regarding whom they\nlearn from. Moreover, they argue that children tend to seek out\ncultural conformists as individuals whom they should trust. These\nfindings offer some support for the existence of a form of conformist\nbias, although Lewens (2015) has suggested that both the theoretical\nand empirical cases for conformist bias may not be as strong as first\nmeets the eye, and Chellappoo (2021) has offered a similarly skeptical\nevaluation of the case made for prestige bias.\n\nReturning to the question that initiated this section\u2014Why can we\nlearn from others at all, when what we learn often seems\ndetrimental?\u2014these examples illustrate the form of\nmethodological adaptationism shared between much cultural evolutionary\nthinking and the evolutionary psychological approach it is sometimes\ncontrasted with (Lewens 2015). Cultural evolutionists tend to argue\nthat while the overall adaptive benefits of social learning\ndispositions in past environments explain their origination through\nnatural selection, this means neither that each specific learned trait\nmust lead to a fitness benefit, nor that the overall payoffs of\nlearning must still be positive in the context of modern informational\nenvironments that differ radically compared with those that confronted\nour ancestors.\n",
