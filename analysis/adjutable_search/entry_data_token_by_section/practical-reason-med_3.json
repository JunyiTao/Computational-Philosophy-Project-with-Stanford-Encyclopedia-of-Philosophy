    "main_text": "The Place of Practical Reason in Moral Theory\n4. Comparison with Kant\n\nThe final question remains: can the medieval explanations of practical\nreason be aligned with Kant\u2019s description of practical reason?\nKant\u2019s well known definition of practical reason is:\n\nEverything in nature works according to laws. Only a rational being\nhas the ability to act in accordance with the concept of laws, that is\naccording to principles; in other words, only a rational being has a\nwill. Since reason demands the derivation of actions from laws, the\nwill is nothing other than practical reason. (Grundlegung zur\nMetaphysik der Sitten, II, 37)\n\n\nFor Kant the aim of moral philosophy is to discover ideas and\nprinciples that would constitute as pure a concept of will as possible\nand not to determine the actions and conditions of willing, which are\nmainly the concerns of psychology (Grundlegung, Intro., XII).\nThe good will is good not through its result or its capacity to attain\na predetermined end, but only by means of the willing itself.\n(Grundlegung, I, 3). The will\u2019s ability for\nself-determination according to universally binding laws conveys the\nobjectivity demanded by the proper concept of reason. Since a rational\nnature declares itself by the self-imposition of the end, morality is\nthe relationship of actions to the autonomy of the will; and this\nautonomy is the relation of the will to the most universal mandating\n(Gesetzgebung) possible. (Grundlegung, II, 83 &\n85\u201386). The will purified of any inclination and desire for an\nulterior end is the proper matter for practical reason.\n\nThe differences between Kantian and medieval theories of practical\nreason are obvious even from such a short description of their\nelements. The adherence of Albert and Thomas to the Greek view of\nhuman nature led them to their conviction of the will\u2019s natural\ninclination toward the good. Such a notion permits Thomas to advise us\nto seek naturally what is useful to us. (De veritate, q. 24,\na. 8). What is truly advantageous to human beings must always be\nconducive to attaining the human end, beatitude; utility in this sense\nwill always be a reliable guide to correct moral choice. Thomas claims\nthat every thing to which man has a natural inclination human reason\napprehends as good. For Kant human beings cannot be permitted to\npursue their inclinations which are to be viewed as subjective\ndesires. Such desires lead to moral error at least as often as they\nproduce right action. The objectivity of the pure concept of the human\nwill precludes the recognition of human inclination as a measure of\nhuman goodness.\n\nDespite their insistence upon volitional freedom, which in some\naspects anticipates Kant\u2019s thought, Scotus and Ockham argue that\nthe true measure of morality lies in the conformity of the human will\nwith the commands of God. Such precepts may change if God so desires\nand so Scotus and Ockham produce an ethics quite different in spirit\nfrom that of Kant\u2019s theory of universal imperatives. Ockham in\nhis rejection of the intellectual basis for morality argues that an\nact in total conformity with right reason may not be virtuous, since\nGod could possibly create such an act without human volitional\nconsent. The act would be completely rational and in conformity with\ndivine commands, but would lack any merit or virtue. For Ockham the\ngoodness of any action lies completely in the will\u2019s desire to\nobey divine commands (De connexione virtutum, III, 11). When\nKant describes practical reason as a necessary law for all rational\nbeings, whose actions are always to be judged according to maxims\ncompletely bound to the concept of the will of a rational being, one\nmay see parallels to the Franciscan doctrine of the autonomy of the\nwill. As Thomas and Albert describe the genesis of moral action as a\nprocess in which practical reason has the ability to accept,\nunderstand and obey the principles of a universal law consonant with\nhuman nature, they approach Kant\u2019s description of the dignity of\nthe will more closely than those who insist upon the necessity for\nadherence to the possibly arbitrary precepts of God. Practical reason\nas the desire for the good as good, as expressed in the first\nprinciple of natural law or obedience to divine commands, and the\nconformity of the will through free choice to the universally binding\nprinciples of practical reason indicate that in some important\nelements of their moral theories medieval philosophers approach the\nspirit of Kant as they move away from the legacy of Aristotle.\n",
