    "main_text": "Dance as Agency and Intentional Action || Choreography, Authorship, and Copyright\n2.1 Choreography, Authorship, and Copyright\n\nVan Camp (1980) holds that, for purposes of artistic judgment and\nappreciation at least, it is the case that sometimes the dance\nperformer \u201ccreates\u201d, and not just performs and interprets,\nthe dance. The dancer, for example, often supplies structural and\nstylistic elements of a dance during the course of rehearsing and\nperforming the piece that were not specified or provided by the\nchoreographer. If these contributions are significant then what the\ndancer provides might be better understood as \u201ccreation\u201d\nrather than \u201cinterpretation\u201d, she maintains.\n\nThis view is opposed by McFee (2011b, 2013c and 2018), who believes\nthat dance works of art are created by choreographers and are\nperformed by dancers to fulfill the choreographer\u2019s intentions.\nChris Challis (1999)\u2019s work supports this account. On\nMcFee\u2019s choreographer-as-dancework-author view the\ndancer\u2019s role is both instrumental and subsidiary to the\nchoreographer\u2019s vision and their expertise is in dancing, not in\ndance-art creation. It follows from this that dancers contribute the\nraw material for dance performances but are more like skilled\ntechnicians or artisans than author-artists. This view has been\ncriticized for neglecting the performers\u2019 role in making and\nperforming dances in art-relevant ways by Lauren Alpert in an American\nSociety for Aesthetics conference (2016), by Aili Bresnahan (2013 and\nat a dance philosophy conference at Texas State and in a\nwork on interpretation in dance performing), and by Pakes (2019). (For\nmore on creative decision-making and choreography in dance see\nCveji\u0107 2015a and 2017; Foster 2011; and Melrose 2017. For an\narticle on video choreography see Salzer and Baer 2015. Cf. S. Davies\n1991 for a discussion of whether creative additions to a\n\u201cthin\u201d work of art can \u201cthicken\u201d it.)\n\nMcFee bolsters this account with his idea that artistic authorship of\ndance works of art is and should be attributable only to those who\nbear \u201cresponsibility\u201d for these works (2018). This comes\nclose to and yet stops short of equating dance-making credit for\ndances with intellectual property rights, where it is by no means the\ncase (particularly in the U.S.) that those who create art are the ones\ntaking credit and who are granted legal copyright in them. (For more\non issues of authorship in dance and copyright see Kraut 2010, 2011\nand 2016 and Van Camp 1994. For a book on dance, disability and the\nlaw see Whatley et al. 2018.)\n",
