    "main_text": "Stuff and Things and the Limits of Linguistically-Guided Metaphysics || Mass/Count Interchangeability, Arbitrariness, and Non-Universality\n4.2 From Arbitrariness to Mass/Count Skepticism?\n\nIf the following summary propositions are all true:\n\nIt is arbitrary whether a term we decide to use is mass or count\n(e.g. leaves vs. foliage),\nEvery supposed mass noun can be used in a count sense, and every\nsupposed count noun can be used in a mass sense,\nThe mass/count distinction is not universal (or at least not\nobviously so),\n\n\nthen this calls into question the licitness of metaphysicians\u2019\nheavy reliance on the distinction in furthering their descriptive and\nprescriptive projects. This does not mean that these metaphysical\nviews are not worth arguing for, or entertaining, but that the\nparticular ways they have been argued for could reasonably be doubted\nby one we could call a \u2018Mass/Count Skeptic.\u2019 A Mass/Count\nSkeptic is one who thinks that the mass/count distinction is a red\nherring with regards to laying out either a descriptive or\nprescriptive metaphysics, since the undeterdetermination of\n(metaphysical) theory by (linguistic) data in this matter is acute.\nThis does not mean that one should not engage in metaphysical\narguments about stuff vs things, but perhaps the mass/count\ndistinction is not as firm a foundation as many have thought. After\ndemonstrating some of the preceding kinds of considerations, Pelletier\nsays\n\n\nthe facts surrounding how +MASS/+COUNT\nis manifested in languages other than the Indo-European ones might\nseem to show that the basis and rationale for making the\ndistinction\u2014and perhaps any philosophical consequences that\nmight seem to follow from the distinction\u2014are not really valid\nas claims about reality in general or about how people might\nconceptualize reality. (Pelletier 2012a p435).\n\n\nIn an earlier piece, Pelletier says \u201cit seems there is nothing\nin the referent of the terms that should make fruit mass and\nvegetable count, baklava mass and brownie\ncount, rice mass and bean count\u201d (2001 p497).\nWhen we are not thinking about linguistics or metaphysics, and have to\ngo about our business, we see that sometimes it is convenient to look\nat its inhabitants in a massy way (\u2018I\u2019ve got 1000 pounds\nof furniture to ship,\u2019 \u2018I had too much fruitcake\u2019),\nand sometimes in a count way (\u2018Large-Haired Real Estate\nAgent\u2019s Quarterly says that a dining table, six chairs, and\ncredenza are necessary for ideal dining room staging,\u2019 \u2018We\nneed two fruitcakes for the party\u2019). Whenever we have some stuff\nor particles whose smallest macroscopically visible bits are identical\nor interchangeable, and they can be gathered or stuck together or can\nact together in a macroscopic way (e.g. air/wind), we tend to think of\nit in massy way, and, as regards its small-scale structure, there just\nis no folk pre-scientific commonsense commitment to either atomism or\nnot (cf Ware 1975, pace Bunt 1985, Link 1998). The\nonly reason that rice is mass and beans count is\nprobably because the former are smaller and harder to distinguish, or\ncount separately. Change becomes coins when we want\nto count them, whereas humans become flesh when\ntheir individuality is regarded as unimportant, e.g. in the following\nreal-world example. One Dr. Albert Klingman, when beginning medical\nexperiments on prisoners, upon first seeing them (many who were\nshirtless), said that \u201cAll I saw before me were acres of skin.\nIt was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time\u201d\n(Munson & Lague, 2017, 133).\n\nIt\u2019s an open question how a metaphysician with a hardcore\ncommitment to following the dictates of language should adjust their\nmethodology, at least as regards the mass/count distinction, given the\nforegoing. Suppose one wants to become more inclusive, and follow not\nmerely the dictates of their own language (or even their larger\nlanguage group), and instead decides to constrain and shape their\nmetaphysical theories only by the most general aspects of shared human\ngrammar, syntax, or semantics. Supposing that there even are some\nuniversal semantic features (or a \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019, a\nnon-settled hypothesis), it seems that the mass/count distinction is\nnot among them (again\u2014not settled). Then it seems that the\nlinguistically-guided metaphysician must accept either that a\n\u2018metaphysically serious\u2019 distinction between stuff and\nthings cannot be maintained whatsoever, or, it can be. If it can be,\nit must be in some watered-down fashion. (E.g., maybe reality contains\nneither stuff nor things, but has beings which can be regarded either\nway\u2014cf. Pelletier 2001). It may be that the most universal\ncommonalities of all human language will not impose nearly as much\nstructure or guidance as linguistically-guided metaphysicians would\nwish, at least as regards mass vs. count.\n\nAlternatively, one can be a Mass/Count Skeptic, and, while not ceasing\nto do metaphysics, or theorize about the difference between\n\u2018stuff\u2019/\u2019matter\u2019 and\n\u2018things\u2019/\u2019individuals,\u2019 cease relying on the\nmass/count distinction to do the lion\u2019s share of work in\ndeciding whether there is such a corresponding ontological difference\nin the world. (cf. Pelletier 2011, \u00a73.2). That\u2019s not what\nit\u2019s there for.\n\nWhile the reservations expressed in this section may seem pessimistic,\nthey are not, as these observations are serving to move us forward.\nMuch exciting and useful work is being done and remains to be done on\nthe mass/count distinction, as mentioned below, and\nlinguistically-guided metaphysicians will have a role to play in this\ninter-disciplinary work. It may just be that metaphysicians will have\nto become more nuanced in their appreciation of mass vs. count, as\nthere will likely become ever more fine-grained distinctions and\nqualifications to\n consider.[24]\n\nFurthermore, the direction of the vast growing empirical data needs to\nbe reckoned with, which makes early oracular pronouncements from the\narmchair seem quaint. Linguistically-guided metaphysicians working at\nthe crossroads of philosophy of language, logic, and metaphysics, need\nnot merely follow the lead of linguists and semanticists, but can, and\nshould, play a role in this work, as they come at this topic with\ndifferent concerns and different skill-sets which matter. The\nconsiderations in this last section represent a tentative reappraisal\nof the value of continuing to practice a certain methodological stance\nin the light of recent developments. It could very well be that new\ndata, and new theories could show how the distinction between mass and\ncount actually is as important as many have thought, perhaps by\nresurrecting itself in a new guise, such as the distinction between\n+COUNT and -COUNT. Furthermore, we can never be sure what new\ndiscoveries will be made in fundamental physics which could suddenly\nmake us re-evaluate, revise, abandon, or double-down on the picture we\nhave of matter, ordinary objects, and their relations.\n\n\nMass expressions and their relations to count expressions, and how\nthey are interpreted and employed by metaphysicians, offer us an\ninteresting and voluminous case-study of recent metaphysics informed\nby lexical, semantic, and syntactic considerations. The careful\nstudent of this material can take away many cautionary tales, useful\ntools, and become aware of just how different the responses to the\nsame linguistic data can be. This is a very difficult and woolly area\nof inquiry where there is little consensus. But interesting recent\nempirical work on mass and count expressions is being done which is\nshedding some new light on these issues, and there has been an\nexplosion of recent work in linguistics which does seem to display\ngenuine progress, the most fecund research being more heavily\nempirical than before. (For earlier empirically-informed work on this,\nsee Casati 2005, and Frisson & Frazier 2005. For more recent\nrelevant work, see Husi\u0107 2020, Kiss et al 2021a, Kiss\net al 2017; Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Massam 2012;\nMoltmann 2020; and see the references mentioned in Pelletier 2012\np435).\n\nHopefully, philosophers can work together with linguists, computer\nscientists, cognitive scientists, and others to help achieve some kind\nof breakthrough that can comprehend the mass/count distinction, and in\nso doing situate it properly into a role it is well-suited for to help\nus understand more deeply the relations between mental representation,\nlinguistic representation, and represented real-world entities.\n\nThe category of Stuff is still under-developed, and seems to\nbe where the category Event was decades ago. Stuff\nand stuff-talk represent either (i) an important ontological category,\nwhich remains poorly understood, or, (ii) a distinct way of conceiving\nor talking about objects, where its interface with object-talk is,\nagain, poorly understood. In the absence of consensus on the referents\nand logico-linguistic mechanics of mass expressions, controversy about\nstuff is bound to continue.\n",
