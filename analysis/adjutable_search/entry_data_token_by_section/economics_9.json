Since many theoretical\nprojects or approaches in economics are systematically unified, they\npose questions about what guides research, and many economists have\napplied the work of Kuhn or Lakatos in the attempt to shed light on\nthe overall structure of economics (Baumberg 1977, Blaug 1976, de\nMarchi and Blaug 1991, Bronfenbrenner 1971, Coats 1969, Dillard 1978,\nHands 1985b, Hausman 1992, ch. 6, Hutchison 1978, Latsis 1976,\nJalladeau 1978, Kunin and Weaver 1971, Stanfield 1974, Weintraub 1985,\nWorland 1972). Whether these applications have been successful is\ncontroversial, but the comparison of the structure of economics to\nKuhn\u2019s and Lakatos\u2019 schema served to highlight distinctive\nfeatures of economics and may have contributed to some of the changes\nthat economics has undergone. For example, asking what the\n\u201cpositive heuristic\u201d of mainstream economics consists in\npermits one to see that mainstream theoretical models typically\nattempted to demonstrate that an economic equilibrium will obtain, and\nthus that mainstream models were unified in more than just their\ncommon assumptions. Since the success of research projects in\neconomics is controversial, understanding their global structure and\nstrategy helped to clarify their drawbacks as well as their\nadvantages.\n",
