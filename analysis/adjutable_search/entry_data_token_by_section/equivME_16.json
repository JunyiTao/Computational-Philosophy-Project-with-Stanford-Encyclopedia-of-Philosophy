Experimental Verification of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nCockcroft and Walton (1932) are routinely credited with the first\nexperimental verification of mass-energy equivalence. Cockcroft and\nWalton examined a variety of reactions where different atomic nulcei\nare bombarded by protons. They focussed their attention primarily on\nthe bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) by protons (see\n Section 1.4).\n\nIn their famous paper, Cockcroft and Walton noted that the sum of the\nrest-masses of the proton and the Lithium nucleus (i.e., the\nreactants) was \\(1.0072 + 7.0104 = 8.0176\\) amu. However, the sum of\nthe rest-masses of the two \\(\\alpha\\)-particles (i.e., the products)\nwas 8.0022 amu. Thus, it seems as if an amount of mass of 0.0154 amu\nhas \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the reactants. Cockcroft and Walton\nalso observed that the total energy (in the reference frame in which\nthe \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is at rest) for the reactants was 125 KeV.\nHowever, the total kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles was\nobserved to be 17.2 MeV. Thus, it seems as if an amount of energy of\napproximately 17 MeV has \u201cappeared\u201d in the reaction.\n\nImplicitly referring to the equivalence of mass and energy, without\nexplicitly mentioning either the result or Einstein by name, Cockcroft\nand Walton then simply assert that a mass 0.0154 amu \u201cis\nequivalent to an energy liberation of \\((14.3 \\pm 2.7) \\times 10^6\\)\nVolts\u201d (p.\u00a0236). They then implicitly suggest that this\ninferred value for the kinetic energy of the two resulting\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles is consistent with the observed value\nfor the kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles. Cockcroft and\nWalton conclude that \u201cthe observed energies of the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles are consistent with our hypothesis\u201d\n(pp.\u00a0236\u2013237). The hypothesis they set out to test,\nhowever, is not mass-energy equivalence, but rather than when a\n\\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is bombarded with protons, the result is two\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles.\n\nStuewer (1993) has suggested that Cockcroft and Walton use\nmass-energy equivalence to confirm their hypothesis about what happens\nwhen \\({^7}\\Li\\) is bombarded by protons. Hence, it does not seem we\nought to regard this experiment as a confirmation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\).\nHowever, if we take some of the other evidence that Cockcroft and\nWalton provide concerning the identification of the products in the\nbombardment reaction as sufficient to establish that the products are\nindeed \\(\\alpha\\)-particles, then we can interpret this experiment as\na confirmation of mass-energy equivalence, which is how this\nexperiment is often reported in the physics literature.\n\nMore recently, Rainville et al. (2005) have published the results\nof what they call \u201cA direct test of \\(E = mc^2\\).\u201d Their\nexperiments test mass-energy equivalence \u201cdirectly\u201d by\ncomparing the difference in the rest-masses in a neutron capture\nreaction with the energy of the emitted \\(\\gamma\\)-rays. Specifically,\nRainville et al. examine two reactions, one involving neutron capture\nby Sulphur \\((\\S)\\), the other involving neutron capture by Silicon\n\\((\\Si)\\):\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\nn + {^{32}}\\S  &\\rightarrow {^{33}}\\S + \\gamma \\\\\nn + {^{28}}\\Si &\\rightarrow {^{29}}\\Si + \\gamma\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn these reactions, when the nucleus of an atom (in this case either\n\\({^{32}}\\S\\) or \\({^{28}}\\Si)\\) captures the neutron, a new isotope is\ncreated in an excited state. In returning to its ground state, the\nisotope emits a \\(\\gamma\\)-ray. According to Einstein\u2019s\nequation, the difference in the rest-masses of the neutron plus\nnucleus, on the one hand, and the new isotope in its ground state on\nthe other hand, should be equal to the energy of the emitted photon.\nThus, Rainville et al. test \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta mc^2\\) by making very\naccurate measurements of the rest-mass difference and the frequency,\nand hence energy, of the emitted photon. Rainville et al. report that\ntheir measurements show that Einstein\u2019s equation obtains to an\naccuracy of at least 0.00004%.\n",
