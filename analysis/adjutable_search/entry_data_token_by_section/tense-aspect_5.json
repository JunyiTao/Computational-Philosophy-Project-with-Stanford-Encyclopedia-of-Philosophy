The basic idea is to treat the progressive as a\nmodal operator \\((\\Box)\\) but restrict its domain to inertia worlds.\nThe notion of an inertia world is characterized informally.\nAn inertia world is exactly like the real world up to the time of\nevaluation; after this it may differ from the real world but is\nassumed to be as similar to the real world as possible. Given this\nnotion, the following definition introduces truth conditions for\nsentences in the progressive. \n\nDefinition 3.  PROG\\((\\phi)\\) is true with\nrespect to interval \\(I\\) and world \\(w\\) if and only if \\(\\forall w'\n\\in IE(w)\\) there exists an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\) such that\n\\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to \\(I'\\) and \\(w'\\). In addition \\(I\\)\nshould not be the final subinterval of \\(I'\\). \\(IE(w)\\) is the set of\ninertia worlds for \\(w\\).\n\n\nDefinition 3 does not yet account for the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments. Two additional assumptions\nare required. The first concerns activities; the second,\naccomplishments. \n20.\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is an activity that is true with respect to interval\n\\(I\\), then \\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to any sufficiently large\nsubinterval of \\(I\\).\n    \n\nAccomplishments like Mary draw a circle are split up into two\nparts, an activity part Mary draw that satisfies principle\n(20) and a result part which is characterized by the existence of a\ncircle. Both parts are connected by a causality relation\n\nCAUSE. \n21.\n\nCAUSE[Mary draw, A circle comes into existence]\n    \n\nThus an accomplishment has a richer internal structure than an\nactivity. \n\nWith these additional requirements, the inference patterns for\nactivities and accomplishments follow. Let us first show that Mary\nwas pushing a cart implies Mary pushed a cart. Assume\nthat the first sentence is true in \\(w\\) with respect to speech time\n\\(S\\). Then Mary be pushing a cart is true in \\(w\\) with\nrespect to an interval \\(I\\) before \\(S\\).  According to Definition 3,\nMary push a cart is then true in every inertia world \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\). Because of\npostulate (20), Mary push a cart is true in every \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to interval \\(I \\ (I\\) is a subinterval of\n\\(I')\\). Now, the definition of inertia worlds implies that\n\nMary push a cart is true in \\(w\\) with respect to interval\n\\(I\\). This means that Mary pushed a cart is true in\n\\(w\\) with respect to speech time \\(S\\). \n\nA completely analogous argument shows that Mary was drawing a\ncircle implies Mary drew. But postulate (20) only holds\nfor the first part of accomplishments; the result part is only\nrequired to hold in every inertia world \\(w'\\) with respect\nto a larger interval \\(I'\\), normally one after speech time.\nSince the inertia worlds after \\(S\\) may differ from \\(w\\) and\nsince the subinterval property (20) is not required to hold for the\nresult parts of accomplishments, the stronger conclusion that Mary\ndrew a circle does not follow. \n\nMany researchers assume that inertia worlds introduce a notion of\nnormality for the semantic analysis of the progressive. The\nthunderbolt in example (22) from Landman (1992) seems to break the\nnormal development of the real world. Dowty\u2019s analysis seems to be\ntailored for cases like this one. \n22.\n\nMary was crossing the street, when a thunderbolt from heaven\nstruck her down.\n    \n\n\nHowever, objections have been raised to the normality interpretation\nof inertia. The first one is attributed to Frank Vlach in Ogihara\n(1990). Consider sentence (23) \n23.\n\nJohn was crossing the street, when he was hit by a truck.\n    \n\nand a situation in which the truck is only a few centimeters away from\nJohn. Moreover the truck\u2019s speed is such that it is impossible for it\nto stop before hitting John. In this situation, the normal course of\nevents is such that John will never reach the other side of the\nstreet. Therefore, given definition 3, sentence (23) should be false\nunder these circumstances. This is intuitively incorrect. A similar\nobjection was raised by Bonomi (1997).\n\nOn the other hand, the normality interpretation seems to be at least\nquestionable. Consider the following example from Naumann and\nPi\u00f1\u00f3n (1997). \n24.\n\nRebecca was running across the minefield.\n    \n\nThis does presumably not mean that when you are running across a\nminefield, you normally will eventually get to the other side.\n\nNote that these objections all make use of a particular informal\ninterpretation of the notion inertia. Judging the validity of\nthese objections to Dowty\u2019s theory in a precise way therefore requires\nan explicit theory of this notion with exact empirical predictions.\n\n\nDowty analyzes the progressive as an intensional construction. Does\nthe progressive satisfy the standard philosophical tests for\nintensional constructions, that is, the invalidity of substitution of\nco-designative proper names and the impossibility of pulling the\nexistential quantifier out of the context created by the intensional\nconstruction (see Bealer and M\u00f6nnich (1989) for a more detailed\ndiscussion)? Let us consider accomplishments, for example sentence\n(25). \n25.\n\n Jackson Pollock was painting Ruth Rendel.\n    \n\nGiven that Ruth Rendel and Barbara Vine are co-designative proper\nnames, sentence (25) implies that Jackson Pollock was painting\nBarbara Vine. Therefore the first test fails. Co-designative\nproper names are substitutable salva veritate in progressive\nconstructions. The second one, however, applies, since \n26.\n\n Carlos was building a house.\n    \n\ndoes not imply that there is a house that Carlos was building. These\ntests therefore don\u2019t provide a clear answer to the question whether\nthe progressive is an intensional construction. Even if the answer is\nyes, the progressive is certainly a different type of intensional\nconstruction than, for example, propositional attitudes like\nbelieve or doubt. \n\nAn extensional alternative was developed by Parsons (1989, 1990).\nParsons, like Davidson (1967), assumes that first-order quantification\nover events is possible. But unlike Davidson, Parsons assumes\nquantification over eventualities in the sense of Bach (1986), which\nincludes events proper but also states, processes and so on. Like\nDowty, Parsons supposes that eventualities are split up into a\ndevelopment phase and a culmination phase. In order to represent this\ndifference in first-order logic two new predicates are introduced,\nCul\\((e, t)\\) and Hold\\((e,\nt)\\). The intuitive meaning of the first is that eventuality\n\\(e\\) culminates at time \\(t\\). The second one says that\n\\(e\\) is either an eventuality in its development phase or that\n\\(e\\) is a state. Given these assumptions a sentence like Mary\ndrew a circle is translated into first-order formula (27),\n\\(S\\) is again short for speech time. \n27.\n\n\n\\(\\exists x(Circle(x)\\,\\wedge\\) \\(\\exists e\\exists I[I \\lt S \\wedge\nDrawing(e)\\ \\wedge\\) \\(Subject(e, Mary)\\ \\wedge\\) \\(Object(e, x)\\ \\wedge\\) \n\\(Cul(e, I)])\\)\n    \n\nThe semantic effect of the progressive consists in transforming events\ninto states. \n\nIf \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 is an event verb, then \u2018be\n\\(A\\)-ing\u2019 is to be treated semantically as a state verb;\notherwise, \u2018be \\(A\\)-ing\u2019 is to be treated the same as\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019. (Parsons 1989: 222) \n\nWith this assumption the logical representation of Mary was\ndrawing a circle is (28). \n28.\n\n \\(\\exists x(Circle(x)\\,\\wedge\\) \\(\\exists e\\exists I[I \\lt S \\wedge\nDrawing(e)\\ \\wedge\\) \\(Subject(e, Mary)\\ \\wedge\\) \\(Object(e, x)\\ \\wedge\\) \n\\(Hold(e, I)])\\)\n    \n\nObviously (27) does not follow from (28). But (28) does imply that\nthere is a circle Mary was drawing. Of course this circle may not be\ncomplete. This means that Parson\u2019s ontology is bound to include\nincomplete objects. For a discussion of incomplete objects see for\ninstance Baggio and van Lambalgen (2007).\n\nAccording to the quotation above, the progressive doesn\u2019t change\nanything in the case of activities. Therefore Mary pushed a\ncart and Mary was pushing a cart are predicted to be\nequivalent. \n\nParsons\u2019 theory rests on the difference between the predicates\n\nCul and Hold. This difference is left to intuition.\nNo axiomatisation of these predicates is given. This is one of the\nobjections made in Zucchi (1999). Zucchi also notes that under certain\ncircumstances it is possible to derive a specific version of the\nimperfective paradox in Parsons\u2019 theory. A careful discussion of\nDowty\u2019 and Parsons\u2019 approaches and a combination of the two systems is\ncontained in Landman (1992).\nAnother approach to the imperfective paradox and - more generally -\nnon-culminating accomplishments was proposed by Copley and Harley\n(2015). They abandon event semantics and propose instead a framework\nusing situations and forces as primitives. Forces lead to transitions\nbetween situations. Their theory is motivated by the observation that\nacross languages, non-culminating accomplishments are\ncrosslinguistically in fact a very common phenomenon. Interestingly,\nthese non-culminating readings are per default conveyed by less complex\nexpressions than complete events. Often, it is the perfective and not\nthe imperfective that is marked linguistically. Prima facie, this is a\nproblem for analyses such as Dowty's which assume that the imperfective\nparadox in accomplishments hinges on an additional operator such as\nPROG. This is where Copley and Harley's causal analysis comes into\nplay. Their force-theoretic account does not run into this problem\nbecause causally efficacious forces always take effects ceteris\nparibus, for instance, an effect may not occur do to the occurrence of a\ncounter force preventing the effect. They develop a compositional\nsemantic framework linking forces to the argument structure of the\nsentence. At the present stage of the theory, however, some of the\nbasic concepts also call for axiomatisation. For instance, it is\ncrucial to gain a proper understanding of what it means for a situation\nto be a ceteribus paribus successor situation for some initial\nsituation. For this purpose, their semantic framework must be connected\nto a theory of causality connecting linguistic meaning to cognition and\ncausal reasoning via a conceptual level integrating the two.\nWe will come back to the imperfective\nparadox in\n Section 7\n where we combine linguistic theory with event theories from artificial\n intelligence. This will give us a formalization of\n ceteris paribus from which a\n new solution to the imperfective paradox will follow.\n",
