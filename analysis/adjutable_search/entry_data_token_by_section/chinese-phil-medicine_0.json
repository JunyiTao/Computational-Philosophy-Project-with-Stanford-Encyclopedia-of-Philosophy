Introduction: Shared Intellectual Contexts\n\n\nBefore addressing connections between Chinese philosophy and Chinese\nmedicine it is necessary to make two clarifications on the meaning of\nthe term Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine could in principle\nrefer to: (1) the full range of medical systems used in contemporary\nChina, including Western biomedicine; (2) the traditional indigenous\nChinese medicine that is conventionally referred to as Traditional\nChinese Medicine (TCM); and (3) other indigenous medical systems,\ndistinct from but TCM, practiced by non-Chinese or minorities who live\nin areas that historically were part of China or are now part of the\nPeoples Republic of China, for example, Korean and Tibetan\nmedicine. For purposes of this essay I use the term Chinese\nmedicine only to refer to TCM, but including issues of the integration\nof TCM and Western medicine. Second, Chinese medicine, in the\nsense of TCM just discussed, includes a wider range of practices than\ndoes Western medicine. In particular it includes: (1)\n\u201cmedicine\u201d in its conventional sense of practices that cure\nor prevent disease, treat disease and injury and assist in childbirth,\netc.; (2) a range of practice to prevent disease in the broadest sense\nby maintaining health, including practices associated with the martial\narts such as Taijiquan (also known as T\u2019ai chi); and (3) a range of\npractices that extend health by seeking longevity. In particular,\na clear account of Chinese medicine cannot confine itself to the first\nof these only.\n\n\nWithin a Chinese historical context, medicine (yi \u91ab)\nwas one of several qualitative sciences. It included\n\u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang sheng \u990a\u751f), a\nbroad category that comprised a wide range of self-cultivation\ntechniques. In later periods, medicine also included materia\nmedica (bencao \u672c\u8349) and internal (nei\ndan \u5167\u4e39) and external (wai dan\n\u5916\u4e39) alchemy. The early Chinese qualitative and\nquantitative sciences were specific, with no unified notion of science\n(Sivin 1982 and 1990).\n\n\nSecondly, medical works, like other scientific works, were classified\nas technical specialties, distinct from generalist works, including\nthe \u201cMasters\u201d texts associated with Chinese philosophy\n(Raphals 2008\u20132009, forthcoming). Medicine and its related disciplines\nappear in the last section of the Bibliographic Treatise (chapter 30)\nof the Standard History of the Han Dynasty (Han shu). This\nTreatise consists of six sections. The first two (\u201cSix\nClassics\u201d and \u201cMasters\u201d) contain philosophical\nworks. The last two are technical: \u201cNumbers and\nTechniques\u201d (Shu shu \u6578\u8853), and\n\u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang ji \u65b9\u6280).\nThe latter includes works on medicine and longevity, including the\ncategories of medical classics (yi jing \u91ab\u7d93),\nclassical recipes (jing fang \u7d93\u65b9), sexual arts\n(fang zhong \u623f\u4e2d, also referred to as \u201carts\nof the bedchamber\u201d), and immortality practices (shen\nxian \u795e\u4ed9). These chapters reflect the concerns and\nexpertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated\nwith the \u201cRecipe Masters\u201d (fang shi\n\u65b9\u58eb) associated with the Han court. But their concerns\nalso appear in early philosophical texts to such an extent that any\nseparation of their philosophical from their religious and technical\ncontent is arbitrary and artificial (Harper 1998 and 1999; Kalinowski\n2004).\n\n\nNonetheless, Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine shared important\nintellectual contexts in their early development. The origins of\nscience in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas from both\nphilosophers and technical specialists, including physicians.\nAccording to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese sciences were\nestablished some time between the first century BCE and the first\ncentury CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru\n(\u201cConfucian\u201d) ideas and ideas from technical specialists,\nespecially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing)\n\u4e94\u884c, henceforward wuxing and technical expertise\ntraditions associated with \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d\n(Shu shu) and \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang\nji, mentioned above).\n\n\nKey to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but\ndeployed in very different ways. Early medical \u2013 and\ncosmological \u2013 thinking depicts a cosmos ultimately composed of\nqi \u6c23 (the energy that constitutes and organizes matter\nand causes growth and change) in processes of constant change, based on\nthe interactions of yin and yang \u9670\u967d and\nthe \u201cFive Agents\u201d or \u201cFive Powers\u201d\n(wuxing. \nSee Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013).\n\n\nPhilosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of\nthe Book of Changes or Yi jing, (2) theories of\ncorrelative correspondence between heaven, earth and humanity as a\nshared representation of cosmic order, and (3) the idea of a\n\u201cclassic\u201d or \u201ccanon\u201d as the founding text of a\ntextual lineage. The authors of the first medical classic, the\nYellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di\nneijing), also deployed these concepts, in particular in models of\nthe human body as a yin-yang and Five Agent microcosm of the\ncosmos.\n\n\nFinally, physicians and philosophers created textual lineages and\naccounts of textual authority. The most important medical works\nof this kind are the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal\nMedicine  and the Materia Medica of Shen\nNong (Shen Nong bencao), ascribed to the \u201cDivine\nHusbandmen\u201d Shen Nong, who, according to legend, tested hundred\nof herbs and plants to ascertain their curative properties. By\ncontrast, the evidence of recently excavated texts indicates that the\nHuang Di neijing derived from prior textual traditions that\nwere subsequently lost (Harper 1998) and that the extant version is a\ncomposite of several earlier texts (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003,\nUnschuld and Tessenow 2011, Yamada 1979).\n",
