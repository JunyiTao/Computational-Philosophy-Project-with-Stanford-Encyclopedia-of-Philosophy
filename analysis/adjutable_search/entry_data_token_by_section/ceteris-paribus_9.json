Prima Facie Reasons and Ceteris Paribus Conditions in Ethics and Epistemology\n\nThe use of \u201ccp\u201d is not restricted to philosophy of\nscience. It is used in other areas of theoretical and practical\nphilosophy as well.\n\nFor instance, prima facie reasons are reasons under the\nconstraint of exclusive cp-conditions. They play an important role in\nethics and epistemology.\n\nIn ethics, a prima facie norm is an obligation (e.g.,\n\u201cprima facie, you should not hurt anybody\u201d) which\nholds as long as exceptional circumstances (e.g., defending your own\nlife) are absent (cf. Ross 1930 and the SEP-entry on moral reasoning).\nDancy (2004, 17, 35f) uses the expression \u201cpro\ntanto\u201d instead of \u201cprima facie\u201d, which\nis standardly used in the current debate. Pietroski (1993) has\npromoted the ceteris paribus understanding of moral\nobligations as a solution to paradoxes of moral obligations.\nEspecially for the solution of moral dilemmas, the cp-reading of moral\nobligations has proven to be helpful, because although two conflicting\ncp-obligations may block each other, they do not produce a strict\nconsistency in the sense of deductive logic (see Horty 1994).\n\nIn epistemology, a prima facie reason for a belief is a\nreason which justifies this belief in the absence of defeaters, i.e.,\nof exceptional information to the contrary. Prima facie\nreasons have been suggested in epistemology as a means of providing\nweak and defeasible a priori justifications for\nepistemologically fundamental beliefs such as the belief in the\nexistence of an external reality, for which a strict and non-circular\na priori-justification seems to be impossible. Nevertheless,\nthe inference from visual appearances to reality counts as defeasibly\njustified as long as there do not exist serious defeaters, i.e.,\nreasons for serious doubt (cf. Williams 1996, 2001, and the SEP-entry\non a priori-justification and knowledge). An example is the\ndefeasible inference from visual appearances to beliefs concerning\nexternal reality. My awareness of my visual appearance of a tree in\nfront of me is a prima facie reason for my belief that there\nreally is a tree in front of me, provided that information about\nexceptional circumstances is absent, for example the information that\nI am under the influence of drugs which cause hallucinations (cf.\nPollock 1986, Moser 2002). One may object that a similar kind of\npossible exception to the inference from visual appearances to reality\nis constituted by the possibility of a Cartesian demon who infuses\nhumans with illusionary perceptions, which is one of the major\nskeptical counterarguments to the inference from appearances to\nreality. In response to this objection, several epistemologists have\nargued that these kinds of exceptions are not serious exceptions, and\ntherefore, the inference from appearances to reality is defeasibly\nvalid.\n\nFinally, applications of cp-clauses can also be found in the form of\npresumptions in philosophy of language. Here it is assumed that\nunderstanding linguistic expressions requires defeasible assumptions\nor \u201cpresumptions\u201d, for example presumptions concerning the\nrationality of the speaker (cf. Quine 1960; Davidson 1973, Scholz\n2016, 148\u2013159).\n",
