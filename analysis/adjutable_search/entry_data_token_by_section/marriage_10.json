Marriage and Oppression: Gender, Race, and Class\n\nMarriage historically played a central role in women\u2019s\noppression, meaning economic and political disempowerment and\nlimitation of opportunities. Until the late 19th century,\nthe doctrine of coverture (in English and U.S. law) suspended a\nwife\u2019s legal personality on marriage, \u2018covering\u2019 it\nwith that of her husband, removing her rights to own property, make a\nwill, earn her own money, make contracts, or leave her husband, and\ngiving her little recourse against physical abuse. Well into the\n20th century, legislatures continued to impose gendered\nlegal roles within marriage (known as \u2018head and master\nlaws\u2019), to exempt rape within marriage from criminal\nprosecution, and to allow\u2014or impose\u2014professional bars on\nmarried women (Coontz 2006, 238; Cronan 1973; Kleingeld 1998). John\nStuart Mill compared wives\u2019 condition under coverture to slavery\n(see section 1); while the late 20th century U.S. saw\ngender-neutrality in legal marital responsibilities and an end to the\nmarital rape exemption, criticisms of marriage as oppressive persist.\nContemporary feminist attention to marriage is focused on spousal\nabuse\u2014indeed, some U.S. states still exempt spouses from sexual\nbattery charges (Posner and Silbaugh 1996)\u2014, the gendered\ndivision of labor in marriage, and the effects of marriage on\nwomen\u2019s economic opportunities and power.\n\nWhile Mill and Engels saw the establishment of monogamous marriage as\nan ancient defeat of the female sex, Aquinas, Kant, and many others\nhave seen monogamy as a victory for women, securing for them faithful\npartners, protection, and material support. So Kant writes that\n\u201cskepticism on this topic [marriage] is bound to have bad\nconsequences for the whole feminine sex, because this sex would be\ndegraded to a mere means for satisfying the desire of the other sex,\nwhich, however, can easily result in boredom and\nunfaithfulness.\u2014Woman becomes free by marriage; man loses his\nfreedom by it\u201d (Kant 1798, 210\u2013211, [309]). However, as a\nhistorical thesis about the origin of marriage, the idea that monogamy\nprovided women with needed material support has been debunked. In\nearly hunting-gathering societies, female foraging likely provided\nmore than male hunting, child-care was arranged communally, and,\nrather than a single male providing for his female partner, survival\nrequired a much larger group (Coontz 2006, 37\u201338). As a thesis\nabout the protection of women by their male partners, the incidence of\nrape and violence by male partners themselves must be taken into\naccount (e.g., in the contemporary U.S., Tjaden and Thoennes 2000).\nAnd as a thesis about sex difference, evolutionary\n\u2018just-so\u2019 stories purporting to show that women are\nnaturally more monogamous have been challenged by feminist\nphilosophers of biology (Tuana 2004).\n\nMarriage law has also been a tool of racial oppression. The majority\nof American states at one time prohibited inter-racial marriage; the\nSupreme Court struck down such laws in 1967 (Wallenstein 2002,\n253\u2013254). Anti-miscegenation law did not prevent actual sex and\nprocreation between races, but it excluded women of color and their\nchildren from the benefits of marriage. It was also a potent symbol of\nalleged racial difference. Furthermore, African-American marriage\npatterns were shaped by slavery. Enslaved persons could not legally\nmarry, and slave couples and their children were frequently separated\n(Cott 2000). Contemporary philosophers of race argue that marriage is\nstill implicated in systemic racism (Collins 1998). For example,\nhistorical conditions and structural racism have led to practices of\nshared child-rearing in some African-American communities. Some\ntheories of marriage imply that such child-rearing practices are\ninferior to the marital family. Theorists of racial oppression argue\nthat such practices should be recognized as a valuable alternative,\nand, moreover, that law which excludes such practices from benefits\naccorded to marriage may be racially unjust (Vanderheiden 1999; cf.\nCollins 1998, Card 1996). Immigration law has also made women who are\ndependent on marriage for their immigration status vulnerable to\nabuse, particularly those women who are also subject to racism or\ncultural marginalization (Narayan 1995).\n\nRecent work has also highlighted the contemporary class-based marriage\ngap in the U.S.: wealthier people are more likely to marry (McClain\n2013). This suggests a different link between marriage and oppression:\none effect of socioeconomic inequality may be to deprive the worse-off\nof access to marriage (perhaps because poverty impedes the formation\nof stable relationships) and the further legal benefits marriage can\nbring. There is arguably a tension, among egalitarian approaches,\nbetween feminist criticisms of marriage as inherently oppressive and\negalitarian criticisms of barriers to accessing it (Chambers\n2013).\n",
