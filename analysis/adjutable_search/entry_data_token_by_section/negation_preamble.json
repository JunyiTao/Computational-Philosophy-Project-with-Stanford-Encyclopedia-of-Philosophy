    "main_text": "\n\nNegation is in the first place a phenomenon of semantic opposition. As\nsuch, negation relates an expression \\(e\\) to another expression with\na meaning that is in some way opposed to the meaning of \\(e\\). This\nrelation may be realized syntactically and pragmatically in various\nways. Moreover, there are different kinds of semantic opposition.\n Section 1\n is concerned mainly with negation and opposition in natural language,\nboth from a historical and a systematic perspective.\n Section 2\n focuses on negation as a unary connective from the point of view of\nphilosophical logic. The history of negation is comprehensively\nstudied and surveyed in Horn 1989 and Speranza and Horn 2012.\n",
