    "main_text": "Applications || Self-knowledge\n6.5 Self-knowledge\n\nNext is a topic that Kant calls \u201cthe first command of all duties\nto oneself\u201d \u2013 namely, self-knowledge. Kant is concerned\nhere not with knowing one\u2019s personality type, personal history,\nor potential talents. His concern is moral purity:\n\nThis command is know (scrutinize, fathom) yourself,\nnot in terms of your natural perfection (your fitness or unfitness for\nall sorts of discretionary or even commanded ends) but rather in terms\nof your moral perfection in relation to your duty. That is, know your\nheart \u2013 whether it is good or evil, whether the source of your\nactions is pure or impure, and what can be imputed to you as belonging\noriginally to the substance of a human being or as derived\n(acquired or developed) and belonging to your moral condition\n(MM 6:441; see also LE 27:42, 348)\n\n\nOwen Ware detects a puzzle here. How could Kant see self-knowledge as\nobligatory given his \u201copacity thesis,\u201d according to which\nour own moral perfection is unknowable to us? \u201cI cannot know,\nfor example, whether my particular actions arise from conformity with\nthe moral law or from some hidden self-interest\u201d (Ware 2009,\n673) (For a more sanguine take on the conditions for self-knowledge,\nsee Bransen 2015 on self-love.)\n\nJordan MacKenzie (2018) explores the duty to know oneself outside of\nthe Kantian framework, decoupling self-knowledge from moral progress,\nand singling out two separate reasons for seeking self-knowledge.\nSince you owe yourself respect, you need to know yourself \u2013 you\ncan\u2019t respect a complete unknown. And since you are a valuable\nentity \u2013 respectability aside \u2013 that by itself makes you\nworth getting to know. These points are notably not tailored to the\ncase of self-knowledge; they just take basic facts about\nrespect and value and turn them inward. (Readers interested in the\nduty of self-knowledge may also be interested in the duty not to\nself-deceive; see, e.g., MacKenzie forthcoming.)\n6 Self-respect\n\nThe classic treatment of self-respect is Thomas Hill\u2019s\n\u201cServility and Self-Respect,\u201d first published in 1971.\nHill argues that there is a moral problem with servile people \u2013\nby which he means those who are overly deferential, self-loathing, or\nself-abnegating. He gives three case studies: the Uncle Tom, a Black\nman who \u201cdisplays the symbols of deference to whites, and of\ncontempt to blacks;\u201d the Self-Deprecator, whose \u201csense of\nshame and self-contempt make him content to be the instrument of\nothers;\u201d and the Deferential Wife, who is \u201cutterly devoted\nto serving her husband\u201d because of her belief that \u201cthe\nproper role for a woman is to serve her family\u201d (1991c,\n4\u20135). The problem, Hill thinks, is not that these people are\nmaking anyone miserable. They might be \u201cWise enough to Love\ntheir Chains,\u201d to borrow Mary Astell\u2019s description of the\ndutiful wife (1996, 29), and those around them might enjoy the\nbenefits of their eager self-denial. For Hill, the problem is more\nintrinsic. The servile agent does not appreciate their own rights,\neither because they misunderstand them \u2013 like the wife who is\nbrainwashed into thinking that she isn\u2019t really allowed\nto say \u201cno\u201d \u2013 or else they just don\u2019t value\ntheir own rights as much as others\u2019 whims.\n\nHill\u2019s paper has sparked, or at least foreshadowed, several\ninteresting discussions. One concerns whether Hill got the cases right\n\u2013 particularly the Deferential Wife (see, e.g., Baron 1985;\nFriedman 1985; Superson 2010). Another debate centers on the duty to\nresist one\u2019s own oppression; Carol Hay (2011) argues that this\nis a duty to oneself, whereas Straumanis (1984) argues that a woman\nowes it to other women, not oneself, to enhance herself and resist her\nown oppression. Bernard Boxill (1976) asks what should happen\nafter one\u2019s rights are violated, when there is no hope\nof rectification. Should one protest, as W.E.B. Dubois (1966, 48)\nadvocates, as an expression of self-respect? Or would it be servile,\nas Booker T. Washington (1966, 514) argues, to make pleas for the\n\u201csympathy\u201d of others rather than waiting until one can fix\nthe problem by oneself? Boxill ultimately sides with Dubois,\ninsisting, like Hill, on the need to value one\u2019s own rights.\n6.7 Privacy\n\nFinally, Anita Allen (2013) argues that one\u2019s digital privacy is\nnot just a personal good but a duty to oneself. She gives examples\nwhat of this duty might entail: securing information about one\u2019s\nbank account and genome, not constantly broadcasting one\u2019s\nlocation and beliefs, not aiming \u201csexy pictures\u201d of\noneself \u201cat minors or the general public\u201d (2013, 850).\nAllen then draws implications for reform: we should not just judge\ncompanies and governments by how much they invade our\nprivacy, but also by how well they help us protect ourselves\nfrom invasive third parties (2013, 851).\n\nOn this basis, Allen advocates paternalistic privacy laws in certain\ncases, foreshadowing Schofield\u2019s case for liberal paternalism\n(2018, 2021, chaps. 5 & 6). If Allen and Schofield are right,\nobligations to oneself are not just relevant to how we treat\nourselves, but to how we should treat each other (see also Kanygina\n2020), and how we ought to live together in civil and political\nsociety.\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe question of what we owe to ourselves has, after decades in the\ndoldrums, surged back to life. So what\u2019s next? We now have a\nsense of where the action has been \u2013 the spectre of paradox, the\nsearch for unwaivable duties, the clash between self-concern and the\nneeds of others. What open questions might be the focus of the next\nbig insight, the next chapter in the story?\n\nOne question is whether duties to self are in any sense\n\u201cfoundational\u201d \u2013 either as much as or more so than\nduties to other people. The idea is associated with Kant\u2019s\nethics (see Reath 2002, sec. II). The basic idea is a moralized\nversion of RuPaul\u2019s \u201cIf you can\u2019t love yourself /\nHow in the hell you gonna love somebody else?\u201d The question,\nKantified, is that of how you could owe anything to other people if\nyou can\u2019t owe things to yourself. Margaret Gilbert\u2019s\n(2018) theory of rights also brings in rights against oneself at the\nground floor. For Gilbert, rights are the product of joint decisions,\nand they give each party to the decision a right against each that the\ndecision be carried through. That includes the right of each against\nhimself or herself. This view has the amazing consequence that,\nwhenever I violate your right against me, I also violate a right\nagainst myself \u2013 a consequence that Gilbert doesn\u2019t\nstress, but which she does accept. She even gives a partial defense at\none point, arguing that we can sensibly demand of ourselves that we\ncarry out our joint decisions with other people (2018,\n177\u201378).\n\nAnother issue is that of the \u201cSelf-Other Symmetry.\u201d If we\ndo have duties to ourselves, are they essentially similar to duties to\nothers, or fundamentally different? Most writers who take up the topic\nargue against Symmetry (Slote 1984; Stocker 1976), but some are\nsympathetic (Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 2021; Schaab 2021).\n\nA final question, shared by many writers, is whether\n\u201cobligation\u201d is the only concept that we need here. No\ndoubt, it\u2019s useful. But there is a vast and variegated range of\nthings that we do with other people that we also turn inwards in an\nintriguing way. Consider the virtues of patience, forgiveness,\ncompassion, kindness, and appreciation. It is not so obvious that the\nright theory of \u201cobligations\u201d is going to tell us how\nthese things work in general, much less in the solo case.\n\nThe deeper reason for wanting to understand self-obligation is to make\nsense of the seemingly special character of how we relate to\nourselves. To focus only on the bossiest aspects of self-relation\n\u2013 duties and demands, claims and commands \u2013 is to risk\nmissing out on the full moral richness of our inner lives.",
