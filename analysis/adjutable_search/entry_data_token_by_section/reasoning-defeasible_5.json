Moore (Moore 1985) pointed out that we sometimes infer\nthings about the world based on our not knowing certain\nthings. So, for instance, I might infer that I do not have a sister,\nsince, if I did, I would certainly know it, and I do not in fact know\nthat I have a sister. Such an inference is, of course, defeasible,\nsince if I subsequently learn that I have a sister after all, the\nbasis for the original inference is nullified.\n",
