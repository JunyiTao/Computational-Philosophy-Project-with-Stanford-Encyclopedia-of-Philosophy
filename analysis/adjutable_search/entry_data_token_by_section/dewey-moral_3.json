    "main_text": "Developmental and Social Psychology || Intelligent Conduct\n1.3 Intelligent Conduct\n\nThe need to reflect intelligently on one\u2019s conduct arises when\nthe usual operation of habit or impulse is blocked. Customary means\nmay be lacking; changed circumstances may make habits misfire,\nproducing disturbing consequences; the social interaction of groups of\npeople with different customs may produce practical conflicts that\nrequire mutual adjustment. Blocked habits lead people to deliberate on\nthe problem posed by their situation. Deliberation is a thought\nexperiment that aims to arrive at a practical judgment, action upon\nwhich is expected to resolve one\u2019s predicament. Deliberation is\nmore intelligent, the more articulate the definition of one\u2019s\nproblem in light of more observant uptake of its relevant features,\nthe more imaginative and feasible are proposed solutions, the more\ncomprehensive and accurate the estimate of the consequences of\nimplementing them, and the more responsive is the choice to its\nexpected consequences. As the individual gets more practice in\nintelligent conduct, the dispositions that make it up become habits\n(HWT 196\u2013220).\n",
