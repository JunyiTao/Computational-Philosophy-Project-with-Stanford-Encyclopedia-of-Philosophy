These terms\ncertainly do not contribute to the invisibility of women. Instead,\nthey call attention to the presence of women. Moreover, they call\nattention to women\u2019s presence in positions of\nauthority\u2014doctor and manager. Nonetheless, most feminists who\nthink about language find these terms objectionable.\n\nThe clearest reason for objecting to \u2018manageress\u2019 and\n\u2018lady doctor\u2019 is that the use of these terms seems\npremised on the idea that maleness is the norm, and that women filling\nthese jobs are somehow deviant versions of doctors and managers. This\nis also a key objection to the use of \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018man\u2019. Moulton (1981a) understands these terms on the\nmodel of brand names, like \u2018Hoover\u2019 or \u2018Scotch\ntape\u2019 that become generic terms for a product type. The message\nof such terms, she suggests, is that the brand in question is the\nbest, or at least the norm. According to Moulton, terms like\n\u2018he\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 work in the same manner: they\nare gender-specific terms for men whose use has been extended to cover\nboth men and women. This, Moulton argues, carries the message that\nmaleness is the norm. As a result, the use of these terms as if they\nwere gender neutral constitutes a sort of symbolic insult to women.\nLaurence Horn and Steven R. Kleinedler (2000) have disputed the\ndetails of this, noting that \u2018man\u2019 did not begin its life\nas gender-specific and then get extended to cover both women and men.\nRather, \u2018man\u2019 actually began its life as\n\u2018mann\u2019, a gender-neutral term, which only later acquired a\ngender-specific meaning. The temporal sequence, then, cannot support\nthe claim that a gender-specific term has been extended to cover both\ngenders. Nonetheless, Horn and Kleinedler agree that the use of terms\nlike \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 as if they were\ngender-neutral perpetuates the objectionable idea that men are the\nnorm for humanity.\n",
