    "main_text": "The Ecology/Ecosystem Services Framings || The rationale for the ecosystems framing\n4.2 The rationale for the ecosystems framing\n\nThe ecosystem services framing builds on the important idea that\necosystems provide many, often under-appreciated, benefits to people\n(clean water, useful resources, etc). It is natural to consider that\nthese benefits provide a case for conservation of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d. The ecosystems framing adopts the\nperspective that it is \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\u2014typically,\ninterpreted broadly as ecological \u201cdiversity\u201d\u2014that\nis the basis for these important functions and services. This framing\nreduces the focus on variety of species or other elements (in the\nsense of counting-up). Perhaps because of the natural\nwithin-ecosystems focus, this also has amounted to lesser emphasis on\nglobal scale option value from such variety. The ecosystems framing\nreflects this perspective in the range of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\ndefinitions considered. The idea that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is\nimportant for ecosystem services is given support by defining\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d in terms of those ecological factors that\nare important for ecosystem services.\n",
