    "main_text": "Linguistic Turn\n5. Linguistic Turn \n\nA definitive starting point for Reinhold\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage, the final phase of his philosophical development, is\ndifficult to determine. He is reported to have spoken of a \u201cnew\nstandpoint\u201d in 1805 (Ernst Reinhold 1825: 337; cf. Bondeli 1995:\n267), and in 1806 he published Versuch einer Critik der Logik aus\ndem Gesichtspunkt der Sprache [Attempt at a Critique of Logic\nfrom the Perspective of Language]. In this work, Reinhold asserts\nthe indispensable relationship between thought and language, which\nwould become a hallmark of his mature works in philosophy of language.\nHowever, at this point, the relationship between thought and language\nis assumed to be undeniable and is not further developed, with the\nbulk of the 1806 Critik focusing on establishing a hierarchy\nof logical concepts. Reinhold appears to break with Bardili in the\npreface to his 1808 Die Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Erkenntnis der\nWahrheit in einer Fibel f\u00fcr noch unbefriedigte Forscher nach\ndieser Erkenntnis [Foundations of the Cognition of Truth in a\nPrimer for Still Dissatisfied Inquirers of this Cognition],\nmaking this a convenient marker for the end of Reinhold\u2019s phase\nof rational realism and the beginning of his linguistic turn. Yet, the\npreface to his Grundlegung einer Synonymik f\u00fcr den\nallgemeinen Sprachgebrauch in den philosophischen Wissenschaften\n[Groundwork of a Synonymic for the Universal Use of Language\nin the Philosophical Sciences] (1812) suggests that this\nwork signals a new direction in his philosophical thought since\nhis endorsement of rational realism. Whatever difficulties there might\nbe in sharply categorizing distinct phases of Reinhold\u2019s late\nphilosophical development, so much is clear: linguistic concerns\ngarnered Reinhold\u2019s attention for some time and his project of\nbasing philosophy on a critique of language comes to fruition in the\nGrundlegung einer Synonymik and subsequent works, including\nDas menschliche Erkenntni\u00dfverm\u00f6gen aus dem\nGesichtspunkt des durch die Wortsprache vermittelten Zusammenhang\nzwischen der Sinnlichkeit und dem Denkverm\u00f6gen [The\nHuman Faculty of Cognition from the Perspective of the Connection,\nMediated by Spoken Word, Between Sensibility and the Faculty of\nThought] (1816) and Die Alte Frage: Was ist die Wahrheit?\n[The Old Question: What is Truth?] (1820).\n\nWhile Reinhold claims in the 1806 Critik that no one doubts\nthought is conditioned by language, he comes to appreciate that many\nphilosophers hold a contrary, instrumentalist view of the relationship\nbetween thought and language (e.g. Fichte, Jakob Friedrich Fries, and\nGottlob Ernst Schulze), according to which language merely expresses\nthought, where thought is independent of language. Reinhold rejects\nthis instrumentalist view of language. In his view, language and\nthought are mutually conditioning and essentially intertwined\n(Grundlegung einer Synonymik, p. 3). As a result of this\nconnection, ambiguities and inconsistencies in language carry over to\nthought. This, Reinhold maintains, explains philosophy\u2019s lack of\nsystematic consistency and the lack of unanimity among philosophers:\nphilosophical disputes are attributable to linguistic ambiguities.\nBroadly following Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Georg Hamann,\nReinhold proposes a critique of language as a meta-critique of\nreason.\n\nFor Reinhold, critique of language consists in rectifying the\nambiguities of language, an enterprise Reinhold calls\n\u201csynonymic.\u201d The \u201cprimary task\u201d of this\ncritique, and of \u201cphilosophy as science\u201d more generally,\nis to define the \u201cfundamental concepts of human cognition\u201d\n(Grundlegung einer Synonymik, p. 185). There is a general\nconsensus in the literature that synonymic promises more than it can\ndeliver (Cloeren 1972; Cloeren 1988; Gerten 2006; Imhof 2015; Valenza\n2003). One problem concerns the justification of the definitions\nReinhold proposes and their hierarchical ordering: at times, these\nseem little more than arbitrarily stipulated. Another problem concerns\nthe ontological underpinning of Reinhold\u2019s system. In\nparticular, he appeals to the rational realist notion of the unity of\nthought and being (on the prefiguration of Reinhold\u2019s linguistic\nphase in his early correspondence with Bardili, see Valenza 2004).\nThus, in addition to human, representational thought\u2014which is\ninextricably tied up with language\u2014Reinhold presupposes\nspeechless thinking (sprachloses Denken), identified with\nGod\u2019s thinking. This non-representational thinking, which\nReinhold variously calls \u201cthinking in the narrowest sense\u201d\n(Grundlegung einer Synonymik, p. 116) and\u2014harking back\nto rational realism\u2014\u201cthinking qua\nthinking,\u201d is to be understood as the\n\u201cimmutable, subordinating order of being in\nitself\u201d (Das menschliche Erkenntni\u00df, p. 57).\nEspecially in Das menschliche Erkenntni\u00df, Reinhold\nemphasizes the indispensable relationship between representational\nthought and language in order to distinguish the former from divine\nthinking qua thinking. However, it is unclear whether this\nontological foundation, which draws on rational realism, is properly\naccounted for within the framework of Reinhold\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage.\n\nDespite these perceived shortcomings, scholars agree that\nReinhold\u2019s final philosophical phase offers many insights.\nReinhold actively engages with various philosophers who thematize\nlanguage: in addition to referring to thinkers in his proximity (e.g.\nBernhardi, Bouterwek, Fichte, Fries, Hamann, Herder, Jacobi, and\nSchulze), he cites Leibniz as a forerunner of synonymic\n(Grundlegung einer Synonymik, p. 185f.) and draws on the\nBritish tradition in figures such as Bacon, Locke, and Hume. Reinhold\nanticipates Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s rejection of instrumentalist\nviews of language in support of the interdependence of thought and\nlanguage, as well as aspects of Frege (Bondeli 1995: 271) and\nWittgenstein (Bernecker 2018: 3374f.). There is still much to be\ninvestigated in the history of the philosophy of language in general\n(for studies of this history in German philosophy, see Cloeren 1988;\nForster 2010; and Forster 2011) and Reinhold\u2019s place in it in\nparticular.\n",
