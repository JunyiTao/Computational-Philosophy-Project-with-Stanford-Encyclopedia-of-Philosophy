    "main_text": "The Chemical Revolution\n3. The Chemical Revolution\n\nAs we discussed in Section 1, by the end of the 18th century the\nmodern conception of chemical substances began to take form in\nLavoisier\u2019s work. Contemporary looking lists of elements were being\ndrawn up and also the notion of mass was introduced into chemistry.\nDespite these advances, chemists continued to develop theories about\ntwo substances which we no longer accept: caloric and phlogiston.\nLavoisier famously rejected phlogiston, but he accepted caloric. It\nwould be another 60 years until the notion of caloric was finally\nabandoned with the development of thermodynamics.\n",
