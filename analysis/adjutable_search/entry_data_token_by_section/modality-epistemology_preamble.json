    "main_text": "\n\nActual facts are facts about how things are. For example,\nMary actually wore her white dress to the party.\nModal facts, by contrast, are facts about how things could,\nmust, or could not have been. For example, Mary could have\nworn her red dress; but she couldn\u2019t have worn a dress\nthat is red and green all over at the same time. Modal reasoning is\ncentral to human cognition, since it is pervasive both in philosophy\nand in every-day contexts. It involves investigating and evaluating\nclaims about what is possible, impossible, essential, necessary, and\ncontingent. Some things could have been different than they actually\nare, other things could not have been. And some things could have more\neasily been true than other things. Here are some examples of\ndifferent kinds of modal claims:\n\nAlthough Antonella, Michael, and Anand are philosophers, they\ncould have been musicians in a band called\nSupervenience.\nWhile Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election, she could have\nwon.\nIt is impossible for Franco to have parents other than Mario and\nEmilia, since Franco\u2019s parents are essential to him.\nNecessarily, if it is raining, then it is raining.\nIt is impossible for something to fall under both the concept of a\nbachelor and the concept of a married male at the same time.\nMark must be in the room, since I hear him in there.\nIt is not possible for material objects to move faster than the\nspeed of light.\nOne cannot travel from Rome to New York in less than 3 hours.\nLisa can fit both a beach umbrella and a beach chair into the\ntrunk of her car.\nItaly could more easily have been in the 2018 World Cup Final than\nthe U.S.\n\n\nSentences (1)\u2013(10) instantiate different kinds of modality.\n(1\u20133) are most naturally interpreted to be about\nmetaphysical modality; (4) about logical modality,\n(5) about conceptual modality, (6) about epistemic\nmodality, (7) about physical modality, (8) about\ntechnological modality, and (9\u201310) about\npractical modality.\n\nFurther examples of modal claims are found at crucial places in\nphilosophical arguments, either in the set of premises or as the\nconclusion.\n\n(St. Anselm) It is necessary that God exists.\n(Descartes) It is possible for the mind to exist without the\nbody.\n(Berkeley) It is impossible for anything to exist\nunperceived.\n\n\nThe epistemology of modality investigates how we can know statements\nlike (1)\u2013(10), as well as modal premises or conclusions in\nphilosophical arguments, such as we find in St. Anselm, Descartes, and\nBerkeley. Traditionally, the central focus of the discipline has been\non knowledge of metaphysical modality. More precisely, the\nepistemology of modality seeks to provide answers to the following\nquestion.\n\n\nGeneral question: How can we come to know, or be\njustified in believing, what is necessary, possible, contingent,\nessential, and accidental?\n\n\n\nRecently, Vaidya and Wallner (2021) have further refined the\nGeneral question by splitting it into two different\nquestions:\n\n\nAccess question: How can we epistemically access the\nmodal realm?\nNavigation question: How should we navigate from one kind\nof modality to another?\n\n\n\nThe Access question investigates how we initially gain\nepistemic access to modal propositions, such as those in\n(1)\u2013(10) or in philosophical arguments.\n\nThe Navigation question presupposes that we have some modal\nknowledge, and then investigates how we can move from one kind of\nmodality to another, such as, e.g., from conceptual to metaphysical\nmodality. In other words, it asks how we come to know that some\nproposition \\(p\\) is, say, metaphysically necessary, given that we\nalready know that \\(p\\) is, say, conceptually necessary. While the\nNavigation question focuses on how we can have a certain kind of modal\nknowledge given that we already have another kind of modal knowledge,\nthe Access question targets the issue of how we can have modal\nknowledge in the first place.\n\nThis entry surveys the current state of the field by paying particular\nattention to how theories of modal knowledge have addressed the Access\nquestion and the Navigation question. (For other surveys: Gendler\n& Hawthorne 2002; McLeod 2005; Evnine 2008; Strohminger and\nYli-Vakkuri 2017; Mallozzi 2021c.) For each theory we discuss, we\npropose a number of critical questions. These questions serve\na dual purpose. They recapitulate the central points for the theories\nand raise concerns about them.\n",
