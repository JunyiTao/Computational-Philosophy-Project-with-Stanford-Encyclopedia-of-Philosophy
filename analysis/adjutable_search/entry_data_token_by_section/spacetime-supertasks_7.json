    "main_text": "Supertasks in Relativistic Spacetime || Time in Relativistic Spacetime\n2.1 Time in Relativistic Spacetime\n\nA model of general relativity, a  spacetime,  is a pair \\((M,g)\\).\nIt represents a possible universe compatible with the theory. Here, \\(M\\)\nis a manifold of events. It gives the shape of the universe. (Lots of\ntwo-dimensional manifolds are familiar to us: the plane, the sphere,\nthe torus, etc.) Each point on \\(M\\) represents a localized event in space\nand time. A supernova explosion (properly idealized) is an event. A\nfirst kiss (properly idealized) is also an event. So is the moon\nlanding. But July 20, 1969 is not an event. And the moon is not an\nevent. \n\nManifolds are great for representing events. But the metric \\(g\\) dictates\nhow these events are related. Is it possible for a person to travel\nfrom this event to that one? If so, how much elapsed time does a\nperson record between them? The metric \\(g\\) tells us. At each event, \\(g\\)\nassigns a double cone structure. The cone structures can change from\nevent to event; we only require that they do so smoothly. Usually, one\nworks with models of general relativity in which one can label the two\nlobes of each double cone as \u201cpast\u201d and\n\u201cfuture\u201d in a way which involves no discontinuities. We\nwill do so in what follows. (See figure 2.1.1.) \n\n\nFig 2.1.1. Events in spacetime and the associated double cones.\n\n\nIntuitively, the double cone structure at an event demarcates the\nspeed of light. Trajectories through spacetime which thread the inside\nof the future lobes of these \u201clight cones\u201d are possible\nroutes in which travel stays below the speed of light. Such a\ntrajectory is a worldline and, in principle, can be traversed\nby a person. Now, some events cannot be connected by a worldline. But\nif two events  can  be connected by a worldline, there is an\ninfinite number of worldlines which connect them. \n\nEach worldline has a \u201clength\u201d as measured by the metric \\(g\\);\nthis length is the elapsed time along the worldline. Take two events\non a manifold \\(M\\) which can be connected by a worldline. The elapsed\ntime between the events might be large along one worldline and small\nalong another. Intuitively, if a worldline is such that it stays close\nto the boundaries of the cone structures (i.e. if the trajectory stays\n\u201cclose to the speed of light\u201d), then the elapsed time is\nrelatively small. (See Figure 2.1.2.) In fact, it turns out that if\ntwo events can be connected by a worldline, then for any number \\(t>0\\),\nthere is a worldline connecting the events with an elapsed time less\nthan \\(t\\)! \n\n\nFig 2.1.2. Elapsed time is worldline dependent.\n\n",
