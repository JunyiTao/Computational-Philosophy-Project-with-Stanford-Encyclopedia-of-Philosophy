In fact,\ntranslations of Greek works were more widely available in the Islamic\nworld. Partly because of their earlier contact with Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy, Islamic philosophers are more inclined to value the\nsensory character of music and to accept it as an object of aesthetic\nappreciation.\n\nThe philosopher al-Kindi (c. 800\u2013870) holds a broadly\nPythagorean view of music (see Shehadi 1995: chapter 1, and Adamson\n2007: 172\u2013180). According to him, a relationship of affinity\nholds between musical elements and parts of the cosmos. This affinity\nallows Kindi to trace correspondences between musical elements and the\nextra-musical world. Kindi\u2019s acceptance of Pythagorean views is\nalso exemplified by his claim that music exercises a power of the\nhuman body in virtue of the affinity between its constitution and that\nof various musical instruments.\n\nAl-Farabi (872\u2013950) is a notable representative of the\nAristotelian current in medieval Islamic philosophy of music (see\nShehadi 1995: chapter 3). Farabi rejects the harmony of the spheres.\nRather than speculating about music\u2019s origin in the structure of\nthe cosmos, he attempts to understand it as a human phenomenon,\nsuggesting that vocal music may have developed out of necessities such\nas the expression of pleasant and unpleasant states. Farabi also\ndistinguishes three types of melody, according to the effect it\nproduces in the listener. Some melodies are pleasing to the ear,\nothers evoke images, and yet others express psychological states. It\nis possible for a melody to do more than one of these things, and in\nfact Farabi holds that the best melodies tend to have all three such\neffects.\n\nIbn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna (980\u20131037) describes\nmusic as a mathematical science, but argues that a theory of music\nshould be primarily concerned with the explanation of music as heard.\nThis emphasis on the appropriate level of explanation is reminiscent\nof Aristoxenus (see\n \u00a71.4),\n who exercised a clear influence on Islamic philosophy of music. Ibn\nSina also revives the Aristotelian view that music may imitate human\ncharacter and psychological states (on Ibn Sina\u2019s philosophy of\nmusic, see Shehadi 1995: chapter 4).\n",
