While developing his phenomenological critique of the way\nthe modern conception of what \u201cthings\u201d are\nimplicitly structures and so distorts the aesthetic understanding of\nart, Heidegger observes that once this \u201csubject-object relation\nis coupled with the conceptual pair form-matter,\u201d and this\nconceptual matrix is combined with the\n\u201crational/irrational\u201d and \u201clogical/illogical\u201d\ndichotomies,\n\n\nthen representation has at its command a conceptual machinery which\nnothing can stand against [eine Begriffsmechanik, der nichts\nwiderstehen kann]. (PLT 27/GA5 12)\n\n\nHeidegger seems to mean us to take his words seriously:\nAesthetic representation now possesses \u201ca conceptual machinery\nwhich nothing can stand against.\u201d Taken seriously, however,\nthese words leave no room for Heidegger\u2019s hope of transcending\naesthetics. We reach a dead-end, that is, until we hear these\nwords differently, as suggesting instead that (the) nothing can indeed\nstand against the otherwise irresistible conceptual machinery of\naesthetics.\n\n\nThat might sound bizarre at first, but remember that, for Heidegger,\nthe nothing is not nothing at all but, rather, does something;\n\u201cthe nothing itself noths or nihilates [das Nichts selbst\nnichtet]\u201d [P 90/GA9 114], as he notoriously put it\nin\n 1929.[53]\nThis active \u201cnoth-ing\u201d of the nothing was the first name\nHeidegger came up with to describe the phenomenological manifestation\nof that which both elicits and eludes complete conceptualization, an\ninitially inchoate phenomenon we encounter when we go beyond our\nguiding conception of what-is. To experience this\n\u201cnoth-ing\u201d is to become attuned to something which is not a\nthing (hence \u201cnothing\u201d) but which conditions all our\nexperiences of things, something which fundamentally informs our worlds\nbut which we experience primarily as what escapes and so defies our\n\u201csubjectivistic\u201d impulse to extend our conceptual mastery\nover everything.  With the help of Heidegger\u2019s strange\nthought that only this \u201cnothing\u201d can stand against the\nconceptual machinery of aesthetics, we are now poised to understand his\nphenomenological interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting.\n\n\nTo turn a dead-end into a clearing one has to see it\ndifferently. Notice how Heidegger looks at Van Gogh\u2019s\nstill-life painting of a seemingly ordinary pair of well-worn\nshoes. The pivotal point in Heidegger\u2019s meditation takes\nplace when he attends to the fact that \u201c[t]here is nothing\nsurrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT\n33/GA5\n 18\u20139).[54]\nAlthough all the English translations obscure this (and no other\ninterpreters seem to notice it), it is clear that for Heidegger this\nnothing is not nothing at all. Heidegger literally\nsays:\n\n\nSurrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes there is nothing, in\nwhich and to which they can belong\u2026 [Um dieses Paar\nBauernschuhe herum ist nichts, wozu und wohin sie geh\u00f6ren\nk\u00f6nnten\u2026] (PLT 33/GA5 18\u20139)\n\n\nHeidegger thrice introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA\nPair of Shoes\u201d by employing the word \u201cnothing\u201d in\nprecisely this ambiguous way; as we will see, this is how he begins\nevery extended discussion of Van Gogh\u2019s painting. The\ncrucial phenomenological question, then, is: What would it mean\nto really see this \u201cnothing,\u201d to encounter it not as\nnothing at all but, quite differently, as that \u201cin which and to\nwhich\u201d the shoes can indeed\n belong?[55]\n\n\nIf, following Heidegger, one attends long enough to the\n\u201cnothing surrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes,\u201d\nmeditating (with sufficient patience and\n care)[56]\non \u201cthe undefined\nspace\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19) in Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting\u2014the strange space which surrounds these shoes like an underlying and yet also enveloping atmosphere\u2014one\ncan notice that inchoate\nforms begin to emerge from the background but never quite take a firm\nshape; in fact, these shapes tend to disappear when one tries to pin\nthem\n down.[57]\nThe background of the painting not only\ninconspicuously supports the foreground image of the shoes but, when we\nturn our attention to this ordinarily inconspicuous background, we can\nnotice that it continues to offer up other inchoate shapes which resist\nbeing firmly gestalted themselves. This intriguing phenomenon is\nmore obvious in some of Van Gogh\u2019s other paintings; that Van Gogh\nseems to have embedded his own hat-wearing visage into the sole light\nthat illuminates his famous\n \u201cCaf\u00e9 Terrace at Night\u201d\nis perhaps easiest to see. It is clear that\n\u201cVincent recognized that something important happened in the old\nshoes painting, for he went on to experiment several times with the\ntheme\u201d (Edwards 2004, p. 51), and if one studies another of Van\nGogh\u2019s paintings of\n \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(this one from the following year, 1887), it\nseems hard to miss the faces half-emerging from the background in the\nupper-right corner of the painting, or the Christ-like figure in the\nupper-left.[58]\n\n\n\nHeidegger later described this phenomenon as \u201cthe tension of\nemerging and not emerging,\u201d and it is central to his remarks on\nthe painting of C\u00e9zanne and\n Klee.[59]\nAs Young nicely shows,\nHeidegger especially admired Klee\u2019s later works, such as\n\u201cSaint from a Window\u201d (1940), in which the eponymous image\nin the foreground barely manages to emerge from the muted cacophony of\nother images half-suggesting themselves from the\n background.[60]\nHere the\ntension between emerging and withdrawing is almost as palpable as the\ncentral figure, which seems to be disappearing back into the subtly\ndynamic background from which other figures continue to suggest\nthemselves. In a note he made beneath a sketch of Klee\u2019s\n\u201cSaint from a Window,\u201d Heidegger asks: \u201cIf one\nerases the \u2018image\u2019-character [from a picture], what [is\nleft] to \u2018see\u2019?\u201d He answers in another note by\nquoting Klee himself: \u201cThe inner structure organizing the\npicture itself thus begins to come to the fore\u2014and come toward\ntruth, co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte [whatever\nthe\n cost].\u201d[61]\nFor Heidegger, to put it simply,\nKlee\u2019s late paintings preserve the phenomenological struggle of\nemerging and withdrawing, and so bring the usually inconspicuous\ntension between foreground and background itself to the fore, thereby\noffering us a glimpse of the underlying structure hidden within all\nart. This phenomenological \u201ctension of emerging and not\nemerging\u201d that Heidegger finds in Klee and C\u00e9zanne,\nhowever, he first discovered in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA\nPair of Shoes,\u201d specifically, in the way Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting manifests what \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\nfamously calls \u201cthe essential strife\u201d between \u201cearth\nand world\u201d (PLT 49/GA5 35).\n\n\nWe can encounter this phenomenological \u201cstrife\u201d for\nourselves if we can recognize the way in which what initially seems\nlike \u201cnothing\u201d in the background of Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting continues to tantalizingly offer itself to our understanding\nwhile also receding from our attempts to order what it offers us into\nany firm, settled meaning. Thus, when Heidegger defines the\nphenomenon of \u201cearth\u201d as \u201cthe essentially\nself-secluding\u201d (PLT 47/GA5 33), he quickly qualifies this\ndefinition by specifying that:\n\n\nThe self-seclusion of earth is not a uniform, inflexible staying\nunder cover; rather, it unfolds itself in an inexhaustible abundance of\nsimple modes and shapes [eine unersch\u00f6pfliche\nF\u00fclle einfacher Weisen und Gestalten]. (PLT 47/GA5\n34)\n\n\n\u201cEarth,\u201d in other words, is an inherently dynamic\ndimension of intelligibility that simultaneously offers itself to and\nresists being fully brought into the light of our \u201cworlds\u201d\nof meaning and permanently stabilized therein, despite our best\nefforts. These very efforts to bring the earth\u2019s\n\u201cinexhaustible abundance of simple modes and shapes\u201d\ncompletely into the light of our worlds generates what Heidegger calls\nthe \u201cessential strife\u201d between \u201cearth\u201d and\n\u201cworld\u201d:\n\n\nThe world grounds itself on the earth and the earth juts through the\nworld. \u2026The world, in resting upon the earth, strives to\nraise the earth completely [into the light]. As self-opening, the\nworld cannot endure anything closed. The earth, however, as\nsheltering and concealing, tends always to draw the world into itself\nand keep it there. (PLT 49/GA5 35)\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, then, for a great artwork to\nwork\u2014that is, for it to help focus and preserve a\nmeaningful \u201cworld\u201d for an\n audience[62]\u2014this\nartwork must\nmaintain an essential tension between the world of meanings it\npulls together and the more mysterious phenomenon of the\n\u201cearth.\u201d Earth, in his analysis, both\ninforms and sustains this meaningful world and also resists being\ninterpretively exhausted by it, thereby allowing a great artwork\nquietly to maintain the sanctity of the inexhaustible within the very\nworld of meanings it conveys.\n\n\nLike that notorious \u201cnothing\u201d which (Heidegger wrote in\n1929) \u201cmakes possible the manifestation of entities as such for\nhuman existence [or \u2018being-here,\u2019 Dasein]\u201d\n(P 91/GA9 115), the \u201cearth\u201d is thus Heidegger\u2019s name\nin 1935\u201336 for what he most frequently calls \u201cbeing as\nsuch,\u201d a dynamic phenomenological \u201cpresencing\u201d\n(Anwesen) which gives rise to our worlds of meaning without\never being exhausted by them, a dimension of intelligibility we\nexperience both as it informs and as it escapes our attempts to pin\nit\n down.[63]\nWhat this suggests, then, is that by 1935 Heidegger had become\ndissatisfied with his broadly misunderstood \u201cnothing noths\u201d\nterminology, and so seeks here to redescribe and more carefully elaborate\nthe mysterious phenomenon he had called the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d six\nyears earlier as the \u201cessentially self-secluding earth,\u201d\nthe self-seclusion of which becomes palpable in its resistance to our\nbest efforts to bring the phenomenon fully into the light of our\nworlds. We can even observe this refining redescription taking\nplace in Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh.\n",
