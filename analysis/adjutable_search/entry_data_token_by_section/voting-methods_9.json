    "main_text": "Voting Paradoxes || Failures of Monotonicity\n3.2 Failures of Monotonicity\n\nA voting method is monotonic provided that receiving more\nsupport from the voters is always better for a candidate. There are\ndifferent ways to make this idea precise (see Fishburn, 1982, Sanver\nand Zwicker, 2012, and Felsenthal and Tideman, 2013). For instance,\nmoving up in the rankings should not adversely affect a\ncandidate\u2019s chances to win an election. It is easy to see that\nPlurality Rule is monotonic in this sense: The more voters that rank a\ncandidate first, the better chance the candidate has to\nwin. Surprisingly, there are voting methods that do not satisfy this\nnatural property. The most well-known example is Plurality with\nRunoff. Consider the two scenarios below. Note that the only\ndifference between the them is the ranking of the fourth group of\nvoters. This group of two voters ranks \\(B\\) above \\(A\\) above \\(C\\)\nin scenario 1 and swaps \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) in scenario 2 (so, \\(A\\) is\nnow their top-ranked candidate; \\(B\\) is ranked second; and \\(C\\) is\nstill ranked third).\n\n\n# Voters\nScenario 1Ranking\nScenario 2Ranking\n6\n\\(A\\s B\\s C\\) \\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\n5\n\\(C\\s A\\s B\\) \\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\n4\n\\(B\\s C\\s A\\) \\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\n2\n\\(\\bB\\s \\bA\\s C\\) \\(\\bA\\s \\bB\\s C\\)\n\nScenario\n1: Candidate \\(A\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\nScenario 2: Candidate\n\\(C\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn scenario 1, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both have a plurality score\nof 6 while candidate \\(C\\) has a plurality score of 5.  So, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) move on to the runoff election.  Assuming the voters do not\nchange their rankings, the 5 voters that rank \\(C\\) transfer their\nsupport to candidate \\(A\\), giving her a total of 11 to win the runoff\nelection.  However, in scenario 2, even after moving up in the\nrankings of the fourth group (\\(A\\) is now ranked first by this\ngroup), candidate \\(A\\) does not win this election. In fact,\nby trying to give more support to the winner of the election in\nscenario 1, rather than solidifying \\(A\\)\u2019s win, the last\ngroup\u2019s least-preferred candidate ended up winning the election!\nThe problem arises because in scenario 2, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare swapped in the last group\u2019s ranking.  This means that\n\\(A\\)\u2019s plurality score increases by 2 and \\(B\\)\u2019s\nplurality score decreases by 2. As a consequence, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) move\non to the runoff election rather than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  Candidate\n\\(C\\) wins the runoff election with 9 voters that rank \\(C\\) above\n\\(A\\) compared to 8 voters that rank \\(A\\) above \\(C\\).\n\n\nThe above example is surprising since it shows that, when using\nPlurality with Runoff, it may not always be beneficial for a candidate\nto move up in some of the voter\u2019s rankings. The other voting methods\nthat violate monotonicity include Coombs Rule, Hare Rule, Dodgson\u2019s\nMethod and Nanson\u2019s Method.  See Felsenthal and Nurmi 2017 for further \ndiscussion of voting methods that are not monotonic. \n",
