    "main_text": "Connections to Haecceitism || Haecceitism & Quidditism\n7.1 Haecceitism & Quidditism\n\nQuidditism is the property-theoretic analogue of haecceitism.\n(Armstrong (1989: 59) seems to coin the term\n\u2018quidditism.\u2019) But, while distinctively haecceitistic\npossibilities involve individuals being \u201cswapped\u201d or\n\u201creplaced\u201d without any qualitative difference,\ndistinctively quidditistic possibilities involve properties swapping\nor replacing one another in the world\u2019s causal-nomic structure.\nIf, for example, there is a maximal possibility, otherwise\nindiscernible from actuality, where mass and charge\nswap their respective causal-nomic roles (e.g., where objects resist\nacceleration in virtue of their charge), this maximal possibility\nwould differ quidditistically from actuality. Similarly, if there is a\nmaximal possibility according to which all actual causal-nomic facts\nare the same except that some actually uninstantiated property,\nschmass, occupies the causal and nomic role of mass,\nthis maximal possibility would also differ quidditistically from\nactuality. (Typically, quidditism is taken as a thesis about\nfundamental or \u201csparse\u201d properties like mass and\ncharge rather than as a thesis about all properties\nwhatsoever.)\n\nLike haecceitism, quidditism\u2019s proper formulation is contentious\nand depends heavily upon background metaphysical assumptions. Some\nformulations of quidditism invoke either maximal possibilities or\npossible worlds, while modalist formulations of quidditism do without\neither resource. Additionally, there is a quidditistic analogue of\ncheap haecceitism, according to which a given possible world\nrepresents various maximal possibilities that differ only\nquidditistically. (On formulations of quidditism and property\ncounterpart theory, see Hawthorne (2002b) and Heller (2002,\n2005).)\n\nArguments for quidditism have notable parallels with arguments for\nhaecceitism. Some quidditists suggest that our pedestrian modal\njudgments support quidditism (see, e.g., Lewis (2009: 209), while\nother defenses of quidditism can appeal to the apparent conceivability\nof scenarios where properties swap their causal-nomic roles.\nAdditionally, Bird (2007: 74\u201376) considers but rejects a\nproperty-theoretic analogue of Chisholm\u2019s Paradox that, if\nsuccessful, establishes quidditism. A different line of argument,\nwhich has no direct analogue in the case of haecceitism, appeals to\ncombinatorial principles regarding the nature of modality. These\ncombinatorial principles hold that various permutations of fundamental\nproperties across, say, causal nomic roles, correspond to distinct\nmaximal possibilities, which, if genuine, would differ only\nquidditistically. (See Lewis (2009: 209) for the combinatorial\nargument and Locke (2010), Schaffer (2005: 10), and Wang\n(2016) for discussion.)\n\nArguments against quidditism also appeal to modal intuitions. Black\n(2000: 94) says, for example, that quidditistic differences are\n\u201cdistinctions which my intuitions tell me are distinctions\nwithout differences\u2026 My intuition is that to play the\nnomological role of some colour or flavour is to be that colour or\nflavour, at that the idea of two qualities swapping nomological roles\nis thus unintelligible.\u201d Other anti-quidditist arguments turn on\nits purported epistemological consequences. On this front, some\nanti-quidditists (as well as some quidditists) hold that quidditism\nentails that we are irremediably ignorant of the distribution of the\nworld\u2019s fundamental properties. (Lewis (2009) labels the\nresulting view, \u201cRamseyan Humility.\u201d On quidditism and\nhumility, see also Bird (2007: 79), Hawthorne (2002b), Locke (2009),\nSchaffer (2005), Shoemaker (1980), and Whittle (2006).) Additional\ncomplaints and concerns about quidditism are diverse in character.\nLocke (2012) discusses Ockhamist worries about the ontology of\nquidditism and, specifically, second-order quiddities. Whittle (2006)\nworries about the epiphenomenal intrinsic nature of properties, given\nquidditism\u2019s alleged modal consequences. Black (2000) offers a\ncardinality argument against quidditism, which holds its modal\ncommitments to demand the existence of proper class-many possible\nworlds. Hawthorne (2002b) considers whether quidditism might\nultimately require a kind of \u201chyperstructuralism\u201d,\naccording to which absolutely any property might swap roles with any\nother property including the relation of causal necessitation\nitself. The resulting bizarre possibilities\u2014e.g., where\nmass and causal necessitation swap roles\u2014would\ndeliver a reductio of quidditism should they prove\nunavoidable.\n\nAlthough haecceitism and quidditism are independent theses, since\nneither strictly entails the other, their evidential relationship is\nan interesting one. Given the parallels between the arguments for and\nagainst them, it is unclear whether haecceitists ought to be\nquidditists and vice versa or if the metaphysical\ndisanalogies between properties and individuals can justify endorsing\none but not the other. (On the analogies and disanalogies between\nhaecceitism and quidditism, see Schaffer (2005: 15\u201316).)\n",
