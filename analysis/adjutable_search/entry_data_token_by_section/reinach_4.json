For example, he maintains\nthat a priori knowledge is first and foremost knowledge of\nspecific states of affairs (e.g., the being equal of 2+2 and\n4) rather than of propositions or things. States of affairs may be\nmost accurately described as states of being. This is because\nit is the being (the copula) in a state of affairs that typically bears\nthe special (for example modal) properties attributed to that state of\naffairs. For example, in the being equal of 2+2 and 4 it is\nthe being equal that is necessary, just as in the being\nred of the house it is the being red that is contingent.\nSimilarly, when we assert \u201cthat house is not red\u201d we are\nasserting a state of affairs we have apprehended, namely, the not\nbeing red of the house. In this case, the negativity pertains to\nthe copula of the state of affairs, that is, the not being red\nof the house, rather than the being not-red of the house. There are no\nnegative properties, for Reinach. That is to say, negative properties\nhave no existence, and those philosophers who have posited their\nexistence have been misled by language, which frequently says things\nare, e.g., not red.\n\n\nReinach claims that numerous properties that are standardly viewed\nby philosophers as properties of objects are most properly conceived as\nproperties of states of affairs.\n\n\nMany of Reinach's fellow realist phenomenologist came to embrace the\nidea that either all states of affairs (Lipps 1928; Pf\u00e4nder 1921)\nor at least negative states of affairs (Ingarden 1964\u201365) exist\nonly as intentional objects. Reinach, however, embraced a realist\nposition towards both positive and negative states of affairs. The\nkind of being Reinach attributed to states of affairs was that of\n\u201cobtaining\u201d (Bestehen); they do not really\n\u201cexist\u201d as do things, but neither are they simply mental\nor intentional objects. Reinach believed that negative states of\naffairs obtain precisely as do positive states of affairs; otherwise,\nhe did not see how we could defend objective knowledge of the most\nbasic laws of ontology and logic (specifically, the principle of\ncontradiction and the law of the excluded middle). On the other hand\nhe did not believe that every positive or negative sentence\ncorresponds to some state of affairs which obtains; this applies only\nto those sentences which are true, and thus only to one member of any\ngiven positive and negative pair of putative states of affairs.\n",
