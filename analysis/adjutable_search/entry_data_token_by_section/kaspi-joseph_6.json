    "main_text": "Theology and anthropology\n6. Conclusion\n\nIf medieval philosophy from Philo to Spinoza may be understood as\nbeing at the service of biblical exegesis, Joseph ibn Kaspi may\ncertainly be viewed as one of its most successful representatives. As\nalready mentioned, he also anticipated some of Spinoza\u2019s\ncontroversial ideas in some contexts. In addition, both Kaspi and\nSpinoza held that only man is capable of loving God, whereas God does\nnot love man (Kaspi, Commentary on Isaiah, p. 151; Spinoza,\nEthics, On the Ability of the Intellect, Theorem\n17).\n\nDespite his brilliance and original thought, Kaspi has never been\nconsidered one of the most important medieval Jewish thinkers or\ncommentators. Only in the 19th century were some of his works\npublished for the first time, and others have yet to see the light of\nday. There are several possible explanations for this. Perhaps his\ncontroversial ideas weighed against his acceptance in the surrounding\nsociety. Another explanation is implied by comparing Kaspi and his\nmore famous contemporary, Gersonides, a biblical exegete and\nphilosopher. Gersonides, despite his non-conservative ideas, earned\nconsiderable fame among Jewish and non-Jewish thinkers. This was\nprimarily thanks to his systematic, profound, philosophical work\nMil\u1e25amot Adonay, which placed him squarely in the realm\nof philosophy, while his Bible commentaries were written mostly in the\nspirit of plain interpretation, although there is much philosophy, as\nwell. Kaspi, however, was something of a philosopher among\ncommentators and a commentator among philosophers; perhaps that was\nwhy he never attained prominence in either group. Kaspi\u2019s\nwritings on logic and Hebrew linguistics were indeed highly creative\nand innovative, but he appeared to have lacked good fortune as far as\npublication is concerned.\n",
