    "main_text": "Criticisms\n4. Criticisms\n\nAs many readers come to Austin\u2019s theory mostly through its\ncriticism by other writers (prominently, that of H.L.A. Hart; see also\nKelsen 1941: 54\u201366), the weaknesses of the theory are almost\nbetter known than the theory itself:\n\nFirst, in many societies, it is hard to identify a\n\u201csovereign\u201d in Austin\u2019s sense of the word (a\ndifficulty Austin himself experienced, when he was forced to describe\nthe British \u201csovereign\u201d awkwardly as the combination of\nthe King, the House of Lords, and all the electors of the House of\nCommons). Additionally, a focus on a \u201csovereign\u201d makes it\ndifficult to explain the continuity of legal systems: a new ruler will\nnot come in with the kind of \u201chabit of obedience\u201d that\nAustin sets as a criterion for a system\u2019s rule-maker.\n\nA few responses are available to those who would defend Austin. First,\nsome commentators have argued that Austin is here misunderstood, in\nthat he always meant \u201cby the sovereign the office or\ninstitution which embodies supreme authority; never the\nindividuals who happen to hold that office or embody that institution\nat any given time\u201d (Cotterrell 2003: p. 63, footnote omitted);\nthere are certainly parts of Austin\u2019s lectures that support this\nreading (e.g., Austin 1832: Lecture V, pp. 128\u201329; Lecture VI,\np. 218).\n\nSecondly, one could argue (see Harris 1977) that the sovereign is best\nunderstood as a constructive metaphor: that law should be viewed as if\nit reflected the view of a single will (a similar view, that law\nshould be interpreted as if it derived from a single will, can be\nfound in Ronald Dworkin\u2019s work (1986: pp. 176\u2013190)).\n\nThirdly, one could argue that Austin\u2019s reference to a sovereign\nwhom others are in the habit of obeying but who is not in the habit of\nobeying anyone else, captures what a \u201crealist\u201d or\n\u201ccynic\u201d would call a basic fact of political life. There\nis, the claim goes, entities or factions in society that are not\neffectively constrained, or could act in an unconstrained way if they\nso chose. For one type of example, one could point out that if there\nwas a sufficiently large and persistent majority among the United\nStates electorate, nothing could contain them: they could elect\nPresidents and legislators who would amend the Constitution and,\nthrough those same officials, appoint judges who would interpret the\n(revised or original) Constitution in a way amenable to their\ninterests. A different sort of example (and some would say that there\nare recent real-life examples of this type) would be a President who\nignored the constraints of statutory law, constitutional law, and\ninternational treaty commitments, while the public and other officials\nlacked the will or the means to hold that President to the legal norms\nthat purported to constrain his or her actions.\n\nAs regards Austin\u2019s \u201ccommand\u201d model, it seems to fit\nsome aspects of law poorly (e.g., rules which grant powers to\nofficials and to private citizens\u2014of the latter, the rules for\nmaking wills, trusts, and contracts are examples), while excluding\nother matters (e.g., international law) which we are not inclined to\nexclude from the category \u201claw.\u201d\n\nMore generally, it seems more distorting than enlightening to reduce\nall legal rules to one type. For example, rules that empower people to\nmake wills and contracts perhaps can be re-characterized as\npart of a long chain of reasoning for eventually imposing a sanction\n(Austin spoke in this context of the sanction of \u201cnullity\u201d\n(Austin 1879: 522, 523, 923)) on those who fail to comply with the\nrelevant provisions. However, such a re-characterization misses the\nbasic purpose of those sorts of laws\u2014they are arguably about\ngranting power and autonomy, not punishing wrongdoing.\n\nA different criticism of Austin\u2019s command theory is that a\ntheory which portrays law solely in terms of power fails to\ndistinguish rules of terror from forms of governance sufficiently just\nthat they are accepted as legitimate (or at least as reasons for\naction) by their own citizens.\n\nFinally, one might note that the constitutive rules that determine who\nthe legal officials are and what procedures must be followed in\ncreating new legal rules, \u201care not commands habitually obeyed,\nnor can they be expressed as habits of obedience to persons\u201d\n(Hart 1958: p. 603).\n\nAustin was aware of some of these lines of attack, and had responses\nready; it is another matter whether his responses were adequate. It\nshould also be noted that Austin\u2019s work shows a silence on\nquestions of methodology, though this may be forgivable, given the\nearly stage of jurisprudence. As discussed in an earlier section, in\nmany ways, Austin was blazing a new path. On matters of methodology,\nlater commentators on Austin\u2019s work have had difficulty\ndetermining whether he is best understood as making empirical claims\nabout the law or conceptual claims; elements of each sort of approach\ncan be found in his writings (Lobban 1991: pp. 224\u2013225;\nCotterrell 2003: pp. 81\u201383).\n\nWhen H.L.A. Hart revived legal positivism in the middle of the\n20th century (Hart 1958, 2012), he did it by criticizing\nand building on Austin\u2019s theory: for example, Hart\u2019s\ntheory did not try to reduce all legal rules to one kind of rule, but\nemphasized the varying types and functions of legal rules; and\nHart\u2019s theory, grounded partly on the distinction between\n\u201cobligation\u201d and \u201cbeing obliged,\u201d was built\naround the fact that some participants within legal systems\n\u201caccepted\u201d the legal rules as reasons for action, above\nand beyond the fear of sanctions. Hart\u2019s\n\u201chermeneutic\u201d approach, building on the \u201cinternal\npoint of view\u201d of participants who accepted the legal system,\ndiverged sharply from Austin\u2019s approach to law.\n",
