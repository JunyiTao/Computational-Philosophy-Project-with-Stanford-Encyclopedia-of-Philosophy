    "main_text": "The Case for the Church-Turing Thesis || The inductive and equivalence arguments\n4.1 The inductive and equivalence arguments\n\nAlthough there have from time to time been attempts to call the\nChurch-Turing thesis into question (for example by Kalm\u00e1r in\nhis 1959; Mendelson replied in his 1963), the summary of the situation\nthat Turing gave in 1948 is no less true today: \u201cit is now\nagreed amongst logicians that \u2018calculable by L.C.M.\u2019 is\nthe correct accurate rendering\u201d of the informal concept of\neffectiveness.\n\nIn 1936, both Church and Turing gave various grounds for accepting\ntheir respective theses. Church argued:\n\n\nThe fact \u2026 that two such widely different and (in the opinion\nof the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability\n[i.e., in terms of \u03bb-definability and recursion] turn out to be\nequivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below\nfor believing that they constitute as general a characterization of\nthis notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of\nit. (Church 1936a: 346, emphasis added)\n\n\nChurch\u2019s \u201creasons adduced below\u201d comprised two not\nwholly convincing arguments. Both suffered from the same weakness,\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.4.4.\n\nTuring, on the other hand, marshalled a formidable case for the\nthesis. Unlike Church, he offered inductive evidence for it, showing\nthat large classes of numbers \u201cwhich would naturally be regarded\nas computable\u201d are computable in his sense (1936: 74\u201375).\nTuring proved, for example, that the limit of a computably convergent\nsequence is computable; that all real algebraic numbers are\ncomputable; that the real zeroes of the Bessel functions are\ncomputable; and that (as previously noted) \u03c0 and e are computable\n(1936: 79\u201383). But most importantly of all, Turing gave profound\nlogico-philosophical arguments for the thesis. He referred to these\narguments simply as \u201cI\u201d, \u201cII\u201d and\n\u201cIII\u201d. They are described in\n Section 4.3\n and\n Section 4.4.\n\nBy about 1950, considerable evidence had amassed for the thesis. One\nof the fullest surveys of this evidence is to be found in chapters 12\nand 13 of Kleene\u2019s 1952. As well as discussing Turing\u2019s\nargument I, and Church\u2019s two arguments mentioned above, Kleene\nbolstered Church\u2019s just quoted equivalence argument,\npointing out that \u201cSeveral other characterizations \u2026 have\nturned out to be equivalent\u201d (1952: 320). As well as the\ncharacterizations mentioned by Church, Kleene included computability\nby Turing machine, Post\u2019s canonical and normal systems (Post\n1943, 1946), and G\u00f6del\u2019s notion of reckonability\n(G\u00f6del 1936). (Turing\u2019s student and lifelong friend Robin\nGandy picturesquely called Church\u2019s equivalence argument the\n\u201cargument by confluence\u201d [Gandy 1988: 78].)\n\nIn modern times, the equivalence argument can be presented even more\nforcefully: All attempts to give an exact characterization of the\nintuitive notion of an effectively calculable function have turned out\nto be equivalent, in the sense that each characterization\noffered has been proved to pick out the same class of functions,\nnamely those that are computable by Turing machine. The equivalence\nargument is often considered to be very strong evidence for the\nthesis, because of the diversity of the various formal\ncharacterizations involved. Apart from the many different\ncharacterizations already mentioned in\n Section 1\n and\n Section 3,\n there are also analyses in terms of register machines (Shepherdson\n& Sturgis 1963), Markov algorithms (Markov 1951), and other\nformalisms.\n\nThe equivalence argument may be summed up by saying that the concept\nof effective calculability\u2014or the concept of computability\nsimpliciter\u2014has turned out to be\nformalism-transcendent, or even \u201cformalism-free\u201d\n(Kennedy 2013: 362), in that all these different formal approaches\npick out exactly the same class of functions.\n\nIndeed, there is not even a need to distinguish, within any given\nformal approach, systems of different orders or types. G\u00f6del\nnoted in an abstract published in 1936 that the concept\n\u201ccomputable\u201d is absolute, in the sense that all\nthe computable functions are specifiable in one and the same system,\nthere being no need to introduce a hierarchy of systems of different\norders\u2014as is done, for example, in Tarskian analyses of the\nconcept \u201ctrue\u201d, and standardly in the case of the concept\n\u201cprovable\u201d (G\u00f6del 1936: 24). Ten years later,\ncommenting on Turing\u2019s work, G\u00f6del emphasized that\n\u201cthe great importance \u2026 [of] Turing\u2019s\ncomputability\u201d is\n\n\nlargely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first\ntime succeeded in giving an absolute definition of an interesting\nepistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism\nchosen. In all other cases treated previously, such as demonstrability\nor definability, one has been able to define them only relative to a\ngiven language\u2026. (G\u00f6del 1946: 150)\n\n\nIn his 1952 survey, Kleene also developed Turing\u2019s inductive\nargument (1952: 319\u2013320). To summarize:\n\nEvery effectively calculable function that has been investigated\nin this respect has turned out to be computable by Turing\nmachine.\nAll known methods or operations for obtaining new effectively\ncalculable functions from given effectively calculable functions are\nparalleled by methods for constructing new Turing machines from given\nTuring machines.\n\n\nInductive evidence for the thesis has continued to accumulate. For\nexample, Gurevich points out that\n\n\nAs far as the input-output relation is concerned, synchronous parallel\nalgorithms and interactive sequential algorithms can be simulated by\nTuring machines. This gives additional confirmation of the\nChurch-Turing thesis. (Gurevich 2012: 33)\n\n",
