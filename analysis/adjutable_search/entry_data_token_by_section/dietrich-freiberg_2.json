    "main_text": "Existence and Essence\n3. Existence and Essence\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s De ente et essentia which bears the same title as\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 opuscule is indeed a work that gives much evidence of\nhaving been prepared as a kind of rebuttal to certain doctrines of\nAquinas. Both works open with a reference from Aristotle to the effect\nthat care and caution must be taken early in the study of metaphysics\nwith regard to fundamental notions. In fact Dietrich divides his\ntreatise into two parts, devoting the first part to an analysis of the\nkey metaphysical terms esse, ens, entitas,\nquid, and quiditas. In opposition to Aquinas he\nproposes the thesis that there is no real distinction between\nexistence (esse) and essence (essentia). The\nexistence of a thing expresses its essence and vice versa. The two\nnotions differ only in the way they denote the thing of which they are\npredicated (in modis significandi)\u2014existence expressing\nbeing in the mode of an act, essence in the mode of a possession and\nthe term of an act.\n\n\nThe second part of the De ente et essentia proposes\narguments, mainly based on Aquinas that deny the identity of essence\nand existence. Dietrich refutes each one of these arguments. The\nprincipal argument from Aquinas that Dietrich refutes is based on the\npremise that it is possible to understand what something is without\nknowing that it exists. Thus it follows according to Aquinas that\nesse is not included in the understanding of a thing\u2019s\nessentia, and therefore must be distinct from it. Dietrich\nresponds to this argument by challenging its premise. An essence is\nsuch only because it refers to an existent. That this is so is seen\nfrom the very etymology of the word \u201cessence\u201d as accounted\nfor by St.  Augustine who argued that \u201cessentia\u201d\nis derived from \u201cesse\u201d. But the issue that lies\nbetween Dietrich and his confrere is not one of words but of\nprinciples. Armand Maurer, in his important article \u201cThe De\nQuidditatibus Entium of Dietrich of Freiberg and its Criticism of\nThomistic Metaphysics\u201d, sums the matter up well when he\nobserves:\n\n\nFor St. Thomas, essence is a principle in created being other than\nesse and receptive of it. As potential to, and receptive of esse,\nessence is thus a principle through which and in which a thing exists.\nNot so for Dietrich. Essence, in his view, is not subject to an influx\nof esse. It is the very beingness of the thing, and hence that through\nwhich it may be said to be outside of nothingness.\n\n\n\n\nDietrich correlates his thesis of the real identity of existence and\nessence with his concept of being, both in its concrete form as ens or\nparticular being and its abstract form as entitas.\nEns denotes the essence of whatever is a determinate existing\nindividual, while entitas denotes the same thing in\nabstraction. Ens is the most basic of all metaphysical\nconcepts for Dietrich. It is that which first distinguishes a thing\nfrom nothingness. Both ens and entitas identify with\nessence. So one could say according to Dietrich that in considering a\nwhite ball for example, its ens is white, its\nentitas is whiteness, and its essence is that through which\nit is white and participates in whiteness.\n",
