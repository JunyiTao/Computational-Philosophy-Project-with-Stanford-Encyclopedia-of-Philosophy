    "main_text": "Other Features of Aesthetic Judgments || Dependence and Lawlessness\n2.4 Dependence and Lawlessness\n\nThus far we have been making positive claims about features of\naesthetic judgments. Let us now consider the claim that there are no\ninteresting nonaesthetic-to-aesthetic laws or principles, and the\nclaim that an aesthetic/nonaesthetic dependence relation can obtain,\neven though there are no such interesting laws or principles. Here\n\u201cinteresting\u201d laws or principles means generalizations to\nthe effect that anything of such and such a nonaesthetic kind is of\nsuch and such aesthetic kind, and these generalizations can\nbe used to predict aesthetic properties on the basis of knowledge of\nnonaesthetic properties. In this sense, many find it plausible that\nthere are no laws of taste and aesthetic properties are anomalous.\n\nThe problem of the source of correctness in aesthetic judgment is\nindependent of the question of whether there are laws, rules or\nprinciples of taste. There is no reason to think that the possibility\nof correct or true judgments depends on the existence of laws, rules\nor principles from which we can deduce our correct or true\n judgments.[2]\n\nNevertheless, the anomalousness of aesthetics is worth thinking about\nin its own right. Many aestheticians agree that the aesthetic is\nanomalous in the above sense. But they are not agreed on the\nexplanation of anomalousness.\n\nA notable exception to this consensus is Monroe Beardsley, who\nclaims\u2014heroically and extraordinarily\u2014that there are\nexactly three aesthetic principles: things are aesthetically excellent\neither by being unified or intense or complex (Beardsley 1958: chapter\nXI). However, Beardsley\u2019s \u201ctrinitarian\u201d position\nfaces difficulties similar to those faced by moral philosophers who\nappeal to \u201cthick\u201d concepts. If Beardsley insists on a\nlawlike connection between his three thick substantive aesthetic\nproperties (unity, intensity and complexity) and aesthetic value, he\ncan only do so at the cost of conceding anomalousness between the\nthree thick substantive aesthetic properties and nonaesthetic\nproperties. There are three layers and one can hold onto laws between\nthe top and middle layers only by losing laws between the middle and\nbottom layers. Maybe intensity is always aesthetically good, but there\nare no laws about what makes things intense.\n\nGranting the anomalousness of aesthetic properties, then, we need to\nexplain it. There is much plausibility in Hume and Kant\u2019s\nsuggestion that what explains the anomalousness of the aesthetic is\nthe first feature of judgments of taste\u2014that judgments of taste\nare essentially subjective, unlike ordinary empirical judgments about\nphysical, sensory, or semantic properties (Hume 1757 [1985:\n231\u2013232]; Kant 1790, 5: 213\u2013216, 281\u2013286 [2000:\n99\u2013101, 136\u2013142, 162\u2013167]). This is why the two\nsorts of concepts are not \u201cnomologically made for each\nother\u201d (as Donald Davidson [1970] says about mental and physical\nconcepts). How can we bring an essentially subjective range of\njudgments nomologically into line with a range of empirical judgments?\nThe two kinds of judgments answer to quite different sets of\nconstraints. Frank Sibley observed that aesthetic concepts are not\npositively \u201ccondition-governed\u201d (Sibley 1959). And Mary\nMothersill claimed that there are no laws of taste. But neither did\nmuch to explain those facts. The appeal to subjectivity explains what\nSibley and Mothersill notice and describe. Indeed, Mothersill writes\nof her \u201cFirst Thesis\u201d (FT) that there are no genuine\nprinciples or laws of taste: \u201c\u2026FT is central to\naesthetics, and there is nothing more fundamental from which it could\nbe derived\u201d (Mothersill 1984: 143). But it seems that it\ncan be derived from the subjectivity of judgments of\ntaste.\n\nThis kind of anomalousness is one thing, dependence or supervenience\nanother. Even though aesthetic properties are anomalous, they depend\nand supervene on nonaesthetic properties. Many find such a combination\nof relations uncomfortable outside aesthetics, such as in moral\nphilosophy and the philosophy of mind. Yet there seem to be good\nreasons to embrace both principles in aesthetics. Both are firmly\nrooted in ordinary aesthetic thought.\n",
