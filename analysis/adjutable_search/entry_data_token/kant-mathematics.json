Kant\u2019s Pre-Critical Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nIn 1763, Kant entered an essay prize competition addressing the\nquestion of whether the first principles of metaphysics and morality\ncan be proved, and thereby achieve the same degree of certainty as\nmathematical truths. Though his essay was awarded second prize by the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in Berlin (losing to Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s \u201cOn Evidence in the Metaphysical\nSciences\u201d), it has nevertheless come to be known as Kant\u2019s\n\u201cPrize Essay\u201d. The Prize Essay was published by the\nAcademy in 1764 under the title \u201cInquiry Concerning the\nDistinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality\u201d\nand stands as a key text in Kant\u2019s pre-critical philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nIn the Prize Essay, Kant undertook to compare the methods of\nmathematics and metaphysics (Carson 1999; Sutherland 2010). He claimed\nthat \u201cthe business of mathematics\u2026is that of combining\nand comparing given concepts of magnitudes, which are clear and\ncertain, with a view to establishing what can be inferred from\nthem\u201d (2:278). He claimed further that this business is\naccomplished via an examination of figures or \u201cvisible\nsigns\u201d that provide concrete representations of universal\nconcepts that have been synthetically defined (Dunlop 2014, 2020). For\nexample, one defines the mathematical concept <trapezium> by\narbitrary combination of other concepts (\u201cfour straight lines\nbounding a plane surface so that the opposite sides are not parallel\nto each\n other\u201d[1]),\n accompanied by a \u201csensible sign\u201d that displays the\nrelations among the parts of all objects so defined. Definitions as\nwell as fundamental mathematical propositions (that space can only\nhave three dimensions, for example) must be \u201cexamined\nin concreto so that they come to be cognized\nintuitively\u201d, but such propositions can never be proved since\nthey are not inferred from other propositions (2:281). Theorems are\nestablished when simple cognitions are combined \u201cby means of\nsynthesis\u201d (2:282), as when, for instance, it is demonstrated\nthat the products of the segments formed by two chords intersecting\ninside a circle are equal. In the latter case, one proves a theorem\nabout any and all pairs of lines that intersect inside a circle not by\n\u201cdrawing all the possible lines which could intersect each other\nwithin [the circle]\u201d but rather by drawing only two lines, and\nidentifying the relationship that holds between them (2:278). The\n\u201cuniversal rule\u201d that results is inferred via a synthesis\namong the sensible signs that are displayed, and, as a result, among\nthe concepts that the sensible signs illustrate.\n\nKant concludes that the mathematical method cannot be applied to\nachieve philosophical (and, in particular, metaphysical) results, for\nthe primary reason that \u201cgeometers acquire their concepts by\nmeans of synthesis, whereas philosophers can only acquire\ntheir concepts by means of analysis\u2014and that completely\nchanges the method of thought\u201d (2:289). Yet at this pre-critical\nstage, he also concludes that, even lacking synthetic definitions of\nits primary concepts, \u201cmetaphysics is as much capable of the\ncertainty which is necessary to produce conviction as\nmathematics\u201d (2:296). (Later, in the critical period, Kant will\nexpand the notion of synthesis to describe not only the genesis and\ncombination of mathematical concepts, but also the act of unifying\nmanifold representations. He will also, of course, use the terms\n\u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201canalytic\u201d to distinguish two\nmutually exclusive ways in which the subject and predicate concepts\nrelate to one another in distinct judgments of any kind, and he will\nemphasize an expanded sense of this distinction that encompasses a\nmethodological contrast between two modes of argumentation, one\nsynthetic or progressive and the other analytic or regressive. These\nvarious senses of the analytic/synthetic distinction will be addressed\nbriefly, below.)\n\nIn the essays \u201cConcerning the Ultimate Ground of the\nDifferentiation of Directions in Space\u201d and \u201cOn the Form\nand Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World [Inaugural\nDissertation]\u201d of 1768 and 1770, respectively, Kant\u2019s\nthoughts about mathematics and its results begin to evolve in the\ndirection of his critical philosophy as he begins to recognize the\nrole that a distinct faculty of sensibility will play in an account of\nmathematical cognition (Carson 2004; Carson 2017; Posy 2020). In\nthese essays, he attributes the success of mathematical reasoning to\nits access to the \u201cprinciples of sensitive form\u201d and the\n\u201cprimary data of intuition\u201d, which results in \u201claws\nof intuitive cognition\u201d and \u201cintuitive judgments\u201d\nabout magnitude and extension. One such judgment serves to establish\nthe possibility of an object that is \u201cexactly equal and similar\nto another, but which cannot be enclosed in the same limits as that\nother, its incongruent counterpart\u201d (2:382) (Buroker\n1981; Van Cleve and Frederick 1991; Van Cleve 1999). Kant invokes\nsuch \u201cincongruent counterparts\u201d in \u201cDirections in\nspace\u201d to establish the orientability and actuality of a\nNewtonian-style absolute space, the object of geometry as he then\nunderstands it. He invokes the same example in the \u201cInaugural\nDissertation\u201d to establish that spatial relations \u201ccan\nonly be apprehended by a certain pure intuition\u201d and so show\nthat \u201cgeometry employs principles which are not only indubitable\nand discursive, but which also fall under the gaze of the mind.\u201d\nAs such, mathematical evidence is \u201cthe paradigm and the\nmeans of all evidence in the other sciences\u201d (2:403). (Later, in\nthe critical period\u2019s Prolegomena, he will invoke\nincongruent counterparts to establish the transcendental ideality of\nspace, thereby disavowing his earlier argument in support of absolute\nspace.)\n2. Kant\u2019s Critical Philosophy of Mathematics\n2.1 Kant\u2019s theory of the construction of mathematical concepts in \u201cThe Discipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use\u201d\n\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy of mathematics finds fullest\nexpression in the section of the Critique of Pure Reason\nentitled \u201cThe Discipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use\u201d,\nwhich begins the second of the two main divisions of the\nCritique, the \u201cTranscendental Doctrine of\nMethod.\u201d In previous sections of the Critique, Kant has\nsubjected pure reason \u201cin its transcendental use in accordance\nwith mere concepts\u201d to a critique in order to \u201cconstrain\nits propensity to expansion beyond the narrow boundaries of possible\nexperience\u201d (A711/B739). But Kant tells us that it is\nunnecessary to subject mathematics to such a critique because the use\nof pure reason in mathematics is kept to a \u201cvisible track\u201d\nvia intuition: \u201c[mathematical] concepts must immediately be\nexhibited in concreto in pure intuition, through which\nanything unfounded and arbitrary instantly becomes obvious\u201d\n(A711/B739). Nevertheless, the practice and discipline of mathematics\ndoes require an explanation, in order both to account for its success\nat demonstrating substantive and necessary truths, and also to license\nits invocation as a model of reasoning. Kant thus directs himself, as\nhe did in the pre-critical period, to the question of what accounts\nfor the \u201chappy and well grounded\u201d mathematical method, and\nalso of whether it is useful in any discipline other than mathematics.\nTo answer this latter question in the negative, Kant must explain the\nuniqueness of mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe central thesis of Kant\u2019s account of the uniqueness of\nmathematical reasoning is his claim that mathematical cognition\nderives from the \u201cconstruction\u201d of its concepts: \u201cto\nconstruct a concept means to exhibit a\npriori the intuition corresponding to it\u201d (A713/B741)\n(Friedman 1992, 2010; Shabel 2006). For example, while the concept\n<triangle> can be discursively defined as a rectilinear figure\ncontained by three straight lines (as is done in Euclid\u2019s\nElements), the concept is constructed, in\nKant\u2019s technical sense of the term, only when a\ncorresponding intuition is exhibited; in this case, the corresponding\nintuition is a singular and immediately evident representation of\na three-sided figure. Kant argues that when one so renders a triangle\nfor the purposes of performing the auxiliary constructive steps\nnecessary for geometric proof, one does so a priori, whether\nthe triangle is produced on paper or only in the imagination. This is\nbecause in neither case does the object displayed borrow its pattern\nfrom any experience (A713/B741). Moreover, one can derive universal\ntruths about all triangles from such a singular display of an\nindividual triangle since the particular determinations of the\ndisplayed object, e.g., the magnitude of its sides and angles, are\n\u201centirely indifferent\u201d to the rendered triangle as an\nexhibition of the general concept <triangle> (A714/B742).\nKant\u2019s account must thus be defended against the commonly held\nposition that universal truths cannot be derived from\nreasoning that depends on particular representations (Friedman 2012,\n2020). Relatedly, the less than perfectly straight sides of an\nempirically rendered triangle are similarly \u201cindifferent\u201d\nto the general concept <triangle> and so such an empirical\nintuition is considered adequate for geometric proof. This raises\nquestions about how one can be sure that an intuition adequately\ndisplays the content of a concept (Dunlop 2012); the relation between\npure and empirical intuition (Friedman 2012; Shabel 2003); and,\nin particular, which of the intuitively displayed features can safely\nbe ignored (Friedman 2010, 2012). These features of Kant\u2019s\ntheory of construction also invite discussion about the acquisition\nconditions of mathematical concepts (Callanan 2014); the role of\nconstruction in indirect reductio proofs (Goodwin\n2018); the relation between construction and definition (Heis\n2014, 2020; Nunez 2014); and the role of imagination in construction\n(Land 2014).\n\nUltimately, Kant claims that it is \u201conly the concept of\nmagnitudes\u201d (quantities) that can be constructed in pure\nintuition, since \u201cqualities cannot be exhibited in anything but\nempirical intuition\u201d (A714/B742) (Sutherland 2004a, 2004b,\n2005a, 2021). This leads to a principled distinction between\nmathematical and philosophical cognition: while philosophical\ncognition is confined to the results of an abstract conceptual\nanalysis, mathematical cognition is the result of a \u201cchain of\ninferences that is always guided by intuition\u201d, that is, by a\nconcrete representation of its objects (Hintikka 1967; Parsons 1969;\nFriedman 1992; Hogan 2020). Kant strains somewhat to explain how the\nmathematician constructs arithmetic and algebraic magnitudes, which\nare distinct from the spatial figures that are the object of geometric\nreasoning. Drawing a distinction between \u201costensive\u201d and\n\u201csymbolic\u201d construction, he identifies ostensive\nconstruction with the geometer\u2019s practice of showing or\ndisplaying spatial figures, whereas symbolic construction correlates\nto the act of concatenating arithmetic or algebraic symbols (as when,\nfor example, \u201cone magnitude is to be divided by another,\n[mathematics] places their symbols together in accordance with the\nform of notation for division\u2026\u201d) (A717/B745) (Brittan\n1992; Shabel 1998).\n\nKant claims further that the pure concept of magnitude is suitable for\nconstruction because, unlike other pure concepts, it does not\nrepresent a synthesis of possible intuitions, but\n\u201calready contains a pure intuition in itself.\u201d But since\nthe only candidates for such \u201cpure intuitions\u201d are space\nand time (\u201cthe mere form of appearances\u201d), it follows that\nonly spatial and temporal magnitudes can be exhibited in pure\nintuition, i.e., constructed. Such spatial and temporal magnitudes can\nbe exhibited qualitatively, by displaying the shapes of things, e.g.\nthe rectangularity of the panes of a window, or they can be exhibited\nmerely quantitatively, by displaying the number of parts of things,\ne.g., the number of panes that the window comprises. In either case,\nwhat is displayed counts as a pure and \u201cformal intuition\u201d,\ninspection of which yields judgments that \u201cgo beyond\u201d the\ncontent of the original concept with which the intuition was\nassociated. Such judgments are paradigmatically synthetic a\npriori judgments (to be discussed at greater length below) since\nthey are ampliative truths that are warranted independent of\nexperience (Shabel 2006).\n\nKant argues that mathematical reasoning cannot be employed outside the\ndomain of mathematics proper for such reasoning, as he understands it,\nis necessarily directed at objects that are\n\u201cdeterminately given in pure intuition a priori and\nwithout any empirical data\u201d (A724/B752). Since only\nformal mathematical objects (i.e. spatial and temporal magnitudes) can\nbe so given, mathematical reasoning is useless with respect to\nmaterially given content (though the truths that result from\nmathematical reasoning about formal mathematical objects are\nfruitfully applied to such material content, which is to say that\nmathematics is applicable to and a priori true of the\nappearances (Shabel 2005). Consequently, the \u201cthorough\ngrounding\u201d that mathematics finds in its definitions, axioms,\nand demonstrations cannot be \u201cachieved or imitated\u201d by\nphilosophy or physical sciences (A727/B755).\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s theory of mathematical concept construction can be\nthought of as providing an explanation of mathematical practice as\nKant understood\n it[2],\n the theory is intertwined with Kant\u2019s broader commitments to\nstrict distinctions between intuitions and concepts, as modes of\nrepresentation (Smyth 2014); between synthetic and analytic judgments\n(Anderson 2004, 2015; Hogan 2020); between the roles of different\ncognitive faculties (Land 2014; Laywine 2014); and between a\npriori and a posteriori evidence and reasoning (Anderson\n2015). Ultimately, the picture of mathematics developed in the\n\u201cDiscipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use\u201d depends on the\nfull theory of judgment that the Critical philosophy aims to\nprovide, and crucially on the theory of sensibility that Kant offers\nin The Transcendental Aesthetic (Parsons 1992; Carson 1997; Risjord\n1991), as well as in corresponding passages in the\nProlegomena\u2019s Main Transcendental Question, First Part,\nwhere he investigates the \u201corigin\u201d of the pure sensible\nconcepts of mathematics, and the \u201cscope of their validity\u201d\n (A725/B753).[3]\n2.2 Kant\u2019s answer to his question \u201cHow is Pure Mathematics Possible?\u201d\n\nKant asks two related leading questions of his critical philosophy:\n(1) How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?; and, (2)\nHow is metaphysics possible as a science (B19; B23)? Mathematics\nprovides a special avenue for helping to answer these questions by\nproviding a model of a codified scientific discipline the possibility\nof which is clear and, moreover, guaranteed by its own achievement of\ncognition that is both synthetic and a priori (Anderson\n2015). In other words, an explanation of how synthetic a\npriori judgments are affirmed in mathematical contexts, together\nwith the resulting and related explanation of how a systematic body of\ndemonstrable knowledge comprises such judgments, allow mathematical\ntruth to be invoked as a paradigm of the substantive yet necessary and\nuniversal truths that metaphysics hopes to achieve. Kant\u2019s\ntheory of mathematical concept construction (discussed above) can only\nbe fully appreciated in conjunction with his treatment of such broader\nquestions about the very nature and possibility of mathematical and\nmetaphysical knowledge (Jauernig 2013).\n\nIn both the Preamble to the Prolegomena to Any Future\nMetaphysics and the B-Introduction to the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant introduces the analytic/synthetic distinction, which\ndistinguishes between judgments the predicates of which belong to or\nare contained in the subject concept and judgments the predicates of\nwhich are connected to but go beyond the subject concept,\nrespectively. In each text, he follows his presentation of this\ndistinction with a discussion of his claim that all mathematical\njudgments are synthetic and a\n priori.[4]\n There he claims, first, that \u201cproperly mathematical judgments\nare always a priori judgments\u201d on the grounds that they\nare necessary, and so cannot be derived from experience (B14). He\nfollows this with an explanation of how such non-empirical judgments\ncan yet be synthetic, that is, how they can serve to synthesize a\nsubject and predicate concept rather than merely explicate or analyze\na subject concept into its constituent logical parts.\n\nHere Kant famously invokes the arithmetical proposition \u201c7\n+ 5 = 12\u201d and argues that such a judgment is synthetic. He\nargues negatively, claiming that \u201cno matter how long I\nanalyze my concept of such a possible sum [of seven and five] I will\nstill not find twelve in it\u201d, and also positively, claiming that\n\u201cOne must go beyond these concepts [of seven and five], seeking\nassistance in the intuition that corresponds to one of the two,\none\u2019s five fingers, say\u2026and one after another add the\nunits of the five given in the intuition to the concept of\nseven\u2026and thus see the number 12 arise\u201d (B15). He takes\nit to follow that the necessary truth of an arithmetic proposition\nsuch as \u201c7 + 5 = 12\u201d cannot be established by any method\nof logical or conceptual analysis (Anderson 2004, 2015), but\ncan be established by intuitive synthesis (Parsons 1969).\nRecently, discussions of Kant\u2019s theory of arithmetic have\nshifted focus from questions about the syntheticity and apriority of\narithmetic judgments to investigations into Kant\u2019s account of\nnumber. Topics that arise here include ordinality and cardinality\n(Sutherland 2017, 2020); real numbers (Tait 2020; van Atten 2012);\nfinitism (Tait 2016; Sieg 2016); infinity and infinitesmals (Brittan\n2020; Smyth 2014, 2021; Warren 2020); and the centrality of the\nconcept of number in Kant\u2019s conception of the possibility of\nexperience (Carson 2020).\n\nKant follows his discussion of arithmetic reasoning and truth with\ncorresponding claims about Euclidean geometry, according to which the\nprinciples of geometry express synthetic relations between concepts\n(such as between the concept of the straight line between two points\nand the concept of the shortest line between those same two points),\nneither of which can be analytically \u201cextracted\u201d from the\nother. The principles of geometry thus express relations among basic\ngeometric concepts inasmuch as these can be \u201cexhibited in\nintuition\u201d (Shabel 2003; Sutherland 2005a). Elsewhere, Kant\nalso includes geometric theorems as the sorts of propositions\n(in addition to geometric principles) that count as synthetic, and\noffers thoughts about geometric proof (A716\u20137/B744\u20135) (Friedman\n1992, 2010; Shabel 2004). One way to understand the syntheticity\nof geometric theorems is by recognizing an indispensable diagrammatic\nrole for intuitions in geometric proof (Shabel 2004, 2004). \n\nNotably, the scope of Kant\u2019s claim that geometric theorems are\nsynthetic is not transparent. Having denied that the\nprinciples (Grunds\u00e4tze) could be cognized analytically\nfrom the principle of contradiction, he admits that mathematical\ninference of the kind needed to establish geometric theorems\ndoes proceed \u201cin accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction\u201d, and also that \u201ca synthetic proposition can\nof course be comprehended in accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction\u201d though \u201conly insofar as another synthetic\nproposition is presupposed from which it can be deduced, never in\nitself\u201d (B14). So, while he is clear that all mathematical\njudgments, including geometric theorems, are synthetic, he is less\nclear about exactly what it means for such propositions or the\ninferences that support them to \u201caccord with\u201d the\nprinciple of contradiction, derivability from which he takes to be the\nparadigm test of analyticity (Hogan 2020). This\nleads to an interpretive disagreement as to whether demonstrable\nmathematical judgments follow from the synthetic principles via\nstrictly logical or conceptual inference\u2014and so in strict\naccordance with only the principle of contradiction\u2014or\nwhether they are deduced via inferences that are themselves reliant on\nintuition, but which do not violate the law of contradiction. There is\nthus disagreement over whether Kant is committed merely to the\nsyntheticity of the axioms of mathematics (which transmit syntheticity\nto demonstrable theorems via logical inference), or is also committed\nto the syntheticity of mathematical inference itself. The former\ninterpretive position is originally associated with Ernst Cassirer and\nLewis White Beck; the latter position with Bertrand Russell (Hogan\n2020). Gordon Brittan (Brittan 2006) conceives both such positions\n\u201cevidentialist\u201d, which is his label for any interpretation\naccording to which intuitions provide indispensable evidence for the\ntruth of mathematics, whether that evidence is provided in support of\naxioms or inferences, or both (Brittan 2006).\n\nAttention to this interpretive issue in Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics is vital for the light it sheds on the more general\nquestion of what makes synthetic a priori cognition possible,\nthe central question of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.\nWith respect to this more general question, it is important to\ndifferentiate Kant\u2019s use of the terms \u201canalytic\u201d and\n\u201csynthetic\u201d to mark a logico-semantic distinction between\ntypes of judgments\u2014which Kant uses to defend the distinctive\nthesis that mathematical cognition is synthetic a\npriori\u2014from his use of the same terms to mark a traditional\nmathematical distinction, between analytic and synthetic\nmethods. He deploys the latter distinction in order to\nidentify two distinct argumentative strategies for answering the\nquestion of the \u201cpossibility of pure mathematics.\u201d The\nanalytic method is characterized by reasoning that traces a given body\nof cognition, such as mathematics, to its origin or sources in the\nmind. By contrast, the synthetic method aims to derive real cognition\ndirectly from such original cognitive sources, which sources or powers\nare first explicated independently of any particular body of cognition\n(including mathematics) that the powers might ultimately produce. Kant\nadopts the former method in his Prolegomena, arguing from the\nsynthetic and a priori nature of mathematical judgment to the\nclaim that space and time are the forms of human sensibility; he\nadopts the latter method in the Critique of Pure Reason,\narguing that the forms of human sensibility, space and time, provide\nthe basis from which to derive synthetic and a priori\nmathematical judgments (Shabel 2004). These arguments, together with\nthe details of his account of the synthetic and a priori\nnature of all mathematical judgment, provide an answer to the question\nof the possibility of mathematics: the practices that yield the\nparadigmatically synthetic and a priori judgments of the\nscience of mathematics are grounded in and explained by the very\nnature of human sensibility, and, in particular, by the\nspatio-temporal form of all (and only) the objects of human experience\n(Van Cleve 1999). But, this answer raises further questions, in\nparticular about how to distinguish between metaphysical and geometric\nrepresentations of space (Carson 1997; Friedman 2000, 2015, 2020; Onof\nand Schulting 2014; Tolley 2016).\n2.3 Kant\u2019s conception of the role of mathematics in Transcendental Idealism\n\nKant\u2019s theory of mathematical practice connects not only with\nhis theory of intuition and sensibility (as described above) but also\nwith other aspects of the doctrine of Transcendental Idealism, as it\nis articulated throughout Kant\u2019s critical works.\n\nIn the Transcendental Analytic, Kant deduces the table of twelve\ncategories, or pure concepts of the understanding, the first six of\nwhich he describes as \u201cmathematical\u201d (as opposed to\n\u201cdynamical\u201d) categories because of their concern with\nobjects of intuition (B110). The concept of number is treated as\n\u201cbelonging\u201d to the category of \u201callness\u201d or\ntotality, which is itself thought to result from the combination of\nthe concepts of unity and plurality (Parsons 1984; see 2.2 above for\nother topics related to Kant\u2019s account of number). But, Kant\nclaims further that difficulties that arise in the representation of\ninfinities\u2014in which one allegedly represents unity and plurality\nwith no resulting representation of number\u2014reveal that\na concept of number must require the mediation of \u201ca special act\nof the understanding\u201d (B111). (This special act is presumably\nthe synthesis that Kant describes as a function of both\nimagination and understanding, and which it is the business of the\nfull theory of judgment\u2014including the Transcendental Deduction\nand the Schematism\u2014to explain (Carson 2017; Longuenesse 1998).)\nSo, though he also claims that arithmetic \u201cforms its concepts of\nnumbers through successive addition of units in time\u201d (4:283),\nit is misleading to infer that arithmetic is to time as geometry is to\nspace, since a formal intuition of time is inadequate to explain the\ngeneral and abstract science of\n number.[5]\n In fact, Kant declares mechanics to be the mathematical science that\nis to time what geometry is to space (Sutherland 2014).\n\nIn the Schematism, Kant undertakes to identify the particular\nmechanism that enables the pure concepts of the understanding to\nsubsume sensible intuitions, with which they are heterogeneous. The\ncategories must be \u201cschematized\u201d because their\nnon-empirical origin in pure understanding prevents their having the\nsort of sensible content that would connect them immediately to the\nobjects of experience; transcendental schemata are mediating\nrepresentations that are meant to establish the connection between\npure concepts and appearances in a rule-governed way. Mathematical\nconcepts are discussed in this context since they are unique in being\npure but also sensible concepts: they are pure because they are\nstrictly a priori in origin, and yet they are sensible since\nthey are constructed in concreto. (Kant further complicates\nthis issue by identifying number as the pure schema of the category of\nmagnitude (Longuenesse 1998).) There arises an interpretive question\nas to whether mathematical concepts, whose conceptual content is given\nsensibly, require schematization by a distinguishable \u201cthird\nthing\u201d, and, if so, what it amounts to (Leavitt 1991; Young\n1984). More broadly, the question arises as to how the transcendental\nimagination, the faculty responsible for schematism, operates in\nmathematical contexts (Domski 2010).\n\nFinally, in the Analytic of Principles, Kant derives the synthetic\njudgments that \u201cflow a priori from pure concepts of the\nunderstanding\u201d and which ground all other a priori\ncognitions, including those of mathematics (A136/B175). The principles\nof pure understanding that are associated with the categories of\nquantity (i.e., unity, plurality and totality) are the Axioms of\nIntuition. Whereas mathematical principles proper are \u201cdrawn\nonly from intuition\u201d and so do not constitute any part of the\nsystem of principles of pure understanding, the explanation for the\npossibility of such mathematical principles (outlined above) must be\nsupplemented by an account of the highest possible transcendental\nprinciples (A148\u20139/B188\u20139) (Shabel 2017). Accordingly, the\nAxioms of Intuition provide a meta-principle, or principle of\nthe mathematical principles of quantity, namely that \u201cAll\nintuitions are extensive magnitudes\u201d (A161/B202). Most\ncommentators interpret Kant here to be indicating why the principles\nof mathematics, which have to do with pure space and time, are\napplicable to the appearances: the appearances can only be represented\n\u201cthrough the same synthesis as that through which space and time\nin general are determined\u201d (A161/B202). So, all\nintuitions, whether pure or empirical, are \u201cextensive\nmagnitudes\u201d that are governed by the principles of mathematics.\n(For an alternative view of the Axioms, see Sutherland\n2005b).\n\nIt is also notable that key passages in the Critique of the Power\nof Judgment deal with mathematics and the \u201cmathematical\nsublime\u201d (Fugate 2014; Breitenbach 2015). See especially\n[5:248ff].\n3. Commentary on Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics\n3.1 History of the Field\n\nKant\u2019s conception of mathematics was debated by his\ncontemporaries; influenced and provoked Frege, Russell and Husserl;\nand provided inspiration for Brouwerian Intuitionism. His conception\nof mathematics was rejuvenated as worthy of close historical study by\nGottfried Martin\u2019s 1938 monograph Arithmetik und\nKombinatoric bei Kant (Martin 1985). Despite the very different\npositions that contemporary commentators develop as to how best to\nunderstand Kant\u2019s thought, they are broadly united in opposing a\nlong-standard story (perhaps originally promoted by Bertrand Russell\nin his Principles of Mathematics and by Rudolph Carnap in his\nPhilosophical Foundations of Physics) according to which the\ndevelopment of modern logic in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, and the\nformalization of mathematics renders Kant\u2019s intuition-based\ntheory of mathematics and related philosophical commitments obsolete\nor irrelevant. Contemporary commentators seek to reconstruct\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics from the vantage of\nKant\u2019s own historical context and also to identify the elements\nof Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics that are of eternal\nphilosophical interest (Parsons 2014).\n\nEnglish language scholarship in the analytic tradition on\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics (the focus of this\narticle) has been influenced most strongly by an enduring debate\nbetween Jaakko Hintikka and Charles Parsons over Kant\u2019s view of\nthe role of intuition in mathematics, leading to what have\ncome to be known as the \u201clogical\u201d and\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d interpretations; by Michael\nFriedman\u2019s seminal book, Kant and the Exact Sciences\n(Friedman 1992), as well as his now classic articles\n\u201cKant\u2019s Theory of Geometry\u201d and \u201cGeometry,\nConstruction and Intuition in Kant and his Successors\u201d (Friedman\n1985, 2000); and by the papers collected in Carl Posy\u2019s volume\nKant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics: Modern\nEssays (which includes contributions by Hintikka, Parsons\nand Friedman, as well as by Stephen Barker, Gordon Brittan, William\nHarper, Philip Kitcher, Arthur Melnick, Carl Posy, Manley Thompson,\nand J.Michael Young, all of which were published more than twenty five\nyears ago (Posy 1992).)\n3.2 Interpretive Debates\n\nThe interpretive debate over how to understand Kant\u2019s view of\nthe role of intuition in mathematical reasoning has had the strongest\ninfluence on the shape of scholarship in Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics; this debate is directly related to the question\n(described above) of the syntheticity of mathematical axioms, theorems\nand inferences. In his general discussion of mental representation,\nKant implies that immediacy and singularity are both criteria of\nnon-conceptual, intuitive representation, the species of\nrepresentation that grounds synthetic judgment. In a series of papers,\nCharles Parsons (Parsons 1964, 1969, 1984) has argued that the\nsyntheticity of mathematical judgments depends on mathematical\nintuitions being fundamentally immediate, and he explains the\nimmediacy of such representations in a perceptual way, as a direct,\nphenomenological presence to the mind. Jaakko Hintikka (Hintikka 1965,\n1967, 1969), developing an idea from E.W. Beth\u2019s earlier work,\ncounters that the syntheticity of mathematical judgments instead\ndepends only on the singularity of their intuitive constituents.\nHintikka assimilates mathematical intuitions to singular terms or\nparticulars, and explains the use of intuition in a mathematical\ncontext by analogy to an application of the logical rule of\nexistential instantiation. These two positions have come to be known\nas the \u201cphenomenological\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d\ninterpretations, respectively.\n\nMichael Friedman\u2019s original position (Friedman 1985, 1992) with\nrespect to the role of intuition in mathematical reasoning descends\nfrom Beth\u2019s and Hintikka\u2019s, though it is substantially\ndifferent from theirs and has been modified in his most recent\nwritings. In his Kant and the Exact Sciences (Friedman 1992),\nFriedman takes the position that our modern conception of logic ought\nto be used as a tool for interpreting (rather than criticizing) Kant,\nnoting that the explicit representation of an infinity of mathematical\nobjects that can be generated by the polyadic logic of modern\nquantification theory is conceptually unavailable to the mathematician\nand logician of Kant\u2019s time. As a result of the inadequacy of\nmonadic logic to represent an infinity of objects, the\neighteenth-century mathematician relies on intuition to deliver the\nrepresentations necessary for mathematical reasoning. Friedman\nexplicates the details of Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics on\nthe basis of this historical insight.\n\nFriedman has modified his original position in response to criticism\nfrom Emily Carson (Carson 1997), who has developed an interpretation\nof Kant\u2019s theory of geometry that is Parsonsian in its\nanti-formalist emphasis on the epistemological and phenomenological\nover the logical role for intuition in mathematics. In recent work\n(Friedman 2000, 2010), Friedman argues that the intuition that grounds\ngeometry is fundamentally kinematical, and is best explained by the\ntranslations and rotations that describe both the constructive action\nof the Euclidean geometer and the perceptual point of view of the\nordinary, spatially oriented observer. This account provides a\nsynthesis between the logical and phenomenological interpretive\naccounts, in large part by connecting the geometrical space that is\nexplored by the imagination via Euclidean constructions to the\nperspectival space that is, according to Kant, the form of all outer\nsensibility. More specifically, Friedman reconciles the logical\ninterpretation with the phenomenological by \u201c[embedding]\nthe purely logical understanding of geometrical constructions (as\nSkolem functions) within space as the pure form of our outer sensible\nintuition (as described in the Transcendental Aesthetic)\u201d\n(Friedman 2012, n.17). Additionally, Friedman has argued against\ndiagrammatic interpretations of Kantian intuition (Friedman 2012) and\nhas marshalled evidence from the B-Deduction to support his\nunderstanding of the connections among geometrical construction, the\nspace of perception, and physical space (Friedman 2020), and the\nrelation between geometry and experience (Friedman 2015).\n3.3. Current State of the Field\n\nNew generations of scholars contribute to a lively, fertile and\nongoing discussion about the interpretation and legacy of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy of mathematics that originated with the literature\nmentioned in 3.1 and 3.2, above. However, recent work is not easily\ncategorized as landing on either side of one or another interpretive\ndebate; most scholars are using the field\u2019s foundational\ndiscussions as a springboard from which to explore the variety of ways\nin which mathematics plays a role in the critical philosophy. In 2020,\nCarl Posy and Ofra Rechter published the first volume of a two-volume\nsuccessor to Posy\u2019s 1992 collection, entitled\nKant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics, Volume I: The\nCritical Philosophy and Its Roots. This first volume includes\ntwelve essays on topics that range from the pre-critical origins of\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics to his critical thoughts on\nmathematical method, logic, geometry and arithmetic. The essays in the\nforthcoming second volume will focus on the reception and influence of\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics. Also notable is a collection\nof articles first published in a special issue of the Canadian Journal\nof Philosophy, Kant: Studies on Mathematics in the Critical\nPhilosophy, edited by Emily Carson and Lisa Shabel (Carson and\nShabel 2014). The nine contributions collected here aim to explore the\ncentrality of mathematics in Kant\u2019s overall philosophical\nsystem. Daniel Sutherland has recently written a book-length\ntreatment of Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics,\nKant\u2019s Mathematical World: Mathematics, Cognition,\nand Experience (Sutherland 2021), in which he focuses on\nKant\u2019s theory of magnitudes as the key to Kant\u2019s account\nof our cognition and experience of the world. A second volume is\nforthcoming.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, R.
