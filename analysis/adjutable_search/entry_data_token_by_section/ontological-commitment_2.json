    "main_text": "Quantifier Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Quine's Criterion: Extensional Versions\n1.3 Quine's Criterion: Extensional Versions\nWe turn now to the task of providing a precise formulation of\nQuine's criterion. This task is none too easy: formulations that keep\nwithin the strictures of Quine's overall philosophy are woefully\ninadequate; the farther one is allowed to stray from Quinean\nstrictures, the better things look; but, by the time one gets to a\ndefensible criterion, one has left Quine far behind. I will consider\nin turn extensional, metalinguistic, and modal formulations.\nQuine's statement of his criterion (quoted above) appears to\nbe modal. It asks: what entities must be taken to\nbe values of the bound variables in order for the sentences of the\ntheory to be true? But given Quine's general hostility to modality\n(e.g., in Quine 1953: 139\u2013159), it is all but certain that he\nthought the \u2018must\u2019 was eliminable. Moreover, Quine\nexplicitly claimed that his account of ontological commitment was\nwithin the theory of reference, not the theory of meaning (Quine\n1953: 130\u2013131). This suggests that Quine had in mind a purely\nextensional criterion, and an extensional individuation of kinds.\nIndeed, Quine provides an extensional criterion for a special case:\nthe ontological commitments of an existential\nsentence.[5] He\nwrites:\n\nTo say that a given existential quantification presupposes objects\nof a given kind is to say simply that the open sentence which follows\nthe quantifier is true of some objects of that kind and none not of\nthat kind. (Quine 1953: 131)\n\nThis criterion seems to give reasonable results for true\nexistential sentences. Thus, \u2018\u2203x\nElephant(x)\u2019 is committed to\n(\u201cpresupposes\u201d) elephants because the open sentence\n\u2018Elephant(x)\u2019 applies to all and only elephants,\nand there are some. It is likewise committed to any kind that contains\nall the elephants: to mammals, to animals, to living things. (It has\nthese commitments whether or not these kinds are expressible in the\nobject language.) And it is not committed to any kind that leaves out\nany elephants, such as male elephant. The\nkind elephant is the smallest kind to which\n\u2018\u2203x Elephant(x)\u2019 is committed. So\nfar, so good.\nBut when the criterion is applied to false existential\nsentences, trouble immediately arises. For example, since there are no\ncentaurs, the open sentence \u2018Centaur(x)\u2019 is not\ntrue of any objects of any kind, and so \u2018\u2203x\nCentaur(x)\u2019 is not ontologically committed to any kind\nof entity. The same goes for \u2018\u2203x\nUnicorn(x)\u2019, and all other false existential\nsentences. But, then, all false existential sentences have the same\nontological commitment, namely, none. And that's wrong on two counts:\n\u2018\u2203x Centaur(x)\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2203x Unicorn(x)\u2019 are\nontologically committing; and their ontological commitments are not\nthe same.\nLet us return, then, to Quine's favored formulation of the\ncriterion involving the \u2018must\u2019 and explore whether it is\ncompatible with an extensionalist account. Indeed, ordinary uses of\n\u2018must\u2019 and other modals are often used to signal\ngenerality without making the content of what is asserted modal.\nConsider the following example: \u201cA set of five numbers between 1\nand 9, inclusive, must contain at least one odd number\u201d. The\ncontent is simply that every set of five numbers between 1 and 9,\ninclusive contains at least one odd number. (Perhaps the\n\u2018must\u2019 is also epistemic, but not in a way that affects\nthe content of what is asserted.)  Similarly, Quine's criterion can be\ninterpreted as innocent quantification: \n\nQuine's Criterion, Extensional Version. A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff every domain of quantification that makes the theory true contains\nat least one K. \n\n(In considering whether a domain makes the theory true, the\ninterpretation of the predicates occurring in the theory is\nrestricted to the domain if need be.) This account is purely\nextensional: if a theory is committed to a kind K,\nand K\u2032 has exactly the same members as K,\nthen the theory is also committed to kind K\u2032. And that\nwill be its downfall. For, as above, \u2018\u2203x\nCentaur(x)\u2019 and \u2018\u2203x\nUnicorn(x)\u2019 will have the same ontological\ncommitments. The only difference is that, because the condition is\nuniversal rather than existential, the criterion will have both of\nthese sentences be (vacuously) committed to every kind of entity.  No\nimprovement there.[6]\nWhat to do? Of course, this result could be avoided by populating\ndomains of quantification with centaurs, unicorns, and all manner of\nfictional being. That would allow one to charge a profligate opponent\nwith an ontological commitment to centaurs, and a distinct ontological\ncommitment to unicorns\u2014but only by taking on these very same\nontological commitments in the metalanguage. For Quine, at least, the\ncure is as bad as the disease.\nAlternatively, one could restrict the criterion to true\ntheories. That would still allow the criterion to be used to allocate\nontological costs, to say which theories are responsible for which\ncosts. Polemical uses of the criterion would have to be foresworn; but\nperhaps they are problematic in any case. The primary role for the\ncriterion, however, would have to be given up: its role in providing a\nfoundation for theory choice.  For if the criterion of ontological\ncommitment is to be applied only to true theories, then one would have\nto determine which theories are true prior to applying the\ncriterion. One might as well have as one's criterion of theory choice:\n\u201cChoose true theories!\u201d So, the idea of restricting\nontological commitment to true theories is a non-starter. Could one\ninstead restrict the criterion to the theories one takes to be\ntrue? That wouldn't so much solve the problem of false\nexistentials as merely hide it from view. But, in any case, one would\nbe no better off with respect to theory choice. One would have to\ndetermine which theories one takes to be true prior to applying the\ncriterion. And so, again, ontological commitment could not serve as a\nfoundation for theory choice. One might as well have as one's\ncriterion of theory choice: \u201cChoose theories you take to be\ntrue!\u201d Restricting the application of the criterion of\nontological commitment is not the solution to the problem of false\nexistentials.\n",
