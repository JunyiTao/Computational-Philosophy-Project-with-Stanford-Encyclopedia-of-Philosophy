    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories do not Work for Logical and Mathematical Relations\n4.1 Causal Theories do not Work for Logical and Mathematical Relations\n\nOne might think that the meanings of terms that denote mathematical or\nlogical relations could not be handled by a causal theory. How could a\nmental version of the symbol \u201c+\u201d be causally connected to\nthe addition function? How could a mental version of the logical\nsymbol \u201c\u00ac\u201d be causally connected to the negation truth\nfunction? The addition function and the negation function are abstract\nobjects. To avoid this problem, causal theories typically acquiesce\nand maintain that their conditions are merely sufficient conditions on\nmeaning. If an object meets the conditions, then that object bears\nmeaning. But, the conditions are not necessary for meaning, so that\nrepresentations of abstract objects get their meaning in some other\nway. Perhaps conceptual role semantics, wherein the meanings of terms\nare defined in terms of the meanings of other terms, could be made to\nwork for these other theories.\n",
