    "preamble": "\n\n\nLawyers are typically interested in the question: What is the\nlaw on a particular issue? This is always a local question and\nanswers to it are bound to differ according to the specific\njurisdiction in which they are asked. In contrast, philosophy of law\nis interested in the general question: What is Law? This general\nquestion about the nature of law presupposes that law is a unique\nsocial-political phenomenon, with more or less universal\ncharacteristics that can be discerned through philosophical\nanalysis. General jurisprudence, as this philosophical inquiry about\nthe nature of law is called, is meant to be universal. It assumes that\nlaw possesses certain features, and it possesses them by its very\nnature, or essence, as law, whenever and wherever it happens to\nexist. However, even if there are such universal characteristics of\nlaw\u2014which is controversial, as we will later discuss\u2014the\nreasons for a philosophical interest in elucidating them remain to be\nexplained. First, there is the sheer intellectual interest in\nunderstanding such a complex social phenomenon which is, after all,\none of the most intricate aspects of human culture. Law, however, is\nalso a normative social practice: it purports to guide human behavior,\ngiving rise to reasons for action. An attempt to explain this\nnormative, reason-giving aspect of law is one of the main challenges\nof general jurisprudence. These two sources of interest in the nature\nof law are closely linked. Law is not the only normative domain in our\nculture; morality, religion, social conventions, etiquette, and so on,\nalso guide human conduct in many ways which are similar to\nlaw. Therefore, part of what is involved in the understanding of the\nnature of law consists in an explanation of how law differs from these\nsimilar normative domains, how it interacts with them, and whether its\nintelligibility depends on other normative orders, like morality or\nsocial conventions.\n\n\nContemporary legal theories define these two main interests in the\nnature of law in the following terms. First, we need to understand the\ngeneral conditions that would render any putative norm legally valid.\nIs it, for example, just a matter of the source of the norm, such as\nits enactment by a particular political institution, or is it also a\nmatter of the norm\u2019s content? This is the general question about the\nconditions of legal validity. Second, there is the interest in the\nnormative aspect of law. This philosophical interest is twofold: A\ncomplete philosophical account of the normativity of law comprises both\nan explanatory and a justificatory task. The explanatory task consists\nof an attempt to explain how legal norms can give rise to reasons for\naction, and what kinds of reasons are involved. The task of\njustification concerns the question of whether people ought to\ncomply\u2014morally speaking or all things considered\u2014with law\u2019s\ndemands. In other words, it is the attempt to explain the moral\nlegitimacy of law and the subjects\u2019 reasons for complying with it. A\ntheory about the nature of law, as opposed to critical theories of law,\nconcentrates on the first of these two questions. It purports to\nexplain what the normativity of law actually consists in. Some\ncontemporary legal philosophers, however, doubt that these two aspects\nof the normativity of law can be separated. (We will return to this\nlater.)\n\n\nThus, elucidating the conditions of legal validity and explaining\nthe normativity of law form the two main subjects of any general theory\nabout the nature of law. In section 1, we will explain some of\nthe main debates about these two issues. In section 2, we will\ndiscuss some of the methodological debates about the nature of general\njurisprudence. In the course of the last few centuries, two main rival\nphilosophical traditions have emerged about the nature of legality. The\nolder one, dating back to late mediaeval Christian scholarship, is\ncalled the\n natural law\ntradition. Since the early 19th century, natural law theories have been\nfiercely challenged by the\n legal positivism\ntradition promulgated by such scholars as\n Jeremy Bentham\nand\n John Austin.\nThe philosophical\norigins of legal positivism are much earlier, though, probably in the\n political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes.\nThe main controversy between these two traditions concerns the\nconditions of legal validity.  Basically, legal positivism asserts,\nand natural law denies, that the conditions of legal validity are\npurely a matter of social facts. In contrast to positivism, natural\nlaw claims that the conditions of legal validity are not exhausted by\nsocial facts; the moral content of the putative norms also bears on\ntheir legal validity. As the famous dictum, commonly attributed to\nSaint Augustine, has it: lex iniusta non est lex (unjust law\nis not law). (Augustine, De Libero Arbitrio, I, 5; see also Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, I-II, Q. 96, Art. 4.)\n\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. General Jurisprudence\n1.1 The Conditions of Legal Validity\n\n\nThe main insight of legal positivism, that the conditions of legal\nvalidity are determined by social facts, involves two separate claims\nwhich have been labeled The Social Thesis and The Separation Thesis.\nThe Social Thesis asserts that law is, profoundly, a social\nphenomenon, and that the conditions of legal validity consist of\nsocial\u2014that is, non-normative\u2014facts. Early legal\npositivists followed Hobbes\u2019 insight that the law is,\nessentially, an instrument of political sovereignty, and they\nmaintained that the basic source of legal validity resides in the\nfacts constituting political sovereignty. Law, they thought, is\nbasically the command of the sovereign. Later legal positivists have\nmodified this view, maintaining that social rules, and not the facts\nabout sovereignty, constitute the grounds of law. Most contemporary\nlegal positivists share the view that there are rules of recognition,\nnamely, social rules or conventions which determine certain facts or\nevents that provide the ways for the creation, modification, and\nannulment of legal standards. These facts, such as an act of\nlegislation or a judicial decision, are the\nsources of law conventionally identified as such in each and\nevery modern legal system. One way of understanding the legal\npositivist position here is to see it as a form of reduction: legal\npositivism maintains, essentially, that legal validity is reducible to\nfacts of a non-normative type, that is, facts about people\u2019s conduct,\nbeliefs and attitudes.\n\n\nNatural lawyers deny this insight, insisting that a putative norm\ncannot become legally valid unless it passes a certain threshold of\nmorality. Positive law must conform in its content to some basic\nprecepts of natural law, that is, universal morality, in order to\nbecome law in the first place. In other words, natural lawyers maintain\nthat the moral content or merit of norms, and not just their social\norigins, also form part of the conditions of legal validity. And again,\nit is possible to view this position as a non-reductive conception of\nlaw, maintaining that legal validity cannot be reduced to non-normative\nfacts. See the entry on\n natural law theories.\n\n\nThe Separation Thesis is an important negative implication of the\nSocial Thesis, maintaining that there is a conceptual separation\nbetween law and morality, that is, between what the law is, and what\nthe law ought to be. The Separation Thesis, however, has often been\noverstated. It is sometimes thought that natural law asserts, and legal\npositivism denies, that the law is, by necessity, morally good or that\nthe law must have some minimal moral content. The Social Thesis\ncertainly does not entail the falsehood of the assumption that there is\nsomething necessarily good in the law. Legal positivism can accept the\nclaim that law is, by its very nature or its essential functions in\nsociety, something good that deserves our moral appreciation. Nor is\nlegal positivism forced to deny the plausible claim that wherever law\nexists, it would have to have a great many prescriptions which coincide\nwith morality. There is probably a considerable overlap, and perhaps\nnecessarily so, between the actual content of law and morality. Once\nagain, the Separation Thesis, properly understood, pertains only to the\nconditions of legal validity. It asserts that the conditions of legal\nvalidity do not depend on the moral merits of the norms in question.\nWhat the law is cannot depend on what it ought to be in the relevant\ncircumstances.\n\n\nMany contemporary legal positivists would not subscribe to this\nformulation of the Separation Thesis. A contemporary school of thought,\ncalled inclusive legal positivism, endorses the Social Thesis,\nnamely, that the basic conditions of legal validity derive from social\nfacts, such as social rules or conventions which happen to prevail in a\ngiven community. But, inclusive legal positivists maintain, legal\nvalidity is sometimes a matter of the moral content of the norms,\ndepending on the particular conventions that happen to prevail in any\ngiven community. The social conventions on the basis of which we\nidentify the law may, but need not, contain reference to moral content\nas a condition of legality (see, for example, Waluchow 1994).\n\n\nThe natural law tradition has undergone a considerable refinement in\nthe 20th century, mainly because its classical, popular version faced\nan obvious objection about its core insight: it is just difficult to\nmaintain that morally bad law is not law. The idea that law must pass,\nas it were, a kind of moral filter in order to count as law strikes\nmost jurists as incompatible with the legal world as we know it.\nTherefore, contemporary natural lawyers have suggested different and\nmore subtle interpretations of the main tenets of natural law. For\nexample, John Finnis (1980) views natural law (in its Thomist version) not as\na constraint on the legal validity of positive laws, but mainly as an\nelucidation of an ideal of law in its fullest, or highest sense,\nconcentrating on the ways in which law necessarily promotes the common\ngood. As we have noted earlier, however, it is not clear that such a\nview about the necessary moral content of law is at odds with the main\ntenets of legal positivism. To the extent that there is a debate here,\nit is a metaphysical one about what is essential or necessary to law,\nand about whether the essential features of law must be elucidated in\nteleological terms or not. Legal positivists do not tend to seek deep\nteleological accounts of law, along the lines articulated by Finnis,\nbut whether they need to deny such metaphysical projects is far from\nclear.\n\n\nThe idea that the conditions of legal validity are at least partly a\nmatter of the moral content or merits of norms is articulated in a\nsophisticated manner by Ronald Dworkin\u2019s legal theory. Dworkin is not a\nclassical natural lawyer, however, and he does not maintain that\nmorally acceptable content is a precondition of a norm\u2019s legality. His\ncore idea is that the very distinction between facts and values in the\nlegal domain, between what the law is and what it ought to be, is much\nmore blurred than legal positivism would have it: Determining what the\nlaw is in particular cases inevitably depends on moral-political\nconsiderations about what it ought to be. Evaluative judgments, about\nthe content law ought to have or what it ought to prescribe, partly\ndetermine what the law actually is.\n\n\nDworkin\u2019s legal theory is not based on a general repudiation of the\nclassical fact-value distinction, as much as it is based on a certain\nconception of legal reasoning. This conception went through two main\nstages. In the 1970s Dworkin (1977) argued that the falsehood of legal\npositivism resides in the fact that it is incapable of accounting for\nthe important role that legal principles play in the law. Legal\npositivism envisaged, Dworkin claimed, that the law consists of rules\nonly. However, this is a serious mistake, since in addition to rules,\nlaw is partly determined by legal principles. The distinction between\nrules and principles is a logical one. Rules, Dworkin maintained, apply\nin an \u201call or nothing fashion.\u201d If the rule applies to the\ncircumstances, it determines a particular legal outcome. If it does not\napply, it is simply irrelevant to the outcome. On the other hand,\nprinciples do not determine an outcome even if they clearly apply to\nthe pertinent circumstances. Principles provide judges with a legal\nreason to decide the case one way or the other, and hence they only\nhave a dimension of weight. That is, the reasons provided by the\nprinciple may be relatively strong, or weak, but they are never\n\u201cabsolute.\u201d Such reasons, by themselves, cannot determine\nan outcome, as rules do.\n\n\nThe most interesting, and from a positivist perspective, most\nproblematic, aspect of legal principles, however, consists in their\nmoral dimension. According to Dworkin\u2019s theory, unlike legal\nrules, which may or may not have something to do with morality,\nprinciples are essentially moral in their content. It is, in fact,\npartly a moral consideration that determines whether a legal principle\nexists or not. Why is that? Because a legal principle exists,\naccording to Dworkin, if the principle follows from the best moral and\npolitical interpretation of past judicial and legislative decisions in\nthe relevant domain. In other words, legal principles occupy an\nintermediary space between legal rules and moral principles. Legal\nrules are posited by recognized institutions and their validity\nderives from their enacted source. Moral principles are what they are\ndue to their content, and their validity is purely content\ndependent. Legal principles, on the other hand, gain their validity\nfrom a combination of source-based and content-based\nconsiderations. As Dworkin put it in the most general terms:\n\u201cAccording to law as integrity, propositions of law are true if\nthey figure in or follow from the principles of justice, fairness, and\nprocedural due process that provide the best constructive\ninterpretation of the community\u2019s legal practice\u201d (Dworkin\n1986, 225). The validity of a legal principle then, derives, from a\ncombination of facts and moral considerations. The facts concern the\npast legal decisions which have taken place in the relevant domain,\nand the considerations of morals and politics concern the ways in\nwhich those past decisions can best be accounted for by the correct\nmoral principles.\n\n\nNeedless to say, if such an account of legal principles is correct,\nthe Separation Thesis can no longer be maintained. But many legal\nphilosophers doubt that there are legal principles of the kind Dworkin\nenvisaged. There is an alternative, more natural way to account for the\ndistinction between rules and principles in the law: the relevant\ndifference concerns the level of generality, or vagueness, of the\nnorm-act prescribed by the pertinent legal norm. Legal norms can be\nmore or less general, or vague, in their definition of the norm-act\nprescribed by the rule, and the more general or vague they are, the\nmore they tend to have those quasi-logical features Dworkin attributes\nto principles. More importantly, notice that if you make the legal\nvalidity of norms, such as legal principles, depend on moral argument,\nyou allow for the possibility that an entire legal community may get\nits laws wrong. Any moral mistake in the reasoning leading to a legal\nprinciple might render the conclusion about the principle unsound, and\nthe principle itself thus not legally valid. Since there is nothing to\nprevent judges and other legal actors from making moral mistakes, there\nis nothing to prevent a result whereby an entire legal community, and\nfor a long time, gets its laws wrong (Marmor 2011, chapter 4). Perhaps\nDworkin would have not found this problematic, but others might; the\nidea that an entire legal community can be systematically mistaken\nabout its own laws might strike legal theorists as deeply\nproblematic.\n\n\nIn the 1980s Dworkin radicalized his views about these issues,\nstriving to ground his anti-positivist legal theory on a general theory\nof interpretation, and emphasizing law\u2019s profound interpretative\nnature. Despite the fact that Dworkin\u2019s interpretative theory of law is\nextremely sophisticated and complex, the essence of his argument from\ninterpretation can be summarized in a rather simple way. The main\nargument consists of two main premises. The first thesis maintains that\ndetermining what the law requires in each and every particular case\nnecessarily involves interpretative reasoning. Any statement of the\nform \u201cAccording to the law in \\(S\\), \\(x\\) has a right/duty\netc., to \\(y\\)\u201d is a conclusion of some\ninterpretation or other. Now, according to the second premise,\ninterpretation always involves evaluative considerations. More\nprecisely, perhaps, interpretation is neither purely a matter of\ndetermining facts, nor is it a matter of evaluative judgment per\nse, but an inseparable mixture of both. Clearly enough, one who\naccepts both these theses must conclude that the Separation Thesis is\nfundamentally flawed. If Dworkin is correct about both theses, it\nsurely follows that determining what the law requires always\ninvolves evaluative considerations.\n\n\nNotably, the first premise of Dworkin\u2019s general argument is highly\ncontestable. Some legal philosophers have argued that legal reasoning\nis not as thoroughly interpretative as Dworkin assumes. Interpretation,\naccording to this view, long maintained by H.L.A. Hart (1961, chapter\n7), is an exception to the standard understanding of language and\ncommunication, rendered necessary only when the law is, for some\nreason, unclear. However, in most standard instances, the law can\nsimply be understood, and applied, without the mediation of\ninterpretation (Marmor 2011, chapter 6).\n\n\nDworkin\u2019s legal theory shares certain insights with the inclusive\nversion of legal positivism. Note, however, that although both Dworkin\nand inclusive legal positivists share the view that morality and legal\nvalidity are closely related, they differ on the grounds of this\nrelationship. Dworkin maintains that the dependence of legal validity\non moral considerations is an essential feature of law that\nderives from law\u2019s profoundly interpretative nature. Inclusive\npositivism, on the other hand, maintains that such a dependence of\nlegal validity on moral considerations is a contingent matter; it does\nnot derive from the nature of law or of legal reasoning as such.\nInclusive positivists accept the Social Thesis; they claim that moral\nconsiderations affect legal validity only in those cases where this is\ndictated by the social rules or conventions which happen to prevail in a\ngiven legal system. The relevance of morality is determined in any\ngiven legal system by the contingent content of that society\u2019s\nconventions. As opposed to both these views, traditional, or as it is\nnow called, exclusive legal positivism maintains that a norm\u2019s\nlegal validity is never dependent on its moral content. Legal validity,\naccording to this view, is entirely dependent on the conventionally\nrecognized factual sources of law.\n\n\nIt may be worth noting that those legal theories maintaining that\nlegal validity partly depends on moral considerations must also share a\ncertain view about the nature of morality. Namely, they must hold an\nobjective stance with respect to the nature of moral values. Otherwise,\nif moral values are not objective and legality depends on morality,\nlegality would also be rendered subjective, posing serious problems for\nthe question of how to identify what the law is. Some legal theories,\nhowever, do insist on the subjectivity of moral judgements, thus\nembracing the skeptical conclusions that follow about the nature of\nlaw. According to these skeptical theories, law is, indeed, profoundly\ndependent on morality, but, as these theorists assume that morality is\nentirely subjective, it only demonstrates how the law is also\nprofoundly subjective, always up for grabs, so to speak. This skeptical\napproach, fashionable in so-called post-modernist literature, crucially\ndepends on a subjectivist theory of values, which is rarely articulated\nin this literature in any sophisticated way.\n1.2 The Normativity of Law\n\n\nThroughout human history the law has been known as a coercive\ninstitution, enforcing its practical demands on its subjects by means\nof threats and violence. This conspicuous feature of law made it very\ntempting for some philosophers to assume that the normativity of law\nresides in its coercive aspect. Even within the legal positivist\ntradition, however, the coercive aspect of the law has given rise to\nfierce controversies. Early legal positivists, such as Bentham and\nAustin, maintained that coercion is an essential feature of\nlaw, distinguishing it from other normative domains. Legal positivists\nin the 20th century have tended to deny this, claiming that coercion is\nneither essential to law, nor, actually, pivotal to the fulfillment of\nits functions in society. Before we unpack the various issues involved\nin this controversy, it might be worth noting that the debate about\nlaw\u2019s coercive aspect is one good example of debates in jurisprudence\nthat focus on what might be an essential or a necessary feature of law,\nregardless of its particular manifestations in this or that legal\nsystem. How to understand these claims about the essence of law, and\nthe question of whether these claims are about metaphysics or something\nelse, perhaps about morality, will be discussed in section 2.1.\n\n\nReturning to law\u2019s coercive aspect, there are several issues\nentangled here, and we should carefully separate them. John Austin\nfamously maintained that each and every legal norm, as such, must\ncomprise a threat backed by sanction. This involves at least two\nseparate claims: In one sense, it can be understood as a thesis about\nthe concept of law, maintaining that what we call \u201claw\u201d can\nonly be those norms which are backed by sanctions of the political\nsovereign. In a second, though not less problematic sense, the intimate\nconnection between the law and the threat of sanctions is a thesis\nabout the normativity of law. It is a reductionist thesis about law\u2019s\nnormative character, maintaining that the normativity of law consists\nin the subjects\u2019 ability to predict the chances of incurring punishment\nor evil and their presumed desire to avoid it.\n\n\nIn addition to this particular controversy, there is the further\nquestion, concerning the relative importance of sanctions for the\nability of law to fulfill its social functions. Hans Kelsen,\nfor instance, maintained that the monopolization of violence in\nsociety, and the law\u2019s ability to impose its demands by violent means,\nis the most important of law\u2019s functions in society. Twentieth century\nlegal positivists, like H.L.A. Hart and Joseph Raz, deny this,\nmaintaining that the coercive aspect of law is much more marginal than\ntheir predecessors assumed. Once again, the controversy here is\nactually twofold: is coercion essential to what the law does?\nAnd even if it is not deemed essential, how important it is, compared\nwith the other functions law fulfills in our lives?\n\n\nAustin\u2019s reductionist account of the normativity of law,\nmaintaining that the normative aspect of law simply consists in the\nsubjects\u2019 desire to avoid sanctions, was discussed extensively,\nand fiercely criticized, by H.L.A. Hart. Hart\u2019s fundamental\nobjection to Austin\u2019s reductionist account of law\u2019s\nnormativity is, on his own account, \u201cthat the predictive\ninterpretation obscures the fact that, where rules exist, deviations\nfrom them are not merely grounds for prediction that hostile reactions\nwill follow\u2026. but are also deemed to be a reason or\njustification for such reaction and for applying the sanctions\u201d\n(Hart 1961, 82). This emphasis on the reason-giving function of rules\nis surely correct, but perhaps not enough. Supporters of the\npredictive account could claim that it only begs the further question\nof why people should regard the rules of law as reasons or\njustifications for actions. If it is, for example, only\nbecause the law happens to be an efficient sanction-provider, then the\npredictive model of the normativity of law may turn out to be correct\nafter all. In other words, Hart\u2019s fundamental objection to the\npredictive model is actually a result of his vision about the main\nfunctions of law in society, holding, contra Austin and Kelsen, that\nthose functions are not exclusively related to the ability of the law\nto impose sanctions.\n\n\nIt is arguable, however, that law\u2019s functions in our culture are\nmore closely related to its coercive aspect than Hart seems to have\nassumed. Contemporary use of \u201cgame theory\u201d in the law tends\nto show that the rationale of a great variety of legal arrangements can\nbe best explained by the function of law in solving problems of\nopportunism, like the so called Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma situations. In these\ncases, the law\u2019s main role is, indeed, one of providing coercive\nincentives for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned. Be this as\nit may, we should probably refrain from endorsing Austin\u2019s or Kelsen\u2019s\nposition that law\u2019s only function in society is essentially tied to its\ncoercive aspects. Solving recurrent and multiple coordination problems,\nsetting standards for desirable behavior, proclaiming symbolic\nexpressions of communal values, resolving disputes about facts, and\nsuch, are important functions which the law serves in our society, and\nthose have very little to do with law\u2019s coercive aspect and its\nsanction-imposing functions.\n\n\nThe extent to which law can actually guide behavior by providing its\nsubjects with reasons for action has been questioned by a very\ninfluential group of legal scholars in the first half of the\n20th century, called the Legal Realism school. American\nLegal Realists claimed that our ability to predict the outcomes of\nlegal cases on the basis of the rules of law is rather limited. In the\nmore difficult cases which tend to be adjudicated in the appellate\ncourts, legal rules, by themselves, are radically indeterminate as to\nthe outcome of the cases. The Legal Realists thought that lawyers who\nare interested in the predictive question of what the courts will\nactually decide in difficult cases need to engage in sociological and\npsychological research, striving to develop theoretical tools that\nwould enable us to predict legal outcomes. Thus Legal Realism was\nmainly an attempt to introduce the social sciences into the domain of\njurisprudence for predictive purposes. To what extent this scientific\nproject succeeded is a matter of controversy. Be this as it may, Legal\nRealism paid very little attention to the question of the normativity\nof law, that is, to the question of how the law does guide behavior in\nthose cases in which it seems to be determinate enough.\n\n\nA much more promising approach to the normativity of law is found in\nJoseph Raz\u2019s theory of authority, which also shows how such a theory\nabout the normativity of law entails important conclusions with respect\nto the conditions of legal validity (Raz 1994). The basic insight of\nRaz\u2019s argument is that the law is an authoritative social institution.\nThe law, Raz claims, is a de facto authority. However, it is\nalso essential to law that it must be held to claim legitimate\nauthority. Any particular legal system may fail, of course, in its\nfulfillment of this claim. But law is the kind of institution which\nnecessarily claims to be a legitimate authority.\n\n\nAccording to Raz, the essential role of authorities in our practical\nreasoning is to mediate between the putative subjects of the authority\nand the right reasons which apply to them in the relevant\ncircumstances. An authority is legitimate if and only if it helps its\nputative subjects to comply better with the right reasons relevant to\ntheir actions\u2014i.e., if they are more likely to act in compliance\nwith these reasons by following the authoritative resolution than they\nwould be if they tried to figure out and act on the reasons directly\n(without the mediating resolution). For example, there may be many\nreasons that bear on the question of how fast to drive on a particular\nroad\u2014the amount of pedestrian traffic, impending turns in the\nroad, etc.\u2014but drivers may comply better with the balance of\nthose reasons by following the legal speed limit than if they tried to\nfigure out all the trade-offs in the moment. The legitimacy of the\nlegal speed limit would thus be derived from the way in which it aids\npeople in acting in better compliance with the balance of the right\nreasons.\n\n\nNow, it follows that for something to be able to claim legitimate\nauthority, it must be of the kind of thing capable of claiming\nit, namely, capable of fulfilling such a mediating role. What kinds of\nthings can claim legitimate authority? There are at least two such\nfeatures necessary for authority-capacity: First, for something to be\nable to claim legitimate authority, it must be the case that its\ndirectives are identifiable as authoritative directives,\nwithout the necessity of relying on those same reasons which the\nauthoritative directive replaces. If this condition is not met, namely,\nif it is impossible to identify the authoritative directive as such\nwithout relying on those same reasons the authority was meant to rely\non, then the authority could not fulfill its essential, mediating role.\nIn short, it could not make the practical difference it is there to\nmake. Note that this argument does not concern the efficacy of\nauthorities. The point is not that unless authoritative directives can\nbe recognized as such, authorities could not function effectively. The\nargument is based on the rationale of authorities within our practical\nreasoning. Authorities are there to make a practical difference, and\nthey could not make such a difference unless the authority\u2019s directive\ncan be recognized as such without recourse to the reasons it is there\nto decide upon. In other words, it is pointless to have an\nauthoritative directive if, in order to discover what the directive is,\nyou have to engage in the same reasoning that reliance on the directive\nis supposed to replace. Secondly, for something to be able to claim\nlegitimate authority, it must be capable of forming an opinion on how\nits subjects ought to behave, distinct from the subjects\u2019 own reasoning\nabout their reasons for action; authority requires some authorship.\n\n\nRaz\u2019s conception of legal authority provides very strong support for\nexclusive legal positivism because it requires that the law,\nqua an authoritative resolution, be identifiable on its own\nterms, that is, without having to rely on those same considerations\nthat the law is there to resolve. Therefore a norm is legally valid\n(i.e., authoritative) only if its validity does not derive from moral or\nother evaluative considerations that the law is intended to replace.\nNotably, Raz\u2019s theory challenges both Dworkin\u2019s anti-positivist legal\ntheory, and the inclusive version of legal positivism. This challenge,\nand the controversies it gave rise to, form one of the main topics\ndiscussed in contemporary general jurisprudence.\n\n\nExplaining the rationale of legal authority, however, is not the only\ncomponent of a theory about the normativity of law. If we hold the\nlegal positivist thesis that law is essentially founded on social\nconventions, another important question arises here: how can a\nconventional practice give rise to reasons for action and, in\nparticular, to obligations? Some legal philosophers claimed that\nconventional rules cannot, by themselves, give rise to obligations. As\nLeslie Green observed, Hart\u2019s \u201cview that the fundamental\nrules [of recognition] are \u2018mere conventions\u2019 continues to\nsit uneasily with any notion of obligation,\u201d and this Green\nfinds troubling, because the rules of recognition point to the\n\u201csources that judges are legally bound to apply\u201d\n(Green 1996, 1697). The debate here is partly about the conventional\nnature of the rules of recognition, and partly about the ways in which\nconventions can figure in our reasons for action. According to one\ninfluential theory, inspired by David Lewis (1969) conventional rules\nemerge as solutions to large-scale and recurrent coordination\nproblems. If the rules of recognition are, indeed, of such a\ncoordination kind, it is relatively easy to explain how they may give\nrise to obligations. Coordination conventions would be obligatory if\nthe norm subjects have an obligation to solve the coordination problem\nwhich initially gave rise to the emergence of the relevant\nconvention. It is doubtful, however, that the conventions at the\nfoundations of law are of a coordinative kind. In certain respects the\nlaw may be more like a structured game, or an artistic genre, which\nare actually constituted by social conventions. Such constitutive\nconventions are not explicable as solutions to some pre-existing\nrecurrent coordination problem. The conventional rules constituting\nthe game of chess, for example, are not there to solve a coordination\nproblem between potential players. Antecedent to the game of chess,\nthere was no particular coordination problem to solve. The\nconventional rules of chess constitute the game itself as a kind of\nsocial activity people would find worthwhile engaging in. The\nconstitutive conventions partly constitute the values inherent in the\nemergent social practice. Such values, however, are only there for\nthose who care to see them. Constitutive conventions, by themselves,\ncannot ground an obligation to engage in the practice they\nconstitute.\n\n\nFrom a moral point of view, the rules of recognition, by themselves,\ncannot be regarded as sources of obligation to follow the law. Whether\njudges, or anybody else, should or should not respect the rules of\nrecognition of a legal system, is ultimately a moral issue, that can\nonly be resolved by moral arguments (concerning the age old issue of\npolitical obligation). And this is more generally so: the existence of\na social practice, in itself, does not provide anyone with an\nobligation to engage in the practice. The rules of recognition only\ndefine what the practice is, and they can say nothing on the question\nof whether one should or should not engage in it. But of course, once\none does engage in the practice, playing the role of judge or some\nother legal official, as it were, there are legal obligations\ndefined by the rules of the game. In other words, there is nothing\nspecial in the idea of a legal obligation to follow the rules\nof recognition. The referee in a soccer game is equally obliged to\nfollow the rules of his game, and the fact that the game is\nconventional poses no difficulty from this, let us say,\n\u201cinternal-player\u2019s\u201d perspective. But again, the\nconstitutive rules of soccer cannot settle for anyone the question of\nwhether they should play soccer or not. Similarly, the rules of\nrecognition cannot settle for the judge, or anyone else for that\nmatter, whether they should play by the rules of law, or not. They only\ntell us what the law is. Unlike chess or soccer, however, the\nlaw may well be a kind of game that people have an obligation to play,\nas it were. But if there is such an obligation, it must emerge from\nexternal, moral, considerations, that is, from a general moral\nobligation to obey the law. The complex question of whether there is\nsuch a general obligation to obey the law, and whether it depends on\ncertain features of the relevant legal system, is extensively discussed\nin the literature on political obligation. A complete theory about the\nnormativity of law must encompass these moral issues as well. (See the\n entries on\n political obligation\n and\n legal obligation.)\n\nMore recently, however, a number of philosophers have started to\nquestion the idea that there is something unique to the normativity of\nlaw, inviting us to see how laws might affect our reasons for action\nin ways that are not closely tied to the nature of law (Greenberg\n2014, Enoch 2011, Marmor 2016 [2018]). Some of these views (e.g., Enoch,\nMarmor) purport to show that there are different ways in which the\nexistence of various norms bear on people\u2019s reasons for action,\npresent in law as elsewhere, without denying that the law often makes\na difference; these views only deny that there is something unique to\nthe way law changes its subjects\u2019 reasons for action, compared with\nother types normative demands. Others challenge law\u2019s normativity from\nan opposite angle (Greenberg 2014, Hershovitz 2015), arguing that the\nonly aspect of law that is of normative significance is the moral\ndifference that it makes to people\u2019s reasons for action.\n\n\nIn the last two decades of the 20th century, new challenges to general\njurisprudence, and particularly to legal positivism, have taken an\ninteresting methodological turn. This methodological turn gained\nmomentum with the publication of Dworkin\u2019s\nLaw\u2019s Empire (1986), arguing that not only the law, as a\nsocial practice, is a profoundly interpretative (and thus partly, but\nnecessarily, evaluative in nature), but that any theory about the\nnature of law is also interpretative in a similar way, and thus,\nequally evaluative. Many of those who do not necessarily share\nDworkin\u2019s views about the interpretative nature of legal practice, or\nthe specifics of his theory of interpretation, have joined him in this\nmethodological skepticism about the traditional aims of general\njurisprudence, that is, about the possibility of developing a theory\nabout that nature of law that would have general application and remain\nmorally neutral. These, and other resultant methodological challenges\nto traditional general jurisprudence are taken up in the next\nsection.\n\nIt would be fair to say, however, that in the last few years, many\nlegal philosophers have expressed a growing frustration with these\ntraditional debates about the nature of law, calling for legal\nphilosophy to move beyond the Hart-Dworkin debates and explore new\navenues of research. Some of these new critics are content to abandon\nthe project altogether, declaring the death of general jurisprudence\n(Hershovitz 2015). Others, however, are engaged in exploring new\nchallenges. One emerging area of research concerns the artifact nature\nof law, aiming to learn something about the nature of law from the\nfact that law seems to be an artifact, created and sustained by humans\nfor particular purposes. (See, for example, Burazin et al. eds., 2018.)\nOthers explore connections between law\u2019s features as artifact and\nfictionalism, suggesting that their underlying logic and metaphysics\nshare a great deal in common (Marmor 2018). Another new and\npotentially fruitful area of research focuses on applications of\nphilosophy of language to law, brining new developments in philosophy\nof language, particularly in pragmatics, to bear on questions of legal\ninterpretation and understanding of legal content (Asgeirsson\nforthcoming, Asgeirsson 2015, Marmor 2014). This linguistic direction\nis not uncontroversial, however; some legal philosophers express\nskepticism about the idea that legal content is determined by\nlinguistic factors (Greenberg 2011) and there is an ongoing debate\nabout these issues. Finally, there also seems to be a growing interest\nin recent developments in metaphysics that might bear on a theory\nabout the nature of law, and even debates about meta-metaphysics are\nbeginning to emerge in the context of general jurisprudence,\npurporting to show that ways in which we think about the tasks of\nmetaphysical inquiry may bear on ways we think about the law (Rosen\n2010). For example, if the main task of metaphysics is to determine\nwhat really exists in the world, irrespective of what we think about\nit or ways in which we represent the world, metaphysics may not have\nmuch to say about the nature of law or, perhaps, it may indicate that\nonly a scientific approach to jurisprudence can yield metaphysically\nrespectable results. If, however, the task of metaphysical inquiry is\nalso to figure out what is more foundational than something else,\ngiving us a hierarchical structure of the world, where some things\nground others, then metaphysics might be a very fruitful framework to\nwork with in trying to elucidate the foundations of legality and legal\nphenomena more generally. This potential metaphysical interest in\njurisprudence is at its infancy presently, and time will tell if this\nnew approach gets us interesting results.\n2. The Methodology of Jurisprudence\n\n\nWhen it comes to the methodology of jurisprudence, we find two main\nissues. While one is not directly concerned with normativity, the\nsecond is. The first asks about the aims and success criteria for\nphilosophical theories about the nature of law:\n\n\nWhat is the target that first-order theories of\nlaw aim to capture, and when do they succeed in doing so?\n\n\nThe second asks about the role of evaluation in jurisprudential\nmethodology:\n\n\nAre first-order legal theories inherently or\nnecessarily evaluative or can they be purely descriptive?\n\n\nEach of these questions will be discussed in turn.\n2.1 The Target of a Theory of Law\n\n\nThe first important class of methodological questions in\njurisprudence concerns the target of first-order theories of\nlaw\u2014that is, what phenomenon such theories aim to provide an\naccount of. In taking a stand on what the proper target of a\nfirst-order legal theory is, one incurs a number of other\nmethodological commitments. These include adopting a view about when\nsuch theories are successful, taking a stand on what sort of data such\ntheories aim to systematize and explain, and determining what sorts of\narguments are legitimately used in deciding between one of these\ntheories and its competitors.\n\n\nThere are five main families of views on this question. One view takes\njurisprudence to be a form of conceptual analysis, which is to say\nthat theories of law aim to provide an account of some concept of\nlaw. This approach is often associated with Hart\u2019s influential\nwork, The Concept of Law (1994). A second sort of view adopts\na more skeptical stance towards the methodology of conceptual analysis\nand takes theories of law to be in the business of offering a\nreductive explanation of law itself, not some concept of it. Another\nrecent view sees general jurisprudence as just another branch of\nmetanormative inquiry, which renders it continuous with other\nphilosophical fields like metaethics. Fourth, the prescriptive view\ntakes it that the aim of a theory of law is to specify the notion of\nlaw that it would be most desirable for us to adopt. A fifth kind of\nview, associated with Dworkin\u2019s work, takes it that legal\ntheories are in the business of offering a constructive interpretation\nof legal practice. In what follows, each of these five views, as well\nas some of the main issues they face, will be discussed in more\ndepth.\n2.1.1 Conceptual Analysis Views\n\n\nOn conceptual analysis views, theories of law aim to capture the\nconcept of law and they succeed to the extent that they provide a\ncoherent account of the relevant data about that concept and related\nconcepts. In particular, the data to be systematized are taken to be\npeople\u2019s intuitions involving some shared concept of law (or\ncognate concepts like legal validity or legal obligation). In their\nsimplest form, such intuitions can be thought of as judgments about\nwhether the relevant concept does or does not apply to particular\ncases. Accordingly, on this sort of view, a theory of law aims to\nprovide an account of the conditions under which the target concept of\nlaw (or one of its cognates) applies.\n \n\nWhat\u2019s more, such a theory can be arrived at by employing\nthe method of conceptual analysis, undertaken from the proverbial\narmchair. The idea is that the theorist starts with a putative set of\ncriteria for the correct application of the target concept, and then\nshe tests this account against her intuitions about that concept. If\nthe account entails that the concept applies to particular cases that\nit intuitively does not apply to, then this provides reason to reject\nor revise the account in question. By contrast, if the account entails\nthat the target concept applies to certain cases and this is the\nintuitively correct result, this tends to provide affirmative support\nfor the account. The account successfully captures the target concept\nto the extent that it yields intuitively correct results about\nparticular cases, and does so in an explanatorily satisfying way (as\nopposed to an ad hoc manner). (For a more in depth discussion of the\nmethodology of conceptual analysis as applied to the concept of law,\nsee Shapiro 2011, 16\u201322.)\n\n\nJurisprudence has been influenced by two main ways of understanding\nthe relevant intuitions (or data) that theories of law aim to\nsystematize. This, in turn, is due to the fact that one might\nunderstand concepts themselves, and our intuitions about them, in two\ndifferent ways. Accordingly, we find two main varieties of the\nconceptual analysis view of methodology.\n\n\nThe first understanding of concepts takes concept possession to be\nmainly a matter of linguistic competence. That is, to possess the\nconcept of law is to know when the word \u201claw\u201d as used in\nits juridical sense (not the scientific sense) applies. Thus,\nintuitions about the concept of law are to be understood as linguistic\nintuitions about how to use the word \u201claw.\u201d On the present\nview, then, conceptual analysis is a mode of linguistic analysis. This\nsort of view was famously discussed in chapters 1 and 2 of\nDworkin\u2019s Law\u2019s Empire (Dworkin 1986, 32,\n43\u201346). It arguably traces back to the kind of ordinary language\nphilosophy associated with J.L. Austin and Gilbert Ryle (Marmor 2013,\n210\u2013212).\n\n\nHowever, this understanding of concept possession has\ndrawbacks. Perhaps the biggest source of concern in the present\ncontext is that this sort of view fuels a version of Dworkin\u2019s\n\u201csemantic sting\u201d argument (Dworkin 1986, 43\u201346). The\nargument may be summarized as follows. Suppose legal theories aim to\ncapture the concept of law and that concept possession just is a\nmatter of knowing when the word \u201claw\u201d applies. If so, the\nargument runs, legal theories cannot explain disagreement about the\ngrounds of law, that is, about the conditions of legal validity. After\nall, if legal theories are in this way semantic in nature, then\ndisagreement about what the grounds of law are must boil down to\ndisagreement about when the word \u201claw\u201d applies\u2014at\nleast assuming the parties to the disagreement are not merely talking\npast one another. But now a dilemma arises. Either legal practitioners\npossess the same concept of law or they do not. If they do possess the\nsame concept, then it seems they cannot fail to agree about\nwhat it takes for a norm to count as law. After all, they all know\nwhen the word expressing their shared concept of law applies. But this\nis implausible, since legal practice in fact is rife with disagreement\nabout what the grounds of law are (and thus, what counts as law or as\nlegal). On the other hand, if legal practitioners do not\nshare the same concept of law, then their disagreement about what the\ngrounds of law are must just be due to the fact that they are talking\npast one another. But that, too, is implausible. Legal practice, as\nDworkin puts it, is not \u201ca grotesque joke\u201d (Dworkin 1986,\n44). Accordingly, there must be something wrong with construing legal\ntheories as mere semantic accounts of when the word \u201claw\u201d\napplies.\n\n\nIf, in light of this argument, we are to abandon the idea that\nfirst-order legal theories are semantic theories, there are two obvious\nways to proceed. First, one might simply abandon the idea that legal\ntheories are exercises in conceptual analysis. This was Dworkin\u2019s\npreferred response, though, as we\u2019ll see, one can reject\nconceptual analysis without adopting Dworkin\u2019s own favored\nmethodology. (More on that in sub-section 2.1.2.) Second, if one wants to\nstill say that legal theories are in the business of analyzing the\nconcept of law, then the obvious response to the semantic sting\nargument is to deny that concept possession just is a matter of knowing\nhow the word \u201claw\u201d in its juridical sense is to be applied.\nThis suggests a second, richer form of conceptual analysis that legal\ntheorists might be engaged in.\n\n\nThe basic idea behind the richer view is to take it that concept\npossession, rather than merely being a matter of knowing when words\napply, involves something meatier: namely, the possession of a wide\nrange of substantive beliefs or intuitions about the concept, its\nessential features and its proper application. The assumption is that\nthe intuitions one is disposed to have in virtue of possessing the\nconcept of law will be fertile enough to constitute a particular\nsubstantive conception of what the law is and how it functions. The aim\nof a theory of law, then, would be to systematize these pre-theoretic\njudgments about the concept of law in order to provide an account of\nsome substantive conception of law. (This sort of richer view of\nconcept possession is discussed, e.g., in Raz 2004, 4\u20137;\nStravopoulos 2012, 78\u201379; Shapiro 2011, 16\u201322. It is perhaps also the\nsort of view presupposed by Hart.) On this view, legal disagreement\nremains possible because while practitioners might all be using the\nsame concept of law, the richness of the concept allows that they\nnonetheless might not possess the concept determinately enough, or\nunderstand its application conditions thoroughly enough, to guarantee\nconsensus on theoretical questions about what the grounds of law\nactually are.\n\n\nHowever, also this richer understanding of concept possession, and the\nmeatier picture of conceptual analysis it gives rise to, has been\nwidely criticized (Marmor 2013, 215\u2013217; Raz 2004, 10; Leiter\n2007, 177\u201379). One question that immediately arises is\nwhich concept of law, exactly, constitutes the proper target\nof a theory of law. Is it the concept of law that is possessed by the\nlegal practitioners in a particular jurisdiction? Or is it some\nuniversally shared concept of law? Worries loom either way. If a legal\ntheory only aims to capture the concept of law employed in a\nparticular jurisdiction, then that would render the theory parochial\nand it might lose its interest for those who are not concerned with\nthat particular jurisdiction. On the other hand, one might doubt that\nthere really is a universally shared concept of law that is employed\nby practitioners in all jurisdictions\u2014or if there is one, it is\ndoubtful that it is anything more than the sort of thin concept that\none possesses in virtue of knowing what the word \u201claw\u201d in\nits juridical sense means.\n\n\nA deeper worry about all forms of conceptual analysis is the\nquestion of why we should care about anybody\u2019s concept\nof law in the first place (Marmor 2013, 216\u2013217; Leiter 2007, 177\u201379).\nAfter all, as philosophers, it seems that it is the nature of law\nitself that we care about understanding (Raz 2004, 7, 10).\nGranted, there are interesting sociological questions to be asked about\nwhat various groups of people believe to be the case about how law\nfunctions. But it is not obvious that there is anything distinctively\nphilosophical about such questions. Insofar as philosophers (qua\nphilosophers) are interested in what people believe about a given\nconcept, this would be because understanding people\u2019s beliefs\nabout the concept is a route to understanding that which it is a\nconcept of (Raz 2004, 4, 10). Accordingly, one might think\nthat what theories of law aim to capture is not anybody\u2019s concept\nof law in particular, but rather the nature of law itself. (See also\nthe entry\n on\n concepts, section 5.2.)\n\n \n\nA possible response to this objection is to assert that since law\nis a social phenomenon and is in part constituted by\npractitioners\u2019 own understanding of the practice they are\nengaged in, collecting evidence about the concept of law possessed by\nlegal practitioners is an especially useful way to investigate law\nitself (Stravopoulos 2012, 79). Still, one might wonder whether this\nroute to investigating the nature of law itself would be the most\neffective strategy to employ, given its indirectness. Why limit\nourselves to asking questions about concepts if law can be studied\ndirectly?\n\n\nA very different response would be to adopt a Platonist account of\nconcepts, according to which they are not mental representations at\nall, but rather abstract objects akin to the objects of mathematical\ninquiry. The concept of law, then, would be the abstract object one\nmust grasp in order to think about law. Accordingly, it is this\nabstract object\u2014the concept of law\u2014that\nphilosophers care about and aim to investigate using the method of\nconceptual analysis (cf. Bealer 1998). Nonetheless, this view\nof concepts faces familiar objections. For one, an account is needed of\nhow we can have access to the concept of law, conceived of as an\nindependently existing abstract object. Moreover, even if we can access\nit, a puzzle arises about how different people who all determinately\ngrasp the concept of law could possibly end up disagreeing\nabout its nature (Sarch 2010, 468\u201373). Finally, while it might be\nplausible that a priori disciplines like mathematics and logic\n aim to investigate abstract objects (see the entry on\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics),\n it is not\nclear that the investigation of a social phenomenon like the law, which\nis heavily dependent on human beliefs, attitudes and behavior, can be\nunderstood analogously. While mathematicians might be investigating the\nnature of abstract objects like numbers or sets, it seems more doubtful\nthat legal philosophers are investigating the abstract object\nlaw.\n2.1.2 Investigating Law Itself\n\n\nGiven the above doubts about conceptual analysis, several views have\nbeen suggested according to which first-order legal theories are\nprimarily in the business of describing and explaining the nature of\nlaw itself, not any concept of it. Reductionist and\nnaturalistic views fall into this category. (As noted below, such views\nneed not completely eschew the armchair methods just sketched, but to\nthe extent these methods remain viable, a very different explanation of\ntheir defensibility would have to be given.)\n\n\nIn particular, reductionist views take it that illuminating the\nnature of law is a matter of explaining what the law is, and how it\noperates, in terms of more foundational facts. As a result, first-order\ntheories of law succeed to the extent that they accomplish this in an\nexplanatorily powerful way (Marmor 2013). The goal of a first-order\ntheory, on this sort of view, is to offer a metaphysical\nreduction of law: that is, to show that the phenomenon of law is\nactually constituted by, and fully reducible to, some other more\nfoundational type of phenomenon (in the way that chemistry could in\nprinciple be reduced to particle physics). Thus construed, positivism,\nfor example, would seek to explain the nature of law by reducing facts\nabout what the law is, how it functions and what it requires, to more\nfoundational social facts\u2014e.g., about\npeople\u2019s behavior, beliefs and dispositions. By providing a\nreduction of this kind, a theory like positivism purports to illuminate\nthe phenomenon of law itself by breaking it down into its constituents\nand explaining how they together make up the complex social practice\nthat is the law. (For more on metaphysical reduction in general, see\n Schroeder 2007, 61\u201383; see also the entry on\n scientific reduction.)\n\n \n\nOne well-known type of reductionist view is naturalized\njurisprudence. Brian Leiter has been the most prominent defender of\nthis position (Leiter 2007). Like other reductionist views,\nnaturalized jurisprudence takes the aim of legal theories to be to\nexplain the nature of law itself (not anybody\u2019s concept of\nit). But what is characteristic of naturalized jurisprudence is that\nit also insists that a purely empirical methodology should be used in\n doing so (Leiter 2007, 180\u201381, 183\u201399). (See also the entry\n on\n naturalism in legal philosophy.)\n\n\n\nNaturalists might part company with adherents of other reductionist\nviews over whether or not the armchair methods of philosophers, and\nrelated appeals to intuitions, thought experiments and the like, are\nmisguided. The naturalist is likely to reject this mode of inquiry,\nwhile other reductionists may be more amenable to using it. A\nreductionist could in principle defend this sort of inquiry, for\ninstance, by claiming that our particular-case intuitions involve a\nconcept that we have acquired from experience with legal practice, and\nso such intuitions can be one useful source of information about the\nnature of law itself. Moreover, if legal practice (as a social\nphenomenon) is partially constituted by practitioners\u2019 own\nbeliefs and attitudes towards the practice they are engaged in, then\nevidence about legal practitioners\u2019 concept of law might prove\nespecially relevant as evidence about the law itself (Stravopoulos\n2012, 79).\n \n\nBy contrast, naturalists tend not to endorse the armchair method\nof testing theories of law against intuition, given their aim of\nmaking \u201cphilosophical theorizing continuous with and dependent\nupon scientific theorizing\u201d (Leiter 2007, 35). Leiter argues\nthat our intuitions about law are too unreliable to be afforded much\nepistemic weight (as others have argued with respect to intuitions in\nother areas of philosophy) (Leiter 2007, 180, 184; cf. Cummins\n1998). On Leiter\u2019s view, philosophers generally should aim to\nunpack the \u201cconcepts that have been vindicated by their role in\nsuccessful explanation and prediction of empirical phenomena\u201d\n(Leiter 2007, 184). Thus, he suggests a methodology that \u201ctak[es]\nseriously the\u2026social scientific literature on law\u2026to see\nwhat concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory and\npredictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial behavior\u201d\n(Leiter 2007, 184). This methodological view, however, raises\nquestions about why the legal philosopher should study only judicial\nbehavior and not something else. More generally, the naturalist owes\nan account of what features of law are most in need of explication and\nwhy.\n\n\nA different sort of concern that arises for reductionist views (and\nperhaps naturalistic views as well) is that it may pose particular\nproblems for positivism. Specifically, if law is a normative phenomenon\nthat gives rise to legal obligations, one might worry that it is not\npossible to reduce legal facts (i.e., facts about what our\nlegal obligations are) to a set of purely non-normative facts,\ne.g., social ones. One might think that this would\nimpermissibly transgress the familiar (though not uncontroversial)\nis-ought gap. (For a discussion of this sort of worry about positivism,\nsee Shapiro 2011, 47\u201349.)\n\n\nIn response, one route that positivists who want to be reductionists\ncould take is to maintain that legal facts really are descriptive in\nnature, not genuinely normative. In particular, such positivists might\nclaim that facts about what legal obligations we have simply are\ndescriptive facts about what the law holds that we ought to\ndo\u2014not normative facts about what we really ought to do (Shapiro\n2011, 188; see also Hart 1994, 110).\n2.1.3 The Metanormative Inquiry View\n\nAnother recent methodological view developed by Plunkett and Shapiro\n(2017) takes general jurisprudence to be just another branch of\nmetanormative inquiry. The latter kind of inquiry as a general matter\naims to explain how normative thought, talk, and entities (if any) fit\ninto reality. Metaethics is another branch of metanormative inquiry,\nwhich focuses on how ethical thought, talk and entities fit into\nreality. Thus, on the present view the subject of inquiry in general\njurisprudence would be legal thought, talk and entities (if\nany), and the aim of the field would be to explain how such thought\nand talk about law\u2014as well as legal structures and legal\nproperties (if any)\u2014are best accounted for in one\u2019s general\nphilosophical view of reality. On this view, jurisprudential inquiry\nwould be continuous with\u2014and methodologically quite\nsimilar\u2014to the work done in other areas of normative inquiry,\nespecially ethics and aesthetics.\n\n \nOne question that arises for this position, however, concerns the\nextent to which this is a distinct methodology from those discussed\nabove. If the focus of one\u2019s metanormative inquiry is legal thought\nand talk, we seem to get rather close to the conceptual analysis\npicture of how jurisprudence should proceed. On the other hand, if the\nfocus of inquiry emphasizes how legal entities or properties fit into\nreality in general, then the view ends up seeming rather close to the\nnaturalist position that the topic of jurisprudential inquiry is\nphenomenon of law itself. Nonetheless, perhaps a particular attraction\nof the metanormative view is that it can show how both the conceptual\nanalysis picture and the naturalist picture capture distinct pieces of\nthe bigger enterprise of the task that jurisprudence is engaged\nin. Thus, rather than purporting to replace the other methodologies\ndiscussed above, the metanormative view, if sound, would do away with\nthere being a privileged starting point for jurisprudential inquiry\n(such as metaphysics of legal content, the semantic analysis of legal\nstatements, or the nature of legal obligations).\n2.1.4 The Prescriptive View\n\n\nA different sort of approach to methodology in jurisprudence takes\nit that the proper aim of a legal theory is to specify a substantive\nconception of law that it would be especially desirable for\npeople to adopt. Moreover, even if the conception of law that this\ninquiry ends up supporting departs radically from our pre-theoretical\nunderstanding of law, then the resulting theory would recommend\nabandoning that prior understanding of law. Accordingly, if\njurisprudence is chiefly a prescriptive endeavor, then theories of law\nmight end up being radically revisionist in nature (though, of course,\nnot necessarily).\n\n\nAs explained in the next sub-section, Dworkin\u2019s methodological\nview incorporates some prescriptive elements. But one prominent\nadvocate of an exclusively prescriptive project is Neil MacCormick\n(MacCormick 1985; see also Campbell 1996; Murphy 2001; Postema 1989;\nSchauer 1996; Waldron 2001). MacCormick argues that there are\ncompelling normative arguments in favor of adopting a positivist\nconception of law. In particular, he suggests that values like\nautonomy and freedom of conscience demand that the law not regulate\nwith a heavy hand \u201cthe sphere of aspirational values, of duties\nof self-respect and of duties of love,\u201d a sphere that concerns\n\u201cquesting for the good beyond duty, or for the right lines of\ndevelopment of a self, or for the proper regard to bestow upon\none\u2019s family, friends or neighbors\u201d (MacCormick 1985,\n35\u201336). Values like autonomy and freedom of conscience,\nMcCormack thinks, support the claim that at least within this sphere\nof conduct, it is desirable to keep the question of what the law\nrequires entirely separate from the question of what morality\nrequires. (However, MacCormick also allows that the law properly can\nregulate the sphere of \u201cduties of justice,\u201d as these\nduties are in some sense weightier (MacCormick 1985, 35).)\nAccordingly, at least in some spheres of conduct, the question of what\nthe law is ought to be held distinct from the question of\nwhat morality requires. Thus, MacCormick seems to be offering a\nnormative argument for a claim that has often been associated with\npositivism, namely a version of the Separation Thesis. (Though, as\nseen earlier, it is not clear that all positivists must be committed\nto a strong version of this thesis.)\n\n\nWhile the question of what conception of law it is most desirable\nthat people adopt is surely a significant one, it is important to note\nthat the prescriptive view of methodology in jurisprudence is not\ngenuinely in competition with either the conceptual analysis view or\nthe reductionist approach. After all, it might turn out, for\nexample, that positivism provides the best account of our concept of\nlaw, or perhaps is the best reductive account of the phenomenon of law\nitself, even though there are compelling normative arguments for\nchanging the practice or adopting a new concept of it that, say,\ncomports with natural law theory. Accordingly, accounts of the concept\nof law, or reductive theories of law, are not necessarily inconsistent\nwith prescriptive accounts of what legal theory it would be most\ndesirable from the moral point of view to adopt.\n2.1.5 Constructive Interpretation of Legal Practice\n\n\nA final methodological view, which deserves separate treatment both\nbecause of its influence and sophistication, is Dworkin\u2019s\n(Dworkin 1986). This view takes it that (i) the target of a first-order\ntheory of law is existing legal practice and (ii) these\ntheories succeed to the extent that they offer a defensible\nconstructive interpretation (in Dworkin\u2019s sense) of that\npractice. According to the constructive interpretation view, the aim\nof a first-order theory of law is not to analyze any concept or to\nreduce legal facts to other more foundational facts. Rather, the aim\nof a legal theory is to reconstruct the behavior and\nself-understandings of participants in legal practice and, moreover,\nto do so in a way that casts this practice in its best moral light. As\na result, a theory of law is more successful the better it both fits\nwith the data about how legal practitioners understand the practice\nthey are engaged in, while also normatively justifying that\npractice (Dworkin 1986; Perry 1995, 129\u201331; see also the entry\n on\n legal interpretivism).\n\n\n\nOne concern about the constructive interpretation view of\nmethodology in jurisprudence is that it may not be in genuine\ncompetition with either the conceptual analysis or reductive views of\nmethodology. After all, one sort of project is to explain what law\nactually is and how it operates (perhaps according to our concept of\nit). But it is a very different sort of project to explain how we\nshould conceive of the law in order for legal practice to be\nnormatively justified. It seems possible that our account of what law\nactually is tells us one thing (e.g., that certain features of\nit are essential and others not), while our account of what law should\nbe like in order for the practice to be as justified as possible tells\nus to think of law in a rather different way (e.g., as having\ndifferent essential features). Accordingly, some have argued that the\nconstructive interpretation view engages with the other methodological\nviews mentioned above only if it denies what they assert: viz.,\nthat legal theories attempt to provide an explanation (perhaps of some\nparticular kind\u2014e.g., reductive) of the actual nature of\nlaw (or perhaps our concept of it).\n\n\nOne way that adherents of the constructive interpretation view might\ndeny what certain other methodological views assert is by denying that\nit is even possible to give a reductive explanation of law.\n(For discussion, see Marmor 2013, 218.) The thought would be to claim that law is a\nnormative practice, and normative facts cannot be reduced to purely\nnon-normative facts without losing something essential. In response,\nthe reductionist might either deny that legal facts are genuinely\nnormative (in which case the sought-after reduction would be\nunproblematic), or she might assert that any successful reduction will\nhave to reduce legal facts to a set of facts that includes\nnormative facts (in which case a version of natural law theory might\nappear attractive).\n2.2 Is Legal Theory Inherently Evaluative?\n\n\nA second widely-discussed question about jurisprudential methodology\nis whether first-order legal theories are inherently evaluative. The\nabove views about the proper target of first-order theories of law have\ndifferent implications about this second question. But before\nexplaining that, we must first get the relevant question more clearly\nin view.\n2.2.1 Preliminaries\n\n\nTo begin with, one might wonder where the interest in the question\nof whether legal theory is inherently evaluative comes from. Some of\nthis interest likely traces to the skeptical worry that legal theories\npurporting to be purely descriptive in fact are pushing some hidden\nideological or political agenda. (For more on this, see, e.g.,\nJohn Gardner\u2019s introduction to Dickson 2004.) A second source of\nthe interest in this question may be the suspicion (or hope) that if\nlegal theory proves to be inherently evaluative, that would be an\nindependent reason to adopt some version of natural law theory. Whether\nthis is so remains doubtful, however, since meta-questions about the\nmethodology of legal theory prima facie seem to be independent\nof questions in first-order legal theory like what the determinants of\nthe content of law are. What is more, legal scholars might be drawn to\nthe present issue through consideration of Dworkin\u2019s argument\nthat there is a very tight connection between the evaluative nature of\ntheorizing about the law and the evaluative nature of law itself,\nrendering the content of law inevitably dependent, at least in part, on\nmoral-political considerations. Regardless of the motivations for\nengaging in the debate about whether legal theory is inherently\nevaluative, however, this debate has taken on independent significance\nand has been a fruitful source of insight in its own right.\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, the question we are concerned with here must be\nclarified in several ways. For there are a number of\nuncontroversial ways in which legal theory plausibly is or\nmight be evaluative, and these do not go to the heart of the\nmethodological debates in jurisprudence.\n\n\nFirst, there are several trivial ways in which legal theory, like\ntheories about any topic, plausibly cannot be entirely\nvalue-free. In particular, it seems that one cannot engage in the\nbusiness of theorizing about law without evaluating the extent to which\nvarious theories are coherent, simple, clear, elegant, comprehensive,\nand so on (Dickson 2004, 32\u201333). Granted this means that legal\ntheorists must engage in a form of evaluation. But there is nothing\nspecial about legal theory in this regard. After all, these\nmeta-theoretical virtues are criteria for the success of theories about\nany subject matter.\n \n\nA second seemingly uncontroversial way in which legal theory is\nevaluative is that one cannot begin to develop a theory of law without\ndetermining which of its central features are to be accounted for\n(Dickson 2001, 38\u201345). John Finnis, for example, argues that one\ncannot do first-order legal theory without taking a stand on what the\nimportant features of law are that adequate theories must explain\n(e.g., the law\u2019s claim to authority). However, this seems to\nrequire evaluation (Finnis 1980, 9\u201315).\n\n\nNonetheless, it is not likely to be especially controversial that\nlegal theory is evaluative in this way. To see why, distinguish\nbetween (a) thick evaluative claims, which predicate some\nkind of moral goodness, or perhaps all-things-considered value, of an\nitem and (b) thin evaluative claims, which do not. (This\ndistinction roughly tracks Julie Dickson\u2019s distinction between\ndirectly evaluative propositions and indirectly evaluative\npropositions. See Dickson 2001, 51\u201355.) Thus, the simplest thick\nevaluative claims have the form: \\(X\\) is morally\n[all-things-considered] good [bad]. Such claims might also be\ncomparative in nature, such that they have the form: \\(X\\) is\nmorally [all-things-considered] better [worse] than \\(Y\\). By\ncontrast, thin evaluative claims judge how well some item fares\nrelative to a standard that is neither moral nor all-things-considered\nnormative. Such claims do not entail any thick evaluative claims\neither. Examples of thin evaluative claims thus would include\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d and \u201c\\(X\\) is\ninteresting\u201d. Accordingly, even if legal theorists must make\nthin evaluative claims in order to be able to begin the project of\ndeveloping a first-order legal theory, this does not mean that they\nmust make thick evaluative claims in order to do so. After all, one\nmight construct a theory that captures a range of legal phenomena that\nare deemed central or important, while still remaining agnostic about\nwhether these phenomena are themselves valuable.\n\n\nA third way in which legal theory could in principle be evaluative,\nthough uncontroversially so, is suggested by the prescriptive view\ndiscussed in section 2.1.3. If the job of a first-order theory of law is\nto identify the concept of law it would be most desirable for us to\nemploy, then there is a sense in which the resulting theory of law\nwould of course be evaluative. Nonetheless, as seen above, prescriptive\ntheories aim to answer a different question from theories in the\nconceptual analysis, reductive or interpretive categories. Thus, what\nmatters to the debate about whether legal theory is evaluative is not\nwhether legal theory in principle could be evaluative, but whether it\nis inevitably or necessarily so.\n\n\nNow we are in a position to fully appreciate the question of primary\ninterest here. In particular, it is whether theories about the nature\nof existing legal practice (or perhaps our concept of it) necessarily\ninvolve or entail thick evaluative claims about the law. That\nis, does offering a first-order theory of law of either the conceptual\nanalysis, reductive or constructive interpretation varieties require\none to accept claims about how valuable the law, or some feature of it,\nis? This is the question to be discussed in the remainder of this\nentry.\n2.2.2 Is Legal Theory Evaluative in the Relevant Sense?\n\n\nSome answers to the question that was discussed in section 2.1 suggest that\ntheories of law are inherently evaluative in the sense of committing\nadvocates of these theories to thick evaluative claims about the law.\nAs we will see, this is most plausibly the case on the constructive\ninterpretation view of methodology. By contrast, other answers to the\nquestion discussed in section 2.1 do not obviously entail that\nfirst-order legal theories commit their proponents to thick evaluative\nclaims. In particular, this is the case for the conceptual analysis and\nreductive views of jurisprudential methodology. At least on their face,\nboth these views seem to allow that there can be purely descriptive\naccounts of law\u2014i.e., accounts that capture the central\nfeatures of law without being committed to any moral or\nall-things-considered evaluation of the law. After all, one might think\nthat a particular account does a good job of capturing some widely\nshared concept of law, but this does not obviously commit one to saying\nthat law, on this concept of it, is good. Likewise, one might\nendorse a reduction of legal facts to some more foundational set of\nfacts (e.g., certain social facts) without this committing one\nto thinking that the law is valuable or morally justified.\n\n\nAs a result, at least on their face, both the conceptual analysis\nand reductive views seem to allow that there can be first-order\ntheories of law that are purely descriptive. Some argument would be\nneeded if one is to endorse the opposite conclusion. Accordingly, let\nus consider some prominent arguments for thinking that legal theory\nmust be inherently evaluative in nature. (For an overview, see Marmor\n2011, 122\u201335.)\nThe argument from legal functions\n\n\nOne central argument to the effect that legal theory must be\nevaluative in the relevant sense begins from the idea that\nunderstanding what the law is requires taking a view about\nwhat functions it serves (Finnis 1980, 12\u201317; Perry 1995,\n114\u201320).  Moreover, one might think that functions are\nevaluative in the sense that attributing a function to something is to\nendorse a standard by which that thing may be judged as successful or\nunsuccessful. In this way, one might think that legal theory, too, is\ninherently evaluative.\n\n\nWhile this line of thinking plausibly shows that legal theory requires\naccepting some evaluative claims, it does not obviously show that\nlegal theory necessarily involves thick evaluative claims\n(Dickson 2001, 114\u2013125). Claims of the form \u201cthe function\nof \\(X\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d are naturally classified together with\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d (or more precisely, \u201c\\(X\\) is\nimportant for some purpose \\(Y\\)\u201d) as thin evaluative\nclaims. Accordingly, asserting that the function of law is \\(F\\) does\nnot obviously entail any thick evaluative claims about law. After all,\nit is not obvious why attributing a function to something requires\nbelieving that performing that function is either\nall-things-considered or morally good.  Thus, attributing a\nfunction to law need not entail any thick evaluative claims.\nThe argument from the internal point of view\n\n\nA second natural argument in favor of seeing legal theory as\ninherently evaluative in the relevant sense relies on the idea that any\nadequate theory of law must take account of the internal point of view\nthat legal practitioners tend to adopt towards the law. More\nspecifically, taking the internal point of view towards the law is a\nmatter of adopting some kind of attitude of endorsement towards it,\nseeing it as in some sense justified or as providing reasons for\naction (Shapiro 2011, 96\u201397; Perry 1995, 99\u2013100;\n see also the entry on \n legal positivism).\n Moreover, it is common to think that a critical mass of the\nparticipants in legal practice must adopt the internal point of view\ntowards the practice in order for the practice to genuinely count as\nlaw. This is a fact that any adequate theory of law must account for,\none might think. Accordingly, since the internal point of view involves\na positive evaluation of the law, and since any adequate legal theory\nmust account for this point of view, one might infer that any adequate\ntheory of law must itself be inherently evaluative. (One finds versions\nof such an argument, e.g., in Perry 1995, 121\u201325; Waldron\n2001, 423\u201328.)\n\n\nIt is unclear whether this argument succeeds, however. After all, it\nseems in principle possible to explain what kinds of considerations\nlegal practitioners endorse, and why, without oneself\nendorsing those considerations. Similarly, a first-order legal theory\nmight be able to plausibly explain the truism that legal practitioners\ntend to take the internal point of view towards (i.e., endorse)\nthe law in their respective jurisdictions without the theory thereby\nbeing committed to the claim that the law in any particular\njurisdiction (or the law in general) is valuable or justified.\nAccordingly, it is not obvious why a theory of law cannot in principle\ncapture the internal point of view taken by legal practitioners towards\nthe law without itself being committed to any thick evaluative claims\nabout the law.\nThe argument from interpretation\n\n\nProbably the most influential argument for thinking that legal theory\nis inherently evaluative proceeds from the idea that legal theory is\nan interpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense (Dworkin 1986; for\ncriticism, see Dickson 2001, 105; Marmor 2011, 126\u201330). To say\nthat legal theory is an interpretive project is to claim that fully\nunderstanding what the law is requires construing it as the\nbest instance it can be of the type of thing that it is. Moreover, one\nmight think that in order to construe legal practice as the best\ninstance of the kind of thing that it is requires making thick\nevaluative claims about the law. (See the entry\n on\n legal interpretivism.)\n\n\n\nOne might attempt to respond to this argument in two ways. A\nnatural, though ultimately unsuccessful, reply is that construing\nsomething as the best instance of its kind that it can be does not\nrequire taking that kind to be good. Saying that Bernie Madoff\nwas (for a time) the best fraudster in history does not entail that one\napproves of fraud. As a result, saying that the law must be thus-and-so\nin order to be a good instance of its kind does not commit one to any\nthick evaluative claims. Nonetheless, there is a deeper or more\ninteresting sense in which Dworkin\u2019s view renders legal theory\ninherently evaluative. For Dworkin, legal theory is an interpretive\nenterprise, and offering a constructive interpretation of legal\npractice requires construing it in its best moral light. Thus,\noffering an interpretation of legal practice would require taking a\nstand on which of the available ways of construing that practice is\nmorally better than the others. Of course, this does not necessarily\nrequire asserting that the law, on any particular construal, is\ngood\u2014full stop. But it does seem to require at least\nsaying that some construals of legal practice are morally\nbetter than other construals would be. This looks to be a\nthick evaluative claim, albeit a comparative one. Moreover, one cannot\nmake such comparative judgments without having a view about what would\nmake one construal of legal practice morally better than another. Thus,\nin at least this sense, taking legal theory to be an endeavor that is\ninterpretive in Dworkin\u2019s sense would make legal theory count as\ninherently evaluative in the sense we are concerned with here.\n\n\nAccordingly, if one wants to maintain the possibility of purely\ndescriptive first-order legal theories, a more promising strategy for\nresponding to the argument from interpretation would be to question its\nkey premise\u2014viz., that legal theory necessarily is an\ninterpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense. In order for a\nproponent of the argument from interpretation to assert this premise,\nsome rationale would have to be given for it. That is, some argument\nwould be needed to explain why we should think that\nunderstanding law requires giving a constructive\ninterpretation of it. A critic of the argument from interpretation,\nthen, might claim that the argument\u2019s proponents have not carried\ntheir burden of providing a rationale for this premise, on which the\nargument crucially depends.\n\n\nOne possible rationale that might be offered here is that since\nsocial practices essentially involve communication, and understanding\nany form of communication necessarily involves interpreting\nspeakers\u2019 claims, understanding the social practice of law\nnecessarily involves interpreting it. However, this rationale is too\nquick. Even if it is true that understanding any social practice\nrequires interpretation of some kind or other, it does not\nfollow that doing so requires a constructive interpretation in\nDworkin\u2019s sense\u2014i.e., identifying a construal\nof the practice that casts it in its best moral light (Marmor 2011,\n127\u201328). But the latter claim, of course, is what proponents of the\nargument from interpretation need to establish in order to reach their\ndesired conclusion that legal theory is inherently evaluative.\n\n\nAccordingly, we seem to be left in the following dialectical\nsituation. Whether or not legal theory is inherently evaluative in the\nrelevant sense depends on whether the argument from interpretation\nsucceeds. Whether that argument succeeds, in turn, depends on its key\npremise, i.e., the claim that understanding the law necessarily\nrequires giving a constructive interpretation of it. If a\nnon-question begging argument can be given for this claim, then there\nwould be reason to think that legal theory necessarily is evaluative in\nnature. By contrast, if no non-question begging argument can be given\nfor thinking that understanding law requires a constructive\ninterpretation, then one would be free to maintain that there can be\npurely descriptive first-order legal theories.\n\n\nOf course, even if the argument from interpretation fails and purely\ndescriptive legal theories remain possible, it could still be\na worthwhile project to attempt to give a constructive interpretation\nof legal practice, and the output of this project would indeed be a\npartially evaluative theory. Nonetheless, these two types of theory\nwould not genuinely be in conflict, as they would be addressed to\nanswering different questions. In the end, therefore,\n\u201cmethodological pluralism\u201d may be the most apt\ncharacterization of the state of play in jurisprudence.\n",
