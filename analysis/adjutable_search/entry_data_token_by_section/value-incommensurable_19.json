    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Risky Actions\n5. Social Choices and Institutions \n\nAs discussed above, social practices and institutions play a role in\nthe inquiry into value incommensurability and incomparability. They\nare claimed by some philosophers to ground the possibility of these\nphenomena as in the case of constitutive incommensurability\n(subsection 3.2), and to help resolve value conflicts, as in the case\nof providing external resources for practical reason (subsection 4.4).\nThis section discusses additional areas in which considerations about\nsocial institutions intersect with the inquiry at hand.\n\nTo begin, some philosophers have pointed to a structural similarity\nbetween a single individual trying to choose in the face of\nincomparability and the process of incorporating the varied interests\nand preferences of the members of society into a single decision. The\npreferences of different individuals, for example, may be taken to\nreflect differing evaluative judgments about alternatives so that\ncombining these different preferences into a single decision becomes\nanalogous to resolving value conflicts in the individual case. Given\nthis analogy, Fred D\u2019Agostino has applied methods of\ndecision-making at the social level from social choice theory and\npolitical theory to consider the resolution of value conflicts at the\nindividual level (2003).\n\nAt the same time, Richard Pildes and Elizabeth Anderson caution\nagainst wholeheartedly adopting this analogy. The analogy, according\nto them, assumes that individuals already have rationally ordered\npreferences. Given incomparability, however, there is no reason to\nmake such an assumption. In turn, Pildes and Anderson argue that\n\u201cindividuals need to participate actively in democratic\ninstitutions to enable them to achieve a rational ordering of their\npreferences for collective choices\u201d (1990, 2177).\n\nValue incommensurability and incomparability also have been considered\nwith respect to the law. Matthew Adler discusses the variety of ways\nin which legal scholars have engaged the topic of value\nincommensurability (1998). One question is whether the possibility of\nvalue incommensurability poses a problem for evaluating government\npolicy options and laws, more generally. Some authors respond that it\ndoes not. Cass Sunstein, for example, argues that recognition of value\nincommensurability helps \u201cto reveal what is at stake in many\nareas of the law\u201d (1994, 780). According to Sunstein, important\ncommitments of a well-functioning legal system are reflected in\nrecognizing value incommensurability.\n\nMore generally, a number of scholars have focused on the relation\nbetween incomparability and the structure of social and political\ninstitutions. John Finnis, for example, takes the open-endedness of\nsocial life to render it impossible to treat legal or policy choices\nas involving comparable alternatives (1997, 221\u2013222). Michael\nWalzer\u2019s account of distributive justice also relates\nincomparability to the structure of social and political institutions.\nAccording to Walzer (1983), different social goods occupy different\n\u201cspheres,\u201d each one governed by a distinct set of\ndistributive norms. What is unjust is to convert the accumulation of\ngoods in one sphere into the accumulation of goods in another sphere\nwithout regard for that second sphere\u2019s distributive norms.\nUnderlying Walzer\u2019s account, it seems, is a commitment to a kind\nof constitutive incommensurability. Given its connection to the\npossibility of plural and incompatible ways of life, the concepts of\nvalue incommensurability and incomparability also play a role in many\naccounts of political liberalism, including Joseph Raz\u2019s account\n(1986) and Isaiah Berlin\u2019s account (1969). The latter\u2019s\ninquiry into the relation between incommensurable values and political\ninstitutions motivated much of the further inquiry into the topic.\n",
