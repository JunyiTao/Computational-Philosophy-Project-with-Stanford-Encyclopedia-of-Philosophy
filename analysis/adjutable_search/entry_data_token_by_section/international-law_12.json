    "main_text": "Legitimacy || The Principle of Salience\n4.4 The Principle of Salience\n\nAn alternative way of dealing with the legitimacy of international\nlaw, given the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms, is offered\nby Ronald Dworkin (2013). For Dworkin, legitimacy concerns not only a\nmoral obligation of obedience, but one that is reliably\nenforceable through the courts. Given the absence of any\ninternational court with compulsory jurisdiction and reliable\nenforcement mechanisms, it could be argued that on this interpretation\nof legitimacy the question of international law\u2019s legitimacy\nsimply does not arise. As we noted previously (2.1), Dworkin avoids\nthis sceptical conclusion by proceeding on the \u201cfantasy\u201d\nthat such a court exists, that cases can be readily brought before it,\nand that there are effective sanctions to enforce its rulings. Dworkin\nclaims we can discern the binding requirements of international law by\nasking:\n\n\nWhat tests or arguments should that hypothetical court adopt to\ndetermine the rights and obligations of states (and other\ninternational actors and organizations) that it would be\nappropriate for it to enforce coercively? (Dworkin 2013:\n14)\n\n\nTwo more general obligations are then appealed to by Dworkin in\nanswering this question.\n\nThe first is a general obligation incumbent upon all states to\nundertake steps that enhance their own political legitimacy, as well\nas of the international legal order in which states operate. Such\nsteps include\n\nupholding human rights at home and abroad;\nguaranteeing the assistance of the international community against\ninvasion and other external threats to a state\u2019s\nindependence;\nencouraging international cooperation; and\nenabling people to have some role in their own government (Dworkin\n2013: 18).\n\n\nBut this obligation of mitigation suffers from considerable\nindeterminacy, given the existence of reasonable disagreement about\nthe best way to improve the legitimacy of the existing international\nlegal order. As a remedy, Dworkin invokes a second basic obligation on\nstates, the principle of salience:\n\n\nIf a significant number of states, encompassing a significant\npopulation, has developed an agreed code of practice, either by treaty\nor by other form of coordination, then other states have at least a\nprima facie duty to subscribe to that practice as well, with the\nimportant proviso that this duty holds only if a more general practice\nto that effect, expanded in that way, would improve the legitimacy of\nthe subscribing state and the international order as a whole. (Dworkin\n2013: 19)\n\n\nThe result is that a state will be \u201cprima facie\u201d bound to\ncomply with an emerging consensus, of the kind described, if doing so\nwill enhance its legitimacy, and it will enhance its legitimacy if\ncompliance would help ameliorate some of the four problems of the\nstate system identified above. Applying this principle, Dworkin\nbelieves that the basic elements of the UN system, including the UN\nCharter, the Geneva Conventions, the conventions on genocide, and the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court, have acquired\nsalience of this kind, such that all states now have an obligation to\nobey them as law, irrespective of whether they have consented to them\n(Dworkin 2013: 20).\n\nDworkin\u2019s resort to fantasy, however, raises questions. Critics\nof a Razian persuasion will claim that an appeal to a fantasy court is\nnecessitated only by Dworkin\u2019s adoption of an unduly restrictive\nconception of legitimacy centred on the judicial enforcement of law.\nBut the essence of legitimate authority is the existence of a\ncontent-independent obligation of obedience, not the subsidiary\nquestion of whether it is properly enforceable, let alone enforceable\nthrough the courts. Another difficulty is that it seems problematic to\nderive obligations to obey international law here and now on the basis\nof a fantasy scenario that bears little relation to any existing, or\nreasonably foreseeable, reality. For example, why should the fact that\nthere is plausibly an obligation to obey the International Criminal\nCourt in a hypothetical world in which it operates impartially and\neffectively tell us anything much about states\u2019 obligations in\nthe current world in which its impartiality and effectiveness are\nmatters of heated controversy? At a more methodological level, many\nwill baulk at Dworkin\u2019s tendency to run together the question of\nthe existence of international law with that of its legitimacy, since\nthey would reject his thesis that law is of its nature presumptively\nlegitimate (Tasioulas 2021). For some other treatments of the\nlegitimacy of international law, see Besson, Christiano, and Pettit in\nBesson and Tasioulas (2010); also regarding particular institutions,\nsuch as courts F\u00f8llesdal 1998)).\n",
