In the modern period motivations for\ndistinguishing the latter relations become increasingly salient.\n\nOne motivation stems from Leibniz\u2019s observation that a\nconjunctive treatment of the genus-species relation does not fix a\ndirection of specification, since one can as easily take the\ndifferentia to be the genus, as vice versa (see Nouveaux\nEssais, III, iii, 10, Langley\u2019s translation, 313). Johnson\n(1924) interprets Descartes and Spinoza as attempting to ensure\nasymmetry by means of attributes and modes (see Descartes,\nPrinciples of Philosophy I.53; Spinoza, Ethics 1p8s1\nand Ep. 50), which Johnson suggests are \u201calmost\nequivalent\u201d to the notions of determinable and determinate:\n\n\nWhat I call a determinable is almost equivalent to what they call an\nattribute, and my determinate almost equivalent to their mode of an\nattribute. (1924: III, v. 1)\n\n\nPrior (1949) similarly sees Spinoza as aiming to ensure asymmetry by\nmeans of something like determination:\n\n\nIf Leibniz brought consistency into the medieval view of the\ndistinctness of genus and differentia by making the relation between\nthem symmetrical, Spinoza brought consistency into the medieval view\nof the asymmetry of the relation between them by denying their\ndistinctness. Spinoza\u2019s \u201cmodes\u201d are not new\nqualities added to his \u201cattributes\u201d, or qualities formed\nby the addition of something else to them, but determinations of them.\n(1949: 7)\n\n\nPrior also sees Locke as relying on the distinctive incompatibility of\nsame-level determinates as making sense of why \u201cany subject may\nhave of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at\nonce\u201d, and similarly for \u201call sensible ideas peculiar to\neach sense\u201d (Locke, Essay, IV iii 5).\n\nIn the work of Locke and other empiricists, we also see precursors of\ncertain contemporary anti-realist or reductivist accounts on which\ndeterminable attributions either indeterminately refer to determinate\nproperties (as Berkeley [1710] suggests, more generally, for\n\u2018abstract\u2019 terms), or on which determinable attributions\nare (merely) ways of classifying determinates. Prior\u2019s\ndescription of Locke\u2019s view might be seen as compatible with\neither approach:\n\n\nThough we speak of an object as colored, what is there being referred\nto is not really a quality of the object but a quality of one of its\nqualities; what is meant is that one of its qualities belongs to the\nclass \u201ccolors\u201d.
