    "main_text": "Virtue-Theoretic Approaches || The \u201cAAA\u201d Evaluations\n10.1 The \u201cAAA\u201d Evaluations\n\nSosa has often (e.g., Sosa 2007: ch. 2) made use of an analogy of a\nskilled archer shooting at a target; we may find it instructive as\nwell. Here are two ways in which an archer\u2019s shot might be\nevaluated:\n\nWas the shot successful? Did it hit its target?\nDid the shot\u2019s execution manifest the\narcher\u2019s skill? Was it produced in a way that makes it likely to\nsucceed?\n\n\nThe kind of success at issue in (1), Sosa calls accuracy. The\nkind of skill discussed in (2), Sosa calls adroitness. A shot\nis adroit if it is produced skillfully. Adroit shots needn\u2019t be\naccurate, as not all skilled shots succeed. And accurate shots\nneedn\u2019t be adroit, as some unskilled shots are lucky.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and adroitness, Sosa suggests that there is\nanother respect in which a shot may be evaluated, relating the two.\nThis, Sosa calls aptness.\n\nDid the shot\u2019s success manifest the archer\u2019s\nskill?\n\n\nA shot is apt if it is accurate because adroit. Aptness\nentails, but requires more than, the conjunction of accuracy and\nadroitness, for a shot might be both successful and skillful without\nbeing apt. For example, if a skillful shot is diverted by an\nunexpected gust of wind, then redirected towards the target by a\nsecond lucky gust, its ultimate accuracy does not manifest the skill,\nbut rather reflects the lucky coincidence of the wind.\n\nSosa suggests that this \u201cAAA\u201d model of evaluation is\napplicable quite generally for the evaluation of any action or object\nwith a characteristic aim. In particular, it is applicable to belief\nwith respect to its aim at truth:\n\nA belief is accurate if and only if it is true.\nA belief is adroit if and only if it is produced\n skillfully.[32]\nA belief is apt if and only if it is true in a way\nmanifesting, or attributable to, the believer\u2019s skill.\n\n\nSosa identifies knowledge with apt belief, so\n understood.[33]\n Knowledge entails both truth (accuracy) and justification\n(adroitness), on this view, but they are not merely independent\ncomponents out of which knowledge is truth-functionally composed. It\nrequires that the skill explain the success. This is in some respects\nsimilar to the anti-luck condition we have examined above, in that it\nlegislates that the relation between justification and truth be no\nmere coincidence. However, insofar as Sosa\u2019s \u201cAAA\u201d\nmodel is generally applicable in a way going beyond epistemology,\nthere are perhaps better prospects for understanding the relevant\nnotion of aptness in a way independent of understanding knowledge\nitself than we found for the notion of epistemic luck.\n",
