    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || The Relationship Between Theory and Experiment\n2.3 The Relationship Between Theory and Experiment\n\nThe constructive empiricist argues that constructive empiricism\n\u201cmakes better sense of science, and of scientific activity, than\nrealism does\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 73). The constructive\nempiricist can be understood as giving two arguments for this claim;\nthe first argument will be presented here, and the second argument\nwill be presented in the next subsection.\n\nConstructive empiricists might maintain that, for working scientists,\nthe real importance of scientific theories is that they are a factor\nin experimental design. They contrast this with the traditional\npicture presented by philosophy of science. According to the\ntraditional picture, the main goal of scientific practice is to\ndiscern the fundamental structure of the world, and experimentation\nsimply is used to determine whether theories should be taken to be\ntrue, and hence as contributing to our knowledge of the fundamental\nstructure. The constructive empiricist, in contrast, suggests that the\nreason a scientist turns to a theory is that experimental design is\ndifficult, and theories are needed to guide experimental inquiry. But\nwhat scientists are really aiming to discover, according to the\nconstructive empiricist, are \u201cfacts about the world\u2014about\nthe regularities in the observable part of the world\u201d (van\nFraassen 1980, 73).\n\nVan Fraassen argues for this position in part by describing\nMillikan\u2019s famous experiment measuring the charge of the\nelectron. Scientific realists take this experiment to be making a\ndiscovery about the nature of the unobservable entities known as\nelectrons. Van Fraassen, in contrast, presents the experiment as\n\u201cfilling in a value for a quantity which, in the construction of\nthe theory, was so far left open\u201d (1980, 77). In doing the\nexperiment, Millikan was discovering a regularity in the observable\npart of the world, and was providing a value for a quantity in atomic\ntheory. Millikan need not be understood as discovering something about\nthe nature of unobservable objects in the world. Van Fraassen says\nthat in a case like Millikan\u2019s,\n\nexperimentation is the continuation of theory construction by\nother means. The appropriateness of the means follows from the\nfact that the aim is empirical adequacy. (1980, 77)\n\n",
