    "main_text": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon (1561\u20131626) was one of the leading figures in\nnatural philosophy and in the field of scientific methodology in the\nperiod of transition from the Renaissance to the early modern era. As a\nlawyer, member of Parliament, and Queen's Counsel, Bacon wrote on\nquestions of law, state and religion, as well as on contemporary\npolitics; but he also published texts in which he speculated on\npossible conceptions of society, and he pondered questions of ethics\n(Essays) even in his works on natural philosophy (The\nAdvancement of Learning).\n\n\nAfter his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge and Gray's\nInn, London, Bacon did not take up a post at a university, but instead\ntried to start a political career. Although his efforts were not\ncrowned with success during the era of Queen Elizabeth, under James I\nhe rose to the highest political office, Lord Chancellor. Bacon's\ninternational fame and influence spread during his last years, when he\nwas able to focus his energies exclusively on his philosophical work,\nand even more so after his death, when English scientists of the Boyle\ncircle (Invisible College) took up his idea of a cooperative\nresearch institution in their plans and preparations for establishing\nthe Royal Society.\n\n\nTo the present day Bacon is well known for his treatises on\nempiricist natural philosophy (The Advancement of Learning,\nNovum Organum Scientiarum) and for his doctrine of the idols,\nwhich he put forward in his early writings, as well as for the idea of\na modern research institute, which he described in Nova\nAtlantis.\n",
