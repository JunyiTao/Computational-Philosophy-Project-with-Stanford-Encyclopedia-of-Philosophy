    "main_text": "Sin as Action || Sin as Action, the Problem of Evil, and O Felix Culpa\n2.2 Sin as Action, the Problem of Evil, and O Felix Culpa\n\nAs mentioned above, acts of sin relate closely to those versions of\nthe problem of evil that focus on moral evils, where one tries to\nexplain free creatures doing what is wrong. It is common in these\ndiscussions to differentiate a defense from a theodicy. Alvin\nPlantinga describes a theodicy as \u201cthe attempt to specify\nGod\u2019s reason for permitting evil\u201d, while a defense is the\nattempt to specify not what God\u2019s reason is but what it\n\u201cmight possibly be\u201d (Plantinga 1977: 27f; see\nalso van Inwagen 2006). Versions of free will theodicy argue that the\nexistence of free will is the good that justifies God\u2019s\npermitting evil, while free will defenses argue that the existence of\nfree will might be such a reason. Both free will theodicies\nand defenses typically presuppose libertarian understandings of free\nwill, and thus the possibility of moral evil, although they need not\n(see, for instance, Almeida 2016 and Turner 2013). Given the focus\nhere on sin, one particular response to the problem of moral evil is\nworth extended attention: a response known as \u201cO Felix\nCulpa\u201d, according to which God not only allows but even\ndesires evil insofar as it furthers his plans.\n\nWhile John Hick (1966) and Paul Helm (1994) both discuss O Felix\nCulpa theodicies, Alvin Plantinga\u2019s work has been\nespecially influential in contemporary philosophical discussions, and\nso I will focus on Plantinga. In earlier work (see Plantinga 1977 and\n1985), Plantinga was interested in only giving a defense, explicitly\nrejecting theodicies. In fact, at one point he claimed that\n\n\nmost attempts to explain why God permits evil\u2014theodicies, as we\nmay call them\u2014strike me as tepid, shallow, and ultimately\nfrivolous. (Plantinga 1985: 35)\n\n\nHis later 2000 Warrant and Christian Belief is an extended\nresponse to defeaters to Christian belief, but it also contains the\nelements of his later O Felix Culpa theodicy. As Kevin Diller\ncomments,\n\n\nthis argument is a new species from Plantinga in the genus of\nresponses to the problem of evil. This is a theodicy, not merely a\ndefense, not merely a defeater defeater, but an explanation for why\nGod allows evil\u2014a reason for evil, that does not remove all the\nperplexity, but at a general level gives us an understanding for why\nit exists. (Diller 2008: 90)\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\nUnlike a free will theodicy, in a [O] Felix Culpa\ntheodicy God desires evil [perhaps not for its own sake but]\nas a means to his good purposes. This move has a dangerously\ndistorting moral and theological impact. We can no longer condemn evil\nand injustice as wholly antithetical to what is good. Evil is\nultimately the will of God\u2026. In a free will theodicy it is the\npermission of evil that is essential to the greater good that\nGod intends, in the Felix Culpa theodicy it is the evil\nitself that is essential to the greater good. Evil is made\nreasonable as a functional good. (Diller 2008: 96)\n\n\nOn this view,\n\n\nthere is also a contingent good-making characteristic of our\nworld\u2014one that isn\u2019t present in all worlds\u2014that\ntowers enormously above all the rest of the contingent states of\naffairs included in our world: the unthinkably great good of divine\nincarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004: 7)\n\n\nGiven his other commitments, including what Marilyn McCord Adams calls\nthe \u201cswamping effect\u201d of God\u2019s goodness (M. Adams\n2008: 126), Plantinga thinks that every possible world is a very good\nworld. God\u2019s existence is not only necessary but also infinitely\ngood, God\u2019s existence outweighs any evil, and every possible\nworld is thus one that is infinitely good. But not all infinities are\nequal. In some worlds, there are additional goods that outweigh the\nevil of sin, namely the goods of incarnation and atonement. Since the\nincarnation and atonement, on Plantinga\u2019s view, follow only\nafter sin, which is contingent, the (infinite) good of the incarnation\nand atonement is also contingent. God\u2019s willing the incarnation\nand atonement is logically prior to God\u2019s decisions to permit\nsin, and thus sin becomes the means to that justifying good. Such a\nposition is called \u201csupralapsarianism\u201d. The way Plantinga\nunderstands the supralapsarianism,\n\n\nthe [divine] decree to save [at least] some of the fallen [via the\nincarnation and atonement] precedes the decree to permit sin.\n(Plantinga 2004: 1)\n\n\n(Diller objects to Plantinga characterizing the\nsupralapsarian/infralapsarian debate in this way; see Diller 2008:\n94).\n\nPlantinga gives three different versions of the argument, each based\non a different assumption about value. Since Plantinga endorses the\nstrongest of these, which Hud Hudson calls \u201cthe Strong Value\nAssumption\u201d (Hudson 2019: 269), I\u2019ll focus on this\nversion. (It\u2019s worth noting that Plantinga thinks that only the\nweakest of the three value assumptions is needed for the O Felix\nCulpa theodicy, although Hudson 2019 argues otherwise.) The\nStrong Value Assumption is as follows:\n\n\nAny world with incarnation and atonement is a better world than any\nwithout it\u2014or at any rate better than any world in which God\ndoes nothing comparable to incarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004:\n1)\n\n\nMore fully:\n\n\nNo matter how much sin and suffering and evil [world] W\ncontains, it is vastly outweighed by the goodness of God, so that\nW is a good world, and indeed a very good world. It follows,\nonce more, that every possible world is a very good world. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that none are more valuable than others. The fact\nis: some possible worlds are much better than others. For there is a\nfeature to be found only in some and not all possible worlds. This is\nthe towering and magnificent good of divine incarnation and\natonement.\u2026No matter how much evil, how much sin and suffering\na world contains, the aggregated badness would be outweighed by the\ngoodness of incarnation and atonement, outweighed in such a way that\nthe world in question is very good. In this sense, therefore, any\nworld with incarnation and atonement is of infinite value by virtue of\ncontaining two goods of infinite value: the existence of God, and\nincarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004: 9f)\n\n\nPlantinga thinks that since all possible worlds containing the goods\nof incarnation and atonement also contain moral evil, the introduction\nof sin into the world is justified by those goods. (For concerns about\nhow Plantinga\u2019s O Felix Culpa theodicy might conflict\nwith his defense to the logical problem of evil, see Davis &\nFranks 2018 and M. Adams 2008.)\n\nThere are a number of objections to Plantinga\u2019s O Felix\nCulpa theodicy. The first involves Plantinga\u2019s treating the\nincarnation and atonement together as a package contained in all the\nbest worlds. While he considers the possibility that there may be\nother worlds not involving incarnation and atonement that are equally\ngood, he says that it\u2019s hard to imagine those worlds and\nsuggests we ignore them. But there are reasons to think that the set\nof worlds containing the incarnation and the set of worlds containing\nthe atonement are not identical. Marilyn McCord Adams, for instance,\nwrites,\n\n\nIn fact, as the great medieval theologians recognized, Incarnation and\natonement are logically independent: all agreed, it would have been\nmetaphysically or logically possible for God to become Incarnate, even\nif creatures had never sinned; and Incarnation without atonement would\nstill have been cosmic excellence enhancing. (M. Adams 2008: 131)\n\n\nAnselm seems to have thought that God couldn\u2019t have reconciled\nwith us in any other way, thereby making the incarnation not only\nfitting (Cur Deus Homo I.1, in Anselm BW; see also the\ndiscussions in Flint 2009 and M. Adams 2004) but also conditionally\nnecessary on human sinfulness (Cur Deus Homo II.6\u20137, in\nAnselm BW; see also Williams forthcoming). But numerous other\ntheologians after him in the medieval period thought he was just wrong\nabout this, including Alexander of Hale, Bonaventure, and Aquinas.\nBonaventure, for instance, believes that the ability of God to bring\nabout the atonement without becoming incarnate follows from divine\npower. And according to Thomas Williams, the non-necessity of the\nincarnation for atonement was \u201cthe dominant medieval view\u201d\n(Williams forthcoming).\n\nThe incarnation and the atonement can come apart in the other\ndirection as well: God could have become incarnate even in the absence\nof sin. Scholastic philosopher and theologian Robert Grosseteste lists\nno fewer than nineteen reasons why God might have become incarnate\neven without sin (see M. Adams 2004: 143). Aquinas held (Summa\ntheologiae III.1.3) that while God could have become\nincarnate even had there been no sin, God would not have chosen to do\nso. (It\u2019s worth noting that other notable theologians, such as\nAugustine and Pope Leo, disagreed; see M. Adams 2004: 147). Duns\nScotus also thought sin wasn\u2019t required for God\u2019s decision\nto become incarnate.\n\nAs Kevin Diller understands Plantinga\u2019s O Felix Culpa\ntheodicy, the incarnation and atonement play different roles:\n\n\nSuffering is not just a necessary byproduct of the plan to effectuate\nincarnation and atonement, but it also allows us to have a kind of\nintimacy and solidarity with Christ that would not otherwise have been\npossible. (Diller 2008: 90)\n\n\nDiller argues that intimacy and solidarity are made possible by the\nincarnation. But these goods could be achieved even without sin and\nthe need for atonement:\n\n\nthe incarnation alone does not require suffering and evil, so neither\nthen is evil required for enhancing the intimacy of human relationship\nwith God. If it is not an enhancement in our relationship with God\nthat necessitates evil, then Plantinga\u2019s argument stands solely\non the first claim: that the value of the atonement, which outweighs\nthe required evil and suffering, is its being an, otherwise\nimpossible, towering display of God\u2019s love. (Diller 2008:\n96)\n\n\nFor his theodicy to work, Plantinga would need to argue that it is the\ngood of the atonement in particular that assures the relevant\ngoodness, thereby revising the Strong Value Assumption to\nsomething like\n\n\nany world with atonement is a better world than any without\nit\u2014or at any rate better than any world in which God does\nnothing comparable to atonement\n\n\n(see also Hudson 2019: 282).\n\nFurthermore, regarding the value of the atonement, Diller suggests\nthat it is not the actual atonement that is required for the good, but\nrather God\u2019s disposition or willingness to engage in the\natonement:\n\n\nEven in worlds without sin\u2014if such worlds are indeed\npossible\u2014the counterfactuals of God\u2019s love are the same.\nPerhaps Plantinga\u2019s view is not that there would be anything\nlacking in God\u2019s love for us without atonement, but that there\nwould be something lacking in our perception of that love. It is\nreasonable to think that it is part of God\u2019s loving purposes\nthat the beloved would understand how loved they are. The argument, in\nthis case, would be that the enactment of God\u2019s love in\nredemption gives us a view of the nature of that love which we would\nnot otherwise have had. But how could we know what God\u2019s\nlimitations are with respect to communicating to us a knowledge of the\ndepth of his love? The weight of the theodicy rests on this\nassumption, but we are not given a good reason to accept it. (Diller\n2008: 92; citations omitted)\n\n\nMarilyn McCord Adams rejects the entire framework of the instrumental\nvalue of evils that the O Felix Culpa theodicy assumes. For\nher, \u201chorrors\u201d are defined as\n\n\nevils the participation in (the doing or suffering of) which\nconstitutes prima facie reason to doubt whether the\nparticipant\u2019s life could (given their inclusion in it) have\npositive meaning for him/her on the whole. (M. Adams 2006: 32)\n\n\nShe elaborates elsewhere:\n\n\nMy own conclusion is that means/end connections between greater goods\nand the worst evils (the ones I have identified as horrors) do not\nhelp the project of Christian theodicy. There need to be meaningful\nconnections of another kind. Where horrors are concerned, it\nwon\u2019t be enough to suggest\u2014as Plantinga does\u2014that\nthe greater good outweighs the evil either. For precisely because\nhorrors threaten to take away the possibility of positive personal\nmeaning, they require recontextualizing to confer some positive\nmeaning upon them. (M. Adams 2008: 137)\n\n\nHorrors, in Adams\u2019 view, need to be defeated rather than simply\nbalanced out or outweighed. And defeat must happen in the life of the\nperson who has suffered or perpetrated the horror, not someone else;\nthat is, we must restrict defeat to the agent involved in the horror.\nWithout this agent-centered restriction, it isn\u2019t possible for\nPlantinga to argue that\n\n\nnot only are perfect love and mercy compatible with requiring the\nsuffering of a person for ends that are unconnected to her own good\nbut that these traits are also compatible with that suffering extended\nto being wrecked and ruined, damnable and (maybe in some cases)\ndamned. (Hudson 2019: 283)\n\n\nDiller picks up the same thread:\n\n\nFor Plantinga\u2019s theodicy to be successful, he must hold that a\nworld including all of the same people would be better off with a fall\nthan without a fall, even though it could not be better for those who\nsuffer eternally broken relationship with God. The good of having\nparticipated in making the world a better place would not individually\noffset the quite personal cost of entering hell or even being\nannihilated. Barring a commitment to universalism, it seems once\nagain, from this angle, that on the Felix Culpa view the value of the\nextravagance of God\u2019s sacrifice is made to be more valuable than\nthe right relationship with God that the sacrifice is meant to\nrestore. (Diller 2008: 94)\n\n\nMcCord Adams argues that it is actually worse than Diller thinks.\nPlantinga doesn\u2019t clearly endorse the double predestination that\nis sometimes paired with supralapsarianism. But, given his rejection\nof universalism, God does knowingly choose to create some free\ncreatures who will be damned:\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s \u201cFelix Culpa\u201d Supralapsarianism has God\ndecide on what careers incompatibilist free creatures will have prior\nin the order of explanation to their existence. Once again, for\nPlantinga, incompatibilist free creatures, considered as merely\npossible, are not \u201ctruth-makers\u201d for the counterfactuals\nof freedom about them. (M. Adams 2008: 134)\n\n\nThe culprit here is actually Plantinga\u2019s Molinism, however, not\nnecessarily the O Felix Culpa. (For concerns about Molinism\non this point, see Perszyk 2011a: 8f; Wierenga 2011: 131\u2013135;\nand Timpe 2018. For a rejection of this concern, see Merricks 2011:\n66).\n\nWilliam Hasker thinks that the most serious objection to\nPlantinga\u2019s O Felix Culpa theodicy is that\n\n\nGod in this theodicy is using his creatures, treating them as\nmeans and not as ends in themselves, by placing them in great peril in\norder to get the glory of saving them. (Hasker 2008: 168f)\n\n\nBut that glory might not even be for saving those individuals that\nsin, since Plantinga thinks that not all who sin are saved. This\nbenefit of the atonement might extend only to some of those who\nsuffer, again raising Adam\u2019s agent-centered constraint. As\nHasker notes, God\u2019s using or instrumentalizing people in this\nway for the sake of some other good seems to run afoul of Romans 3:8,\nwhich explicitly rejects the thinking that we should do evil\n\u201cthat good may come\u201d.\n\nFinally, Hud Hudson raises another objection to Plantinga\u2019s\ntheodicy that he thinks is decisive as an objection to theodicy in\ngeneral. Plantinga writes that\n\n\nany world with incarnation and atonement is better than any world with\nit\u2014or at any rate better than any world in which God does\nnothing comparable to incarnation and atonement. It is hard to imagine\nwhat God could do that is in fact comparable to incarnation and\natonement; but perhaps this is just a limitation of our imagination.\nBut since this is so hard to imagine, I propose that we ignore those\npossible worlds, if there are any, in which God does not arrange for\nincarnation and atonement, but does something else of comparable\nexcellence. (Plantinga 2004: 10)\n\n\nHudson thinks this line of argument fails because it\u2019s a\n\u201csimple and straightforward noseeum inference\u201d where\nabsence of evidence doesn\u2019t amount to evidence of absence\n(Hudson 2019: 285). And Hudson thinks we have no reason to endorse\nsuch an inference in this case. (For another criticism of Plantinga on\nthis point, see also Hasker 2008.)\n",
