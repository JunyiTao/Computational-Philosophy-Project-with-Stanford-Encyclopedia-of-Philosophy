    "main_text": "Twentieth-Century Genetics: A New Predeterminism || The regulatory genome\n9.3 The regulatory genome\n\nThe above and other experimental successes underpin Eric\nDavidson\u2019s theory of \u201cthe regulatory genome\u201d (2006),\nwhich combines new experimental data (mainly from Drosophila\nand sea urchin) with systems and network concepts\u2014in effect,\nupdating Jacob and Monod\u2019s notion of the genetic program. On\nthis view, development is controlled by a DNA-encoded program made up\nof short sequences that specifically bind transcription factor\nproteins and thereby make a difference to gene expression. The first\nstep of gene expression in higher organisms is typically the binding\nof one or more protein factors to a regulatory region of DNA located\nnear the sequence to be transcribed (\u201cread\u201d into mRNA and\nthence to protein). Davidson terms these DNA sequences\n\u201ccis-regulatory modules\u201d. Each module\u2019s effect is\nrepresented as a conditional rule of the form: \u201cIf protein\nX is present, then gene Y is expressed at level Z\u201d.\nEach gene has a set of such modules associated with it, which\ncollectively specify its expression pattern under various conditions.\nThat expression pattern, in turn, determines a cell\u2019s phenotype\nand developmental fate. Control of development is therefore attributed\nentirely to the DNA components of molecular complexes that make a\ndifference to gene expression. Transcription factor proteins and other\ncomponents are conceived as \u201cinputs\u201d to the\ninformation-processing modules, and effects on gene expression as\n\u201coutputs\u201d.\n\nThese basic \u201ccis-regulatory\u201d units are organized into\nsystems of interacting modules. Because transcription factor proteins\nare products of gene expression, the regulatory modules that control\ntheir expression are sites of \u201cprimary core control\u201d for\ndevelopment. These core control modules form an interconnected\nnetwork, reflecting the influences of transcription factor proteins on\none another\u2019s expression. All organisms have a genetic\nregulatory network composed of DNA sequences distributed throughout\nits genome, which constitutes a stable underlying program for\ndevelopment. Collectively, DNA modules act as \u201ca vast,\ndelocalized computational device\u201d that processes regulatory\nstates of a cell (Davidson 2006: 185). Furthermore, regulatory DNA\nsequences are (for the most part) invariant across cells of an\norganism, and organisms of a species, with a relatively small set of\n\u201chub\u201d transcription factors conserved throughout much of\nthe animal kingdom. The regulatory genome therefore offers a unified\nexplanation of animal evolution and development. However, there are\ngood reasons to think the role of DNA sequences in gene expression is\nnot distinctive, causally or informationally (see the entries on\n gene, \n genetics, and\n reductionism in biology). \n Other recent theoretical approaches tend toward more\ninclusive, less gene-centric explanations of development.\n",
