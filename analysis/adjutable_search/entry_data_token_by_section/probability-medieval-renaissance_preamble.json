    "main_text": "\n\nProbability-related terminology played an important role in medieval\nand Renaissance philosophy. Terms such as \u2018probable\u2019\n(probabilis), \u2018credible\u2019 (credibilis) or\n\u2018truth-like\u2019 (verisimilis) were used to assess\nphilosophical claims, qualify uncertain conclusions, gauge the force\nof arguments and temper academic disagreement. Beyond that, they had a\nsignificant impact on the regulation of legal proceedings, moral\naction and everyday life. The probability-related terminology of the\nMiddle Ages descended from ancient sources such as Aristotle, Cicero\nand Boethius. There is no precedent, however, for many medieval ways\nof connecting these terms to rules and principles for legal and\npractical decision-making.\n\nMedieval scholastic uses of probability evolved into the significantly\ndifferent probability discourses of early modern scholasticism and\nhumanism, which both were finally eclipsed by modern quantitative\nnotions of probability in the eighteenth century. Much is still\nunknown concerning these processes, but a fuller understanding can\nonly be approached by accounting for their medieval origins. This\nbackground is also important for charting the shifting borders of\ncertainty and uncertainty, or knowledge and opinion, in European\nphilosophy, as well as charting attitudes towards risk in the history\nof economic thought.\n",
