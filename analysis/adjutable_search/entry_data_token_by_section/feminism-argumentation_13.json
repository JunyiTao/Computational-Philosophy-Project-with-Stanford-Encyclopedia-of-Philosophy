    "main_text": "Critical Thinking and Argument Pedagogy\n6. Critical Thinking and Argument Pedagogy\n\nFallacies remain a popular way to teach reasoning, as does argument\nanalysis more generally. Both play central roles in the content of\nCanadian, US, and UK post-secondary education as part of the set of\nskills regularly taught under the name \u201ccritical thinking\u201d\nin philosophy departments. Education allows cultures of reasoning to\nreinforce and reproduce themselves and these cultures affect the\nprospects for feminist transformation of the larger society.\nEducational institutions have authority and grant authority to systems\nof thought and to individuals and in this way critical thinking\neducation provides opportunities for conformity or for social\ntransformation, starting at the level of individual reasoning and\ninterpersonal discourse. In many ways, the ideal and practice of\ncritical thinking serves social progress but in other ways it needs\nreform.\n\nThe way that argument education works its way from the academy into\nordinary reasoning practices may be rather indirect and slow but\nacademic philosophy is not merely one discourse among others and it\nhas a central role in validating or authorizing other discourses\n(Alcoff 1993), especially in the epistemological assumptions conveyed\nthrough critical thinking pedagogy. Courses in critical thinking\nbecame stock components of the undergraduate curriculum during the\nlate twentieth century and so the standards for reasoning implicit in\n\u201ccritical thinking\u201d as an educational goal for students\ndirectly impact on countless students every year. Critical thinking\noperates as a specifically Western practice and ideal that provides\nalternatives to patterns of reasoning that enforce male dominance in\nvarious cultures, Western culture included (Norris 1995). The appeals\nto individual rationality and independent reasoning in the critical\nthinking curriculum contrast with appeals to tradition and with\nprioritizing community and personal relationships.\n\nSystems of thinking, such as theories or logics, and speech acts, such\nas arguments, can hold authority that is not attached to a specific\nspeaker or type of speaker, even though people may be paradigmatic\nholders of authority. The authority of social institutions, especially\nin their claims to be objective, Code argues (1995: 21, 181), may be\nlikewise justified or not justified. Granting the justification of\ndepersonalized authorities that include institutions of postsecondary\neducation becomes second nature in a technological society, while\nthose who lack social status and expertise have heightened dependence\non the authority of expertise. This authority actually lies in the\nhands of people who have social privilege and yet people who are\nsocially marginalized have a serious stake in the institutions that\ndevelop knowledge, from the legal system and the media to the pedagogy\nof argumentation in the form of \u201ccritical thinking\u201d\neducation (Hundleby 2013b).\n\nHundleby makes a case that critical thinking courses provided by\nphilosophy departments currently tend to reinforce disciplinary biases\nbecause they invoke an authority that lacks the monitoring and\nevaluation that justifies authority (Hanrahan & Antony 2005). The\ntypical way that textbooks present fallacies exhibits ignorance of the\ncurrent informal logic scholarship, which would provide the\nappropriate source of expertise. There are few textbooks written by\nscholars who have published even one article in argumentation or logic\nand these same textbooks written by non-specialists are most likely to\nevince the Adversary Method described by Moulton (1983). The\nunreflective nature of dependence on that Method suggests that it\nremains authoritative\u2014as well as\n\u201cparadigmatic\u201d\u2014in philosophy (Hundleby 2010).\n\nGilbert argues that critical thinking education ought to affirm a\nrange of considerations that do not enter into traditional logic\n(Gilbert 1994: 111). Contemporary philosophical theorizing tends to\ntreat arguments as premise-conclusion complexes, merely as\n\u201cproducts\u201d of the discourse that generates them (Wenzel\n1980 [1992]), without considering the processes that give rise to\nthem. The focus on premise-conclusion complexes obscures factors\nrelevant to the feminist goal of preventing harm (Lang 2010) and such\na lack of appropriate \u201crhetorical spaces\u201d or conceptual\nframeworks in philosophy impedes the education of people about the\nproblems that women face (Code 1995). The standard Euro-American\nphilosophical practices of the Adversary Paradigm or the\nCritical-Logical model sideline important aspects of arguing that\nindicate the significance and cogency of feminist claims about things\nlike the social identities of arguers. Argument has a testimonial\ndimension, as Audrey Yap explains (2013; 2015). Consciousness of such\nsituational aspects of reasoning and philosophical argumentation\nfacilitates the appreciation of feminist perspectives. It also\nprovides for more rigorous analysis and more thoroughly critical\nthinking.\n\nBucking the large trend of textbooks that fail to reflect the\nargumentation scholarship, Linker (2015) follows in a minor tradition\nof textbooks by expert authors that also advance scholarly theorizing\nabout argumentation (e.g., Govier 1985; Johnson & Blair 1977;\nMakau & Marty 2001, 2013). Her Intellectual Empathy aims\nto provide reasoners with skills for understanding how social\ninequalities affect people\u2019s lives and how those structures are\nmaintained. The first three skills involved in \u201cintellectual\nempathy\u201d are: (i) understanding the invisibility of privilege;\n(ii) knowing that social identity is\n intersectional;[6]\n and (iii) using models of cooperative reasoning. Linker argues that\nsocial identity lies at the center of what Quine calls the \u201cweb\nof\n belief\u201d,[7]\n which is to say it is deeply connected with many of a person\u2019s\nbeliefs; and for Linker that involves it in their self-esteem. The\npersonal stake people have in their social identities means that\ndiscussion that engages our identities can be emotionally fraught. We\n\u201ctake it personally\u201d. When people are arguing about\naspects of social identity, they often fall into feelings of blame or\nguilt. Linker suggests that reasoners can find alternatives to such\ndestructive responses by consideration of the complexities of\neveryone\u2019s individual situation regarding social privilege.\nAttending to the specificities of each other\u2019s perspectives\nallows us to better understand each other and set up reasoners for\nmore cooperative and less adversarial arguing (Linker 2015: 98).\n\nAccording to Linker, intellectual empathy also requires that when\nencountering a view that seems biased or stereotypical reasoners (iv)\napply a principle of conditional trust, treating the person holding\nthe view as reasonable and well-intentioned. This assumption allows us\nbetter to learn about the real reasons the person holds the view, and\ngenerally improves the audience\u2019s ability to gather and share\nevidence (2015: 156\u2013158).\n\nFinally, Linker advises (v) recognizing our mutual vulnerability to\nbias and stereotype, while at the same time allowing ourselves to be\nresponsive and accommodating to new information. This demands courage\nand strength. Linker\u2019s five skills thus provide a way to address\nthe testimonial dimensions of arguing with special attention to their\noperation when people argue from very different social locations. This\nvision of critical thinking steps forward in addressing feminist\nconcerns with the cultures and practices of argumentation.\n",
