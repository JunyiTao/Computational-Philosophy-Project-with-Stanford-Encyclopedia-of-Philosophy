    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy || Reconciliation and Realistic Utopia\n5.6 Reconciliation and Realistic Utopia\n\nRawls\u2019s vision is of a perpetually peaceful and cooperative\ninternational order, where liberal and decent peoples stand ready to\npacify aggressive states, to secure core human rights, and to help\nstruggling countries until they become self-sufficient.\n\nCompared to other theories, Rawls\u2019s international theory has\nlimited ambitions. Officials of democratic societies can do little\nmore than hope that decent societies will become internally more\ntolerant and democratic. Once the duty to assist burdened peoples is\nsatisfied, there are no further requirements on international economic\ndistributions: for Rawls, international economic inequalities are of\nno political concern as such. Moreover, individuals around the world\nmay suffer greatly from bad luck, and they may be haunted by spiritual\nemptiness. These are not concerns reached by a Rawlsian foreign\npolicy.\n\nThe limited practical goal of Rawls\u2019s law of peoples is the\nelimination of the great evils of human history: unjust war and\noppression, religious persecution and the denial of liberty of\nconscience, starvation and poverty, genocide and mass murder. The\nlimits of this ambition mean that there will be much in the world to\nwhich Rawls\u2019s political philosophy offers no reconciliation.\n\nNevertheless, while Rawls\u2019s vision is limited, it is also\nutopian. To believe that Rawls\u2019s vision is possible is to\nbelieve that individuals are not inevitably selfish or amoral, and\nthat international relations can be more than merely a contest for\ndomination, wealth, and glory. Human life, and human history, need not\nbe merely a Hobbesian \u201cperpetual and restless desire of power\nafter power\u201d (1651, 58). Affirming the possibility of a just and\npeaceful future can inoculate us against a cynicism that undermines\nthe decency, reciprocity, and reasonableness that exist now and that\nmay grow from now on.\n\n\u201cBy showing how the social world may realize the features of a\nrealistic utopia,\u201d Rawls says, \u201cpolitical philosophy\nprovides a long-term goal of political endeavor, and in working toward\nit gives meaning to what we can do today\u201d (LP,\n128).\n",
