    "main_text": "Formulating Animalism\n1. Formulating Animalism\n\nDespite its Aristotelian heritage, animalism is a relative newcomer to\nthe personal identity debate. While early intimations of the view can\nbe found in work by Wiggins (1980) and Wollheim (1984), those\nprimarily responsible for injecting the view into the contemporary\ndebate over personal identity include Ayers (1991), Carter (1989,\n1999), Olson (1997), Snowdon (1990, 1991, 1995), and van Inwagen\n(1990). Though its supporters appear to remain in the minority,\nanimalism has since attracted other advocates, including Bailey (2016,\n2017), Blatti (2012), DeGrazia (2005), Hacker (2007), Hershenov\n(2005a), D. Mackie (1999a,b), Merricks (2001), and Wiggins (2001).\nNotable critics include Baker (2000, 2016), Johnston (2007, 2016),\nMcMahan (2002), Noonan (1998, 1989 [2019]), Parfit (2012), and S.\nShoemaker (1999, 2011, 2016), among others.\n\nThe name \u2018animalism\u2019 was conferred by Snowdon (1991: 109)\nand has been widely adopted. The view is also sometimes referred to as\n\u201cthe organism view\u201d (e.g., Liao 2006), the\n\u201cbiological criterion\u201d (e.g., D. Shoemaker 2009), or\n\u201cthe biological approach\u201d (e.g., Olson 1997).\n",
