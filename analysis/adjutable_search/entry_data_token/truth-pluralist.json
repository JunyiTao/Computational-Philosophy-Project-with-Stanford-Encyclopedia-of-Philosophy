Alethic pluralism about truth: a plurality of properties\n1.1 Strength\n\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s thesis that there are many ways of being true\nis typically construed as being tantamount to the claim that the number\nof truth properties is greater than one. However, this basic\ninterpretation,\n\n(1) there is more than one truth property.\n\n\n\nis compatible with both moderate as well as more radical\nprecisifications. According to moderate pluralism, at least one way of\nbeing true among the multitude of others is universally shared:\n\n(2) there is more than one truth property, some of which are had by\nall true sentences.\n\n\n\nAccording to strong pluralism, however, there is no such universal\nor common way of being true:\n\n(3) there is more than one truth property, none of which is had by\nall true sentences.\n\n\n\nPrecisifying pluralism about truth in these two ways brings several\nconsequences to the fore. Firstly, both versions of pluralism conflict\nwith strong monism about truth:\n\n(4) there is exactly one truth property, which is had by all true\nsentences.\n\n\n\nSecondly, moderate\u2014but not strong\u2014pluralism is\ncompatible with a moderate version of monism about truth:\n\n(5) there is one truth property, which is had by all true\nsentences.\n\n\n\n(2) and (5) are compatible because (5) does not rule out the\npossibility that the truth property had by all true sentences might be\none among the multitude of truth properties endorsed by the moderate\npluralist (i.e., by someone who endorses (2)). Only strong pluralism in\n(3) entails the denial of the claim that all true sentences are true in\nthe same way. Thus, moderate pluralists and moderate monists\ncan in principle find common ground.\n1.2 Related kinds of pluralism and neighboring views\n\n\nNot infrequently, pluralism about truth fails to be distinguished\nfrom various other theses about associated conceptual, pragmatic,\nlinguistic, semantic, and normative phenomena. Each of these other theses involves\nattributing plurality to a different aspect of the analysandum\n(explanandum, definiendum, etc.). For instance, linguistically, one may\nmaintain that there is a plurality of truth predicates (Wright 1992;\nTappolet 1997; Lynch 2000; Pedersen 2006, 2010). Semantically, one may\nmaintain that alethic terms like \u2018true\u2019 have multiple\nmeanings (Pratt 1908; Tarski 1944; K\u00f6lbel 2008, 2013; Wright 2010).\nCognitively or conceptually, one may maintain that there is a\nmultiplicity of truth concepts or regimented ways of conceptualizing\ntruth (K\u00fcnne 2003; cf. Lynch 2006). Normatively, one might think\nthat truth has a plurality of profiles (Ferrari 2016, 2018).\n\n\nThese parameters or dimensions suggest that pluralism is itself not\njust a single, monolithic theory (see also Sher 1998; Wright\n2013). Any fully developed version of pluralism about truth is likely\nto make definitive commitments about at least some of these other\nphenomena. (However, it hardly entails them; one can consistently be\nan alethic pluralist about truth, for instance, without necessarily\nhaving commitments to linguistic pluralism about truth predicates, or\nabout concepts like fact or actuality.) Nonetheless, theses about\nthese other phenomena should be distinguished from pluralism about\ntruth, as understood here.\n\n\nLikewise, pluralism about truth must be distinguished from several\nneighbouring views, such as subjectivism, contextualism, relativism, or\neven nihilism about truth. For example, one can maintain some form of\nsubjectivism about truth while remaining agnostic about how many ways\nof being true there are. Or again, one can consistently maintain that\nthere is exactly one way of being true, which is always and everywhere\ndependent on context. Nor is it inconsistent to be both a pluralist and\nan absolutist or other anti-relativist about truth. For example, one\nmight argue that each of the different ways of being true holds\nabsolutely if it holds at all (Wright 1992). Alternatively, one might\nexplicate a compatibilist view, in which there are at least two kinds\nof truth, absolute and relative truth (Joachim 1905), or deflationist\nand substantivist (K\u00f6lbel 2013). Such views would be, necessarily,\npluralistic. Occasionally, pluralists have also been lumped together\nwith various groups of so-called \u2018nihilists\u2019,\n\u2018deniers\u2019, and \u2018cynics\u2019, and even associated\nwith an \u2018anything goes\u2019 approach to truth (Williams 2002).\nHowever, any version of pluralism is prima facie inconsistent with any\nview that denies truth properties, such as nihilism and certain forms\nof nominalism.\n1.3 Alethic pluralism, inflationism, and deflationism\n\n\nThe foregoing varieties of pluralism are consistent with various\nfurther analyses of pluralists\u2019 ideas about truth. For instance,\npluralists may\u2014but need not\u2014hold that truth properties are\nsimply one-place properties, since commitments to truth\u2019s being\nmonadic are orthogonal to commitments to its being monistic. However,\nmost pluralists converge on the idea that truth is a substantive\nproperty and take this idea as the point of departure for articulating\ntheir view.\n\n\nA property is substantive just in case there is more to its nature\nthan what is given in our concept of the property. A paradigmatic\nexample of a substantive property is the property of being water. There\nis more to the nature of water\u2014being composed of H\\(_2\\)O,\ne.g.\u2014than what is revealed in our concept of water (the\ncolourless, odourless liquid that comes out of taps, fills lakes,\netc.)\n\n\nThe issue of substantiveness connects with one of the major issues\nin the truth debate: the rift between deflationary theories of truth\nand their inflationary counterparts (Horwich 1990; Edwards 2013b;\nK\u00fcnne 2003; Sher 2016b; Wyatt 2016; Wyatt & Lynch 2016). A common way to understand the divide between\ndeflationists and inflationists is in terms of the question whether or\nnot truth is a substantive property. Inflationists endorse this idea,\nwhile deflationists reject it. More specifically, deflationists and\ninflationists can be seen as disagreeing over the following claim:\n\n(6) there exists some property \\(F\\) (coherence,\ncorrespondence, etc.) such that any sentence, if true, is so in virtue\nof being \\(F\\)\u2014and this is a fact that is not transparent in\nthe concept of truth.\n\n\n\nThe inflationist accepts (6). According to her, it is not\ntransparent in the concept of truth that being true is a matter of\npossessing some further property (cohering, corresponding, etc.). This\nmakes truth a substantive property. The deflationist, on the other\nhand, rejects (6) because she is committed to the idea that everything\nthere is to know about truth is transparent in the concept\u2014which,\non the deflationist\u2019s view, is exhausted by the disquotational\nschema (\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if, \\(p)\\), or some principle\nlike it.\n\n\nDeflationists also tend to reject a further claim about\ntruth\u2019s explanatory role:\n\n(7) \\(F\\) is necessary and sufficient for explaining the truth\nof any true sentence \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nInflationists, on the other hand, typically accept both (6) and\n(7).\n\n\nStrong and moderate versions of pluralism are perhaps best\nunderstood as versions of a non-traditional inflationary theory (for an exception, see Beall 2013; for refinements, see Edwards 2012b and Ferrari & Moruzzi forthcoming).\nPluralists side with inflationists on (6) and (7), and so, their views\ncount as inflationary. Yet, traditional inflationary theories are also\npredominantly monistic. They differ about which property\n\\(F\\)\u2014coherence, identity, superwarrant, correspondence,\netc.\u2014truth consists in, but concur that there is precisely one\nsuch property:\n\n(8) there is a single property \\(F\\) and truth\nconsists in a single property \\(F\\).\n\n\n\nThe monistic supposition in (8) is tantamount to the claim that\nthere is but one way of being true. In opposing that claim, pluralism\ncounts as non-traditional.\n2. Motivating pluralism: the scope problem\n\n\nPluralists\u2019 rejection of (8) typically begins by rendering it as a\nclaim about the invariant nature of truth across all regions of\ndiscourse (Acton 1935; Wright 1992, 1996; Lynch 2000, 2001; for more\non domains see Edwards 2018b; Kim & Pedersen 2018, Wyatt 2013; Yu\n2017). Thus rendered, the claim appears to be at odds with the\nfollowing observation:\n\n(9) the plausibility of each inflationist\u2019s candidate for the\nproperty \\(F\\) differs across different regions of discourse.\n\n\n\nFor example, some theories\u2014such as correspondence\ntheories\u2014seem intuitively plausible when applied to truths about\nladders, ladles, and other ordinary objects. However, those theories\nseem much less convincing when applied to truths about comedy, fashion,\nethical mores, numbers, jurisprudential dictates, etc. Conversely,\ntheories that seem intuitively plausible when applied to legal, comic,\nor mathematical truths\u2014such as those suggesting that the nature\nof truth is coherence\u2014seem less convincing when applied to truths\nabout the empirical world.\n\n\nPluralists typically take traditional inflationary theories of truth\nto be correct in analyzing truth in terms of some substantive property\n\\(F\\). Yet, the problem with their monistic suppositions lies with\ngeneralization: a given property \\(F\\) might be necessary and\nsufficient for explaining why sentences about a certain subject matter\nare true, but no single property is necessary and sufficient for\nexplaining why \\(p\\) is true for all sentences \\(p\\), whatever its subject\nmatter. Subsequently, those theories\u2019 inability to generalize\ntheir explanatory scope beyond the select few regions of discourse for\nwhich they are intuitively plausible casts aspersion on their candidate\nfor \\(F\\). This problem has gone by various names, but has come to\nbe known as \u2018the scope problem\u2019 (Lynch 2004b, 2009; cf. Sher\n1998).\n\n\nPluralists respond to the scope problem by first rejecting (8) and\nreplacing it with:\n\n(10) truth consists in several properties \\(F_1 ,\n\\ldots ,F_n\\).\n\n\n\nWith (10), pluralists contend that the nature of truth is not a\nsingle property \\(F\\) that is invariant across all regions of\ndiscourse; rather the true sentences in different regions of discourse\nmay consist in different properties among the plurality\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) that\nconstitute truth\u2019s nature.\n\n\nThe idea that truth is grounded in various properties\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) might be\nfurther introduced by way of analogy. Consider water. We ordinarily\nthink and talk about something\u2019s being water as if it were just\none thing\u2014able to exist in different states, but nevertheless\nconsisting in just one property (H\\(_2\\)O). But it would be a\nmistake to legislate in advance that we should be monists about water,\nsince the nature of water is now known to vary more than our intuitions\nwould initially have it. The isotopic distribution of water allows for\ndifferent molecular structures, to include hydroxonium\n(H\\(_3\\)O), deuterium oxide (D\\(_2\\)O), and so-called\n\u2018semi-heavy water\u2019 (HDO). Or again, consider sugar, the\nnature of which includes glucose, fructose, lactose, cellulose, and\nsimilar other such carbohydrates. For the pluralist, so too might truth\nbe grounded as a plurality of more basic properties.\n\n\nOne reason to take pluralism about truth seriously, then, is that it\nprovides a solution to the scope problem. In rejecting the\n\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach to truth, pluralists formulate\na theory whose generality is guaranteed by accommodating the various\nproperties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) by\nwhich true sentences come to be true in different regions of discourse.\nA second and related reason is that the view promises to be\nexplanatory. Variance in the nature of truth in turn explains why\ntheories of truth perform unequally across various regions of\ndiscourse\u2014i.e., why they are descriptively adequate and\nappropriate in certain regions of discourse, but not others. For\npluralists, the existence of different kinds of truths is symptomatic\nof the non-uniform nature of truth itself. Subsequently, taxonomical\ndifferences among truths might be better understood by formulating\ndescriptive models about how the nature of truth might vary between\nthose taxa.\n3. Prominent versions of pluralism\n3.1 Platitude-based strategies\n\n\nMany pluralists have followed Wright (1992) in supposing that\ncompliance with platitudes is what regiments and characterizes the\nbehavior and content of truth-predicates. Given a corollary account of\nhow differences in truth predicates relate to differences among truth\nproperties, this supposition suggests a platitude-based strategy for\npositing many ways of being true. Generally, a strategy will be\nplatitude-based if it is intended to show that a certain collection of\nplatitudes \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n\\) suffices for\nunderstanding the analysandum or explanandum. By\n\u2018platitude\u2019, philosophers generally mean certain\nuncontroversial expressions about a given topic or domain. Beyond that,\nconceptions about what more something must be or have to count as\nplatitudinous vary widely.\n3.1.1 Discourse pluralism/minimalism\n\n\nA well-known version of platitude-based pluralism is discourse\npluralism. The simplest versions of this view make the following four\nclaims. Firstly, discourse exhibits natural divisions, and so can be\nstably divided into different regions \\(D_1 , \\ldots ,D_n\\). Secondly, the platitudes subserving some\n\\(D_i\\) may be different than those subserving\n\\(D_j\\). Thirdly, for any pair \\((D_i,\nD_j)\\), compliance with different platitudes\nsubserving each region of discourse can, in principle, result in\nnumerically distinct truth predicates \\((t_i,\nt_j)\\). Finally, numerically distinct truth predicates\ndesignate different ways of being true.\n\n\nDiscourse pluralism is frequently associated with Crispin Wright\n(1992, 1996, 2001), although others have held similar views (see, e.g.,\nPutnam 1994: 515). Wright has argued that discourse pluralism is\nsupported by what he calls \u2018minimalism\u2019. According to\nminimalism, compliance with both the disquotational schema and the\noperator schema,\n\n(11) \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n(12) it is true that \\(p\\) if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nas well as other \u2018parent\u2019 platitudes, is both necessary\nand sufficient for some term \\(t_i\\) to qualify as\nexpressing a concept worth regarding as TRUTH (1992: 34\u20135).\nWright proposed that the parent platitudes, which basically serve as\nvery superficial formal or syntactic constraints, fall into two\nsubclasses: those connecting truth with assertion\n(\u2018transparency\u2019),\n\n(13) To assert is to present as true.\n\n(14) Any attitude to a proposition is an attitude towards its\ntruth.\n\n\nand those connecting truth with logical operations\n(\u2018embedding\u2019),\n\n(15) Any truth-apt content has a negation which is also\ntruth-apt.\n\n(16) Aptitude for truth is preserved under basic logical operations\n(disjunction, conjunction, etc.).\n\n\nAny such term complying with these parent platitudes, regardless of\nregion of discourse, counts as what Wright called a\n\u2018lightweight\u2019 or \u2018minimal\u2019 truth predicate.\nYet, the establishment of some \\(t\\) as a minimal truth predicate\nis compatible, argued Wright, with the nature of truth consisting in\ndifferent things in different domains (2001: 752).\n\n\nWright (2001) has also suggested that lightweight truth predicates\ntend to comply with five additional subclasses of platitudes, including\nthose connecting truth with reality (\u2018correspondence\u2019) and\neternity (\u2018stability\u2019),\n\n(17) For a sentence to be true is for it to correspond with\nreality.\n\n(18) True sentences accurately reflect how matters stand.\n(19) To be true is to \u201ctell it like it is\u201d.\n(20) A sentence is always true if it ever is.\n(21) Whatever may be asserted truly may be asserted truly at any\ntime.\n\n\nand those disconnecting truth from epistemic state\n(\u2018opacity\u2019), justification (\u2018contrast\u2019), and\nscalar degree (\u2018absoluteness\u2019),\n\n(22) A thinker may be so situated that a particular truth is beyond\nher ken.\n\n(23) Some truths may never be known.\n(24) Some truths may be unknowable in principle.\n(25) A sentence may be true without being justified and\nvice-versa.\n(26) Sentences cannot be more or less true.\n(27) Sentences are completely true if at all.\n\n\nThe idea is that \\(t\\) may satisfy additional platitudes beyond\nthese, and in doing so may increase its \u2018weight\u2019. For\nexample, some \\(t_i\\) may be a more heavyweight truth\npredicate than \\(t_j\\) in virtue of satisfying\nplatitudes which entail that truth be evidence-transcendent or that\nthere be mind-independent truth-makers. Finally, differences in what\nconstitutes truth in \\(D_1 , \\ldots ,D_n\\) are tracked by differences in the weight of\nthese predicates. In this way, Wright is able to accommodate the\nintuition that sentences about, e.g., macromolecules in biochemistry\nare amenable to realist truth in a way that sentences about\ndistributive welfare in ethics may not be.\n\n\nDistinctions among truth predicates, according to the discourse\npluralist, are due to more and less subtle differences among platitudes\nand principles with which they must comply. For example, assuming that\naccuracy of reflection is a matter of degree, predicates for truth and\ntruthlikeness diverge because a candidate predicate may comply with\neither (18) or else either of (26) or (27); to accommodate both, two\ncorollary platitudes must be included to make explicit that accurate\nreflection in the case of truth is necessarily maximal and that degrees\nof accuracy are not equivalent to degrees of truth. Indeed, it is not\nunusual for platitudes to presuppose certain attendant semantic or\nmetaphysical views. For example,\n\n(28) A sentence may be characterized as true just in case it\nexpresses a true proposition.\n\n\n\nrequires anti-nominalist commitments, an ontological commitment to\npropositions, and commitments to the expression relation (translation\nrelations, an account of synonymy, etc.). Discourse pluralists\nrequiring predicates to comply with (28) in order to count as\ntruth-predicates must therefore be prepared to accommodate other claims\nthat go along with (28) as a package-deal.\n3.1.2 Functionalism about truth\n\n\u2018Functionalism about truth\u2019 names the thesis that truth\nis a functional kind. The most comprehensive and systematic development\nof a platitude-based version of functionalism comes from Michael Lynch,\nwho has been at the forefront of ushering in pluralist themes and\ntheses (see Lynch 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004c, 2005a, 2005b, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2013; Devlin\n2003). Lynch has urged that we need to think about truth in terms of\nthe \u2018job\u2019 or role, \\(F\\), that true sentences stake\nout in our discursive practices (2005a: 29).\n\n\nInitially, Lynch\u2019s brand of functionalism attempted to\nimplicitly define the denotation of \u2018truth\u2019 using the\nquasi-formal technique of Ramsification. The technique commences by\ntreating \u2018true\u2019 as the theoretical term \\(\\tau\\)\nissued by the theory \\(T\\) and targeted for implicit definition.\nFirstly, the platitudes and principles of the theory are amassed\n\\((T: p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) so that\nthe \\(F\\)-role can be specified holistically. Secondly, a certain\nsubset \\(A\\) of essential platitudes \\((p_i ,\n\\ldots ,p_k)\\) must be extracted from \\(T\\),\nand are then conjoined. Thirdly, following David Lewis, \\(T\\) is\nrewritten as\n\n(29) \\(R(\\tau_1,\\ldots ,\n\\tau_n , \\omicron_1,\\ldots , \\omicron_n )\\)\n\n\n\nso as to isolate the \\(\\tau\\)-terms from the non-theoretical\n(\u2018old, original, other\u2019) \\(o\\)-terms. Fourthly, all\ninstances of \u2018true\u2019 and other cognate or closely related\n\\(\\tau\\)-terms are then replaced by subscripted variables\n\\(x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\). The resulting\nopen sentence is prefixed with existential quantifiers to bind them.\nNext, the Ramsey sentence is embedded in a material biconditional; this\nallows functionalists to then specify the conditions by which a given\ntruth-apt sentence \\(p\\) has a property that plays the \\(F\\)-role:\n\n(30) \\(p\\) has some property \\(\\varrho_i\\) realizing the\n\\(F\\)-role \\(\\equiv \\exists x_1 , \\ldots ,\\exists x_n [R(x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n , \\omicron_1,\\ldots , \\omicron_n ) \\amp p\\) has\n\\(x_1\\)],\n\n\n\nwhere, say, the variable \\(x_1\\) is the one that\nreplaced \u2018true\u2019. Having specified the conditions under\nwhich \\(p\\) has some property realizing \\(F\\), functionalists can then\nderive another material biconditional stating that \\(p\\) is true iff \\(p\\) has\nsome property realizing the \\(F\\)-role.\n\n\nHowever, as Lynch (2004: 394) cautioned, biconditionals that specify\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for \\(p\\) to be true still leave open\nquestions about the \u2018deep\u2019 metaphysical nature of truth.\nThus, given the choice, Lynch\u2014following up on a suggestion from\nPettit (1996: 886)\u2014urged functionalists to identify truth, not\nwith the properties realizing the \\(F\\)-role in a given region of\ndiscourse, but with the \\(F\\)-role itself. Doing so is one way to\ntry to secure the \u2018unity\u2019 of truth (on the presumption that\nthere is just one \\(F\\)-role). Hence, to say that truth is a\nfunctional kind \\(F\\) is to say that the \\(\\tau\\)-term\n\u2018truth\u2019 denotes the property of having a property that\nplays the \\(F\\)-role, where the \\(F\\)-role is tantamount to\nthe single unique second-order property of being \\(F\\).\nAccordingly, this theory proposes that something is true just in case\nit is \\(F\\).\n\n\nTwo consequences are apparent. Firstly, the functionalist\u2019s\ncommitment to alethic properties realizing the \\(F\\)-role seems to\nbe a commitment to a grounding thesis. This explains why Lynch\u2019s\nversion of alethic functionalism fits the pattern typical of\ninflationary theories of truth, which are committed to (6) and\n(7) above. Secondly, however, like most traditional inflationary\ntheories, Lynch\u2019s functionalism about truth appears to be\nmonistic. Indeed, the functionalist commitment to identifying truth\nwith and only with the unique property of being \\(F\\) seems to\nentail a commitment to strong alethic monism in (5) rather than\npluralism (Wright 2005). Nonetheless, it is clear that Lynch\u2019s\nversion does emphasize that sentences can have the property of being\n\\(F\\) in different ways. The theory thus does a great deal to\naccommodate the intuitions that initially motivate the pluralist thesis\nthat there is more than one way of being true, and to finesse a fine\nline between monism and pluralism.\n\n\nFor pluralists, this compromise may not be good enough, and critics\nof functionalism about truth have raised several concerns. One\nstumbling block for functionalist theories is a worry about epistemic\ncircularity. As Wright (2010) observes, any technique for implicit\ndefinition, such as Ramsification, proceeds on the basis of explicit\ndecisions that the platitudes and principles constitutive of the\nmodified Ramsey sentence are themselves true, and making explicit\ndecisions that they are true requires already knowing in advance what\ntruth is. Lynch (2013a) notes that the problem is not peculiar to\nfunctionalism about truth, generalizing to virtually all approaches\nthat attempt to fix the denotation of \u2018true\u2019 by appeal to\nimplicit definition. Some might want to claim that it generalizes even\nfurther, namely to any theory of truth whatsoever. Another issue is\nthat the \\(F\\)-role becomes disunified to the extent that\n\\(T\\) can accommodate substantially different platitudes and\nprinciples. Recall that the individuation and identity conditions of\nthe \\(F\\)-role\u2014with which truth is identified\u2014are\ndetermined holistically by the platitudes and principles constituting\n\\(T\\). So where \\(T\\) is constituted by expressions of the\nbeliefs and commitments of ordinary folk, pluralists could try to show\nthat these beliefs and commitments significantly differ across\nepistemic communities (see, e.g., N\u00e6ss 1938a, b; Maffie 2002;\nUlatowski 2017, Wyatt 2018). In that case, Ramsification over\nsignificantly different principles may yield implicit definitions of\nnumerically distinct role properties\n\\(F_1, F_2 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), each of which is a warranted claimant to being\ntruth.\n3.2 Correspondence pluralism\n\n\nThe correspondence theory is often invoked as exemplary of\ntraditional monistic theories of truth, and thus as a salient rival to\npluralism about truth. Prima facie, however, the two are consistent.\nThe most fundamental principle of any version of the correspondence\ntheory,\n\n(31) Truth consists in correspondence.\n\n\n\nspecifies what truth consists in. Since it involves no covert\ncommitment about how many ways of being true there are, it does not\nrequire denying that there is more than one (Wright & Pedersen\n2010). In principle, there may be different ways of consisting in\ncorrespondence that yield different ways of being true. Subsequently,\nwhether the two theories turn out to be genuine rivals depends on\nwhether further commitments are made to explicitly rule out\npluralism.\n\n\nCorrespondence theorists have occasionally made proposals that combine\ntheir view with a version of pluralism. An early\u2014although not\nfully developed\u2014proposal of this kind was made by Henry Acton\n(1935: 191). Two recent proposals are noteworthy and have been\ndeveloped in detail. Gila Sher (1998, 2004, 2005, 2013, 2015, 2016a) has\npicked up the project of expounding on the claim that sentence in\ndomains like logic correspond to facts in a different way than do\nsentences in other domains, while Terence Horgan and colleagues\n(Horgan 2001; Horgan & Potr\u010d 2000, 2006; Horgan & Timmons\n2002; Horgan & Barnard 2006; Barnard & Horgan 2013)\nhave elaborated a view that involves a defense of the claim that not\nall truths correspond to facts in the same way.\n\n\nFor Sher, truth does not consist in different properties in\ndifferent regions of discourse (e.g., superwarrant in macroeconomics,\nhomomorphism in immunology, coherence in film studies, etc.). Rather,\nit always and everywhere consists in correspondence. Taking\n\u2018correspondence\u2019 to generally refer to an \\(n\\)-place\nrelation \\(R\\), Sher advances a version of correspondence\npluralism by countenancing different \u2018forms\u2019, or ways of\ncorresponding. For example, whereas the physical form of correspondence\ninvolves a systematic relation between the content of physical\nsentences and the physical structure of the world, the logical form of\ncorrespondence involves a systematic relation between the logical\nstructure of sentences and the formal structure of the world, while the\nmoral form of correspondence involves a relation between the moral\ncontent of sentences and (arguably) the psychological or sociological\nstructure of the world.\n\n\nSher\u2019s view can be regarded as a moderate form of pluralism.\nIt combines the idea that truth is many with the idea that truth is\none. Truth is many on Sher\u2019s view because there are different\nforms of correspondence. These are different ways of being true. At the\nsame time, truth is one because these different ways of being true are\nall forms of correspondence.\n\n\nFor Sher, a specific matrix of \u2018factors\u2019 determines the\nunique form of correspondence as well as the correspondence principles\nthat govern our theorizing about them. Which factors are in play\ndepends primarily on the satisfaction conditions of predicates. For\nexample, the form of correspondence for logical truths of the form\n\n(32) Every \\(x\\) either is or is not self-identical.\n\n\n\nis determined solely by the logical factor, which is reflected by\nthe universality of the union of the set of self-identical things and\nits complement. Or again, consider the categorical sentences\n\n(33) Some humans are disadvantaged.\n\n\n\nand\n\n(34) Some humans are vain.\n\n\n\nBoth (33) and (34) involve a logical factor, which is reflected in\ntheir standard form as I-statements (i.e., some \\(S\\) are \\(P)\\), as well as\nthe satisfaction conditions of the existential quantifier and copula; a\nbiological factor, which is reflected in the satisfaction conditions\nfor the predicate \u2018is human\u2019; and a normative factor, which\nis reflected in the satisfaction conditions for the predicates\n\u2018is disadvantaged\u2019 and \u2018is vain\u2019. But whereas\n(34) involves a psychological factor, which is reflected in the\nsatisfaction conditions for \u2018is vain\u2019, (33) does not. Also,\n(33) may involve a socioeconomic factor, which is reflected in the\nsatisfaction conditions for \u2018is disadvantaged\u2019, whereas\n(34) does not.\n\n\nBy focusing on subsentential factors instead of supersentential\nregions of discourse, Sher offers a more fine-grained way to\nindividuate ways in which true sentences correspond. (Sher supposes\nthat we cannot name the correspondent of a given true sentence since\nthere is no single discrete hypostatized entity beyond the\n\\(n\\)-tuples of objects, properties and relations, functions,\nstructures (complexes, configurations), etc. that already populate\nreality.) The upshot is a putative solution to problems of mixed\ndiscourse (see \u00a74 below): the truth of sentences like\n\n(35) Some humans are disadvantaged and vain.\n\n\n\nis determined by all of the above factors, and which\nis\u2014despite the large overlap\u2014a different kind of truth than\neither of the atomic sentences (33) and (34), according to Sher.\n\n\nFor their part, Horgan and colleagues propose a twist on the\ncorrespondence theorist\u2019s claim that truth consists in a\ncorrespondence relation \\(R\\) obtaining between a given\ntruth-bearer and a fact. They propose that there are exactly two\nspecies of the relation \\(R\\): \u2018direct\u2019\n(\\(R_{dir}\\)) and \u2018indirect correspondence\u2019\n(\\(R_{ind}\\)), and thus exactly two ways of being true.\nFor Horgan and colleagues, which species of \\(R\\)\u2014and thus\nwhich way of being true\u2014obtains will depend on the austerity of\nontological commitments involved in assessing sentences; in turn, which\ncommitments are involved depends on discursive context and operative\nsemantic standards. For example, an austere ontology commits to only a\nsingle extant object: namely, the world (affectionally termed the\n\u2018blobject\u2019). Truths about the blobject, such as\n\n(36) The world is all that is the case.\n\n\n\nif it is one, correspond to it directly. Truths about things other\nthan the blobject correspond to them indirectly. For example, sentences\nsuch as\n\n(37) Online universities are universities.\n\n\n\nmay be true even if the extension of the predicate\n\u2018university\u2019 is\u2014strictly speaking\u2014empty or what\nis referred to by \u2018online universities\u2019 is not in the\nnon-empty extension of \u2018university\u2019. In short, \\(p\\) is\ntrue\\(_1\\) iff \\(p\\) is \\(R_{dir}\\)-related to the\nblobject given contextually operative standards \\(c_i,\nc_j , \\ldots ,c_m\\).\nAlternatively, \\(p\\) is true\\(_2\\) iff \\(p\\) is\n\\(R_{ind}\\)-related to non-blobject entities given\ncontextually operative standards \\(c_j,\nc_k , \\ldots ,c_n\\). So, truth\nalways consists in correspondence. But the two types of correspondence\nimply that there is more than one way of being true.\n4. Objections to pluralism and responses\n4.1 Ambiguity\n\n\nSome take pluralists to be committed to the thesis that\n\u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous: since the pluralist thinks that there\nis a range of alethically potent properties (correspondence, coherence,\netc.), \u2018true\u2019 must be ambiguous between these different\nproperties. This is thought to raise problems for pluralists. According\nto one objection, the pluralist appears caught in a grave dilemma.\n\u2018True\u2019 is either ambiguous or unambiguous. If it is, then\nthere is a spate of further problems awaiting (see\n\u00a74.4\u2013\u00a74.6 below). If it is not, then there is only one\nmeaning of \u2018true\u2019 and thus only one property designated by\nit; so pluralism is false.\n\n\nFriends of pluralism have tended to self-consciously distance\nthemselves from the claim that \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous (e.g.,\nWright 1996: 924, 2001; Lynch 2001, 2004b, 2005c). Generally, however,\nthe issue of ambiguity for pluralism has not been well-analyzed. Yet,\none response has been investigated in some detail. According to this\nresponse, the ambiguity of \u2018true\u2019 is simply to be taken as\na datum. \u2018True\u2019 is de facto ambiguous (see, e.g., Schiller\n1906; Pratt 1908; Kaufmann 1948; Lucas 1969; K\u00f6lbel 2002, 2008;\nSher 2005; Wright 2010). Alfred Tarski, for instance, wrote:\n\n\n\nThe word \u2018true\u2019, like other words from our everyday\nlanguage, is certainly not unambiguous. [\u2026] We should reconcile\nourselves with the fact that we are confronted, not with one concept,\nbut with several different concepts which are denoted by one word; we\nshould try to make these concepts as clear as possible (by means of\ndefinition, or of an axiomatic procedure, or in some other way); to\navoid further confusion we should agree to use different terms for\ndifferent concepts [\u2026]. (1944: 342, 355)\n\n\n\nIf \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous de facto, as some authors have\nsuggested, then the ambiguity objection may turn out to\nbe\u2014again\u2014not so much an objection or disconfirmation of the\ntheory, but rather just a datum about \u2018truth\u2019-talk in\nnatural language that should be explained or explained away by theories\nof truth. In that case, pluralists seem no worse off\u2014and possibly\nbetter\u2014than any number of other truth theorists.\n\n\nA second possible line of response from pluralists is that their\nview is not necessarily inconsistent with a monistic account of either\nthe meaning of \u2018true\u2019 or the concept TRUTH. After all,\n\u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous only if it can be assigned more than\none meaning or semantic structure; and it has more than one meaning\nonly if there is more than one stable conceptualization or concept\nTRUTH supporting each numerically distinct meaning. Yet, nothing about\nthe claim that there is more than one way of being true entails, by\nitself, that there is more than one concept TRUTH. In principle, the\nnature of properties like being true\u2014whether homomorphism,\nsuperassertibility, coherence, etc.\u2014may outstrip the concept\nthereof, just as the nature of properties like being water\u2014such\nas H\\(_2\\)O, H\\(_3\\)O, XYZ, etc.\u2014may outstrip the\nconcept WATER (see, e.g., Wright 1996, 2001; Alston 2002; Lynch 2001,\n2005c, 2006). Nor is monism about truth necessarily inconsistent with\nsemantic or conceptual pluralism. The supposition that TRUTH is both\nmany and one (i.e., \u2018moderate monism\u2019) neither rules out\nthe construction of multiple concepts or meanings thereof, nor rules\nout the proliferation of uses to express those concepts or meanings.\nFor example, suppose that the only way of being true turns out to be a\nstructural relation \\(R\\) between reality and certain\nrepresentations thereof. Such a case is consistent with the existence\nof competing conceptions of what \\(R\\) consists in: weak\nhomomorphism, isomorphism, \u2018seriously dyadic\u2019\ncorrespondence, a causal \\(n\\)-place correspondence relation, etc.\nA more sensitive conclusion, then, is just that the objection from\nambiguity is an objection to conceptual or semantic pluralism, not to\nany alethic theory\u2014pluralism or otherwise.\n4.2 The scope problem as a pseudo-problem\n\n\nAccording to the so-called \u2018Quine-Sainsbury objection\u2019,\npluralists\u2019 postulation of ambiguity in metalinguistic alethic\nterms is not actually necessary, and thus not well-motivated. This is\nbecause taxonomical differences among kinds of truths in different\ndomains can be accounted for simply by doing basic ontology in\nobject-level languages.\n\n\n\n[E]ven if it is one thing for \u2018this tree is an oak\u2019 to\nbe true, another thing for \u2018burning live cats is cruel\u2019 to\nbe true, and yet another for \u2018Buster Keaton is funnier than\nCharlie Chaplin\u2019 to be true, this should not lead us to suppose\nthat \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous; for we get a better explanation\nof the differences by alluding to the differences between trees,\ncruelty, and humor. (Sainsbury 1996: 900; see also Quine 1960: 131)\n\n\n\nGenerally, pluralists have not yet developed a response to the\nQuine-Sainsbury objection. And for some, this is because the real force\nof the Quine-Sainsbury objection lies in its exposure of the scope\nproblem as a pseudo-problem (Dodd 2013; see also Asay 2018). Again, the idea is that\ntraditional inflationary theories postulate some candidate for\n\\(F\\) but the applicability and plausibility of \\(F\\) differs\nacross regions of discourse. No such theory handles the truths of\nmoral, mathematical, comic, legal, etc. discourse equally well; and\nthis suggests that these theories, by their monism, face limitations on\ntheir explanatory scope. Pluralism offers a non-deflationary solution.\nYet, why think that these differences among domains mark an alethic\ndifference in truth per se, rather than semantic or discursive\ndifferences among the sentences comprising those domains? There is more\nthan one way to score a goal in soccer, for example (via corner kick,\nricochet off the foot of an opposing player or the head of a teammate,\nobstruct the goalkeeper, etc.), but it is far from clear that this\nentails pluralism about the property of scoring a goal in soccer.\n(Analogy belongs to an anonymous referee.) Pluralists have yet to\nadequately address this criticism (although see Blackburn 2013; Lynch 2013b, 2018; Wright 1998 for further discussion).\n4.3 The criteria problem\n\n\nPluralists who invoke platitude-based strategies bear the burden of\narticulating inclusion and exclusion criteria for determining which\nexpressions do, or do not, count as members of the essential subset of\nplatitudes upon which this strategy is based (Wright, 2005). Candidates\ninclude: ordinariness, intuitiveness, uninformativeness, wide use or\ncitation, uncontroversiality, a prioricity, analyticity,\nindefeasibility, incontrovertibility, and sundry others. But none has\nproven to be uniquely adequate, and there is nothing close to a\nconsensus about which criteria to rely on.\n\n\nFor instance, consider the following two conceptions. One conception\ntakes platitudes about \\(x\\) to be expressions that must be\nendorsed on pain of being linguistically incompetent with the\napplication of the terms \\(t_1 , \\ldots ,t_n\\) used to talk about \\(x\\) (Nolan 2009).\nHowever, this conception does not readily allow for disagreement: prima\nfacie, it is not incoherent to think that two individuals, each of whom\nis competent with the application of\n\\(t_1 (x), \\ldots ,t_n (x)\\), may differ as to whether some \\(p\\)\nmust be endorsed or whether some expression is genuinely platitudinous.\nFor instance, consider the platitude in (17), which connects being\ntrue with corresponding with reality. Being linguistically competent\nwith terms for structural relations like correspondence does not force\nendorsement of claims that connect truth with correspondence; no one\nnot already in the grip of the correspondence theory would suppose that\nthey must endorse (17), and those who oppose it would certainly suppose\notherwise. Further inadequacies beleaguer this conception. It makes no\nprovision for degrees of either endorsement or linguistic incompetence.\nIt makes no distinction between theoretical and non-theoretical terms,\nmuch less restrict \\(t_1 (x), \\ldots ,t_n (x)\\) to non-theoretical terms. Nor does\nit require that platitudes themselves be true. On one hand, this\nconsequently leaves open the possibility that universally-endorsed but\nfalse or otherwise alethically defective expressions are included in\nthe platitude-based analysis of \u2018true\u2019. An old platitude\nabout whales, for example\u2014one which was universally endorsed on\npain of being linguistically incompetent\u2014prior to whales being\nclassified as cetaceans\u2014was that they are big fish. The worry,\nthen, is that the criteria may allow us to screen in certain\n\u2018fish stories\u2019 about truth. This would be a major problem\nfor advocates of Ramsification and other forms of implicit definition,\nsince those techniques work only on the presupposition that all input\nbeing Ramsified over or implicitly defined is itself true (Wright\n2010). On the other hand, making explicit that platitudes must also be\ntrue seems to entail that they are genuine \u2018truisms\u2019\n(Lynch 2005c), though discovering which ones are truly indefeasible is\na further difficulty\u2014one made more difficult by the possibility\nof error theories (e.g., Devlin 2003) suggesting that instances of the\n\\(T\\)-schema are universally false. Indeed, we are inclined to say\ninstances of disquotational, equivalence, and operator schemas are\nsurely candidates for being platitudinous if anything is; but to say\nthat they must be endorsed on pain of being linguistically incompetent\nis to rule out a priori error theories about instances of the\n\\(T\\)-schema.\n\n\nA second, closely related conception is that platitudes are\nexpressions, which\u2014in virtue of being banal, vacuous, elementary,\nor otherwise trivial\u2014are acceptable by anyone who understands\nthem (Horwich 1990). The interaction of banality or triviality with\nacceptance does rule out a wide variety of candidate expressions,\nhowever. For instance, claims that are acceptable by anyone who\nunderstands them may still be too substantive or informative to count\nas platitudinous, depending on what they countenance. Similarly, claims\nthat are too \u2018thin\u2019 or neutral to vindicate any particular\ntheory \\(T\\) may still be too substantive or informative to count\nas genuinely platitudinous on this conception (Wright 1999). This is\nparticularly so given that nothing about a conception of platitudes as\n\u2018pretheoretical claims\u2019 strictly entails that they reduce\nto mere banalities (Vision 2004). Nevertheless, criteria like banality\nor triviality plus acceptance might also screen in too few expressions\n(perhaps as few as one, such as a particular instance of the\n\\(T\\)-schema). Indeed, it is an open question whether any of the\nprinciples in (11)\u2013(28) would count as platitudes on this\nconception.\n\n\nAn alternative conception emphasizes that the criteria should\ninstead be the interaction of informality, truth, a prioricity, or\nperhaps even analyticity (Wright 2001: 759). In particular, platitudes\nneed not take the form of an identity claim, equational definition, or\na material biconditional. At the extreme, expressions can be as\ncolloquial as you please so long as they remain true a priori (or\nanalytically). These latter criteria are commonly appealed to, but are\nalso not without problems. Firstly, a common worry is whether there are\nany strictly analytic truths about truth, and, if there are, whether\nthey can perform any serious theoretical work. Secondly, these latter\ncriteria would exclude certain truths that are a posteriori but no less\nuseful to a platitude-based strategist.\n4.4 The instability challenge\n\n\nAnother objection to pluralism is that it is an inherently instable\nview: i.e., as soon as the view is formulated, simple reasoning renders\nit untenable (Pedersen 2006, 2010; see also Tappolet 1997, 2000; Wright\n2012). This so-called instability challenge can be presented\nas follows. According to the moderate pluralist, there is more than one\ntruth property \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). Yet, given \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), it seems we should recognize another truth\nproperty:\n\n(38)\n \\(\\forall p[F_U (p) \\leftrightarrow F_1 (p) \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n (p)]\\).\n\n\n\nObserve that \\(F_U\\) is not merely some property\npossessed by every \\(p\\) which happens to have one of\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). (The property\nof being a sentence is one such a property, but it poses no trouble to\nthe pluralist.) Rather, \\(F_U\\) must be an alethic\nproperty whose extension perfectly positively covaries with the\ncombined extension of the pluralist truth properties\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). And since\nnothing is required for the existence of this new property other than\nthe truth properties already granted by the pluralist, (38) gives a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for \\(F_U\\) to be had\nby some \\(p\\): a sentence \\(p\\) is \\(F_U\\) just in case \\(p\\) is\n\\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). Thus,\nany sentence that is any of \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) may be true in some more generic or universal\nway, \\(F_U\\). This suggests, at best, that strong\npluralism is false, and moderate monism is true; and at worst, there\nseems to be something instable, or self-refuting, about pluralism.\n\n\nPluralists can make concessive or non-concessive responses to the\ninstability challenge. A concessive response grants that such a truth\nproperty exists, but maintains that it poses no serious threat to\npluralism. A non-concessive response is one intended to rebut the\nchallenge, e.g., by rejecting the existence of a common or universal\ntruth property. One way of trying to motivate this rejection of\n\\(F_U\\) is by attending to the distinction between\nsparse and abundant properties, and then demonstrating that alethic\nproperties like truth must be sparse and additionally argue that the\nwould-be trouble-maker \\(F_U\\) is an abundant property.\nAccording to sparse property theorists, individuals must be unified by\nsome qualitative similarity in order to share a property. For example,\nall even numbers are qualitatively similar in that they share the\nproperty of being divisible by two without remainder. Now, consider a\nsubset of very diverse properties \\(G_1 , \\ldots ,G_n\\) possessed by an individual \\(a\\). Is there\nsome further, single property of being \\(G_1\\), or\n\u2026, or \\(G_n\\) that \\(a\\) has? Such a further\nproperty, were it to exist, would be highly disjunctive; and it may\nseem unclear what, if anything, individuals that were\n\\(G_1\\), or \u2026, or \\(G_n\\) would\nhave in common\u2014other than being \\(G_1\\), or\n\u2026, or \\(G_n\\). According to sparse property\ntheorists, the lack of qualitative similarity means that this putative\ndisjunctive property is not a property properly so-called. Abundant\nproperty theorists, on the other hand, deny that qualitative similarity\nis needed in order for a range of individuals to share a property.\nProperties can be as disjunctive as you like. Indeed, for any set\n\\(A\\) there is at least one property had by all members of\n\\(A\\)\u2014namely, being a member of \\(A\\). And since there\nis a set of all things that have some disjunctive property, there is a\nproperty\u2014abundantly construed\u2014had by exactly those things.\nIt thus seems difficult to deny the existence of \\(F_U\\)\nif the abundant conception of properties is adopted. So pluralists who\nwant to give a non-concessive response to the metaphysical instability\nchallenge may want to endorse the sparse conception (Pedersen 2006).\nThis is because the lack of uniformity in the nature of truth across\ndomains is underwritten by a lack of qualitative similarity between the\ndifferent truth properties that apply to specific domains of discourse.\nThe truth property \\(F_U\\) does not exist, because truth\nproperties are to be thought of in accordance with the sparse\nconception.\n\n\nEven if the sparse conception fails to ground pluralists\u2019\nrejection of the existence of the universal truth property\n\\(F_U\\), a concessive response to the instability\nchallenge is still available. Pluralists can make a strong case that\nthe truth properties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) are more fundamental than the universal truth\nproperty \\(F_U\\) (Pedersen 2010). This is because\n\\(F_U\\) is metaphysically dependent on\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), in the sense\nthat \\(F_U\\) is introduced in virtue of its being one of\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), and not\nvice-versa. Hence, even if the pluralist commits to the existence of\n\\(F_U\\)\u2014and hence, to moderate metaphysical\nmonism\u2014there is still a clear sense in which her view is\ndistinctively more pluralist than monist.\n4.5 Problems regarding mixed discourse\n4.5.1 Mixed atomic sentences\n\n\nThe content of some atomic sentences seems to hark exclusively from\na particular region of discourse. For instance, \u2018lactose is a\nsugar\u2019 concerns chemical reality, while \u2018\\(7 + 5 = 12\\)\u2019\nis solely about the realm of numbers (and operations on these). Not all\ndiscourse is pure or exclusive, however; we often engage in so-called\n\u2018mixed discourse\u2019, in which contents from different regions\nof discourse are combined. For example, consider:\n\n(39) Causing pain is bad.\n\n\n\nMixed atomic sentences such as (39) are thought to pose problems for\npluralists. It seems to implicate concepts from the physical domain\n(causation), the mental domain (pain), and the moral domain (badness)\n(Sher 2005: 321\u201322). Yet, if pluralism is correct, then in which\nway is (39) true? Is it true in the way appropriate to talk of the\nphysical, the mental, or the moral? Is it true in neither of these\nways, or in all of these three ways, or in some altogether different\nway?\n\n\nThe source of the problem may be the difficulty in classifying\ndiscursive content\u2014a classificatory task that is an urgent one\nfor pluralists. For it is unclear how they can maintain that regions of\ndiscourse \\(D_1 , \\ldots ,D_n\\)\npartially determine the ways in which sentences can be true without a\nprocedure for determining which region of discourse\n\\(D_i\\) a given \\(p\\) belongs to.\n\n\nOne suggestion is that a mixed atomic sentence \\(p\\) belongs to\nno particular domain. Another is that it belongs to several (Wyatt 2013). Lynch (2005b:\n340\u201341) suggested paraphrasing mixed atomic sentences as\nsentences that are classifiable as belonging to particular domains. For\nexample, (39) might be paraphrased as:\n\n(40) We ought not cause pain.\n\n\n\nUnlike (39), the paraphrased (40) appears to be a pure atomic\nsentence belonging to the domain of morals. This proposal remains\nunderdeveloped, however. It is not at all clear that (40) counts as a\nfelicitous paraphrase of (39), and, more generally, unclear whether all\nmixed atomic sentences can be paraphrased such that they belong to just\none domain without thereby altering their meaning, truth-conditions, or\ntruth-values.\n\n\nAnother possible solution addresses the problem head-on by\nquestioning whether atomic sentences really are mixed, thereby denying\nthe need for any such paraphrases. Consider the following\nsentences:\n\n(41) The Mona Lisa is beautiful.\n\n(42) Speeding is illegal.\n\n\nPrima facie, what determines the domain-membership of (41) and (42)\nis the aesthetic and legal predicates \u2018is beautiful\u2019 and\n\u2018is illegal\u2019, respectively. It is an aesthetic matter\nwhether the Mona Lisa is beautiful; this is because (41) is true in\nsome way just in case the Mona Lisa falls in the extension of the\naesthetic predicate \u2018is beautiful\u2019 (and mutatis mutandis\nfor (42)). In the same way, we might take (39) to exclusively belong to\nthe moral domain given that the moral predicate \u2018is\nbad\u2019. (This solution was presented in the first 2012 version of this entry; see Edwards 2018a for later, more detailed treatment.)\n\n\nIt is crucial to the latter two proposals that any given mixed\natomic sentence \\(p\\) has its domain membership essentially, since such\nmembership is what determines the relevant kind of truth. Sher (2005,\n2011) deals with the problem of mixed atomic sentences differently. On\nher view, the truth of a mixed atomic sentence is not accounted for by\nmembership to some specific domain; rather the \u2018factors\u2019\ninvolved in the sentence determine a specific form of correspondence,\nand this specific form of correspondence is what accounts for the truth\nof \\(p\\). The details about which specific form of correspondence obtains\nis determined at the sub-sentential levels of reference, satisfaction,\nand fulfillment. For example, the form of correspondence that accounts\nfor the truth of (39) obtains as a combination of the physical\nfulfillment of \u2018the causing of \\(x\\)\u2019, the mental\nreference of \u2018pain\u2019, and the moral satisfaction of\n\u2018\\(x\\) is bad\u2019 (2005: 328). No paraphrase is\nneeded.\n4.5.2 Mixed compounds\n\n\nAnother related problem pertains to two or more sentences joined by\none or more logical connectives, as in\n\n(43) Killing innocent people is wrong and \\(7 + 5 = 12\\).\n\n\n\nUnlike atomic sentences, the mixing here takes place at the\nsentential rather than sub-sentential level: (43) is a conjunction,\nwhich mixes the pure sentence \u2018\\(7 + 5 = 12\\)\u2019 with the pure\nsentence \u2018killing innocent people is wrong\u2019. (There are, of\ncourse, also mixed compounds that involve mixed atomic sentences.) For\nmany theorists, each conjunct seems to be true in a different way, if\ntrue at all: the first conjunct in whatever way is appropriate to moral\ntheory, and the second conjunct in whatever way is appropriate to\narithmetic. But then, how is the pluralist going to account for the\ntruth of the conjunction (Tappolet 2000: 384)? Pluralists owe an answer\nto the question of which way, exactly, a conjunction is true when its\nconjuncts are true in different ways.\n\n\nAdditional complications arise for pluralists who commit to facts\nbeing what make sentences true (e.g., Lynch 2001: 730), or other such\ntruth-maker or -making theses. Prima facie, we would reasonably expect\nthere to be different kinds of facts that make the conjuncts of (43)\ntrue, and which subsequently account for the differences in their\ndifferent ways of being true. However, what fact or facts makes true\nthe mixed compound? Regarding (43), is it the mathematical fact, the\nmoral fact, or some further kind of fact? On one hand, the claims that\nmathematical or moral facts, respectively, make \\(p\\) true seem to betray\nthe thought that both facts contribute equally to the truth of the\nmixed compound. On the other hand, the claim that some third\n\u2018mixed\u2019 kind of fact makes \\(p\\) true leaves the pluralist with\nthe uneasy task of telling a rather alchemist story about\nfact-mixtures.\n\n\nFunctionalists about truth (e.g., Lynch 2005b: 396\u201397) propose\nto deal with compounds by distinguishing between two kinds of realizers\nof the \\(F\\)-role. The first is an atomic realizer, such that an\natomic proposition \\(p\\) is true iff \\(p\\) has a property that realizes the\n\\(F\\)-role. The second is a compound realizer, such that a\ncompound \\(q * r\\) (where \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) may themselves be complex) is true\niff\n\n(44)  \\({*} = \\wedge : q \\wedge r\\) has the property of being an instance of\nthe truth-function for conjunction with conjuncts that both have a\nproperty that realizes the \\(F\\)-role.\n\n(45)  \\({*} = \\vee : q \\vee r\\) has the property of being an instance of the\ntruth-function for disjunction with at least one disjunct that has a\nproperty that realizes the \\(F\\)-role.\n(46)  \\({*} = \\rightarrow : q \\rightarrow r\\) has the property of being an\ninstance of the truth-function for material conditional with an\nantecedent that does not have the property that realizes the\n\\(F\\)-role for its domain or a consequent that has a property that\nrealizes the \\(F\\)-role.\n\n\nThe realizers for atomic sentences are properties like\ncorrespondence, coherence, and superwarrant. The realizer properties\nfor compounds are special, in the sense that realizer properties for a\ngiven kind of compound are only had by compounds of that kind. Witness\nthat each of these compound realizer properties requires any of its\nbearers to be an instance of a specific truth-function. Pure and mixed\ncompounds are treated equally on this proposal: when true, they are\ntrue because they instantiate the truth-function for conjunction,\nhaving two or more conjuncts that have a property that realizes the\n\\(F\\)-role (and mutatis mutandis for disjunctions and material\nconditionals).\n\n\nHowever, this functionalist solution to the problem of mixed\ncompounds relies heavily on that theory\u2019s monism\u2014i.e., its\ninsistence that the single role property \\(F\\) is a universal\ntruth property. This might leave one wondering whether a solution is\nreadily available to someone who rejects the existence of such a\nproperty. One strategy is simply to identify the truth of conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals with the kind of properties specified by (44), (45), and (46), respectively (as opposed to taking them to be realizers of a single truth property). Thus, e.g., the truth of any conjunction simply \\(is\\) to be an instance of the truth-function for conjunction with conjuncts that have the property that plays the \\(F\\)-role for them (Kim & Pedersen 2018, Pedersen & Lynch 2018 (Sect. 20.6.2.1). Another strategy is to try to use the resources of multi-valued logic. For example, one can posit an ordered set of designated\nvalues for each way of being true \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) (perhaps according to their status as\n\u2018heavyweight\u2019 or \u2018lightweight\u2019), and then take\nconjunction to be a minimizing operation and disjunction a maximizing\none, i.e., \\(v(p \\wedge q) = \\min\\{v(p), v(q)\\}\\)\nand \\(v(p \\vee q) = \\max\\{v(p), v(q)\\}\\).\nResultingly, each conjunction and disjunction\u2014whether pure or\nmixed\u2014will be either true in some way or false in some way\nstraightforwardly determined by the values of the constituents. For\nexample, consider the sentences\n\n(47) Heat is mean molecular kinetic energy.\n\n(48) Manslaughter is a felony.\n\n\nSuppose that (47) is true in virtue of corresponding to physical\nreality, while (48) true in virtue of cohering with a body of law; and\nsuppose further that correspondence \\((F_1)\\) is more\n\u2018heavyweight\u2019 than coherence \\((F_2)\\).\nSince conjunction is a minimizing operation and \\(F_2 \\lt F_1\\), then \u2018heat is mean molecular\nkinetic energy and manslaughter is a felony\u2019 will be\n\\(F_2\\). Since disjunction is a maximizing operation,\nthen \u2018heat is mean molecular kinetic energy or manslaughter is a\nfelony\u2019 will be \\(F_1\\).\n\n\nThe many-valued solution to the problem of mixed compounds just\noutlined is formally adequate because it determines a way that each\ncompound is true. However, while interesting, the proposal needs to be\nsubstantially developed in several respects. For example, how is\nnegation treated\u2014are there several negations, one for each way of\nbeing true, or is there a single negation? Also, taking \u2018heat is\nmean molecular kinetic energy and manslaughter is a felony\u2019 to be\ntrue in the way appropriate to law betrays a thought that seems at\nleast initially compelling, viz. that both conjuncts\ncontribute to the truth of the conjunction. Alternatively, one could\ntake mixed compounds to be true in some third way. However, this would\nleave the pluralist with the task of telling some story about how this\nthird way of being true relates to the other two. Again substantial\nwork needs to be done.\n\n\nEdwards (2008) proposed another solution to the problem of mixed\nconjunctions, the main idea of which is to appeal to the following\nbiconditional schema:\n\n(49) \\(p\\) is true\\(_i\\) and \\(q\\) is true\\(_j\\) iff \\(p \\wedge q\\)\nis true\\(_k\\).\n\n\n\nEdwards suggests that pluralists can answer the challenge that mixed\nconjunctions pose by reading the stated biconditional as having an\norder of determination: \\(p \\wedge q\\) is true\\(_k\\) in\nvirtue of \\(p\\)\u2019s being true\\(_i\\) and \\(q\\)\u2019s being\ntrue\\(_j\\), but not vice-versa. This, he maintains,\nexplains what kind of truth a conjunction \\(p \\wedge q\\) has when its\nconjuncts are true in different ways; for the conjunction is\ntrue\\(_k\\) in virtue of having conjuncts that are both\ntrue, where it is inessential whether the conjuncts are true in the\nsame way. Truth\\(_k\\) is a further way of being true\nthat depends on the conjuncts being true in some way without reducing\nto either of them. The property true\\(_k\\) is thus not a\ngeneric or universal truth property that applies to the conjuncts as\nwell as the conjunction.\n\n\nAs Cotnoir (2009) emphasizes, Edwards\u2019 proposal provides too\nlittle information about the nature of true\\(_k\\). What\nlittle is provided makes transparent the commitment to\ntrue\\(_k\\)\u2019s being a truth property had only by\nconjunctions, in which case it is unclear whether Edwards\u2019s\nsolution can generalize. In this regard, Edwards\u2019 proposal is\nsimilar to Lynch\u2019s functionalist proposal, which is committed to\nthere being a specific realizer property for each type of logical\ncompound.\n4.5.3 Mixed inferences\n\n\nMixed inferences\u2014inferences involving truth-apt sentences from\ndifferent domains\u2014appear to be yet another problem for the\npluralist (Tappolet 1997, 2000; Pedersen 2006). One can illustrate the\nproblem by supposing, with the pluralist, that there are two ways of\nbeing true, one of which is predicated of the antecedent of a\nconditional and the other as its consequent. It can be left open in\nwhat way the conditional itself is true. Consider the following\ninference:\n\n(50) Satiated dogs are lazy.\n\n(51) Our dog is satiated.\n(52) Our dog is lazy.\n\n\nThis inference would appear to be valid. However, it is not clear\nthat pluralists can account for its validity by relying on the standard\ncharacterization of validity as necessary truth preservation from\npremises to conclusion. Given that the truth properties applicable to\nrespectively (51) and (52) are different, what truth property is\npreserved in the inference? The pluralist owes an explanation of how\nthe thesis that there are many ways of being true can account for the\nvalidity of mixed inferences.\n\n\nBeall (2000) argued that the account of validity used in\nmulti-valued logics gives pluralists the resources to deal with the\nproblem of mixed inferences. For many-valued logics, validity is\naccounted for in terms of preservation of designated value, where\ndesignated values can be thought of as ways of being true, while\nnon-designated values can be thought of as ways of being false.\nAdopting a designated-value account of validity, pluralists can simply\ntake \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) to be the\nrelevant designated values and define an inference as valid just in\ncase the conclusion is designated if each premise is designated (i.e.,\none of \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n)\\). On\nthis account, the validity of (mixed) arguments whose premises and\nconclusion concern different regions of discourse is evaluable in terms\nof more than one of \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\); the validity of (pure) arguments whose premises\nand conclusion pertain to the same region of discourse is evaluable in\nterms of the same \\(F_i\\) (where \\(1 \\le i \\le n)\\). An immediate rejoinder is that the term\n\u2018true\u2019 in \u2018ways of being true\u2019 refers to a\nuniversal way of being true\u2014i.e., being designated simpliciter\n(Tappolet 2000: 384). If so, then the multi-valued solution comes at\nthe cost of inadvertently acknowledging a universal truth property. Of\ncourse, as noted, the existence of a universal truth property poses a\nthreat only to strong pluralism.\n4.5 The problem of generalization\n\n\nAlethic terms are useful devices for generalizing. For instance,\nsuppose we wish to state the law of excluded middle. A tedious way\nwould be to produce a long\u2014indeed,\ninfinite\u2014conjunction:\n\n(53) Everything is either actual or non-actual, and thick or not\nthick, and red or not red, and \u2026\n\n\n\nHowever, given the equivalence schema for propositions,\n\n(54) The proposition that \\(p\\) is true iff \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nthere is a much shorter formula, which captures what (54) is meant\nto express by using \u2018true\u2019, but without loss of explanatory\npower (Horwich 1990: 4):\n\n(55) Every proposition of the form \\(\\langle\\)everything is \\(G\\) or\nnot\\(-G\\rangle\\) is true.\n\n\n\nAlethic terms are also useful devices for generalizing over what\nspeakers say, as in\n\n(56) What Chen said is true.\n\n\n\nThe utility of a generalization like (56) is not so much that it\neliminates the need to rely on an infinite conjunction, but that it is\n\u2018blind\u2019 (i.e., made under partial ignorance of what was\nsaid).\n\n\nPluralists seem to have difficulty accounting for truth\u2019s use\nas a device for generalization. One response is to simply treat uses of\n\u2018is true\u2019 as elliptical for \u2018is true in one way or\nanother\u2019. In doing so, pluralists account for generalization\nwithout sacrificing their pluralism. A possible drawback, however, is\nthat it may commit pluralists to the claim that \u2018true\u2019\ndesignates the disjunctive property of being \\(F_1\n\\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). Granting the existence of\nsuch a property gives pluralists a story to tell about generalizations\nlike (55) and (56), but the response is a concessive one available only\nto moderate pluralists. However, as noted in \u00a74.2.3, the existence\nof such a property is not a devastating blow to all pluralists, since\nthe domain-specific truth properties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) remain explanatorily basic in relation to the\nproperty of being \\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\).\n4.6 The problem of normativity\n\n\nAs is often noted, truth appears to be normative\u2014i.e., a\npositive standard governing immanent content (Sher 2004:\n26). According to one prominent tradition (Engel 2002, 2013;\nWedgwood 2002; Boghossian 2003; Shah 2003; Gibbard 2005; Ferrari 2018; Lynch 2009; Whiting 2013),\ntruth is a doxastic norm because it is the norm of correctness for\nbelief:\n\n(57) \\(\\forall p\\)(a belief that \\(p\\) is correct iff \\(p\\) is true).\n\n\n\nIndeed, many take it to be constitutive of belief that its norm of\ncorrectness is truth\u2014i.e., part of what makes belief the kind of\nattitude that it is. If correctness is understood in\nprescriptive\u2014rather than descriptive\u2014terms, then (57)\npresumably gives way to the following schema:\n\n(58) \\(\\forall p\\)(one ought to believe\nthat \\(p\\) when \\(p\\) is true).\n\n\n\nA third normative schema linking truth and belief classifies truth\nas a good of belief (Lynch, 2004a, 2005b: 390, 2009: 10; David\n2005):\n\n(59) \\(\\forall p\\)(it is prima facie good to\nbelieve that \\(p\\) when \\(p\\) is true).\n\n\n\nWhat these schemas suggest is that the apparent doxastic and\nassertoric normativity of truth appears to be entirely general, in a\nmanner analogous to which winning appears to be a general norm that\napplies to any competitive game (Dummett 1978: 8; Lynch 2005b: 390).\nHence, if \\(p\\) is true, then it is correct and good to believe that \\(p\\), and\none should believe that \\(p\\)\u2014regardless of whether \\(p\\) concerns\nfashion or physics, comedy or chemistry. And again, the generalized\nnormativity of truth appears to make trouble for pluralists, insofar as\nthe thesis that there are several ways of being true apparently implies\na proliferation of doxastic truth norms. Yet, instead of truth being\nthe single normative property mentioned in (57), (58), and (59), the\npluralist commits to a wide variety of norms\u2014one for each\ndomain-specific truth property \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). For example, for any given trigonometric\nstatement p, it is prima facie good to believe \\(p\\) when \\(p\\) is true in the\nway appropriate to trigonometry, while the prima facie goodness of\nbelieving a truth about antibodies is tied to whatever truth property\nis apropos to immunology. Hence, whereas the normative aspects of truth\nseem characterized by unity, pluralism renders disunity.\n\n\nAs before, a concessive response can be given by granting the\nexistence of a disjunctive, universal truth property: the normative\nproperty of being \\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). Although this amounts to an endorsement\nmoderate pluralism, it poses no threat to the importance of the\ndomain-specific norms \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), insofar as these properties are explanatorily\nmore basic than the normative property of being \\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). However, at the same time,\nthey do provide the unity needed to maintain that the predicate is\ntrue in (57), (58), and (59) denotes a single, universally\napplicable norm:\n\n(60) \\(\\forall p\\)(a belief that \\(p\\) is correct iff \\(p\\) is\n\\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n)\\).\n\n(61) \\(\\forall p\\)(one ought to believe \\(p\\) when \\(p\\) is\n\\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n)\\).\n(62) \\(\\forall p\\)(it is prima facie good to believe that \\(p\\) when \\(p\\) is\n\\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n)\\).\n\n\nLikewise, functionalists once again respond to the challenge by\ninvoking the monist aspect of their view. There is a single normative\nproperty\u2014the property of having a property that realizes the\n\\(F\\)-role\u2014that delivers a uniform understanding of (57),\n(58), and (59).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Acton, Harry, 1935, \u201cThe correspondence theory of\ntruth,\u201d <em>Proceedings of the</em>\n<em>Aristotelian Society</em>, 35: 177\u2013194.", "Alston, William, 2002, \u201cTruth: concept and property,\u201d\nin Richard Shantz (ed.), <em>What is Truth?</em>, Berlin: Walter de\nGruyter, pp. 11\u201326.", "Asay, Jamin, 2018, \u201cPutting pluralism in its place,\u201d <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, 96: 175\u2013191.", "Barnard, Robert &amp;
