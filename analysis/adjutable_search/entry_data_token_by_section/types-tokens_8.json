    "main_text": "What is a Type? || What is a Word?\n4.2 What is a Word?\n\n\nNo general theory of types can tell us what we often want to know\nwhen we ask: what is a species, a symphony, a word, a poem, or a\ndisease? Such questions are just as difficult to answer as what a type\nis in general. Even if types were sets, for example, set theory by\nitself will not answer the burning question of which set a species is.\nOne would then have to go to biology and philosophy of biology to find\nout whether a species is (i) \u201ca set of individuals closely\nresembling each other\u201d as Darwin (1859, p. 52) would have it, (ii)\na set of \u201cindividuals sharing the same genetic code\u201d as\nPutnam (1975, p. 239) would have it, (iii) a set of \u201cinterbreeding\nnatural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such\ngroups\u201d, as Mayr (1970, p. 12) would have it, or (iv) a set\ncomprising \u201ca lineage evolving separately from others and with\nits own unitary evolutionary role and tendencies\u201d, as Simpson\n(1961, p. 153) would have it. Similarly, if there is a question of\ncopyright infringement, one had best look to industry standards and\naesthetics for what a film or a song is, and not set theory. In\ngeneral, questions such as \u201cwhat is a poem, a phoneme, a disease,\na flag,\u2026.?\u201d are to be pursued in conjunction with a\nspecific discipline, and not within the confines of a general theory of\ntypes. It is largely up to linguistics and the philosophy of it, e.g.,\nto determine the identity conditions for phonemes, allophones, cardinal\nvowels, LF representations, tone groups and all the other linguistic\ntypes mentioned in \u00a72 above.\n4.2.1 Identity Conditions for Words\n\n\nIt's instructive to consider what our paradigm of a type is\u2014a\nword. It will reveal how complicated the identity conditions are for\neven one specific type, and help to dispel the idea that tokens are to\ntypes as cookies are to cookie cutters. It will also show what we\ndesire from a theory of types, by exhibiting the facts that a theory\nof types has to accommodate. We illustrated the type-token distinction\nby appealing to words, so presumably we think we know at\nleast roughly what a word type is. Unfortunately, everyone seems to\nthink they know, but there is massive disagreement on the matter in\nphilosophy. However, as urged in the preceding paragraph, it is\ncrucial to rely on linguistics when we consider what a word is. When\nwe do we find that there are different linguistic criteria for what a\nword is, and a good deal of the disagreement can be chalked up to this\nfact.  McArthur 1992's The Oxford Companion to the English\nLanguage (pp. 1120-1) lists eight: orthographic, phonological,\nmorphological, lexical, grammatical, onomastic, lexicographical and\nstatistical\u2014 but adds that more can be demarcated. There are\ndifferent types of types of words. However deserving of attention\neach of these is, it will be useful to focus on just one, and I will\ndo so in what follows. There is an important and very common use of\nthe word \u2018word\u2019 that lexicographers and the rest of us use\nfrequently. It is, roughly, the sort of thing that merits a\ndictionary entry. (Roughly, because some entries in the\ndictionary, e.g.,\u2018il-,\u2019 \u2018-ile,\u2019 and\n\u2018metric system,\u2019 are not words, and some words, e.g. many\nproper names, do not get a dictionary entry.) This notion was at play\nin our opening remarks in \u00a72 about Shakespeare's vocabulary\ncontaining 30,000 words, and the twenty spellings and eighteen senses\nof the noun \u2018color\u2019/\u2019colour\u2019, the verb\n\u2018color\u2019/\u2019colour\u2019, and four current\npronunciations of the noun \u2018schedule\u2019. These examples show\n(in this ordinary sense of \u2018word\u2019) that the same word can\nbe written or spoken, can have more than one correct spelling, can\nhave more than one correct spelling at the same time, can have more\nthan one sense at the same time and can have more than one correct\npronunciation at the same time. It also shows that different words can\nhave the same correct spelling and pronunciation; further obvious\nexamples would show that different words can have the same\nsense\u2014e.g. English \u2018red\u2019 and French\n\u2018rouge\u2019. A theory of types, or of word types, that cannot\naccommodate this notion of a word is worthless. In what follows, I\nshall use \u2018word\u2019 in this sense.\n4.2.2 What a Theory of Words Might Tell Us\n\n\nIdeally, a theory of words and their tokens should tell us not only\n(i) what a word is (in the sense indicated), but (ii) how a word is to\nbe individuated, (iii) whether there is anything all and only tokens of a\nparticular word have in common (other than being tokens of that word);\n(iv) how we know about words; (v) what the relation is between words\nand their tokens; (vi) what makes a token a token of one word rather\nthan another; (vii) how word tokens are to be individuated; and (viii)\nwhat makes us think a particular is a token of one word rather than\nanother. These questions are distinct, although they are apt to run\ntogether because the answer to one may give rise to answers to others.\nFor example, if we say in answer to (iii), that all tokens of a\ncertain word (say, \u2018cat\u2019) have something in common besides\nbeing tokens of that word\u2014they are all spelled\n\u2018c\u2019-\u2018a\u2019-\u2018t\u2019, for\nexample\u2014then we may be inclined to say to (vi) that\nspelling makes a word token a token of \u2018cat\u2019\nrather than some other type; and to (vii) that word tokens of\n\u2018cat\u2019 are to be individuated on the basis of their being\nspelled \u2018c\u2019-\u2018a\u2019-\u2018t\u2019; and to (viii)\nthat we think something is a token of \u2018cat\u2019 when we see\nthat it is spelled \u2018c\u2019-\u2018a\u2019-\u2018t\u2019;\nand to (ii) that the word \u2018cat\u2019 itself is to be\nindividuated by its spelling; and to (i) that a word type is a\nsequence of letters\u2014e.g. the word \u2018cat\u2019 just\nis the sequence of letters <\u2018c\u2019,\n\u2018a\u2019, \u2018t\u2019>; and to (iv) that we know about a\nparticular word, about what properties it has, by perceiving its\ntokens: it has all the properties that every one of its tokens has\n(except for properties types cannot have, e.g., being\nconcrete).\n4.2.3 Orthography\n\n\nThe advantage of starting with (iii) is that if there is some\nnontrivial property that all tokens of a word (in the sense indicated)\nhave in common, then perhaps we can use it to individuate the tokens,\nand also to get a handle on what the type is like and on how we know\nwhat the type is like. Unfortunately, it is not spelling, contrary to\nwhat many philosophers seem to think. Stebbing, e.g., considers the\ninscribed word a shape. But not even the linguist's much\nnarrower notion of an orthographic word (\u2018a visual sign\nwith a space around it\u2019) requires a canonical spelling. We have\nseen that not all tokens of \u2018color\u2019 have the same\nspelling, even when they are spelled correctly, which they sometimes\nare not. Not all tokens are spelled at all\u2014spoken tokens are\nnot. Moreover, two words can have the same spelling, as the noun\n\u2018color\u2019 and verb \u2018color\u2019 prove, or to take a\ndifferent example, the noun \u2018down\u2019 from German meaning\n\u201cthe fine soft covering of fowls\u201d and the different noun\n\u2018down\u2019 from Celtic meaning \"open expanse of elevated\nland\". (They are not the same word with two senses, but different\nwords with different etymologies.)  Notice that even if, contrary to\nfact, all tokens of a word had the same spelling and we concluded that\nthe word type itself just is the sequence of letter types that compose\nit, we would have analyzed word types in terms of letter types, but\nsince we are wondering what types are in the first place, we would\nstill need an account of what letters are since they are types\ntoo. Providing one is surprisingly difficult.  Letters of the alphabet\nsuch as the letter \u2018A\u2019 are not just shapes, for\nexample, contrary to what is implicit in Stebbing 1935 and more\nexplicit in Goodman and Quine 1947, because Braille and Morse code\ntokens of the letter \u2018A\u2019 cannot be said to have \u201cthe\nsame shape\u201d, and even standard inscriptions of the letter\n\u2018A\u2019 do not have the same shape\u2014in either a Euclidean\nor a topological sense\u2014as these examples obtained from a few\nminutes in the library illustrate:\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the letter \u2018A\u2019 has a long history and many of\nits earlier \u201cforms\u201d would not be recognizable to the modern\nreader.\n4.2.4 Phonology\n\n\nIf we switch instead to a phonemic analysis of words, as\nbeing more fundamental, similar problems arise. Not all tokens of a\nword are composed of the same phonemes, because some tokens\nare inscriptions. But even ignoring inscriptions, the example of the\ntwo \u2018down\u2019\u2019s shows that neither can we identify a\nword with a sequence of phonemes. This particular difficulty might be\navoided if we identify a word with a phonemic analysis paired with a\nsense. But this is too strong; we saw earlier that the noun\n\u2018color\u2019 has eighteen senses. Moreover,\n\u2018schedule\u2019 has more than one phonemic analysis. A phoneme\nitself is a type with tokens, and so we'd also need an account of what\na phoneme is, and what its tokens have in common (if anything). Saying\nwhat a phoneme is promises to be at least as hard as saying what a\nletter is. Phonology, the study of phonemes, is distinct from\nphonetics, the scientific study of speech production. Phonetics is\nconcerned with the physical properties of sounds produced and is not\nlanguage relative. Phonemes, on the other hand, are language relative:\ntwo phonetically distinct speech tokens may be classified as tokens of\nthe same phoneme relative to one language, or as tokens of different\nphonemes relative to another language. Phonemes are theoretical\nentities, and abstract ones at that: they are sometimes said to be\nsets of features. The bottom line is that the\nphonological word is not the lexicographical one either.\n\n\nIt might be thought that we started at too abstract a level\u2014that\nif we think there is a hierarchy of types of words, we started \"too\nhigh\" on the hierarchy and we should start lower on the\nhierarchy. That is, that we should first gather together those tokens\nthat are phonetically (and perhaps semantically) identical on\nthe grounds that this is a perfectly good notion of a\nword. But notice: this would mean that different dialects of\nthe same language would have far fewer \"words\" in common than one\nwould have supposed, and it would misclassify many words because, for\nexample, according to Fudge (1990, p. 39) a Cockney \u2018know\u2019\nis like the Queen's \u2018now\u2019; the Queen's \u2018know\u2019\nis like Scottish \u2018now\u2019; and a Yorkshire \u2018know\u2019\nis like the Queen's \u2018gnaw\u2019. Worse, even within the very\nsame idiolect it would distinguish as different \"words\" what one would\nhave thought were the same word. For example, the word\n\u2018extraordinary\u2019 is variously pronounced with six, five,\nfour, three or even two syllables by speakers of British English.\nAccording to Fudge (1990, p. 40) it ranges \"for most British English\nspeakers from the hyper-careful\n['ekstr\u0259'\u0294\u0254:d\u026an\u0259r\u026a] through the fairly\ncareful [\u026ak'str\u0254:dnr\u026a] to the very colloquial\n['str\u0254:nr\u026a].\" That is, the very same person may use any of\nfive pronunciations for what should be considered the same word. Only\nan absolute diehard of this \"bottom-up\" approach would insist on\ndistinguishing as different words representations for the same\nidiolectal word. Not only would a phonologist take this as excessively\ncomplicated, but the representation types themselves can receive\nrealizations that are acoustically very different (for the small child\nand the man may speak the same idiolect). Fudge (1990, p. 31) assures\nus that \"It is very rare for two repetitions of an utterance to be\nexactly identical, even when spoken by the same person.\" Pretty soon,\neach word token would have to count as tokens of different\n\"words\".\n\n\nThe example of ['str\u0254:nr\u03b9] demonstrates that there may be\nno phonetic signal in a token for every phoneme that is\nsupposed to compose the word: it is \"missing\" several syllables! This\nis also demonstrated by reflection on casual speech: [jeet?] for\n\u2018did you eat?\u2019. No wonder, then, that many phoneticians\nhave given up on the attempt to reduce phonological types to\nacoustic/articulatory types. (See Bromberger and Halle 1986). Even the\nphysicalist Bjorn Lindblom (1986, p. 495) concedes that \"for a given\nlanguage there seems to be no unique set of acoustic properties that\nwill always be present in the production of a given unit (feature,\nphoneme, syllable) and that will reliably be found in all conceivable\ncontexts.\"\n\n\nHowever, the final nail in the coffin for the suggestion according to\nwhich all tokens of the same word have the \"same sound\" is that words\ncan be mispronounced. As Kaplan (1990) has argued, a word can suffer\nextreme mispronunciation and still be (a token of) the same word. He\nasks us to imagine a test subject, who faithfully repeats each word\nshe is told. After a time, we put filters on her that radically alter\nthe results of her efforts. Nonetheless, we would say she is saying\nthe word she hears. Kaplan concludes that differences in sound between\ntokens of the same word can be just about as great as we would\nlike. Notice that in such circumstances intention\u2014what\nword the test subject intended to produce\u2014is key. This suggests\nthat perhaps what all tokens of a word, say, \u2018color\u2019, have\nin common is that they were produced as the result of an intention to\nproduce a token of the word \u2018color\u2019. Unfortunately,\ncounterexamples are not hard to manufacture. (A clear phonemic example\nof \u2018supercalifragilisticexpealadocious\u2019 in English would\nprobably not count as a token of \u2018color\u2019, for example.)\nCounterexamples aside, it would be putting the cart before the horse\nto try to explain what the word \u2018color\u2019 is by appealing to\nthe intention to produce a token of the word \u2018color\u2019. It\nwould be like trying to explain what a fork is by appealing to the\nintention to produce a fork. Intentions are important in helping to\nidentify which type a token is a token of\u2014question\n(viii)\u2014but will not help us with what the type is\u2014question\n(i)\u2014and so I shall ignore them in what follows.\n4.2.5 Conclusion\n\n\nThe upshot of all this is that there is no nontrivial, interesting,\n\"natural\", projectible property that all tokens of a word have in\ncommon, other than being tokens of that word (in the sense of\n\u2018word\u2019 indicated). Tokens are all the same word, but they\nare not all the same. That is, the answer to (iii) is no. What then,\nof the other questions, (i)-(viii)? They become more difficult to\nanswer.  Wetzel (2002) attempts to answer them. The primary conclusion\nof Wetzel 2002 is that words are theoretical entities,\npostulated by and justified by linguistic theory. Words, in the sense\nindicated, are individuated by a number of variables, including\northography, phonology, etymology, grammatical function and\nsense(s). As for their tokens, they are apt to have some but not all\nof the properties of the type. And, as the story from Kaplan shows,\ntokens may even be quite deformed. These considerations impact\nsignificantly on the relation between types and their tokens,\ndiscussed in the next section, \u00a75.\n5. The Relation between Types and their Tokens\n\n\nThe relation between types and their tokens is obviously dependent on\nwhat a type is. If it is a set, as Quine (1987, p. 217) maintains, the\nrelation is class membership. If it is a kind, as\nWolterstorff maintains, the relation is kind-membership. If\nit is a law, as Peirce maintains, it is something else again, perhaps\nbeing used in accordance with. (Although Peirce also says a\ntoken is an \u201cinstance\u201d of a type and that the token\nsignifies the type.) Nonetheless, it has often been taken to be the\nrelation of instantiation, or exemplification; a token is an\ninstance of a type; it exemplifies the type. (Not that every instance\nof a type is a token\u2014e.g. capital \u2018A\u2019, small\n\u2018A\u2019, and all the other types of \u2018A\u2019s tokened\nin the display in \u00a74.2 above may be said to be instances of the\nletter \u2018A\u2019.) As with other universals, there are two\nversions of this relation, Platonic and Aristotelian. Although the two\nversions of property realism are discussed at length under this\nencyclopedia's entry for properties, a few remarks about the type\nversions are in order.\n\n\nAccording to Platonic versions of type realism, e.g., Bromberger 1989,\nHale 1990, Katz 1981 and Wetzel 2002, the type is an abstract object,\nnot located anywhere in space-time, although its tokens are.  This\nversion appears to give rise to serious epistemological\nproblems\u2014we don't see or hear the type, it isn't located\nanywhere in space-time, so how do spatiotemporal creatures such as\nourselves know it exists, or what properties it has? Admittedly, we\nsee and hear tokens, but how are they a guide to what the type is\nlike? One answer, given for example, by Wolterstorff, for whom we saw\nin \u00a74 that a type is a norm-kind, is that ordinary induction from\ntokens would give us knowledge of types, at least in the case of\ninstantiated types.  Bromberger (1992a, p.176) claims that linguists\n\u201coften impute properties to types after observing and judging\nsome of their tokens and seem to do this in a principled way\u201d\nand calls the principle that licenses this inference the Platonic\nRelationship Principle. More specifically, he proposes (1992a)\nthat the type, as the archetype of the quasi-natural kind which\ncomprises the tokens, has just those projectible properties that all\nthe tokens have. He has in mind properties such as the same underlying\nphonological structure, for words, and the same boiling point, for\nelements.\n\n\nHowever, as we saw in \u00a74, generally there are no such properties\nhad by all and only tokens of a type, at least in the case of\nwords\u2014not same phonological structure, nor same sense nor same\nspelling. Not all tokens have any such natural projectible property\n(except for the property of being tokens of the same\ntype). It should be clear from \u00a74 that the cookie cutter\nmodel\u2014the idea of the type as just a perceptible pattern for\nwhat all the tokens look like\u2014does not work.  Goodman (1972,\npp. 437-8) follows Peirce in using the word \u2018replica\u2019 to\napply to all tokens of the same type, (although Peirce seemed to think\nthey were replicas of the type, whereas Goodman, being a nominalist,\ncannot think this) but not all tokens resemble each other in any\nordinary sense beyond being tokens of the same type (although of\ncourse some do). Goodman himself is clear about this, for he notes\nthere that \u201cSimilarity, ever ready to solve philosophical\nproblems and overcome obstacles, is a pretender, an impostor, a\nquack\u2026. Similarity does not pick out inscriptions that are\n\u2018tokens of a common type\u2019, or replicas of each other. Only\nour addiction to similarity deludes us into accepting similarity as\nthe basis for grouping inscriptions into the several letters, words,\nand so forth.\u201d But others, e.g. Stebbing (1935, p. 6) and Hardie\n(1936), claim that all spoken tokens are more or less similar to each\nother. Because they are not, Wetzel (2002) and (2008) proposes that\nsince the only property all the tokens of a type generally share is\nbeing tokens of the type, one of the primary justifications for\npositing word types is that being a token of the word\n\u2018color,\u2019 say, is the glue that binds the considerable\nvariety of space-time particulars together. The type is thus a very\nimportant theoretical object, whose function is to unify all the\ntokens as being \u201cof the same type\u201d; in accordance with the\nPlatonic Relationship Principle, the type has properties based on the\nproperties of some of its tokens, but in a complex\nway\u2014in addition, the tokens have some of their\nproperties in virtue of what properties the type has.\n\n\nIn Aristotelian versions of exemplification, such as Wollheim 1968 and\nArmstrong 1978, the type has no independent existence apart from its\ntokens. It is \u201cin\u201d each and every one of its tokens, and\nso can be seen or heard just as the tokens can be. This avoids the\nepistemological problem mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but\nmakes it hard to explain how some types\u2014such as very long\nsentences\u2014can have no tokens.\n\n\nAs against instantiation of any sort, Stebbing (1935, p. 9) argues\nthat a token is not an instance of a type, because \u201cthe type is\na logical construction out of tokens having similarity or conventional\nassociation [as the inscribed word with the spoken]. It follows that\nthe type is logically dependent upon the tokens, in the sense that it\nis logically impossible to mention the type-word without using a\ntoken, and further, the meaning of the type has to be defined by\nreference to the tokens.\u201d These claims are quite\ncontroversial. For example, it is clear one can refer to a type word\nwithout using a token of it\u2014one can say \u201cthe word\na token of which is the first word on the page\u201d.\n\n\nAnother alternative to exemplification is\nrepresentation. According to Szabo (1999, p. 150), types are\nabstract particulars, as with Platonic realism, but tokens\nrepresent their types, just as \u201cpaintings, photographs,\nmaps, numerals, hand gestures, traffic signs and horn signals\u201d\nrepresent, or \u201cstand for\u201d their representata. A word token\nof \u2018horse\u2019 represents the word \u2018horse\u2019, which\nin turn represents horses. Just as a correct map of the planet can\nprovide us with knowledge of the planet, so too a token can provide us\nwith knowledge of properties of the type, thus addressing the\nepistemological problem. The representation view gives rise to a\nproblem however, for it turns out that what we have been calling word\ntokens aren't words at all on this view, anymore than a map of a\nplanet is a planet, and this runs contrary to our usual thinking.\n6. What is a Token?\n\n\nIt might seem that tokens are less problematic than types, being\nspatio-temporal particulars. But certain complications should be\nnoted.  (We continue to use linguistic examples, but the remarks hold\ntrue for tokens generally).\n\nAs Kaplan (1990, p. 97) pointed out, a token of a word could be\nsuitably circumscribed empty space (e.g., in a piece of cardboard\nafter letters have been cut out of it).\nIt would seem that a token might also be a mental\nparticular\u2014because a poem might be composed prior to its being\nread or written down\u2014although there is disagreement over whether\nsuch a mental particular is to count as a token.\nIt will generally be the case that some tokens of the type\nresemble in their outward physical appearance some other tokens of the\ntype, but as we saw in \u00a74-5, it is generally not the case that\nall the tokens of the same type resemble one another in\nappearance. (Recall the example of the letter \u2018A\u2019 in\n\u00a74.)\nEven being similar in appearance (say by sound or spelling) to a\ncanonical exemplar token of the type is not enough to make a physical\nobject/event a token of that type. The phonetic sequence [Ah\n\u2018key ess \u2018oon ah \u2018may sah] is the same phonetic\n(type) spoken in Spanish or Yiddish. Yet if a Spanish speaker uses it\nto say a table goes here, she has not, in addition, said\na cow eats without a knife in Yiddish. She has not said\nanything in Yiddish, however phonetically similar what she said might\nbe to a sentence token of Yiddish. So her token is a token in Spanish,\nnot Yiddish. Meaningful tokens are tokens in a language.\nAlong the same lines, being a physical object/event that is\nsimilar in appearance (say by sound or spelling) to a canonical\nexemplar token of the type is not even enough to make the physical\nobject/event meaningful, because, as Putnam (1981, pp. 1-2)\namong others has argued, the token must have been appropriately\nintentionally produced.\nIf it is not already clear from the foregoing, it should be noted\nthat a physical object that is a token of a type is not one\nintrinsically\u2014merely by being a certain sequence of\nshaped ink marks, say. Just as being a brother is not an intrinsic\nproperty of brothers because one is a brother only relative to another\nperson, so a token is a token only relative to a type, and to a\nlanguage, perhaps to an orientation, and perhaps, as Hugly and Sayward\n(1981 p. 186) have argued, to a tokening system (e.g., Morse Code),\nwhich they define as \u201ca set of instructions that tell how, for\nany given expression, a speaker of the language could construct a\nperceptible particular that tokens that expression given that the\nspeaker had enough physical and mental resources\u2026\u201d. \n7. Do Types Exist?\n7.1 Universals\n\n\nSince types are usually thought to be universals, the debate over\nwhether they exist is as longstanding as the debate over universals,\nand debaters fall into the same camps. Realists say they do, as we saw\nin \u00a75 which surveyed several varieties of realism. Realism's\ntraditional opponents were nominalists and\nconceptualists. Nominalists, who renounce universals and abstract\nobjects, say they don't.  (See, e.g., Goodman and Quine 1947, Quine\n1953, Goodman 1977 and Bromberger 1992b). Conceptualists argued that\nthere are no general things such as the species homo sapiens;\nthere are only general ideas\u2014that is, ideas that apply\nto more than one thing. Applied to words, the thesis would be that\nwords are not abstract objects \u201cout there\u201d, but objects in\nthe mind.  Their existence then, would be contingent on having been\nthought of.  While this contingency may have a good deal of\nplausibility in the case of linguistic items, by itself conceptualism\nis just a stopgap measure on the issue of types and tokens\ngenerally. For ideas themselves are also either types or tokens (as\nevidenced by the fact that two people sometimes have the same\nidea). So either the conceptualist is proposing that types are idea\ntypes\u2014which would be a species of realism\u2014or she is\nproposing that there are no types, only mental idea particulars in\nparticular persons, which is a version of nominalism. Conceptualism,\ntherefore, will be ignored in what follows.\n7.2 Realism\n\n\nRealism is the most natural view in the debate with nominalism,\nbecause as we saw in some detail in \u00a72 type talk is\nubiquitous. That is, we talk as though there are types in philosophy,\nscience and everyday life. To say that we talk as though there are\ntypes is not to invoke the traditional argument for universals, which\nis that a sunset and a rose are both red, so they have something in\ncommon; and this something can only be the property of being\nred; so properties exist. Quine (1953) convinced many at\nmid-century that this traditional argument for universals, which\nrelies on predicates referring to something, fails. He objected that\n\u201cthe rose is red because the rose partakes of redness\u201d is\nuninformative\u2014we are no better off in terms of explanatory power\nwith such extra objects as redness than we are without them;\nperhaps a rose's being red and a sunset's being red are just brute\nfacts. Rather, to say we talk as though there are types is, as we saw\nin \u00a72, to appeal to the fact that in our theories we frequently\nuse singular terms for types, and we quantify over them. As we saw,\nFrege emphasized that singular term usage is in indicator of\nobjecthood, and Quine stressed that we are ontologically\ncommitted to that over which we quantify.  Such considerations led\nQuine himself (1987, p. 217) to hold that expression types such as\n\u2018red\u2019 exist, even while he denied that redness\ndoes. Since at least on the face of it we are committed to types in\nmany fields of inquiry, therefore, it is incumbent upon the nominalist\nto \u201canalyze them away\u201d. (Or to maintain that all theories\nwhich appear to refer to types are false\u2014but this is a pretty\nradical approach, which will be ignored below.)\n7.3 Nominalism\n\n\nRealism is not without its problems, as was noted in \u00a75\nabove. Also favoring nominalism is Occam's principle which would have\nus prefer theories with fewer sorts of entities, other things being\nequal.  The main problem for nominalists is to account for our\napparent theoretical commitment to types, which, whatever types are,\nare not spatio-temporal particulars (according to nearly\neveryone). Traditional nominalists argued (as their name implies) that\nthere are no general things, there are only general words,\nand such words simply apply to more than one thing. But this is not a\nsolution to the current problem, presupposing as it does that there\nare word types\u2014types are the problem. (Attempts to avoid this\nare given by Goodman and by Sellars; see below.) So-called class\nnominalists hold that a word type is just the class, or set, of its\ntokens. But this is unsatisfactory because, first, as we saw in\n\u00a75, classes are ill-suited for the job, since classes have their\nmembership and their cardinality necessarily, but how many tokens a\ntype has is usually a contingent matter. (For the same reason,\nmereological sums of tokens are unsuited for the job of types, as they\nhave their parts essentially.) And second, classes are\nabstract objects too, so it is hard to see how this is really a form\nof nominalism about abstract objects at all.\n\n\nInitially more promising is the nominalistic claim that the surface\ngrammar of type talk is misleading, that talk of types is just\nshorthand for talk of tokens and is thus harmless. To say \u2018The\nhorse is a mammal\u2019 is just to say \u2018All horses are\nmammals\u2019; to say \u2018The horse is a four-legged animal\u2019\nis to say, as Frege himself (1977) suggested, \u2018All properly\nconstituted horses are four-legged animals\u2019. The idea is to\n\u201canalyze away\u201d apparent references to types by offering\ntranslations that are apparently type-free, and otherwise\nnominalistically acceptable. The problem is how to do this for each\nand every reference to or quantification over a type/types. Given the\nubiquity of such references/quantifications, only the procurement of\nsome sort of systematic procedure could assure us it can be done.\nHowever, chances of formulating a systematic procedure appear slight,\nin view of the following obstacles that would have to be overcome.\n\nIf the \u201ctranslation\u201d is not to turn out to be\ntrivially true because there are no tokens, it must be the case that\nall types have tokens. We saw in \u00a75 there is reason to deny this,\nbecause it would falsify the law of syntax that says that if\n\u03a6,\u03a8 are sentences, then so is (\u03a6 & \u03a8), since there\nare only finitely many sentence tokens.\nThe examples of \u2018The horse is a mammal\u2019 and \u2018The\nhorse is four-legged\u2019 suggest that \u2018The Type is P\u2019\nis to be analyzed as \u2018All tokens, or all normal tokens, are\nP\u2019. But this won't work. The noun \u2018colour\u2019 is\nspelled \u2018color\u2019 (among other ways) , but not all properly\nformed tokens of it are. \u2018Colour\u2019 also means of the\nface or skin (among other things), but not only do not all tokens\nof it mean of the face or skin, probably most do not, and the\naverage one does not.\nThese semantic facts show that \u2018The Type is P\u2019 cannot\nbe analyzed as \u2018Either all tokens are P, all properly formed\ntokens are P, most tokens are P or the average token is P\u2019. Nor\nis there any point in searching for some other magic statistical\nformula that would express exactly how many tokens have to be\nP for the Type to be P. This is because some of the properties of the\nType are collective properties\u2014e.g., when it is said that\n\u201cThe grizzly bear, Ursus Horribilis, had at one time a\nU.S. range of most of the West, and numbered 10,000 is California\nalone, but today its range is Montana, Wyoming and Idaho and it\nnumbers less than 1000.\u201d Having a range of most of the West is\ntrue of no individual bear.\nIt is very difficult even to find a nominalistic paraphrase for\n\u201cOld Glory had twenty-eight stars in 1846 but now has\nfifty\u201d, as Wetzel (2008) argues.\nSo far we have only been considering analyzing away singular\nterms. Quantifications are indeed a nightmare. Here is Quine and\nGoodman's (1947 p. 180) nominalized version of \u201cThere are more\ncats than dogs\u201d: \u201cEvery individual that contains a bit of\neach cat is bigger than some individual that contains a bit of each\ndog\u201d where a bit \u201cis an object that is just as big as the\nsmallest animal among all cats and dogs\u201d. Ingenious though their\nstrategy is, it offers no help for nominalizing \u201cOf 20,481\nspecies examined, two-thirds were secure, seven percent were\ncritically imperiled, and fifteen percent were vulnerable\u201d.\n\n7.3.1 Goodman's Nominalism\n\n\nI have been writing as though it were easy to pick out and quantify\nover tokens of a type without referring to the type. Sometimes it is:\n\u2018The horse\u2026\u2019\u2014 \u2018All\nhorses\u2026\u2019. But this will not generally be the\ncase. Consider the noun \u2018color\u2019. The natural way to pick\nout its tokens is \u201call tokens of the noun\n\u2018color\u2019\u201d, but obviously this will not do as a\nnominalistic paraphrase, for it contains a reference to a\ntype. Goodman (1977) suggests a systematic way of paraphrasing and a\ngeneral procedure for substituting nominalistic paraphrases for\nlinguistic type-ridden sentences. In 1977 (p. 262) he claims that\n\u201cany \u201c \u2018Paris\u2019 consists of five letters\u201d\nis short for \u201cEvery \u2018Paris\u2019-inscription consists of\nfive letter-inscriptions\u201d \u201d. The idea seems to be to\nreplace singular terms by predicates, which nominalists such as\nGoodman think carry no ontological commitment. So instead of \u201can\ninscription of \u2018color\u2019\u201d write \u201ca\n\u2018color\u2019-inscription.\u201d It seems pretty clear,\nhowever, that, based on the rules of quote-names for words, this\npredicate still retains a singular term for a type, the word\n\u2018color\u2019 just as clearly as \u201ca George W. Bush\nappearance\u201d still contains a reference to Bush. That this is so\nis even more obvious in the case of \u201can \u2018a cat is on the\nmat\u2019-inscription\u201d. So the question is how we might\nidentify these tokens grammatically but without referring to the noun\n\u2018color\u2019 itself and still say something true and (in some\nappropriate sense) equivalent. Is there perhaps some other way of\nquantifying over tokens of a word, without referring to the word or to\nany other type? The fact that tokens are all \u201cthe same\ntype\u201d suggests they are all \u201cthe same\u201d somehow,\nwhich begets the idea that the type must embody certain\nsimilar features that all and only its tokens have, such as\nspelling, or sense, or phonological structure or some combination of\nthem. This is a beguiling idea, until one tries to find such a\nfeature, or features, amid the large variety of its tokens\u2014even\nthe well-formed tokens. As we saw in \u00a74, there is no such feature\n(consider again \u2018color\u2019 and \u2018schedule\u2019). They\ndemonstrate that e.g. neither same spelling, same sense, nor same\npronunciation prevail. In any event, such possible defining features\ninvolve reference to types: letter types in the spellings, phoneme\ntypes in the pronunciation. These too would have to be \u201canalyzed\naway\u201d in terms of quantifications over particulars. It might be\nthought that Sellars solved this problem by appealing to the notion of\na linguistic role, which Loux (1998, p. 79) defines as:\ntwo word (tokens) have the same linguistic role if they\n\u201cfunction in the same way as responses to perceptual input; they\nenter into the same inference patterns; and they play the same role in\nguiding behavior\u201d. It is dubious whether this notion can be\nunpacked without referring to abstract objects (same inference\npatterns?), but in any event it cannot be used to pick out all tokens\nof a word, as we have been using the word \u2018word\u2019. The\nreason is that \u2018red\u2019 and \u2018rouge\u2019 are different\nwords in our sense, but their tokens play the same linguistic role for\nSellars.\n\n\nBut even if expressions like \u201ca\n\u2018color\u2019-inscription\u201d did not contain singular terms,\nGoodman's suggestion that whatever is true of the type is true of all\nthe tokens has two fatal defects. First, it would turn truths into\nfalsehoods. \u2018Paris\u2019 consists of five letters, as does\n\u2018color\u2019, but not every \u2018color\u2019-inscription\nconsists of just five letter-inscriptions since some are spelled\n\u2018c\u2019-\u2018o\u2019-\u2018l\u2019-\u2018o\u2019-\u2018u\u2019-\u2018r\u2019.\n(As for denying that these are inscriptions of the word\n\u2018color\u2019 see \u201cOrthography\u201d in \u00a74 above.)\nIt doesn't even work for the word \u2018Paris\u2019, as it has the\nforms \u2018Pareiss\u2019 and \u2018Parrys\u2019 also. Second,\nGoodman's technique of replacing singular terms by predicates only\nworks if we are employing a realist semantics. That is, the key to his\nprogram is that for every word in the dictionary and every sentence in\nthe language there corresponds a unique predicate that is true of just\nthe tokens of that word/that sentence. (Without such predicates, true\nstatements apparently referring to types would be short for nothing at\nall.) But this is only plausible on a realist semantics. If\n\u2018predicate\u2019 meant \u2018predicate token\u2019 there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. That is, it is certainly\nfalse that for every word \u03b1 in the dictionary, there is an\nactual predicate token of the form \u2018is an\n\u03b1-inscription\u2019.  For more details on the problems with\nGoodman's strategy, see Wetzel (2000).\n7.3.2 Sellars's nominalism\n\n\nSellars's suggestion is rather similar to Goodman's, and faces similar\ndifficulties, but is sufficiently different to be worth\nmentioning. Loux (1998, pp. 75-83), for one, argues that Sellars\n(1963) achieves the best nominalist account available by overcoming\ncritical objections to Carnap's \u201cmetalinguistic\u201d account\nas follows. Carnap (1959, pp. 284-314) had suggested that all claims\ninvolving apparent reference to abstract objects, such as \u201cRed\nis a color\u201d, are systematically to be understood as\nmetalinguistic claims about the word involved (\u201cThe word\n\u2018red\u2019 is a color predicate\u201d). There are two obvious\nobjections to Carnap's suggestion. The first is that we still have\nword types being referred to; the second is that translation of\n\u201cRed is a color\u201d and \u201cThe word \u2018red\u2019 is\na color predicate\u201d into French, say, will not result in\nsentences that are equivalent, since the latter (\u201cLe mot\n\u2018red\u2019 est un pr\u00e9dicat de coleur\u201d) will still\nrefer to an English word, but the former will not. To counter the\nfirst objection, Sellars (1963, pp. 632-33) claims \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d is a distributive singular term,\nwhich typically consists of \u2018the\u2019 followed by a common\nnoun that purports to name a kind\u2014e.g., \u2018the lion\u2019\nin \u201cThe lion is tawny\u201d\u2014and that use of it results in\na generic claim that is about token lions, not the\ntype\u2014\u201cAll lions are tawny\u201d\u2014since \u201cThe K\nis f\u201d is logically equivalent to \u201cAll Ks are\nf\u201d. Note that this is similar to Goodman's suggestion and as\nsuch is subject to the same criticism as is Goodman's: the two\nsentence forms said to be logically equivalent are not. See the second\nbullet point three paragraphs above.  Nor is there some other simple\nand straightforward logical equivalence that does the job; see the\nthird and fourth bullet points above. At best this is a suggestion\nthat some of the sentences in question\u2014the ones that do not\ncontain \u201ccollective\u201d predicates like\n\u2018extinct\u2019\u2014are logically equivalent to generic\nclaims\u2014e.g. \u201cLions are tawny\u201d\u2014which are\ncapable of being true while admitting of exceptions. However, that\nthere is a uniform semantics (even a very complex one) for generic\nclaims, one moreover that \u201canalyzes away\u201d kind talk, is a\nstrong empirical claim about language, one that does not receive\nstrong support from current efforts to analyze generic claims. (See\nCarlson and Pelletier 1995.)\n\n\nTo counter the second objection (about non-equivalent translations)\nSellars suggests we introduce a new sort of quotation device, dot\nquotation, that would permit translation of the quoted word. Then,\ne.g.  \u201cThe word \u2022red\u2022 is a color predicate\u201d\ntranslates as \u201cLe mot \u2022rouge\u2022 est un pr\u00e9dicat\nde coleur\u201d. The justification is that \u2018red\u2019 and\n\u2018rouge\u2019 are functionally equivalent\u2014they play the\nsame linguistic role. As mentioned above, this means that they have\nthe same causes (of perceptual stimuli, e.g.) and effects (conduct,\ne.g.) and function similarly in inferential transitions. Again,\nwhether Sellars can unpack the notion of \u201csame linguistic\nrole\u201d without appealing to any universals remains an open\nquestion. Less open is the question of how successful such an approach\nis to dealing with talk of words, e.g., \u201cThe word\n\u2018red\u2019 consists of three letters\u201d. If we apply\nSellars' analysis systematically, this becomes \u201c\u201dThe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d consists of a three-lettered predicate\u201d\nwhich is just false; if instead we reckon that \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d is already a distributive singular term and\napply his analysis to it, getting \u201cThe word \u2022red\u2022 is a\nthree-lettered predicate\u201d, this then translates incorrectly as\n\u201cLe mot \u2022rouge\u2022 est un pr\u00e9dicat trois-en\nlettres\u201d. If we stick instead with regular quotation, which\nresists translation, then we cannot appeal to \u201csame linguistic\nrole\u201d to say what class of things \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d distributes over. In any event, Sellars's\naccount also faces the difficulty noted above with Goodman's account:\nit is only plausible on a realist semantics, because if\n\u2018predicate\u2019 meant \u2018predicate token\u2019 there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. (For other problems with\nSellars's account, see Loux 1978: 81-85.)\n8. Occurrences\n\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a71 above, there is a related distinction that\nneeds to be mentioned in connection with the type-token\ndistinction. It is that between a thing, or type of thing, and (what\nis best called) an occurrence of it\u2014where an occurrence\nis not necessarily a token. The reason the reader was asked above to\ncount the words in Stein's line in front of the reader's\neyes, was to ensure that tokens would be counted. Tokens are\nconcrete particulars; whether objects or events they have a unique\nspatio-temporal location.  Had the reader been asked to count the\nwords in Stein's line itself, the reader might still have correctly\nanswered either \u2018three\u2019 or \u2018ten\u2019. There are\nexactly three word types, but although there are ten word tokens in a\ntoken copy of the line, there aren't any tokens at all in the line\nitself. The line itself is an abstract type, as is the poem in which\nit first appeared.  Nor are there ten word types in the line, because\nas we just said it contains only the three word types,\n\u2018a,\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018rose,\u2019 each of\nwhich is unique. So what are there ten of? Occurrences of\nwords, as logicians say: three occurrences of the word (type)\n\u2018a,\u2019 three of \u2018is\u2019 and four of\n\u2018rose\u2019. Or, to put it in a more ontologically neutral\nfashion: the word \u2018a\u2019 occurs three times in the line,\n\u2018is\u2019 three times and \u2018rose\u2019 four times.\nSimilarly, the variable \u2018x\u2019 occurs three times in the\nformula \u2018\u2203x (Ax & Bx)\u2019.\n\n\nNow this may seem impossible; how can one and the same thing occur\nmore than once without there being two tokens of it? Simons (1982)\nconcludes that it can't. Wetzel (1993) argues that it is useful to\ndistinguish objects from occurrences of them. For example, in the\nsequence of numbers <0,1,0,1> the very same number, the number\none, occurs twice, yet its first occurrence is distinct from its\nsecond. The notion of an occurrence of x in y involves not\nonly x and y, but also how x is situated in y. Even a\nconcrete object can occur more than once in a\nsequence\u2014the same person occurs twice in the sequence of New\nJersey million dollar lottery winners, remarkably enough. If we think\nof an expression as a sequence, then the air of mystery over\nhow the same identical thing can occur twice vanishes. Does this mean\nthat, in addition to word types and word tokens, word occurrences must\nalso be recognized? Not necessarily; we can unpack the notion of an\noccurrence using \u201coccurs in\u201d if we have the notion of a\nsequence available; see Wetzel 1993 for details.\n\n\nThe need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types\narises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have\nother types of things occurring in them. There are 10,000 (or so)\nnotes in Beethoven's Sonate Path\u00e9tique, but there are\nonly 88 notes (types) the piano can produce. There are supposed to be\nfifty stars (types) in the current Old Glory (type), but the\nfive-pointed star (type) is unique. And what could it mean to say that\nthe very same atom (type), hydrogen, \u201coccurs four times\u201d\nin the methane molecule? Again, the perplexing thing is how the very\nsame thing can \u201coccur\u201d more than once, without there being\nmore than one token of it. Armstrong (1986), Lewis (1986a,b) and\nForrest (1986) called such types \u201cstructural universals\u201d,\nwhich were the subject of a debate among the three. Armstrong and\nForrest defended Armstrong's (1978) view of universals against Lewis,\nwho delineated seven different views of structural universals\ncompatible with Armstrong's theory, and found all of them wanting.\nBasically, Lewis (1986a) assumed that there are two sorts of ways\nstructural universals might be constructed of simpler universals:\nset-theoretically and mereologically. He argued that set-theoretical\nconstructions resulted in ersatz universals, not universals worthy of\nthe name, and that the various mereological constructions just\nresulted in a heap of simpler universals, where there could not be\ntwo of the simpler universals. Wetzel (2008) argues that\nthere is a conception of a structural universal, the \u201coccurrence\nconception\u201d\u2014which is an extension of the occurrence\nconception of expressions mentioned above\u2014that escapes Lewis's\nobjections.",
