There are various forms of philosophical naturalism,\nall of which have influenced legal philosophy to different extents.\nMethodological naturalists (M-naturalists) view philosophy as\ncontinuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some M-naturalists\nwant to replace conceptual and justificatory theories with\nempirical and descriptive theories; they take their inspiration from\nmore-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual analysis and\nfoundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the\nnormative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy,\nbut emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative\nadvice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some\nM-naturalists are also substantive naturalists\n(S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist\nonly natural or physical things; semantic\nS-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any\nconcept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry.\n\nEach of these varieties of naturalism has applications in legal\nphilosophy. Within legal philosophy, replacement forms of\nM-naturalism hold that: (1) conceptual analysis of the concept of law\nshould be replaced by reliance on the best social scientific\nexplanations of legal phenomena, and (2) normative theories of\nadjudication should be replaced by empirical theories. These views are\nassociated with American Legal Realism and Brian Leiter\u2019s\nreinterpretation of Realism. Normative M-naturalists, by contrast,\ninspired and led by Alvin Goldman, seek to bring empirical results to\nbear on philosophical and foundational questions about adjudication,\nthe legal rules of evidence and discovery, the adversarial process,\nand so forth. Finally, S-naturalism has featured most prominently in\nthe writings of the Scandinavian Legal Realists (long predating the\nresurgence of naturalism in Anglophone jurisprudence), whose\nontological S-naturalism led them to employ a familiar range of\nnaturalism-motivated explanatory strategies, including naturalistic\nreduction of legal concepts and non-cognitivist accounts of important\naspects of legal discourse. S-naturalism also can serve, and sometimes\nhas served, as a motivation for Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\njurisprudential tradition. More recent forms of S-naturalism,\nassociated with a revival of a kind of natural law theory defended by\nDavid Brink and Michael Moore (among others), apply the\n\u201cnew\u201d or \u201ccausal\u201d theory of reference to\nquestions of legal interpretation, including the interpretation of\nmoral concepts as they figure in legal rules.\n", "toc": [{"#VariNatuMethSubs": "1.

Varieties of Naturalism: Methodological and Substantive\n\nDifferent philosophical doctrines travel under the heading of\n\u201cnaturalism.\u201d We can usefully distinguish two broad and\nimportant categories: methodological naturalism (or\nM-naturalism) and substantive naturalism (or\nS-naturalism) (Leiter 1998; cf. Railton 1990 and Goldman 1994).\nNaturalism in philosophy is most often a methodological view\nto the effect that philosophical theorizing should be continuous with\nempirical inquiry in the sciences. Such a view need not presuppose a\nsolution to the so-called \u201cdemarcation\nproblem\u201d\u2014i.e., the problem of what demarcates genuine\nscience from pseudo-science\u2014as long as there remain clear,\nparadigmatic cases of successful sciences. Some M-naturalists want\n\u201ccontinuity with\u201d only the hard or\nphysical sciences; others seek \u201ccontinuity with\u201d\nany successful science, natural or social. The latter is probably the\ndominant strand in philosophy today.\n\nFor M-naturalists, \u201ccontinuity with\u201d the sciences\nincludes, in the first instance, the Quinean repudiation of a\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d\u2014that is, philosophical inquiry\nthat proceeds entirely a priori and without the benefit\nof empirical evidence. (Most M-naturalists do not go as far as Quine,\nhowever, in repudiating any role for a priori\nconceptual analysis: see, e.g., Goldman 1986 for a more typical\nM-naturalist approach.) Beyond hostility to methods that are\nexclusively a priori, M-naturalists require continuity with\nthe sciences in two more precise senses, which we may call\n\u201cResults Continuity\u201d and \u201cMethods\nContinuity.\u201d\n\nResults Continuity requires that the substantive claims of\nphilosophical theories be supported or justified by the results of the\nsciences. For example, epistemologists like Goldman look to the\nresults of psychology and cognitive science to find out how the human\ncognitive apparatus really works; only with that information in hand\ncan the epistemologist construct norms for how humans ought\nto form beliefs (Goldman 1978, 1986). Similarly, moral philosophers\nlike Allan Gibbard and Peter Railton, despite profound substantive\ndisagreements, both think that a satisfactory account of\nmorality\u2019s nature and function must be supported by the results\nof evolutionary biology, our best going theory for how we got to be\nthe way we are (Gibbard 1990; Railton 1986). A philosophical account\nof morality that explains its nature and function in ways that would\nbe impossible according to evolutionary theory would not, by\nnaturalistic scruples, be an acceptable philosophical theory.\n\n\u201cMethods Continuity,\u201d by contrast, demands only that\nphilosophical theories emulate the methods of inquiry of\nsuccessful sciences. \u201cMethods\u201d should be construed broadly\nhere to encompass not only, say, the experimental method, but also the\nstyles of explanation (e.g., identification of causes that determine,\nceteris paribus, their effects) employed in the sciences.\nSuch a view does not presuppose the methodological unity of\nthe various sciences, only that successful sciences have some\nmethodological uniqueness, even if this is not exactly the\nsame across all the sciences. Historically, Methods Continuity has\nconstituted the most important type of naturalism in philosophy; it\nis found in writers like Spinoza, Hume, and Nietzsche. (However,\nunlike the contemporary M-naturalists who draw on the actual\nresults of established sciences, many historical\nM-naturalists drawn to Methods Continuity simply try to\nemulate a scientific way of understanding the world in\ndeveloping their philosophical theories.)\n\nM-naturalists, then, construct philosophical theories that are\ncontinuous with the sciences either in virtue of their dependence upon\nthe actual results of scientific method in different domains or in\nvirtue of their employment and emulation of distinctively scientific\nways of looking at and explaining things. We may still distinguish\nbetween two different branches of M-naturalism, represented best by\nQuine, on the hand, and Goldman, on the other. The former we will call\nReplacement Naturalism, the latter Normative Naturalism.\nGoldman\u2019s paradigm of Normative Naturalism has dominated\nresearch in philosophy (see Kitcher 1992), though it is Quine\u2019s\nnotion of Replacement Naturalism that proves useful for understanding\nthe American Legal Realists as naturalists in legal philosophy (Leiter\n1997). Since both Replacement and Normative Naturalists share the\nmethodological commitment distinctive of naturalism\u2014to\nmake philosophical theorizing continuous with and dependent upon\nscientific theorizing\u2014the difference must be located elsewhere:\nnot in methodology, but in goal. According to Replacement Naturalists,\nthe goal of theorizing is description or explanation; to that end,\nconceptual and justificatory theories are to be replaced by\nempirical and descriptive theories. According to Normative\nNaturalists, the goal is regulation of practice through the\npromulgation of norms or standards. Of course, traditional\nepistemology also shares the regulative goal of Normative Naturalism;\nwhat distinguishes the Normative Naturalist is simply the\nmethods employed to realize this objective (cf. Goldman 1986,\npp. 6\u20139).\n\nMany naturalists go beyond methodological naturalism, however, and\nembrace a substantive doctrine. S-naturalism in philosophy is\neither the (ontological) view that the only things that exist are\nnatural or physical things; or the (semantic) view\nthat a suitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to\nbe amenable to empirical inquiry. In the ontological sense,\nS-naturalism is often taken to entail physicalism, the doctrine that\nonly those properties picked out by the laws of the physical sciences\nare real. In the semantic sense, S-naturalism is just the view that\npredicates must be analyzable in terms that admit of empirical\ninquiry: so, e.g., a semantic S-naturalist might claim that\n\u201cmorally good\u201d can be analyzed in terms of characteristics\nlike \u201cmaximizing human well-being\u201d that admit of empirical\ninquiry by psychology and physiology (assuming that well-being is a\ncomplex psycho-physical state).\n\nMany philosophers are drawn to some type of S-naturalism in virtue of\ntheir M-naturalism: being a philosophical naturalist in the\nmethodological sense sometimes leads a philosopher to think that the\nbest philosophical account of some concept or domain will be in terms\nthat are substantively naturalistic. However, it is important to\nnotice that a commitment to Methodological Naturalism does\nnot necessarily entail any substantive conclusions:\nmethodologically, it is an open question whether the best\nphilosophical account of morality or mentality or law must be in\nsubstantively naturalistic terms.\n\nThe varieties of philosophical naturalism map on to a variety of\nnaturalistic approaches in legal philosophy. The most radical version\nof M-naturalism, Replacement Naturalism, has been articulated and\ndefended by Leiter (2001b) and arguably by the American\nLegal Realists (Llewellyn 1930; Moore and Callahan 1943; Leiter 1997).\nThe less radical form of M-naturalism, Normative Naturalism, is\nexemplified in epistemology by Goldman (1978, 1986), but its\nimplications for jurisprudence and law have been, to date, only partly\ndeveloped (Allen & Leiter 2001; Goldman 1999; Leiter 1998; Talbott\n& Goldman 1998). S-naturalism features most prominently in the\nwritings of the Scandinavian Legal Realists. S-naturalism has also\nplayed a role in motivating Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\nlegal-philosophical tradition. More recently, S-naturalism without\nnormative skepticism has been defended by contemporary moral realists\nand natural law theorists like Brink (1988, 1989, 2001) and Moore\n(1985, 1992b).\n2. Replacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis\n\nReplacement Naturalism holds that conceptual and justificatory\ntheories\u2014the traditional fare of philosophy\u2014are to be\nreplaced by empirical and descriptive theories. There are two\nkinds of argumentative routes to Replacement Naturalism, both\ntraceable to Quine: the first arises from doubts about the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction (Quine 1951); the second from doubts\nabout foundationalism (Quine 1969). Here we consider the former.\n\nPhilosophers have long thought that some truths were\nnecessary while others were contingent; in the\ntwentieth century, under the influence of logical positivism, this was\ntaken to be the distinction between those statements that were\n\u201ctrue in virtue of meaning\u201d (hence necessarily\ntrue) and those that were \u201ctrue in virtue of fact\u201d (hence\nonly contingently true). The former \u201canalytic\u201d\ntruths were the proper domain of philosophy; the latter\n\u201csynthetic\u201d truths the proper domain of empirical science.\nQuine argued that the distinction could not be sustained: all\nstatements are, in principle, answerable to experience, and,\nconversely, all statements can be maintained in the face of experience\nas long as we adjust other parts of our picture of the world. So there\nis no hard distinction between claims that are \u201ctrue in virtue\nof meaning\u201d and \u201ctrue in virtue of facts,\u201d or\nbetween \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d truths;\nthere is simply the socio-historical fact that, at any given point in\nthe history of inquiry, there are some statements we are unlikely to\ngive up in the face of recalcitrant empirical evidence and others that\nwe are quite willing to give up in light of new empirical\nevidence.\n\nWithout a domain of analytic truths\u2014truths that are a\npriori and hold in virtue of meaning\u2014it becomes unclear\nwhat special domain of expertise for philosophical reflection remains.\nIf all claims are, in principle, revisable in light of empirical\nevidence, why not let all questions fall to empirical science?\nPhilosophy would be out of business, except perhaps as the abstract,\nreflective branch of empirical science. This Quinean attack has\nconsequences for the traditional philosophical business of conceptual\nanalysis, since on the dominant view from Plato through Carnap\n\u201cevery analysis of a concept is inextricably bound to a\ncollection of purported analyticities\u201d (Laurence & Margolis\n1999, p. 18). The conclusion Replacement Naturalists draw from the\npreceding is that since any claim of conceptual analysis is vulnerable\nto the demands of a posteriori (i.e., empirical) theory\nconstruction, philosophy must proceed in tandem with empirical\nscience, not as the arbiter of its claims, but as a reflective attempt\nat synoptic clarity about the state of empirical knowledge.\n\nMany resist this conclusion. According to one proponent, a conceptual\nanalysis proceeds \u201cby appeal to what seems to us most obvious\nand central about [the concept in question]\u2026as revealed by our\nintuitions about possible cases\u201d (Jackson 1998, p. 31).\n\u201c[T]he general coincidence in intuitive responses [to possible\ncases] reveals something about the folk theory of [the concept in\nquestion]\u201d (Jackson, 1998, p. 32). But the question that plagues\nconceptual analysis, post-Quine, is what kind of knowledge\nsuch a procedure actually yields. Why should ordinary intuitions about\nthe extension of a concept be deemed reliable or informative? Why\nthink the \u201cfolk\u201d are right?\n\nThe track record of a priori methods like appeal to\nintuitions and conceptual analysis is not a promising one (e.g.,\nHarman 1994; Hintikka 1999). Kant, for example, took it to be a\npriori that space necessarily had the structure described by\nEuclidean geometry; subsequent physics showed his intuitions to be\nmistaken. The lesson naturalists draw from this track record of a\npriori philosophy is well-expressed by Cummins (1999, pp.\n117\u201318):\n\nWe can give up on intuitions about the nature of space and time and\nask instead what sort of beasts space and time must be if current\nphysical theory is to be true and explanatory. We can give up on\nintuitions about representational content and ask instead what\nrepresentation must be if current cognitive theory is to be true and\nexplanatory.\n\n\nFor the Replacement Naturalist, in short, the only sound reason to\nprefer a proposed conceptual analysis is not because it seems\nintuitively obvious, but because it earns its place by figuring in\nsuccessful a posteriori theories of the world. Philosophy\nqua conceptual analysis and intuition-pumping should be\nabandoned in favor of empirical science; philosophy is simply the more\nabstract and reflective part of empirical science and lays claim to no\ndistinctive methods or body of knowledge.\n\nDefenders of conceptual analysis, it is true, commonly proclaim the\nmodesty of their ambitions. Indeed, Frank Jackson specifically\nchastises conceptual analysis in its \u201cimmodest role,\u201d\nnamely when \u201cit gives intuitions\u2026too big a place in\ndetermining what the world is like\u201d (1998, pp. 43\u201344):\n\u201cThere is nothing sacrosanct about folk theory. It has served us\nwell but not so well that it would be irrational to make changes to it\nin the light of reflection on exactly what it involves, and in the\nlight of one or another empirical discovery about us and our\nworld\u201d (Jackson 1998, p. 44). The question is, having conceded\nthis much, what remains? Conceptual analysis, as Jackson conceives it,\nbecomes hard to distinguish from banal descriptive sociology of the\nGallup-poll variety. (Jackson even says he advocates, when necessary,\n\u201cdoing serious opinion polls on people\u2019s responses to\nvarious cases\u201d [1998, p. 36].) Such a procedure might deliver\nsome insight about what some people, at some time, in some place,\nthink about \u201cmind\u201d or \u201claw\u201d or\n\u201cjustice,\u201d but Replacement Naturalists wonder what\nphilosophical import any of this data could have, since it is bounded\nnot simply by time and place, but also by ignorance. Yet, as Ian\nFarrell (2006) has argued, such a procedure may serve an important\ntheoretical purpose, even if its claims are vulnerable to\nrevision.\n\nHow might Replacement Naturalism in legal philosophy, motivated by\nthese Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis and intuitions,\nproceed? Leiter (2001b) suggests one possibility, which invokes the\nfollowing example. Joseph Raz (1985) has offered an influential\nconceptual argument against Soft Legal Positivism\u2019s claim that\nthere is no constraint on the content of a rule of recognition beyond\nthe fact that it is a social rule: its existence-conditions are given\nby the actual practice of officials in deciding disputes, but what\ncriteria of legality officials appeal to (i.e., the content\nof the rule of recognition) is dependent upon whatever the\nconventional practice of officials in that society happens to be. Raz\noffers an analysis of the concept of authority to show that Soft\nPositivism is incompatible, even in principle, with the law\u2019s\nhaving the authority it claims to have. According to Raz, it is a\nnon-normative prerequisite for a claim to authority that it be\npossible to identify the authority\u2019s directive without reference\nto the underlying \u201cdependent\u201d reasons for that directive.\nThis is a prerequisite for authority because what\ndistinguishes a (practical) authority, on Raz\u2019s\n\u201cservice\u201d conception, is that its directives preempt\nconsideration of the underlying reasons for what we ought to do, and\nthereby make it more likely that we will do what we really ought to\ndo. Authoritative reasons are claimed to be exclusionary reasons,\nexcluding from consideration those dependent reasons (including,\nimportantly, moral reasons) on which the authoritative directive\nrests. Soft Positivism, then, undermines the possibility of the rule\nof recognition claiming authority, since for Soft Positivism a rule of\nrecognition can, in principle, employ dependent reasons as criteria of\nlegal validity. Thus, it would be impossible to identify such a\nrule of recognition\u2019s directives about legal validity without\nrecourse to precisely the dependent reasons the rule was supposed to\npreempt.\n\nOne line of response to Raz has appealed to contrary intuitions about\nthe concept of authority. Stephen Perry (1987), for example, argues\nthat authoritative reasons need not be exclusionary in Raz\u2019s\nsense; it suffices, Perry says, that they simply be\n\u201cweightier\u201d than other reasons. Some commentators\u2019\nintuitions line up with Raz\u2019s (Leiter 2001b), others with Perry\n(Waluchow 1994). Now, of course, the Quinean worries about conceptual\nanalysis hold even in cases where everyone\u2019s intuitions about a\nconcept coincide; but when they do not coincide, the inadequacies of\nthe philosophical methods at hand seem especially acute. Some\nproponents of traditional methods of legal philosophy object that\n\u201cthe mere fact that there is disagreement about what the\nconceptual truths of law are\u2026does not mean that conceptual\nanalysis of law is fruitless. If that were the case, we should have to\nconclude the same about philosophy generally\u201d (Coleman 2001, p.\n211 n. 38). Unfortunately, this reductio response depends on\na conclusion that the Replacement Naturalist is, in fact, prepared to\nembrace\u2014and not because the Replacement Naturalist naively\nbelieves empirical methods \u201cwould\u2026put an end to disputes\nabout the nature of law or anything else\u201d (Coleman 2001, p. 211\nn.38). The worry, rather, is that intuitions about concepts enjoy no\nprivileged epistemic status, while claims in empirical science do.\nEven if empirical science does not resolve these disputes, it at least\ndelineates criteria with epistemic weight for adjudicating them. The\ncrucial question, then, becomes whether our best empirical science\nrequires drawing the conceptual lines one way rather than another.\n\nThe leading social-scientific accounts of judicial\ndecision-making\u2014both the informal ones (Pritchett 1949; Powe\n2000) and the formal ones (Segal & Spaeth 1993)\u2014have two\nstriking features in this regard. First, they all aim to account\nfor the relative causal contribution of \u201claw\u201d and non-law\nfactors (e.g., political ideologies or \u201cattitudes\u201d) to\njudicial decisions. Second, they demarcate \u201claw\u201d from\nnon-law factors in typical Hard Positivist terms, i.e., they generally\ntreat as \u201claw\u201d only pedigreed norms, like legislative\nenactments and prior holdings of courts (as well as, sometimes, the\ninterpretive methods applied to these kinds of legal sources: see the\ntreatment of the \u201clegal model\u201d in Segal & Spaeth 1993,\npp. 33\u201353). If these models were ultimately vindicated\nempirically\u2014and not just for American courts\u2014this would\ngive the Replacement Naturalist reason to abandon any a\npriori, intuitive confidence we had about the concept of law that\nconflicted with Hard Positivism\u2014just as the role of\nnon-Euclidean geometry in parts of physics has led everyone\nto repudiate Kant\u2019s a priori intuitive confidence about\nthe Euclidean structure of space. If social science really cuts the\ncausal joints of the legal world in Hard Positivist terms, the\nReplacement Naturalist argues, that is a compelling reason to work\nwith that concept of law as against its competitors.\n\nProponents of conceptual analysis, by contrast, are skeptical that the\nexplanatory premises of empirical social scientists give us any reason\nto prefer one concept of law to another. Notice, of course, that an\nanalogous skepticism is available to the diehard Euclidean: after all,\nnon-Euclidean geometries are famously non-intuitive and hard to grasp.\nBut even those sympathetic to Kant\u2019s view that space is\nnecessarily Euclidean would have to admit that such a response would\nbe unmotivated: if non-Euclidean geometry does explanatory work within\nsuccessful physical theory, then the right conclusion to draw is that\nour intuitions about the structure of space need tutoring to keep pace\nwith empirical knowledge. So, too, the analogous question for the\nnatural lawyer or Soft Positivist is: why think your intuitions are\nepistemically privileged as opposed to simply untutored by the best\nempirical science?\n\nThe skeptic, however, might refine the challenge as follows:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she might say, \u201cthat I insist on\nsticking to my intuitions, empirical science be damned. Rather, I do\nnot see why the empirical science at issue needs to take\nsides on a dispute about the concept of law.\u201d Of course, it is\nclear that the empirical social science at issue draws the line\nbetween legal and non-legal norms based on pedigree criteria, but the\nquestion is whether it needs to: the natural lawyer could\nagree with the social scientists that, e.g., moral and political\nconsiderations determine judicial decisions, but contest the\nassumption that these considerations are not themselves legally\nbinding.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is that the candidate non-law explanatory\nfactors at issue (e.g., an ideological commitment to the Republican\nParty platform) are not plausible candidates for being legal norms, on\nany existing theory of the concept of law. Moreover, there are good\nreasons why social science treats the explanatory factors at issue as\nnon-legal. For example, the moral and political attitudes invoked\nto explain decisions do not appear explicitly in the text of judicial\nopinions or in courts\u2019 explicit rationales for\nreaching particular outcomes; they are often hidden and\nhard to detect, which makes them quite unlike any of the\nparadigm instances of legal norms, such as statutory provisions or\njudicial precedents. Finally, the legal/non-legal demarcation in\nempirical social science usually reflects more general explanatory\npremises about the psycho-social factors that account for behavior,\nwell beyond the realm of the legal. The motivation for demarcating the\nlegal/non-legal in essentially Hard Positivist terms is, for most\nsocial scientists, to effect an explanatory unification of legal\nphenomena with other political and social behavior.\n\nYet the very talk of \u201clegal phenomena\u201d may invite a\ndifferent kind of objection to the proposed naturalization of\njurisprudential questions. For how is it, one might wonder, that the\nsocial scientist knows these are legal phenomena he is\nexplaining, and not phenomena of some other kind? Does that not\nalready presuppose an analysis of the concept of law? (Cf. Coleman\n2001, pp. 213\u2013214.) It is not obvious, though, why a shared\nlanguage and dictionaries (or even an explicit definition of terms,\nas, for example, Newton deploys at the start of Principia\nMathematica) won\u2019t often suffice to get empirical science\noff the ground. It is not that empirical science needs\nconceptual analysis to tell this explanatory story, it\u2019s rather\nthat after the fact the philosopher may be able to offer some\ngreater reflective clarity about the concepts invoked in the\nexplanatory story. To the extent a conceptual analysis helps, it helps\nafter we discover which way of cutting the causal joints of\nthe social world works best, according to the naturalist.\n\nAll these rejoinders on behalf of naturalism, however, are predicated\non the assumption that we have a robust social-scientific account of\nlaw. Yet it is now plain we do not. (See, e.g., Leiter 2007, pp. 192\nff.) The best social-scientific accounts of adjudication, for\nexample, boast predictive success that is so feeble (better than\ncoin-tosses, but not much!) that their explanatory models, with their\nimplicit concepts of law, earn no epistemic credence. When it comes to\nthe \u201cconcept of law\u201d itself, we may have nothing more than\nintuitions, however epistemically feeble, on which to rely. And\nperhaps they are not as epistemically feeble as the naturalist\noriginally thought? Law, after all, is not a natural kind, but a\ncomplicated kind of social artifact, and it seems far more plausible\nthat social artifacts will depend on folk intuitions and how people\nuse language: so perhaps traditional conceptual-analytic methodology,\nof the kind H.L.A. Hart utilized in The Concept of\nLaw, is the right one after all for its subject-matter (cf.\nLanglinais & Leiter 2016)?\n3. Replacement Naturalism II: American Legal Realism\n\nThe locus classicus of the second kind of Replacement\nNaturalism\u2014the one deriving from an attack on\nfoundationalism\u2014is Quine\u2019s \u201cEpistemology\nNaturalized\u201d (1969). The central enterprise of epistemology\non Quine\u2019s view is to understand the relation between our\ntheories of the world and the evidence (sensory input) on which they\nare based. Quine\u2019s target is one influential construal of this\nproject: Cartesian foundationalism, particularly in the sophisticated\nform given to it in the twentieth century by Rudolf Carnap in Der\nLogische Aufbau der Welt (1928). The foundationalist wants an\naccount of the theory-evidence relation that would vindicate the\nprivileged epistemic status of at least some subset of our theories:\nour theories (in particular, our best theories of natural science) are\nto be \u201cgrounded\u201d in indubitable evidence (i.e., immediate\nsense impressions). Quine deems foundationalism a failure: the\nsemantic part of the program is rendered unrealizable by meaning\nholism (theoretical terms get their meanings from their place in\nthe whole theoretical framework, not in virtue of some point-by-point\ncontact with sensory input), while the epistemic part of the program\nis defeated by the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis about the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence (there is always more than\none theory consistent with the evidence, in part because a\ntheoretical hypothesis can always be preserved in the face of\nrecalcitrant evidence by abandoning the auxiliary hypotheses that\ninformed the test of the hypothesis) (see Kim 1988, pp.\n385\u2013386).\n\nWhat becomes, then, of epistemology? Hilary Kornblith has summed up\nQuine\u2019s view as follows: \u201cOnce we see the sterility of the\nfoundationalist program, we see that the only genuine questions there\nare to ask about the relation between theory and evidence and about\nthe acquisition of belief are psychological questions\u201d\n(Kornblith 1994, p. 4). Kornblith aptly dubs this view Quine\u2019s\n\u201creplacement thesis\u201d: \u201cthe view that epistemological\nquestions may be replaced by psychological questions\u201d (Kornblith\n1994, p. 3). Here is how Quine puts it:\n\nThe stimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody\nhas had to go on, ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the world.\nWhy not just see how this construction really proceeds? Why not settle\nfor psychology? Such a surrender of the epistemological burden to\npsychology is a move that was disallowed in earlier time as circular\nreasoning. If the epistemologist\u2019s goal is validation of the\ngrounds of empirical science, he defeats his purpose by using\npsychology or other empirical science in the validation. However, such\nscruples against circularity have little point once we have stopped\ndreaming of deducing science from observations. (1969, pp.\n75\u201376)\n\n\nSeveral pages later, Quine continues that on his proposal,\n\nEpistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a\nchapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a\nnatural phenomenon, viz., a physical subject. This human subject is\naccorded a certain experientially controlled input\u2014certain\npatterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for\ninstance\u2014and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as\noutput a description of the three-dimensional external world and its\nhistory. The relation between the meager input and the torrential\noutput is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the\nsame reasons that always prompted epistemology; namely, in order to\nsee how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one\u2019s\ntheory of nature transcends any available evidence. (1969, pp.\n82\u201383)\n\n\nThus, according to Quine, the central concern of epistemology is\nthe theory-evidence relationship; if the foundationalist story about\nthis relationship is a failure, then that leaves only one story worth\ntelling about this relationship: namely, the story told by \u201ca\npurely descriptive, causal-nomological science of human\ncognition\u201d (Kim 1988, p. 388). The science of human cognition\nreplaces armchair epistemology: we naturalize epistemology by\nturning over its central question\u2014the relationship between\ntheory and evidence\u2014to the relevant empirical science.\n\nWe can now generalize Quine\u2019s point as follows (Leiter 1998).\nLet us say that a Replacement Naturalist in any branch of philosophy\nholds that:\n\nFor any pair of relata that might stand in a justificatory\nrelation\u2014e.g., evidence and theory, reasons and belief, causal\nhistory and semantic or intentional content, legal reasons and\njudicial decision\u2014if no normative account of the relation is\npossible, then the only theoretically fruitful account is the\ndescriptive/explanatory account given by the relevant science of that\ndomain.\n\n\nThis goes beyond Quine in one important respect: for Quine infers\nReplacement Naturalism only from the failure of\nfoundationalism\u2014which is simply one possible normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship, but not the only one.\nQuine\u2019s arguments simply do not show that no other normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship is possible.\n\nQuine has been extensively criticized on precisely this score (e.g.,\nGoldman 1986, pp. 2\u20133; Kim 1988). The key to a successful\ndefense of Replacement Naturalism lies in an explanation of why\nnormative theory without foundationalism is sterile. One\nworry is that without foundationalism, normative theories are\nbanal. Consider: it is now a familiar result of cognitive\npsychology that human beings regularly make mistakes in logical\nreasoning (cf. Stich 1994). So a mere descriptive theory of\nbelief-formation, of the sort Quine appears to recommend, would simply\nrecord these mistakes. But shouldn\u2019t epistemology tell us that\nbeliefs ought not to be formed illogically? One can hardly\nimagine why Quine would disagree: one ought not to form\nbeliefs illogically. But the question is whether this piece of banal\nadvice adds up to a fruitful research program. The descriptive project\nof Replacement Naturalism may record certain irrational cognitive\nprocesses in studying the evidence-theory relationship, but given the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, even when we correct for\nlogical mistakes, we still won\u2019t have an account of which of our\ntheoretical beliefs are warranted and which are not. The Quinean\nintuition is that we\u2019ll learn more from the empirical inquiry\nthan from systematizing our banal normative intuitions about\nirrationality. More generally, unless we have some\nfoundational point outside our epistemic practices from which to\nassess the epistemic issues, the project of systematizing our mundane\nnormative intuitions will simply collapse into the descriptive\nsociology of knowledge. If we can\u2019t stand outside the\nepistemological boat, then we can do no more than report what it is we\ndo. But it is precisely the viability of such an external standpoint\nthat Quine denies in his embrace of the metaphor of Neurath\u2019s\nboat. So from within the boat, there is nothing to do but\ndescription.\n\nQuine\u2019s argument for Replacement Naturalism, recall, moved in\ntwo steps. Step one was anti-foundationalism: no unique\ntheory is justified on the basis of the evidential input. Step two was\nreplacement: since no foundational story can be told about\nthe relation between input (evidence) and output (theory), we should\nreplace the normative program with a purely descriptive inquiry, e.g.\nthe psychological study of what input causes what output. We can find\nanalogues of both steps in the approach to the theory of adjudication\noffered by American Legal Realism.\n\nTheory of adjudication is concerned not with the relationship\nbetween \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cscientific theory,\u201d\nbut rather with the justificatory relationship between \u201clegal\nreasons\u201d (the input, as it were) and judicial decision (the\noutput): theory of adjudication tries to tell judges how they\nought to justify their decisions, i.e., it seeks to\n\u201cground\u201d judicial decision-making in reasons that require\nunique outcomes. The American Legal Realists are\n\u201canti-foundationalists\u201d about judicial decisions in the\nsense that they deny that the legal reasons justify a unique decision:\nthe legal reasons underdetermine the decision, at least in most cases\nactually litigated. More precisely, the Realists claim that the law is\nrationally indeterminate in the sense that the class of legal\nreasons\u2014i.e., the class of legitimate reasons a judge may offer\nfor a decision\u2014does not provide a justification for a\nunique outcome. Just as sensory input does not justify a\nunique scientific theory, so legal reasons, according to the Realists,\ndo not justify a unique decision.\n\nThe Realists also take the second step that Quine takes: replacement.\nAccording to the Realist indeterminacy thesis, legal reasons do not\njustify a unique decision, meaning that the foundationalist enterprise\nof theory of adjudication is impossible. Why not replace, then, the\n\u201csterile\u201d foundational program of justifying some unique\nlegal outcome on the basis of the applicable legal reasons with a\ndescriptive/explanatory account of what input (i.e., what combination\nof facts and reasons) produces what output (i.e., what judicial\ndecision)? As Underhill Moore puts it at the beginning of one of his\narticles: \u201cThis study lies within the province of jurisprudence.\nIt also lies within the field of behavioristic psychology. It places\nthe province within the field\u201d (Moore & Callahan 1943, p.\n1). Notice how closely this echoes Quine\u2019s idea that,\n\u201cEpistemology\u2026simply falls into place as a chapter of\npsychology\u2026\u201d (1969, p. 82). Jurisprudence\u2014or, more\nprecisely, the theory of adjudication\u2014is\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d because it falls into place, for the\nRealist, as a chapter of psychology (or economics or sociology, etc.).\nMoreover, it does so for essentially Quinean reasons: because the\nfoundational account of adjudication is a failure\u2014a consequence\nof accepting the Realists\u2019 famous claim that the law is\nindeterminate.\n\nOf course, this argument for Replacement Naturalism only seems to work\nagainst \u201cformalist\u201d theories of adjudication that are\ncommitted to the rational determinacy of law. But, some object,\n\u201cNo contemporary analytic jurisprudent is a formalist\u201d\n(Coleman 1998, p. 284), and some have even claimed that the\n\u201cformalists\u201d the Legal Realists opposed were not committed\nto the rational determinacy of law (Paulson 2001, p. 78). Both\nobjections seem mistaken: Ronald Dworkin, for example, is committed to\nthe rational determinacy of law in exactly the sense at issue for the\nReplacement argument. The targets of the Legal Realist critique were,\nequally, committed to the rational determinacy of law (Etchemendy\n2021); indeed, it would be impossible to make sense of what the\nRealists were doing if that were not so. The Replacement Naturalist\nmight take the view that there is no reason to call for\n\u201cnaturalizing\u201d theory of adjudication in the range of\ncases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of\nlegal outcomes (i.e., precisely those cases where the foundationalist\nprogram can be carried out). One may worry, again, about whether there\nis an interesting or fruitful normative story to be\ntold (rather than a merely banal descriptive sociology), but it\nsuffices for the analogy with Quine that there remains some\nsubstantial domain of cases where the foundationalist program cannot\nbe carried out, so that the case for replacement remains intact.\n\nThe real difficulty, of course, pertains not to these historical\npoints, but to whether or not the project of a normative theory of\nadjudication warrants replacement just because rational determinacy\ndoes not obtain. As in the Quinean case, the Replacement Naturalist\nmust maintain that without rational determinacy, normative theories of\nadjudication are banal, mere exercises in descriptive sociology.\nCritics of Replacement Naturalism contest this conclusion, though more\nby way of affirmation than argument (Coleman 1998, p. 285 n. 44).\nHowever, if the objection under consideration were correct, then a\nnormative theory that specifies what the anti-foundationalist\nconcedes\u2014namely, that there is more than one (though not simply\nany) judicial decision that can be justified on the basis of the class\nof legal reasons\u2014must, in some measure, be a theory worth\nhaving. Arguably, such a theory might be adequate to deflect the\nchallenge to the political legitimacy of adjudication based\non the indeterminacy of law, but does it provide the\nnormative guidance to judges we want from a theory? Does a\ntheory that tells judges they would be justified (on the basis of the\nclass of legal reasons) in deciding for the plaintiff on theory\nX or the defendant on theory Y (but not the\nplaintiff or defendant on theory Z!) really provide normative guidance\nfor judges worth having? The Replacement Naturalist answers in the\nnegative: better to have a descriptive account of inputs and outputs,\none that would license prediction of judicial behavior, than an\nindeterminate normative theory. This response, of course, makes\nReplacement Naturalism vulnerable to conflicting intuitions about the\nfruitfulness or sterility of different kinds of theorizing.\n\nThere are other limits to the Quinean analogy (Leiter 2001a, pp.\n284\u2013285; Greenberg 2011 disputes other aspects of the analogy,\nwhile Leiter 2011 replies to some of Greenberg\u2019s objections).\nFirst, the American Legal Realists end up presupposing a theory of the\nconcept of legality in framing their arguments for law\u2019s\nindeterminacy (Leiter 2001a, pp. 292\u2013293); thus, while they may\nbelieve that the only fruitful account of adjudication is\ndescriptive and empirical, not normative and conceptual, they\nthemselves need a concept of law that is not\u2014at least\non the arguments considered so far\u2014empirical or naturalized. As\none critic of Replacement Naturalism notes: \u201cthe naturalist is\ncommitted as a conceptual matter to the existence of a test of\nlegality\u2026. The naturalist is thus in the same boat with every\nother analytic philosopher of law\u201d (Coleman 2001, p. 214). The\nanalogy with naturalized epistemology, in other words, must be\nlocalized to the theory of adjudication, and not the whole of\njurisprudence. Of course, it remains possible for the Replacement\nNaturalist to argue for the requisite concept of legality on precisely\nthe empirical grounds noted in the previous section\n(\u201cReplacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis\u201d).\nBut as it stands, the analogy to Quine\u2019s attack on\nfoundationalist epistemology warrants no radical abandonment of\ntraditional conceptual analysis across the board.\n\nA second difference from Quine is also important. The crux of the\nLegal Realist position (at least for the majority of Realists) is that\nnon-legal reasons (e.g., judgments of fairness, or consideration of\ncommercial norms) explain the decisions. They, of course,\nexplain the decisions by justifying them, though not\nnecessarily by justifying a unique outcome (i.e., the non-legal\nreasons might themselves rationalize other decisions as well). Now\nclearly the descriptive story about the non-legal reasons is not going\nto be part of a non-mentalistic naturalization of the theory of\nadjudication: a causal explanation of decisions in terms of reasons\n(even non-legal reasons) does require taking the normative force of\nthe reasons qua reasons seriously. The behaviorism of Quine\nor Underhill Moore is not in the offing here, but surely this is to be\npreferred: behaviorism failed as a foundation for empirical social\nscience, while social-scientific theories employing mentalistic\ncategories have flourished. Moreover, if the non-legal reasons are\nthemselves indeterminate\u2014i.e., if they do not justify a\nunique outcome\u2014then any causal explanation of the\ndecision will have to go beyond reasons to identify the psycho-social\nfacts (e.g., about personality, class, gender, socialization, etc.)\nthat cause the decision. Such a \u201cnaturalization\u201d of the\ntheory of adjudication might be insufficiently austere in its ontology\nfor Quinean scruples, but it is still a recognizable attempt to\nsubsume what judges do within a (social) scientific framework.\n4. Normative Naturalism\n\nLike the traditional epistemologist, the Normative Naturalist embraces\nas his goal the promulgation of norms by which to regulate our\nepistemic practices\u2014to govern how we should acquire and weigh\nevidence, and ultimately form beliefs. Unlike the non-naturalist,\nhowever, the Normative Naturalist does not think epistemic norms can\nbe adequately formulated from the armchair: normative theorizing must\nbe continuous with scientific theorizing. But if this is not just to\ncollapse into Replacement Naturalism, then what does the M-naturalist\ncredo amount to in the normative case? Consider Goldman\u2019s\nproposal: \u201cEpistemics assumes that cognitive operations should\nbe assessed instrumentally: given a choice of cognitive procedures,\nthose which would produce the best set of consequences should\nbe selected\u201d (1978, p. 520). The Normative Naturalist maintains\nthat the reason the philosopher can\u2019t do armchair epistemology\nis because it is an a posteriori, empirical matter what norms\nin fact serve our epistemic or cognitive goals (e.g., forming\ntrue beliefs). Goldman emphasizes a particularly important instance of\nthis general point:\n\n[A]dvice in matters intellectual, as in other matters, should take\naccount of the agent\u2019s capacities. There is no point in\nrecommending procedures that cognizers cannot follow or recommending\nresults that cognizers cannot attain. As in the ethical sphere,\n\u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan.\u201d Traditional\nepistemology has often ignored this precept. Epistemological rules\noften seem to have been addressed to \u201cideal\u201d cognizers,\nnot human beings with limited information-processing resources.\nEpistemics [as a type of Normative Naturalism] wishes to take its\nregulative role seriously. It does not want to give merely idle\nadvice, which humans are incapable of following. This means it must\ntake account of the powers and limits of the human cognitive system,\nand this requires attention to descriptive psychology. (1978, p. 510)\n\n\nSo the Normative Naturalist thinks that normative epistemology must be\ncontinuous with natural and social science in (at least) two senses:\n(i) we need to know what epistemic norms in fact lead to our forming\ntrue beliefs; and (ii) as a special case of (i), we need to identify\nepistemic norms actually usable by creatures like us. This rules out\ncertain (non-naturalistic) epistemic norms which require of cognizers\nbelief-formation practices beyond their ken (Goldman 1978, pp.\n512\u2013513). The Normative Naturalist, in short, emphasizes the\ninstrumental character of normative theorizing in\nepistemology, and then argues that the only way to assess instrumental\nclaims is empirically\u2014to see what means really brings\nabout what ends. And that task can never be pursued a priori,\nfrom the armchair.\n\nOf course, it bears noting that the Normative Naturalist does not\ndispense entirely with conceptual analysis\u2014to the\ncontrary. It is precisely, for example, Goldman\u2019s proffered\nconceptual analyses of \u201cknowledge\u201d and\n\u201cjustification\u201d that require him to turn to empirical\npsychology to fill in the actual content of epistemic norms. Unlike\nthe Quinean program, naturalization enters for the Normativist only,\nas it were, in applied epistemology. What many philosophers\nmight think of as \u201cpure\u201d epistemology\u2014giving an\naccount of knowledge\u2014continues to be an a priori\nenterprise, even though it is an enterprise that invokes notions (like\n\u201creliability\u201d and \u201ccausation\u201d) that require\na posteriori investigation to apply.\n\nThe Normative Naturalist in jurisprudence, too, views theoretical\nquestions instrumentally. The philosophical foundation of\nevidence law has, to date, received the most attention from this\nperspective (Allen & Leiter 2001; Broughton & Leiter 2021). We\nwant to ask, as Goldman puts it, \u201cWhich [social] practices have\na comparatively favorable impact on knowledge as contrasted with error\nand ignorance?\u201d (1999, p. 5). Normative naturalism is, in this\nrespect, veritistic (to borrow Goldman\u2019s term): it is\nconcerned with the production of knowledge, meaning (in part)\ntrue belief (Goldman 1999, pp. 79\u2013100). So the\nNormative Naturalist embraces as his goal the promulgation of norms by\nwhich to regulate our epistemic practices so that they yield\nknowledge. In the case of individual epistemology, this means\nthe norms governing how individuals should acquire and weigh evidence\nas well as, ultimately, form beliefs; in the case of social\nepistemology, this means the norms governing the social mechanisms and\npractices that inculcate belief. The legal rules of evidence, in turn,\nare a prime case of the latter: for these rules structure the\nepistemic process by which trial jurors arrive at beliefs about\ndisputed matters of fact. As such, the rules of evidence are a natural\ncandidate for investigation by Normative Naturalists. We may ask of\nany particular rule: does it increase the likelihood that jurors will\nreach true beliefs about disputed matters of fact? (Of\ncourse, it does not make sense to ask that of every rule,\nsince some rules of evidence\u2014for example, Federal Rules of\nEvidence (FRE) 407\u2013411\u2014are not meant to facilitate the\ndiscovery of truth, but to carry out various policy objectives like\nreducing accidents and avoiding litigation.) That means, of course,\nasking an essentially empirical question: does a given rule\nof evidentiary inclusion or exclusion in fact increase the\nlikelihood that fact finders, given what they are actually\nlike, will achieve knowledge about disputed matters of fact\n(i.e., does it maximize veritistic value)? Of course, many rules\nthat on their face invite one kind of veritistic analysis require a\nvery different kind in practice. So, for example, FRE 404, on its\nface, excludes character evidence in most contexts, though, in\nfact, the exception in 404(b) largely swallows the rule. Thus, while\nit might seem that we should ask whether excluding character\nevidence maximizes veritistic value, the real question is whether\nadmitting it does. The same may be said for the hearsay rule.\nAlthough on its face, the hearsay doctrine is a rule of exclusion, in\nreality it is a rule of admission: what the advocate must really know\nis how to get the proffered hearsay admitted under one of the\nmultitude of exceptions to the nominal rule of exclusion (FRE 802).\nThus, the pertinent veritistic question concerns the veritistic\ncredentials of the grounds on which hearsay is admitted, rather than\nthe veritistic reasons for excluding it in most cases. (Such\nquestions, in fact, are already a staple of much evidence\nscholarship.)\n\nIn theory of adjudication, by contrast, the Normative Naturalist wants\nto identify norms for adjudication that will help judges realize\nadjudicative goals. Such norms must, once again, satisfy two\nnaturalistic constraints: first, they must, as a matter of empirical\nfact, be effective means to goals (\u201cthe Instrumental\nConstraint\u201d); second, they must be constrained by relevant\nempirical facts about the nature and limitations of judges (\u201cthe\nOught-Implies-Can Constraint\u201d) (Leiter 1998).\n\nDworkin\u2019s theory of adjudication (Dworkin 1986) makes a popular\ntarget for the Normative Naturalist. Dworkin\u2019s theory says, very\nroughly, that a judge should decide a case in such a way that it\ncoheres with the principle that explains some significant\nportion of the prior institutional history and provides the\nbest justification for that history as a matter of political\nmorality. Can a Normative Naturalist be a Dworkinian?\n\n(1) Instrumental Constraint: The naturalist assesses\nnormative advice relative to its actual effectiveness for realizing\nrelevant goals. What, then, is the relevant goal in\nadjudication? One candidate is surely this: we want to give\njudges normative advice that will lead them to reach fair or just\noutcomes. Thus, the naturalist\u2019s question becomes: which piece\nof normative advice is most effective in really helping\nactual judges realize justice and fairness? It is, at least, an open\nquestion whether Dworkin\u2019s methodology will be effective in\nleading judges to do fair things. The fact that his normative theory\nhas had almost no impact whatsoever on American judicial practice over\nthe last forty years is at least defeasible evidence that it does not\nappear to be an effective methodology (let alone one\neffective for realizing justice!) (Leiter 1998, p. 102). This latter\npoint is related to the naturalist\u2019s second, and more important,\nobjection.\n\n(2) Ought-Implies-Can-Constraint: One thing judges\ncannot do is what Dworkin\u2019s Judge Hercules does. This is a\nfamiliar complaint about Dworkin\u2019s theory, but naturalized\njurisprudence gives it a principled foundation. The naturalistic\njurisprudent eschews all normative guidance unusable by real judges;\nlike his naturalized counterpart in epistemology, he does \u201cnot\nwant to give merely idle advice, which humans [including judges] are\nincapable of following\u201d (Goldman 1978, p. 510). Dworkin may give\njudges an \u201caspirational model\u201d (to borrow Jules\nColeman\u2019s apt phrase), and the naturalistic jurisprudent need\nnot dispute that; but Descartes gave us an aspirational model in\nepistemology as well, and that does not make his program any more\nadequate or relevant by the naturalist\u2019s lights. (It\nwould be attractive if we could take certain \u201cclear and\ndistinct\u201d ideas, and build up all of knowledge from them.) The\nnaturalist wants normative advice effective for creatures like\nus; demanding of judges Herculean philosophical ingenuity\nviolates this constraint. Aspiration, the naturalist concludes, is not\na fit aim of normative advice, which must, first and foremost, offer\neffective means to ends.\n5. Substantive Naturalism\n\nSubstantive naturalism begins with the idea that there exist only\nnatural things, things of the kind natural science describes.\n(Physicalism, a more severe form of S-naturalism, holds that there are\nonly physical things.) This ontological S-naturalism may,\nthough need not, go with semantic S-naturalism, according to which a\nsuitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to be\namenable to empirical inquiry.\n\nS-naturalism has played a significant role in at least three\nlegal-philosophical traditions: (1) the Scandinavian Legal Realists\n(like Alf Ross and Karl Olivecrona), whose austere ontological\nnaturalism, conjoined with moral anti-realism, shaped their\ndistinctive take on legal concepts; (2) Legal Positivists, for whom\nS-naturalism can be, and sometimes has been, a significant motivation,\nand (3) contemporary defenders of a kind of natural law theory (like\nDavid Brink, Michael Moore, and Nicos Stavropoulos), who invoke the\nCausal Theory of Reference associated with Kripke and Putnam to offer\nan interpretation of some legal predicates in substantively\nnaturalistic terms.\n5.1 Scandinavian Legal Realism\n\nScandinavian Legal Realism stands out from other major traditions in\nlegal philosophy for expressly placing naturalism\u2014and\nS-naturalism in particular\u2014at center stage. Perhaps the most\nstriking example of this comes in the preface to the Second Edition of\nKarl Olivecrona\u2019s Law as Fact, where Olivecrona states\nthat the aim of his book is \u201cto fit the complex phenomena\ncovered by the word law into the spatio-temporal world\u201d (1971,\np. vii). But S-naturalism is equally prominent in Alf Ross\u2019\nOn Law and Justice (1959, p. 67; see also Spaak 2009, pp.\n40\u201342), probably the most internationally famous contribution to\nthe Scandinavian Realist tradition. Given the centrality of\nS-naturalism to Scandinavian Realism, it is unsurprising that a\nvariety of familiar naturalism-motivated philosophical gambits feature\nprominently in the major Scandinavian Realist texts. These include\nefforts at naturalistic reduction of legal concepts, as well as\nnon-cognitivist and error-theoretic accounts of important aspects of\nlegal discourse. (Some particular examples are discussed below.)\n\nThe S-naturalism of the Scandinavian Realists is today viewed more as\nan intellectual-historical museum piece than as a live contender in\njurisprudential debate. That Scandinavian Realism should have fallen\nout of favor is not altogether surprising, given the strong influence\nof logical positivism and the similar Uppsala school of philosophy on\nthe philosophical outlook and approach of the major Scandinavian\nRealists (Bjarup 1999, p. 774; see also Sandin 1962, p.\n496). Although many would still sympathize broadly with the\nScandinavian Realists\u2019 naturalism, anti-metaphysical\ninclinations, and moral anti-realism, their specific versions of these\ndoctrines have not, as a general matter, aged well. Be that as it may,\nthe poor long-term reception of the Scandinavians may be owed, in\nlarge part, to a rather more accidental cause: the influence of Hart\n(1959). In an influential review of Ross\u2019 On Law and\nJustice\u2014simply (and somewhat misleadingly) titled\n\u201cScandinavian Realism\u201d\u2014Hart famously attacked a\ncentral pillar of Ross\u2019 legal philosophy, namely his austerely\nnaturalistic analysis of the concept of legal validity. Ross (1962)\nresponded in his own review of Hart\u2019s The Concept of\nLaw, arguing that Hart had misunderstood him and that their\nviews, properly understood, were not so far apart.\n\nIn order to understand what it was that Ross proposed and that Hart\nfound so objectionable, it is best to begin with the opening pages of\nOn Law and Justice. There, Ross draws a distinction between\ntwo kinds of linguistic meaning: expressive and representative.\nAccording to Ross, all linguistic utterances, oral or written, have\nexpressive meaning (i.e., express something); but only some have\nrepresentative meaning, i.e., represent states of affairs in the\nworld. Here Ross contrasts an utterance like \u201cmy father is\ndead,\u201d which has expressive and representative meaning, with\nutterances like \u201couch!\u201d and \u201cshut the door,\u201d\nwhich have expressive meaning only. Ross calls utterances with\nrepresentative meaning \u201cassertions.\u201d Utterances without\nrepresentative meaning he calls either \u201cexclamations\u201d or\n\u201cdirectives\u201d\u2014the former if they are not intended to\nexert influence on others (as in the case of a reflexive cry of\n\u201couch!\u201d), the latter if they are intended to exert\ninfluence (as in the case of \u201cshut the door\u201d) (1959, pp.\n6\u20138).\n\nRoss holds that legal rules, such as statutory provisions, are\ndirectives. He explains that such rules are not meant to represent\nstates of affairs, but to influence behavior. Simply put, if a legal\nrule is laid down stating that certain behavior \u201cshall be\npunished\u201d or \u201cgives rise to liability,\u201d this is not\ndone to describe what courts would do anyway, but to direct\nthe behavior of courts (and, indirectly at least, the behavior of\nprivate individuals) (1959, pp. 8\u20139).\n\nWhat, then, of the legal utterances \u201coccurring in a textbook of\nlaw\u201d? Are these assertions or directives? At a surface level,\nRoss tells us, the language in such books will often be similar or\neven identical to the language in an actual statute: a doctrinal\nwriter might, for example, say that certain behavior \u201cgives rise\nto liability\u201d or \u201cshall be punished.\u201d But we should\nnot be misled by this surface similarity, Ross says: \u201cthe\npropositions in a textbook, at any rate to a certain extent, intend to\ndescribe, not to prescribe\u201d (1959, p. 9). To that extent,\ntherefore, they must be assertions, not directives\u2014specifically,\nRoss claims, assertions about what is valid law.\n\nAnd what does it mean to say that something is valid law? In effect,\nRoss tells us, it is to predict the behavior and thinking of courts.\nDetails aside, to say that \u201cX is valid law\u201d\nis in effect to say that (1) judges will act in accordance\nwith X, and (2) in so acting, they will feel themselves bound\nto do so. Hence, claims about what is valid law are claims about\npurely natural-factual states of affairs: facts about the behavior and\npsychology of judges (1959, pp. 42, 73\u201374, 75).\n\nThe Hart\u2013Ross dialogue revolved around the merits of this\nanalysis; Hart, for his part, found it altogether inadequate. Most\ncrucially and memorably, Hart argued that \u201ceven if in the mouth\nof the ordinary citizen or lawyer \u2018this is a valid rule of\nEnglish law\u2019 is a prediction of what [English] judge[s] will do,\nsay and/or feel, this cannot be its meaning in the mouth of a judge\nwho is not engaged in predicting his own or others\u2019 behaviour or\nfeelings.\u201d Instead, it is an \u201cact of recognition\u201d of\n\u201cthe rule in question as one satisfying certain accepted general\ncriteria for admission as a rule of the system and so as a legal\nstandard of behaviour\u201d (1959, p. 165). At root, Hart argued,\nRoss\u2019 analysis of the concept of legal validity fails because\n\u201cthe normal central use of \u2018legally valid\u2019 is in an\ninternal normative statement of a special kind\u201d (1959, p.\n167).\n\nLater, in his review of Hart\u2019s The Concept of Law, Ross\nclaimed that Hart had misunderstood him. In his analysis of\n\u201cvalid law,\u201d Ross replied, he had been concerned\nspecifically with \u201clegal concepts as they function in the\ndoctrinal study of law, what we on the Continent are accustomed to\ncall the science of law,\u201d and if this were adequately\nunderstood, it would be evident that much of the apparent disagreement\nbetween him and Hart was illusory (1962, p. 1190). In effect, Ross\nsaid, he had been analyzing legal statements of a kind Hart would have\nclassified as \u201cexternal.\u201d Ross chalked up the confusion at\nleast in part to the translation of the Danish phrase\n\u201cg\u00e6ldende ret\u201d as \u201cvalid law,\u201d\nacknowledging that the results sounded \u201codd in English\nusage,\u201d and suggesting in passing that \u201cexisting\nlaw\u201d or \u201claw in force\u201d might have better captured\nwhat he had in mind. (For further discussion of the translation\nquestion, see Eng 2011.)\n\nA number of subsequent authors who have revisited the Hart\u2013Ross\ndebate have expressed broad sympathy for Ross\u2019 claims to have\nbeen misunderstood. (See Pattaro 2009, pp. 545\u2013546; Eng 2011;\nHoltermann 2014, p. 166 n. 4.) Nonetheless, as a matter of\nintellectual history, Hart\u2019s critique had its effect. There has,\nhowever, been a recent uptick in interest in Scandinavian Legal\nRealism, perhaps owing in part to a broader renewal of interest in\nnaturalism in legal philosophy. This has not been limited to strictly\nhistorical or exegetical work, but has included efforts to mine the\nScandinavian Realists\u2019 writings for philosophical strategies or\ninsights that might help advance contemporary legal philosophy, or to\noffer fruitful rational reconstructions of their ideas. (See, e.g.,\nHoltermann 2014; Spaak 2014, Ch. 10.)\n\nOne topic of some contemporary interest to which the Scandinavian\nRealists may be relevant is the possibility of understanding legal\nlanguage in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist terms. Largely owing\nto Kevin Toh\u2019s work on the subject, there has been some recent\ninterest in legal (or \u201cmeta-legal\u201d) expressivism, that is,\ntreatments of legal statements as expressions of distinctive (perhaps\nconative) mental states. (See Toh 2005; Toh 2011; Etchemendy 2016.)\nContemporary legal expressivists might look to the Scandinavian\nRealists as intellectual forebears of a sort, given the prominence of\nnon-cognitivist ideas in their theories of legal language.\n\nAs is widely recognized, the Scandinavian Realists were ethical\nnon-cognitivists. (Bjarup 1999, p. 775; Ross 1959, p. 313; Spaak 2009,\npp. 42\u201344, 52\u201355, 64.) In principle, this would not\nrequire adopting expressivist or non-cognitivist accounts of legal\nstatements, but as it happens Ross and Olivecrona did understand\nsubstantial parts of legal discourse on this model. To be sure, Ross\nanalyzed statements about \u201cvalid law\u201d as assertions of\nnaturalistic fact, and thus cognitive. But, as discussed earlier, Ross\nthought some legal utterances were non-cognitive directives. This most\nobviously included legal rules themselves, as in the provisions of a\nstatute. But Ross also thought jurists\u2019 doctrinal writings were\ntypically a blend of cognitive assertions of valid law and\nnon-cognitive directives, the latter being in effect advice calculated\nto influence the behavior of the judiciary (1959, pp. 46\u201349). In\nadvancing this idea, Ross was not merely making the banal point that\ndoctrinal writing is frequently laced with transparently normative\nclaims about how courts should decide cases. His point was subtler\nthan this; telegraphically stated, Ross\u2019 observation was that\ndoctrinal writers sometimes do (and sometimes intend to) influence\njudges by making statements that could, on their face, equally be\ninterpreted as straightforward predictive/descriptive claims. It turns\nout, therefore, that Ross had a rather nuanced understanding of the\nmix of cognitive (or representational/descriptive) and non-cognitive\n(or directive/prescriptive) elements in legal discourse.\n\nIf anything, non-cognitivist ideas play an even more striking role in\nOlivecrona\u2019s mature legal philosophy, notably as set out in the\nSecond Edition of Law as Fact. Unsatisfied with efforts to\nreduce talk of legal rights to claims about naturalistic states of\naffairs, Olivecrona ultimately concludes that the word\n\u201cright,\u201d as commonly used, does not signify anything and\nlacks semantic reference (1971, pp. 183\u2013184). In the first\ninstance, he argues, statements about legal rights serve a directive\nfunction, though they can also indirectly serve to communicate\ninformation about actual (naturalistic) facts. Ultimately, Olivecrona\nextends this analysis to legal language in general, concluding:\n\u201cLegal language is not a descriptive language. It is a\ndirective, influential language serving as an instrument of social\ncontrol\u201d (1971, p. 253). Lest there be doubts about how far\nOlivecrona took this idea, he went on to observe that on his account,\n\u201cCitizen, government, parliament, law, right, duty, marriage,\nelections, taxes, corporations, and princess all belong to th[e]\ncategory\u201d of \u201cwords which\u2026lack semantic\nreference\u201d (1971, p. 255). Thus, Olivecrona found no place for\nmany of the \u201cthings\u201d legal language is ostensibly\n\u201cabout\u201d in the world of facts that he countenanced as an\nS-naturalist. As so often happens with philosophers who embrace\nnon-cognitivism about some domain of thought and talk, however,\nOlivecrona was equally insistent that legal language and\nideas do find a place in reality. He accordingly devoted\nconsiderable attention to describing the function of legal language in\nsociety\u2014concluding, ultimately, that \u201clegal language plays\na vital role\u201d as \u201can instrument of social control,\u201d\n\u201cfor keeping the peace, as well as for sending men to death on\nthe battlefield\u201d (1971, p. 254). Insofar as there is some\ncontemporary interest in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist accounts\nof legal thought and talk, therefore, Scandinavian Realism may offer\ninteresting intellectual-historical reference points (and possibly\nsubstantive inspiration) for the further development of such\nideas.\n5.2 Legal Positivism\n\nAt least in contemporary Anglo-American legal philosophy, \u201cLegal\nPositivism\u201d is generally used as a shorthand for a claim roughly\nalong the following lines: \u201cthe existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts and not on its merits\u201d (Green 2009).\nWhat is the relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism in\nthe above-specified sense? The situation is somewhat complex because\nsome but not all Legal Positivists are naturalists, and few have gone\nso far as the Scandinavian Realists in wearing their naturalism on\ntheir sleeves. In brief, however, naturalism can and sometimes\nhas\u2014but need not\u2014play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism.\n\nHow is it that naturalism can play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism? As has often been remarked, the core Positivist claim\nabout the relationship between law and social facts amounts in effect\nto a claim that law is reducible to social facts, which\u2014given\nthat \u201csocial facts\u201d here is, tacitly if not expressly,\nlimited to psychological and sociological facts\u2014further amounts\nto the claim that law is reducible to naturalistic facts. It should be\nclear enough why this would be appealing to people with S-naturalist\ncommitments, for it would, so to speak, mean that we can\n\u201cplace\u201d law in the realm of naturalistic facts and\nentities. (By analogy, consider why S-naturalists would be drawn to\nthe idea that the existence and contents of human minds\ndepends solely on facts about human brains.) Unsurprisingly,\ntherefore, the affinities between Legal Positivism and S-naturalism\nhave not gone unnoticed. (See Kar 2006, p. 931; Leiter 2018, pp.\n19\u201320.)\n\nIt is, however, somewhat harder to discern the actual extent to which\nS-naturalism has been a motivation for major philosophers in the Legal\nPositivist tradition. There is at least a good case to be made that\nHart was sufficiently attracted to S-naturalism to consider it an\nadvantage of Legal Positivism that it placed law in the world of\nearthly facts. (See Hart 1961, pp. 11\u201312, 83\u201384, 186; Raz\n1998, pp. 4\u20135; Toh 2005, pp. 83\u201385.) Even so, Legal\nPositivism need not be, and is not always, motivated by S-naturalism,\nor for that matter any kind of naturalism, and not all Legal\nPositivists are naturalists in any interesting sense. For example, Raz\ndoes not appear to be a naturalist of any sort. (See Raz 1988, p. 6.)\nThe broader point, of course, is that one need not be a naturalist to\nthink that some particular phenomenon (e.g., law) depends\nsolely on naturalistic facts.\n\nThus, it pays not to overstate, or to make overgeneralizations about,\nthe relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism. We can,\nhowever, confidently say that Legal Positivism sits well with a\nbackground commitment to S-naturalism. This point is of no small\nimportance given the continuing influence of S-naturalism (or at least\ntemperamental affinities to S-naturalism) in the general background\nframework of post-Enlightenment culture and thought. (See Leiter 2018,\np. 19.)\n5.3 S-Naturalism, Law, and the Causal Theory of Reference\n\nJust as semantic doctrines more-or-less related to logical positivism\nwere central to the S-naturalism of Scandinavian Realism, the more\nrecent S-naturalism of writers like David Brink, Michael Moore, and\nNicos Stavropoulos is indebted to the revolution in semantics\ninitiated by Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke known as the\n\u201cnew\u201d or \u201ccausal\u201d theory of reference. These\nlatter doctrines are not\u2014yet in any case\u2014museum pieces, so\nthe derived jurisprudential theses are very much live items of debate.\nStavropoulos explains the core semantic ideas on which jurisprudential\nwriters draw as follows:\n\nBoth Kripke and Putnam attack what they call the traditional theory of\nreference. That theory holds that an expression refers to whatever\nfits the description with which speakers associate the expression. The\nrelevant description\u2026captures necessary properties of the\nreferent which are knowable a priori, as in the case of\nknowing that a bachelor is an unmarried man. This cannot be true,\nKripke and Putnam argue, since expressions refer to the same object in\nthe lips of speakers who can only associate the expression with vague\nor mistaken descriptions. Indeed, not only individual speakers but the\ncommunity as a whole can be in error about the true properties of the\nrelevant object. \u2026 The important suggestion being made by\nKripke and Putnam is that reference is object-dependent.\nWhich object \u2018Aristotle\u2019 or \u2018water\u2019\nrefers to is not determined by the associated description, but turns\ninstead on a matter of fact, namely which object the name-using or\nterm-using practice is directed at. (1996, p. 8)\n\n\nThus, if on the old view the \u201cmeaning\u201d of an expression\n(the descriptions speakers associated with it) fixed the reference of\nthe expression, on the new theory, the referent fixes the meaning.\n\u201cWater\u201d picks out whatever stuff we happened to baptize\nwith the name \u201cwater\u201d at the beginning of the\n\u201cterm-using practice.\u201d As it happens, that stuff has a\ndistinctive micro-constitution: it is H20. Thus,\n\u201cwater\u201d refers to stuff that is H20, and that\nis what the term means: the stuff that is H20.\n\nWriters like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos propose that when the\nmeaning of expressions in legal rules\u2014and, in particular, the\nmeaning of the moral concepts (like \u201cequality\u201d) that\nfigure in some legal rules\u2014is understood in the same way, then\nit follows that all rules have determinate applications:\neither the facts do or do not fall within the extension of the meaning\nof the key terms in the rule. The meaning of the rule determines its\napplication, but the meaning is fixed by the real referents\nof the terms in the legal rule. Of course, for this to be a version of\nS-naturalism, the claim must be that the real referents are themselves\nthings cognizable within a naturalistic framework. So, e.g., it\nwould have to be the case that the legal and moral features of\nsituations picked out by our legal concepts (and the moral concepts\nembedded in them) must be identical with (or supervenient upon)\nnatural facts: just as there are necessary, a posteriori\nstatements of property identity about water, so too there are such\nstatements about legal and moral facts. For example, perhaps the\nproperty of being \u201cmorally right\u201d is just identical with\nthe property of \u201cmaximizing human well-being,\u201d where the\nlatter may be understood in purely psychological and physiological\nterms. In that case, whether an action X is morally right is\nsimply a scientific question about whether action X will in\nfact maximize the relevant kinds of psychological and physiological\nstates in the world. (Most naturalistic moral realisms are based on\nversions of utilitarianism, precisely because it is easy to see what\nthe naturalistic base of moral properties would be in a utilitarian\nschema. One peculiar feature of the moral realism of Moore (1992b) is\nthat it is conjoined with a deontological moral theory, yet within a\npurportedly naturalistic moral realist framework.) The crucial claim,\nplainly, is that moral facts are to be identified with (or treated as\nsupervenient upon) certain kinds of natural facts. Of course, many\nphilosophers are skeptical that this claim can be made out.\n\nProblems arise at several different levels with this more recent\nS-naturalism, though all are traceable to the reliance on the new\ntheory of reference. To begin, there are familiar reasons to be\nskeptical about whether the new theory of reference is correct,\nreasons that won\u2019t be rehearsed here (see, e.g., Evans 1973,\nBlackburn 1988). Even granting, however, the correctness of the new\ntheory, it is not obvious how it helps in the case of law. After all,\nthe new theory always seemed most plausible for a limited class of\nexpressions: proper names and natural kind terms. The reason has to do\nwith the implicit essentialism required for the new theory: unless\nreferents have essential characteristics\u2014just as\n\u201cwater\u201d has a distinctive and essential molecular\nconstitution\u2014they cannot fix meanings. But what is the essence\nof \u201cdue process\u201d or \u201cequal protection?\u201d And\nwhat is the \u201cessential\u201d nature of the many artifact terms\nthat populate legal rules (terms like \u201ccontract\u201d or\n\u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201csecurity interest\u201d)?\nUnsurprisingly, S-naturalists like Brink and Moore are also moral\nrealists, and also try to give accounts of artifact terms as picking\nout not \u201cnatural kinds\u201d but \u201cfunctional kinds\u201d\n(Moore 1992a, pp. 207\u2013208).\n\nOf course, even if the new theory of reference gives the correct\naccount of the meaning of some terms (like natural kind terms), that\nstill does not show that it gives us the right account of meaning for\npurposes of legal interpretation (cf. Munzer 1985). Suppose the\nlegislature prohibits the killing of \u201cfish\u201d within 100\nmiles of the coast, intending quite clearly (as the legislative\nhistory reveals) to protect whales, but not realizing that\n\u201cfish\u201d is a natural kind term that does not include whales\nwithin its extension. The new theory of reference tells us that the\nstatute protects sea bass but not whales, yet surely a court that\ninterpreted the statute as also protecting whales would not be making\na mistake. Indeed, one might think the reverse is true: for a court\nnot to protect whales would be to contravene the will of the\nlegislature, and thus, indirectly, the will of the people. What the\nexample suggests is that the correct theory of legal interpretation is\nnot a mere matter of philosophical semantics: issues about\npolitical legitimacy\u2014about the conditions under which\nthe exercise of coercive power by courts can be justified\u2014must\ninform theories of legal interpretation, and such considerations may\neven trump considerations of semantics.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, Ronald J. and Brian Leiter (2001). \u201cNaturalized\nEpistemology and the Law of Evidence,\u201d <em>Virginia Law\nReview</em>, 87: 1491\u20131550.", "Bix, Brian (ed.)
