    "main_text": "The World and Rational Cosmology || The Dynamical Antinomies\n4.2 The Dynamical Antinomies\n\nIn the dynamical antinomies, Kant changes his strategy somewhat.\nRather than arguing (as in the mathematical antinomies) that both\nconclusions are false, Kant suggests that both sides to the\ndispute might turn out to be correct. This option is available here,\nand not in the two mathematical antinomies, because the proponents of\nthe thesis arguments are not committing themselves solely to claims\nabout spatio-temporal objects. In the third antinomy, the thesis\ncontends that in addition to mechanistic causality, we must posit some\nfirst uncaused causal power (Transcendental Freedom), while the\nantithesis denies anything but mechanistic causality. Here, then, the\ndebate is the standard (though in this case, the specifically\ncosmological) dispute between freedom and determinism. Finally, in the\nfourth antinomy, the requirement for a necessary being is pitted\nagainst its opposite. The thesis position argues for a necessary\nbeing, whereas the antithesis denies that there is any such being.\n\nIn both cases the thesis opts for a position that is abstracted from\nthe spatio-temporal framework, and thus adopts the broadly Platonic\nview. The postulation of freedom amounts to the postulation of a\nnon-temporal cause, a causality outside the series of appearances in\nspace and time (A451/B479). Similarly, in its efforts to argue for a\n\u201cnecessary being,\u201d reason is forced (against its own\nargument) into a non-sensible realm. If there is a necessary being, it\nwill have to be \u201coutside\u201d the series of appearances:\n\u201cEither, therefore, reason through its demand for the\nunconditioned must remain in conflict with itself, or this\nunconditioned must be posited outside the series, in the\nintelligible\u201d (A564/B592). The rational necessity of postulating\nsuch a necessary being or a causality of freedom satisfies the\nrational demand for intelligible explanation. Against this, the\nantithesis rightly notes that the conception of transcendental\nfreedom, or a necessary being, again represents an attempt to abstract\nfrom \u201cnature\u2019s own resources\u201d\n(A451\u20132/B479\u201380). Insofar as the antithesis denies the\njustification for doing this, of course, it is said to adopt a broadly\nEpicurean standpoint. The problem here, however, is that in refusing\nto move beyond \u201cnature\u2019s own resources,\u201d the\nantithesis surreptitiously smuggles in spatio-temporal conditions as\nthe basis for a universal ontological claim that nevertheless\ntranscends all experience. If space and time were things in\nthemselves, then of course the application of the demand for this\nunconditioned would be warranted. Kant\u2019s view, however, is that\nspace and time are not conditions of things in themselves.\n\nThe resolution to these antinomies here consists in giving each side\nits due, but simultaneously limiting the domain over which the claims\nhold. The thesis demand for an absolute causal beginning or a\nnecessary being might well be allowed to stand, but certainly not as\n\u201cpart of\u201d or as an explication of appearances in nature.\nSimilarly, the antithesis conclusions can stand, but only in relation\nto objects in nature, considered as appearances. Here, the conflict\nseems irresolvable only on the assumption that appearances are things\nin themselves. If appearances were things in themselves, for example,\nthen it would certainly seem true that either they are one and all\nsubject to mechanistic causality, or not. In such a case, it makes\nsense both to argue for a non-temporal beginning and to deny such a\nbeginning. Left unresolved, then, this antinomy leaves us wit the\nfollowing dilemma: on the assumption of transcendental realism, both\nnature and freedom seem to be undermined. To avoid this, Kant appeals\nto transcendental idealism, which is supposed to rescue reason from\nthe conflict. Given transcendental idealism (with its distinction\nbetween appearances and things in themselves) it remains possible that\nin addition to the mechanism of nature, or contingent existence, there\nis an intelligible causal power, or a necessary being.\n\nDetailed discussions of Kant\u2019s antinomies can be found in Al-Azm\n(1972), Bennett, (1974), Grier (2001, 2006, forthcoming), Guyer (1987),\nHeimsoeth (1967), Strawson (1966), Thiel (2006), Watkins (1998, 2000),\nVan Cleve (1984).
