    "main_text": "\n\nThe \u201cethics of belief\u201d refers to a cluster of questions at\nthe intersection of epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, and\npsychology.\n\nThe central question in the debate is whether there are norms of some\nsort governing our habits of belief-formation, belief-maintenance, and\nbelief-relinquishment. Is it ever or always morally wrong (or\nepistemically irrational, or practically imprudent)\nto hold a belief on insufficient evidence? Is it ever or always\nmorally right (or epistemically rational, or\npractically prudent) to believe on the basis of sufficient\nevidence, or to withhold belief in the perceived absence of it? Is it\never or always obligatory to seek out all available epistemic evidence\nfor a belief? Are there some ways of obtaining evidence that are\nthemselves immoral, irrational, imprudent?\n\nRelated questions have to do with the nature and structure of the\nnorms involved, if any, as well as the source of their authority. Are\nthey instrumental norms grounded in contingent ends that we set for\nourselves? Are they categorical norms grounded in ends set for us by\nthe very nature of our intellectual or moral capacities? Are there\nother options? And what are the objects of evaluation in this\ncontext\u2014believers, beliefs, or both?\n\nFinally, assuming that there are norms of some sort governing\nbelief-formation, what does that imply about the nature of belief?\nDoes it imply that belief-formation is voluntary or under our control?\nIf so, what sort of control is this? If not, then is talk of an\nethics of belief even coherent?\n",
