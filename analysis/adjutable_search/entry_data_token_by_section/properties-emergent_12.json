    "main_text": "Weak vs. Strong Emergence: Contested Phenomena || The conscious mind\n5.1 The conscious mind\n\nThe conscious mind in its different aspects has long seemed to many to\nresist plausible ontological characterization in any physical terms,\nwhether reductive or non-reductive (i.e., weak emergentist). (For a\nfairly comprehensive overview, see Chalmers 1996.)\n5.1.1 Conscious awareness and its unity\n\nConsider, for a start, our apparently direct awareness of our\nown conscious experiential states. (Conscious cognitive states such as\nbeliefs and desires have complicating aspects that cannot be explored\nhere. But see\n section 5.1.2\n immediately below for a possible linkage between the two germane to\nstrong emergentist conjecture.) The natural physicalist strategy for\ncharacterizing such awareness would be in terms of a distinctive form\nof informational flow among distinct physical states (the experiential\nstate itself and a distinct state of awareness of the experience); yet\nany such account would seem consistent with the possibility\nof a nonstandard causal source of the state of awareness of the\nconscious state, such that the subject is utterly mistaken about its\nobject, the subject\u2019s current conscious state. Such strong\nfallibilism about the contents of consciousness seems implausible, as\nis shown by the fact that philosophers such as Descartes who entertain\nradical skeptical doubts about much of human knowledge do not\ntypically extend it to our grasp of our current conscious experience.\nIs it, for example, conceivable that I am only seemingly (but\nmistakenly) aware of undergoing excruciating pain as of being laid out\non the torturer\u2019s rack, while in fact I am in a serene conscious\nstate as of lying on a warm sandy beach? It seems not, but it is hard\nto account for this datum in physicalist terms.\n\nAlso puzzling for physicalism is the unity of conscious\nexperience: the fact that our experiences engaging distinct sensory\nmodalities and our conscious thoughts, moods, and feelings come\ntogether as aspects of one overall conscious state of a single\nconscious subject. On a plausible physicalist account, each of these\naspects will be realized in distinct, physically-separated neural\nnetworks, but as yet there is no worked-out physicalist strategy for\ncapturing the unity of these aspects in experience.\n\nIn recent decades, highly general functional characterizations of\nconscious awareness have been proposed, notably: higher-order\ntheories, on which a state is conscious just in case it stands in the\nright kind of relationship to a higher-order state that represents it\n(Carruthers 2000; Rosenthal 2005;\n entry on higher-order theories of consciousness);\n global workspace theories, on which a state is conscious just in case\nits content is globally accessible to multiple cognitive subsystems\n(Baars 1997, Dehaene et al. 2006); and integrated information theory\n(Tononi & Koch 2015), on which a system is conscious just in case\nit carries more information than the sum of its parts (and is more\nconscious the greater the amount of such \u201cintegrated\u201d\ninformation). Anti-physicalists have argued that the first of these\ntheories implicitly denies or fails to adequately capture the two\nfeatures of direct awareness and unity; the second and third are\nhighly suggestive frameworks for theorizing about dynamical aspects of\nconsciousness, but insofar as they are developed in purely neural\nterms, they seem to provide only a weaker surrogate for what we\nintrospectively grasp concerning the unity of consciousness, and\ndon\u2019t speak clearly to the direct awareness relation.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that these features, while present in\nstandard conscious experience, are arguably absent or diminished in\nunusual clinical cases, and in particular in \u201csplit-brain\u201d\npatients. (See Bayne 2008 and Schechter 2018 for philosophical\nexploration of clinical accounts regarding the reports of split-brain\npatients.) This suggests a physicalist strategy of using these unusual\nphenomena as a tool for chipping away at the ostensible\nphenomenological basis for rejecting the possibility of an eventual\nphysicalist account of consciousness. (See\n entry on the unity of consciousness,\n Sect. 4 for a survey of such disorders of unified consciousness and\ndiscussions of their possible implications.) An alternative, perhaps\ncomplementary physicalist strategy is to argue that certain seeming\naspects of consciousness are simply illusions which can be\nexplained in terms of inevitable organizational tradeoffs in the\nconstruction of finite minds (see Pereboom 2011 and Chalmers\n2018).\n5.1.2 The qualitative and intentional character of mental states\n\nEven more than the nature and unity of conscious awareness, certain\nseeming intrinsic characteristics\u2014so-called\n\u201cqualia\u201d\u2014of conscious states have seemed to many to\nrequire an anti-physicalist ontological account. The way a patch of\nredness appears in one\u2019s visual field, or the sound of a trumpet\nnote in one\u2019s auditory field, do not seem to admit of\ncharacterization in terms of neural processes within the visual and\nauditory cortex. Rather, such experiential qualities seem to be\ndistinctive in kind, engendering a mismatch with the\nphysical-structural or functional kinds posited by physical theories,\nand to have a degree of simplicity that is incongruent with the\nmassive physical complexity of the associated physical processes. (For\ntwo much-discussed arguments from these apparent characteristics of\nconscious experience to at least a modest form of physical-mental\ndualism, see Jackson 1982 and\n entry on qualia and the knowledge argument;\n and Chalmers 1996 and\n entry on zombies.)\n\nSome accept this claim regarding these \u201cphenomenal\u201d\nqualities of conscious experience, but think that there is no\ncorresponding deep challenge to physicalism with regards to the\nintentional properties of experiences, representing what the\nworld around us is like (again, Jackson 1982 and Chalmers 1996). (This\nlimited anti-physicalism most lends itself to\u2014although it does\nnot entail\u2014the epiphenomenalist version of strong emergence\ndiscussed in\n 4.2.1\n above, as it is consistent with the claim that information-processing\nintentional states are the only mental states that causally contribute\nto the individual\u2019s future mental and physical states.) However,\none may question the independence of phenomenal and intentional\nproperties (see, e.g., Horgan & Tienson 2002), and some go so far\nas to conjecture that intentional properties are in some way\nconstituted by phenomenal properties (Mendelovici 2018, Woodward\n2019). If some such connection thesis is correct, then not only\nexperiences, but other cognitive states such as belief and desire may\nresist purely physical characterization (see\n entry on phenomenal intentionality).\n5.1.3 Conscious will & agency\n\nHuman and other animals are not only experiencers and knowers but also\ndoers. (The nature of non-human animal choice or volition and their\nconcomitant experience of action is here set aside, as it is difficult\nto conjecture concerning it with any confidence on present knowledge.)\nMany take Aristotle to have expressed a truism when he said that the\nchoice of how to act is \u201cup to us\u201d, unlike the inevitable\nunfolding of causal processes lacking in rationality or other sources\nof deliberative choice. It is widely claimed that the human experience\nof conscious, deliberate choice (\u201cwilling\u201d) is of direct,\n\u201ctop down\u201d control over one\u2019s action by the agent\n(see, e.g., O\u2019Connor 2000: Ch.1&4; for an overview of\ndiscussions regarding agential experience, see Bayne 2017 and Woodward\nforthcoming). At least sometimes, we seem to ourselves not to be\nmerely loci in which a host of psychological and merely physical\ninfluences converge and resolve themselves in behavior, but rather to\nexercise a power to decide which among the options we are considering\nwe shall take, thereby determining whether and how these influences\nwill be acted upon.\n\nSuch agential experience, if veridical, might indicate that the\nability to freely choose is strongly emergent. On one account, free\nchoice manifests a distinctive power that, unlike typical powers, is\nneither causally \u201ctriggered\u201d by a stimulus condition nor\nis made more or less probable by antecedent factors (Lowe 2008, 2013).\nAlternatively, the kind of power agential experience represents is\nconsistent with non-determining causal influences that collectively\nconfer objective probabilities on possible choices (O\u2019Connor\n2008). On either understanding, conscious control over one\u2019s own\nactions through exercising the power of choice is at odds with a\nphysicalist conception on which all systemic behavior is fixed by the\narrangement and activity of the system\u2019s parts. Coupled with the\nplausible position that mental states of whatever variety depend on\nlower-level physical states, such a result might be seen as providing\nsupport for taking free will to be a strongly emergent power.\n\nAgential experience is defeasible, and cognitive and social psychology\nand more recently neuroscience have been probing the determinants of\nchoice and its relationship to conscious awareness. One particular\nform of study has been taken by many to undermine the veridicality of\nthe experience of conscious control over arbitrary choice. Libet 1999\nand more sophisticated successor studies aim to compare the\nself-reported time of occurrence of conscious choice with the time of\noccurrence of certain brain activity (a steadily increasing\n\u201creadiness potential\u201d) that Libet took to be associated\nwith the production of the subsequent action. He interpreted the\nresults as indicating that the behavior was unconsciously initiated by\nthat brain activity just prior to the time of the\nsubject\u2019s awareness of having so chosen, and hence that the\nagent\u2019s sense that she consciously initiated the action is\nillusory.\n\nPhilosophers have roundly criticized the \u201cno free will\u201d\ninterpretation of these studies offered by Libet and some other\nneuroscientists (see Mele 2009 for a thorough discussion and Caruso 2012: 189ff, for a dissent from the\nconsensus). Many have emphasized that the \u201cchoices\u201d\nLibet\u2019s subjects are asked to make depart from paradigmatically\nfree cases in important ways. Some note that the ability of subjects\nto precisely time their own conscious events of any kind (including\nsimple perceptual cues) have been shown to be not fully reliable:\ntheir estimates can be manipulated by conscious primes before and\nafter the target event. (They also come in degrees of intensity, such\nthat the onset of an event that might quickly intensify or otherwise\nevolve might be more difficult to determine than the event itself.)\nOthers observe that the studies do not even purport to identify a\ndetermining physical antecedent to conscious choice. Finally,\nother recent studies (beginning with Schurger et al. 2012) have called\ninto question just what kind of neural activity Libet-style studies\nare tracking, and in particular whether it is even involved in the\nproduction of choice and subsequent behavior. All this remains a\nsubject of continued scientific study and debate. (A large-scale\nproject is currently underway that is developing a wide array of\nexperimental probes of conscious will and its physical determinants:\n< https://neurophil-freewill.org/> For an overview of\nphilosophical and empirical issues concerning human free will, see\n entry on free will.)\n5.2 Physical Science\n5.2.1 Quantum Entanglement\n\nA striking feature of quantum mechanics is known as \u201cquantum\nentanglement\u201d. When two (or more) quantum particles or systems\ninteract in certain ways and are then (even space-like) separated,\ntheir measurable features (e.g., position and momentum) will correlate\nin ways that cannot be accounted for in terms of \u201cpure\u201d\nquantum states of each particle or system separately. In other words,\nthe two need to be thought of as a coupled system, having certain\nfeatures which are in no sense a compositional or other resultant of\nindividual states of the system\u2019s components (see Silberstein\n& McGeever 1999 and entries on\n holism and nonseparability in physics\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n Humphreys (2016) construes this as an instance of emergent fusion\n (section 4.2.4).\n Insofar as these features have physical effects, they indicate a\nnear-ubiquitous failure of whole-part property supervenience at a very\nsmall scale. However, it should be observed that quantum entanglement\ndoes not manifest a fundamental novelty in feature or associated\ncausal power, as it concerns only the value or magnitude of a\nfeature/associated power had by its components. (Correlated\n\u201cspin\u201d values, e.g., are permutations on the fundamental\nfeature of spin, rather than being akin to mass or charge as wholly\ndistinctive features.) As such, it does not fit the criteria of many\naccounts of strongly emergence. It is, however, relevant to the\nepistemic status of such accounts: if one thinks that the existence of\nstrong emergence is implausible on grounds that a kind of strong local\nsupervenience is a priori very plausible for composed systems\ngenerally, then the surprising phenomenon of quantum entanglement\nshould lead you to be more circumspect in your assumptions regarding\nhow complex systems are put together.\n5.2.2 Quantum Chemistry\n\nThe interface of physics with chemistry has long been thought to\nsupport ontological reductionism (or physicalism, more generally).\nThis sentiment goes back to an early declaration by Paul Dirac, one of\nthe founding figures of quantum mechanics:\n\n\nThe underlying laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a larger\npart of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known,\nand the difficulty is only that exact applications of these laws lead\nto equations much too complicated to be soluble. (1929: 714)\n\n\nIn recent decades, there has recently been reconsideration of this\nperspective. Hendry (1998, 2010, 2017, 2019), following Woolley (1978,\n1998) and Primas (1981), contends, to the contrary, that molecular\nstructure is (or may well be) strongly emergent, in failing to be\nwholly determined by the arrangements of a molecule\u2019s quantum\nconstituents; isomers, which have distinct molecular structure yet the\nsame subatomic constituents, are a particular focus in these\ndiscussions. Scerri (2012) criticizes this line of thought, suggesting\nthat it overlooks the possibility that a molecule\u2019s\nquantum-mechanical interaction with its environment may contribute to\nfixing its overall structure. It should be noted that the details of\nScerri\u2019s counter-proposal depend on a particular\n(collapse-based) interpretation of quantum mechanics. There has been a\nsteady uptick of discussion of this issue among philosophers of\nchemistry, and it appears to be unresolved at present. This in turn\nsuggests that, contra Dirac, strong emergence even at the interface of\nphysics and chemistry remains a live possibility. (For further\ndiscussion, see Hettema (2015) and entry on\n philosophy of chemistry,\n Section 6.)\n5.2.3 Spacetime\n\nFundamental physics encompasses two successful theories, General\nRelativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), that are mutually\ninconsistent. In recent years, a number of Quantum Gravity theories\nhave been put forward as candidate deeper theories that can account\nfor core dynamical principles and successful predictions of both\ntheories within one consistent framework. Strikingly, in almost all\nsuch theories, spacetime is not part of the fundamental ontology, it\nbeing supplanted by a framework that lacks at least some of its\nstructure. Many theorists say that the spacetime of GR is thereby\nrendered emergent. Its dependence is reflected in how the many roles\nthat spacetime plays in GR and the spatiotemporally structured\nexperimental observations themselves (and indeed, ubiquitous\nperceptions of everyday life!) are grounded in nonspatiotemporal\nstructures in the proposed fundamental theories. Its autonomy takes\nthe form of nonfundamental spacetime\u2019s being qualitatively\ndifferent from any feature of the fundamental theory.\n\nThe issues raised by such radical proposals are complex, and it is\neven debated whether they are empirically coherent, given the role\nthat space and time play in our understanding of physical causation\nand empirical observation, and hence of empirical evidence itself. For\npresent purposes, the key point is that such theories propose\nsystematic theoretical reductions, akin to the reduction of\nthermodynamics to statistical mechanics, with a concommitant\nontological reduction of the structures of the reduced theories. In\nthis, the case appears unlike the relationship between physics and\nbiology as weak emergentists see it, in which biological entities\nappear to be special kinds of organized physical structures that\nexplain equally distinctive phenomena that are unexplained by more\nfundamental theories. For a non-technical introduction to some of the\ntheories at issue and the case for describing them as entailing\nspacetime emergence, see W\u00fcthrich (2019). For more general\nphilosophical reflection on our ordinary concepts of space and time\nand their compatibility with theories that treat them as\nnonfundamental, see Chalmers (forthcoming).\n5.3 Pluralist interpretations of the general ontology of the sciences\n\nChampions of physicalism see the marked successes of the physical and\nbiological sciences in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as\nestablishing, at a minimum, that the characteristic processes at all\nlevels of these domains are fixed by fundamental physical states and\nprocesses. However, some draw a different conclusion from these\nadvances, seeing new bases for strongly emergentist perspectives.\n\nMany sciences treating complex systems of one or other variety have\nundergone extensive and impressive development in the last fifty\nyears. Theorists in these disciplines freely use terms such as\n\u201cemergence\u201d and \u201ctop-down causation\u201d to\ndescribe the phenomena they study. It is often unclear, however,\nwhether they are best interpreted as describing weakly or strongly\nemergent states and associated behavior. Among those who have\nreflected recently on the state of their discipline, solid state\nphysicist Laughlin (2005), systems biologists Noble (2006) and Boogerd\n(Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007), and neuroscientist Walter Freeman (1999,\n2000) and cosmologist Ellis (2016) appear to advocate\nstrongly emergentist accounts of aspects of solid state\nphysics, biological life, and the human mind, respectively. They argue\nthat the pertinent sciences encompassing these domains give equal,\ncomplementary places to \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop\ndown\u201d determinants and principles, and argue that we cannot\nunderstand the latter as themselves ultimately fixed by instances of\nthe former. The general thrust of their detailed arguments is that\nthere is no fully \u201cbottom up\u201d way to describe, let alone\nexplain, certain organized phenomena. See also Ellis, Noble, and\nO\u2019Connor (2012) for a collection of state-of-the-art overviews\nof the interaction of top-down and bottom-up principles in numerous\nscientific domains, from fundamental physics to sociology.\n\nFinally, philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1983, 1994, 1999) has defended\nover several decades a thorough-going \u201cpatchwork\u201d or\npluralistic understanding of the relation between the sciences, as an\nalternative to the sort of \u201cphysics-at-the-bottom\u201d,\nasymmetrical hierarchy common to weak emergentists and reductionists\nalike. She argues that close consideration of scientific practice\nsuggests that fundamental physical laws hold only in certain\nartificial contexts limited to small-scale systems, which systems are\nmaintained by macroscopic barriers and mechanisms serving to screen\noff \u201cdownward\u201d causal effects. She suggests that such\ncarefully contrived results can give us no reasonable confidence in a\nvision on which all of natural reality is fixed by the unfolding of\nbottom-up physical laws alone. While arguing in somewhat different\nways, Dupr\u00e9 (1993) is sympathetic to the general pluralist or\n\u201canti-fundamentalist\u201d thrust of Cartwright\u2019s\nperspective. More generally, if anything like Cartwright\u2019s view\nis correct, and the right ontological characterization of the\nunderlying pluralism is one according to which there is fundamental\nnovelty across the spectrum of natural reality, one might naturally\ntake strong emergence to be much more prevalent than even its\nproponents have usually assumed. This perspective has affinities to\nthe \u201ctransformational\u201d accounts of emergence noted in\n section 4.2.4.\n For discussion of the broad issues raised by Cartwright, see Cat\n(1998) and entry on\n the unity of science,\n Section 5.",
