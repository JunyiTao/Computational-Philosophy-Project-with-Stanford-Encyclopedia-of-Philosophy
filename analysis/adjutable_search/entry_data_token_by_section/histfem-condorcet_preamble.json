    "main_text": "\n\nMarie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (September\n17, 1743\u2013March 28, 1794) is most often referred to as one of the\nlast philosophes or as an early champion of social\n science.[1]\n An inspired proponent of human rights, Condorcet moved from his first\nachievements in mathematics into public service, with the aim of\napplying to social and political affairs a scientific model that he\ntermed a \u201csocial arithmetic\u201d. Through educational and\nconstitutional reforms, he hoped to create a liberal, rational and\ndemocratic polity. He advocated for the social utility of statistics\nand probability theory, and he applied mathematical calculations to\nfiscal crises, the reform of hospital care, jury decision-making and\nvoting procedures. He is best remembered as the author of the\nposthumously published final work Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique\nde l\u2019esprit humain [Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Human\nMind] (1794), in which he diagnosed the stages of human progress,\nincluding what was yet to come. However, far less well known is\nCondorcet\u2019s extraordinary advocacy of the rights of\n women.[2]\n In this regard, he was exceptional even for an enlightened\n thinker.[3]\n\nWhat Condorcet termed, in a 1790 essay by that name, \u201cthe\nadmission of women to the rights of citizenship\u201d was widely\nopposed on the grounds that women possessed distinctive natures, which\nperfectly suited them to the fulfillment of their domestic\n duties.[4]\n Women were deemed unqualified for the realm of public affairs because\nof their alleged greater susceptibility to sensations, flawed\nrationality, and weaker sense of justice. Women did not get the vote\nduring the French Revolution, but they did benefit from many of the\nchanges that occurred in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance,\nand the legal status of unwed mothers and their children. However,\nthey ultimately suffered setbacks as many of these reforms were\nwithdrawn or curtailed during Napoleon\u2019s reign. (On the revolutionary\nrecord, see Traer 1980; Landes 1988, 1996; Fraisse 1994; Hunt\n1992; Hufton 1999; Scott 1996; Verjus 2002; Desan 2004; Heuer\n2005; Beckstrand 2009.) A further consequence of the Revolution is\nthat, for the first time, sex was introduced as a constitutional\ncondition for the possession of political rights, even as rights were\nproclaimed to be universal and inalienable. In contrast to such\nhypocrisy, Condorcet affirmed woman\u2019s equal humanity on the grounds of\nreason and justice. While never entirely dismissing the influential\ncase for women\u2019s difference, Condorcet refused to accept this as an\nimpediment to their equal enjoyment of civil and political rights. He\nattributed women\u2019s limitations, to the extent they existed, not to\ntheir sex but rather to their inferior education and circumstances.\nAppreciating the risks he faced in rebutting one of the age\u2019s most\ndeeply held prejudices, he begged for the opportunity to engage in\nreasoned dialogue with his opponents:\n\n\nI hope that anyone who attacks my arguments will do so without using\nridicule or declamation, and above all, that someone will show me a\nnatural difference between men and women on which the exclusion could\nlegitimately be based. (Condorcet 1790, in McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n338\u2013339)\n\n",
