    "main_text": "Conception of Knowledge || Methodist Approach\n1.3 Methodist Approach\n\nHow are would-be knowers to proceed in identifying candidates\nfor perfect knowledge? Distinguish particularist and\nmethodist answers to the question. The particularist\nis apt to trust our prima facie intuitions regarding particular \nknowledge claims. These intuitions may then be used to help\nidentify more general epistemic principles. The methodist, by\ncontrast, is apt to distrust our prima facie intuitions. The\npreference is instead to begin with general principles about\nproper method. These methodical principles may then be used to\narrive at settled, reflective judgments concerning particular\nknowledge claims.\n\nFamously, Descartes is in the methodist camp. Those who haphazardly\n\u201cdirect their minds down untrodden paths\u201d are sometimes\n\u201clucky enough in their wanderings to hit upon some truth,\u201d\nbut \u201cit is far better,\u201d writes Descartes, \u201cnever to\ncontemplate investigating the truth about any matter than to do so\nwithout a method\u201d (Rules 4, AT 10:371, CSM 1:15f). Were\nwe to rely on our prima facie intuitions, we might accept that the\nearth is unmoved, or that ordinary objects (as tables and chairs)\nare just as they appear. Yet, newly emerging\nmechanist doctrines of the 17th century imply otherwise. Descartes\nthinks such cases underscore the unreliability of our prima facie\nintuitions and the need for a method by which to make epistemic\nprogress.\n\nDescartes\u2019 view is not that all our pre-reflective\nintuitions are mistaken. He concedes that \u201cno sane person has\never seriously doubted\u201d such particular claims as \u201cthat\nthere really is a world, and that human beings have bodies\u201d\n(Synopsis, AT 7:16, CSM 2:11). But such pre-reflective judgments may\nbe ill-grounded, even when true.\n\nThe dialectic of the First Meditation features a confrontation between\nparticularism and methodism, with methodism emerging the victor. For\nexample, the meditator (while voicing empiricist sensibilities) puts\nforward, as candidates for the foundations of knowledge, such prima\nfacie obvious claims as \u201cthat I am here, sitting by the fire,\nwearing a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my\nhands, and so on\u201d \u2013 particular matters \u201cabout which\ndoubt is quite impossible,\u201d or so it would seem (AT 7:18, CSM\n2:12f). In response (and at each level of the dialectic), Descartes\ninvokes his own methodical principles to show that the prima facie\nobviousness of such particular claims is insufficient to meet the\nburden of proof.\n\nAnother methodological feature of the Meditations is its\nfirst-person, meditative character. Gary Hatfield explains.\n\nDescartes adopted the strategy of writing his Meditations as\nmeditations. In other words, he modeled his book in metaphysics and\nthe theory of knowledge (or \u201cepistemology\u201d) on a form of\nreligious writing, that of \u201cmeditations\u201d or\n\u201cspiritual exercises\u201d \u2026 In spiritual exercises,\nwhich were common in Jesuit schools such as the one Descartes attended\n(La Fl\u00e8che), readers learn to abandon the world of the senses\nand sensuality and to focus on God. \u2026 Because the\nMeditations is constructed in the hope that each reader will\ntake on the identity of the \u201cI\u201d of the narrative, the\npresumed reader of the text is called \u201cthe meditator.\u201d\n(2006, 125)\n\n",
