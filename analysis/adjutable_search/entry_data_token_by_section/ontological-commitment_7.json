    "main_text": "Entailment Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Overview\n2.1 Overview\nAccording to an entailment account of ontological commitment: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\nif and only if T entails that Ks exist. One must\nspeak of an entailment account because different entailment\nrelations lead to different accounts of ontological commitment; the\nchallenge is to find the right entailment relation. But in\nany case, entailment accounts do not \u201clook to the values of the\nvariables\u201d for the ontological commitments of a theory.\nQuantifiers and variables have no privileged role; they figure into\nthe ontological commitments of a theory only to the extent that they\nfigure into the entailments of the theory, just as with other\ncomponents of the sentences of the theory.\nEntailment accounts, as understood here, have the feature that\nontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. (Thus, the metalinguistic\naccount discussed in \u00a71.4 is not\nincluded.)  Two theories that have the same content, then, have the\nsame ontological commitments. If we say that theories have the same\ncontent just when they mutually entail one another, then each\nentailment account comes with its own notion of content; the problem\nof finding the right entailment relation is just the problem of\nfinding the right notion of content, the notion that is relevant to\nontological commitment.\nIt is convenient, though not obligatory, to hypostasize content and\nspeak of the propositions expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory. That allows us to neatly separate the problem of determining\nthe ontological commitments of a theory (set of sentences) into two\ncomponents: What propositions are expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory? And, what are the ontological commitments, that is, the\nexistential entailments, of those propositions? Indeed, we could then\nchoose to construe theories as sets of propositions and treat all talk\nof sentences as outside the bounds of an account of ontological\ncommitment proper. But propositions are controversial entities, not\naccepted by all parties to the debate. To maintain neutrality, we will\ncontinue to apply ontological commitment to theories construed as sets\nof sentences, but with the understanding that, for the friend of\npropositions, the ontological commitment of sentences is just the\nontological commitment of the propositions those sentences\nexpress.\nThe principle advantage of entailment accounts over quantifier\naccounts is that they have no problem with implicit ontological\ncommitment. (Or, more exactly, since different entailment accounts\nwill differ as to what counts as implicit content, entailment accounts\nhave no problem with what counts as implicit ontological commitment by\nthat account's own standards.) If \u2018\u2203x\nHuman(x)\u2019 entails not only that humans exist, but that\nhumanity exists, then it is ontologically committed to properties or\nuniversals, even though no property or universal is the value of any\nquantified variable. If \u2018\u2203x\nParent(x)\u2019 entails that children exist, then\n\u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019 is ontologically\ncommitted to children, again, even though it need not \u201cquantify\nover\u201d any children. An entailment account, unlike the quantifier\naccount, gets these cases right\u2014supposing, that is, we want our\naccount to capture implicit ontological commitment.\nFor a stark illustration of the difference between entailment and\nquantifier accounts, consider a theory T that contains the\nsingle sentence \u2018\u2203x K(x)\u2019\nand the theory T* that contains the single sentence\n\u2018True(T)\u2019 (see Peacock (2011: 81\u20132), who\ncalls T* a \u201cmeta-theory\u201d). T\nand T* mutually entail one another (assuming\n\u2018K\u2019 is not a semantical predicate); they thus\nhave the same ontological commitments on an entailment account. And\nthis seems right.  Surely, a philosopher cannot eliminate her\ncommitment to Ks by switching from T to T*;\nit matters not that T*'s commitment to Ks is only\nimplicit. But this implicit ontological commitment is invisible to the\nquantifier account because T* has no quantificational\nstructure. Once again, by missing implicit commitments, the quantifier\naccount fails to capture the ontological costs of a theory.\nThe principle disadvantage of an entailment account as compared\nwith a quantifier account is that it fails to provide a neutral\nplatform for assessing the ontological costs of theories:\ndisagreements over ontology will often reappear as disagreements over\nthe existential entailments of a theory. Here it is important to\ndistinguish two things that might be meant by \u201ccriterion of\nontological commitment\u201d. (This isn't always done; but Jackson\n(1989) and Rayo (2007) are clear on the distinction.) One might mean\na test by which ontological commitments can be discovered. Or\none might mean an analysis that says what ontological\ncommitment consists in. An adequate test would be a procedure\nthat could be applied by all parties in a neutral way, independently\nof those parties' prior ontological beliefs. Quine believed that the\nquantifier criterion provided such a test. He was aware, of course,\nthat there would be disputes over how best to regiment theories within\nfirst-order logic. But\u2014or so he thought\u2014once theories were\nregimented, the quantifier criterion would supply unequivocal\nverdicts.\nA correct analysis of ontological commitment, however\ntheoretically valuable, might do nothing towards providing an adequate\ntest. Such an analysis, unaccompanied by a test, would be of little\nhelp in determining the ontological costs of theories, or resolving\nontological disputes. Entailment accounts have good claim to providing\na correct analysis of ontological commitment; but they do not provide\na test. For one thing, the parties to an ontological dispute will\noften disagree as to what propositions are expressed by the sentences\nof a theory, that is, as to what the truth conditions of those\nsentences are. Quine's criterion bypasses this problematic step by\napplying the criterion only to already regimented theories. For a\nsecond thing, parties to an ontological dispute will often disagree\nover the existential entailments of a theory (see\n\u00a72.2 below).  Quine's criterion (as he understood it) avoids\nthis problem by focusing on the formal relation of logical entailment\nbetween sentences, a relation that is well understood. The material\nrelations of entailment between the propositions, however\u2014be\nthey modal, or conceptual, or a priori\u2014are matters of\nmuch dispute. If the goal is to find an adequate test for ontological\ncommitment, entailment accounts fall short.\nInitially, one might have hoped to combine an entailment\naccount, qua analysis, with a quantifier\naccount, qua test. (Arguably, this is the best way to\nunderstand Quine's project.) But the problems with implicit commitment\nsuggest that the entailment analysis and the quantifier test do not\nmatch up, that the test will undergenerate with respect to the\nanalysis. One could dampen one's ambitions, and be content with a\none-sided test, a test that in general provides only a sufficient\ncondition. (This is suggested by Rayo (2007: 432) as a response to the\nproblem of extrinsic properties.) But a one-sided test won't be of\nmuch help in comparing the ontological costs of theories. Such\ncomparisons require that all costs be put on the table.\n",
