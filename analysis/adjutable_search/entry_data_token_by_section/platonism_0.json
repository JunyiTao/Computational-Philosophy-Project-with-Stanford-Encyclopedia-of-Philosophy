    "main_text": "What is Platonism?\n1. What is Platonism?\n\nPlatonism is the view that there exist abstract (that is, non-spatial,\nnon-temporal) objects (see the entry on\n abstract objects).\n Because abstract objects are wholly non-spatiotemporal, it follows\nthat they are also entirely non-physical (they do not exist in the\nphysical world and are not made of physical stuff) and non-mental\n(they are not minds or ideas in minds; they are not disembodied souls,\nor Gods, or anything else along these lines). In addition, they are\nunchanging and entirely causally inert \u2014 that is, they cannot be\ninvolved in cause-and-effect relationships with other\n objects.[1]\n All of this might be somewhat perplexing; for with all of these\nstatements about what abstract objects are not, it might be\nunclear what they are. We can clarify things, however, by\nlooking at some examples.\n\nConsider the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019. This sentence seems to\nsay something about a particular object, namely, the number 3. Just as\nthe sentence \u2018The moon is round\u2019 says something about the\nmoon, so too \u20183 is prime\u2019 seems to say something about the\nnumber 3. But what is the number 3? There are a few different\nviews that one might endorse here, but the platonist view is that 3 is\nan abstract object. On this view, 3 is a real and objective thing\nthat, like the moon, exists independently of us and our thinking\n(i.e., it is not just an idea in our heads). But according to\nplatonism, 3 is different from the moon in that it is not a physical\nobject; it is wholly non-physical, non-mental, and causally inert, and\nit does not exist in space or time. One might put this metaphorically\nby saying that on the platonist view, numbers exist \u201cin platonic\nheaven\u201d. But we should not infer from this that according to\nplatonism, numbers exist in a place; they do not, for the\nconcept of a place is a physical, spatial concept. It is more accurate\nto say that on the platonist view, numbers exist (independently of us\nand our thoughts) but do not exist in space and time.\n\nSimilarly, many philosophers take a platonistic view of\n properties.\n Consider, for instance, the property of being red. According to the\nplatonist view of properties, the property of redness exists\nindependently of any red thing. There are red balls and red houses and\nred shirts, and these all exist in the physical world. But platonists\nabout properties believe that in addition to these things, redness\n\u2014 the property itself \u2014 also exists, and according to\nplatonists, this property is an abstract object. Ordinary red objects\nare said to exemplify or instantiate redness. Plato\nsaid that they participate in redness, but this suggests a\ncausal relationship between red objects and redness, and again,\ncontemporary platonists would reject this.\n\nPlatonists of this sort say the same thing about other properties as\nwell: in addition to all the beautiful things, there is also beauty;\nand in addition to all the tigers, there is also the property of being\na tiger. Indeed, even when there are no instances of a property in\nreality, platonists will typically maintain that the property itself\nexists. This isn't to say that platonists are committed to the thesis\nthat there is a property corresponding to every predicate in the\nEnglish language. The point is simply that in typical cases, there\nwill be a property. For instance, according to this sort of platonism,\nthere exists a property of being a four-hundred-story building, even\nthough there are no such things as four-hundred-story buildings. This\nproperty exists outside of space and time along with redness. The only\ndifference is that in our physical world, the one property happens to\nbe instantiated whereas the other does not.\n\nIn fact, platonists extend the position here even further, for on\ntheir view, properties are just a special case of a much broader\ncategory, namely, the category of universals. It's easy to\nsee why one might think of a property like redness as a universal. A\nred ball that sits in a garage in Buffalo is a particular thing. But\nredness is something that is exemplified by many, many objects; it's\nsomething that all red objects share, or have in common. This is why\nplatonists think of redness as a universal and of specific red objects\n\u2014 such as balls in Buffalo, or cars in Cleveland \u2014 as\nparticulars.\n\nBut according to this sort of platonism, properties are not the only\nuniversals; there are other kinds of universals as well, most notably,\nrelations. Consider, for instance, the relation to the\nnorth of; this relation is instantiated by many pairs of objects\n(or more accurately, by ordered pairs of objects, since order matters\nhere \u2014 e.g., to the north of is instantiated by <San\nFrancisco, Los Angeles>, and <Edinburgh, London>, but not by\n<Los Angeles, San Francisco>, or <London, Edinburgh>). So\naccording to platonism, the relation to the north of is a\ntwo-place universal, whereas a property like redness is a\none-place universal. There are also three-place relations\n(which are three-place universals), four-place relations, and so on.\nAn example of a three-place relation is the gave relation,\nwhich admits of a giver, a givee, and a given \u2014 as in\n\u2018Jane gave a CD to Tim\u2019.\n\nFinally, some philosophers claim that propositions are\nabstract objects. One way to think of a proposition is as the meaning\nof a sentence. Alternatively, we can say that a proposition is that\nwhich is expressed by a sentence on a particular occasion of use.\nEither way, we can say that, e.g., the English sentence \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019 and the German sentence \u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019\nexpress the same proposition, namely, the proposition that snow is\nwhite.\n\nThere are many different platonistic conceptions of propositions. For\ninstance, Frege (1892, 1919) held that propositions are composed of\nsenses of words (e.g., on this view, the proposition that\nsnow is white is composed of the senses of \u2018snow\u2019 and\n\u2018is white\u2019), whereas Russell at one point (1905,\n1910\u201311) held that propositions are composed of properties,\nrelations, and objects (e.g., on this view, the proposition that Mars\nis red is composed of Mars (the planet itself) and the\nproperty of redness). Others hold that propositions do not\nhave significant internal structure. The differences between these\nviews will not matter for our purposes. For more detail, see the entry\non\n propositions.\n\n(It might seem odd to say that Russellian propositions are abstract\nobjects. Consider, e.g., the Russellian proposition that Mars is red.\nThis is an odd sort of hybrid object. It has two components,\nnamely, Mars (the planet itself) and the property of redness. One of\nthese components (namely, Mars) is a concrete object (where a\nconcrete object is just a spatiotemporal object). Thus, even if\nredness is an abstract object, it does not seem that the Russellian\nproposition is completely non-spatiotemporal. Nonetheless,\nphilosophers typically lump these objects together with abstract\nobjects. And it's not just Russellian propositions; similar remarks\ncan be made about various other kinds of objects. Think, for instance,\nof impure sets--e.g., the set containing Mars and Jupiter. This seems\nto be a hybrid object of some kind as well, because while it has\nconcrete objects as members, it's still a set, and on the\nstandard view, sets are abstract objects. If we wanted to be really\nprecise, it would probably be best to have another term for such\nobjects--e.g., \u2018hybrid object\u2019, or \u2018impure abstract\nobject\u2019--but, again, this isn't how philosophers typically talk;\nthey usually just treat these things as abstract objects. None of this\nwill matter very much in what follows, however, because this essay is\nalmost entirely concerned with what might be called pure\nabstract objects--i.e., abstract objects that are completely\nnon-spatiotemporal.) \n\nNumbers, propositions, and universals (i.e., properties and relations)\nare not the only things that people have taken to be abstract objects.\nAs we will see below, people have also endorsed platonistic views in\nconnection with linguistic objects (most notably, sentences), possible\nworlds, logical objects, and fictional characters (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). And it is important to note here that one can be a platonist\nabout some of these things without being a platonist about the others\n\u2014 e.g., one might be a platonist about numbers and propositions\nbut not properties or fictional characters.\n\nOf course, platonism about any of these kinds of objects is\ncontroversial. Many philosophers do not believe in abstract objects at\nall. The alternatives to platonism will be discussed in\n section 2,\n but it is worth noting here that the primary argument that platonists\ngive for their view is that, according to them, there are good\narguments against all other views. That is, platonists think we have\nto believe in abstract objects, because (a) there are good reasons for\nthinking that things like numbers and universals exist, and (b) the\nonly tenable view of these things is that they are abstract objects.\nWe will consider these arguments in detail below.\n",
