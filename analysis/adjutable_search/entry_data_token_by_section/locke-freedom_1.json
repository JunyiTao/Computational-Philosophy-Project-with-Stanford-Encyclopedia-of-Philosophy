    "main_text": "Will and Willing\n2. Will and Willing\nWithin the category of actions, Locke distinguishes between those\nthat are voluntary and those that are involuntary. To understand this\ndistinction, we need to understand Locke\u2019s account of the will\nand his account of willing (or volition). For Locke, the will is a\npower (ability, faculty\u2014see E1\u20135 II.xxi.20: 244) possessed by a\nperson (or by that person\u2019s mind). Locke explains how we come by\nthe idea of power (in Humean vein, as the result of\nobservation of constant conjunctions\u2014\u201clike Changes [being]\nmade, in the same things, by like Agents, and by the like ways\u201d\n(E1\u20135 II.xxi.1: 233)), but does not offer a theory of\nthe nature of power. What we are told is that\n\u201cPowers are Relations\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.19: 243),\nrelations \u201cto Action or Change\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.3: 234), and\nthat powers are either active (powers to make changes) or passive\n(powers to receive changes) (E1\u20135 II.xxi.2: 234). In this sense, the\nwill is an active relation to actions.\nLocke\u2019s predecessors had thought of the will as intimately\nrelated to the faculty of desire or appetite. For the Scholastics\n(whose works Locke read as a student at Oxford), the will is the power\nof rational appetite. For Thomas Hobbes (by whom Locke was deeply\ninfluenced even though this was not something he could advertise,\nbecause Hobbes was a pariah in Locke\u2019s intellectual and\npolitical circles), the will is simply the power of desire\nitself. Remnants of this desiderative conception of the will remain in\nLocke\u2019s theory, particularly in the first edition of\nthe Essay.  Here, for example, is Locke\u2019s official E1\naccount of the will:\n This Power the Mind has to prefer\nthe consideration of any Idea to the not considering it; or\nto prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest. (E1\nII.xxi.5: 236)\n\n And here is Locke\u2019s official E1 account\n of preferring:\n Well, but what is this Preferring?\nIt is nothing but the being pleased more with the\none, than the other. (E1 II.xxi.28: 248)\n\n \nSo, in E1, the will is the mind\u2019s power\nto be more pleased with the consideration of an idea than with the\nnot considering it, or to be more pleased with the motion of a part\nof one\u2019s body than with its remaining at rest. When we lack\nsomething that would deliver more pleasure than we currently\nexperience, we become uneasy at its absence. And this kind of\nuneasiness (or pain: E1\u20135 II.vii.1: 128), is what Locke describes as\ndesire (E1\u20135 II.xx.6: 230; E2\u20135 II.xxi.31\u201332: 251) (though also\nas \u201cjoined with\u201d, \u201cscarce distinguishable\nfrom\u201d, and a \u201ccause\u201d of\ndesire\u2014see Section 8 below). So, in E1,\nthe will is the mind\u2019s power to desire or want the\nconsideration of an idea more than the not considering it, or to\ndesire or want the motion of a part of one\u2019s body more than its\nremaining at rest. (At E2\u20135 II.xxi.5: 236, Locke adds\n\u201cand vice vers\u00e2\u201d, to clarify that it can\nalso happen, even according to the E1 account, that one prefers not\nconsidering an idea to considering it, or not moving to\nmoving.)[1]\nIn keeping with this conception of the will as desire, Locke in E1\nthen defines an exercise of the will, which he calls\n\u201cwilling\u201d or \u201cvolition\u201d, as an \u201cactual\npreferring\u201d of one thing to another (E1 II.xxi.5: 236). For\nexample, I have the power to prefer the upward motion of my arm to its\nremaining at rest by my side. This power, in E1, is one aspect of my\nwill. When I exercise this power, I actually prefer the upward motion\nof my arm to its remaining at rest, i.e., I am more pleased with my\narm\u2019s upward motion than I am with its continuing to rest. This\nis what Locke, in E1, thinks of as my willing the upward motion of my\narm (or, as he sometimes puts it, my willing or volition to move\nmy arm upward).\nIn E2\u20135, Locke explicitly gives up this conception of the\nwill and willing, explaining why he does so, making corresponding\nchanges in the text of the Essay, even while leaving passages\nthat continue to suggest the desiderative conception. He writes:\n\u201c[T]hough a Man would preferr flying to walking, yet who can say\nhe ever wills it?\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.15: 241). The thought\nhere is that, as Locke (rightly) recognizes, my being more pleased\nwith flying than walking does not consist in (or even entail) my\nwilling to fly. This is in large part because it is necessarily\nimplied in willing motion of a certain sort that one exert dominion\nthat one takes oneself to have (E2\u20135 II.xxi.15: 241), that \u201cthe\nmind [endeavor] to give rise\u2026to [the motion], which it takes to\nbe in its power\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.30: 250). So if I do not believe\nthat it is in my power to fly, then it is impossible for me\nto will the motion of flying, even though I might be more\npleased with flying than I am with any alternative. Locke concludes\n(with the understatement) that \u201cPreferring which seems\nperhaps best to express the Act of Volition, does it not\nprecisely\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.15: 240\u2013241).\nIn addition, Locke points out that it is possible for\n\u201cthe Will and Desire [to] run\ncounter\u201d. For example, as a result of being coerced or\nthreatened, I might will to persuade someone of something, even though\nI desire that I not succeed in persuading her. Or, suffering from\ngout, I might desire to be eased of the pain in my feet, and yet at\nthe same time, recognizing that the translation of such pain would\naffect my health for the worse, will that I not be eased of my foot\npain. In concluding that \u201cdesiring and willing are two\ndistinct Acts of the mind\u201d, Locke must be assuming (reasonably)\nthat it is not possible to will an action and its contrary at the same\ntime (E2\u20135 II.xxi.30:\n 250).[2]\nWith what conception of the will and willing does Locke replace the\nabandoned desiderative conception? The answer is that in E2\u20135 Locke\ndescribes the will as a kind of directive or commanding faculty, the\npower to direct (or issue commands to) one\u2019s body or mind: it\nis, he writes,\n a Power to begin or forbear, continue\nor end several actions of our minds, and motions of our Bodies, barely\nby a thought or preference of the mind ordering, or as it were\ncommanding the doing or not doing such or such particular\naction. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.5: 236)\n\n Consonant with this non-desiderative, directive conception of the\nwill, Locke claims that\n\nVolition, or Willing, is an act of the Mind\ndirecting its thought to the production of any Action, and thereby\nexerting its power to produce it, (E2\u20135 II.xxi.28: 248)\n\nthat \n\nVolition is nothing, but that particular determination of the\nmind, whereby, barely by a thought, the mind endeavours to give rise,\ncontinuation, or stop to any Action, which it takes to be in its\npower. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.30: 250)\nEvery volition, then, is a volition to act or to\nforbear, where willing to act is a matter of commanding\none\u2019s body to move or one\u2019s mind to think, and willing to\nforbear is a matter of commanding one\u2019s body to rest or\none\u2019s mind not to think. Unlike a desiderative power, which is\nessentially passive (as involving the ability to be more pleased with\none thing than another), the will in E2\u20135 is an intrinsically active\npower, the exercise of which involves the issuing of mental commands\ndirected at one\u2019s own body and mind.\n3. Voluntary vs. Involuntary Action/Forbearance\nWithin the category of actions/forbearances, Locke distinguishes\nbetween those that are voluntary and those that are involuntary.\nLocke does not define voluntariness and involuntariness in E1, but he\ndoes in E2\u20135:\nThe forbearance or performance of [an] action,\nconsequent to such order or command of the mind is\ncalled Voluntary. And whatsoever action is performed without\nsuch a thought of the mind is called Involuntary.  (E2\u20134\nII.xxi.5: 236\u2014in E5, \u201cor performance\u201d is omitted\nfrom the first sentence)\nLocke is telling us that what makes an action/forbearance voluntary\nis that it is consequent to a volition, and that what makes an\naction/forbearance involuntary is that it is performed without a\nvolition. The operative words here are \u201cconsequent to\u201d and\n\u201cwithout\u201d. What do they mean? (Henceforth, following\nLocke\u2019s lead, I will not distinguish between actions and\nforbearances unless the context calls for it.)\nWe can begin with something Locke says only in E1:\nVolition, or the Act of Willing, signifies\nnothing properly, but the actual producing of something that is\nvoluntary. (E1 II.xxi.33: 259)\nOn reflection, this is mistaken, but it does provide a clue to\nLocke\u2019s conception of voluntariness. The mistake (of which Locke\nlikely became aware, given that the statement clashes with the rest of\nhis views and was removed from E2\u20135) is that not every instance of\nwilling an action is followed by the action itself.  To use one of\nLocke\u2019s own examples, if I am locked in a room and will to\nleave, my volition will not result in my leaving (E1\u20135 II.xxi.10:\n238). So willing cannot signify the \u201cactual producing\u201d of\na voluntary action. However, it is reasonable to assume that, for\nLocke, willing will \u201cproduce\u201d a voluntary action if\nnothing hinders the willed episode of motion or thought. And this\nmakes it likely that Locke takes a voluntary action to be not merely\ntemporally consequent to, but actually caused by, the right kind of\nvolition (Yaffe 2000; for a contrary view, see Hoffman 2005).\nUnderstandably, some commentators have worried about the problem of\ndeviant causation, and whether Locke has an answer to it (e.g., Lowe\n1995: 122\u2013123; Yaffe 2000: 104; Lowe 2005: 141\u2013147). The\nproblem is that if I let go of a climbing rope, not as a direct result\nof willing to let it go, but as a result of being\ndiscomfited/paralyzed/shaken by the volition itself, then my letting\ngo of the rope would not count as voluntary even though it was caused\nby a volition to let go of the rope. The solution to this problem, if\nthere is one, is to claim that, in order for an action to count as\nvoluntary, it is not sufficient for it to be caused by the right kind\nof volition: in addition, it is necessary that the action be\ncaused in the right way (or non-deviantly) by the right kind\nof volition. Spelling out the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor non-deviant causation is a steep climb. Chances are that\nLocke was no more aware of this problem, and was in no better position\nto answer it, than anyone else was before Chisholm (1966), Taylor\n(1966) and Davidson (1980) brought it to the attention of the\nphilosophical community.\nLocke\u2019s view, then, is that an action is voluntary inasmuch\nas its performance is caused by a volition. The volition, as we have\nso far presumed, must be of the right kind. For example, Locke would\nnot count the motion of my left arm as voluntary if it were caused by\na volition that my right arm move (or a volition that my left arm\nremain at rest). Locke assumes (reasonably) that in order for an\naction A to be voluntary, it must be caused (in the right way)\nby a volition that A occur (or, as Locke sometimes\nputs it, by a volition to do A).\nWhat, then, on Locke\u2019s view, is it for an action to\nbe involuntary? Locke says that an involuntary action is\nperformed \u201cwithout\u201d a volition. This might suggest that an\naction of mine is involuntary only when I have no volition that the\naction occur. Perhaps this is what Locke believes. But it is more\nreasonable to suppose that Locke would also count as involuntary an\naction that, though preceded by the right kind of volition, is either\nnot caused by the volition or caused by the volition but not in the\nright way.[3]\nSome commentators have worried that Locke\u2019s \u201clocked\nroom\u201d example is a problematic illustration of his theory of\nvoluntariness, at least as applied to forbearances (e.g., Lowe 1986:\n154\u2013157; Stuart 2013: 420). Locke imagines a man who is\n\u201ccarried, while fast asleep, into a Room, where is a Person he\nlongs to see and speak with\u201d, but who is \u201cthere locked\nfast in, beyond his Power to get out: he awakes, and is glad to find\nhimself in so desirable Company\u201d and \u201cstays\nwillingly\u201d in the room. Locke makes clear that, on his view, the\nman\u2019s remaining in the room is a voluntary forbearance to leave\n(E1\u20135 II.xxi.10: 238). But one might worry that if the man is unable\nto leave the room, then it is false to say that his volition not to\nleave causes his not leaving. At best, it might be argued,\nthe man\u2019s not leaving is overdetermined (Stuart 2013: 420).\nBut, as some authors have recently argued, cases of overdetermination\nare rightly described as involving two (or more) causes, not a single\njoint cause or no cause at all (see, e.g., Schaffer 2003). On such a\nview of overdetermination, it is unproblematic for Locke to describe\nthe man in the locked room as caused to remain both by his volition to\nremain and by the door\u2019s being\nlocked.[4]\nAnother problem that has been raised for Locke stems from his\nexample of a man who falls into a river when a bridge breaks under\nhim. Locke describes the man as willing not to fall, even as he is\nfalling (E1\u20135 II.xxi.9: 238). The worry here is that Locke holds that\nthe objects of volition are actions or forbearances, so the man would\nneed to be described as willing to forbear from falling. But, it might\nbe argued, falling is not an action, for it is something that merely\nhappens to the man, and not an exercise of his agency; so his\nwillingly forbearing from falling would be willingly forbearing from\nsomething that is not an action, and this is impossible (Stuart 2013:\n405). The answer to this worry is that falling is an action,\naccording to Locke\u2019s Deflationary conception of action, which\ncounts the motion of one\u2019s body in any direction as a bona\nfide action (see Section 1 above). \n4. Freedom and Necessity\nSome commentators think that Lockean freedom (or, as Locke also\ncalls it, \u201cliberty\u201d) is a single power, the power to do\nwhat one wills (Yolton 1970: 144; D. Locke 1975: 96; O\u2019Higgins\n1976: 119\u2014see Chappell 1994: 103). However, as Locke describes\nit, freedom is a \u201ctwo-way\u201d power, really a combination of\ntwo conditional powers belonging to an agent, that is, to someone\nendowed with a will (see Chappell 2007: 142). (A tennis ball, for\nexample, \u201chas not Liberty, is not a free Agent\u201d,\nbecause it is incapable of volition (E1\u20135 II.xxi.9: 238).) In E1,\nLocke\u2019s definition reflects his conception of the will as a\npower of preferring X to Y, or being more pleased\nwith X than with Y. But in E2\u20135, Locke\u2019s\ndefinition reflects his modified conception of the will as a power to\nissue commands to one\u2019s body or mind\n(see Section 2 above):\n\n [S]o far as a Man has a power to think, or not to think; to move,\nor not to move, according to the preference or direction of his own\nmind, so far is a Man Free. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.8: 237) \n So that the Idea of Liberty, is\nthe Idea of a Power in any Agent to do or forbear any\nparticular Action, according to the determination or thought of the\nmind, whereby either of them is preferr\u2019d to the other. (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.8: 237) \n Liberty is not an Idea belonging to Volition, or\npreferring; but to the Person having the Power of doing, or forbearing\nto do, according as the Mind shall chuse or direct. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.10:\n238)\n Liberty\u2026is the power a Man has to do or forbear\ndoing any particular Action, according as its doing or forbearance has\nthe actual preference in the Mind, which is the same thing as to say,\naccording as he himself wills it. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.15: 241)\n\nThe central claim here is that a human being (person, agent) is\nfree with respect to a particular action A (or forbearance to\nperform A) inasmuch as (i) if she wills to do A then she\nhas the power to do A and (ii) if she wills to forbear\ndoing A then she has the power to forbear doing A (see,\ne.g., Chappell 1994: \n 103).[5]\n So, for example, a woman in a locked room is\nnot free with respect to the act of leaving (or with respect to the\nforbearance to leave) because she does not have the power to leave if\nand when she wills to leave, and a woman who is falling (the bridge\nunder her having crumbled) is not free with respect to the forbearance\nto fall (or with respect to the act of falling) because she does not\nhave the power to forbear falling if she wills not to fall (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.9\u201310: 238). (Locke describes agents who are unfree with\nrespect to some action as acting under, or by, necessity\u2014E1\u20135\nII.xxi.8: 238; E1\u20135 II.xxi.9: 238.) But if the door of the room is\nunlocked, then the woman in the room is able to stay if she wills to\nstay, and is able to leave if she wills to leave: she is therefore\nboth free with respect to staying and free with respect to\nleaving. \nNotice that freedom, on Locke\u2019s conception of it, is a\nproperty of substances (persons, human beings, agents). This simply\nfollows from the fact that freedom is a dual power and from the fact\nthat \u201cPowers belong only to Agents,\nand are Attributes only of Substances\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.16:\n241).  At no point does Locke offer an account of performing actions\nor forbearances freely, as if freedom were a way of\nperforming an action or a way of forbearing to perform an action. (For\na contrary view, see LoLordo 2012: 27.)\nLocke does write that\n[w]here-ever any performance or forbearance\nare not equally in a Man\u2019s power; where-ever doing or not doing,\nwill not equally follow upon the preference of his mind directing it,\nthere he is not Free. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.8: 237)\nThe \u201cfollow upon\u201d language might suggest a\ncounterfactual analysis of the claim that an agent has the power to\ndo A if she wills to do A, namely, that if she were to\nwill to do A then she would do A (e.g., Lowe 1995: 129;\nStuart 2013: 407\u2014for a similar account that trades the\nsubjunctive conditionals for indicative conditionals, see Yaffe 2000:\n15). The counterfactual analysis is tempting, but also unlikely to\ncapture Locke\u2019s meaning, especially if he has a Deflationary\nconception of action/forbearance (see Section 1\nabove). It might happen, for example, that I am prevented (by chains\nor a force field) from raising my arm, but that if I were to will that\nmy arm rise, you would immediately (break the chains or disable the\nforce field and) raise my arm. Under these conditions, I would not be\nfree with respect to my arm\u2019s rising, but it would be true that\nif I were to will that my arm rise, then my arm would rise. So\nLocke\u2019s dual power conception of freedom of action is not\ncaptured by any counterfactual conditional or pair of counterfactual\nconditionals.\nDoes Locke think that there is a conceptual connection between\nfreedom of action and voluntary action? It might be thought that\nfreedom with respect to a particular action requires that the action\nbe voluntary, so that if an action is not voluntary then one is not\nfree with respect to it. In defense of this, one might point to\nLocke\u2019s falling man, whose falling is not voluntary and who is\nalso not free with respect to the act of falling (Stuart 2013:\n408). But the falling man\u2019s unfreedom with respect to the act of\nfalling is not explained by the involuntariness of his\nfalling. In general, it is possible for one\u2019s action to be\ninvoluntary even as one is free with respect to it. Imagine that you\nlet your four-year old daughter raise your arm (just for\nfun). According to Locke\u2019s conception of voluntariness, the\nmotion of your arm is not voluntary, because it is not caused by any\nvolition of yours (indeed, we can even imagine that you do not even\nhave a volition that your arm rise). But, according to Locke\u2019s\nconception of freedom, you are most certainly free with respect to\nyour arm\u2019s rising: (i) if you will that your arm rise, you have\nthe power to raise it, and (ii) if you will that your arm not rise,\nyou have the power to forbear raising it.\nVoluntariness, then, is not necessary for freedom; but it is also\nnot sufficient for freedom, as Locke\u2019s \u201clocked room\u201d\nand \u201cparalytick\u201d cases show. The man in the locked room\nwills to stay and talk to the other person in the room, and this\nvolition is causally responsible for his staying in the room: on\nLocke\u2019s theory, his remaining in the room is, therefore,\nvoluntary. But the man in the locked room \u201cis not at liberty not\nto stay, he has not freedom to be gone\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.10:\n238). The reason is that even if the man wills to leave, he does not\nhave the power to leave. Similarly, if the paralyzed person wills to\nremain at rest (thinking, mistakenly, that he could move if he willed\nto move) and his remaining at rest is caused (at least in part) by his\nvolition not to move, then his \u201csitting still\u2026is truly\nvoluntary\u201d. But in this case, says Locke, \u201cthere is want\nof Freedom\u201d because \u201ca Palsie [hinders] his Legs\nfrom obeying the determination of his Mind, if it would thereby\ntransferr his Body to another Place\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.11: 239): that\nis, the paralyzed person is unable to move even if he wills to\nmove.\nThus far, we have been focusing on freedom with respect to motion\nor rest of one\u2019s body. But, as we have seen, Locke\nthinks that actions encompass acts of mind (in addition to acts of\nbody). So, in addition to thinking that some acts of mind are\nvoluntary (e.g., the mental acts of combining and abstracting ideas\ninvolved in the production of abstract ideas of mixed modes\u2014E2\u20135\nII.xxxii.12: 387\u2013388), Locke thinks that we are free with\nrespect to some mental actions (and their forbearances). For example,\nif I am able to combine two ideas at will, and I am able to forbear\ncombining two ideas if I will not to combine them, then I am free with\nrespect to the mental action of combining two ideas. It can also\nhappen that we are not free with respect to our mental acts:\nA Man on the Rack, is not at liberty\nto lay by the Idea of pain, and divert himself with other\nContemplations. (E4\u20135 II.xxi.12: 239)\nIn this case, even though the man on the rack might will to be rid\nof the pain, he does not have the power to avoid feeling\nit.[6]\n5. Free Will\nIs the will free? This question made sense to Scholastic\nphilosophers (including, e.g., Bramhall, who engaged in a protracted\ndebate on the subject with Hobbes), who tended not to distinguish\nbetween the question of whether the will is free and the question of\nwhether the mind or soul is free with respect to willing, and, indeed,\nsome of whom thought that acts cannot themselves be free (or freely\ndone) unless the will to do them is itself free. But, according to\nLocke, the question, if literally understood, \u201cis altogether\nimproper\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.14: 240). This follows directly from\nLocke\u2019s account of the will and his account of freedom. The will\nis a power (in E2\u20135, the power to order the motion or rest of\none\u2019s body and the power to order the consideration or\nnon-consideration of an idea\u2014see Section 2\nabove), and freedom is a power, namely the power to do or not do as\none wills (see Section 4 above). But, as Locke\nemphasizes, the question of whether one power has another power is\n\u201ca Question at first sight too grosly absurd to make a Dispute,\nor need an Answer\u201d. The reason is that it is absurd to suppose\nthat powers are capable of having powers, for\n\nPowers belong only to Agents, and are Attributes\nonly of Substances, and not of Powers themselves.  (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.16: 241)\nThe question of whether the will is free, then, presupposes that\nthe will is a substance, rather than a power, and therefore makes no\nmore sense than the question of whether a man\u2019s \u201cSleep be\nSwift, or his Vertue square\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.14: 240). To suppose\nthat the will is free (or unfree!) is therefore to make a category\nmistake (see Ryle 1949: chapter 1).\n6. Freedom in Respect of Willing\nThe fact that it makes no sense to suppose that the will itself is\nfree (or unfree) does not entail that there are no significant\nquestions to be asked about the relation between freedom and the\nwill. Indeed, Locke thinks that there are two such questions, and that\nthese are the questions that capture \u201cwhat is meant, when it is\ndisputed, Whether the will be free\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.22:\n245). The first (discussed at E1\u20135 II.xxi.23\u201324) is whether\nagents (human beings, persons) are free with respect to\nwilling-one-way-or-another; more particularly, whether agents are\nable, if they so will, to avoid willing one way or the other with\nrespect to a proposed action. The second (discussed at E1\u20135 II.xxi.25)\nis whether agents are free with respect to\nwilling-a-particular-action. The majority of commentators think that\nLocke answers both of these questions negatively, at least in E1\u20134\n(see Chappell 1994, Lowe 1995, Jolley 1999, Glauser 2003, Stuart 2013,\nand Leisinger 2017), and some think that Locke then qualifies his\nanswer(s) in E2\u20135 in a way that potentially introduces inconsistency\ninto his moral psychology (e.g., Chappell 1994). Other commentators\nthink that Locke answers the first question negatively for most\nactions, but with one important qualification that is clarified and\nmade more explicit in E5, and that he answers the second question\npositively, all without falling into inconsistency (Rickless 2000;\nGarrett 2015). What follows is a summary of the interpretive\ncontroversies. In the rest of this Section, we focus on the first\nquestion. In the next, we focus on the second question.\nIn E1\u20134, Locke states his answer to the first question thus:\n[A] Man in respect of willing any\nAction in his power once proposed to his Thoughts cannot be\nfree. (E1\u20134 II.xxi.23: 245)\nHis argument for the necessity of having either a volition that\naction A occur or a volition that action A not occur,\nonce A has been proposed to one\u2019s thoughts, is simple and\nclever: (1) Either A will occur or A will not occur; (2)\nIf A occurs, this will be the result of the agent having\nwilled A to occur; (3) If A does not occur, this will be\nthe result of the agent having willed A not to occur;\ntherefore, (4) The agent necessarily wills one way or the other with\nrespect to A\u2019s occurrence (see Chappell 1994:\n105\u2013106). It follows directly that \u201cin respect of the act\nof willing, a Man is not free\u201d (E1\u20134 II.xxi.23:\n245). For, first, \u201cWilling, or Volition [is]\nan Action\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.23: 245\u2014this because actions\ncomprise motions of the body and operations of mind, and volition is\none of the most important mental operations\u2014E1\u20135 II.vi.2: 128),\nand, second, freedom with respect to action A, as Locke defines\nit, consists in (i) the power to do A if one wills to\ndo A and (ii) the power not to do A if one wills not to\ndo A. Thus, if an agent does not have the power to avoid\nwilling one way or the other with respect to A (even if the\nagent wills to avoid willing one way or the other with respect\nto A), then the agent is not free with respect to willing one\nway or the other with respect to A.\nIn his New Essays on Human Understanding (ready for\npublication in 1704, but not published then because that was the year\nof Locke\u2019s death) Gottfried Leibniz famously questions premise\n(3) of this argument:\nI would have thought that one can suspend\none\u2019s choice, and that this happens quite often, especially when\nother thoughts interrupt one\u2019s deliberation. Thus, although it\nis necessary that the action about which one is deliberating must\nexist or not exist, it doesn\u2019t follow at all that one\nnecessarily has to decide on its existence or non-existence. For its\nnon-existence could well come about in the absence of any decision.\n(Leibniz 1704 [1981]: 181)\nLeibniz\u2019s worry is that, even if one is thinking about\nwhether or not to do A, it is often possible to postpone\nwilling whether to do A, and the non-occurrence of A\nmight well result from such postponement. Under these conditions, it\nwould be false to say that A\u2019s non-occurrence results\nfrom any sort of volition that A not occur. Leibniz illustrates\nthe claim with an amusing reference to a case that the Areopagites\n(judges on the Areopagus, the highest court of appeals in Ancient\nAthens) were having trouble deciding, their solution (i.e., de\nfacto, but not de jure, acquittal) being to adjourn it\n\u201cto a date in the distant future, giving themselves a hundred\nyears to think about it\u201d (Leibniz 1704 [1981]: 181).\nIt is something of a concern, then, that Locke himself appears\ncommitted to agreeing with Leibniz\u2019s criticism of his own\nargument, at least in E2\u20135. For in E2\u20135 (but not in E1) Locke\nemphasizes his acceptance of the doctrine of suspension, according to\nwhich any agent has the \u201cpower to suspend the execution\nand satisfaction of any of its desires\u201d, during which time the\nwill is not yet \u201cdetermined to action\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.47:\n263). That is, Locke acknowledges in E2\u20135, even as he does not remove\nor alter the argument of II.xxi.23 in E2\u20134, that it is possible to\npostpone willing with respect to whether to will one way or the other\nwith respect to some proposed action (see Chappell 1994:\n106\u2013107).\nHowever, Locke makes changes in E5 that have suggested to some\ncommentators how he would avoid Leibniz\u2019s criticism without\ngiving up the doctrine of suspension. Recall Locke\u2019s answer to\nthe first question:\n[A] Man in respect of willing any Action in\nhis power once proposed to his Thoughts cannot be free. (E1\u20134\nII.xxi.23: 245)\nHere, now, is Locke\u2019s restatement of\n his answer in E5:\n[A] Man in respect of willing, or the Act\nof Volition, when any Action in his power is once proposed to his\nThoughts, as presently to be done, cannot be free.  (E5\nII.xxi.23: 245\u2014added material italicized)\nThe crucial addition here is the phrase\n\u201cas presently to be done\u201d. In E5, Locke is not saying that\nit is with respect to willing one way or the other with respect\nto any proposed action that an agent is not free: what he is\nsaying is that it is with respect to willing one way or the other with\nrespect to any proposed action as presently to be done that\nan agent is not free. Some actions that are proposed to us are to\noccur at the time of proposal: as I am singing, a friend\nmight propose that I stop singing right now. Other actions\nthat are proposed to us are to occur at a time later than the time\nof proposal: at the beginning of a long bicycle trip, a friend\nmight propose that we take a rest once we have reached our\ndestination. Locke is telling us in E5 that premise (3) is supposed to\napply to the former, not to the latter, sort of actions. If this is\nright, then it is no accident that Locke\u2019s own illustration of\nthe argument of II.xxi.23 involves \u201ca Man that is walking, to\nwhom it is proposed to give off walking\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.24:\n246). \nSo, as Locke incipiently recognizes as early as E1 but explicitly\nunderlines in E5, his initial answer to the first question is an\novergeneralization, and needs to be restricted to those actions that\nare proposed to us as presently to be done (see Rickless 2000:\n49\u201355; Glauser 2003: 710; Garrett 2015: 274\u2013277). But it\nis also possible that Locke comes to recognize, and eventually\nunderline, a second restriction. At the moment, I am sitting in a\nchair.  In a few minutes, my children will walk in and propose that I\nget up and make dinner. I am busy, my mind is occupied, so I will\nlikely postpone (perhaps only for a few minutes) making a decision\nabout whether to get up. The result of such postponement is that I\nwill not get up right away, but this will not be because I\nhave willed not to get up right away. Again, it seems that\npremise (3) is false, for reasons similar to the ones described by\nLeibniz. But this time, the relevant action (getting up) is proposed\nas presently to be done. Locke\u2019s E5 emendations do not\nexplicitly address this sort of example.\nHowever, in E2\u20135, but not in E1, Locke emphasizes the fact that in\nhis \u201cwalking man\u201d example, the man either \u201ccontinues\nthe Action [of walking], or puts an end to it\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.24:\n246). This suggests a different restriction, on top of the \u201cas\npresently to be done\u201d restriction. It may be that Locke is\nthinking that premise (3) applies, not to actions of all kinds, but\nonly to processes in which one is currently engaged.  The walking man\nis already in motion, constantly putting one leg in front of the\nother. When it is proposed to him that he give off walking, he has no\noption but to will one way or the other with respect to whether to\ngive off walking: if he stops walking, this will be because he willed\nthat his walking cease; and if he continues to walk, this will be\nbecause he willed that his walking continue. Either way, he must will\none way or the other with respect to whether to stop walking. By\ncontrast, when I am sitting in my chair, I am not engaged in a\nprocess: I am (or, at least, my body is) simply at rest. It is for\nthis reason that it is possible for me to avoid willing with respect\nto whether to get up right now: processes require volition to secure\ntheir continuation, but mere states (non-processes) do not (see\nRickless 2000: 49\u201355; for a contrary view, see Glauser 2003:\n710).\nLocke\u2019s considered answer to the first question, then, is\nthis: (i) when an action that is a process in which the agent is\ncurrently engaged is proposed as presently to be continued or stopped,\nthe agent is not free with respect to willing one way or the other\nwith respect to its continuing, but (ii) when an action is not a\nprocess in which the agent is currently engaged or is proposed as to\nbe done sometime in the future, then it is possible for the agent to\nbe free with respect to willing one way or the other with respect to\nits performance or non-performance. Given that, as Locke puts it in\nE5, the vast majority of voluntary actions \u201cthat succeed one\nanother every moment that we are awake\u201d (E5 II.xxi.24: 246) are\n(i)-actions rather than (ii)-actions, it makes sense for him to\nsummarize his answer to the first question as that it is \u201cin\nmost cases [that] a Man is not at Liberty to forbear the act of\nvolition\u201d (E5 II.xxi.56: 270). But, as Locke also emphasizes,\none has the ability, at least with respect to (ii)-actions, to suspend\nwilling. So there is no inconsistency at the heart of Locke\u2019s\ntheory of freedom in respect of willing.\n\n7. Freedom to Will\nThe second question regarding the relation between freedom and the\nwill that Locke takes to be significant is \u201cWhether a Man be\nat liberty to will which of the two he pleases, Motion or\nRest\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247). Consider a particular\naction A. What Locke is asking is whether an agent is free with\nrespect to the action of willing that A occur. For\nexample, suppose that I am sitting in a chair and that A is the\naction of walking to the fridge. Locke wants to know whether I am free\nwith respect to willing the action of walking to the fridge.\nMost commentators think that Locke\u2019s answer to this question\nis NO. The main evidence for this interpretation is what Locke says\nabout the question immediately after raising it:\nThis Question carries the absurdity of it so\nmanifestly in it self, that one might thereby sufficiently be\nconvinced, that Liberty concerns not the Will. (E5 II.xxi.25: 247)\nIt is tempting to suppose that the thought that \u201cLiberty\nconcerns not the Will\u201d is the thought that agents are not free\nto will, and that Locke is saying that we are driven to this thought\nbecause the second question is absurd, in the sense of demanding a\nnegative answer.\nBut it is difficult to make sense of what Locke goes on to say in\nII.xxi.25 if he is interpreted as answering the second question\nnegatively. Section 25 continues:\nFor to ask, whether a Man be at liberty to\nwill either Motion, or Rest; Speaking, or Silence; which he pleases,\nis to ask, whether a Man can will, what he wills; or\nbe pleased with what he is pleased with. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247)\nLocke says that the second question reduces to another that can be\nput in two different ways: whether a man can will what he wills, and\nwhether a man can be pleased with what pleases him. (The reason it can\nbe put in these two different ways, at least in E1, is that Locke\nthere adopts a desiderative theory of willing, according to which\nwilling an action is a matter of being more pleased with the action\nthan with its forbearance.) But asking whether a man can will what he\nwills, or whether a man can be pleased with what he is pleased with,\nis similar to asking whether a man can steal what he steals. And the\nanswer to all of these questions is: \u201cOF COURSE!\u201d\nIt is obvious that whatever it is that a\nman actually steals he can steal. Similarly, it\nis obvious that whatever it is that a man actually\nwills (or is actually pleased with) is something that he can\nwill (or can be pleased with). The reason is that it is a\nself-evident maxim (just as self-evident as the maxim that whatever\nis, is\u2014see E1\u20135 IV.vii.4: 592\u2013594) that whatever is actual\nis possible. Locke, it seems, wishes to answer the second question in\nthe affirmative! \nThis raises the issue of what Locke could possibly mean, then, when\nhe describes the second question as \u201cabsurd\u201d. One\npossibility is that, for Locke, a question counts as absurd not only\nwhen the answer to it is obviously in the negative (think:\n\u201cIs the will free?\u201d), but also when the answer to it\nis obviously in the affirmative (think: \u201cIs it possible\nfor you to do what you are actually doing?\u201d). But it also raises\nthe issue of why Locke would think that the second question actually\nreduces to an absurd question of the latter sort. One possible\nsolution derives from Locke\u2019s theory of freedom of action.  As\nwe have seen, Locke thinks that one is free with respect to\naction A if and only if (i) if one (actually) wills to\ndo A, then one can do A, and (ii) if one (actually)\nwills not to do A, then one can avoid doing A. Applying\nthis theory directly to the case in which A is the action\nof willing to do B, we arrive at the following: one is\nfree with respect to willing to do B if and only if (i) if one\n(actually) wills to will to do B, then one can will to\ndo B, and (ii) if one (actually) wills to avoid willing to\ndo B, then one can avoid willing to do B. Suppose, then,\nthat willing to will to do an action is just willing to do that\naction, and willing to avoid willing to do an action is just not\nwilling to do that action. In that case, one is free with respect to\nwilling to do B if and only if (i) if one (actually) wills to\ndo B, then one can will to do B, and (ii) if one\n(actually) avoids willing to do B, then one can avoid willing\nto do B. Given that actuality obviously entails possibility, it\nfollows that (i) and (ii) are both obviously true. This is one\nexplanation for why Locke might think that the question of whether one\nis free with respect to willing to do B reduces to an absurd\nquestion, the answer to which is obviously in the affirmative. It may\nbe for this reason that Locke says that the question is one that\n\u201cneeds no answer\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247).\nLocke goes on to say, at the end of II.xxi.25, that\nthey, who can make a Question of it [i.e., of\nthe second question], must suppose one Will to determine the Acts of\nanother, and another to determinate that; and so on in\ninfinitum. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247)\nIt is unclear what Locke means by this. One possibility, consistent\nwith the majority interpretation that Locke provides a negative answer\nto the second question, is that Locke is providing an argument here\nfor the claim that the proposition that it is possible to be free with\nrespect to willing to do an action leads to a vicious infinite regress\nof wills. The thought here is that being free with respect to willing\nto do an action, on Locke\u2019s theory, requires being able to will\nto do an action if one wills to will to do it; that being free with\nrespect to willing to will to do an action then requires being able to\nwill to will to do it if one wills to will to will to do it; and so\non, ad infinitum. But another possible interpretation,\nconsistent with the minority interpretation that Locke provides an\naffirmative answer to the second question, is that Locke\u2019s\nargument here is not meant to target those who answer the question\naffirmatively, but is rather designed to target those who would\n\u201cmake a question\u201d of the second question, i.e., those who\nthink that the answer to the second question is unobvious,\nand worth disputing. These people are the ones who think that willing\nto will to do A does not reduce to willing to do A, and\nthat willing to avoid willing to do A does not reduce to\navoiding willing to do A. These are the people who are\ncommitted to the existence of an infinite regress of wills, each\ndetermining the volitions of its successor. According to Locke, who\naccepts the reductions, the infinite regress of wills can\u2019t get\nstarted (see Rickless 2000: 56\u201365; Garrett 2015:\n269\u2013274).\n8. Determination of the Will\nThe next important question for Locke is \u201cwhat is it\ndetermines the Will\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249\u2014the question is\nalso raised in the same Section in E1). Locke gives one answer to this\nquestion in E1, and a completely different answer in E2\u20135.  The E1\nanswer is that the will is always determined by \u201cthe greater\nGood\u201d (E1 II.xxi.29: 251), though, when he is writing more\ncarefully, Locke says that it is only \u201cthe appearance of Good,\ngreater Good\u201d that determines the will (E1 II.xxi.33: 256, E1\nII.xxi.38: 270). Regarding the good, Locke is a hedonist:\nGood and Evil\u2026are nothing but Pleasure\nand Pain, or that which occasions, or procures Pleasure or Pain to\nus. (E1\u20135 II.xxviii.5: 351\u2014see also E1\u20135 II.xx.2: 229 and E2\u20135\nII.xxi.42: 259)\nSo Locke\u2019s E1 view is that the will is determined by what\nappears to us to promise pleasure and avoid pain.\nWhen in 1692 Locke asks his friend, William Molyneux, to comment on\nthe first (1690) edition of the Essay, Molyneux expressly\nworries that Locke\u2019s E1 account of freedom appears to\n\u201cmake all Sins to proceed from our Understandings, or to be\nagainst Conscience; and not at all from the Depravity of our\nWills\u201d, and that \u201cit seems harsh to say, that a Man shall\nbe Damn\u2019d, because he understands no better than he does\u201d\n(de Beer 1979: 601).  Molyneux\u2019s point is well taken, and Locke\nacknowledges as much in his reply (de Beer 1979: 625). The source of\nthe problem for the E1 account is that, with respect to the good (at\nleast in the future), appearance does not always correspond with\nreality: it is possible for us to make mistakes about what is apt to\nproduce the greatest pleasure and the least pain. Sometimes this is\nbecause we underestimate how pleasurable future pleasures will be\n(relative to present pleasures) or overestimate how painful present\npains are (relative to future pains); and sometimes this is because we\njust make simple mistakes of fact, thinking, for example, that\nbloodletting will ease the pain of gout. As Molyneux sees it, we are\nnot responsible for many of these mistakes, and yet it seems clear\nthat we deserve (divine) punishment for making the wrong choices in\nour lives (e.g., when we choose the present pleasures of debauchery\nand villainy over the pleasures of heaven). Our sins, in other words,\nshould be understood to proceed from the defective exercise of our\nwills, rather than from the defective state of our knowledge.\nPart of Locke\u2019s answer in E2\u20135 is that what determines the\nwill is not the appearance of greater good, but rather \u201calways\nsome uneasiness\u201d (E2\u20134 II.xxi.29: 249\u2014the word\n\u201cuneasiness\u201d is italicized in E5).\n\u201cUneasiness\u201d is Locke\u2019s word for \u201c[a]ll pain\nof the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.31: 251). On this view, then, our wills are determined by pains\n(of the mind or of the body). How this answer is supposed to address\nMolyneux\u2019s concern is not, as yet, entirely clear.\nWhat, to begin, does Locke mean by \u201cdetermination\u201d?  On\na \u201ccausal\u201d reading, for a will W to be determined\nby X is for X to cause W to be exercised in a\nparticular way. One might say, for example, that fear of the tiger\ncaused Bill to choose to run away from it, and, in one sense, that\nBill\u2019s volition to run away from the tiger was determined by his\nfear of it. On a \u201cteleological\u201d reading, for a\nwill W to be determined by X is for the agent to will\nthe achievement or avoidance of X as a goal. One might say, for\nexample, that the pleasure of eating the cake determined my will in\nthe sense of fixing the content of my volition (as the volition to\nacquire the pleasure of eating the cake) (see Stuart 2013: 439;\nLoLordo 2012: 55\u201356).\nIt would be anachronistic to suppose that Locke is using the word\n\u201cdetermine\u201d as we do today when we discuss causal\ndeterminism (see the entry on \n  causal determinism). And the desire\nto avoid anachronism might lead us to adopt the teleological\ninterpretation of determination. But there are many indications in\nE2\u20135 II.xxi that Locke has something approaching the causal\ninterpretation in mind. Locke\u2019s picture of bodies, both large\nand small, is largely a mechanistic one (though he allows for\nphenomena that can\u2019t be explained mechanistically, such as\ngravitation, cohesion of body parts, and magnetism): bodies, he\nwrites, \u201cknock, impell, and resist one another,\u2026and that\nis all they can do\u201d (E1\u20135 IV.x.10: 624). And there are\nindications that this mechanistic model of corporeal behavior affects\nLocke\u2019s model of mental phenomena. Throughout the Sections of\nII.xxi added in E2\u20135, Locke talks of uneasiness moving the mind (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135 II.xxi.43\u201344: 260), setting us upon a\nchange of state or action or work (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135\nII.xxi.31: 251; E2\u20135 II.xxi.37: 255; E2\u20135 II.xxi.44: 260), working on\nthe mind (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135 II.xxi.33: 252), exerting pressure\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.32: 251; E2\u20135 II.xxi.45: 262), driving us (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.34: 252; E2\u20135 II.xxi.35: 253), pushing us (E2\u20135 II.xxi.34:\n252), operating on the will, sometimes forcibly (E2\u20135 II.xxi.36: 254;\nE2\u20135 II.xxi.37: 255; E2\u20135 II.xxi.57: 271), laying hold on the will\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.38: 256), influencing the will (E2\u20135 II.xxi.38: 256; E2\u20135\nII.xxi.39: 257), taking the will (E2\u20135 II.xxi.45: 262), spurring to\naction (E2\u20135 II.xxi.40: 258), carrying us into action (E2\u20135 II.xxi.53:\n268), and being counterbalanced by other mental states (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.57: 272; E2\u20135 II.xxi.65: 277). It is difficult to read all of\nthese statements without thinking that Locke thinks of uneasiness as\nexerting not merely a pull, but also a push, on the mind.\nLocke\u2019s view, then, seems to be that our volitions are caused\n(though not, perhaps, deterministically, i.e., in a way that is fixed\nby initial conditions and the laws of nature) by uneasinesses.  How is\nthis supposed to work? As Locke sees it, either \u201call pain causes\ndesire equal to it self\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.31: 251) or desire is\nsimply identified with \u201cuneasiness in the want [i.e.,\nlack] of an absent good\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.31: 251). So the desire\nthat either is or is caused by uneasiness is a desire for the removal\nof that uneasiness, and this is what proximately spurs us to take\nmeans to secure that removal.\nLocke provides evidence from observation and from \u201cthe reason\nof the thing\u201d for the claim that it is uneasiness, rather than\nperceived good, that determines the will. Empirically, Locke notes\nthat agents generally do not seek a change of state unless they\nexperience some sort of pain that leads them to will its extinction. A\npoor, indolent man who is content with his lot, even one who\nrecognizes that he would be happier if he worked his way to greater\nwealth, is not ipso facto motivated to work.  A drunkard who\nrecognizes that his health will suffer and wealth will dissipate if he\ncontinues to drink does not, merely as a result of this recognition,\nstop drinking: but if he finds himself thirsty for drink and uneasy at\nthe thought of missing his drinking companions, then he will go to the\ntavern. That is, Locke recognizes the possibility of akratic action,\ni.e., pursuing the worse in full knowledge that it is worse (E\nII.xxi.35: 253\u2013254).  (For more on Locke on akrasia, see Vailati\n1990, Glauser 2014, and Moauro and Rickless 2019.)\nRegarding \u201cthe reason of the thing\u201d, Locke claims that\n\u201cwe constantly desire happiness\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.39: 257),\nwhere happiness is \u201cthe utmost Pleasure we are capable of\u201d\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.42: 258). Moreover, he says, any amount of uneasiness is\ninconsistent with happiness, \u201ca little pain serving to marr all\nthe pleasure\u201d we experience. Locke concludes from this that we\nare always motivated to get rid of pain before securing any particular\npleasure (E2\u20135 II.xxi.36: 254). Locke also argues that absent goods\ncannot move the will, because they don\u2019t exist yet; by contrast,\non his theory, the will is determined by something that already exists\nin the mind, namely uneasiness (E2\u20135 II.xxi.37:\n254\u2013255). Finally, Locke argues that if the will were determined\nby the perceived greater good, every agent would be consistently\nfocused on the attainment of \u201cthe infinite eternal Joys of\nHeaven\u201d. But, as is evidently the case, many agents are far more\nconcerned about other matters than they are about getting into\nheaven. And this entails that the will must be determined by something\nother than the perceived greater good, namely, uneasiness (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.38: 255\u2013256). (For interesting criticisms of these\narguments, see Stuart 2013: 453\u2013456.)\nSo far, Locke has argued that the wrong turns we make in life do\nnot usually proceed from defects in our understandings. What spurs us\nto act or forbear acting is not perception of the greater good, but\nsome uneasiness instead. This answers part, but not the whole, of\nMolyneux\u2019s worry. What Locke still needs to explain is why\nagents can be justly held responsible for choices that are motivated\nby uneasinesses. After all, what level of pain we feel and when we\nfeel it is oftentimes not within our control. Locke\u2019s answer\nrelies on what has come to be known as the \u201cdoctrine of\nsuspension\u201d.\n9. The Doctrine of Suspension\nHaving argued that uneasiness, rather than perception of the\ngreater good, is what determines the will, Locke turns to the question\nof which of all the uneasinesses that beset us \u201chas the\nprecedency in determining the will to the next\naction\u201d. His answer:\nthat ordinarily, which is the most pressing of\nthose [uneasinesses], that are judged capable of being then\nremoved. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.40: 257)\nLocke therefore assumes that uneasinesses can be ranked in order of\nintensity or strength, and that among all the uneasinesses importuning\nan agent, the one that ordinarily determines her will is the one that\nexerts the greatest pressure on her mind.  The picture with which\nLocke appears to be working is of a mind that is the playground of\nvarious forces of varying strengths exerting different degrees of\ninfluence on the will, where the will is determined by the strongest\nof those forces.\nNotice, however, Locke\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cordinarily\u201d. Sometimes, as Locke emphasizes, the will\nis not determined by the most pressing uneasiness:\nFor the mind having in most cases, as is\nevident in Experience, a power to suspend the execution and\nsatisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is\nat liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides,\nand weigh them with others. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.47: 263)\nThis is the doctrine of suspension. On this view, we agents have\nthe \u201cpower to suspend any particular desire, and keep it from\ndetermining the will, and engaging us in action\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.50: 266). As Locke makes clear, this power to prevent the\nwill\u2019s determination, that is, this power to avoid willing, is\nabsent when the action proposed is to be done presently and involves\nthe continuation or stopping of a process in which one is currently\nengaged (see Section 6 above). But when it\ncomes to \u201cchusing a remote [i.e., future] Good as an end to be\npursued\u201d, agents are \u201cat Liberty in respect\nof willing\u201d (E5 II.xxi.56:\n270).[7]\nSome commentators (e.g., Chappell 1994: 118) think that, at least\nin E5, Locke comes to see that the doctrine of suspension conflicts\nwith his answer to the question of whether we are free to will what we\nwill (raised in II.xxi.25). This is because they take Locke\u2019s\nanswer to the latter question to be negative, and take the doctrine of\nsuspension to entail a positive answer to the same question, at least\nwith respect to some actions. But there are good reasons to think that\nthere is no inconsistency here: for Locke\u2019s answer to the\nII.xxi.25 question is arguably in the affirmative\n(see Section 7\nabove).[8]\nCommentators also wonder whether the doctrine of suspension\nintroduces an account of freedom that differs from Locke\u2019s\nofficial account, both in E1 and in E2\u20135. The problem is that Locke\nsays that \u201cin [the power to suspend the prosecution of\none\u2019s desires] lies the liberty Man has\u201d, that the power\nto suspend is \u201cthe source of all liberty\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.47:\n263), that it is \u201cthe hinge on which turns the liberty\nof intellectual Beings\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52: 266), and that it is\n\u201cthe great inlet, and exercise of all the liberty Men\nhave, are capable of, or can be useful to them\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52:\n267). These passages suggest that Locke takes freedom to be\n(something intimately related to) the power to suspend our desires, a\npower that cannot simply be identified with the two-way power\nthat Locke identifies with freedom of action at II.xxi.8 ff. (see\nYaffe 2000: 12\u201374).\nBut there is a simple interpretation of these passages that does\nnot require us to read Locke as offering a different account of\nfreedom as the ability to suspend. The power to suspend is the power\nto keep one\u2019s will from being determined, that is, the power to\nforbear willing to do A if one wills to forbear willing to\ndo A. This is just one part of the freedom to will to\ndo A, according to Locke\u2019s definition of freedom of\naction applied to the action of willing to do A. (The other\npart is the power to will to do A if one wills to will to\ndo A.) Thus if, as Locke seems to argue in II.xxi.23\u201324,\nwe are (except under very unusual circumstances) free with respect to\nthe act of willing with respect to a future course of action, then it\nfollows immediately that we have the power to suspend. Locke\u2019s\nclaims about the power to suspend being the source of all liberty and\nthe hinge on which liberty turns can be understood as claims that the\npower to suspend is a particularly important aspect of freedom of\naction as applied to the action of willing. What makes it important is\nthe fact that it is the misuse of this freedom that accounts for our\nresponsibility for actions that conduce to our own unhappiness or\nmisery.\nHow so? Locke claims that the power of suspension was given to us\n(by God) for a reason, so that we might \u201cexamine, view, and\njudge, of the good or evil of what we are going to do\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.47: 263) in order to discover\nwhether that particular thing, which is then proposed,\nor desired, lie in the way to [our] main end, and make a real part of\nthat which is [our] greatest good. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52:\n267)\nWhen we make the kinds of mistakes for which we deserve punishment,\nsuch as falling into gluttony or envy or selfishness, it is not\nbecause we have, after deliberation and investigation, perhaps through\nno fault of our own, acquired a mistaken view of the facts; it is\nbecause we engage in \u201ca too hasty compliance with our\ndesires\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.53: 268) and fail to \u201chinder blind\nPrecipitancy\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.67: 279).  What matters is not that\nwe have failed to will the forbearing to will to go to the movies or\nclean the fridge. What matters is that we have failed to will the\nforbearing to prosecute our most pressing desires, allowing ourselves\nto be guided by uneasinesses that might, for all we know, lead us to\nevil. If we have the power to suspend the prosecution of our desires\n(including our most pressing desire), then we misuse it when we do not\nexercise it (or when we fail to exercise it when its exercise is\ncalled for). So, not only is Locke\u2019s doctrine of suspension\nconsistent with his account of the freedom to will, it also provides\npart of the answer to Molyneux\u2019s worry:\nAnd here we may see how it comes to pass, that\na Man may justly incur punishment\u2026: Because, by a too hasty\nchoice of his own making, he has imposed on himself wrong measures of\ngood and evil\u2026He has vitiated his own Palate, and must be\nanswerable to himself for the sickness and death that follows from\nit. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.56: \n 270\u2013271)[9]\n10. Compatibilism or Incompatibilism?\nCompatibilism is the thesis that free will is compatible with\ncausal determinism, and incompatibilism is the thesis that free will\nis incompatible with causal determinism. Is Locke a compatibilist or\nan incompatibilist?\nThe fact that Locke thinks that freedom of action is compatible\nwith the will\u2019s being determined by uneasiness might immediately\nsuggest that Locke is a compatibilist. But, as we have seen\n(Section 8 above), it is illegitimate to infer\ncompatibility with causal determinism from compatibility with\ndetermination of the will by uneasiness. Still, the evidence strongly\nsuggests that Locke would have embraced compatibilism, if the issue\nhad been put to him directly. Freedom of action, on Locke\u2019s\naccount, is a matter of being able to do what one wills and being able\nto forbear what one wills to forbear. Although we sometimes act under\nnecessity (compulsion or restraint\u2014E1\u20135 II.xxi.13: 240), the\nmere fact (if it is a fact) that our actions are determined by the\nlaws of nature and antecedent events does not threaten our freedom\nwith respect to their performance. As Locke makes clear, if the door\nto my room is unlocked, I am free with respect to the act of leaving\nthe room, because I have the ability to stay or leave as I will. It is\nonly when the door is locked, or when I am chained, or when my path is\nblocked, or something else deprives me of the ability to stay or\nleave, that I am unfree with respect to the act of leaving.\nDeterminism by itself represents no threat to our freedom of\naction. In this respect, Locke is a forerunner of many other\ncompatibilist theories of freedom, including, for example, those of\nG.E. Moore (1912) and A.J. Ayer (1954).
