    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || GSM and Approach to Equilibrium\n6.3 GSM and Approach to Equilibrium\n\nAs discussed so far, GSM is an equilibrium theory, and this is also\nhow it is mostly used in applications. Nevertheless, a comprehensive\ntheory of SM must also account for the approach to equilibrium. To\ndiscuss the approach to equilibrium, it is common to introduce the\nGibbs entropy \n\\[S_{G} = - k\\int_{X} \\rho(x)\\log\\lbrack\\rho(x)\\rbrack dx.\\]\n\n\nThe Gibbs entropy is a property of an ensemble characterised by a\ndistribution \\(\\rho\\). One might then try to characterise the approach\nto equilibrium as a process in which \\(S_{G}\\) increases monotonically\nto finally reach a maximum in equilibrium. But this idea is undercut\nimmediately by a mathematical theorem saying that \\(S_{G}\\) is a\nconstant of motion: \n\\[{S_{G}\\lbrack\\rho}_{t}(x)\\rbrack = S_{G}\\lbrack\\rho_{0}(x)\\rbrack\\]\n\n\nfor all times \\(t\\). So not only does \\(S_{G}\\) fail to increase\nmonotonically; it does not change at all! This precludes a\ncharacterisation of the approach to equilibrium in terms of increasing\nGibbs entropy. Hence, either such a characterisation has to be\nabandoned, or the formalism has to be modified to allow \\(S_{G}\\) to\nincrease.\n\nA second problem is a consequence of the Gibbsian definition of\nstatistical equilibrium. As we have seen in\n \u00a76.1,\n a system is in statistical equilibrium if \\(\\rho\\) is stationary. A\nsystem away from equilibrium would then have to be associated with a\nnon-stationary distribution and eventually evolve into the stationary\nequilibrium distribution. But this is mathematically impossible. It is\na consequence of the theory\u2019s formalism of GSM that a\ndistribution that is stationary at some point in time has to be\nstationary at all times (past and future), and that a distribution\nthat is non-stationary at some point in time will always be\nnon-stationary. So an ensemble cannot evolve from non-stationary\ndistribution to stationary distribution. This requires either a change\nin the definition of equilibrium, or a change in the formalism that\nwould allow distributions to change in requisite way.\n\nIn what follows we discuss the main attempts to address these\nproblems. For alternative approaches that we cannot cover here see\nFrigg (2008b: 166\u201368) and references therein.\n",
