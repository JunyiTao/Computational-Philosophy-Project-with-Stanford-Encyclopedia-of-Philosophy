    "main_text": "Philosophical Challenges to Theory Theory || Pluralism\n4.4 Pluralism\n\nUp until the 2000s, it was the received view that FP abilities were\nbased, wholly or primarily, in mindreading abilities and that such\nabilities were assumed to be best explained by TT, ST, or some hybrid\ncombination. That orthodoxy has been challenged by pluralists about FP\nwho maintain that we engage in FP for many purposes other than\nprediction and explanation. For example, it has been proposed that FP\nenables us to coordinate, justify and regulate our actions and\nbehavior. FP pluralists maintain that we achieve these diverse ends by\ndiverse means and methods (Berm\u00fadez 2003; Slors & MacDonald\n2008; Andrews 2008, 2012; Fiebich, Gallagher, & Hutto 2016;\nAndrews, Spaulding, & Westra forthcoming).\n\nA signature pluralist assumption is that the extension of FP is wider\nthan traditionally supposed, encompassing anything we do when\nunderstanding minds and navigating everyday interpersonal relations\n(see Hornsby 1996; Spaulding 2018b). According to FP pluralists, there\nare many ways that we keep track of and think about minds\u2014our\nmethods for doing so are not exclusively restricted to attributing\nmental states but include being sensitive to a range of factors\nincluding socio-cultural situational norms, conventions, stereotypes,\nimplicit biases, and person-specific character traits. How we think\nabout minds on any given occasion, pluralists claim, varies as a\nfunction of context and our shifting FP goals.\n\nSome variants of FP pluralism are perfectly compatible with TT. They\nassume that the use of ToM lies at the core of FP understanding and\nthat a ToM interacts with and is informed by other kinds of\ninformation concerning the aforementioned range of socio-cognitive\nfactors (Spaulding 2018a, 2018b; Westra 2018, 2019, 2020).\n\nOther versions of FP pluralism do not give TT pride of place as\nFP\u2019s primary or default function. Some variants place TT\npredictions and explanations on equal footing with other FP methods\nand goals. FP pluralism of this kind assumes that FP has no single\nprimary function or method. Rather FP uses various means to achieve\nmultiple ends\u2014such as, making and justifying moral judgments,\nfostering social bonding, molding, and regulating behavior.\n\nYet other versions of FP pluralism directly threaten TT by assuming FP\nhas a primary function and basis that is non-theoretical. Such\naccounts reject TT by holding that FP\u2019s primary function is not\nthat of making third-personal predictions and explanations about\nminds. For example, it has been proposed that FP\u2019s primary work\nis to achieve regulative mind-shaping by means of imitation, pedagogy,\nand other social conformity mechanisms. So understood, the main work\nof FP is that of normatively molding, not descriptively reading, minds\n(McGeer 2007, 2015, forthcoming; Zawidzki 2008, 2013; Castro 2020). It\nis assumed that as a result of such mindshaping minds become more\npredictable, enabling\u2014amongst other things\u2014successful\ncooperation and the successful predicting and explaining of minds by\nattributing contents to them. Importantly, on these mindshaping\naccounts, anything we might call theorizing about minds is a parasitic\nand peripheral capacity that only comes into play in special\ncontexts.\n",
