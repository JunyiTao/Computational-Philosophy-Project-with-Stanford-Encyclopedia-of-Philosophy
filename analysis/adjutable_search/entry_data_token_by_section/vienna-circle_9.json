This criterion was explicitly\ntheory-relative. Roughly, Carnap first defined the concept of the\n\u201crelative significance\u201d of a theoretical term. A term is\nrelatively significant if and only if there exists a statement in the\ntheoretical language that contains it as the only non-logical term and\nfrom which, in conjunction with another theoretical statement and the\nsets of theoretical postulates and correspondence rules, an\nobservational statement is derivable that is not derivable from that\nother theoretical statement and the sets of theoretical postulates and\ncorrespondence rules alone. Then Carnap defined the\n\u201csignificance\u201d of a theoretical term in terms of it\nbelonging to a sequence of such terms such that each is relatively\nsignificant to the class of those terms that precede it in the\nsequence. Now those theoretical statements were legitimate and\ncognitively significant that were well-formed and whose descriptive\nconstants were significant the sense just specified. It is clear that\nby the stepwise introduction of theoretical terms as specified, Carnap\nsought to avoid the deleterious situations that rendered Ayer\u2019s\ncriterion false (and his own of 1928). Nevertheless, this proposal too\nwas subjected to criticism (e.g., Rozeboom 1960, Kaplan 1975a). A\ncommon impression amongst philosophers appears to be that this\ncriterion failed as well, but this judgement is by no means\nuniversally shared (for the majority view see Glymour 1980, for a\ncontrary assessment see Sarkar 2001). Thus it has been argued that\nsubject to some further refinements, Carnap\u2019s proposal can be\nmade to work (see for discussion Creath 1976, Justus 2014, Lutz 2017)\u2014as long as the sharp\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms can be\nsustained. (In light of the objections to the latter distinction one\nwants to add: or by a dichotomy of terms functionally equivalent to\nit.)\n\nCarnap\u2019s own position on his 1956 criterion appears somewhat\nambiguous. While he is reported to have accepted one set of criticisms\n(Kaplan 1975b), he also asserted even after they had been put to him\nthat he thought his 1956 criterion remained adequate (1963b,\n\u00a724b). Yet Carnap there also advised investigation of\nwhether still another, then entirely new approach to theoretical terms\nthat he was developing would allow for an improved criterion of significance\nfor them. So when Carnap offered \u201cthe Ramsey method\u201d as a\nmethod of characterizing the \u201cempirical meaning of theoretical\nterms\u201d it was not their empirical significance as such but the\nspecific empirical import of theoretical terms that he considered\n(1966, Ch. 26). What prompted him to undertake his investigations of\nramseyfications was not dissatisfaction with his 1956 proposal as a\ncriterion of significance for theoretical terms, but the fact that it still proved\nimpossible with this model to draw the distinction between synthetic and analytic\nstatements in the theoretical language. The reason for this was that\nthe postulates for the theoretical language also specify factual\nrelations between phenomena that fall under the concepts that are\nimplicitly defined by them. (As noted, a similar problem already had\nplagued Carnap\u2019s analyses of disposition terms ever since he\nallowed for non-eliminative reduction chains.)\n\nCarnap\u2019s attempt to address this problem by ramseyfication was\npublished in several places from 1958 onwards. (See Carnap 1958, 1963,\n\u00a724C-D and the popular exposition 1966, Chs. 26 and 28; compare\nRamsey 1929 and see Psillos 1999, Ch.3. This proposal and a variant of\nit (1961b) were both presented in his 1959 Santa Barbara lecture\n(published in Psillos 2000a); as it happened, Kaplan presented his\ncriticism (1975a) of Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion at the same\nconference.) With ramseyfication Carnap adverted again to entire\ntheories as the unit of assessment. Ramseyfication consists in the\nreplacement of the theoretical terms of a finitely axiomatized theory\nby bound higher-order variables. This involves combining all the\ntheoretical postulates which define theoretical terms (call this\nconjunction T) and correspondence rules of a theory which\nlink some of these theoretical terms with observational ones (call\nthis C) in one long sentence (call this TC) and then\nreplacing all the theoretical predicates that occur in it by bound\nhigher-order variables (call this RTC). This is\nthe so-called Ramsey-sentence of the entire theory; in it no\ntheoretical terms appear, but it possesses the same explanatory and\npredictive power as the original theory: it has the same observational\nconsequences. However, Carnap stressed that the Ramsey sentence cannot\nbe said to be expressed in a \u201csimple\u201d but only an\n\u201cextended\u201d observational language, for due to its\nhigher-order quantificational apparatus it includes \u201can advanced\ncomplicated logic embracing virtually the whole of mathematics\u201d\n(1966, [1996, 253]).\n\nTo distinguish between analytic and synthetic statements in the\ntheoretical language Carnap made the following proposal. Let the\nRamsey sentence of the conjunction of all theoretical postulates and\nthe conjunction of all correspondence rules of that theory be\nconsidered as expressing the entire factual, synthetic content of the\nscientific theory and its terms in their entirety. By contrast, the\nstatement \u201cRTC \u2192 TC\u201d\nexpressed the purely analytic component of the theory, its\n\u201cA-postulate\u201d (or so-called Carnap sentence). This\n\u201cA-postulate states that if entities exist (referred to by the\nexistential quantifiers of the Ramsey sentence) that are of a kind\nbound together by all the relations expressed in the theoretical\npostulates of the theory and that are related to observational\nentities by all the relations specified by the correspondence\npostulates of the theory, then the theory itself is true.\u201d Or\ndifferently put, the A-postulate \u201csays only that if the world is\nthis way, then the theoretical terms must be understood as satisfying\nthe theory\u201d (1966 [1996, 271]). With RTC\n\u2192 TC expressing a meaning postulate Carnap\nclaimed to have separated the analytic and synthetic components of a\nscientific theory.\n\nCarnap\u2019s adoption of the Ramsey method met mainly with criticism\n(Psillos 1999, ch.3, 2000b, Demopoulos 2003, 2017), even though\nramseyfications continue to be discussed as a method of characterizing\ntheoretical terms in a realist vein (albeit with conditions not yet\nintroduced by Carnap, as in Lewis 1970, Papineau 1996). With\nCarnap\u2019s ramseyfications, however, we do not get the answer that what exists is the structure that the ramseyfication at hand\nidentifies. Given the absence of a clause requiring unique\nrealizability, ramseyfications counseled modesty: the structure that\nis identified remains indeterminate to just that degree to which\ntheoretical terms remain incompletely interpreted (Carnap 1961b). To\nthis we must add that for Carnap ramseyfications of theoretical terms\ncan support only internal existence claims: he explicitly reaffirmed\nhis confidence in the distinction between internal and external\nquestion to defuse the realism/anti-realism issue (1966 [1996, 256]).\nThis strongly suggests that with these proposals Carnap did not intend\nto deviate from his deflationist approach to ontology.\n\nWhat must be considered, however, is that Carnap\u2019s proposal to\nreconstruct the contribution of theoretical terms by ramseyfication\nfalls foul of arguments deriving from M.H.A. Newman\u2019s objection\nto Russell\u2019s structuralism in Analysis of Matter (see\nDemopoulos and Friedman 1985). This objection says that once they are\nempirically adequate, ramseyfied theories are trivially true, given\nthe nature of their reconstruction of original theories. Russell held\nthat \u201cnothing but the structure of the external world is\nknown\u201d. But if nothing is known about the generating relation\nthat produces the structure, then the claim that there exists such a\nstructure is vacuous, Newman claimed. \u201cAny collection of things\ncan be organised so as to have the structure W, provided\nthere are the right number of them.\u201d (Newman 1928, 144) To see\nhow this so-called cardinality constraint applies to ramseyfications\nof theories, note that in Carnap\u2019s hands, the non-observational\npart of reconstructed theories, their theoretical entities, were\nrepresented by \u201cpurely logico-mathematical entities, e.g.\nnatural numbers, classes of such, classes of classes, etc.\u201d For\nhim the Ramsey sentence asserted that \u201cobservable events in the\nworld are such that there are numbers, classes of such, etc., which\nare correlated with events in a prescribed way and which have among\nthemselves certain relations\u201d, this being \u201cclearly a\nfactual statement about the world\u201d (Carnap 1963b, 963). Carnap\nhere had mathematical physics in mind where space-time points are\nrepresented by quadruples of real numbers and physical properties like\nelectrical charge-density or mass-density are represented as functions\nof such quadruples of real numbers.\n\nThe problem that arises from this for Carnap is not the\nfailure to single out the intended interpretation of the theory: as\nnoted, Carnap clearly thought it an advantage of the method that it\nremained suitably indeterminate. The problem for Carnap is rather\nthat, subject to its empirical adequacy, the truth conditions of the\nRamsey-sentences are fulfilled trivially on logico-mathematical\ngrounds alone. As he stated, Ramsey-sentences demand that there be a\nstructure of entities that is correlated with observable events in the\nway described. Yet given the amount of mathematics that went into the\nramseyfied theory\u2014\u201cvirtually the whole of\nmathematics\u201d\u2014some such structure as demanded by the\nRamsey-sentence is bound to be found among those entities presupposed\nby its representational apparatus. (Here the cardinality constraint is no\nconstraint at all.) That any theory is trivially true for purely\nformal reasons (as long as it is empirically adequate) therefore is held against\nCarnap\u2019s proposal to use Ramsey sentences as reconstructions of\nthe synthetic content of the theoretical part of empirical scientific\ntheories. Given that with ramseyfications \u201cthe truth of physical\ntheory reduces to the truth of its observational consequences\u201d\n(Demopoulos and Friedman 1985, 635), this is a problem for\nCarnap\u2019s project on its own terms: any surplus empirical meaning\nof theoretical terms that Carnap sought to capture simply evaporates\n(Demopoulos 2003).\n\nThis result casts its shadow over Carnap\u2019s last treatment of\ntheoretical terms in its entirety and threatens further consequences.\nIf the reconstruction of empirical theories by ramseyfication in\nCarnap\u2019s fashion is unacceptable, then all explications that\nbuild on this are called into question: explications of theoretical\nanalyticity as much as explications of the experiential import of\ntheories. If no justice has been done to the experiential\nimport of theoretical terms, then one must ask whether\nthe analytic components of a theoretical language have been correctly\nidentified. If they have not, then the meta-theoretical utility of the\nsynthetic/analytic distinction is once again be called into\nquestion.\n\nOne is lead to wonder whether Carnap would not be well advised to\nreturn to his 1956 position. This allowed for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance for theoretical terms but not for the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction to be sustained with regard to the theoretical language.\nAccording to Carnap\u2019s fall-back position before he hit upon\nramseyfication, it was thought possible to distinguish narrow logical\ntruth from factual truth in the theoretical language (1966, Ch. 28).\nYet it is difficult to silence the suspicion that an\nanalytic/synthetic distinction that applies only to observational\nlanguages\u2014and admits inescapable semantical holism for\ntheoretical languages\u2014is not what the debate between Carnap and\nQuine was all about. Attempts have thus been undertaken\nto provide interpretations of Carnap\u2019s\nramseyfications that contain or mitigate the effects of the Newman\nobjection (Friedman 2008, 2011, Uebel 2011b, Creath 2012). What has become clear, in any case,\nis that much is at stake for Carnap\u2019s formal explicationism,\nindeed for the standard logical empiricist model of scientific\ntheories (see below).\n",
