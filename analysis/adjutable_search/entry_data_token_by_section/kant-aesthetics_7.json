    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Art, Genius and Aesthetic Ideas\n2.6 Art, Genius and Aesthetic Ideas\n\nWhile Kant attaches special importance to the beauty of nature (see,\ne.g., FI XI, 20:244), he also makes clear that judgments of beauty may\nbe made also about \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\u201d art\n[sch\u00f6ne Kunst]. In the course of his treatment of\nbeautiful art in \u00a7\u00a743\u201354 he discusses fine art in\nrelation to the production of human artifacts more generally\n(\u00a743), compares fine art to the \u201carts\u201d of\nentertaining (telling jokes, decorating a table, providing background\nmusic) (\u00a744), and makes some remarks about the relation between\nthe beauty of art and that of nature, claiming in particular that fine\nart must \u201clook to us like nature\u201d in that it must seem\nfree and unstudied (\u00a745). Kant also offers a typology of the\nvarious fine arts (\u00a751) and a comparison of their respective\naesthetic value (\u00a753), with poetry at the top and music\u2014at\nleast as far as the \u201ccultivation of the mind\u201d is\nconcerned\u2014at the bottom. Kant\u2019s remarks about music in\n\u00a7\u00a751\u201354 suggest that music might not even qualify as\nbeautiful, as opposed to merely agreeable, art. This is seemingly in\ntension with Kant\u2019s reference to music without words as an\nexample of \u201cfree beauty\u201d (\u00a716, 5:229).\n\nOf particular interest, within Kant\u2019s account of fine art, is\nhis discussion of how beautiful art objects can be produced\n(\u00a7\u00a746\u201350). The artist cannot produce a beautiful work\nby learning, and then applying, rules which determine when something\nis beautiful; for no such rules can be specified (see the sketch of\nthe Second Moment in\n Section 2.1\n above). But, Kant makes clear, the artist\u2019s activity must still\nbe rule-governed, since \u201cevery art presupposes rules\u201d\n(\u00a746, 307) and the objects of art must serve as models or\nexamples, that is, they must serve as a \u201cstandard or rule by\nwhich to judge\u201d (\u00a746, 308). Kant\u2019s solution to this\napparent paradox is to postulate a capacity, which he calls\n\u201cgenius\u201d, by which \u201cnature gives the rule to\nart\u201d (\u00a746, 307). An artist endowed with genius has a\nnatural capacity to produce objects which are appropriately judged as\nbeautiful, and this capacity does not require the artist him- or\nherself to consciously follow rules for the production of such\nobjects; in fact the artist himself does not know, and so cannot\nexplain, how he or she was able to bring them into being.\n\u201cGenius\u201d here means something different from brilliance of\nintellect. For example, Newton, for all his intellectual power, does\nnot qualify as having genius, because he was capable of making clear,\nboth to himself and others, the procedures through which he arrived at\nhis scientific discoveries (\u00a747, 308\u2013309).\n\nA further point of interest in Kant\u2019s discussion of art is his\nclaim that beauty is the \u201cexhibition\u201d\n[Darstellung, also translated \u201cpresentation\u201d]\n(\u00a749, 314) or \u201cexpression\u201d (\u00a751, 319) of\naesthetic ideas. Kant describes an aesthetic idea as\n\n\na representation of the imagination that occasions much thinking,\nthough without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e.,\nconcept, to be adequate to it. (\u00a749, 314)\n\n\nSuch ideas, he says, are a \u201ccounterpart\u201d to rational\nideas, that is, representations which cannot be exemplified in\nexperience or by means of imagination (ibid.). While part of\nKant\u2019s point here is to contrast aesthetic and rational ideas,\nit is clear that he sees the role of aesthetic ideas as mediating\nbetween rational ideas on the one hand, and sensibility and\nimagination on the other. A work of art expresses or exhibits an\naesthetic idea in so far as it succeeds in giving sensible form to a\nrational idea. Thus aesthetic ideas \u201cseek to approximate to an\nexhibition\u201d of rational ideas. For example, the poet\n\n\nventures to make sensible rational ideas of invisible beings, the\nrealm of the blessed, the realm of hell, eternity, creation etc., as\nwell as to make that of which there are examples in experience, e.g.,\ndeath, envy, and all sorts of vices, as well as love, fame, etc.,\nsensible beyond the limits of experience, with a completeness which\ngoes beyond anything of which there is an example in nature.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nOne question raised in connection with Kant\u2019s account of fine\nart concerns the relative importance, for Kant, of artistic and\nnatural beauty. Guyer (1987) takes Kant to be committed to the primacy\nof natural beauty, and argues that that commitment is defensible;\nKemal (1986) offers grounds for holding that, in spite of appearances,\nit is artistic beauty which is primary for Kant. (The reprint of Guyer\n1987 as ch. 7 of Guyer 1993 includes a postscript challenging\nKemal\u2019s arguments.) Other commentators who have argued for the\nprimacy of artistic over natural beauty include Rueger (2007) and\nOstaric (2010). Friedlander (2015: ch. 3) maintains that neither has\nprimacy over the other. Another question is whether Kant has a single\naccount of beauty which is intended to apply to both natural objects\nand works of art; Reiter and Geiger (2018) and Halper (2020) argue,\nalthough on different grounds, that Kant has two different accounts\nfor nature and art respectively.\n\nCommentators have also discussed Kant\u2019s ranking of the fine\narts, and particularly of the low ranking he accords to music; on the\nlatter topic, see for example Weatherston (1996), Parret (1998b), Kivy\n(2009: ch. 2), Tuna (2018), and K\u00fcplen (2021). Kant\u2019s views\non music have sometimes been criticized as incoherent; Matherne (2014)\noffers a explicit defence.\n\nKant\u2019s theory of aesthetic ideas has been regarded by many\ncommentators as peripheral to his aesthetic theory, but a number of\ncommentators have argued that it is necessary in order to make sense\nof the core of Kant\u2019s view of pure judgments of taste; see for\nexample Savile (1987), Rogerson (2004 and 2008), Rueger and Evren\n(2005), Kalar (2006), and Chignell (2007). More recently, the topic of\naesthetic ideas has received considerable attention in its own right.\nOne issue concerns the role of aesthetic ideas in the beauty of\nnature, as opposed to that of art. While aesthetic ideas are discussed\nonly in the sections of the Critique of Judgment which deal\nwith artistic beauty, and not in the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d, which deals with beauty more generally, Kant remarks\nparenthetically that natural as well as artistic beauty is the\nexpression of aesthetic ideas (\u00a751, 321). How are we to conceive\nof the aesthetic ideas expressed by nature? Reiter (2018) and Reiter\nand Geiger (2018) propose an interpretation in terms of the notion of\nan \u201caesthetic normal idea\u201d introduced by Kant in the Third\nMoment, at \u00a717, 233, which they relate to a notion of\n\u201cideal form\u201d that was current in art theory at\nKant\u2019s time.\n\nA related issue concerns the scope of aesthetic ideas. Matherne (2013)\nchallenges interpretations on which aesthetic ideas can present or\nexpress only moral or rational concepts, arguing that they can also\npresent empirical concepts and human emotions. Reiter and Geiger\n(2018) also propose expanding the scope of what can be presented in an\naesthetic idea, arguing that, insofar as aesthetic ideas present the\nrational idea of humanity in our person, they show the \u201crange\nand variety of human freedom\u201d. Vaccarino Bremner\n(2021) suggests a different way of broadening the scope of\naesthetic ideas, arguing that they do not just present or express\nconcepts, but call for us to revise them.\n\nTraditionally, Kant\u2019s aesthetics has been seen as most readily\napplicable to art of his time and (because of his apparent formalism)\nto abstract art of the modernist period. Costello (2013) argues for\nthe applicability of Kant\u2019s theory of aesthetics to conceptual\nart. For further recent discussions of the applicability of\nKant\u2019s aesthetics to contemporary art, including conceptual and\npost-conceptual art, see the essays collected in Cazeaux 2021.\n",
