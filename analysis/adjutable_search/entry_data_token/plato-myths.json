For them a\nmuthos was a true story, a story that unveils the true origin\nof the world and human beings. For us a myth is something to be\n\u201cdebunked\u201d: a widespread, popular belief that is in fact\nfalse. In archaic Greece the memorable was transmitted orally through\npoetry, which often relied on myth. However, starting with the\nbeginning of the seventh century BC two types of discourse emerged\nthat were set in opposition to poetry: history (as shaped by, most\nnotably, Thucydides) and philosophy (as shaped by the peri\nphuse\u014ds tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries BC).\nThese two types of discourse were naturalistic alternatives to the\npoetic accounts of things. Plato broke to some extent from the\nphilosophical tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries in that he\nuses both traditional myths and myths he invents and gives them some\nrole to play in his philosophical endeavor. He thus seems to attempt\nto overcome the traditional opposition between muthos and\nlogos.\n\nThere are many myths in Plato\u2019s dialogues: traditional myths,\nwhich he sometimes modifies, as well as myths that he invents,\nalthough many of these contain mythical elements from various\ntraditions. Plato is both a myth teller and a myth maker. In general,\nhe uses myth to inculcate in his less philosophical readers noble\nbeliefs and/or teach them various philosophical matters that may be\ntoo difficult for them to follow if expounded in a blunt,\nphilosophical discourse. More and more scholars have argued in recent\nyears that in Plato myth and philosophy are tightly bound together, in\nspite of his occasional claim that they are opposed modes of\ndiscourse.\n", "toc": [{"#PlaReaAud": "1.

Plato\u2019s reading audience\n\nFor whom did Plato write? Who was his readership? A very good survey\nof this topic is Yunis 2007 from which I would like to quote the\nfollowing illuminating passage: \u201cbefore Plato, philosophers\ntreated arcane subjects in technical treatises that had no appeal\noutside small circles of experts. These writings, \u2018on\nnature\u2019, \u2018on truth\u2019, \u2018on being\u2019 and so\non, mostly in prose, some in verse, were demonstrative, not\nprotreptic. Plato, on the other hand, broke away from the experts and\nsought to treat ethical problems of universal relevance and to make\nphilosophy accessible to the public\u201d (13). Other scholars, such\nas Morgan (2003), have also argued that Plato addressed in his\nwritings both philosophical and non-philosophical audiences.\n\nIt is true that in the Republic Plato has the following\nadvice for philosophers: \u201clike someone who takes refuge under a\nlittle wall from a storm of dust or hail driven by the wind, the\nphilosopher\u2014seeing others filled with lawlessness\u2014is\nsatisfied if he can somehow lead his present life free from injustice\nand impious acts and depart from it with good hope, blameless and\ncontent\u201d (496d\u2013e) (unless otherwise noted, all quotations\nfrom Plato are from the translations included in Plato (1997)). He was\ncertainly very bitter about Socrates\u2019 fate. In his controversial\ninterpretation Strauss (1964) argues that in Plato\u2019s view the\nphilosopher should stay disconnected from society. This interpretation\nis too extreme. Plato did not abandon Socrates\u2019 credo, that the\nphilosopher has a duty towards his fellow-citizens who do not devote\ntheir lives to philosophy. For him philosophy has a civic dimension.\nThe one who makes it outside the cave should not forget about those\nwho are still down there and believe that the shadows they see there\nare real beings. The philosopher should try to transmit his knowledge\nand his wisdom to the others, and he knows that he has a difficult\nmission. But Plato was not willing to go as far as Socrates did. He\npreferred to address the public at large through his written dialogues\nrather than conducting dialogues in the agora. He did not write\nabstruse philosophical treatises but engaging philosophical dialogues\nmeant to appeal to a less philosophically inclined audience. The\ndialogues are, most of the time, prefaced by a sort of mise en\nsc\u00e8ne in which the reader learns who the participants to\nthe dialogue are, when, where and how they presently met, and what\nmade them start their dialogue. The participants are historical and\nfictional characters. Whether historical or fictional, they meet in\nhistorical or plausible settings, and the prefatory mises en\nsc\u00e8ne contain only some incidental anachronisms. Plato\nwanted his dialogues to look like genuine, spontaneous dialogues\naccurately preserved. How much of these stories and dialogues is\nfictional? It is hard to tell, but he surely invented a great deal of\nthem. References to traditional myths and mythical characters occur\nthroughout the dialogues. However, starting with the\nProtagoras and Gorgias, which are usually regarded\nas the last of his early writings, Plato begins to season his\ndialogues with self-contained, fantastical narratives that we usually\nlabel his \u2018myths\u2019. His myths are meant, among other\nthings, to make philosophy more accessible.\n2. Plato\u2019s myths\n\nThere are in Plato identifiable traditional myths, such as the story\nof Gyges (Republic 359d\u2013360b), the myth of Phaethon\n(Timaeus 22c7) or that of the Amazons (Laws 804e4).\nSometimes he modifies them, to a greater or lesser extent, while other\ntimes he combines them\u2014this is the case, for instance, of the\nNoble Lie (Republic 414b\u2013415d), which is a combination\nof the Cadmeian myth of autochthony and the Hesiodic myth of ages.\nThere are also in Plato myths that are his own, such as the myth of Er\n(Republic 621b8) or the myth of Atlantis (Timaeus\n26e4). Many of the myths Plato invented feature characters and motifs\ntaken from traditional mythology (such as the Isles of the Blessed or\nthe judgment after death), and sometimes it is difficult to\ndistinguish his own mythological motifs from the traditional ones. The\nmajority of the myths he invents preface or follow a philosophical\nargument: the Gorgias myth (523a\u2013527a), the myth of the\nandrogyne (Symposium 189d\u2013193d), the Phaedo\nmyth (107c\u2013115a), the myth of Er (Republic\n614a\u2013621d), the myth of the winged soul (Phaedrus\n246a\u2013249d), the myth of Theuth (Phaedrus\n274c\u2013275e), the cosmological myth of the Statesman\n(268\u2013274e), the Atlantis myth (Timaeus 21e\u201326d,\nCritias), the Laws myth (903b\u2013905b).\n\nPlato refers sometimes to the myths he uses, whether traditional or\nhis own, as muthoi (for an overview of all the loci\nwhere the word muthos occurs in Plato see Brisson 1998\n(141ff.)). However, muthos is not an exclusive label. For\ninstance: the myth of Theuth in the Phaedrus (274c1) is\ncalled an ako\u0113 (a \u201cthing heard\u201d,\n\u201creport\u201d, \u201cstory\u201d); the myth of Cronus is\ncalled a ph\u0113m\u0113 (\u201coracle\u201d,\n\u201ctradition\u201d, \u201crumour\u201d) in the Laws\n(713c2) and a muthos in the Statesman (272d5, 274e1,\n275b1); and the myth of Boreas at the beginning of the\nPhaedrus is called both mutholog\u0113ma (229c5) and\nlogos (d2).\n\nThe myths Plato invents, as well as the traditional myths he uses, are\nnarratives that are non-falsifiable, for they depict particular\nbeings, deeds, places or events that are beyond our experience: the\ngods, the daemons, the heroes, the life of soul after death, the\ndistant past, etc. Myths are also fantastical, but they are not\ninherently irrational and they are not targeted at the irrational\nparts of the soul. Kahn (1996, 66\u20137) argues that between\nPlato\u2019s \u201cotherworldly vision\u201d and \u201cthe values\nof Greek society in the fifth and fourth centuries BC\u201d was a\n\u201cradical discrepancy\u201d. In that society, Plato\u2019s\nmetaphysical vision seemed \u201calmost grotesquely out of\nplace\u201d. This discrepancy, claims Kahn, \u201cis one explanation\nfor Plato\u2019s use of myth: myth provides the necessary literary\ndistancing that permits Plato to articulate his\nout\u2013of\u2013place vision of meaning and truth.\u201d\n\nThe discussion of the Symposium ends with Aristophanes and\nAgathon falling asleep while Socrates is trying to prove that\n\u201cthe skilful tragic dramatist should also be a comic poet\u201d\n(223d). Plato himself seems to be such an author, as some of his\ndialogues read like tragedies (e.g. the Phaedo), while others\nmix arguments with irony and humour (e.g. the Euthydemus,\nLesser Hippias, or Ion). For the link between drama\nand philosophy in Plato\u2019s dialogues see Puchner (2010), Folch\n(2015), Zimmermann (2018), and Fossheim, Songe-M\u00f8ller and\n\u00c5gotnes (2019); for the importance of comedy and laughter in the\ndialogues see Tanner (2017) and Naas (2018b); and for the theory and\npractice of narrative in Plato see Halliwell (2009). And now to go\nback to Kahn\u2019s claim (see the above paragraph) that in Plato\n\u201cmyth provides the necessary literary distancing that permits\nPlato to articulate his out\u2013of\u2013place vision of meaning and\ntruth.\u201d This may well be the case. But we have to keep in mind\nthat Plato\u2019s dialogues are a mix of various literary genres\n(philosophy, comedy, tragedy, poetry, mythology, rhetoric), and that\nthis mix is also (to use Kahn\u2019s expression)\nout-of-place. In other words, both the content and the\nform of Plato\u2019s dialogues were, and still are, rather\nextraordinary\u2014and that, I reckon, was meant to free his readers\nfrom conventions and encourage them to think for themselves about the\nissues that, he, Plato, discusses in his dialogues.\n\nThe Cave, the narrative that occurs in the Republic\n(514a\u2013517a), is a fantastical story, but it does not deal\nexplicitly with the beyond (the distant past, life after death etc.),\nand is thus different from the traditional myths Plato uses and the\nmyths he invents. Strictly speaking, the Cave is an analogy, not a\nmyth. Also in the Republic, Socrates says that until\nphilosophers take control of a city \u201cthe politeia whose story we\nare telling in words (muthologein) will not achieve its\nfulfillment in practice\u201d (501e2\u20135; translated by Rowe\n(1999, 268)). The construction of the ideal city may be called a\n\u201cmyth\u201d in the sense that it depicts an imaginary polis\n(cf. 420c2: \u201cWe imagine the happy state\u201d). In the\nPhaedrus (237a9, 241e8) the word muthos is used to\nname \u201cthe rhetorical exercise which Socrates carries out\u201d\n(Brisson 1998, 144), but this seems to be a loose usage of the\nword.\n\nMost (2012) argues that there are eight main features of the Platonic\nmyth. (a) Myths are a monologue, which those listening do not\ninterrupt; (b) they are told by an older speaker to younger listeners;\n(c) they \u201cgo back to older, explicitly indicated or implied,\nreal or fictional oral sources\u201d (17); (d) they cannot be\nempirically verified; (e) their authority derive from tradition, and\n\u201cfor this reason they are not subject to rational examination by\nthe audience\u201d (18); (f) they have a psychologic effect:\npleasure, or a motivating impulse to perform an action \u201ccapable\nof surpassing any form of rational persuasion\u201d (18); (g) they\nare descriptive or narrative; (h) they precede or follow a dialectical\nexposition. Most acknowledges that these eight features are not\ncompletely uncontroversial, and that there are occasional exceptions;\nbut applied flexibly, they allow us to establish a corpus of at least\nfourteen Platonic myths in the Phaedo, Gorgias,\nProtagoras, Meno, Phaedrus,\nSymposium, Republic X, Statesman,\nTimaeus, Critias and Laws IV. The first\nseven features \u201care thoroughly typical of the traditional myths\nwhich were found in the oral culture of ancient Greece and which Plato\nhimself often describes and indeed vigorously criticizes\u201d\n(19).\n\nDorion (2012) argues that the Oracle story in Plato\u2019s\nApology has all these eight features of the Platonic myth\ndiscussed by Most (2012). Dorion concludes that the Oracle story is\nnot only a Platonic fiction, but also a Platonic myth, more\nspecifically: a myth of origin. Who invented the examination of the\nopinions of others by the means of elenchus? Aristotle (see\nSophistical Refutations 172a30\u201335 and Rhetoric\n1354a3\u20137) thought that the practice of refutation is, as Dorion\nputs it, \u201clost in the mists of time and that it is hence vain to\nseek an exact origin of it\u201d (433). Plato, however, attempts to\nconvince us that the dialectical elenchus \u201cwere a form\nof argumentation that Socrates began to practice spontaneously as soon\nas he learned of the Oracle\u201d (433); thus, Plato confers to it a\ndivine origin; in the Charmides he does the same when he\nmakes Socrates say that he learned an incantation (a metaphor for the\nelenchus) from Zalmoxis; see also the Philebus 16c\n(on Socrates mythologikos see also Miller (2011)).\n\nWe have a comprehensive book about the people of Plato: Nails (2002);\nnow we also have one about the animals of Plato: Bell and Naas (2015).\nAnyone interested in myth, metaphor, and on how people and animals are\nintertwined in Plato would be rewarded by consulting it. Here is a\nquotation from the editors\u2019 introduction, \u201cPlato\u2019s\nMenagerie\u201d:\n\nAnimal images, examples, analogies, myths, or fables are used in\nalmost every one of Plato\u2019s dialogues to help characterize,\ndelimit, and define many of the dialogues\u2019 most important\nfigures and themes. They are used to portray not just Socrates\n[compared to a gadfly, horse, swan, snake, stork, fawn, and torpedo\nray] but many other characters in the dialogues, from the wolfish\nThrasymachus of the Republic to the venerable racehorse\nParmenides of the Parmenides. Even more, animals are used\nthroughout the dialogues to develop some of Plato\u2019s most\nimportant political or philosophical ideas. [\u2026] By our\nreckoning, there is but a single dialogue (the Crito) that\ndoes not contain any obvious reference to animals, while most\ndialogues have many. What is more, throughout Plato\u2019s dialogues\nthe activity or enterprise of philosophy itself is often compared to a\nhunt, where the interlocutors are the hunters and the object of the\ndialogue\u2019s search\u2014ideas of justice, beauty, courage,\npiety, or friendship\u2014their elusive animal prey. (Bell and\nNaas 2015, 1\u20132)\n\n3. Myth as a means of persuasion\n\nFor Plato we should live according to what reason is able to deduce\nfrom what we regard as reliable evidence. This is what real\nphilosophers, like Socrates, do. But the non-philosophers are\nreluctant to ground their lives on logic and arguments. They have to\nbe persuaded. One means of persuasion is myth. Myth inculcates\nbeliefs. It is efficient in making the less philosophically inclined,\nas well as children (cf. Republic 377a ff.), believe noble\nthings.\n\nIn the Republic the Noble Lie is supposed to make the\ncitizens of Callipolis care more for their city. Schofield (2009)\nargues that the guards, having to do philosophy from their youth, may\neventually find philosophizing \u201cmore attractive than doing their\npatriotic duty\u201d (115). Philosophy, claims Schofield, provides\nthe guards with knowledge, not with love and devotion for their city.\nThe Noble Lie is supposed to engender in them devotion for their city\nand instill in them the belief that they should \u201cinvest their\nbest energies into promoting what they judge to be the city\u2019s\nbest interests\u201d (113). The preambles to a number of laws in the\nLaws that are meant to be taken as exhortations to the laws\nin question and that contain elements of traditional mythology (see\n790c3, 812a2, 841c6) may also be taken as \u201cnoble\nlies\u201d.\n\nThe following myths are eschatological: Gorgias\n523a\u2013527a, Meno 81a\u2013d, Phaedo\n107c\u2013115a, Phaedrus 246a\u2013257a, Republic\n614b\u2013621d, and Laws 903b\u2013905d. The stories they\ntell differ\u2014to a greater or lesser extent\u2014although some\nthemes occur in more than one of them: the judgement of souls for\ntheir earthly life, their subsequent punishment or reward, the\ncontemplation of forms in the other world, and reincarnation (which,\nin the Phaedo 81d\u2013e, is part of the soul\u2019s\npunishment or reward; see also the Timaeus 42c\u2013e and\n90e\u201392c). These are Plato\u2019s myths, but they feature many\nelements and deities of classical mythology (such as Zeus, Prometheus,\nHestia, Necessity and the Fates). For good surveys of Plato\u2019s\neschatological myths see Annas (1982) and Inwood (2009); see also the\nentries on myth and eschatology in Press and Duque (2022). For the\nrelationship between philosophy and religion in Plato see Nightingale\n(2021). O\u2019Meara (2017, 114) argues that the Timaeus and\nthe Statesman are \u201creformed Panathenaic\u201d\nfestivals\u2014in which Zeus (Timaeus) and Athena\n(Statesman) are \u201creformed\u201d\u2014while the\nLaws is a \u201creformed Dionysian festival\u201d (in which\nDionysus is \u201creformed\u201d).\n\nPlato\u2019s eschatological myths are not complete lies. There is\nsome truth in them. In the Phaedo the statement \u201cThe\nsoul is immortal\u201d is presented as following logically from\nvarious premises Socrates and his interlocutors consider acceptable\n(cf. 106b\u2013107a). After the final argument for immortality\n(102a\u2013107b), Cebes admits that he has no further objections to,\nnor doubts about, Socrates\u2019 arguments. But Simmias confesses\nthat he still retains some doubt (107a\u2013b), and then Socrates\ntells them an eschatological myth. The myth does not provide evidence\nthat the soul is immortal. It assumes that the soul is immortal and so\nit may be said that it is not entirely false. The myth also claims\nthat there is justice in the afterlife and Socrates hopes that the\nmyth will convince one to believe that the soul is immortal and that\nthere is justice in the afterlife. \u201cI think\u201d, says\nSocrates, that \u201cit is fitting for a man to risk the\nbelief\u2014for the risk is a noble one\u2014that this, or something\nlike this, is true about our souls and their dwelling places\u201d\n(114d\u2013e). (Edmonds (2004) offers a interesting analysis of the\nfinal myth of Phaedo, Aristophanes\u2019 Frogs and\nthe funerary gold leaves, or \u201ctablets\u201d, that have been\nfound in Greek tombs). At the end of the myth of Er (the\neschatological myth of the Republic) Socrates says that the\nmyth \u201cwould save us, if we were persuaded by it\u201d (621b).\nMyth represents a sort of back-up: if one fails to be persuaded by\narguments to change one\u2019s life, one may still be persuaded by a\ngood myth. Myth, as it is claimed in the Laws, may be needed\nto \u201ccharm\u201d one \u201cinto agreement\u201d (903b) when\nphilosophy fails to do so.\n\nSedley (2009) argues that the eschatological myth of the\nGorgias is best taken as an allegory of \u201cmoral malaise\nand reform in our present life\u201d (68) and Halliwell (2007) that\nthe myth of Er may be read as an allegory of life in this world.\nGonzales (2012) claims that the myth of Er offers a \u201cspectacle\n[that] is, in the words of the myth itself, pitiful, comic and\nbewildering\u201d (259). Thus, he argues, \u201cwhat generally\ncharacterizes human life according to the myth is a fundamental\nopacity\u201d (272); which means that the myth is not\nactually a dramatization of the philosophical reasoning that unfolds\nin the Republic, as one might have expected, but of\neverything that \u201csuch reasoning cannot penetrate and master,\neverything that stubbornly remains dark and irrational: embodiment,\nchance, character, carelessness, and forgetfulness, as well as the\ninherent complexity and diversity of the factors that define a life\nand that must be balanced in order to achieve a good life\u201d\n(272). The myth blurs the boundary between this world and the other.\nTo believe that soul is immortal and that we should practice justice\nin all circumstances, Gonzales argues, we have to be persuaded by what\nSocrates says, not by the myth of Er. Unlike the eschatological myths\nof the Gorgias and Phaedo, the final myth of the\nRepublic illustrates rather \u201ceverything in this world\nthat opposes the realization of the philosophical ideal. If the other\nmyths offer the philosopher a form of escapism, the myth of Er is his\nnightmare\u201d (277, n. 36).\n4. Myth as a teaching tool\n\nThe philosopher should share his philosophy with others. But since\nothers may sometimes not follow his arguments, Plato is ready to\nprovide whatever it takes\u2014an image, a simile, or a\nmyth\u2014that will help them grasp what the argument failed to tell\nthem. The myth\u2014just like an image, or analogy\u2014may be a\ngood teaching tool. Myth can embody in its narrative an abstract\nphilosophical doctrine. In the Phaedo, Plato develops the\nso-called theory of recollection (72e\u201378b). The theory is there\nexpounded in rather abstract terms. The eschatological myth of the\nPhaedo depicts the fate of souls in the other world, but it\ndoes not \u201cdramatize\u201d the theory of recollection. The\nPhaedrus myth of the winged soul, however, does. In it we are\ntold how the soul travels in the heavens before reincarnation,\nattempts to gaze on true reality, forgets what it saw in the heavens\nonce reincarnated, and then recalls the eternal forms it saw in the\nheavens when looking at their perceptible embodiments. The\nPhaedrus myth does not provide any proofs or evidence to\nsupport the theory of recollection. It simply assumes this theory to\nbe true and provides (among other things) an \u201cadaptation\u201d\nof it. Since this theory the myth embodies is, for Plato, true, the\nmyth has (pace Plato) a measure of truth in it, although its many\nfantastical details may lead one astray if taken literally. Among\nother things, the fantastical narrative of the myth helps the less\nphilosophically inclined grasp the main point of Plato\u2019s theory\nof recollection, namely that \u201cknowledge is\nrecollection\u201d.\n5. Myth in the Timaeus\n\nThe cosmology of the Timaeus is a complex and ample\nconstruction, involving a divine maker (assisted by a group of less\npowerful gods), who creates the cosmos out of a given material\n(dominated by an inner impulse towards disorder) and according to an\nintelligible model. The cosmology as a whole is called both an\neik\u014ds muthos (29d, 59c, 68d) and an eik\u014ds\nlogos (30b, 48d, 53d, 55d, 56a, 57d, 90e). The expression\neik\u014ds muthos has been translated as \u2018probable\ntale\u2019 (Jowett), \u2018likely story\u2019 (Cornford),\n\u2018likely tale\u2019 (Zeyl). The standard interpretation is\npromoted by, among others, Cornford (1937, 31ff.). The\nTimaeus cosmology, Cornford argues, is a muthos\nbecause it is cast in the form of a narration, not as a piece-by-piece\nanalysis. But also, and mainly, because its object, namely the\nuniverse, is always in a process of becoming and cannot be really\nknown. Brisson (1998, ch. 13) offers a different solution, but along\nthe same lines. The cosmology, Brisson argues, is a non-verifiable\ndiscourse about the perceptible universe before and during its\ncreation. In other words: the cosmology is an eik\u014ds\nmuthos because it is about what happens to an eik\u014dn\nbefore, and during, its creation, when everything is so fluid that it\ncannot be really known. The standard alternative is to say that the\nproblem lies in the cosmologist, not in the object of his cosmology.\nIt is not that the universe is so unstable so that it cannot be really\nknown. It is that we fail to provide an exact and consistent\ndescription of it. A proponent of this view is Taylor (1928, 59). Rowe\n(2003) has argued that the emphasis at 29d2 is on the word\neik\u014ds, not muthos, and that here\nmuthos is used primarily as a substitute for logos\nwithout its typical opposition to that term (a view also held by\nVlastos (1939, 380\u20133)). Burnyeat (2009) argues that this\ncosmology is an attempt to disclose the rationality of the cosmos,\nnamely the Demiurge\u2019s reasons for making it thus and so. The\nword eik\u014ds (a participial form of the verb\neoika, \u201cto be like\u201d) is, argues Burnyeat, usually\ntranslated as \u201cprobable\u201d; but\u2014as textual evidence\nfrom Homer to Plato proves\u2014it also means\n\u201cappropriate\u201d, \u201cfitting\u201d, \u201cfair\u201d,\n\u201cnatural\u201d, \u201creasonable\u201d. Since the cosmology\nreveals what is reasonable in the eik\u014dn made by the\nDemiurge, it may rightly be called eik\u014ds,\n\u201creasonable\u201d. The Demiurge\u2019s reasoning, however, is\npractical, not theoretical. The Demiurge, Burnyeat claims, works with\ngiven materials, and when he creates the cosmos, he does not have a\nfree choice, but has to adjust his plans to them. Although we know\nthat the Demiurge is supremely benevolent towards his creation, none\nof us could be certain of his practical reasons for framing the cosmos\nthe way he did. That is why anyone aiming at disclosing them cannot\nbut come up with \u201cprobable\u201d answers. Plato\u2019s\ncosmology is then eik\u014ds in the two senses of the word,\nfor it is both \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d.\nBut why does Plato call it a muthos? Because, Burnyeat\nargues, the Timaeus cosmology is also a theogony (for the\ncreated cosmos is for Plato a god), and this shows Plato\u2019s\nintention to overcome the traditional opposition between\nmuthos and logos.\n\nTimaeus speaks about the Demiurge\u2019s practical reasoning for\ncreating the cosmos as he did. No cosmologist can deduce these reasons\nfrom various premises commonly accepted. He has to imagine them, but\nthey are neither fantastical, nor sophistic. The cosmologist exercises\nhis imagination under some constraints. He has to come up with\nreasonable and coherent conjectures. And in good Socratic and Platonic\ntradition, he has to test them with others. This is what Timaeus does.\nHe expounds his cosmology in front of other philosophers, whom he\ncalls kritai, \u201cjudges\u201d (29d1). They are highly\nskilled and experienced philosophers: Socrates, Critias and\nHermocrates and at the beginning of the Critias, the sequel\nto the Timaeus, they express their admiration for\nTimaeus\u2019 cosmological account (107a). One may say that\nTimaeus\u2019 account has been peer-reviewed. The judges, however,\nsays Plato, have to be tolerant, for in this field one cannot provide\nmore than conjectures. Timaeus\u2019 cosmological discourse is not\naimed at persuading a less philosophically inclined audience to change\ntheir lives. It may be argued that its creationist scenario was meant\nto make the difficult topic of the genesis of the realm of becoming\nmore accessible. In the Philebus, in a tight dialectical\nconversation, the genesis of the realm of becoming is explained in\nabstract terms (the unlimited, limit, being that is mixed and\ngenerated out of those two; and the cause of this mixture and\ngeneration, 27b\u2013c). But the Timaeus aims at\nencompassing more than the Philebus. It aims not only at\nrevealing the ultimate ontological principles (accessible to human\nreason, cf. 53d), and at explaining how their interaction brings forth\nthe world of becoming, but also at disclosing, within a teleological\nframework, the reasons for which the cosmos was created the way it is.\nThese reasons are to be imagined because imagination has to fill in\nthe gaps that reason leaves in this attempt to disclose the reasons\nfor which the cosmos was created the way it is.\n6. Myth and philosophy\n\nIn the Protagoras (324d) a distinction is made between\nmuthos and logos, where muthos appears to\nrefer to a story and logos to an argument. This distinction\nseems to be echoed in the Theaetetus and the\nSophist. In the Theaetetus Socrates discusses\nProtagoras\u2019 main doctrine and refers to it as \u201cthe\nmuthos of Protagoras\u201d (164d9) (in the same line\nSocrates also calls Theaetetus\u2019 defence of the identity of\nknowledge and perception a muthos). And later on, at 156c4,\nSocrates calls a muthos the teaching according to which\nactive and passive motions generate perception and perceived objects.\nIn the Sophist, the Visitor from Elea tells his interlocutors\nthat Xenophanes, Parmenides and other Eleatic, Ionian (Heraclitus\nincluded) and Sicilian philosophers \u201cappear to me to tell us a\nmyth, as if we were children\u201d (242c8; see also c\u2013e). By\ncalling all those philosophical doctrines muthoi Plato does\nnot claim that they are myths proper, but that they are, or appear to\nbe, non-argumentative. In the Republic Plato is fairly\nhostile to particular traditional myths (but he claims that there are\ntwo kinds of logoi, one true and the other false, and that\nthe muthoi we tell children \u201care false, on the whole,\nthough they have some truth in them\u201d, 377a; for a discussion of\nallegory and myth in Plato\u2019s Republic see Lear (2006)).\nHalliwell (2011) claims that Book X of the Republic\n\u201coffers not a simple repudiation of the best poets but a\ncomplicated counterpoint in which resistance and attraction to their\nwork are intertwined, a counterpoint which (among other things)\nexplores the problem of whether, and in what sense, it might be\npossible to be a \u2018philosophical lover\u2019 of poetry\u201d\n(244). For an illuminating article on the Republic and the\nOdyssey see Segal (1978); see also Howland (2006).\n\nIn many dialogues he condemns the use of images in knowing things and\nclaims that true philosophical knowledge should avoid images. He would\nhave had strong reasons for avoiding the use of myths: they are not\nargumentative and they are extremely visual (especially those he\ninvented, which contain so many visual details as if he would have\ngiven instructions to an illustrator). But he didn\u2019t. He wanted\nto persuade and/or teach a wider audience, so he had to make a\ncompromise. Sometimes, however, he seems to interweave philosophy with\nmyth to a degree that was not required by persuading and/or teaching a\nnon-philosophical audience. The eschatological myths of the\nGorgias, Phaedo and Republic, for instance,\nare tightly bound with the philosophical arguments of those dialogues\n(cf. Annas 1982); and the eschatological myth of the Phaedo\n\u201cpicks one by one the programmatic remarks about teleological\nscience from earlier on in the dialogue, and sketches ways in which\ntheir proposals can be fulfilled\u201d (Sedley 1990, 381). Some other\ntimes he uses myth as a supplement to philosophical discourse (cf.\nKahn (2009) who argues that in the myth of the Statesman\nPlato makes a doctrinal contribution to his political philosophy; Naas\n(2018a, Chapter 2) offers an interesting interpretation of this myth,\nand (Chapter 3) discusses Michel Foucault\u2019s reading of it. A\nnumber of chapters in Sallis (2017) and in Bossi and Robinson (2018)\nreassess the myth of the Statesman. One time, in the\nTimaeus, Plato appears to overcome the opposition between\nmuthos and logos: human reason has limits, and when\nit reaches them it has to rely on myth (arguably, that also happen in\nthe Symposium; for a very close reading of how\nDiotima\u2019s speech interacts with Aristophanes\u2019 myth of the\nandrogyne see Hyland (2015).\n\n\u201cOn the less radical version, the idea will be that the telling\nof stories is a necessary adjunct to, or extension of, philosophical\nargument, one which recognizes our human limitations,\nand\u2014perhaps\u2014the fact that our natures combine irrational\nelements with the rational\u201d (Rowe 1999, 265). On a more radical\ninterpretation, \u201cthe distinction between \u2018the\nphilosophical\u2019 and \u2018the mythical\u2019 will\u2014at one\nlevel\u2014virtually disappear\u201d (265). If we take into account\nthat Plato chose to express his thoughts through a narrative form,\nnamely that of the dialogue (further enveloped in fictional mises\nen sc\u00e8ne), we may say that the \u201cuse of a fictional\nnarrative form (the dialogue) will mean that any conclusions reached,\nby whatever method (including \u2018rational argument\u2019), may\nthemselves be treated as having the status of a kind of\n\u2018myth\u2019\u201d (265). If so, \u201ca sense of the\n\u2018fictionality\u2019 of human utterance, as provisional,\ninadequate, and at best approximating to the truth, will infect\nPlatonic writing at its deepest level, below other and more ordinary\napplications of the distinction between mythical and nonmythical forms\nof discourse\u201d (265); if so, it is not only \u201cthat\n\u2018myth\u2019 will fill in the gaps that reason leaves (though it\nmight do that too, as well as serving special purposes for particular\naudiences), but that human reason itself ineradicably displays some of\nthe features we characteristically associate with story-telling\u201d\n(265\u20136) (cf. also Fowler (2011, 64): \u201cJust as the\nimmortal, purely rational soul is tainted by the irrational body, so\nlogos is tainted by mythos\u201d). It is difficult\nto say which one of these two readings is a better approximation of\nwhat Plato thought about the interplay between myth and philosophy.\nThe interpreter seems bound to furnish only probable accounts about\nthis matter.\n\nFowler (2011) surveys the muthos\u2013logos dichotomy from\nHerodotus and the pre\u2013Socratic philosophers to Plato, the\nSophists, and the Hellenistic and Imperial writers, and provides many\nvaluable references to works dealing with the notion of\nmuthos, the Archaic uses of myth\u2013 words, and\nancient Greek mythology; see also Wians (2009). For the\nmuthos\u2013logos dichotomy in Plato see also Miller (2011,\n76\u201377).\n7. Plato\u2019s myths in the Platonist tradition\n\nAristotle admits that the lover of myths is in a sense a lover of\nwisdom (Metaphysics 982b18; cf. also 995a4 and\n1074b1\u201310). He might have used a myth or two in his early\ndialogues, now lost. But in general he seems to have distanced himself\nfrom myth (cf. Metaphysics 1000a18\u20139).\n\nOn the philosophical use of myth before Plato there are a number of\ngood studies, notably Morgan 2000. There is, however, little on the\nphilosophical use of myth in the Platonist tradition. Of Plato\u2019s\nimmediate successors in the Academy, Speusippus, Xenocrates and\nHeraclides of Pontus composed both dialogues and philosophical\ntreatises. But, with one exception, none of these seems to have used\nmyths as Plato did. The exception is Heraclides, who wrote various\ndialogues\u2014such as On the Things in Hades,\nZoroastres and Abaris\u2014involving mythical\nstories and mythical, or semi-mythical, figures. In the later\nPlatonist tradition\u2014with the exception of Cicero and\nPlutarch\u2014there is not much evidence that Plato\u2019s\nphilosophical use of myths was an accepted practice. In the\nNeoplatonic tradition various Platonic myths became the subject of\nelaborate allegorization. Porphyry, Proclus, Damascius and\nOlympiodorus gave allegorical interpretations of a number of Platonic\nmyths, such as the Phaedo and Gorgias eschatological\nmyths, or the myth of Atlantis.\n\nFor the influence of Plato\u2019s myths on various thinkers (Bacon,\nLeibniz, the German Idealists, Cassirer and others) see Keum\n(2020).\n8. Renaissance illustrations of Plato\u2019s myths\n\nPlato was a celebrated figure in the Renaissance but only a few\nillustrations of Platonic mythical motifs can be found. Perhaps\nPlato\u2019s attitude to visual representation\u2014claiming so\noften that the highest philosophical knowledge is devoid of it, and\nattacking poets and artists in general more than once\u2014inhibited\nand discouraged attempts to capture in painting, sculpture or prints,\nthe mythical scenes Plato himself depicted so vividly in words.\nPerhaps artists simply felt themselves unequal to the task. McGrath\n(2009) reviews and analyzes the rare illustrations of Platonic\nmythical figures and landscapes in Renaissance iconography: the\nandrogyne of the Symposium, the charioteer of the\nPhaedrus, the Cave, and the spindle of the universe\nhandled by Necessity and the Fates of the Republic.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"AntPlaMyt\">Anthologies of Plato\u2019s Myths</a>", "<a name=\"ShoIntPlaMyt\">Short introductions to Plato\u2019s myths</a>", "<a name=\"ArtBooPlaMyt\">Articles and books on Plato\u2019s myths</a>", "<a name=\"PlaMytPlaTraBib\">Plato\u2019s myths in the Platonist tradition</a>", "Renaissance illustrations of Plato\u2019s myths", "<a name=\"RefCit\">References Cited</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"AntPlaMyt\">Anthologies of Plato\u2019s Myths</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Partenie, C.
