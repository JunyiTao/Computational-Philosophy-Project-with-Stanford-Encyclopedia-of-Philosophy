    "main_text": "The Science of Human Action and Social Reform\n3. The Science of Human Action and Social Reform\n\nIn \u201cA Program for a Sociological Society\u201d (ca. 1897), an\nearly essay belonging to the same period as \u201cThe Study of the\nNegro Problems\u201d and \u201cThe Conservation of Races,\u201d Du\nBois places the emergence of the science of sociology in historical\nperspective. Prior to the industrial revolution, he argues, there was\nbut one science that studied the phenomenon of human action: namely,\npolitical economy. Political economy focused on the production,\ndistribution, and exchange of goods under stable social conditions,\nbut gave no attention to the intensification of problems of crime,\ndisease, poverty, prostitution, and ignorance that came with\n\u201cthe new concentration of industrys [sic], crowded into centers\nof population.\u201d Sociology addresses these problems, demanding a\n\u201cwider inquiry into the causes and scope of human action.\u201d\nMore generally, \u201c[s]ociology is\u2026the name given to that\nvast field of inquiry into human action as manifested in modern\norganized life.\u201d\n\nBut what is the point of sociological inquiry\u2014that is, of a\nsociological science of human action? Du Bois distinguishes between\nthe immediate and the mediate aims of scientific inquiry; that is,\nbetween the aims of science itself and the uses of scientific results\nby \u201cmerchants, physicians, men of letters, and\nphilanthropists\u201d\u2014indeed, by \u201call men\u201d (Du Bois\n1897, 89; see also Du Bois, ca.1897, 1\u201310). For Du Bois, the\nimmediate aim of science is knowledge; the mediate aims may vary, but\nsocial reform is the mediate aim upon which Du Bois focuses throughout\nhis career (see Green and Driver, 312\u2013313; Lewis, 1993,\n225\u201326; Reed, 47; and, especially, Bright, 5\u20137). But how\ncan scientific knowledge advance social reform? Du Bois sketches at\nleast three distinct answers to this question, each of which\ncorresponds to a different conception of the object of social\nscientific\n knowledge.[27]\n Knowledge of social laws and regularities can help the reformer to\nsettle on effective plans of action; knowledge of the scope and limits\nof chance can help her to hedge her bets\u2014that is, to guard\nagainst the possibility that her plans of action will fail; finally,\nknowledge of moral facts can help the reformer to caution her fellow\ncitizens against the disaster and sorrow that await them should they\npersist in an immoral course of action.\n",
