    "main_text": "Induction and Probability\n4. Induction and Probability\n\n\nHume was an influential figure in the formation of Ayer\u2019s\nphilosophical views, so it is no surprise to find Ayer\u2019s approach to\ninductive inference modeled on Hume\u2019s. Ayer defined inductive\ninference in negative terms, as involving all factual inference in\nwhich the premises did not entail the conclusion. All such inferences,\nAyer claimed, presumed the uniformity of nature, an assumption he put\nin terms of assuming that the future will, in relevant respects,\nresemble the past (1956, p. 72). To unambiguously cover cases of\nretrodiction, the assumption is better put in terms of the unobserved\nresembling, in relevant respects, the observed. Ayer agreed with Hume\nthat relying on any \u2018principle\u2019 of the uniformity of\nnature was not going to help justify inductive inference, given that\nsuch a principle was itself not demonstrable. A similar argument\napplied to any other principles that may have been thought to supply\nthe missing ingredient, such as an appeal to universal causality, or\nto laws of nature. These were also not demonstrably true, so would\nrequire justification themselves, and any appeal to these principles\nin such a justification would be viciously circular.\n\n\nThe fundamental problem here is that the inductive gap can be closed\nonly if the premises can somehow be made to entail their conclusion,\nand Ayer denied that this could be done. Na\u00efve realism tried to\ndo it by making the evidence \u2018move up\u2019 to the conclusion\n\u2013 by making it the case that in perception our evidence was\ndirectly of physical objects, rather than of sense-data from which\nphysical objects were inferred. This could work, if it did, only for\nperception, and not for other inductive inferences. Reductive attempts\nto close the gap tried to make the conclusion \u2018move down\u2019\nto the premises, as in phenomenalism. Ayer by now thought\nphenomenalism was unsuccessful in this attempt, and again reductionism\nwould not work for the future cases. In his 1956 he thought that the\nbest we could do was to admit the gap and be content to describe the\nways in which we actually went about justifying such inferences.\n\n\nAyer went on in later work to examine the problem of induction in\ngreater detail, in particular in relation to attempts to make the\nproblem tractable by appeal to notions of probability. In 1957 he\nwrote an important article attacking the idea that the logical\nconception of probability could be a useful guide to the future. Given\na proposition, a, that a horse is going to win the race, and\nvarious sources of evidence, h1,\nh2,\nh3\u2026hn, one can estimate\nthe probability of a given h1 to be\np1, given h2 to be\np2, and so on. One can also estimate the\nprobability of a given all of h1\n\u2026hn. Call this probability\npn, it being the probability of a given\nall of the evidence available to the person wishing to place a bet on\nthe horse. Which of these probabilities, asks Ayer, would it be\nrational for this person to base their bets on? Common sense dictates\nthat pn is the best estimate, but Ayer argues that\non the logical conception of probability, all of the estimates\np1\u2026pn are logically\ntrue, and so it is impossible to single out one as being\n\u2018better\u2019 than any of the others.\n\n\nAyer notes that common sense (and Carnap) say that a probability based\non \u2018total\u2019 evidence is what is needed. But why do we have\nto take into account total evidence? Given that all of the different\nestimates are logically true, there can be nothing wrong in relying on\none rather than another. Saying that if one takes into account all the\navailable evidence one is more likely to be right is equivalent to\nsaying that the hypothesis that \u2018those with total\nevidence\u2019 are more often right has a certain probability, and\nthat gets us no further forward. Ayer took this result as a reason to\nreject the logical interpretation of probability statements, a\nrejection repeated in his more extended treatment of probability in\nProbability and Evidence 1972, and again in his reply to J.L.\nMackie\u2019s attempt to rebut his objections (see Mackie 1979, Ayer\n1979).\nIn Probability and Evidence Ayer also criticised the\nfrequency interpretation of probability, noting that under this\ninterpretation the probability of an event will change with any change\nin the reference class to which that event is assigned. The frequency\ninterpretation itself cannot determine whether the choice of one\nreference class over another is better for the determination of the\nrelevant probability, and so suffers from a critical defect if it is\nto be of any use in solving problems associated with inductive\ninference.
