    "main_text": "What are mass expressions? || Syntactic criteria\n1.1 Syntactic criteria\n\n\nAt the syntactic level, there are two viable positions concerning\nthe mass / count distinction: it applies at the level of nouns; or it\nonly applies at the level of noun phrases.\n\n\nThe first position is the traditional, dominant view (e.g., Weinreich\n1966; Krifka 1991; Gillon 1992). According to it, in a language\nlike English (or French, German, Greek, Italian, etc.), common nouns are\ndivided into two morphosyntactic subclasses, mass nouns and count\nnouns. A defining characteristic of mass nouns, like milk,\ngold, furniture, wisdom and love,\nis that they are invariable in grammatical number, while count nouns,\nlike rabbit, bottle, table, idea\nand set, can be used in the singular and in the plural.\nDepending on the language, this basic morphosyntactic difference\nbetween the two types of noun is supplemented by differences as to the\ndeterminers they can combine with. Thus, in English, mass nouns can be\nused with determiners like much and a lot of, but\nneither with one nor many. On the contrary, count\nnouns can be employed with numerals like one and determiners\nlike many, but not with much.\n\n\nHowever, as is well known, mass nouns (like milk) can often\nbe used as count nouns: You should take a hot milk with some\nhoney. And vice versa: You will find a lot of rabbit around\nhere. For this reason, several researchers have denied that the\nmass / count distinction applies at the level of nouns, and proposed\ninstead that it only applies at the level of noun phrases (e.g., Damourette\n& Pichon 1927; Pelletier 1975, 2012; Ware 1975). Under this\nview, at the level of nouns, there are only common nouns, but common\nnouns can be used in a mass way or in a count way depending on the\nmorphosyntactic environment they are put into. Mass determiners, like\nmuch or a little, lead to a mass use of the noun\n(much water, much table), while count determiners,\nlike a or two, lead to a count use (two\nwaters, two \ntables).[1]\n\n\nThe two positions seem to be viable (cf. Pelletier &\nSchubert 2003) and they have their respective proponents. For ease of\nexposition, we adopt the dominant view in the rest of\nthe\n entry.[2]\n",
