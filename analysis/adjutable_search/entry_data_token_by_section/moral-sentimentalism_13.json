    "main_text": "Metaphysical Sentimentalism || Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n4.3 Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n\nFor sensibility theories, an evaluative property is not a disposition\nto cause responses in us, but the property of\nmeriting a response from us. A sensibility theory version of\nthe response-dependence equation looks like this:\n\n\nX is M if and only if X merits\nR / any virtuous subject S would respond to\nX with R in ideal circumstances\n\n\nIt is an obvious and familiar complaint against views of this type\nthat the analysis is uninformative. After all, normative\nterms occur on both sides of the equation: the right-hand side refers\nto meriting and virtuous subjects. There is no\nattempt to reduce evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones.\nNeither responses nor properties have metaphysical priority, but are\ninstead \u201csiblings\u201d (McDowell 1987). One argument in favour\nof this is the claim that the relevant response cannot be identified\nindependently of the (concept of the) property (Wiggins 1987: 195).\nSensibility theorists nevertheless claim that the non-reductive\nelucidation offers an advantage over primary quality views, according\nto which moral properties have no essential relation to us (see Cuneo\n2001 for a response).\n\nSensibility theories are a species of what is often called a Fitting\nAttitudes (FA) Analysis of value (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). The general form of an FA analysis is\nthe following:\n\n\nX is E if and only if, and because, R is an\nappropriate or fitting response to X /\nthere is sufficient reason to respond to X with\nR.\n\n\nThe \u2018because\u2019 indicates that the direction of metaphysical\nexplanation is from fittingness of attitudes to the property, and not\nthe other way: something is good because it is fitting to desire it,\nand not fitting to desire because it is good. This rules out views on\nwhich value and fitting attitudes go together, but claim that it is\nvalue that makes the attitude fitting and not vice versa. Some\nidentify FA analyses with neo-sentimentalism, but this is a\ntheoretically unhelpful classification, since many forms of FA\nanalysis regard the appropriateness or fittingness of attitudes itself\nas either a mind-independent normative fact that can be intellectually\nintuited (such as Ewing 1948) or as a truth determined by what would\nbe rationally or reasonably accepted (such as Scanlon 1998). These FA\nviews thus significantly depart from the key motivations for\nsentimentalism, and are better classified as FA variants of\nnon-naturalism and constructivism.\n\nThe specific features of sentimentalist FA analyses come out most\nnotably in the responses that sentimentalists can give to the\nmetaphysical echo of the Conflation Problem, namely the Wrong Kind of\nReasons problem. This is the problem that what makes a response\nappropriate or gives sufficient reason for it may be something that\nhas nothing to do with the relevant value. If an evil demon threatens\nto smite you unless you admire it for its threat, you may have\nsufficient reason to admire the demon (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). But that doesn\u2019t mean the demon\nis admirable \u2013 quite the contrary. In the jargon, admiration is\nnot a fitting response to the demon, since it is appropriate\nfor the wrong kind of reason.\n\nThere are various proposals to distinguish between right and wrong\nkinds of reasons for attitudes, not all of which are sentimentalist\n(e.g., Parfit 2011). Justin D\u2019Arms and Daniel Jacobson (2000b)\npresent a distinctively sentimentalist alternative. Their piecemeal\nsolution appeals to alethic standards of correctness derived\nfrom the content of the attitude in question. Assuming that an emotion\nhas a cognitive component that presents or construes things as being\nin a certain way\n (see Section 5.1),\n it can be either accurate or inaccurate, depending on whether things\nare that way. The right kind of reasons for or against the attitude\nare those that bear on its accuracy. As they put it,\n\n\nAn emotional episode presents its object as having certain evaluative\nfeatures; it is unfitting \u2026 when its object lacks those\nfeatures. (2000b: 73)\n\n\nThe example D\u2019Arms and Jacobson use is envy. According to them,\nit (broadly speaking) presents a rival in a negative light in virtue\nof having a desirable possession. The right kind of reasons bearing on\nwhether a rival is enviable are thus those that have to do with what\nshe possesses and its desirability relative to what you have. If a\ncolleague gets a promotion you wanted, envy may be fitting in this\nsense, and consequently, given a fitting attitudes account of\nevaluative properties, the colleague will be enviable. This is the\ncase even if envy is morally or prudentially inappropriate \u2013 the\nlatter kind of reasons do not bear on the fittingness of envy.\n\nAn alternative development of the same sort of idea can be found in\nChristine Tappolet\u2019s (2016) recent work. Tappolet holds that\ninstead of formulating fittingness in terms of reasons or normative\nrequirements of any kind, neo-sentimentalists can simply hold that,\nsay, Pierre is admirable, if and only if admiration is\ncorrect in response to Pierre when contemplating him (2016:\n87). Here correctness is a non-normative notion akin to truth:\nemotions present things as being in a certain way, and they are\ncorrect when things are indeed that way (see Section 5 for more\ndiscussion). Tappolet contrasts this kind of representational\nneo-sentimentalism with standard normative neo-sentimentalism.\nThe former, as such, has no reductive ambitions \u2013 it relates\nvalue properties to correct responses, but doesn\u2019t claim that\nPierre is admirable because it is correct to admire him. If\nanything, it is the other way around, which is why Tappolet thinks\nthat representational neo-sentimentalism is naturally paired with\nrealism about value (see also Oddie 2016). While normative\nneo-sentimentalists take reasons for valuing to be provided by the\nnon-evaluative properties of the target (which leaves open the\npossibility of reducing value to fitting attitudes), for Tappolet the\nreasons for evaluative attitudes are provided by values themselves.\nThe outstanding question for the standard neo-sentimentalist strategy\nis accounting for fittingness or reasons without assuming\nresponse-independent values. Representational neo-sentimentalism, on\nthe other hand, leaves emotions in a primarily epistemic role \u2013\nas Tappolet has it, part of what it is to possess evaluative concepts\nis to realize that they are canonically applied and justified on the\nbasis of emotional responses (2016: 99) (see again the discussion in\nthe next section).\n\nInterestingly, Adam Smith can be seen to offer a kind of naturalistic\nand sentimentalist account of fittingness in criticizing the\nintuitionist FA analyses of his time:\n\n\n[T]here are some modern systems, according to which virtue consists in\npropriety; or in the suitableness of the affection from which we act,\nto the cause or object which excites it \u2026 None of those systems\neither give, or even pretend to give, any precise or distinct measure\nby which this fitness or propriety of affection can be ascertained or\njudged of. That precise and distinct measure can be found nowhere but\nin the sympathetic feelings of the impartial and well-informed\nspectator. (TMS 346)\n\n\nA natural take on this is that Smith accepts the FA analysis that an\naction is wrong if and only if it is fitting to resent the agent for\nit, for example. But he then gives a distinctively sentimentalist cast\nto what it is for something to be fitting. This normative fact\nconsists in the response being endorsed by an impartial and\nwell-informed spectator (Kauppinen 2014b).\n",
