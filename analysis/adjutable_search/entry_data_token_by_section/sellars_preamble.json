    "main_text": "\n\n\nWilfrid Stalker Sellars (1912\u201389) was a systematic, original,\nand profound American philosopher.  His effort in philosophy was\n\u201cto formulate a scientifically oriented, naturalistic realism\nwhich would \u2018save the appearances\u2019\u2009\u201d (AR: 289).\nBroadly educated in philosophy, the influences on Sellars\u2019s work\nrange from critical realism and logical positivism to German Idealism\nand phenomenology.  Sellars was influential in part through his\neditorial work as a co-founder of the first American journal devoted\nto \u201canalytic\u201d philosophy and co-editor of two seminal\ncollections of essays that defined the canon for generations of\ngraduate students.  More significantly, he is known for his attack on\nthe \u201cmyth of the given\u201d and his development of a\ncoherentist epistemology and functional role/inferentialist semantics,\nfor his distinction between the \u201cmanifest image\u201d and the\n\u201cscientific image\u201d of the world, for his proposal that\npsychological concepts are like theoretical concepts, and for a\ntough-minded scientific realism.  Sellars can claim the first explicit\nformulation of a functionalist treatment of intentional states, an\nearly recognition of the \u201chard problem\u201d of sensory\nconsciousness, and a thoroughgoing nominalism, as well as rich\ninterpretations of historical figures in philosophy. His work has\ninspired a number of contemporary philosophers, although they tend to\nfall into at least two camps, sometimes denominated\n\u201cright-wing\u201d and \u201cleft-wing\u201d Sellarsians.\n",
