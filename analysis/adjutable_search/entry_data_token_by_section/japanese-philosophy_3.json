    "main_text": "Hallmarks of Japanese Philosophical Analysis || Forms of Assimilation\n2.3 Forms of Assimilation\n\nOne response to encountering an opposing philosophical position or\ntheory, a response common in the Western tradition from the time of\nthe ancient Sophists, is to reaffirm one\u2019s own position by\nrefuting the other, revealing its inconsistencies or weaknesses. (This\nadversarial form of argumentation, including its rarefied form known\nas the reductio ad absurdum, is common in Indian philosophy\nas well and was introduced to Japan via Buddhism more than a\nmillennium prior to any Western influence.) In Japan, however, a more\ncommon response to philosophical opposition has been to reaffirm\none\u2019s original view by assimilating into it what is central in\nthe opposing viewpoint through a process of allocation, relegation, or\nhybridization. Very often in Japanese philosophical debates, the\ncontenders compete in trying to absorb rather than refute the\nopposition. Cultural comparatists have noted that the Western game of\nchess is won by attacking the opponent\u2019s pieces and capturing\nthe king whereas the Japanese game of go is won by encircling\nthe opponent\u2019s stones until all are captured and none remain. To\nthe surprise of the uninitiated Western philosophical reader,\ntherefore, the skilled use of agreement and concession, rather than\ndirect attack, may sometimes be the sharpest tools in the Japanese\nphilosopher\u2019s argumentative arsenal. It is important, therefore,\nto notice how allocation, relegation, and hybridization can help a\nphilosophical theory gain dominance in the Japanese milieu.\n2.3.1 Allocation\n\nAllocation is the most compromising form of philosophical\nassimilation. Two opposing views are accepted without major alteration\nbut conflict is avoided by restricting each to its own clearly defined\ndisjunctive domain. A d\u00e9tente is negotiated such that each\nphilosophy can function without opposition within its own discrete set\nof philosophical problems as long as it refrains from universal claims\nthat its methods, assumptions, and conclusions apply to every possible\nkind of philosophical enterprise. For example, at times Japanese\nConfucian, Buddhist, and Shint\u014d philosophies resolved potential\nconflicts by allocating social and political issues to Confucianism,\npsychological and epistemological theories to Buddhism, and\nnaturalistic emotivism to Shint\u014d. The Seventeen-article\nConstitution of Prince Sh\u014dtoku in the early seventh century is\nsuch an instance, using Confucian principles to define the political\nvirtues and responsibilities of courtly retainers, the emperor, and\nthe people, but following Buddhist models in discussing human nature\nand the cultivation of the introspective discipline necessary to\ncontrol egoistic desires and unbridled emotions. Sh\u014dtoku\u2019s\ndocument used allocation, in effect, to envision a harmonious world of\nConfucian social and ethical decorum inhabited by people trained in\nBuddhist psychospiritual introspection and discipline.\n2.3.2 Relegation\n\nRelegation assimilates an opposing view by conceding its truth even\nwhile subordinating that truth to being only a partial component of\nthe original, now more inclusive, position. Usually the rhetoric is\nthat the apparently opposing view is not really something new at all,\nbut has always been part of the original theory, albeit perhaps not\npreviously emphasized as such. As in allocation, the position of the\nother is fully accepted but in this case only as an incomplete part of\nthe whole picture which, it is demonstrated, the original theory has\ncontained all along (or at least could ex post facto be\ninterpreted so). Of course, the rhetoric aside, a close analysis often\nreveals that the original theory actually expands its\ncomprehensiveness to incorporate the competing one, but the end result\nis the same: the rival ideas are assimilated by being relegated to a\nsubordinated place within the whole, thereby losing their force as an\nindependent theory that can oppose the winning position. For example,\nJapanese esoteric Buddhism assimilated proto-Shint\u014d ideas,\nvalues, and practices by relegating its kami to being\n\u201csurface manifestations\u201d of Buddhist reality. By that\nprocess, Shint\u014d cosmology and rituals could be assimilated\nwithout change within the esoteric Buddhist system but only insofar as\nthey were subordinated by means of a \u201cdeep\u201d Buddhist\nmetaphysical interpretation relegating their former proto-Shint\u014d\nmeanings to the superficial level of understanding.\n2.3.3 Hybridization\n\nHybridization is a third form of assimilation that leaves neither the\noriginal theory nor its opposing rival theory intact. Instead, through\ntheir cross-pollination something completely new is born. A hybrid\npresents us with a new species of philosophy and although we can do a\ngenealogy of its parentage, it cannot (unlike the cases of allocation\nor relegation) ever return to its earlier opposing forms. If we\nconsider a biological hybrid like a boysenberry, which has a genetic\nparentage traceable to a loganberry and a raspberry, we cannot find\nthe loganberry or the raspberry intact in the boysenberry. Once the\nhybrid is created, we cannot undo the crossbreeding; there are now\nthree distinct species of berries. Analogously, in the process of\nphilosophical assimilation, when true philosophical hybrids emerge,\nhistorians of philosophy may be able to uncover their genealogies, but\nthe theories themselves can no longer be deconstructed back into their\nparental origins. As will be explained below, in Japan\nbushid\u014d, the Way of the warrior, is such a philosophical\nhybrid born of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shint\u014d, but which\nbecame an independent philosophy of its own that in many ways served\nas a rival to its antecedents.\n\nNext let us examine how Japanese philosophers use those forms of\nanalysis in developing five originally distinct sources of\nphilosophical ideas.\n",
