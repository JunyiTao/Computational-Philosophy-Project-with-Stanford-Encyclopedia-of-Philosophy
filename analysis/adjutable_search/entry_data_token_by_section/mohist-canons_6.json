    "main_text": "Ethics || Practical Reasoning\n3.4 Practical Reasoning\n\nThe fourth area of novelty in the ethics of the Dialectics\nconcerns an aspect of practical reasoning that the Mohists call\n\u201cweighing\u201d (qu\u00e1n\n \u6b0a).[7]\n \u201cWeighing\u201d typically involves judging which of several\nalternative ends or courses of action is of greater benefit and lesser\nharm, and thus should determine how we act. The discussion of\n\u201cweighing\u201d is a response to two sorts of issues. One is\nhow to handle conflicts between competing ends or values. The other is\nhow to choose the best means of dealing with situations in which no\ncourse of action open to us is prima facie beneficial or\nright. Early Mohist texts contain no discussion of how benefit is to\nbe aggregated or maximized\u2014how the different elements of benefit\nare to be weighed against each other and combined so as to best\npromote the benefit of all. The later Mohist discussion of weighing\ncan be seen as addressing this issue on the basis of the principle of\nfavoring the greater part of a whole and thus choosing the greater of\ntwo benefits or the lesser of two harms.\n\nThe Mohists identify two forms of \u201cweighing.\u201d The first\nappears to be weighing of ends or things for which we act (the phrase\nin the text is \u201cthings treated as units\u201d) (EC8). This sort\nof judgment is what the text calls weighing proper\n(qu\u00e1n). The second appears to be weighing of means\n(the phrase reads \u201caffairs and action\u201d). The text deems\nthis process \u201cseeking\u201d (qi\u00fa \u6c42), a\nterm used elsewhere to explicate deliberation (see the section on\n epistemology\n below). It seems to refer to deliberation or planning about the\ncourse of action that would best achieve some end. \n\nIn principle, most action requires practical judgment, since general\nethical standards alone are usually insufficient to guide action in\nconcrete situations. But the cases that draw the Mohists\u2019 (and\nother ancient Chinese writers\u2019) attention are those in which\ndifferent values or ethical standards conflict, pulling the agent in\ndifferent directions, along with those in which one is forced to act\nwhen none of the available alternatives would normally justify or\nmotivate action. The Mohists were particularly concerned to explain\nhow their fundamental standard of benefit (l\u00ec) could\nguide action even when by normal standards none of the choices\navailable are beneficial. \n\nAccording to the Mohists, the ends for which we act may be\ndistinguished as sh\u00ec (right) or f\u0113i\n(wrong) in two ways, either \u201cdirectly\u201d or by\n\u201cweighing\u201d (EC8). In a particular instance, for example,\nwe might directly judge that something we normally take to be\nf\u0113i is indeed f\u0113i, or we might weigh the\nfeatures of the situation and conclude that in this special case\nsomething normally f\u0113i is actually sh\u00ec.\nSimilarly, desires and aversions may form in two ways. We may desire\nor dislike something directly or after weighing the benefits and harms\nof the available alternatives (A84). An example of the latter sort of\ndesire is a desire for the lesser of two harms, which one might form\nafter \u201cweighing benefit.\u201d The Mohists consider the case of\na traveler captured by robbers who force him to choose between\nsacrificing his finger, his arm, or his life (EC8). Clearly, the\ntraveler will sacrifice his finger, not his arm or his life. In\nabsolute terms, he is choosing something harmful. But as the Mohists\nsee it, selecting the lesser among harms counts as selecting benefit,\nnot harm. They point out that the agent\u2019s choices are not fully\nwithin his control. Forced to choose among harms, he selects the least\nharmful option. When compelled to give up something we possess, we\nchoose the least harmful alternative. When free to select something we\ndo not yet possess, we choose the most beneficial alternative. Either\nway, we still count as selecting benefit, not harm (EC8). \n\nThe decision-making procedure depicted in the discussion of\n\u201cweighing\u201d is tantamount to act consequentialism. However,\nas we have seen, later Mohist ethics overall seems to be a version of\nindirect consequentialism, in which actions are guided and justified\nby practices that are in turn justified by appeal to their beneficial\nconsequences. The basic standard for\n\u201cweighing\u201d\u2014\u201camong benefits, select the\ngreatest; among harms, select the smallest\u201d (EC8)\u2014appears\nto be a rule for resolving conflicts between standards or goods or for\nguiding action in exigent cases not covered by familiar moral norms.\n\n",
