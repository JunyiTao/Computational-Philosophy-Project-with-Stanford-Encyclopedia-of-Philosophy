    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Rejecting Premise 3: Coherentism\n5.3 Rejecting Premise 3: Coherentism\n\nCoherentists reject two related features of the picture of evidential\nreasons that underlies Agrippa\u2019s trilemma. The first feature is\nthe idea that justification is an asymmetrical relation: if a\nbelief \\(p_1\\) justifies a different belief \\(p_2\\), then \\(p_2\\) does\nnot justify \\(p_1\\). The second feature is the idea that the unit of\njustification is the individual belief. Putting these two rejections\ntogether, the coherentist believes that justification is a symmetrical\nand holistic matter. It is not individual beliefs that are justified\nin the primary sense of the word, but only complete systems of\nbeliefs\u2014individual beliefs are justified, when they are, in\nvirtue of belonging to a justified system of beliefs. The central\ncoherentist notion of justification is best taken to be a comparative\none: a system of beliefs B1 is better justified than a system of\nbeliefs B2 if and only if B1 has a greater degree of internal\ncoherence than B2. One crucial question that coherentists have to\nanswer, of course, is what it takes for one system of beliefs to have\na greater degree of coherence than another. Many coherentists have\nthought that explanatory relations will be crucial in elucidating the\nnotion of coherence: the more explanatorily integrated a system is,\nthe more coherence it displays (see Quine & Ullian 1970 [1978] and\nBonJour 1978).\n\nThe main objection that coherentists have to answer has been called\n\u201cthe isolation objection\u201d. The objection centers on the\nfact that, according to the coherentist, the justification of a system\nof beliefs is entirely a matter of relations among the beliefs\nconstituting the system. But this runs against the strong intuition\nthat experience has a very important role to play in the justification\nof beliefs. To illustrate the problem, suppose that you and I both\nhave a highly coherent set of beliefs\u2014your system, it is safe to\nassume, contains the belief that you are reading, whereas mine\ndoesn\u2019t, and it contains instead the belief that I am swimming\n(because, let us suppose, I am swimming right now). Suppose now that\nwe switch systems of beliefs\u2014somehow, you come to have my set of\nbeliefs and I come to have yours. Given that coherence is entirely a\nmatter of relations among beliefs, your system will be as coherent in\nmy mind as it was in yours, and vice-versa. And yet, our beliefs are\nnow completely unjustified\u2014there you are, reading, believing\nthat you are swimming, and here I am, swimming, believing that I am\nreading. In other words, certain transformations that preserve\ncoherence in a system of beliefs do not seem to preserve\njustification.\n\nIn reply, coherentists have argued that it is possible to give\nexperience a role without sacrificing the idea that coherence is\nentirely a matter of relations among beliefs\u2014one idea is to\nrequire that any minimally acceptable system of beliefs contain\nbeliefs about the experiences that the subject is undergoing (see\nBonJour 1985 and Lehrer 1990). It is fair to say that there is no\nagreement regarding whether this move can solve the problem.\n",
