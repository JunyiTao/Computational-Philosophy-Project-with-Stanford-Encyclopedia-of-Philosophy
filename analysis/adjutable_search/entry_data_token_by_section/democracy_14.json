    "main_text": "Democratic Representation || The Ethics of Representation\n5.2 The Ethics of Representation\n\nWhat moral norms apply to representatives carrying out their official\nduties? We can get a better handle on possible answers by introducing\nHannah Pitkin\u2019s famous distinction between trustees and\ndelegates (Pitkin 1967). Representatives who act as trustees\nrely on their own independent judgments in carrying out their duties.\nNorms of trusteeship are supported in recognition that, given a\nnatural division of democratic labor, officials are in a much better\nposition to make well-reasoned and well-informed political decisions\nthan ordinary citizens.\n\nRepresentatives who act as delegates defer to the judgments of their\ncitizens. These norms might be thought to reflect the value of\ndemocratic accountability. Because the people authorize\nrepresentatives to govern, it is natural to think that representatives\nare accountable to the people to enact their judgments. If\nrepresentatives are not accountable in this way, citizens lose\ndemocratic control over their representatives\u2019 actions.\n\nWhich norms should win out when they conflict? Pitkin argues that the\nanswer varies by context. This seems plausible. For example, if we\ntake the view that citizens primarily have the role of determining the\naims of the society, we might think that representatives ought to be\ndelegates with regard to the aims, but trustees with regard to the\nways of realizing the aims (Christiano 1996). See Suzanne Dovi\u2019s\ndiscussion of representation for a deeper and more nuanced discussion\nof these issues.\n",
