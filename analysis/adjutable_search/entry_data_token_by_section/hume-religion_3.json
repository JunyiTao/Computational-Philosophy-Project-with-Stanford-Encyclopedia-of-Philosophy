The Argument from Design\n\nAn obvious limitation of the cosmological and ontological arguments is\nthat they are highly abstract and, while they may convince a few\nphilosophers and theologians, they cannot serve as the basis of\nreligious belief for most ordinary people (D, 9.11/191\u20132).\nThings are very different, however, in the case of the argument from\ndesign. The defenders of this argument have often claimed that it is\nso obvious and convincing that even sceptics cannot seriously doubt or\ndeny it (D,3.7/154, 12.2/214). The argument from design is discussed\nby Hume in Section XI of the first Enquiry and, at greater\nlength, in the Dialogues (Parts II-VIII, XII). There are also\nseveral references to the argument from design in The Natural\nHistory of Religion (NHR, Intro, 5.2,6.1, 15.1), where Hume\npresents it as the most plausible and convincing of the various\narguments that have been advanced on this topic (cp. LG, 24\u20136).\nIt is, nevertheless, Hume\u2019s plain intention throughout these\nworks to expose the weaknesses and limitations of this argument.\n\nAt the beginning of Part II of the Dialogues Philo, who\nspeaks as the \u201ccareless sceptic\u201d and is generally\nidentified as representing Hume\u2019s views, presents a challenge to\nthe orthodox theist position similar to that which Hobbes had\npresented.\n\nBut surely, where reasonable men treat these subjects, the question\ncan never be concerning the being, but only the nature of the Deity.\nThe former truth, as you well observe, is unquestionable and\nself-evident. Nothing exists without a cause; and the original cause\nof this universe (whatever it be) we call GOD; and piously ascribe to\nhim every species of perfection. \u2026 But as all perfection is\nentirely relative, we ought never to imagine, that we comprehend the\nattributes of this divine Being, or to suppose, that his perfections\nhave any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature.\n(D,2.3/142)\n\n\nIn this way, it is Philo\u2019s position that all we know about God\nis that he exists (qua cause of the universe) but beyond this we have\nno idea or understanding of his nature or attributes. \u201cOur\nideas\u201d, says Philo, \u201creach no further than experience: We\nhave no experience of divine attributes and operations: I need not\nconclude my syllogism: You can draw the inference yourself.\u201d The\nconclusion is that God\u2019s nature is \u201cadorably mysterious\nand incomprehensible.\u201d (D,2.4/143)\n\nPhilo\u2019s sceptical challenge is met by Cleanthes, who has the\nrole in the Dialogues of presenting and defending the\nargument from design.\n\nLook around the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You\nwill find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an\ninfinite number of lesser machines\u2026 All these various machines,\nand even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an\naccuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever\ncontemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, exceeds the\nproductions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom,\nand intelligence. Since, therefore the effects resemble each other, we\nare led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also\nresemble; and that the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the\nmind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties,\nproportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. (D,\n2.5/143 \u2014 our emphasis)\n\n\nThe structure of this argument seems clear. (1) There is an analogy or\nresemblance between the world and man-made machines in respect of\ntheir shared features of order, structure, harmony and the evident way\nthat their parts are suited to perform some function or serve certain\nends. (2) When we discover an object that has these features (i.e.\norder, structure, harmony, etc.) we infer that these objects have not\njust come together by chance. For example, if we discover a watch or a\nhouse our experience leads us to believe \u201cthat there is an\noriginal principle of order in mind, not in matter\u201d (D,\n2.14/146; cp. EU, 4.4/26; 5.7/45). (3) The principle that guides this\ninference is that similar effects must arise from similar causes. (4)\nIt follows from these premises that we can (rationally) infer the\nexistence of God and \u201chis similarity to human mind and\nintelligence\u201d (D, 2.5/143).\n\nPhilo maintains that this argument, although methodologically sound in\nso far as it is based on experience and not on a priori reasoning,\nnevertheless falls well short of what it claims to prove. The first\npoint that Philo draws our attention to is the weakness of the analogy\nbetween the world and \u201chuman productions\u201d. When there is a\nclose resemblance or \u201cexact similarity\u201d among objects then\nwe may infer a similar cause.\n\nThe exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect assurance of a\nsimilar event; and a stronger evidence is never desired nor sought\nafter. But wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of\nthe cases, you diminish proportionably the evidence: and may at last\nbring it to a very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error\nand uncertainty. (D, 2.7/144; cp. T, 1.3.12.25/142)\n\n\nThe importance of this for the argument from design is clear. The gap\nbetween human artifacts and the whole universe is \u201cvast\u201d\n(D, 2.8/144, 12.6/216\u20137, 12.33/227). Any resemblance or\nsimilarity of this kind is so remote and slight that all reasoning on\nthis basis is \u201cboth uncertain and useless\u201d (EU, 11.23\n/142). When we use analogies that are this weak and imperfect then\nonly doubt and uncertainty can result (D, 2.17/147,5.1/165; T,\n1.3.12.25/142).\n\nIn order to bring out the particular difficulties of the argument from\ndesign, and the way in which it has only the fa\u00e7ade of ordinary\nexperimental reasoning, Hume suggests the analogy of a house. When we\nsee a house we naturally and reasonably conclude (i.e., with moral\ncertainty) that \u201cit had an architect or builder; because this is\nprecisely that species of effect, which we have experienced to proceed\nfrom that species of cause\u201d (D, 2.8/144). When we consider the\nuniverse, however, things are very different. In this case, we have\nexperience of a unique effect: the universe. Moreover, our experience\nof this effect is limited to a small part or a \u201cnarrow\ncorner\u201d of it \u2014 from which we must make conjectures about\nthe whole. Beyond this, we have no experience at all of its cause.\nClearly, then, in a case of this kind we have no experience of\n\u201ctwo species of objects\u201d that are constantly conjoined on\nthe basis of which we may draw some (reliable) inference (EU,\n11.30/148; D, 2.24/149\u201350).\n\nThe contrast between ordinary cases of inference (e.g., house to human\nbuilder) and the design argument may be illustrated this way.\n\n\n\nX\n=\ncauses (builders, architects, etc.) \n\nY\n=\neffects (houses) \n\n\n\n1. \nY1 ---- X1\n \n\n2. \nY2 ---- X2\n \n\n3. \nY3 ---- X3\n\u2026 \n\n*. \nYn /\n[Xn]\n? \n\n\n\nIn this case our experience of the constant conjunction of\nXs/Ys enables us\nto draw the inference to\nXn, the unobserved cause\nof Yn. Our experience is\nof a series of conjunctions (1,2,3) where there is a\nclose resemblance within each species of objects (i.e., among\nXs and among Ys).\nWe have direct experience of both kinds of objects (i.e.,\nboth Xs and Ys). In the\ncase of the design argument our inference has this form.\n\n\n\nZ\n=\ncause (God/creator) \n\nW\n=\neffect (world/universe) \n\n\n* <W> / [Z*]\n?\n\n\nWe have experience of only one W\n(i.e., our experience of W is unique). Our\nexperience of W is partial and\nincomplete (hence <W>), since\nwe know only a small part of it in both spacial and temporal terms. We\nhave no experience of any Zs at\nall. In these circumstances the only basis for drawing any conclusion\nabout the nature of Z* from our (unique and\npartial) experience of W is by supposing\nthat W bears some resemblance to objects\nsuch as Ys, broadly conceived to cover all\nhuman artifacts and productions. There is, however, a vast difference\nbetween these effects. It follows that there is little or no basis for\nassuming that Z resembles something like\nXs (i.e., human mind or intelligence).\nGod\u2019s nature, therefore, remains altogether \u201cmysterious\nand incomprehensible\u201d from the point of view of human\nunderstanding.\n\nCleanthes responds to this set of objections with a counter-example\nthat is meant to discredit these criticisms and doubts. Suppose we\nheard an articulate voice coming from the clouds and the words uttered\ncontain a message instructing us in a way that is worthy of a great,\nsuperior being. It is not possible, Cleanthes argues, that we would\nhesitate for a moment to ascribe some design or purpose to the cause of this voice\nand conclude that it bears some resemblance to the intelligent source\nof a human voice (D, 3.2\u20133/152\u20133). The situation is not so\ndissimilar as \u201cwhen we hear an articulate voice in the dark and\nthence infer a man\u201d (D, 3.3/152; cp. EU, 4.4/27). According to\nCleanthes, it is similarly perverse and unnatural to deny that the\nvarious parts of the body and the way in which they are suited to our\nenvironment (e.g., legs for walking) are \u201cincontestable proof of\ndesign and intention\u201d (D, 3.8/155; cp. 2.9/144\u20135).\n\nThe fundamental difficulty with Cleanthes\u2019s example is, however,\nthat it suggests a non-traditional, anthropomorphic conception of\nGod\u2019s nature that cannot be overcome other than by arbitrary\nstipulation. Given the nature of the analogy, how are we to understand\nthe nature of God\u2019s mind? Does it have successive, distinct\nthoughts? If so, what sense can we make of God\u2019s simplicity and\nimmutability (D, 4.3/159)? Why should we not assume that God has other\nhuman features such as passions and sentiments, or physical features\nsuch as a mouth or eyes (D, 3.13/156, 5.11/168)? In all cases that we\nhave experience of, human intelligence is embodied, so why not also\nassume that God has a body (D, 6.4\u20135/171\u20132)? What this\nplainly manifests is that the anthropomorphic conception of God, as\ndefended by Cleanthes, reflects an egocentric outlook and delusions\nabout the significance of human life in the universe.\n\nAny experimental reasoning of the kind that the argument from design\nemploys must ensure that the cause is proportioned to the effect. That\nis to say, we cannot \u201cascribe to the cause any qualities, but\nwhat are exactly sufficient to produce them\u201d (EU,\n11.12\u20133/136; D, 5.8/168). If we follow this principle, however,\nwe are no longer in a position to assign several fundamental\nattributes to God. We cannot, for example, attribute any thing\ninfinite to God based on our observation and experience of finite\neffects. Nor can we attribute unity to the original cause of the\nuniverse on the basis of any analogy to human artifacts such as\nhouses; as they are often built by a number of people working\ntogether. Perhaps, therefore, there is more than one God involved in\nthe creation of the universe? More importantly, we are in no position\nto attribute perfection to God unless we observe perfection in his\ncreation. Since there are evidently \u201cmany inexplicable\ndifficulties in the works of nature\u201d we are not justified in\nmaking any inference of this kind (D, 5.6/166\u20137).\n\nThe mistake that Hume particularly warns against, in respect of the\nissue of God\u2019s perfection, is that we cannot begin from the\nassumption that God is perfect, then assume that his creation is\nworthy of him, and then argue, on this basis, that we have evidence\nthat God is perfect.\n\nYou find certain phenomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You\nimagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamored of\nthis offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he\nmust produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene\nof things, which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this\nsuperlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or,\nat least, without any foundation in reason; and that you have no\nground to ascribe to him any qualities, but what you see he has\nactually exerted and displayed in his productions. (EU, 11.15/\n137\u20138)\n\n\nThis problem is, of course, most acute when it comes to the\n\u201creality of evil\u201d that we observe in the world. How do we\nvindicate God\u2019s \u201cinfinite power and goodness\u201d when\nwe are faced with overwhelming evidence of (unnecessary and\ninexplicable) evil in the world? What we cannot do, Hume argues, is\nexplain away all evidence of this kind by way of assuming that this\nworld is the perfect creation of a perfect being. It is this\nassumption that needs to be established, so we must not assume it in\nour reasoning.\n\nHume\u2019s aim, in this context, is not to argue that it is\nimpossible that God is perfect but only that we are in no position to\ninfer this unless our experience of this world, which is the sole\nsource of our evidence concerning this issue, is both sufficiently\ncomprehensive and uniformly consistent with the hypothesis. Plainly,\nhowever, it is neither. It follows from this that many other\nhypotheses and conjectures, consistent with the evidence presented,\nmay be considered as no less plausible. Philo puts this point to\nCleanthes:\n\nIn a word, Cleanthes, a man who follows your hypothesis is able,\nperhaps, to assert, or conjecture, that the universe, sometime, arose\nfrom something like design: But beyond that position he cannot\nascertain one single circumstance, and is left afterwards to fix\nevery point of his theology, by the utmost license of fancy and\nhypothesis. (D, 5.12/169 \u2014 our emphasis)\n\n\nPhilo goes on to suggest that, for all we know, this world \u201cis\nvery faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior standard\u201d.\nGiven this, we may also conjecture that this world was created by\n\u201csome infant Deity, who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his\nlame performance\u201d or it is \u201cthe production of old age and\ndotage in some superannuated Deity\u201d, and so on (D, 5.12/169).\nThe general point being made is that in the absence of clear evidence\nof perfection in this world we must \u201cproportion the cause to the\neffect\u201d and resist the temptation of \u201cexaggeration and\nflattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning\u201d (EU,\n11.14/137).\n\nHume\u2019s line of reasoning criticizing the argument from design\npresents theists with a basic and seemingly intractable dilemma in\nrespect of their idea of God. On the one hand, theists such as\nCleanthes want to insist that the analogy between this world and human\nproductions is not so slight and maintains, on this basis, that God in\nsome significant degree resembles human intelligence (D,\n3.7\u20138/154\u20135). The difficulty with this view, as we have\nseen, is that it leads to \u201ca degradation of the supreme\nbeing\u201d by way of an anthropomorphism which from the standpoint\nof traditional theism involves idolatry and is no better than atheism\n(D,2.15/146,3.12\u20133/156, 4.4\u20135/160, 5.11/168). On the other\nhand, if we follow mystics, such as Demea, we end up no better off\nthan sceptics and atheists who claim that we know nothing of\nGod\u2019s nature and attributes and that everything about him is\n\u201cunknown and unintelligible\u201d (D, 4.1/158). Hume\u2019s\nsceptical technique in the Dialogues, therefore, is to play\none group of theists off against the other, showing that both their\npositions end up as nothing better or different from the atheism that\nthey both claim to abhor.\n\nOn the interpretation provided, it is clear that Hume\u2019s critique\nof the argument from design is deep and radical. There are, however,\nseveral passages in the final Part of the Dialogues (XII)\nthat suggest that Philo (Hume) reverses or at least moderates his\nposition \u2014 making some significant concessions to\nCleanthes\u2019s position. The most important evidence of this\nappears in a passage at the beginning of Part XII where Philo says\nthat no one can be so stupid as to reject the view that there are\nsigns of intention and design in this world and that it is evident, as\nCleanthes has argued, \u201cthat the works of nature bear a great\nanalogy to the productions of art\u201d (D, 12.6/216\u20137\n\u2014 my emphasis). Immediately after this, however, Philo proceeds\nto reverse his reversal (i.e., he performs a double-reversal). He\ninsists, in particular, on the verbal or trivial nature of the whole\ndispute about whether we should call God a \u201cmind\u201d or\n\u201cintelligence\u201d and emphasizes, once again, \u201cthe\nvast difference, which may reasonably be supposed between him\nand human minds\u201d (D, 12.6/216\u20137 \u2014 my emphasis). In\nan especially important passage, which was inserted into the\nDialogues shortly before Hume died, Philo elaborates on his\nview. The truly pious, he argues, will acknowledge \u201cthat there\nis a great and immeasurable, because\nincomprehensible, difference between the human and the\ndivine mind\u201d (D, 12.7/218 \u2014 my emphasis). On the\nother hand, the atheist may allow that there is some \u201cremote\nanalogy\u201d among the various operations of nature, including\n\u201cthe rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and the\nstructure of human thought\u201d (D, 12.7/218). In other words, the\natheist can concede that there is some remote analogy between the\nfirst principle of the universe and several other parts of\nnature\u2014only one of which is human thought and mind (D, 12.7/218;\nand cp. 7.1/176\u20137). Hume\u2019s point is that there are other\nanalogies that are no less plausible than that which Cleanthes has\nsuggested. These other analogies do not suggest that the cause of this\nworld is something like mind or human intelligence. Clearly, then, the\natheist may concede that there is some remote analogy between God and\nhuman minds and still insist that there remain other analogies and\nhypotheses that are no less plausible. The conclusion to be drawn from\nthis is that all such analogies are so weak and \u201cremote\u201d\nthat God\u2019s nature remains an \u201cinexplicable mystery\u201d\nwell beyond the scope of human understanding (D, 12.33/227; cp. NHR,\n15.13).\n\nHume never retreats from the view stated in the first Enquiry\nthat God (i.e., the cause of the world) is \u201ca Being, so remote\nand incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being\nin the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers\nhimself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no\nauthority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection\u201d (EU,\n11.27/146). This position is indistinguishable from the scepticism\nthat Hume\u2019s contemporaries associated with Hobbes\u2019s\nperceived atheism. \n",
