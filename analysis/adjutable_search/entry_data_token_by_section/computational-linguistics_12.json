    "main_text": "Semantic interpretation || Subordinating the role of syntax\n4.2 Subordinating the role of syntax\n\nAt this point we should pause to consider some interpretive methods\nthat do not conform with the above very common but not universally\nemployed syntax-driven approach. First, Schank and his collaborators\nemphasized the role of lexical knowledge, especially primitive actions\nused in verb decomposition, and knowledge about stereotyped patterns\nof behavior  in the interpretive process, nearly to the exclusion\nof syntax. For example, a sentence beginning \n\u201cJohn went \u2026\u201d would lead to the generation of\na ptrans conceptualization (since go is lexically\ninterpreted in terms of ptrans), where John fills the\nagent role and where a phrase interpretable as a location is expected,\nas part of the configuration of roles that attach to\na ptrans act. If the sentence then continues as\n\u201c\u2026 to the restaurant\u201d, the expectation is\nconfirmed, and at this point instantiation of a restaurant script is\ntriggered, creating expectations about the likely sequence of actions\nby John and other agents in the restaurant (e.g., Schank and Abelson\n1977). These ideas had considerable appeal, and led to unprecedented\nsuccesses in machine understanding of some paragraph-length stories.\nAnother approach to interpretation that subordinates syntax to\nsemantics is one that employs domain-specific semantic grammars (Brown\nand Burton 1975). While these resemble context-free syntactic grammars\n(perhaps procedurally implemented in ATN-like manner), their\nconstituents are chosen to be meaningful in the chosen application\ndomain. For example, an electronics tutoring system might employ\ncategories such as measurement, hypothesis,\nor transistor instead of NP, and fault-specification\nor voltage-specification instead of VP.  The importance of\nthese approaches lay in their recognition of the fact that knowledge\npowerfully shapes our  ultimate interpretation of text and\ndialogue, enabling understanding even in the presence of noisy,\nflawed, and partial linguistic input. Nonetheless, most of the \nNL understanding community since the 1970s has treated syntactic\nparsing as an important aspect of the understanding process, in part\nbecause modularization of this complex process is thought to be\ncrucial for scalability, and in part because of the very plausible\nChomskian contention that human syntactic intuitions operate reliably\neven in the absence of clear meaning, as in his famous sentence\n\u201cColorless green ideas sleep furiously\u201d.\nStatistical NLP has only recently begun to be concerned with\nderiving interpretations usable for inference and question answering\n(and as pointed out in the previous subsection, some of the literature\nin this area assumes that the NL text itself can and should be used\nas the basis for inference). However, there have been some noteworthy\nefforts to build statistical semantic parsers that learn to produce\nLFs after training on a corpus of LF-annotated sentences, or a corpus\nof questions and answers (or other exchanges) where the learning is\n\u201cgrounded\u201d in a database or other supplementary models. We\nwill mention examples of this type of work, and comment on its\nprospects, in section 8.\n",
