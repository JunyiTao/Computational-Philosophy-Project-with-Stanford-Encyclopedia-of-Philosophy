    "main_text": "Composite Systems || Ramifications\n7.3 Ramifications\n\nThe thrust of these no-go results is that straightforward\nconstructions of plausible models for composite systems destroy\nregularity conditions (ortho-coherence in the case of the\nFoulis-Randall result, orthomodularity and the covering law in that of\nAerts\u2019 result) that have widely been used to underwrite\nreconstructions of the usual quantum-mechanical formalism. This puts\nin doubt whether any of these conditions can be regarded as having the\nuniversality that the most optimistic version of Mackey\u2019s\nprogramme asks for. Of course, this does not rule out the possibility\nthat these conditions may yet be motivated in the case of especially\nsimple physical systems.\n\nIn some quarters, the fact that the most traditional models of quantum\nlogics lack a reasonable tensor product have have been seen as\nheralding the collapse of the entire quantum-logical enterprise. This\nreaction is premature. The Foulis-Randall example, for instance, shows\nthat there can be no general tensor product that behaves properly on\nall orthomodular lattices or orthomodular posets (that is,\northocoherent orthoalgebras), and on all states\nthereon. But this does not rule out the existence of a satisfactory tensor\nproduct for classes of structures larger than that of\northomodular posets, or smaller than that of orthomodular\nlattices, or for classes of orthomodular lattices or posets with\nrestricted state spaces. Quantum Mechanics itself provides one example. \nFor another, as Foulis and Randall showed in\nFoulis and Randall [1981a], the class of unital\northoalgebras\u2014that is, orthoalgebras in which every proposition\nhas probability 1 in some state\u2014does support a\ncanonical tensor product satisfying their conditions (a) and (b).  \n\nMoving in the opposite direction, one can take it as an axiomatic\nrequirement that a satisfactory physical theory be closed under some\nreasonable device for coupling separated systems. This suggests taking\nclasses of systems, i.e., physical theories, as distinct from\nindividual systems, as the focus of attention. And in fact, this is\nexactly the trend in much current work on the foundations of quantum\nmechanics. \n\nA particularly fruitful approach of this kind, due to Abramsky and\nCoecke [2009] takes a physical theory to be represented by a symmetric\nmonoidal category\u2014roughly, a category equipped with a naturally\nsymmetric and associative tensor product. Subject to some further\nconstraints (e.g., compact closure), such categories exhibit formal\nproperties strikingly reminiscent of quantum mechanics. Interestingly,\nit has recently been shown by Harding [2009] that, in every strongly\ncompact closed category with biproducts, every object is associated\nwith an orthomodular poset Proj\\((A)\\) of \u201cweak\nprojections\u201d, and that Proj\\((A \\otimes B)\\) behaves in many\nrespects as a sensible tensor product for Proj\\((A)\\) and Proj\\((B)\\).\nFrom this perspective, the FR example simply exhibits a pathological\nexample \u2014 \\(A_5\\) and the state \\(\\alpha\\) \u2014 that can not\nbe accommodated in such a theory, establishing that the monoidality\nrequirement imposes a nontrivial restriction on the structure of\nindividual systems.\n\n\nThis recent emphasis on systems in interaction is part of a more\ngeneral shift of attention away from the static structure of states\nand observables and towards the processes in which physical\nsystems can participate. This trend is evident not only in the\ncategory-theoretic formulation of Abramsky and Coecke (see also Coecke\n[2011]), but also in several recent axiomatic reconstructions of\nquantum theory (e.g., Hardy [2001, Other Internet Resources], Rau\n[2009], Dakic-Brukner [2011], Massanes and Mueller [2011],\nChiribella-D\u2019Ariano-Perinotti [2011], Wilce [2018]), most of\nwhich involve assumptions about how physical systems combine. In a\ndifferent direction, Baltag and Smets [2005] enrich a Piron-style\nlattice-theoretic framework with an explicitly dynamical element,\narriving at a quantum analogue of propositional dynamical logic.\n",
