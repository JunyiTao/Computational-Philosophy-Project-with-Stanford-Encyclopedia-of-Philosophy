    "main_text": "Physical Theory || Principles and Mixture\n2.3 Principles and Mixture\n\nFundamental to Stoic physics and the explanations of natural phenomena\nit offers are the two principles (archai), the active\nprinciple and the passive principle, which bear complex and often\ndebated relations to pneuma, primary matter, the four\nelements (air, water, fire, earth), and the cosmos as a whole. These\nterms appear to be used in different senses in the surviving\nfragmentary evidence, making the task of reconstructing a coherent and\nunified physical theory somewhat challenging.\n\nThe active and passive principles together make up the world and\neverything in it. To achieve this, the active principle, which is\nidentified with God or Zeus (see\n 2.7\n for further discussion of Stoic theology), acts on the passive\nprinciple, which is also called (at least by Zeno) primary matter.\nPrimary matter is eternal, unqualified, formless, and inert. Primary\nmatter is suffused throughout by the active principle in order to\ncreate objects in the world. The active and the passive principles in\nthis way both constitute the cosmos and all objects in it. The Stoics\nstressed that they are entirely blended, or mixed \u201cthrough and\nthrough\u201d (Galen, 47H; Alexander of Aphrodisias, 48C), and\ndeveloped a theory of mixture which allowed for two bodies to be in\nthe same place at the same time (Hensley 2018; cf. Helle 2018 and\n2022).\n\nThe vehicle for the divine active principle is called pneuma,\nliterally \u201cbreath\u201d (Hensley 2020). Pneuma, by its\nnature, has a simultaneous movement inward and outward which\nconstitutes its inherent \u201ctensility\u201d. Pneuma\npasses through all (other) bodies; in its outward motion it gives them\nthe qualities that they have, and in its inward motion makes them\nunified objects (Nemesius, 47J; cf. Helle 2021). Pneuma comes\nin gradations and endows the bodies which it pervades with different\nqualities as a result. The pneuma which sustains an inanimate\nobject is a \u201ctenor\u201d (hexis, lit. \u201ca\nholding\u201d). Pneuma in plants is, in addition,\n\u201cphysique\u201d (phusis, lit. \u201cnature\u201d),\nand in animals, it is \u201csoul\u201d (psuch\u00ea, see\n 2.9\n below). \n",
