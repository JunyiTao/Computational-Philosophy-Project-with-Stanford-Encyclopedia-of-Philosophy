    "main_text": "Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality || The Reformed Decision Theory Strategy\n3.3 The Reformed Decision Theory Strategy\n\nIn contrast to the inseparable goods and social sanctions strategies\nthat question the Foole\u2019s characterization of the scenarios that\ngive rise to a tension between morality and rationality, the\nreformed decision theory strategy recommends that agents like\nthe Foole revisit their understanding of rational choice. In\nparticular it proposes an account of rational choice that is more\nsubtle than the orthodox Bayesian account according to which rational\nchoice is a fairly straightforward matter of maximizing expected\nutility. David Gauthier (1986) and Edward McClennen (1990) are the\nmost prominent exemplars of this approach, with Gauthier proposing a\nprinciple of constrained maximization and McClennen a\nprinciple of resolute choice. For ease of exposition we focus\non Gauthier.\n\nIn Morals by Agreement Gauthier distinguishes between\nstraightforward maximizers and constrained\nmaximizers. A straightforward maximizer is an orthodox Bayesian\nwho, at any given moment in time, chooses so as to maximize her\nexpected utility given her beliefs regarding the relevant states of\naffairs and the choices her counterparts might make. A constrained\nmaximizer, on the other hand, departs from orthodox Bayesian reasoning\nby doing her part to bring about a fair and optimal outcome if (i) she\nexpects her counterparts to do their part in bringing about this\noutcome, and (ii) she benefits as a result of all following it. A\nconstrained maximizer thus constrains her pursuit of her interests\nsome of the time, but reverts to straightforward maximization if she\nexpects her counterparts to act as straightforward maximizers, or if\nshe does not stand to benefit from constraining her behavior relative\nto the scenario where no one constrains their behavior.\n\nFor example, if Claudia is a constrained maximizer, then in the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma depicted in\n Figure 5\n Claudia will perform if she believes Laura is also a constrained\nmaximizer, but will anticipate if she believes Laura is a\nstraightforward maximizer. One way to understand how constrained\nmaximization modifies an agent\u2019s behavior is to regard adopting\none\u2019s principle of rationality as a meta-strategy for engaging\nin prisoner\u2019s dilemma-like games. If Claudia and Laura each\nadopt either the straightforward maximizer (SM) or the\nconstrained maximizer (CM) meta-strategy, then the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma depicted in\n Figure 5\n is transformed into the game depicted in\n Figure 6\n below.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nParty 2 (Laura) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCM\nSM  \n\n\nParty 1 (Claudia)\nCM\n(2,2)\n(1,1) \n\nSM\n(1,1)\n(1,1)  \n\n\nCM= constrained maximization, SM = straightforward\nmaximization\n\nFigure 6. Meta-Strategy Game for\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\n\nHere, whatever strategy the other party follows, one always does at\nleast as well and sometimes better by following CM as opposed\nto SM. That is, CM is a weakly dominant\nstrategy for both Claudia and Laura, and (CM, CM) is\nthe unique Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium. Gauthier argues that there\nare a wide variety of social dilemmas where constrained maximizers\nfare at least as well as straightforward maximizers, and can often\nfare strictly better, so long as agents\u2019 dispositions towards\nconstrained or straightforward maximization are sufficiently clear to\neach other. Accordingly, Gauthier concludes that agents should adopt\nthe constrained maximization principle, and that, when they do,\ncompliance with the requirements of morality coincides with rational\nchoice.\n",
