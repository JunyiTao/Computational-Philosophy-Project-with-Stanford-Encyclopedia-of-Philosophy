Introduction\n\n\nDisjunctivists and their opponents agree that veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations have something in common, in so far as\nthey agree that such mental events should be grouped together as being\nperceptual experiences. They also agree that there are differences to\nbe marked between them, hence the different labels for them. However,\nthey disagree when it comes to specifying what these commonalities and\ndifferences consist in. What distinguishes the disjunctivist theory is\nits rejection of a \u2018common kind claim\u2019\u2014the claim\nthat the conscious perceptual experiences that are involved in cases\nof veridical perception, illusion and hallucination have the same\nnature. If one accepts that the same kind of conscious experience\noccurs in all three cases, then this imposes a constraint on the\naccount one can give of the kind of conscious event that occurs when one\nveridically perceives the world.  Disjunctivists deny that our\naccounts of veridical perception should be constrained in this way. So\nthe disjunctivist view of perceptual experience can be regarded as a\nnegative thesis\u2014the rejection of a common kind claim\u2014that\nis adopted in defence of a positive view of veridical perception.\n\n\nThose who hold a disjunctive theory of perception do not deny that\nit is possible to have a hallucination of an F that is subjectively\nindistinguishible from a veridical perception of an F. That is, they do\nnot deny that it is possible for one to have a hallucination such that\none cannot tell through introspection alone that it is not a veridical\nperception of an F. So associated with the disjunctivist\u2019s\nmetaphysical stance, namely the rejection of the common kind claim, is\nan epistemological proposal that emphasises limitations on a\nsubject\u2019s capacity to tell what kind of experience she is\nundergoing on the basis of introspection alone. For example, J.M.\nHinton, an early proponent of the disjunctive theory,\nacknowledges that both a hallucination of an F and a veridical\nperception of an F can appear, from the inside, to be a veridical\nperception of an F. However, he holds that it is a mistake to assume\nthat this appearance is to be explained by the thesis that these\nexperiences share a common nature that is manifest to one when has the\nexperiences.\n\n\nHinton is generally credited with being the first to demarcate clearly\nthe disjunctivist stance, and the fact that the disjunctive theory of\nperception is so named is due to his way of framing the view. Hinton\n(1967 and 1973) argued that we should understand a statement about how\nthings sensorily appear to a subject to be equivalent to a disjunctive\nstatement that either one is veridically perceiving such and\nsuch or one is suffering an illusion (or hallucination); and\nsuch statements are not to be regarded as making a report about a\ndistinctive mental event or state that is common to these disjoint\nsituations. (For discussion of the historical significance of Hinton,\nsee Snowdon 2008). The disjunctive approach to perceptual experience\nwas later developed by Paul Snowdon (1980\u201381), John McDowell\n(1982), and M.G.F. Martin (2002), among others.\n2. Varieties of Disjunctivism\n\n\nThere are some significant differences between some of the views that\nfall under the disjunctivist label. Disjunctivists are united in their\nrejection of a common kind claim, and they generally adopt this stance\nbecause they hold views about the nature of veridical perception that\nthey take to be inconsistent with it. However, not all disjunctivists\nare in agreement over the account that should be given of veridical\nperception, and not all disjunctivists are in agreement over the\nquestion of the accounts that should be given of hallucinations and\nillusions. The different disjunctivist proposals about illusion and\nhallucination are discussed in section 5. This section focuses on some\nof the main differences between the accounts that disjunctivists offer\nof the relevant features that they claim veridical perceptions have,\nand which they claim hallucinations lack.\n\n\nThe fact that there are some significant differences between some of\nthe views that fall under the disjunctivist label can introduce\ncomplications when it comes to trying to formulate more precisely a\ndistinctively disjunctivist commitment that is common to all\nof them. So first (in section 2.1) some further remarks are in order\nconcerning some of the different ways in which disjunctivism in\ngeneral has been formulated in the literature. When it comes to\nassessing arguments that are presented as being either for or against\ndisjunctivism it is obviously going to be important to be sensitive to\nthe question of which formulation of disjunctivism is in play. Given\nthat many who adopt a disjunctivist position do so in defence of a\nparticular account of veridical perception, it will also be important\nto assess which disjunctivist commitment, if any, is actually entailed\nby their view of the nature of veridical perception.\n2.1 Ways of Formulating Disjunctivism\n2.1.1 Fundamental Kind Disjunctivism\n\n\nDisjunctivists maintain that veridical perceptions and hallucinations\nare mental events (or states) of different kinds.  However, we need\nfurther clarification of what this claim amounts to, for there is an\nunderstanding of this claim that it may be open to a non-disjunctivist\nto accept as well. For example, the non-disjunctivist can accept that\nthe terms \u2018veridical perception\u2019 and\n\u2018hallucination\u2019 mark useful distinctions between\nperceptual experiences that may, in certain contexts, be of\nexplanatory significance. So the non-disjunctivist may agree that\nthere is a sense in which veridical perceptions and hallucinations can\nbe thought of as perceptual experiences of different kinds. For\nsimilar reasons the disjunctivist can agree that there is a sense in\nwhich veridical perceptions and hallucinations can be thought of as\nexperiences of the same kind. For disjunctivists do not in general\ndeny that veridical perceptions and hallucinations can\nhave anything in common.\n\n\nOne formulation of disjunctivism invokes the notion of a\nfundamental kind. (This formulation is principally due to\nMartin, but see also Snowdon 2005a, p. 136. For discussion of this\nformulation, see Logue 2013). According to this formulation, the\ndisjunctivist is committed to denying that veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations are conscious events of the same\nfundamental kind. The assumption here is that for mental\nevents, there is a most specific answer to the question, \u2018What is\nit?\u2019 that tells us what essentially the mental event is,\nand thereby specifies its fundamental kind. On this\nformulation, the disjunctivist is committed to denying that whatever\nfundamental kind of conscious event occurs when one is veridically\nperceiving the world, that kind of event can occur whether or not one\nis veridically perceiving. Let us call a view of this sort\nfundamental kind disjunctivism.\n\n\nWhile those who advocate this form of disjunctivism reject a common\nkind claim, namely the claim that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations are mental events of the same fundamental kind,\nthey may allow that veridical perceptions and hallucinations have\nsomething in common. So they may allow that there is a kind K that\nveridical perceptions and hallucinations can both instantiate. However, what\nthey deny is that such a kind K is the fundamental kind of\nconscious event occurring when a subject veridically perceives the\nworld.\n\n\nNot all accept the metaphysical assumption that mental events (or\nstates) have a \u2018fundamental\u2019 kind. A disjunctive theory of\nperception is often adopted in defence of a particular account of\nveridical perception, such as na\u00efve realism, and Byrne and Logue\n(2008) question whether any controversial claim about fundamental kinds\nis needed in order to defend a na\u00efve realist view of veridical\nperception. They suggest that one may hold a na\u00efve realist view\naccording to which mind-independent objects, such as tables and trees,\nare constituents of the experience one has when one veridically\nperceives the world, without being committed to a further claim about\nwhat the essence of such episodes consists in. They also note\nthat na\u00efve realism is often motivated by phenomenological\nconsiderations, and they question whether introspective reflection on\nthe phenomenology of the experience one has when one veridically\nperceives the world puts one in a position to learn anything about the\nessence of the experience one is having.\n2.1.2 The \u2018Distinct Mental Feature\u2019 Formulation\n\n\nThose who reject the metaphysical assumption that mental events (or\nstates) have a \u2018fundamental\u2019 kind may instead formulate\ntheir disjunctivist stance in terms of the claim that the differences\nbetween the kind of mental event that occurs when one veridically\nperceives the world and the kind of mental event that occurs when one\nhallucinates are due to differences in mental features of\nthe events in question. The thought here is that the fact that there\nis a respect in which two mental events (or states) are different may\nnot be due to the fact that they differ in some mental respect, and\nwhile we might type mental events and states in a variety of different\nways, for a variety of different purposes, we can distinguish a way of\nclassifying such events and states that focuses solely on their mental\nfeatures. For example, although there may be a context in which it\nsuits our purposes to group together the beliefs of a subject that are\ntrue, it is not generally thought that a belief\u2019s being true is a\nmental feature of that state.\n\n\nAccording to this alternative way of formulating disjunctivism, the\ndisjunctivist holds that veridical perceptions and hallucinations\ndiffer mentally in some significant respect\u2014i.e., there are\ncertain mental features that veridical perceptions have that\nhallucinations cannot have. So the disjunctivist rejects the claim\nthat the differences between a case of veridical perception and a case\nof hallucination can simply be due to differences in the extra-mental\nstates of affairs that obtain in those situations. Note, however, that\nthis formulation of the disjunctivist commitment leaves open the\npossibility that veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have at\nleast some mental features in common. (See Logue 2012a, 2013,\nand 2014.) There is a sense, then, in which it thereby leaves open the\npossibility that there can be a common mental element to veridical\nperception and hallucination.\n2.1.3 The \u2018No-Common-Mental-Element\u2019 Formulation\n\n\nByrne and Logue (2008) propose that the label \u2018metaphysical\ndisjunctivism\u2019 be reserved for an account of perceptual\nexperience that commits to the claim there is\nno common mental element to veridical perception and\nhallucination. According to Byrne and Logue, those who deny that veridical\nperceptions and hallucinations are mental events of the same\nfundamental kind (see section 2.1) are not thereby\ncommitted to \u2018metaphysical disjunctivism\u2019, as\nByrne and Logue use this label. For as they point out, those who reject\nthe claim that veridical perceptions and hallucinations are mental\nevents of the same fundamental kind need not deny that there is a\ncommon mental element to veridical perception and hallucination. So it\nis worth bearing in mind the particular use to which Byrne and Logue\nput the label \u2018metaphysical disjunctivism\u2019, as others would\nnaturally characterise fundamental kind disjunctivism as a metaphysical\ndisjunctivist thesis.\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the issue of how precisely to formulate a\ndistinctively disjunctivist commitment is not\nuncontroversial.  For now we can at least say that the minimal\ncommitment of a view that can be labelled a disjunctivist theory of\nperception is that veridical perceptions and hallucinations differ\nmentally in some significant respect\u2014i.e., there are certain\nmental features that veridical perceptions have that hallucinations\ncannot have. So we can mark some of the differences between views that\nfall under the disjunctivist label by invoking the notion of\n\u2018disjunctivism about X\u2019, where X is the\nrelevant mental feature that it is claimed differs in cases of\nveridical perception and hallucination. This procedure is adopted in\nthe following two sections. If the disjunctivist about X\nmakes the additional claim that the particular mental\nfeature, X, that is unique to the case of veridical\nperception is essential to the fundamental kind of mental event it is,\nthen they will also be a fundamental kind disjunctivist. Furthermore,\nif they deny that there is a common mental element to veridical\nperception and hallucination they will satisfy the\n\u2018no-common-mental-element\u2019 formulation of disjunctivism.\n2.2 Disjunctivism about Intentional Content\n\n\nAccording to an intentionalist account of perceptual experience, our\nperceptual experiences are mental events (or states) with intentional\ncontents that represent the world as being a certain way. The\ndisjunctivist who accepts this general approach to perceptual\nexperience may hold that a veridical perception has an intentional\ncontent that a hallucination cannot have. For example this sort of\ndisjunctivist may hold that the intentional content of a veridical\nperception is constitutively dependent on mind-independent objects,\nwhile the intentional content of a hallucination is not.\n\n\nOne route to this view proceeds through the claims that a veridical\nperception of the world is a perceptual state with an intentional\ncontent containing demonstrative elements that refer to the\nmind-independent items in the environment that are perceived, and that\ntruth-evaluable intentional contents with demonstrative elements that\nsuccessfully refer are object-dependent. On this view, a particular\nexperience E that is a veridical perception of a particular\nmind-independent object O will have an intentional content\nwith a demonstrative element that successfully refers to O,\nand a distinct particular experience E* will have\nan intentional content with the same veridicality conditions only if\nits intentional content contains a demonstrative element that also\nrefers to O. If E* is a hallucination it\nwill not have an intentional content with a demonstrative element that\nsuccessfully refers to O, so it will not have an intentional\ncontent with the same veridicality conditions as E. Suppose\nwe now add the following assumption: If two experiences have\nintentional contents which differ in their veridicality conditions,\nthen this is not just a respect in which these mental events differ,\nit is also amounts to a difference in their mental kinds. We can now\nderive the conclusion that veridical perceptions and hallucinations\nare experiences of different mental kinds. This last assumption needs\nto be made explicit, as it is not agreed upon by all (e.g., Burge\n1993, 2005 and 2010). Note that acceptance of the assumption would\nalso commit one to the following claim: If E* is a\nveridical perception of numerically distinct object\nO*, then E and E* are\nto be regarded as experiences of different mental kinds even if\nO and O* are perceptually indiscernible\nto the subject who perceives them. (For discussion of the status of\nthat assumption, see Mehta 2014, Gomes and French 2016, Mehta and\nGarson 2016, and French and Gomes 2019).\n\n\nSomeone who holds this sort of view may claim that it is possible for\na veridical perception and a hallucination to have the same phenomenal\ncharacter. For they may claim that it is possible for experiences to\nhave the same phenomenal character despite the fact that they do not\nhave the same intentional content. According to the terminology that\nByrne and Logue adopt (see section 2.1.2) this would make the view\na moderate one. Someone adopting the moderate approach might\nclaim that hallucinations have an existentially quantified intentional\ncontent and veridical perceptions also have a layer of content that is\nexistential. They might then hold that this layer of existential\ncontent, which is present in experience whether or not one is\nveridically perceiving the world, provides a common mental factor for\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences.\n\n\nTye (2007) favours a different \u2018moderate\u2019 approach. He\nholds that veridical perceptions have object-dependent singular\nintentional contents that hallucinations cannot have, and he holds\nthat veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character. However, he rejects the claim that there is a\nlayer of existential content that provides a common mental factor for\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences. According to Tye, veridical\nperceptions and hallucinations have intentional contents that\nrepresent clusters of properties. In the case of veridical perception\nthe cluster of properties is represented within a content that is\nsingular and object-dependent, whereas in the case of hallucination\nthe cluster of properties is represented within a content that is\n\u2018gappy\u2019. (See also Schellenberg 2010, 2013, and 2016.)\nTye\u2019s suggestion is that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations have contents with a common structure, and this\nstructure may be conceived as having a slot in it for an object. In\nthe case of veridical perception the slot is filled by the object\nperceived, and in the case of hallucination the slot is empty, and\nhence the content is \u2018gappy\u2019. Tye claims that the\nphenomenal character of a given visual experience is the cluster of\nproperties represented by that experience. And he claims that this is\nwhy veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character.\n2.3 Disjunctivism about Phenomenal Character\n\n\nSome disjunctivists claim that veridical perceptions have a phenomenal\ncharacter that hallucinations cannot possess. For example, according\nto one version of na\u00efve realism (what we might call\n\u2018na\u00efve realism about phenomenal character\u2019), when one\nveridically perceives the world, the mind-independent items perceived,\nsuch as tables and trees and the properties they manifest to one when\nperceived, partly constitute one\u2019s conscious experience, and\nhence determine its phenomenal character. This sort of na\u00efve\nrealist view is primarily motivated by phenomenological considerations.\nThe suggestion is that this view best articulates how sensory\nexperience seems to us to be through introspective reflection.\nAccording to those who propose this form of na\u00efve realism one\ncannot provide an adequate account of the phenomenal character of\nveridical perception by simply appealing to the idea that such\nexperience has an intentional content that represents the world as\nbeing a certain way, even if one holds that the intentional content in\nquestion is object-dependent; nor can one provide an adequate account\nof the phenomenal character of veridical perception by simply adding to\nthis the claim that experience possesses further non-representational\nproperties that it could possess independently of whether any\nmind-independent objects are being perceived. The na\u00efve realist\nabout phenomenal character instead claims that the right account of the\nphenomenal character of veridical perception should appeal to the idea\nthat such experience relates to the mind-independent items perceived in\na non-representational manner. (The motivations for this view are\ndiscussed in section 3.3).\n\n\nSince this na\u00efve realist account of phenomenal character cannot\nbe applied to hallucination, those who propose it are committed to the\nclaim that the kind of phenomenally conscious experience that occurs when\none veridically perceives the world does not occur when one is\nhallucinating. These na\u00efve realists can accept that veridical\nperceptions of numerically distinct objects can have the same\nphenomenal character, but they deny that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations have the same phenomenal character. They must then say\nthat hallucinations that are subjectively indistinguishible from\nveridical perceptions do not have the kind of phenomenal character that\nintrospective reflection suggests. Some disjunctivists allow that some\nhallucinations that are subjectively indistinguishible from veridical\nperceptions have no phenomenal character (e.g., Fish 2008 and 2009; and\nsee also Sturgeon 2006 and 2008), but this is not a commitment of all\ndisjunctivists about phenomenal character. (For further discussion, see\nsection 5.1)\n2.4 Epistemological Disjunctivism\n\n\nSome disjunctivist views are primarily motivated by epistemological\nconsiderations, rather than phenomenological ones. According to one\napproach what is fundamental to the nature of a veridical perception is\nthe fact that it belongs to an epistemically distinguished class of\nperceptual experiences. Those advocating this form of disjunctivism\nplace emphasis on the idea that when one veridically perceives the\nworld one has a distinctive form of epistemic contact with the\nmind-independent world, and one\u2019s experience provides one with\ngrounds for making knowledgeable perceptual judgements about the\nmind-independent world that would be lacking if one were merely\nhallucinating. On this view it is a mistake to assume that the\nepistemic grounds that a veridical perception can provide one with for\nmaking judgements about the world are no better than the epistemic\ngrounds that are available to one when one has a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination. Moreover, according to this view, the\nepistemic difference between a veridical perception and a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination is not to be explained by simply citing\nfactors that are external to the subjective experiential state one is\nin when one veridically perceives the world. Rather, the epistemic\ndifference is due to the fact that the kind of subjective experiential\nstate one is in when one veridically perceives the world is not the\nsame as the kind of subjective experiential state one is in when one\nhas a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination.\n\n\nByrne and Logue (2008) and Snowdon (2005a) argue that that this sort\nof epistemologically motivated view need not preclude the idea that it\nis possible to identify a perceptual state that is common to veridical\nperception and hallucination. The suggestion is that one can accept the\nclaim that there is an epistemically distinguished category of\nexperiential state that can only obtain when one veridically perceives\nthe world, and yet one can consistently maintain that it is also\npossible to identify a kind of perceptual state, of which some positive\naccount can be given, which can obtain whether one is veridically\nperceiving the world, or merely having a subjectively indistinguishible\nhallucination. One can therefore be an epistemological disjunctivist\nwithout accepting metaphysical disjunctivism. However, note that if one\nholds that the epistemological feature that is present in the case of\nveridical perception and lacking in the case of hallucination is\nfundamental to the kind of mental state it is, then this would make one\na fundamental kind disjunctivist (see section 2.1.1).\n\n\nJohn McDowell is an epistemological disjunctivist and some have\nsuggested that the view he espouses does not commit him to\nmetaphysical disjunctivism. (For discussion of this claim see Snowdon\n2005a, Byrne and Logue 2008, and Haddock and McPherson 2008b). Millar\n(2007 and 2008) explicitly endorses the claim that we should accept a\nform of epistemological disjunctivism about perceptual knowledge\nwithout being committed to metaphysical disjunctivism. (For more\ngeneral discussion of epistemological disjunctivism, see Pritchard\n2012, and see also the papers collected in Doyle, Milburn and\nPritchard 2019).\n3. Arguments for Disjunctivism\n3.1 An Argument for Disjunctivism as the Default View\n\n\nWhen J.M. Hinton first introduced discussion of the disjunctive view\nof experience his primary concern was to identify and undermine what\nhe took to be a substantive assumption in much philosophical\ntheorising about perception. His target was the assumption that\nveridical perception and subjectively indistinguishible hallucination\nhave the same intrinsic nature. In particular, his target was the\nassumption that the fact that a hallucination can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from a veridical perception is to be explained by\nthe thesis that these experiences share a common nature that is\nmanifest to one when has the experiences. Hinton does not try to prove\ndirectly that this \u2018common element\u2019 assumption is\nfalse. Instead, he tries to argue that it is unwarranted, and that his\nalternative, disjunctivist approach to perceptual experience should be\nour default view. M.G.F. Martin has also argued that the disjunctive\naccount of experience should be our default view. Martin\u2019s\nargument to this effect is discussed in section 3.3. This section\nfocuses on Hinton\u2019s version of the argument.\n\n\nHinton (1967 and 1973) develops his disjunctivist view by focusing on\nthe kinds of reports we make about an experience we are undergoing\nwhen we are remaining neutral on the question of whether that\nexperience is a veridical perception, an illusion, or a\nhallucination. For example, when making a report about one\u2019s\nexperience in this neutral way one might say \u2018I seem to see\nan F\u2019, which can be true whether or not one is actually\nseeing an F, or one might make a claim about what appears to\none to be the case. Hinton thinks that those who accept the common\nelement assumption will hold that these \u2018Neutral Experience\nReports\u2019 are used to pick out the intrinsic properties of\none\u2019s experience, which are manifest to one simply in virtue of\nhaving the experience, and which the experience could possess whether\nor not one actually perceives anything. Hinton\u2019s alternative\nproposal is that these Neutral Experience Reports are equivalent to\ndisjunctive statements of the form \u2018I see an F, or\nI\u2019m having that illusion\u2019. Hinton labels such disjunctive\nstatements \u2018Perception-Illusion disjunctions\u2019. Hinton\nargues that in order to substantiate their common element assumption,\nhis opponents need to show that our Neutral Experience Reports are not\nequivalent to these Perception-Illusion disjunctions, and he tries to\nargue that this is a challenge that his opponents cannot meet.\n\n\nThe fact that Hinton chooses to focus on the reports we\nmake about our experiences, may be a reflection of the fact that his\nprimary concern is to question an assumption about those properties of\nexperience that we should be in a position to make reports about simply\nin virtue of having the experience. (\u201cYou want a predicate whose\napplicability to what is happening in or to me is made clear to me by\nthe very fact of that thing\u2019s happening\u201d, Hinton 1967,\n224.) We might then understand Hinton as taking his opponent to be\ncommitted to the claims that (a) perceptions and subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucinations have such properties in common, (b) it\nis the fact that perceptions and hallucinations have such properties in\ncommon that explains their being subjectively indistinguishible, and\n(c) these are the properties we are picking out when we make Neutral\nExperience Reports. He may then be seen as trying to undermine the\nassumption that (a) and (b) are correct by throwing into doubt our\nentitlement to (c).\n\n\nFor Hinton, an important feature of his Perception-Illusion\nDisjunctions is that they do not report what is happening to the\nsubject, as distinct from saying, non-committally, that one of a number\nof things is happening. Hinton claims that these disjunctive claims do\nnot give a \u201cdefinite answer\u201d to the question \u2018what\nhappened to the subject?\u2019 or as he sometimes puts it, they do not\ngive the \u201cwhat-it-is of the event\u201d in question. This is why\nHinton thinks that substantiating the relevant common element\nassumption requires showing that our Neutral Experience Reports are not\nequivalent to his disjunctive statements. According to the thought\nexpressed in (c) above, our Neutral Experience Reports are committal in\na way that these disjunctive statements are not. So the idea here seems\nto be that if our Neutral Experience Reports are equivalent to\nHinton\u2019s Perception-Illusion disjunctions, then assumption (c),\nabove, is thereby undermined.\n\n\nOne way of defending a common element view against this line of\nargument might be to defend the claim that one can accept (a) and (b)\nwithout being committed to (c). Alternatively one might object that an\nadequate defence of (a) and (b) need not simply depend on establishing\n(c) (see Snowdon 2008).\n\n\nFurthermore, one might question what Hinton has in mind in his use\nof the term \u2018equivalent\u2019 when he says that his opponent\nneeds to show that our Neutral Experience Reports are not equivalent to\nhis Perception-Illusion disjunctions. For Hinton denies that he is\nsuggesting that his Perception-Illusion disjunctions provide us with a\nconceptual analysis of our Neutral Experience\nReports. Snowdon (2008) suggests that the most obvious reading of\n\u2018equivalent\u2019 in this context is the following:\n\u2018P\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018Q\u2019 if\nand only if it is a priori that necessarily (P if and only\nif Q). Snowdon then poses the following problem for\nHinton\u2019s argument. The fact that a statement is disjunctive does\nnot on its own mean that it cannot be equivalent, in the relevant\nsense, to a non-disjunctive statement, which, as a consequence of\nbeing non-disjunctive, may well count as saying what sort of thing is\nhappening. Snowdon offers a mathematical example in support of this\nclaim. \u2018X wrote down a number which is either 2 or an\nuneven prime number\u2019 is equivalent, in the relevant sense, to\n\u2018X wrote down a prime number\u2019.\n\n\nThe problem this poses for Hinton is that it suggests that he may be\nwrong to assume that his opponent needs to show that our Neutral\nExperience Reports are not equivalent to his Perception-Illusion\ndisjunctions. For even if they were equivalent to the\nPerception-Illusion disjunctions, this might not in itself show that\nsuch reports don\u2019t pick out a common element to perception and\nillusion / hallucination and give a definite answer to the question\n\u2018what is happening?\u2019\n\n\nSnowdon suggests that despite this, what Hinton does achieve, in his\nvarious discussions of these issues, is to put pressure on the\nassumption that there is anything in the use we make of our ordinary\nNeutral Experience Reports that thereby commits us to the common\nelement view\u2014i.e., the view that Hinton is attempting to target.\nSuppose we accept that Hinton does achieve what Snowdon suggests.\nConsistent with this, one might also hold that there is nothing in the\nuse we make of our ordinary Neutral Experience Reports that thereby\ncommits us to a denial of the common element view. One might think that\na denial of the common element view is at least as committal as its\naffirmation, for it involves a substantive metaphysical claim about the\nnature of perceptual experience. So why should we think that the burden\nof proof lies with the common element theorists to establish\ntheir view?\n\n\nAt points it looks as though Hinton thinks that an extra commitment\nincurred by the common element theorist is an epistemic one. For\nexample, Hinton considers the following objection that might be raised\nagainst his disjunctive approach: \u201cIf A-ing [i.e.,\nseeing an O] and B-ing [i.e., having that illusion]\ndid not have a worn-on-the-sleeve property in common, how could you\ntake one for the other?\u201d To which Hinton\u2019s reply is,\n\u201cWhy should it just not seem that they had properties in common?\nSeeing a flash of light and having the illusion seem, but only seem,\nto have in common the property \u2018when x occurs a flash\nof light occurs\u2019\u201d (1967, 225).  The implication here seems\nto be that Hinton is taking his opponent to be making a substantive\nepistemic assumption\u2014that our inability to discern through\nintrospection any differences between a hallucination and a perception\nmust ultimately be explained by our positive ability to discern\nthrough introspection that they are events of the same kind. (For a\ncritique of this assumption, see also Putman 1999).\n3.2 An Epistemological Argument\n\n\nMcDowell\u2019s disjunctive conception of perceptual experience is\nprimarily motivated by epistemological concerns. He appeals to a\ndisjunctive conception of perceptual experience in offering a proposal\nas to how we should resist a \u201ctempting\u201d line of argument\nthat has an epistemological conclusion. The conclusion of the tempting\nargument is that when one genuinely perceives the world, the epistemic\ngrounds one has for one\u2019s world-directed judgements can be no\nbetter than those available to one when one hallucinates. (See McDowell\n1982, 1987, 1994, 2008, 2010, and 2013. See Putnam 1999 for an endorsement of\nMcDowell\u2019s approach.)\n\n\nThe tempting line of argument that McDowell is concerned to resist\nstarts by proposing that since hallucinations can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from genuine perceptions, the differences between\nyour genuine perceptions and your hallucinations must be external to\nhow things are with you subjectively. An epistemic claim is then made:\nMatters external to how things are with you subjectively cannot\nintelligibly contribute, even in part, to your epistemic standing on\nsome question. For such matters will be beyond your ken, and matters\nbeyond your ken cannot make any difference to your epistemic standing.\nThe conclusion that is then drawn is that when you genuinely perceive\nthe world your epistemic grounds for making world-directed perceptual\njudgements are the same as, an hence no better than, those available to\nyou when you have a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination.\n\n\nIn responding to this line of argument, McDowell appeals to a\ndisjunctive conception of perceptual experience in order to block the\nmove from the claim that (i) hallucinations can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from genuine perceptions, to the claim that (ii) the\ndifferences between a genuine perception and a hallucination must be\n\u201cblankly external to one\u2019s subjectivity\u201d (McDowell\n1982). This is then supposed to provide us with a way of resisting the\nargument\u2019s conclusion\u2014i.e., the claim that the experiences\ninvolved in genuine perception and hallucination do not differ in their\nepistemic significance. According to the disjunctive conception of\nexperience that McDowell proposes, we can accept that what is common to\na genuine perception and a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination\nis the fact that the subject\u2019s experience is such that it appears\nto her that some environmental fact obtains. However, we should also\naccept that an appearance that such-and-such is the case can be\neither a mere appearance or the fact that\nsuch-and-such is the case making itself perceptually manifest to\nsomeone, and on McDowell\u2019s view, when a fact is made perceptually\nmanifest to one, the obtaining of the fact is not \u201cblankly\nexternal to one\u2019s subjectivity\u201d. So the obtaining of the\nfact can contribute to one\u2019s epistemic standing.\n\n\nA standard line of objection against McDowell\u2019s disjunctivist\nproposal is that the epistemological considerations he invokes do not\nadequately support the disjunctive account of experience that he\nrecommends. The general claim behind this line of objection is that an\nadequate account of the epistemological role of perceptual experience\nneed not involve any appeal to disjunctivism. As there are many\ndifferent accounts of the epistemological role of perceptual\nexperience, there are many different forms that this line of objection\ncan take.\n\n\nFor instance, according to one widely held view, the perceptual\njudgements one makes when one is having a perfect hallucination can be\njustified and have the same justificatory status as the perceptual\njudgements one makes when one genuinely perceives the world. According\nto this view, there is a sense, then, in which the conclusion of the\ntempting line of argument that McDowell considers is true: when you\ngenuinely perceive the world your epistemic grounds for making\nworld-directed perceptual judgements are the same as, an hence no\nbetter than, those available to you when you have a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination. However, those who accept this claim\nmay deny that this puts into jeopardy the common sense idea that when\nwe do succeed in perceiving the world we usually do acquire\nnon-inferential, world-directed, perceptual knowledge. For they may\nclaim the epistemic difference between a veridical perception and\nhallucination is not to be explained by appealing to some difference in\nthe justificatory status of the judgements that such experiences give\nrise to. The epistemic difference is, rather, to be explained by\nappealing to the fact that when one perceives the world some further\nconditions required for perceptual knowledge will usually be met.\n\n\nTaking this line might be one way of resisting an epistemic\nassumption made in the \u201ctempting\u201d line of argument that\nMcDowell considers, namely the assumption that matters external to how\nthings are with you subjectively cannot intelligibly contribute, even\nin part, to your epistemic standing on some question. An alternative\nway of resisting this epistemic assumption is to accept a view\naccording to which matters external to how things are with you\nsubjectively can contribute to the justificatory status of your\nbeliefs. (For an example of this approach to justification, see Goldman\n1979).\n\n\nAccording to another line of objection, one that is more sympathetic\nto McDowell\u2019s general epistemological outlook, one can resist the\ntempting line of argument in a way that closely parallels\nMcDowell\u2019s proposal, but without being committed to a disjunctive\nview of appearances. Williamson (2000) proposes a view of this kind.\nAccording to this view, when one genuinely perceives the world and sees\nthat such and such is the case, one is in a factive mental state of\nknowing that such and such is the case. This factive mental state can\nonly obtain when one is veridically perceiving the world, and it cannot\nobtain when one is hallucinating. Furthermore, this factive mental\nstate is not to be given a conjunctive analysis. It is not to be\nregarded as being in a state that can be conjunctively analysed in\nterms of having an experience that such and such is the case, plus some\nfurther, extra-mental conditions that are \u2018blankly external to\none\u2019s subjectivity\u2019. So the proponent of this view agrees\nwith McDowell that when one sees that such and such is the case one is\nin a distinctive kind of mental state that cannot be conjunctively\nanalysed. However, the proponent of this view rejects McDowell\u2019s\nclaim that one should give a disjunctive account of appearances. For\naccepting that one cannot give a conjunctive analysis of\nseeing that such and such is case is compatible with saying\nthat its appearing to one that such and such is the case is a\nmental state common to genuine perception and hallucination, where such\na state is not to be given a disjunctive characterisation. (For further\ndiscussion of this line of objection, see section 4.3)\n\n\nA further criticism that has been levelled against McDowell\u2019s\nproposal is that his disjunctive account of experience fails to bring\nwith it the epistemic benefits that he advertises it as having.\nMcDowell has suggested that in showing how the disjunctive account he\nrecommends allows us to resist the tempting line of argument that he\nconsiders, he has shown us how to \u201cremove a prop\u201d upon\nwhich a certain line of sceptical argument depends. (In particular,\nsee McDowell 2008). Against McDowell, Wright (2002, 2008) argues that\ndisjunctivism provides us with nothing to address mainstream\nperceptual scepticism. Wright claims that the traditional Cartesian\nsceptical argument does not rely on the impossibility of direct\nperceptual acquaintance with the world. It allows that you may be\nhaving a perceptual experience that involves a fact in the world\nmaking itself perceptual manifest to you. What it attempts to\nundermine is the idea that anything other than agnosticism as to\nwhether or not you are perceiving is warranted, even in this\nsituation. (See also Conee 2007, and Byrne 2014.)\n\n\nIn response to this criticism, McDowell has said that in accepting\nhis disjunctive account of experience we need not pretend to have an\nargument that can prove that we are not being deceived using premises\nwe can affirm without begging the question against the sceptic. What\nthe disjunctive account does achieve, though, is to show we can resist\nsceptical arguments that appeal to the \u201chighest common\nfactor\u201d conception of experience\u2014that conception of\nexperience according to which genuine perceptions and subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucinations do not differ in their epistemological\nsignificance. For the disjunctive account of experience blocks the\ninference from subjective indistinguishability to the highest common\nfactor conception. According to McDowell\u2019s diagnosis, the move\nfrom subjective indistinguishability to the highest common factor\nconception depends upon an illegitimate view of self-knowledge. (For a\nsimilar proposal see Williamson 2000). And McDowell argues that this\nillegitimate view of self-knowledge itself makes unintelligible a\ncharacteristic of experience that the sceptical argument does not\nusually question\u2014that our perceptual experience at least\npurports to reveal how things are in the objective world.\n\n\nSo an important element of McDowell\u2019s disjunctive approach is his\nopposition to a certain view of self-knowledge. (See especially\nMcDowell 1987.) According to the view he opposes, although your\nability to tell how things are in the world by looking is fallible,\nyour ability to tell how things are with you subjectively is\ninfallible, in the following sense: the truth about how things are\nwith you subjectively is infallibly accessible to your capacity to\nacquire knowledge on such matters.This picture of self-knowledge is\nincompatible with the disjunctive account of experience that McDowell\nrecommends. According to that disjunctive account when you have an\nexperience, you can know, independently of whether you know that you\nare hallucinating, that it appears to you that such and such is the\ncase. However, its appearing to you that a such and such is the case\ncan be either a situation in which a fact in the environment is being\nmade perceptually manifest to you, or a situation that involves a mere\nappearance, and you cannot know which disjunct obtains independently\nof knowing whether you are hallucinating. According to McDowell, when\na fact is made perceptually manifest to you, the obtaining of the fact\nis not \u201cblankly external to your subjectivity\u201d. The\nresultant view is incompatible with the claim that all of the\ntruths about how things are with you subjectively are infallibly\naccessible to you. For if all of the truths about things are with you\nsubjectively were infallibly accessible to you, your capacity to know\nwhether or not you were hallucinating would also be infallible.\n\n\nFor discussion of McDowell\u2019s disjunctivism, see Neta 2008,\nPritchard 2008, Sedivy 2008, Brogaard 2011 and Haddock 2011.

According to\nthis na\u00efve realist account, when one genuinely perceives the world\none is directly aware of mind-independent objects and their features.\nFurthermore, according to this view, when one perceives the world, the\nactual objects of perception, the external things such as trees, and\ntables, which one can perceive, and the properties they manifest to one\nwhen perceived, partly constitute one\u2019s conscious experience, and\nhence determine its phenomenal character. (See Martin\u2019s\ndiscussion of na\u00efve realism in his 1997, 1998, 2002, 2004, and\n2006.) Since one is not aware of mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures when one hallucinates, the na\u00efve realist cannot offer the\nsame account of the phenomenal character of hallucinations. The\nna\u00efve realist is committed, then, to the claim that the kind of\nphenomenally conscious episode that occurs when one perceives the world\nis not one that could be occurring were one hallucinating. So in order\nto preserve his na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character\nof genuine perceptions, Martin advocates a disjunctive account of\nperceptual experience. According to Martin, genuine perceptions and\nintrospectively indiscriminible hallucinations are not mental events of\nthe same fundamental kind.\n\n\nMartin\u2019s na\u00efve realist account of genuine perception is\nmotivated by phenomenological considerations. He argues that\nna\u00efve realism best articulates how sensory experience seems to us\nto be through introspective reflection. If introspective reflection\nsupports a na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character of\ngenuine perceptions, then presumably introspective reflection should\nlend the same support to a na\u00efve realist account of the\nphenomenal character of hallucinations that are introspectively\nindiscriminible from genuine perceptions. Since the na\u00efve realist\naccount of phenomenal character cannot be applied to hallucinations,\nthe na\u00efve realist must then say that hallucinations that are\nintrospectively indiscriminible from genuine perceptions do not have\nthe phenomenal character that introspective reflection\nsuggests\u2014they do not have the phenomenal character that they\nintrospectively seem to us to have. However, if Martin is right in his\nclaim that introspective reflection supports na\u00efve realism, then\nif we reject na\u00efve realism, we will have to accept\nthat all perceptual experiences, whether genuine perceptions\nor hallucinations, fail to have the phenomenal character that\nintrospective reflection suggests. (For a similar proposal, see also\nLangsam 2017).\n\n\nAs Martin sees it, then, the dialectical position is this: the\ndisjunctivist na\u00efve realist allows that at least some of our\nperceptual experiences really do have the phenomenal character that\nthey introspectively seem to have\u2014namely the genuine\nperceptions\u2014whereas the opponent of na\u00efve realism needs to\ndeny that any of our perceptual experiences really do have the\nphenomenal character that they introspectively seem to have. So Martin\nadvocates the disjunctivist na\u00efve realist view as the best error\ntheory concerning perceptual experience and the introspection of\nexperience.\n The claim that when one genuinely perceives the world one is\ndirectly aware of mind-independent objects and their features is not\ndistinctive of the na\u00efve realist account. For example, someone\nwho holds an intentionalist account of experience can also accept this\nclaim. According to this view our perceptual experiences are mental\nstates with intentional contents that represent the world as being a\ncertain way, and when one has an experience with a veridical content,\nin the right circumstances, one is directly aware of mind-independent\nobjects in one\u2019s environment. (Advocates of such intentionalist\naccounts of experience include Searle (1983), Harman (1990), Tye\n(1992, 1995, and 2000), Burge (1993 and 2010), Dretske (1995), Byrne\n(2001), and Pautz (2010)). Many have argued that this sort of theory\ncan adequately accommodate the phenomenological aspects of experience\nthat a na\u00efve realist might point to\u2014e.g., the apparent\npresence to mind of mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures\u2014without being committed to the idea that hallucinations\nfail to have the phenomenal character that they introspectively seem\nto have.\n\n\nMartin (2002) compares and contrasts the intentionalist and na\u00efve\nrealist accounts of these phenomenological aspects of perceptual\nexperience and argues that introspective reflection on the nature of\nsensory imagination\u2014in particular, visualising\u2014 gives us\nreason to support the na\u00efve realist account over the\nintentionalist one. Martin\u2019s argument for this claim has the following\nstructure: (i) He compares and contrasts the na\u00efve realist and\nintentionalist accounts of certain aspects of the phenomenology of\nperceptual experience\u2014their transparency and immediacy. (ii) He\nargues for a thesis about visualising\u2014the \u2018dependency\nthesis\u2019, which states that to visualise an F is to\nimagine a visual experience of an F. (For an influential\ndiscussion of this idea, see Williams 1973. For an endorsement of the\nview, see Peacocke 1985 and Vendler 1984.) (iii) He argues that the\ntruth of the dependency thesis should lead the intentionalist and the\nna\u00efve realist to make different predictions about the\nphenomenology of visualising, given their different accounts of the\ntransparency and immediacy of perceptual experience. So, he claims,\nthe phenomenology of visualising can be regarded as a test of these\ncompeting views. (iv) He argues that the phenomenology of our episodes\nof visualising favours the na\u00efve realist account.\n\n\nThe particular phenomenological aspects of perceptual\nexperience\u2014transparency and immediacy\u2014that the na\u00efve\nrealist and the intentionalist try to accommodate in different ways,\nare the following. Transparency: When one attends to what it\nis like for one to have a visual experience it seems to one as though\none does so through attending to mind-independent objects in one\u2019s\nenvironment and their features. Immediacy:\nFurthermore, our perceptual experiences are non-neutral about the\nactual presence of the mind-independent objects and features in our\nenvironment they are directed upon. They appear to have a coercive\npower and authority over our beliefs. Even if one believes that one is\nhallucinating, the phenomenal immediacy of the experience\u2014its\nnon-neutrality about the actual presence of mind-independent objects\nand features in our environment\u2014is not thereby extinguished.\nIntentionalists can explain the transparency and immediacy of\nperceptual experience in terms of the idea that (a) perceptual\nexperiences are mental states with intentional contents that represent\nthe mind-independent world as being a certain way (hence\ntransparency); and in terms of the idea that (b) such states play a\ndistinctive kind of functional role in our mental economy (hence\nimmediacy). This is not the account offered by the na\u00efve\nrealist. For the na\u00efve realist, one\u2019s experience relates to the\nworld in a non-representational manner. According to the na\u00efve\nrealist, the transparency and immediacy of genuine perceptions are\nexplained in terms of the idea that mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures are constituents of one\u2019s perceptual experience that\ndetermine, at least in part, the phenomenal character of that\nexperience. The phenomenal transparency and immediacy of a\nhallucination is explained derivatively\u2014in terms of its being\nintrospectively indiscriminible from something it is not\u2014a\nmental event with the phenomenal character of a genuine\nperception.\n\n\nOn the face of it, the intentionalist appears to be able to\naccommodate adequately the transparency and immediacy of experience\nwithout committing to the idea that hallucinations fail to have the\nphenomenal character that introspective reflection suggests. This might\nlead one to favour the intentionalist view. However, Martin argues that\nreflecting on the phenomenology of visualising gives us reason to think\notherwise.\n\n\nMartin argues that in order to capture adequately the respect in which\nthe phenomenology of visualising an F has some correspondence\nwith the phenomenology of having a visual experience of an F,\nwe should accept the dependency thesis\u2014the thesis that to\nvisualise an F is to imagine a visual experience of\nan F. He then argues that the truth of the dependency thesis\nshould lead the intentionalist and the na\u00efve realist to make\ndifferent predictions about the phenomenology of visualising. Martin\nargues that if the dependency thesis is correct, then the\nintentionalist should hold that when we visualise, we imagine a mental\nstate (i.e., a visual experience) that represents the world to be a\ncertain way and that has a distinctive kind of functional role. We\nmay, as part of our imaginative project, suppose that the imagined\nsituation contains the objects and features represented by the\nimagined visual experience, but, argues Martin, the intentionalist\nshould predict that (a) when one visualises something, e.g., an apple,\nthe imagistic character of one\u2019s visualising should itself be neutral\nwith respect to whether or not one is imagining a scene that contains\nan apple, and (b) something other than the putative object of\nexperience (i.e., the apple) should be available to introspection. The\nrepresentational properties of the experience one is imagining should\nbe revealed to one as such.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, as the na\u00efve realist offers a rather\ndifferent account of the phenomenal transparency and immediacy of\nvisual experience, the na\u00efve realist should make rather different\npredictions about the phenomenology of visualising. According to the\nna\u00efve realist, a visual experience of an apple seems to its\nsubject to be constitutively dependent on the presence of the\napple. So given the truth of the dependency thesis, the na\u00efve\nrealist should predict that when one visualises an apple, the\nimagistic character of one\u2019s visualising won\u2019t be neutral\nwith respect to whether or not one is imagining a scene that contains\nan apple. It should be committal on the presence of an apple in the\nimagined scene. Martin claims that the actual phenomenology of\nvisualising is more in keeping with what the na\u00efve realist\npredicts. He argues that as introspective reflection best supports the\nna\u00efve realist prediction, we can either deny na\u00efve realism\nand hold that none of our perceptual experiences have the phenomenal\ncharacter that introspective reflections suggests, or we can accept a\nna\u00efve realist account of genuine perceptions and hold that only\nsome of our perceptual experiences fail to have the phenomenal\ncharacter that introspective reflection suggests. This latter\nposition, according to Martin, is the least revisionary option.\n\n\nOne line of objection against Martin\u2019s argument targets the\ndependency thesis. For example, Noordhof (2002) and Burge (2005)\nquestion the plausibility of a claim that appears to be a commitment of\nthe dependency thesis: that in visualising an object one must be\nimagining a perceptual experience of the object, despite the fact that\nimagining the experience may have been no part of your imaginative\nproject. Some opponents of the dependency thesis have argued that the\ncorrespondences between visual experience and visualising are to be\naccounted for by the fact that there are similarities in the\nrepresentational contents of these episodes. (See Noordhof 2002 and\nCurrie and Ravenscroft 2002.)\n\n\nAn alternative response to the argument may be to accept the\ndependency thesis, but to question whether introspective reflection\nreally does support the claim that the imagistic character of\nvisualising an apple is itself non-neutral with respect to whether the\nimagined scene contains an apple. It might be held instead that the\nphenomenology of an episode of visualising does not speak to such\nmatters independently of the question of what suppositions the subject\nis making in engaging in his imaginative project (see Burge 2005).\nAlternatively, one might raise a more general scepticism about the\nreliability of appeals to introspection in supporting claims about the\nreal nature of perceptual experiences (see Spener 2003). Some may hold\nthat since we must allow that hallucinations do not have the sort of\nphenomenal character that introspective reflection suggests, there is\nlittle additional cost in allowing that veridical perceptions also\nfail to have the phenomenal character that introspective reflection\nsuggests. (For critical discussion of Martin\u2019s argument, see\nalso Dorsch 2010.)\n3.4 An Argument from Epistemic Modesty\n\n\nAccording to Martin, properly understood, disjunctivism offers us an\nepistemological perspective on how we should conceive of debates about\nperceptual experience. Martin suggests that the key to the disjunctive\napproach lies not in its appeal to paraphrasing claims about experience\nin disjunctive form, but rather in its appeal to the epistemic notion\nof indiscriminability in explicating the claims we make about\nperceptual experience. (For detailed discussion of the notion of\ndiscriminability, see Williamson 1990). Martin suggests that what is\ndistinctive of the disjunctive approach is the \u2018modesty\u2019 of\nthe claims it makes about what one can know about one\u2019s\nperceptual experiences. In contrast, the alternatives to the\ndisjunctive approach are \u2018immodest\u2019 in their assumptions\nabout our epistemic powers. The alternatives to the disjunctive\napproach that Martin appears to have in mind here are those versions of\nthe common element view that hold that (a) there are phenomenal\nproperties that are common to perceptions, illusions, and\nhallucinations, and (b) the possession of such properties is both\nnecessary and sufficient for an event to be a conscious perceptual\nexperience.\n\n\nMartin\u2019s argument for the claim that the alternatives to the\ndisjunctive approach incur greater epistemic burdens primarily focuses\non our understanding of the notion of a perfect hallucination.\nSceptical arguments often introduce talk of \u2018perfect\nhallucinations\u2019. On one understanding such talk is taken to\nbe introducing the notion of a conscious mental event that is not a\ngenuine perception but which is introspectively indiscriminible from a\ngenuine perception of the world. An assumption often\nmade is that such an experience would have the same phenomenal\nproperties as some possible genuine perception. But from the fact that\na conscious mental event is introspectively indiscriminible from a\ngenuine perception, does it follow that must have the same\nphenomenal properties as a genuine perception?\n\n\nSuppose we answer that this does not follow\u2014i.e., we accept that\nit may be possible, in principle, for there to occur a conscious\nmental event that is introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception, but which does not have the same phenomenal properties as\na genuine perception. Should we say that such events count as\nperceptual experiences? If one denies that such mental events should\nbe regarded as perceptual experiences, then, Martin suggests, one owes\nsome kind of justification for this denial, for this stance on what is\nrequired for a mental event to be a perceptual experience will seem,\nfrom a common sense perspective, to be too restrictive. On the other\nhand, if one holds that such mental events should be regarded as\nperceptual experiences, then this suggests that our most inclusive\nnotion of what it is for something to be a perceptual experience is an\nepistemic one\u2014that of being introspectively indiscriminible from\na genuine perception\u2014which does not involve the further\nmetaphysical assumption that perceptual experiences which aren\u2019t\ngenuine perceptions must have the same phenomenal properties as\ngenuine perceptions.\n\n\nNow suppose instead that we say that if a conscious mental event is\nintrospectively indiscriminible from a genuine perception it has the\nsame phenomenal properties as a genuine perception. According to Martin\nthis would be to embrace a substantive epistemic principle. For in\nadopting this stance one would be committed to the epistemic claim that\nin the case of any conscious mental event that lacks the phenomenal\nproperties of a genuine perception, the fact that it lacks the relevant\nphenomenal properties will be something that is knowable through\nintrospection. According to such a view, it is not just that the\nphenomenal properties that determine an event as an experience are held\nto be introspectively detectible and recognisible as such when present.\nIt must also be the case that the absence of such properties, when they\nare absent, is equally detectible through introspection.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, given that this approach to perceptual\nexperience needs to rely on this epistemic assumption, it carries more\ntheoretical burdens than does the more \u201cmodest\u201d\ndisjunctivist approach. For when it comes to characterizing the notion\nof perceptual experience in general, the disjunctive approach\nemphasizes the limits of our powers of discrimination, rather\nthan appealing to a substantive condition that an event must meet to be\nan experience, and in addition ascribing to us cognitive powers to\nrecognize the presence of this substantive condition. So, according to Martin, the\nburden is really on the common element theorist, either to show that\nthe extra epistemic commitment is one we should accept, or\nalternatively, to justify the claim that those conscious mental events\nthat are introspectively indiscriminible from genuine perceptions but\nwhich lack the phenomenal properties of genuine perceptions should not\nbe regarded as a perceptual experiences. This argument does not purport\nto show that the common element view is wrong, but rather to show that\nthe default position should be that of the disjunctivist.\n\n\nVarious objections have been raised against Martin\u2019s proposal.\nSome object to Martin\u2019s suggestion that being subjectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception is a sufficient condition\nfor being a perceptual experience. Siegel (2004 and 2008), Hawthorne\nand Kovakovich (2006), Smith (2008), and Byrne and Logue (2008) push\nthis line of objection. In effect, such objectors may be seen as\nattempting to meet one of Martin\u2019s challenges by offering reason\nto think that our notion of perceptual experience is, after all, more\nrestrictive than the epistemically characterised one he proposes.\nSiegel objects that a cognitively unsophisticated creature, such as a\ndog, will be incapable of introspectively discriminating the\nexperiences they have. So we cannot appeal to the notion of subjective\nindiscriminability in our account of what makes it the case that the\ndog has a perceptual experience of an F. Byrne and Logue\n(2008) and Smith (2008) object that even in the case of a cognitively\nsophisticated subject we should not rule out the possibility of the\noccurrence of a conscious mental event that is not a perceptual\nexperience, but which is subjectively indiscriminible from a veridical\nperception. For example, it might be argued that we should deny that\nepisodes of perceptual imagining (e.g., visualising) are perceptual\nexperiences, and we should allow that it may be possible for an\nepisode of visualising to be subjectively indiscriminible from a\nveridical perception. One might think that just such episodes occur\nwhen one is dreaming. (For example, see Ichikawa 2009). Keith Allen\n(2015), on the other hand, argues that hallucinations are degenerate\nkinds of sensory imagination and that the view that hallucination is a\nkind of sensory imagination represents a promising account of\nhallucination from the perspective of a na\u00efve realist theory of\nperception like na\u00efve realism.\n\n\nIf one does allow that conscious mental events of different kinds\n(e.g., perceptual experiences and perceptual imaginings) can be\nintrospectively indiscriminible, then it seems that one\u2019s defence\nof the claim that perfect hallucinations and genuine perceptions are\nevents of the same fundamental kind cannot simply appeal to the fact\nthat they are introspectively indiscriminible. One might, nonetheless,\nthink that there is introspective support for the claim that genuine\nperceptions have phenomenal properties which are such that (i) an\nevent\u2019s possession of them is independent of the conditions of\nperception, and (ii) an event\u2019s possession of them is sufficient\nto account for the fact that the event is introspectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception. One might then simply define\n\u2018perfect hallucinations\u2019 as those experiences that are not\ngenuine perceptions, but which have the same phenomenal properties as\ngenuine perceptions. (See section 3.3 for discussion of Martin\u2019s\npositive argument for Na\u00efve Realism, which can be seen as an\nattempt to challenge such claims.)\n\n\nAccording to another line of objection, Martin is wrong to propose\nthat being introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine perception is\na necessary condition for being a conscious perceptual experience. For\nalthough being introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception may be a condition satisfied by all genuine perceptions and\nperfect hallucinations had by subjects capable of making\nintrospective judgements about their perceptual experiences, it is not\na condition that need be satisfied by other perceptual\nexperiences. For instance, Siegel (2004) argues that experiences as of\nimpossible scenes\u2014e.g., experiences as of certain Escher\nscenes\u2014do not satisfy this condition.\n\n\nSiegel (2004) also suggests that, properly understood, the epistemic\nburden incurred by the common element theorist is not so great after\nall, as it leaves open the possibility that subjects may make all kinds\nof mistakes about the kinds of experiences they are having. One\u2019s\nview on whether or not the epistemic commitment that is being\nattributed to the common element theorist by Martin is excessively\nburdensome may depend, in part, on how one understands the notion of\nintrospective indiscriminability in play in his argument. This may also\naffect how plausible one finds the claim that being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception is necessary and sufficient\nfor being a perceptual experience. Martin\u2019s views on these issues\nare discussed further in section 5.1.\n3.5 An Argument from Demonstrative Reference\n John Campbell (2002a, 2002b, 2005, 2011) has argued that there is\nan important connection between the nature of the conscious perceptual\nexperience that occurs when we veridically perceive the world and our\nability to think demonstratively about the mind-independent objects\nthat we perceive. He argues that only a \u2018relational view of\nexperience\u2019 can adequately acknowledge the role of conscious\nexperience in making it possible for us to think demonstratively about\nthe categorical properties of the mind-independent objects we\nperceive, and this relational view of experience commits him to a form\nof disjunctivism about perception.\n\n\nAccording to this relational view of experience, when you veridically\nperceive the world the mind-independent objects and properties you\nperceive are constituents of your conscious experience\u2014the\nqualitative character of the conscious experience you undergo is\nconstituted by the qualitative characters of the mind-independent\nitems you perceive. This kind of experience cannot occur when you\nhallucinate\u2014veridical perceptions and hallucinations are\nexperiences of different conscious kinds\u2014hence the commitment to\ndisjunctivism. More precisely, according to the relational view of\nexperience that Campbell endorses, we are not to think of perceptual\nconsciousness of an object as a two-place relation between a person\nand an object, but rather as a three-place relation between a person,\na standpoint, and an object. Campbell suggests that we need\nto factor in the notion of a \u2018standpoint\u2019 as our\nexperience of objects is always in some sense partial. You always\nexperience an object from a standpoint, and you can experience one and\nthe same object from different standpoints. (For a similar proposal,\nsee Brewer 2011 and 2017a. For further discussion of this aspect of\nna\u00efve realism, see French 2018 and Christy 2019).\n\n\nCampbell argues that an adequate account of the nature of our\nconscious experience of objects should accommodate the fact that such\nconscious experience performs a significant explanatory role. According\nto Campbell, such conscious experience provides us with knowledge of\nwhat our perceptual demonstrative terms, like \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018that\u2019, refer to. Furthermore, according to Campbell, the\nknowledge of the semantic value of the demonstrative that such\nconscious experience provides us with, justifies and causes the pattern\nof use we make of that demonstrative in our reasoning. The relevant\npatterns of reasoning we engage in reflect our conception of the object\nreferred to as mind-independent. So, Campbell argues, our conscious\nexperience of objects has a role to play in explaining what provides us\nwith our conception of the objects of perception as mind-independent.\nCampbell argues that it is only the relational view of experience that\ncan adequately acknowledge the way in which conscious experience plays\nthis explanatory role, so competing accounts of experience should be\nrejected.\n\n\nNote that the explanatory role that Campbell is suggesting that our\nconscious experience of objects is supposed to play isn\u2019t simply that\nof justifying, or providing warrant for, our beliefs and judgements\nthat employ perceptual demonstratives. His claim is rather that such\nexperience has a role to play in justifying the patterns of use we\nmake of the demonstrative in reasoning that we engage in\u2014where\nsuch reasoning reflects our grasp of the criteria of identity of the\nobject referred to, which in turn reflects our grasp of the object as\nbeing mind-independent. According to Campbell, this pattern of use is\njustified by appeal to the semantic value of the demonstrative. Our\nconscious experience of the object to which the demonstrative refers\nprovides us with a form of knowledge of the semantic value of the\ndemonstrative, and thereby plays a role in justifying the use we make\nof the demonstrative in our reasoning.\n\n\nCampbell argues that one cannot adequately acknowledge the way in\nwhich conscious experience plays this explanatory role if one holds a\nview of experience according to which an experience is a mental state\nor event with an intentional content that represents the world as\nbeing a certain way. For such a view of experience at best presupposes\nwhat is to be explained. It presupposes what is to be explained if the\ncontent of such a representational state is conceptual, and it doesn\u2019t\nhave the resources to play the relevant explanatory role if its\nrepresentational content is non-conceptual. What\u2019s required, argues\nCampbell, is a conception of experience as something less than\nconceptual representation of the object of experience, but which\nnonetheless has the resources to explain how experience of an object\ncan provide one with a form of knowledge of the semantic value of a\ndemonstrative that refers to it. Campbell argues that the only\nadequate contender is the relational view, for according to the\nrelational view one\u2019s conscious experience in the veridical case\nacquaints one with a mind-independent object and its\ncategorical properties. This confrontation with, this awareness\nof, the mind-independent object referred to is what provides\none with the relevant form of knowledge of the semantic value of the\ndemonstrative that allows experience to play its explanatory role.\n\n\nAs Campbell himself points out, his argument presses very hard the\nidea that experience of objects has this explanatory role to play. Some\nissues of contention here are the following: (a) Whether an account of\nthe nature of conscious experience really does have a role to play when\nit comes to an explanation of the fact that we have a conception of\nobjects in the world as mind-independent. (b) If the nature of\nconscious experience does have such an explanatory role to play,\nwhether it is the one that Campbell identifies\u2014i.e., that of\ncausing and justifying the use we make of demonstrative terms that\nrefer to the mind-independent objects we perceive. (c) Whether the\nrelational view of experience really does have the resources to play\nthe explanatory role that Campbell assigns to it. (For criticism of\nCampbell\u2019s argument, see Burge 2005, Rey 2005, and Cassam 2011).\n3.6 Further Motivations for Disjunctivism\n\n\nThis section briefly summarises some further considerations that\nhave been appealed to in motivating disjunctive accounts of perceptual\nexperience.\n\n\nSome have argued that a genuine perception of the world is a\nperceptual state with an intentional content containing demonstrative\nelements that refer to the items perceived. (See Brewer 2000, Burge\n1993, and Tye 2007, Scellenberg 2010, 2013, and 2016. For objections\nto this idea see Davies 1992 and McGinn 1982.) Acceptance of this\nview, together with two further assumptions, can lead to the\nconclusion that the kind of experience that occurs when one perceives\nthe world isn\u2019t one that can occur when one hallucinates, which\nin turn can motivate a disjunctive approach to perceptual experience\nin general. The two further assumptions are the following. (a)\nTruth-evaluable intentional contents with demonstrative elements that\nsuccessfully refer are object-dependent, and (b) experiences are of\nthe same mental kind only if they have the same truth-evaluable\ncontents. (The latter claim is endorsed by Evans 1981, 1982 and\nMcDowell 1984. For criticisms of this claim see Burge 1983, 1993,\n2005, 2010, and Martin 2003).\n\n\nBrewer advocated a view of this form in his book Perception and\nReason. In his more recent work on perceptual experience he has\nproposed an alternative view of genuine perception, but which also\ncommits to disjunctivism about perceptual experience. (See Brewer\n2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2017a, and 2017b.) In this work Brewer is\nconcerned to identify and defend the account of experience that he\nthinks is most conducive to our common sense \u2018empirical\nrealist\u2019 world-view\u2014the view that the tables, trees,\npeople and animals etc, that we sense, are as they are independently\nof anyone\u2019s thought or experience of them. Brewer argues that\nthe \u2018Object View\u2019 of experience, which he contrasts with\nthe \u2018Content View\u2019, is the most promising such\naccount. According to this \u2018object view\u2019, perception is an\nacquaintance with mind-independent empirical things whose basic\nnatures and perceptible qualities constitute what it is like to be\npresented with them in this way. A similar line of empirical realist\nline of thought can be found in Campbell\u2019s work. (For example,\nsee Campbell and Cassam 2014. For a related line of thought, see also\nLogue 2012b). Campbell argues that only a na\u00efve realist account of the\nphenomenal character of perception can accommodate an epistemic role\nthat conscious perception plays in grounding the concepts we possess\nof mind-independent objects and the qualities we perceive. For\nexample, he argues that only a na\u00efve realist account of phenomenal\ncharacter can adequately capture the following two ideas: (i) The\nphenomenal character of perception plays a crucial role in explaining\nour distinctive conceptions of what our colour terms refer to, and\n(ii) our colour terms refer to mind-independent qualities of\nobjects. (For discussion of Campbell\u2019s view, see Soteriou 2016,\nCh. 4. For objections to Campbell\u2019s arguments, see\nCassam\u2019s contribution to Campbell and Cassam 2014. For\nobjections to the view of colour defended by Campbell, see Pautz\nforthcoming. For further discussion of this issue, see Kalderon 2011,\nAllen 2016, and Beck 2019).\n\n\nOne significant recent source of motivation for disjunctivism (common\nto the views proposed by Martin, Campbell and Brewer) is the\nsuggestion that we should moving away from representationalist\naccounts of the way in which our minds are intentionally directed upon\nthe mind-independent world when we perceive it. Influential in this\nregard is Charles Travis\u2019s work on perception. Travis (2004 and\n2013), who cites Austin\u2019s Sense and Sensibilia as an\nimportant influence, argues that perception is not\nrepresentational. He offers a critique of a representationalist view\nthat is committed to the following claims: (i) Experiences have\nrepresentational contents and can be true / false\u2014veridical\n/non-veridical; (ii) the representational content of an experience is\nsomething that the subject can take at face value, and accept, or\ndecline; (iii) the experience having this content isn\u2019t a matter\nof the subject taking / judging things to be a certain way; and (iv)\nthe way our experience represents things to be is something we can\nappreciate and recognize. According to Travis\u2019s alternative view\nof perception our senses confront us with what is there, they bring\nour surroundings into view, but there is nothing in a perceptual\nexperience to make it count as having some one representational\ncontent as opposed to countless others. In making out, or trying to\nmake out what it is that we are confronted with,\nwe may go wrong, and make false judgements, but when we are\nmisled in this way, this is not because our senses non-veridically\nrepresent to us that the world is a certain way. On the assumption\nthat we are not confronted with the mind-independent world when we\nhallucinate, this sort of view naturally leads to a disjunctivist view\nof perceptual experience. (For discussion of these issues, see Raleigh\n2013, Shahmoradi 2016, and Wilson 2018).\n4. Objections to Disjunctivism\n\n\nSome of the objections raised against disjunctive theories are\ndirected at the specific arguments proposed in support of different\nversions of disjunctivism. For discussion of objections to the\narguments proposed by Hinton and McDowell, see sections 3.1, and 3.2;\nand for objections to arguments proposed by Martin see sections 3.3\nand 3.4. For objections to disjunctivist accounts of hallucination,\nsee section 5. Some arguments against certain versions of\ndisjunctivism are directed against what are taken to be some of the\nmetaphysical commitments of the na\u00efve realist account of veridical\nperception. For example, Pautz (forthcoming) argues that na\u00efve realism\nabout veridical perception carries commitments about the metaphysical\nstatus of observable qualities, such as colour, that are undermined by\nempirical science. This section discusses arguments aimed at a more\ngeneral level, against the disjunctivist\u2019s denial that veridical\nperceptions, illusions and hallucinations are mental events of the\nsame fundamental kind, and in favour of the view that there is common\nelement to veridical perception, illusion and hallucination.\n4.1 The Explanatory Power of the Common Kind Claim\n\n\nSturgeon (1998) offers a number of reasons for thinking that our\ndefault view should be the thesis that there is a common factor to\nveridical perceptions, illusions and hallucinations\u2014i.e., the\nthesis that they all involve perceptual states of the same basic\nkind\u2014rather than the disjunctivist view.\n\n\nSturgeon points to a number of features that can be common to\nveridical perceptions, illusions, and hallucinations. Among the\nfeatures he points to are the following: (i) veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations can produce similar behavioural effects.\nFor example, in general, if it sensibly appears to you as though a\nrock is flying towards you, you will duck, irrespective of whether the\nexperience you are having is a veridical perception, an illusion, or a\nhallucination. (ii) If, on the basis of that experience, you believe\nthat a rock is flying towards you, and you act on that belief and\nduck, there is a sense in which your belief and action are rational,\nirrespective of whether that experience is a veridical perception, an\nillusion, or a hallucination. (iii) If you have an experience as of a\nrock flying towards you, you can know what it\u2019s like to see a rock\nflying towards you, irrespective of whether that experience is a\nveridical perception, an illusion, or a hallucination. (iv) Veridical\nperceptions, illusions and hallucinations can be introspectively\nindistinguishible.\n\n\nSturgeon suggests that the most obvious explanation of the fact that\nthese experiences share these features is the proposal they all involve\nmental states of the same kind. So this should be our default view\nuntil we are given reason to be persuaded otherwise.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist may try to explain the fact that illusions and\nhallucinations can have the same kinds of behavioural effects as\nveridical perceptions by simply appealing to the fact that such\nexperiences can be subjectively indistinguishible from veridical\nperceptions. Since the difference between a hallucination and a\nveridical perception may be something that a subject is unable to\ndetect through introspection, the hallucination will naturally give\nrise to effects that are similar to those of the veridical perception.\nThe subject will respond to such a hallucination in the same kind of\nway in which she would respond to a veridical perception. And there is a\nsense in which this response can be regarded as rational.\n\n\nHowever, the disjunctivist who denies that a hallucination can have\nthe same phenomenal character as a veridical perception will be put\nunder pressure to offer some positive explanation of the fact that a\nhallucination can seem to have the same phenomenal character as a\nveridical perception, and in particular, to offer some explanation of\nhow it is that a subject can come to know what it is like to have a\nveridical perception of an F through simply having a\nhallucination of an F, given that the hallucination does not\nactually possess the what-it-is-like properties of the veridical\nperception. As Hellie (2007) notes, while not everything is\nthe way it appears, there is a strong intuition that the phenomenal\ndomain is distinctive\u2014if an experience appears to have a certain\nphenomenal property, then it has that property as phenomenal\ncharacter. The tenability of the form of disjunctivism that denies\nthat veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character will depend on whether this epistemic assumption\ncan plausibly be denied (see the discussion of this point in section\n3.4), and whether the disjunctivist can make a satisfactory case for\nthinking that veridical perceptions appear to have a phenomenal\ncharacter that hallucinations could not possess (see section 3.3).\n4.2 The Causal Argument Against Disjunctivism\n\n\nAn influential argument against disjunctivism is the causal\nargument, first proposed by Howard Robinson (see Robinson 1985 and\n1994). The simplest version of the argument appeals to the following\ntwo claims: (i) It is theoretically possible, by activating some brain\nprocesses involved when a subject genuinely perceives the world, to\ncause a hallucination subjectively indistinguishible from that\nperception\u2014a \u2018causally matching\u2019 hallucination.\n(ii) It is necessary to give the same account of the experiences\ninvolved in genuine perception and hallucination when they have the\nsame neural causes. So we should accept that the kind of\nexperience that occurs when a subject perceives the world is one the\nsubject could be having if she were hallucinating.\n\n\nThe general principle behind this second claim is \u2018same\nproximate cause, same immediate effect\u2019. It is likely that the\ndisjunctivist will simply reject this principle. The disjunctivist may\ninsist that in a case of genuine perception, even if the objects of\nperception are distal causes of the subject\u2019s experience, they\nare also figure non-causally as essential constituents of it. So the\noccurrence of the relevant brain processes won\u2019t be sufficient to\nproduce the kind of mental event involved in perception, unless further\nnon-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of that kind of\nmental effect also obtain. At this point, the disjunctivist and her\nopponent may simply disagree as to whether there are any psychological\neffects that have significant non-causal constitutive conditions\nattached. And this connects with familiar debates as to the tenability\nof externalist views in the philosophy of mind. (For further discussion\nof the causal argument see Langsam 1997, Snowdon 2005b, and Martin\n2004).\n4.3 Neither Conjunctivism Nor Disjunctivism\n\n\nThere is another version of the causal argument that can be used to\nput pressure on the disjunctivist to accept that there is a common\nelement to veridical perception and causally matching hallucination.\n(See Johnston 2004 and Martin 2004.) The proponent of this argument may\nallow for the possibility that there are non-causal constitutive\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of certain kinds of mental\nevents, where such constitutive conditions may include the presence in\nthe environment of appropriate candidate objects of perception.\nSo this version of the causal argument can accommodate the\ndisjunctivist\u2019s claim that there are significant non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of the kind of experience that\noccurs when one veridically perceives the world. What this version of\nthe causal argument relies upon is, rather, the claim that there are no\nsuch significant non-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of\nthe kind experience that occurs when one hallucinates. The\nproponent of this modified causal argument claims that there are no\nnon-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of the kind of\nexperience that occurs when one hallucinates that cannot also obtain\nwhen one veridically perceives the world. So whatever kind of\nexperience occurs when you have a causally matching hallucination of an\nF will also be produced when you have a veridical perception\nof an F.  So there is, after all, a common element to\nveridical perception and causally matching hallucination.\n\n\nCan the disjunctivist respond by saying that there is a non-causal\nconstitutive condition necessary for the kind experience that occurs\nwhen one hallucinates\u2014namely the absence of an\nappropriate candidate object of perception in the subject\u2019s\nenvironment? A problem with this response is that it relies on\ncharacterising the kind of psychological effect involved in\nhallucination in terms of what it is not, namely a veridical\nperception, and it is plausible to demand that it should be possible to\nprovide some positive account of the kind of psychological\neffect involved when one hallucinates.\n\n\nThis version of the causal argument does not rely on the general\nprinciple \u2018same proximate cause, same immediate effect\u2019,\nso a proponent of the argument may allow that there is a kind of\nmental event that occurs when one perceives the world which\ndoesn\u2019t occur when one hallucinates. Moreover, a proponent of\nthe argument may also allow that there is an explanatory role to be\nplayed by the kind of mental event that only occurs when one perceives\nthe world, which cannot be performed by appealing to the kind of\nmental event that is common to perception and illusion, plus some\nfurther non-mental conditions. (For this idea see Peacocke 1993 and\nWilliamson 2000).  However, the argument does put pressure on the\ndisjunctivist to accept that there is a certain kind of mental event\ncommon to perception and hallucination\u2014one that we should be\nable to give a positive, non-disjunctive account of. (See Burge 2005,\n2010 and 2011 for arguments to the effect that a denial of this claim\nis empirically untenable and incompatible with the methodology of\nvision science.) It suggests that if one simply wants to claim that\ngenuine perceptions are mental events of a kind that cannot occur when\none hallucinates, one should not be concerned to argue for a\ndisjunctive account of perceptual experience. One\u2019s concern\nshould simply be to oppose a conjunctive account of genuine\nperception. (For this line of criticism see Williamson 2000 and\nJohnston 2004).\n\n\nOne may be able to accept that a veridical perception and a\nhallucination differ mentally, while also accepting that they have a\ncommon mental core. Mark Johnston offers an account of hallucination\nalong these lines. He proposes that there is a respect in which the\nobjects of hallucination and the objects of seeing are akin. According\nto Johnston, the objects of a subject\u2019s hallucination are\ncomplexes of sensible qualities and relations that are not instantiated\nin the scene before him, whereas the objects of veridical perception\nare spatio-temporal particulars instantiating such complexes. On this\nview, there is, then, a common mental core to veridical perception and\nhallucination. In both cases one is aware of a \u2018sensible\nprofile\u2019\u2014a complex of qualities and relations.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist is generally willing to concede that perceptions\nand subjectively indistinguishible hallucinations have\nsomething in common. So why should they not accept that what\nis common to perception and hallucination is the occurrence of a\ncertain kind of mental event whose nature is one that we can give a\npositive, non-disjunctive account of?\n Martin argues that the na\u00efve realist disjunctivist should\ndeny that it is possible to give a positive, non-derivative account of\nthe kind of phenomenal event that occurs when one hallucinates. (This\nis to oppose the suggestion made in Dancy 1995. See Martin 1997, 2004\nand 2006. For discussion see Nudds 2009.). For if the na\u00efve\nrealist does offer a positive, non-derivative account of the kind\nphenomenal event that occurs when one hallucinates, and she also\naccepts that this kind of event also occurs when one perceives the\nworld, then she will be under pressure to explain why the occurrence of\nthis kind of event doesn\u2019t screen off the explanatory role that she\nassigns to her na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character\nof genuine perception. (For critical discussion of this objection, see\nHellie 2013). Martin\u2019s response to the argument is to say that the\nna\u00efve realist should affirm that in the case of a causally\nmatching hallucination, there is no more to the phenomenal character\nof such an experience than that of being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a certain genuine perception. In the case of the\ncausally matching hallucination its subjective character is exhausted\nby its possession of the negative epistemic property\u2014that of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a veridical perception.\n\n\nIt might now be objected that this disjunctivist response still\nintroduces a common element to veridical perception and causally\nmatching hallucination that screens off the explanatory role that the\nna\u00efve realist assigns to her distinctive account of the\nphenomenal character of veridical perception. Both a veridical\nperception of an F and a causally matching hallucination\npossess the negative epistemic property of being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a veridical perception of an F. So why\ndoesn\u2019t this screen off any explanatory role that the na\u00efve\nrealist might assign to the phenomenal properties that she claims only\na veridical perception can possess? Martin\u2019s response is to\nsuggest that the property of being indiscriminible from an F\nhas an explanatory potential which is dependent on the explanatory\npotential of being an F.  So the property of\nactually being a veridical perception, and having the phenomenal\nproperties that only a veridical perception can possess, can still be\nregarded as having a crucial explanatory role to play.\n\n\nHowever, this response still leaves the na\u00efve realist in the\nposition of having to deny that it is possible to provide a positive\naccount of the phenomenal character of a causally matching\nhallucination. Many have argued that this claim is ultimately\nuntenable. So the modified causal argument can be seen as part of an\nattempt to force the na\u00efve realist disjunctivist into an untenable\nposition with respect to causally matching hallucinations.\n5. Disjunctivist Accounts of Hallucination and Illusion\n\n\nThis section is concerned with what disjunctivists say about the\nfollowing: the nature of the kind of mental event that occurs when one\nhallucinates, the nature of the kind of mental event that occurs when\nhas a perceptual illusion, and what the differences between such events\nmight be.\n5.1 Hallucination\n\n\nSome disjunctivists say relatively little about the nature of\nhallucination (e.g., McDowell, Campbell and Brewer). For example,\nMcDowell characterises hallucinatory experience as a \u201cmere\nappearance\u201d that such and such is the case, which seems to leave\nopen whether a more positive account can potentially be given. Dancy\n(1995) suggests that the disjunctivist should offer a more direct\ncharacterization of the kind of experience that occurs when one\nhallucinates, rather than simply characterising it solely by saying\nthat it is like what it is not. He suggests that in a fully explicit\nversion of the disjunctive theory hallucination would be characterised\nin a direct, positive way.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist who allows that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations can have the same phenomenal character may take up this\nsuggestion. (See Logue 2012a and 2013.) This disjunctivist may be able\nto provide some positive account of the phenomenal character that\nveridical perception and hallucination can share, while allowing that\nthere are certain mental properties distinctive of veridical\nperception (e.g., its possessing an object-dependent intentional\ncontent.) However, for reasons explained in the previous section,\nMartin argues that the disjunctivist who is a na\u00efve realist about\nthe phenomenal character of veridical perception (and so who holds\nthat veridical perceptions have phenomenal properties that\nhallucinations cannot possess) should reject Dancy\u2019s\nproposal. Martin commits to the claim that in the case of certain\nhallucinations (i.e., those which have the same kind of proximate\ncause as veridical perceptions), there is no more to their phenomenal\ncharacter than that of being introspectively indiscriminible from a\nveridical perception.\n\n\nThis particular claim has drawn a great deal of criticism. Siegel\n(2004) argues that Martin\u2019s account fails to accommodate the\ndifferent kinds of hallucinations that can be experienced by a creature\nwho lacks the conceptual capacities to make introspective judgements\nabout its experience. E.g., suppose a dog is having a hallucination. Due\nto conceptual incapacities the dog is not in position to know that he\nis not perceiving a tomato, so for the dog this experience is\nintrospectively indiscriminible from a perception of a tomato. However,\nfrom this fact alone it does not follow that the dog is having a\nhallucination of a tomato.\n\n\nSiegel (2004) also argues that Martin\u2019s account fails to capture the\nfact that our hallucinations are phenomenally conscious, for a state\nthat is not phenomenally conscious can satisfy the description of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception. Furthermore, she argues (in Siegel 2008) that Martin\u2019s\naccount cannot adequately explain certain effects of\nhallucinations\u2014i.e., what grounds one\u2019s positive knowledge of\nthe kind of experience one is and isn\u2019t having. Along related lines,\nSturgeon (1998) suggests that the disjunctivist who denies that it is\npossible to provide a positive account of the phenomenal character of\na hallucination does not have the resources to explain adequately how\nit is that having a hallucination of an F can provide one\nwith positive knowledge concerning what it is like to veridically\nperceive an F. (See also Pautz 2010 and 2011.) Johnston\n(2004) argues that the disjunctivist offers no satisfactory\nexplanation of the fact that hallucination can provide us with\noriginal de re knowledge of quality (e.g., the fact that a\nhallucination as of a red object can provide its subject with de re\nknowledge of the quality of redness).\n\n\nMartin (2006) attempts to defend his account of hallucination\nagainst his critics, by (a) focusing on the issue of how we should\nunderstand the notion of indiscriminability in play in his talk of\n\u2018introspective indiscriminability\u2019, and (b) focusing on the\nquestion of the model of introspection we should adopt when our concern\nis with the way in which we introspect our phenomenally conscious\nmental states. Both aspects of Martin\u2019s defence of his view have\nbeen contested.\n\n\nMartin suggests that the notion of indiscriminability that the\ndisjunctivist should appeal to is an \u2018impersonal\u2019,\n\u2018objective\u2019 one. He compares the way in which we can talk\nof objects being visible or invisible. He suggests that in certain\ncontexts, when we say that something is invisible, we may not be\ntalking about the way a given individual, or group of individuals, is\nsuch that they cannot succeed in seeing the object. We may rather be\ntalking about what vision can and cannot discern. Furthermore,\nin asking what vision can reveal to us, we can ask in terms of how\nvision actually is, or ways in which vision could be. The most\nextreme claim of invisibility would be concerned with the latter\nnotion. The suggestion seems to be that we should not think that such\n\u2018impersonal\u2019, \u2018objective\u2019 talk of invisibility\nneed be reducible to claims about what a given subject, group of\nsubjects, or ideal subject would or would not see. So similarly, we\nshould not take the impersonal, objective talk of introspective\nindiscriminability as reducible to claims about what a given subject,\ngroup of subjects, or ideal subject would or would not come to know\nthrough introspection.\n\n\nMartin notes an objection that this comparison with sight might give\nrise to. When two objects are impersonally indiscriminible through\nsight, we tend to think that the objects in question must share a\nproperty\u2014an appearance\u2014that is detectible through\nvision. The fact that two visible objects cannot be told apart by sight\nsuggests that there is something in common between them that sight does\ndetect. So we might also think that if two experiences are\nintrospectively indiscriminible, these experiences must share a\nproperty\u2014a phenomenal property\u2014that introspection is\ntracking. Martin\u2019s response to this objection is to reject a\nmodel of introspection that he thinks lies behind it. Martin suggests\nthat in a case in which two objects are impersonally visually\nindiscriminible, we are led to posit a common appearance the objects\nshare that vision can discern, because we think of sight as a mode of\ncoming to be aware of a realm independent of it. So, according to\nMartin, the same story will apply to the case of introspection only if\nwe suppose that when one introspects the phenomenal character of\none\u2019s experience one is detecting features of some realm that is\nindependent of one\u2019s introspective access to it. Martin argues\nthat if one adopts this model of introspection then one will either\nhave to allow that it is possible for one\u2019s experience to have a\nreal phenomenal nature rather different from the one it introspectively\nseems to have, which remains inaccessible to introspection, or one will\nhave to accept that introspection involves the use of a\n\u201csuper-mechanism\u201d, which tracks the phenomenal character of\none\u2019s experience in a such a way that it cannot fail, or can only\nfail when it is knowable that it has.\n\n\nOn Martin\u2019s recommended alternative, a subject\u2019s introspective perspective on her\nexperience coincides with, and is not independent of, her\nexperiential perspective on the world. There is no way of specifying a\nmechanism of introspection such that there could be a way in which it\ngoes wrong, not because the faculty of introspection is a\n\u201csuper-mechanism\u201d, but rather because there is no mechanism\nof introspection.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, if we think of introspective awareness of\nexperience in the wrong way, the negative epistemic condition (that of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a veridical perception) is\nread only as a condition on one\u2019s cognitive awareness, and not\nas a condition on experience itself. And Martin thinks that this lies\nbehind many of the objections to his account. In response, Martin\ntries to argue that read in the right way introspective\nindiscriminability guarantees that phenomenal consciousness is\npresent. For according to Martin, the disjunctivist should stress the\nconnection between phenomenal consciousness and having a point of\nview, or perspective on the world, a connection central to\nNagel\u2019s (1974) discussion of consciousness. So the negative\nepistemological condition when correctly interpreted will specify not\njust a subject\u2019s cognitive response to their circumstances, but\nrather their perspective on the world (which the introspective\nperspective coincides with), and this will be sufficient for there to\nbe something it is like for them to be so. It is worth noting that the\nreasons that Martin gives for recommending this account of\nhallucination appear to apply just in the case of a causally matching\nhallucination (i.e. a hallucination that is subjectively\nindistinguishable from a veridical perception and which involves the\nsame kind of proximate cause and brain state as that involved in the\ncorresponding veridical perception). Moreover, it is not obvious that\na disjunctivist needs to give the same account of all\nhallucinations. So if a disjunctivist were to agree to Martin\u2019s\nreasoning about causally matching hallucinations, it may be open to\nher to provide a positive account of other hallucinations.\n\n\nFish (2008 and 2009) proposes a rather different disjunctivist account\nof hallucination, which applies to all hallucinations, including\ncausally matching hallucinations. Fish offers what he calls a minimal,\nbut positive, story about hallucination. According to Fish, a\nmental state that may be intrinsically quite different from a veridical\nperception might come to be mistaken for a veridical perception and\ntherein acquire the status of hallucination. Fish thinks that\nthe demand for a more substantial intrinsic characterisation of\nhallucination is misguided, but that the following positive story can\nbe told. The indistinguishability of hallucination from veridical\nperception is grounded in the similarity of their effects. A\nhallucination of an x is a mental state that, whilst not\nbeing a veridical perception of an x, nevertheless comes to\nhave effects that are sufficiently similar to those a veridical\nperception would have had. If the subject is conceptually\nsophisticated these effects will include higher-order beliefs about\nseeing an x, or seeming to see an x.  If the subject\nis not sophisticated enough to have such beliefs at all, the effects\nwill be solely behavioural.\n\n\nThis account allows that hallucinations may have no phenomenal\ncharacter, and even in those cases in which the mental state does have\nphenomenal character, the phenomenal character it has may well not\naccount for the particular content of the hallucination. (For the\nsuggestion that the disjunctivist should accept this consequence, see\nSturgeon 2006 and 2008. For criticism of Fish\u2019s account, see\nSiegel 2008).\n5.2 Illusion\n\n\nDifferent disjunctivists group together perceptions, illusions and\nhallucinations in different ways when offering their disjunctive\ncharacterisations of perceptual experience. At points it looks as\nthough Hinton is suggesting that illusions can be grouped together\nwith veridical perceptions. For in certain places he says that his\nPerception-Illusion disjunctions permit a description of what is seen\nin terms of how the thing looks, thereby allowing the following kind\nof Perception-Illusion disjunction: \u2018S sees something\nwhich looks blue or is having that illusion\u2019 (1973,\n61). In other places he says things that suggest that the illusion of\nan object appearing blue should not be grouped together with veridical\nperception, for he says that an experience as of blue is equivalent to\nthe mere disjunction \u2018Either I actually see an optical object\nthat is blue in colour, or I am in some situation\u2026 that is to\nme like that one\u2019 (1967b, 12). Snowdon groups together\nperceptions and illusions in his disjunctive characterisation of\nexperience: \u2018Either (there is something which looks to\nS to be F) or (it is to S as if there is\nsomething which looks to S to be F)\u2019. In\ncontrast, McDowell, in his appeal to the idea of facts being\nmade perceptually manifest, appears to group together illusions and\nhallucinations: an appearance that such-and-such is the case can be\n\u2018either a mere appearance or the fact that such-and-such is the\ncase making itself perceptually manifest to someone\u2019.\n\n\nThe differences in the ways these philosophers formulate their\nparticular disjunctive characterisations may in part reflect their\ndifferent particular interests in appealing to a disjunctive account of\nexperience. For example, Snowdon\u2019s primary concern is to block an\nargument about what is required for the perception of objects\n(see section 6.1), whereas McDowell is concerned to defend an account\nof experience that safeguards the distinctive epistemological role of\ngenuine perception in providing us with propositional\nknowledge. It is not clear that McDowell needs to deny that there are a\nnumber of facts made perceptually manifest to you when you suffer an\nillusion, in which case he might allow that it is possible to group\ntogether veridical perceptions and illusions as cases in which certain\nfacts are made manifest to their subject.\n\n\nSimilar considerations may apply in the case of experiences that we\nmight describe as partial hallucinations\u2014cases in\nwhich a subject hallucinates an object while veridically perceiving\nother aspects of her environment. For example a subject might\nveridically perceive a table in front of her while hallucinating a pink\nrat on top of it. One question that can be asked of McDowell\u2019s\ndisjunctivism is whether, according to it, we should treat such cases\nas ones in which the fact that there is a table in front of the subject\nis made perceptually manifest to her, despite the fact that she is\nhallucinating a pink rat.\n\n\nMartin (2004) offers a sketch of how a na\u00efve realist might\ndevelop an account of partial hallucination. He suggests that rather\nthan focusing on experiences per se, we can focus on\nthe various aspects of an experience\u2014\u201cthe\ndifferent entities that one can experience and the ways in which they\ncan appear to one\u201d (2004, 81). We can then explain those aspects\nof a partial hallucination that are not genuinely perceptual in terms\nof \u201cthat aspect of experience\u2019s indiscriminability from the\ncorresponding aspect of a perceptual awareness of that element\u201d\n(2004, 81). Martin also appeals to this idea in offering a suggestion\nas to what the disjunctivist should say about the experience of\nimpossible scenes. His suggestion is that the disjunctivist should\nexplain such experiences not by direct appeal to the idea of veridical\nperception of the impossible scene, but rather by explaining how an\nexperience with each of the constituent elements is indiscriminable in\nthat respect from a perception of that element. (For criticism of this\nproposal see Siegel 2004). One concern with this proposal is whether\nthere may be some problem for the disjunctivist in thinking of such\nexperiences as having a sort of hybrid nature, given that the\ndisjunctivists think that perceptions and hallucinations are mental\nevents with such different natures. (For an argument for the claim that\naccommodating certain illusions poses significant difficulties for the\ndisjunctivist, see Smith 2010. See also Millar 2015).\n\n\nA further question to be asked in this context is whether the\ndisjunctivist should treat all cases of illusion as equivalent to\ncases of partial hallucination. For example, if a subject perceives a\ngreen object that looks to her to be blue, should the disjunctivist\nsay that the subject is perceiving the object but hallucinating the\nblueness it seems to possess? Brewer (2008) offers a disjunctivist\naccount of certain illusions that he thinks need not be treated as\ncases of partial hallucination (e.g., the Mueller-Lyer\nillusion). According to Brewer, such illusions are simply cases in\nwhich the direct object of experience has visually relevant\nsimilarities with paradigms of a kind of which it is not in fact an\ninstance. The fact that the direct object of perception\nlooks F, but isn\u2019t, is explained in terms of the idea\nthat the object may intelligibly be taken to be F, when seen\nfrom the point of view in question, in the relevant circumstances of\nperception, in virtue of its relevant similarities with certain\nparadigm Fs. In the case of certain illusions, when an object\nlooks to be a certain way that it isn\u2019t, a disjunctivist might\nplace emphasis on the idea that this misleading appearance is publicly\nobservable; for instance, it might be the sort of thing one is able to\nphotograph. The disjunctivist might then say that in such cases we can\nascribe to the seen object a publicly observable feature\u2014a\n\u2018look\u2019 or \u2018appearance property\u2019 that the\nobject has. When one sees the object one may be visually aware of this\nappearance property\u2014its having the look of an F. And\none\u2019s awareness of this appearance property may intelligibly\nmislead one into mistakenly judging the object to be F. (For\nrelated proposals about perceptual illusions, but which differ from\nBrewer\u2019s account in important respects, see Antony 2011 and\nGenone 2014. For defence of the claim that empirically grounded models\nof illusion may be congenial to na\u00efve realism, see Phillips\n2016.) \n6. Disjunctivism and the Causal Theory of Perception\n\n\nSome philosophers associated with the disjunctive theory of perception\nare simply concerned to argue that certain common element claims lack\nadequate justification, thereby leaving us free to resist arguments\nabout perception that depend upon such claims in their premises. For\nexample, Paul Snowdon, one of the philosophers most associated with\ndisjunctivism, appeals to the possibility of a disjunctive approach to\nperceptual experience in order to undermine an argument for a thesis\nabout our concept of perception. According to the thesis that Snowdon\naims to challenge it is a conceptual requirement that, necessarily, if\nS (a subject) sees O (an object) then O is\ncausally responsible for an experience undergone by (or had by)\nS. This thesis has been labelled the Causal Theory of\nPerception (henceforth it will be referred to as the CTP).\n\n\nH.P. Grice (1961) originally propounded the main argument for the\nCTP. (Other advocates of the theory include Pears (1976) and Strawson\n(1974)). Grice\u2019s argument takes the following general form. We\nare asked to consider cases in which a subject is having an experience\nappropriate for seeing an object of a certain kind\u2014e.g., the\nsubject is having an experience such that it seems to her as if there\nis a clock in front of her. There is in fact a clock in front of the\nsubject, however, the subject fails to see the clock, for the\nsubject\u2019s experience is a hallucination\u2014perhaps induced\nby a neuroscientist stimulating her visual cortex. It is argued that\nsuch cases are indeed conceivable, and that in such cases the best\nexplanation of the subject\u2019s failure to see the object before her\nis the absence of an appropriate causal connection between the object\nand her experience. Hence the CTP is justified.\n According to Snowdon (1980, 1990, 1998, 2011), the plausibility of\nthis argument rests on a conception of perceptual experience that is\nwedded to a common element assumption\u2014in particular, the\nassumption that the kind of experience one has when one genuinely\nperceives the world is one whose intrinsic nature is independent of\nthe kinds of objects perceived. On this conception of experience,\nexperiences are amongst the events, the intrinsic natures of which are\nindependent of anything outside the subject. According to this view,\nthe \u2018looks\u2019 sentences that are true in cases of\nhallucination and in genuine perception are made true by (or are true\nin virtue of) exactly the same kind of occurrence in both cases. Once\nthis conception of perceptual experience is in play, we might then ask\nafter the extra-mental conditions required for seeing objects in our\nenvironment. The Gricean thought experiments suggest that simply\nhaving an experience that matches your surrounding environment will\nnot, in itself, be sufficient for seeing objects in your\nenvironment. So the temptation then is to think that an appropriate\ncausal connection between your experience and those objects is\nnecessary for you to see them. The motivation for the CTP is therefore\nundermined, according to Snowdon, unless it can be shown that it is\npart of our concept of perception that the common element claim\nassumed in the argument is correct.\n\n\nFollowing Hinton\u2019s lead, Snowdon argues that from the fact\nthat \u2018looks\u2019 sentences are true in cases of hallucination and in\nveridical perception, and are not ambiguous, it does not follow that\nthey are made true by (or are true in virtue of) exactly the same kind\nof occurrence in both cases, for they may instead have disjunctive\nfulfilment conditions. According to the disjunctive theory Snowdon\nconsiders, the claim that \u2018It looks to S as of there is an\nF\u2019 should be treated as being true in virtue of two\ndistinct sorts of states of affairs: Either (there is\nsomething which looks to S to be F) or (it\nis to S as if there is something which looks to S to\nbe F). This disjunctive theory allows that the two cases\n(perception and hallucination), which are described in the same way,\nmight be of a quite different nature. In particular, it allows that the\nkind of experience a subject has when she genuinely perceives the\nworld is such that its intrinsic nature is not independent of the\nkinds of objects perceived. For Snowdon, the availability of this\ndisjunctive approach to perceptual experience undermines the argument\nfor the CTP, unless proponents of the argument can say something which\nis legitimately conceptual and which shows that this disjunctive\napproach must be wrong. (So note that according to Snowdon, an\nassertion of the disjunctive theory is not actually needed for a\nrejection of the Gricean argument for the CTP.)\n\n\nFor defence of the causalist approach against disjunctivism, see Lowe\n2008. For a defence of the claim that disjunctivism is compatible with\nthe CTP, see Child 1992, 1994 and 2011.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nAs we have seen, there are a variety of different disjunctivist views,\noften motivated by quite different concerns, and the disagreements\nthat these disjunctivists have with their opponents are relevant to a\nnumber of debates in the philosophy of perception and\nepistemology\u2014debates about the metaphysics and phenomenology of\nperceptual experience, our concept of perception, the epistemological\nrole of perceptual experience, and self-knowledge. Many of the\ndisjunctivist views and arguments that have been outlined here have\nbeen proposed relatively recently, and the debates they have inspired\nseem set to continue. In a further recent development disjunctive\ntheories of perception have inspired similar disjunctive approaches in\nthe philosophy of action\u2014concerning both the ontology of action\nand a subject\u2019s reasons for performing actions.
