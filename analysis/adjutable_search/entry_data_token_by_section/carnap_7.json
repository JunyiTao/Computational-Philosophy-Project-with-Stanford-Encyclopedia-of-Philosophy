    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Values\n1.8 Values\n\nCarnap is not generally known for his (very sparse) publications about\nvalues, but what he did publish is sufficient (in conjunction with\nrecently published texts) to yield a fairly accurate insight into his\nthinking, which turns out to be sufficiently original to have\nsignificant potential for further development. Carnap\u2019s main\npublication on values is the final (and longest) chapter of his\nreplies to critics in the Schilpp volume (the Reply to Kaplan, Carnap\n1963b). On the basis of this text, Carnap has generally been\nclassified simply as an (ethical) non-cognitivist. And there is a\nclose resemblance between Carnap\u2019s proposed logic of normative\nstatements (\u201coptatives\u201d, Carnap calls them) and that of\nRichard Hare (1954) published at about the time Carnap\u2019s reply\nwas written (though it was not published until 1963). The term\n\u201cnon-cognitivist\u201d to describe the view that normative\nstatements cannot be true or false (and that therefore no\n\u201cought\u201d can be derived from an \u201cis\u201d, as Hume\nhad put it), was, in fact, proposed by Carnap\u2014one of his more\nwidely-accepted (if low-profile) coinages.\n\nHowever, it had been assumed that since Carnap required a framework to\nbe in place for any kind of rational discourse to be possible, the\nchoice of frameworks itself must be simply a matter of personal whim,\nat the level of Hume\u2019s declaration that there is no rational\nargument for me to prefer the relief of a pain in my little toe to the\nprevention of some world-engulfing catastrophe. This problem of the\nirrationality of framework choice (George 2012) or\u2014put another\nway\u2014the supposed infinite regress in the selection of\nmeta-frameworks for the choice of framework (Richardson 2007;\nSteinberger 2016; Carus 2017) has been discussed recently from various\nangles. It is a special case, in the way Carnap is still usually seen,\nof the supposedly more general impossibility, for Carnap, of bringing\nreason to bear on normative choices, since in his view all reasoning\nseems to presuppose internality to a framework.\n\nBut from an interpretive viewpoint, this was clearly an unsatisfactory\nposition, since Carnap had in fact from his earliest days used\nreasoning to argue for normative positions, and continued to do so all\nhis life. So there seemed to be a tension, at such a basic level that\none would surely think Carnap must or should have been aware of it. In\nfact, there is no tension, as it turns out that Carnap (at least in\nhis later years and probably for much of his career) held a\nquasi-Kantian view whereby the logical reasoning we employ in\nmathematics, logic, and science (including inductive logic and\ndecision theory) is conceived as subordinate to (and narrower in scope\nthan) a purely normative form of reasoning\u2014in Kantian terms,\nVerstand (understanding) is subordinate to (and narrower\nthan) Vernunft (reason). So at least it appears from a\nrecently published fragmentary draft Carnap wrote in 1958 of a\ncontinuation of or sequel to the reply to Kaplan about values that had\nappeared in the Schilpp volume (Carnap 2017); see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology\n for further discussion.\n\nMore recent forms of normative non-cognitivism have recast their\ndoctrines somewhat to describe them as \u201cexpressivist\u201d\n(Blackburn 1993; Gibbard 1990). From this starting point Huw Price\n(1988) has sought to generalize expressivism to include not only\nnormative language but other kinds as well. In some more recent\nexpositions of this proposed globalized expressivism or\n\u201cfunctional pluralism\u201d (Price 1997; see also Creath 1994\non the sense on which Carnap\u2019s view can be called\n\u201cfunctionalist\u201d), he invokes Carnap\u2019s conception of\nmathematics as the exemplar on which he proposes to model his approach\nto all sectors of language; he calls this the \u201cCarnap\nthesis\u201d, and assigns it fundamental importance in the\ndevelopment of a new \u201cglobal expressivism\u201d as he also\ncalls his position (Price 2013, 2018). In view of the discussion\nabove, it would seem that Carnap himself had already generalized his\nfunctionalist \u201cCarnap thesis\u201d regarding mathematics to at\nleast values and possibly also to other sectors of language (Carus\n2018; Price 2018). This is also consistent with the new-found interest\nin Carnap\u2019s \u201cinferentialism\u201d (Peregrin 2011,\nforthcoming; Chalmers 2012), discussed further in\n section 5\n below. Perhaps, in some respects, current philosophy is beginning to\ncatch up to Carnap.\n\n(General surveys of Carnap\u2019s work can be found in, e.g., Mormann\n2000, Friedman and Creath 2007.)\n",
