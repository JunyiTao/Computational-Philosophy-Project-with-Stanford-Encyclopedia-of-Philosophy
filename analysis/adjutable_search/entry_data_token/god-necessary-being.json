Stating the Question\n\nThe main question we will address in this article is: Does God\nground the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects? It is perhaps a more general question than a question one\nmight at first ask: Did God create necessarily existing abstracta? But\nit is the main question that philosophers who have written about the\nrelation between God and abstract objects have sought to answer.\n\nOver the last two decades, philosophers have done a great deal of work\non the notion of grounding (see, e.g., Fine 2001, Rosen 2010, Audi\n2012, Schaffer 2009 Koslicki 2012 and the Stanford Encyclopedia entry\non\n grounding).\n It is thought by many currently working on issues in the metaphysics\nof grounding that grounding is a primitive, sui generis\nrelation. In particular, it is not to be understood as a supervenience\nor causal relation. How are we then to understand what it is?\nPhilosophers point to particular cases where it is instanced:\nDispositional properties are grounded in categorical properties, the\nmental is grounded in the physical, the semantic is grounded in the\nnon-semantic, features like smiles or surfaces are grounded in facts\nabout bodies, and so on. To this point, one might think that grounding\ntalk can be captured by our ordinary notion of\n supervenience.[3]\n But Fine (2001) claims that Socrates\u2019 singleton set is grounded\nin Socrates; yet, necessarily one exists just if the other does. Thus\nour ordinary modal notion of supervenience won\u2019t capture this\ncase of grounding. If we assume (as many in the grounding literature\ndo) that the other cases of grounding are of the same sort as the\nSocrates-singleton case is, then our ordinary notion of supervenience\nwon\u2019t capture them either. \n\nOur discussion of the question of God\u2019s grounding the existence\nof necessarily existing abstracta bears on the general conversation\nabout the nature of grounding. First, we can note that our\ndivine grounding case stands alongside the Socrates-singleton case in\nshowing that ordinary supervenience won\u2019t capture the grounding\nrelationship properly. For instance, suppose we say that God grounds\nthe existence of the number 2. We then can note that, necessarily God\nexists just if 2 does (that is, each exist in every possible world).\nAccording to ordinary notions of supervenience, the number 2\nsupervenes on God, and conversely. But we are to think that God\ngrounds the existence of 2, and not vice versa. Second, we\nhave here in the case of divine grounding of abstracta a case where\nthe grounding relationship is typically spelled out in other,\nfamiliar terms (and thus isn\u2019t sui generis). As we will\nsee, a number of different philosophers who think that God grounds the\nexistence of necessarily existing abstract objects think that God does\nso in a causal manner. Others think that the grounding takes\nplace in that necessarily existing abstracta are identical\nwith divine mental states. \n\nOne might look at those who claim that God causes necessarily existing\nabstract objects or that they are identical with divine mental states\nas not asserting that God grounds the existence of necessarily\nexisting abstracta. But as we will see, each of these sorts of\ntheorists really is saying that God grounds the existence of\nnecessarily existing abstract objects. Thus, it might be better to cast our\nlot with those who are skeptical that there is a sui generis\ngrounding relationship that metaphysicians investigate. Or, if there\nis such a relationship in some cases of grounding, it isn\u2019t\npresent in all cases of grounding (it isn\u2019t\n\u201cunivocal\u201d\u2014see Hofweber 2009 and Daly 2012 for\ndiscussion). After all, it is perfectly sensible to recast \u201cDo\nnecessarily existing abstract objects depend on God?\u201d as\n\u201cAre necessarily existing abstract objects grounded in\nGod?\u201d\n\nHowever we think of the dependence relationship between God and\nnecessarily existing abstract objects, we will want to insist that on\nit God is somehow more fundamental than necessarily existing abstract\nobjects.\n Fundamentality (Stanford Encyclopedia entry)\n is an asymmetric relationship. Thus we will construe those who think\nthat God grounds the existence of necessarily existing abstracta as\nclaiming that God is more fundamental than necessarily existing\nabstracta, and not conversely. \n2. Why Might Someone Believe God Grounds the Existence of Necessarily Existing Abstract Objects?\n\nThere are at least two sorts of reasons why someone might be inclined\nto think that God grounds the existence of necessarily existing\nabstract objects. The first sort of reason involves central religious\ntexts in monotheistic faiths like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nRoughly, this sort of reason consists in these texts\u2019 assertions\nor suggestions that God has created everything. If God created\neverything, it must be that God has created necessarily existing\nabstract objects, as well. Thus, God grounds the existence of these\nabstract objects. For instance, there are statements in the Hebrew\nBible such as Psalm 89:11: \u201cThe heavens are yours, the earth\nalso is yours; the world and all that is in it\u2014you have founded\n them\u201d.[4]\n Also in the Hebrew Bible is Nehemiah 9:6: \n\n\nAnd Ezra said: \u201cYou are the Lord, you alone; you have made\nheaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all\nthat is on it, the seas and all that is in them. To all of them you\ngive life, and the host of heaven worships you\u201d. \n\n\nIn the New Testament, there are passages like John 1:1\u20131:4: \n\n\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word\nwas God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being\nthrough him, and without him not one thing came into being. (The Word\n[logos in Greek] to which John refers is Jesus of Nazareth)\n\n\n\nPaul states in Colossians 1:15\u201316, \n\n\nHe [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all\ncreation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created,\nthings visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers\nor powers\u2014all things have been created through him and for\nhim.\n\n\nOne of the most important documents for Christian faith outside the\nHebrew Bible and New Testament, the\n Nicene Creed\n of 325, says \u201cWe believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker\nof all things visible and invisible\u201d. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381,\n a modification of the older Nicene Creed of 325 that is used by the\nwestern Church begins similarly, \u201cWe believe in one God, the\nFather almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things that are\nvisible and invisible\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Qur\u2019an, \u201cGod is the Creator of all\nthings; He has charge of everything; the keys of the heavens and earth\nare His\u201d (39:62\u201363). The Qur\u2019an also says,\n\u201cThis is God, your Lord, there is no God but Him, the Creator of\nall things, so worship Him; He is in charge of everything \u201d\n (6:102).[5]\n\n\nThese reasons from authoritative religious texts may not be taken to\nbe conclusive, however. One may take these sorts of texts seriously as\nan adherent to faiths they define and still hold that God\ndoesn\u2019t have creative control over necessarily existing abstract\nobjects. For instance, Peter van Inwagen (2009) argues that the\nuniversal quantifier in claims like that of the Nicene Creed\n\u201cmaker of all things visible and invisible\u201d is implicitly\nrestricted to include only those things that are capable of being\ncreated. Necessarily existing abstract objects cannot enter into\ncausal relations and thus can\u2019t be created. But it is worth\nnoting that philosophers who think that if there are necessarily\nexisting abstract objects, God must have some sort of control over\nthem (e.g., Craig 2016) point to texts like those cited above for\njustification for this view.\n\nThere is a second sort of reasoning that may lead someone to think\nthat God grounds the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects. That is by way of perfect being theology (see Morris\n1987a, 1987b and Nagasawa 2017 for\ndiscussion). Perfect being theology is a way of theorizing a\npriori about God that goes back at least to Anselm of Canterbury.\nOne begins with the claim that God is the greatest possible being, and\nfrom there one can derive attributes that God must have. This method\nis one way of arriving at God\u2019s being omnipotent, omniscient,\nand perfectly good. Anselm himself famously thought that via perfect\nbeing theology he could conclude that God existed. For our purposes\nhere, we are to imagine two conceptually possible beings: One being\nhas grounds or explains the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects, and the other doesn\u2019t. We are to see that the being\nthat grounds these abstracta is greater than one who doesn\u2019t,\nand thus we are to conclude that God (the greatest possible being) has\ncontrol over necessarily existing abstract objects. Sometimes the\nintuition that the former being is greater than the latter is put in\nterms of God\u2019s aseity, or independence from all other\nentities. A being with maximal aseity is greater than one without it\n(other things being equal); and if necessarily existing abstract\nobjects don\u2019t depend on God, God lacks maximal aseity.\n\nThere likely would be little objection to reasoning to divine\ngrounding of necessarily existing abstracta in the above way, if\nit were thought that God could have control over these sorts of\nabstracta. However, someone might concur with van Inwagen that\nabstracta can\u2019t enter into causal relations, and say that the\nonly way that abstracta might be grounded in God is via causation. Or\nsomeone might think that the idea of a necessarily existing object\ndepending on anything is\n incoherent.[6]\n If one took either of these positions, one would deny that the being\nwho grounds necessarily existing abstract objects was greater than the\none who didn\u2019t. (Just as she would deny that a being who can\nmake a square circle is greater than one who can\u2019t\u2014there\ncan\u2019t be a being who can make a square circle.)\n\nWe have noted two sorts of reasons why a theist might think that God\ngrounds the existence of necessarily existing abstract objects. We\nturn to a discussion of some different answers to our central\nquestion: Does God ground the existence of necessarily existing\nabstract\n objects?[7]\n Each of the next two sections will begin with a list of views and\nwill follow with considerations for and against\n each.[8]\n3. God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects I: Views on Which Necessarily Existing Abstracta Are All Grounded in God\n\nThe views discussed in this section are as follows:\n\nTheistic Voluntarism: \nNecessarily existing\nabstracta are caused to exist by God\u2019s will (or some other\nnormally-contingent divine faculty). Example: Descartes.\nTheistic Emanationism:  Necessarily existing\nabstracta are caused to exist by some non-contingent divine faculty\n(e.g., the right sort of divine cognition). Example: Leibniz,\nMorris-Menzel (1986).\nTheistic Mentalism (without Divine Simplicity):\nNecessarily existing abstracta are identical with divine mental\nstates, and God isn\u2019t simple. Example: Welty (2014).\nTheistic Mentalism (with Divine Simplicity):\nNecessarily existing abstract are identical with divine mental states,\nand God is simple. Examples: Augustine, Aquinas.\n\n3.1 Theistic Voluntarism\n\nAccording to the theistic voluntarist, necessarily existing abstract\nobjects depend on the divine will, or some other contingent feature of\nGod. This is famously the view of Descartes. In a letter to Mersenne\n(27 May 1630), Descartes says:\n\n\nYou ask me by what kind of causality God established the eternal\ntruths. I reply: by the same kind of causality as he created all\nthings, that is to say, as their efficient and total cause. For it is\ncertain that he is the author of the essence of created things no less\nthan of their existence; and this essence is nothing other than the\neternal truths. I do not conceive them as emanating from God like rays\nfrom the sun; but I know that God is the author of everything and that\nthese truths are something and consequently that he is their author.\n(Descartes 1991: 25)\n\n\nDescartes makes the same sorts of claims in his public writings, as\nwell (e.g., in the reply to the Sixth Set of Objections (also from\nMersenne)). This view seems to take seriously that God truly is\nmaximally powerful; he even has volitional control over things like\nnumbers, properties, and states of affairs. Indeed, even more than\nwith views like theistic emanationism is God in control of abstracta\non this view. According to the theistic voluntarist, God could have\nmade different\u2014or no\u2014abstracta like propositions,\nproperties, and states of affairs. God is in control of abstracta like\nGod is in control of any other object: Their existence is subject to\nGod\u2019s will.\n\nOf course, the seriousness with which the theistic voluntarist takes\ndivine aseity and sovereignty is also the source of problems for the\nview. If God could have failed to make the number 2, in what sense is\n2 a necessary being? One might try to weaken the voluntarist view, by\nclaiming that 2 is only weakly necessary: God had to create it, but it\nis possibly\u2026possible that it not exist. All worlds that are\naccessible to the actual world have 2 existing in them. But some of\nthese worlds have a somewhat-different divine will relative to the\nexistence of 2 (maybe God somewhat-reluctantly wills the existence of\n2 in them). And possible relative to those sorts of worlds (or\nrelative to worlds possible to those worlds, etc.) are worlds in which\nGod doesn\u2019t will that 2 exist. The key here is that the claim:\nNecessarily, 2 exists comes out true on this picture; 2\nexists in every possible world relative to the world of evaluation\n(the actual world). But there are possibly\u2026possible worlds in\nwhich God doesn\u2019t will the existence of 2. The voluntarist can\nsay that abstracta depend on the will of God, and yet really do exist\nnecessarily (just don\u2019t say in every possible world,  full\nstop (see Plantinga 1980: 95 ff. for further discussion)).\n\nOf course, this suggestion risks two sorts of problems. The first is\nthat it doesn\u2019t take divine sovereignty seriously enough.\nImagine a being who could\u2014in a world possible relative to the\nactual world\u2014make it the case that 2 doesn\u2019t exist. That\nbeing might be thought to be more powerful than a being that only\npossibly\u2026possibly could do this. And Descartes (in places, at\nleast) seems to have this intuition; and thus plumps for a God who\ncould make it the case that 2 didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe second concern is that it abandons S5-type modal logic, in which\nanything that is necessary is necessarily necessary. This is thought\nby many to be the appropriate system of modal logic to describe the\nway actual modality\n is.[9]\n So there are concerns from both sides for this reply to the objection\nto voluntarism. On the one hand, it might be thought not to take\ndivine power seriously enough. On the other, it might not make\nabstracta \u201cnecessary enough\u201d.\n\nOne reason why Descartes is famous for holding to theistic voluntarism\nview is because so few others in the history of theological thought\nhold to it. And perhaps the main reason why no one else holds to it is\nbecause many judge that the theistic voluntarist isn\u2019t able to\naccount for the absolute necessity of necessarily existing abstracta.\nThese are objects that if they exist should exist in every possible\nworld, full stop; and once one allows for that, it makes it very\ndifficult to see how it could be up to God\u2019s will that these\nexist. Rather, if they are up to God; one winds up with a view like theistic emanationism. We\nturn to it.\n3.2 Theistic Emanationism\n\nAccording to the theistic emanationist, necessarily existing abstract\nobjects are caused to exist by some non-contingent feature of divine\nactivity. The standard feature the emanationist appeals to is divine\ncognitive activity of some sort. So, the theistic emanationist will\nsay something like that the number 2 exists because of God\u2019s\ncognitive activity. She will go on to say (and this is how the view is\ndistinct from a theistic voluntarist view) it is not possible\n(it\u2019s true in no possible world, full stop) for God\u2019s\ncognitive activity in this respect to be other than it is. Thus, the\ntheistic emanationist can hold that abstracta really exist in every\npossible world, full stop (allowing that God does, too). \n\nOne example of a theistic emanationist is Leibniz. In his\nMonadology he says:\n\n\n43. It is also true that God is not only the source of existences but\nalso that of essences insofar as they are real, that is, the source of\nthat which is real in possibility. This is because God\u2019s\nunderstanding is the realm of eternal truths, or that of the ideas on\nwhich they depend; without him there would be nothing real in\npossibles, and not only would nothing exist, but also nothing would be\npossible.\n\n44. For if there is a reality in essences or possibilities, or indeed\nin eternal truths, this reality must be grounded in something existent\nand actual, and consequently, it must be grounded in the existence of\nthe necessary being, in whom essence involves existence, that is, in\nwhom possible being is sufficient for actual being. (Leibniz 1714\n[1989: 218])\n\n\nHere Leibniz seems to suggest that necessarily existing abstracta are\ngrounded in divine cognitive activity. It\u2019s not clear exactly\nhow to characterize the relation between the cognitive activity and\nthe existence of the abstract objects, but saying that the former\ncauses the latter to exist seems appropriate given his language. \n\nThomas Morris and Christopher Menzel (1986) also are theistic\nemanationists. They invoke explicitly causal language in setting out\ntheir view, which they call \u201ctheistic activism\u201d.\n\n\nSo our suggestion is that the platonistic framework of reality arises\nout of a creatively efficacious intellective activity of God. It is in\nthis sense that God is the creator of the framework. It depends on\nhim. (1986: 356)\n\n\nThey continue later:\n\n\nLet us refer to this view, the view that a divine intellectual\nactivity is responsible for the framework of reality, as\n\u201ctheistic activism\u201d. A theistic activist will hold God\ncreatively responsible for the entire modal economy, for what is\npossible as well as what is necessary and what is impossible. The\nwhole Platonic realm is thus seen as deriving from God. (1986:\n356)\n\n\nAnd on the next page:\n\n\nGod\u2019s creation of the framework of reality\u2026is an activity\nwhich is conscious, intentional, and neither constrained nor compelled\nby anything independent of God and his causally efficacious power.\n(1986: 357)\n\n\nTheistic emanationism allows the theist to take seriously the claims\nof religious documents that God creates everything (indeed, the name\nof Morris/Menzel\u2019s paper is \u201cAbsolute Creation\u201d),\nand it avoids the problems that beset theistic voluntarism. It has\nvirtues. But it has problems of its own. First, some philosophers\nclaim that God already has to have critical properties in\norder to be able to cause abstracta to exist. The theistic\nemanationist claims that God causes properties such as being\nomniscient, being omnipotent, existing\nnecessarily, being able to cause abstracta to exist, and\nhaving cognitive activity to exist. She also claims that God\ncauses his own haecceity, being God, to exist. However, to\nclaim this is to get the dependence relationship backwards, one might\ncharge. Surely, God\u2019s being able to cause abstract objects to\nexist must be posterior to his having properties like the ones\nmentioned above. And if God has these properties, they must exist.\nBut, the proponent of this theory is committed to the existence of\nproperties being posterior to God\u2019s causing them to exist. Thus,\nthe objection concludes, theistic emanationism is false (see Leftow\n1990, Davison 1991, Davidson 1999, Bergmann and Brower 2006 for\ndiscussion of this sort of objection).\n\nThis sort of argument has seemed to many to be decisive. However,\nthere is a response that the theistic emanationist can give at this\npoint. It might be claimed that although God\u2019s ability to cause\nabstracta to exist is logically dependent on his having certain\nproperties, it is not causally dependent. The account would be\nproblematically circular only if God\u2019s ability to cause\nabstracta to exist were causally dependent on his having certain\nproperties, and his having these properties were in turn causally\ndependent on his having caused these properties to exist. There is a\ncircle of logical dependence here (as there is between any two\nnecessary truths), but there is no circle of causal dependence (see\nMorris and Menzel for this sort of reply).\n\nThe opponent of theistic emanationism might make the following retort.\nCertainly, the above response is right in that if there is a problem\nof circularity, it is one of causal circularity. Earlier, we saw that\nthere for the theistic emanationist is a one-way causal relationship\nbetween God\u2019s cognitive activity and the existence of abstracta\nsuch as being the number two. We can say that the necessary\nexistence of being the number two (or any abstract object)\ncausally depends on God\u2019s having the cognitive activity that he\ndoes. Or, perhaps we might say that the necessary existence of\nbeing the number two causally depends on God\u2019s being\nomniscient, omnipotent and existing necessarily. However, the entities\non which being the number two causally depends are themselves\nproperties. On what do they causally depend? It seems that on the\nemanationist account they wind up causally depending on themselves.\nBut this is incoherent, one might charge.\n\nEven if the emanationist successfully replies to this first problem\nfor the view, there is a second, and perhaps more serious objection to\nthe view. We will call this objection \u201cthe bootstrapping\nobjection\u201d (see Leftow 1990, Davidson 1999, Bergmann and Brower\n2006, and Gould 2014b for discussion of this sort of objection). We\ncan put the concern this way (following Davidson 1999). To cause\nsomething to exist is to cause its essence (or, in the terminology of\nPlantinga 1980, its nature) to be exemplified. Suppose God\ncreates a certain table which has as a part of its essence being\nred. Then God causes the property being red to be\nexemplified by the table when he creates it. Consider the property\nbeing omnipotent. The property being exemplified by\nGod is contained in its essence. So, God causes the property\nbeing exemplified by God to be exemplified by being\nomnipotent in causing being omnipotent to exist. Similar\nto the manner with which God causes being red to be\nexemplified by the table in exemplifying the table\u2019s essence,\nGod causes being omnipotent to be exemplified by himself.\nBut, surely God can\u2019t cause the property being\nomnipotent to be exemplified by himself: How can God make himself\nomnipotent? Furthermore, one might think that God\u2019s omnipotence\nshould be causally prior to his causing properties to exist. However,\non this occasion it is not. Then, if one does think that God\u2019s\nomnipotence should be causally prior to his causing properties to\nexist, this would be an instance of causal circularity. This sort of\nargument will work for other properties like being omniscient\nor having divine cognitive activity (although the causal\ncircle may be more difficult to establish with the former, and the\nimplausibility of self-exemplification may be more difficult to\nestablish with the latter).\n\nFurthermore, consider God\u2019s haecceity, the property being\nGod. The property being necessarily exemplified is\ncontained in the essence of this property. So, when God causes his\nhaecceity to exist, he causes the property being necessarily\nexemplified to be exemplified by his haecceity. Just as God\ncauses being red to be exemplified by the table when he\ncauses it to exist, God causes being God to be exemplified\nnecessarily. However, one might well think this incoherent. Indeed, it\nseems this is the divine causing his own existence: God is pulling\nhimself up by his own bootstraps.\n\nThe theistic emanationist needs to address these sorts of concerns\nabout bootstrapping, and it is not clear how that could be done.\n3.3 Theistic Mentalism (without Divine Simplicity)\n\nOne sort of theistic mentalism is the view that necessarily existing\nabstract objects are divine mental states, and that God isn\u2019t\n simple.[10]\n On this view, God is distinct from his mental states, and abstracta\nare identical with these mental states. One proponent of this view is\nWelty (2014). He says\n\n\nI maintain that [abstract objects] are constitutively\ndependent on God, for they are constituted by the divine ideas, which\ninhere in the divine mind and have no existence outside\nit\u2026[Abstract objects] are necessarily existing, uncreated\ndivine ideas that are distinct from God and dependent on God. (2014:\n81)\n\n\nWhy might someone adopt theistic mentalism? One could make the\nfollowing sort of case. Thoughts (e.g., sentences in the language of\nthought) are capable of representing the world as being a particular\nway. Propositions are capable of representing the world as being a\nparticular way. Why do we need both of these sorts of intentional\nentities? We can simply identify propositions and thoughts, and we get\na simpler ontology.\n\nOf course, there is a problem here. If the thoughts we speak of here\nare human thoughts, there are continuum-many true propositions, and\nfinitely many human thoughts. Also, there are propositions true in\nworlds where there are no human thoughts. So we can\u2019t identify\npropositions and human thoughts. But we don\u2019t have this problem\nwith divine thoughts. God, we may grant, exists necessarily. And God\nhas sufficiently many mental states to stand in for true propositions\n(see Plantinga 1980, 1982).\n\nIf we identify propositions with divine thoughts, we have enough of\nthem in all possible situations. And one has one fewer kind of thing\nif one admits only thoughts (divine and otherwise) rather than\nthoughts and propositions. But there are reasons to think\nthere are both thoughts and propositions and that the two\nshouldn\u2019t be identified, even if one identifies propositions and\ndivine thoughts. The most straightforward reason is that thoughts are\na different kind of entity from propositions. The former are concrete,\nand the latter abstract. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting the\nconceptual role propositions play. They are the sorts of things that\ncan be affirmed, doubted, believed, and questioned. They can be true\nand false, necessary and possible. It is said by some that they are\nsets of possible worlds; and by others that they are composite\nentities, made up of properties and relations, and perhaps concrete\nindividuals. It\u2019s not at all clear that thoughts, especially\ndivine thoughts, satisfy any of these conceptual roles.\n\nWe also should ask about other necessarily existing abstracta. What\nsorts of mental entities are they? Do they relate to one another, as\nconcrete mental tokens, in the right sort of way such that they mirror\nthe ways that Platonic states of affairs, propositions, properties,\nrelations, and numbers relate to each other? \n\nWhat these considerations suggest is that theistic mentalism may\nactually be a sort of nominalism about abstract objects, in the way\nthat Plantinga (2003: ch. 10) says Lewis\u2019 (1986) conception of\npossible worlds is a sort of nominalism about possible worlds. At\nbest, we have concrete things that play the roles of necessarily\nexisting abstract objects. (And the theistic mentalist has a great deal\nmore work in specifying concrete divine mental particulars such that\nwe have all the requisite role-players among the various sorts of\nnecessarily existing abstract objects. It is presumably not enough to\nsay that propositions are divine thoughts and leave it at that.)\n\nLet us return to the initial motivation for theistic mentalism: There\nare two sorts of intentional objects (propositions and thoughts), and\nit would be a simpler metaphysic to identify tokens of the two sorts.\nTo assess this, we must ask if the tokens of the two sorts are enough\nlike each other to be identified. That is, simplicity isn\u2019t the\nonly consideration relevant here. After all, Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysic (necessarily there is one object that is exactly as it is\nin the actual world) is maximally simple, yet has few proponents\nwithin western philosophy. Furthermore, if we are able to explain the\nintentionality of one of these sorts of entities by its relation to\nthe other, it will seem less mysterious that we have two classes of\nintentional entities. That is precisely what many want to say about\nthe intentionality of thoughts vis-\u00e0-vis that of propositions:\nThoughts derive their intentionality by standing in the right sort of\nrelation to propositions. So, the reason why my thought is a thought\nthat grass is green is because it has the propositional content\nthat grass is green. The proposition that grass is\ngreen has its intentionality intrinsically.\n3.4 Theistic Mentalism (with Divine Simplicity)\n\nTheistic mentalism with divine simplicity is the view that necessarily\nexisting abstracta are identical with divine mental states, and that\nGod is simple. Because God is simple, each abstract object is\nidentical with God and thus each other. This is a view held most\nfamously by Augustine and\n Aquinas.[11]\n Because this is a mentalist view, the criticisms leveled in the\nsection on theistic mentalism without divine simplicity will apply\nhere. In addition, the person who accepts divine simplicity alongside\nher divine mentalism also will face\n criticisms of divine simplicity.\n Plantinga (1980) is perhaps the locus classicus of\ncontemporary criticism of divine simplicity. He argues that according\nto divine simplicity, God is identical with his attributes and has\n(all of) his attributes essentially. But, he argues, God isn\u2019t\nan attribute; and God has many different attributes. (For discussion\nmore sympathetic to divine simplicity, see Mann 1982; Stump and\nKretzmann 1985; Leftow 1990; Stump 1997; Wolterstorff 1991; and\nBergmann and Brower 2006.) The sorts of difficulties that Plantinga\nhas raised have seemed decisive to many. (It is beyond the scope of\nthis essay to evaluate them, however.) This isn\u2019t to say that\nthey can\u2019t be met. But the theistic mentalist who accepts divine\nsimplicity has, prima facie, a great number of difficulties\nwith her view.\n4. God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects II: Views on Which There Aren\u2019t Necessarily Existing Abstract Objects that All Are Grounded in God\n\nTheistic Platonism: There are necessarily\nexisting abstract objects, and none of them are grounded in God.\nExample: van Inwagen (2009).\nTheistic Nominalism: There are no necessarily\nexisting abstract objects. Example: Craig (2016).\nMixed View 1: Mentalism-Platonism: Example: Gould\nand Davis (2014).\nMixed View 2: Anti-Bootstrapping Emanationism:\nAny abstracta that create \u201cbootstrapping\u201d problems\naren\u2019t grounded in God. Theistic emanationism is true of the\nothers.\n\n4.1 Theistic Platonism\n\nAccording to the theistic Platonist, there are at least some\nnecessarily existing abstract objects (e.g., propositions, properties,\nrelations, numbers, and states of affairs), and the existence of all\nof the necessarily existing abstracta is not grounded in God. Peter\nvan Inwagen (2009) is a paradigm case of a theistic Platonist. As we\nsaw earlier, van Inwagen argues that if necessarily existing abstract\nobjects were grounded in God, they would be caused to exist by God.\nBut necessarily existing abstracta can\u2019t enter into causal\nrelations. So they aren\u2019t grounded in God. He says:\n\n\nIn the end, I can find no sense in the idea that God creates free\nabstract objects [things like propositions, relations, numbers,\nproperties, etc.], no sense in the idea that the existence of free\nabstract objects in some way depends on the activities of God. (Recall\nthat, although I believe that all abstract objects are free,\nthat is not a position that I am concerned to defend in this chapter.)\nAnd that is because the existence of free abstract objects depends on\nnothing. Their existence has nothing to do with causation\u2026\nCausation is simply irrelevant to the being (and the\nintrinsic properties) of abstract objects (2009: 18).\n\n\nVan Inwagen takes his most serious challenge to be from religious\ntexts that he, as a Christian, thinks are authoritative. He speaks\nparticularly of the beginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\nwhich begins, \u201cI believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker\nof heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen\u201d. He thinks\nhere that the quantifier in \u201call that is seen and unseen\u201d\nis restricted to things that are capable of entering into causal\nrelations and thus are capable of being created. As van Inwagen points\nout, there are other authoritative Christian texts in which a\nuniversal quantifier is read in a restricted manner (e.g., Matthew\n19:26 \u201cfor God all things are possible\u201d; see also Luke\n1:37, Mark 10:27). No such passage should be taken as a prooftext for\na Cartesian view of omnipotence. Rather, the quantifier is read in a\nrestricted manner. Similarly, the quantifier is restricted in the case\nof the beginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.\n\nIt is worth noting that van Inwagen\u2019s argument here is slightly\ndifferent from one that often occurs around these sorts of texts.\nOften, there is discussion as to whether the writers of the\nauthoritative texts had in mind things like necessarily existing\nabstracta (e.g., Wolterstorff 1970: 293; Morris and Menzel 1986: 354).\nTo the person who says that the writers of these texts didn\u2019t\nhave, say, structured propositions in mind when they claimed God\ncreated everything; it is pointed out that neither did they have in\nmind (clearly-created) things like quarks and bosons (e.g., Davidson\n1999: 278\u2013279). Rather, van Inwagen argues that a text like the\nbeginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed has to be read in a\nrestricted manner if it is to avoid asserting impossible propositions.\nAnd this seems the right way to go for the theistic Platonist. It is\nvery difficult to discern the scope of the universal quantifier in the\nusage of writers from nearly 2000 years ago. (This is apart from\nquestions about the connection between intention and semantic\ncontent.)\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s main focus is on authoritative texts like the\nNiceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. But we noted earlier a second sort of\nreason for adopting a view on which any necessarily existing abstract\nobjects depend on God. That second sort of reason is perfect-being\ntheology. Again, the line of reasoning is that a being who is such\nthat necessarily existing abstracta depend on it is greater than a\nbeing on whom they don\u2019t depend. And God is the greatest\npossible being. It is clear what van Inwagen would say at this point:\nIt\u2019s not possible for necessarily existing abstract objects to\ndepend on anything. Thus, being an x such that necessarily\nexisting abstracta depend on x is not a great-making property.\nThat this isn\u2019t a great-making property is the sort of thing the\ntheistic Platonist needs to say to the perfect-being defender of\ndivine grounding of necessarily existing abstracta. It must be that\nthese things can\u2019t depend on God or anyone else. (One may or may\nnot adopt Inwagen\u2019s particular argument that they\ncan\u2019t.)\n\nThus, if the theistic Platonist thinks there are good arguments that\nnecessarily existing abstract objects can\u2019t be grounded in God,\nshe will have reason to do two things. First, she will have reason\nread the relevant universal quantifications in authoritative texts as\nrestricted. Second, if she accepts the sort of reasoning in perfect\nbeing theology; she will have reason to insist that being an x\nsuch that necessarily existing abstracta depend on x is not a\ngreat-making property (any more than being able to create a square\ncircle is).\n4.2 Theistic Nominalism\n\nThe theistic nominalist doesn\u2019t think there are necessarily\nexisting abstract objects. She may or may not think if there were\nnecessarily existing abstract objects, they would be grounded in God.\nFor instance, William Lane Craig (2016) who is a theistic nominalist;\nthinks that were there necessarily existing abstracta, they would have\nto be grounded in God. (We presumably should count Craig as someone who thinks there are true counterpossibles.) But one can imagine someone who thinks that if\nthings like numbers and properties did exist, theistic Platonism would\nbe a plausible view to adopt. It is worth noting that very\nfew\u2014if any\u2014of the realists about necessarily existing\nabstracta who are theists are themselves realists because\nthey are theists. Rather, they are realists about necessarily existing\nabstracta for other sorts of reasons (e.g.,\n indispensability arguments,\n arguments that we quantify over them with true sentences, or arguments that true sentences (e.g., that 2+3=5)\nrequire them as truthmakers (see Rodriguez-Pereyra (2005) for a\ndefense of truthmakers). Van Inwagen himself believes in necessarily\nexisting abstract objects because he thinks that we are committed to\ntrue existential quantifications over them (e.g., van Inwagen 2014:\nch. 8). There is nothing in particular the theistic nominalist needs\nto say qua theist about the existence of necessarily existing\nabstracta that any other\n nominalist\n doesn\u2019t need to say. One advantage of theistic nominalism is\nthat it allows one to avoid some of the sorts of difficult maneuvers\nthat those who believe God grounds the existence of necessarily\nexisting abstract objects wind up performing. Another advantage of\ntheistic nominalism is that it allows one, if she wishes, to avoid\ndebates about the semantics of universal quantifiers in ancient\nreligious texts. Of course, theistic nominalism is open only to those\nwho find plausible nominalistic replies to standard arguments for\nrealism about necessarily existing abstracta. Craig himself thinks\nthat he can give replies to these standard arguments for realism\n(2016: ch. 3, 6,\n 7).[12]\n\nWe turn now to two \u201cmixed views\u201d, views on which different\ntypes of abstracta stand in different grounding relations to God. Both\nof them try to bracket abstracta having to do with God (e.g.,\nGod\u2019s own attributes), and to say that God doesn\u2019t ground\nthose. But God grounds all the other necessarily existing\nabstracta.\n4.3 Mixed View 1: Mentalism-Platonism\n\nOn this view, propositions are identical with divine mental states;\nand properties and relations not exemplified by God are independent of\nGod, a la theistic Platonism. This is the view of Gould and Davis\n(2014). They say, \u201cThus, abstract objects exist in two realms:\nthe divine mind and Plato\u2019s heaven \u201d (2014: 61). They\ndecline to say in this particular essay whether mentalism or Platonism\nis true of other sorts of abstract objects (e.g., numbers, states of\naffairs, possible worlds). So what we have in Gould and Davis is an\ninitial sketch of a proposal. They are motivated by bootstrapping\nworries for theistic activism (itself an emanationist view). They\nthink that they can evade bootstrapping objections by having some\nabstracta be identical with divine mental states, and having the\nothers not grounded in God. Their own name for this view is\n\u201cmodified theistic activism\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps strange that, having started with theistic activism (an\nemanationist view) and its bootstrapping worries, they wind up with a\npart-mentalist view. It would seem that they could have kept some\nabstracta causally grounded in God, and others independent of God (see\n Mixed View 2,\n below). Also, this first Mixed View will face objections of the sort\nfaced by theistic Platonism; viz. that it doesn\u2019t take divine\naseity seriously enough, and that it must read the quantifiers in the\nrelevant religious texts in a restricted manner. Furthermore, it is\npeculiar that propositions wind up as divine mental states, but\nproperties and relations wind up independent of God. One natural\nunderstanding of propositions is that they are structured entities,\nmade up of properties and relations. Another is that they are sets of\npossible worlds. The former understanding seems unavailable to Gould\nand Davis, and the latter would seem to involve having sui\ngeneris primitive possible worlds identical with divine mental\nstates. But at that point, why not just be a thoroughgoing theistic\nmentalist? After all, bootstrapping isn\u2019t a concern for the\nmentalist. Furthermore, bootstrapping worries arise with abstracta\nother than properties. For instance, consider the proposition God\nis omnipotent. In any possible world it exists, it is true. That\nis, it has being true as part of its essence. But\nthen, if God causes it to exist, God causes it to be true. So we have\nthe same sorts of bootstrapping concerns as we did with a property\nlike being omnipotent.\n4.4 Mixed View 2: Anti-Bootstrapping Emanationism\n\nThis is a view designed wholly to avoid bootstrapping worries that\naffect theistic emanationism. It really is a sort of modified\ntheistic activism, and it may actually be the sort of view Gould and\nDavis (2014) would like to hold. The idea is this: Ascertain the\nnecessarily existing abstracta that cause bootstrapping problems\n(e.g., being God, being omnipotent, etc.) for the\nemanationist. Those exist independently of God. All other necessarily\nexisting abstracta are causally grounded in God in the way the\ntheistic emanationist thinks abstracta are grounded in God. \n\nSo far as I can tell, no one holds this first mixed view. Perhaps the\nreader is thinking that that is because it is obviously ad\nhoc: The sole motivation for the two classes of abstracta in the\ntheory is avoidance of bootstrapping worries. This is too strong, I\nthink. There is a reason why certain abstracta create\nbootstrapping problem. That reason is that they have to do with God in\na way that other abstracta that don\u2019t cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t. So why not say that Leibniz or Menzel and Morris\nare right about all the non-God related abstracta? To put it another\nway, why not be an emanationist about all the abstracta one can be an\nemanationist about\u2014those that don\u2019t have to do with God?\n\n\nThat said, there is at least a whiff of ad-hocness here. The\nmotivation for this theory presumably would be that of perfect being\ntheology. For the proponent of this first mixed view must think that\nthe quantifiers in relevant religious texts are actually restricted.\nThey aren\u2019t as restricted as the theistic Platonist\nthinks they are. But she will agree with the theistic Platonist that\nit\u2019s false that all (read the quantifier wide open) entities are\ncreated by/depend on/grounded in God. It\u2019s worth pointing out\nthat it\u2019s not clear how to delineate precisely those abstracta\nthat lead to bootstrapping problems and those that don\u2019t. The\nbest one can do seems to be to say that those that cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t depend on God, and all others God causes to\nexist. But presumably for each necessarily existing abstract object,\neither it gives rise to bootstrapping problems, or it doesn\u2019t.\nSo there should be two non-overlapping classes of abstract objects at\nhand here, even if we\u2019re not able to specify more descriptively\nwhich abstracta are in which class.\n\nIt would be better if the emanationist could find a cogent reply to\nbootstrapping concerns. But if she can\u2019t, she may plump for\nbeing an emanationist about all abstracta save those having to do with\nGod.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Robert Merrihew, 1983, \u201cDivine Necessity\u201d,\n<em>The Journal of Philosophy</em>, 80(11): 741\u2013752.\ndoi:10.2307/2026018", "Audi, Paul, 2012, \u201cA Clarification and Defense of the Notion\nof Grounding\u201d, in Correia and Schnieder 2012: 101\u2013121.\ndoi:10.1017/CBO9781139149136.004", "Augustine, \u201cOn Ideas\u201d, from <em>Eighty-Three Different\nQuestions</em>, David L.
