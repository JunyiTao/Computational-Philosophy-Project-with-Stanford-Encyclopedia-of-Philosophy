    "main_text": "\n\nSymmetry considerations dominate modern fundamental physics, both in\nquantum theory and in relativity. Philosophers are now beginning to\ndevote increasing attention to such issues as the significance of\ngauge symmetry, quantum particle identity in the light of permutation\nsymmetry, how to make sense of parity violation, the role of symmetry\nbreaking, the empirical status of symmetry principles, and so forth.\nThese issues relate directly to traditional problems in the philosophy\nof science, including the status of the laws of nature, the\nrelationships between mathematics, physical theory, and the world, and\nthe extent to which mathematics suggests new physics.\n\nThis entry begins with a brief description of the historical roots and\nemergence of the concept of symmetry that is at work in modern\nscience. It then turns to the application of this concept to physics,\ndistinguishing between two different uses of symmetry: symmetry\nprinciples versus symmetry arguments. It mentions the different\nvarieties of physical symmetries, outlining the ways in which they\nwere introduced into physics. Then, stepping back from the details of\nthe various symmetries, it makes some remarks of a general nature\nconcerning the status and significance of symmetries in physics.\n",
