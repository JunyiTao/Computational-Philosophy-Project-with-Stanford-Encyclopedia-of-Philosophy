Is There Such a Thing As Intrinsic Value At All?\n\nIn the history of philosophy, relatively few seem to have entertained\ndoubts about the concept of intrinsic value. Much of the debate about\nintrinsic value has tended to be about what things actually do have\nsuch value. However, once questions about the concept itself were\nraised, doubts about its metaphysical implications, its moral\nsignificance, and even its very coherence began to appear.\n\nConsider, first, the metaphysics underlying ascriptions of intrinsic\nvalue. It seems safe to say that, before the twentieth century, most\nmoral philosophers presupposed that the intrinsic goodness of\nsomething is a genuine property of that thing, one that is no less\nreal than the properties (of being pleasant, of satisfying a need, or\nwhatever) in virtue of which the thing in question is good. (Several\ndissented from this view, however. Especially well known for their\ndissent are Thomas Hobbes [1588\u20131679], who believed the goodness\nor badness of something to be constituted by the desire or aversion\nthat one may have regarding it, and David Hume [1711\u20131776], who\nsimilarly took all ascriptions of value to involve projections of\none\u2019s own sentiments onto whatever is said to have value. See\nHobbes 1651, Hume 1739.) It was not until Moore argued that this view\nimplies that intrinsic goodness, as a supervening property, is a very\ndifferent sort of property (one that he called\n\u201cnonnatural\u201d) from those (which he called\n\u201cnatural\u201d) upon which it supervenes, that doubts about the\nview proliferated.\n\nOne of the first to raise such doubts and to press for a view quite\ndifferent from the prevailing view was Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m\n[1868\u20131939], who developed an account according to which\nascriptions of value are neither true nor false (H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m\n1953). This view has come to be called \u201cnoncognitivism.\u201d\nThe particular brand of noncognitivism proposed by\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m is usually called \u201cemotivism,\u201d since\nit holds (in a manner reminiscent of Hume) that ascriptions of value\nare in essence expressions of emotion. (For example, an emotivist of a\nparticularly simple kind might claim that to say \u201cA is\ngood\u201d is not to make a statement about A but to say\nsomething like \u201cHooray for A!\u201d) This view was\ntaken up by several philosophers, including most notably A. J. Ayer\n[1910\u20131989] and Charles L. Stevenson [1908\u20131979] (see Ayer\n1946, Stevenson 1944). Other philosophers have since embraced other\nforms of noncognitivism. R. M. Hare [1919\u20132002], for example,\nadvocated the theory of \u201cprescriptivism\u201d (according to\nwhich moral judgments, including judgments about goodness and badness,\nare not descriptive statements about the world but rather constitute a\nkind of command as to how we are to act; see Hare 1952) and Simon\nBlackburn and Allan Gibbard have since proposed yet other versions of\nnoncognitivism (Blackburn 1984, Gibbard 1990).\n\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m characterized his own view as a type of\n\u201cvalue-nihilism,\u201d and many have followed suit in taking\nnoncognitivism of all kinds to constitute a rejection of the very idea\nof intrinsic value. But this seems to be a mistake. We should\ndistinguish questions about value from questions about\nevaluation. Questions about value fall into two main groups,\nconceptual (of the sort discussed in the last section) and\nsubstantive (of the sort discussed in the first section).\nQuestions about evaluation have to do with what precisely is going on\nwhen we ascribe value to something. Cognitivists claim that\nour ascriptions of value constitute statements that are either true or\nfalse; noncognitivists deny this. But even noncognitivists must\nrecognize that our ascriptions of value fall into two fundamental\nclasses\u2014ascriptions of intrinsic value and ascriptions of\nextrinsic value\u2014and so they too must concern themselves with the\nvery same conceptual and substantive questions about value as\ncognitivists address. It may be that noncognitivism dictates or rules\nout certain answers to these questions that cognitivism does not, but\nthat is of course quite a different matter from rejecting the very\nidea of intrinsic value on metaphysical grounds.\n\nAnother type of metaphysical challenge to intrinsic value stems from\nthe theory of \u201cpragmatism,\u201d especially in the form\nadvanced by John Dewey [1859\u20131952] (see Dewey 1922). According\nto the pragmatist, the world is constantly changing in such a way that\nthe solution to one problem becomes the source of another, what is an\nend in one context is a means in another, and thus it is a mistake to\nseek or offer a timeless list of intrinsic goods and evils, of ends to\nbe achieved or avoided for their own sakes. This theme has been\nelaborated by Monroe Beardsley, who attacks the very notion of\nintrinsic value (Beardsley 1965; cf. Conee 1982). Denying that the\nexistence of something with extrinsic value presupposes the existence\nof something else with intrinsic value, Beardsley argues that all\nvalue is extrinsic. (In the course of his argument, Beardsley rejects\nthe sort of \u201cdialectical demonstration\u201d of intrinsic value\nthat was attempted in the last section, when an explanation of the\nderivative value of helping others was given in terms of some\nnonderivative value.) A quick response to Beardsley\u2019s misgivings\nabout intrinsic value would be to admit that it may well be that, the\nworld being as complex as it is, nothing is such that its value is\nwholly intrinsic; perhaps whatever has intrinsic value also has\nextrinsic value, and of course many things that have extrinsic value\nwill have no (or, at least, neutral) intrinsic value. Far from\nrepudiating the notion of intrinsic value, though, this admission\nwould confirm its legitimacy. But Beardsley would insist that this\nquick response misses the point of his attack, and that it really is\nthe case, not just that whatever has value has extrinsic value, but\nalso that nothing has intrinsic value. His argument for this view is\nbased on the claim that the concept of intrinsic value is\n\u201cinapplicable,\u201d in that, even if something had such value,\nwe could not know this and hence its having such value could play no\nrole in our reasoning about value. But here Beardsley seems to be\noverreaching. Even if it were the case that we cannot know\nwhether something has intrinsic value, this of course leaves open the\nquestion whether anything does have such value. And even if\nit could somehow be shown that nothing does have such value,\nthis would still leave open the question whether something\ncould have such value. If the answer to this last question is\n\u201cyes,\u201d then the legitimacy of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue is in fact confirmed rather than refuted.\n\nAs has been noted, some philosophers do indeed doubt the legitimacy,\nthe very coherence, of the concept of intrinsic value. Before we turn\nto a discussion of this issue, however, let us for the moment presume\nthat the concept is coherent and address a different sort of doubt:\nthe doubt that the concept has any great moral significance. Recall\nthe suggestion, mentioned in the last section, that discussions of\nintrinsic value may have been compromised by a failure to distinguish\ncertain concepts. This suggestion is at the heart of Christine\nKorsgaard\u2019s \u201cTwo Distinctions in Goodness\u201d\n(Korsgaard 1983). Korsgaard notes that \u201cintrinsic value\u201d\nhas traditionally been contrasted with \u201cinstrumental\nvalue\u201d (the value that something has in virtue of being a means\nto an end) and claims that this approach is misleading. She contends\nthat \u201cinstrumental value\u201d is to be contrasted with\n\u201cfinal value,\u201d that is, the value that something has as an\nend or for its own sake; however, \u201cintrinsic value\u201d (the\nvalue that something has in itself, that is, in virtue of its\nintrinsic, nonrelational properties) is to be contrasted with\n\u201cextrinsic value\u201d (the value that something has in virtue\nof its extrinsic, relational properties). (An example of a\nnonrelational property is the property of being round; an example of a\nrelational property is the property of being loved.) As an\nillustration of final value, Korsgaard suggests that gorgeously\nenameled frying pans are, in virtue of the role they play in our\nlives, good for their own sakes. In like fashion, Beardsley wonders\nwhether a rare stamp may be good for its own sake (Beardsley 1965);\nShelly Kagan says that the pen that Abraham Lincoln used to sign the\nEmancipation Proclamation may well be good for its own sake (Kagan\n1998); and others have offered similar examples (cf. Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Notice that in each case the\nvalue being attributed to the object in question is (allegedly) had in\nvirtue of some extrinsic property of the object. This puts\nthe moral significance of intrinsic value into question,\nsince (as is apparent from our discussion so far) it is with the\nnotion of something\u2019s being valuable for its own sake that\nphilosophers have traditionally been, and continue to be, primarily\nconcerned.\n\nThere is an important corollary to drawing a distinction between\nintrinsic value and final value (and between extrinsic value and\nnonfinal value), and that is that, contrary to what Korsgaard herself\ninitially says, it may be a mistake to contrast final value with\ninstrumental value. If it is possible, as Korsgaard claims, that final\nvalue sometimes supervenes on extrinsic properties, then it might be\npossible that it sometimes supervenes in particular on the property of\nbeing a means to some other end. Indeed, Korsgaard herself suggests\nthis when she says that \u201ccertain kinds of things, such as\nluxurious instruments, \u2026 are valued for their own sakes under\nthe condition of their usefulness\u201d (Korsgaard 1983, p. 185).\nKagan also tentatively endorses this idea. If the idea is coherent,\nthen we should in principle distinguish two kinds of instrumental\nvalue, one final and the other\n nonfinal.[5]\n If something A is a means to something else B and\nhas instrumental value in virtue of this fact, such value will be\nnonfinal if it is merely derivative from or reflective of\nB\u2019s value, whereas it will be final if it is\nnonderivative, that is, if it is a value that A has in its\nown right (due to the fact that it is a means to B),\nirrespective of any value that B may or may not have in\nits own right.\n\nEven if it is agreed that it is final value that is central to the\nconcerns of moral philosophers, we should be careful in drawing the\nconclusion that intrinsic value is not central to their concerns.\nFirst, there is no necessity that the term \u201cintrinsic\nvalue\u201d be reserved for the value that something has in virtue of\nits intrinsic properties; presumably it has been used by many writers\nsimply to refer to what Korsgaard calls final value, in which case the\nmoral significance of (what is thus called) intrinsic value has of\ncourse not been thrown into doubt. Nonetheless, it should probably be\nconceded that \u201cfinal value\u201d is a more suitable term than\n\u201cintrinsic value\u201d to refer to the sort of value in\nquestion, since the latter term certainly does suggest value that\nsupervenes on intrinsic properties. But here a second point can be\nmade, and that is that, even if use of the term \u201cintrinsic\nvalue\u201d is restricted accordingly, it is arguable that, contrary\nto Korsgaard\u2019s contention, all final value does after all\nsupervene on intrinsic properties alone; if that were the case, there\nwould seem to be no reason not to continue to use the term\n\u201cintrinsic value\u201d to refer to final value. Whether this is\nin fact the case depends in part on just what sort of thing\ncan be valuable for its own sake\u2014an issue to be taken\nup in the next section.\n\nIn light of the matter just discussed, we must now decide what\nterminology to adopt. It is clear that moral philosophers since\nancient times have been concerned with the distinction between the\nvalue that something has for its own sake (the sort of nonderivative\nvalue that Korsgaard calls \u201cfinal value\u201d) and the value\nthat something has for the sake of something else to which it is\nrelated in some way. However, given the weight of tradition, it seems\njustifiable, perhaps even advisable, to continue, despite\nKorsgaard\u2019s misgivings, to use the terms \u201cintrinsic\nvalue\u201d and \u201cextrinsic value\u201d to refer to these two\ntypes of value; if we do so, however, we should explicitly note that\nthis practice is not itself intended to endorse, or reject, the view\nthat intrinsic value supervenes on intrinsic properties alone.\n\nLet us now turn to doubts about the very coherence of the concept of\nintrinsic value, so understood. In Principia Ethica and\nelsewhere, Moore embraces the consequentialist view, mentioned above,\nthat whether an action is morally right or wrong turns exclusively on\nwhether its consequences are intrinsically better than those of its\nalternatives. Some philosophers have recently argued that ascribing\nintrinsic value to consequences in this way is fundamentally\nmisconceived. Peter Geach, for example, argues that Moore makes a\nserious mistake when comparing \u201cgood\u201d with\n \u201cyellow.\u201d[6]\n Moore says that both terms express unanalyzable concepts but are to\nbe distinguished in that, whereas the latter refers to a natural\nproperty, the former refers to a nonnatural one. Geach contends that\nthere is a mistaken assimilation underlying Moore\u2019s remarks,\nsince \u201cgood\u201d in fact operates in a way quite unlike that\nof \u201cyellow\u201d\u2014something that Moore wholly overlooks.\nThis contention would appear to be confirmed by the observation that\nthe phrase \u201cx is a yellow bird\u201d splits up\nlogically (as Geach puts it) into the phrase \u201cx is a\nbird and x is yellow,\u201d whereas the phrase\n\u201cx is a good singer\u201d does not split up in the\nsame way. Also, from \u201cx is a yellow bird\u201d and\n\u201ca bird is an animal\u201d we do not hesitate to infer\n\u201cx is a yellow animal,\u201d whereas no similar\ninference seems warranted in the case of \u201cx is a good\nsinger\u201d and \u201ca singer is a person.\u201d On the basis of\nthese observations Geach concludes that nothing can be good in the\nfree-standing way that Moore alleges; rather, whatever is good is good\nrelative to a certain kind.\n\nJudith Thomson has recently elaborated on Geach\u2019s thesis\n(Thomson 1997). Although she does not unqualifiedly agree that\nwhatever is good is good relative to a certain kind, she does claim\nthat whatever is good is good in some way; nothing can be \u201cjust\nplain good,\u201d as she believes Moore would have it. Philippa Foot,\namong others, has made a similar charge (Foot 1985). It is a charge\nthat has been rebutted by Michael Zimmerman, who argues that\nGeach\u2019s tests are less straightforward than they may seem and\nfail after all to reveal a significant distinction between the ways in\nwhich \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d operate (Zimmerman\n2001, ch. 2). He argues further that Thomson mischaracterizes\nMoore\u2019s conception of intrinsic value. According to Moore, he\nclaims, what is intrinsically good is not \u201cjust plain\ngood\u201d; rather, it is good in a particular way, in keeping with\nThomson\u2019s thesis that all goodness is goodness in a way. He\nmaintains that, for Moore and other proponents of intrinsic value,\nsuch value is a particular kind of moral value. Mahrad\nAlmotahari and Adam Hosein have revived Geach\u2019s challenge\n(Almotahari and Hosein 2015). They argue that if, contrary to Geach,\n\u201cgood\u201d could be used predicatively, we would be able to\nuse the term predicatively in sentences of the form \u2018a is\na good K\u2019 but, they argue, the linguistic evidence\nindicates that we cannot do so (Almotahari and Hosein 2015,\n1493\u20134). \n",
