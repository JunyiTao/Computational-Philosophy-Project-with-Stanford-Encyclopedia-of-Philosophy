    "main_text": "Does conceivability entail possibility? || The phenomenal concept strategy\n5.2 The phenomenal concept strategy\n\nMany physicalists hold that both the zombie idea and Frank\nJackson\u2019s knowledge argument can be dealt with through a proper\nunderstanding of the nature of phenomenal concepts (roughly, the\nconcepts we use when conveying the character of our experiences: for\nexample \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018the way I see blue\u2019).\nExponents of the conceivability argument hold that the supposed\n\u2018explanatory gap\u2019 between the physical and the phenomenal\n\u2014 which is expressed in the idea that zombies are conceivable\n\u2014 brings with it an ontological gap. According to the\n\u2018phenomenal concept strategy\u2019 (Stoljar 2005) there is\nreally only a conceptual gap: phenomenal concepts have features which\nmislead us into supposing there is an ontological gap in addition to\nan epistemic one, when there isn\u2019t.\n\nThus it is argued that even if a zombie world is conceivable, it does\nnot follow that there are nonphysical properties in our world. If that\nis right, physicalists can concede the conceivability of zombies while\ninsisting that the properties we pick out in terms of phenomenal\nconcepts are physical. \u2018Given that properties are constituted by\nthe world and not by our concepts\u2019, Brian Loar comments,\n\u2018it is fair of the physicalist to request a justification of the\nassumption that conceptually distinct concepts must express\nmetaphysically distinct properties\u2019 (Loar 1999, 467; see also\nhis 1997). He also argues that phenomenal concepts are\n\u2018recognitional\u2019, in contrast to physical concepts, which\nare \u2018theoretical\u2019. Phenomenal concepts, Loar says,\n\u2018express the very properties they pick out, as Kripke observed\nin the case of \u2018pain\u2019\u2019 (1999, 468). He thinks these\npoints explain the conceivability of a zombie world, while maintaining\nthat there is no possible world in which the relevant physical\nproperties are distinct from consciousness. Chalmers objects that\nLoar\u2019s account does not justify the view that physical concepts\nrefer to phenomenal properties (1999, 488). He argues further (2007)\nthat exponents of this approach face a dilemma. Let C be whichever\npsychological \u2018key features\u2019 we have but zombies lack.\nThen if it is conceivable that the purely physical facts about us\nshould have held without C, then C is not physicalistically\nexplicable. On the other hand, if that is not conceivable, then in his\nview C cannot explain our epistemic situation as contrasted with that\nof zombies. So either C is not physicalistically explicable, or it\ncannot explain our epistemic situation.
