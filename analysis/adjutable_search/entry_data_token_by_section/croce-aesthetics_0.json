    "main_text": "The Four Domains of Spirit (or Mind)\n1. The Four Domains of Spirit (or Mind)\n\nWe are confining ourselves to Croce\u2019s aesthetics, but it will\nhelp to have at least the most rudimentary sketch in view of his\nrather complex general philosophy.\n\nIn Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the prevailing\nphilosophy or \u2018world-view\u2019 was not, as in England,\npost-Hegelian Idealism as already mentioned, but the early forms of\nempiricist positivism associated with such figures as Comte and Mach.\nPartly out of distaste for the mechanism and enshrinement of matter of\nsuch views, and partly out of his reaction, both positive and\nnegative, to the philosophy of Hegel, Croce espoused what he called\n\u2018Absolute Idealism\u2019 or \u2018Absolute Historicism\u2019.\nA constant theme in Croce\u2019s philosophy is that he sought a path\nbetween the Scylla of \u2018transcendentalism\u2019 and the\nCharybdis of \u2018sensationalism\u2019, which for most purposes may\nbe thought of as co-extensive with rationalism and empiricism. For\nCroce, they are bottom the same error, the error of abstracting from\nordinary experience to something not literally experienceable.\nTranscendentalism regards the world of sense to be unreal, confused or\nsecond-rate, and it is the philosopher, reflecting on the world in\na priori way from his armchair, who sees beyond it, to\nreality. What Croce called \u2018Sensationalism\u2019, on the other\nhand, regards only instantaneous impressions of colour and the like as\nexisting, the rest being in some sense a mere logical construction out\nof it, of no independent reality. The right path is what Croce calls\nimmanentism: All but only lived human experience, taking\nplace concretely and without reduction, is real. Therefore all\nPhilosophy, properly so-called, is Philosophy of Spirit (or Mind), and\nis inseparable from history. And thus Croce\u2019s favoured\ndesignations, \u2018Absolute Idealism\u2019 or \u2018Absolute\nHistoricism\u2019.\n\nPhilosophy admits of the following divisions, corresponding to the\ndifferent modes of mental or spiritual activity. Mental activity is\neither theoretic (it understands or contemplates) or it is practical\n(it wills actions). These in turn divide: The theoretic divides into\nthe aesthetic, which deals in particulars (individuals or intuitions),\nand logic or the intellectual domain, which deals in concepts and\nrelations, or universals. The practical divides into the\neconomic\u2014by which Croce means all manner of utilitarian\ncalculation\u2014and the ethical or moral. Each of the four domains\nare subject to a characteristic norm or value: aesthetic is subject to\nbeauty, logic is subject to truth, economic is subject to the useful\n(or vitality), and the moral is subject to the good. Croce devoted\nthree lengthy books written between 1901 and 1909 to this overall\nscheme of the \u2018Philosophy of Spirit\u2019: Aesthetic\n(1901) and (1907) (revised), Logic (1909) and the\nPhilosophy of the Practical (1908), the latter containing\nboth the economic and ethics (in today\u2019s use of term you might\ncall the overall scheme Croce\u2019s metaphysics, but Croce\nhimself distanced himself from that appellation; there is also some\nsense in calling it philosophy of mind).\n",
