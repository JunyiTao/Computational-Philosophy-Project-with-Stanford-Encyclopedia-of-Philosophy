    "main_text": "The Distinction between God and Creatures\n6. The Distinction between God and Creatures\n\n\nHow then does Dietrich distinguish God from creature? We have already\nseen that according to his basic metaphysics Dietrich insists on the\nequation of existence and essence for all beings. The Thomistic\ndistinction of essence and existence will not be permitted. Nor does\nDietrich wish to distinguish God from creatures by postulating a\ntheory of universal hylomorphism, which is the view that all\ncreatures, even spiritual ones, are marked as creatures by the\npossession of some form of materiality. Spiritual creatures, Dietrich\nargues in a question devoted to this topic, possess no form of\nmateriality. How then do we distinguish uncreated being from created\nbeing and the various forms of created being? The answer involves a\nreference to their essential relations to each other in the universe\nof beings, that is by the essential place they occupy in the chain of\nbeings in which every being is essentially ordered to some other being\nas either its cause or its effect. God is at the top of this\nchain. \u201cGod,\u201d Dietrich tells us in the first part of\nDe intellectu et intelligibili, \u201cmeans that\nthan which nothing is superior, which stands in need of nothing with\nrespect to either being or operation.\u201d All other beings are\nordered under God and to each other in an essential ordering. This is\nwhat Dietrich means by place. He does not mean some accidental\nrelation like being to the left or to the right of something\u2014a\nrelation that can change without changing the nature of the being\nenjoying the relation. Hierarchical location for Dietrich is\nessential.  It might be referred to as the dignity of beings, denoting\nthe unique set of relations a being occupies. We can see this concept\nof place or dignity in the definition of God mentioned above: God\nmeans that than which nothing is superior. This description uniquely\ndefines his place in the hierarchy of being. Following an ancient\ntradition Dietrich also tells us that God is called unity and is the\nfirst cause because he is beyond all human language to describe. In\nother words Dietrich identifies God with the ineffable One that he\nfound mentioned in the Liber de causis. But even this\nineffability defines God\u2019s place with respect to the universe of\nbeings.\n\n\nOf course the simplest answer to the question of how God is\ndistinguished from the rest of the universe of beings is in terms of\nGod\u2019s being its creator. Dietrich is careful to preserve the\nphilosophical intention of his exposition when he refers to the\ncreative nature of God within the context of Proclean\nNeoplatonism. God as the One, he says, exhibits an interior\noverflowing (interior transfusio). \u201cBy means of this\nsuper-blessed nature (superbenedicta natura) he overflows\nthrough his own fecundity beyond himself into the whole of being,\nestablishing it out of nothing through creation and governance.\u201d\nThe whole of being then is created out of nothing by God. Dietrich is\ncareful not to say the universe of being because he then would leave\nhimself open to the theological error of implying that God\u2019s being is\ncreated, albeit self-created.  Furthermore, by introducing creation\ninto his hierarchy with respect to the One he avoids the charge of\npantheism that so often plagued earlier Christian Neoplatonists such\nas Scotus Eriugena. Dietrich was perfectly capable of identifying God\nand his creatures as he does in his treatise on measurement, the\nDe mensuris, where he writes, \u201c\u2026all things\ninsofar as they are in him are God himself and he for his part is in a\ncertain way all things\u2026\u201d But he is quick to point out to\nthe reader that the way God is all things is in the mode of an\nessential cause (per modum causae essentialis), meaning that\nwhatever is in the effect, even the being of the effect, is in the\ncause in a more eminent mode. Dietrich explains this principle in the\nsecond part of De intellectu when he tells us that\n\u201c\u2026 an agent as an agent can contain in itself its own act\nor what is caused by it not only virtually, but also essentially,\ninsofar as it is the same as its effect, but with a distinct existence\n(aliud esse).\u201d Thus God and creatures do not enjoy the\nsame being. God\u2019s being is not created, but creative. And this\nproperty is unique to God.  No creatures can create because as a\ncreature it has a non-creative being which is different from God\u2019s\nbeing, an aliud esse.\n\n\nSome creatures have the capacity to produce things, but this is not\nthe same as the power of creation. Here Dietrich is following a\ndistinction he finds in the Liber de causis, where creation\nis understood as the bestowal of being while production is taken to be\na formative causality proper to creatures. The ability to produce or\nreproduce things is vital to Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics of the intellect.\nFor in the order of things intellect comes immediately after God and\nis a mirror of divine omnipotence insofar as it is the universe of\nbeings in the order of knowing; as God can create the totality of\nbeings, the intellect can reflect or reproduce this totality,\nincluding God himself, as ideas.\n",
