    "main_text": "The Intentions of the Artist\n9. The Intentions of the Artist\n\nDespite his many books and articles, Beardsley is probably best known\nfor his very first article in aesthetics. In \u201cThe Intentional\nFallacy\u201d, a paper co-written with William K. Wimsatt and\npublished in 1946, he argued against the neo-Romantic view that a work\nof art means what the artist says it means, or what he intends it to\nmean. Since many pens have run dry in writing about\u2014and in the\ngreat majority of cases attacking\u2014The Intentional Fallacy,\nanother pen will run dry in discussing it below.\n\nThe issue can be put in terms of the relation between\n\n(1)\nThe artist intended x to mean p in work\nw\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w.\n\n\nAccording to E.D. Hirsch,\n (1)\n entails\n (2),\n at least if w is a literary work, because the meaning of\n\u2018x\u2019 simply is what the writer meant or intended\nby \u2018x\u2019. Knowing the artist\u2019s intention is\nthus knowing the work\u2019s meaning (Hirsch 1967). That\u2019s one\nend of the spectrum on the relation between\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n\nBeardsley sits at the other end. He holds that the intentions of the\nartist aren\u2019t relevant to the interpretation of a work of art at\nall.\n (1)\n not only doesn\u2019t entail\n (2);\n in and of itself, it provides no direct evidential support for\n (2).\n An artist\u2019s intentions have nothing to do with what a work\nmeans.\n\nBetween Beardsley and Hirsch are any number of intermediate positions,\nin general characterizable as holding that the intentions of the\nartist provide some direct evidential support for\n (2)\u00a0but\n not definitive support. Artists\u2019 intentions have some weight,\nin other words, but not, as Hirsch in effect has it, infinite weight,\nweight that entails that the work means what the artist intends it to\nmean. Other factors may well outweigh that of the artist\u2019s\nintention in a particular case, and the meaning of the work, or part\nof the work, not correspond to what the artist intends. Many\nphilosophers, probably the majority, would subscribe to such an\nintermediate position. The question, however, isn\u2019t which\nposition is most popular, but which has the most to say for it.\n\nOne steadfast conviction of Beardsley\u2019s is that his does. He\nreturned to the issue of the relation of intention and interpretation\na number of times, and never wavered. In fact, he was more than\nconsistent on the issue; he also held that\n\n(3)\nThe artist intended w to have descriptive property\np\n\n\nprovides no direct evidential support for\n\n(4)\nW has descriptive property p,\n\n\nand that\n\n(5)\nThe artist intended w to have evaluative property\ne\n\n\nprovides no direct evidential support for\n\n(6)\nW has evaluative property e.\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s intentions are utterly irrelevant to the\ndescriptive, interpretive, and evaluative properties of his work. If\nwe want to know what properties a work has, we should examine the\nwork, not the worker.\n\nAnd in addition to \u201cThe Intentional Fallacy\u201d,\nthere\u2019s also the lesser known and lesser discussed \u201cThe\nAffective Fallacy\u201d. In a paper bearing that name (1949), also\nco-written with William Wimsatt, Beardsley argued that a\nperson\u2019s affective responses to a work of art are irrelevant to\nits descriptive, interpretive, and evaluative properties. If we want\nto know what properties a work has, we should look at the work, not\nthose looking at the work.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s claims about the irrelevance of the artist\u2019s\nintentions to the descriptive and evaluative properties of his work\nhave elicited little in the way of critical response. That may or may\nnot mean that philosophers are generally in agreement with him. As far\nas the irrelevance of the artist\u2019s intentions to interpretation\nis concerned, however, there has been a great deal of dissent. Since\nthere has, what follows will concentrate exclusively upon\ninterpretation.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s arguments against intentionalism are of a variety of\nsorts. In \u201cThe Intentional Fallacy\u201d, he says that the\nintentions of the artist are neither \u201cavailable nor\ndesirable\u201d, with this meaning that such intentions aren\u2019t\nalways available and are never desirable. Since we frequently can and\ndo correctly interpret a work of art with little or no knowledge about\nthe artist, the fact that the artist\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t\nalways available is enough to show that Hirsch\u2019s position is\nwrong. But that it\u2019s never desirable to consult the\nartist\u2019s intentions when they\u2019re available is what\nBeardsley has to prove.\n\nPartial support can be found in his argument that\n\n\nJudging a poem is like judging a pudding or a machine. One demands\nthat it work. It is only because an artifact works that we infer the\nintention of the artificer\u2026. A poem can be only\nthrough its meaning\u2026 yet it is, simply\nis, in the sense that we have no excuse for inquiring what\npart is intended or meant. (IF: 469)\n\n\nIn other words, a poem or other work of art is independent of its\ncreator, just as any other artifact\u2014a pudding or a washing\nmachine\u2014is. A pudding consists of milk, eggs, and other\ningredients; a washing machine of a metal drum, rubber gaskets, and\nother parts; and a poem of words. In all three cases, the parts exist\nand are what they are independently of the artificers, and the\nartifacts are to be judged\u2014and interpreted\u2014on the basis of\ntheir properties. There\u2019s no need to bring in the artificer, for\nhe doesn\u2019t remain behind in the parts, and critical judgment,\nincluding interpretation, concerns the how, why, what, and how well of\nthe artifact, not the how, why, what, or how well of the artificer.\nThe proof of the pudding is in the eating, not the chef\u2019s\nintentions.\n\nThe principal point at which this argument\u2014admittedly, an\nextended reconstruction of a few remarks in \u201cThe Intentional\nFallacy\u201d\u2014might be questioned is in the assumption that\nworks of art are like standard, garden-variety artifacts\u2014lawn\nchairs and television sets\u2014in leaving their creators behind. For\nBeardsley, a work of art isn\u2019t fundamentally different from a\npair of fingernail clippers: it\u2019s made and then begins its own\nautonomous life. It is what it is\u2014who knows or cares who created\nit, and with what intentions. This is a plausible position, but not an\nunassailable\u00a0one. The alternative view is that not all artifacts\nlead autonomous lives, and that for some, works of art as well as, on\nmany people\u2019s view, linguistic artifacts of all kinds (sentence\ntokens, memos, book chapters, and so on), what they are is intimately\nlinked to their creator, and more particularly to the intention-laden\nconditions of their origin. Put more concretely and slightly too\nstrongly in terms of an imperfect analogy with physical objects: a\nrock isn\u2019t space, and to understand a rock we can many times can\nignore considerations of space, but if we remove space altogether from\nour understanding of a rock, there isn\u2019t a rock to understand at\nall. On this view, then, a proper understanding of works of\nart\u2014which includes correctly interpreting them\u2014requires\nthe admissibility of considerations of the artist\u2019s intentions,\neven if those intentions aren\u2019t always available or needed.\n\nBut why, Beardsley would ask in reply, are works of art so special?\nWhat makes them categorically different from your run-of-the-mill\nartifact? The view in question distinguishes kinds of artifact without\nproviding a principled or well-argued basis for doing so. At the\nleast, additional support is needed. Absent such support, the view is\nnothing but special pleading.\n\nOne possible reply is that there is a non-arbitrary difference between\nworks of art and other artifacts, namely\u00a0that other artifacts\naren\u2019t essentially meaning-laden and works of art are. Still, in\nand of itself, this isn\u2019t sufficient, Beardsley would say, for\n(i) some works of art, such as \u201cpure music\u201d, aren\u2019t\nmeaning-laden, (ii) many objects which aren\u2019t works of art, such\nas newspapers, are meaning-laden, and (iii) even if (i) and (ii)\nweren\u2019t true, the fact that all and only works of art are\nmeaning-laden has to be shown to make for the relevance of\nartists\u2019 intentions, and that hasn\u2019t been done.\n\nIn Aesthetics, the attack is a little different. \u201cWe\nmust distinguish between the aesthetic object and the intention in the\nmind of its creator\u201d, Beardsley says, and the irrelevance of the\nlatter to interpretation can be shown if we consider a certain\nsculpture, \u201ca large, twisted, cruller-shaped object of polished\nteak, mounted at an oblique angle to the floor\u201d. The creator of\nthe sculpture intends it to \u201csymbolize\u2026 Human\nDestiny\u201d. Try as we might, however, we \u201csee in it no such\nsymbolic meaning\u201d. The philosophical question then is:\n\n\nShould we say that we have simply missed the symbolism, but that it\nmust be there, since what a statue symbolizes is precisely what its\nmaker makes it symbolize? Or should we say, in the spirit of Alice\nconfronting the extreme semantic conventionalism [intentionalism] of\nHumpty Dumpty, that the question is whether that object can be made to\nmean Human Destiny?\n\n\nObviously, the latter, Beardsley thinks, for the former entails\nthat\n\n\nanyone can make anything symbolize anything just by saying it does,\nfor another sculpture could copy the same object and label it\n\u201cSpirit of Palm Beach, 1938\u201d. (Aesth:\n18\u201319, 21)\n\n\nThe argument here is fine as far as it goes, but it doesn\u2019t go\nas far as Beardsley apparently thinks it does. What it shows is that\nan artist\u2019s say-so or intention isn\u2019t absolute as far as\nthe meaning of his work is concerned. That\u2019s a far cry from\nshowing that\n (1)\n is utterly irrelevant to\n (2).\n\nIn addition to sculpture, the irrelevance of the author to the meaning\nof his text is also argued for by Beardsley, though only partly by\ncounterexample. \u201cSuppose someone utters a sentence\u201d, he\nsays.\n\n\nWe can [then] ask two questions: (1) What does the speaker\nmean? (2) What does the sentence mean?\n\n\nAlthough answers to the two questions usually coincide, they can\ndiverge; people can mean one thing and say another. The reason\nthat\u2019s possible is that\n\n\nwhat a sentence means depends not on the whim of the individual, and\nhis mental vagaries, but upon public conventions of usage that are\ntied up with habit patterns in the whole speaking community.\n\n\nSentence meaning\u2014that is, textual meaning\u2014is thus one\nthing, and is anchored in the \u201cthe whole speaking\ncommunity\u201d, while speaker meaning\u2014what the author\nmeant\u2014is quite another, and is anchored in his own, quite\npossibly idiosyncratic intentions. Thus an author can be wrong about\nwhat his own work means. A.E. Housman, for example, was probably wrong\nin claiming that his poem \u201c1887\u201d wasn\u2019t ironic\n(Aesth:, 25\u201326).\n\nOnce again, there\u2019s something wrong and something right in what\nBeardsley says. He\u2019s undoubtedly right that sentence meaning and\nspeaker meaning needn\u2019t coincide, and that that proves that the\ntwo aren\u2019t identical. Thus the author\u2019s intention\nisn\u2019t always the final word on what a text means. That, however,\ndoesn\u2019t prove that the author\u2019s intention carries no\nevidential weight at all. According to the alternative position, it\ndoes, but in some cases, perhaps the majority of them, not enough to\ncarry the day. In other cases, however, and perhaps Housman\u2019s\namong them, the author\u2019s intention can tip the scales in favor\nof one reading rather than another. In any case, the argument here\nmight conclude, the unease that many people feel in dismissing Housman\nfrom the interpretation of his poem argues that we should accord his\nintentions at least some weight.\n\nIn The Possibility of Criticism, three arguments are advanced\nagainst intentionalism, which is again taken to be the view that the\nmeaning of a work of art is what the artist intends it to mean. The\nfirst is that\n\n\nsome texts that have been formed without the agency of an author, and\nhence without authorial meaning, nevertheless have a meaning and can\nbe interpreted. (PC: 18)\n\n\nWhat Beardsley has in mind is the kind of verbal mistake made at a\npublishing house, or by a computer in scanning a document. He cites\nthe sentence \u201cJensen argued like a man filled with righteous\nindigestion\u201d as an example of a text that can be read and\ninterpreted, yet no agency, a fortiori no author\u2019s\nintention, stands behind it. \u201cIndignation\u201d became\n\u201cindigestion\u201d at the printer\u2019s, by mechanical\nerror.\n\nTrue enough, his opponent would say in reply, but what that shows is\nthat the author\u2019s intention isn\u2019t identical with the\nmeaning of a text or needed in all cases to correctly interpret a\ntext. What it doesn\u2019t show is that the author\u2019s intention,\nif present, is irrelevant to interpretation. Besides, the reply would\ncontinue, printer\u2019s errors and similar cases are parasitic on\nnormal cases in which there is authorial intent. Our conception of a\ntext is that of an intentionally created artifact of a certain kind,\nand cases in which authorial intent is altogether missing are admitted\nas texts only by conceptual courtesy, based on the similarity of such\ntexts to standard, intention-laden texts.\n\nThe second argument is that\n\n\nthe meaning of a text can change after its author has died. But the\nauthor cannot change his meaning after he has died. Therefore, textual\nmeaning is not identical to the authorial meaning.\n\n\nBolstering this argument is the fact that\n\n\nthe OED furnishes abundant evidence that individual words and idioms\nacquire new meanings and lose old meanings as time passes; these\nchanges can in turn produce changes of the meaning in sentences in\nwhich the words appear.\n\n\nAs an example, Beardsley cites a line from a poem written in 1744,\n\u201cHe raised his plastic arm\u201d, and notes that \u201cplastic\narm\u201d has \u201cacquired a new meaning in the twentieth\ncentury\u201d. Thus the line \u201cin which it occurs has also\nacquired a new meaning\u201d (PC: 19).\n\nThis argument is highly doubtful. Just as the doings of the homosexual\ncommunity in the 1970s, and the terminology that such doings\nintroduced, don\u2019t mean that the line \u201cNow we don our gay\napparel\u201d has acquired a new meaning in the Christmas carol, a\ncall to dressing in drag, so the doings of\u00a0the oil industry in\nthe twentieth century, and the terminology surrounding petrochemical\nproducts that such doings introduced, don\u2019t mean that the line\n\u201cHe raised his plastic arm\u201d has acquired a new meaning in\nthe poem, a meaning having to do with the movement of a prosthetic\nlimb. Newer meanings of a term, distant from original meanings and far\nremoved in time, are utterly irrelevant to the meaning of a line\nwritten long ago. In effect, the principle of interpretation\nunderlying Beardsley\u2019s argument, that new meanings of a term are\nrelevant to the interpretation of older texts in which it occurs,\n\nunderwrites unbridled anachronism,\nentails ever changing but correct interpretation\u2014that is, no\nstable textual meaning\u2014and\nseriously threatens the autonomy of the text and, by extension,\nthe autonomy of all works of art.\n\n\nAlthough Beardsley might regard (a) as an acceptable consequence of\nhis argument, at least if \u201cunbridled anachronism\u201d were\nreplaced with a less loaded term, he\u2019d undoubtedly be unhappy\nwith (b) and (c). (b) challenges the objectivity of criticism,\nsomething that he\u2019s at pains to establish, and (c) endangers his\ncomprehensive outlook on art and art criticism. Perhaps that\u2019s\nwhy he later seems to have renounced the argument, even if only\nimplicitly (cf. Aesth: li).\n\nThe third argument is the familiar one that\n\n\na text can have meanings that its author is not aware of. Therefore,\nit can have meanings that its author did not intend. Therefore,\ntextual meaning is not identical to authorial meaning. (PC: 20)\n\n\nWhile all this can be granted, Beardsley\u2019s critic would say, the\nlast sentence gives the game away: the argument doesn\u2019t show the\ncomplete irrelevance of the author\u2019s intentions to the meaning\nof his work, just that the two aren\u2019t identical.\n",
