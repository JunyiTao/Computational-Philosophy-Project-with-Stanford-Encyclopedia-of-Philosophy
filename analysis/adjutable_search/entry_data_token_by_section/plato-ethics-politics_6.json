    "main_text": "Ethics, Part One: What Justice Is || Imperfectly Virtuous Motivations\n2.4 Imperfectly Virtuous Motivations\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 long discussion in Books Two and Three of how to educate \nthe guardians for the ideal city offers a different approach (E. Brown 2004, Singpurwalla 2006; cf. Gill 1985, Kamtekar 1998, and Scott 1999). This \neducation is most often noted for its carefully censored \u201creading \nlist;\u201d the young guardians-to-be will not be exposed to inappropriate\nimages of gods and human beings. Less often noted is how optimistic \nSocrates is about the results of a sufficiently careful education. \nA well-trained guardian will \u201cpraise fine things, be pleased by them, \nreceive them into his soul, and, being nurtured by them, become fine \nand good,\u201d and each will \u201crightly object to what is shameful, hating \nit while he\u2019s still young and unable to grasp the reason\u201d \n(401e4\u2013402a2; cf. 441e). Note that Socrates has the young guardians \nnot only responding to good things as honorable (with spirited \nattitudes), but also becoming fine and good. Moreover, \nSocrates is confident that the spirited guardians are stably good: \nwhen he is describing the possibility of civic courage in Book Four, \nhe suggests that proper education can stain the spirited part of the \nsoul with the right dispositions so deeply that they will be \npreserved \u201cthrough everything\u201d (429b8, 429c8, 430b2\u20133).\n\n\nThis optimism suggests that the motivations to do what is right are \nacquired early in moral education, built into a soul that might \nbecome, eventually, perfectly just. And this in turn suggests one \nreason why Socrates might have skipped the question of why the \npsychologically just can be relied upon to do what is right. Socrates\nmight assume that anyone who is psychologically just must have \nbeen raised well, and that anyone who has been raised well will do \nwhat is right. So understood, early childhood education, and not \nknowledge of the forms, links psychological\njustice and just action.\n\n\nOf course, there are questions about how far Socrates could extend\nthis optimism about imperfect virtue among non-philosophers. Perhaps\nhonor-loving members of the auxiliary class have psychological harmony\nsecured by their consistent attachment to what they have learned is\nhonorable, but what about the members of the producing class? Can\ntheir attachment to the satisfaction of bodily desires be educated in\nsuch a way that they enjoy, in optimal social circumstances, a\nwell-ordered soul? Do they even receive a primary education in the\nideal city? These questions will be considered more fully below (and see Wilberding 2012 and Wilburn 2014).\n\n\nOpen questions aside, it should be clear that there are two general \nways of linking psychological justice to just action: one that \ndepends upon the motivational power of knowledge in particular and \nthe other that depends upon the early training of a wide range of \nattitudes in the young. If one of these ways works, then Socrates is \nentitled to argue that it is always better to be just than unjust by \nshowing why it is always better to have a harmonious soul.\n",
