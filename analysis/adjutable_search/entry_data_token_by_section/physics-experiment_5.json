    "main_text": "The Roles of Experiment || A Life of Its Own\n3.1 A Life of Its Own\n\nAlthough experiment often takes its importance from its relation to\ntheory, Hacking pointed out that it often has a life of its own,\nindependent of theory. He notes the pristine observations of Carolyn\nHerschel\u2019s discovery of comets, William Herschel\u2019s work on\n\u201cradiant heat,\u201d and Davy\u2019s observation of the gas\nemitted by algae and the flaring of a taper in that gas. In none of\nthese cases did the experimenter have any theory of the phenomenon\nunder investigation. One may also note the nineteenth century\nmeasurements of atomic spectra and the work on the masses and\nproperties on elementary particles during the 1960s. Both of these\nsequences were conducted without any guidance from theory.\n\nIn deciding what experimental investigation to pursue, scientists may\nvery well be influenced by the equipment available and their own\nability to use that equipment (McKinney 1992). Thus, when the\nMann-O\u2019Neill collaboration was doing high energy physics\nexperiments at the Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator during the late\n1960s, the sequence of experiments was (1) measurement of the\n\\(\\ce{K+}\\) decay rates, (2) measurement of the \\(\\ce{K+_{e 3}}\\)\nbranching ratio and decay spectrum, (3) measurement of the \\(\\ce{K+_{e\n2}}\\) branching ratio, and (4) measurement of the form factor in\n\\(\\ce{K+_{e 3}}\\) decay. These experiments were performed with\nbasically the same experimental apparatus, but with relatively minor\nmodifications for each particular experiment. By the end of the\nsequence the experimenters had become quite expert in the use of the\napparatus and knowledgeable about the backgrounds and experimental\nproblems. This allowed the group to successfully perform the\ntechnically more difficult experiments later in the sequence. We might\nrefer to this as \u201cinstrumental loyalty\u201d and the\n\u201crecycling of expertise\u201d (Franklin 1997b). This meshes\nnicely with Galison\u2019s view of experimental traditions.\nScientists, both theorists and experimentalists, tend to pursue\nexperiments and problems in which their training and expertise can be\nused.\n\nHacking also remarks on the \u201cnoteworthy observations\u201d on\nIceland Spar by Bartholin, on diffraction by Hooke and Grimaldi, and\non the dispersion of light by Newton. \u201cNow of course Bartholin,\nGrimaldi, Hooke, and Newton were not mindless empiricists without an\n\u2018idea\u2019 in their heads. They saw what they saw because they\nwere curious, inquisitive, reflective people. They were attempting to\nform theories. But in all these cases it is clear that the\nobservations preceded any formulation of theory\u201d (Hacking 1983,\np. 156). In all of these cases we may say that these were observations\nwaiting for, or perhaps even calling for, a theory. The discovery of\nany unexpected phenomenon calls for a theoretical explanation.\n",
