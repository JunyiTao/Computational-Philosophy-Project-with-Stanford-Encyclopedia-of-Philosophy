    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cOld\u201d Metaphysics || Categories of Being and Universals\n2.2 Categories of Being and Universals\n\nWe human beings sort things into various classes. And we often suppose\nthat the classes into which we sort things enjoy a kind of internal\nunity. In this respect they differ from sets in the strict sense of\nthe word. (And no doubt in others. It would seem, for example, that we\nthink of the classes we sort things into\u2014biological species,\nsay\u2014as comprising different members at different times.) The\nclasses into which we sort things are in most cases\n\u201cnatural\u201d classes, classes whose membership is in some\nimportant sense uniform\u2014\u201ckinds\u201d. We shall not\nattempt an account or definition of \u2018natural class\u2019 here.\nExamples must suffice. There are certainly sets whose members do not\nmake up natural classes: a set that contains all dogs but one, and a\nset that contains all dogs and exactly one cat do not correspond to\nnatural classes in anyone\u2019s view. And it is tempting to suppose\nthat there is a sense of \u201cnatural\u201d in which dogs make up a\nnatural class, to suppose that in dividing the world into dogs and\nnon-dogs, we \u201ccut nature at the joints\u201d. It is, however, a\nrespectable philosophical thesis that the idea of a natural class\ncannot survive philosophical scrutiny. If that respectable thesis is\ntrue, the topic \u201cthe categories of being\u201d is a\npseudo-topic. Let us simply assume that the respectable thesis is\nfalse and that things fall into various natural\nclasses\u2014hereinafter, simply classes.\n\nSome of the classes into which we sort things are more comprehensive\nthan others: all dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs; all\nanimals are living organisms, but not all living organisms are animals\n\u2026. Now the very expression \u201csort things into\nclasses\u201d suggests that there is a most comprehensive class: the\nclass of things, the class of things that can be sorted into classes.\nBut is this so?\u2014and if it is so, are there classes that are\n\u201cjust less comprehensive\u201d than this universal class? If\nthere are, can we identify them?\u2014and are there a vast (perhaps\neven an infinite) number of them, or some largish, messy number like\nforty-nine, or some small, neat number like seven or four? Let us call\nany such less comprehensive classes the \u2018categories of\nbeing\u2019 or the \u2018ontological categories\u2019. (The former\nterm, if not the latter, presupposes a particular position on one\nquestion about the nature of being: that everything is, that the\nuniversal class is the class of beings, the class of things that are.\nIt thus presupposes that Meinong was wrong to say that \u201cthere\nare things of which it is true that there are no such\nthings\u201d.)\n\nThe topic \u201cthe categories of being\u201d is intermediate\nbetween the topic \u201cthe nature of being\u201d and the topics\nthat fall under the post-Medieval conception of metaphysics for a\nreason that can be illustrated by considering the problem of\nuniversals. Universals, if they indeed exist, are, in the first\ninstance, properties or qualities or attributes (i.e.,\n\u201cductility\u201d or \u201cwhiteness\u201d) that are\nsupposedly universally \u201cpresent in\u201d the members of classes\nof things and relations (i.e., \u201cbeing to the north of\u201d)\nthat are supposedly universally present in the members of classes of\nsequences of things. \u201cIn the first instance\u201d: it may be\nthat things other than qualities and relations are universals,\nalthough qualities and relations are the items most commonly put\nforward as examples of universals. It may be that the novel War\nand Peace is a universal, a thing that is in some mode present in\neach of the many tangible copies of the novel. It may be that the word\n\u201chorse\u201d is a universal, a thing that is present in each of\nthe many audible utterances of the word. And it may be that natural\nclasses or kinds are themselves universals\u2014it may be that there\nis such a thing as \u201cthe horse\u201d or the species Equus\ncaballus, distinct from its defining attribute \u201cbeing a\nhorse\u201d or \u201cequinity\u201d, and in some sense\n\u201cpresent in\u201d each horse. (Perhaps some difference between\nthe attribute \u201cbeing a horse\u201d and the attribute\n\u201cbeing either a horse or a kitten\u201d explains why the former\nis the defining attribute of a kind and the latter is not. Perhaps the\nformer attribute exists and the latter does not; perhaps the former\nhas the second-order attribute \u201cnaturalness\u201d and the\nlatter does not; perhaps the former is more easily apprehended by the\nintellect than the latter.)\n\nThe thesis that universals exist\u2014or at any rate\n\u201csubsist\u201d or \u201chave being\u201d\u2014is variously\ncalled \u2018realism\u2019 or \u2018Platonic realism\u2019 or\n\u2018platonism\u2019. All three terms are objectionable. Aristotle\nbelieved in the reality of universals, but it would be at best an\noxymoron to call him a platonist or a Platonic realist. And\n\u2018realism\u2019 tout court has served as a name for a variety of\nphilosophical theses. The thesis that universals do not exist\u2014do\nnot so much as subsist; have no being of any sort\u2014is generally\ncalled \u2018nominalism\u2019. This term, too is objectionable. At\none time, those who denied the existence of universals were fond of\nsaying things like:\n\n\nThere is no such thing as \u201cbeing a horse\u201d: there is only\nthe name [nomen, gen. nominis] \u201chorse\u201d,\na mere flatus vocis [puff of sound].\n\n\nPresent-day nominalists, however, are aware, if earlier nominalists\nwere not, that if the phrase \u2018the name\n\u201chorse\u201d\u2009\u2019 designated an object, the object it\ndesignated would itself be a universal or something very like one. It\nwould not be a mere puff of sound but would rather be what was common\nto the many puffs of sound that were its tokens.\n\nThe old debate between the nominalists and the realists continues to\nthe present day. Most realists suppose that universals constitute one\nof the categories of being. This supposition could certainly be\ndisputed without absurdity. Perhaps there is a natural class of things\nto which all universals belong but which contains other things as well\n(and is not the class of all things). Perhaps, for example, numbers\nand propositions are not universals, and perhaps numbers and\npropositions and universals are all members of a class of\n\u201cabstract objects\u201d, a class that some things do not belong\nto. Or perhaps there is such a thing as \u201cthe whiteness of the\nTaj Mahal\u201d and perhaps this object and the universal\n\u201cwhiteness\u201d\u2014but not the Taj Mahal itself\u2014both\nbelong to the class of \u201cproperties\u201d. Let us call such a\nclass\u2014a proper subclass of an ontological category, a natural\nclass that is neither the class of all things nor one of the\nontological categories\u2014an \u2018ontological\nsub-category\u2019. It may indeed be that universals make up a\nsub-category of being and are members of the category of being\n\u201cabstract object\u201d. But few if any philosophers would\nsuppose that universals were members of forty-nine\nsub-categories\u2014much less of a vast number or an infinity of\nsub-categories. Most philosophers who believe in the reality of\nuniversals would want to say that universals, if they do not\nconstitute an ontological category, at least constitute one of the\n\u201chigher\u201d sub-categories. If dogs form a natural class,\nthis class is\u2014by the terms of our definition\u2014an\nontological sub-category. And this class will no doubt be a subclass\nof many sub-categories: the genus canis, the class (in the\nbiological sense) mammalia, \u2026, and so through a chain\nof sub-categories that eventually reaches some very general\nsub-category like \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cmaterial\nobject\u201d. Thus, although dogs may compose an ontological\nsub-category, this sub-category\u2014unlike the category\n\u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014is one of the \u201clower\u201d ones.\nThese reflections suggest that the topic \u201cthe categories of\nbeing\u201d should be understood to comprehend both the categories of\nbeing sensu stricto and their immediate sub-categories.\n\nDoes the topic \u201cthe categories of being\u201d belong to\nmetaphysics in the \u201cold\u201d sense? A case can be made for\nsaying that it does, based on the fact that Plato\u2019s theory of\nforms (universals, attributes) is a recurrent theme in\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. In Metaphysics, two\nof Plato\u2019s central theses about the forms come in for vigorous\ncriticism: (i) that things that would, if they existed, be\n\u201cinactive\u201d (the forms) could be the primary beings, the\n\u201cmost real\u201d things, and (ii) that the attributes of things\nexist \u201cseparately\u201d from the things whose attributes they\nare. We shall be concerned only with (ii). In the terminology of the\nSchools, that criticism can be put this way: Plato wrongly believed\nthat universals existed ante res (prior to objects); the\ncorrect view is that universals exist in rebus (in objects).\nIt is because this aspect of the problem of universals\u2014whether\nuniversals exist ante res or in rebus\u2014is\ndiscussed at length in Metaphysics, that a strong case can be\nmade for saying that the problem of universals falls under the old\nconception of metaphysics. (And the question whether universals, given\nthat they exist at all, exist ante res or in rebus\nis as controversial in the twenty-first century as it was in the\nthirteenth century and the fourth century B.C.E.) If we do decide that\nthe problem of universals belongs to metaphysics on the old\nconception, then, since we have liberalized the old conception by\napplying to it the contemporary rule that the denial of a metaphysical\nposition is to be regarded as a metaphysical position, we shall have\nto say that the question whether universals exist at all is a\nmetaphysical question under the old conception\u2014and that\nnominalism is therefore a metaphysical thesis.\n\nThere is, however, also a case to made against classifying the problem\nof universals as a problem of metaphysics in the (liberalized) old\nsense. For there is more to the problem of universals than the\nquestion whether universals exist and the question whether, if they do\nexist, their existence is ante res or in rebus. For\nexample, the problem of universals also includes questions about the\nrelation between universals (if such there be) and the things that are\nnot universals, the things usually called particulars. Aristotle did\nnot consider these questions in the Metaphysics. One might\ntherefore plausibly contend that only one part of the problem of\nuniversals (the part that pertains to the existence and nature of\nuniversals) belongs to metaphysics in the old sense. At one time, a\nphilosopher might have said,\n\n\nThe universal \u201cdoghood\u201d is a thing that does not change.\nTherefore, questions about its nature belong to metaphysics, the\nscience of things that do not change. But dogs are things that change.\nTherefore, questions concerning the relation of dogs to doghood do not\nbelong to metaphysics.\n\n\nBut no contemporary philosopher would divide the topics that\nway\u2014not even if he or she believed that doghood existed and was\na thing that did not change. A contemporary philosopher\u2014if that\nphilosopher concedes that there is any problem that can properly be\ncalled \u201cthe problem of universals\u201d\u2014will see the\nproblem of universals as a problem properly so called, as a problem\nhaving the kind of internal unity that leads philosophers to speak of\na philosophical problem. And the same point applies to the\ntopic \u201cthe categories of being\u201d: every philosopher who is\nwilling to say that \u201cWhat are the categories of being?\u201d is\na meaningful question will assign every aspect of that question to\nmetaphysics\n\nLet us consider some aspects of the problem of universals that concern\nchanging things. (That is, that concern particulars\u2014for even if\nthere are particulars that do not change, most of the particulars that\nfigure in discussions of the problem of universals as examples are\nthings that change.) Consider two white particulars\u2014the Taj\nMahal, say, and the Washington Monument. And suppose that both these\nparticulars are white in virtue of (i.e., their being white consists\nin) their bearing some one, identifiable relation to the universal\n\u201cwhiteness\u201d. Suppose further that we are able to single\nout this relation by some sort of act of intellectual attention or\nabstraction, and that (having done so) we have given it the name\n\u201cfalling under\u201d. All white things and only white things\nfall under whiteness, and falling under whiteness is what it is to be\nwhite. (We pass over many questions that would have to be addressed if\nwe were discussing the problem of universals for its own sake. For\nexample, both blueness and redness are spectral color-properties, and\nwhiteness is not. Does this fact imply that \u201cbeing a spectral\ncolor-property\u201d is, as one might say, a second-order universal?\nIf so, does blueness \u201cfall under\u201d this universal in the\nsame sense as the sense in which a copy of Philosophical\nStudies falls under blueness?)\n\nNow what can we say about this relation, this \u201cfalling\nunder\u201d? What is it about the two objects whiteness and the Taj\nMahal that is responsible for the fact that the latter falls under the\nformer? Is the Taj perhaps a \u201cbundle\u201d of universalia\nante res, and does it fall under whiteness in virtue of the fact\nthat whiteness is one of the universals that is a constituent of the\nbundle that it is? Or might it be that a particular like the Taj,\nalthough it indeed has universals as constituents, is something more\nthan its universal constituents? Might it be that the Taj has a\nconstituent that is not a universal, a \u201csubstrate\u201d, a\nparticular that is in some sense property-less and that holds the\nuniversal constituents of the Taj together\u2014that\n\u201cbundles\u201d them? (If we take that position, then we may\nwant to say, with Armstrong (1989: 94\u201396), that the Taj is a\n\u2018thick particular\u2019 and its substrate a \u2018thin\nparticular\u2019: a thick particular being a thin particular taken\ntogether with the properties it bundles.) Or might the Taj have\nconstituents that are neither universals nor substrates? Might we have\nbeen too hasty when we defined \u2018particulars\u2019 as things\nthat are not universals? Could there perhaps be two kinds of\nnon-universals, concrete non-universals or concrete individuals (those\nwould be the particulars, thick or thin), and abstract non-universals\nor abstract individuals (\u2018accidents\u2019 or\n\u2018tropes\u2019 or \u2018property instances\u2019), things that\nare properties or qualities (and relations as well), things like\n\u201cthe (individual) whiteness of the Taj Mahal\u201d? Is the Taj\nperhaps a bundle not of universals but of accidents? Or is it composed\nof a substrate and a bundle of accidents? And we cannot neglect the\npossibility that Aristotle was right and that universals exist only\nin rebus. If that is so, we must ask what the relation is\nbetween the matter that composes a particular and the universals that\ninhere in it\u2014that inhere simultaneously in \u201cthis\u201d\nmatter and in \u201cthat\u201d matter.\n\nThe series of questions that was set out in the preceding paragraph\nwas introduced by observing that the problem of universals includes\nboth questions about the existence and nature of universals and\nquestions about how universals are related to the particulars that\nfall under them. Many of the theories that were alluded to in that\nseries of questions could be described as theories of the\n\u201contological structure\u201d of non-universals. We can contrast\nontological structure with mereological structure. A philosophical\nquestion concerns the mereological structure of an object if it is a\nquestion about the relation between that object and those of its\nconstituents that belong to the same ontological category as the\nobject. For example, the philosopher who asks whether the Taj Mahal\nhas a certain block of marble among its constituents essentially or\nonly accidentally is asking a question about the mereological\nstructure of the Taj, since the block and the building belong to the\nsame ontological category. But the philosopher who asks whether the\nTaj has \u201cwhiteness\u201d as a constituent and the philosopher\nwho supposes that the Taj does have this property-constituent and\nasks, \u201cWhat is the nature of this relation \u2018constituent\nof\u2019 that \u2018whiteness\u2019 bears to the Taj?\u201d are\nasking questions about its ontological structure.\n\nMany philosophers have supposed that particulars fall under universals\nby somehow incorporating them into their ontological structure. And\nother philosophers have supposed that the ontological structure of a\nparticular incorporates individual properties or accidents\u2014and\nthat an accident is an accident of a certain particular just in virtue\nof being a constituent of that particular.\n\nAdvocates of the existence of ante res universals, and\nparticularly those who deny that these universals are constituents of\nparticulars, tend to suppose that universals abound\u2014that there\nis not only such a universal as whiteness but such a universal as\n\u201cbeing both white and round and either shiny or not made of\nsilver\u201d. Advocates of other theories of universals are almost\nalways less liberal in the range of universals whose existence they\nwill allow. The advocate of in rebus universals is unlikely\nto grant the existence of \u201cbeing both white and round and either\nshiny or not made of silver\u201d, even in the case in which there is\nan object that is both white and round and either shiny or not made of\nsilver (such as a non-shiny white plastic ball).\n\nThe two topics \u201cthe categories of being\u201d and \u201cthe\nontological structure of objects\u201d are intimately related to each\nother and to the problem of universals. It is not possible to propose\na solution to the problem of universals that does not have\nimplications for the topic \u201cthe categories of being\u201d.\n(Even nominalism implies that at least one popular candidate for the\noffice \u201contological category\u201d is non-existent or empty.)\nIt is certainly possible to maintain that there are ontological\ncategories that are not directly related to the problem of universals\n(\u201cproposition\u201d, \u201cstate of affairs\u201d,\n\u201cevent\u201d, \u201cmere possibile\u201d), but any\nphilosopher who maintains this will nevertheless maintain that if\nthere are universals they make up at least one of the higher\nontological sub-categories. And it seems that it is possible to speak\nof ontological structure only if one supposes that there are objects\nof different ontological categories. So whatever metaphysics\ncomprehends, it must comprehend every aspect of the problem of\nuniversals and every aspect of the topics \u201cthe categories of\nbeing\u201d and \u201cthe ontological structure of objects\u201d.\nFor a recent investigation of the problems that have been discussed in\nthis section, see Lowe (2006).\n\nWe turn now to a topic that strictly speaking belongs to \u201cthe\ncategories of being\u201d, but which is important enough to be\ntreated separately.\n",
