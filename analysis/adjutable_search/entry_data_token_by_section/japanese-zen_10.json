    "main_text": "Overcoming Dualism || Zen\u2019s Meaning of Not Two\n5.3 Zen\u2019s Meaning of Not Two\n\nZen maintains that the situation created by assuming this\nepistemological paradigm is not ideal, or real, for that matter.\nHence, Zen says \u201cnot two.\u201d \u201cNot two\u201d is in\npart a recommendation for experientially achieving oneness through the\npractice of meditation, informing the holder of the \u201ctwo\u201d\nof the narrow and limited scope of her/his understanding, where the\nidea of oneness may, for now, be conceived at many levels, starting\nwith the physical, the subtle, and the sam\u0101dhic.\nGenerally speaking then, Zen takes \u201cnot two\u201d to designate\na negation of any \u201ctwo\u201d things that are affirmed to be\nindividually real, in which the perspective that realizes the place or\ndomain where two things occur is ignored. The dualistic standpoint\nalso ignores the logical fact that any \u201ctwo\u201d things cannot\nbe individually one because for one to be, it must be\ndependent on, and interconnects with, the other one. An either-or\nlogic ignores this interdependence, in part because it operates within\na conceptual and linguistic space with the assumption that there is no\ntemporal change. This assumption enables a thinker to establish the\nlaw of identity, namely that A remains the same with itself, or\nidentical with itself. With this recommendation, Zen maintains that\nmind and body, I and others, I and nature ought to be\nexperienced as one by those who remain in the everyday standpoint. To\nexpress this idea, Zen states that \u201cHeaven and Earth share the\nsame root, and I and the myriad things are one (-body).\u201d It\ndemands an holistic perspective necessary to achieve\nknowledge that is genuine and authentic. Otherwise, Zen fears that the\npractitioner will fall into one-sidedness, in which the knowledge claim\nends up being partial, imbalanced, and even prejudiced. D\u014dgen\ncaptures this by stating: \u201cWhen one side is illuminated, the\nother side remains in darkness.\u201d To characterize the dualistic,\neither-or, ego-logical standpoint by borrowing Nietzsche\u2019s\nphrase, Zen would say that it is \u201chuman, and all too\nhuman.\u201d \n\nCare must be exercised in understanding the meaning of\n\u201cnot\u201d in the phrase \u201cnot two\u201d however. Zen\ninsists that the \u201cnot\u201d primarily refers to an existential,\npractical negation of the \u201cI,\u201d which the practitioner\nachieves by \u201cup-rooting the ego-consciousness,\u201d and in\nturn yields, by implication, a logical negation as well. This is\nbecause Zen thinks the practitioner cannot achieve this negation\nsimply by following either-or logic, or for that matter by following\nthe intellectual process of reasoning, because both logic and\nreasoning intrinsically involve two things, for example, the thinker\nand the thought. With either-or logic a mere logical negation involves\nan infinite regress in negating the \u201cI\u201d; one who negates\nthe \u201cI\u201d retains the affirmative act of holding\n\u201cI\u201d in the mind as that which negates. And when the\n\u201cI\u201d further attempts to negate this affirming act, there\nstill remains an \u201cI\u201d who negates it and the process goes\non ad infinitum. For this reason, Zen recommends the\npractitioner to \u201cforget the \u2018I\u201d when engaging\noneself in any action, be it a mind-act, bodily-act, or speech-act, as\nis seen for example in both D\u014dgen and Takuan (1573\u20131645).\n\n\nTo recapitulate the idea of the Zen meaning of negation as expressed\nin \u201cnot two,\u201d Zen sees its self-cultivation as involving a\nthoroughgoing negation of the \u201cI\u201d to the point that no\nproblem, either existential or psychological, entrenched in the\n\u201cI\u201d remains. Hence, we have Rinzai\u2019s phrase:\n\u201cif you becomes a master in any place, wherever you stand is\ntrue.\u201d (Iriya, 1989, 70) Truth for Zen is not merely a matter of\nformulating or uttering a propositional statement, but rather\nembodying it by becoming, to use his phrase again, a\n\u201ctrue person of no rank,\u201d (ibid, 20) where\n\u201cno rank\u201d designates the freedom of standing beyond social\nor linguistic conventions such that a Zen person can use convention\nfreely. Equally important is Zen\u2019s contention that both logical\nand intellectual methods are abstract, for they become\ndivorced from the actual reality of day-to-day existence. In other\nwords, in the eyes of Zen, these methods lack consideration for the\nconcreteness and immediacy of lived experience. This is because the\ntheoretical standpoint defines the human being who observes things of\nnature from the outside, which can be characterized, by using\nYuasa\u2019s phrase, as a \u201cbeing-outside-of-nature.\u201d\nInstead, Zen maintains that the human being must be understood as a\nbeing rooted in nature. To use Yuasa\u2019s phrase again, it is a\n\u201cbeing-in-nature.\u201d This point is well portrayed in\nZen\u2019s landscape paintings wherein a human figure occupies the\nspace of a mere dot in a vast natural scenery (Yuasa, 2003,\n160\u20131).\n",
