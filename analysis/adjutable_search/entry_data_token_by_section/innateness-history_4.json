    "main_text": "The Kantian Turn\n5. The Kantian Turn\n\n\nKant is usually given short shrift in discussions of the history of\nthe Nativism-Empiricism controversy. He is certainly not an\nEmpiricist; he sees his philosophy as a response to the\nchallenge of Humean Empiricism. Nevertheless, he is critical of\nRationalist versions of the Innateness doctrine at every turn. In\nmy view, Kant is a\n Nativist.[9] \nThe reason for the anomalies is that he is\nmuch more than a Nativist, and assigns a very different role\nto what is innate in us than the role assigned by his Rationalist\npredecessors. \n\n\nThe \u2018more\u2019 here is Kant\u2019s distinctive approach\nto metaphysics and epistemology; his Transcendental Idealism. \nHume had argued that since knowledge is based on experience, our\nknowledge of the world could not go beyond registering and mining\nregularities in that experience. The prospect of what Kant called\nsynthetic a priori knowledge \u2013 of an understanding of the\nnecessary structuring principles of reality \u2013 was beyond us. \nKant takes it as a given that we have such knowledge and sets out to\nconstruct a system that explains how such knowledge is possible. \nHis response to Hume\u2019s challenge is to argue that the\ndistinctive structure of experience is a function of our nature. \nWe impose regularities. If these regularities are\nrecognized as our contribution, and we understand the structuring\nprinciples that are at work, we can make sense of the actuality of\nsynthetic apriori knowledge. But the price we pay is that this is\nknowledge of the world of appearances, not about things as\nthey are in themselves.\n\n\nKant divides these ordering principles into the Forms of Sensible\nIntuition and the Categories. Space and Time\nare pre-experiential ordering principles that give us sense experience\nof a spatial and temporal world. The Categories play a parallel\nrole for the understanding. Through the category of\nCausality, for example, we impose causal structure on the\nevents that we perceive. This imposed structure allows us to move\nfrom the subjectivity of successive sensations to experience of an\nobjective world. Consider an analogy: the pixel structure of\nevery picture that a digital camera takes is the result of an ordering\nprinciple imposed on every photograph by the nature of the\ncamera. The pixel structure of the representations does\nnot capture a feature of the camera-independent reality. \nSimilarly, the spatiotemporality and categorical structure of our\nexperience is not a feature of a mind-independent\nreality. \n\n\nKant\u2019s main complaint against Rationalist Nativism was that\nit accepted that the innate had to correspond to an independent\nreality, but it could not explain how we could establish such a\ncorrespondence or use it to account for the full range of our\nknowledge. In this, it failed to meet\nHume\u2019s\n challenge.[10] \nKant finds the\nposition guilty of a number of related fatal errors. \n\nWarrant. How can we establish that innate principles are\ntrue of the world? In the Prolegomena he criticizes the Innateness\ndoctrine of his contemporary Crusius because even if a benevolent\nnon-deceiving God was the source of the innate principles, we have no\nway to reliably determine which candidate principles are innate and\nwhich may pass as such (for \nsome).[11]\nPsychologism. At times\nKant seems to suggest that the psychologism of Rationalist Nativism is\nitself a problem and makes it impossible to explain how we can get\nknowledge of objective necessary connections (as opposed to\nsubjective\n necessities).[12]\nModal concepts. Callanan\n2013 reads Kant as offering a Hume-style argument that Rationalist\nNativism cannot explain how we could come to have a concept of\nobjective necessity, if all we had were innate psychological\nprinciples.\n\n\n\nThe root problem of Rationalist Nativism, as seen through the lens\nof Kant\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, is that it needs to say more\nthan that something \u2013 a framework of concepts, ideas, principles,\netc. \u2013 is innate in us. It needs to say that it is\nonly in us. It must acknowledge that we\ncreate the structure that we find in our experience. The\nproblems of Rationalist Nativism all arise from trying to get from the\nmind\u2019s structuring to the world\u2019s inherent\nstructure. Once we drop the idea that we are aiming for the\nworld\u2019s inherent, mind-independent structure, the problems\n(should) dissolve. \n\n\nFrom Plato until Kant, Nativism was supposed to serve Realism. \nWhatever the vision of reality was \u2013 Forms for Plato, matter and\nmind for Descartes, etc. \u2013 our grasp of that reality was possible\nbecause we were provided with a map to that reality before we set\nout. Kant rejects the Realist aspirations of this\ntradition. For him, we can never understand the\nultimate nature of things as they are in themselves. Our\ntheoretical knowledge can only go as deep as the structure we\nimpose. The only necessity we can grasp is the one we have\nspontaneously made.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed Kant\u2019s main complaint about the\nNativist tradition, at least as a reply to the Empiricist\nchallenge. But he also argues that we have no innate\nrepresentations of Space, of Time, of Causality, or of any of\nthe ordering principles we impose apriori (Zoeller 1989). To\nreturn to our earlier analogy: the initial state of the camera includes\nno pictures/representations of the innate abstract pixel structure that\nthe camera imposes. But unlike the camera, we can\nacquire representations of these ordering\nconstraints \u2013 these Kant terms \u2018pure apriori ideas\u2019 of\nSpace, of Time, of Causality, of Substance, and so on. These pure\napriori ideas play a crucial role in our understanding of how\nknowledge of mathematics and metaphysics and natural science is\npossible. In this respect Kant agrees with Locke that there are no\ninnate principles or ideas to be \u2018found\u2019 in us. Both hold\nthat all our ideas have their origin in experience. But Locke thinks\nthat we build these ideas by abstracting from experience and\nrecombining abstracted elements. Kant holds that such representations\nor ideas cannot be abstracted from experience; they must be\nthe product of careful reflection on the nature of\nexperience.[13]\n\n\nThe camera analogy can help highlight an important shift.\n Imagine that our camera is damaged and its resolution in part of\nthe screen is diminished. This newly acquired constraint will be\nreflected in every subsequent photo, and this low-resolution element\nwould be an \u2018apriori\u2019 feature of each photo: it would be a\ncontribution of the representational structure of the camera, not of\nthe scene. The point is that the key feature of Kant\u2019s\nframework elements is the role they play in structuring experience,\nnot whether they are present as part of the initial\ncondition. In principle, acquired changes could play\nthis\n role.[14] \nIn this respect,\nKant shifted the epistemological focus away from genetic questions of\norigins to questions about sources of warrant. \nIt could be argued that this shift moved innateness to the periphery of\nphilosophical concern until its 20th century\nrevival.\n",
