    "main_text": "The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition || From Historical Models to Contemporary Philosophical Theology\n1.3 From Historical Models to Contemporary Philosophical Theology\n\nThis historical survey has focused on prominent models of the\nrelationship between philosophy and theology in the history of\nChristian thought. The survey also illuminates some contemporary\nphilosophical and theological debates about how to understand this\nrelationship.\n\nNotwithstanding its Patristic origins, the Integrationist view has\nbeen especially prominent in recent philosophy of religion. For\nexample, Alvin Plantinga\u2019s (1984) programmatic essay\n\u201cAdvice to Christian Philosophers\u201d intentionally blurs the\ndistinction between philosophy and theology. Plantinga argues that\nChristian philosophers qua philosophers are entitled to base their\narguments on revealed truths, and urges them to investigate\ndistinctively Christian questions that may be of no interest to the\nwider philosophical community. More recent defenders of\n\u201canalytic theology\u201d have also taken an integrationist\nline. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of\nEnlightenment-style foundationalism has thoroughly blurred the\ndistinction between philosophy and theology:\n\n\nWhat difference does [this distinction] make, now that analytic\nphilosophers no longer believe that for some piece of discourse to be\na specimen of philosophy, the writer must base all his arguments on\npublic philosophical reason? Call it what you will. (Wolterstorff\n2009: 168; see also Stump 2013: 48\u201349; Timpe 2015: 13)\n\n\nYet this prominent Integrationist line has been strongly criticized by\nother philosophers of religion, who implicitly endorse some version of\nthe Contrast view, on which philosophy cannot legitimately appeal to\ntheological sources of evidence like revelation and Church authority\n(Simmons 2019; Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2\u20134).\nAt the same time, according to many Christian theologians, analytic\nphilosophy as such is almost uniquely unsuitable for investigating\nproperly theological questions (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013:\n123\u2013134). On the view of these critics, analytic philosophical\ntheology does not revive the Patristic integration of philosophy and\ntheology at all; rather, it remains a distinctly anti-theological form\nof modern philosophy.\n\nContemporary philosophers and theologians continue to debate the\nproper relationship between philosophy and theology. Before\nconsidering these debates in further detail (in\n Section 3),\n however, it is useful to briefly survey recent work in analytic\nphilosophical theology. The fact that the Integrationist view has been\nso prominent among contemporary analytic philosophers of religion has\nhelped shape a philosophical climate in which self-identified\nphilosophers, working in departments of philosophy, find it completely\nnatural to investigate explicitly Christian theological questions,\nfrom within the framework of normative Christian orthodoxy, in the\ncourse of their academic work.\n",
