    "main_text": "Uncertainty, Risk and Sequential Equilibria || Beliefs and Subjective Probabilities\n3.1 Beliefs and Subjective Probabilities\n\nIn all of our examples and workings to this point, we have presupposed\nthat players\u2019 beliefs about probabilities in lotteries match\nobjective probabilities. But in real interactive choice situations,\nagents must often rely on their subjective estimations or perceptions\nof probabilities. In one of the greatest contributions to\ntwentieth-century behavioral and social science,\n Savage (1954)\n showed how to incorporate subjective probabilities, and their\nrelationships to preferences over risk, within the framework of von\nNeumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory. Indeed, Savage\u2019s\nachievement amounts to the formal completion of EUT. Then, just over a\ndecade later,\n Harsanyi (1967)\n showed how to solve games involving maximizers of Savage expected\nutility. This is often taken to have marked the true maturity of game\ntheory as a tool for application to behavioral and social science, and\nwas recognized as such when Harsanyi joined Nash and Selten as a\nrecipient of the first Nobel prize awarded to game theorists in\n1994.\n\nAs we observed in considering the need for people playing games to\nlearn trembling hand equilibria and QRE, when we model the strategic\ninteractions of people we must allow for the fact that people are\ntypically uncertain about their models of one another. This\nuncertainty is reflected in their choices of strategies. Furthermore,\nsome actions might be taken specifically for the sake of learning\nabout the accuracy of a player\u2019s conjectures about other\nplayers. Harsanyi\u2019s extension of game theory incorporates these\ncrucial elements.\n\nConsider the three-player imperfect-information game below known as\n\u2018Selten\u2019s horse\u2019 (for its inventor, Nobel Laureate\nReinhard Selten, and because of the shape of its tree; taken from\n Kreps (1990),\n p. 426):\n\n\n\nFigure 13\n\n\nThis game has four NE: \\((\\mathrm{L}, l_2, l_3),\\) \\((\\mathrm{L}, r_2,\nl_3),\\) \\((\\mathrm{R}, r_2, l_3)\\) and \\((\\mathrm{R}, r_2, r_3).\\)\nConsider the fourth of these NE. It arises because when Player I plays\nR and Player II plays \\(r_2\\), Player III\u2019s entire information\nset is off the path of play, and it doesn\u2019t matter to the\noutcome what Player III does. But Player I would not play R if Player\nIII could tell the difference between being at node 13 and being at\nnode 14. The structure of the game incentivizes efforts by Player I to\nsupply Player III with information that would open up her closed\ninformation set. Player III should believe this information because\nthe structure of the game shows that Player I has incentive to\ncommunicate it truthfully. The game\u2019s solution would then be the\nSPE of the (now) perfect information game: \\((\\mathrm{L}, r_2, l_3).\\)\n\n\nTheorists who think of game theory as part of a normative theory of\ngeneral rationality, for example most philosophers, and refinement\nprogram enthusiasts among economists, have pursued a strategy that\nwould identify this solution on general principles. Notice what Player\nIII in Selten\u2019s Horse might wonder about as he selects his\nstrategy. \u201cGiven that I get a move, was my action node reached\nfrom node 11 or from node 12?\u201d What, in other words, are the\nconditional probabilities that Player III is at node 13 or 14\ngiven that he has a move? Now, if conditional probabilities are what\nPlayer III wonders about, then what Players I and II might make\nconjectures about when they select their strategies are\nPlayer III\u2019s beliefs about these conditional\nprobabilities. In that case, Player I must conjecture about Player\nII\u2019s beliefs about Player III\u2019s beliefs, and Player\nIII\u2019s beliefs about Player II\u2019s beliefs and so on. The\nrelevant beliefs here are not merely strategic, as before, since they\nare not just about what players will do given a set of\npayoffs and game structures, but about what understanding of\nconditional probability they should expect other players to operate\nwith.\n\nWhat beliefs about conditional probability is it reasonable for\nplayers to expect from each other? If we follow\n Savage (1954)\n we would suggest as a normative principle that they should reason and\nexpect others to reason in accordance with Bayes\u2019s\nrule. This tells them how to compute the probability of an event\n\\(F\\) given information \\(E\\) (written \u2018\\(pr(F\\mid\nE)\\)\u2019): \n\\[\npr(F\\mid E) = \\frac{pr(E\\mid F) \\times pr(F)}{pr(E)}\n\\]\n\n\nWe will put Bayes\u2019s Rule to work on an example immediately\nbelow. But first some theoretical discussion of its general\nsignificance in game theory is in order. In Section 2.8 we saw that a\nrange of complications are introduced into game theory when players\nhave scope for learning. This is an understatement: the\nmajority of the purely theoretical literature in game theory over the\npast four decades has concerned the complications in question. This is\npartly because the issues are deep and difficult, and partly because\nmost actual strategic situations to which game theory is most usefully\napplied do in fact call upon players to learn. When people (or other\nanimals) get embroiled in strategic interactions, the world\ndoesn\u2019t typically furnish unambiguous information about game\nstructures. In particular, it doesn\u2019t, so to speak, stamp\nplayers\u2019 utility functions on their foreheads. When players are\nunsure of the structure of the games they play, which depends on the\nutility vectors of all players, we say that their information is\nincomplete.\n\nIn addition, players might not know some parametric probability\ndistributions that are relevant to their strategy choices. In the\nexample of the river-crossing game just discussed, we supposed that\nboth players know ex ante (i.e., when they select their\nstrategies) the probabilities with which rocks fall and cobras strike.\nIn an actual situation of the kind imagined, this is unlikely. Both\nplayers might study both risk bridges for awhile to gather information\nabout the probability distributions of the dangerous (to the fugitive)\nevents. But estimates may be biased unless samples are very large and\nprobabilities are stationary (e.g., rockfalls don\u2019t become less\nfrequent as more exposed rocks fall). When players are uncertain about\nparametric contingencies, we model this in an extensive-form game by\nadding an additional player, usually called \u2018Nature\u2019, that\nhas no utility function, and hence no stake in the game\u2019s\noutcome, and that draws actions randomly relative to some specified\nprobability distribution. We can allow that strategic players (i.e.,\nplayers other than Nature) might have to make choices without knowing\nwhat Nature has drawn for them by putting Nature\u2019s range of\nmoves within a single information set, just as we do for strategic\nchoices in an extensive-form game where some moves are simultaneous,\nas in Figure 13 above. Then players\u2019uncertainty about parametric\nfactors is modelled as imperfect information.\n\nFinally, if strategic players\u2019estimates of uncertain parameters\nare independent, each player\u2019s estimate is potentially\ninformative to the other player. In a repeated game, players can\nacquire information about one anothers\u2019estimates of the\nparametric probabilities by observing one anothers\u2019choices.\nSuppose, for example, that in our river-crossing game there is a\nsuccession of fugitives, and successful escapees send reports back to\nthose who follow them. Now imagine that the Pursuer is surprised to\nfind Fugitives choosing the rocky bridge much less often than she\nexpected. If she assumes that the Fugitives are economically rational,\nthen she should update her estimate of the probability of\nrockfalls; evidently it was too low. Then, of course, she should\nadjust her strategy accordingly. This information is available to both\nthe Pursuer and the Fugitives, so as updating is effected the\nequilibria of the game change. In particular, because the\nextent of prior uncertainty is reduced by updating, the range\nof outcomes compatible with equilibrium shrinks, and so an equilibrium\nis more likely to be found by real-life agents.\n\nBecause Bayes\u2019s Rule is a principle to govern learning, it can\nbe relevant to games where at least some players have information that\nis either imperfect or incomplete. Where only imperfect information is\nconcerned, a theory of subjective expected utility that follows or\nmodifies Savage\u2019s axioms applies directly. This is the subject\nof the remainder of this section. Incomplete information raises deeper\nchallenges, which we will consider in later sections. But our\nrepeated-game example above allows for a particularly interesting and\npowerful application of Bayes\u2019s Rule. If players know that other\nplayers follow Bayes\u2019s Rule in updating their beliefs,\nand utility depends exclusively on information, then when\nplayers received shared signals they can jointly solve their strategic\nproblems by identifying what Aumann\n (1974,\n 1987) called \u2018correlated equilibrium\u2019. \n\nFor now, to illustrate use of Bayes\u2019s Rule in the most\nstraightforward kind of case, imperfect information without Nature in\nextensive-form games, we\u2019ll start with Selten\u2019s Horse\n(i.e., Figure 13). If we assume that players\u2019 beliefs are\nconsistent with Bayes\u2019s Rule, then we may define a\nsequential equilibrium as a solution to the game. A SE has\ntwo parts: (1) a strategy profile \u00a7 for each player, as before,\nand (2) a system of beliefs \\(\\mu\\) for each player. \\(\\mu\\)\nassigns to each information set \\(h\\) a probability distribution over\nthe nodes in \\(h\\), with the interpretation that these are the beliefs\nof player \\(i(h)\\) about where in her information set she is, given\nthat information set \\(h\\) has been reached. Then a sequential\nequilibrium is a profile of strategies \u00a7 and a system of beliefs\n\\(\\mu\\) consistent with Bayes\u2019s rule such that starting from\nevery information set \\(h\\) in the tree player \\(i(h)\\) plays\noptimally from then on, given that what she believes to have\ntranspired previously is given by \\(\\mu(h)\\) and what will transpire\nat subsequent moves is given by \u00a7.\n\nConsider again the NE that we previously identified for Selten\u2019s\nHorse, \\((\\mathrm{R}, r_2, r_3).\\) Suppose that Player III assigns\npr(1) to her belief that if she gets a move she is at node 13. Then\nPlayer I, given a consistent \\(\\mu(I),\\) must believe that Player III\nwill play \\(l_3\\), in which case her only SE strategy is L. So\nalthough \\((\\mathrm{R}, r_2, l_3)\\) is a NE, it is not a SE. \n\nThe use of the consistency requirement in this example is somewhat\ntrivial, so consider now a second case (also taken from\n Kreps (1990),\n p. 429):\n\n\n\nFigure 14\n\n\nSuppose that Player I plays L, Player II plays \\(l_2\\) and Player III\nplays \\(l_3\\). Suppose also that \\(\\mu\\)(II) assigns \\(pr(.3)\\) to\nnode 16. In that case, \\(l_2\\) is not a SE strategy for Player II,\nsince \\(l_2\\) returns an expected payoff of \\(.3(4) + .7(2) = 2.6,\\)\nwhile \\(r_2\\) brings an expected payoff of 3.1. Notice that if we\nfiddle the strategy profile for player III while leaving everything\nelse fixed, \\(l_2\\) could become a SE strategy for Player II.\nIf \u00a7(III) yielded a play of \\(l_3\\) with \\(pr(.5)\\) and \\(r_3\\)\nwith \\(pr(.5),\\) then if Player II plays \\(r_2\\) his expected payoff\nwould now be 2.2, so \\((\\mathrm{L},l_2,l_3)\\) would be a SE. Now\nimagine setting \\(\\mu\\)(III) back as it was, but change \\(\\mu\\)(II) so\nthat Player II thinks the conditional probability of being at node 16\nis greater than .5; in that case, \\(l_2\\) is again not a SE\nstrategy.\n\nThe idea of SE is hopefully now clear. We can apply it to the\nriver-crossing game in a way that avoids the necessity for the pursuer\nto flip any coins of we modify the game a bit. Suppose now that the\npursuer can change bridges twice during the fugitive\u2019s passage,\nand will catch him just in case she meets him as he leaves the bridge.\nThen the pursuer\u2019s SE strategy is to divide her time at the\nthree bridges in accordance with the proportion given by the equation\nin the third paragraph of Section 3 above.\n\nIt must be noted that since Bayes\u2019s rule cannot be applied to\nevents with probability 0, its application to SE requires that players\nassign non-zero probabilities to all actions available in extensive\nform. This requirement is captured by supposing that all strategy\nprofiles be strictly mixed, that is, that every action at\nevery information set be taken with positive probability. You will see\nthat this is just equivalent to supposing that all hands sometimes\ntremble, or alternatively that no expectations are quite certain. A SE\nis said to be trembling-hand perfect if all strategies played\nat equilibrium are best replies to strategies that are strictly mixed.\nYou should also not be surprised to be told that no weakly dominated\nstrategy can be trembling-hand perfect, since the possibility of\ntrembling hands gives players the most persuasive reason for avoiding\nsuch strategies.\n\nHow can the non-psychological game theorist understand the concept of\nan NE that is an equilibrium in both actions and beliefs? Decades of\nexperimental study have shown that when human subjects play games,\nespecially games that ideally call for use of Bayes\u2019s rule in\nmaking conjectures about other players\u2019 beliefs, we should\nexpect significant heterogeneity in strategic responses.\nMultiple kinds of informational channels typically link different\nagents with the incentive structures in their environments. Some\nagents may actually compute equilibria, with more or less error.\nOthers may settle within error ranges that stochastically drift around\nequilibrium values through more or less myopic conditioned learning.\nStill others may select response patterns by copying the behavior of\nother agents, or by following rules of thumb that are embedded in\ncultural and institutional structures and represent historical\ncollective learning. Note that the issue here is specific to game\ntheory, rather than merely being a reiteration of a more general\npoint, which would apply to any behavioral science, that people behave\nnoisily from the perspective of ideal theory. In a given game, whether\nit would be rational for even a trained, self-aware, computationally\nwell resourced agent to play NE would depend on the frequency with\nwhich he or she expected others to do likewise. If she expects some\nother players to stray from NE play, this may give her a reason to\nstray herself. Instead of predicting that human players will reveal\nstrict NE strategies, the experienced experimenter or modeler\nanticipates that there will be a relationship between their play and\nthe expected costs of departures from NE. Consequently, maximum\nlikelihood estimation of observed actions typically identifies a QRE\nas providing a better fit than any NE. \n\nAn analyst handling empirical data in this way should not be\ninterpreted as \u2018testing the hypothesis\u2019 that the agents\nunder analysis are \u2018rational\u2019. Rather, she conjectures\nthat they are agents, that is, that there is a systematic relationship\nbetween changes in statistical patterns in their behavior and some\nrisk-weighted cardinal rankings of possible goal-states. If the agents\nare people or institutionally structured groups of people that monitor\none another and are incentivized to attempt to act collectively, these\nconjectures will often be regarded as reasonable by critics, or even\nas pragmatically beyond question, even if always defeasible given the\nnon-zero possibility of bizarre unknown circumstances of the kind\nphilosophers sometimes consider (e.g., the apparent people are\npre-programmed unintelligent mechanical simulacra that would be\nrevealed as such if only the environment incentivized responses not\nwritten into their programs). The analyst might assume that all of the\nagents respond to incentive changes in accordance with Savage\nexpected-utility theory, particularly if the agents are firms that\nhave learned response contingencies under normatively demanding\nconditions of market competition with many players. If the\nanalyst\u2019s subjects are individual people, and especially if they\nare in a non-standard environment relative to their cultural and\ninstitutional experience, she might more wisely estimate a maximum\nlikelihood mixture model that allows that a range of different utility\nstructures govern different subsets of her choice data. The way to\nthink about this is as follows. Each utility model that applies to\nsome people in the sample describes a data-generating process (DGP).\nThese various DGPs interact in the game to produce outcomes. When the\ndata are used to estimate the mixture model, she learns which\nproportions of the data are best estimated by which of her\nhypothesised DGPs (provided she specified her models well enough given\nher data to identify them). All this is to say that use of game theory\ndoes not force a scientist to empirically apply a model that is likely\nto be too precise and narrow in its specifications to plausibly fit\nthe messy complexities of real strategic interaction. A good applied\ngame theorist should also be a well-schooled econometrician.\n\nOne crucial caveat, to which we will return in\n Section 8,\n is that when we apply game theory to a situation in which agents have\nopportunities to learn, because their information is imperfect or\nincomplete, then we must decide whether it is or is not reasonable to\nexpect the agents to update their beliefs using Bayes\u2019s Rule. If\nwe do not think we are empirically justified in such an\nexpectation, then we might expect agents to take actions that have no\nstrategic purpose other than to directly probe the parametric or\nstrategic environment. This presents all players with a special source\nof additional uncertainty: was the function of another player\u2019s\naction\u2019s to probe or to directly harvest utility? Handling\napplications that must allow for this kind of uncertainty requires\nconsiderable mathematical expertise, as reviewed in\n Fudenberg and Levine (1998)\n and updated in\n Fudenberg and Levine (2008).\n The consequent range of modelling discretion makes situations\ninvolving non-Bayesian learning treacherous for the applied game\ntheorist to try to predict; often, the best she can expect to usefully\ndo is explain what happened after the fact. (It should be added that\nsuch explanation is often essential for generalization to new cases,\nand, at least as importantly, to intervening if participants or\nregulators want to change outcomes.) The reader might suppose that\nthis must be the standard case: how likely can it be that people, most\nof whom have never heard of Bayes\u2019s Rule, let alone used it\ncalculate predictions, will both learn according to the rule and\nanticipate that those with whom they interact will do so too? But\nthere is a response to this basis for scepticism. Most animals,\nincluding people, have no explicit knowledge of why they behave as\nthey do. Where Bayesian learning specifically is concerned, there is\ngrowing evidence from neuroscience that what distinguishes\nneuro-cortical learning from learning in older brain regions is that\nthe former is fundamentally Bayesian\n (Clark 2016;\n Parr et al 2022). This makes explanatory sense: Bayesian learning is\nsituationally flexible learning, and supplying capacity for such\nlearning is almost certainly the function that caused neocortex to\ngrow over time in a number of socially intelligent animals, and to\nacquire a significantly larger battery of cerebral cortical neurons in\nthe case of modern humans\n (Godfrey-Smith 1996).\n It is a plausible conjecture that people are Bayesian learners\nwhether they know it or not.\n\nThe game theorist can directly exploit Bayesian learning at the\nmeta-level of her own modelling. Above it was suggested that applied\ngame theorists should estimate maximum-likelihood mixture models to\ncapture heterogeneous risk-preference structures in groups of people.\nIn the existing literature this is the current state of the art. But\nit has a limitation: results are sensitive to the modeller\u2019s\ndiscretion concerning which models she includes in her mixtures, and\nthere is no settled typology of such models. The need for such\nunprincipled discretion is potentially eliminated if the theorist\ninstead uses a Hierarchical Bayesian model (see\n Kruschke 2014;\n McElreath 2020). Advice to take up this resource does not call upon the\ngame theorist to become an expert coder, as a routine for such models\nis now included in the economist\u2019s standard econometrics\npackage, Stata (TM). This promises a substantial potential improvement\nin the power and accuracy of game-theoretic models of real strategic\ninteractions, and is an attractive target for future research.\n",
