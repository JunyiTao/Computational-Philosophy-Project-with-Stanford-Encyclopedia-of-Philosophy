Conclusion\n\nThe question of the source of the success of science has been at the\ncore of philosophy since the beginning of modern science. If viewed as\na matter of epistemology more generally, scientific method is a part\nof the entire history of philosophy. Over that time, science and\nwhatever methods its practitioners may employ have changed\ndramatically. Today, many philosophers have taken up the banners of\npluralism or of practice to focus on what are, in effect, fine-grained\nand contextually limited examinations of scientific method. Others\nhope to shift perspectives in order to provide a renewed general\naccount of what characterizes the activity we call science.\n\nOne such perspective has been offered recently by Hoyningen-Huene\n(2008, 2013), who argues from the history of philosophy of science\nthat after three lengthy phases of characterizing science by its\nmethod, we are now in a phase where the belief in the existence of a\npositive scientific method has eroded and what has been left to\ncharacterize science is only its fallibility. First was a phase from\nPlato and Aristotle up until the 17th century where the\nspecificity of scientific knowledge was seen in its absolute certainty\nestablished by proof from evident axioms; next was a phase up to the\nmid-19th century in which the means to establish the\ncertainty of scientific knowledge had been generalized to include\ninductive procedures as well. In the third phase, which lasted until\nthe last decades of the 20th century, it was recognized\nthat empirical knowledge was fallible, but it was still granted a\nspecial status due to its distinctive mode of production. But now in\nthe fourth phase, according to Hoyningen-Huene, historical and\nphilosophical studies have shown how \u201cscientific methods with\nthe characteristics as posited in the second and third phase do not\nexist\u201d (2008: 168) and there is no longer any consensus among\nphilosophers and historians of science about the nature of science.\nFor Hoyningen-Huene, this is too negative a stance, and he therefore\nurges the question about the nature of science anew. His own answer to\nthis question is that \u201cscientific knowledge differs from other\nkinds of knowledge, especially everyday knowledge, primarily by being\nmore systematic\u201d (Hoyningen-Huene 2013: 14). Systematicity can\nhave several different dimensions: among them are more systematic\ndescriptions, explanations, predictions, defense of knowledge claims,\nepistemic connectedness, ideal of completeness, knowledge generation,\nrepresentation of knowledge and critical discourse. Hence, what\ncharacterizes science is the greater care in excluding possible\nalternative explanations, the more detailed elaboration with respect\nto data on which predictions are based, the greater care in detecting\nand eliminating sources of error, the more articulate connections to\nother pieces of knowledge, etc. On this position, what characterizes\nscience is not that the methods employed are unique to science, but\nthat the methods are more carefully employed.\n\nAnother, similar approach has been offered by Haack (2003). She sets\noff, similar to Hoyningen-Huene, from a dissatisfaction with the\nrecent clash between what she calls Old Deferentialism and New\nCynicism. The Old Deferentialist position is that science progressed\ninductively by accumulating true theories confirmed by empirical\nevidence or deductively by testing conjectures against basic\nstatements; while the New Cynics position is that science has no\nepistemic authority and no uniquely rational method and is merely just\npolitics. Haack insists that contrary to the views of the New Cynics,\nthere are objective epistemic standards, and there is something\nepistemologically special about science, even though the Old\nDeferentialists pictured this in a wrong way. Instead, she offers a\nnew Critical Commonsensist account on which standards of good, strong,\nsupportive evidence and well-conducted, honest, thorough and\nimaginative inquiry are not exclusive to the sciences, but the\nstandards by which we judge all inquirers. In this sense, science does\nnot differ in kind from other kinds of inquiry, but it may differ in\nthe degree to which it requires broad and detailed background\nknowledge and a familiarity with a technical vocabulary that only\nspecialists may possess.\n",
