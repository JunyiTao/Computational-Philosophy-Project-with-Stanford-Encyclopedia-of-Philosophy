    "main_text": "Origins and Development of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || Propositions in The Principles of Mathematics\n2.2 Propositions in The Principles of Mathematics\n\nRussell\u2019s first published account of his newfound realism came in the\n1903 classic The Principles of Mathematics (POM).\nPart I of POM is dedicated largely to a philosophical inquiry\ninto the nature of propositions. Russell took over from Moore the\nconception of propositions as mind-independent complexes; a true\nproposition was then simply identified by Russell with a fact\n(cf. MTCA, 75\u201376). However, Moore\u2019s characterization of a\nproposition as a complex of concepts was largely in keeping\nwith traditional Aristotelian logic in which all judgments were\nthought to involve a subject concept, copula and predicate\nconcept.  Russell, owing in part to his own views on\nrelations, and in part from his adopting certain doctrines stemming\nfrom Peano\u2019s symbolic logic, sought to refine and improve upon this\ncharacterization. \n\n \nIn the terminology introduced in POM, constituents of a\nproposition occur either \u201cas term\u201d or \u201cas\nconcept\u201d.  An entity occurs \u201cas term\u201d when it can be\nreplaced by any other entity and the result would still be a\nproposition, and when it is one of the subjects of the proposition,\ni.e., something the proposition is \u201cabout\u201d. An entity\noccurs as concept when it occurs predicatively, i.e., only as\npart of the assertion made about the things occurring as term. In the\nproposition Socrates is human, the person Socrates (the man\nhimself) occurs as term, but humanity occurs as concept. In the\nproposition Callisto orbits Jupiter, Callisto (the moon\nitself) and Jupiter (the planet) occur as term, and the relation of\norbiting occurs as concept. Russell used the word\n\u201cconcept\u201d for all those entities capable of occurring as\nconcept\u2014chiefly relations and other universals\u2014and the\nword \u201cthing\u201d for those entities such as Socrates, Callisto\nand Jupiter, that can only occur as term. While Russell thought that\nonly certain entities were capable of occurring as concept, at the\ntime, he believed that every entity was capable of occurring as term\nin a proposition. In the proposition Wisdom is a virtue, the\nconcept wisdom occurs as term. His argument that this held generally\nwas that if there were some entity, E, that could not occur\nas term, there would have to be a fact, i.e., a true proposition, to\nthis effect.  However, in the proposition E cannot occur as term\nin a proposition, E occurs as term (POM,\n44\u201345).\n\n \nRussell\u2019s 1903 account of propositions as complexes of entities was in\nmany ways in keeping with his views as the nature of complexes and\nfacts during the core logical atomist period of 1911\u20131925. In\nparticular, at both stages he would regard the simple truth that an\nindividual a stands in the simple relation R to an\nindividual b as a complex consisting of the individuals\na and b and the relation R. However, there\nare a number of positions Russell held in 1903 that were abandoned in\nthis later period; some of the more important were these: (1) in 1903,\nRussell was committed to a special kind of propositional constituent\ncalled a \u201cdenoting concept\u201d, involved in descriptive and quantified\npropositions; (2) in 1903, Russell believed that there was such a\ncomplex, i.e., a proposition, consisting of a, b and\nR even when it is not true\nthat a bears relation R to b, and\n(3) in 1903, Russell believed in the reality of classes, understood as\naggregate objects, which could be constituents of propositions. In\neach case, it is worth, at least briefly, discussing Russell\u2019s change\nof heart.\n",
