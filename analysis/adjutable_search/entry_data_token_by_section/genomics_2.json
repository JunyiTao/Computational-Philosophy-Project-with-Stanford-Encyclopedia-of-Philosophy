    "main_text": "Reading the Genome\n2. Reading the Genome\n\nThe first genome to be sequenced was that of a virus, namely\nbacteriophage \u03a6X174, sequenced by Frederick Sanger in 1977 (Sanger et\nal. 1977). Up to about 1985, work on several other viruses was\ninitiated in different laboratories across the world and even the\nsequencing of model organisms such as the bacterium Escherichia\ncoli or the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans was being\n tackled.[7]\n\nOf all the different sequencing efforts at the time the human genome\nproject (HGP) of course stands out. Not only is the human genome\nrelatively large (roughly 3.2 billion base pairs (bps)) and of key\ninterest to us as human beings, but the HGP itself was envisioned as a\ndiverse large-scale research project with various strands and aims.\nGetting the sequence out of this project was the one goal that got the\nmost attention in the wider media, but surely many would agree that\nother findings and practices developed within the HGP were of equal or\neven greater importance.\n\nIn what follows we will treat the HGP as a pivot around which genomics\ndeveloped as a field of research and as a set of techniques. For ease\nof exposition we will talk here of a pre-HGP and a post-HGP phase.\nObviously, this is a simplification; there is not just one single\ntrajectory along which the story of genomics runs and there is not one\nclear break between a pre- and a post-genome era (Richardson &\nStevens 2015). Nevertheless, as a way of structuring the discussion\nthis distinction will be a helpful tool.\n\n",
