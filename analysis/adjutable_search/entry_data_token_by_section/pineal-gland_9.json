    "main_text": "Descartes\u2019 Views on the Pineal Gland || Body and Soul\n2.4 Body and Soul\nOne would like to know a little more about the nature of the soul and its relationship with the body, but Descartes never proposed a final theory about these issues. From passages such as the ones we have just quoted one might infer that he was an interactionist who thought that there are causal interactions between events in the body and events in the soul, but this is by no means the only interpretation that has been put forward. In the secondary literature, one finds at least the following interpretations.\n\nDescartes was a Scholastic-Aristotelian hylomorphist, who thought that the soul is not a substance but the first actuality or substantial form of the living body (Hoffman 1986, Skirry 2003).\nHe was a Platonist who became more and more extreme: \u201cThe first stage in Descartes\u2019 writing presents a moderate Platonism; the second, a scholastic Platonism; the third, an extreme Platonism, which, following Maritain, we may also call angelism: \u2018Cartesian dualism breaks man up into two complete substances, joined to another no one knows how: one the one hand, the body which is only geometric extension; on the other, the soul which is only thought\u2014an angel inhabiting a machine and directing it by means of the pineal gland\u2019 (Maritain 1944, p. 179). Not that there is anything very \u2018moderate\u2019 about his original position\u2014it is only the surprising final position that can justify assigning it that title\u201d (Voss 1994, p. 274).\nHe articulated\u2014or came close to articulating\u2014a trialistic distinction between three primitive categories or notions: extension (body), thought (mind) and the union of body and mind (Cottingham 1985; Cottingham 1986, ch. 5).\nHe was a dualistic interactionist, who thought that the rational soul and the body have a causal influence on each other. This is the interpretation one finds in most undergraduate textbooks (e.g., Copleston 1963, ch. 4).\nHe was a dualist who denied that causal interactions between the body and the mind are possible and therefore defended \u201ca parallelism in which changes of definite kinds occurrent in the nerves and brains synchronize with certain mental states correlated with them\u201d (Keeling 1963, p. 285).\nHe was, at least to a certain extent, a non-parallelist because he believed that pure actions of the soul, such as doubting, understanding, affirming, denying and willing, can occur without any corresponding or correlated physiological events taking place (Wilson 1978, p. 80; Cottingham 1986, p. 124). \u201cThe brain cannot in any way be employed in pure understanding, but only in imagining or perceiving by the senses\u201d (AT VII:358, CSM II:248).\nHe was a dualistic occasionalist, just like his early followers Cordemoy (1666) and La Forge (1666), and thought that mental and physical events are nothing but occasions for God to act and bring about an event in the other domain (Hamilton in Reid 1895, vol. 2, p. 961 n).\nHe was an epiphenomenalist as far as the passions are concerned: he viewed them as causally ineffectual by-products of brain activity (Lyons 1980, pp. 4\u20135).\nHe was a supervenientist in the sense that he thought that the will is supervenient to (determined by) the body (Clarke 2003, p. 157).\nThe neurophysiology of the Treatise of man \u201cseems fully consistent [\u2026] with a materialistic dual-aspect identity theory of mind and body\u201d (Smith 1998, p. 70).\nHe was a skeptical idealist (Kant 1787, p. 274).\nHe was a covert materialist who hid his true opinion out of fear of the theologians (La Mettrie 1748).\n\nThere seem to be only two well-known theories from the history of the philosophy of mind that have not been attributed to him, namely behaviorism and functionalism. But even here one could make a case. According to Hoffman (1986) and Skirry (2003), Descartes accepted Aristotle\u2019s theory that the soul is the form of the body. According to Kneale (1963, p. 839), the latter theory was \u201ca sort of behaviourism\u201d. According to Putnam (1975), Nussbaum (1978) and Wilkes (1978), it was similar to contemporary functionalism. By transitivity, one might conclude that Descartes was either a sort of behavorist or a functionalist.\nEach of these interpretations agrees with at least some passages in Descartes\u2019 writings, but none agrees with all of them. Taken together, they suggest that Descartes\u2019 philosophy of mind contains echoes of all theories that had been proposed before him and anticipations of all theories that were developed afterwards: it is a multi-faceted diamond in which all mind-body theories that have ever been proposed are reflected.\nIn his later years, Descartes was well aware that he had not successfully finished the project that he had begun in the Treatise of man and had not been able to formulate one comprehensive mind-body theory. He sometimes expressed irritation when others reminded him of this. In reply to the questions \u201chow can the soul move the body if it is in no way material, and how can it receive the forms of corporeal objects?\u201d he said that \u201cthe most ignorant people could, in a quarter of an hour, raise more questions of this kind than the wisest men could deal with in a lifetime; and this is why I have not bothered to answer any of them. These questions presuppose amongst other things an explanation of the union between the soul and the body, which I have not yet dealt with at all\u201d (12 January 1646, AT IX:213, CSM II:275). On other occasions, he came close to admitting defeat. \u201cThe soul is conceived only by the pure intellect; body (i.e. extension, shapes and motions) can likewise be known by the intellect alone, but much better by the intellect aided by the imagination; and finally what belongs to the union of the soul and the body is known only obscurely by the intellect alone or even by the intellect aided by the imagination, but it is known very clearly by the senses. [\u2026] It does not seem to me that the human mind is capable of forming a very distinct conception of both the distinction between the soul and the body and their union; for to do this it is necessary to conceive them as a single thing and at the same time to conceive them as two things; and this is absurd\u201d (28 June 1643, AT III:693, CSMK 227). He admitted that the unsuccessfulness of his enterprise might have been his own fault because he had never spent \u201cmore than a few hours a day in the thoughts which occupy the imagination and a few hours a year on those which occupy the intellect alone\u201d (AT III:692, CSMK 227). But he had done so for a good reason because he thought it \u201cvery harmful to occupy one\u2019s intellect frequently upon meditating upon [the principles of metaphysics which give us or knowledge of God and our soul], since this would impede it from devoting itself to the functions of the imagination and the senses\u201d (AT III:695, CSMK 228). He advised others to do likewise: \u201cone should not devote so much effort to the Meditations and to metaphysical questions, or give them elaborate treatment in commentaries and the like. [\u2026] They draw the mind too far away from physical and observable things, and make it unfit to study them. Yet it is just these physical studies that are most desirable for people to pursue, since they would yield abundant benefits for life\u201d (Conversation with Burman, 1648, AT V:165, CSMK 346\u2013347). We will follow this wise advice.\n",
