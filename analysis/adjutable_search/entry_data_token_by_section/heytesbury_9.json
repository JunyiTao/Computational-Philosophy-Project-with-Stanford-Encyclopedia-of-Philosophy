    "main_text": "Speculative Physics || .3 Augmentation\n4. Influence\n\nAs a logician, Heytesbury strongly influenced logic in fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century Britain, and there is a notable fifteenth and early\nsixteenth-century reception in Italy where multiple editions of his\ncommentaries on [RSS] and [SCD] were printed (Ashworth & Spade\n1992; de Rijk 1975, 1977). Despite his dismissive attitude toward this\ngenre, Heytesbury\u2019s treatise is one of the most influential late\nmedieval texts. These influences include the British logical tradition\n(see Pironet 2008), the Italian logical\n tradition,[48]\n and John Mair\u2019s\n circle,[49]\n and the treatise is referred to even as late as 1688 (De Benedictis\n1688: 580\u2013590; for other influence, see Spade 1989: 273).\nHeytesbury\u2019s catalogue of solutions to the paradoxes, where the\npositions are (correctly or not) attributed to fourteenth-century\nBritish logicians, is further developed and sometimes defended against\nHeytesbury\u2019s harsh and sarcastic dismissal. (R2.2) is developed\nby extending the proof and supplemented by saying that paradoxical\nsentences (or all sentences, for that matter) signify their own truth.\nFurthermore, Heytesbury\u2019s contribution to epistemic logic in the\nsecond chapter of [RSS] appears to have sparked further debate in the\nupcoming centuries, as documented by the fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century development of the British and Italian treatises\nde scire et dubitare which typically revolved around the\nsophisms formulated by Heytesbury and where Heytesbury\u2019s\nposition was among those which were discussed, sometimes with an\nexplicit attribution to Heytesbury (Boh 1993 and Hanke 2018a and\n2018b). As a philosopher, Heytesbury significantly influenced later\nOxford Calculators: John Dumbleton, anonymous author of the\nTractatus de sex inconvenientibus, Richard Swineshead, author\nof one of the most famous treatises Liber Calculationum, and\ncontinental fourteenth and fifteenth-century philosophers, e.g., John\nCasali, John of Holland, Petrus of Mantua, Cajetan of Thiene, Giovanni\nMarliani, and Paul of Venice (see Wilson 1956: 25\u201328, Rommevaux\n2017: 154\u2013160, Jung, Podko\u0144ski 2020: 130\u201331,\n148\u2013149, 151). The Middle Degree Theorem was widely discussed\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and later played an\nimportant role in the formulation of the law of free fall (see Damerow\net al. 1992: 161\u2013200, esp. 232\u2013236).\n",
