    "main_text": "\n\n\nNarrowly speaking, the correspondence theory of truth is the view that\ntruth is correspondence to, or with, a fact\u2014a view that was\nadvocated by Russell and Moore early in the 20th century. But the\nlabel is usually applied much more broadly to any view explicitly\nembracing the idea that truth consists in a relation to reality, i.e.,\nthat truth is a relational property involving a characteristic\nrelation (to be specified) to some portion of reality (to be\nspecified). This basic idea has been expressed in many ways, giving\nrise to an extended family of theories and, more often, theory\nsketches. Members of the family employ various concepts for the\nrelevant relation (correspondence, conformity, congruence, agreement,\naccordance, copying, picturing, signification, representation,\nreference, satisfaction) and/or various concepts for the relevant\nportion of reality (facts, states of affairs, conditions, situations,\nevents, objects, sequences of objects, sets, properties, tropes). The\nresulting multiplicity of versions and reformulations of the theory is\ndue to a blend of substantive and terminological differences.\n\n\nThe correspondence theory of truth is often associated with\nmetaphysical realism. Its traditional competitors, pragmatist, as well\nas coherentist, verificationist, and other epistemic theories of\ntruth, are often associated with idealism, anti-realism, or\nrelativism. In recent years, these traditional competitors have been\nvirtually replaced (at least in terms of publication space) by deflationary\ntheories of truth and, to a lesser extent, by the identity theory\n(note that these new competitors are typically not associated\nwith anti-realism). Still more recently, two further approaches have\nreceived considerable attention. One is truthmaker theory: it is\nsometimes viewed as a competitor to, sometimes as a more liberal\nversion of, the correspondence theory. The other is pluralism: it\nincorporates a correspondence account as one, but only one, ingredient\nof its overall account of truth.\n",
