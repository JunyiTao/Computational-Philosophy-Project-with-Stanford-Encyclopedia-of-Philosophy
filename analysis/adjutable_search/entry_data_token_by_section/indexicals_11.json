Each\ncontext has associated with it at least an agent, time, location, and\npossible world. The content of \u2018I\u2019 with respect to a\ncontext \\(c\\) is the agent of \\(c\\). The content of\n\u2018here\u2019 is the location of \\(c\\). The content of\n\u2018now\u2019 is the time of \\(c\\). The content of\n\u2018actually\u2019 is (roughly) the property of being the case\n(being true) with respect to the world of \\(c\\).\n\n\nKaplan extends his theory of content to linguistic expressions in\ngeneral, both simple and complex. On his view, the content of a\npredicate, with respect to a context, is a property or relation. The\ncontent of a sentence, with respect to a context, is a structured\nproposition, that is, a proposition with a constituent structure\nwhose ultimate constituents are individual, properties, and relations.\n(See the entry on \n structured propositions.) \nThe content of a sentence\n\\(S\\) with respect to a context \\(c\\) has, as its ultimate\nconstituents, the contents of (roughly) the words in \\(S\\) with\nrespect to \\(c\\).\n\n\nTo illustrate, consider the sentence \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019. Suppose that the agent of context\n\\(c_1\\) is Mary. Then the content of \u2018I\u2019 in\n\\(c_1\\) is Mary herself, while the content of \u2018is\na philosopher\u2019 in \\(c_1\\) is the property of being\na philosopher. The content of the whole sentence, in\n\\(c_1\\), is a proposition whose constituents are just\nthose two items. We can represent this proposition with the ordered\npair \\(\\langle \\text{Mary},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \nA structured proposition which, like the preceding one, has an\nindividual as a constituent, is a\nsingular proposition. The content of \u2018I\u2019 with\nrespect to another context \\(c_2\\), in which John is the\nagent, is John, and the content of \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 in\n\\(c_2\\) is the singular proposition \n\\(\\langle \\text{John},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\).\n\n\n(Before continuing, we need a few interpretive qualifications. The\ndescription of contents in the two previous paragraphs, and in the rest\nof this subsection, follows the informal parts of Kaplan\u2019s work\n(1989a, 1989b), in which he often identifies contents with individuals,\nproperties, relations, and structured propositions. See especially the\npreface to Demonstratives. But when Kaplan turns to more\ntechnical matters, he represents contents with intensions: see the end\nof this section below and also section 3.7. Kaplan even goes so far as\nto assert that singular propositions are not a part of his theory\n(1989a, p. 496). He might mean by this that they are not a part of his\nformal logic of demonstratives; or he may wish to emphasize that one\ncould accept the core of his theory of indexicals, including his\ndistinction between character and content, while rejecting structured\ncontents. In any case, for the rest of this section, we will continue\nto describe a version of Kaplan\u2019s theory that uses structured\npropositions.)\n\n\nPropositions, on Kaplan\u2019s theory, have truth-values with\nrespect to circumstances of evaluation, which Kaplan\nidentifies with pairs of times and possible worlds, \n\\(\\langle t, w \\rangle\\). A single proposition may be true with respect to one\ncircumstance of evaluation and false with respect another. For example,\nthe proposition \\(\\langle \\text{Mary}, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\) may be true at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_1 \\rangle\\) and yet false at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_2 \\rangle\\) because, in\n\\(w_1\\), Mary is a philosopher at time\n\\(t_1\\), whereas in world \\(w_2\\) she is not\na philosopher at time \\(t_1\\). Similarly, if time\n\\(t_0\\) is a time before Mary became a philosopher in\n\\(w_1\\), and \\(t_1\\) is a time after\nwhich she became a philosopher in \\(w_1\\), then\n\\(\\langle \\text{Mary},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\) is false at\n\\(\\langle t_0, w_1 \\rangle\\) but true at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_1 \\rangle\\). In the remainder\nof this section, we will usually, for the sake of simplicity, pretend\nthat Kaplan\u2019s circumstances of evaluation are just possible\nworlds, and ignore variation in truth-value over time.\n\n\nOn Kaplan\u2019s theory, we can speak not only of the truth-values\nof propositions at worlds, but also of the truth-values of\nsentences at pairs of worlds and contexts. The reason\nwe can do this is that a context determines the content of a sentence,\nand the content of that sentence determines a truth-value at a world.\nFor example, the content of the sentence \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019 in the context \\(c_1\\) described\nabove is the singular proposition that Mary is a philosopher. This\nproposition is true with respect to world \\(w_1\\). So,\nthe sentence \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 is true with\nrespect to \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_1\\). By\ncontrast, the content of the sentence \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019\nat the context \\(c_2\\) (in which John is the agent) is\nthe singular proposition that John is a philosopher, and this\nproposition is false at \\(w_1\\) (let\u2019s suppose).\nSo, the sentence \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 is false\nwith respect to \\(c_2\\) and \\(w_1\\). So,\nthe truth-value of the sentence \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019 is doubly relativized to both context and\nworld. This sort of double-relativization is often called\ndouble-indexing. (See Vlach 1973 and Kamp 1973 for early\nexamples of semantic theories that use double-indexing.)\n\n\nEach context \\(c\\) is associated with a world, called\n\u2018the world of \\(c\\)\u2019. When a sentence is true with\nrespect to context \\(c\\) and the world of \\(c\\), we say\nsimply that the sentence is true at \\(c\\), without mentioning a\nworld. But the notion of a sentence\u2019s being true at context \\(c\\)\nand world \\(w\\) is more fundamental than the notion of a\nsentence\u2019s being (simply) true at \\(c\\), for the\nlatter notion is defined in terms of the previous notion. Now suppose\nthat the two contexts mentioned above, \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(c_2\\), have the same associated world\n\\(w_1\\) (in which, recall, Mary is a philosopher but\nJohn is not). Then the sentence \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 is\ntrue at context \\(c_1\\) and false at context\n\\(c_2\\).\n\n\nThe content of a sentence, at a context, can also be evaluated for\ntruth at a world other than the world of the context. This is how the\ntruth-values of sentences that contain modal operators, such as\n\u2018possible\u2019, are determined. For example, the content of\n\u2018I am a philosopher\u2019, with respect to\n\\(c_1\\), is the singular proposition that Mary is a\nphilosopher. This proposition is true at \\(w_1\\), the\nworld of context \\(c_1\\). But this proposition is false\nat world, \\(w_2\\), in which Mary goes into mathematics\nrather than philosophy. So, the sentence is true with respect\nto \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_1\\), but false\nwith respect to \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_2\\).\nTherefore, the modal sentence \u2018It is possible\nthat I am not a philosopher\u2019 is true with respect to our\noriginal context and its associated world, \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(w_1\\). Therefore, the modal sentence \u2018It is\npossible that I am not a philosopher\u2019 is simply\ntrue with respect to \\(c_1\\). (Notice that this last\nremark did not mention a world.)\n\n\nWe can similarly speak of the content of a singular term\nwith respect to a context, and the extension or\nreferent of that term, with respect to a context and\na world. For example, the definite description \u2018the person who\ninvented bifocals\u2019 has the same content with respect to all\ncontexts. (Its content is some type of structured entity that has\nvarious properties and relations as constituents, such as the property\nof being a person, the relation of inventing, and so on.) This content\ndetermines different individuals at different worlds, because different\npeople invent bifocals at different worlds. So, the referent\nof \u2018the person who invented bifocals\u2019, with respect to a\ncontext and a world, varies from world to world, because the\nperson who invented bifocals varies from world to world. (We assume\nhere, with Kaplan, that definite descriptions are singular terms rather\nthan quantifier phrases.)\n\n\nThe situation is reversed for \u2018I\u2019. The content of\n\u2018I\u2019 varies from context to context: its content is Mary in\n\\(c_1\\), John in \\(c_2\\), someone\nelse in \\(c_3\\), and so on. But given a single context\n\\(c\\), the referent of \u2018I\u2019 with respect to \\(c\\)\nand world \\(w\\) is the same for any world \\(w\\) whatsoever.\nFor example, if Mary is the content of \u2018I\u2019 with respect to\n\\(c_1\\), then Mary is the referent of \u2018I\u2019\nwith respect to \\(c_1\\) and any world whatsoever. That\nis why, for any world \\(w\\), \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 is\ntrue at \\(c_1\\) and \\(w\\) if and only if\nMary is a philosopher in \\(w\\).\n\n\nWhen a singular term refers to object \\(o\\) with respect to\ncontext \\(c\\) and the world of c, we can simply say that\nit refers to \\(o\\) in \\(c\\), without separately mentioning a\nworld. So, \u2018I\u2019 refers to Mary in context\n\\(c_1\\) above. But once again, the notion of referring\nwith respect to (or in) \\(c\\) is the less fundamental notion, and\nis defined in terms of the more fundamental relation of referring with\nrespect to a context \\(c\\) and a world \\(w\\).\n\n\nThe content of a linguistic expression, at a context, determines a\ncorresponding intension, which is a function from possible\nworlds (circumstances of evaluation, really) to extensions. For\nexample, the content of \u2018I\u2019 with respect to the context\n\\(c_1\\) described above is Mary, and the extension of\n\u2018I\u2019 with respect to \\(c_1\\) and any world\n\\(w\\) whatsoever is Mary. The corresponding intension of\n\u2018I\u2019 with respect to \\(c_1\\) is the function\nwhose value at any world \\(w\\) is the extension of\n\u2018Mary\u2019 with respect to \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(w\\), which is just Mary herself. The intension of\n\u2018I\u2019 varies from context to context, just as the content\ndoes; for instance, in context \\(c_2\\), the intension of\n\u2018I\u2019 is the function on worlds whose value at any world is\nJohn.\n\n\nTwo expressions may have different contents in \\(c\\) and yet\nhave the same intension in that context. For instance, the contents of\nthe sentences \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 and \u2018I am a\nphilosopher and either I smoke or I do not smoke\u2019 with respect to\n\\(c_1\\) are distinct structured propositions, for the\ncontent of the second sentence in \\(c_1\\) has the\nproperty of smoking as a constituent, whereas the content of the first\none does not. Yet these propositions have the same truth-values at all\nworlds, and so they have the same intension in\n\\(c_1\\). Though contents and intensions are\ndistinct, we can use intensions to represent contents, when we\nare willing to ignore fine-grained differences in content. This is what\nKaplan does when he sets out his logic for indexicals (see section\n3.7).\n",
