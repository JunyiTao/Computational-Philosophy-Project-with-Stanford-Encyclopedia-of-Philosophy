    "main_text": "The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow? || The Internal/External Distinction\n6.1 The Internal/External Distinction \n\nRudolf Carnap\u2019s (1956) distinction between internal and external\nquestions may prove relevant here. For Carnap, an internal question is\na question that is asked within a particular linguistic framework.\nInternal questions are answered by invoking the rules of the framework\ntogether with logic and the empirical facts. Not all such questions\nare trivial, but questions about the existence of the sorts of\nentities definitive of the framework are. Carnap in fact thought that\nthe traditional metaphysician aimed to ask a framework independent\nquestion, an external question, failing to realize that external\nquestions are best seen as non-cognitive practical questions about\nwhich framework to adopt and at worst meaningless. (See the link to\nWeisberg 2000, in the Other Internet Resources section).\n\nRelying on Carnap\u2019s distinction, within certain linguistic\nframeworks, such as that presupposed by the Metaphysics 101 argument,\nit is almost trivial that there are propositions. All it takes is\nsomething as superficial as the Metaphysics 101 argument, or the\nfollowing even less enlightening argument, \u201cThe proposition that\nsnow is white is true; therefore, some proposition is true; therefore,\nthere are propositions.\u201d The traditional metaphysician, however,\naims to ask a non-trivial question about the reality of the\npropositions outside such frameworks. Such questions have no cognitive\ncontent.\n\nOne of the chief difficulties for Carnap is to explain the truth of\ninternal statements. If \u2018there are propositions\u2019 is true,\neven within a framework, what does its truth consist in? If truth in a\nframework is explained in terms of truth given the axioms of the\nframework, we will want to know about the truth-value of the\naxioms themselves. If they are true, what makes them true? If they are\nnot true, why can\u2019t we conclude that there really are no\npropositions?\n\nEven if we must reject Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction,\nperhaps some form of \u201cNeo-Carnapian\u201d ambiguity hypothesis\ncan help explain away the appeal of the Metaphysics 101 argument.\n\nA number of questions arise for the Neo-Carnapian. First, how are the\ninternal and external readings to be distinguished? Second, how\npervasive is the ambiguity? are there different readings not only for\nquantified sentences but for attitude- and truth-ascriptions as well?\nThird, what is the status of the Metaphysics 101 argument, given the\ntwo readings? The argument must be unsound when understood externally,\nbut must it be invalid, or is it a valid argument with a false\npremise? If so, which is false? Fourth, how could philosophers\nregularly miss the internal/external ambiguity?\n\nWe will briefly describe two Neo-Carnapian accounts.\n",
