    "main_text": "Instrumental Transmission\n2. Instrumental Transmission\n\nWe\u2019ll begin by discussing how means-end relations matter for\nwhat one ought, or has reason, to do or intend. (For an opinionated\nsurvey, see Kolodny 2018.) But we should first consider how\n\u201cmeans\u201d is understood. While \u201cmeans\u201d are often\ntaken to be tools or resources, for our purposes, we will view means\nas actions, intentions, choices, decisions, etc. that might make use\nof such tools or resources. It is natural to think of means to an end,\nso understood, as actions that help to cause the end to\noccur. But often philosophers count as means to an end whatever may\nhelp to bring it about. M may bring about E by\ncausing it, as flicking this switch causes the illumination of this\nroom, but M may also bring about E by helping to\nconstitute it, as playing this measure partially constitutes the\nplaying of this sonata, or fulfilling preconditions for it, as\nregistering for this conference fulfills preconditions for attending\nit, or preventing things that might prevent it, as vaccination\nprevents disease that might prevent successful completion of the\nschool year. Means are also often probabilistic. Something may also\ncount as a means to an end even if it is not guaranteed to help to\nbring about the end, but only has some chance of doing so. Usage of\n\u201cend\u201d is also often ambiguous. Sometimes \u201cend\u201d\nis used to refer to an action, such as the action of\nilluminating this room. But sometimes \u201cend\u201d is used to\nrefer to a state of affairs that is either desired or\nvaluable, such as the state of affairs of this room\u2019s being\nilluminated. We\u2019ll here use \u201cend\u201d to refer to an\naction.\n\nReasons for action are often said to \u201ctransmit\u201d from ends\nto means, in the sense that if there is reason for an end, then,\nbecause of this, there is reason for the means. This idea is captured\nin Joseph Raz\u2019s Facilitative Principle:\n\n\n[w]hen we have an undefeated reason to take an action, we have reason\nto perform any one (but only one) of the possible (for us) alternative\nplans that facilitate its performance. (Raz 2005b)\n\n\nInsofar as what one ought to do depends on what one has reason to do,\none might expect a similar transmission of \u201cought\u201d from\nend to means. If one ought to achieve an end, then one ought to take\nthe means, or at least means of certain kinds.\n\nPrinciples of instrumental transmission of this kind are compatible\nwith different views about what ends we have reason to achieve. For\nexample, it may be accepted by either a Desire-Based, or a\nValue-Based, Theory.\n\nWhat the correct principle, or principles, of instrumental\ntransmission are is controversial. Most commonly, principles describe\ntransmission to necessary means. However, some speak of sufficient\nmeans, and others speak of neither. For example, Raz\u2019s\nFacilitative Principle speaks of \u201cfacilitating plans.\u201d\nSome transmission principles say that \u201coughts\u201d transmit\nfrom end to means, others say that the full force of the reason for\nthe end transmits to the means, others say that the strength of the\nreason for the end that transmits to the means is proportional to\nother factors, and others, like Raz\u2019s Facilitative Principle,\nsay only that some reason for the end transmits to the means.\n\nTo illustrate the problems facing an account of instrumental\ntransmission, it may be useful to work with some very simple\nprinciples, which lack many of the qualifications and nuances of\nRaz\u2019s Facilitative Principle and other principles discussed in\nthe literature:\n\nOught Necessity:\nIf one ought to E, and M is a necessary means to\nE-ing, then one ought to M.\nStrong Reasons Necessity:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a necessary\nmeans to E-ing, then that is as strong a reason to\nM.\nWeak Reasons Necessity:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a necessary\nmeans to E-ing, then that is some reason to M.\nOught Sufficiency:\nIf one ought to E, and M is a sufficient means\nto E-ing, then one ought to M.\nStrong Reasons Sufficiency:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a sufficient\nmeans to E-ing, then that is as strong a reason to\nM.\nWeak Reasons Sufficiency:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a sufficient\nmeans to E-ing, then that is some reason to M.\n\n\nThere are several problems that principles of instrumental\ntransmission need to avoid. First, means to an end can be\ncostly, or otherwise objectionable. Suppose that I ought to\ntake a job in Alaska. One (sufficient) means is to fly there; another\n(sufficient) means is to take free passage on a merchant ship. But\nflying costs more than I would earn there. Presumably, I ought not\nfly. It may be said that I have some reason to fly, but that it is\noutweighed. This is an argument against Ought Sufficiency.\n\nHowever, with other kinds of costs, or objectionable features, it may\nsound wrong to say even that one has reason for the means. Suppose I\nhave reason to alleviate pangs of hunger. One sufficient means to this\nis eating a sandwich; another sufficient means is killing myself\n(Broome 2005b). Some will resist the conclusion that I have any reason\nat all to kill myself. This is an argument against Strong Reasons\nSufficiency and Weak Reasons Sufficiency. Or suppose I have reason to\nimprove college policy. But a necessary means to this is to kill the\nold don who resists any change (because unanimous approval is\nrequired). Some will resist the conclusion that I have any reason at\nall to kill the don. This is an argument against Strong Reasons\nNecessity and Weak Reasons Necessity. However, it may not be an\nargument against Ought Necessity. It may be said that the fact that\nimproving policy requires killing the don is itself a strong reason\nagainst improving policy, in light of which it is not true that one\nought to improve it. In that case, Ought Necessity does not imply that\none ought to kill the don, which seems intuitive. In any event, the\nforce of the intuition on which the argument rests may be resisted.\nGranted, it sounds odd to say that one has reason to kill oneself. But\nthis may have a pragmatic explanation. Why bother to identify any\nreason to kill oneself when it is vastly outweighed by the reasons\nagainst doing so? (Raz 2005a; Schroeder 2005a, 2007; for objection to\nthe pragmatic explanation, see Gertken and Kiesewetter 2021.)\n\nSecond, problems arise from repeated applications of\ntransmission principles. For one thing, means to means to an\nend may actually undermine the end. Suppose, to take an example of\nRyan Millsap\u2019s, Kenny has reason to bake both a loaf of bread\nand a cake for a display on Marie Antoinette. A (necessary) means to\nthat end is baking a loaf of bread. Plausibly, he has reason to bake a\nloaf of bread. A (sufficient) means to that means is baking a\ngiant loaf, which uses all of the flour. But that would prevent him\nfrom baking a cake, and so prevent him from achieving the end. So,\npresumably, he does not have reason to bake a giant loaf, even though\nit is a means to something that he has reason to do. For another\nthing, if we accept both Weak Reasons Necessity and Weak Reasons\nSufficiency, then repeated applications of these principles may imply\nthat if there is reason for something, then there is reason for\neverything. To take another example from Ryan Millsap, suppose there\nis reason to E, and let F be\nanything. If E-ing or F-ing is a necessary means\nto E-ing, and if F-ing is a sufficient means\nto E-ing or F-ing, then, repeated application of\nthose principles implies that there is reason to F. Note that\nsimilar problems arise if we accept both Ought Necessity and Ought\nSufficiency.\n\nThird, a means to an end might have a very low probability of\nhelping to bring that end about. Suppose, to take an example from\nJackson and Pargetter 1986, Professor Procrastinate has been asked to\nreview a book, which he both ought, and has reason, to do. A\n(necessary) means to reviewing it is accepting the commission to\nreview it. However, even if he accepts the commission, he is very\nunlikely to review it. Professor Dispatch, in a parallel universe, is\nin the same situation, except that he is very likely to review it if\nhe accepts. Perhaps Procrastinate, like Dispatch, has some reason to\nreview it. But Procrastinate may not have as much reason as Dispatch\nto accept; not all of the reason for the end may be transmitted to\nthis (necessary) means. And it may not be the case that Procrastinate\nought to accept. This is an argument against Strong Reasons Necessity\nand Ought Necessity, since even if one takes a necessary means, there\nmay still be a low probability of helping to bring that end about.\nHowever, it is not an argument against the Sufficiency principles,\nassuming that sufficient means, if taken, are sure to help to bring\nthe end about.\n\nIn response to this problem, one might argue that Procrastinate both\nought to write the review and ought to accept the invitation. After\nall, if we follow Jackson and Pargetter in thinking that Procrastinate\nboth ought to [write the review and accept the invitation]\nand ought to decline the invitiation, then it would no longer\nbe possible for Procrastinate to do everything that he ought to do. As\nBenjamin Kiesewetter (2015) argues, we would then have to reject\n\nJoint Satisfiability:\nIf A ought to x and A ought to\ny, then it is possible for A to [x and\ny].\n\n\nwhich might prove costly. It may be that such counterexamples to Ought\nNecessity (and Strong Reasons Necessity) rely on such costly views.\n(For further discussion, see Kiesewetter 2015, White 2017, and\nKiesewetter 2018.)\n\nThe fourth and final problem is that a sufficient means may be\nsuperfluous to an end, where this means that the end would\nstill be achieved, even if those means were omitted. Suppose that Drug\n1 is a sufficient means to relieving the patient\u2019s pain. A\ndoctor is sure to give Drug 1. Giving Drug 2, in addition, would at\nfirst neutralize the effect of Drug 1, but then recombine with it to\nproduce a third drug, which will relieve the patient\u2019s pain.\nGiving Drug 2 would be superfluous to relieving the patient\u2019s\npain, although it would help to bring it about, by being part of the\ncause of the relief of the patient\u2019s pain. Does the doctor then\nalso have any reason to give Drug 2? At first, one might be tempted to\nsay that the doctor does indeed have reason to give Drug 2, but that\nthis reason is outweighed by the cost of giving Drug 2. But observe\nthat no matter how low we make that cost, it still outweighs any\nreason to give it. This suggests that there is no reason at all to\ngive it. Note that necessary means cannot be superfluous, since if\nnecessary means were left out, the end would not be achieved.\n",
