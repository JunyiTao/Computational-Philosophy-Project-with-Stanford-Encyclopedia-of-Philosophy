    "main_text": "Varieties of Fundamentality || Absolute Independence\n1.1 Absolute Independence\n\nThe first definition of fundamentality to be considered may be labeled\nAbsolute Independence:\n\n(AI) x is\nabsolutely independent if and only if, for all metaphysical\ndependence relations D, there is no such y that\nDxy.\n\n\nWhat is included in D? We can give an open-ended list of\ncandidate relations: grounding, dependence between wholes and their\nparts (known as mereological or compositional dependence),\nrealization, existential dependence, essential dependence, and,\ncontroversially, even causal dependence (on the link to causation, see\nBernstein 2016; Koslicki 2016; Schaffer 2016b; Shaheen 2017). The list\nis open-ended partly because there is disagreement about what counts\nas a metaphysical dependence relation in the relevant sense and partly\nbecause there may be metaphysical dependence relations that we wish to\nrule out. A possible criterion (i.e., the \u201crelevant\nsense\u201d) to be included in the list is that the dependence\nrelations in question must have at least some features in common, such\nas, perhaps, transitivity. Furthermore, two philosophers may disagree,\nsay, about whether compositional dependence is a genuine metaphysical\ndependence relation. So, for these two philosophers,\n (AI)\n will produce a different definition of fundamentality, because the\nscope of D is different. We will not attempt to give a\ncomplete list or to define all these different kinds of metaphysical\ndependence, but for further details on some of them, see the separate\nentries on\n ontological dependence\n and\n metaphysical grounding.[5]\n\nWhat is important is that\n (AI)\n is an attempt to define fundamentality in the most general terms\npossible, using a very broad notion of metaphysical dependence. There\nis, however, at least one kind of dependence that we will likely wish\nto exclude from D, namely, modal dependence\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists. The reason for this is simple: nothing will be independent in\nthe sense of (AI) if modal independence is required (cf. Wang 2016).\nThis is evident if we consider some necessary existents, such as\nnumbers (assuming that numbers exist necessarily), for it is\nnecessarily the case that the number 2 exists if Socrates does. Hence,\nthe existence of Socrates necessitates the existence of the number 2.\nMoreover, the number 2 necessitates the existence of the number 3 and\nthe other way around. This obviously generalizes, resulting in no\nentity whatsoever being \u201cabsolutely existentially modally\nfree\u201d, as Wang (2016) puts it.\n\nEven if we rule out modal dependence,\n (AI)\n is a very strong sense of fundamentality, probably much too strong.\nAccordingly, it may not be a very popular option. Indeed, it is\ndifficult to find a direct endorsement of (AI) in the literature. That\nbeing said, there are some potential if controversial candidates for\nabsolutely independent entities, such as God. Perhaps it is also\npossible to think of the universe as a whole as absolutely independent\nin this sense. This might reflect something like Georges\nLema\u00eetre\u2019s theory of the \u201cprimeval atom\u201d or\nthe \u201cCosmic Egg\u201d hypothesis\u2014an idea now better known\nas the Big Bang theory. Lema\u00eetre\u2019s hypothesis was that the\nobserved expansion of the universe may have started from a single\npoint, the primeval atom, which would have contained the entire mass\nof the universe. Now, one may of course postulate that the primeval\natom itself could depend on something else, such as God, but this\nnevertheless gives us an entirely naturalistically motivated idea of\nabsolute independence. The metaphysical position that comes closest to\nthis idea would be a type of monism, perhaps motivated by\nconsiderations emerging from quantum holism (Calosi 2013; Ney 2015;\nIsmael & Schaffer 2020; Calosi 2020; Kovacs 2021; and the entry on\n monism).\n\nWhy does fundamentality defined in terms of\n (AI)\n seem too strong? One major reason for this is that many things that\nwe might normally regard as fundamental turn out to be dependent on\nother things in one sense or another. For instance, let us suppose\nthat there is a mereologically fundamental level, that is, there are\nmereological atoms that do not have any proper parts. If mereological\ndependence runs from the wholes to their parts contra priority\nmonism of the type defended by Schaffer (2010a), these\nmereological atoms are clearly independent in a mereological\nsense and most philosophers would probably want to regard them as\nfundamental. But even if these mereological atoms are mereologically\nindependent, they could still metaphysically depend on other entities\nin another sense.\n\nConsider symmetry principles in physics. Symmetries can be understood\nas a type of invariance under transformation. Some of the simplest\ncases of symmetries can be found in familiar examples from the natural\nworld, such as sunflowers, where we observe both radial and bilateral\nsymmetry. Symmetry principles play an especially important role in\nfundamental physics, such as in conservation laws: for each conserved\nquantity, such as energy or linear momentum, there is a corresponding\nsymmetry property or invariance. This gives rise to a complicated\nnetwork of dependencies among the variables that feature in\nconservation laws. How strong are these dependencies? In particular,\nare they merely causal or perhaps necessary in some stronger sense?\nThis may depend on the type of symmetry in question, as some\nsymmetries do allow violations. However, in the case of symmetries\nassociated with conservation laws, Lange (2016) has argued that there\nis a stronger type of necessity in effect, stronger than the natural\nnecessity usually associated with laws of nature. Whether or not Lange\nis correct about this, it clearly important to consider the\npossibility of non-causal dependencies such as those imposed by\nsymmetry principles because they may hold between entities that are\nindependent in some other sense (such as the mereological sense).\n\nRelatedly, Giannotti (2021a) has discussed the possibility of\nfundamental yet mutually grounded entities in more detail,\nmentioning the case of quarks as well as Leibnizian monads as\npotential examples (cf. also Wilson 2016: 192\u2013193; Wilson 2020:\n293). As Giannotti correctly observes, supposed examples of\nfundamental yet mutually grounded entities are controversial, and he\neven labels the possibility of such entities as a\n\u201cheresy\u201d, given the departure from the standard view,\nwhereby an entity is fundamental if and only if it is ungrounded.\nGiannotti argues that even if there are fundamental yet mutually\ngrounded entities, this does not prevent a grounding-based account of\nfundamentality. However, Giannotti\u2019s solution requires accepting\nnon-asymmetric grounding, which itself goes against the\ngrounding \u201corthodoxy\u201d (see Raven 2013). Giannotti (2022b)\nhas recently expanded on this and proposed the labels of radical\nbrutalism for the view according to which the fundamental facts\nare those which are wholly ungrounded and moderate\nbrutalism for the view according to which the fundamental facts\nare those which are partially ungrounded (see also Bader 2021\non bruteness and fundamentality). The upshot of Giannotti\u2019s\ndiscussion is that the choice between radical and moderate brutalism\nis currently underdetermined by empirical evidence, leading Giannotti\nto recommend pluralistic brutalism, according to which some\nfundamental facts are moderately brute whereas others are radically\nbrute.\n\nWhichever way we go here, it appears that many intuitive candidates\nfor fundamentalia would not be fundamental on the\n (AI)\n definition of fundamentality. A key issue, as with Giannotti\u2019s\nanalysis, concerns the possibility of fundamentalia being mutually\ngrounded or symmetrically dependent on each other (see also Priest\n 2018).[6]\n\nThere are two further issues to note. Firstly, as it is formulated,\n (AI)\n rules out fundamental entities that depend on themselves. It could be\neasily revised to accommodate such entities, but this is an issue that\nthe proponent of fundamentality should consider further, and there may\nbe reasons to leave room for self-dependent entities (see Bliss &\nPriest 2018b).\n\nSecondly, there is a speculative class of entities that would be\nfundamental according to\n (AI),\n but are in tension with other plausible theories. These entities are\nsometimes known as \u201cidlers\u201d (e.g., Lewis 2009: 205;\nBennett 2017: 123). For Lewis, idlers are fundamental properties,\nwhich are instantiated in the actual world, but \u201cplay no active\nrole in the workings of nature\u201d. So, idlers are at least\ncausally isolated. However, we can further postulate that\n\u201cabsolute idlers\u201d are absolutely isolated: they depend on\nnothing, and nothing, at least nothing concrete, depends on them.\nAbsolute idlers might thus be absolutely independent in the sense\nrequired by (AI). Whether there are any such absolute idlers is of\ncourse another question. If there are any absolute idlers, they are\nrather uninteresting entities\u2014indeed, they are presumably\ncompletely beyond our ken given their isolation. Moreover, for the\nidea of absolute idlers to have any plausibility, we would surely have\nto restrict their isolation in such a way that they may participate in\nabstract constructions such as sets. This is because classical set\ntheory, and indeed many other theories, entail that all entities have\nat least some entities that depend on them. This may be a good reason\nto think that no idler could be absolute in the strongest possible\nsense.\n",
