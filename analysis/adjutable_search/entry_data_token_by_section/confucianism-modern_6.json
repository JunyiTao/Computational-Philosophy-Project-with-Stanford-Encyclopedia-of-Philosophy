    "main_text": "Knowledge || Knowledge through Affective Connection\n3.2 Knowledge through Affective Connection\n\nTang Junyi\u2019s views on knowledge and cognition are complex. His\nlast book, Life Existence and the Horizons of Mind, is an\nattempt to classify all possible ways of cognizing the world into nine\nbroad horizons (on \u201chorizon\u201d see Wu 2002). A full\nexamination of these is not possible here (see Van den Stock 2021),\nbut we can identify some key themes. Like Xiong and Xu, Tang\ndistinguished different kinds of knowledge. Moral knowledge, knowledge\nof the virtuous nature in Confucianism, is self-awareness of the\nhumane (ren \u4ec1) heart-mind and nature, which must\nspontaneously come from oneself. Empirical knowledge, knowledge from\nseeing and hearing, is knowledge of the phenomenal world learned from\nexternal study. This empirical knowledge is useful, and its\ndevelopment is where Western culture excelled, but it must be\ncontrolled by moral knowledge, not the other way around.\n\n\nThis knowledge of the virtuous nature, which illuminates the internal,\nis knowledge of persons\u2019 existence in themselves. People\nabsolutely cannot have knowledge of the virtuous nature through\nknowledge of society or nature, which illuminates the external. (TJCW\n11: 65\u201366)\n\n\nIn his schema of nine horizons, science for the most part is placed in\nthe third horizon of functioning in order, which cognizes cause-effect\nrelations (TJCW 25: 1.29). Broadly construed, it could also include\nlogic and mathematics, which Tang places in the fifth horizon of\ndetached observation because they focus on pure connections of thought\n(TJCW 25: 1.30\u201331). Both are lower than the horizon of moral\npractice (the sixth). Detached observation is about observing and\nunderstanding, not changing things, and remaining here is morally\nrepugnant for Tang: we must go onto the horizon of morality which\nattempts to realize ideals in the world to improve it (TJCW 25:\n1.445\u201346). This is another way of expressing that morality is on\na higher level than scientific knowledge.\n\nThe concept of affective connection (gantong\n\u611f\u901a) occupies a central role in Tang\u2019s thought. The\nChinese term combines the words for \u201cto stimulate or\naffect\u201d (gan) and \u201cto connect or be\nconnected\u201d, with the further sense of lacking impediment or\nobstruction (tong). \u201cAffective\u201d must be\nunderstood in this sense: not necessarily related to feelings, but\nmore simply one thing affecting another. Tang defines it thusly:\n\n\nThis affective connection itself is [the heart-mind] directly meeting\nwith the objects of a cognitive horizon, and directly being aware of\nand observing them. (TJCW 26: 2.235)\n\n\nCritically, this is connection to a wider objective reality, not\nmerely a subjective awareness (Metzger 1977: 35). Affective connection\nis, among other things, the essential capacity of the heart-mind to\ncognize and interact with any other existent. One implication Tang\nwants to draw from this is that that mind and world are essentially\nconnected and interdependent (TJCW 25: 1.3\u20134; Tan 2009: 547).\nHuman life is constituted by connecting with and cognizing other\nexistents, including other people (further discussed in the section on\nhuman nature). Through cognizing other objects, we also become aware\nof the subject, and eventually to what Tang calls the\ntrans-subjective/objective horizons (the last three). Understanding\nthe subject cannot be done objectively: it must be approached through\npersonal experience and realization of the lived existence of the\nsubject (TJCW 26: 2.318).\n",
