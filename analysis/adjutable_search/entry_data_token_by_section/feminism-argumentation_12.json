    "main_text": "The Fallacies Approach to Argument Evaluation\n5. The Fallacies Approach to Argument Evaluation\n\nArgumentation theory has a tradition of taking fallacies as an\noperational concept for identifying problems with arguments. The types\nof deficiency identified as fallacies emerge from disparate points in\nthe history of philosophy, and, as Charles Hamblin (1970) first\nrecognized, the fallacies approach to argument evaluation tends to\nlack consensus regarding what constitutes a fallacy. Further, many\ntheorists find that \u201cfallacy\u201d fails as both an analytic\ncategory (Massey 1995) and a pedagogical tool (Hitchcock 1995), and\nyet the scholarly controversy has not put a stop to the regular use of\nfallacies for evaluating arguments and for teaching reasoning.\nFeminists share the ambivalence of other philosophers regarding\nfallacies, adding their own criticisms and developments, but a\nspecific controversy emerges in regard to the adversarial nature of\nfallacies.\n\nSome feminists decry the inadequacy of traditional fallacies for\naddressing problems women face in argument exchanges (Al Tamimi 2011)\nand others point out how some philosophers use fallacy labels to\ndismiss and silence feminist\n philosophers.[5]\n In particular, when feminist philosophers employ arguments concerning\nthe history of philosophy, they have been charged with committing the\ngenetic fallacy (e.g., Levin 1988). That fallacy results from taking\nthe significance of a claim or theory to depend on its origin and\nhistory\u2014its genesis\u2014and thereby dismissing that view\nwithout attention to its current meaning and context. Feminist\nphilosophers consider how the fact that mostly men developed certain\ntheories, including many philosophical theories, may undermine the\njustification for applying these theories to women. In doing so,\nfeminists also attend to how those theories currently operate.\n\nThe difficulty some philosophers have in recognizing the\nsophistication of feminist historical criticism regarding\nphilosophical theories may be due, first, to feminist use of certain\ntheories that were the target for philosophers who developed the\ncategory \u201cgenetic fallacy\u201d. Margaret Crouch explains that\nthe concept of the genetic fallacy was developed only in the early\ntwentieth century by some philosophers in the analytic tradition with\nthe explicit intention of discounting the scientific status of Marxist\nand Freudian accounts. Given that Marxist and Freudian accounts from\nthe continental European tradition have influenced a good deal of\nfeminist theory, Crouch argues that it is unsurprising that feminist\nanalysis might seem at first glance to commit the genetic fallacy\n(1991; 1993).\n\nMoreover, Crouch argues, employing the label of \u201cgenetic\nfallacy\u201d against feminist criticisms of the historically\nmasculine sources for popular views in the discipline of philosophy\nrelies on a misunderstanding of what constitutes a fallacy at a point\nwhere reasonable consensus has emerged: not every instance of a\npattern of reasoning associated with a fallacy label\u2014here\ngenetic appeals\u2014constitutes that fallacy; there may be\nexceptions and even highly reasonable practices that employ the same\npattern. So, some appeals to personal characteristics are relevant and\ndo not commit the ad hominem fallacy and some appeals to\nauthority are perfectly reasonable and not cases of the ad\nverecundiam fallacy (Walton 1995). Scholarship on the genetic\nfallacy likewise recognizes that the way a theory developed\nhistorically only\u00a0sometimes affects the value of the\nreasoning now supporting it. In particular, Crouch explains that the\ngenesis of a claim affects its justification when testimony provides\nits only support, or when a claim involves the speaker as a subject,\nand whenever the source of information has an objective connection\nsupporting the statement\u2019s truth or falsity (1991; 1993).\n\nThe charge that feminist epistemology commits the genetic fallacy in\nasking such questions about the origins of the canon not only depends\non a misunderstanding of that fallacy, the criticism itself also\ncommits the fallacy of begging the question. Critics of some feminist\nphilosophy make the epistemological assumption that the origins of a\nbelief are irrelevant to its justification, which is the very\nclaim that these feminists reject (see Crouch 1991). For instance,\nstandpoint theorists argue that women\u2019s material situation\naffects and can advantage the types of understanding that women and\nfeminists have (Harding 1991). Critics of feminist epistemology cannot\nsimply assume that the use of a certain type of premise makes a line\nof reasoning unjustified.\n\nThis kind of exchange between feminists and their critics\u2014one\nthat involves each party accusing the other of committing\nfallacies\u2014illustrates how arguers may use fallacy labels to\ncharacterize their disagreements. Some feminists advocate fallacy\nanalysis as a contextualized form of epistemology (Janack & Adams\n1999) and some suggest the development of new fallacy labels to help\naddress feminist epistemological concerns. Code suggests a counterpart\nfor ad hominem be known as ad feminam to address how\nlisteners and audiences discount women\u2019s testimony (1995:\n58\u201382). Also, androcentrism, the assumption of a masculine\nstandard, can be named as a typical problem arising in argumentation\nby using the fallacies approach. More generally, Hundleby (2016)\nargues that assuming the desirability of stereotypic qualities of\npeople who tend to be systematically granted social authority, such as\nmen and white people, may be identified as the \u201cstatus quo\nfallacy\u201d. Better education about fallacies in argumentation may\nhelp to address the implicit bias that can underlie the \u201cstatus\nquo fallacy\u201d. The proposal of new fallacy labels, for example,\nad stuprum or the appeal to sex (Anger & Hundleby 2016),\nis by no means unique to feminism, but it offers special power for\nsocial justice projects in providing language to account for socially\nmarginalized experience, thus addressing hermeneutical injustices.\n\nProficiency with the fallacies approach can be empowering even though\nany claim that a fallacy has been committed makes disagreement\nexplicit and that involves an adversarial quality which can make it\ndifficult for socially marginalized people to use. It entails at least\na minimal level of adversariality of the sort described by Govier\n(1999): \u201cminimal adversariality\u201d is opposition to another\nperson\u2019s view but not to the person. The involvement of\neven this minimal level of adversariality may make the fallacies\napproach a form of argument analysis difficult for members of\nsubordinated classes to employ in contexts where socialization and\nnorms of politeness discourage subordinates from expressing dissent\n(Rooney 2003). Yet, some individual women find success in adversarial\nengagement, some take pleasure in the heightened opposition of debate,\nand adversarial conversation is key to some women\u2019s culture and\nidentity (Schiffrin 1984; Henning 2018, 2021). Moreover, opposition is\nnecessary for feminist resistance, struggle, and change. In these\nways, women, feminists, and others with related liberatory projects\ncan find unique resources in the adversariality of the fallacies\napproach.\n",
