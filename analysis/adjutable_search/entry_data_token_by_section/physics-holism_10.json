    "main_text": "Alternative Approaches\n11. Alternative Approaches\n\nThis entry has focused mainly on\n metaphysical holism\n and its relation to nonseparability. That there is a variety of\nalternative ways of understanding holism in physics is illustrated by\na special issue of the journal Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Physics (2004) devoted to this topic.\n\nSeevinck (2004) proposes an epistemological criterion of holism and\nillustrates its application to physical theories. A physical theory\ncounts as holistic by this criterion if and only if it is impossible\nin principle to infer the global properties, as assigned in the\ntheory, by local resources available to an agent, where these include\n(at least) all local operations and classical communication. To apply\nthis criterion it is necessary to specify how a theory assigns\nproperties, a matter on which different interpretations of the theory\nmay disagree. Seevinck (2004) argues that neither classical physics\nnor Bohmian mechanics is holistic in this sense. Applying the\neigenvalue-eigenstate link to a particular state of a bipartite\nquantum system he then shows that this manifests epistemological\nholism, even when the state of the system is not\n entangled.\n\nPlacek (2004) understands quantum state holism as involving a thesis\nabout probabilities: that the probability of a joint result of a\ncombined measurement on a pair of entangled quantum systems is not\ndetermined by the probabilities of the two results. But he takes this\nto be only one ingredient of a more complete conception, whose\nformulation and analysis requires a modal framework combining\nindeterminism, (rudiments of) relativistic space-time, and\nprobability\u2014Belnap\u2019s (1992) theory of branching\nspace-times.\n\nEsfeld (2004) argues for a metaphysics of relations based on a\ncharacterization of quantum entanglement in terms of non-separability,\nthereby regarding entanglement as a sort of holism. He there\ncharacterizes non-separability as follows:\n\nNon-separability: The states of two or more systems are\nnon-separable if and only if it is only the joint state of the whole\nthat completely determines the state-dependent properties of each\nsystem and the correlations among these systems (to the extent that\nthese are determined at all).\n\n\nHe takes this to imply that any case of quantum entanglement is a case\nof non-separability, and non-separability is the reason why quantum\nentanglement is a sort of holism. (He discusses the relation between\nnon-separability and holism in chapter 8 of Esfeld (2001).)\n\nLyre (2004) and Healey (2004) see electromagnetism and other gauge\ntheories as manifesting nonseparability for reasons different from\nthose arising from quantum entanglement (cf.\n The Aharonov-Bohm Effect).\n Lyre takes this to be a variant of spatiotemporal holism, and\nconnects it to structural realism. Healey (2007) argues that general\nrelativity does not manifest this kind of nonseparability even though\nit may be formulated as a gauge theory. Weatherall (2016) argues that\na distinction exists, but it is not enough to rule out spatiotemporal\nholism in general relativity. If there are more than one spatial\ndimensions, an analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in general\nrelativity (using the directions of parallel-propagated vectors)\ntheoretically exhibits a similar type of nonseparability as that\nobserved in gauge theory.\n",
