Sympathy, and the Nature and Origin of the Moral Sentiments\n\n Our moral evaluations of persons and their character traits, on\nHume\u2019s positive view, arise from our sentiments. The virtues and vices\nare those traits the disinterested contemplation of which produces\napproval and disapproval, respectively, in whoever contemplates the\ntrait, whether the trait\u2019s possessor or another. These moral\nsentiments are emotions (in the present-day sense of that term) with a\nunique phenomenological quality, and also with a special set of\ncauses. They are caused by contemplating the person or action to be\nevaluated without regard to our self-interest, and from a common or\ngeneral perspective that compensates for certain likely distortions in\nthe observer\u2019s sympathies, as explained in\n Section 8.\n Approval (approbation) is a pleasure, and disapproval\n(disapprobation) a pain or uneasiness. The moral sentiments are\ntypically calm rather than violent, although they can be intensified\nby our awareness of the moral responses of others. They\nare types of pleasure and uneasiness that are associated with the\npassions of pride and humility, love and hatred: when we feel moral\napproval of another we tend to love or esteem her, and when we\napprove a trait of our own we are proud of it. Some interpreters\nanalyze the moral sentiments as themselves forms of these four\npassions; others argue that Hume\u2019s moral sentiments tend to\ncause the latter passions. We distinguish which\ntraits are virtuous and which are vicious by means of our\nfeelings of approval and disapproval \ntoward the traits; our approval of actions is derived from\napproval of the traits we suppose to have given rise to them. We can\ndetermine, by observing the various sorts of traits toward which we\nfeel approval, that every such trait \u2014 every virtue \u2014 has\nat least one of the following four characteristics: it is either\nimmediately agreeable to the person who has it or to others, or it is\nuseful (advantageous over the longer term) to its possessor or to\nothers. Vices prove to have the parallel features: they are either\nimmediately disagreeable or disadvantageous either to the person who\nhas them or to others. These are not definitions of\n\u2018virtue\u2019 and \u2018vice\u2019 but empirical\ngeneralizations about the traits as first identified by their effects\non the moral sentiments.\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume details the causes of the moral\nsentiments, in doing so explaining why agreeable and advantageous\ntraits prove to be the ones that generate approval. He claims that the\nsentiments of moral approval and disapproval are caused by some of the\noperations of sympathy, which is not a feeling but rather a\npsychological mechanism that enables one person to receive by\ncommunication the sentiments of another (more or less what we would\ncall empathy today).\n\n\nSympathy in general operates as follows. First, observation of the\noutward expression of another person\u2019s \u201caffection\u201d\n(feeling or sentiment) in his \u201ccountenance and\nconversation\u201d conveys the idea of his passion into my mind. So\ndoes observing the typical cause of a passion: for example, viewing\nthe instruments laid out for another\u2019s surgery will evoke ideas\nin me of fear and pain. We at all times possess a maximally vivid and\nforceful impression of ourselves. According to Hume\u2019s\nassociationism, vivacity of one perception is automatically\ntransferred to those others that are related to it by resemblance,\ncontiguity, and cause and effect. Here resemblance and contiguity are\nprimary. All human beings, regardless of their differences, are\nsimilar in bodily structure and in the types and causes of their\npassions.  The person I observe or consider may further resemble me in\nmore specific shared features such as character or\nnationality. Because of the resemblance and my contiguity to the\nobserved person, the idea of his passion is associated in my mind with\nmy impression of myself, and acquires great vivacity from it. The sole\ndifference between an idea and an impression is the degree of\nliveliness or vivacity each possesses. So great is this acquired\nvivacity that the idea of his passion in my mind becomes an\nimpression, and I actually experience the passion. When I come to\nshare in the affections of strangers, and feel pleasure because they\nare pleased, as I do when I experience an aesthetic enjoyment of a\nwell-designed ship or fertile field that is not my own, my pleasure\ncan only be caused by sympathy (T 2.2.2\u20138,\n3.3.1.7\u20138). Similarly, Hume observes, when we reflect upon a\ncharacter or mental quality knowing its tendency either to the benefit\nor enjoyment of strangers or to their harm or uneasiness, we come to\nfeel enjoyment when the trait is beneficial or agreeable to those\nstrangers, and uneasiness when the trait is harmful or disagreeable to\nthem. This reaction of ours to the tendency of a character trait to\naffect the sentiments of those with whom we have no special\naffectionate ties can only be explained by sympathy.\n\n\nWe greatly approve the artificial virtues (justice with respect to\nproperty, allegiance to government, and dispositions to obey the laws\nof nations and the rules of modesty and good manners), which (Hume\nargues) are inventions contrived solely for the interest of\nsociety. We approve them in all times and places, even where our own\ninterest is not at stake, solely for their tendency to benefit the\nwhole society of that time or place.  This instance confirms that\n\u201cthe reflecting on the tendency of characters and mental\nqualities, is sufficient to give us the sentiments of approbation and\nblame\u201d (T 3.3.1.9). The sympathy-generated pleasure,\nthen, is the moral approbation we feel toward these traits of\ncharacter. We find the character traits \u2014 the causes \u2014\nagreeable because they are the means to ends we find agreeable as a\nresult of sympathy. Hume extends this analysis to the approval of most\nof the natural virtues. Those traits of which we approve naturally\n(without any social contrivance), such as beneficence, clemency, and\nmoderation, also tend to the good of individuals or all of society. So\nour approval of those can be explained in precisely the same way, via\nsympathy with the pleasure of those who receive benefit.  And since\nthe imagination is more struck by what is particular than by what is\ngeneral, manifestations of the natural virtues, which directly benefit\nany individual to whom they are directed, are even more apt to give\npleasure via sympathy than are the manifestations of justice, which\nmay harm identifiable individuals in some cases though they contribute\nto a pattern of action beneficial to society as a whole (T\n3.3.1.13).\n",
