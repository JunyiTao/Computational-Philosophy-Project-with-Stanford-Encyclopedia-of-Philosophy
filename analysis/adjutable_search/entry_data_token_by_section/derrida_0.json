    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nDerrida was born on July 15, 1930 in El-Biar (a suburb of Algiers),\nAlgeria (then a part of France), into a Sephardic Jewish family.\nBecause Derrida\u2019s writing concerns auto-bio-graphy (writing\nabout one\u2019s life as a form of relation to oneself), many of his\nwritings are auto-biographical. So, for instance in Monolingualism\nof the Other (1998), Derrida recounts how, when he was in the\n\u201clyc\u00e9e\u201d (high school), the Vichy regime in France\nproclaimed certain interdictions concerning the native languages of\nAlgeria, in particular Berber. Derrida calls his experience of the\n\u201cinterdiction\u201d \u201cunforgettable and\ngeneralizable\u201d (1998, p. 37). In fact, the \u201cJewish\nlaws\u201d passed by the Vichy regime interrupted his high school\nstudies.\n\nImmediately after World War II, Derrida started to study philosophy.\nIn 1949, he moved to Paris, where he prepared for the entrance exam in\nphilosophy for the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.\nDerrida failed his first attempt at this exam, but passed it in his\nsecond try in 1952. In one of the many eulogies that he wrote for\nmembers of his generation, Derrida recounts that, as he went into the\ncourtyard toward the building in which he would sit for the second\ntry, Gilles Deleuze passed him, smiling and saying, \u201cMy thoughts\nare with you, my very best thoughts.\u201d Indeed, Derrida entered\nthe \u00c9cole Normale at a time when a remarkable generation of\nphilosophers and thinkers was coming of age. We have already mentioned\nDeleuze, but there was also Foucault, Althusser, Lyotard, Barthes, and\nMarin. Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Levi-Strauss, Lacan,\nRic\u0153ur, Blanchot, and Levinas were still alive. The Fifties in\nFrance was the time of phenomenology, and Derrida studied closely\nHusserl\u2019s then published works as well as some of the archival\nmaterial that was then available. The result was a Masters thesis from\nthe academic year 1953\u201354 called The Problem of Genesis in\nHusserl\u2019s Philosophy; Derrida published this text in 1990.\nMost importantly, at the \u00c9cole Normale, Derrida studied Hegel\nwith Jean Hyppolite. Hyppolite (along with Maurice de Gandillac) was\nto direct Derrida\u2019s doctoral thesis, \u201cThe Ideality of the\nLiterary Object\u201d; Derrida never completed this thesis. His\nstudies with Hyppolite however led Derrida to a noticeably Hegelian\nreading of Husserl, one already underway through the works of\nHusserl\u2019s assistant, Eugen Fink. Derrida claimed in his 1980\nspeech \u201cThe Time of a Thesis\u201d (presented on the occasion\nof him finally receiving his doctorate) that he never studied\nMerleau-Ponty and Sartre and that especially he never subscribed to\ntheir readings of Husserl and phenomenology in general. With so much\nMerleau-Ponty archival material available, it is possible now however\nto see similarities between Merleau-Ponty\u2019s final studies of\nHusserl and Derrida\u2019s first studies. Nevertheless, even if one\nknows Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought well, one is taken aback by\nDerrida\u2019s one hundred and fifty page long Introduction to his\nFrench translation of Husserl\u2019s \u201cThe Origin of\nGeometry\u201d (1962). Derrida\u2019s Introduction looks to be a\nradically new understanding of Husserl insofar as Derrida stresses the\nproblem of language in Husserl\u2019s thought of history.\n\nThe 1960s is a decade of great achievement for this generation of\nFrench thinkers. 1961 sees the publication of Foucault\u2019s\nmonumental History of Madness (Madness and\nCivilization). At this time, Derrida is participating in a\nseminar taught by Foucault; on the basis of it, he will write\n\u201cCogito and the History of Madness\u201d (1963), in which he\ncriticizes Foucault\u2019s early thought, especially Foucault\u2019s\ninterpretation of Descartes. \u201cCogito and the History of\nMadness\u201d will result in a rupture between Derrida and Foucault,\nwhich will never fully heal. In the early 60s, Derrida reads Heidegger\nand Levinas carefully. The recently published lecture course from\n1964\u20131965, Heidegger: The Question of Being and\nHistory, allows us to see how Derrida developed his questions to\nHeidegger. In 1964, Derrida publishes a long two part essay on\nLevinas, \u201cViolence and Metaphysics.\u201d It is hard to\ndetermine which of Derrida\u2019s early essays is the most important,\nbut certainly \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d has to be a\nleading candidate.\n\nWhat comes through clearly in \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d\nis Derrida\u2019s great sympathy for Levinas\u2019s thought of\nalterity, and at the same it is clear that Derrida is taking some\ndistance from Levinas\u2019s thought. Despite this distance,\n\u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d will open up a lifetime\nfriendship with Levinas. In 1967 (at the age of thirty-seven), Derrida\nhas his \u201cannus mirabilis,\u201d publishing three books at once:\nWriting and Difference, Voice and Phenomenon, and\nOf Grammatology. In all three, Derrida uses the word\n\u201cdeconstruction\u201d (to which we shall return below) in\npassing to describe his project. The word catches on immediately and\ncomes to define Derrida\u2019s thought. From then on up to the\npresent, the word is bandied about, especially in the Anglophone\nworld. It comes to be associated with a form of writing and thinking\nthat is illogical and imprecise. It must be noted that Derrida\u2019s\nstyle of writing contributed not only to his great popularity but also\nto the great animosity some felt towards him. His style is frequently\nmore literary than philosophical and therefore more evocative than\nargumentative.\n\nCertainly, Derrida\u2019s style is not traditional. In the same\nspeech from 1980 at the time of him being awarded a doctorate, Derrida\ntells us that, in the Seventies, he devoted himself to developing a\nstyle of writing. The most clearest example is his 1974 Glas\n(\u201cDeath Knell\u201d would be an approximate English\ntranslation; the current English translation simply uses the word\n\u201cglas\u201d); here Derrida writes in two columns, with the left\ndevoted to a reading of Hegel and the right devoted to a reading of\nthe French novelist-playwright Jean Genet. Another example would be\nhis 1980 Postcard from Socrates to Freud and Beyond; the\nopening two hundred pages of this book consist of love letters\naddressed to no one in particular. It seems that sometime around this\ntime (1980), Derrida reverted back to the more linear and somewhat\nargumentative style, the very style that defined his texts from the\nSixties. He never however renounced a kind of evocation, a calling\nforth that truly defines deconstruction. Derrida takes the idea of a\ncall from Heidegger. Starting in 1968 with \u201cThe Ends of\nMan,\u201d Derrida devoted a number of texts to Heidegger\u2019s\nthought. But, it is really with the 1978 publication of The Truth\nin Painting, and then throughout the 1980s, that Derrida\nintensified his reading of Heidegger. In particular, he wrote a series\nof essays on the question of sex or race in Heidegger\n(\u201cGeschlecht I\u2013IV\u201d). While frequently critical,\nthese essays often provide new insights into Heidegger\u2019s\nthought. The culminating essay in Derrida\u2019s series on Heidegger\nis his 1992 Aporias.\n\nWhile Derrida\u2019s intensive work on Husserl and phenomenology was\nprimarily limited to the late 1960s, and to the publication of\nVoice and Phenomenon in 1967, this one book produced many\ncriticisms of his reading of Husserl. Most notable is J. Claude\nEvans\u2019 Strategies of Deconstruction: Derrida and the Myth of\nthe Voice in 1991 (for other criticisms, see Bernet 1988, Brough\n1993, Mohanty 1997, and Zahavi 1999). Although throughout his career\nDerrida would mention Husserl in passing, he surprisingly wrote a\nchapter on Husserl in his Touching: Jean-Luc Nancy. One of\nthe places where he mentions Husserl is his 1971 address to a\ncommunication conference in Montreal, \u201cSignature Event\nContext.\u201d He publishes this article as the final chapter of\nMargins of Philosophy in 1972. While \u201cSignature Event\nContext\u201d contains a short discussion of Husserl, its real focus\nis Austin\u2019s speech act theory. The connection Derrida makes\nbetween Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and Austin\u2019s speech act\ntheory is that both reject citations from the realm of meaningfulness\n(Husserl) or of the performative (Austin). (Speech theory had a\nsubstantial influence on French philosophy at this moment, and Derrida\nwould continue to refer to the constative/performative distinction\nthroughout his career.) In any case, the English translation of\n\u201cSignature Event Context\u201d appeared in the first volume of\nthe new journal Glyph in 1977. The editor of Glyph,\nSam Weber, invited John Searle to write a response to \u201cSignature\nEvent Context.\u201d In his response, \u201cReiterating the\nDifferences: A Reply to Derrida,\u201d Searle points out a number of\nflaws in Derrida\u2019s argumentation and his understanding of\nAustin. For the second volume of Glyph (also published in\n1977), Derrida contributed a response to Searle\u2019s\n\u201cReply\u201d called \u201cLimited Inc a b c.\u201d In\ncontrast to Searle\u2019s ten page \u201cReply,\u201d\nDerrida\u2019s \u201cLimited Inc\u201d ran to ninety pages.\nDerrida\u2019s \u201cLimited Inc\u201d is an almost merciless\ncriticism of Searle, whom he calls \u201cSarl.\u201d For instance,\nhe points out that Searle in his \u201cReply\u201d hardly mentions\nsignature, event, or context. \u201cLimited Inc\u201d indicates\nDerrida\u2019s growing frustration with the reception of his work,\nespecially in the Anglophone world. His frustration must have\nculminated when he was offered an honorary degree at Cambridge\nUniversity in 1992. A group of analytic philosophers wrote an open\nletter\n (available online)\n to the Times of London, in which they objected to Derrida\nreceiving this honorary degree. Despite the letter, Cambridge\nUniversity awarded Derrida the degree.\n\nThroughout the Sixties, having been invited by Hyppolite and\nAlthusser, Derrida taught at the \u00c9cole Normale. In 1983, he\nbecame \u201cDirector of Studies\u201d in \u201cPhilosophical\nInstitutions\u201d at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en\nSciences Sociales in Paris; he will hold this position until his\ndeath. Starting in the Seventies, Derrida held many appointments in\nAmerican universities, in particular Johns Hopkins University and Yale\nUniversity. From 1987, Derrida taught one semester a year at the\nUniversity of California at Irvine. Derrida\u2019s close relationship\nwith Irvine led to the establishment of the Derrida archives there.\nAlso during the Seventies, Derrida associated himself with GREPH\n(\u201cLe Groupe de Recherche sur l\u2019Enseignement\nPhilosophique,\u201d in English: \u201cThe Group Investigating the\nTeaching of Philosophy\u201d). As its name suggests, this group\ninvestigated how philosophy is taught in the high schools and\nuniversities in France. Derrida wrote several texts based on this\nresearch, many of which were collected in Du droit \u00e0 la\nphilosophie (1990, one part of this book has been translated into\nEnglish as Eyes of the University. Right to Philosophy 2). In\n1982, Derrida was also one of the founders of the Coll\u00e8ge\nInternationale de Philosophie in Paris, and served as its first\ndirector from 1982 to 1984.\n\nIn the 1990s, Derrida\u2019s works went in two simultaneous\ndirections that tend to intersect and overlap with one another:\npolitics and religion. These two directions were probably first\nclearly evident in Derrida\u2019s 1989 \u201cForce of Law.\u201d\nBut one can see them better in his 1993 Specters of Marx,\nwhere Derrida insisted that a deconstructed (or criticized) Marxist\nthought is still relevant to today\u2019s world despite globalization\nand that a deconstructed Marxism consists in a new messianism, a\nmessianism of a \u201cdemocracy to come.\u201d But, even though\nDerrida was approaching the end of his life, he produced many\ninteresting texts in the Nineties and into the new century. For\ninstance, Derrida\u2019s 1996 text on Levinas, \u201cA Word of\nWelcome,\u201d lays out the most penetrating logic of the same and\nother through a discussion of hospitality. In his final works on\nsovereignty, in particular, Rogues (2003), Derrida shows that\nthe law always contains the possibility of suspension, which means\nthat even the most democratic of nations (the United States for\nexample) resembles a \u201crogue state\u201d or perhaps is the most\n\u201croguish\u201d of all states. Based on lectures first presented\nduring the summer of 1998,The Animal that Therefore I am)\nappeared as the first posthumous work in 2006; concerning animality,\nit indicates Derrida\u2019s continuous interest in the question of\nlife. We see this interest in life also in Derrida\u2019s lectures on\nthe death penalty, where he questions the meaning of cruelty (which is\nmore cruel, the death penalty or life in prison?). Animal life and\npower is the theme of Derrida\u2019s last lecture courses on\n\u201cThe Beast and the Sovereign.\u201d (For a study of this final\ncourse, see Krell 2013.)\n\nSometime in 2002, Derrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He\ndied on October 8, 2004. Since his death two biographies have appeared\n(Powell 2006 and Peeters 2013).\n",
