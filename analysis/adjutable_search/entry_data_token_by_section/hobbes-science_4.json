    "main_text": "Hobbes on the Value of Using Scientia in Natural Philosophy\n5. The Prospects for a Science of Civil Philosophy\n\nHobbes thought that he would be renowned as the founder of civil\nphilosophy just as he saw Copernicus as having initiated the\n\u201cbeginning of astronomy\u201d, Galileo as having opened the\n\u201cgate of natural philosophy universal\u201d with an account of\nthe \u201cnature of motion\u201d, and William Harvey as having first\ndiscovered the \u201cscience of man\u2019s body\u201d (see the\ndedicatory epistle to De Corpore; EW I.viii). He asserted\nthat while \u201cNatural Philosophy is\u2026 young\u201d, civil\nphilosophy itself is \u201cno older than\u2026 [his] own book De\nCive\u201d (EW I.ix). As a student of historical texts in their\noriginal\n languages,[10]\n Hobbes was well aware of many works from antiquity to his own time\naddressing issues relevant to civil philosophy. By claiming civil\nphilosophy was his invention, he intended to deny that any of those\npreceding works counted as philosophy.\n\nWhat did Hobbes see as distinguishing his work in civil philosophy\nfrom all predecessors? As points of contrast, Hobbes mentioned the\nSophists who \u201ctaught \u2026 [only how] to dispute\u201d and\nChristian theologians who introduced \u201cschool divinity\u201d, by\nwhich Hobbes meant the blending of teachings from Scripture with\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. For the latter, Hobbes saw the best\n\u201cexorcism\u201d to be the distinction between the subject\nmatters of religion, which were the \u201crules for honouring\nGod\u201d, and philosophy, which was concerned with the\n\u201copinions of private men\u201d (EW I.xi). What distinguished\nreligion from philosophy in this sense, Hobbes continued, is that\nphilosophy provides either demonstrations from definitions or\ndemonstrations from \u201csuppositions not absurd\u201d.\n\nSo far it seems that there are two criteria relevant to civil\nphilosophy that Hobbes saw as setting his apart from all other\nattempts. First, Hobbesian civil philosophy is a science\n(scientia) because human makers have the ability to know the\nactual causes of the objects of study since they construct them.\nSecond, to count as philosophy and not mere superstition or sophistry,\nHobbesian civil philosophy must provide demonstrations.\n\nHow exactly Hobbes\u2019 use of \u2018demonstration\u2019 should be\nunderstood as it relates to civil philosophy has been a subject of\ndebate among Hobbes scholars over the past several decades. Much of\nthe focus of this debate has been concerning the Laws of Nature in\nLeviathan XIV and XV. Why restrict the scope of demonstrable\ncivil philosophy to two chapters of Leviathan? Why not\ninclude, for example, Leviathan Parts III (\u201cOf A\nChristian Commonwealth\u201d) and IV (\u201cOf The Kingdom of\nDarkness\u201d)? Alternatively, why not also include chapters from\nPart II (\u201cOf Commonwealth\u201d), especially chapter XVII\n(\u201cOf the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a\nCommonwealth\u201d)? One motivation for focus upon chapters XIV and\nXV is that in those chapters Hobbes seems to have indicated that he\nsaw a deductive relationship between the laws of nature by using the\nlanguage one might expect in a demonstration. For example, Hobbes\ndescribed the second law of nature as being \u201cderived from\u201d\nthe first law (LEV 200). The remainder of this section will focus on\ntwo ways of understanding Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy as a\ndemonstration.\n\nOne way of understanding Hobbes\u2019 claim that civil philosophy is\ndemonstrable connects it to Euclidean geometry. This view has been\ncalled the \u201cdefinitivist\u201d or \u201cdefinitional\u201d\nview because of its emphasis on the importance of definitions in\nHobbes\u2019 philosophy. One articulation of the definitivist view\nunderstands Hobbes\u2019 definition of \u2018law of nature\u2019 in\nLeviathan as playing a role similar to an axiom in Euclidean\ngeometry (Deigh 1996). In Leviathan XIV, a law of nature is\ndefined as\n\n\na Precept, or generall Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is\nforbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh\naway the means of preserving the same; and to omit, that, by which he\nthinketh it may be best preserved. (LEV 198)\n\n\nThe definivist further claims that like Euclidean axioms Hobbes did\nnot view this axiom\u2014the definition of \u2018law of\nnature\u2019\u2014as requiring demonstration; instead, he derived\nthe first law of nature from it and then derived the others one from\nanother. Why is Hobbesian civil philosophy a demonstrable science on\nthis view? Simply put, it is a demonstrable science because it follows\nthe method of Euclidean geometry, viewed by Hobbes and others as the\nmodel of scientific knowledge on account of its clarity and\n rigor.[11]\n\nA virtue of the definitivist view is that it takes seriously\nHobbes\u2019 claim that civil philosophy is demonstrable. However, a\ndifficulty faced by the definitivist view, along with any other that\nunderstands Hobbes as drawing inspiration from Euclid, is that Hobbes\nhimself harshly criticized Euclidean definitions, arguing that\nEuclid\u2019s definitions \u201cought not be numbered among the\nprinciples of geometry\u201d because they did not contain the causes\nof what was to be constructed (EW VII.184). Furthermore, Hobbes\ncriticized the nature of the objects of Euclidean geometry. For\nexample, Hobbes argued against understanding lines as being without\nbreadth since there are no such bodies in nature (EW VII.202).\nAdditionally, Hobbes himself did not ground his own geometry in\nundemonstrated axioms and held that even Euclidean axioms needed to be\ndemonstrated (OL I.72; OL I.119).\n\nA second difficulty for the definitivist view lies in its inability to\naccommodate the laws of nature as commands (Hoekstra 2003: 115). If\nthe laws of nature were derived from the definition of \u2018law of\nnature\u2019, it would be difficult to see how they could then take\nthe form of instructions to perform some action. Indeed, the laws of\nnature take the form of instructions to do this or that, such as the\nfirst law of nature\n\n\nThat every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has of\nobtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,\nall helps, and advantages of Warre. (LEV 200)\n\n\nBeyond the first and second laws of nature, the remaining laws contain\ninstructions concerning what should be done to accomplish peace, that\nis, they command it, such as the third law of nature which commands\n\u201cThat men performe their Covenants made\u201d (LEV 220).\n\nAn alternative account, what has been called the \u201cmaker\u2019s\nknowledge\u201d view of Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy, attempts to\nconnect Hobbes\u2019 demonstrations and definitions in geometry with\ncivil philosophy. This view avoids the two difficulties faced by the\ndefinitivist account mentioned above and holds that Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable by appealing to Hobbes\u2019 own\nunderstanding of what constitutes a demonstration (Adams 2019). The\nremainder of this section will discuss two features of the\n\u201cmaker\u2019s knowledge\u201d account of Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy.\n\nFirst, a requirement for geometrical definitions, which Hobbes\nstressed in multiple contexts, is that they must provide the causes of\nthe things being defined. For example, Hobbes claimed that the\ndefinition of \u2018line\u2019 should be as follows: \u201ca line\nis made by the motion of a point\u201d (OL I.63). Likewise, a plane\nis made by the motion of a line. Perhaps Hobbes understood all of the\nlaws of nature to be like this type of geometrical definition, but\ninstead of the definition of something like \u2018line\u2019 they\nserved as the definition of (and thus how to make) peace. That is,\nwhen following all of the laws of nature one could make peace just as\nby following the generative instructions contained in the definition\nof \u2018line\u2019 one could make a line.\n\nSecond, a demonstration for Hobbes did not involve the derivation of\nfeatures by means of deduction. Such deductions would provide one with\nknowledge of what was already contained in the starting proposition,\nmaking it difficult to see how commands could be derived from the\ndefinition of \u2018law of nature\u2019 in Leviathan XIV.\nHowever, Hobbes explicitly said that demonstrations should be\nsynthetic, wherein one builds the complex thing to be demonstrated out\nof simpler constituent parts. A demonstration, Hobbes asserted, should\nbe understood as a showing of some construction to someone else (OL\nI.76) and, as a result, he claimed that \u201centire method of\ndemonstrating is synthetic\u201d (OL I.71). By\n\u2018synthesis\u2019 Hobbes means that one shows how something is\nput together to reach the desired end, one shows how that thing is\nmade.\n\nThe maker\u2019s knowledge view of Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy\ndraws insight from these two points and understands Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy as demonstrable in the following way. Hobbes begins civil\nphilosophy at a starting point in the \u201cnatural condition\u201d\nof human bodies in Leviathan XIII, continues by considering\nhow those bodies could be moved (by commands in the laws of nature) in\nways that would be conducive of peace and, finally, are brought\ntogether to compose the commonwealth.\n",
