    "main_text": "The Concept of Atonement and Conceptual Connections || Some Definitions\n1.2 Some Definitions\n\nThe word \u201catonement\u201d is defined around a paradigm series\nof events. First, there has been some offense or wrong that has been\ncommitted. Second, that offense is evident to the victim, who has as a\nresult become estranged from the offender. Third, something is\ndone\u2014paradigmatically by the offender\u2014to make amends for\nthe offense with the aim of propitiating the victim and achieving\nreconciliation. These amends are sometimes described as a reparation,\nsatisfaction, expiation, or sacrifice. Fourth, provided the amends are\nsuccessful, the victim forgives the offender and reconciliation\nresults. Different senses of \u201catonement\u201d pick out\ndifferent aspects of this series. Understanding atonement also\nrequires us to understand the other events in the series, such as\nforgiveness, reconciliation, and reparation, and how they relate to\natonement (see\n section 1.3).\n\nThere are non-paradigm cases of atonement as well\u2014for example,\ncases wherein (i) the victim is unaware they have been wronged, or\n(ii) the victim is aware of, but unconcerned about, having been\nwronged, or (iii) a third party makes or assists in making atonement,\nor (iv) amends seem not to require reparation, satisfaction, or\nsacrifice. Nevertheless, the following components seem essential to\natonement even in the non-paradigm cases: an offense or wrong has been\ncommitted and something is done with the aim of bringing about\nreconciliation. (For ease of expression, I will from now on usually\njust talk about wrongs being atoned for, however it should be\nunderstood that \u201coffense\u201d can be substituted for\n\u201cwrong\u201d in the following definitions. Although offenses\nhave a somewhat different moral profile from wrongs, they may also be\natoned\n for.[2])\n\nWe can now set out some plausible definitions.\n\n\nS atones for wrong R by doing A\n=defn S does A in order to reconcile the\nauthor and victim of R by removing or reducing the rift\nbetween them due to R, and A is successful in doing\nso.\n\n\n(See similar definitions in Eddy & Beilby 2006: 9; Daly 2009: 35;\nForsyth 1910 [1938: 54\u20138]; Hodges 1955: 9\u201310;\nO\u2019Collins 2007: 11; Paul 1960: 17\u201327; Rivi\u00e8re 1905\n[1909: 2\u20134].)\n\n\u201cAtones\u201d is defined so that the atoning act A is\nsuccessful in achieving the goal of bringing about reconciliation\nregarding the wrong. This seems consistent with common usage. However,\nwe also need a term for atoning that is neutral about whether success\nis achieved.\n\n\nS makes/offers atonement for wrong R by doing\nA =defn S does A in order to\nreconcile the author and victim of R by removing or reducing\nthe rift between them due to R.\n\n\nOne could offer atonement and yet fail to atone for one\u2019s\nwrongdoing. These definitions also allow that there are levels of\natonement: you fully atone if you erase the rift, and you partially\natone if you reduce the rift to various degrees. And one could atone\nfor one wrong, while not atoning for another wrong against the same\nvictim. Here the offender and victim would have reconciled regarding\nthe first wrong, but not the second. Finally, these definitions leave\nopen the possibility that a third party could atone on behalf of the\noffender.\n\nThere are two other closely related notions used by scholars that draw\nfrom the semantic range of the term. Linda Radzik, in perhaps the most\nextensive work on atonement in analytic philosophy, defines a notion\nof making amends:\n\n\nS makes amends for wrong R by doing A\n=defn by doing A S does whatever is\nmorally required to respond to having done R. (Radzik 2009:\n7)\n\n\nMaking amends is fundamentally a moral notion, whereas the above\nnotions of atonement are fundamentally relational. Radzik argues,\nhowever, that they are connected: making amends, if done properly,\nshould aim at a certain sort of reconciliation. Thus, one properly\nmakes amends, on her view, if and only if one offers atonement.\nFurther evidence for this view comes from the idea that atonement aims\nat undoing a wrong (Blocher 2004: 645; Swinburne 1989: 81\u201383).\nMaking amends arguably has the same\n end.[3]\n But even if this view of Radzik\u2019s is incorrect, making amends\nmay be well suited to, and often result in, making atonement.\n\nA third connected notion is atonement as expiation, or purification or\ncleansing (Craig 2020). We\u2019ll use the term\n\u201cexpiation\u201d to designate this notion:\n\n\nS expiates wrong R by doing A\n=defn A purifies or cleanses S of guilt\nfor having done R.\n\n\nExpiation is a prominent term in the ancient Jewish sacrificial system\nin which human sins (offenses against God) pollute the Temple, and the\nblood from ritually sacrificed animals is used to purify the Temple of\nthe pollution, thus also cleansing the sinner of guilt for their sin.\n\u201cGuilt\u201d here does not refer to the mental state of feeling\nguilty. It also does not mean \u201chaving performed a wrong\naction\u201d. It is supposed to be an objective status of some\nsort\u2014a kind of mark or blot (thus the language of cleansing is\nparticularly apt) one has in virtue of having committed a wrong, which\nremains until removed (Swinburne 1989: 74). Craig (2020: 232) analyzes\nit in retributive terms as a liability to punishment. It could also be\nanalyzed as a certain sort of moral debt\u2014perhaps a debt to the\nvictim to make up for the wrong act (Radzik 2009: 29ff).\n\nExpiation would be equivalent to making amends if the language of\npurification and cleansing is a metaphor aimed to pick out what one is\nmorally required to do in response to one\u2019s wrongdoing. At the\nvery least, expiation is sufficient for making amends, for if you have\nnot done what is morally required in response to having performed a\ngiven wrong action, then you still bear guilt for that action; you\nwould still bear a liability to punishment or an unfulfilled moral\ndebt. But expiation may not be necessary for making amends. For\ninstance, if the language of purification and cleansing also\nessentially picks out certain ways of resolving guilt (say, the use of\na sacrifice of some sort), then expiation would not be necessary for\nmaking amends so long as there are other ways of doing what is morally\nrequired in response to having performed a wrong action.\n",
