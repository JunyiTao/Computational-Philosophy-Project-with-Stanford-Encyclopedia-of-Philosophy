Epistemological Issues Related to Replication\n\nMany scientists believe that replication is epistemically valuable in\nsome way, that is to say, that replication serves a useful function in\nenhancing our knowledge, understanding or beliefs about reality. This\nsection first discusses a problem about the epistemic value of\nreplication studies\u2014called the \u201cexperimenters\nregress\u201d\u2014and it then considers the claim that replication\nplays an epistemically valuable role in distinguishing scientific\ninquiry. It lastly examines a recent attempt to formalise the logic of\nreplication in a Bayesian framework.\n",
