    "main_text": "A Return to Phenomenology || Bodily Imaginaries\n7.3 Bodily Imaginaries\n\nAlcoff is drawing attention to the salience which particular bodily\nfeatures have in our experiencing of our own bodies and the bodies of\nothers. This links her work to that of other theorists who explore\nthis relation with reference to the notions of both \u201cbody\nimage\u201d and \u201cbodily imaginaries\u201d. Weiss (1999) begins\nher exploration of body images with the work of Merleau-Ponty (1945\n[1962]) and Schilder (1935 [1950]), though castigating both for\nignoring the difference that sexed and raced positionality make. For\nMerleau-Ponty our body image or body schema is the awareness we have\nof the shape or form of our body: \u201cmy posture in the\ninter-sensory world, a form\u201d (Weiss, 10). Such an awareness is\nnot as of an objective anatomical body, but the body in the face of\nits tasks, a body in which some aspects stand out and others are\ninvisible. It is by means of such body schemas that we are able to act\nintentionally in the world, and, although they most commonly operate\nat a pre-reflective level, they constitute our sense of ourselves as\ncorporeal beings. In the work of Schilder the multiple nature of such\nbody images and their dynamic nature is stressed. For him the\nphenomenological account is interwoven with a psychoanalytic one. Our\ncorporeal or postural schema is formed, in part, by the emotional and\nimaginative significance which is given to parts of the body by our\npersonal relations with others, and by the significance attached to\ncorporeal features in the social domain: \u201cthe touches of others,\nthe interest others take in the different parts of our body, will be\nof enormous importance in the postural model of the body\u201d (Weiss\n1999: 16). This, ensures that our body image is formed by the way the\nbody is experienced and emotionally invested rather than\ncognitively represented. This is what for many writers is captured by\nthe notion of the bodily imaginary. (Gatens 1996, Lennon 2015).\nFeminists employing the concept of the bodily imaginary,(influenced by\nthe work of Irigaray discussed above), therefore, stress that the way\nwe have of experiencing our bodies invests particular contours with\nemotional and affective salience. Gatens (1996), in exploring the\nnotion of bodily imaginaries, also draws on the work of Spinoza. For\nher the imaginary body is \n\n\nthe social and personal significance of the body as\n\u201clived\u201d, socially and historically specific in that it is\nconstructed by a shared language \u2026 and common institutional\npractices. (1996: 11\u201312)\n\n\nMany of the emotional saliencies which are attached, socially or only\nindividually, to specific bodily features are damaging and\ndestructive. There are many damaging imaginaries of women\u2019s\nbodies, gay bodies, black bodies, or those imagined as disabled. It\ntherefore seems imperative that such ways of thinking/feeling specific\ncorporeal features can be subject to change. The matter becomes\ncomplex once we recognize that the affective salience which our bodies\nbear may not be available to reflective scrutiny, but nonetheless\nreveals itself in the habitual perceptual practices to which Alcoff\ndrew our attention. To effect change we need to offer alternative\npictures which make emotional (imaginative) and not only cognitive\nsense. This is a crucial issue for all writers who want to provide an\naccount of corporeal identities in terms of affectively laden body\nimages, or bodily imaginaries. We can see this process at work in the\nrewriting of the female body offered by Irigaray, and in the\nre-imagining of the black body which we find in writers such as hooks,\nwhere the skin of the man lying next to her, \u201csoot black like my\ngrand-daddy\u2019s skin\u201d can return her to \u201ca world where\nwe had a history \u2026 a world where \u2026 something wonderful\nmight be a ripe tomato, found as we walked through the rows of Daddy\nJerry\u2019s garden\u201d (hooks 1990: 33; see also Tate 2009).\nFeminist theorists of the body, working with the notion of the bodily\nimaginary, therefore see creative acts directed at alterations in our\nmode of perceiving bodies, as central to the process of political and\nsocial transformation.
