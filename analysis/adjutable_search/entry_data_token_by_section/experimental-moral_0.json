Introduction and History\n\nThe idea that our actual moral judgments are an important source of\ninformation about the origins and justification of moral norms goes\nback to ancient Greece, if not further. Herodotus recounts a story in\nwhich the Persian emperor Darius invited Greek members of his court\n\u201cand asked them what price would persuade them to eat the dead\nbodies of their fathers. They answered that there was no price for\nwhich they would do it.\u201d Darius then summoned members of a\ndifferent group, \u201cand asked them\u2026 what would make them\nwilling to burn their fathers at death. The Indians cried aloud, that\nhe should not speak of so horrid an act.\u201d Herodotus concludes\nthat stories like these prove that, as the poet Pindar writes,\n\u201ccustom is king of all,\u201d thereby providing an instance of\nthe argument from moral disagreement for relativism. Likewise, in the\nOutlines of Skepticism, Sextus Empiricus stresses that\nempirical discoveries can destabilize our confidence in universal\nmoral agreement:\n\neven if in some cases we cannot see an anomaly, we should say that\npossibly there is dispute about these matters too\u2026 Just as, if\nwe had not, for example, known about the Egyptian custom of marrying\ntheir sisters, we should have affirmed, wrongly, that it is agreed by\nall that you must not marry your sister. (Sextus Empiricus,\nOutlines of Skepticism)\n\n\nWhile the use of empirical observation in moral theory has a long\nhistory, the contemporary movement known as experimental philosophy\ngoes back only a few decades. The current experimental philosophy\nmovement owes its beginnings to the work of Stephen Stich, Shaun\nNichols and Jonathan Weinberg (2001) and Joshua Knobe (2003), but\nthe earliest instance of experimental philosophy may be Truth as\nConceived by Those Who Are Not Professional Philosophers (Naess\n1938), which surveyed ordinary speakers for their intuitions about the\nnature of truth. Contemporary philosophers have not been uniformly\naccepting of the movement, but as we will see, there are reasons to\nthink that experimental evidence might have a distinctive role,\nsignificance, and importance in moral philosophy and theorizing.\n\nThe relationship between more traditional philosophy and experimental\nwork is instructive and brings out some tensions within moral\nphilosophy and theory: namely, morality is at once practical and\nnormative, and these two aspects inform and constrain the extent to\nwhich it is accountable to human psychology.\n\nInsofar as morality is practical, it should be accessible to and\nattainable by agents like us: if a theory is too demanding, or relies\non intuitions, judgments, motivations, or capacities that people do\nnot (or, worse, cannot) possess, we might on those grounds dismiss it.\nOn the other hand, morality is also normative: it aims not just to\ndescribe what we actually do or think, but to guide our practice. For\nthis reason, some philosophers have responded to experimental results\nclaiming to show that attaining and reliably expressing virtues in a\nwide variety of situations is difficult (see section 3.1 below for a\ndiscussion of this literature) by pointing out that the fact that\npeople do not always make the right judgment, or perform actions for\nthe right reasons, does not falsify a theory\u2014it simply shows\nthat people often act in ways that are morally deficient. We will\nreturn to these issues when we discuss criticisms of experimental\nmoral philosophy at the end of this entry; for now, we mention them to\nillustrate that the extent to which experimental moral philosophy\nchallenges traditional philosophical approaches is itself a\ncontroversial issue. Some moral philosophers see themselves as\nderiving moral principles a priori, without appeal to contingent facts\nabout human psychology. Others see themselves as working within a\ntradition, going back at least as far as Aristotle, that conceives of\nethics as the study of human flourishing. These philosophers have not\nnecessarily embraced experimental moral philosophy, but many\npractitioners envision their projects as outgrowths of the\nnaturalistic moral theories developed by Aristotle, Hume, and\nothers.\n",
