    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Language-games and Family Resemblance\n3.4 Language-games and Family Resemblance\n\nThroughout the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein\nreturns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make\nclear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive\nlanguage-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or\nthat characteristic of language. Thus, the builders\u2019\nlanguage-game (PI 2), in which a builder and his assistant\nuse exactly four terms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to\nillustrate that part of the Augustinian picture of language which\nmight be correct but which is, nevertheless, strictly limited because\nit ignores the essential role of action in establishing meaning.\n\u2018Regular\u2019 language-games, such as the astonishing list\nprovided in PI 23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event,\nspeculating about an event, forming and testing a hypothesis, making\nup a story, reading it, play-acting, singing catches, guessing\nriddles, making a joke, translating, asking, thanking, and so on),\nbring out the openness of our possibilities in using language and in\ndescribing it.\n\nLanguage-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by\nWittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of\nlanguage-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This\ndoes not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and\nevery language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this\nsort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,\nessential definition of \u2018game,\u2019 so we cannot find\n\u201cwhat is common to all these activities and what makes them into\nlanguage or parts of language\u201d (PI 65).\n\nIt is here that Wittgenstein\u2019s rejection of general\nexplanations, and definitions based on sufficient and necessary\nconditions, is best pronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the\nphilosopher\u2019s \u201ccraving for generality,\u201d he points to\n\u2018family resemblance\u2019 as the more suitable analogy for the\nmeans of connecting particular uses of the same word. There is no\nreason to look, as we have done traditionally\u2014and\ndogmatically\u2014for one, essential core in which the meaning of a\nword is located and which is, therefore, common to all uses of that\nword. We should, instead, travel with the word\u2019s uses through\n\u201ca complicated network of similarities overlapping and\ncriss-crossing\u201d (PI 66). Family resemblance also serves\nto exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from exactness that\ncharacterize different uses of the same concept. Such boundaries and\nexactness are the definitive traits of form\u2014be it Platonic form,\nAristotelian form, or the general form of a proposition adumbrated in\nthe Tractatus. It is from such forms that applications of\nconcepts can be deduced, but this is precisely what Wittgenstein now\neschews in favor of appeal to similarity of a kind with family\nresemblance.\n",
