    "main_text": "Three-Valued Conditionals || Motivations\n2.1 Motivations\n\nLogics of indicative conditionals, in so far as they are based on\ntruth evaluations, all agree that a conditional is false if its\nantecedent is true and its consequent is false. This is captured by\nthe two-valued analysis. Less obvious is the assumption that a\nconditional is true when both antecedent and consequent are true, for\nthis predicts that \\(A\\wedge B\\) entails \\(A >B\\). And even more\ncontroversial is the proviso that a conditional is true whenever its\nantecedent is false, which indeed is one of the paradoxes of the\nmaterial conditional.\n\nC. I. Lewis\u2019s (1912) response to the paradoxes of the material\nconditional is his proposal of a strict conditional (aka \u201cstrict\nimplication\u201d, section\n 3).\n The strict conditional is no longer truth-functional, however. A\ncloser kin to standard two-valued logic in this regard is the family\nof three-valued logics originating from the work of \u0141ukasiewicz\n(1920), which retain truth-functionality. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nmain motivation was not to deal specifically with conditionals,\nhowever, but with the notion of possibility. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nconditional is shown in\n Table 2.\n \u0141ukasiewicz defines validity to be the preservation of the value\n1 from premises to conclusion, as in two-valued logic. His operator\nretains the law of Identity \\(A>A\\) and various classic schemata\n(such as Modus Ponens), but it also fails some classical properties\n(it is non-contractive, for example, failing the inference from\n\\(A>(A>B)\\) to \\(A>B\\)). It agrees with the two-valued\nconditional on classical input, and it does not block the paradoxes of\nthe material conditional.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(B\\) \n\n\\(A > B\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0  \n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n\\(A\\)\n\u00bd\n1\n1\n\u00bd \n\n\u00a0\n0\n1\n1\n1  \n\n\nTable 2: \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nconditional\n\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work was a source of inspiration to\nReichenbach, and subsequently to de Finetti, both of whom put forward\nthe idea expressed earlier by Ramsey that a conditional must be\nindeterminate when its antecedent is false (see Reichenbach 1935,\n1944; de Finetti 1936). Reichenbach deems meaningless the\nevaluation of a conditional \\(A>B\\) when \\(A\\) concerns some\nmeasurement rendered impossible by some other measurement (as\npredicted in quantum physics). For de Finetti, the idea is that a\nconditional sentence is like a bet. When someone bets that the card\nwill be a king if it is a club, the bet should simply be called off if\nthe card turns out to be of a different suit. On that basis, de\nFinetti proposed a table (sometimes called the \u201cdefective\u201d\nconditional, see Baratgin et al. 2013, Over & Baratgin 2017) for\nwhat he calls the logic of tri-events, where a tri-event refers to\n\u201cthe event \\(B\\) conditional upon event \\(A\\)\u201d. The\ntri-event is true when both events are true, false when \\(A\\) is true\nand \\(B\\) false, and null if \\(B\\) is false.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(B\\) \n\n\\(A > B\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0  \n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n\\(A\\)\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd \n\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd  \n\n\nTable 3: De Finetti\u2019s\nconditional\n\n\nAs\n Table 3\n shows, there is now a third truth value \u00bd (for\n\u201cnull\u201d or \u201cvoid\u201d or\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d) beyond the classical values 1 (for\n\u201ctrue\u201d) and 0 (for \u201cfalse\u201d). This is why these\nlogics are called trivalent. The conditional is no longer\nclassically valued for classical input. Although Reichenbach and de\nFinetti considered the interplay of this conditional with other\ntrivalent connectives, they did not investigate the logics resulting\nfrom that choice. Investigations of logics resulting from de\nFinetti\u2019s table spread in a scattered way, often oblivious of\nthe work of Reichenbach and de Finetti. One path was paved by remarks\ndue to Quine (1950), crediting the work of Ph. Rhinelander on the idea\nthat the assertion of a sentence of the form \u201cif \\(A\\) then\n\\(C\\)\u201d is commonly felt \u201cless as the assertion of a\nconditional than as a conditional assertion of the consequent\u201d\n(see Jeffrey 1963; Cooper 1968; Belnap 1970, 1973; Manor 1975; Farrell\n1979, 1986; Olkhovikov 2002; Huitink 2008). This view is known more\nbroadly as the suppositional view (Adams 1975; Edgington 1995).\nAnother line of work was pursued in connection with algebraic\ntreatments of probability, much in the spirit of de Finetti\u2019s\noriginal work, who viewed trivalence as a way of representing the\nnotion of conditional probability more qualitatively (see Schay 1968;\nCalabrese 1991; Dubois & Prade 1994; McDermott 1996; Milne 1997;\nCantwell 2008; Rothschild 2014; Lassiter 2020).\n",
