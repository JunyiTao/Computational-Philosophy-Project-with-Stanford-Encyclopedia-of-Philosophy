Varieties of Ontological Dependence\n\nA crucial notion in metaphysics is that of one entity depending\nfor its existence upon another entity\u2014not in a merely\ncausal sense, but in a deeper, ontological sense (but see Ingthorsson\n2002: 96 for discussion on the idea that causal relations could be\nunderstood as one-sided existential dependence; cf. also Bennett 2017:\nCh. 4, where it is argued that the line between causal and noncausal\ndetermination is not clear). The kind of dependence in question must\nalso be distinguished from any kind of logical dependence,\nbecause logical relations, strictly speaking, cannot obtain between\nconcrete objects, nor between abstract objects that are not\npropositional in nature. We should also distinguish ontological\ndependence, broadly conceived, from what is usually considered a\nstricter type of metaphysical dependence, namely metaphysical\ngrounding. The link between ontological dependence and\nmetaphysical grounding (or simply \u201cmetaphysical\ndependence\u201d, as it is sometimes called, see Rosen 2010 and the\nseparate entry on\n metaphysical grounding;\n see also Trogdon 2013 for discussion) will be discussed below, but\nthis entry concerns a somewhat broader family of relations of\ndependence. The notion of ontological independence is also\nimportant, and it is often used to describe the idea that something is\nfundamental. This idea as well will be discussed below (but\nsee also the separate entry on\n fundamentality).\n\nWhile much of the early work on ontological dependence was done\nprimarily in a setting where dependence was thought to be an\ninherently modal notion (e.g., Simons 1987), the recent trend\nin hyperintensional metaphysics (see Nolan 2014) has had an\nenormous impact for discussion surrounding dependence. The thought\nhere is that we need more fine-grained tools than mere necessary\nequivalence: two statements can apply to the very same entities across\nall possible worlds but not be equivalent. Here, the notion of\nessence is often invoked, and many would now regard the\nultimate basis of dependence (and indeed of modality itself) to be\nessence (see Fine 1994a, Lowe 1998, Correia 2005, and Koslicki 2012).\nFinally, it is entirely possible to deny both approaches and regard\nthe notion of ontological dependence itself as a primitive (see\nThomasson 1998: Ch. 2 and Barnes 2012: 879). Some would regard the\nnotions of metaphysical grounding or fundamentality to be similarly\nprimitive (see Fine 2012, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005, Rosen 2010, Schaffer\n2009, and Wilson 2014). Primitivism does not mean that the notion is\nmysterious or obscure, as we can still illuminate it, e.g., by\ndescribing its instances. But it does mean that the notion is\nunanalyzable.\n\nIn what follows, the discussion will roughly follow the historical\ndevelopment, starting with the attempts to give a modal-existential\nanalysis of ontological dependence in\n \u00a72.\n As we will see in\n \u00a72.2,\n these attempts do have some serious shortcomings, even if they can be\nof use especially in certain restricted contexts. In\n \u00a73,\n we see that there are important cases where a more fine-grained,\nasymmetric notion of explanatory dependence seems warranted.\nWe will then proceed to the essentialist analysis of dependence in\n \u00a74,\n a discussion of the relationship between metaphysical grounding and\ndependence in\n \u00a75,\n finishing with a brief discussion of various other connections and\napplications in\n \u00a76.\n\nTo get us started, we may consider a few simplified examples. It is\nnot uncommon to see the notion of ontological dependence used in a\nrather coarse-grained manner, given that it encompasses a family of\nrelations. For instance, we often see claims such as:\n\n(1)\n\u201cSets ontologically depend on their members.\u201d\n(2)\n\u201cElectricity ontologically depends on electrons.\u201d\n(3)\n\u201cSocrates does not ontologically depend on singleton\nSocrates.\u201d\n\n\nWhile all of the above no doubt express some important type of\ndependence relationship, there are also important differences between\nthem. (1) may be understood as stating that a set {x, y,\nz} could not exist if its members, namely x, y,\nz, did not exist. One way to analyze the type of dependence in\nquestion is as rigid existential dependence, to be clarified\nin a moment. Another sense of dependence that could be at work in (1)\nis identity-dependence, but we will return to this later on.\nIn (2), we seem to have in mind a more general kind of dependence:\nthere could not be electricity, now or ever, if there were no\nelectrons. So the existence of electricity depends on the existence of\na very specific kind of particle, the electron. This second type of\ndependence is also existential, but to separate it from the rigid\ndependence in (1), we may call it generic existential\ndependence. (3) is a famous case borrowed from Fine (1994a,\n1994b). Singleton Socrates, expressed by \u201c{Socrates}\u201d, is\nthe set containing Socrates as its sole member. From (1) we see that\nthe set itself plausibly depends on Socrates, but since the set\nnecessarily exists when Socrates does, the dependence between them\nwould seem to be symmetric. However, (3) captures the very\nplausible idea that it is not any part of the essence or\nidentity of Socrates that it should belong to {Socrates}. So,\n(3) must refer to some form of essential dependence (or lack\nthereof in this case).\n\nWe will provide a more detailed analysis of these examples below, but\nwe can already see that a family of\u2014sometimes\ncompeting\u2014notions is beginning to emerge. However, we should\nformulate each notion somewhat more precisely. The first thing to note\nin defining ontological dependence is the modal-existential\nelement in dependence claims. For instance, we\u2019ve said that a\nset cannot exist unless its members do. So there is a sense\nin which the existence of a set necessitates the existence of\nits members. Indeed, it is common to talk about, e.g., rigid\nexistential necessitation as synonymous with rigid existential\ndependence. Typically, statements of ontological dependence are\nthought to refer to metaphysical modality (rather than, say,\nconceptual or logical modality), primarily because they concern\nmatters that are broader than just conceptual or logical. For\ninstance, substances are often considered to be entities that\ndo not depend, in a distinctively metaphysical sense, for\ntheir existence upon anything else (see Lowe 1998: Ch. 6). We can see\nthis already in Descartes, who asserts that\n\n\nby substance we can understand nothing other than a thing\nwhich exists in such a way as to depend on no other thing for its\nexistence. (The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: vol. I,\np. 210)\n\n\nThe idea of ontological dependence goes back further than Descartes\nthough, at least to Aristotle (see Corkum 2008, Koslicki 2013, and\nPeramatzis 2011), and it appears throughout the history of philosophy.\nFor instance, there is a notion of dependence operative in the\nphilosophy of John Duns Scotus, who uses it in his proof of the\nexistence of God (see the separate entry on\n John Duns Scotus,\n \u00a72.2 for details). Later, precursors to the contemporary work on\nontological dependence can be found in the work of Franz Brentano and\nEdmund Husserl; in particular, Husserl\u2019s work on the dependence\nbetween wholes and parts (for discussion, see Simons 1982 and\nJohansson 2004: Ch. 9).\n\nFinally, there are also those who are sceptical about the metaphysical\nimport of notions of ontological dependence. There are several reasons\nwhy one might consider ontological dependence relations to be\nunintelligible or unhelpful; for instance, one might think that they\nconflate other relations or that they are extraneous additions to\nbeing. However, it is commonly held among those working with\nontological dependence that these dependence relations, being\nformal ontological relations, are not additional elements of\nbeing (cf. Lowe 2006: Ch. 3). Such relations are typically thought to\nbe internal (see Armstrong 1978: 85, who defines two things\nto be internally related if and only if there exist properties of them\nwhich logically necessitate that the relation holds; for further\ndiscussion on internal and external relations, see the separate entry\non\n relations).\n Still, there is at least an ideological cost in some approaches to\nontological dependence and hence some would prefer a\ndeflationary approach. According to this type of approach, we\nmay be able to account for supposed ontological dependence relations\nin terms of a \u201ccluster\u201d of modal and mereological\nrelations (for a defense of this type of approach, see Kovacs\n2018).\n2. The Modal-Existential Analysis of Dependence\n\nIn this section we will focus on the modal-existential analysis of\nontological dependence, which used to be the dominant approach. But\neven if this approach has fallen out of fashion, it is important to\nsee why that is the case and we cannot do that without understanding\nthe approach. Moreover, there are those who do not wish to commit to\nthe ontologically heavyweight notion of essence, but who nevertheless\nemploy the notion of ontological dependence (e.g., trope bundle\ntheorists, such as Kein\u00e4nen, Keskinen, & Hakkarainen 2019).\nWe will discuss some of the problems that this account faces in\n \u00a72.2\n and return to the essentialist analysis in\n \u00a74.\n2.1 The Modal-Existential Analysis\n\nLet us start from\n (1)\n in the previous section; how should this relationship between sets\nand their members be defined according to the modal-existential\nanalysis? An obvious proposal would be to say, quite simply:\n\n(EDR)\nx dependsR for its existence upon y\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nThe subscript \u201cR\u201d is used here because it seems\nappropriate to call this species of existential dependence of one\nobject upon another rigid existential dependence. Why\n\u201crigid\u201d? Because there is no flexibility here: the\nexistence of a given x requires the existence of that very\ny. It could not be something a little bit like y,\nsomething falling roughly in the same category, for instance; it\nmust be y. The definiens in (EDR) is\nequivalent to \u201cNecessarily, if x exists, then y\nexists\u201d, so that according to (EDR) the existential\ndependenceR of x upon y amounts to the\nstrict implication of y\u2019s existence by\nx\u2019s existence. We have mentioned one example of rigid\nexistential dependence, namely, sets ontologically depending on their\nmembers (more precisely, a set depends rigidly on the very members it\nhas, i.e., any change in a set\u2019s members will change the set\nitself). Another, although more controversial, example is a particular\nperson depending for her existence on her parents, or, more precisely,\non the particular sperm and egg that she originates from. This example\nis of course related to the essentiality of origin (as\ndiscussed in Kripke 1980).\n\nWe can express (EDR) in a more compact manner by resorting to further\nformalization (the following notation is used, e.g., in Correia 2008).\nWe can use the sentential operator \u201c\\(\\square\\)\u201d for\nmetaphysical necessity, the one-place predicate \u201cE\u201d\nfor existence, and the two-place sentential operator\n\u201c\u2192\u201d for material implication. Following this\nnotation, we can formalize rigid existential dependence as follows:\n\u201c\\(\\square(Ex \\rightarrow Ey)\\)\u201d, which can be read as\n\u201cx rigidly depends for its existence on y\u201d,\nor alternatively \u201cx rigidly necessitates y\u201d.\nNote that (EDR), somewhat controversially, implies that everything\ndependsR for its existence upon itself. It would,\nof course, be easy enough to modify (EDR)\u2019s definiens\nto read \u201cy is not identical with x and,\nnecessarily, x exists only if y exists\u201d, but that\nwould have the disadvantage of precluding anything from\ndependingR for its existence upon itself.\n\nWe can quite naturally contrast rigid existential dependence\nas defined by (EDR) with what might appropriately be called\nnon-rigid existential dependence, defined as follows:\n\n(EDN)\n x dependsN for its existence upon the F\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if the F\nexists.\n\n\nThe thought here is that\u2014to use the language of \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d\u2014\u201cthe F\u201d in any instance of\n(EDN) might well denote different entities in different\npossible worlds. So, for example, it might be said that a material\nobject x dependsN for its existence upon the\nmatter composing x, even though it might have been\ncomposed of different matter, because in every possible world in which\nx exists the matter composing x in that world\nexists in that world.\n\nOn the face of it, (EDR) seems to capture precisely one strongly\nintuitive notion of existential dependence; or more accurately, one\ndirection of that notion. The intuitive idea behind this notion is\nthat if y does not exist, then the dependent entity x\ndoes not exist. For example, when it is said that a particular event,\nsuch as the assassination of Caesar, depends for its existence upon\nCaesar, (EDR) seems to explicate this appropriately in terms of the\nfact that the assassination could not have existed if Caesar had not\nexisted to be assassinated. Some other assassination, we may\nsuppose, could have existed at that very time and place, but for\nthat very assassination to have existed, Caesar himself had\nto exist.\n\nHowever, there are clearly cases in which (EDR) fails to capture the\nintuitive sense of dependence at hand. Consider a living organism. A\nliving organism would appear to depend for its existence upon its\nparts, such as cells. But we also know that a living organism may\nsurvive a change of any of its cells, provided that the change is\neffected in a non-disruptive manner. It is true, of course, that such\nan organism must have parts such as cells if it is to exist,\nbut which objects those parts are is inessential\u2014and\nconsequently it is not the case that it depends for its existence, in\nthe sense defined by (EDR), upon any one of those parts. But it is\npossible to define another sense of existential dependence in\nwhich it is true to say that a composite object depends for\nits existence upon its proper parts; a generic notion of\nexistential dependence, defined as follows:\n\n(EDG)\n x dependsG for its existence upon Fs\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if some F\nexists.\n\n\nComposite objects are existentially dependent objects in the sense of\n(EDG), since they require the existence of proper parts (set F\nas \u201cproper part of x\u201d in (EDG)). Using the previous\nformal notation, we could express (EDG) as \u201c\\(\\square(Ex\n\\rightarrow \\exists Fy)\\)\u201d. Here we have added the existential\nquantifier \u201c\u2203\u201d as well as the general term\n\u201cF\u201d to express the thought that \u201cx\ngenerically depends for its existence on something being an\nF\u201d, or alternatively \u201cx generically\nnecessitates F\u201d. The important difference between the\nrigid and the generic cases is that (EDR) refers to a specific object\nwhereas (EDG) only requires that at least some Fs exist.\nAnother example, mentioned earlier, where (EDG) would seem to capture\nthe correct sense of dependence is\n (2),\n \u201cElectricity ontologically depends on electrons\u201d. More\nprecisely, we could say that electricity dependsG for its\nexistence upon electrons.\n\nWe would now have the tools to formalize most of the mentioned\nexamples, but note that there are cases where further tools are\nrequired. Consider:\n\n(4)\n\u201cChildren ontologically depend on their parents.\u201d\n\n\nOn the face of it, what we mean in (4) is that if parents x and\ny had not existed, then their child z could not have\ncome into existence. This looks like a case of rigid existential\ndependence, but it is clear that once z has been born,\nher parents can go out of existence without any effect on her own\nexistence. At that point, there is only past rigid\nexistential dependence. For cases such as this, we would require\ntemporally relativized versions of\n (EDN)\n and\n (EDG),\n but we will omit these complications here (see Thomasson 1998:\n24\u201334 and Correia 2005, 2008 for some versions of temporally\nrelativized ontological dependence).\n\nNote, incidentally, that generic existential dependence as\ndefined by (EDG) above is very close to a pluralized form of\nnon-rigid existential dependence, as defined by (EDN). We\ncould call this plural non-rigid existential dependence,\ndefinable as follows:\n\n(EDP)\n x dependsP for its existence upon the Fs\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if the Fs\nexist.\n\n\nThe similarity between\n (EDG)\n and\n (EDN)\n is apparent: saying\u2014for example\u2014that a composite object\nx dependsG for its existence upon proper parts of\nx is very close indeed to saying that x\ndependsP for its existence upon the existence of\nthe very kinds of proper parts that x\nhas.\n2.2 Some Problems for the Modal-Existential Analysis\n\nAn important group of problems for the modal-existential analysis of\nontological dependence emerges from essential properties (at least if\nthey are considered as distinct from modal properties, as argued in\nFine 1994a). What could be a plausible example of an essential\nproperty of an individual object, say, Socrates? Let us assume that\nproperties are to be conceived of as property instances, such\nas the particular redness of a certain apple. Of course, an apple can\nchange its color, so that this is not an example of an\nessential property of the apple. But what about\u2014in the\ncase of Socrates\u2014his humanity (as it were, his\nparticular being human)? Certainly, if there is such a thing\nas the particular humanity of Socrates, he cannot lose it without\nceasing to exist. Perhaps we can deny that Socrates\u2019s particular\nhumanity is anything distinct from Socrates himself: after\nall, its existence necessarily coincides with his. Properties are\ncommonly said to depend for their existence upon the entities that\npossess them. One might propose to state this in the form of a\nprinciple, with the help of\n (EDR),\n as follows:\n\n(PROP-DEP)\nIf x is a property and y is an entity possessing\nx, then x dependsR for its existence upon\ny.\n\n\nNow, substituting the definiens of (EDR) into (PROP-DEP) gives us:\n\n(PROP-NEC)\n If x is a property and y is an entity possessing\nx, then, necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nNote that (PROP-NEC) is not intended to apply to properties understood\nas universals, but only to particularized properties (otherwise\nvariously known as property instances, individual accidents, tropes,\nor modes). These are items exactly like the particular redness of a\nparticular apple mentioned above, conceived of as an object distinct\nfrom the redness of any other apple, no matter how well\nmatched in color to the first. On this interpretation, (PROP-NEC) has\nsome plausibility, complying as it does with the intuition that\nparticularized properties cannot \u201cmigrate\u201d from one object\nto another. (Actually, (PROP-NEC) itself does not quite imply this,\nalthough it does imply that a particularized property cannot migrate\nfrom one object to another when the first object ceases to exist.\nHere, the friend of an essentialist analysis of dependence has some\nfurther options, i.e., one could say that it is part of the nature or\nessence of a particularized property to be instantiated by the very\nobject that it is instantiated by. But we will leave this aside for\nnow.)\n\nA line of argument that could be developed on this basis suggests that\nif indeed there are such things as essential particularized properties\nthat are \u201cpossessed\u201d by composite objects, then they are\nin fact to be identified with those objects. But it would be\nvery problematic, quite generally, to argue that wherever items\nx and y are mutually existentially dependent as defined\nby\n (EDR),\n they are identical. For instance, consider the relationship between\nSocrates and the temporally extended event or process that was his\nlife. Clearly, in terms of (EDR), Socrates\u2019s life\ndependsR for its existence upon Socrates\u2014but so,\nplausibly, does his existence upon it: it is, for Socrates, what we\nmight call an inalienable event. And yet there are things\ntrue of the life of Socrates that are not true of him and vice\nversa (for example, that it was so many years long, and that he\nweighed so many pounds)\u2014so there is no question of their being\nidentical. Even more strikingly, if we assume that numbers are\nnecessary existents, and hence mutually existentially dependent, this\nline of thought would seem to entail that any two numbers are\nidentical!\n\nBut it could be disputed whether Socrates is existentially\ndependentR upon his life\u2014whether he\nnecessarily would not have existed if it had not\u2014for it\nmay be urged that he might have had or led a different life.\nNow, it is true enough that his life might have been\nqualitatively different in many ways, but what is currently\nat issue is whether he might have had a numerically different\nlife\u2014and it is hard, perhaps, to see how he could. For if it is\naccepted that lives dependR for their existence\nupon the persons whose lives they are, then, necessarily,\nx\u2019s life exists only if x exists. Suppose, for the\nsake of argument, that Socrates could have had a numerically different\nlife: then it would still have been a life which could only have been\nSocrates\u2019s\u2014no one other than Socrates could have had that\n\u201cother\u201d life. But then what could underpin the supposition\nthat it is indeed a life \u201cother\u201d than the life he actually\nhad (except qualitatively)? Other possible worlds clearly do contain\nlives that do not exist in the actual world, insofar as they contain\npeople who do not exist in the actual world: but there seem\nto be no strong grounds to suppose that they do so other than for that\nreason. It seems thus that there are certain difficult questions which\nthe modal-existential analysis may not fully address, at least not in\nthe form that we have presented it until now. We will continue to\ndiscuss these issues in\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74.\n3. Asymmetrical Existential Dependence\n\nWhere does the above analysis of existential dependence lead us? The\ncase of Socrates\u2019s life demonstrates that\n (EDR)\n permits the possibility of mutual existential\ndependenceR between non-identical things. But this\nimplication does not seem to be acceptable in every context and indeed\nsymmetric dependence more generally is a controversial issue (see\nBarnes 2018 for discussion). Take, again, the relationship between\nSocrates and his life. According to (EDR), Socrates is quite as much\nexistentially dependentR upon his life as his life is upon\nhim. And yet there is a strong intuition that, in another and perhaps\nmore important sense, Socrates\u2019s life is the truly\ndependent object here, while Socrates is, in some sense, an\nindependent existent. We might say that Socrates\u2019s life\nexists only because Socrates does, whereas it would be\nputting the cart before the horse to say that Socrates exists\nbecause his life does. Now, it appears that the conjunction\n\u201cbecause\u201d must be asymmetrical, because it\nexpresses an explanatory relationship and explanation is\nasymmetrical. Plausibly, two distinct states of affairs cannot\nexplain each other. There may, quite conceivably, be\nself-explanatory states of affairs, so we should only want to\nurge that non-identical states of affairs cannot be mutually\nexplanatory. Technically, this means that we should strictly describe\nexplanation as an \u201cantisymmetric\u201d rather than as an\nasymmetric relation. The asymmetry of explanation is, of course,\nintimately related to the unacceptability of circular\narguments. It is also closely linked to recent discussions\nregarding metaphysical grounding, to which we will return\nlater, in\n \u00a75.\n\nOne upshot of all this is that, for the purpose of defining\nontologically independent existents (if there are any), (EDR)\nshould be replaced, at least to a first approximation, by something\nlike:\n\n(EDX)\n x dependsX for its existence upon y\n=df Necessarily, x exists only because y\nexists.\n\n\nWe use the subscript \u201cX\u201d because, in line with foregoing\nremarks, it seems appropriate to call this species of ontological\ndependence eXplanatory existential dependence. (We shall need\nthe subscript \u201cE\u201d for another use later.) Here it is\nimportant to note that the presence of the word \u201conly\u201d in\n(EDX)\u2019s definiens should not be understood as implying\nthat an object x may not dependX for its existence\nupon two (or more) different things, y and z.\nThus the particularized relation of Mary\u2019s loving\nTom\u2014supposing such an object to exist\u2014plausibly exists\nonly because Mary exists, but plausibly also exists\nonly because Tom exists. Furthermore, we may assume that it\nis not an implication of (EDX) that a composite object\ndependsX for its existence upon its proper parts, that is,\nthat it is not the case that it \u201cexists only because\nthey exist\u201d\u2014on the grounds that it could still exist in\nthe absence of those particular parts, provided suitable\nalternative parts were substituted for them. Thus (EDX) is quite\nunlike\n (EDG)\n in its implications for part-whole dependence relations, as far as\ncomposite objects are concerned. For the same reason, we may assume\nthat (EDX) does not imply that an \u201cAristotelian\u201d universal\ndependsX for its existence upon its particular exemplars.\nIndeed, we may take it that the definiens of (EDX) entails\nthe definiens of\n (EDR)\u2014although\n not vice versa, of course\u2014so that the following is a\nprinciple that one could accept:\n\n(B-NEC)\nIf, necessarily, x exists only because y\nexists, then, necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nHowever, despite these clarifications, it must be conceded that the\nlocution \u201cx exists only because y exists\u201d is\nhardly very perspicuous, either as to its logical form or as to its\nexact meaning. Moreover, precisely because we have introduced the\nconjunction \u201cbecause\u201d as an explanatory\nconjunction, it may be felt that it is not well-suited to the\nontological role now being devised for it (for one of the many recent\nattempts to specify the explanatory role of \u201cbecause\u201d, see\ndeRosset 2013). There are perhaps two sources of worry here: first,\nthat this approach invites a confusion between metaphysics and\nepistemology; and secondly (but relatedly) that contexts governed by\nthe conjunction \u201cbecause\u201d are opaque (in the\ntechnical sense of the term, in which it implies the non-applicability\nof Leibniz\u2019s Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles).\n\nSome of these worries can perhaps be allayed by resorting to the\nrecent work on metaphysical grounding, which presents a much more\nrigorous analysis of non-causal, metaphysical explanation of this type\n(see especially the articles in Correia & Schnieder (eds.) 2012a).\nThis is not to take any stand on the relationship between grounding\nand metaphysical explanation (see \u00a74 of the separate entry on\n metaphysical grounding),\n but only to note that the discussion surrounding explanatory\ndependence has progressed, in part, independently of the wider\nconsiderations surrounding ontological dependence. So we should\nperhaps accept that\n (EDX)\n as it stands does not really constitute a satisfactory definition of\na species of existential dependence, conceived as an objective\nmetaphysical relation between entities, because it is insufficiently\nperspicuous. In any case, the fact that (B-NEC) but not its\nconverse holds some appeal indicates that what we should be trying to\nframe is a perspicuous definition of a species of ontological\ndependence that is a relation between x and y\nstronger than (entailing but not entailed by)\n\u201cnecessarily, x exists only if y exists\u201d.\nThis should moreover be (for reasons discussed earlier) an\nasymmetrical relation\u2014or, more accurately, an\nantisymmetric relation, that is, a relation \\(\\Rrel\\) such\nthat if \\(x\\Rrel y\\) and \\(y\\Rrel x\\), then \\(x = y\\). This is to\nallow that in principle an object may, in the anticipated sense,\ndepend ontologically upon itself, controversial as this may\nbe (it is nevertheless a position that is of at least historical\ninterest, e.g., because of the potential special case of God depending\non herself).\n\nAs we shall see in a moment, a relation that may be of some assistance\nin spelling out the relevant sense of dependence is the relation of\nidentity-dependence, to be explained below. But first we\nshould digress for a moment to note that the one-sided\nholding of the relation defined by\n (EDR)\n is unlikely to do the job. According to this suggestion, we have:\n\n(EDA)\n x dependsA for its existence upon y\n=df\n\n(i)\n necessarily, x exists only if y exists and \n(ii)\n it is not the case that, necessarily, y exists\nonly if x exists.\n \n\n\nNotice that the relation thus defined is asymmetric (rather\nthan antisymmetric): it doesn\u2019t permit any object to be\nexistentially dependent upon itself. Indeed, we have chosen\nto use the subscript \u201cA\u201d here because the relation in\nquestion may aptly be called asymmetrical rigid existential\ndependence. One might think that this is at it should be, as on the\nface of it the idea of something existentially depending on itself\nappears very strange. There is of course an obvious theological\ncandidate that may violate this condition, namely God, so perhaps we\nshould not rule out the possibility outright. But there may be\nslightly less controversial candidates as well, for it could be\nsuggested that there are fundamental entities that\nexistentially depend on themselves (rather than on nothing). At any\nrate, if anything of the sort is possible, we better not rule it out\nby definition, as (EDA) does.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, an appeal to (EDA) does not seem to help to\nresolve the difficulty raised by the example of Socrates\u2019s life.\nFor neither Socrates nor his life is existentially\ndependentA on the other, since in neither case is clause\n(ii) of (EDA) satisfied. But we were looking for a sense of\n\u201contologically dependent\u201d in which it is true to\nsay that Socrates\u2019s life is ontologically dependent upon\nhim, but not vice versa.\n4. Essential Dependence and Identity-Dependence\n4.1 Why Essential Dependence?\n\nUntil quite recently, it was common to think that ontological\ndependence can be fully characterized in modal-existential terms, as\nwe have seen above. One obvious reason for this is that if one adopts\nthe usual \u201cmodalist\u201d analysis of essence,\nessential dependence will collapse into a form of modal-existential\ndependence (one classic defense of the \u201cmodalist\u201d analysis\nis Marcus 1967). But it seems clear already starting from Aristotle\nthat there is an alternative way to formulate ontological dependence\nif essence is not analyzed in modal terms (as Fine 1994a and\nespecially those working in the \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d\ntradition would have it). However, this is not to suggest that\nAristotle did not rely on the modal-existential notion of ontological\ndependence. Rather, there are reasons to think that Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of dependence encompasses both the\nmodal-existential notion and the essentialist notion to be described\nbelow (for historical details and further discussion, see Corkum 2008,\nKoslicki 2013, and Peramatzis 2011).\n\nOne motivation for developing a non-modal conception of\nontological dependence is that the modal-existential analysis appears\nto be too coarse-grained for some cases. We have already discussed\nsome of these cases, but the most well-known examples have been made\nfamous by Fine (e.g., 1994b). Consider, for instance, what the\nmodal-existential account entails in the case of necessary existents.\nTake Socrates and the number 2, for example. Given that numbers\nnecessarily exist, it is necessarily the case that 2 exists if\nSocrates does. But presumably we do not want to say that Socrates\ndepends upon the number 2, or indeed on most necessary existents that\nyou might put in the place of 2. So the modal-existential account\nmakes everything depend upon every necessary existent, which seems\nlike the wrong result.\n\nAdmittedly, those who defend a modal-existential analysis of\nontological dependence could insist that it applies only to\ncontingent objects (cf. Simons 1987: 295). Simons makes this\ntype of qualification by focusing on concrete entities, hence\nexcluding necessary existents by definition; he also excludes\nself-dependence. Simons calls the resulting notion of dependence\nweak rigid dependence, but a stronger notion, strong\nrigid dependence (Simons 1987: 303) is also defined\u2014the\nlatter is a special case of the former. One example of weak rigid\ndependence as defined by Simons would be a particular water molecule\ndepending for its existence on a particular oxygen atom. In the case\nof strong rigid dependence, the dependent object cannot be a proper\npart of the object it depends upon. So object x is strongly\nrigidly dependent on object y if x depends for its\nexistence on y and y is not a proper part of x.\nOne example of strong rigid dependence defined thus would be a trope\n(or mode) depending for its existence on a substance. In addition to\nthese rigid notions, Simons defines corresponding notions of (weak and\nstrong) generic dependence.\n\nWhile it is possible to avoid some of the challenges raised for the\nmodal-existential account with these qualifications, they do\nnevertheless call for an alternative, more fine-grained account of\nontological dependence that could also be applied to necessary\nexistents. As last resort, a proponent of the modal-existential\naccount who does not wish to buy into essentialist ontology could\nsimply bite the bullet and insist that every contingent entity\ndoes rigidly depend for its existence on necessary existents.\nOne reason to do so would be the ability to get by with a sparser\nbattery of formal ontological tools\u2014a consideration motivated by\nparsimony.\n\nThe modal-existential analysis of ontological dependence can thus be\ndeveloped further, and it can perhaps overcome some of the problems\nthat were pointed out earlier. But there are areas where a more\nfine-grained notion would seem to be required and there is also a\nhistorical precedent (e.g., in Aristotle) for such a notion. It should\nbe noted though that much of the contemporary literature in defense of\na non-modal, fine-grained analysis (such as Fine 1994b and Koslicki\n2012), operates in a \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d framework which\ntypically assumes some \u201cnon-modalist\u201d version of\nessentialism. Accordingly, there is an obvious rift between the\nmodal-existential analysis and the essentialist analysis\u2014one\nthat we cannot fully bridge here. In any case, it is good to keep in\nmind that the notion of ontological dependence itself, when used as a\ntool to formulate the commitments of a specific theory, does not\nimmediately force one to make a commitment in this regard, even though\nsome of its applications may entail such a commitment.\n4.2 Identity-Dependence\n\nA point of entry to the idea that there are notions of dependence not\nanalyzable in terms of the modal-existential account\u2014and hence a\nmotivation to pursue a non-modal analysis of dependence\naltogether\u2014are cases that do not seem to involve a requirement\nfor existence at all. Indeed, as we already saw in the case\nof\n (3),\n \u201cSocrates does not ontologically depend on singleton\nSocrates\u201d, it seems that something beyond mere existential\nindependence is being expressed. Instead, one might say that singleton\nSocrates does not have anything to do with the identity or\nessence of Socrates, and it is this lack of\nidentity-dependence between Socrates and {Socrates} that we\nwish to express with (3). In other words, being a member of singleton\nSocrates is not an essential property of Socrates. Recall\nthat a similar issue seemed to arise with regard to the possibility of\ncomposite objects having essential proper parts. We will now\nconsider a more systematic method for dealing with cases of dependence\ninvolving the essences or essential properties of objects.\n\nIt is not quite straight-forward to define essential dependence,\nalthough a formal definition will be given below. Before that, we\nought to get a better picture of what it means to say that an object\ndepends upon something for its identity, that is, we should\nclarify the relation of identity-dependence. Note that the\nnotion of \u201cidentity\u201d at play here is not the one\nsymbolized with the \u201cequals\u201d sign, i.e., \u201c=\u201d.\nRather, we mean \u201cidentity\u201d in the sense of what a\nthing is, or which thing of a certain kind a thing is\n(compare this with Aristotle\u2019s to ti esti, \u201cthe\nwhat it is\u201d, see \u00a77 of the separate entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n Informally speaking, to say that the identity of x depends on\nthe identity of y\u2014or, more briefly, that x depends\nfor its identity upon y\u2014is to say that which\nthing of its kind y is fixes (or at least helps to fix)\nwhich thing of its kind x is. By \u201cfixes\u201d\nin this context is meant metaphysically determines. For\ninstance, then, the identity of a set is fixed by the\nidentities of its members, as was hinted already in\n \u00a71.\n Likewise, the identity of an assassination is (at least\npartially) fixed by the identity of the person assassinated. These\nrelationships of identity-dependence are direct consequences of the\nidentity-criteria governing the kinds of which the items thus related\nare instances. (For further discussion on identity-criteria and\nidentity-dependence, see Lowe 1989, 2009: Ch. 2, and 2012.)\n\nOne way to attempt to precisify the notion of essence is to note that\nwe are here concerned with identity in the sense of\nindividuality rather than the relation of identity.\nIn other words, identity-dependence expresses the determination of the\nindividuality of objects in terms of the individuality of other\nobjects. Thus, the identity-dependence of a set upon its members could\nbe regarded as a consequence of the fact that the Axiom of\nExtensionality functions as the criterion of identity for sets. The\nset\u2019s members determine the individuality of the set\u2014they\nindividuate the set. Notice, here, that we allow that\nx may be said to depend for its identity upon y even in\ncases in which the identity of y alone does not\nsuffice to fix the identity of x. So, for example, a set with\ntwo or more members depends for its identity upon each of\nthem, although its identity is only completely fixed by the\nidentities of all of them.\n\nAnother way to specify the notion of essence being used is to resort\nto Fine\u2019s (1994b, 1995) distinction between\nconstitutive and consequential essence:\n\n\nA property belongs to the constitutive essence of an object\nif it is not had in virtue of being a logical consequence of some more\nbasic essential properties; and a property might be said to belong to\nthe consequential essence of an object if it is a logical\nconsequence of properties that belong to the constitutive essence.\n(Fine 1994b: 276)\n\n\nAs Fine then goes on to note, the property of singleton Socrates,\nnamely, containing Socrates as a sole member, will presumably be part\nof the constitutive essence of {Socrates}. In contrast, the property\nof containing some member or another is only part of its consequential\nessence. It is evident that in cases of essential and\nidentity-dependence, we are typically interested in the constitutive\nnotion of essence, because it is presumably also a part of the\nconsequentialist essence of Socrates that 2 = 2. So, using the\nconsequentialist notion of essence to define essential and\nidentity-dependence would quickly lead to problems not unlike the ones\nfaced by the modal-existential account. Accordingly, in what follows,\nthe various definitions should in the first instance be understood to\nconcern the constitutive essence. But the problem that remains is that\nthe distinction between constitutive and consequential essence itself\nis not always easy to make and it is inevitable that there will be\nsome controversial cases (for discussion, see Fine 1994b). The\nexamples used to illustrate the various forms of essential dependence\nshould thus be taken with a grain of salt, as it is often not entirely\nclear what should be included in the constitutive essence of an\nentity. In any case, provided that this distinction can be made, the\nfriend of the essentialist analysis of dependence has a clear\nadvantage, given that they are able to express a broader range of\ndependence claims with the help of this distinction.\n\nNow, although we have not yet presented a formal definition of\nidentity-dependence, it might well seem that a consequence of any such\ndefinition should be the following principle:\n\n(ID-NEC)\n If x depends for its identity upon y, then there is\na function f such that x is necessarily identical with\nf(y).\n\n\n(Note: \u201cf(y)\u201d here may be pronounced\n\u201cthe f of y\u201d.) For example: if we say that\nthe identity of a marriage depends on the identities of the two people\nbeing married, if x is a marriage and y and z are\nthe two people in question, (ID-NEC) is satisfied in respect of\nx and y in virtue of the fact that x is\nnecessarily identical with the marriage of y with\nz\u2014so that in this case the required function is the\nmarriage with z function from persons to events. (We\nhere ignore the complications created by the fact that, under some\nlegal systems, the same two persons may be married to one another more\nthan once.) However, (ID-NEC) turns out to be unsatisfactory as a\ndefinition, because it can be regarded as trivially true, given\nstandard set theory, that any x and y that may be\nconnected with a function will satisfy the consequent of (ID-NEC). So\nwe better find a more satisfactory definition of\nidentity-dependence.\n\nEvidently, it would not do simply to replace the conditional\nconnective in (ID-NEC) with a biconditional connective and\nthence attempt to turn it into a definition of\nidentity-dependence, unless at the same time one could impose some\nsuitable restriction on the kind of function involved. One possibility\nwould be to exclude any function f which is not such that it is\npart of the essence of x that it is the f of\ny. But since it would appear strange to say that essences quite\ngenerally involve anything about functions, we might be\nbetter off with a definition using an appropriate yet to be specified\nplace-holder relation that would do the same job instead, arriving at\nthe following definition of identity-dependence:\n\n(ID)\n x depends for its identity upon y =df\nThere is a relation \u201cR\u201d such that it is part of the\nessence of x that x is related by R to\ny.\n\n\nWe can exemplify (ID) by letting x be {z} and y\nbe z, in which case we have, as is intuitively correct, that\n{z} depends for its identity upon z, because there is a\nrelation\u2014namely, \u201cbeing a member of the singleton\nset\u201d (also known as the unit set function)\u2014such\nthat it is part of the essence of {z} that it is the singleton\nset of z. Accordingly, we may interpret the relation R\nmore precisely on a case by case basis.\n\nBuilding on this example, we can see that x is necessarily\nidentical with the sole member of {x} and hence we can arrive\nat a principle not unlike (ID-NEC). However, even though x is\nnecessarily identical with the sole member of {x}, it is, once\nagain, plausibly not part of the essence of x that\nx is the sole member of {x} (cf. Fine 1994a: 4\u20135;\nsee also Fine 1994b for a related discussion of the notion of essence\nand essential dependence).\n\nBut, of course, for the foregoing strategy to work and thus for (ID)\nto be fully vindicated, a perspicuous account of the notion of\n\u201cessence\u201d would be required\u2014and that is a large task\nwhich cannot be undertaken here. However, various attempts to\nconstruct such an account have been made, for instance by Fine (1994a)\nand Lowe (2008). In this sense, a thing\u2019s essence may be said to\nconstitute its identity, when one uses the word\n\u201cidentity\u201d in this distinctive manner to speak of a\nthing\u2019s identity, rather than using it to speak of the\nidentity relation. Seen in this light, identity-dependence as\ndefined by (ID) is simply a species of essential dependence,\nthat is, a way in which the essence of a certain thing is determined\nby a relation in which it stands to another thing.\n\nAlthough the above account of identity-dependence is not entirely\nuncontroversial, there are some interesting applications of it in the\nliterature. One of these applications concerns a version of Ontic\nStructural Realism (OSR, see Ladyman 1998), which claims that objects\ndepend for their identities on the structures to which they belong\n(ID-OSR) (see French 2010 for one version, and see Lowe 2012 and\nO\u2019Conaill 2014 for further discussion of OSR and\ndependence).\n\nAt this point, two principles concerning identity-dependence, as\ndefined by\n (ID),\n may be proposed. First:\n\n(ID-EX)\n If x depends for its identity upon y, then,\nnecessarily, x exists only if y exists.\n\n\nAnd second:\n\n(ID-NEX)\n If x is not identical with y and x\ndepends for its identity upon y, then y does\nnot depend for its identity upon x.\n\n\nAn immediate implication of (ID-EX) in conjunction with\n (EDR)\n is that if x depends for its identity upon y, then\nx is rigidly existentially dependent upon y\n(although not necessarily vice versa, of course). These two\nprinciples are, it seems, quite plausible. As for (ID-EX): surely,\nx cannot exist unless everything upon which x\u2019s\nidentity depends also exists. Thus an assassination cannot exist\nunless the person assassinated exists, and a set cannot exist unless\nits members exist. Indeed, it would seem that we can derive (ID-EX)\nwith the aid of\n (ID).\n For suppose that x depends for its identity upon y.\nThen, by (ID), there is a relation R such that x is\nrelated by R to y. Given, however, that the relevant\nR cannot exist unless y exists\u2014because a relation\ncan obtain only between entities all of which exist\u2014it\nfollows that x likewise cannot exist unless y exists. As\nfor (ID-NEX), this seems to follow from the requirement of\nnon-circularity which is a condition on the adequacy of any\ncriterion of identity. For example, given that unit sets are not to be\nidentified with their members, we cannot say both that the\nidentity of a unit set depends upon the identity of its member\nand that the identity of that member depends upon the\nidentity of that unit set, for this would engender a vicious circle\nwhich would seem to deprive both unit sets and their\nmembers of well-defined identity-conditions.\n\nNote that it may be urged, with some plausibility, that every object\nx trivially depends for its identity upon itself. And,\ncertainly,\n (ID)\n would appear to have this implication, because for any object\nx, there is a relation\u2014namely,\nidentity\u2014such that it is part of the essence of\nx that x is the object identical with x. But we\nmust be very careful to distinguish between the claim that an object\ndepends for its identity upon itself and the claim that an object\ndepends for its identity solely upon itself. For even if the\nformer claim is trivially true of all entities, the latter claim is\ncertainly not. However, this result may be contested when we bear in\nmind the distinction between constitutive and consequential essence,\nbecause one might very well hold that it is no part of the\nconstitutive essence of an entity, at least typically, that it should\nbe identical with itself (we will omit a more detailed discussion\nhere, but see Fine 1994b).\n4.3 Essential Dependence\n\nHaving defined identity-dependence by\n (ID)\n as a species of essential dependence, we are now in a\nposition to identify other species of essential dependence, the most\nobvious being what may aptly be called essential\n(existential) dependence, which can be defined as\nfollows:\n\n(EDE)\n x dependsE for its existence upon y\n=df It is part of the essence of x that x\nexists only if y exists.\n\n\nNote that, whereas\u2014assuming the truth of\n (ID-NEX)\u2014two\n distinct entities cannot be identity-dependent upon each\nother, it very plausibly is possible for each of two\ndistinct entities to dependE for its existence on\nthe other. For example, consider a solid sphere. Let us assume for the\npurposes of this example that the solid sphere is a\nsubstance, a kind of basic, ontologically\nindependent entity (see\n \u00a76.3\n for further discussion). If we think of the top and bottom\n\u201chalves\u201d of a solid sphere as being geometrically\ndefined entities whose boundaries are specified by reference to the\nwhole sphere of which they are equal subdivisions, then it could be\nargued that it is part of the essence of each such hemisphere that it\nexists only if the other does. (These \u201chalves\u201d, it should\nbe emphasized, must not be confused with the portions of matter\n\u201cfilling\u201d them at any given time, and hence should not be\nthought of as \u201cparts\u201d of the sphere of which it is\nmaterially composed.) At the same time, each hemisphere\ndepends for its identity upon the whole sphere\u2014one\nbeing identified as the top half of that sphere and the other as the\nbottom half\u2014whereas the sphere itself does not likewise depend\nfor its identity upon either of these halves, given that we have\nassumed that it is a substance in its own right. This example is\nadmittedly controversial: one could insist that the constitutive\nessence for each hemisphere involves the whole sphere, but not the\nother hemisphere. Moreover, one could also focus on the\nplural or collective essence of the halves, which\nmight help us get around this circularity (on plural/collective\nessence, see Zylstra 2019). Note also that, very plausibly, if\nx dependsE for its existence upon y, then\nx also dependsR for its existence upon y:\nessential existential dependence entails rigid\nexistential dependence\u2014but not, of course, vice\nversa.\n\nWe have seen that (ID) and (EDE) correspond to rigid forms of\nmodal-existential dependence, such as (EDR). But we can also formulate\na generic notion of essential dependence, just like we did in\nthe case of modal-existential dependence. Corresponding to generic\nexistential dependence (EDG), we can formulate generic essential\n(existential) dependence as follows:\n\n(EDEG) \nx dependsEG for its existence upon Fs\n=df It is part of the essence of x that x\nexists only if some F exists.\n\n\nFor instance, if x is a particular water molecule, we may say\nthat it is a part of the essence of that water molecule that it exists\nonly if some atoms of hydrogen and oxygen exist. In other words, water\nmolecules essentially depend for their existence on there being atoms\nof the kind hydrogen and oxygen. It may be helpful to introduce a\ndistinction between individual and general essences\nin this connection. (EDEG) as applied to the case of water certainly\napplies to each and every water molecule rather than just one of them.\nAccordingly, when we speak of the essence of water in this context, we\nare not referring to the individual essence of any particular water\nmolecule, but to the general essence of the natural kind\nwater. (EDEG) concerns what an entity depends upon for its\ngeneral essence (e.g., what makes something count as a water\nmolecule), whereas (EDE) concerns what an entity depends upon for its\nindividual essence (e.g., what makes something the particular water\nmolecule it is, as opposed to any other). (For further discussion of\nthis distinction between individual and general essence, see Lowe\n2008.)\n\nWe can find slightly different formulations of essential dependence in\nthe literature. For instance, on Kathrin Koslicki\u2019s (2012: 190)\nre-construal of Fine\u2019s essentialist account, we get:\n\n(EDC)\n An entity x ontologically depends on an entity (or\nentities), y, just in case y is a constituent (or are\nconstituents) in x\u2019s essence.\n\n\nThis account relies on the notion of constitutive essence,\nwhich is developed in Fine\u2019s work (1994b, 1995). We have already\ndefined this notion above, but a recap may be useful. As Fine puts\nit:\n\n\nwe may take x to depend upon y if y is a\nconstituent of a proposition that is true in virtue of the identity of\nx or, alternatively, if y is a constituent of an\nessential property of x. (Fine 1994b: 275)\n\n\nIt should also be noted that even though the notions of essential\ndependence defined above are no doubt more fine-grained than the\nmodal-existential notions, there may be reasons to think that even\nthey are not sufficiently fine-grained for all purposes (as argued in\nKoslicki 2012). To illustrate, consider Fine\u2019s well-known\ndiscussion of Socrates and the singleton set that has Socrates as its\nsole member. To use Fine\u2019s terminology, we could say that it is\npart of the constitutive essence of Socrates\u2019s singleton set\nthat it has Socrates as its sole member, whereas it is not\npart of the constitutive essence of Socrates to be the sole member of\nSocrates\u2019s singleton set. But as Koslicki (2012: 195) points\nout, this is really just to say that Socrates\u2019s singleton set\nontologically depends on Socrates whereas Socrates does not\nontologically depend on Socrates\u2019s singleton set. The relevant\nnotion of dependence appears to be built into Fine\u2019s notion of\nessence and, similarly, the notion of essence assumed by Fine (and\nmany other \u201cneo-Aristotelians\u201d) is already built into\n(EDC).\n\nBefore we conclude our discussion of essential dependence, a major\nissue in the literature concerning ontological dependence should be\nmentioned. For it appears that those who are willing to buy into a\nsuitably fine-grained notion of essence, popular in the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d tradition, will find the\nmodal-existential account of ontological dependence far too\ncoarse-grained. Yet, those who are not sympathetic to the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d notion of essence but would rather\nanalyze essence in terms of modality would insist that the\nmodal-existential analysis is quite sufficient, and indeed that\nessential dependence collapses into modal-existential dependence. The\nrecent literature has perhaps been dominated by the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d line (although one does not, of course,\nneed to be \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d to accept the notion of\nessential dependence or the \u201cnon-modalist\u201d analysis of\nessence), but this is indeed only a relatively recent phenomenon. A\nfurther issue is that there is some disagreement about how the\nrelevant notion of essence is to be constrained amongst those who\nthink that a more fine-grained analysis than the modal-existential\naccount is needed. For instance, Koslicki (2012: 196 ff.) regards\nFine\u2019s propositional notion of essence according to which there\nis little or no distinction between essence and real\ndefinition as overly restrictive. She identifies the source of\nthis restrictive conception of essence, which is also present in\nLowe\u2019s work, to be the focus on essences as\nindividuating\u2014this is the type of view regarding essential\ndependence, namely identity-dependence, which we have here been\nfocusing on. On Koslicki\u2019s alternative picture, essences\n\n\nmust do more than individuate the entities whose essences they are;\nand real definitions must do more than state conditions which uniquely\nidentify and delineate the entities under consideration at every time\nand in every world in which they exist. (Koslicki 2012: 200, fn.\n13)\n\n5. Ontological Dependence and Metaphysical Grounding\n\nThe notion of \u201cground\u201d stormed into contemporary analytic\nmetaphysics in the beginning of the twenty-first century, but the\nroots of the notion go back to Aristotle (for an overview, see Fine\n2012). Sometimes grounding is understood as \u201cmetaphysical\nexplanation\u201d. To be more precise, when some x is grounded\nin some y, it is usually thought that y explains\nx, and grounding either is that explanatory relationship or\n\u2018backs\u2019 that explanation (there is a lot of debate on\nthese issues, see the separate entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Moreover, the status of y is generally thought to be somehow\nprior to that of x\u2014grounding is typically\nunderstood to express priority between things. For instance, we might\nsay that the members of a set are prior to the set itself; the\nexistence of the set is grounded in its members. Or to take a more\nconcrete example, the existence of any given composite object is\ngrounded in the existence of its parts. For instance, we might suggest\nthat the existence of any given water molecule is grounded in the\nexistence of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Somewhat more controversially,\nwe might also say that mental states are grounded in physical states.\nIn each of the mentioned examples there appears to be an ontological\ndependence relation between the grounded entity and the grounding\nentity or entities. In fact, we have already discussed some of these\nexamples in terms of ontological dependence above. This naturally\nleads one to question whether grounding just is (a variety of)\nontological dependence\u2014or whether ontological dependence is\ngrounding. One motivation for finding a systematic link between\nontological dependence and grounding is that it would be more\nparsimonious than having two primitive notions (for discussion, see\nCorreia & Schnieder 2012b).\n\nAn initial reason to distinguish ontological dependence and\nmetaphysical grounding is that the latter is a much stricter notion.\nConsider the idea that ontological dependence could be reflexive:\nthere is nothing in theory that rules out a relation of ontological\ndependence obtaining in such a way that a given object is dependent on\nitself. It is of course controversial whether there actually are any\nsuch entities, but this is not enough to consider irreflexivity as a\nnecessary requirement for ontological dependence. In contrast,\nmetaphysical grounding is usually considered to be necessarily\nirreflexive (of course, there are those who think that this\nrequirement could be dropped in the case of grounding just like it may\nin the case of ontological dependence; see, e.g., Jenkins 2011).\n\nA more general issue concerns the modal implications of each notion.\nIn particular, is there a form of ontological dependence that is both\nnecessary and sufficient for grounding? This seems unlikely (as argued\nin Ryd\u00e9hn forthcoming). While there are some instances of\ngrounding which are clearly rigid in the same sense as rigid\nexistential dependence, it is also clear that this connection is not\nnecessary and sufficient. Take for instance the fact [f] and assume\nthat it is fully grounded in [g]. This entails that [f] cannot be\ngrounded except by [g]. An example would be the case of the set of\nsingleton Socrates, whose existence is rigidly grounded in the fact\nthat Socrates exists. In such cases, [f] rigidly existentially depends\nupon [g], and it is also plausible that [f] depends for its identity\nupon [g]. However, other instances of grounding do not require that\nthe grounded fact rigidly depends upon its grounds. For example,\nsuppose that [f] is the fact that a particular subject is feeling\npain, and that [f] is fully grounded in a particular neural fact about\nthis subject, [g]. It seems possible that this subject could have been\nin pain, so [f] could have obtained, even if [g] did not obtain. This\nwould be the case if [f] had been grounded in a different neural fact,\n[h]. In this case, [f] cannot depend for its identity upon [g], since\n[f] is not rigidly dependent upon [g]. This rules out some simple\noptions for linking grounding and rigid ontological dependence, but\nthere are arguably also problems for linking it with generic varieties\nof ontological dependence (for a more detailed discussion, see\nRyd\u00e9hn forthcoming).\n\nIf grounding cannot be easily analyzed with the help of rigid or\ngeneric dependence, then we might instead suggest that if grounding\nwere to be understood as a type of ontological dependence, it would be\nsome sort of explanatory dependence. The idea that whatever\ndoes the grounding also somehow explains what is being\ngrounded is a crucial part of the notion\u2019s appeal. Relations of\nontological dependence often seem to have a similar type of\nexplanatory role, but the link to explanation may appear weaker: even\nthough the existence of water depends on the existence of hydrogen and\noxygen, it does not seem to be the case that the existence of hydrogen\nand oxygen explain the existence of water. Rather, what\nexplains the existence of water is the ability of hydrogen and oxygen\natoms to form molecules (even though this is rather simplified). So\nthere are at least some difficulties in accounting for all relations\nof ontological dependence in terms of grounding relations.\n\nWe need something stricter than just \u201can explanatory role\u201d\nto identify grounding\u2014otherwise we would end up with a much too\nliberal notion, for we may regard a number of loosely connected things\nexplanatory in some very loose sense. For instance, we might say that\nthe fact that Smith murdered Jones is explained by certain events in\nSmith\u2019s childhood, but a more direct explanation might be\nSmith\u2019s desire to rob Jones. Certain events in Smith\u2019s\nchildhood may help us understand why Smith has murderous\ndesires, but it\u2019s not clear that they serve to ground the fact\nthat Smith murdered Jones (unless we can establish transitivity\nbetween these).\n\nOne suggestion that may help to make grounding more precise would be\nto focus on priority. To reiterate an example used above, if\nthe members of a set are prior to the set itself, then the existence\nof the set is grounded in its members. So the grounding entities are\nprior to\u2014or more fundamental than\u2014the grounded\nentities. Metaphors abound, but a typical way to express the idea is\nto say that x is fundamental or ontologically independent in\nthis sense if and only if nothing grounds x (Schaffer 2009:\n373). This is another sense in which grounding would seem to come\napart from certain types of ontological dependence, as a purely\nmodal-existential understanding of dependence in the lines of\n (EDR)\n (if one accepts them), without any claim to priority, is also\npossible. This is of course the sense which we defined above in terms\nof necessitation: even if x rigidly necessitates y that\ndoes not entail that y must be ontologically prior to x.\nAt any rate, it would be odd to say that parents are more\nfundamental than their children, even if there is a (temporally\nrelativized) rigid existential dependency between parents and their\nchildren.\n\nAll this would appear to suggest that it isn\u2019t straightforward\nto define grounding simply as a variety of ontological dependence, or\nthe other way around. In any case, even if we could define one notion\nin terms of the other, it seems that there are aspects of ontological\ndependence that are not captured by all accounts of grounding as well\nas aspects of grounding that are not captured by all accounts of\nontological dependence. The situation may of course change depending\non one\u2019s preferred account of dependence and grounding.\nAccordingly, for the time being, it is advisable to keep the notions\napart, especially since there are some further, formal differences\nthat need to be taken into account. In particular, grounding is most\ncommonly understood as a strict partial order (see Raven\n2013), which entails irreflexivity, transitivity, and asymmetry. If\nthis is correct, grounding could only capture a very specific variety\nof ontological dependence, as we have seen that there are varieties of\nontological dependence that violate these formal features. Some have\nalso argued that grounding itself violates all or some of these formal\nfeatures, so it is not entirely uncontroversial that grounding truly\nis a strict partial ordering (for discussion, see Jenkins 2011,\nSchaffer 2012, and Tahko 2013). Given this, the exact link between\ngrounding and ontological dependence remains open, subject to further\nspecification of the formal features of ground.\n6. Applications and Other Related Notions\n\nIn addition to the previous discussion regarding metaphysical\ngrounding, there are numerous applications of ontological dependence\nas well as closely related notions that we could discuss. It will not\nbe possible to do justice to all of them, but we will mention a few of\nthe most important ones (many of these and further applications are\ndiscussed in Hoeltje, Schnieder, and Steinberg (eds.) 2013).\n6.1 Supervenience\n\nThe notion of supervenience is covered in more detail in the separate\nentry on\n supervenience\n (see especially \u00a73.5) but a brief mention is in order here, as\nsupervenience has sometimes been conceived as a type of dependence.\nOne reason for this is that when we assert that A supervenes on\nB, we might also say that A-properties ontologically\ndepend upon B-properties. Take the typical example of the\nbeauty of a work of art and the physical manifestation of that work of\nart. It would seem that if you wish to change the aesthetic properties\nof an artwork, you will also have to manipulate its physical\nmanifestation. As a first pass, it looks as if the dependence at work\nhere is generic existential dependence as defined by\n (EDG),\n so the aesthetic A-properties dependG for their\nexistence upon some physical B-properties. However,\nsupervenience in general is not so easily analyzed, as at least on one\nusual conception, supervenience is not irreflexive and hence not\nasymmetric (see Steinberg 2013). In other words, we can at least say\nthat supervenience, as opposed to grounding, is not a strict partial\norder and hence not a relation of ontological priority. There are\nvarious ways to further specify the formal features of supervenience,\nand indeed to argue that it should not be considered as a form of\ndependence, but this is not a task that we can undertake here.\n6.2 Truthmaking\n\nThe connection between ontological dependence and truthmaking is of a\nmore general type. On many construals, the core of truthmaker theory\nis considered to be the idea that truth depends\u2014or\nsupervenes\u2014on being (Bigelow 1988: 133; see\nalso Armstrong 2004, Schaffer 2010a, and Liggins 2012). Recently, some\nhave resisted this idea (e.g., Merricks 2007), but it does remain\npopular among truthmaker theorists (for discussion, see the separate\nentry on\n truthmakers).\n Moreover, the connection between truthmaking and ontological\ndependence has been a part of truthmaker theory from the very\nbeginning; Mulligan, Simons, and Smith (1984: 294) rely on\nHusserl\u2019s work on ontological dependence in their introduction\nof the idea of truthmaking (for further discussion of Husserl\u2019s\nwork regarding dependence, see Simons 1982 and Johansson 2004: Ch. 9).\nMore precisely, it seems there must be some way in which the world is\nin virtue of which true propositions are true, but the world itself is\nnot symmetrically dependent on truth; there is an asymmetric\ndependence relation between truth and being (accordingly, this\ndependence needs to be expressed with an asymmetric notion of\ndependence, see\n \u00a73\n above).\n\nHowever, popular though it is, this view is not entirely\nuncontroversial. For instance, MacBride (2014) argues that there is no\nneed to appeal to truthmaking to explain this type of asymmetric\ndependence between truth and being. In fact, there are reasons to\nthink that truthmaking cannot explain the asymmetry, at least\nnot on the basis of the idea that truth supervenes on being. Part of\nthe confusion here seems to surround the relevant notion of\nsupervenience. On Armstrong\u2019s (2004: 8) construal, the relevant\nnotion of supervenience is symmetric: truth supervenes on being, but\nbeing also supervenes on truth. So it appears that the required\nasymmetry cannot arise from supervenience itself (see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005). While these problems must be settled\nelsewhere, it suffices to say that some variety of\nontological dependence is no doubt at work in truthmaker\ntheory\u2014there is an on-going debate as to how truthmaking should\nbe specified. One recent suggestion that may have some mileage is that\nthe relevant asymmetry could be recovered if truthmaking is understood\nas truth-grounding, that is, some entity x grounds the\ntruth of some proposition p if p is true in virtue of\nthe existence of x (see Tahko 2013 for discussion).\n6.3 Substance\n\nOne important application of ontological dependence is the analysis of\nthe notion of \u201csubstance\u201d\u2014a basic or fundamental\nentity which possesses at least some degree of ontological independence\n(for discussion on the various uses of \u201csubstance\u201d in\nphilosophy, see the separate entry on\n substance).\n If the idea of ontological independence is somehow associated with\n\u201csubstance\u201d, then it seems that some account of what the\nrelevant dependence amounts to will be required. In fact, those\nfamiliar with Lowe 2005 [2010] (an earlier version of the present\nentry), will recall that the discussion was entirely focused on\nfinding the most plausible account of ontological dependence for the\npurposes of analyzing the notion of substance (this discussion\noriginates from Lowe 1998: Ch. 6). This also ties in with a more\ngeneral application of ontological dependence, namely, the study of\nformal ontological relations obtaining between ontological categories,\nof which substance is a prime example (see also Hoffman &\nRosenkrantz 1994, Schaffer 2009, and Nolan 2011). So how should we\ndefine \u201csubstance\u201d given the various notions of\nontological dependence that we have at our disposal? It will be\nrecalled that one particularly powerful notion of ontological\ndependence is the notion of identity-dependence, which we arrived at\nwhen looking for an asymmetrical\u2014or, at least, an\nantisymmetrical\u2014relationship of ontological dependence.\nIt seems that if substances are considered as ontologically\nindependent entities, then an asymmetric relation is\nrequired. One possibility for defining substance, which relies on\n (EDR)\n is the following:\n\n(SUB-1)\n x is a substance =df x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical with x and x dependsR for its\nexistence upon y.\n\n\n(SUB-1) could be seen to follow the precedent of Aristotle,\nwho\u2014in the Categories\u2014admitted only\nparticulars as \u201cprimary\u201d substances, while\nallowing some universals (the species and genera of primary\nsubstances) the status of \u201csecondary\u201d substances (see\nAristotle, Categories: Ch. 2). However, (SUB-1), because it\nrelies on\n (EDR),\n will be unsatisfactory for those who are convinced that the\nmodal-existential analysis of ontological dependence is not\nsufficiently fine-grained; it will face the type of problems that we\nhave discussed above in\n \u00a72.2.\n We know already that it won\u2019t do to replace the notion of\nexistential dependence employed in (SUB-1) by appealing instead to the\nrelation of essential existential dependence, as defined by\n (EDE),\n because the latter is neither an asymmetrical nor an antisymmetrical\nrelation. Indeed, this is one lesson of the example of the\nsphere\u2019s two hemispheres discussed immediately after the\ndefinition for (EDE) was given. For, whereas the whole sphere\nmight well be taken to qualify as a substance, neither of its\n\u201chalves\u201d plausibly can, because they lack the requisite\nkind of ontological independence. But, while (SUB-1) reinterpreted in\nterms of (EDE) does indeed have the implication that neither of the\nhemispheres is a substance\u2014because each dependsE for\nits existence on the other and hence on a particular distinct from\nitself\u2014it also has the unwanted implication that the whole\nsphere is not a substance for the same reason, because it is\narguably a part of the essence of the sphere as a whole that it exists\nonly if each of its hemispheres exists. However, an obvious remedy is\nat hand. We can simply replace the appeal to any species of\nexistential dependence in a definition on the pattern of\n(SUB-1) by an appeal to the relation of identity-dependence,\nas defined by\n (ID),\n to give:\n\n(SUB-2)\n x is a substance =df x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical with x and x depends for its identity upon\ny.\n\n\nComposite substances appear to comply with (SUB-2): for, plausibly,\nalthough they possess proper parts, they do not depend for their\nidentity upon those parts, since which objects those\nparts are does not help to determine of which substances they\nare parts (the same objects being capable of becoming parts of many\ndifferent substances). Moreover, substances quite generally do not\ndepend for their identity upon their (accidental) particularized\nproperties, if such exist, nor upon the events in which they\nparticipate, nor upon the places they occupy, nor upon other\nsubstances. The particularized properties (i.e., tropes or modes) of\nsubstances and the events in which substances participate\u2014that\nis, items such as the particular redness of this apple and the\nassassination of Caesar\u2014would appear to depend for their\nidentity upon those substances, which precludes the reverse\nrelationship from obtaining, on pain of circularity. (However, see\nKein\u00e4nen & Hakkarainen 2014 for discussion; in particular,\nthey propose a strategy for identifying tropes that does not entail\ncircularity in the individuation of tropes. See also Moltmann 2019,\nwhich discusses the problem of spatial location related to tropes and\nother entities.) As for places, although a physical substance must\nindeed occupy some place, which place it occupies\ndoes not determine which substance it is, since substances\nmay exchange places.\n\nOne motivation for rejecting the appeal to\n (EDR)\n in the analysis of substance is that it permits two different\nentities to be existentially dependentR upon one\nanother\u2014entities such as Socrates and Socrates\u2019s\nlife. As we have seen,\n (ID)\n precludes any analogous symmetry where identity-dependence\nis concerned: indeed, it delivers the intuitively correct verdict that\nit is Socrates\u2019s life that is, in this sense,\nontologically dependent upon Socrates, rather than vice\nversa. For Socrates\u2019s life is an extended event or process\nin which he participates\u2014and which person Socrates is\npartially determines which event this is, but not vice\nversa. Or, to put it another way\u2014one which should by now be\nfamiliar\u2014it is part of the essence of Socrates\u2019s\nlife that it is the life of Socrates, but it is not\npart of the essence of Socrates that he is the person who lived that\nlife. Of course, we can still acknowledge that the relation defined by\n (EDR)\n does hold mutually between Socrates and his life and we can still\ncall this relationship a type of existential\ndependence\u2014namely, \u201crigid\u201d existential\ndependence. Similarly, we can recognize as other species of\nexistential dependence the \u201cgeneric\u201d existential\ndependence defined by\n (EDG),\n the \u201casymmetrical\u201d rigid existential dependence defined\nby\n (EDA)\n and the \u201cessential\u201d existential dependence defined by\n (EDE).\n\nThe key point is simply that, in the sense of \u201contological\ndependence\u201d which fits quite naturally with the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d account of substances as\nontologically independent objects, the relationships defined\nby\n (EDR),\n (EDG),\n (EDA),\n and\n (EDE)\n will not serve the purpose, whereas that defined by\n (ID)\nwill. On this view, the sense in which a substance is an\nentity which does not depend \u201contologically\u201d upon anything\nother than itself is exactly the sense in which it does not depend for\nits identity upon anything else. This still leaves many\ninteresting questions concerning ontological (in)dependence\nunanswered, notably the question of whether there is a fundamental\nlevel or layer of reality, consisting of one or more\nentities upon which all other existing entities depend ontologically\nin one way or another (for discussion, see Lowe 1998: 154\u201373;\nSchaffer 2003; Cameron 2008; and Paseau 2010).\n6.4 Fundamentality\n\nIt seems plausible that at least in some cases where one entity is\nmore fundamental than another one, it is because the less\nfundamental is ontologically dependent on the more fundamental. Much\nof the recent discussion involving ontological dependence has focused\nexactly on the question of fundamentality and especially the question\nmentioned above, namely whether there is something that is entirely\nfundamental, ontologically independent\u2014is there an ontological\n\u201cbottom level\u201d? Hence, there are two senses in which a\nclearer understanding of ontological dependence may help: we can\nspecify in what sense fundamental entities are ontologically\nindependent as well as how other entities may be ontologically\ndependent on the fundamental entities, thus gaining further\nunderstanding of the supposed \u201chierarchy\u201d that terminates\nin the bottom level.\n\nThe bottom level is usually thought to be at the smaller end of the\nspectrum: the atomistic view suggests that certain subatomic\nparticles are fundamental. But this does not mean that the fundamental\nlevel must necessarily be at the bottom\u2014the fundamental end\ncould also be at the top, i.e., the universe as a whole could be\nconsidered fundamental\u2014a substance in its own right (see\nSchaffer 2010b). Each of these views is a type of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, which suggests that chains of ontological\ndependence must come to an end, at least at the dependent end. In\nother words, metaphysical foundationalism asserts that chains of\nasymmetric ontological dependence must terminate, they must be\nwell-founded. The idea is typically formulated in\nmereological terms, as the reference to atomism suggests: there is an\nasymmetric ontological dependence relation from one end of the\nmereological scale to the other. These questions also have\nimplications for the debate between pluralism and\nmonism (one form of such monism is defended in Schaffer 2010b\nand Tallant 2015 discusses the notion of ontological dependence in\nconnection to Schaffer\u2019s monism; see also Trogdon 2009 and the\nseparate entry on\n monism).\n\nHowever, there have been some speculative suggestions according to\nwhich chains of ontological dependence could go on ad\ninfinitum, and hence violate the requirement of well-foundedness\n(for discussion, see Bliss 2013, Morganti 2014, and Tahko 2014). The\nresulting view would appear to be some sort of metaphysical\ninfinitism as opposed to metaphysical foundationalism. One\nversion of such a view, if combined with the idea that the direction\nof dependence is towards the smaller, is a \u201cgunky\u201d\nontology, whereby matter is infinitely divisible \u201cgunk\u201d\nand objects or matter have no smallest parts. But as interesting as\nthese views and the discussion surrounding fundamentality are,\ndiscussing them in detail here would take us too far from our original\ntopic (for further discussion, see the separate entry on\n fundamentality).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>Categories</em>, in <em>Categories and De\nInterpretatione</em>, trans.
