    "main_text": "\n\nBig Data promises to revolutionise the production of knowledge within\nand beyond science, by enabling novel, highly efficient ways to plan,\nconduct, disseminate and assess research. The last few decades have\nwitnessed the creation of novel ways to produce, store, and analyse\ndata, culminating in the emergence of the field of data\nscience, which brings together computational, algorithmic,\nstatistical and mathematical techniques towards extrapolating\nknowledge from big data. At the same time, the Open Data\nmovement\u2014emerging from policy trends such as the push for Open\nGovernment and Open Science\u2014has encouraged the sharing and\ninterlinking of heterogeneous research data via large digital\ninfrastructures. The availability of vast amounts of data in\nmachine-readable formats provides an incentive to create efficient\nprocedures to collect, organise, visualise and model these data. These\ninfrastructures, in turn, serve as platforms for the development of\nartificial intelligence, with an eye to increasing the reliability,\nspeed and transparency of processes of knowledge creation. Researchers\nacross all disciplines see the newfound ability to link and\ncross-reference data from diverse sources as improving the accuracy\nand predictive power of scientific findings and helping to identify\nfuture directions of inquiry, thus ultimately providing a novel\nstarting point for empirical investigation. As exemplified by the rise\nof dedicated funding, training programmes and publication venues, big\ndata are widely viewed as ushering in a new way of performing research\nand challenging existing understandings of what counts as scientific\nknowledge.\n\nThis entry explores these claims in relation to the use of big data\nwithin scientific research, and with an emphasis on the philosophical\nissues emerging from such use. To this aim, the entry discusses how\nthe emergence of big data\u2014and related technologies, institutions\nand norms\u2014informs the analysis of the following themes: \n\n how statistics, formal and computational models help to\nextrapolate patterns from data, and with which consequences; \n the role of critical scrutiny (human intelligence) in machine\nlearning, and its relation to the intelligibility of research\nprocesses; \n the nature of data as research components; \n the relation between data and evidence, and the role of data as\nsource of empirical insight; \n the view of knowledge as theory-centric; \n understandings of the relation between prediction and causality;\n\n the separation of fact and value; and \n the risks and ethics of data science. \n\n\nThese are areas where attention to research practices revolving around\nbig data can benefit philosophy, and particularly work in the\nepistemology and methodology of science. This entry doesn\u2019t cover the\nvast scholarship in the history and social studies of science that has\nemerged in recent years on this topic, though references to some of\nthat literature can be found when conceptually relevant. Complementing\nhistorical and social scientific work in data studies, the\nphilosophical analysis of data practices can also elicit significant\nchallenges to the hype surrounding data science and foster a critical\nunderstanding of the role of data-fuelled artificial intelligence in\nresearch.\n",
