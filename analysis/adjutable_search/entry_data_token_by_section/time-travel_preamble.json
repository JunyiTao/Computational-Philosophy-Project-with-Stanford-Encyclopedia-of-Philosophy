    "main_text": "\nThere is an extensive literature on time travel in both philosophy\nand physics. Part of the great interest of the topic stems from the\nfact that reasons have been given both for thinking that time travel\nis physically possible\u2014and for thinking that it is logically\nimpossible! This entry deals primarily with philosophical issues;\nissues related to the physics of time travel are covered in the\nseparate entries on \n time travel and modern physics\nand\n time machines.\n We begin with the definitional question:\nwhat is time travel? We then turn to the major objection to the\npossibility of backwards time travel: the Grandfather paradox. Next,\nissues concerning causation are discussed\u2014and then, issues in\nthe metaphysics of time and change. We end with a discussion of the\nquestion why, if backwards time travel will ever occur, we have not\nbeen visited by time travellers from the future.\n",
