Adverbs like normally and typically are\nalso indicators of generic predication. As Asher and Pelletier (Asher\nand Pelletier 1997) have argued, the semantics for such sentences\nseems to involve intentionality: a generic sentence can be true even\nif the majority of the kind, or even all of the kind, fail to conform\nto the generalization. It can be true that birds fly even if, as a\nresult of a freakish accident, all surviving birds are abnormally\nflightless. A promising semantic theory for the generic is to\nrepresent generic predication by means of a defeasible rule or\nconditional.\n\nThe progressive verb involves a similar kind of intentionality. (Asher\n1992) If Jones is crossing the street, then it would normally\nbe the case that Jones will succeed in crossing the street.\nHowever, this inference is clearly defeasible: Jones might be hit by a\ntruck midway across and never complete the crossing.\n",
