    "main_text": "Theories of Experience\n3. Theories of Experience\n\nA number of philosophical theories of experience have emerged as\nresponses to the Problem of Perception, or in relation to such\nresponses. Here we consider the sense-datum theory\n (\u00a73.1),\n adverbialism\n (\u00a73.2),\n intentionalism\n (\u00a73.3),\n and naive realist disjunctivism\n (\u00a73.4).\n In this exposition we do not consider much the possibility of hybrid\nviews. The way these positions relate to the Problem of Perception is\nmapped most clearly in Martin (1995, 1998, 2000).\n\nWe present these theories as operating on two levels. On Level 1, they\ntell us about the nature of experience. With the exception of\nadverbialism (for reasons that will emerge shortly), this can be\ninvestigated by considering the stance of each theory on the nature of\nthe objects of experience, and the structure of our experience of\nobjects. On Level 2, they tell us how what is said at the first level\nbears on the explanation of the character of experience. We also\nconsider how each theory addresses the common kind question.\n\nIn what follows, we\u2019ll work with the example of a visual\nexperience of a snow-covered churchyard. To simplify, we will discuss\nthe character of this experience in terms of one aspect of it: things\nlooking white to a subject. The question at Level 1 is: what is the\nnature of such an experience? Does it involve the direct presentation\nof objects, or not? If so, what sorts of objects? If not, how are we\nto understand the nature of this experience? The question at Level 2\nis: what is it about the nature of this experience that explains why\nthings look any way at all to someone, and why they look,\nspecifically, white?\n",
