    "main_text": "Expected Utility Theory || The Theory\n1.1 The Theory\n\nDecision theory concerns individuals\u2019 preferences among both\nconsequences (sometimes called \u201coutcomes\u201d) and\ngambles. The theory as originally developed focused on\ndecisions with monetary consequences (e.g., receiving $10 in a game of\nchance), but subsequent developments broadened their focus to include\ndecisions with non-monetary consequences as well (e.g., eating a large\nomelet, eating a smaller omelet, being stuck in the rain without an\numbrella, lugging an umbrella around in the sunshine). Most\ncontemporary authors define consequences to include any facts about a\ndecision-maker\u2019s situation that matter to her\u2014so monetary\nconsequences must technically describe a decision-maker\u2019s total\nfortune, and non-monetary consequences must technically describe the\nentire world that the decision-maker finds herself in\u2014though\nthese full descriptions are often omitted when a decision will not\nalter the surrounding facts. Let the consequence set be \\(\\cX.\\) A\nutility function \\(\\uf: \\cX \\rightarrow \\cR\\) assigns values\nto consequences, with the constraint that the individual prefers (or\nshould prefer), of two consequences, the one with the higher utility\nvalue, and is indifferent between any two consequences with the same\nutility value. Thus the utility function in some sense represents how\nthe individual values consequences.\n\nGambles come in one of two forms, depending on whether we are dealing\nwith the \u201cobjective probability\u201d or \u201csubjective\nprobability\u201d version of the theory. In the objective probability\nversion, a gamble is a lottery that assigns probabilities to\nconsequences. Consider, for example, a lottery that yields $100 with\nprobability 0.5, $300 with probability 0.3, and $200 with probability\n0.2. We can represent this lottery as {$100, 0.5; $300, 0.3; $200,\n0.2}. More generally, lotteries have the form \\(L = \\{x_1, p_1;\\ldots;\nx_n, p_n\\},\\) where \\(x_i \\in \\cX\\) and \\(p_i\\) is the probability\nthat consequence \\(x_i\\) obtains. Lotteries needn\u2019t be\nrestricted to a finite set of consequences; they could instead be\ncontinuous.\n\nIn the subjective probability version, a gamble is an act\n(sometimes called as \u201cSavage act\u201d; Savage 1954) that\nassigns consequences to possible states of the world. Consider, for\nexample, the act of cracking an extra egg into one\u2019s omelet,\nwhen the egg may be rotten: if the egg is fresh, the consequence will\nbe a large omelet, but if the egg is rotten, the consequence will be a\nruined omelet. We can represent this act a as {extra\negg is fresh, large omelet; extra egg is\nrotten, ruined omelet}, and we can represent the act of not\ncracking the extra egg as {extra egg is rotten or\nfresh, small omelet}. More generally, acts have the form \\(g =\n\\{E_1, x_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\},\\) where \\(x_i \\in\\cX,\\) \\(E_i \\subseteq\n\\cS\\) is an event (a subset of the state space), and \\(x_i\\)\nobtains when the true state of the world is in \\(E_i.\\) Again, acts\nneedn\u2019t be restricted to a finite set of consequences. In the\nsubjective probability version, the individual has a probability\nfunction \\(p\\) that assigns to each \\(E_i\\) a number between 0\nand 1 (inclusive), which represents her subjective probabilities, also\ncalled \u201cdegrees of belief\u201d or \u201ccredences\u201d. The\nprobability function is additive in the sense that if \\(E\\)\nand \\(F\\) are mutually exclusive, then \\(p(E v F) = p(E) + p(F).\\)\n(For some of the discussion, it does not matter if we are talking\nabout lotteries or acts, so I will use the variables A,\nB, C\u2026 to range over lotteries or acts.)\n\nThe core principle of expected utility theory concerns how the utility\nvalues of gambles are related to the utility values of consequences.\nIn particular, the slogan of expected utility theory is that\nrational agents maximize expected utility. The expected\nutility (EU) of a lottery, relative to an individual\u2019s utility\nfunction \\(\\uf,\\) is: \n\n\\[\n\\EU(L) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_{i} \\uf(x_{i})\n\\]\n\n\nThe expected utility of an act, relative to an individual\u2019s\nutility function \\(\\uf\\) and probability function \\(p,\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\EU(g) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p(E_{i}) \\uf(x)_{i}\n\\]\n\n\nContinuous versions of these are defined using an integral instead of\na sum.\n\nExpected utility theory holds that an individual\u2019s preferences\norder gambles according to their expected utility, or ought to do so:\n\\(A \\succcurlyeq B\\) iff \\(\\EU(A) \\ge \\EU(B).\\) Generally, weak\npreference \\((\\succcurlyeq)\\) is taken to be basic and strict\npreference \\((\\succ)\\) and indifference \\((\\sim)\\) defined in the\nusual way (\\(A \\succ B\\) iff \\(A \\succcurlyeq B\\) and not-\\((B\n\\succcurlyeq A)\\); \\(A \\sim B\\) iff \\(A \\succcurlyeq B\\) and \\(B\n\\succcurlyeq A\\)).\n\nWe can take utility and probability to be basic, and the norm to tell\nus what to prefer; alternatively, we can take preferences to be basic,\nand the utility and probability functions to be derived from them. Say\nthat a utility (and probability) function represents a\npreference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) under EU- maximization\njust in case:\n\n\n\n\\(u\\) represents \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) under EU-maximization (objective\nprobabilities): for all lotteries \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2,\\) \n\n\\[L_1 \\succcurlyeq L_2 \\text{ iff } \\EU(L_1) \\ge \\EU(L_2),\\]\n\n\nwhere EU is calculated relative to \\(u.\\)\n\n\n\\(u\\) and \\(p\\) represent \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) under EU-maximization\n(subjective probabilities): for all acts \\(f\\) and \\(g,\\)\n\n\\[f \\succcurlyeq g \\text{ iff } \\EU(f) \\ge \\EU(g), \\]\n\n\nwhere EU is calculated relative to \\(u\\) and \\(p.\\)\n\n\nA representation theorem exhibits a set of axioms (call it\n[axioms]) such that the following relationship\nholds:\n\n\nRepresentation Theorem (objective probabilities): If a preference\nrelation over lotteries satisfies [axioms],\nthen there is a utility function \\(u,\\) unique up to positive affine\ntransformation, that represents the preference relation under\nEU-maximization.\nRepresentation Theorem (subjective probabilities): If a preference\nrelation over lotteries satisfies [axioms],\nthen there is a utility function \\(u,\\) unique up to positive affine\ntransformation, and a unique probability function \\(p\\) that represent\nthe preference relation under EU-maximization.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnique up to positive affine transformation\u201d means that\nany utility function \\(u'\\) that also represents the preference\nrelation can be transformed into \\(u\\) by multiplying by a constant\nand adding a constant (to borrow an example from a different domain:\ntemperature scales are unique up to positive affine transformation,\nbecause although temperature can be represented by Celsius or\nFahrenheit, Celsius can be transformed into Fahrenheit by multiplying\nby 9/5 and adding 32).\n\nThe first and most historically important axiomatization of the\nobjective probabilities version of expected utility theory is that of\nvon Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). The axioms are as follows\n(slightly different versions appear in the original):\n\n\nCompleteness: For all lotteries \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2 : L_1\n\\succcurlyeq L_2\\) or \\(L_2 \\succcurlyeq L_1.\\)\nTransitivity: For all lotteries \\(L_1, L_2,\\) and \\(L_3\\): If\n\\(L_1 \\succcurlyeq L_2\\) and \\(L_2 \\succcurlyeq L_3,\\) then \\(L_1\n\\succcurlyeq L_3.\\)\nContinuity: For all lotteries \\(L_1, L_2,\\) and \\(L_3\\): If \\(L_1\n\\succcurlyeq L_2\\) and \\(L_2 \\succcurlyeq L_3,\\) then there is some\nreal number \\(p\\in [0, 1]\\) such that \\(L_2 \\sim\\{L_1, p\\); \\(L_3, 1 -\np\\}\\)\nIndependence: For all lotteries \\(L_1,\\) \\(L_2,\\) \\(L_3\\) and all \\(0\n\\lt p \\le 1\\):\n\n\\[\nL_1 \\succcurlyeq L_2 \\Leftrightarrow \\{L_1, p; L_3, 1 - p\\} \\succcurlyeq \\{L_2, p; L_3, 1 - p\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe most historically important axiomatization of the subjective\nprobabilities version of expected utility theory is that of Savage\n(1954), though other prominent versions include Ramsey (1926), Jeffrey\n(1965), Armendt (1986, 1988), and Joyce (1999). These generally\ninclude axioms that are analogues of the von\nNeumann-Morgenstern axioms, plus some additional axioms that will not be our focus.\n\nThe first two of the axioms that will be our focus are (as above) completeness and\ntransitivity:\n\n\nCompleteness: For all acts \\(f\\) and \\(g\\): \\(f \\succcurlyeq g\\)\nor \\(f \\succcurlyeq g.\\)\nTransitivity: For all acts \\(f,\\) \\(g,\\) and \\(h\\): If \\(f\n\\succcurlyeq g\\) and \\(g \\succcurlyeq h,\\) then \\(f \\succcurlyeq\nh.\\)\n\n\n\nThe third is some version of continuity, sometimes called an\nArchimedean Axiom.\n\nThe final axiom is a separability axiom. Savage\u2019s\nversion of this axiom is known as the sure-thing principle. Where\n\\(f_E h\\) is an act that agrees with f on event E and\nagrees with h elsewhere:\n\n\nSure-thing Principle: For all acts \\(f_E h,\\) \\(g_E h,\\) \\(f_E j,\\) and \\(g_E j\\): \\[f_E h \\succcurlyeq g_E h \\Leftrightarrow f_E j \\succcurlyeq g_E j\\]\n\n\n\nIn other words, if two acts agree on what happens on not-E,\nthen one\u2019s preference between them should be determined only by\nwhat happens on E. Other separability axioms include Jeffrey\u2019s\nAveraging (1965) and K\u00f6bberling and Wakker\u2019s Tradeoff\nConsistency (2003).\n\nBecause representation theorems link, on the one hand, preferences\nthat accord with the axioms and, on the other hand, a utility (and\nprobability) function whose expectation the individual maximizes, a\nchallenge to one of the three components of expected utility theory\nmust also be a challenge to one (or more) of the axioms.\n",
