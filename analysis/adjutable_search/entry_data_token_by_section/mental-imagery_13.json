    "main_text": "Mental imagery in cognition || Mental imagery and emotion\n3.2 Mental imagery and emotion\n\nTry to imagine, as vividly as you can, being attacked by a rabid dog,\nfoaming at the mouth, snapping at your feet right there under your\ndesk. The resulting mental imagery is an important form of mental\nimagery and also an important form of emotional state. More generally,\nimagery dramatically affects emotions \u2013 it seems for instance\ndifficult to make sense of what goes on in the mind of a fearful or\nangry person without appealing to imagery. On the other hand, the\nimpact of emotions on imagery is equally significant \u2013 the\nimagery that occupies our minds is very often under the control of our\ndominant emotion, which sometimes alters its fabric and our capacity\nto control it. In other words, there is a two-way interaction between\nemotions and mental imagery (see Holmes and Matthews 2010 for a\nsummary).\n\nRecent findings support this picture of the close connection between\nmental imagery and emotions. For example, imagining an emotionally\ncharged event or person at an emotionally neutral place confers\nemotional charge to the place (see Benoit et al. 2019). It has been\nknown for a while that seeing a negatively valenced event (say, a\nfight between two friends of yours) at a neutral place (say, the\ncorridor in front of your office) makes this formerly neutral place\ninherit the negative valence of the event. So, in the future, when you\nsee the corridor of your office, it triggers slight (or not so slight)\nnegative emotions. The crucial finding is that the same process also\ntakes place even if you merely imagine a negatively valenced event at\na neutral place. In short, negatively valenced mental imagery confers\nvalence on various components of the imagined scene, which then remain\nemotionally valenced.\n\nThe degree to which imagery and affective states are intertwined is\nfurther emphasized by the mood congruency effect (Blaney 1986, Matt et\nal. 1992, Gaddy and Ingram 2014). The most famous example of mood\ncongruency effect is mood congruent memory (Loeffler et al. 2013)\n\u2013 we are more likely to recall scary memories when we are\nscared, for example. But mood congruency also works in the case of\nmental imagery: your general mood makes it more likely that you form\nmental imagery that is congruent with your mood. And it makes it less\nlikely that you form mental imagery that is not congruent with your\nmood. We also encode emotionally salient stimuli in a more detailed\nmanner, which makes it possible to form more vivid mental imagery\n(Yonelinas & Ritchey 2015, Hamann 2001, LaBar & Cabeza 2006,\nPhelps 2004).\n",
