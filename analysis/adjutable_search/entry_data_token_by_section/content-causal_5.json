    "main_text": "Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content || Developmental Functions\n3.3 Developmental Functions\n\nHypothesizing that certain activities or events within the brain mean\nwhat they do, in part, because of some function that develops over the\ncourse of an individual\u2019s lifetime shares many of the attractive\nfeatures of the hypothesis that these same activities or events mean\nwhat they do, in part, because of some evolutionarily acquired\nfunction. One again can say that it is not the function of\n\u201cX\u201d to register the presence of LSD, microelectrodes,\nfoxes, stuffed dogs, or paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dogs, or questions,\nbut it is their function to report on dogs. Moreover, it does not\ninvoke dubious suppositions about an intimate connection between\nnatural selection and the precise details of neuronal hardware and its\noperation. A functional account based on ontogenetic function\nacquisition or learning seems to be an improvement. This is the core\nof the approach taken in Dretske (1981; 1988).\n\nThe function acquisition story proposes that during development, an\norganism is trained to discriminate real flesh and blood dogs from\nquestions, foxes, stuffed dogs, paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dogs under\nconditions of good lighting, without occlusions, or distractions. A\nteacher ensures that training proceeds according to plan. Once\n\u201cX\u201d has acquired the function to respond to dogs, the\ntraining is over. Thereafter, any instances in which \u201cX\u201d\nis triggered by foxes, stuffed dogs, paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dogs,\nLSD, microelectrodes, etc., are false tokenings and figure into false\nbeliefs.\n3.3.1 Objections to Developmental Functions\n\nAmong the most familiar objections to this proposal is that there is\nno principled distinction between when a creature is learning and when\nit is done learning. Instances in which a creature entertains the\nhypothesis that \u201cX\u201d means X, instances in which the\ncreature entertains the hypothesis that \u201cX\u201d means Y,\ninstances in which the creature straightforwardly uses \u201cX\u201d\nto mean X, and instances in which the creature straightforwardly uses\n\u201cX\u201d to mean Y are thoroughly intermingled. The problem is\nperhaps more clearly illustrated with tokens of natural language,\nwhere children will use words struggling through correct and incorrect\nuses of a word before (perhaps) finally settling on a correct usage.\nThere seems to be no principled way to specify if learning has stopped\nor whether there is instead \u201clifelong learning\u201d. This is\namong the objections to be found in Fodor (1984).\n\nThis, however, is a relatively technical objection. Further reflection\nsuggests that there may be an underlying appeal to the intentions of\nthe teacher. Let us revisit the learning story. Suppose that during\nthe learning period the subject is trained to use \u201cX\u201d as a\nmental representation of dogs. Now, let the student graduate from\n\u201cX\u201d using school and immediately thereafter see a fox.\nSeeing this fox causes a token of \u201cX\u201d and one would like\nto say that this is an instance of mistaking a fox for a dog, hence a\nfalse tokening. But, consider the situation counterfactually. If the\nstudent had seen the fox during the training period just before\ngraduation, the fox would have triggered a token of \u201cX\u201d.\nThis suggests that we might just as well say that the student learned\nthat \u201cX\u201d means fox or dog as that the student learned that\n\u201cX\u201d means dog. Thus, we might just as well say that, after\ntraining, the graduate does not falsely think of a dog, but truly\nthinks of a fox or a dog. The threat of running afoul of naturalist\nscruples comes if one attempts to say, in one way or another, that it\nis because the teacher meant for the student to learn that\n\u201cX\u201d means dog, rather than \u201cX\u201d means fox or\ndog. The threatened violation of naturalism comes in invoking the\nteacher\u2019s intentions. This, too, is an objection to be found in\nFodor (1984).\n",
