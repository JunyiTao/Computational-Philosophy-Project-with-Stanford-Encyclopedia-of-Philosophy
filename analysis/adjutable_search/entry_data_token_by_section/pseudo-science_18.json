In practice, the term mostly refers to implausible such\ntheories, used to explain social facts that have other, considerably\nmore plausible explanations. Many pseudosciences are connected with\nconspiracy theories. For instance, one of the difficulties facing\nanti-vaccinationists is that they have to explain the overwhelming\nconsensus among medical experts that vaccines are efficient. This is\noften done by claims of a conspiracy:\n\n\nAt the heart of the anti-vaccine conspiracy movement [lies] the\nargument that large pharmaceutical companies and governments are\ncovering up information about vaccines to meet their own sinister\nobjectives. According to the most popular theories, pharmaceutical\ncompanies stand to make such healthy profits from vaccines that they\nbribe researchers to fake their data, cover up evidence of the harmful\nside effects of vaccines, and inflate statistics on vaccine\nefficacy. (Jolley and Douglas 2014)\n\n\nConspiracy theories have peculiar epistemic characteristics that\ncontribute to their pervasiveness. (Keeley 1999) In particular, they\nare often associated with a type of circular reasoning that allows\nevidence against the conspiracy to be interpreted as evidence for\nit.\n",
