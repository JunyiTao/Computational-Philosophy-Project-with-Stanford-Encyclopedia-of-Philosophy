    "main_text": "Scalar versus Threshold Conceptions of Moral Status\n4. Scalar versus Threshold Conceptions of Moral Status\n\nOne could hold either a threshold or scalar conception of moral\nstatus, although FMS is a threshold conception. Suppose, for example,\nthat the capacity to value (which we will use as shorthand for the\ncapacity to make an evaluative judgment) were a sufficient ground for\nhaving a high degree of moral status. According to the threshold\nconception, if the capacity to value grounds a high degree of moral\nstatus, then any being that has this capacity, regardless of how often\nor how well it can exhibit this capacity, has the same moral status as\nany other being with this capacity. A being that could recognize only\none value among many, and could only value it on rare occasions, would\nhave the same moral status as a being that could recognize many\nvaluable things and value them on every relevant occasion. If the\ncapacity to value is not only sufficient but necessary for a high\ndegree of moral status, then all beings lacking this capacity would\nnot have this high degree of moral status. However, the threshold\nconception would nevertheless leave it open whether having some other\nfeature, such as the mere capacity to have preferences, might be\ngrounds for a lesser degree of moral status. (Having preferences is\ndifferent from making an evaluative judgment; only the latter involves\nthinking of something as good, worthy, and requiring defense [Watson\n1975]. As Watson notes, the strength of one\u2019s preference\nneedn\u2019t at all reflect that one values it or the degree to which\none values it.)\n\nThe threshold conception is not tied to any particular account of the\ngrounds for moral status. Different grounds, discussed in section 5,\nmight involve membership in a group, the capacity for sentience, and\nso on. To put the threshold conception more broadly, so as to cover\nany ground for moral status, and any degree of moral status, whether\nhigh or low, one could state it thus: for any X that is a sufficient\nground for having n-degree of moral status, this status is not altered\nby factors such as how much of X a being has, how well it displays X,\nor the number of other features sufficient for n or lower degrees of\nmoral status the being possesses. The threshold conception leaves it\nopen whether having some other feature (e.g., parts of X or something\nlesser but akin to X) might be grounds for a lesser degree of moral\nstatus and whether yet other features (e.g., more complex capacities)\nmight be grounds for higher degrees of moral status. FMS is a central\nexample of this approach: all beings that meet the threshold\nqualifications for FMS have the same status and this status is\nfull.\n\nIn contrast, the scalar conception highlights the importance of, for\nexample, how often and how well one can exhibit or exercise a capacity\nto value. Put alternatively, if the possession of a generic capacity\nto value makes a difference to moral status, then the possession of\ndifferent specific levels of this capacity (e.g., being able to value\na greater number valuable things or to value them more fully) confers\ndifferential status. As Arneson (1999) would put it, a higher degree\nof the capacity entails a higher status. And so, two beings with the\nsame (generic) capacity might not have equal moral status; only two\nbeings with the same (specific) capacity level would have equal moral\nstatus. Arneson also thinks that if two beings have the specific\ncapacity, but only one of them ever exercises it, then that being will\nhave a higher moral status.\n\nKeep in mind that, as with the threshold conception, the scalar\nconception of moral status is not tied to any particular account of\nwhat grounds moral status \u2013 it applies to any X that is proposed\nto ground moral status. Moreover, a scalar conception might not only\npay attention to (i) how much of X a being has or displays, as\ndescribed in the case above with the capacity to value. It also might\nattend to (ii) how many morally relevant features a being has. One\nversion of (ii) focuses on features that on their own give rise to the\nsame degree of moral status (Arneson [1999] alludes to such a view).\nSuppose, for example, that the capacity to value and being a member of\nthe human species each on their own grounded n-degree of moral status.\nA scalar approach might hold that if a being has both these features,\nit has a higher moral status than a being that has only one. Another\nversion of (ii) would allow for cases like this: suppose the capacity\nfor preferences grounds a certain degree of moral status, while the\ncapacity for consciousness grounds a lesser moral status. Yet, someone\nof a scalar frame of mind might think that the two together give a\nslightly higher degree of status than the capacity for preferences\nalone.\n\nLastly, the scalar conception might consider that a being\u2019s\nmoral status might be greater, not because it has additional less\nsophisticated morally relevant features, as in the previous example,\nbut (iii) because the being has additional more advanced morally\nrelevant features. (iii) works this way. Suppose the capacity to\nemploy means-ends reasoning combined with being a member of the human\nspecies grounded n-degree status. The capacity to value is more\nsophisticated than the capacity to employ means-ends reasoning. Then,\naccording to (iii), a human being with the capacity to value has an\neven higher moral status.\n\nWhile both threshold and scalar conceptions of moral status allow for\ndegrees of moral status, each faces its own set of difficulties. For\nexample, it is not enough for those who hold the threshold view to\nstipulate that, for example, the capacity to do an activity well does\nnot affect one\u2019s status. Once the importance of some feature,\nsuch as the capacity to value, is highlighted, it seems that not only\nthe possession of the capacity but also how well one can exercise it\nis morally relevant to one\u2019s status. This is especially\ncompelling when we compare, for example, an ordinary human\nadult\u2019s capacity to set many ends (i.e, to value and pursue many\nobjects and states of affairs) with the capacity of an impoverished\nbeing who, in its lifetime, \u201ccan set just a few ends and make\njust a few choices based on considering two or three simple\nalternatives\u201d (Arneson 1999, pp. 119\u2013120). The problems is\nessentially the same regardless of whether the capacity is actual,\npotential, or incompletely realized (e.g., when we compare an\nunimpaired baby\u2019s potential \u2013 ability to have an ability\n\u2013 to set many ends with an impaired baby whose potential is far\nmore limited).\n\nAnalogous problems also arise for accounts on which the status\nconferring feature is species membership or being in a special\nrelationship. Possession of the features that qualify one for species\nmembership may be incomplete and a matter of degree (consider Turner\nSyndrome where one is missing or partially missing the X chromosome)\nand relationships can be stronger or weaker. The strength of a\nrelationship might depend, for example, on how robustly one\ninstantiates the features defining the relationship (e.g., how\nrobustly one qualifies as a member of a community) or on how well one\nactively relates (e.g., a child is a more active participant in a\nrelationship than a fetus).\n\nFurthermore, on views that allow for multiple threshold qualifications\nfor the same degree of status (e.g., the capacity to value and being a\nmember of the human species), whether an individual meets only one or\nboth qualifications seems morally relevant to the degree of their\nstatus. Also, some individuals possess features more advanced than the\nthreshold qualification. Threshold views need to provide an\nexplanation for why such differences do not matter.\n\nAdditionally, the threshold conception allows for the possibility of\ndiscontinuities in degrees of moral status that might seem arbitrary.\nThe difference, for example, between a being with a capacity, but who\ncan only exercise it very poorly (e.g., a being that can recognize\nonly one value among many and can only recognize this value on very\nrare occasions), and a being without this capacity (who cannot value\nbut can only form preferences) might not seem to be very great. And\nyet, if the capacity to value grounds FMS, then the former being will\nhave FMS while the latter will have considerably lesser or perhaps no\nmoral status. The advocate of the threshold view could respond that if\nthis capacity is important, then a being with a capacity to do it\npoorly has achieved something important compared to a being without\nthis capacity. In addition, if there are multiple grounds for lesser\ndegrees of moral status (e.g., the capacity to feel pain, the capacity\nto have preferences, the capacity to feel emotions, etc.), which\nthreshold views could allow, then this might remove any large gap in\nstatus between beings with that capacity and those who lack it but who\nhave other capacities conferring only somewhat lesser status. See\nMcMahan (2008) for related discussion.\n\nScalar conceptions, on the other hand, can easily account for\ncontinuous lesser degrees of moral status, but may defy commonsense\nintuitions. For example, if intelligence grounded FMS, then the scalar\nconception would claim that those who are more intelligent have a\nstronger right not to be killed than those who are not quite as\nintelligent. But this is highly at odds with the commonsense intuition\nthat all such beings have an equally strong right not to be killed\n(see Wikler 2009 for a discussion of whether degrees of intelligence\nare relevant to civil rights). Distinguishing and elevating the moral\nstatus of cognitively unimpaired adult humans compared to other\nanimals thus comes at the price of denying that all cognitively\nunimpaired adult humans have equal moral status.\n",
