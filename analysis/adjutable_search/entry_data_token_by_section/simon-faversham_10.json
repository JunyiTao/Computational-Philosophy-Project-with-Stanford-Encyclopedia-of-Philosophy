    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Universals and the Principle of Individuation\n5.1 Universals and the Principle of Individuation\n\nAccording to Simon, universality is a notion the intellect attributes\nto some quiddities that exhibit the capacity to inform several\nindividuals. Take, for instance, Socrates. Socrates presents himself\nas a being endowed with reason and sensation. The soul realizes that\nreason and sensation are found in multiple individuals, so it takes\nbeing a rational animal\u2014being a man\u2014as a unified thing\nthat is proper to many individuals. So, on one hand, being a\nman really inheres in Socrates, and as such it exists only\nparticularly. On the other hand, the intellect considers being a\nman as a unity that can occur in several individuals, and as such\nbeing a man is a universal, and more specifically, a species.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Avicenna, Simon considers two modes of\nbeing of quiddities: a particular mode in individuals and a mental\nmode as the content of concepts to which the notion of universality is\napplied. In this sense, universals are merely notional or\nintellectual, as everything that exists in the external world is\nparticular:\n\n\n\u2026 man according to existence outside the soul is not a species,\nbecause according to external existence it is particular, but it is a\nspecies according to existence in the soul. In fact, the intellect\ngrounds the intention of the species in the consideration of the\nnature of man as one in many. (In Isag.:\n q.4)[10]\n\n\nIn other words, universality is a mode of understanding such\nquiddities as exhibit the capacity to inform several individuals:\n\n\n\u2026 we must not posit a universal man because he exists\nuniversally. Rather, [man] is universal because it is understood\nuniversally, when [the intellect] sets aside all the individuating\nconditions. (In Isag.:\n q.5)[11]\n\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the quiddity need not actually inform\nseveral individuals. Indeed, Simon also holds that the intellect can\napply the notion of species to a quiddity informing only one\nindividual, as in the case of the sun or the moon. Simon grounds his\nposition not only on the examples of these celestial bodies but also\nwith the following argument:\n\n If a species required several actual instances, this would be\neither as regards essence or as regards being.\n Not as regards essence, because being instantiated in one or in\nmany is not included in the definition of a quiddity.\n Nor as regards being, because from the example of celestial\nbodies, it is evident that a quiddity can sufficiently be in only one\nindividual.\n Therefore, a species does not require several actual instances of\nthe quiddity. (In Isag.: q.26)\n\n\nIn sublunary beings, however, the species is in fact always\ninstantiated in several individuals. Simon\u2019s explanation of this\nfact also reveals his position on the principle of individuation.\nAccording to him, in sublunary beings a single individual is never the\nactualization of the whole matter that can be actualized by its\nnature:\n\n\nWhy are there several instances of sublunary beings? \u2026 because\nall the matter pertaining to one species is not found in one\nindividual. \u2026 But in superior beings all the matter pertaining\nto one species is found in one individual. (In Isag.:\n q.26)[12]\n\n\nThe multiplication of individuals of the same kind is caused by the\nexistence of several chunks of matter that can be actualized by the\nsame nature through a quantitative division of matter (In\nIsag.: q.26). But this is only the principle of individuation of\nsublunary, material, beings. Superior, immaterial, beings are\nfundamentally individual, as Simon tells us in his commentary on\nDe anima:\n\n\n\u2026 particulars are twofold: some by matter, some by subsistence\n(the intelligences are particular in the latter way). Hence, I say\nthat my intellect is particular, not by matter, but by subsistence,\ninasmuch as it is a power subsistent per se and not the act of a body.\n(In De an.:\n q.8)[13]\n\n\nSimon seems to hold a twofold account of individuation: there is\nindividuation by a quantitative division of matter, which explains the\nindividuation of material beings; and individuation by subsistence,\nwhich explains the individuation of immaterial beings such as\ncelestial bodies, intelligences and the human intellect. Simon\nundoubtedly introduces his twofold account to circumvent the\nAverroistic solution to the question of the individuation of superior\nbeings via the introduction of spiritual matter.\n",
