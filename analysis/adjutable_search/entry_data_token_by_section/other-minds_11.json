    "main_text": "Thinking about Mind Prior to the Twentieth Century || Before Descartes\n4.3 Another History\n\nWhile philosophers in the West trace their lineage back to ancient\nGreece, it is worth remembering that philosophical ideas were also\nbeing discussed elsewhere in the world. One tradition that has a long\nhistory of concern with issues to do with the minds of others is the\nclassical Indian tradition. While one should not read texts from other\nphilosophical traditions only to find parallels with one\u2019s own,\nit is striking that these early Eastern philosophers may be thought to\nhave grappled with many of the same issues concerning others as have\nphilosophers in the Western tradition. It is possible to find\ndiscussion of both epistemological and conceptual problems in\nconnection with others in these texts. There are two important works\nin this tradition devoted to questions concerning others, one by\nDharmak\u012brti in the seventh century and another by Ratnakirti in\nthe 11th. Indeed, Sharma (1985) writes that\n\u201cDharmak\u012brti is perhaps the first ever thinker to make a\nsystematic attempt to come to grips with this problem [of other\nminds]\u201d. Dharmak\u012brti is an idealist who denies the reality\nof the external world and whose work, therefore, is open to the charge\nof solipsism. In his Proof of the Existence of Other Streams of\nConsciousness, Dharmak\u012brti first points out that the mind of\nanother is imperceptible; he then goes on to argue that other minds\nare inferred from observed speech and action. Many find in the writing\nof Dharmakirti an argument not dissimilar to the one found in the\nwriting of John Stuart Mill (see, for example, Chakrabarti 2020, Pt.\n3) Dharmak\u012brti is careful to acknowledge that there are limits to\nour understanding of others (we cannot know what it is like for them)\n(Inami 2001). Ganeri (2012) suggests that what we find in\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s text is \u201ca sort of argument from\nanalogy\u201d for the existence of others. Responding to\nDharmak\u012brti here, Ratnakirti points out the difficulties in\nreasoning to the mind of another that one can never be in a position\nto verify. In effect, Ratnakirti argues that other minds cannot be\ntaken to exist, and solipsism must be accepted. However, Ratnakirti is\ncareful to draw a distinction between conventional and ultimate\nexistence\u2014while other minds do not exist ultimately, they do\nexist conventionally. It is this conventional existence that explains\nour actions with regards to others. According to Ganeri, we can also\nfind in Ratnakirti\u2019s work arguments to show that it is not\npossible even to form a conception of another mind (2012: 203). This\nproblem is particularly pressing for the Buddhist philosopher for, as\nGaneri reminds us (2012: 202), without a conception of others it is a\nquestion how one can cultivate compassion.\n",
