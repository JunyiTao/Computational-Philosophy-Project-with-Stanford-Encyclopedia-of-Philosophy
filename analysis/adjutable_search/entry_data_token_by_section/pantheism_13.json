    "main_text": "Pantheism and the Problem of Evil\n14. Pantheism and the Problem of Evil\n\nHistorically one of the strongest and most persistent objections to\npantheism is that, because of its all-encompassing nature, it seems\ninhospitable to the differentiations of value that characterise life.\nIn what might be thought of as a pantheistic version of the problem of\nevil, it is challenged that if God includes everything and God is\nperfect or good, then everything which exists ought to be perfect or\ngood; a conclusion which seems wholly counter to our common experience\nthat much in the world is very far from being so. Or to put the\nargument slightly differently, if whatever we do or however things\nturn out must be deemed the action of God, how can our pantheistic\nbelief demand of us any specific duty? The only alternative\nconclusion, if we wish to hold on to the difference between what is\ngood and what is bad, would seem to be equally unattractive claim that\na universe containing both values, in itself\npossesses neither; the pantheistic deity in its own being\nlies beyond good and evil.\n\nTo point out that classical theism faces its own difficulties over\nevil and God\u2019s providence, while it may level the playing field,\ndoes nothing in itself to help solve the puzzle, and pantheists\nthemselves have suggested a variety of explanations or theodicies. (1)\nThe most popular model for dealing with evil is found in the\nphilosophy of Spinoza who regards both error and evil as distortions\nthat result from the fragmentary view of finite creatures; phenomena\nreal enough to the finite beings who experience them but which would\ndisappear in the widest and final vision of God. In this he was, of\ncourse, developing the Stoic sense that if we could see the world as\nGod does, as the perfectly harmonious embodiment of the\nlogos, we would recognise how its apparent defects in fact\ncontribute to the goodness of the whole. (2) It may be responded also\nthat the objection that pantheism councils moral indifference is based\non a modal confusion, comparable to that made by the proponent of\nlogical determinism. If pantheism amounts to a doctrine of providence,\nit is true that what actually happens will be for the best, but it\ncertainly does not follow from that that whatever else might\nhave happened would have been for the best, and it\npossible that part at least of the perfection of the cosmos comes\nabout through our own individual moral choices.\n",
