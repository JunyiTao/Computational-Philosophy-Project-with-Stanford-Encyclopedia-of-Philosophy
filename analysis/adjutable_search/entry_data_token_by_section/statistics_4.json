    "main_text": "Classical statistics\n3. Classical statistics\n\nThe collection of procedures that may be grouped under classical\nstatistics is vast and multi-faceted. By and large, classical\nstatistical procedures share the feature that they only rely on\nprobability assignments over sample spaces. As indicated, an important\nmotivation for this is that those probabilities can be interpreted as\nfrequencies, from which the term of frequentist\nstatistics originates.  Classical statistical procedures are\ntypically defined by some function over sample space, where this\nfunction depends, often exclusively, on the distributions that the\nhypotheses under consideration assign to the sample space. For the\nrange of samples that may be obtained, the function then points to one\nof the hypotheses, or perhaps to a set of them, as being in some sense\nthe best fit with that sample. Or, conversely, it discards candidate\nhypotheses that render the sample too improbable. \nIn sum, classical procedures employ the data to narrow down a set\nof hypotheses. Put in such general terms, it becomes apparent that\nclassical procedures provide a response to the problem of\ninduction. The data are used to get from a weak general statement\nabout the target system to a stronger one, namely from a set of\ncandidate hypotheses to a subset of them. The central concern in the\nphilosophy of statistics is how we are to understand these procedures,\nand how we might justify them. Notice that the pattern of classical\nstatistics resembles that of eliminative induction: in view\nof the data we discard some of the candidate hypotheses. Indeed\nclassical statistics is often seen in loose association with Popper's\nfalsificationism, but this association is somewhat misleading. In\nclassical procedures statistical hypotheses are discarded when they\nrender the observed sample too improbable, which of course differs\nfrom discarding hypotheses that deem the observed sample\nimpossible.\n",
