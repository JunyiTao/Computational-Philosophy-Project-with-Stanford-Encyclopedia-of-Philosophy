    "main_text": "Jury Theorems and Diversity || Diversity versus competence heterogeneity\n3.1 Diversity versus competence heterogeneity\n\nDiversity is describable as plurality in sources and backgrounds:\nindividuals reason differently, hold different perspectives, use\ndifferent information, etc. Although diversity is a multi-dimensional\nand largely informal property, it manifests itself in jury models. As\nwhat? There are two natural candidates: competence heterogeneity and\nindependence. The relation to competence heterogeneity will be\nclarified first\n (Section 3.3\n turns to independence).\n\nDiversity does not imply competence\nheterogeneity\u2014fortunately, as otherwise the three jury theorems\nabove would exclude diversity in the homogeneity clause of their\ncompetence assumptions. Diversity does not imply differences in\ncompetence levels, but differences in competence\nsources. Even under high diversity, members could be correct\nwith identical probabilities\u2014for different reasons.\n\nConversely, competence heterogeneity tends to imply diversity, i.e.,\nnon-diversity tends to imply competence homogeneity, because members\nwith exactly same background, same information, same reasoning, etc.,\nshould be equally competent.\n\nIn sum, competence homogeneity is a systematic feature of non-diverse\ngroups, but not vice versa.\n",
