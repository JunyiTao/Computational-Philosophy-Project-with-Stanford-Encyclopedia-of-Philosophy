    "main_text": "God || Bonaventure\u2019s Illumination Argument\n5.1 Bonaventure\u2019s Illumination Argument\n\nThe transcendental that initially opens up arguments for the existence\nof God is \u201ctruth\u201d. Bonaventure bases his illumination\nargument on the epistemological sense of truth, inspired by\nAugustine\u2019s memorable description of his own inward route to\nGod:\n\n\nAnd admonished by all this to return to myself, I entered inside\nmyself with you leading and I able to do so because you had become my\nhelper. And I entered and with the eye of my soul, such as it was, I\nsaw above that eye of my soul, above my mind, an unchangeable\nlight.\u2026Whoever knows the truth knows this\nlight\u2026. O eternal truth and true love and loved\neternity, you are my God; to you do I sigh both night and day.\n(Augustine, Confessiones, 7.10 [CCSL 27: 103])\n\n\nIn his Commentary on the Sentences, Bonaventure extracted\nfrom Augustine\u2019s stirring rhetoric the logical core of the\nillumination argument, reducing it to plain and dispassionate\nsyllogisms, as he had learned from his teachers in Arts at Paris:\n\n\nAll correct understanding proves and concludes to the truth\nof the divine being, because knowledge of the divine truth is\nimpressed on every soul, and all knowledge comes about through the\ndivine truth. Every affirmative proposition proves and concludes to\nthat truth. For every such proposition posits something. And when\nsomething is posited, the true is posited; and when the true\nis posited that truth which is the cause of the true is also\nposited. (In I Sent. d. 8, pars 1, art. 1, q. 2, resp.\n[Quaracchi I: 155a]; trans. Houser and Noone 2013, 108 [modified])\n\n\nBonaventure understood that the step from a true proposition to divine\ntruth is a large one, so he advocates a moderate illuminationist\nposition, one that depends on both divine and created causes.\nBonaventure\u2019s Augustinian illumination theory avoids the\nproblems of Platonism, which turns knowing the world into knowing God,\nand the problems of Muslim illuminationism, which thought a creature\ncould do what it takes the infinite mind of God to accomplish.\n\n\nFor certain knowledge, eternal reason is necessarily\ninvolved as a regulative and motive cause, however, not as the sole\ncause or in its full clarity, but along with a created cause\nand as contuited by us \u201cin part\u201d in accord with our\npresent state of life. (De scientia Christi q. 4 concl.\n[Quaracchi V: 23]; trans. Hayes 1992, 134 [modified])\n\n\nTo explain the contribution of the \u201ccreated\u201d causes of\nknowledge, Bonaventure noted that the content of human\nknowledge comes from four kinds of \u201ccreated\u201d causes: the\npassive intellect within the individual soul as material\ncause, for it receives knowledge; the individual agent intellect as\nefficient cause, for it abstracts the content of knowledge\nfrom sensation; the essence of an individual creature known as\nformal cause, for the creature is \u201cwhat\u201d we know;\nand epistemological truth as end. These \u201cproper\nprinciples\u201d of knowledge do not involve God (In II\nSent. d. 24, pars 1, art. 2, q. 4 [Quaracchi II: 567\u2013571];\ncf. J. Quinn 1973: 345\u2013352).\n\nAbove and beyond these \u201ccreated\u201d causes, knowledge also\nrequires an \u201ceternal\u201d cause. In the mental acts of\nabstracting universals and arguing inductively, the human mind\ngeneralizes well beyond the data of our experience. It is one thing to\nbe able to generalize so, quite another to be sure one has succeeded.\nIntuition into the essence of a creature involves truths that are not\nonly universal, but also necessary and certain. God is acquainted with\nthe full extension of any universal since the divine idea of any truth\nconsists in knowledge of that truth in absolutely all its actual\nand possible instantiations. The infinite extension of\nGod\u2019s knowledge is what makes divine understanding certain, and\nthis certainty in the divine mind is on loan, so to speak, to the\nhuman mind.\n\n\nIf full knowledge requires recourse to a truth which is fully\nimmutable and stable, and to a light which is completely\ninfallible, it is necessary for this sort of knowledge to have\nrecourse to the heavenly art as to light and truth: a light, I\nsay, which gives infallibility to the [created] knower, and a\ntruth which gives immutability to the [created] object of knowledge.\n(De scientia Christi q. 4, concl. [Quaracchi V: 23]; trans.\nHayes 1992, 135 [modified])\n\n\nHere Bonaventure makes more precise Augustine\u2019s\n\u201clight\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d. They are the two sides of\ncertitude, so it is the certainty, and only the certainty, found in\nhuman knowledge that requires divine illumination; all other features\nof human knowledge\u2014abstraction, universality,\ncorrespondence\u2014come from created causes.\n",
