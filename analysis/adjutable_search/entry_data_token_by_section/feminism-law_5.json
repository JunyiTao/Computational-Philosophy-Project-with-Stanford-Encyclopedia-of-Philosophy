    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || Human Rights\n1.5 Human Rights\n\nHuman rights theory is another central area of concern for feminist\nphilosophers of law. By the end of the 20th century many\nsocieties had officially rejected sexual inequality in law, at least\nas a matter of basic human rights. Human rights are now said to apply\nequally to women and equal protection of the law is seen as applying\nequally to men and women (United Nations Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination Against Women [CEDAW] 1979). Feminists\nhail these developments but remain concerned that in many societies\ncommitments to human rights are shallow and laws reflecting\npatriarchal environments and cultures continue to thrive and flourish.\n\n\nIn addition, some feminists are directly critical of the role of\nrights. Feminists associated with the critical legal studies movement,\nfor example, see rights as potentially masking underlying\nrelationships of power and domination (Scales 1986). Other feminists,\nsuch as those associated with critical race theory, voice concerns\nthat dominance feminists assume an essentialism that silences the\nvoices of African-American women (Harris 1990) and that rights may\nprovide crucial protection to victims of discrimination and oppression\n(Williams 1992). Similar debates concern rights in international law\nwith liberal feminists defending the gains achieved through the\ninternational recognition of human rights and critical theorists\njoining with some third world feminists to decry the structural bias\nof international law and the role of rights in continuing to mask\noppression (Engle 2005; Otto 2005). \n",
