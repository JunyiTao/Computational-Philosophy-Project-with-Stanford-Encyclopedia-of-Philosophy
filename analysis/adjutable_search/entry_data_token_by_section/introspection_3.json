Introspective Versus Non-Introspective Accounts of Self-Knowledge\n\nThis section will outline several approaches to self-knowledge. Not\nall deserve to be called introspective, but an understanding of\nintrospection requires an appreciation of this diversity of\napproaches\u2014some for the sake of the contrast they provide to\nintrospection proper and some because it\u2019s disputable whether\nthey should be classified as introspective. These approaches are not\nexclusive. Surely there is more than one process by means of which we\ncan obtain self-knowledge. Unavoidably, some of the same territory\ncovered here is also covered, rather differently, in the entry on\n self-knowledge.\n",
