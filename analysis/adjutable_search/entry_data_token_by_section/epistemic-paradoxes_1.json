    "main_text": "The Surprise Test Paradox || Self-defeating prophecies and pragmatic paradoxes\n1.1 Self-defeating prophecies and pragmatic paradoxes\n\nIn the twentieth century, the first published reaction to the surprise\ntext paradox was to endorse the student\u2019s elimination argument.\nD. J. O\u2019Connor (1948) regarded the teacher\u2019s announcement\nas self-defeating. If the teacher had not announced that there would\nbe a surprise test, the teacher would have been able to give the\nsurprise test. The pedagogical moral of the paradox would then be that\nif you want to give a surprise test do not announce your intention to\nyour students!\n\nMore precisely, O\u2019Connor compared the teacher\u2019s\nannouncement to utterances such as \u2018I am not speaking\nnow\u2019. Although these utterances are consistent, they\n\u201ccould not conceivably be true in any circumstances\u201d\n(O\u2019Connor 1948, 358). L. Jonathan Cohen (1950) agreed and\nclassified the announcement as a pragmatic paradox. He defined a\npragmatic paradox to be a statement that is falsified by its own\nutterance. The teacher overlooked how the manner in which a statement\nis disseminated can doom it to falsehood.\n\nCohen\u2019s classification is too monolithic. True, the\nteacher\u2019s announcement does compromise one aspect of the\nsurprise: Students now know that there will be a test. But this\ncompromise is not itself enough to make the announcement\nself-falsifying. The existence of a surprise test has been\nrevealed but that allows surviving uncertainty as to which\nday the test will occur. The announcement of a forthcoming surprise\naims at changing uninformed ignorance into action-guiding awareness of\nignorance. A student who misses the announcement does not realize that\nthere is a test. If no one passes on the news about the surprise test,\nthe student with simple ignorance will be less prepared than\nclassmates who know they do not know the day of the test.\n\nAnnouncements are made to serve different goals simultaneously.\nCompetition between accuracy and helpfulness makes it possible for an\nannouncement to be self-fulfilling by being self-defeating. Consider a\nweatherman who warns \u2018The midnight tsunami will cause fatalities\nalong the shore\u2019. Because of the warning, spectacle-seekers make\na special trip to witness the wave. Some drown. The weatherman\u2019s\nannouncement succeeds as a prediction by backfiring as a warning.\n",
