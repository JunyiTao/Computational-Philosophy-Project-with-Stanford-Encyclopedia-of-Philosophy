    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus\n3. Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus\n\nAfter completing Nuptials, Camus began to work on a planned\ntriptych on the Absurd: a novel, which became The Stranger, a\nphilosophical essay, eventually titled The Myth of Sisyphus,\nand a play, Caligula. These were completed and sent off from\nAlgeria to the Paris publisher in September 1941. Although Camus would\nhave preferred to see them appear together, even in a single volume,\nthe publisher for both commercial reasons and because of the paper\nshortage caused by war and occupation, released The Stranger\nin June 1942 and The Myth of Sisyphus in October. Camus kept\nworking on the play, which finally appeared in book form two years\nlater (Lottman, 264\u201367).\n",
