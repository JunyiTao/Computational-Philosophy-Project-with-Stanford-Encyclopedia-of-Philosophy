    "main_text": "Probability: Now and then\n1. Probability: Now and then\n\nModern notions of probability are quantitative (H\u00e1jek 2011).\nThey underlie the representation of probabilities by real (initially:\nfractional) numbers from the interval between 0 and 1. On this basis,\na probability calculus with its own mathematical rules (the Kolmogorov\naxioms) has\n arisen.[1]\n The present mathematics of probability marks the end-point of a\ndevelopment which began in the middle of the seventeenth century with\nthe calculation of chances in games of fortune by Pascal, Fermat, and\nHuygens. These early calculations were considerably refined in the\neighteenth century by the Bernoullis, Montmort, De Moivre, Laplace,\nBayes, and others (Daston 1988; Hacking 2006; Hald 2003). Modern\nconceptualizations of probability emerged at the same time. They\nevolved around the ideas of a ratio of possibilities, a relative\nfrequency of events, a degree of belief, or a degree of\nconfirmation.\n\nPre-modern notions of probability were very different (Franklin 2016).\nNo pre-modern notion of probability was numerical. A calculus\nof probabilities simply did not exist before the seventeenth\n century.[2]\n Pre-modern probability was a qualitative predicate mainly applied to\npropositions (e.g., by calling an opinion probable), but extending to\nother subject matters as well. The use of the word\n\u2018probable\u2019 in ordinary language still resembles this older\nusage to some extent (Franklin 2001, 126; Franklin 2013; Hacking 2006,\n18). Yet, whereas the mathematics of probability was invented in the\nearly modern era, some continuities in the meaning(s) of probability\nexist. These continuities will be discussed in Section 6. Until that\npoint, it is best to forget the connotations of modern notions of\nprobability and to approach medieval probability-related terms without\nmodern preconceptions. For their vocabulary, medieval and Renaissance\nauthors could draw on a well-stocked ancient Greek and Roman store of\nprobability-related terms. In consequence, a variety of Latin terms\nwere in use, which are today translated as \u2018probable\u2019,\n\u2018plausible\u2019, \u2018reputable\u2019\n(probabilis); \u2018truth-like\u2019, \u2018apparently\ntrue\u2019 (verisimilis); \u2018credible\u2019,\n\u2018worthy of belief\u2019 (credibilis,\nopinabilis); or \u2018most often\u2019,\n\u2018frequently\u2019 (ut frequenter). Modern readers may\nnot always find it obvious that these terms relate to probability;\nbut, in fact, they are highly relevant for its conceptual evolution.\nUp to the nineteenth century, when philosophers spoke about\nprobability their claims were still often rooted in medieval notions\nof probability.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance philosophers used probability-related\nvocabulary; but they did not analyze the underlying concepts in depth,\nat least in comparison with the thoroughness of their investigations\ninto the notions of knowledge or science (scientia).\nProbability-related terms were usually introduced in passing, and the\nmost differentiated treatments extended to a folio page at best.\nNevertheless, issues of probability were not peripheral to medieval\nthought. Probability-related terms and concepts played an enormous\nrole in the regulation of everyday conduct and in many arts and\nsciences. Rhetoric and dialectic were by definition concerned with\npersuasion, credibility, and probability. Yet medieval thinkers were\nalso highly aware that many claims in jurisprudence, theology, and\nmedicine could not be derived with certainty from indubitable\npremises. Hence, arguments in these fields had to rely more often than\nnot on probable reasoning. The notorious disagreements between\nscholastic academics in their fields of inquiry, nourished and\nrepresented by the practice of scholastic disputation, further\nincreased the demand for probable reasoning. Wherever disagreement was\nlicit and impossible to extirpate by argument, the claims of all sides\ncounted as merely probable. Since medieval theologians and lawyers\nwere no more in agreement concerning the ascription of sins (or of\nmoral actions) than on other matters, the guidance of human conduct by\nconfessors was also a matter of probability. In this domain, the\nregulation of decisions of conscience relied on a systematic framework\nof probable reasoning and decision in conditions of uncertainty. In\nshort, for a satisfactory understanding of the medieval intellectual\nedifice, inspection of the uses of probability seems\nindispensable.\n\nThis is true for the medieval period, the Renaissance, and in\ndifferent ways for early modern scholasticism until the eighteenth\ncentury. We should not assume, however, that the uses and\nunderstanding of probability remained unchanged throughout this long\nspan of time. For this reason, the period from roughly 1200\u20131500\nis singled out here for discussion. It is the period of mature\nmedieval scholasticism and covers much of the Renaissance. In the\nsixteenth century, the discourse on probability underwent significant\nchanges, on the scholastic as well as the humanist side. This early\nmodern discourse needs to be clearly differentiated from its medieval\nprecursor and is therefore excluded from consideration here (but see\nthe references in Sections 4.3 and 6).\n\nWithin the period under consideration, a distinction between\nscholastic and humanist uses of probability can be made. This is not\nto say that there was a big divide between them. The same terms were\nused by scholastics and humanists with similar meanings. The normative\nand regulatory uses of probability, however, were anchored in\nscholastic theology and jurisprudence; therefore, they are in the\nforeground here. At least some Renaissance humanists used\nprobability-related terms differently from the scholastic mainstream;\nand these differences will be addressed in Section 5.\n\nThat the conceptualization of probability was not exclusively a\nEuropean affair also deserves attention. Many cultures around the\nworld tilled the conceptual field of probability, in antiquity and not\nleast in the medieval era. The question of the extent to which\nnon-Western notions and uses of probability shaped the treatment of\nprobability in the Latin Middle Ages (or vice versa) cannot be\nanswered here; however, some of the scholastic authors discussed below\nexplicitly referred to Islamic sources in their accounts of\nprobability.\n",
