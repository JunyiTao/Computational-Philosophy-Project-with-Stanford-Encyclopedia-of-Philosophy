    "main_text": "Ideology || A Critical Account\n6.1 A Critical Account\n\nThe account of ideology contained in Marx\u2019s writings is\nregularly portrayed as a crucial element of his intellectual legacy.\nIt has been identified as among his \u201cmost influential\u201d\nideas (Elster 1986: 168), and acclaimed as \u201cthe most\nfertile\u201d part of his social and political theory (Leiter 2004:\n84). Not least, these views on ideology are said to constitute\nMarx\u2019s claim to a place\u2014alongside Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844\u20131900) and Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939)\u2014as one of\nthe \u201cmasters of suspicion\u201d; that is, as an author whose\nwork casts doubt on the transparency of our everyday understandings of\nboth our own identity and the social world we inhabit (Ricouer 1970:\n32\u201333).\n\nGiven this enthusiastic reception, it can come as something of a\nsurprise to turn to Marx\u2019s writings and discover how little they\ncontain about ideology, and how inchoate and opaque those infrequent\nand passing observations on that topic are. There are, of course, some\nfamous quotations, not least from The German Ideology\nmanuscripts. The references there to ideology as involving an\n\u201cinversion\u201d of the relation between individuals and their\ncircumstances, perhaps analogous to the workings of a \u201ccamera\nobscura\u201d\u2014an optical device which projected an image of its\nsurroundings, upside down but preserving perspective, onto a screen\ninside\u2014have often mesmerised commentators but not always\ngenerated much genuine illumination (MECW 5: 36). The point\nshould not be exaggerated, but these striking images notwithstanding,\nthere is no clear and sustained discussion of ideology in the Marxian\ncorpus.\n\nMany commentators maintain that the search for a single model of\nideology in his work has to be given up. Indeed, there is something of\nan \u201carms race\u201d in the literature, as commentators discover\ntwo, three, even five, competing models of ideology in Marx\u2019s\nwritings (Mepham 1979; Wood 1981 [2004]; Rosen 1996). Most\nsurprisingly, it seems that some licence can be found in Marx\u2019s\ncorpus for three very different ways of thinking about what ideology\nis. There is textual evidence of his variously utilising: a\n\u201cdescriptive\u201d account of ideology involving a broadly\nanthropological study of the beliefs and rituals characteristic of\ncertain groups; a \u201cpositive\u201d account of ideology as a\n\u201cworldview\u201d providing the members of a group with a sense\nof meaning and identity; and a \u201ccritical\u201d account seeking\nto liberate individuals from certain false and misleading forms of\nunderstanding (Geuss 1981: 4\u201326).\n\nIt is the last of these\u2014the critical account rather than either\nof the two \u201cnon-critical\u201d accounts\u2014which is central\nto his wider social and political theory, but this account is itself\nsubject to some considerable interpretative disagreement. Marx\u2019s\ntheory of ideology is usually portrayed as an element in what might be\ncalled Marx\u2019s sociology, as distinct from his philosophical\nanthropology say, or his theory of history (although complexly related\nto the latter).\n",
