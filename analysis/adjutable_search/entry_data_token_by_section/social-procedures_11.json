Strategic Reasoning and Cooperation\n\nThe large field of game theory is extensively explained in other\nlemmas in this encyclopedia (see among others the entry on\n game theory).\n This field of research has been very active since the appearance of\nthe seminal book (Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). Similarly, social\nchoice theory and in particular voting theory (see entries on\n social choice theory\n and\n voting methods)\n were already thriving fields of research long before the term social\nsoftware came along.\n\nIt is useful to investigate how formal methods and an algorithmic\nperspective can help solve societal problems. For example, in the case\nof the famous prisoner\u2019s dilemma (see entry on\n prisoner\u2019s dilemma)\n it is interesting to try to design policies that make cheating the\nother agent less profitable by penalizing it. Notice that this\n\u201csocial software engineering\u201d takes place at the\nmeta-level, on top of the level of the prisoners choosing their\nstrategies (van Eijck 2015).\n\nA related recent trend in game theory that is relevant for social\nsoftware, is to step away from solution concepts such as the Nash\nequilibrium and instead to focus on the process of rational\ndeliberation: the \u201ctheory of play\u201d (see van Benthem,\nPacuit and Roy, 2011, as well as the entry\n logics for analyzing games).\n This type of research delineates both the normative principles\nguiding the players\u2019 strategic reasoning, and the psychological\nphenomena explaining the differences between predicted and observed\nbehavior in games (Camerer 2003; Ghosh and Verbrugge 2018; Pacuit\n2015; Meijering et al. 2012, 2014; Top et al. 2018).\n\nIn Section 4.2 we briefly discussed the role of the study of knowledge\nand belief when analyzing social procedures. In this vein, the field\nof epistemic game theory focuses on agents\u2019 beliefs about other\nagents\u2019 strategies and those agents\u2019 beliefs about other\nagents\u2019 strategies, and so on, up to the idealized case of\ncommon knowledge among a group of agents that they are all rational\n(see the entry on\n epistemic foundations of game theory;\n Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014).\n\nIt turns out that in voting theory in particular, it is useful to\ndesign a logic to explicitly model the knowledge that agents bring to\nbear when they are voting. It is especially interesting to model what\nhappens in a group when agents vote strategically by misrepresenting\ntheir own preferences in order to manipulate the outcome (van Eijck\n2015; van Ditmarsch et al. 2012).\n\nIn recent years in the research area of multi-agent systems, formal\napproaches to social procedures have also been used to help design\nactual software, for example for cooperative problem solving in teams,\ncoalition formation, knowledge fusion, auctions, and negotiations\namong software agents (Bulling et al. 2015; Chalkiadakis et al. 2011;\nDunin-K\u0119plicz and Verbrugge 2010; Pauly 2002; Shoham and\nLeyton-Brown 2009; Vazirani et al. 2007). This literature is mostly\nnormative in nature.\n\nIn contrast, another fascinating area of research, evolutionary game\ntheory (see entry on\n evolutionary game theory),\n investigates how features like altruism, social norms, moral behavior\nand cooperation could actually have evolved. This area combines both\nnormative and descriptive work (Axelrod 1984; Bowles and Gintis 2011;\nSigmund 2010). As a particular social software contribution to this\narea, G\u00e4rdenfors (2012) characterized how much cognition and\ncommunication are required for several kinds of cooperation, from\nsimple flocking behavior, through reciprocal altruism\n(\u201cI\u2019ll scratch your back if you scratch mine\u201d), up\nto fully fledged teamwork.\n",
