God\u2019s Knowledge of the Future and Open Theism\n\nIt is fair to say that philosophers responding to these difficulties\nhave been more concerned to preserve God\u2019s omniscience than his\nsovereignty. Perhaps this is in part because philosophy is itself a\nmatter of pursuing knowledge, so that philosophers are led to value\nomniscience more highly. Were we generals, say, or politicians, our\npriorities might be quite the opposite. In any case, most discussions\nof the seeming conflict between creaturely freedom and divine\nperfection have concentrated on the task of reconciling as far as\npossible the assertion that we have free will with the claim that God\nis all-knowing. One especially important way of doing so is to hold\nthat God\u2019s position with respect to time is such that unlike us,\nhe does not have to wait for the future to unfold in order to know its\ncontents. Such was the view of Boethius, who held that God exists\nentirely outside of time, in a kind of eternal present to which all\nthat occurs in time is equally accessible (Consolation, Bk. V, pr.\n6). Thus, God is able in a single act of awareness to comprehend\nall of history, the past and future as well as the present, just as\nthough they were now occurring. Many philosophers have followed\nBoethius in this, holding that God is in no way a temporal being, but\nis rather the creator of time, with complete and equal access to all\nof its\n contents.[2]\n And it may well appear that on such a view God\u2019s omniscience is\nrestored, in that he has immediate cognitive access to everything that\nwill ever occur. Moreover, there is no conflict with libertarian\nfreedom, since on this account God\u2019s knowledge of our future\ndecisions and actions is not really foreknowledge. Rather,\nthe vantage point from which God knows our decisions and actions is\ncompletely external to time. This makes all talk about\n\u201cwhen\u201d God knows about our actions pointless. He simply\nknows them, in a unified, timeless and unchanging act of comprehension\nthat comprises all that ever was or will be.\n\nThere are criticisms of the idea that God is timeless (Wolterstorff\n1982). But even if the Boethian position is correct on this score, the\nusefulness of this means of reconciling divine omniscience and human\nfreedom is highly questionable. The difficulty is that in order for\nGod to exercise full providence over the world, he needs to know\nas creator how the decisions and actions of creatures with\nlibertarian freedom will go. It is hard to see how that is possible on\nthe Boethian view, for even if God is outside of time, his activity as\ncreator is still ontologically prior to the activities of\nfree creatures on this account, whereas his knowledge of those\nactivities is posterior to them. Thus, it seems impossible\nthat God\u2019s creative will could be guided by his knowledge of our\nactions, even if, from his timeless perspective, such knowledge is\nfinally available to him. If this is correct, then even the Boethian\nGod runs an immense risk in creating the world. He can only hope that\nwe will use our freedom justly and wisely, perhaps making some\nallowance for the possibility that we will not, but otherwise simply\ntrusting in the outcome. So although God\u2019s omniscience may be\nrestored by placing him outside of time, he is in no way empowered by\nit. (Whether the Boethian God\u2019s simple foreknowledge grants any\nprovidential advantage at all is a matter of dispute, but undeniably\nthe Boethian God must run significant risks in creating the world. For\nan entry into the debate, see Hunt 2009, Hasker 2009, and Zimmerman\n2012.)\n\nIt may be questioned, furthermore, whether this view of things really\nis consistent with the claim that God is timeless. The Boethian\npicture appears to call for a kind of transition, wherein God first\ncreates free creatures in ignorance of what their actions will be and\nthen learns about those actions by observation. But if that is so then\nthere appears to be change in God, in which case he would have to be a\ntemporal being after all. Now perhaps there is some way around this\nproblem: maybe as creator God somehow operates in isolation from\ncertain parts of his knowledge, while having access to all of it in\nhis role as knower \u2014 and yet remains timeless in both\ncapacities. Still, it is not satisfying that God should be limited in\nthis way. His activity as creator ought to be completely unhampered.\nMoreover, the bifurcation in God\u2019s thinking called for by this\nadjustment only reinforces the difficulty of treating creaturely\ndecisions and actions as falling under divine providence. As creator,\non this account, God really does not know what kind of world he is\ncreating: how evil it will be, whence the evil will arise, and how to\nanticipate it in detail in the plan of creation.\n\nOne may be tempted at this point simply to throw in the towel, to give\nup the endeavor to reconcile libertarian freedom with divine\nsovereignty and omniscience. If so, we may still insist on libertarian\nfreedom for creatures. But if we are convinced this is incompatible\nwith holding that God is omniscient, and that everything that takes\nplace in the created world falls under his complete governance, then\nthese claims will go by the board. On this type of theory, commonly\ncalled the \u201cOpen\u201d view or Open Theism, God is a temporal\nbeing who, like us, must await the actions of free creatures in order\nto know with certainty what they will be. And much that occurs, most\nespecially sinful decisions and willings, will not be of his choosing.\nNot that he is completely in the dark: God can still have\nprobabilistic knowledge of how his creatures will act, and he can\ncontrive to place them in circumstances designed to elicit if possible\nwhatever behavior will achieve the most good. And of course he still\nhas the power to motivate and punish, so creatures may be guided\ntoward right paths. Accordingly, God is still able to exercise a sort\nof general providence over the world, guiding it in the direction of\nhis objectives as creator, or at least something approximating them\n(Rhoda 2010a). But his providence can never be, as is sometimes said,\n\u201cmeticulous.\u201d Rather, on this scenario God\u2019s aims as\ncreator can only be achieved \u2014 assuming they will be achieved at\nall \u2014 by taking risks. Inevitably, creaturely free will makes\nfor a setting of uncertainty, and only within that setting can God\nattempt to bring creation to a happy outcome. Yet he proceeds, and his\ndoing so is a measure of his love for us.(See Hasker 1989 and Pinnock\net. al. 1994.)\n\nSuch a position may appeal to philosophers who find the God of perfect\nbeing theology too remote and mysterious to equate with the God of\nscripture. But this viewpoint faces serious problems. Some are\nrelatively specific. For example, it is hard to see how, if even God\ndoes not know what they will be, the actions of free creatures could\nbe the subject of prophecy. Yet they often are, in scripture (Flint\n1998, 100\u201302). Also, there will no doubt be many cases where\nmultiple free actions impinge on some outcome God desires. When that\nis so, the probabilities of those actions need to be multiplied to\ndetermine God\u2019s assurance of the outcome, which as a result\ncould be minuscule (Flint 1998, 104). But the biggest difficulty is\nthat this view places God\u2019s fate as creator almost completely in\nthe hands of his creatures. No matter how concerned and loving he may\nbe, or how powerfully he attempts to win us over, we are on this view\nout of God\u2019s control. There is always the chance, therefore,\nthat his plans as creator will be utterly dashed, that his overtures\nto us will be rejected \u2014 even to the point, one supposes, of our\nall being lost \u2014 that we will use our freedom and advancing\nknowledge to wreak ever greater horror, and that creation will turn\nout to be a disaster. Willingness to take chances may be laudable in\nsome cases, but surely this level of risk is irresponsible. Moreover,\nit is completely out of keeping with both scripture and tradition,\nboth of which portray God as above the fray of the world, unperturbed\nby its mishaps, and governing its course with complete power and\nassurance. On the Open view, divine governance is a hit or miss\naffair, in which we can only wait to see whether a somewhat poorly\ninformed God will manage to bootstrap his way to his objectives.\nSurely, opponents argue, this gives away too much of the traditional\nnotion of providence.\n\nOne tactic for preserving omniscience even while accepting the basic\nopen theist view just described is to hold that God cannot be faulted\nfor not knowing in advance how we will exercise our freedom, since\nuntil we do there is simply nothing to know. According to views of\nthis kind, not all propositions about the future have a truth value.\nSome do, of course: it is a necessary truth that 2 + 2 = 4, and this\nproposition has as much bearing on the future as it does on the\npresent and past. Similarly, a proposition concerning the future may\nhave a truth value when its truth is causally determined. Consider,\nfor example, the proposition that the sun will rise tomorrow. Most\nlikely, it is true. True or false, however, this proposition\u2019s\ntruth value is fixed by causes already in place, causes that determine\neither that the sun will rise tomorrow or that it will not. But now\nconsider the claim that I will decide an hour from now to attend a\nconcert this evening. If I have free will, there are no conditions\npresently in place that determine whether I will so decide. This being\nthe case, according to the present view, the proposition that I will\ndecide in an hour to attend the concert is neither true nor false. It\nhas no truth value at all, nor does any other proposition that\ndescribes a future free decision or action. But then, the argument\nruns, it is not a mark against his omniscience that in creating us,\nGod does not know how we will exercise our freedom. It is logically\nimpossible to know of a proposition that it is true or that it is\nfalse if it is neither. And inability to know what logically cannot be\nknown does not harm God\u2019s omniscience, any more than inability\nto do what logically cannot be done harms his omnipotence (Swinburne\n1993, 180\u201381). A distinct but related view is that all future\ncontingents are in fact false, because there is nothing in the future\nto make them true, and so the fact that God does not know ahead of\ntime which of them becomes true is not an epistemic failure on his\npart (see Todd 2016).\n\nIf correct, this view would indeed reconcile divine omniscience and\ncreaturely freedom, leaving only the problem of sovereignty to be\naddressed. But there are telling arguments against it. Propositions\nthat venture to predict future free decisions and actions do appear to\nhave truth values, and some of them appear to be true. One indication\nof this is that we believe and disbelieve such propositions, and what\nis it to believe a proposition but to believe it is true, or to\ndisbelieve it but to believe it is false? Nor does it seem possible to\nworm our way out of this. Let p be the proposition that I\nwill decide to attend a concert this evening. It might be protested\nthat for someone to believe I will so decide is only to believe\np will become true at the appointed time \u2014\ni.e., at the time of my decision. But that does not solve the problem,\nfor to believe this is simply to believe another future-tensed\nproposition \u2014 namely, \u201cp will become true\u201d\n\u2014 which is just as dependent on my decision for its truth as is\np. Similarly, it will not do to claim that to believe\np is not to believe it is true but only that it is likely or\nprobable. For to hold these beliefs is just to hold, respectively,\nthat it is likely that p is true, or probable that it is\ntrue. In short, there seems no avoiding the fact that to believe\np is to be committed to its truth, pure and simple. Moreover,\nanyone thus committed would, if I later decide to attend the concert,\nbe justified in saying they had been right about what I would decide,\nthat their earlier belief had been correct. And again, what is it for\na belief to be right or correct except for it to be true? (For a\nrelated argument, see Pruss 2010, to which Rhoda 2010b replies.)\n\nIn any case, the concern remains that open theism leaves the\ntraditional strong view of divine providence in tatters in favor of a\nrisk-taking God. A better solution would be preferable, if one can be\nhad.\n",
