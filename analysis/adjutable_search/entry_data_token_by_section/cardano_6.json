    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy: The Two Levels of Wisdom || Prudence and Practical Wisdom\n5. Divination, Fate, and the Roman Inquisition\n\nAmong the most difficult periods of Cardano\u2019s tumultuous life\nwas his imprisonment and trial by the Inquisition. The episode is\nimportant for a number of reasons. The Roman Inquisition had taken its\nmodern form as a Counter-Reformation apparatus for doctrinal purity in\n1542. Cardano was arguably the most significant Catholic intellectual\ntargeted until Giordano Bruno in the 1590s and Galileo in the\nseventeenth century. His ordeal, then, is a key moment in the history\nof early modern censorship. Beyond that, censor reports reveal a\nnumber of themes central to Cardano\u2019s divinatory and\nastrological thought, even if they distort his actual views. Such\nthemes are essential to the whole of his philosophy and to an\nunderstanding of his general reception as one of the most influential\nastrologers of his time.\n\nThe Inquisition began to investigate Cardano in the spring and summer\nof 1570. On 6 October of that year, he was arrested and imprisoned by\nthe Inquisitor of Bologna, where he lived and was a professor of\nmedicine at the city\u2019s university. Among the documents preserved\nin the Inquisition archives is Cardano\u2019s desperate plea for\nrelease from prison, addressed to the dean of the Inquisition in Rome:\n\u201cToday is the forty-third day in prison [\u2026] I eat almost\nnothing because eating would drive me mad, not eating would drive me\nto death, which I consider the lesser evil\u201d (Baldini and Spruit,\nt. II, 1075). In December, he was transferred to house arrest, and,\nshortly thereafter, in February 1571, the Roman authorities rendered\ntheir judgment: he would abjure not as a formal heretic, but rather as\nvehemently suspected of heresy. Roughly sixty years later, Galileo\nwould be forced to do the same. Unlike Galileo, Cardano was released\nfrom house arrest soon after his abjuration, but he did not escape\nwithout consequences, having lost his professorship due to pressure\nfrom the Inquisition on the Bolognese government. In October, he\nrelocated to Rome. The following year, his non-medical works were\nforbidden by the Index of Prohibited Books. Censors both of the\nInquisition and the Index continued to produce reports on his\npublished writings until at least the 1590s, a testament to the\nenduring interest for him on the Italian peninsula well into the\nseventeenth century. Physicians, lawyers, ecclesiastics, and other\ninterested parties, frequently sought permission from the Church to\nread his banned works (Marcus 2020, 160\u2013163).\n\nGiven Cardano\u2019s heterodox views, the general freedom with which\nhe expressed himself, and his devotion to astrology, it is perhaps\nsurprising that he was not targeted earlier in his career. There is\nlittle doubt that his patrons and renown had provided some protection.\nThe Inquisitor of Bologna, notable for his zealous prosecution of\nheretics, even expressed a measure of concern about dealing with an\nauthor of Cardano\u2019s celebrity. Yet it also seems that Cardano,\ndespite his international fame, lived a somewhat solitary life in\nBologna, bereft of protectors capable of shielding him from local\nmachinations (Regier 2019). Larger forces were also at work. With the\nconclusion of the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563), the Church had\nbecome ever more intolerant of heterodox philosophies. Until the\nInquisition\u2019s archives were opened up in the 1990s, the\nconsensus among historians had been that Cardano had offended the\nChurch by printing a horoscope of Christ in his commentary on\nPtolemy\u2019s Tetrabiblos. The archival documents provide a\nfuller story. It was not Christ\u2019s horoscope that led directly to\nCardano\u2019s trial but rather his De rerum varietate\n(1557), an encyclopedic treatise of natural history. Nevertheless,\nastrology was at the center of the Inquisition\u2019s case from the\nbeginning. For the Inquisition to launch an investigation, an initial\naccusation was needed, and here it had come in the form of a letter\nfrom the Inquisitor of Como. A focal point of the letter\u2019s\nattention was a chapter of the De rerum varietate devoted to\nthe effects of the celestial bodies. According to the Inquisitor,\nCardano \u201cexaggerates\u201d the influence of celestial bodies\nand denies the possibility of God acting directly on sublunar nature.\nHe also, says the Inquisitor, holds the martyrs of the Church to be\nnothing more than madmen, driven to extreme and foolish religious\nbehavior by celestial influence. The Inquisitor also lists, rather\nvaguely, other offenses: contempt of clergy, denial of miracles and\ndemons, and teaching of divinatory superstitions (Baldini and Spruit,\nt. II, 1042\u20131043). This cluster of accusations, with astrology\nat the center, would prove to be the basis for subsequent censorship\nof Cardano. At the heart of censorial concerns was the accusation that\nhe naturalized what the Church believed outside the realm of nature:\nGod and providence, free will, and miracles. Hence, Cardano was not\ntargeted as an astrologer per se, but rather as an\nastrologizing philosopher in the vein of Pietro Pomponazzi\n(1462\u20131525). Censors seemed ready to impute to him the\nskepticism of miracles associated with Pomponazzi, and especially the\nlatter\u2019s embrace of determinism. Pomponazzi had laid out the\npossibility in his De fato, de libero arbitrio, praedestinatione,\nprovidentia Dei (1567) that free will was philosophically\nuntenable, that it could not be reconciled with God\u2019s nature\nunless we limited divine omnipotence and omniscience, and that it\ncould not be reconciled with the Aristotelian causality.\n\nWhile censor reports highlight themes in Cardano\u2019s thought that\nwere important at least to a subset of readers, they are of course\nneither balanced nor accurate portrayals (for more on Cardano\u2019s\ntrial and censorship, see Valente 2003 and 2017; Regier 2019 and\n2021). We might say that his works on divination endorse the consensus\nopinion among Christian astrologers, both medieval and Renaissance,\nthat celestial bodies act as instruments of providence, but that\nhumans can resist natural forces up to a point. He is something of a\nmoderate libertarian: free will exists, but it operates within a field\nof natural, social, and providential constraints. Following a long\ntradition with its origin in Boethius, he seems to recognize a fine\ndistinction between providence and fate: providence is the universal\norder experienced in the timeless present of God\u2019s mind, while\nfate is the manifestation of that order in the universe itself (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 43a; Paralipomenon, OO, X,\n468b). Early in his career, he wrote a treatise specifically devoted\nto fate, De fato, which was subsequently lost, likely\ndestroyed by Cardano himself due to fears of the Inquisition (Cardano\n2004a, 53). We can, however, consult De fato\u2019s table of\ncontents, which survives in editions of De libris propriis\n(De libris propriis, OO, I, 62a-63b and 99a-100a; Cardano\n2004, 174\u2013177 and 236\u2013239). These chapter headings raise more\nquestions than they answer, however. Cardano built a sweeping\nargument, it seems, in favor of an all-encompassing fate that subsumed\neven accidental events. And, like Pomponazzi, he was ready to justify\nsuch a conception of fate as a dual consequence of God\u2019s nature\nand the nature of causality. At the same time, however, he devoted a\nchapter to the \u201cutility\u201d of free will.\n\nHow exactly free will was grounded in the lost De fato\nremains a mystery, as does Cardano\u2019s reference to its utility.\nHis writings on divination can help to answer the question, since\nthere he endeavors at moments to clarify the relationship between fate\nand free will. Indeed, an entire section of the De fato was\nto deal with divination, whose viability, according to a chapter\nheading, was based on the orderly unfolding of fate. In his commentary\non Ptolemy\u2019s Tetrabiblos, as in the\nTetrabiblos itself, medicine serves as the paradigm case for\ndivination. In Tetrabiblos I.3, Ptolemy compares astrology to\nmedicine: a physician identifies the course that nature will take if\nleft alone and then employs counteracting forces to bring about\nanother outcome; the astrologer does much the same. Commenting on this\nsection, Cardano agrees with the Arabic mathematician and astrologer\nAli ibn Ridwan (\u201cHaly\u201d in Latin) that Ptolemy here\n\u201cdemonstrated maximum wisdom in things divine and human\u201d\n(De astrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112a). What Cardano means is\nthat astrology can estimate the force of future conditions, and so can\ndetermine which events can be deflected (declinari possint)\nand which will take place due to the divinely instituted\n\u201cnecessity of fate\u201d (fatali necessitate) (De\nastrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112b). He has in mind inflection points\nin the providential design of history\u2014wars, great defeats and\nvictories, catastrophes, and political transformations. Yet even under\nthese circumstances, we are not completely powerless. Cardano turns to\nthe analogy of shipwreck to make his point: \u201cIt is as if a\nperson found himself in the sea during a tempest, and although he\nforesaw the danger he could not avoid it. The person skilled in\nswimming through heavy currents or practiced in handling the danger\nwill be saved, while another hardly so. The divine can be considered\nsimilarly, because it is entirely necessary, and because whatever is\naccomplished by the divine mind cannot be escaped\u201d (De\nastrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112b). Prognostication in this sense\nalways implies an estimation of forces, followed by a consideration of\nthe appropriate response. Cardano proffers a two-tiered astrological\nsystem where princes of the world are more subject to astrological\neffects than their subjects; through astrological changes, the divine\ncan effectively seize the hearts of kings and steer history to its\ndetermined end. This is not to say that the individual outside the\nranks of power never experiences moments of unavoidable fate. In\nDe libris propriis, Cardano reflects on the signs that\nforetold his eldest son\u2019s execution, signs whose meaning only\nbecame clear when it was too late. Cardano asks himself why these\nsigns presented themselves when they were to be of no use. He\nconcludes that they function as Christian consolation, as proof of\nGod\u2019s existence, providential design, and so of the justice that\nreveals itself in the unfolding of history (De libris\npropriis, OO, I, 98a-b; Maclean 2004, 234-235).\n\nAcross a spectrum of works, Cardano depicts the course of a human life\nas the result of a dynamic between outward and inward inclinations,\nand the knowledge and force that we can muster to counter or\ncomplement them. Yet we are not dealing with a pure form of naturalism\nhere. The divine and supernatural, as Cardano understands them, are\nconstantly speaking about the future to humans through intermediaries,\nthrough nature itself (Regier 2023). In his monumental treatise on\ndream interpretation, Somniorum Synesiorum libri IV or De\nsomniis, he describes a universe where providential knowledge is\nrelayed from God to the celestial intelligences, then to humans. He\nwrites that when we sleep, we enter into a communion with God\u2019s\nmind, such that the future is entirely presented to our souls, but we\nrarely perceive the information due to the effects of bodily\nimbalance, daily worries, and general overstimulation. We are like\ndogs given food by their master; we are oblivious to the preparation\nthat went into it, to its significance (De somniis, OO, V,\n672a; Cardano 2021a, 515). The framework here is generally\nNeoplatonic: the soul has tremendous access to knowledge that stands\nabove the sensory realm, yet it is too bogged down by incorporeal\nthings\u2014indeed, one of the intellectual benefits of melancholy,\nto which Cardano assigns a variety of powerful effects, is that it can\ndistance the mind from daily and corporeal cares. As for the nature of\ndreams, the celestial influence uses our memories as if they were\nstones in a mosaic, assembling these memories into a composite with\nmeaning; for this reason, dreams are usually cryptic (De\nsomniis, OO, V, 598b; Cardano 2021a, 43).\n\nExcept in very rare cases (e.g., the dreams of perfect clarity that\nCardano calls idola), the future must be deciphered with\nimperfect results. The underlying cause is the nature of the infinite.\nSciences that concern the future, he writes, all run up against the\nsame problem, the \u201cinfinite nature of things, that is, of the\nsoul and of what can be seen; that which sees and that which can be\nseen are infinite in number. How then can the infinite be contained in\nbooks, however long and numerous?\u201d (De somniis, OO, V,\n671a; Cardano 2021a, 513). He warns his readers against philosophers\nlike Cicero who prefer clarity to nuance. Clarity is a rhetorical\ncheat; only the greatest of philosophers appreciate infinity and\nrecognize that clarity is the nemesis of accuracy. This discussion is\nmeant to explain the difficulty of dream interpretation, but it could\nbe extended to any other discipline. Knowledge and ignorance interact\nat the level of the cosmos, insofar as created beings cannot fully\nunderstand the providential knowledge that flows through them and\nmanifests in their actions. Galen, says Cardano, does not know how he\nmoves his finger back and forth, despite all his anatomical knowledge,\nbut he can do it anyway because of the natural framework divinely\nestablished. The celestial intelligences possess detailed knowledge of\ntheir influence over the sublunar world, yet they neither understand\nhow they received this knowledge from God, nor do they know how they\nreally move that world any more than Galen knows how he moves his\nfinger (De somniis, OO, V, 671b-672a; Cardano 2021a, 515).\nNature, in this way, is infused with knowledge\u2014knowledge of all\nthat has and will happen; yet even at the highest ontological level,\nsuch knowledge is accompanied by the ignorance of created beings in\nrelation to divine understanding.\n",
