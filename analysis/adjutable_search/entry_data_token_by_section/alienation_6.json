Subjective and Objective Alienation\n3.1 The Distinction Between Subject and Objective Alienation\n\nThe basic idea of alienation may not be unduly elusive or\ndifficult to understand. However, it obviously does not follow\nthat there are no complexities or slippery issues here, perhaps\nespecially once we venture further into the relevant literature.\n\nThree interesting complexities are introduced here. They concern,\nrespectively: the distinction between subjective and objective\nalienation; the need for a criterion identifying candidate separations\nas problematic; and the relation between alienation and\nvalue.\n\nThis section provides an introduction to, and some initial reflections\non, the first of these interesting complexities; namely, the division\nof alienation into subjective and objective varieties (Hardimon 1994:\n119\u2013122). Not all theorists or traditions operate (either,\nexplicitly or implicitly) with this distinction, but it can be a\nconsiderable help in understanding the diagnosis offered by particular\nauthors and in handling particular cases.\n\nFirst, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms of how subjects\nfeel, or think about, or otherwise experience, the problematic\nseparation here. This can be called subjective alienation.\nFor instance, Ingrid might be said to be alienated because she feels\nestranged from the world, because she experiences her life as lacking\nmeaning, because she does not feel \u2018at home [zu\nHause]\u2019 in the world\u2014to adopt the evocative shorthand\nsometimes used by Hegel\u2014and so on (e.g. 1991a: \u00a74A,\n\u00a7187A, and \u00a7258A).\n\nSecond, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms which make no\nreference to the feelings, thoughts, or experience of subjects. This\ncan be called objective alienation. For instance, Julieta\nmight be said to be alienated because some separation prevents her\nfrom developing and deploying her essential human characteristics,\nprevents her from engaging in self-realising activities, and so on.\nSuch claims are controversial in a variety of ways, but they assume\nalienation is about the frustration of that potential, and they make\nno reference to whether Julieta herself experiences that lack as a\nloss. Maybe Julieta genuinely enjoys her self-realisation-lacking\nlife, and even consciously rejects the goal of self-realisation as\ninvolving an overly demanding and unattractive ideal.\n\nSubjective alienation is sometimes disparaged \u2013 treated, for example,\nas concerning \u2018merely\u2019 how an individual\n\u2018feels\u2019 about \u2018real\u2019 alienation. However, subjective alienation is better understood as a full-blown, meaningful, variety of alienation, albeit\nnot the only one. If you genuinely feel alienated, then you really are\n(subjectively) alienated.\n3.2 Diagnostic Schema\n\nThis distinction between subjective and objective alienation can give\nus a useful diagnostic schema. Let us assume\u2014no doubt\ncontroversially\u2014that all combinations of these two forms of\nalienation are possible. That gives us four social outcomes to\ndiscuss:\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\nSituation:\nSubjective\n\nAlienation:\nObjective\n\nAlienation: \n\n(i)\n\u25fc\n\u25fc \n\n(ii)\n\u25fb\n\u25fc \n\n(iii)\n\u25fc\n\u25fb \n\n(iv)\n\u25fb\n\u25fb  \n\n\nWhere: \u25fb = Absent and \u25fc = Present\n\n3.3 Applications\n\nThese various alternative combinations\u2014numbered (i) to (iv)\nabove\u2014correspond, very roughly, to the ways in which particular\nauthors have characterised particular kinds of social arrangement or\ntypes of society. Consider, for example, the different views of modern\nclass-divided society taken by Hegel and Marx.\n\nMarx can be characterised as diagnosing contemporary capitalist\nsociety as corresponding to situation (i); that is, as being a social\nworld which contains both objective and subjective alienation. On what\nwe might call his standard view, Marx allows that objective and\nsubjective alienation are conceptually distinct, but assumes that in\ncapitalist societies they are typically found together sociologically\n(perhaps with the subjective forms tending to track the objective\nones). However, there are passages where he deviates from that\nstandard view, and\u2014without abandoning the thought that objective\nalienation is, in some sense, more fundamental\u2014appears to allow\nthat, on occasion, subjective and objective alienation can also come\napart sociologically. At least, that is one way of reading a\nwell-known passage in The Holy Family which suggests that\ncapitalists might be objectively but not subjectively alienated. In\nthese remarks, Marx recognises that capitalists do not get to engage\nin self-realising activities of the right kind (hence their objective\nalienation), but observes that\u2014unlike the proletariat\u2014the\ncapitalists are content in their estrangement; not least,\nthey feel \u2018at ease\u2019 in it, and they feel\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 by it (Marx and Engels 1975: 36).\n\nIn contrast, Hegel maintains that the modern social world approximates\nto something more like situation (iii); that is, as being a social\nworld not containing objective alienation, but still containing\nsubjective alienation. That is, for Hegel, the social and political\nstructures of the modern social world do constitute a home, because\nthey enable individuals to realise themselves, variously as family\nmembers, economic agents, and citizens. However, those same\nindividuals fail to understand or appreciate that this is the case,\nand rather feel estranged from, and perhaps even consciously reject,\nthe institutions of the modern social world. The resulting situation\nhas been characterised as one of \u2018pure subjective\nalienation\u2019 (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThat Hegel and Marx diagnose modern society in these different ways\nhelps to explain their differing strategic political commitments. They\nboth aim to bring society closer to situation (iv)\u2014that is, a\nsocial world lacking systematic forms of both objective and subjective\nalienation\u2014but, since they disagree about where we are starting\nfrom, they propose different routes to that shared goal. For Marx,\nsince we start from situation (i), this requires that the existing\nworld be overturned; that is, that both institutions and attitudes\nneed to be revolutionised (overcoming objective and subjective\nalienation). For Hegel, since we start from situation (iii), this\nrequires only attitudinal change: we come to recognise that the\nexisting world is already objectively \u2018a home\u2019, and in\nthis way \u2018reconcile\u2019 ourselves to that world, overcoming\npure subjective alienation in the process.\n\nSituation (ii) consists of a social world containing objective, but\nnot subjective, alienation \u2013 a situation that can be characterised as\none of \u2018pure objective alienation\u2019 (Hardimon\n1994: 120). It is perhaps not too much of a stretch to think of\nthis situation as corresponding, very roughly, to one of the Frankfurt\nSchool\u2019s more nightmarish visions of contemporary capitalist\nsociety. (The Frankfurt School is the colloquial label given to\nseveral generations of philosophers and social theorists, in the\nWestern Marxist tradition, associated\u2014more or less\nclosely\u2014with the Institute for Social Research founded in\n1929\u20131930.) For example, in the pessimistic diagnosis of Herbert\nMarcuse (1898\u20131979), articulated in One-Dimensional Man\n(1964), individuals in advanced capitalist societies appear happy in\ntheir dysfunctional relationships\u2014they \u2018identify\nthemselves\u2019 with their estranged circumstances and gain\n\u2018satisfaction\u2019 from them (2002: 13). Objective alienation\nstill obtains, but no longer generates social conflict, since the\nlatter is assumed\u2014not implausibly\u2014to require agents who\nfeel, or experience, some form of hostility or rebelliousness towards\nexisting social arrangements.\n\nThat latter assumption raises the wider issue of the relation between\nalienation and, what might be called \u2018revolutionary\nmotivation\u2019. Let us assume that radical social change requires,\namongst other conditions, an agent\u2014typically a collective\nagent\u2014with both the strength and the desire to bring that change\nabout. The role of alienation in helping to form that latter\npsychological prerequisite\u2014the desire to bring about change on\nthe part of the putative revolutionary agent\u2014looks complicated.\nFirst, it would seem that the mere fact of objective alienation cannot play\nthe motivating role, since it does not involve or require any feeling,\nor thinking about, or otherwise experiencing, the problematic\nseparation here. It remains possible, of course, that a subject\u2019s knowledge of that alienation\nmight\u2014depending, not least, on one\u2019s views on the\nconnections between reasons and motivations\u2014provide an\nappropriately psychological incentive to revolt. Second, the relation\nbetween subjective alienation and motivation looks more complex than\nit might initially seem. Note, in particular, that some of the\nexperiential dimensions of subjective alienation look less likely than\nothers to generate the psychological prerequisites of action here.\nFeelings of powerlessness and isolation, for instance, might well\ngenerate social withdrawal and individual atomism, rather than radical\nsocial engagement and cooperative endeavour, on the part of the\nrelevant agents. In short, whether subjective alienation is a friend\nor an enemy of revolutionary motivation would seem to depend on the\nprecise form that it takes.\n\nInterestingly, situation (ii)\u2014that is, the case of \u2018pure\nobjective alienation\u2019\u2014might also be thought to approximate\nto the social goal of certain thinkers in the tradition of\nexistentialism (the tradition of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980),\nAlbert Camus (1913\u20131960), and others). Some interpretative\ngenerosity may be needed here, but existentialists appear to think of (something like) objective alienation as a permanent feature of all human societies. Rejecting both substantive accounts of essential human nature, and the ethical embrace of social relations\nthat facilitate the development and deployment of those human\ncharacteristics, they rather maintain that the social world will\nalways remain \u2018other\u2019, can never be a \u2018home\u2019.\nHowever, although this \u2018otherness\u2019 can never be overcome,\nthere do look to be better and worse ways of dealing with it. What is\nessential to each individual is what they make of themselves, the ways\nin which they choose to engage with that other. The preferred outcome\nhere seems to involve individuals embodying a norm of\n\u2018authenticity\u2019, which amongst other conditions\u2014such\nas choosing, or committing, to their own projects\u2014may require\nthat they have the \u2018courage\u2019 to \u2018grasp, accept, and,\nperhaps even affirm\u2019 the fact that the social world is not a\nhome for them (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThis also clarifies that situation (iv)\u2014which contains\nsystematic forms of neither objective or subjective\nalienation\u2014is the social goal of some but not all of these\nauthors (of Hegel and Marx, for instance, but not the\nexistentialists). Of course, (iv) might also be a characterisation of\nthe extant social world according to a hypothetical, and\nover-optimistic, apologist for the present.\n4. What Makes a Separation Problematic?\n4.1 Criteria of \u2018Impropriety\u2019\n\nThe second of the interesting complexities broached here concerns what\nwe can call the need for a criterion of\n\u2018impropriety\u2019 \u2013 that is, a criterion by which candidate\nseparations might be identified as problematic or not. Recall the\nearlier suggestion that accounts of alienation require some benchmark\ncondition of harmony or connectedness against which separations might\nbe assessed as problematic or not.\n\nHistorically, this role\u2014identifying whether candidate\nseparations are problematic\u2014has often been played by accounts of\nour essential human nature. However, motivated by suspicion of that\nlatter idea, theorists of alienation have sometimes sought\nalternatives to fulfil that role.\n4.2 Essential Human Nature\n\nTo see how the appeal to human nature works, imagine two hypothetical\ntheorists\u2014Katerina and Laura\u2014seeking to assess whether\nalienation exists in a particular society. We can stipulate that the\ninstitutions and culture of this particular society are\nindividualistic\u2014in the sense that they systematically frustrate\ncooperation and sociability\u2014and that the two theorists share\nmany, but not all, of the same views. In particular, assume that our\ntwo theorists agree that: alienation is a coherent and useful\nconcept; the account of alienation given here is, broadly\nspeaking, plausible; the only serious candidate for a problematic\nseparation in this particular society are those arising from its\nindividualism; and our essential human nature provides the\nbenchmark of \u2018propriety\u2019 for assessing separations. Simply\nput, separations are problematic if they frustrate, and unproblematic\nif they facilitate, \u2018self-realisation\u2019. Self-realisation\nis understood here as a central part of the good life and as\nconsisting in the development and deployment of an individual\u2019s\nessential human characteristics. However, assume also that Katerina\nand Laura disagree about what comprises human nature. In\nparticular, they disagree about whether cooperation and sociability\nare essential human characteristics, with Katerina insisting that they\nare and Laura insisting that they are not. It seems to follow that\nKaterina will conclude, and Laura will deny, that this society is one\ncontaining alienation. For Katerina, the widespread lack of\ncooperation and sociability confirm that the basic social institutions\nhere frustrate our self-realisation. For Laura, the very same\nwidespread lack of cooperation and sociability confirm that the basic\nsocial institutions facilitate, or at least do not\nfrustrate, our self-realisation.\n\nNote that in sub-section 1.2, where the basic idea of alienation was\nelaborated, various relations between subject and object were\ndistinguished, only one of which was characterised as reflexive.\nHowever, in the light of the present discussion, we might now think it\nmore accurate to say that\u2014on this kind of account, which\nuses our essential human nature to identify alienation\u2014only\none of them was directly reflexive, because there is some\nsense in which all of those dimensions of alienation involve a\nseparation from some aspect of our own human nature. After all, this\nis precisely what picks out the relevant separation as problematic.\nFor example, the separation of individuals from each other is, for\nKaterina, indirectly also a separation from human nature, from the\ncooperation and sociability that characterises our essential\nhumanity.\n4.3 An Alternative Criterion\n\nAs already noted, this benchmark\u2014by which candidate separations\nare assessed as problematic or not\u2014is often, but not always,\nplayed by accounts of our essential human nature. Given the widespread\ncontemporary suspicion of such accounts\u2014not least, by those\nopposed to what is sometimes called \u2018essentialism\u2019 about\nhuman nature\u2014it might be helpful to sketch a recent account\nof alienation which is not dependent on such assumptions (or, at\nleast, consciously strives to avoid them). There is also a potential\nbenefit here for those of us who do not fully share that suspicion,\nnamely, that such an example might provide some sense of the\ndiversity of available theories of alienation.\n\nRahel Jaeggi offers an account of alienation of this kind, and\nsituates it explicitly in the tradition of Critical Theory \u2013 the kind\nof emancipatory theory associated with the Frankfurt School. On this\naccount, the idea of alienation has the potential to help us\nunderstand and change the world, but only if it receives some\nsignificant conceptual reconstruction. Alienation is still associated\nwith the frustration of freedom, with disruptions to something like\n\u2018self-realisation\u2019. However, this account\u2014unlike its\nforerunners and associates\u2014is said not to be fatally compromised\nby a commitment to either \u2018strongly objectivistic\u2019\ntheories of the good life or \u2018essentialist\u2019 conceptions of\nthe self (Jaeggi 2014: 40).\n\nThe crucial term of art here is \u2018appropriation\u2019, which\nJaeggi uses to refer to the capacity for, and process of, relating to\nour own actions and projects in ways which engage \u2018something\nlike self-determination and being the author of one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019  (2014: 39). Appropriation is successful\u2014and\nalienation is absent\u2014when \u2018one is present in one\u2019s\nactions, steers one\u2019s life instead of being driven by it,\nindependently appropriates social roles and is able to identify with\none\u2019s desires, and is involved in the world\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014:\n155). In contrast, appropriation is unsuccessful\u2014and alienation\nis present\u2014when there is \u2018an inadequate power and a lack\nof presence in what one does, a failure to identify with one\u2019s\nown actions and desires and to take part in one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014: 155). Alienation is thus identified with\nsystematic disruptions of the process of appropriation \u2013 in particular,\nin those systematic disruptions which lead us to fail to experience\nour actions and projects as our own. These disruptions are said\ntypically to take one of four forms: first,\n\u2018powerlessness\u2019 or the experience of losing control over\none\u2019s own life; second, \u2018loss of authenticity\u2019\nespecially when one is unable to identify with one\u2019s own social\nroles; third, \u2018internal division\u2019 where one experiences\nsome of one\u2019s own desires and impulses as alien; and fourth,\n\u2018indifference\u2019 or a detachment from one\u2019s own\nprevious projects and self-understandings.\n\nThis model fits happily enough with our basic idea of alienation as\nconsisting in a  problematic separation between self and other\nthat belong together. However, the conditions for identifying\nthe relevant dysfunctional relation here are intended to be less\ndemanding and controversial than those involving claims about our\nessential human nature. There is a kindred notion of freedom as\nself-realisation, but it is said to be the realisation of a thin kind\nof self-determining agency and not the actualisation of some thick\n\u2018pre-given\u2019 identity of an essentialist sort. A normative\ndimension remains, but it is presented as expansive and broadly\nprocedural. It is expansive in that a wide range of actions and\nprojects might be included within its remit. And it is procedural in\nthat the benchmark for judging the success of these various actions\nand projects is that they were brought about in the right kind of\nself-determination delivering way, and not that their content reflects\na narrow and controversial account of what human beings are \u2018in\nessence\u2019.\n\nModern culture is said to recognise and value the kind of freedom at\nthe heart of this picture of appropriation. As a result, this account\nof alienation can be presented as a form of immanent\ncritique \u2013 that is, as utilising a standpoint which judges\nindividuals and forms of life according to standards that those\nindividuals have themselves propounded or which those forms of life\npresuppose. At the individual level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential tensions between the conditions for treating\npeople as responsible agents, and the obstructions to such agency that\ncharacterise alienated selves \u2013 for instance, the feelings of\npowerlessness that prevent individuals from directing and embracing\ntheir own lives. And at the social level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential discrepancies between modern ideals of freedom\nand their actual realisation in the contemporary world \u2013 for instance,\nthe existence of social or political roles that an individual can\nnever make their own (Jaeggi 2014: 41\u201342).\n\nOf course, there remain questions about this account, and three are\nbroached here. First, one might doubt whether the contrast between\nessentialist accounts of human nature, on the one hand, and a thinner\nkind of self-governing agency, on the other, can either be sustained\nor play the role intended. Second, one might wonder about the\nground(s) of normativity; after all, that the kind of subjectivity or\nself-determination which appropriation embodies is recognised and\nvalued in modern culture does not in itself establish its ethical\nworth. (More generally, it can seem easier to dismiss Hegelian\nteleology, or Marxist perfectionism, than it is to find wholly\nsatisfactory replacements for them.) Third, one might be sceptical\nabout the degree of social criticism here, since both the sources of,\nand solutions to, Jaeggi\u2019s paradigmatic examples of\nunsuccessful appropriation (\u2018powerless\u2019, \u2018loss\nof authenticity\u2019, \u2018internal division\u2019,\nand \u2018indifference\u2019) seem to focus on the\n\u2018thoughts and dispositions\u2019 of individuals rather than the\nstructures of particular societies (Haverkamp 2016, 69). Of course,\nthere might be plausible responses to these critical worries, some\nof which could draw on Jaeggi\u2019s own subsequent work\n(see espcially 2018). \n5. Alienation and Value\n5.1 Negative Element\n\nThe third of these interesting complexities concerns the ethical\ndimension of alienation. The connections between alienation and ethics\nare many and diverse, and there is no attempt here to sketch that\nwider landscape in its entirety. Instead, attention is drawn to two\ntopographical features: the claim that alienation is necessarily a\nnegative, but not a wholly negative, phenomenon, is elaborated and\ndefended; and the suggestion that some forms of moral theory or even\nmorality itself might encourage or embody alienation is briefly\noutlined.\n\nThe claim that alienation is necessarily a negative, but not a wholly\nnegative, phenomenon can be addressed in two parts. Defending the\nfirst part of that claim looks straightforward enough. Alienation, on\nthe present account, consists in the separation of certain entities\n\u2013 a subject and some object\u2014that properly belong together.\nAs a result, alienation always involves a loss or lack of something of\nvalue, namely, the \u2018proper\u2019\u2014rational, natural, or\ngood\u2014harmony or connectedness between the relevant subject and\nobject. \n5.2 Positive Element\n\nIt is the second part of the claim which looks less obvious: that\nalienation is not a wholly negative phenomena, that is, that the loss\nor lack here may not always be the whole story, ethically speaking.\nNote, in particular, that some well-known accounts also locate an\nachievement of something of value in the moment of alienation. The resulting ethical\n\u2018gains\u2019 and \u2018losses\u2019 would then need to be weighed and\njudged overall.\n\nIn order to illustrate this possibility\u2014that alienation can\ninvolve the achievement of something of value\u2014consider the\nnuanced and critical celebration of capitalism found, but not always\nrecognised, in Marx\u2019s writings. One pertinent way of introducing\nthis account involves locating the moment of alienation within a\npattern of development that we might call \u2018dialectical\u2019 in\none sense of that slippery term.\n\nThe dialectical pattern here concerns the developing relationship\nbetween a particular subject and object: the individual, on the one\nhand, and their social role and community, on the other. By a\ndialectical progression is meant only a movement from a stage\ncharacterised by a relationship of \u2018undifferentiated\nunity\u2019, through a stage characterised by a relationship of\n\u2018differentiated disunity\u2019, to a stage characterised by a\nrelationship of \u2018differentiated unity\u2019.\nThere are no further claims made here about the necessity, the naturalness, or the\nprevalence, of such progressions (Cohen 1974: 237).\n\nThe dialectical progression here involves three historical\nstages:\n\nFirst, past (pre-capitalist) societies are said to\nembody undifferentiated unity. In this stage, individuals\nare buried in their social role and community, scarcely\nconceptualising, still less promoting, their own identity and\ninterests as distinguishable from those of the wider community.\n\nSecond, present (capitalist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated disunity. In this stage, independence\nand separation predominate, and individuals care only for themselves,\nscarcely thinking of the identity and interests of the wider\ncommunity. Indeed, they are typically isolated from, and indifferent\nor even hostile towards, the latter.\n\nThird, future (communist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated unity. In this stage, desirable\nversions of community and individuality flourish together. Indeed, in\ntheir new forms, communal and individual identities and communal and\nindividual interests presuppose and reinforce each other. It is\nsometimes said that the contents of the first two stages (community\nand individuality, respectively) have thereby been\n\u2018sublated\u2019\u2014that is, elevated, cancelled, and\npreserved\u2014in this third stage. \u2018Sublated\u2019 is an\nattempted English translation of the German verb\n\u2018aufheben\u2019and its cognates, which Hegel\noccasionally uses to suggest this elusive combination of ideas (e.g.\nHegel 1991b: \u00a724A3, \u00a781A1).\n\nIn the present context, the crucial historical stage is the second\none. This is the stage of alienation, the stage of disunity which\nemerges from a simple unity before reconciliation in a higher\n(differentiated) unity (Inwood 1992: 36). This is the stage associated\nwith present (capitalist) societies involving the problematic\nseparation of individuals from their social role and community. In the\nfirst historical stage (of past pre-capitalist societies) there is a\nproblematic relation, but no separation. And in the third historical\nstage (of future communist societies) there is a separation but it is\na healthy rather than problematic one. In this second historical stage\nof alienation, there is a loss, or lack, of something of value;\nroughly speaking, it is the loss or lack of the individuals\u2019\nattachment to their social role and community. (More precisely, we\nmight say that they have lost a sense of, and connection to, the\ncommunity, and that they lack a healthy sense of, and connection to,\nthe community.)\n\nHowever, this disvalue is not the whole of the historical story,\nethically speaking. In comparison with the first stage, the second\nstage also involves a liberation of sorts from the object in which\nsubjects were previously \u2018engulfed\u2019 (Cohen 1974: 239). The\n\u2018of sorts\u2019 is a way of acknowledging that this is a rather\ndistinctive kind of liberation. The individual here is not necessarily\nrid of the constraints of the other (of their social position and\ncommunity), but they do now at least identify and experience them as\nsuch\u2014that is, as constraints on the individual\u2014whereas\npreviously the individual was engulfed by that other and failed to\nthink of themselves as having any identity and interests outside of\ntheir social position. In short, the loss or lack of something of\nvalue is not the only feature of the second stage of alienation. There\nis also an important gain here, namely, the achievement of what we can\ncall \u2018individuality\u2019. This significant good was missing in\nthe first pre-capitalist stage, and\u2014freed from its present\ndistorting capitalist form\u2014it will be preserved and developed in\nthe communist future of the third historical stage.\n\nThis claim goes beyond the familiar suggestion that alienation forms a\nnecessary step in certain Hegelian and Marxist developmental\nnarratives. The suggestion here is that internal to the second stage,\nthe stage of alienation, there is both a problematic separation from\ncommunity and a positive liberation from engulfment. Those who see\nonly the negative thread in alienation, and fail to see \u2018what is\nbeing achieved within in and distorted by it\u2019, will miss an\nimportant, albeit subtle, thread in Marx\u2019s account of the\nprogressive character of capitalism (Cohen 1974: 253).\n\nThere is a lot going on in this schematic discussion of historical\nstages. The point emphasised here is that theorists\u2014even\ncritics\u2014of alienation need not assume that it is a wholly\nnegative phenomena, ethically speaking. Marx, for example, recognises\nthat the moment of alienation, for all its negative features, also\ninvolves the emergence of a good (individuality), which, in due course\n(and freed from the limitations of its historical origins), will be\ncentral to the human flourishing achieved in communist\nsociety.\n5.3 Morality as Alienating\n\nThis claim\u2014that alienation might not be a wholly negative\nphenomenon\u2014concerns the normative dimensions of alienation.\nHowever, it is sometimes suggested that the concept of alienation\nmight provide a standpoint from which morality itself, or at least\nsome forms of it, can be criticised. This looks to be a very\ndifferent kind of thought.\n\nThe broad suggestion is that morality, or certain conceptions of\nmorality, might embody, or encourage, alienation. More precisely,\nmorality, or certain conceptions of morality, might embody or\nencourage a problematic division of self and a problematic separation\nfrom much that is valuable in our lives. Consider, for example,\naccounts of the moral standpoint as requiring universalisation and\nequal consideration of all persons (Railton 1984: 138). It could seem\nthat adopting such a standpoint requires individuals to disown or\ndownplay the relevance of their more personal or partial (as opposed to impartial) beliefs and\nfeelings. The picture of persons divided into cognitive and affective\nparts, with the partial and personal relegated to the downgraded\nsphere of the latter (perhaps conceptualised as something closer to\nmere sentiment than reason) is a familiar one. In addition to that\nproblematic bifurcation of the self, such accounts might seem to cut\nus off from much that is valuable in our lives. If these impersonal\nkinds of moral consideration are to dominate our practical reasoning,\nthen it seems likely that an individual\u2019s particular\nattachments, loyalties, and commitments will have, at best, a marginal\nplace (Railton 1984: 139). In aspiring to adopt \u2018the point of\nview of the universe\u2019\u2014to use the well-known phrase of\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) \u2013 there can sometimes seem to\nbe precious little security or space remaining for, say, friendship,\nlove, and family (Sidgwick 1907: 382). So understood, morality, or\ncertain conceptions of morality, are charged with embodying and\nencouraging alienation in the form of both a divided self, and a\nseparation of self and world.\n\nThe weight and scope of these kinds of concerns about alienation\ncan obviously vary; that is, they might be thought to have more or\nless critical purchase on a wider or narrower range of targets. There\nare various possibilities here. These concerns might, for\nexample, be said to apply: first, only to certain kinds of personality\ntypes inclined to adopt particular moral theories, and not to the\ntheories themselves (Piper 1987); second, only to certain ways of\nformulating particular moral theories (the objections here being\novercome by a more adequate formulation of\nthe particular theories in question); third, only to particular\nmoral theories (such as act utilitarianism, certain forms of\nconsequentialism, or all impartial moral theories) to which they\nconstitute foundational objections (but not to morality as such);\nand, fourth, as a foundational objection that counts\nagainst \u2018the peculiar institution\u2019 of morality itself\n(Williams 1985: 174). Given both that variety and the subject matter\nof this entry, it may not be helpful to generalise much more here.\nHowever, the point is hopefully made that the ethical dimensions of\nthe present topic extend beyond the normative assessment of the\nrelevant separations. Indeed, taking alienation seriously might lead\nus to think more critically about some familiar moral standpoints and\ntheories.\n6. Some (Unresolved) Empirical Issues\n6.1 Content\n\nThe above discussion of the concept of alienation\u2014clarifying its\nbasic shape, sketching some of its theoretical forms, and introducing\na few complexities\u2014still leaves many issues unresolved.\nThese include many empirical and quasi-empirical issues. The\npresent section is concerned with some of the\nempirical assumptions and claims that appear in what might be\ncalled broadly philosophical accounts of alienation of the kind\ndiscussed above. It is not directly concerned with the extensive\nsocial scientific literature on alienation. That latter\nliterature is often preoccupied\nwith \u2018operationalising\u2019 the concept\u2014for\ninstance, treating job satisfaction or absenteeism as proxies of\nalienated work\u2014in order to engineer predictive models in\ndisciplines (including education, psychology, sociology, and\nmanagement studies) dealing with a variety of real world contexts\n(see e.g. Chiaburu et al 2014).\n\nAs an example of some of the empirical dimensions of broadly\nphilosophical accounts of alienation, consider Marx\u2019s\ncharacterisation of capitalist society as characterised by\nseparations which frustrate self-realisation, especially\nself-realisation in work. To come to a considered judgement about the\nplausibility of his views on this topic, one would have to be in a\nposition to assess, amongst other issues, whether work in capitalist\nsocieties is necessarily alienated. One would need to judge not only\nwhether existing work is rightly characterised as alienated (as\nforced, frustrating self-realisation, not intended to satisfy the\nneeds of others, and not appropriately appreciated by those others),\nbut also, if so, whether it could be made meaningful and unalienated\nwithout undermining the very features which made the relevant society\na capitalist one. (There are, of course, also many more\nnormative-looking issues here regarding that account of human\nflourishing: whether, for example, Marx overestimates the value of\ncreative and fulfilling work, and underestimates the value of,\nsay, leisure and intellectual excellence.) Reaching anything like a\nconsidered judgment on these empirical and quasi-empirical issues\nwould clearly require some complicated factual assessments of, amongst\nother issues, the composition and functioning of human nature and the\nextant social world.\n6.2 Extent\n\nA range of complex empirical and quasi-empirical issues also look to\nbe woven into Marx\u2019s views about the historical extent of\nalienation. Consider the various claims about the\nhistorical location and comparative intensity of alienation that can\nbe found in his writings (and in certain secondary\ninterpretations of those writings). These include: first, that\ncertain systematic forms of alienation\u2014including alienation in\nwork\u2014are not a universal feature of human society (not least,\nthey will not be a feature of a future communist order); second, that\nat least some systematic forms of alienation\u2014presumably\nincluding the alienation that Marx identifies as embodied in religious belief \u2014are widespread in pre-capitalist\nsocieties; and third, that systematic forms of alienation are greater\nin contemporary capitalist societies than in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. There seems no good textual or theoretical reason to\nlumber Marx with the view that less systematic forms of alienation\u2014such as the hypothetical estrangement of Gillian from her sister Hanna (which arose from sibling rivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of family crisis)\u2014could never exist under communism.\n\nTake the last of these assorted empirical claims attributed to Marx \u2013 the comparative\nverdict about the extent or intensity of systematic forms of alienation in capitalist\nsocieties. Its plausibility is scarcely incontrovertible given the\namount of sheer productive drudgery, and worse, in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. Nor is it obvious how one might attempt to substantiate the\nempirical dimensions of the claim. The empirical difficulties of\nmeasuring subjective alienation look considerable enough (especially\ngiven the limitations of historical data), but alienation for Marx is\nfundamentally about the frustration of objective human potentials,\nthose separations that prevent self-realisation, perhaps especially\nself-realisation in work. One suggestion, made in this context, is\nthat the scale of alienation in a particular society might be\nindicated by the gap between the liberating potential of human\nproductive powers, on the one hand, and the extent to which that\npotential is reflected in the lives actually lived by producers, on\nthe other (Wood 2004: 44\u201348). Whatever the appeal of that\nsuggestion, the social scientific details of how one might actually\napply that kind of measure in particular historical cases remain\nunclear.\n6.3 Prognosis\n\nRelated worries might also apply to claims about the prognosis for\nalienation, in particular, about whether and how alienation might be\novercome. Consider, for instance, Marx\u2019s view that communist\nsociety will be free of certain systematic forms of alienation, such\nas alienation in work. Marx\u2019s view about communism rests crucially on the judgement that it is the social relations of\ncapitalist society, and not its material or technical arrangements,\nwhich are the cause of systematic forms of alienation. For instance,\nhe holds that it is not the existence of science, technology, and\nindustrialisation, as such, which are at the root of the social and\npsychological ills of alienation, but rather how those factors tend to\nbe organised and used in a capitalist society. (For present\npurposes, just assume that a society is capitalist when its\neconomic structure is based on a particular class division \u2013 in\nwhich producers can only access means of production by selling their\nlabour power\u2014and when production, and much else, is driven\nby a remorseless search for profit.) In volume one of\nCapital, Marx writes approvingly of workers who, through time\nand experience, had learnt \u2018to distinguish between machinery and\nits employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against\nthe material instruments of production, but against the mode in which\nthey are used\u2019 (1996: 432). If this had not been his view, Marx\ncould not have, consistently, also suggested that communist society\n\u2013 which, on his account, is similarly technologically advanced\nand industrial\u2014could avoid this kind of alienation. This\nsuggestion is, nonetheless, strikingly sanguine. Marx is confident,\nfor instance, that the considerable gulf between the gloomy results of\nadopting machinery in the capitalist present (where it increases the\nrepetitiveness of tasks, narrows talents, promotes\n\u2018deskilling\u2019, and so on) and the bright promise of its\nadoption in the communist future (where it will liberate us from\nuncreative tasks, create greater wealth, develop all-round abilities,\nand so on) is easily bridged. However, Marx\u2019s\n\u2018utopophobia\u2019\u2014that is, his reluctance to say very\nmuch, in any close detail, about the future shape of socialist\nsociety \u2013 prevents him from offering any serious discussion\nabout how precisely this might be done (Leopold 2016). As a result,\neven the mildest of sceptics could reasonably worry that a range of\ndifficult empirical and other questions are evaded rather than\nanswered here.\n\nThis issue\u2014whether, and to what extent, alienation can be\novercome in modern societies\u2014is sometimes conflated with the\nissue of whether, and to what extent, alienation is a historically\nuniversal phenomena. To see that these are distinct questions,\nimagine that alienation only emerges in economically developed\nsocieties, that it is a necessary feature of economically developed\nsocieties, and that economically developed societies never revert\nvoluntarily to economically undeveloped ones. These are not\nimplausible claims, but together they seem to entail that, although\nonly a subset of historical societies are scarred by\nalienation, if you happen to live in an economically developed\nsociety, then\u2014involuntary Armageddon apart\u2014alienation will\nremain the fate of you and your successors.\n\nMy aim here is not to make significant progress in resolving any of\nthese empirical and quasi-empirical issues, but rather to\nacknowledge their existence and extent. Since the concept of\nalienation diagnoses a complex range of social ills involving self and\nother, it is perhaps not surprising that a variety of such issues\nare implicated in these various accounts of its proper\ncharacterisation, its historical scope, and the possibilities for\novercoming it. Nonetheless, it remains important to acknowledge the\nexistence and complexity of these empirical and quasi-empirical\nthreads, not least because they are not always adequately recognised\nor dealt with in the broadly philosophical discussions of alienation\nwhich are the focus of the discussion here.
