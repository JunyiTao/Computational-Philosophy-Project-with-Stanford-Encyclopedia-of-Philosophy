    "main_text": "Issues about Diachronic Norms || New Theory\n5.2 New Theory\n\nThe logical learning approach to the problem of old evidence invites\nanother worry. It seems to fail to address a variant of the Mercury\nCase, due to Earman (1992: sec. 5.5):\n\n\nExample (Physics Student). A physics student\njust started studying Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\nLike most physics students, the first thing she learns about the\ntheory, even before hearing any details of the theory itself, is the\nlogical fact \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\) as formulated above. After\nlearning that, this student forms an initial credence 1 in\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), and an initial credence in the new,\nEinsteinian theory. She also lowers her credence in the old, Newtonian\ntheory.\n\n\n\nThe student\u2019s formation of a new, initial credence in\nthe new theory seems to pose a relatively little threat to the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization, which is most naturally construed as\na norm that governs, not credence formation, but credence change. So\nthe more serious problem lies in the student\u2019s change\nof her credence in the old theory. If this credence drop really\nresults from conditionalization on what was just learned,\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), then the credence in \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\)\nmust be boosted to 1 from somewhere below 1, which unfortunately never\nhappens. So it seems that the student\u2019s credence drop violates\nthe Principle of Conditionalization and rightly so, which is known as\nthe problem of new theory. The following presents two reply\nstrategies for Bayesians.\n\nOne reply strategy is to qualify the Conditionalization Principle and\nmake it weaker in order to avoid counterexamples. The following is one\nway to implement this strategy (see\n supplement F\n for another one):\n\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization (Plan/Rule\nVersion). It ought to be that, if one has a plan (or follows a\nrule) for changing credences in the case of learning E, then\nthe plan (or rule) is to conditionalize on E.\n\n\n\nNote how this version is immune from the Physics Student Case: what is\nlearned, \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), is something entirely new to the\nstudent, so the student simply did not have in mind a plan for\nresponding to \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\)\u2014so the if-clause is not\nsatisfied. The Bayesians who adopt this version, such as van Fraassen\n(1989: ch. 7), often add that one is not required to have a\nplan for responding to any particular piece of new evidence.\n\nThe plan version is independently motivated. Note that this version\nputs a normative constraint on the plan that one has at\neach time when one has a plan, whereas the standard version\nconstrains the act of credence change across different\ntimes. So the plan version is different from the standard, act\nversion. But it turns out to be the former, rather then the latter,\nthat is supported by the major existing arguments for the Principle of\nConditionalization. See, for example, the Dutch Book argument by Lewis\n(1999), the expected accuracy argument by Greaves & Wallace\n(2006), and the accuracy dominance argument by Briggs & Pettigrew\n(2020).\n\nWhile the plan version of the Conditionalization Principle is weak\nenough to avoid the Physics Student counterexample, it might be\nworried that it is too weak. There are actually two worries here. The\nfirst worry is that the plan version is too weak because it leaves\nopen an important question: Even if one\u2019s plan for credence\nchange is always a plan to conditionalize on new evidence, should one\nactually follow such a plan whenever new evidence is acquired? For\ndiscussions of this issue, see Levi (1980: ch. 4), van Fraassen (1989:\nch. 7), and Titelbaum (2013a: parts III and IV). (Terminological note:\ninstead of \u2018plan\u2019, Levi uses \u2018confirmational\ncommitment\u2019 and van Fraassen uses \u2018rule\u2019.) The\nsecond worry is that the plan version is too weak because it only\navoids the problem of new theory, without giving a positive account as\nto why the student\u2019s credence in the old theory ought to\ndrop.\n\nA positive account is promised by the next strategy for solving the\nproblem of new theory. It operates with a series of ideas. The first\nidea is that, typically, a person only considers possibilities that\nare not jointly exhaustive, and she only has credences\nconditional on the set C of the considered\npossibilities\u2014lacking an unconditional credence in C\n(Shimony 1970; Salmon 1990). This deviates from the standard Bayesian\nview in allowing two things: credence gaps\n (section 3.1),\n and primitive conditional credences\n (section 3.4).\n The second idea is that the set C of the considered\npossibilities might shrink or expand in time. It might shrink because\nsome of those possibilities are ruled out by new evidence, or it might\nexpand because a new possibility\u2014a new theory\u2014is taken\ninto consideration. The third and last idea is a diachronic norm\n(sketched by Shimony 1970 and Salmon 1990, developed in detail by\nWenmackers & Romeijn 2016):\n\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization\n(Considered Possibilities Version). It ought to be that, if two\npossibilities are under consideration at an earlier time and remain so\nat a later time, then their credence ratio be preserved across those\ntwo times.\n\n\n\nHere, a credence ratio has to be understood in such a way that it can\nexist without any unconditional credence. To see how this is possible,\nsuppose for simplicity that an agent starts with two old theories as\nthe only possibilities under consideration, \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) and\n\\(\\mathsf{old}_2\\), with a credence ratio \\(1:2\\) but without any\nunconditional credence. This can be understood to mean that, while the\nagent lacks an unconditional credence in the set \\(\\{\\mathsf{old}_1 ,\n\\mathsf{old}_2\\}\\), she still has a conditional credence\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+2}\\) in \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) given that set. Now, suppose\nthat this agent then thinks of a new theory: \\(\\mathsf{new}\\). Then,\nby the diachronic norm stated above, the credence ratio among\n\\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\), \\(\\mathsf{old}_2\\), \\(\\mathsf{new}\\) should now be\n\\(1:2:x\\). Notice the change of this agent\u2019s conditional\ncredence in \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) given the varying set of the\nconsidered possibilities: it drops from \\(\\frac{1}{1+2}\\) down to\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+2+x}\\), provided that \\(x>0\\). Wenmackers &\nRomeijn (2016) argues that this is why there appears to be a drop in\nthe student\u2019s credence in the old theory\u2014it is actually a\ndrop in a conditional credence given the varying set of the considered\npossibilities.\n\nThe above account invites a worry from the perspective of rational\nchoice theory. According to the standard construal of Bayesian\ndecision theory, the kind of doxastic state that ought to enter\ndecision-making is unconditional credence rather than\nconditional credence. So Earman (1992: sec. 7.3) is led to think that\nwhat we really need is an epistemology for unconditional\ncredence, which the above account fails to provide. A possible reply\nis anticipated by some Bayesian decision theorists, such as Savage\n(1972: sec. 5.5) and Harsanyi (1985). They argue that, when making a\ndecision, we often only have conditional credences\u2014conditional\non a simplifying assumption that makes the decision problem in\nquestion manageable. For other Bayesian decision theorists who follow\nSavage and Harsanyi, see the references in Joyce (1999: sec. 2.6, 4.2,\n5.5 and 7.1).
