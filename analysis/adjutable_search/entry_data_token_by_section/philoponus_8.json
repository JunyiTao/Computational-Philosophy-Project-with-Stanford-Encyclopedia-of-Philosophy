    "main_text": "Theological Treatises\n4. Theological Treatises\n\n\n By the end of the 530s, as noted above (2.1), Philoponus seems to have stopped fighting\nphilosophical battles altogether; his career as a philosopher was\nover. Thenceforward he devoted himself solely to writing on Christian theological\ntopics. Since there is no evidence that he belonged to the clerical\norder, it is difficult to imagine the institutional context of his life as a\nChristian theologian. He published his theological treatises under the same name\nby which he had established himself as a commentator, I\u00f4\u00e1nn\u00eas ho\nGrammatik\u00f3s, yet it seems hard to imagine him still working as a professor of grammar or literature in the Alexandrian system of higher education. His other epithet, \u2018phil\u00f3ponos\u2019 (lover of toil) is probably\nbest interpreted as an acknowledgment of his literary productivity,\nalthough it may also be an indication that he was one of a group of zealous Christian\nbrethren in Egypt who called themselves by that name.\n",
