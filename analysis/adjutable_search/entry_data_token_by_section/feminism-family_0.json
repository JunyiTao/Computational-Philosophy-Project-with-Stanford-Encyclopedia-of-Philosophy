Why The Family is Subject to Principles of Justice\n\n\nFeminists argue that the so-called private realms of family, sex and\nreproduction must be part of the political realm and thus subject to\nprinciples of justice for three distinct reasons:\n\nFamilies are not \u201cnatural\u201d orderings, but social\ninstitutions backed up by laws. For example, marriage is a social\ninstitution. Therefore, the state cannot choose not to intervene in\nfamilies: the only question is how it should intervene and on what\nbasis.\nThe state has a critical interest in the development of future\ncitizens.\nThe division of labor in traditional families constrains women's\nopportunities and freedoms in the wider society.\n\n\n\nLet us consider each of these three arguments in turn.\n",
