    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\u2019s Finitistic Constructivism || Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Finitism\n2.2 Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Finitism\n\nThe single most important difference between the Early and Middle\nWittgenstein is that, in the middle period, Wittgenstein rejects\nquantification over an infinite mathematical domain, stating that,\ncontra his Tractarian view, such \u2018propositions\u2019\nare not infinite conjunctions and infinite disjunctions simply because\nthere are no such things.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s principal reasons for developing a\nfinitistic Philosophy of Mathematics are as follows.\n\nMathematics as Human Invention: According to the middle\nWittgenstein, we invent mathematics, from which it follows that\nmathematics and so-called mathematical objects do not exist\nindependently of our inventions. Whatever is mathematical is\nfundamentally a product of human activity.\nMathematical Calculi Consist Exclusively of Intensions and\nExtensions: Given that we have invented only mathematical extensions\n(e.g., symbols, finite sets, finite sequences, propositions, axioms)\nand mathematical intensions (e.g., rules of inference and\ntransformation, irrational numbers as rules), these\nextensions and intensions, and the calculi in which they reside,\nconstitute the entirety of mathematics. (It should be noted that\nWittgenstein\u2019s usage of \u2018extension\u2019 and\n\u2018intension\u2019 as regards mathematics differs markedly from\nstandard contemporary usage, wherein the extension of a predicate is\nthe set of entities that satisfy the predicate and the intension of a\npredicate is the meaning of, or expressed by, the predicate. Put\nsuccinctly, Wittgenstein thinks that the extension of this notion of\nconcept-and-extension from the domain of existent (i.e., physical)\nobjects to the so-called domain of \u201cmathematical objects\u201d\nis based on a faulty analogy and engenders conceptual confusion. See\n#1 just below.)\n\n\nThese two reasons have at least five immediate consequences\nfor Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics.\n\nRejection of Infinite Mathematical Extensions: Given that a\nmathematical extension is a symbol (\u2018sign\u2019) or a finite\nconcatenation of symbols extended in space, there is a\ncategorical difference between mathematical intensions and (finite)\nmathematical extensions, from which it follows that \u201cthe\nmathematical infinite\u201d resides only in recursive rules (i.e.,\nintensions). An infinite mathematical extension (i.e., a\ncompleted, infinite mathematical extension) is a\ncontradiction-in-terms\nRejection of Unbounded Quantification in Mathematics: Given that\nthe mathematical infinite can only be a recursive rule, and given that\na mathematical proposition must have sense, it follows that there\ncannot be an infinite mathematical proposition (i.e., an infinite\nlogical product or an infinite logical sum).\nAlgorithmic Decidability vs. Undecidability: If mathematical\nextensions of all kinds are necessarily finite, then, in\nprinciple, all mathematical propositions are algorithmically\ndecidable, from which it follows that an \u201cundecidable\nmathematical proposition\u201d is a contradiction-in-terms. Moreover,\nsince mathematics is essentially what we have and what we know,\nWittgenstein restricts algorithmic decidability to knowing\nhow to decide a proposition with a known decision procedure.\nAnti-Foundationalist Account of Real Numbers: Since there are no\ninfinite mathematical extensions, irrational numbers are rules, not\nextensions. Given that an infinite set is a recursive rule (or an\ninduction) and no such rule can generate all of the things\nmathematicians call (or want to call) \u201creal numbers\u201d, it\nfollows that there is no set of \u2018all\u2019 the real numbers and\nno such thing as the mathematical continuum.\nRejection of Different Infinite Cardinalities: Given the\nnon-existence of infinite mathematical extensions, Wittgenstein\nrejects the standard interpretation of Cantor\u2019s diagonal proof\nas a proof of infinite sets of greater and lesser cardinalities.\n\n\nSince we invent mathematics in its entirety, we do not\ndiscover pre-existing mathematical objects or facts or that\nmathematical objects have certain properties, for \u201cone cannot\ndiscover any connection between parts of mathematics or logic that was\nalready there without one knowing\u201d (PG 481). In\nexamining mathematics as a purely human invention, Wittgenstein tries\nto determine what exactly we have invented and why exactly, in his\nopinion, we erroneously think that there are infinite mathematical\nextensions.\n\nIf, first, we examine what we have invented, we see that we have\ninvented formal calculi consisting of finite extensions and\nintensional rules. If, more importantly, we endeavour to determine\nwhy we believe that infinite mathematical extensions exist\n(e.g., why we believe that the actual infinite is intrinsic to\nmathematics), we find that we conflate mathematical\nintensions and mathematical extensions, erroneously\nthinking that there is \u201ca dualism\u201d of \u201cthe law and\nthe infinite series obeying it\u201d (PR \u00a7180). For\ninstance, we think that because a real number \u201cendlessly yields\nthe places of a decimal fraction\u201d (PR \u00a7186), it\nis \u201ca totality\u201d (WVC 81\u201382, note\n1), when, in reality, \u201c[a]n irrational number isn\u2019t the\nextension of an infinite decimal fraction,\u2026 it\u2019s a\nlaw\u201d (PR \u00a7181) which \u201cyields\nextensions\u201d (PR \u00a7186). A law and a list are\nfundamentally different; neither can \u2018give\u2019 what the other\ngives (WVC 102\u2013103). Indeed, \u201cthe mistake in the\nset-theoretical approach consists time and again in treating laws and\nenumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of thing\u201d\n(PG 461).\n\nClosely related with this conflation of intensions and extensions is\nthe fact that we mistakenly act as if the word \u2018infinite\u2019\nis a \u201cnumber word\u201d, because in ordinary discourse we\nanswer the question \u201chow many?\u201d with both (PG\n463; cf. PR \u00a7142). But \u201c\u2018[i]nfinite\u2019\nis not a quantity\u201d, Wittgenstein insists (WVC\n228); the word \u2018infinite\u2019 and a number word like\n\u2018five\u2019 do not have the same syntax. The words\n\u2018finite\u2019 and \u2018infinite\u2019 do not function as\nadjectives on the words \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018set\u2019,\n(WVC 102), for the terms \u201cfinite class\u201d and\n\u201cinfinite class\u201d use \u2018class\u2019 in completely\ndifferent ways (WVC 228). An infinite class is a recursive\nrule or \u201can induction\u201d, whereas the symbol for a finite\nclass is a list or extension (PG 461). It is because an\ninduction has much in common with the multiplicity of a finite class\nthat we erroneously call it an infinite class (PR\n\u00a7158).\n\nIn sum, because a mathematical extension is necessarily a finite\nsequence of symbols, an infinite mathematical extension is a\ncontradiction-in-terms. This is the foundation of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nfinitism. Thus, when we say, e.g., that \u201cthere are infinitely\nmany even numbers\u201d, we are not saying \u201cthere are\nan infinite number of even numbers\u201d in the same sense\nas we can say \u201cthere are 27 people in this house\u201d; the\ninfinite series of natural numbers is nothing but \u201cthe infinite\npossibility of finite series of numbers\u201d\u2014\u201c[i]t is\nsenseless to speak of the whole infinite number series, as if\nit, too, were an extension\u201d (PR \u00a7144). The\ninfinite is understood rightly when it is understood, not as a\nquantity, but as an \u201cinfinite possibility\u201d (PR\n\u00a7138).\n\nGiven Wittgenstein\u2019s rejection of infinite mathematical\nextensions, he adopts finitistic, constructive views on mathematical\nquantification, mathematical decidability, the nature of real numbers,\nand Cantor\u2019s diagonal proof of the existence of infinite sets of\ngreater cardinalities.\n\nSince a mathematical set is a finite extension, we cannot\nmeaningfully quantify over an infinite mathematical domain,\nsimply because there is no such thing as an infinite mathematical\ndomain (i.e., totality, set), and, derivatively, no such things as\ninfinite conjunctions or disjunctions (G.E. Moore 1955: 2\u20133; cf.\nAWL 6; and PG 281).\n\n\n[I]t still looks now as if the quantifiers make no sense for numbers.\nI mean: you can\u2019t say \u2018\\((n) \\phi n\\)\u2019, precisely\nbecause \u2018all natural numbers\u2019 isn\u2019t a bounded\nconcept. But then neither should one say a general proposition follows\nfrom a proposition about the nature of number.\n\nBut in that case it seems to me that we can\u2019t use\ngenerality\u2014all, etc.\u2014in mathematics at all. There\u2019s\nno such thing as \u2018all numbers\u2019, simply because there are\ninfinitely many. (PR \u00a7126; PR \u00a7129)\n\n\n\u2018Extensionalists\u2019 who assert that\n\u201c\\(\\varepsilon(0).\\varepsilon(1).\\varepsilon(2)\\) and so\non\u201d is an infinite logical product (PG 452) assume or\nassert that finite and infinite conjunctions are close\ncousins\u2014that the fact that we cannot write down or enumerate all\nof the conjuncts \u2018contained\u2019 in an infinite conjunction is\nonly a \u201chuman weakness\u201d, for God could surely do so and\nGod could surely survey such a conjunction in a single glance and\ndetermine its truth-value. According to Wittgenstein, however, this is\nnot a matter of human limitation. Because we\nmistakenly think that \u201can infinite conjunction\u201d is similar\nto \u201can enormous conjunction\u201d, we erroneously reason that\njust as we cannot determine the truth-value of an enormous conjunction\nbecause we don\u2019t have enough time, we similarly cannot, due to\nhuman limitations, determine the truth-value of an infinite\nconjunction (or disjunction). But the difference here is not one of\ndegree but of kind: \u201cin the sense in which it is impossible to\ncheck an infinite number of propositions it is also impossible to try\nto do so\u201d (PG 452). This applies, according to\nWittgenstein, to human beings, but more importantly, it applies also\nto God (i.e., an omniscient being), for even God cannot write down or\nsurvey infinitely many propositions because for him too the series is\nnever-ending or limitless and hence the \u2018task\u2019 is not a\ngenuine task because it cannot, in principle, be done (i.e.,\n\u201cinfinitely many\u201d is not a number word). As Wittgenstein\nsays at (PR 128; cf. PG 479): \u201c\u2018Can God\nknow all the places of the expansion of \\(\\pi\\)?\u2019 would have\nbeen a good question for the schoolmen to ask\u201d, for the question\nis strictly \u2018senseless\u2019. As we shall shortly see, on\nWittgenstein\u2019s account, \u201c[a] statement about all\nnumbers is not represented by means of a proposition, but by means of\ninduction\u201d (WVC 82).\n\nSimilarly, there is no such thing as a mathematical proposition about\nsome number\u2014no such thing as a mathematical proposition\nthat existentially quantifies over an infinite domain (PR\n\u00a7173).\n\n\nWhat is the meaning of such a mathematical proposition as\n\u2018\\((\\exists n) 4 + n = 7\\)\u2019? It might be a\ndisjunction\u2014\\((4 + 0 = 7) \\vee{}\\) \\((4 + 1 = 7) \\vee {}\\) etc. ad\ninf. But what does that mean? I can understand a proposition with\na beginning and an end. But can one also understand a proposition with\nno end? (PR \u00a7127)\n\n\nWe are particularly seduced by the feeling or belief that an infinite\nmathematical disjunction makes good sense in the case where\nwe can provide a recursive rule for generating each next member of an\ninfinite sequence. For example, when we say \u201cThere exists an odd\nperfect number\u201d we are asserting that, in the infinite sequence\nof odd numbers, there is (at least) one odd number that is\nperfect\u2014we are asserting \u2018\\(\\phi(1) \\vee \\phi(3) \\vee\n\\phi(5) \\vee{}\\) and so on\u2019 and we know what would make it true\nand what would make it false (PG 451). The mistake here made,\naccording to Wittgenstein (PG 451), is that we are implicitly\n\u201ccomparing the proposition\n\u2018\\((\\exists n)\\)\u2026\u2019 with the proposition\u2026\n\u2018There are two foreign words on this page\u2019\u201d, which\ndoesn\u2019t provide the grammar of the former\n\u2018proposition\u2019, but only indicates an analogy in their\nrespective rules.\n\nOn Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate finitism, an expression\nquantifying over an infinite domain is never a meaningful\nproposition, not even when we have proved, for instance, that a\nparticular number \\(n\\) has a particular property.\n\n\nThe important point is that, even in the case where I am given that\n\\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\), I ought not to say \u2018\\((\\exists x,\ny, z, n) (x^n + y^n = z^n)\\)\u2019, since taken extensionally\nthat\u2019s meaningless, and taken intensionally this doesn\u2019t\nprovide a proof of it. No, in this case I ought to express only the\nfirst equation. (PR \u00a7150)\n\n\nThus, Wittgenstein adopts the radical position that all\nexpressions that quantify over an infinite domain, whether\n\u2018conjectures\u2019 (e.g., Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture, the Twin\nPrime Conjecture) or \u201cproved general theorems\u201d (e.g.,\n\u201cEuclid\u2019s Prime Number Theorem\u201d, the Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra), are meaningless (i.e.,\n\u2018senseless\u2019; \u2018sinnlos\u2019) expressions\nas opposed to \u201cgenuine mathematical\nproposition[s]\u201d (PR \u00a7168). These\nexpressions are not (meaningful) mathematical propositions, according\nto Wittgenstein, because the Law of the Excluded Middle does not\napply, which means that \u201cwe aren\u2019t dealing with\npropositions of mathematics\u201d (PR \u00a7151). The\ncrucial question why and in exactly what sense the Law of the\nExcluded Middle does not apply to such expressions will be answered in\nthe next section.\n",
