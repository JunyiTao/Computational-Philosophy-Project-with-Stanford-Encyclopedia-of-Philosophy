    "main_text": "\n\nProcess philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic and\nthat the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of any\ncomprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place within\nit. Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously\nchanging, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing\nreality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features\nare either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and\nderivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophy\nbegins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysics\nmarginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity or\nbecoming\u2014if it is the way we experience reality, how\nshould we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varieties\nof becoming\u2014for instance, the uniform going on of activities\nversus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have the\nsame way of occurring quite independently of what is\ncoming about? How can we best classify into different kinds\nof occurrences? How can we understand the emergence of apparently\nnovel conditions? Can we conceive of becoming or dynamic being\nindependently of space and time?\n\nWhile process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is\ncontinuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there\nare temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But\nthey take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior of\ndynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing\ninteraction of processes. In order to articulate a process view of\nreality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the\nstandard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the\nstatic view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of\npredicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that\nare exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what\nis from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical\nbias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as\na metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise\u2014pushing\nfor a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of\ndeveloping new explanatory concepts and providing arguments\nfor why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.\n\nProcess philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it has\nfull systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of being\nas becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporal\nexistence, the kinds of dynamic entities, including mental occurrences\nand actions, the relationship between mind and world, and the\nrealization of values in action. Some approaches to process philosophy\nare conceived on the grand scale and offer a full-scope metaphysics in\nthe form of a systematic theory or comprehensive philosophical view.\nOther approaches, especially more recent ones, take a more modest\napproach. They pursue the specific problems that the various\nphilosophical disciplines are engaged in while focusing on the dynamic\naspects of each sub-domain. Such process ontologies, process ethics,\nprocess epistemologies, process theories of mind etc. are\ncontributions to \u2018process philosophy\u2019 more broadly\nconceived as a research paradigm of philosophical inquiry. They share\nthe guiding idea that natural existence consists in modes of becoming\nand types of occurrences. \u2018Processists\u2019 agree that the\nworld is an assembly of physical, organic, social, and cognitive\nprocesses that interact at and across levels of dynamic organization.\nHowever, within that broad framework, process philosophers debate\nabout how such a world of processes is to be construed, how it relates\nto the human mind (which is another process) and how the dynamic\nnature of reality relates to our scientific theories. In consequence,\nprocess philosophers also differ in their view on the role of\nphilosophy itself and in their choice of theoretical style.\n\nProcess philosophy opposes \u2018substance metaphysics,\u2019 the\ndominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy since\nAristotle. Substance metaphysics proceeds from the\nintuition\u2014first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher\nParmenides\u2014that being should be thought of as simple, hence as\ninternally undifferentiated and unchangeable. Substance metaphysicians\nrecast this intuition as the claim that the primary units of reality\n(called \u201csubstances\u201d) must be static\u2014they must be\nwhat they are at any instant in time. In contrast to the\nsubstance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, with its typical\nfocus on eternalist being and on what there is, process\nphilosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as well\nas ways of occurring. In some process accounts, becoming is\nthe mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic\nbeings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoing\nself-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode of\nbeing of different kinds of dynamic beings and the process\nthat generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to develop\na taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),\nprocessists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysics\nwith a set of new basic categories. Central among these is the notion\nof a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it\n\u2018does.\u2019 This type of functionally individuated entity is\noften labeled \u2018process\u2019 in a technical sense of this term\nthat does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some\nof the \u2018processes\u2019 postulated by process philosophers\nare\u2014in agreement with our common-sense understanding of\nprocesses\u2014temporal developments that can be analyzed as\ntemporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each\nsuch stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any\nother. But some of the \u2018processes\u2019 that process\nphilosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this\nsense\u2014they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental\noccurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that\nrealize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby\nconstitute the directionality of time. What holds for all dynamic\nentities labelled \u2018processes,\u2019 however, is that they\noccur\u2014they are in some fashion intimately connected to\ntime, and often, though not necessarily, are related to the\ndirectionality or to the passage of time.\n\nProcess philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophical\nreasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, and\naction as fundamental features of reality. The perhaps most powerful\nargument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatory\nscope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,\nwe can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of\nentities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about\nour world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement to\nconsciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to\ninstitutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to\nclimate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results in\ncognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a\nprocess metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the\nmind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for the\nprocessist criticism of the focus on substance in Western philosophy.\nThe bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive\ndispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in\ntheoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static\nentities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures)\nat the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast,\nprocess philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language\ngroup and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the\ngreat schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process\nphilosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since only if\nwe re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to\ngrips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of\nartificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality,\nand investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope\nof moral obligation. Thus contemporary process philosophy holds out\nthe promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing\ntasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century. First, it\nprovides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics\nthat can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.\nSecond, it can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an\nintercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research\non global knowledge representation by means of an ontological\nframework that is no longer parochially Western. Third, it supplies\nconcepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected\ntechnology development, and enable the cultural and ethical\nimagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes\nengendered by the increased use of technology, especially\nautomation.\n",
