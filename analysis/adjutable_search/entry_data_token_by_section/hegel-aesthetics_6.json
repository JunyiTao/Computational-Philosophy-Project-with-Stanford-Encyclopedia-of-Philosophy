    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Systematic Aesthetics or Philosophy of Art || Ideal Beauty as such\n6.1 Ideal Beauty as such\n\n\nHegel is well aware that art can perform various functions: it can\nteach, edify, provoke, adorn, and so on. His concern, however, is to\nidentify art\u2019s proper and most distinctive function. This, he claims,\nis to give intuitive, sensuous expression to the freedom of\nspirit. The point of art, therefore, is not to be\n\u201crealistic\u201d\u2014to imitate or mirror the contingencies\nof everyday life\u2014but to show us what divine and\nhuman freedom look like. Such sensuous expression of\nspiritual freedom is what Hegel calls the \u201cIdeal,\u201d or true\nbeauty.\n\n\nThe realm of the sensuous is the realm of individual things in space\nand time. Freedom is given sensuous expression, therefore, when it is\nembodied in an individual who stands alone in his or her\n\u201cself-enjoyment, repose, and bliss [Seligkeit]\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 179). Such an individual must not be abstract\nand formal (as, for example, in the early Greek Geometric style), nor\nshould he be static and rigid (as in much ancient Egyptian sculpture),\nbut his body and posture should be visibly animated by freedom and\nlife, without, however, sacrificing the stillness and serenity that\nbelongs to ideal self-containment. Such ideal beauty, Hegel claims, is\nfound above all in fifth- and fourth-century Greek sculptures of the\ngods, such as the Dresden Zeus (a cast of which Hegel saw in the early\n1820s) or Praxiteles\u2019 Cnidian Aphrodite (see\nPK\u00c4, 143 and Houlgate 2007, 58).\n\n\nAncient Greek sculpture, which Hegel would have known almost\nexclusively from Roman copies or from plaster casts, presents what he\ncalls pure or \u201cabsolute\u201d beauty (PK\u00c4, \n124). It does not, however, exhaust the idea of beauty, for it does not\ngive us beauty in its most concrete and developed form. This\nwe find in ancient Greek drama\u2014especially tragedy\u2014in\nwhich free individuals proceed to action that leads to conflict and,\nfinally, to resolution (sometimes violently, as in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone, sometimes peacefully, as in Aeschylus\u2019\nOresteian trilogy). The gods represented in Greek sculpture\nare beautiful because their physical shape perfectly embodies their\nspiritual freedom and is not marred by marks of physical frailty or\ndependence. The principal heroes and heroines of Greek tragedy are\nbeautiful because their free activity is informed and animated by an\nethical interest or \u201cpathos\u201d (such as care for the family,\nas in the case of Antigone, or concern for the welfare of the state,\nas in the case of Creon), rather than by petty human foibles or\npassions.  These heroes are not allegorical representations of\nabstract virtues, but are living human beings with imagination,\ncharacter and free will; but what moves them is a passion for an\naspect of our ethical life, an aspect that is supported and\npromoted by a god.\n\n\nThis distinction between pure beauty, found in Greek\nsculpture, and the more concrete beauty found in Greek drama\nmeans that ideal beauty actually takes two subtly different forms.\nBeauty takes these different forms because pure sculptural\nbeauty\u2014though it is the pinnacle of art\u2019s achievement\u2014has\na certain abstractness about it. Beauty is the sensuous\nexpression of freedom and so must exhibit the concreteness, animation\nand humanity that are missing, for example, in Egyptian sculpture. Yet\nsince pure beauty, as exemplified by Greek sculpture, is spiritual\nfreedom immersed in spatial, bodily shape, it lacks the more\nconcrete dynamism of action in time, action that is animated\nby imagination and language. This is what lends a certain\n\u201cabstractness\u201d (and, indeed, coldness) to pure beauty\n(PK\u00c4, 57, 125). If art\u2019s role is to give sensuous\nexpression to true freedom, however, it must move beyond\nabstraction towards concreteness. This means that it must move beyond\npure beauty to the more concrete and genuinely human beauty\nof drama. These two kinds of ideal beauty thus constitute the most\nappropriate objects of art and, taken together, form what Hegel calls\nthe \u201ccentre\u201d (Mittelpunkt) of art itself\n(PK\u00c4, 126).\n",
