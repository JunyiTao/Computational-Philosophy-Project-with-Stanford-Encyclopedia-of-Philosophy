    "main_text": "Failures of Determinacy\n9. Failures of Determinacy\n\nGrice\u2019s Determinacy condition states that S\nconversationally implicates p only if S has to\nbelieve (and implicate) p if S\u2019s utterance is\nto be consistent with the Cooperative Principle. Determinacy is a key\npremise in the working-out schema, so Calculability depends on it. As\n \u00a78\n illustrated, however, there are normally many alternative ways to be\ncooperative, and contribute what is required by the conversation, even\nwhen the meanings and referents of the words used are taken as\ngiven.\n\nGrice believed irony involves flouting Quality. Here is Grice\u2019s\noft-repeated \u201cgloss\u201d applied to\n (2),\n in which Don said \u201cThe weather\u2019s lovely\u201d during a\nblizzard.\n\n\nIt is perfectly obvious to Don and his audience (Carla) that what Don\nhas said is something he does not believe, and the audience knows that\nDon knows that is obvious to the audience. So \u2026 Don must be\ntrying to get across some other proposition than the one he purports\nto be putting forward. This must be some obviously related\nproposition; the most obviously related proposition is the\ncontradictory of the one he purports to be putting forward. (After\nGrice 1975:\n 34).[44]\n\n\nWhile irony often involves saying something obviously false, it need\nnot have been obvious to Carla in\n (2)\n that Don believed the weather was unlovely. She may have had no\nindependent source of information about his weather. Don would also\nhave made a suitable contribution to the conversation if he had meant\nand believed that the weather is lovely. So Determinacy is unsatisfied\nin irony when the speaker could have been speaking literally,\nbelieving what was said (W. Davis 1998: \u00a73.3; see even Grice\n1978: 53).\n\nMany have observed that the obvious falsity of what speakers say may\nsignal that they mean something else, but it does not tell us what\nelse they mean (e.g., Levinson 1983: 157\u20138; Lepore & Stone\n2015: 38\u20139). Indeed, metaphor is another case in which Grice\n(1975: 34) takes the speaker to be flouting Quality (Huang 2014:\n35\u20136).  So the flouting of Quality does not tell us which\nfigure of speech Don is using. He would have made a suitable\ncontribution to the conversation if he had been engaging in metaphor\ninstead of irony, meaning and believing that relations between he and\nhis partner (the \u201cweather\u201d in the cabin) are fine.\n\nMetaphors are often difficult to interpret. Suppose a commentator says\n\u201cIraq was Bush\u2019s Vietnam\u201d, referring to George W.\nBush and the second Gulf War. Did she mean that the U.S. lost in Iraq\nthe way it lost in Vietnam? That the reasons for going to war in Iraq\nwere as misguided as those that got the U.S. into Vietnam? Or did she\nperhaps mean that even though the U.S. did not secure all its\nobjectives, the Iraq war was still worth fighting? She could mean and\nbelieve any of these things and still be making a useful contribution.\nLepore & Stone (2015: Ch. 10) describe such metaphors as inviting\nhearers to imagine all the things the speaker might have meant. Grice\n(1975: 39\u201340) himself acknowledged such cases when he said\nthat\n\n\nthere may be many possible specific explanations \u2026 ; and if the\nlist of these is open, the implicatum will have just the kind of\nindeterminacy that many implicata do in fact\n have.[45]\n\n\nBut to say this is to deny Determinacy and\n Calculability.[46]\n\nSaul (2001, 2002, 2010) and M. S. Green (2002) suggested that\n\u201cimplicature\u201d be defined normatively, as\nproperly implicating something. W. Davis (2007a) replied that\nwhile determinacy is more plausible as a norm, similar considerations\nshow that it is not required even for properly meaning one thing by\nsaying something else. For example, a speaker who says \u201cI ate\nsome of the cookies\u201d could properly be meaning either \u201cI\nate them all\u201d (engaging in understatement), or \u201cI did not\neat them all\u201d (quantity implicature), or \u201cI do not know\nwhether I ate them all\u201d (ignorance implicature). None of these\ncontributions is required given that all would be appropriate.\n\nRysiew (2000: 577\u20138) suggested weakening the determinacy\ncondition by replacing \u201chas to believe (and implicate)\np\u201d with \u201cis likely to believe (and\nimplicate) p\u201d. As he notes, hearers commonly use\nabduction to figure out what speakers have implicated (cf. Hobbs et\nal. 1993; Geurts 2010: 34\u20135). Abduction is a specific form of\ninductive or non-demonstrative reasoning in which a hypothesis is\ninferred to be true from the fact that it provides the best\nexplanation of the data. By their nature, non-demonstrative methods\nare not guaranteed to succeed. This fact of life is no reason to shun\ninduction when seeking to discover implicatures. W. Davis (1998:\n66\u20138) had observed, though, that an implicature can exist and be\nconversational even though the available evidence does not make that\nimplicature (or belief) more likely than others. The problems of\nindeterminacy and overgeneration show, in particular, that the Gricean\nhypotheses provide neither the only nor the best explanations of the\ndata, making the inferences fallacious instances of abductive\nreasoning.\n",
