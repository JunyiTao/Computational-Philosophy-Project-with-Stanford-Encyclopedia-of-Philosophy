The reception of his Les\n\u00c9poques de la Nature, for example, was uneven (Roger\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d in Buffon 1779, [1988, cxxiv]). Although\nthe main body of the Natural History was translated three\nseparate times into English (William Kenrick and J. Murdoch\n[1775\u201376]; William Smellie [1785], James S. Barr [1792], the\nEpochs was never translated into English until recently\n(Zalasiewicz et al., 2018), and it seems to have played an\ninsignificant role in anglophone discussions, in contrast, for\nexample, to the major impact of the works of Linnaeus, which received\na wide British exposition and translation. The boldly speculative\ncharacter of the Epochs was also at odds with the new\nprofessionalized inquiries into geology and natural history undertaken\nby a younger generation of naturalists who may have adopted\nBuffon\u2019s naturalism and extension of geochronology, but not his\ngrand rhetorical style (Rudwick 2005: chp. 3).\n\nHistorical research has shown, however, that the Epochs had\nan influential history in the Germanies (Schmitt, 2019). The treatise\nwas quickly (1781) translated into German at St. Petersburg and it\nseems to have played an important role in the development of German\nhistoricism (Reill 1992). Although linkages are in need of further\nscholarly research, the impact of Buffon\u2019s Epochs on\nthe historical transformism sketched out a few years later by Johann\nGottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) in the first volume of his\nmagisterial Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der\nMenschheit (1784\u2013 91) is suggested by several lines of\nevidence (Zammito 2018: 180\u2013185, 2018b).\n\nHerder departed markedly from Buffon, however, in developing his own\nhistorical theory of the cosmos and the development of life, and\neventually of human culture, on a framework of teleological progress\nbased on a \u201cvital\u201d theory of matter. For Herder, not only\nthe individual organism, but nature as a whole develops under the\ncausation of an internal organic force that leads it to develop higher\nand higher stages of life, eventually resulting in the ultimate\ndevelopment of humankind in history.\n",
