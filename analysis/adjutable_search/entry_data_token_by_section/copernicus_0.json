    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nNicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473, the youngest of four\nchildren of Nicolaus Copernicus, Sr., a well-to-do merchant who had\nmoved to Torun from Cracow, and Barbara Watzenrode, the daughter of a\nleading merchant family in Torun. The city, on the Vistula River, had\nbeen an important inland port in the Hanseatic League. However,\nfighting between the Order of the Teutonic Knights and the Prussian\nUnion in alliance with the Kingdom of Poland ended in 1466, and West\nPrussia, which included Torun, was ceded to Poland, and Torun was\ndeclared a free city of the Polish kingdom. Thus the child of a German\nfamily was a subject of the Polish crown.\n\nThe father died in 1483, and the children\u2019s maternal uncle,\nLucas Watzenrode (1447\u20131512), took them under his protection.\nWatzenrode was a very successful cleric \u2013 he was to become\nbishop of Warmia (Ermland in German) in 1489 \u2013 and he both\nfacilitated his nephew\u2019s advancement in the church and directed\nhis education. In 1491 Copernicus enrolled in the University of\nCracow. There is no record of his having obtained a degree, which was\nnot unusual at the time as he did not need a bachelor\u2019s degree\nfor his ecclesiastical career or even to study for a higher degree.\nBut the University of Cracow offered courses in mathematics,\nastronomy, and astrology (see Goddu 25\u201333 on all the university\nofferings), and Copernicus\u2019s interest was sparked, which is\nattested to by his acquisition of books in these subjects while at\n Cracow.[1]\n\nIn 1495 Watzenrode arranged Copernicus\u2019s election as canon of\nthe chapter of Frombork (Frauenberg in German) of the Cathedral\nChapter of Warmia, an administrative position just below that of\nbishop. He assumed the post two years later, and his financial\nsituation was secure for life. In the meantime, following in his\nuncle\u2019s footsteps, Copernicus went to the University of Bologna\nin 1496 to study canon law (see Goddu part 2 on what Copernicus may\nhave encountered in Italy). While at Bologna he lived with the\nastronomy professor Domenico Maria Novara and made his first\nastronomical observations. In addition, as Rosen (1971, 323) noted,\n\u201cIn establishing close contact with Novara, Copernicus met,\nperhaps for the first time in his life, a mind that dared to challenge\nthe authority of [Ptolemy] the most eminent ancient writer in his\nchosen fields of study.\u201d Copernicus also gave a lecture on\nmathematics in Rome, which may have focused on astronomy.\n\nCopernicus\u2019s studies at Bologna provided an advantage he did not\nhave at Cracow \u2013 a teacher of Greek. Humanism began to\ninfiltrate the Italian universities in the fifteenth century. As\nGrendler (510) remarked, \u201cBy the last quarter of the century,\npractically all universities had one or several humanists, many of\nthem major scholars.\u201d Antonio Cortesi Urceo, called Codro,\nbecame professor at Bologna in 1482 and added Greek several years\nlater. Copernicus may have studied with him, for Copernicus translated\ninto Latin the letters of the seventh-century Byzantine author\nTheophylactus Simocatta (MW 27\u201371) from the 1499\nedition of a collection of Greek letters produced by the Venetian\nhumanist printer Aldus Manutius. Aldus had dedicated his edition to\nUrceo. Copernicus had his translation printed in 1509, his only\npublication prior to the On the Revolutions (De\nrevolutionibus). It is important to note that Copernicus\u2019s\nacquisition of a good reading knowledge of Greek was critical for his\nstudies in astronomy because major works by Greek astronomers,\nincluding Ptolemy, had not yet been translated into Latin, the\nlanguage of the universities at the time.\n\nCopernicus left Bologna for Frombork in 1501 without having obtained\nhis degree. The chapter then approved another leave of absence for\nCopernicus to study medicine at the University of Padua. The medical\ncurriculum did not just include medicine, anatomy, and the like when\nCopernicus studied it. Siraisi (1990, 16) noted that \u201cthe\nreception in twelfth-century western Europe of Greek and Islamic\ntechnical astronomy and astrology fostered the development of medical\nastrology\u2026the actual practice of medical astrology was greatest\nin the West between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries.\u201d\nAstrology was taught in the medical schools of Italy. \u201cThe\nimportance attached to the study of the stars in medieval medical\neducation derived from a general and widely held belief that the\nheavenly bodies play an intermediary role in the creation of things\nhere below and continue to influence them throughout their existence.\nThe actual uses of astrology in medical diagnosis and treatment by\nlearned physicians were many and various. \u2018Astrological\nmedicine\u2019 is a vague and unsatisfactory term that can embrace\nany or all of the following: first, to pay attention to the supposed\neffect of astrological birth signs or signs at conception on the\nconstitution and character of one\u2019s patients; second, to vary\ntreatment according to various celestial conditions\u2026third, to\nconnect the doctrine of critical days in illness with astrological\nfeatures, usually phases of the moon; and fourth, to predict or\nexplain epidemics with reference to planetary conjunctions, the\nappearance of comets, or weather conditions\u201d (Siraisi 1981,\n141\u201342). It is true that astrology required that medical\nstudents acquire some grounding in astronomy; nevertheless, it is\nlikely that Copernicus studied astrology while at the University of\n Padua.[2]\n\nCopernicus did not receive his medical degree from Padua; the degree\nwould have taken three years, and Copernicus had only been granted a\ntwo-year leave of absence by his chapter. Instead he matriculated in\nthe University of Ferrara, from which he obtained a doctorate in canon\nlaw. But he did not return to his chapter in Frombork; rather he went\nto live with his uncle in the episcopal palace in Lidzbark-Warminski\n(Heilsberg in German). Although he made some astronomical\nobservations, he was immersed in church politics, and after his\nelderly uncle became ill in 1507, Copernicus was his attending\nphysician. Rosen (1971, 334\u201335) reasonably conjectured that the\nbishop may have hoped that his nephew would be his successor, but\nCopernicus left his uncle because his duties in Lidzbark-Warminski\ninterfered with his continuing pursuit of his studies in astronomy. He\ntook up residence in his chapter of Frombork in 1510 and stayed there\nthe rest of his life.\n\nNot that leaving his uncle and moving to Frombork exempted Copernicus\nfrom continued involvement in administrative and political duties. He\nwas responsible for the administration of various holdings, which\ninvolved heading the provisioning fund, adjudicating disputes,\nattending meetings, and keeping accounts and records. In response to\nthe problem he found with the local currency, he drafted an essay on\ncoinage (MW 176\u2013215) in which he deplored the\ndebasement of the currency and made recommendations for reform. His\nmanuscripts were consulted by the leaders of both Prussia and Poland\nin their attempts to stabilize the currency. He was a leader for West\nPrussia in the war against the Teutonic Knights, which lasted from\n1520\u20131525. He was physician for the bishop (his uncle had died\nin 1512) and members of the chapter, and he was consulting physician\nfor notables in East and West Prussia.\n\nNevertheless, Copernicus began to work on astronomy on his own.\nSometime between 1510 and 1514 he wrote an essay that has come to be\nknown as the Commentariolus (MW 75\u2013126) that\nintroduced his new cosmological idea, the heliocentric universe, and\nhe sent copies to various astronomers. He continued making\nastronomical observations whenever he could, hampered by the poor\nposition for observations in Frombork and his many pressing\nresponsibilities as canon. Nevertheless, he kept working on his\nmanuscript of On the Revolutions. He also wrote what is known\nas Letter against Werner (MW 145\u201365) in 1524,\na critique of Johann Werner\u2019s \u201cLetter concerning the\nMotion of the Eighth Sphere\u201d (De motu octavae sphaerae\ntractatus primus). Copernicus claimed that Werner erred in his\ncalculation of time and his belief that before Ptolemy the movement of\nthe fixed stars was uniform, but Copernicus\u2019s letter did not\nrefer to his cosmological ideas.\n\nIn 1539 a young mathematician named Georg Joachim Rheticus\n(1514\u20131574) from the University of Wittenberg came to study with\nCopernicus. Rheticus brought Copernicus books in mathematics, in part\nto show Copernicus the quality of printing that was available in the\nGerman-speaking cities. He published an introduction to\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas, the Narratio prima (First Report).\nMost importantly, he convinced Copernicus to publish On the\nRevolutions. Rheticus oversaw most of the printing of the book,\nand on 24 May 1543 Copernicus held a copy of the finished work on his\ndeathbed.\n",
