    "main_text": "Aesthetic Value\n6. Social Ethics\n\nConsistently with his contextualism, Dewey stressed the social\ncircumstances in which different moral theories arose. His and James\nTufts\u2019s Ethics begins, not with a review of rival moral\ntheories, but with a survey of anthropology and a brief history of the\nmoral problems and practices of the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and\nRomans. By locating moral theories in their social contexts, Dewey\nexposed their limitations. Theories that make sense in certain\ncontexts may not make sense in others. For example, Dewey argued that\nthe failure of ancient Greek teleological theories to grasp the\nindependence of the right from the good arose from the fact that the\ngood for individual citizens of Greek city-states was inextricably\nwrapped up with participation in civic life and promotion of the good\nof the city-state as a whole (TIF 283).\n\nDewey, like Hegel, stressed the ways abstract philosophical doctrines\nare socially embodied. He frequently focused on the ways these\ndoctrines rationalize and reinforce stultifying and unjust social\narrangements. For example, the sharp dichotomy between purely\ninstrumental and intrinsic goods both reflects and reinforces an\norganization of work life that reduces it to drudgery. Since work is\nof merely instrumental value, so the thinking goes, there is no point\nin trying to make it interesting to those who do it. The dichotomy\nalso rationalizes oppressive class divisions. Insofar as the good life\nis conceived in terms of devotion to or enjoyment of purely intrinsic,\nnoninstrumental goods (such as intellectual contemplation and the\nappreciation of beauty), it is a life that can be led only by a\nleisured class, whose members do not have to spend their time earning\na living. This class depends upon a working class whose function is to\nprovide them with the leisure they need to pursue the good life.\nDewey\u2019s critique of traditional ways of distinguishing means\nfrom ends is thus simultaneously a critique of class hierarchy (HNC\n185\u20138, TV 235).\n\nDewey argued that the primary problems for ethics in the modern world\nconcerned the ways society ought to be organized, rather than personal\ndecisions of the individual (E 314\u2013316). Thus, in contrast with\nhis voluminous political commentaries, Dewey published very little on\npersonal \u201capplied ethics.\u201d The rapid social changes that\nwere taking place in his lifetime required new institutions, as\ntraditional customs and laws proved themselves unable to cope with\nsuch issues as mass immigration, class conflict, the Great Depression,\nthe demands of women for greater independence, racism, and the threats\nto democracy posed by fascism and communism. Dewey was a founding\nmember of the NAACP and the ACLU. As a progressive liberal, he\nadvocated numerous social reforms such as promoting the education,\nemployment, and enfranchisement of women, social insurance, the\nprogressive income tax, and laws protecting the rights of workers to\norganize labor unions. However, he stressed the importance of\nimproving methods of moral inquiry over advocating particular moral\nconclusions, given that the latter are always subject to revision in\nlight of new evidence.\n\nThus, the main focus of Dewey\u2019s social ethics concerns the\ninstitutional arrangements that influence the capacity of people to\nconduct moral inquiry intelligently. Two social domains are critical\nfor promoting this capacity: schools, and civil society. Both needed\nto be reconstructed so as to promote experimental intelligence and\nwider sympathies. Dewey wrote numerous works on education, and\nestablished the famous Laboratory School at the University of Chicago\nto implement and test his educational theories. He was also a leading\nadvocate of the comprehensive high school, as opposed to separate\nvocational and college preparatory schools. This was to promote the\nsocial integration of different economic classes, a prerequisite to\nenlarging their mutual understanding and sympathies. Civil society,\ntoo, needed to be reconstructed along more democratic lines. This\ninvolved not just expanding the franchise, but improving the means of\ncommunication among citizens and between citizens and experts, so that\npublic opinion could be better informed by the experiences and\nproblems of citizens from different walks of life, and by scientific\ndiscoveries (PP). Dewey regarded democracy as the social embodiment of\nexperimental intelligence informed by sympathy and respect for the\nother members of society (DE 3, 89\u201394). Democracy is not simply\na set of legal institutions but a way of life informed by an ethos of\nopen and respectful communication, in which political rivals repudiate\nabusive and suspicious modes of discourse and open themselves up to\nlearning from others (CD). Unlike dictatorial and oligarchic\nsocieties, democratic ones institutionalize feedback mechanisms (free\nspeech) for informing officeholders of the consequences for all of the\npolicies they adopt, and for sanctioning them (periodic elections) if\nthey do not respond accordingly.\n\nDewey\u2019s moral epistemology thus leads naturally to his political\nphilosophy. The reconstruction of moral theory is accomplished by\nreplacing fixed moral rules and ends with an experimental method that\ntreats norms for valuing as hypotheses to be tested in practice, in\nlight of their widest consequences for everyone. To implement this\nmethod requires institutions that facilitate three things: (1) habits\nof critical, experimental inquiry; (2) widespread communication of the\nconsequences of instituting norms, and (3) extensive sympathy, so that\nthe consequences of norms for everyone are treated seriously in\nappraising them and imagining and adopting alternatives. The main\ninstitutions needed to facilitate these things are progressive schools\nand a democratic civil society. Experimentalism in ethics leads to a\ndemocratic political philosophy.\n",
