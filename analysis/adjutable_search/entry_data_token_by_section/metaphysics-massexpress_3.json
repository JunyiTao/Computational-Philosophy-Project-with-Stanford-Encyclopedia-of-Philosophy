    "main_text": "Introduction || Some Terminology\n1.4 Some Terminology\n\nMereologies are formal systems, but we will be ignoring technicalities\nin this entry as far as possible (for details, see the entry\n Mereology).\n Still, some terminology is necessary and useful, since we will be\ndiscussing theories which employ mereological notions. Let us take the\nnotion of part as primitive. A \u2018simple\u2019 is a\nnon-composite entity, i.e., something with no\n parts.[14]\n\nA composite thing has more than one part. The verb\nfuse refers to an asymmetric relation between a whole and its\nparts. If two things fuse they \u2018join together\u2019 to make up\na whole. For example, if the water in my glass and the water in your\nglass fuse, then there exists a thing, a fusion, which is\nmade up of the two portions (sometimes it is said that the two\nportions \u2018have a fusion\u2019). No literal contact or fusion\n(e.g., welding two rods together) is implied by this usage. If a fleet\nis a single thing, then it is arguably a fusion of the boats making it\nup. The nouns whole and sum are synonymous with\nfusion and composite. Overlap occurs when\ndistinct things share one or more parts.\n\nIt is also necessary to make the following distinctions, which are not\nstandard to the literature, but are useful for our purposes. Any\nconcrete +MASS or +COUNT kind noun\nK (e.g., \u2018gold\u2019, \u2018lobster,\u2019) will\nfall into one or more of the following categories:\n\nK is an atomic kind iff if something is some\nK, then it is a K-atom, or it is identical with a\nfusion of K-atoms. And, something is a K-atom iff it\nhas no parts which are K.\nK is a non-atomic kind iff any K has\n(proper) parts which are K.\nK is a fuzzy atomless kind iff any K\nhas parts of which it is indeterminate whether they are K\n(i.e., there is no fact of the matter as to what counts as a smallest\nunit of K).\nK is a heterogeneous kind iff any K has\nsome parts which are\nK1\u2026Kn, where\n\u2018K\u2019,\n\u2018K1\u2019\u2026Kn\u2019\nall refer to distinct kinds.\n\n\nElectrons are atomic, since they have no parts which are electrons.\nAlso, if ships have no parts which are ships, then \u2018ship\u2019\nis an atomic kind term as well (Zimmerman 1995, p.\u200975; Sider\n2001). Portions of non-atomic gunk or infinitely divisible\nmatter of a kind K are K through-and-through, as\nwould an infinitely descending chain of \u2018box-particles\u2019,\neach of which contains a box-particle (Gardner 1983, p.\u200926).\nFruit cake is arguably a fuzzy atomless substance, since it can have\nparts (e.g., half a blueberry with some gluten attached) that are not\ndeterminately fruit cake. (cf. Landman 2011 on \u2018mess mass\nnouns\u2019). Some mass terms, e.g., \u2018cutlery\u2019 and\n\u2018gold\u2019 are heterogeneous. While a fork is some cutlery, a\ntine is not, and, presumably, an electron in a gold atom is not gold.\nNot all the categories are mutually exclusive, and the list is not\nintended to be exhaustive for all kind-terms.\n",
