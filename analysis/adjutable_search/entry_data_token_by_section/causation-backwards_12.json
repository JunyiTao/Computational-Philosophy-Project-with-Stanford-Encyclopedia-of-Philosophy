    "main_text": "Physics || Tachyons\n4.2 Tachyons\n\nWhen the discussion of tachyons began to appear in physics in the\n1960s, it was soon noticed that such particles according to some\nframes of reference were associated with negative energies going\nbackwards in time. To understand how, consider the trajectory of the\nsame tachyon in relation of three different reference frames, \\(S,\nS^*\\), and \\(S^{**}\\) in the Minkowski-space. Now assume that \\(A\\)\nis, in relation to \\(S\\), the emission of a tachyon at \\(t_{1}\\) and\n\\(B\\) is the absorption of the tachyon at \\(t_{2}\\). According to an\nobserver in \\(S, A\\) will be earlier than \\(B\\) and the tachyon will\ncarry positive energy forward in time. Nevertheless it is always\npossible to select a reference frame \\(S^*\\) in relation to which an\nobserver will see \\(A\\) happen simultaneously with \\(B\\) and yet\nanother reference frame \\(S^{**}\\) in relation to which an observer\nsees \\(A\\) happens at \\(t_{2}^{**}\\) whereas \\(B\\) happens at\n\\(t_{1}^{**}\\). According to the observer in \\(S^{*}\\), \\(A\\) will\ntake place later than \\(B\\) and the tachyon carries negative energy\nbackwards in time (See Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Spacetime diagram of\ntachyon\n\n\nIn Figure 1 the planes represent the hypersurfaces of simultaneity. In\nrelation to frame \\(S\\) the tachyon source is at rest, and a tachyon\nis emitted at event \\(A\\), with a superluminal but finite velocity.\nThe absorption of the tachyon, event \\(B\\), will accordingly occur\nlater than \\(A\\) in relation to the observer in \\(S\\), and the arrow\nof trajectory is for that reason pointing into the future above the\nhypersurface passing through \\(A\\) and standing perpendicular to the\nworld-line of the source. But neither with respect to the frame\n\\(S^*\\) nor \\(S^{**}\\) is the tachyon source at rest and the\nhypersurfaces are therefore tilted in relation to the arrow of\ntrajectory. An observer in \\(S^*\\) observes the tachyon to have\ninfinite speed, and therefore the hypersurface is tilted so much that\nit coincides with the arrow. The observer in \\(S^{**}\\) is moving so\nfast with respect to the tachyon source that the hypersurface becomes\ntitled so much that the arrow points into the past below the\nhypersurface.\n\nE. Recami (1978) tried to avoid the idea that tachyons could move\nbackwards in time by introducing the so-called reinterpretation\nprinciple according to which all negative energy tachyons should be\ninterpreted as if they have positive energy and move forward in time.\nThis would mean that the causal order of tachyons should not be\nregarded objective since both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) sometimes denoted the\nemission and sometimes the absorption depending on the frame of\nreference. There are, however, good reasons to believe that this\nsuggestion does not solve the problems it was intended to (Faye\n1981/1989).\n",
