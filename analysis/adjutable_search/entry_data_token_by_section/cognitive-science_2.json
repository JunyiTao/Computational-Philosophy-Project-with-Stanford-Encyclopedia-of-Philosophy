    "main_text": "Representation and Computation\n3. Representation and Computation\n\nThe central hypothesis of cognitive science is that thinking can best\nbe understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and\ncomputational procedures that operate on those structures. While there\nis much disagreement about the nature of the representations and\ncomputations that constitute thinking, the central hypothesis is\ngeneral enough to encompass the current range of thinking in cognitive\nscience, including\n connectionist\n theories which model thinking using artificial neural networks.\n\nMost work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has\n mental representations\n analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures\nsimilar to computational algorithms. Cognitive theorists have proposed\nthat the mind contains such mental representations as logical\npropositions, rules, concepts, images, and analogies, and that it uses\nmental procedures such as deduction, search, matching, rotating, and\nretrieval. The dominant mind-computer analogy in cognitive science has\ntaken on a novel twist from the use of another analog, the brain.\n\nConnectionists have proposed novel ideas about representation and\ncomputation that use neurons and their connections as inspirations for\ndata structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as\ninspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a\ncomplex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind,\nbrain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the\nothers. There is no single computational model of mind, since\ndifferent kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest\ndifferent ways in which the mind might work. The computers that most\nof us work with today are serial processors, performing one\ninstruction at a time, but the brain and some recently developed\ncomputers are parallel processors, capable of doing many operations at\nonce.\n\nA major trend in current cognitive science is the integration of\nneuroscience with many areas of psychology, including cognitive,\nsocial, developmental, and clinical. This integration is partly\nexperimental, resulting from an explosion of new instruments for\nstudying the brain, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging,\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation, and optogenetics. The integration\nis also theoretical, because of advances in understanding how large\npopulations of neurons can perform tasks usually explained with\ncognitive theories of rules and concepts.\n",
