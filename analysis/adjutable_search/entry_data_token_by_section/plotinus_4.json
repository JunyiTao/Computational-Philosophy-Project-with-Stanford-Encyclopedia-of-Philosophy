    "main_text": "Principal Opponents\n5. Principal Opponents\n\nPlotinus regarded himself as a loyal Platonist, an accurate exegete of\nthe Platonic revelation. By the middle of the 3rd century CE, the\nphilosophical world was populated with a diverse array of\nanti-Platonists. In the Enneads, we find Plotinus engaged\nwith many of these opponents of Platonism. In his creative response to\nthese we find many of his original ideas.\n\nAlthough Plotinus was glad to mine Aristotle\u2019s works for distinctions\nand arguments that he viewed as helpful for explicating the Platonic\nposition, there were a number of issues on which Plotinus thought that\nAristotle was simply and importantly mistaken. Perhaps the major issue\nconcerned the nature of a first principle of all. Plotinus recognized\nthat Aristotle agreed with Plato that (1) there must be a first\nprinciple of all; (2) that it must be unique; and (3) that it must be\nabsolutely simple. But Aristotle erred in identifying that first\nprinciple with the Unmoved Mover, fully actual self-reflexive\nintellection. Plotinus did not disagree that there must be an eternal\nprinciple like the Unmoved Mover; this is what the hypostasis\nIntellect is. But he denied that the first principle of all could be\nan intellect or intellection of any sort, since intellection requires\na real distinction between the thinking and the object of thinking,\neven if that object is the thinker itself. A real distinction indicates some sort of complexity or compositeness in the thing (a real minor distinction) or among things (a real major distinction); by contrast, in a conceptual distinction, one thing is considered from different perspectives or aspects. In the absolutely simple first principle of all, there can be no distinct elements or parts at all. In fact, the first\nprinciple of all, the Good or the One, must be beyond thinking if it\nis to be absolutely simple. The misguided consequence of holding this\nview, according to Plotinus, is that Aristotle then misconceives being\nsuch that he identifies it with substance or ousia. But for the first\nprinciple of all actually to be such a principle, it must be unlimited\nin the way that ousia is not. As a result, Aristotle makes many\nmistakes, especially in metaphysics or ontology.\n\nThe second group of major opponents of Platonism were the Stoics. The\nEnneads are filled with anti-Stoic polemics. These polemics\nfocus principally on Stoic materialism, which Plotinus finds to be\nincapable of articulating an ontology which includes everything in the\nuniverse. More important, Stoic materialism is unable to provide\nexplanatory adequacy even in the realm in which the Stoics felt most\nconfident, namely, the physical universe. For example, the Stoics,\nowing to their materialism, could not explain consciousness or\nintentionality, neither of which are plausibly accounted for in\nmaterialistic terms. According to Plotinus, the Stoics were also\nunable to give a justification for their ethical position \u2013 not\nin itself too far distant from Plato\u2019s \u2013 since their\nexhortations to the rational life could not coherently explain how one\nbody (the empirical self) was supposed to identify with another body\n(the ideal rational agent).\n With regard to Plotinus\u2019 contemporaries, he was sufficiently\nexercised by the self-proclaimed Gnostics to write a separate\ntreatise, II 9, attacking their views. These Gnostics, mostly heretic\nChristians, whose voluminous and obscure writings, were only partially\nunearthed at Nag Hammadi in 1945 and translated in the last two\ndecades, were sufficiently close to Platonism, but, in Plotinus\u2019\nview, so profoundly perverse in their interpretation of it, that they\nmerited special attention. The central mistake of Gnosticism,\naccording to Plotinus, is in thinking that Soul is\n\u2018fallen\u2019 and is the source of cosmic evil. As we have\nseen, Plotinus, although he believes that matter is evil, vociferously\ndenies that the physical world is evil. It is only the matter that\nunderlies the images of the eternal world that is isolated from all\nintelligible reality. The Gnostics ignore the structure of Platonic\nmetaphysics and, as a result, wrongly despise this world. For\nPlotinus, a hallmark of ignorance of metaphysics is arrogance, the\narrogance of believing that the elite or chosen possess special\nknowledge of the world and of human destiny. The idea of a secret\nelect, alone destined for salvation \u2013 which was what the\nGnostics declared themselves to be \u2013 was deeply at odds with\nPlotinus\u2019 rational universalism.\n",
