    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nMax Horkheimer was born into a conservative Jewish family on February\n14, 1895, the only son of Moritz and Babette Horkheimer. A successful\nand respected businessman who owned several textile factories in the\nZuffenhausen district of Stuttgart (where Max was born), Moritz\nHorkheimer expected his son to follow in his footsteps. Thus Max was\ntaken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he\neventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin\ntwo relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he\nmet Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic\ncolleague, and who would remain Max\u2019s closest friend. He also\nmet Rose Riekher, who was his father\u2019s personal secretary. Eight\nyears Max\u2019s senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower\nclass, Riekher (whom Max called \u201cMaidon\u201d) was not\nconsidered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max\nand Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in\n1969 (Wiggershaus 1994, p. 41\u201344).\n\nIn the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer\nbegan studies at the University of Munich, and transferred to the\nUniversity of Frankfurt a semester later. At Frankfurt he studied\npsychology and philosophy, the latter with the neo-Kantian philosopher\nHans Cornelius. He also spent a year, on Cornelius\u2019s\nrecommendation, studying in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl. After an\nabortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology,\nHorkheimer, with Cornelius\u2019s direction, completed his doctorate\nin philosophy with a dissertation titled The Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment. Upon completion of the degree he was\noffered an assistantship under Cornelius, and thus definitively set\noff on an academic career rather than continuing in his father\u2019s\nbusiness. In 1925 Horkheimer completed his Habilitation with a work\ntitled Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment as a Link between\nTheoretical and Practical Philosophy, and took a position as\nPrivatdozent, or lecturer, at Frankfurt. During this time he\nwould lecture extensively on 18th and 19th Century philosophy, with\nhis research interests moving more in line with Marxian themes\n(Wiggershaus 1994, p. 44\u201347).\n\nThe most important moments of Horkheimer\u2019s early academic career\nwould come in 1930. In July he was appointed Professor of Social\nPhilosophy at Frankfurt, and in October made the director of the\nInstitut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung (Institute of Social\nResearch). The Institute began as a Marxist study group started by\nFelix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who\nused his inheritance to fund an institution that would support his\nleftist academic aims. Along with Pollock (who also completed a\ndoctorate in Frankfurt, writing on Marx), Horkheimer became acquainted\nwith Weil, and took part in the activities of the Institute from the\nbeginning. The Institute formally opened in 1924 under the direction\nof the Austrian Marxist scholar Carl Gr\u00fcnberg, who became ill\nquickly after taking the post. While Pollock was more closely\nassociated with the Institute during the Gr\u00fcnberg period, he\nsupported his friend for the directorship (on the early history of the\nInstitute, see Jay 1996, ch. 1). On January 24, 1931, Horkheimer\ndelivered his inaugural lecture for the chair of social philosophy and\ndirectorship of the Institute, titled \u201cThe Present Situation of\nSocial Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social\nResearch.\u201d This lecture, and several essays written by\nHorkheimer in the early 1930s, would develop a conception of\ninterdisciplinary social research that was meant to guide the\nactivities of the institute during Horkheimer\u2019s tenure as\ndirector.\n\nThis program was obstructed from the very beginning by\nsocial-political unrest. In the time between Horkheimer\u2019s being\nnamed Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in\n1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In\nthe midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis\u2019 rise,\nHorkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of\nmoving the Institute out of Germany. Shortly after Hitler was named\nChancellor in 1933, the Institute in Frankfurt was closed and its\nbuilding seized by the Gestapo. Horkheimer was also relieved of his\nprofessorship and directorship in early 1933, and relocated to Geneva,\nwhere the Institute had opened a satellite office. In 1934 Horkheimer\nmoved to New York, where one of Pollock\u2019s assistants had been\nnegotiating an agreement for the Institute with the department of\nsociology at Columbia University. In July of 1934 Horkheimer accepted\nan offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their\nbuildings. Having received American citizenship in 1940, Horkheimer\nwould continue to live and work largely in New York until 1941, when\nhe moved to the Los Angeles area (for a thorough history of the\ndevelopment of Horkheimer\u2019s thought up to this point, see\nAbromeit 2011). With the Institute splintering between New York and\nCalifornia, Horkheimer concentrated his energies on his own work,\nincluding the collaborative efforts with Theodor Adorno that produced\nDialectic of Enlightenment.\n\nWith the end of WWII, Horkheimer gradually considered moving back to\nGermany. In April 1948, he returned to Europe for the first time, to\nlecture in various cities, including as a visiting professor in\nFrankfurt. His full return to Germany would follow shortly, and in\nJuly 1949 he was restored to his professorship at the University of\nFrankfurt. The following year the Institute would return as well.\nAfter returning, Horkheimer would focus on administrative work,\nreestablishing the Institute and serving two terms as University\nRector in the early 1950s. In 1953 he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of\nthe City of Frankfurt, and would later be named honorary citizen of\nFrankfurt for life. His academic activities also continued throughout\nthe 1950s, and included a period during which he served as a regular\nvisiting professor at the University of Chicago. His work would slow,\nhowever, once he retired in 1958 to the Swiss town of Montagnola. Max\nHorkheimer passed away on July 7, 1973, at the age of 78.\n2. Materialism and The Early Program of the Institute of Social Research\n\nThe theoretical viewpoint that oriented the work of the Institute of\nSocial Research, most famously known as \u201ccritical theory,\u201d\nwas largely developed by Horkheimer in various writings in the 1930s\n(most of which were published in the Institute\u2019s journal, the\nZeitschrift f\u00fcr\n Sozialforschung).[1]\n In the earliest works Horkheimer used the term\n\u201cmaterialism,\u201d rather than critical theory, to name his\nphilosophical viewpoint. Though his early texts do not directly\nmention Marx as much as one might expect (perhaps for reasons of\npolitical expediency), it is clear that this theory draws great\ninspiration from Marxian thought (see Borman 2017 for further\ndiscussion of Horkheimer\u2019s early materialism and its connection\nto Marx). Horkheimer\u2019s materialism is not systematically\npresented in those early essays; rather the epistemological,\nmethodological, and moral concepts that were to orient the work of the\nInstitute are developed through a variety of texts. What follows is an\nattempt at a reconstruction of Horkheimer\u2019s program for the\nInstitute, which draws on elements from various essays of the early\n1930s.\n\nOne can begin to piece together Horkheimer\u2019s materialist method\nby examining the 1931 inaugural address. There he presents most of the\nmain themes of his early philosophy in the context of describing what\nthe Institute was to accomplish under his leadership. As he notes at\nthe beginning, social philosophy must interpret the various phenomena\nassociated with human social life. But along with this fairly obvious\npoint, he asserts that \u201csocial philosophy is confronted with the\nyearning for a new interpretation of a life trapped in its individual\nstriving for happiness\u201d (p. 7). This introduces perhaps the most\nfundamental element of Horkheimer\u2019s view. Social philosophy must\nconnect with the practical aim of alleviating suffering. But it is,\nafter all, still a theoretical enterprise, and he would emphasize that\nthe work of the Institute would amount to \u201ca reformulation...of\nthe old question concerning the connection of particular existence and\nuniversal Reason\u201d (pp. 11\u201312). Along with the emphasis on\nsuffering, the proper interpretation of reason would play a crucial\nrole in Horkheimer\u2019s thought.\n\nEarly in the inaugural address he lays out a quick, and critical,\nhistory of modern German social philosophy that fixes on Hegel.\nHegelian social philosophy is criticized for\n\u201ctransfiguring\u201d oppression; individual human experience,\nwith all its suffering, is given sense insofar as it is fit within a\nrational, overarching conception of the movement of the \u201ceternal\nlife of Spirit\u201d (pp. 4\u20135). Horkheimer rejects this kind of\nmetaphysical view because it seeks to cover over the reality of human\nsuffering. But he is not unreservedly critical of metaphysics. After\ncriticizing Hegelian social philosophy, he notes that in reaction\ncertain strands of social research eschewed philosophy entirely. This\nleads to Horkheimer\u2019s criticism of the excessive specialization\nof the (in this case social) sciences. Due to this specialization,\nscientific researchers omit any broader examination of the social\nroots, and social meaning, from their inquiry. At least metaphysical\nthinking recognizes the need to present a comprehensive view that can\nmake sense of the social whole. The twin critiques of metaphysics and\nscience provide a space for Horkheimer to present his own view. The\naim of materialist social research is to combine specific empirical\nstudies with more comprehensive theorizing, and thus overcome these\nproblems. Horkheimer finishes by noting that this research will be\naimed at the elucidation of the links between economic structure,\npsychology, and culture, such that the work of various social\nscientists and theorists can be brought together to forge an\nempirically informed picture of society that might replace such\nprevious metaphysical categories as Universal Reason or Spirit.\n\nThus construed, we can use the themes presented in the inaugural\naddress as a guide for the further examination of Horkheimer\u2019s\nearly thought. Four elements become key: the emphasis on suffering and\nhappiness, the role rationality plays in emancipatory movements, the\ncombined critiques of metaphysics and positivism, and the methodology\nof interdisciplinary social research. Each of these four is examined\nin more depth in the four subsections below.\n2.1. Suffering and the Desire for Happiness\n\nAs noted, the rejection of Hegelian social philosophy in the inaugural\nlecture is tied to a broader rejection of metaphysics, which will be\ndiscussed in more detail in \u00a72.2. At the root of the rejection of\n\u201ctransfiguration,\u201d however, is a very basic point. No\nsocial philosophy that denies the singular import of suffering, and\nthe corresponding desire to overcome that suffering, can properly\ngrasp human social reality. Thus, in the 1933 essay \u201cMaterialism\nand Metaphysics\u201d Horkheimer writes that \u201cman\u2019s\nstriving for happiness is to be recognized as a natural fact requiring\nno justification\u201d (p. 44). Prior to any critique of metaphysics,\nmaterialism rests on the basic recognition of suffering and the desire\nfor happiness. Suffering and happiness are in some sense\n\u201cproperly basic\u201d; their significance is evident, in no\nneed of justification, and foundational to materialist social\ntheory.\n\nThe talk of both \u201csuffering\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d\nsuggests that Horkheimer oscillated between pessimistic and optimistic\nrenderings of this foundational idea. The pessimistic side of this\nview, with its conception of human life as shared suffering, was\npresent in Horkheimer\u2019s thought from very early in his life. In\nthe novellas and diary entries written from 1914\u20131918 and later\npublished as Aus der Pubert\u00e4t (From Puberty),\nthis pessimism is prominent (see Schmidt 1993, 25\u201326). This is\nin part due to the early influence of Schopenhauer\u2019s\n\u201cmetaphysical pessimism\u201d on Horkheimer\u2019s thought,\nand Horkheimer himself would emphasize that Schopenhauer was his first\nphilosophical role model (Horkheimer 1968, p. ix). It is noteworthy\n(especially given the link here to Horkheimer\u2019s critique of\nmetaphysics), that for Schopenhauer this \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nview is tied to the concrete need to interpret the world in a way that\ncan help humans understand and deal with their suffering (on this\npoint, and Horkheimer\u2019s relation to Schopenhauer\u2019s thought\nin general, see Schmidt 1993). Metaphysical or not, this view is based\non the notion that life is marked by pain. The optimistic rendering\ncomes to the fore in the above quote from \u201cMaterialism and\nMetaphysics\u201d insofar as the desire for happiness is emphasized.\nBut the optimism should not be overestimated, because happiness is\nconstrued in a solely negative manner. The oppressed are motivated not\nby some positive conception of happiness, but by the hope of freedom\nfrom suffering. This individual desire for happiness can further\nmanifest itself as the moral sentiment of compassion, wherein we\ndesire the happiness of others (Horkheimer 1933b, pp.\n 34\u201335).[2]\n The desire to overcome one\u2019s own suffering, combined with the\nfeeling of compassion, should help motivate the oppressed to join\ntogether to work for positive social change. But even this optimistic\nnote is tinged with a pessimistic note, as \u201cthe aim of a future\nhappy life for all\u201d arises only \u201cout of the privation of\nthe present\u201d (Horkheimer 1933b p. 34); it is the existence of\ncurrent shared suffering that could lead to revolutionary social\nchange.\n\nAlong with Schopenhauer, Horkheimer\u2019s thoughts on suffering owe\na great deal to Freud. The notion that human beings have an inner\ndrive to overcome suffering is taken from Freud\u2019s early libido\ntheory (see Held 1980, pp. 43\u201344 and 197\u2013198).\nHorkheimer\u2019s most direct analysis of Freud in the 1930s is found\nin \u201cEgoism and Freedom Movements\u201d (especially pp.\n103\u2013106), and the Freudian conception of inner drives will\nfurther mark Horkheimer\u2019s later work, as will be shown in\n\u00a74.2 below. In the 1930s Horkheimer was also influenced by Erich\nFromm, who was a member of the Institute at the time; for example,\nshortly after the claim in \u201cMaterialism and Metaphysics\u201d\nthat the desire for happiness is a natural fact, Fromm\u2019s work is\nreferenced. It is noteworthy in this regard that Fromm\u2019s work\nfrom this period aimed to broadly draw together Freudian and Marxian\nviews. This connection can be seen in the link between the desire for\nhappiness and emancipation, as discussed in the next section.\n2.2 Reason and Emancipation\n\nWhen focusing on the affective nature of suffering, happiness, and\ncompassion in Horkheimer\u2019s view, one might get the sense that he\nis relying on a sort of emotivism that shuns reason. But there is a\nstrongly rationalistic strand present in Horkheimer\u2019s early work\nthat is tied directly to his views on positive social change. In fact,\nhe describes suffering as resulting from a lack of rational social\norganization, and proposes that any attempt to improve society must\ninvolve making it in some way more rational. This view is in turn tied\nto the broadly Marxian element in Horkheimer\u2019s early work, as\ncapitalism is criticized for creating the irrational social conditions\nthat lead to suffering.\n\nTo a large extent, this problem of irrationality is described as a\nsocial coordination problem. Insofar as it is individual human beings\nwho suffer, and who desire happiness, individual welfare is a crucial\nmatter. This is made clear by the critique of Hegelian\n\u201ctransfiguration,\u201d which is problematic partly because it\nsubsumes individual suffering and happiness within the absolute. At\nthe same time, individual welfare is still dependent upon a broader\nsocial basis, so the life of society as a whole is pertinent to the\nsearch for happiness. But capitalism has created a situation wherein\npeople are made to focus on their own individual welfare, without\nconsidering anything other than \u201cthe conservation and\nmultiplication of their own property\u201d (1933b, p. 19). Social\nneeds are thus handled through various disorganized activities focused\non individual needs, which in turn inadequately deals with the social\nbasis of individual welfare, thus detracting from individual welfare.\nThis kind of critique is found in some form in many of\nHorkheimer\u2019s early essays (see, for example, 1934c, pp.\n247\u2013250 and 1935b, pp. 162\u2013170).\n\nSuch an argument is made particularly clearly in \u201cMaterialism\nand Morality,\u201d where Horkheimer discusses idealist, and\npredominantly Kantian, conceptions of morality. One main thread of the\nrather intricate argument made there is that there is a tension in\nKant\u2019s view, insofar as he places a radical emphasis on the\nindividual will, but also makes that will beholden to the universal\nlaw described in terms of the kingdom of ends. This tension supposedly\ncomes from the bourgeois socio-economic context in which Kant\nlived:\n\nThe categorical imperative holds up a \u201cuniversal natural\nlaw,\u201d the law of human society, as a standard of comparison to\nthis [bourgeois] natural law of individuals. This would be meaningless\nif particular interests and the needs of the general public\nintersected not just haphazardly but of necessity. That this does not\noccur, however, is the inadequacy of the bourgeois economic form:\nthere exists no rational connection between the free competition of\nindividuals as what mediates and the existence of the entire society\nas what is mediated...This irrationality expresses itself in the\nsuffering of the majority of human beings...This problem, which only\nsociety itself could rationally solve through the systematic\nincorporation of each member into a consciously directed labor\nprocess, manifests itself in the bourgeois epoch as a conflict in the\ninner life of its subjects. (pp. 19\u201320)\n\n\nThis passage makes it clear that the coordination problems associated\nwith the \u201cbourgeois epoch\u201d (i.e. the capitalist period)\nare problems of irrationality. Furthermore, it makes clear that the\nsolution to these problems is to be found in the formation of a more\nrational social order, which is described in terms of a socialist\nplanned economy. This point, then, provides the space where Horkheimer\ncan link his own materialist theory, and the work of the Institute, to\nthe broadly Marxian aim of emancipation through overcoming the\ncapitalist order. Because \u201cthe wretchedness of our own time is\nconnected with the structure of society\u201d (1933b, 24) a social\ntheory that could make that structure\u2019s irrationality explicit\ncould help overcome that wretchedness. Furthermore, that irrationality\nneeds to be made explicit to the classes who suffer the most from it,\nso they can take proper action. So Horkheimer\u2019s view connects\ngenerally to the Marxian view of the proletariat as a critical force\nin history, but unlike (on certain interpretations, at least) Marx, he\ndoes not see history as necessarily moving the proletariat to\n\u201ccritical consciousness\u201d because of the irrationality\ninherent in capitalist socio-economic arrangements. Rather, various\nsocial and economic forces keep the proletariat from recognizing its\npotential; for example there is a split between the unemployed, who\nsuffer most from capitalism but are disorganized, and the workers who\ncan be organized, but fear losing their jobs (Horkheimer 1934a,\n61\u201365). The proletariat requires the help of the theorist. That\ntheorist must engage in a special kind of activity, however, which (as\nthe next section will show) must steer clear of two opposing\nerrors.\n2.3 Critiques of Metaphysics and Science\n\nOne can get a sense of what Horkheimer means when criticizing\nmetaphysics by looking at \u201cMaterialism and Metaphysics.\u201d\nThere metaphysics is described in relation to Wilhelm Dilthey\u2019s\ndoctrine of \u201cworld views.\u201d For Dilthey, human beings\nengage in metaphysics in an attempt to explain the enigmatic elements\nof human life. In this attempt, certain characteristics of experience\nare emphasized and developed into coherent world views that have\nputatively universal validity, and describe the significance of the\nworld and human life (pp. 10\u201317). So \u201cmetaphysics,\u201d\nin this sense, amounts to a kind of intellectualized, theoretically\nelaborated attempt at turning partial, finite experiences into a\ncomprehensive view of nature and human experience.\n\nFor Horkheimer, theories of this type are in part problematic because\n\u201cknowledge of the infinite must itself be infinite\u201d\n(Horkheimer 1933a, p. 27). But human beings are only capable of finite\nknowledge, and can only pay attention to changing historical\nconditions. If insights into the absolute are impossible, there is no\nknown ultimate order of things that grounds all other forms of\nknowledge. Along these lines Horkheimer criticized Max Scheler\u2019s\nmetaphysical anthropology for holding that all human works and\nachievements could be described in terms of some basic structure of\nhuman nature (Horkheimer 1935b, p. 153). Rather than pursuing an\ninterest in understanding human existence, Horkheimer argues,\nmetaphysics obscures the proper understanding of human life. Many of\nHorkheimer\u2019s early essays aim to show how the works of various\nphilosophers, past and present, are troubled in this way. For example,\nalong with the criticism of Dilthey in \u201cMaterialism and\nMetaphysics\u201d and the criticism of Scheler in \u201cRemarks on\nPhilosophical Anthropology,\u201d there are (among others) critiques\nof this type that attack Kant in \u201cMaterialism and\nMorality,\u201d and Henri Bergson in \u201cOn Bergson\u2019s\nMetaphysics of Time.\u201d\n\nIn each case, however, Horkheimer was not solely critical, and there\nis a positive element that Horkheimer finds in metaphysics that serves\nas a transition to his critique of science. For example, in the 1932\nessay \u201cNotes on Science and the Crisis,\u201d he applauds\n\u201cpostwar metaphysics, especially that of Max Scheler\u201d for\ndeveloping \u201ca method less hindered by conventional narrowness of\noutlook\u201d (p.6). Similarly, in the 1934 essay \u201cThe\nRationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy,\u201d Horkheimer\nagrees with Dilthey and Bergson (and also Nietzsche, all three under\nthe aegis of Lebensphilosophie) insofar as they critique\nscientism and formalistic rationalism. Metaphysics is, in general,\nright to try to engage in some form of synoptic theorizing, although\nit takes it too far. But the opposite extreme, of which Scheler,\nDilthey, and Bergson are critical, fits with Horkheimer\u2019s\nconception of the state of the sciences.\n\nThe critique of the sciences developed in the early texts moves along\ntwo lines. First, the sciences are criticized for being overly\nspecialized. For example, in the inaugural address Horkheimer\ncomplains of \u201cchaotic specialization\u201d (p. 9). The danger\nof focusing on technical minutiae is that researchers become insulated\nfrom one another, and lose the ability to use one another\u2019s\nresources. The result is a lack of unification and overall direction.\nJust as he favors a planned economy, Horkheimer wants the\n\u201csetting of tasks\u201d in scientific research to be brought\nunder rational control, so empirical researchers can work together\ntoward broader ends. Second, as noted in \u201cNotes on Science and\nthe Crisis,\u201d science \u201chas no realistic grasp of that\ncomprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the\ndirection of its work depends, namely, society\u201d (p. 8). All\nhuman work, be it in the sciences or anything else, depends on a\nbroader context which supports it, and the activities that are\nassociated with the social interests prevalent at any given time\naffect the direction of scientific research. There is no \u201cview\nfrom nowhere\u201d from which empirical research begins, but only\nsocially situated standpoints. Horkheimer expands on this point to\nargue that when empirical research misses its social roots, it also\nmisses the effects the \u201cdirection of its work\u201d might have\non society. Science has a responsibility to society that can only be\nfilled if its various research efforts are knit together within a more\ncomprehensive framework that takes society and its improvement as its\nobject.\n\nThis is largely repeated in other works that criticize\n\u201cpositivism.\u201d The fact that the Frankfurt School mounted a\nstrong critique of positivism is quite well known, in part because of\nthe so-called \u201cPositivismusstreit\u201d of the 1960s,\nand Horkheimer also uses the term frequently, especially in his later\nworks. The critiques of science and positivism make the same basic\n points.[3]\n Consider the critique of logical positivism in the 1937 essay\n\u201cThe Latest Attack on Metaphysics.\u201d There Horkheimer\nargues that insofar as logical empiricism \u201cholds only to what\nis, to the guarantee of facts\u201d (pp. 133\u2013134), it tries to\ninsulate the individual sciences from broader interpretation. Thus\npositivism disconnects science from society and robs it of its\nemancipatory possibilities, because brute facts can only grasp the\npresent, and the possibility for changing the status quo in the future\nis lost.\n\nThe crucial point to note is that the critiques of metaphysics and\nscience work together, and are meant to open up a space between the\ntwo where materialist social research should operate. Philosophy\nmaintains metaphysics\u2019 goal of producing a synoptic view of\nhuman life, but it does so in a merely provisional way, which is open\nto empirical research that genuinely follows the contours of history.\nScience, on the other hand, maintains its rigorous empirical methods,\nbut must open itself up to the role it plays in the broader social\nframework. In the inaugural address, Horkheimer thus claims that there\nmust be a \u201ccontinuous, dialectical penetration and development\nof philosophical theory and specialized scientific practice\u201d (p.\n9).\n2.4 The Epistemology and Methodology of Interdisciplinary Research\n\nHorkheimer\u2019s conception of interdisciplinary social research is\nrooted in, broadly construed, both empiricist and realist views.\nHorkheimer speaks often of such research as aiming at\n\u201cfacts,\u201d as seen in \u00a72.1 when he refers to the desire\nfor happiness as a natural fact. This connects to a kind of realism\nseen most directly in the 1935 essay \u201cOn the Problem of\nTruth.\u201d \u201cMaterialism\u201d he tells us, \u201cinsists\nthat objective reality is not identical with man\u2019s\nthought,\u201d and truth is determined by the \u201crelation of the\npropositions to reality\u201d (pp. 189, 194). But this realism has to\nbe qualified; materialism is distinguished from idealism through the\nappeal to an objective reality outside of our thinking, but it is\nfurther separated from metaphysical realism by its recognition that\nour knowing is historically bounded. Along these lines, Horkheimer\nadmits to holding to a correspondence theory of truth, but notes\nthat:\n\n\nThis correspondence is neither a simple datum [nor] an immediate\nfact...Rather, it is always established by real events and human\nactivity. Already in the investigation and determination of facts, and\neven more in the verification of theories, a role is played by the\ndirection of attention, the refinement of methods, the categorical\nstructure of the subject matter\u2014in short, by human activity\ncorresponding to the given social period. (p. 190)\n\n\nHere we find Horkheimer\u2019s epistemological considerations echoing\nhis critique of science. Presumably the \u201creal events and human\nactivity\u201d that grasp objective truth involve empirical research.\nBut because (as discussed in the critique of science) empirical\nresearch is always tied to a social context, one must see that the\ntruths it reveals are conditioned by the \u201chuman activity\ncorresponding to the given social period.\u201d Knowledge is always\naffected by the historical changes in our methods noted. But more than\ntheoretical or methodological changes that shift scientific theories,\nHorkheimer sees knowledge as being marked by our practical interests.\nThis is why a strong metaphysical conception of reality is unavailable\nto us; all thinking is marked by practical and theoretical interests\nthat are partial and subject to historical change.\n\nBut this point cannot be taken too far; truth is neither wholly\ndetermined by our practical interests nor by theory-dependent\nconditions of verification. When it is claimed that truth is dependent\non the \u201crelation of propositions to reality,\u201d Horkheimer\nmeans both of those to be given equal weight. While the weight put on\n\u201cpropositions\u201d (or better, human conceptual activity)\nremoves the possibility of a metaphysical theory of reality, it does\nnot remove reality. But because all inquiry into truth is historically\nand socially mediated, it is constantly open to adjustment. This\npoints out why the \u201ccontinuous, dialectical penetration\u201d\nof philosophy and science spoken of in the inaugural address is\nnecessary. Objective truths have to be grasped empirically, and the\nwork of the specialized sciences is thus necessary to determine the\ntruth of the current state of society. But \u201ctruth is\nadvanced\u201d only when \u201chuman beings who possess it stand by\nit unbendingly, apply it and carry it through, act according to it,\nand bring it to power against the resistance of reactionary, narrow,\none-sided points of view\u201d (Horkheimer 1935a, p. 4). This\nrequires that empirical research be saved from \u201cchaotic\nspecialization,\u201d and interpreted through an adequate theoretical\nframework. It is noteworthy in this regard that toward the end of the\ninaugural lecture, Horkheimer states that it is appropriate for the\nhead of the Institute to also hold a chair in social philosophy, as\nwas not the case with his predecessor who worked in the\n\u201cspecific discipline\u201d of political economy. For\nHorkheimer, it was properly the job of the philosopher to plan out and\nguide the interdisciplinary work of the Institute.\n\nHistorical exigencies kept the Institute\u2019s early researchers\nfrom implementing this program. They did press on with their empirical\nand theoretical efforts during the time of upheaval in the 1930s,\nproducing various small studies in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr\nSozialforschung, and the larger Studies on Authority and the\nFamily. It is clearly the case, however, that there were many\ndifficulties in carrying out the empirical research that was used in\nthose studies (see the historical discussion of this period in\nWiggershaus 1994, 149\u2013156). Even if we set aside the historical\ndifficulties that beset the Institute during this time, there is still\nreason to question whether Horkheimer\u2019s interdisciplinary\nprogram could have been carried out successfully. One might doubt, for\nexample, that the philosophers who formed the core of the Frankfurt\nSchool, including Horkheimer himself, were actually open enough to the\nsciences. Jay 1996 (pp. 130\u2013131), Wiggershaus 1994 (p. 151), and\nWolin 1992 (pp. 56\u201358), argue that they were not, such that\ntheir theoretical works (especially in Studies on Authority and\nthe Family) were not really integrated with the empirical\nstudies. Perhaps more damningly, Bon\u00df 1993 argues that this\nfailure comes from faults internal to Horkheimer\u2019s\nmethodological and epistemological considerations such that \u201cthe\ninterdisciplinary claim amounts to no more than an external formula\nfor integration\u201d (p. 118). This seems fair insofar as Horkheimer\nspent a great deal of energy claiming that empirical and theoretical\nresearch should be combined, and explaining why they should be\ncombined, but did very little to explain how they would be so\ncombined. It remains to be shown if one might reactivate\nHorkheimer\u2019s intentions while providing a better explanation of\nhow such integrated research might actually work. Clearly, however,\nHorkheimer would come to gradually doubt the efficacy of such a\nprogram; one can begin to trace out this shift by examining the 1937\nessay \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d (this separation\nof the 1937 essay from the earlier \u201cmaterialist\u201d works\nroughly follows arguments in Dubiel 1985).\n3. \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d: Summation and Dissolution of the Early Program\n\nTo an extent, Horkheimer\u2019s materialist theory is encapsulated in\nhis most famous and widely-read essay from the 1930s,\n\u201cTraditional and Critical Theory.\u201d The essay is often\nreferred to as being \u201cprogrammatic,\u201d highlighting the\nnotion that it summarizes the philosophical and methodological views\nthat were meant to guide the work of the Institute (see, for example,\nSchmidt 1993, p. 34, and Ingram 1990, p. 108). This is not wrong, but\ncan be misleading if overemphasized. At the same time as it summarizes\nthe earlier work, \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d\nevinces a transition to Horkheimer\u2019s later critiques of reason\nand enlightenment (a similar point is made in Benhabib 1986, pp.\n149\u2013163). The most obvious change occurs in the name Horkheimer\ngives to his favored view, as he shifts from \u201cmaterialism\u201d\nto \u201ccritical theory.\u201d But the changes are more than\ncosmetic. For example, the critique of \u201ctraditional\ntheory\u201d subtly shifts the terms of the critiques of metaphysics\nand positivism. Also, the role of the theorist vis-a-vis society\nchanges. In part, this prefigures later views.\n\nThe titular forms of theorizing correspond (as noted at the beginning\nof the 1937 \u201cPostscript,\u201d p. 244) to those found in\nDescartes\u2019 Discourse on Method and Marx\u2019s\ncritique of political economy, respectively. So the overarching point\nof the essay can be summarized fairly succinctly; it describes a form\nof \u201ctraditional\u201d theory that follows Descartes\u2019\nmethodology, examines the weaknesses of such theory, and then opposes\nto traditional theory a superior Marxian \u201ccritical\u201d\ntheory. The critique of traditional theory largely follows the earlier\ncritique of the sciences and positivism, and in this sense is a\nsummation. Again, the fact that the sciences do not recognize their\npresence in a broader social framework is emphasized. Traditional\ntheory misses the fact that that \u201cbringing hypotheses to bear on\nfacts is an activity that goes on, ultimately, not in the\nsavant\u2019s head but in industry\u201d (p. 196).\n\u201cSavant\u201d is the derisive term Horkheimer uses throughout\nthe text to refer to the traditional theorist, and the savant does not\nrecognize that the economic (and thus currently capitalist) structure\nof society shapes scientific work. The savant further misses the\nsuffering caused by that social structure, and the fact that science\nis complicit in this oppression. Critical theorizing, on the other\nhand, is \u201ca human activity which has society itself for its\nobject\u201d (p. 206); it overcomes the blindness of the savant by\nopenly and purposely examining the way in which theory is immersed in\na particular historical and social setting, and it seeks to critique\nthat social setting for emancipatory effect. This relies on a form of\nimmanent critique, tied to the suffering of the oppressed; the\ntheorist must seize on the meaning of the experience of the oppressed\nand develop it into a coherent critique of existing society. To this\nend Horkheimer notes that if the critical theorist\u2019s\n\u201cpresentation of societal contradictions is not merely an\nexpression of the concrete historical situation but also a force\nwithin it to stimulate change, then [the critical theorist\u2019s]\nreal function emerges\u201d (p. 215).\n\nThis general symmetry with the earlier program belies certain\nimportant changes to the theory, however. The very beginning of the\ntext, which discusses traditional theory, shows a subtle shift from\nthe earlier work. Traditional theory is first linked with the natural\nsciences, for which \u201ctheory\u201d involves a set of logically\nlinked propositions that are consonant with empirical facts. The\nlogical coherence of such a set of propositions is then emphasized,\nand connected to Descartes\u2019 method. Horkheimer goes on to\nsuggest that such a conception of theory has an inherent tendency to\nmove toward \u201ca purely mathematical system of symbols.\u201d\nFormal logic and reasoning thus become a main target of criticism.\nThis is not a radical departure from Horkheimer\u2019s earlier\ncritique of science, since, for example, in \u201cNotes on Science\nand the Crisis,\u201d he objects to the rigid, mechanistic character\nof the scientific method. But the earlier texts focus more on a\nproblem that is external to the sciences. There is no coherent\n\u201csetting of tasks\u201d prior to the engagement in empirical\nresearch, and the results of empirical research are not knit into a\nbroader theory that can have emancipatory intent. The earlier essays\nlargely ask for the sciences to go about their normal business within\nan interdisciplinary setting that would correct these problems. In\n\u201cTraditional and Critical Theory,\u201d on the other hand, the\ncritique strikes more directly at the formalism inherent in the\nsciences\u2019 own methodology, such that the problem is internal to\nthe sciences. This provides one clear transitional point, insofar as\nformalism will be a primary object of critique in Horkheimer\u2019s\nwritings from the 1940s.\n\nAnother interesting shift is that the critique of metaphysics largely\nfalls out of the picture. For some commentators, metaphysics is\nfolded, along with science, into traditional theory (see Brunkhorst\n1993, 74). But this does not seem entirely correct, because in the\nmidst of criticizing positivism, Horkheimer notes that there is,\n\u201clurking\u201d in positivism\u2019s emphasis on facts,\n\u201csomething like a reaction against the alliance of metaphysics\nand oppression\u201d (p. 232). This claim harkens back to the\nnotion, described in places like \u201cMaterialism and\nMetaphysics,\u201d that scientific attention to facts, when properly\nconstrued within materialist research, can keep philosophy from\noverlooking actual human suffering. But such references are few, and\nHorkheimer does shift the discussion of science in such a way that it\ntakes over parts of his earlier critique of metaphysics. For example,\nhe criticizes the sciences, in a manner that is not common in earlier\nessays, for the way they subsume facts under universal concepts (pp.\n224\u2013226). This critique of universal concepts is tied to the\ncritique of formalism; Horkheimer finds fault in the fact that the\nsciences relate facts to concepts in terms of the \u201crelation of\nclasses to instances\u201d which can be \u201caccomplished by a\nsimple deduction\u201d (p.225). Critical theory is then contrasted\nwith this overly simplified universal-particular relation insofar as\nit constantly reexamines the relation of facts to universal concepts,\nand sees them as fitting together in a dynamic relationship that must\nbe carefully charted. The implication is that logical formalism leads\nthe sciences to form static universals into which all particulars can\nbe neatly placed. Since the sciences are attending to facts in\nengaging in such an operation, the critique does not exactly match up\nwith the criticism that metaphysics turns a blind eye to the world.\nBut as those facts are misconstrued through formalism, the upshot of\nthe critique is the same; actual social existence has not been\nadequately incorporated into theory because of the creation of a false\nuniversal. This formalism is contrasted with the fact that critical\ntheory is \u201cthe unfolding of a single existential judgment\u201d\n(p. 227). Displaying the contradictions inherent in capitalist\nsociety, and fixing on possibilities for emancipatory change, does not\ninvolve the scientific subsumption of facts within a logically ordered\nconceptual system. It rather involves unfolding and elaborating on an\ninsight that one initially acquires simply by existing in (with\n\u201cexisting in\u201d taken in the robust sense of living and\nacting in) that society.\n\nThe way this point is construed displays the most crucial difference\nbetween \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d and its\nantecedents. Horkheimer\u2019s attitude toward the possibility of\nsocial change is less optimistic, and the critical theorist is\ndescribed as having a somewhat antagonistic relationship with the\noppressed. This fits with a general shift in the Frankfurt\nSchool\u2019s work from the 1930s to the 1940s corresponding to a\nlack of faith in the possibility of emancipatory social change. In his\n1937 essay \u201cPhilosophy and Critical Theory,\u201d (which he\nwrote largely as a response to and counterpart with \u201cTraditional\nand Critical Theory\u201d) Herbert Marcuse rhetorically asks what\nhappens \u201cif the development outlined by the theory does not\noccur? What if the forces that were to bring about the transformation\nare suppressed and appear to be defeated?\u201d (Marcuse 1937, 63)\n\u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d is worried precisely\nwith these questions. For a variety of reasons, including obvious\nsocial and political exigencies, Horkheimer and his associates would\nbecome less and less confident that the oppressed classes could become\na force for change. Horkheimer clearly did not believe that compassion\nand the desire to overcome suffering could, on their own, motivate\nsocial change. Consider the assertion in \u201cTraditional and\nCritical Theory\u201d that while the oppressed strive for happiness\nthey do not know how to achieve it, so the theorist must step in and\nhelp the oppressed come to critical consciousness. \u201cEven the\nsituation of the proletariat is\u2026no guarantee of correct\nknowledge\u201d (pp. 211\u2013215); the significance of suffering is\nnot always evident to those who experience it, and it is the job of\nthe social theorist to elaborate on this significance in such a way\nthat it can have practical effect. \u201cTraditional and Critical\nTheory\u201d holds out the hope that this task is possible, but it is\nnoteworthy that the critical theorist is described as being set over\nagainst the oppressed, as \u201cit is the task of the critical\ntheoretician to reduce the tension between his own insight and\noppressed humanity in whose service he thinks\u201d (p. 221).\n\nHorkheimer would become less and less confident that the tension could\nbe so reduced. He also ominously notes that while the \u201ccommodity\neconomy\u201d might at first usher in a period of progress,\n\u201cafter an enormous extension of human control over nature, it\nfinally hinders further development and drives humanity into a new\nbarbarism\u201d (p. 227). This passage states the main themes that\nwould dominate Horkheimer\u2019s work in the 1940s, which would be\nmarked by an increasing pessimism in the ability of rational,\ntheoretical activity to halt that drive toward barbarism.\n4. The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature\n\nIn the late 1930s, Horkheimer described all of his efforts as working\ntoward a project on dialectical logic (Wiggershaus 1994, 177). This\n\u201cdialectics project\u201d would, through many twists and turns,\ndevelop into ideas presented primarily in two books published in 1947.\nHorkheimer was the sole author of Eclipse of Reason, which\nappeared originally in English. The book incorporates and expands on a\nseries of lectures delivered at Columbia University in 1944, and, as\nHorkheimer writes in its preface, presents \u201cin epitome some\naspects\u201d of his work with Adorno from that time (p. vi). That\nwork with Adorno would also produce Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, a collaborative text that was first published in\n1947, after having been distributed as a limited edition typescript in\n1944. It would become the most famous work of the \u201cfirst\ngeneration\u201d of the Frankfurt School, and is surely the work most\ncommonly associated with Horkheimer\u2019s\n name.[4]\n The rest of this section will review the major themes of\nHorkheimer\u2019s work from the 1940s, considering both Dialectic\nof Enlightenment and Eclipse of Reason together.\n4.1 The Critique of Instrumental Reason\n\nIt is noteworthy that the text of Eclipse would eventually be\npublished in German as \u201cZur Kritik der instrumentellen\nVernunft\u201d (\u201cOn the Critique of Instrumental\nReason\u201d). Both Eclipse and Dialectic are\nnuanced texts that present a number of themes, but if there is one\noverarching theme to the work from the 40s it is, as that German title\nsuggests, the critical description of how reason collapses into\nirrationality through its emphasis on instrumental concerns. What is\nat stake here is made most clear by the first chapter of\nEclipse, which is straightforwardly titled \u201cMeans and\nEnds.\u201d Instrumental reason is interested only in determining the\nmeans to a goal, without reasoning about ends in themselves. In\nDialectic, the Enlightenment is largely equated with the\nadvance of instrumental reason, and through instrumental reason,\nEnlightenment turns against itself. This is noted in the very\nbeginning of the text: \u201cEnlightenment, understood in the widest\nsense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human\nbeings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly\nenlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity\u201d\n(p.1).\n\nWhile the strong emphasis on instrumental reason\u2019s domination of\nnature (which will be more fully discussed in \u00a74.2) is new to the\nwork of the 1940s, it picks up on themes present in Horkheimer\u2019s\nearlier work. A prominent component (particularly in\nDialectic) of the critique of instrumental reason is a\ncritique of formalistic rationality, which evokes the criticism of the\nCartesian mathematical method in \u201cTraditional and Critical\nTheory.\u201d On the face of it, one might question the necessary\nlink between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinstrumental.\u201d But\nHorkheimer and Adorno equate formalism with the drive to make nature\ncalculable, and calculability is assimilated to usefulness. Thus\nformalistic reason becomes a species instrumental reason. Along\nsimilar lines, the critique of positivism is repeated in\nEclipse (pp. 40\u201362). All parts of nature that cannot be\ncalculated and formalized fall out of the Enlightenment\u2019s\nscientific picture of the world. This scientific picture is further\nreproduced through activities which seek to dominate nature, thus\ninstrumental-scientific activity creates a reality to fit this\npicture. The inexorable drive of instrumental reason causes this\ndistorted picture to be seen as the only true picture of the world\n(Horkheimer 1947a p. 33).\n\nMoreover, all elements of society, not just scientific research, are\ntouched by the progress of instrumental rationality. Motivated by\nself-preservation, people seek protection from various powerful groups\n(sometimes called \u201crackets,\u201d see Schmid Noerr 2002, and\nStirk 1992 ch. 6). Instrumental rationality causes society to fragment\ninto these various competing cliques. But this fragmentation is\nattended by cultural homogenization, as displayed by the chapter in\nDialectic titled \u201cThe Culture Industry: Enlightenment\nas Mass Deception.\u201d The general thrust of that chapter is that\ninstrumental rationality has assimilated culture to an industrial\nmodel, which leads to a leveling and homogenizing of that culture. At\npoints, this homogenizing move is described as though it is\nnecessarily all-encompassing, as when the authors write that\n\u201canyone who resists can survive only by being incorporated. Once\nregistered as diverging from the culture industry, they belong to it\nas the land reformer does to capitalism\u201d (p. 104).\n\nEclipse also presents a slightly different view of\ninstrumental reason, which is equated with \u201csubjective\nreason,\u201d and contrasted with \u201cobjective\n reason.\u201d[5]\n At the beginning of \u201cMeans and Ends,\u201d Horkheimer notes\nthat \u201cthe average man will say that reasonable things are things\nthat are obviously useful,\u201d and then notes that it is through\n\u201cclassification, inference, and deduction\u2026the abstract\nfunctioning of the thinking mechanism,\u201d that one is to determine\nwhat is thus reasonable (p. 3). Usefulness is further equated with\nwhatever works in favor of one\u2019s self-preservation. This is why\ninstrumental reason is subjective reason; it is thought oriented to\nthe subject\u2019s preservation. Objective reason (which Horkheimer\nlargely associates with history\u2019s great metaphysical systems\nfrom Plato to German Idealism), on the other hand, seeks to root truth\nand meaning, which should be the proper ends of thought, within some\ncomprehensive totality. Objective reason is interested in ends, while\nsubjective reason is interested only in means. Subjective reason thus\nfalls into incoherence, because as the drive toward self-preservation\nbecomes more and more all encompassing, any real conception of the\nsignificance of what is to be preserved is lost. Subjectivity is so\noriented toward self-preservation that the drive toward\nself-preservation is the only end left. An interesting comparison can\nbe drawn here with the earlier critique of capitalist social\narrangements discussed in \u00a72.2 above. There the similar point is\nmade that the drive to fulfill self interests is ultimately self\ndefeating. But there is a crucial difference; in the works from the\n1930s this is clearly said to be the fault of irrationality, and it is\nsupposed that more rational social arrangements could overcome the\nproblem. In the works from the 1940s, rationality itself is\nimpugned.\n\nThis description of subjective reason thus displays one way in which\nreason works against itself, and so falls into irrationality. A more\nfamous way that this movement is displayed is through one of the\nprimary themes of Dialectic, viz. that \u201cmyth is already\nenlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology\u201d (p.\nxviii). Myth is already enlightenment insofar as myths are already an\nattempt to control nature; \u201cmyth sought to report, to name, to\ntell of origins, but therefore also to narrate, record, explain\u201d\n(p. 5). The interpretation of the Odyssey in Excursus I\nserves as a concrete example of this point. In general, the\nOdyssey maps out and rationally orders ancient myths, and\nshows how humanity, in the person of Odysseus, goes about submitting\nthe mythological to rational control (pp. 35\u201340). Just as myth\nprefigured enlightenment, enlightenment in turn becomes myth insofar\nas our abstract categories become reified, leveling their relation to\nnature and thus making them untrue. This is the case, for example,\nwith the formalistic scientific picture of the world mentioned above;\n\u201cthe mythical scientific respect of peoples for the given\nreality, which they themselves constantly create, finally becomes\nitself a positive fact, a fortress before which even the revolutionary\nimagination feels shamed as utopianism\u201d (p. 33).\n4.2 The Domination of Outer and Inner Nature\n\nInstrumental rationality necessarily involves the domination of\nnature. Taken in its most straightforward sense, this point has become\nsomething of a commonplace. As the sciences developed during the\nenlightenment period (and earlier, insofar as myth was already\nenlightenment), technology also developed, at the service of\nself-preservation. Technology involves making over nature for human\npurposes. This movement ends up thwarting human preservation, however,\ninsofar as the destruction of nature involves the destruction of\nhumanity. This now fairly common line of critique is complicated in\nHorkheimer\u2019s work from the 1940s, however, because instrumental\nrationality\u2019s distortion of \u201couter nature\u201d (nature\ntaken in the most straightforward sense), is directly tied to the\nrepression of \u201cinner nature.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201cinner nature\u201d is tied to the Freudian\nlibido theory already mentioned in \u00a72.1 above. Our inner life is\nmost immediately, or \u201cnaturally,\u201d marked by various\ndrives, particularly the desire for pleasure (which would be akin to\nthe desire for happiness discussed above). On the Freudian view ego\ndevelopment involves the suppression of these various drives (along\nthese lines Horkheimer directly mentions Freud in Eclipse in\ndiscussing the way the child relates to the superego which embodies\nthe principles of father-figures; see p. 75). While the development of\nthe ego is necessary, undue repression of our inner drives leads to\npathological results. In Excursus II of Dialectic, this\nrepression of inner nature is related to Kant\u2019s moral theory,\ninsofar as it specifies that the will should follow reason against\ninclination. This complete denial of inclination by calculating reason\nfinds its fullest expression (in an ironic suggestion that would\nsurely horrify Kant) in the writings of the Marquis de Sade. Pleasure,\nin Sade\u2019s orgies, is submitted to rigorous order, such that the\nrationalized pursuit of pleasure takes precedence over pleasure itself\n(pp. 66\u201369). And importantly in this case it is not only the\ninner desires that are subjugated; others people are subjugated in the\nprocess of subjugating pleasure to organization. This is one instance\nof Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s broader claim that the domination of\nnature leads to the domination of human beings.\n\nThe same points are made in Eclipse in the chapter \u201cThe\nRevolt of Nature,\u201d where the domination of inner nature is\ndescribed as following necessarily from the domination of outer\nnature. Instrumental reason leads us to dominate outer nature by\ntaking outer nature to be meaningless apart from the way it can\nsatisfy the prerogatives of our self-preservation. But this further\nrequires that our desires must be construed in such a way that they\ncan provide a clear guide for the technological and industrial\nactivity that makes use of outer nature. In this case,\n\u201cdomination becomes \u2018internalized\u2019 for\ndomination\u2019s sake. What is usually indicated as a goal\u2014the\nhappiness of the individual, health, wealth\u2014gains its\nsignificance exclusively from its functional potentiality\u201d (p.\n64). Lohmann 1993 suggestively sums up Horkheimer\u2019s point by\nreferring to the domination of outer and inner nature as a process of\n\u201cdesubstantialization\u201d (p. 392). This connects clearly\nwith the contrast between objective and subjective reason discussed\nabove. Nature loses its objective meaning, or in this sense, its own\n\u201csubstance\u201d; not only in the case of outer nature, but\nalso in the case of inner nature, because of the functionalization of\nour desires and drives. Eclipse construes this in terms of a\nloss of autonomy, which would involve our creatively developing drives\nand desires into ideal ends that could orient the ways we act on our\nenvironments (see, for example, 66). This can make sense of the\nsomewhat unique interpretation in Dialectic of Odysseus\ntelling the cyclops that he is \u201cNobody\u201d (p. 53). As we\nreduce our inner nature to instrumental functions, we lose any strong\nsense of self, and thus lack the inner substance in a manner that\nmakes us, metaphorically, into nobodies.\n4.3 Sources of Emancipation\n\nThe upshot of these views seems to be that reason is self-destructive\nin a way that limits the very possibility of a rational critique of\nreason. It is fairly common to interpret the work from the 1940s as\nbeing so totalizing in its critique that it closes all avenues for\nfinding in reason the possibility for any emancipatory critique of\nsociety (Habermas is the most famous exponent of such a critique, see\nfor example his 1984, pp. 366\u2013399). One can certainly find much\npessimistic rhetoric in both Dialectic and Eclipse\nthat supports such a notion. But there are also elements of the text\nthat hint at the possibility for positive social change, such that the\nemancipatory aim of earlier critical theory is not entirely lost.\n\nThe emancipatory aim is not lost, but it is perhaps obscured. In the\nfirst essay of Dialectic, it is noted that \u201ca true\npraxis capable of overturning the status quo depends on theory\u2019s\nrefusal to yield to the oblivion in which society allows thought to\nossify\u201d (p. 33). That \u201ctheory\u201d and\n\u201cthought\u201d are so emphasized is important. Relatedly,\nHorkheimer disavows, in the preface to Eclipse, the idea he\nshould present a program of action, because \u201caction for\naction\u2019s sake is in no way superior to thought for\nthought\u2019s sake, and is perhaps even inferior to it\u201d (p.\nvi). This does not necessarily separate thought from action, of\ncourse, and the quote from Dialectic speaks of a \u201ctrue\npraxis.\u201d But genuinely emancipatory action is said to depend on\ncorrecting problems of thought first, such that Horkheimer would\nstress thought for thought\u2019s sake. Correcting these problems\nwould require freeing reason from instrumentality, which would mean\neschewing formalism. But this does not mean eschewing reason, if there\ncan be a kind of knowing that uses rational concepts while at the same\ntime moving beyond the static form of concepts associated with\nscientific thinking. Such a view is closely associated with\nAdorno\u2019s later work (see the entry in this encyclopedia on\nAdorno, Zuidervaart 2008). It is sometimes argued that the unusual\nliterary style of Dialectic itself is meant to exemplify such\nan attempt at escaping the ossification of thought (for an\ninterpretation that generally takes such a view, see Honneth 2007).\nAlong somewhat similar lines, modern art might have emancipatory\npotential, in its ability to express something of the current state of\nsociety through means other than formal reasoning. This is, again, a\nview that is commonly associated with Adorno\u2019s thought. But\nHorkheimer also presents such a view, especially in his 1941 essay\n\u201cArt and Mass Culture.\u201d There culture is criticized in a\nmanner similar to the discussion of the culture industry in\nDialectic, and a largely pessimistic picture of the\nrestrictive and homogenizing role of contemporary mass culture is\npresented. But Horkheimer does note that some art can break free of\nthis and still help the human being \u201cconceive of a world\ndifferent from that in which he lives.\u201d Such works (Horkheimer\nmentions Joyce\u2019s literature and Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica) can do so only negatively, however, by displaying\nthe difference between the human being and his or her \u201cbarbarous\nsurrounding\u201d (p. 278; on Horkheimer\u2019s views on art see Jay\n1993). In the case both of non-ossifying thought and modern art, the\nemancipatory potential is found only in traces, presented in an\nesoteric and perhaps abstruse manner. Such a conception of\n\u201cemancipation\u201d now seems to be somewhat separated from the\nexperience of the proletariat, and is possibly evidence of elitism\n(see Heller 2002). Whatever one makes of these criticisms, it is clear\nthat Horkheimer was less than sanguine regarding the possibility of\npositive social change.\n\nHorkheimer does suggest another avenue for emancipatory social change,\nhowever. He notes in Eclipse that \u201cthere are some\nforces of resistance left within man,\u201d and that \u201cthe\nspirit of humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a\nmember of social groups, at least in the individual as far as he is\nleft alone\u201d (p. 95). Unsurprisingly given the tone of the text\nas a whole, much of what follows that passage discusses the difficulty\nof separating oneself from the homogenizing forces of society. But\nHorkheimer does suggest that it is possible to engage in a kind of\nnon-conformism (without much of a description of what it would be\nlike), which comes through the \u201cspontaneity of the individual\nsubject\u201d (p. 99). The emphasis on individual action is tempered,\nhowever, through the emphasizing of a point that brings the latter\nparts of Eclipse back to one of Horkheimer\u2019s earliest\nviews; solidarity can be formed through the experience of shared\nsuffering, and philosophy should \u201ctranslate what [those who\nsuffer in the face of oppression] have done into language that will be\nheard\u201d (p.109). How this happens is unclear, as is the\nconnection between individual acts of non-conformism and solidarity.\nOne might also doubt the reliance on the power of the compassion. For\na thorough discussion of Eclipse that examines these\npotential problems, see Lohmann 1993. Whatever one makes of these\npoints, it is clear that this emphasis on suffering is the thread that\nties all of the periods of Horkheimer\u2019s work together, as it\nwould continue to be present in Horkheimer\u2019s last works.\n5. Late Work\n\nWith his return to Frankfurt the year after the publication of both\nEclipse of Reason and Dialectic of Enlightenment,\nHorkheimer\u2019s academic production would largely consist of essays\nand lectures. He also left a number of unpublished texts from the\nperiod, including a set of notes and aphorisms published shortly after\nhis death (along with a set of aphorisms from the early 30s titled\nD\u00e4mmerung) under the name Notizen 1950 bis\n1969. There is no real systematic unity to these writings\n(Habermas 1993, p. 51 even refers to them as \u201cshot through with\ncontradictions\u201d), but there are common themes that can be\nexplored.\n\nOne can, for instance, trace out Horkheimer\u2019s late views on the\ntasks of critical theory. In a remark in Notizen from\n1957\u20131958 titled \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d he pursues the\nidea mentioned in the preface to Eclipse that philosophy need\nnot be immediately related to practical action. Philosophy\n\u201cholds up a mirror to the world\u201d but \u201cit is no\nimperative\u201d (p. 148). It is as though Horkheimer wants to guard\nagainst a caricature of his earlier views as blindly equating theory\nand practice. But there is also a very pessimistic note sounded when\nHorkheimer says that philosophy \u201chas replaced theology but found\nno new heaven to which it might point, not even a heaven on\nearth\u201d (p. 148). Horkheimer touches on these same themes in his\n1956 conversations with Adorno in which they preliminarily discussed\nproducing a new (never finished) joint work. In the transcripts of\nthose conversations (which were published in 1989 as a part of\nHorkheimer\u2019s collected works with the title\n\u201cDiskussion \u00fcber Theorie und Praxis\u201d) one\nfinds Horkheimer continually stressing the importance of linking\ntheory to practice without reducing the former to the latter. And\nwhile he does at points seem to hold out a vague hope for such a\ncombination of theory and practice, he also pessimistically claims\nthat \u201cit is easy to believe that the whole of world history is\njust a fly caught in the flames\u201d (p.39). Because of this\npessimism, critical theory takes on a primarily negative task. In\nanother note from a collection dated 1966\u20131969 titled \u201cOn\nCritical Theory\u201d he continues with the idea that no positive\nconception of the good can be formed, but \u201cif one wishes to\ndefine the good as the attempt to abolish evil,\u201d such a view can\nbe formed, and \u201cthis is the teaching of Critical Theory\u201d\n(p. 237).\n\nThe negative conception of critical theory is closely related to the\nrenewed interest Horkheimer showed in Schopenhauer in his last works.\nSchopenhauer is said, in the 1961 essay \u201cSchopenhauer\nToday,\u201d to be \u201cthe teacher for modern times\u201d (p.\n81). This is in part because Schopenhauer\u2019s work grasps the need\nto focus on the suffering of the present as it is, without covering it\nover with a false philosophical conception of the good. To a certain\nextent this repeats the earlier emphasis on suffering and rejection of\nmetaphysics. But these points work in a much more pessimistic\ndirection, because, \u201caccording to Schopenhauer, philosophy does\nnot set up any practical aims\u201d (p. 80). It rather focuses on\ncorrectly grasping suffering. Schopenhauerian pessimism also connects\nwith an interest in negative theology in Horkheimer\u2019s late work.\nIn 1935, he would write that the religious belief in another world of\nperfect justice, when uncoupled from \u201cthe inhibiting religious\nform\u201d amounted to a positive force for social change (Horkheimer\n1935c, p. 131). In his late writings this combination of criticism of\norganized religion and respect for the desire for the \u201cwholly\nother\u201d would be further developed (see Siebert 1976). In\nreligious beliefs, if not in organized religion, Horkheimer would find\na desire for a better world that never forgets the suffering of this\nworld (see, for instance, Horkheimer 1963).\n\nThe overall tenor of Horkheimer\u2019s last writings has led some to\ncriticize him for falling into a backhanded form of conservatism (see,\nfor example, Bronner 1994, pp. 88\u201392). This criticism makes some\nsense, especially when one considers the political climate of the late\n1960s that served as a backdrop for his latest work. It is pertinent,\nalong these lines, that he was generally opposed to the radical\nstudent movements, and he supported (with much qualification) the\nVietnam War as an attempt to halt the totalitarian movement of Chinese\nCommunism (on these points see Stirk 1992, 178\u2013181). But\nHorkheimer did not give up on the possibility of radical action\nentirely. For example, Notizen ends on something of a\npositive note by ( in the note \u201cFor Nonconformism\u201d)\nholding out hope that the \u201ccritical analysis of\ndemagogues\u201d might aid the practical work of those who are\nattempting to create non-conformist collectives that work against\ncurrent society. But the primary possibility for hope discussed in\nHorkheimer\u2019s later work is compassion, as seen at the end of the\n1961 essay \u201cThe German Jews\u201d:\n\nThe decisive point\u2014and the real task of education without which\nneither the Jewish nor the Christian nor the German cause is\nhelped\u2014is that men should become sensitive not to injustice\nagainst the Jews but to any and all persecution, and that something in\nthem should rebel when any individual is not treated as a rational\nbeing. (p. 118)\n\n\nIn a way, this passage sums up the aim of all of Horkheimer\u2019s\nwork, early to late. The task of education, and the task of the\ncritical theorist, is to foster such compassionate sensitivity to\ninjustice.\n",
