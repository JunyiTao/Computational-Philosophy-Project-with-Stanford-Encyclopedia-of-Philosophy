    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge\n3. Accounts of Self-Knowledge\n\nAccounts of self-knowledge vary across a number of dimensions,\nincluding: how self-knowledge is achieved; the kind and degree of\nepistemic security that self-ascriptions possess; the nature of our\n(epistemic) privilege and (social-linguistic) authority relative to\nour mental states; and the role of our observational, rational,\nagential, and expressive powers in explaining first-person privilege\nand authority.\n\nThese accounts also differ as to their scope. Acquaintance theorists\nmainly aim to explain how we know what we\u2019re currently thinking\nand feeling (our \u201coccurrent\u201d states). Reasons theorists and\nAgentialists are exclusively concerned with self-knowledge of those\nattitudes that represent our commitments, such as beliefs and\nintentions. Proponents of the Inner Sense, Self-Interpretation,\nEmpiricist Transparency, Rationalist, and Expressivist accounts differ\nas to the scope of these accounts. Each of these is taken, by at least\none of its proponents, to apply to all kinds of mental states. This\nvariety means that hybrid views are possible. For instance, one might\nthink that an Acquaintance account explains how we know our sensations\nwhile Agentialism best explains self-knowledge of beliefs.\n\nIn what follows, I proceed from broadly empiricist accounts, which\ntake self-knowledge to be a form of empirical knowledge, to accounts\nthat emphasize the role of a priori reasoning in\nself-knowledge, and finally to accounts that take the special features\nof self-knowledge to derive from our capacity for agency or\nself-expression.\n",
