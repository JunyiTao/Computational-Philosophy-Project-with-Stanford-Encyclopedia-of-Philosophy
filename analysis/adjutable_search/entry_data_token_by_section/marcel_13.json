    "main_text": "Religious Belief\n14. Religious Belief\n\nThroughout the course of his work, Marcel arrived at an essentially\ntheistic, specifically Christian, worldview, leading many to describe\nhim as a Christian or theistic existentialist (especially in\nopposition to Sartre). Indeed, some thinkers regard Marcel\u2019s\nphilosophical writings on religious belief as his most profound\ncontribution to philosophy: \u201cFrom the beginning of his\nphilosophical career, Marcel\u2019s main interest has been the\ninterpretation of religious experience, that is, of the relation\nbetween man and ultimate reality\u201d (Cain, 1979, p. 87).\nMarcel\u2019s early reflections, especially in Being and\nHaving, laid the seeds for his conversion to Catholicism at the\nage of 40, though he believed that his philosophical ideas, and\ncentral Christian themes, though complementary, were in fact\nindependent of each other: \u201cIt is quite possible that the\nexistence of the fundamental Christian data may be necessary in\nfact to enable the mind to conceive some of the notions which I\nhave attempted to analyze; but these notions cannot be said to depend\non the data of Christianity, and they do not presuppose it .\n. . I have experienced [the development of these ideas] more than\ntwenty years before I had the remotest thought of becoming a\nCatholic\u201d (Marcel, 1995, pp. 44-45). Marcel became a Catholic\nwhen the French novelist, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac (1885--1979),\nrecognized various themes in his writing concerning commitment,\nforgiveness, moral character and the religious justification of the\nmoral order. Mauriac wrote to Marcel and explicitly asked him whether\nhe ought not to join the Catholic Church, a call to which, after a\nperiod of reflection, Marcel assented. It is noteworthy that his\nconversion did not significantly change his philosophy, although it\ndid lead to an increased focus on how various experiences, especially\nmoral experiences, may point to the presence of the transcendent in\nhuman life.\n\nMarcel, as one would expect, does not engage in philosophy of religion\nin the traditional sense. He is often critical of various attempts to\n\u201cprove\u201d the existence of God in the history of philosophy,\nsuch as those to be found in Thomism. He regards such attempts as\nbelonging to the realm of primary reflection, and as such, they leave\nout the personal experience of God, which is necessarily lost in the\nmove to abstraction. Marcel notes that committed religious believers\nare not greatly interested in arguments for God\u2019s existence, and\nmay even look upon these arguments with suspicion; atheists are also\nusually not persuaded by such arguments (Marcel, 1951b, p. 196;\nMarcel, 1964, p. 179). Another reason for the lack of efficacy of\nformal arguments is that many in the contemporary world are not open\nto the religious worldview. Marcel introduces a distinction between\n\u201canti-theists\u201d and \u201catheists\u201d to make this\npoint. Whereas an atheist is somebody who does not believe in God, an\nanti-theist is somebody who does not want to believe in God. It is\npossible, Marcel observes, to close oneself off from the experience of\nthe religious in human life, not for rational reasons, but for reasons\nof self-interest, or from a desire to avoid religious morality, or to\navoid submission to an outside authority. This view is prevalent, he\nbelieves, not just in modern life, but also in modern philosophy:\n\u201cThe history of modern philosophy seems to supply abundant\nillustration of the progressive replacement of atheism by\u2026an\nanti-theism, whose mainspring is to will that God should\nnot be\u201d (Marcel 1951b, p. 176). The prevalence of this\nattitude makes it even more difficult to pursue a purely rational\napproach to God\u2019s existence.\n\nHowever, Marcel develops another approach to the question of God, and\nmany themes in his work are concerned in one way or another with this\ntopic. He belongs to the line of thinkers, which includes Soren\nKierkegaard and Martin Buber in philosophy, and Karl Barth and Paul\nTillich in theology, who draw attention to the non-theoretical\ndimension of religious belief, and moral experience. His approach is\nphenomenological in character, involving a description of various\nhuman experiences and the attempt to reveal their underlying meaning\nand justification. Marcel\u2019s position is that there is a set of\nprofound human experiences (some of which we have described earlier)\nthat reveal the presence of God (the \u2018Absolute Thou\u2019) in\nhuman life. These experiences are present in the lives of most human\nbeings, even though a particular individual might not necessarily\nconnect them with a religious worldview, or come to an affirmation of\nGod based on them. The experiences mentioned above of fidelity, hope,\npresence and intersubjectivity, which all involve profound commitments\nthat cannot be captured and analyzed in objective terms, but that are\nnonetheless real and can at least be partly described conceptually (in\nphilosophy, but especially in literature, drama and art [Marcel,\n1963]), are best explained if they are understood as being pledged to\nan absolute, transcendent reality. As noted, the experience of\nfidelity is one of his favorite examples. Fidelity involves a certain\nway of being with another person. The other person is not seen as a\nperson with a certain set of desirable characteristics, or as\nidentified with a function, or even as a rational, autonomous subject;\nrather he or she is experienced as a \u201cthou,\u201d a person with\nwhom I identify and am one with on the path of life (Anderson, 1982,\np. 31). Fidelity is an experience that the other will not fail me, and\nthat I will not fail them, and so, as we have seen, it is deeper than\nconstancy (in many relationships, fidelity is reduced to constancy).\nMarcel suggests that such experiences have religious significance,\nbecause the individual often appeals to an ultimate strength which\nfrom within enables him to make the pledge which he knows he could not\nmake from himself alone (Pax, 1972, p. 60).\n\nMarcel holds that unconditional commitments such as these are best\nexplained if understood as being pledged to an absolute transcendence.\nIndeed, given that life is full of temptations and challenges, the\nrecognition of an absolute Thou also helps the individual to\nkeep his or her commitments. Of hope he observes: \u201cThe\nonly possible source from which this absolute hope springs must once\nmore be stressed. It appears as a response of the creature to the\ninfinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing everything that it has\nand upon whom it cannot impose any condition whatsoever\u201d\n(Marcel, 1962a, p. 47). \u201cUnconditionality,\u201d as he has also\nnoted, \u201cis the true sign of God\u2019s presence\u201d (Marcel,\n1950-51, p. 40). In general, his position is that the affirmation of\nGod can only be attained by an individual at the level of a\nbeing-in-a-situation, or secondary reflection. At the level of primary\nreflection, the existence of God cannot be demonstrated, because the\nindividual must be personally involved in the various experiences that\ncan lead to an affirmation, but such genuine involvement is precluded\nat the level of abstraction. Yet, this does not mean that philosophy\nof religion in the traditional sense is not important; indeed\nMarcel\u2019s reflections just mentioned must be regarded as part of\nan attempt to show, however indirectly, that belief in God is\nreasonable, but, as with all areas of primary reflection, we should\nrecognize the limitations of a purely rational approach to religious\nbelief.\n",
