    "main_text": "Formalism and Anti-formalism || Anti-Formalism and Functional Beauty\n5.2 Anti-Formalism and Functional Beauty\nThe anti-formalist traditionally focuses on the importance to\naesthetic judgment about non-formal properties, including historical\ncontext; other, categorial forms of context (Walton 1970); or\nnon-cognitive properties. As an architectural application would have\nit, we likely judge Jefferson\u2019s University of Virginia campus as\nstately or dignified or evocative of democratic ideals because of the\nneo-classical design, the campus\u2019 place in histories of American\narchitecture and university architecture, and its continuous\nrededication through the everyday functioning of an enduring, living\nuniversity. None of this judgment appears to have particular roots in\nforms Jefferson deployed, except as befit a neo-classical\nstyle\u2014which style may be best grasped in historicist terms.\nAside from historicism, a principal variant of architectural\nanti-formalism derives from functional beauty theory, which has its\nroots in (a) a late modern tradition of judging an object beautiful if\nfit for its intended function (Parsons and Carlson (2008) find this\ntradition in Berkeley's Alciphron (1732) and Hume's related\nsuggestion (Treatise (1739-40)) that beauty of artifacts consists in\ntheir appearing to bear utility), and (b) Kant\u2019s proposal that\narchitecture is an artform capable of generating dependent beauty. (In\nthe latter case, beauty stands in relation to concepts with which we\nassociate architectural objects, which for such objects are typically\nthe ends towards which they are created.) One modern version proposes\ngauging the beauty of a designed object by reference to\ndesigner\u2019s intent in crafting a functional solution; for\nS. Davies (2006), where an object displays functional beauty,\naesthetic considerations and the object\u2019s primary function each\nact to shape the other. Per Parsons and Carlson (2008), the\nproblem with such intentionalist accounts in architecture (or\nelsewhere where functional beauty pertains) is that functions\nchange. To work around this difficulty, they suggest, we need\na theory focused on \u201cproper functions\u201d for the artifacts\nin question. This view is modeled on a selected effects account of\nbiological functions, as translated into a marketplace-driven scheme,\nwhere evolution of design solutions is driven by demand over time.\nFunctional beauty faces several challenges. Even in their advocacy,\nParsons and Carlson caution against the suggestion that function\nsolely determines form, as that would neglect other features\nof artifacts not possibly highlighted by their functions. Such\nfeatures include cultural significance or aspects of\nnon-dependent beauty as may be found in, for example, architectural\nornament. (In Davies\u2019 picture, there is no such neglect because\nthe functioning of artifacts\u2014including art and architectural\nobjects\u2014may have a cultural, spiritual, or otherwise\nnon-mechanical cast.) In the architectural realm, another challenge is\nposed by ruins, which may be beautiful but have no functions.  To the\ncharge that these represent counterexamples to functional beauty\ntheory, one tack is to answer that if ruins represent architectural\nobjects, they are dysfunctional and their beauty is manifest in\nnon-functional ways (Parsons and Carlson). Functional beauty theory is\nsaved on the whole but not as universally characteristic of\narchitectural objects.\nA further challenge casts doubt on seeing functional beauty as the\nonly variant of dependent beauty, or beauty as the sole aesthetic\nvalence of interest to a viable notion of dependent aesthetic\nproperties. In an architectural vein, those variants may include\nspiritual, emotional, or conceptual frameworks we bring to our grasp\nof such built structures as houses of worship, memorials, or triumphal\narches. We can tell functional stories about these sorts of structures\nin sociological or psychological analyses but not (or not only), as\nfunctional beauty accounts would have it, in terms of their mechanical\nor system-wise functioning.  \nLooking beyond functional beauty\u2014or more broadly, dependent\nbeauty\u2014accounts of architecture, an inclusivist will seek the\nthread that ties together architectural objects with aesthetic\nproperties of all description, be they functional, otherwise\ndependent, or freely (independently) endowed with beauty or other such\nproperties. Thus, a modernist gas station and a Tschumi folie\nmay share an elegance unrelated to functional ascription or\nthe lack thereof. A general theory of architectural objects, along\ninclusivist lines, suggests at least a moderate formalism.\n",
