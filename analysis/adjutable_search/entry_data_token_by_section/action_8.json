    "main_text": "Practical Knowledge || The Nature of Practical Knowledge\n4.1 The Nature of Practical Knowledge\n\nThe idea that there is a distinctively practical form of knowledge\ntraces back to Aristotle, who distinguished different ways \u201dby\nvirtue of which the soul possesses truth\u201c (EE\n5.3/NE 6.3). There are three theoretical forms by which a\nscientist grasps the truth: knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea),\nwisdom (sophia), and comprehension (nous). Practical\nknowledge comes in two varieties: the knowledge of the skilled person\nabout what she makes\u2014skill (techn\u00ea), and the\nknowledge of the virtuous person about her actions\u2014practical\nwisdom (phron\u00easis).\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of practical knowledge is complex, and our\nfocus shall lie on three points of particular significance. First,\nAristotle claimed that skill is the \u201dcause\u201c\n(aitia) of the things produced by it. For instance, he\nclaimed that the craft of building is the cause of the house\n(Phys. 2.5, 196b26). Second, Aristotle imposed epistemic\nconditions on voluntary and, a fortiori, intentional action: according\nto him, to act voluntarily one must know, among other things, what one\nis doing, to whom, and why (NE 3.1 1111a3\u20136; EE 2.9\n1225a36\u2013b10). Third, Aristotle identified a distinctive kind of\nreasoning associated with practical knowledge, a form of reasoning\ntraditionally rendered \u201dpractical syllogism\u201c (though see\nSegvic 2011). Such reasoning begins from a certain good and its\nconclusion is an action. For instance, on the basis of thinking that\nwalks are good after lunch, and that he has eaten lunch, a man might\ntake a walk (DMA 7, 701a13\u201314). (For more on ancient\nviews on action, see Parry 2021.)\n\nSeveral mediaeval philosophers built on these Aristotelian ideas,\nespecially to understand God\u2019s knowledge of creation (see\nSchwenkler 2015). Anscombe (1957)\u2019s account of practical\nknowledge draws on this tradition. She first characterizes intentional\naction as that to which a special sense of the question\n\u201dWhy?\u201c applies, the sense that requests a reason for\naction (\u00a75). Later, Anscombe appeals to Aristotle\u2019s notion\nof practical reasoning to connect the notion of reason for action and\nthe deliberative structure by which an agent determines how to attain\na goal by acting (\u00a733ff.). What the question \u201dWhy?\u201c\nreveals, then, is the rational \u201dorder\u201c of means-to-ends\nthat define practical reasoning, and the answers reveal the\ndescriptions under which the action is intentional.\n\nTo illustrate with her famous example of a man pumping water\n(\u00a723): A man is moving his arms up and down. Why? Because he is\noperating a pump. Why? Because he is pumping water. Why? Because he is\npoisoning the inhabitants of the house (you see, the water is\npoisoned). Why? Because he wants to kill them to bring world peace.\nThe question \u201dWhy?\u201c has application only inasmuch as the\nagent recognizes himself as acting under the corresponding\ndescriptions expressed by his answers. As Anscombe notes, if the man\nwere asked \u201dWhy are you pumping water?\u201c and he replied,\n\u201dI was not aware I was doing that\u201c, then he would not be\nacting intentionally under that description (\u00a76; \u00a742). The\ndescriptions that manifest the agent\u2019s understanding of what she\nis doing are therefore intrinsic to the action: an action does not\ncount as intentional under a description unless the agent grasps the\naction as such (under that description). Such grasp, therefore, cannot\nbe a separate occurrence (\u00a742).\n\nThis reveals at least one important sense in which practical knowledge\nis the \u201dcause of what it understands\u201c. It is the formal\ncause because the agent\u2019s grasp determines what the action is\n(an intentional action with a determinate content). In turn, this\nshows why, in the phrase Anscombe borrows from Aristotle\u2019s\nMagna Moralia, \u201dthe mistake is in the\nperformance\u201c when it doesn\u2019t conform to the judgment\n(\u00a732): qua formal cause, the knowledge sets the standard for what\nis known. Whether, like Aristotle, Anscombe holds that practical\nknowledge is also an efficient cause is a complex, and disputed\nquestion (see Setiya 2016a for skepticism, and Pi\u00f1eros\nGlasscock 2020a for endorsement).\n\nOne last important aspect of Anscombe\u2019s conception of practical\nknowledge is the contention that an agent knows what she is doing\n\u201dwithout observation\u201c (1957, \u00a78). This is because,\nintuitively, whereas I need to look at what is being written on the\nboard to know what someone else is writing, I don\u2019t need to look\nat what I am doing to know what I am writing. Beyond\nintuitive examples, however, it has proven difficult to explain what\nnon-observational knowledge\n is.[5]\n Nevertheless, there are three points on which there is wide\nagreement. First, the class of practical knowledge is a proper\nsubclass of the class of non-observational knowledge, one that also\nincludes, for instance, knowledge of our limbs\u2019s position\n(\u00a7\u00a79\u201310). Second, to say that knowledge is non-observational\nis minimally to say that it is non-inferential. Third, and finally,\nthe non-observational character of this knowledge is of the sort\ntraditionally associated with mental states. Hence, one of the most\nremarkable theses of Intention is that public\nhappenings\u2014actions\u2014could be known in the distinctive way\ntraditionally reserved for internal mental states, so that there would\nbe \u201dspontaneous knowledge of material reality\u201c (R\u00f6dl\n2007, 121).\n",
