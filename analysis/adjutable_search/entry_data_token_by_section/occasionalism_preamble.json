    "main_text": "\n\nWe live in a world that seems to be brimming with causal activity. I\npush the keys on my keyboard, and letters appear on the screen.\nOutside the wind blows leaves across the patio. The ringing of the\nphone cuts short my idling thoughts.\n\nPhilosophers have long wondered about the nature of causality. Are\nthere true causes at work in the world, and, if so, what makes them\nthe causes they are? How do causes bring things about, and what kind\nof connection does a cause have to its effect? These questions took on\nanother level of complexity when various religious and theological\nconsiderations were brought to bear on these issues. For instance,\nphilosophers came to question how divine causal activity is to be\nunderstood, particularly, in relation to the natural causality of\ncreatures. It is from this context, in which questions about the\nnature of causation intermixed with questions about the relation\nbetween divine and natural causality, that occasionalism emerged.\nOccasionalism attempts to address these questions by presenting as its\ncore intuition the claim that, regardless of our common sense\ninclinations, God is the one and only true cause. In the words of the\nmost famous occasionalist of the Western philosophical tradition,\nNicolas Malebranche, \u201cthere is only one true cause because there\nis only one true God; \u2026 the nature or power of each thing is\nnothing but the will of God; \u2026 all natural causes are not\ntrue causes but only occasional causes\u201d\n(OCM II, 312 / Search 448) A full-blown\noccasionalist, like Malebranche, then, might be described as one who\nsubscribes to the following two tenets: (1) the positive thesis that\nGod is the only genuine cause; (2) the negative thesis that no\ncreaturely cause is a genuine cause but at most an occasional cause.\nNot all philosophers who have been identified as occasionalists,\nhowever, were full-blown occasionalists in this sense, since some\nargued that only a limited subset of creatures lack causal powers, and\nthus affirmed the causal efficacy of other creatures. For these\noccasionalists, the two theses just stated above would be too strong,\nand they would subscribe instead to a weaker position along the\nfollowing lines: while God is the unique genuine cause in some\nrestricted domain, other genuine creaturely causes are operative in\nthe world, and not all creaturely causes are merely occasional\ncauses.\n\nGiven this diversity of positions, it might be helpful to characterize\noccasionalism as follows: one is an occasionalist for domain\nx iff one holds that God is the unique genuine cause within\ndomain x and other alleged causes within this domain are not\nreal causes but at most occasional causes. And by \u201cdomain\u201d\nhere, we refer to the roughly defined set of alleged causal relations\nunder consideration, for instance, the domain of causal relations that\nhold between material or bodily substances. We will have more to say\nabout what an occasional cause is later on, but, at this point, on the\nbasis of the characterization of occasionalism just given, we might\nintroduce some terminology to refer to and differentiate the different\npossible positions among those who subscribe to some form of\noccasionalism. We will refer to the occasionalists who endorse the\nfull-blown version, along the lines of Malebranche, and take the\nnegative thesis that no creature cause is a genuine cause to apply\nacross the board to all finite substances as advocating \u201cglobal\noccasionalism.\u201d Global occasionalism, accordingly, holds that\nall creaturely causation is at most occasional, while divine causation\nis uniquely genuine. In contrast, those who are willing to endorse\nsome genuine causation on the part of creatures, hence restricting\noccasional causation to only a limited domain will be described as\nendorsing a form of \u201clocal occasionalism.\u201d (Lee 2008) \n\nUnderstood in this manner, occasionalism can be understood as a\nmetaphysics of causation that suggests a more discriminating attitude\ntoward what are typically taken to be causal interactions operative in\nthis world. On this characterization, the occasionalist resists a\nunivocal understanding of these apparent causal interactions and\nidentifies two types of relations in the world, that of genuine\ncausation and that of occasional causation. In addition to this issue\nof the scope of occasionalism, we will, in the following sections,\nexamine how occasionalism addresses these issues aforementioned\nconcerning the relation between divine and natural causation, and what\narguments are presented in favor of occasionalism. We begin, however,\nwith a brief discussion about its history.\n",
