    "preamble": "\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is the central figure in modern\nphilosophy. He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism,\nset the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy,\nand continues to exercise a significant influence today in\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics,\nand other fields. The fundamental idea of Kant\u2019s \u201ccritical\nphilosophy\u201d \u2013 especially in his three Critiques: the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of\nPractical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790) \u2013 is human autonomy. He argues that the\nhuman understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that\nstructure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the\nmoral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and\nimmortality. Therefore, scientific knowledge, morality, and religious\nbelief are mutually consistent and secure because they all rest on the\nsame foundation of human autonomy, which is also the final end of\nnature according to the teleological worldview of reflecting judgment\nthat Kant introduces to unify the theoretical and practical parts of\nhis philosophical system. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and works\n\nImmanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in K\u00f6nigsberg, near the\nsoutheastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Today K\u00f6nigsberg has been\nrenamed Kaliningrad and is part of Russia. But during Kant\u2019s\nlifetime K\u00f6nigsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its\ndominant language was German. Though geographically remote from the\nrest of Prussia and other German cities, K\u00f6nigsberg was then a\nmajor commercial center, an important military port, and a relatively\ncosmopolitan university\n town.[1]\n\nKant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was a\nmaster harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness\nmaker, though she was better educated than most women of her social\nclass. Kant\u2019s family was never destitute, but his father\u2019s\ntrade was in decline during Kant\u2019s youth and his parents at\ntimes had to rely on extended family for financial support. \n\nKant\u2019s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school,\nthe Collegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism\nwas an evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion,\nreliance on divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and\npersonal devotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and\nintrospection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching\nto which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response\nto which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to\nthe school\u2019s curriculum. Later the mature Kant\u2019s emphasis\non reason and autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either\nauthority or grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against\nPietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he\nhad deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his\nmother, whose \u201cgenuine religiosity\u201d he described as\n\u201cnot at all enthusiastic.\u201d According to his biographer,\nManfred Kuehn, Kant\u2019s parents probably influenced him much less\nthrough their Pietism than through their artisan values of \u201chard\nwork, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,\u201d which they taught\nhim by\n example.[2]\n\n\nKant attended college at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, known as\nthe Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly\nsuperseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and\nwhich encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic,\nmetaphysics, ethics, and natural law. Kant\u2019s philosophy\nprofessors exposed him to the approach of Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131750), whose critical synthesis of the philosophy of G. W.\nLeibniz (1646\u20131716) was then very influential in German\nuniversities. But Kant was also exposed to a range of German and\nBritish critics of Wolff, and there were strong doses of\nAristotelianism and Pietism represented in the philosophy faculty as\nwell. Kant\u2019s favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen\n(1713\u20131751), a Pietist who was heavily influenced by both Wolff\nand the English philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704). Knutzen\nintroduced Kant to the work of Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727), and his\ninfluence is visible in Kant\u2019s first published work,\nThoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1747),\nwhich was a critical attempt to mediate a dispute in natural\nphilosophy between Leibnizians and Newtonians over the proper\nmeasurement of force.\n\nAfter college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young\nchildren outside K\u00f6nigsberg. By this time both of his parents had\ndied and Kant\u2019s finances were not yet secure enough for him to\npursue an academic career. He finally returned to K\u00f6nigsberg in\n1754 and began teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the\nnext four decades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement\nfrom teaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two.\n\nKant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned\nfrom working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three\nscientific works \u2013 one of which, Universal Natural History\nand Theory of the Heavens (1755), was a major book in which,\namong other things, he developed what later became known as the\nnebular hypothesis about the formation of the solar system.\nUnfortunately, the printer went bankrupt and the book had little\nimmediate impact. To secure qualifications for teaching at the\nuniversity, Kant also wrote two Latin dissertations: the first,\nentitled Concise Outline of Some Reflections on Fire (1755),\nearned him the Magister degree; and the second, New Elucidation of\nthe First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition (1755), entitled\nhim to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The following year he\npublished another Latin work, The Employment in Natural Philosophy\nof Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which Sample I Contains the\nPhysical Monadology (1756), in hopes of succeeding Knutzen as\nassociate professor of logic and metaphysics, though Kant failed to\nsecure this position. Both the New Elucidation, which was\nKant\u2019s first work concerned mainly with metaphysics, and the\nPhysical Monadology further develop the position on the\ninteraction of finite substances that he first outlined in Living\nForces. Both works depart from Leibniz-Wolffian views, though not\nradically. The New Elucidation in particular shows the\ninfluence of Christian August Crusius (1715\u20131775), a German\ncritic of\n Wolff.[3]\n\nAs an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by\nthe students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an\nenormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a\nliving. Kant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period\nhe would lecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic,\nmetaphysics, and ethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical\ngeography. In his lectures Kant used textbooks by Wolffian authors\nsuch as Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714\u20131762) and Georg\nFriedrich Meier (1718\u20131777), but he followed them loosely and\nused them to structure his own reflections, which drew on a wide range\nof ideas of contemporary interest. These ideas often stemmed from\nBritish sentimentalist philosophers such as David Hume\n(1711\u20131776) and Francis Hutcheson (1694\u20131747), some of\nwhose texts were translated into German in the mid-1750s; and from the\nSwiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778), who\npublished a flurry of works in the early 1760s. From early in his\ncareer Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also quickly\ndeveloped a local reputation as a promising young intellectual and cut\na dashing figure in K\u00f6nigsberg society.\n\nAfter several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of\npublications in 1762\u20131764, including five philosophical works.\nThe False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures (1762)\nrehearses criticisms of Aristotelian logic that were developed by\nother German philosophers. The Only Possible Argument in Support\nof a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1762\u20133) is a\nmajor book in which Kant drew on his earlier work in Universal\nHistory and New Elucidation to develop an original\nargument for God\u2019s existence as a condition of the internal\npossibility of all things, while criticizing other arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence. The book attracted several positive and some\nnegative reviews. In 1762 Kant also submitted an essay entitled\nInquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural\nTheology and Morality to a prize competition by the Prussian\nRoyal Academy, though Kant\u2019s submission took second prize to\nMoses Mendelssohn\u2019s winning essay (and was published with it in\n1764). Kant\u2019s Prize Essay, as it is known, departs more\nsignificantly from Leibniz-Wolffian views than his earlier work and\nalso contains his first extended discussion of moral philosophy in\nprint. The Prize Essay draws on British sources to criticize\nGerman rationalism in two respects: first, drawing on Newton, Kant\ndistinguishes between the methods of mathematics and philosophy; and\nsecond, drawing on Hutcheson, he claims that \u201can unanalysable\nfeeling of the good\u201d supplies the material content of our moral\nobligations, which cannot be demonstrated in a purely intellectual way\nfrom the formal principle of perfection alone\n (2:299).[4]\n These themes reappear in the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of\nNegative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763), whose main thesis,\nhowever, is that the real opposition of conflicting forces, as in\ncausal relations, is not reducible to the logical relation of\ncontradiction, as Leibnizians held. In Negative Magnitudes\nKant also argues that the morality of an action is a function of the\ninternal forces that motivate one to act, rather than of the external\n(physical) actions or their consequences. Finally, Observations on\nthe Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime (1764) deals mainly\nwith alleged differences in the tastes of men and women and of people\nfrom different cultures. After it was published, Kant filled his own\ninterleaved copy of this book with (often unrelated) handwritten\nremarks, many of which reflect the deep influence of Rousseau on his\nthinking about moral philosophy in the mid-1760s.\n\nThese works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but\nfor the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German\nphilosophers at the time, Kant\u2019s early works are generally\nconcerned with using insights from British empiricist authors to\nreform or broaden the German rationalist tradition without radically\nundermining its foundations. While some of his early works tend to\nemphasize rationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis.\nDuring this time Kant was striving to work out an independent\nposition, but before the 1770s his views remained fluid.\n\nIn 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility\nof metaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature\nphilosophy. Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of\nMetaphysics, which he wrote soon after publishing a short\nEssay on Maladies of the Mind (1764), was occasioned by\nKant\u2019s fascination with the Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg\n(1688\u20131772), who claimed to have insight into a spirit world\nthat enabled him to make a series of apparently miraculous\npredictions. In this curious work Kant satirically compares\nSwedenborg\u2019s spirit-visions to the belief of rationalist\nmetaphysicians in an immaterial soul that survives death, and he\nconcludes that philosophical knowledge of either is impossible because\nhuman reason is limited to experience. The skeptical tone of Dreams is\ntempered, however, by Kant\u2019s suggestion that \u201cmoral\nfaith\u201d nevertheless supports belief in an immaterial and\nimmortal soul, even if it is not possible to attain metaphysical\nknowledge in this domain (2:373).\n\nIn 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in\nlogic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen\nyears as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a\nsublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the\nsame position in 1758. But later, as his reputation grew, he declined\nchairs in philosophy at Erlangen (1769) and Jena (1770) in hopes of\nobtaining one in K\u00f6nigsberg. After Kant was finally promoted, he\ngradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology\n(Kant\u2019s was the first such course in Germany and became very\npopular), rational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even\nmineralogy and military fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new\nposition, Kant also wrote one more Latin dissertation: Concerning\nthe Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World\n(1770), which is known as the Inaugural Dissertation.\n\nThe Inaugural Dissertation departs more radically from both\nWolffian rationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant\u2019s\nearlier work. Inspired by Crusius and the Swiss natural philosopher\nJohann Heinrich Lambert (1728\u20131777), Kant distinguishes between\ntwo fundamental powers of cognition, sensibility and understanding\n(intelligence), where the Leibniz-Wolffians regarded understanding\n(intellect) as the only fundamental power. Kant therefore rejects the\nrationalist view that sensibility is only a confused species of\nintellectual cognition, and he replaces this with his own view that\nsensibility is distinct from understanding and brings to perception\nits own subjective forms of space and time \u2013 a view that\ndeveloped out of Kant\u2019s earlier criticism of Leibniz\u2019s\nrelational view of space in Concerning the Ultimate Ground of the\nDifferentiation of Directions in Space (1768). Moreover, as the\ntitle of the Inaugural Dissertation indicates, Kant argues\nthat sensibility and understanding are directed at two different\nworlds: sensibility gives us access to the sensible world, while\nunderstanding enables us to grasp a distinct intelligible world. These\ntwo worlds are related in that what the understanding grasps in the\nintelligible world is the \u201cparadigm\u201d of \u201cNOUMENAL\nPERFECTION,\u201d which is \u201ca common measure for all other\nthings in so far as they are realities.\u201d Considered\ntheoretically, this intelligible paradigm of perfection is God;\nconsidered practically, it is \u201cMORAL PERFECTION\u201d (2:396).\nThe Inaugural Dissertation thus develops a form of Platonism;\nand it rejects the view of British sentimentalists that moral\njudgments are based on feelings of pleasure or pain, since Kant now\nholds that moral judgments are based on pure understanding alone.\n\nAfter 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and\nunderstanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time\nare subjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments\nare based on pure understanding (or reason) alone. But his embrace of\nPlatonism in the Inaugural Dissertation was short-lived. He\nsoon denied that our understanding is capable of insight into an\nintelligible world, which cleared the path toward his mature position\nin the Critique of Pure Reason (1781), according to which the\nunderstanding (like sensibility) supplies forms that structure our\nexperience of the sensible world, to which human knowledge is limited,\nwhile the intelligible (or noumenal) world is strictly unknowable to\nus. Kant spent a decade working on the Critique of Pure\nReason and published nothing else of significance between 1770\nand 1781. But its publication marked the beginning of another burst of\nactivity that produced Kant\u2019s most important and enduring works.\nBecause early reviews of the Critique of Pure Reason were few\nand (in Kant\u2019s judgment) uncomprehending, he tried to clarify\nits main points in the much shorter Prolegomena to Any Future\nMetaphysics That Will Be Able to Come Forward as a Science\n(1783). Among the major books that rapidly followed are the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Kant\u2019s\nmain work on the fundamental principle of morality; the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), his main\nwork on natural philosophy in what scholars call his critical period\n(1781\u20131798); the second and substantially revised edition of the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1787); the Critique of Practical\nReason (1788), a fuller discussion of topics in moral philosophy\nthat builds on (and in some ways revises) the Groundwork; and\nthe Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), which deals\nwith aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of\nimportant essays in this period, including Idea for a Universal\nHistory With a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784) and Conjectural\nBeginning of Human History (1786), his main contributions to the\nphilosophy of history; An Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment? (1784), which broaches some of the key ideas of\nhis later political essays; and What Does it Mean to Orient\nOneself in Thinking? (1786), Kant\u2019s intervention in the\npantheism controversy that raged in German intellectual circles after\nF. H. Jacobi (1743\u20131819) accused the recently deceased G. E.\nLessing (1729\u20131781) of Spinozism.\n\nWith these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate\nGerman philosophy in the late 1780s. But in 1790 he announced that the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment brought his critical\nenterprise to an end (5:170). By then K. L. Reinhold\n(1758\u20131823), whose Letters on the Kantian Philosophy\n(1786) popularized Kant\u2019s moral and religious ideas, had been\ninstalled (in 1787) in a chair devoted to Kantian philosophy at Jena,\nwhich was more centrally located than K\u00f6nigsberg and rapidly\ndeveloping into the focal point of the next phase in German\nintellectual history. Reinhold soon began to criticize and move away\nfrom Kant\u2019s views. In 1794 his chair at Jena passed to J. G.\nFichte, who had visited the master in K\u00f6nigsberg and whose first\nbook, Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation (1792), was\npublished anonymously and initially mistaken for a work by Kant\nhimself. This catapulted Fichte to fame, but soon he too moved away\nfrom Kant and developed an original position quite at odds with\nKant\u2019s, which Kant finally repudiated publicly in 1799\n(12:370\u2013371). Yet while German philosophy moved on to assess and\nrespond to Kant\u2019s legacy, Kant himself continued publishing\nimportant works in the 1790s. Among these are Religion Within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason (1793), which drew a censure from the\nPrussian King when Kant published the book after its second essay was\nrejected by the censor; The Conflict of the Faculties (1798),\na collection of essays inspired by Kant\u2019s troubles with the\ncensor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and\ntheological faculties of the university; On the Common Saying:\nThat May be Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice\n(1793), Toward Perpetual Peace (1795), and the Doctrine\nof Right, the first part of The Metaphysics of Morals\n(1797), Kant\u2019s main works in political philosophy; the\nDoctrine of Virtue, the second part of The Metaphysics of\nMorals (1797), Kant\u2019s most mature work in moral philosophy,\nwhich he had been planning for more than thirty years; and\nAnthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View (1798), based on\nKant\u2019s anthropology lectures. Several other compilations of\nKant\u2019s lecture notes from other courses were published later,\nbut these were not prepared by Kant himself.\n\nKant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had\nlived a highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his\nphilosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind\nonly in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a\ngap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural\nscience from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a\nseries of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric\nmatter. These notes, known as the Opus Postumum, remained\nunfinished and unpublished in Kant\u2019s lifetime, and scholars\ndisagree on their significance and relation to his earlier work. It is\nclear, however, that some of these late notes show unmistakable signs\nof Kant\u2019s mental decline, which became tragically precipitous\naround 1800. Kant died February 12, 1804, just short of his eightieth\nbirthday.\n2. Kant\u2019s project in the Critique of Pure Reason\n\nThe main topic of the Critique of Pure Reason is the\npossibility of metaphysics, understood in a specific way. Kant defines\nmetaphysics in terms of \u201cthe cognitions after which reason might\nstrive independently of all experience,\u201d and his goal in the\nbook is to reach a \u201cdecision about the possibility or\nimpossibility of a metaphysics in general, and the determination of\nits sources, as well as its extent and boundaries, all, however, from\nprinciples\u201d (Axii. See also Bxiv; and 4:255\u2013257). Thus\nmetaphysics for Kant concerns a priori knowledge, or knowledge whose\njustification does not depend on experience; and he associates a\npriori knowledge with reason. The project of the Critique is\nto examine whether, how, and to what extent human reason is capable of\na priori knowledge.\n2.1 The crisis of the Enlightenment\n\nTo understand the project of the Critique better, let us\nconsider the historical and intellectual context in which it was\n written.[5]\n Kant wrote the Critique toward the end of the Enlightenment,\nwhich was then in a state of crisis. Hindsight enables us to see that\nthe 1780\u2019s was a transitional decade in which the cultural\nbalance shifted decisively away from the Enlightenment toward\nRomanticism, but Kant did not have the benefit of such hindsight.\n\nThe Enlightenment was a reaction to the rise and successes of modern\nscience in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The spectacular\nachievements of Newton in particular engendered widespread confidence\nand optimism about the power of human reason to control nature and to\nimprove human life. One effect of this new confidence in reason was\nthat traditional authorities were increasingly questioned. Why should\nwe need political or religious authorities to tell us how to live or\nwhat to believe, if each of us has the capacity to figure these things\nout for ourselves? Kant expresses this Enlightenment commitment to the\nsovereignty of reason in the Critique:\n\nOur age is the age of criticism, to which everything must submit.\nReligion through its holiness and legislation through its majesty\ncommonly seek to exempt themselves from it. But in this way they\nexcite a just suspicion against themselves, and cannot lay claim to\nthat unfeigned respect that reason grants only to that which has been\nable to withstand its free and public examination. (Axi)\n\n\nEnlightenment is about thinking for oneself rather than letting others\nthink for you, according to What is Enlightenment? (8:35). In\nthis essay, Kant also expresses the Enlightenment faith in the\ninevitability of progress. A few independent thinkers will gradually\ninspire a broader cultural movement, which ultimately will lead to\ngreater freedom of action and governmental reform. A culture of\nenlightenment is \u201calmost inevitable\u201d if only there is\n\u201cfreedom to make public use of one\u2019s reason in all\nmatters\u201d (8:36).\n\nThe problem is that to some it seemed unclear whether progress would\nin fact ensue if reason enjoyed full sovereignty over traditional\nauthorities; or whether unaided reasoning would instead lead straight\nto materialism, fatalism, atheism, skepticism (Bxxxiv), or even\nlibertinism and authoritarianism (8:146). The Enlightenment commitment\nto the sovereignty of reason was tied to the expectation that it would\nnot lead to any of these consequences but instead would support\ncertain key beliefs that tradition had always sanctioned. Crucially,\nthese included belief in God, the soul, freedom, and the compatibility\nof science with morality and religion. Although a few intellectuals\nrejected some or all of these beliefs, the general spirit of the\nEnlightenment was not so radical. The Enlightenment was about\nreplacing traditional authorities with the authority of individual\nhuman reason, but it was not about overturning traditional moral and\nreligious beliefs.\n\nYet the original inspiration for the Enlightenment was the new\nphysics, which was mechanistic. If nature is entirely governed by\nmechanistic, causal laws, then it may seem that there is no room for\nfreedom, a soul, or anything but matter in motion. This threatened the\ntraditional view that morality requires freedom. We must be free in\norder to choose what is right over what is wrong, because otherwise we\ncannot be held responsible. It also threatened the traditional\nreligious belief in a soul that can survive death or be resurrected in\nan afterlife. So modern science, the pride of the Enlightenment, the\nsource of its optimism about the powers of human reason, threatened to\nundermine traditional moral and religious beliefs that free rational\nthought was expected to support. This was the main intellectual crisis\nof the Enlightenment. \n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason is Kant\u2019s response to this\ncrisis. Its main topic is metaphysics because, for Kant, metaphysics\nis the domain of reason \u2013 it is \u201cthe inventory of all we\npossess through pure reason, ordered systematically\u201d (Axx)\n\u2013 and the authority of reason was in question. Kant\u2019s main\ngoal is to show that a critique of reason by reason itself, unaided\nand unrestrained by traditional authorities, establishes a secure and\nconsistent basis for both Newtonian science and traditional morality\nand religion. In other words, free rational inquiry adequately\nsupports all of these essential human interests and shows them to be\nmutually consistent. So reason deserves the sovereignty attributed to\nit by the Enlightenment.\n2.2 Kant\u2019s Copernican revolution in philosophy\n\nTo see how Kant attempts to achieve this goal in the\nCritique, it helps to reflect on his grounds for rejecting\nthe Platonism of the Inaugural Dissertation. The\nInaugural Dissertation also tries to reconcile Newtonian\nscience with traditional morality and religion in a way, but its\nstrategy is different from that of the Critique. According to\nthe Inaugural Dissertation, Newtonian science is true of the\nsensible world, to which sensibility gives us access; and the\nunderstanding grasps principles of divine and moral perfection in a\ndistinct intelligible world, which are paradigms for measuring\neverything in the sensible world. So on this view our knowledge of the\nintelligible world is a priori because it does not depend on\nsensibility, and this a priori knowledge furnishes principles for\njudging the sensible world because in some way the sensible world\nitself conforms to or imitates the intelligible world.\n\nSoon after writing the Inaugural Dissertation, however, Kant\nexpressed doubts about this view. As he explained in a February 21,\n1772 letter to his friend and former student, Marcus Herz:\n\nIn my dissertation I was content to explain the nature of intellectual\nrepresentations in a merely negative way, namely, to state that they\nwere not modifications of the soul brought about by the object.\nHowever, I silently passed over the further question of how a\nrepresentation that refers to an object without being in any way\naffected by it can be possible\u2026. [B]y what means are these\n[intellectual representations] given to us, if not by the way in which\nthey affect us? And if such intellectual representations depend on our\ninner activity, whence comes the agreement that they are supposed to\nhave with objects \u2013 objects that are nevertheless not possibly\nproduced thereby?\u2026[A]s to how my understanding may form for\nitself concepts of things completely a priori, with which concepts the\nthings must necessarily agree, and as to how my understanding may\nformulate real principles concerning the possibility of such concepts,\nwith which principles experience must be in exact agreement and which\nnevertheless are independent of experience \u2013 this question, of\nhow the faculty of understanding achieves this conformity with the\nthings themselves, is still left in a state of obscurity.\n(10:130\u2013131)\n\n\nHere Kant entertains doubts about how a priori knowledge of an\nintelligible world would be possible. The position of the\nInaugural Dissertation is that the intelligible world is\nindependent of the human understanding and of the sensible world, both\nof which (in different ways) conform to the intelligible world. But,\nleaving aside questions about what it means for the sensible world to\nconform to an intelligible world, how is it possible for the human\nunderstanding to conform to or grasp an intelligible world? If the\nintelligible world is independent of our understanding, then it seems\nthat we could grasp it only if we are passively affected by it in some\nway. But for Kant sensibility is our passive or receptive capacity to\nbe affected by objects that are independent of us (2:392, A51/B75). So\nthe only way we could grasp an intelligible world that is independent\nof us is through sensibility, which means that our knowledge of it\ncould not be a priori. The pure understanding alone could at best\nenable us to form representations of an intelligible world. But since\nthese intellectual representations would entirely \u201cdepend on our\ninner activity,\u201d as Kant says to Herz, we have no good reason to\nbelieve that they would conform to an independent intelligible world.\nSuch a priori intellectual representations could well be figments of\nthe brain that do not correspond to anything independent of the human\nmind. In any case, it is completely mysterious how there might come to\nbe a correspondence between purely intellectual representations and an\nindependent intelligible world.\n\nKant\u2019s strategy in the Critique is similar to that of\nthe Inaugural Dissertation in that both works attempt to\nreconcile modern science with traditional morality and religion by\nrelegating them to distinct sensible and intelligible worlds,\nrespectively. But the Critique gives a far more modest and\nyet revolutionary account of a priori knowledge. As Kant\u2019s\nletter to Herz suggests, the main problem with his view in the\nInaugural Dissertation is that it tries to explain the\npossibility of a priori knowledge about a world that is entirely\nindependent of the human mind. This turned out to be a dead end, and\nKant never again maintained that we can have a priori knowledge about\nan intelligible world precisely because such a world would be entirely\nindependent of us. However, Kant\u2019s revolutionary position in the\nCritique is that we can have a priori knowledge about the\ngeneral structure of the sensible world because it is not entirely\nindependent of the human mind. The sensible world, or the world of\nappearances, is constructed by the human mind from a combination of\nsensory matter that we receive passively and a priori forms that are\nsupplied by our cognitive faculties. We can have a priori knowledge\nonly about aspects of the sensible world that reflect the a priori\nforms supplied by our cognitive faculties. In Kant\u2019s words,\n\u201cwe can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have\nput into them\u201d (Bxviii). So according to the Critique,\na priori knowledge is possible only if and to the extent that the\nsensible world itself depends on the way the human mind structures its\nexperience.\n\nKant characterizes this new constructivist view of experience in the\nCritique through an analogy with the revolution wrought by\nCopernicus in astronomy:\n\nUp to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to\nthe objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a\npriori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this\npresupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do\nnot get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the\nobjects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with\nthe requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is\nto establish something about objects before they are given to us. This\nwould be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did\nnot make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if\nhe assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the\nobserver, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made\nthe observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we\ncan try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. If\nintuition has to conform to the constitution of the objects, then I do\nnot see how we can know anything of them a priori; but if the object\n(as an object of the senses) conforms to the constitution of our\nfaculty of intuition, then I can very well represent this possibility\nto myself. Yet because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they\nare to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to\nsomething as their object and determine this object through them, I\ncan assume either that the concepts through which I bring about this\ndetermination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in\nthe same difficulty about how I could know anything about them a\npriori, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing,\nthe experience in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects)\nconforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an easier\nway out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of\ncognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose\nin myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which rule\nis expressed in concepts a priori, to which all objects of experience\nmust therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree.\n(Bxvi\u2013xviii)\n\n\nAs this passage suggests, what Kant has changed in the\nCritique is primarily his view about the role and powers of\nthe understanding, since he already held in the Inaugural\nDissertation that sensibility contributes the forms of space and\ntime \u2013 which he calls pure (or a priori) intuitions (2:397)\n\u2013 to our cognition of the sensible world. But the\nCritique claims that pure understanding too, rather than\ngiving us insight into an intelligible world, is limited to providing\nforms \u2013 which he calls pure or a priori concepts \u2013 that\nstructure our cognition of the sensible world. So now both sensibility\nand understanding work together to construct cognition of the sensible\nworld, which therefore conforms to the a priori forms that are\nsupplied by our cognitive faculties: the a priori intuitions of\nsensibility and the a priori concepts of the understanding. This\naccount is analogous to the heliocentric revolution of Copernicus in\nastronomy because both require contributions from the observer to be\nfactored into explanations of phenomena, although neither reduces\nphenomena to the contributions of observers\n alone.[6]\n The way celestial phenomena appear to us on earth, according to\nCopernicus, is affected by both the motions of celestial bodies and\nthe motion of the earth, which is not a stationary body around which\neverything else revolves. For Kant, analogously, the phenomena of\nhuman experience depend on both the sensory data that we receive\npassively through sensibility and the way our mind actively processes\nthis data according to its own a priori rules. These rules supply the\ngeneral framework in which the sensible world and all the objects (or\nphenomena) in it appear to us. So the sensible world and its phenomena\nare not entirely independent of the human mind, which contributes its\nbasic structure.\n\nHow does Kant\u2019s Copernican revolution in philosophy improve on\nthe strategy of the Inaugural Dissertation for reconciling\nmodern science with traditional morality and religion? First, it gives\nKant a new and ingenious way of placing modern science on an a priori\nfoundation. He is now in a position to argue that we can have a priori\nknowledge about the basic laws of modern science because those laws\nreflect the human mind\u2019s contribution to structuring our\nexperience. In other words, the sensible world necessarily conforms to\ncertain fundamental laws \u2013 such as that every event has a cause\n\u2013 because the human mind constructs it according to those laws.\nMoreover, we can identify those laws by reflecting on the conditions\nof possible experience, which reveals that it would be impossible for\nus to experience a world in which, for example, any given event fails\nto have a cause. From this Kant concludes that metaphysics is indeed\npossible in the sense that we can have a priori knowledge that the\nentire sensible world \u2013 not just our actual experience, but any\npossible human experience \u2013 necessarily conforms to certain\nlaws. Kant calls this immanent metaphysics or the metaphysics of\nexperience, because it deals with the essential principles that are\nimmanent to human experience.\n\nBut, second, if \u201cwe can cognize of things a priori only what we\nourselves have put into them,\u201d then we cannot have a priori\nknowledge about things whose existence and nature are entirely\nindependent of the human mind, which Kant calls things in themselves\n(Bxviii). In his words: \u201c[F]rom this deduction of our faculty of\ncognizing a priori [\u2026] there emerges a very strange result\n[\u2026], namely that with this faculty we can never get beyond the\nboundaries of possible experience, [\u2026and] that such cognition\nreaches appearances only, leaving the thing in itself as something\nactual for itself but uncognized by us\u201d (Bxix\u2013xx). That\nis, Kant\u2019s constructivist foundation for scientific knowledge\nrestricts science to the realm of appearances and implies that\ntranscendent metaphysics \u2013 i.e., a priori knowledge of things in\nthemselves that transcend possible human experience \u2013 is\nimpossible. In the Critique Kant thus rejects the insight\ninto an intelligible world that he defended in the Inaugural\nDissertation, and he now claims that rejecting knowledge about\nthings in themselves is necessary for reconciling science with\ntraditional morality and religion. This is because he claims that\nbelief in God, freedom, and immortality have a strictly moral basis,\nand yet adopting these beliefs on moral grounds would be unjustified\nif we could know that they were false. \u201cThus,\u201d Kant says,\n\u201cI had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith\u201d\n(Bxxx). Restricting knowledge to appearances and relegating God and\nthe soul to an unknowable realm of things in themselves guarantees\nthat it is impossible to disprove claims about God and the freedom or\nimmortality of the soul, which moral arguments may therefore justify\nus in believing. Moreover, the determinism of modern science no longer\nthreatens the freedom required by traditional morality, because\nscience and therefore determinism apply only to appearances, and there\nis room for freedom in the realm of things in themselves, where the\nself or soul is located. We cannot know (theoretically) that we are\nfree, because we cannot know anything about things in themselves. But\nthere are especially strong moral grounds for the belief in human\nfreedom, which acts as \u201cthe keystone\u201d supporting other\nmorally grounded beliefs (5:3\u20134). In this way, Kant replaces\ntranscendent metaphysics with a new practical science that he calls\nthe metaphysics of morals. It thus turns out that two kinds of\nmetaphysics are possible: the metaphysics of experience (or nature)\nand the metaphysics of morals, both of which depend on Kant\u2019s\nCopernican revolution in philosophy.\n3. Transcendental idealism\n\nPerhaps the central and most controversial thesis of the Critique\nof Pure Reason is that human beings experience only appearances,\nnot things in themselves; and that space and time are only subjective\nforms of human intuition that would not subsist in themselves if one\nwere to abstract from all subjective conditions of human intuition.\nKant calls this thesis transcendental\n idealism.[7]\n One of his best summaries of it is arguably the following:\n\nWe have therefore wanted to say that all our intuition is nothing but\nthe representation of appearance; that the things that we intuit are\nnot in themselves what we intuit them to be, nor are their relations\nso constituted in themselves as they appear to us; and that if we\nremove our own subject or even only the subjective constitution of the\nsenses in general, then all constitution, all relations of objects in\nspace and time, indeed space and time themselves would disappear, and\nas appearances they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What\nmay be the case with objects in themselves and abstracted from all\nthis receptivity of our sensibility remains entirely unknown to us. We\nare acquainted with nothing except our way of perceiving them, which\nis peculiar to us, and which therefore does not necessarily pertain to\nevery being, though to be sure it pertains to every human being. We\nare concerned solely with this. Space and time are its pure forms,\nsensation in general its matter. We can cognize only the former a\npriori, i.e., prior to all actual perception, and they are therefore\ncalled pure intuition; the latter, however, is that in our cognition\nthat is responsible for its being called a posteriori cognition, i.e.,\nempirical intuition. The former adheres to our sensibility absolutely\nnecessarily, whatever sort of sensations we may have; the latter can\nbe very different.\n (A42/B59\u201360)[8]\n\n\nKant introduces transcendental idealism in the part of the\nCritique called the Transcendental Aesthetic, and scholars\ngenerally agree that for Kant transcendental idealism encompasses at\nleast the following claims:\n\nIn some sense, human beings experience only appearances, not\nthings in themselves.\nSpace and time are not things in themselves, or determinations of\nthings in themselves that would remain if one abstracted from all\nsubjective conditions of human intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion\na) at A26/B42 and again at A32\u201333/B49. It is at least a crucial\npart of what he means by calling space and time transcendentally ideal\n(A28/B44, A35\u201336/B52)].\nSpace and time are nothing other than the subjective forms of\nhuman sensible intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion b) at A26/B42\nand again at A33/B49\u201350].\nSpace and time are empirically real, which means that\n\u201ceverything that can come before us externally as an\nobject\u201d is in both space and time, and that our internal\nintuitions of ourselves are in time (A28/B44,\nA34\u201335/B51\u201351).\n\n\nBut scholars disagree widely on how to interpret these claims, and\nthere is no such thing as the standard interpretation of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism. Two general types of interpretation have been\nespecially influential, however. This section provides an overview of\nthese two interpretations, although it should be emphasized that much\nimportant scholarship on transcendental idealism does not fall neatly\ninto either of these two camps.\n3.1 The two-objects interpretation\n\nThe two-objects reading is the traditional interpretation of\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism. It goes back to the earliest\nreview of the Critique \u2013 the so-called G\u00f6ttingen\nreview by Christian Garve (1742\u20131798) and J. G. Feder\n (1740\u20131821)[9]\n \u2013 and it was the dominant way of interpreting Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism during his own lifetime. It has been a live\ninterpretive option since then and remains so today, although it no\nlonger enjoys the dominance that it once\n did.[10]\n\nAccording to the two-objects interpretation, transcendental idealism\nis essentially a metaphysical thesis that distinguishes between two\nclasses of objects: appearances and things in themselves. Another name\nfor this view is the two-worlds interpretation, since it can also be\nexpressed by saying that transcendental idealism essentially\ndistinguishes between a world of appearances and another world of\nthings in themselves.\n\nThings in themselves, on this interpretation, are absolutely real in\nthe sense that they would exist and have whatever properties they have\neven if no human beings were around to perceive them. Appearances, on\nthe other hand, are not absolutely real in that sense, because their\nexistence and properties depend on human perceivers. Moreover,\nwhenever appearances do exist, in some sense they exist in the mind of\nhuman perceivers. So appearances are mental entities or mental\nrepresentations. This, coupled with the claim that we experience only\nappearances, makes transcendental idealism a form of phenomenalism on\nthis interpretation, because it reduces the objects of experience to\nmental representations. All of our experiences \u2013 all of our\nperceptions of objects and events in space, even those objects and\nevents themselves, and all non-spatial but still temporal thoughts and\nfeelings \u2013 fall into the class of appearances that exist in the\nmind of human perceivers. These appearances cut us off entirely from\nthe reality of things in themselves, which are non-spatial and\nnon-temporal. Yet Kant\u2019s theory, on this interpretation,\nnevertheless requires that things in themselves exist, because they\nmust transmit to us the sensory data from which we construct\nappearances. In principle we cannot know how things in themselves\naffect our senses, because our experience and knowledge is limited to\nthe world of appearances constructed by and in the mind. Things in\nthemselves are therefore a sort of theoretical posit, whose existence\nand role are required by the theory but are not directly\nverifiable.\n\nThe main problems with the two-objects interpretation are\nphilosophical. Most readers of Kant who have interpreted his\ntranscendental idealism in this way have been \u2013 often very\n\u2013 critical of it, for reasons such as the following:\n\nFirst, at best Kant is walking a fine line in claiming on the one hand\nthat we can have no knowledge about things in themselves, but on the\nother hand that we know that things in themselves exist, that they\naffect our senses, and that they are non-spatial and non-temporal. At\nworst his theory depends on contradictory claims about what we can and\ncannot know about things in themselves. This objection was\ninfluentially articulated by Jacobi, when he complained that\n\u201cwithout that presupposition [of things in themselves] I could\nnot enter into the system, but with it I could not stay within\nit\u201d (Jacobi 1787, 336).\n\nSecond, even if that problem is surmounted, it has seemed to many that\nKant\u2019s theory, interpreted in this way, implies a radical form\nof skepticism that traps each of us within the contents of our own\nmind and cuts us off from reality. Some versions of this objection\nproceed from premises that Kant rejects. One version maintains that\nthings in themselves are real while appearances are not, and hence\nthat on Kant\u2019s view we cannot have experience or knowledge of\nreality. But Kant denies that appearances are unreal: they are just as\nreal as things in themselves but are in a different metaphysical\nclass. Another version claims that truth always involves a\ncorrespondence between mental representations and things in\nthemselves, from which it would follow that on Kant\u2019s view it is\nimpossible for us to have true beliefs about the world. But just as\nKant denies that things in themselves are the only (or privileged)\nreality, he also denies that correspondence with things in themselves\nis the only kind of truth. Empirical judgments are true just in case\nthey correspond with their empirical objects in accordance with the a\npriori principles that structure all possible human experience. But\nthe fact that Kant can appeal in this way to an objective criterion of\nempirical truth that is internal to our experience has not been enough\nto convince some critics that Kant is innocent of an unacceptable form\nof skepticism, mainly because of his insistence on our irreparable\nignorance about things in themselves.\n\nThird and finally, Kant\u2019s denial that things in themselves are\nspatial or temporal has struck many of his readers as incoherent. The\nrole of things in themselves, on the two-object interpretation, is to\naffect our senses and thereby to provide the sensory data from which\nour cognitive faculties construct appearances within the framework of\nour a priori intuitions of space and time and a priori concepts such\nas causality. But if there is no space, time, change, or causation in\nthe realm of things in themselves, then how can things in themselves\naffect us? Transcendental affection seems to involve a causal relation\nbetween things in themselves and our sensibility. If this is simply\nthe way we unavoidably think about transcendental affection, because\nwe can give positive content to this thought only by employing the\nconcept of a cause, while it is nevertheless strictly false that\nthings in themselves affect us causally, then it seems not only that\nwe are ignorant of how things in themselves really affect us. It\nseems, rather, to be incoherent that things in themselves could affect\nus at all if they are not in space or time.\n3.2 The two-aspects interpretation\n\nThe two-aspects reading attempts to interpret Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism in a way that enables it to be defended\nagainst at least some of these objections. On this view,\ntranscendental idealism does not distinguish between two classes of\nobjects but rather between two different aspects of one and the same\nclass of objects. For this reason it is also called the one-world\ninterpretation, since it holds that there is only one world in\nKant\u2019s ontology, and that at least some objects in that world\nhave two different aspects: one aspect that appears to us, and another\naspect that does not appear to us. That is, appearances are aspects of\nthe same objects that also exist in themselves. So, on this reading,\nappearances are not mental representations, and transcendental\nidealism is not a form of\n phenomenalism.[11]\n\nThere are at least two main versions of the two-aspects theory. One\nversion treats transcendental idealism as a metaphysical theory\naccording to which objects have two aspects in the sense that they\nhave two sets of properties: one set of relational properties that\nappear to us and are spatial and temporal, and another set of\nintrinsic properties that do not appear to us and are not spatial or\ntemporal (Langton 1998). This property-dualist interpretation faces\nepistemological objections similar to those faced by the two-objects\ninterpretation, because we are in no better position to acquire\nknowledge about properties that do not appear to us than we are to\nacquire knowledge about objects that do not appear to us. Moreover,\nthis interpretation also seems to imply that things in themselves are\nspatial and temporal, since appearances have spatial and temporal\nproperties, and on this view appearances are the same objects as\nthings in themselves. But Kant explicitly denies that space and time\nare properties of things in themselves.\n\nA second version of the two-aspects theory departs more radically from\nthe traditional two-objects interpretation by denying that\ntranscendental idealism is at bottom a metaphysical theory. Instead,\nit interprets transcendental idealism as a fundamentally\nepistemological theory that distinguishes between two standpoints on\nthe objects of experience: the human standpoint, from which objects\nare viewed relative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human\ncognitive faculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible\nintuition); and the standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which\nthe same objects could be known in themselves and independently of any\nepistemic conditions (Allison 2004). Human beings cannot really take\nup the latter standpoint but can form only an empty concept of things\nas they exist in themselves by abstracting from all the content of our\nexperience and leaving only the purely formal thought of an object in\ngeneral. So transcendental idealism, on this interpretation, is\nessentially the thesis that we are limited to the human standpoint,\nand the concept of a thing in itself plays the role of enabling us to\nchart the boundaries of the human standpoint by stepping beyond them\nin abstract (but empty) thought.\n\nOne criticism of this epistemological version of the two-aspects\ntheory is that it avoids the objections to other interpretations by\nattributing to Kant a more limited project than the text of the\nCritique warrants. There are passages that support this\n reading.[12]\n But there are also many passages in both editions of the\nCritique in which Kant describes appearances as\nrepresentations in the mind and in which his distinction between\nappearances and things in themselves is given not only epistemological\nbut metaphysical\n significance.[13]\n It is unclear whether all of these texts admit of a single,\nconsistent interpretation. \n4. The transcendental deduction\n\nThe transcendental deduction is the central argument of the\nCritique of Pure Reason and one of the most complex and\ndifficult texts in the history of philosophy. Given its complexity,\nthere are naturally many different ways of interpreting the\n deduction.[14]\n This brief overview provides one perspective on some of its main\nideas.\n\nThe transcendental deduction occurs in the part of the\nCritique called the Analytic of Concepts, which deals with\nthe a priori concepts that, on Kant\u2019s view, our understanding\nuses to construct experience together with the a priori forms of our\nsensible intuition (space and time), which he discussed in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic. Kant calls these a priori concepts\n\u201ccategories,\u201d and he argues elsewhere (in the so-called\nmetaphysical deduction) that they include such concepts as substance\nand cause. The goal of the transcendental deduction is to show that we\nhave a priori concepts or categories that are objectively valid, or\nthat apply necessarily to all objects in the world that we experience.\nTo show this, Kant argues that the categories are necessary conditions\nof experience, or that we could not have experience without the\ncategories. In Kant\u2019s words:\n\n[T]he objective validity of the categories, as a priori concepts,\nrests on the fact that through them alone is experience possible (as\nfar as the form of thinking is concerned). For they then are related\nnecessarily and a priori to objects of experience, since only by means\nof them can any object of experience be thought at all.\n\n\nThe transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a\nprinciple toward which the entire investigation must be directed,\nnamely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is\nencountered in them, or of the thinking). Concepts that supply the\nobjective ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just\nfor that reason. (A93\u201394/B126)\n\n\nThe strategy Kant employs to argue that the categories are conditions\nof experience is the main source of both the obscurity and the\ningenuity of the transcendental deduction. His strategy is to argue\nthat the categories are necessary specifically for self-consciousness,\nfor which Kant often uses the Leibnizian term\n\u201capperception.\u201d\n4.1 Self-consciousness\n\nOne way to approach Kant\u2019s argument is to contrast his view of\nself-consciousness with two alternative views that he rejects. Each of\nthese views, both Kant\u2019s and those he rejects, can be seen as\noffering competing answers the question: what is the source of our\nsense of an ongoing and invariable self that persists throughout all\nthe changes in our experience?\n\nThe first answer to this question that Kant rejects is that\nself-consciousness arises from some particular content being present\nin each of one\u2019s representations. This material conception of\nself-consciousness, as we may call it, is suggested by Locke\u2019s\naccount of personal identity. According to Locke, \u201cit being the\nsame consciousness that makes a Man be himself to himself, personal\nIdentity depends on that only, whether it be annexed only to one\nindividual Substance, or can be continued in a succession of several\nSubstances\u201d (Essay 2.27.10). What Locke calls\n\u201cthe same consciousness\u201d may be understood as some\nrepresentational content that is always present in my experience and\nthat both identifies any experience as mine and gives me a sense of a\ncontinuous self by virtue of its continual presence in my experience.\nOne problem with this view, Kant believes, is that there is no such\nrepresentational content that is invariably present in experience, so\nthe sense of an ongoing self cannot possibly arise from that\nnon-existent content (what Locke calls \u201cconsciousness\u201d)\nbeing present in each of one\u2019s representations. In Kant\u2019s\nwords, self-consciousness \u201cdoes not yet come about by my\naccompanying each representation with consciousness, but rather by my\nadding one representation to the other and being conscious of their\nsynthesis. Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of\ngiven representations in one consciousness that it is possible for me\nto represent the identity of the consciousness in these\nrepresentations\u201d (B133). Here Kant claims, against the Lockean\nview, that self-consciousness arises from combining (or synthesizing)\nrepresentations with one another regardless of their content. In\nshort, Kant has a formal conception of self-consciousness rather than\na material one. Since no particular content of my experience is\ninvariable, self-consciousness must derive from my experience having\nan invariable form or structure, and consciousness of the identity of\nmyself through all of my changing experiences must consist in\nawareness of the formal unity and law-governed regularity of my\nexperience. The continuous form of my experience is the necessary\ncorrelate for my sense of a continuous self.\n\nThere are at least two possible versions of the formal conception of\nself-consciousness: a realist and an idealist version. On the realist\nversion, nature itself is law-governed and we become self-conscious by\nattending to its law-governed regularities, which also makes this an\nempiricist view of self-consciousness. The idea of an identical self\nthat persists throughout all of our experience, on this view, arises\nfrom the law-governed regularity of nature, and our representations\nexhibit order and regularity because reality itself is ordered and\nregular. Kant rejects this realist view and embraces a conception of\nself-consciousness that is both formal and idealist. According to\nKant, the formal structure of our experience, its unity and\nlaw-governed regularity, is an achievement of our cognitive faculties\nrather than a property of reality in itself. Our experience has a\nconstant form because our mind constructs experience in a law-governed\nway. So self-consciousness, for Kant, consists in awareness of the\nmind\u2019s law-governed activity of synthesizing or combining\nsensible data to construct a unified experience. As he expresses it,\n\u201cthis unity of consciousness would be impossible if in the\ncognition of the manifold the mind could not become conscious of the\nidentity of the function by means of which this manifold is\nsynthetically combined into one cognition\u201d (A108).\n\nKant argues for this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,\nand against the formal realist view, on the grounds that \u201cwe can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves\u201d (B130). In other words, even if reality\nin itself were law-governed, its laws could not simply migrate over to\nour mind or imprint themselves on us while our mind is entirely\npassive. We must exercise an active capacity to represent the world as\ncombined or ordered in a law-governed way, because otherwise we could\nnot represent the world as law-governed even if it were law-governed\nin itself. Moreover, this capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed must be a priori because it is a condition of\nself-consciousness, and we would already have to be self-conscious in\norder to learn from our experience that there are law-governed\nregularities in the world. So it is necessary for self-consciousness\nthat we exercise an a priori capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed. But this would also be sufficient for self-consciousness\nif we could exercise our a priori capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed even if reality in itself were not law-governed. In that\ncase, the realist and empiricist conception of self-consciousness\nwould be false, and the formal idealist view would be true.\n\nKant\u2019s confidence that no empiricist account could possibly\nexplain self-consciousness may be based on his assumption that the\nsense of self each of us has, the thought of oneself as identical\nthroughout all of one\u2019s changing experiences, involves necessity\nand universality, which on his view are the hallmarks of the a priori.\nThis assumption is reflected in what we may call Kant\u2019s\nprinciple of apperception: \u201cThe I think must be\nable to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something\nwould be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is\nas much as to say that the representation would either be impossible\nor else at least would be nothing for me\u201d\n (B131\u2013132).[15]\n Notice the claims about necessity and universality embodied in the\nwords \u201cmust\u201d and \u201call\u201d here. Kant is saying\nthat for a representation to count as mine, it must necessarily be\naccessible to conscious awareness in some (perhaps indirect) way: I\nmust be able to accompany it with \u201cI think\u2026.\u201d All\nof my representations must be accessible to consciousness in this way\n(but they need not actually be conscious), because again that is\nsimply what makes a representation count as mine. Self-consciousness\nfor Kant therefore involves a priori knowledge about the necessary and\nuniversal truth expressed in this principle of apperception, and a\npriori knowledge cannot be based on experience.\n\nKant may have developed this thread of his argument in the\ntranscendental deduction after reading Johann Nicolaus Tetens\n(1736\u20131807) rather than through a direct encounter with\nLocke\u2019s texts (Tetens 1777, Kitcher 2011). On the subject of\nself-consciousness, Tetens was a follower of Locke and also engaged\nwith Hume\u2019s arguments for rejecting a continuing self. So\nKant\u2019s actual opponents in the deduction may have been Lockean\nand Humean positions as represented by Tetens, as well as rationalist\nviews that Kant would have encountered directly in texts by Leibniz,\nWolff, and some of their followers.\n4.2 Objectivity and judgment\n\nOn the basis of this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,\nKant\u2019s argument (at least one central thread of it) moves\nthrough two more conditions of self-consciousness in order to\nestablish the objective validity of the categories. The next condition\nis that self-consciousness requires me to represent an objective world\ndistinct from my subjective representations \u2013 that is, distinct\nfrom my thoughts about and sensations of that objective world. Kant\nuses this connection between self-consciousness and objectivity to\ninsert the categories into his argument.\n\nIn order to be self-conscious, I cannot be wholly absorbed in the\ncontents of my perceptions but must distinguish myself from the rest\nof the world. But if self-consciousness is an achievement of the mind,\nthen how does the mind achieve this sense that there is a distinction\nbetween the I that perceives and the contents of its perceptions?\nAccording to Kant, the mind achieves this sense by distinguishing\nrepresentations that necessarily belong together from representations\nthat are not necessarily connected but are merely associated in a\ncontingent way. Consider Kant\u2019s example of the perception of a\nhouse (B162). Imagine a house that is too large to fit into your\nvisual field from your vantage point near its front door. Now imagine\nthat you walk around the house, successively perceiving each of its\nsides. Eventually you perceive the entire house, but not all at once,\nand you judge that each of your representations of the sides of the\nhouse necessarily belong together (as sides of one house) and that\nanyone who denied this would be mistaken. But now imagine that you\ngrew up in this house and associate a feeling of nostalgia with it.\nYou would not judge that representations of this house are necessarily\nconnected with feelings of nostalgia. That is, you would not think\nthat other people seeing the house for the first time would be\nmistaken if they denied that it is connected with nostalgia, because\nyou recognize that this house is connected with nostalgia for you but\nnot necessarily for everyone. Yet you distinguish this merely\nsubjective connection from the objective connection between sides of\nthe house, which is objective because the sides of the house\nnecessarily belong together \u201cin the object,\u201d because this\nconnection holds for everyone universally, and because it is possible\nto be mistaken about it. The point here is not that we must\nsuccessfully identify which representations necessarily belong\ntogether and which are merely associated contingently, but rather that\nto be self-conscious we must at least make this general distinction\nbetween objective and merely subjective connections of\nrepresentations.\n\nAt this point (at least in the second edition text) Kant introduces\nthe key claim that judgment is what enables us to distinguish\nobjective connections of representations that necessarily belong\ntogether from merely subjective and contingent associations:\n\u201c[A] judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given\ncognitions to the objective unity of apperception. That is the aim of\nthe copula is in them: to distinguish the objective unity of\ngiven representations from the subjective. For this word designates\nthe relation of the representations to the original apperception and\nits necessary unity\u201d (B141\u2013142). Kant is speaking here\nabout the mental act of judging that results in the formation of a\njudgment. Judging is an act of what Kant calls synthesis, which he\ndefines as \u201cthe action of putting different representations\ntogether with each other and comprehending their manifoldness in one\ncognition\u201d (A77/B103). In other words, to synthesize is in\ngeneral to combine several representations into a single (more)\ncomplex representation, and to judge is specifically to combine\nconcepts into a judgment \u2013 that is, to join a subject concept to\na predicate concept by means of the copula, as in \u201cthe body is\nheavy\u201d or \u201cthe house is four-sided.\u201d Judgments need\nnot be true, of course, but they always have a truth value (true or\nfalse) because they make claims to objective validity. When I say, by\ncontrast, that \u201cIf I carry a body, I feel a pressure of\nweight,\u201d or that \u201cif I see this house, I feel\nnostalgia,\u201d I am not making a judgment about the object (the\nbody or the house) but rather I am expressing a subjective association\nthat may apply only to me\n (B142).[16]\n\nKant\u2019s reference to the necessary unity of apperception or\nself-consciousness in the quotation above means (at least) that the\naction of judging is the way our mind achieves self-consciousness. We\nmust represent an objective world in order to distinguish ourselves\nfrom it, and we represent an objective world by judging that some\nrepresentations necessarily belong together. Moreover, recall from\n 4.1\n that, for Kant, we must have an a priori capacity to represent the\nworld as law-governed, because \u201cwe can represent nothing as\ncombined (or connected) in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves\u201d (B130). It follows that objective\nconnections in the world cannot simply imprint themselves on our mind.\nRather, experience of an objective world must be constructed by\nexercising an a priori capacity to judge, which Kant calls the faculty\nof understanding (A80\u201381/B106). The understanding constructs\nexperience by providing the a priori rules, or the framework of\nnecessary laws, in accordance with which we judge representations to\nbe objective. These rules are the pure concepts of the understanding\nor categories, which are therefore conditions of self-consciousness,\nsince they are rules for judging about an objective world, and\nself-consciousness requires that we distinguish ourselves from an\nobjective world.\n\nKant identifies the categories in what he calls the metaphysical\ndeduction, which precedes the transcendental\n deduction.[17]\n Very briefly, since the categories are a priori rules for judging,\nKant argues that an exhaustive table of categories can be derived from\na table of the basic logical forms of judgments. For example,\naccording to Kant the logical form of the judgment that \u201cthe\nbody is heavy\u201d would be singular, affirmative, categorical, and\nassertoric. But since categories are not mere logical functions but\ninstead are rules for making judgments about objects or an objective\nworld, Kant arrives at his table of categories by considering how each\nlogical function would structure judgments about objects (within our\nspatio-temporal forms of intuition). For example, he claims that\ncategorical judgments express a logical relation between subject and\npredicate that corresponds to the ontological relation between\nsubstance and accident; and the logical form of a hypothetical\njudgment expresses a relation that corresponds to cause and effect.\nTaken together with this argument, then, the transcendental deduction\nargues that we become self-conscious by representing an objective\nworld of substances that interact according to causal laws.\n4.3 The law-giver of nature\n\nThe final condition of self-consciousness that Kant adds to the\npreceding conditions is that our understanding must cooperate with\nsensibility to construct one, unbounded, and unified space-time to\nwhich all of our representations may be related. \n\nTo see why this further condition is required, consider that so far we\nhave seen why Kant holds that we must represent an objective world in\norder to be self-conscious, but we could represent an objective world\neven if it were not possible to relate all of our representations to\nthis objective world. For all that has been said so far, we might\nstill have unruly representations that we cannot relate in any way to\nthe objective framework of our experience. On Kant\u2019s view, this\nwould be a problem because, as we have seen, he holds that\nself-consciousness involves universality and necessity: according to\nhis principle of apperception, \u201cthe I think must be\nable to accompany all my representations\u201d (B131). Yet if, on\nthe one hand, I had representations that I could not relate in some\nway to an objective world, then I could not accompany those\nrepresentations with \u201cI think\u201d or recognize them as my\nrepresentations, because I can say \u201cI think\u2026\u201d about\nany given representation only by relating it to an objective world,\naccording to the argument just discussed. So I must be able to relate\nany given representation to an objective world in order for it to\ncount as mine. On the other hand, self-consciousness would also be\nimpossible if I represented multiple objective worlds, even if I could\nrelate all of my representations to some objective world or other. In\nthat case, I could not become conscious of an identical self that has,\nsay, representation 1 in space-time A and representation 2 in\nspace-time B. It may be possible to imagine disjointed spaces and\ntimes, but it is not possible to represent them as objectively real.\nSo self-consciousness requires that I can relate all of my\nrepresentations to a single objective world.\n\nThe reason why I must represent this one objective world by means of a\nunified and unbounded space-time is that, as Kant argued in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, space and time are the pure forms of human\nintuition. If we had different forms of intuition, then our experience\nwould still have to constitute a unified whole in order for us to be\nself-conscious, but this would not be a spatio-temporal whole. Given\nthat space and time are our forms of intuition, however, our\nunderstanding must still cooperate with sensibility to construct a\nspatio-temporal whole of experience because, once again, \u201cwe can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves,\u201d and \u201call combination [\u2026] is\nan action of the understanding\u201d (B130). So Kant distinguishes\nbetween space and time as pure forms of intuition, which belong solely\nto sensibility; and the formal intuitions of space and time (or\nspace-time), which are unified by the understanding (B160\u2013161).\nThese formal intuitions are the spatio-temporal whole within which our\nunderstanding constructs experience in accordance with the\n categories.[18]\n\nThe most important implication of Kant\u2019s claim that the\nunderstanding constructs a single whole of experience to which all of\nour representations can be related is that, since he defines nature\n\u201cregarded materially\u201d as \u201cthe sum total of all\nappearances\u201d and he has argued that the categories are\nobjectively valid of all possible appearances, on his view it follows\nthat our categories are the source of the fundamental laws of nature\n\u201cregarded formally\u201d (B163, 165). So Kant concludes on this\nbasis that the understanding is the true law-giver of nature. In his\nwords: \u201call appearances in nature, as far as their combination\nis concerned, stand under the categories, on which nature (considered\nmerely as nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its\nnecessary lawfulness (as nature regarded formally)\u201d (B165). Or\nmore strongly: \u201cwe ourselves bring into the appearances that\norder and regularity that we call nature, and moreover we would\nnot be able to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not\noriginally put it there. [\u2026] The understanding is thus not\nmerely a faculty for making rules through the comparison of the\nappearances: it is itself the legislation for nature, i.e., without\nunderstanding there would not be any nature at all\u201d\n(A125\u2013126). \n5. Morality and freedom\n\nHaving examined two central parts of Kant\u2019s positive project in\ntheoretical philosophy from the Critique of Pure Reason,\ntranscendental idealism and the transcendental deduction, let us now\nturn to his practical philosophy in the Critique of Practical\nReason. Since Kant\u2019s philosophy is deeply systematic, this\nsection begins with a preliminary look at how his theoretical and\npractical philosophy fit together (see also section\n 7).\n5.1 Theoretical and practical autonomy\n\nThe fundamental idea of Kant\u2019s philosophy is human autonomy. So\nfar we have seen this in Kant\u2019s constructivist view of\nexperience, according to which our understanding is the source of the\ngeneral laws of nature. \u201cAutonomy\u201d literally means giving\nthe law to oneself, and on Kant\u2019s view our understanding\nprovides laws that constitute the a priori framework of our\nexperience. Our understanding does not provide the matter or content\nof our experience, but it does provide the basic formal structure\nwithin which we experience any matter received through our senses.\nKant\u2019s central argument for this view is the transcendental\ndeduction, according to which it is a condition of self-consciousness\nthat our understanding constructs experience in this way. So we may\ncall self-consciousness the highest principle of Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy, since it is (at least) the basis for all of\nour a priori knowledge about the structure of nature.\n\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy is also based on the idea of autonomy.\nHe holds that there is a single fundamental principle of morality, on\nwhich all specific moral duties are based. He calls this moral law (as\nit is manifested to us) the categorical imperative (see\n 5.4).\n The moral law is a product of reason, for Kant, while the basic laws\nof nature are products of our understanding. There are important\ndifferences between the senses in which we are autonomous in\nconstructing our experience and in morality. For example, Kant regards\nunderstanding and reason as different cognitive faculties, although he\nsometimes uses \u201creason\u201d in a wide sense to cover\n both.[19]\n The categories and therefore the laws of nature are dependent on our\nspecifically human forms of intuition, while reason is not. The moral\nlaw does not depend on any qualities that are peculiar to human nature\nbut only on the nature of reason as such, although its manifestation\nto us as a categorical imperative (as a law of duty) reflects the fact\nthat the human will is not necessarily determined by pure reason but\nis also influenced by other incentives rooted in our needs and\ninclinations; and our specific duties deriving from the categorical\nimperative do reflect human nature and the contingencies of human\nlife. Despite these differences, however, Kant holds that we give the\nmoral law to ourselves, as we also give the general laws of nature to\nourselves, though in a different sense. Moreover, we each necessarily\ngive the same moral law to ourselves, just as we each construct our\nexperience in accordance with the same categories. To summarize:\n\nTheoretical philosophy is about how the world is (A633/B661). Its\nhighest principle is self-consciousness, on which our knowledge of the\nbasic laws of nature is based. Given sensory data, our understanding\nconstructs experience according to these a priori laws.\nPractical philosophy is about how the world ought to be (ibid.,\nA800\u2013801/B828\u2013829). Its highest principle is the moral\nlaw, from which we derive duties that command how we ought to act in\nspecific situations. Kant also claims that reflection on our moral\nduties and our need for happiness leads to the thought of an ideal\nworld, which he calls the highest good (see section\n 6).\n Given how the world is (theoretical philosophy) and how it ought to\nbe (practical philosophy), we aim to make the world better by\nconstructing or realizing the highest good.\n\n\nSo both parts of Kant\u2019s philosophy are about autonomously\nconstructing a world, but in different senses. In theoretical\nphilosophy, we use our categories and forms of intuition to construct\na world of experience or nature. In practical philosophy, we use the\nmoral law to construct the idea of a moral world or a realm of ends\nthat guides our conduct (4:433), and ultimately to transform the\nnatural world into the highest good. Finally, transcendental idealism\nis the framework within which these two parts of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy fit together (20:311). Theoretical philosophy deals with\nappearances, to which our knowledge is strictly limited; and practical\nphilosophy deals with things in themselves, although it does not give\nus knowledge about things in themselves but only provides rational\njustification for certain beliefs about them for practical\npurposes.\n\nTo understand Kant\u2019s arguments that practical philosophy\njustifies certain beliefs about things in themselves, it is necessary\nto see them in the context of his criticism of German rationalist\nmetaphysics. The three traditional topics of Leibniz-Wolffian special\nmetaphysics were rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational\ntheology, which dealt, respectively, with the human soul, the\nworld-whole, and God. In the part of the Critique of Pure Reason\ncalled the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant argues against the\nLeibniz-Wolffian view that human beings are capable of a priori\nknowledge in each of these domains, and he claims that the errors of\nLeibniz-Wolffian metaphysics are due to an illusion that has its seat\nin the nature of human reason itself. According to Kant, human reason\nnecessarily produces ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God; and\nthese ideas unavoidably produce the illusion that we have a priori\nknowledge about transcendent objects corresponding to them. This is an\nillusion, however, because in fact we are not capable of a priori\nknowledge about any such transcendent objects. Nevertheless, Kant\nattempts to show that these illusory ideas have a positive, practical\nuse. He thus reframes Leibniz-Wolffian special metaphysics as a\npractical science that he calls the metaphysics of morals. On\nKant\u2019s view, our ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God\nprovide the content of morally justified beliefs about human\nimmortality, human freedom, and the existence of God, respectively;\nbut they are not proper objects of speculative\n knowledge.[20]\n5.2 Freedom\n\nThe most important belief about things in themselves that Kant thinks\nonly practical philosophy can justify concerns human freedom. Freedom\nis important because, on Kant\u2019s view, moral appraisal\npresupposes that we are free in the sense that we have the ability to\ndo otherwise. To see why, consider Kant\u2019s example of a man who\ncommits a theft (5:95ff.). Kant holds that in order for this\nman\u2019s action to be morally wrong, it must have been within his\ncontrol in the sense that it was within his power at the time not to\nhave committed the theft. If this was not within his control at the\ntime, then, while it may be useful to punish him in order to shape his\nbehavior or to influence others, it nevertheless would not be correct\nto say that his action was morally wrong. Moral rightness and\nwrongness apply only to free agents who control their actions and have\nit in their power, at the time of their actions, either to act rightly\nor not. According to Kant, this is just common sense.\n\nOn these grounds, Kant rejects a type of compatibilism that he calls\nthe \u201ccomparative concept of freedom\u201d and associates with\nLeibniz (5:96\u201397). (Note that Kant has a specific type of\ncompatibilism in mind, which I will refer to simply as\n\u201ccompatibilism,\u201d although there may be other types of\ncompatibilism that do not fit Kant\u2019s characterization of that\nview). On the compatibilist view, as Kant understands it, I am free\nwhenever the cause of my action is within me. So I am unfree only when\nsomething external to me pushes or moves me, but I am free whenever\nthe proximate cause of my body\u2019s movement is internal to me as\nan \u201cacting being\u201d (5:96). If we distinguish between\ninvoluntary convulsions and voluntary bodily movements, then on this\nview free actions are just voluntary bodily movements. Kant ridicules\nthis view as a \u201cwretched subterfuge\u201d that tries to solve\nan ancient philosophical problem \u201cwith a little quibbling about\nwords\u201d (ibid.). This view, he says, assimilates human freedom to\n\u201cthe freedom of a turnspit,\u201d or a projectile in flight, or\nthe motion of a clock\u2019s hands (5:96\u201397). The proximate\ncauses of these movements are internal to the turnspit, the\nprojectile, and the clock at the time of the movement. This cannot be\nsufficient for moral responsibility.\n\nWhy not? The reason, Kant says, is ultimately that the causes of these\nmovements occur in time. Return to the theft example. A compatibilist\nwould say that the thief\u2019s action is free because its proximate\ncause is inside him, and because the theft was not an involuntary\nconvulsion but a voluntary action. The thief decided to commit the\ntheft, and his action flowed from this decision. According to Kant,\nhowever, if the thief\u2019s decision is a natural phenomenon that\noccurs in time, then it must be the effect of some cause that occurred\nin a previous time. This is an essential part of Kant\u2019s\nNewtonian worldview and is grounded in the a priori laws\n(specifically, the category of cause and effect) in accordance with\nwhich our understanding constructs experience: every event has a cause\nthat begins in an earlier time. If that cause too was an event\noccurring in time, then it must also have a cause beginning in a still\nearlier time, etc. All natural events occur in time and are thoroughly\ndetermined by causal chains that stretch backwards into the distant\npast. So there is no room for freedom in nature, which is\ndeterministic in a strong sense.\n\nThe root of the problem, for Kant, is time. Again, if the\nthief\u2019s choice to commit the theft is a natural event in time,\nthen it is the effect of a causal chain extending into the distant\npast. But the past is out of his control now, in the present. Once the\npast is past, he can\u2019t change it. On Kant\u2019s view, that is\nwhy his actions would not be in his control in the present if they are\ndetermined by events in the past. Even if he could control those past\nevents in the past, he cannot control them now. But in fact past\nevents were not in his control in the past either if they too were\ndetermined by events in the more distant past, because eventually the\ncausal antecedents of his action stretch back before his birth, and\nobviously events that occurred before his birth were never in his\ncontrol. So if the thief\u2019s choice to commit the theft is a\nnatural event in time, then it is not now and never was in his\ncontrol, and he could not have done otherwise than to commit the\ntheft. In that case, it would be a mistake to hold him morally\nresponsible for it.\n\nCompatibilism, as Kant understands it, therefore locates the issue in\nthe wrong place. Even if the cause of my action is internal to me, if\nit is in the past \u2013 for example, if my action today is\ndetermined by a decision I made yesterday, or from the character I\ndeveloped in childhood \u2013 then it is not within my control now.\nThe real issue is not whether the cause of my action is internal or\nexternal to me, but whether it is in my control now. For Kant,\nhowever, the cause of my action can be within my control now only if\nit is not in time. This is why Kant thinks that transcendental\nidealism is the only way to make sense of the kind of freedom that\nmorality requires. Transcendental idealism allows that the cause of my\naction may be a thing in itself outside of time: namely, my noumenal\nself, which is free because it is not part of nature. No matter what\nkind of character I have developed or what external influences act on\nme, on Kant\u2019s view all of my intentional, voluntary actions are\nimmediate effects of my noumenal self, which is causally undetermined\n(5:97\u201398). My noumenal self is an uncaused cause outside of\ntime, which therefore is not subject to the deterministic laws of\nnature in accordance with which our understanding constructs\nexperience.\n\nMany puzzles arise on this picture that Kant does not resolve. For\nexample, if my understanding constructs all appearances in my\nexperience of nature, not only appearances of my own actions, then why\nam I responsible only for my own actions but not for everything that\nhappens in the natural world? Moreover, if I am not alone in the world\nbut there are many noumenal selves acting freely and incorporating\ntheir free actions into the experience they construct, then how do\nmultiple transcendentally free agents interact? How do you integrate\nmy free actions into the experience that your understanding\n constructs?[21]\n In spite of these unsolved puzzles, Kant holds that we can make sense\nof moral appraisal and responsibility only by thinking about human\nfreedom in this way, because it is the only way to prevent natural\nnecessity from undermining both.\n\nFinally, since Kant invokes transcendental idealism to make sense of\nfreedom, interpreting his thinking about freedom leads us back to\ndisputes between the two-objects and two-aspects interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism. On the face of it, the two-objects\ninterpretation seems to make better sense of Kant\u2019s view of\ntranscendental freedom than the two-aspects interpretation. If\nmorality requires that I am transcendentally free, then it seems that\nmy true self, and not just an aspect of my self, must be outside of\ntime, according to Kant\u2019s argument. But applying the two-objects\ninterpretation to freedom raises problems of its own, since it\ninvolves making a distinction between noumenal and phenomenal selves\nthat does not arise on the two-aspects view. If only my noumenal self\nis free, and freedom is required for moral responsibility, then my\nphenomenal self is not morally responsible. But how are my noumenal\nand phenomenal selves related, and why is punishment inflicted on\nphenomenal selves? It is unclear whether and to what extent appealing\nto Kant\u2019s theory of freedom can help to settle disputes about\nthe proper interpretation of transcendental idealism, since there are\nserious questions about the coherence of Kant\u2019s theory on either\ninterpretation.\n5.3 The fact of reason\n\nCan we know that we are free in this transcendental sense?\nKant\u2019s response is tricky. On the one hand, he distinguishes\nbetween theoretical knowledge and morally justified belief\n(A820\u2013831/B848\u2013859). We do not have theoretical knowledge\nthat we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible\nexperience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free\nin this sense. On the other hand, Kant also uses stronger language\nthan this when discussing freedom. For example, he says that\n\u201camong all the ideas of speculative reason freedom is the only\none the possibility of which we know a priori, though without having\nany insight into it, because it is the condition of the moral law,\nwhich we do know.\u201d In a footnote to this passage, Kant explains\nthat we know freedom a priori because \u201cwere there no freedom,\nthe moral law would not be encountered at all in ourselves,\u201d and\non Kant\u2019s view everyone does encounter the moral law a priori\n(5:4). For this reason, Kant claims that the moral law\n\u201cproves\u201d the objective, \u201cthough only practical,\nundoubted reality\u201d of freedom (5:48\u201349). So Kant wants to\nsay that we do have knowledge of the reality of freedom, but that this\nis practical knowledge of a practical reality, or cognition\n\u201conly for practical purposes,\u201d by which he means to\ndistinguish it from theoretical knowledge based on experience or\nreflection on the conditions of experience (5:133). Our practical\nknowledge of freedom is based instead on the moral law. The difference\nbetween Kant\u2019s stronger and weaker language seems mainly to be\nthat his stronger language emphasizes that our belief or practical\nknowledge about freedom is unshakeable and that it in turn provides\nsupport for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality\nof the soul. \n\nKant calls our consciousness of the moral law, our awareness that the\nmoral law binds us or has authority over us, the \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d (5:31\u201332, 42\u201343, 47, 55). So, on his view,\nthe fact of reason is the practical basis for our belief or practical\nknowledge that we are free. Kant insists that this moral consciousness\nis \u201cundeniable,\u201d \u201ca priori,\u201d and\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d (5:32, 47, 55). Every human being has a\nconscience, a common sense grasp of morality, and a firm conviction\nthat he or she is morally accountable. We may have different beliefs\nabout the source of morality\u2019s authority \u2013 God, social\nconvention, human reason. We may arrive at different conclusions about\nwhat morality requires in specific situations. And we may violate our\nown sense of duty. But we all have a conscience, and an unshakeable\nbelief that morality applies to us. According to Kant, this belief\ncannot and does not need to be justified or \u201cproved by any\ndeduction\u201d (5:47). It is just a ground-level fact about human\nbeings that we hold ourselves morally accountable. But Kant is making\na normative claim here as well: it is also a fact, which cannot and\ndoes not need to be justified, that we are morally accountable, that\nmorality does have authority over us. Kant holds that philosophy\nshould be in the business of defending this common sense moral belief,\nand that in any case we could never prove or disprove it (4:459).\n\nKant may hold that the fact of reason, or our consciousness of moral\nobligation, implies that we are free on the grounds that ought implies\ncan. In other words, Kant may believe that it follows from the fact\nthat we ought (morally) to do something that we can or are able to do\nit. This is suggested, for example, by a passage in which Kant asks us\nto imagine someone threatened by his prince with immediate execution\nunless he \u201cgive[s] false testimony against an honorable man whom\nthe prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext.\u201d\nKant says that \u201c[h]e would perhaps not venture to assert whether\nhe would do it or not, but he must admit without hesitation that it\nwould be possible for him. He judges, therefore, that he can do\nsomething because he is aware that he ought to do it and cognizes\nfreedom within him, which, without the moral law, would have remained\nunknown to him\u201d (5:30). This is a hypothetical example of an\naction not yet carried out. It seems that pangs of guilt about the\nimmorality of an action that you carried out in the past, on this\nreasoning, would imply more directly that you have (or at least had)\nthe ability to act otherwise than you did, and therefore that you are\nfree in Kant\u2019s sense.\n5.4 The categorical imperative\n\nIn both the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the\nCritique of Practical Reason, Kant also gives a more detailed\nargument for the conclusion that morality and freedom reciprocally\nimply one another, which is sometimes called the reciprocity thesis\n(Allison 1990). On this view, to act morally is to exercise freedom,\nand the only way to fully exercise freedom is to act morally.\nKant\u2019s arguments for this view differ in these texts, but the\ngeneral structure of his argument in the Critique of Practical\nReason may be summarized as follows.\n\nFirst, it follows from the basic idea of having a will that to act at\nall is to act on some principle, or what Kant calls a maxim. A maxim\nis a subjective rule or policy of action: it says what you are doing\nand why. Kant gives as examples the maxims \u201cto let no insult\npass unavenged\u201d and \u201cto increase my wealth by every safe\nmeans\u201d (5:19, 27). We may be unaware of our maxims, we may not\nact consistently on the same maxims, and our maxims may not be\nconsistent with one another. But Kant holds that since we are rational\nbeings our actions always aim at some sort of end or goal, which our\nmaxim expresses. The goal of an action may be something as basic as\ngratifying a desire, or it may be something more complex such as\nbecoming a doctor or a lawyer. In any case, the causes of our actions\nare never our desires or impulses, on Kant\u2019s view. If I act to\ngratify some desire, then I choose to act on a maxim that specifies\nthe gratification of that desire as the goal of my action. For\nexample, if I desire some coffee, then I may act on the maxim to go to\na cafe and buy some coffee in order to gratify that desire.\n\nSecond, Kant distinguishes between two basic kinds of principles or\nrules that we can act on: what he calls material and formal\nprinciples. To act in order to satisfy some desire, as when I act on\nthe maxim to go for coffee at a cafe, is to act on a material\nprinciple (5:21ff.). Here the desire (for coffee) fixes the goal,\nwhich Kant calls the object or matter of the action, and the principle\nsays how to achieve that goal (go to a cafe). Corresponding to\nmaterial principles, on Kant\u2019s view, are what he calls\nhypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is a principle of\nrationality that says I should act in a certain way if I choose to\nsatisfy some desire. If maxims in general are rules that describe how\none does act, then imperatives in general prescribe how one should\nact. An imperative is hypothetical if it says how I should act only if\nI choose to pursue some goal in order to gratify a desire (5:20).\nThis, for example, is a hypothetical imperative: if you want coffee,\nthen go to the cafe. This hypothetical imperative applies to you only\nif you desire coffee and choose to gratify that desire.\n\nIn contrast to material principles, formal principles describe how one\nacts without making reference to any desires. This is easiest to\nunderstand through the corresponding kind of imperative, which Kant\ncalls a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative commands\nunconditionally that I should act in some way. So while hypothetical\nimperatives apply to me only on the condition that I have and set the\ngoal of satisfying the desires that they tell me how to satisfy,\ncategorical imperatives apply to me no matter what my goals and\ndesires may be. Kant regards moral laws as categorical imperatives,\nwhich apply to everyone unconditionally. For example, the moral\nrequirement to help others in need does not apply to me only if I\ndesire to help others in need, and the duty not to steal is not\nsuspended if I have some desire that I could satisfy by stealing.\nMoral laws do not have such conditions but rather apply\nunconditionally. That is why they apply to everyone in the same\nway.\n\nThird, insofar as I act only on material principles or hypothetical\nimperatives, I do not act freely, but rather I act only to satisfy\nsome desire(s) that I have, and what I desire is not ultimately within\nmy control. To some limited extent we are capable of rationally\nshaping our desires, but insofar as we choose to act in order to\nsatisfy desires we are choosing to let nature govern us rather than\ngoverning ourselves (5:118). We are always free in the sense that we\nalways have the capacity to govern ourselves rationally instead of\nletting our desires set our ends for us. But we may (freely) fail to\nexercise that capacity. Moreover, since Kant holds that desires never\ncause us to act, but rather we always choose to act on a maxim even\nwhen that maxim specifies the satisfaction of a desire as the goal of\nour action, it also follows that we are always free in the sense that\nwe freely choose our maxims. Nevertheless, our actions are not free in\nthe sense of being autonomous if we choose to act only on material\nprinciples, because in that case we do not give the law to ourselves,\nbut instead we choose to allow nature in us (our desires) to determine\nthe law for our actions. \n\nFinally, the only way to act freely in the full sense of exercising\nautonomy is therefore to act on formal principles or categorical\nimperatives, which is also to act morally. Kant does not mean that\nacting autonomously requires that we take no account of our desires,\nwhich would be impossible (5:25, 61). Rather, he holds that we\ntypically formulate maxims with a view to satisfying our desires, but\nthat \u201cas soon as we draw up maxims of the will for\nourselves\u201d we become immediately conscious of the moral law\n(5:29). This immediate consciousness of the moral law takes the\nfollowing form:\n\nI have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by every\nsafe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has\ndied and left no record of it. This is, naturally, a case for my\nmaxim. Now I want only to know whether that maxim could also hold as a\nuniversal practical law. I therefore apply the maxim to the present\ncase and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and\nconsequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give\nsuch a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can\nprove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as\na law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that\nthere would be no deposits at all. (5:27)\n\n\nIn other words, to assess the moral permissibility of my maxim, I ask\nwhether everyone could act on it, or whether it could be willed as a\nuniversal law. The issue is not whether it would be good if everyone\nacted on my maxim, or whether I would like it, but only whether it\nwould be possible for my maxim to be willed as a universal law. This\ngets at the form, not the matter or content, of the maxim. A maxim has\nmorally permissible form, for Kant, only if it could be willed as a\nuniversal law. If my maxim fails this test, as this one does, then it\nis morally impermissible for me to act on it.\n\nIf my maxim passes the universal law test, then it is morally\npermissible for me to act on it, but I fully exercise my autonomy only\nif my fundamental reason for acting on this maxim is that it is\nmorally permissible or required that I do so. Imagine that I am moved\nby a feeling of sympathy to formulate the maxim to help someone in\nneed. In this case, my original reason for formulating this maxim is\nthat a certain feeling moved me. Such feelings are not entirely within\nmy control and may not be present when someone actually needs my help.\nBut this maxim passes Kant\u2019s test: it could be willed as a\nuniversal law that everyone help others in need from motives of\nsympathy. So it would not be wrong to act on this maxim when the\nfeeling of sympathy so moves me. But helping others in need would not\nfully exercise my autonomy unless my fundamental reason for doing so\nis not that I have some feeling or desire, but rather that it would be\nright or at least permissible to do so. Only when such a purely formal\nprinciple supplies the fundamental motive for my action do I act\nautonomously.\n\nSo the moral law is a law of autonomy in the sense that \u201cfreedom\nand unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each another\u201d\n(5:29). Even when my maxims are originally suggested by my feelings\nand desires, if I act only on morally permissible (or required) maxims\nbecause they are morally permissible (or required), then my actions\nwill be autonomous. And the reverse is true as well: for Kant this is\nthe only way to act\n autonomously.[22]\n6. The highest good and practical postulates\n\nKant holds that reason unavoidably produces not only consciousness of\nthe moral law but also the idea of a world in which there is both\ncomplete virtue and complete happiness, which he calls the highest\ngood. Our duty to promote the highest good, on Kant\u2019s view, is\nthe sum of all moral duties, and we can fulfill this duty only if we\nbelieve that the highest good is a possible state of affairs.\nFurthermore, we can believe that the highest good is possible only if\nwe also believe in the immortality of the soul and the existence of\nGod, according to Kant. On this basis, he claims that it is morally\nnecessary to believe in the immortality of the soul and the existence\nof God, which he calls postulates of pure practical reason. This\nsection briefly outlines Kant\u2019s view of the highest good and his\nargument for these practical postulates in the Critique of\nPractical Reason and other works.\n6.1 The highest good\n\nIn the previous section we saw that, on Kant\u2019s view, the moral\nlaw is a purely formal principle that commands us to act only on\nmaxims that have what he calls lawgiving form, which maxims have only\nif they can be willed as universal laws. Moreover, our fundamental\nreason for choosing to act on such maxims should be that they have\nthis lawgiving form, rather than that acting on them would achieve\nsome end or goal that would satisfy a desire (5:27). For example, I\nshould help others in need not, at bottom, because doing so would make\nme feel good, even if it would, but rather because it is right; and it\nis right (or permissible) to help others in need because this maxim\ncan be willed as a universal law.\n\nAlthough Kant holds that the morality of an action depends on the form\nof its maxim rather than its end or goal, he nevertheless claims both\nthat every human action has an end and that we are unavoidably\nconcerned with the consequences of our actions (4:437; 5:34;\n6:5\u20137, 385). This is not a moral requirement but simply part of\nwhat it means to be a rational being. Moreover, Kant also holds the\nstronger view that it is an unavoidable feature of human reason that\nwe form ideas not only about the immediate and near-term consequences\nof our actions, but also about ultimate consequences. This is the\npractical manifestation of reason\u2019s general demand for what Kant\ncalls \u201cthe unconditioned\u201d\n (5:107\u2013108).[23]\n In particular, since we naturally have desires and inclinations, and\nour reason has \u201ca commission\u201d to attend to the\nsatisfaction of our desires and inclinations, on Kant\u2019s view we\nunavoidably form an idea of the maximal satisfaction of all our\ninclinations and desires, which he calls happiness (5:61, 22, 124).\nThis idea is indeterminate, however, since nobody can know \u201cwhat\nhe really wishes and wills\u201d and thus what would make him\ncompletely happy (4:418). We also form the idea of a moral world or\nrealm of ends, in which everyone acts only in accordance with maxims\nthat can be universal laws (A808/B836, 4:433ff.).\n\nBut neither of these ideas by itself expresses our unconditionally\ncomplete end, as human reason demands in its practical use. A\nperfectly moral world by itself would not constitute our \u201cwhole\nand complete good [\u2026] even in the judgment of an impartial\nreason,\u201d because it is human nature also to need happiness\n(5:110, 25). And happiness by itself would not be unconditionally\ngood, because moral virtue is a condition of worthiness to be happy\n(5:111). So our unconditionally complete end must combine both virtue\nand happiness. In Kant\u2019s words, \u201cvirtue and happiness\ntogether constitute possession of the highest good in a person, and\nhappiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as the worth of\na person and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the highest\ngood of a possible world\u201d (5:110\u2013111). It is this\nideal world combining complete virtue with complete happiness that\nKant normally has in mind when he discusses the highest good.\n\nKant says that we have a duty to promote the highest good, taken in\nthis sense (5:125). He does not mean, however, to be identifying some\nnew duty that is not derived from the moral law, in addition to all\nthe particular duties we have that are derived from the moral\n law.[24]\n For example, he is not claiming that in addition to my duties to help\nothers in need, not to commit theft, etc., I also have the additional\nduty to represent the highest good as the final end of all moral\nconduct, combined with happiness, and to promote that end. Rather, as\nwe have seen, Kant holds that it is an unavoidable feature of human\nreasoning, instead of a moral requirement, that we represent all\nparticular duties as leading toward the promotion of the highest good.\nSo the duty to promote the highest good is not a particular duty at\nall, but the sum of all our duties derived from the moral law \u2013\nit \u201cdoes not increase the number of morality\u2019s duties but\nrather provides these with a special point of reference for the\nunification of all ends\u201d (6:5). Nor does Kant mean that anyone\nhas a duty to realize or actually bring about the highest good through\ntheir own power, although his language sometimes suggests this (5:113,\n122). Rather, at least in his later works Kant claims that only the\ncommon striving of an entire \u201cethical community\u201d can\nactually produce the highest good, and that the duty of individuals is\nto promote (but not single-handedly produce) this end with all of\ntheir strength by doing what the moral law commands (6:97\u201398,\n 390\u2013394).[25]\n\nFinally, according to Kant we must conceive of the highest good as a\npossible state of affairs in order to fulfill our duty to promote it.\nHere Kant does not mean that we unavoidably represent the highest good\nas possible, since his view is that we must represent it as possible\nonly if we are to fulfill our duty of promoting it, and yet we may\nfail at doing our duty. Rather, we have a choice about whether to\nconceive of the highest good as possible, to regard it as impossible,\nor to remain noncommittal (5:144\u2013145). But we can fulfill our\nduty of promoting the highest good only by choosing to conceive of the\nhighest good as possible, because we cannot promote any end without\nbelieving that it is possible to achieve that end (5:122). So\nfulfilling the sum of all moral duties to promote the highest good\nrequires believing that a world of complete virtue and happiness is\nnot simply \u201ca phantom of the mind\u201d but could actually be\nrealized (5:472).\n6.2 The postulates of pure practical reason\n\nKant argues that we can comply with our duty to promote the highest\ngood only if we believe in the immortality of the soul and the\nexistence of God. This is because to comply with that duty we must\nbelieve that the highest good is possible, and yet to believe that the\nhighest good is possible we must believe that the soul is immortal and\nthat God exists, according to\n Kant.[26]\n\n\nConsider first Kant\u2019s moral argument for belief in immortality.\nThe highest good, as we have seen, would be a world of complete\nmorality and happiness. But Kant holds that it is impossible for\n\u201ca rational being of the sensible world\u201d to exhibit\n\u201ccomplete conformity of dispositions with the moral law,\u201d\nwhich he calls \u201choliness,\u201d because we can never extirpate\nthe propensity of our reason to give priority to the incentives of\ninclination over the incentive of duty, which propensity Kant calls\nradical evil (5:122, 6:37). Kant claims that the moral law\nnevertheless requires holiness, however, and that it therefore\n\u201ccan only be found in an endless progress toward that complete\nconformity,\u201d or progress that goes to infinity (5:122). This\ndoes not mean that we can substitute endless progress toward complete\nconformity with the moral law for holiness in the concept of the\nhighest good, but rather that we must represent that complete\nconformity as an infinite progress toward the limit of holiness. Kant\ncontinues: \u201cThis endless progress is, however, possible only on\nthe presupposition of the existence and personality of the same\nrational being continuing endlessly (which is called the immortality\nof the soul). Hence the highest good is practically possible only on\nthe presupposition of the immortality of the soul, so that this, as\ninseparable with the moral law, is a postulate of pure practical\nreason\u201d (ibid.). Kant\u2019s idea is not that we should imagine\nourselves attaining holiness later although we are not capable of it\nin this life. Rather, his view is that we must represent holiness as\ncontinual progress toward complete conformity of our dispositions with\nthe moral law that begins in this life and extends into infinity.\n\nKant\u2019s moral argument for belief in God in the Critique of\nPractical Reason may be summarized as follows. Kant holds that\nvirtue and happiness are not just combined but necessarily combined in\nthe idea of the highest good, because only possessing virtue makes one\nworthy of happiness \u2013 a claim that Kant seems to regard as part\nof the content of the moral law (4:393; 5:110, 124). But we can\nrepresent virtue and happiness as necessarily combined only by\nrepresenting virtue as the efficient cause of happiness. This means\nthat we must represent the highest good not simply as a state of\naffairs in which everyone is both happy and virtuous, but rather as\none in which everyone is happy because they are virtuous\n(5:113\u2013114, 124). However, it is beyond the power of human\nbeings, both individually and collectively, to guarantee that\nhappiness results from virtue, and we do not know any law of nature\nthat guarantees this either. Therefore, we must conclude that the\nhighest good is impossible, unless we postulate \u201cthe existence\nof a cause of nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground\nof this connection, namely the exact correspondence of happiness with\nmorality\u201d (5:125). This cause of nature would have to be God\nsince it must have both understanding and will. Kant probably does not\nconceive of God as the efficient cause of a happiness that is rewarded\nin a future life to those who are virtuous in this one. Rather, his\nview is probably that we represent our endless progress toward\nholiness, beginning with this life and extending into infinity, as the\nefficient cause of our happiness, which likewise begins in this life\nand extends to a future one, in accordance with teleological laws that\nGod authors and causes to harmonize with efficient causes in nature\n(A809\u2013812/B837\u2013840; 5:127\u2013131, 447\u2013450).\n\nBoth of these arguments are subjective in the sense that, rather than\nattempting to show how the world must be constituted objectively in\norder for the highest good to be possible, they purport to show only\nhow we must conceive of the highest good in order to be subjectively\ncapable both of representing it as possible and of fulfilling our duty\nto promote it. But Kant also claims that both arguments have an\nobjective basis: first, in the sense that it cannot be proven\nobjectively either that immortality or God\u2019s existence are\nimpossible; and, second, in the sense that both arguments proceed from\na duty to promote the highest good that is based not on the subjective\ncharacter of human reason but on the moral law, which is objectively\nvalid for all rational beings. So while it is not, strictly speaking,\na duty to believe in God or immortality, we must believe both in order\nto fulfill our duty to promote the highest good, given the subjective\ncharacter of human reason.\n\nTo see why, consider what would happen if we did not believe in God or\nimmortality, according to Kant. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant seems to say that this would leave us without any\nincentive to be moral, and even that the moral law would be invalid\nwithout God and immortality (A813/B841, A468/B496). But Kant later\nrejects this view (8:139). His mature view is that our reason would be\nin conflict with itself if we did not believe in God and immortality,\nbecause pure practical reason would represent the moral law as\nauthoritative for us and so present us with an incentive that is\nsufficient to determine our will; but pure theoretical (i.e.,\nspeculative) reason would undermine this incentive by declaring\nmorality an empty ideal, since it would not be able to conceive of the\nhighest good as possible (5:121, 143, 471\u2013472, 450\u2013453).\nIn other words, the moral law would remain valid and provide any\nrational being with sufficient incentive to act from duty, but we\nwould be incapable of acting as rational beings, since \u201cit is a\ncondition of having reason at all [\u2026] that its principles and\naffirmations must not contradict one another\u201d (5:120). The only\nway to bring speculative and practical reason \u201cinto that\nrelation of equality in which reason in general can be used\npurposively\u201d is to affirm the postulates on the grounds that\npure practical reason has primacy over speculative reason. This means,\nKant explains, that if the capacity of speculative reason \u201cdoes\nnot extend to establishing certain propositions affirmatively,\nalthough they do not contradict it, as soon as these same propositions\nbelong inseparably to the practical interest of pure reason it must\naccept them [\u2026,] being mindful, however, that these are not its\ninsights but are yet extensions of its use from another, namely a\npractical perspective\u201d (5:121). The primacy of practical reason\nis a key element of Kant\u2019s response to the crisis of the\nEnlightenment, since he holds that reason deserves the sovereign\nauthority entrusted to it by the Enlightenment only on this basis.\n7. The unity of nature and freedom\n\nThis final section briefly discusses how Kant attempts to unify the\ntheoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment.\n7.1 The great chasm\n\nIn the Preface and Introduction to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Kant announces that his goal in the work is to\n\u201cbring [his] entire critical enterprise to an end\u201d by\nbridging the \u201cgulf\u201d or \u201cchasm\u201d that separates\nthe domain of his theoretical philosophy (discussed mainly in the\nCritique of Pure Reason) from the domain of his practical\nphilosophy (discussed mainly in the Critique of Practical\nReason) (5:170, 176, 195). In his words: \u201cThe understanding\nlegislates a priori for nature, as object of the senses, for a\ntheoretical cognition of it in a possible experience. Reason\nlegislates a priori for freedom and its own causality, as the\nsupersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned practical\ncognition. The domain of the concept of nature under the one\nlegislation and that of the concept of freedom under the other are\nentirely barred from any mutual influence that they could have on each\nother by themselves (each in accordance with its fundamental laws) by\nthe great chasm that separates the supersensible from the\nappearances\u201d (5:195).\n\nOne way to understand the problem Kant is articulating here is to\nconsider it once again in terms of the crisis of the\n Enlightenment.[27]\n The crisis was that modern science threatened to undermine\ntraditional moral and religious beliefs, and Kant\u2019s response is\nto argue that in fact these essential interests of humanity are\nconsistent with one another when reason is granted sovereignty and\npractical reason is given primacy over speculative reason. But the\ntranscendental idealist framework within which Kant develops this\nresponse seems to purchase the consistency of these interests at the\nprice of sacrificing a unified view of the world and our place in it.\nIf science applies only to appearances, while moral and religious\nbeliefs refer to things in themselves or \u201cthe\nsupersensible,\u201d then how can we integrate these into a single\nconception of the world that enables us to transition from the one\ndomain to the other? Kant\u2019s solution is to introduce a third a\npriori cognitive faculty, which he calls the reflecting power of\njudgment, that gives us a teleological perspective on the world.\nReflecting judgment provides the concept of teleology or purposiveness\nthat bridges the chasm between nature and freedom, and thus unifies\nthe theoretical and practical parts of Kant\u2019s philosophy into a\nsingle system (5:196\u2013197).\n\nIt is important to Kant that a third faculty independent of both\nunderstanding and reason provides this mediating perspective, because\nhe holds that we do not have adequate theoretical grounds for\nattributing objective teleology to nature itself, and yet regarding\nnature as teleological solely on moral grounds would only heighten the\ndisconnect between our scientific and moral ways of viewing the world.\nTheoretical grounds do not justify us in attributing objective\nteleology to nature, because it is not a condition of\nself-consciousness that our understanding construct experience in\naccordance with the concept of teleology, which is not among\nKant\u2019s categories or the principles of pure understanding that\nground the fundamental laws of nature. That is why his theoretical\nphilosophy licenses us only in attributing mechanical causation to\nnature itself. To this limited extent, Kant is sympathetic to the\ndominant strain in modern philosophy that banishes final causes from\nnature and instead treats nature as nothing but matter in motion,\nwhich can be fully described mathematically. But Kant wants somehow to\nreconcile this mechanistic view of nature with a conception of human\nagency that is essentially teleological. As we saw in the previous\nsection, Kant holds that every human action has an end and that the\nsum of all moral duties is to promote the highest good. It is\nessential to Kant\u2019s approach, however, to maintain the autonomy\nof both understanding (in nature) and reason (in morality), without\nallowing either to encroach on the other\u2019s domain, and yet to\nharmonize them in a single system. This harmony can be orchestrated\nonly from an independent standpoint, from which we do not judge how\nnature is constituted objectively (that is the job of understanding)\nor how the world ought to be (the job of reason), but from which we\nmerely regulate or reflect on our cognition in a way that enables us\nto regard it as systematically unified. According to Kant, this is the\ntask of reflecting judgment, whose a priori principle is to regard\nnature as purposive or teleological, \u201cbut only as a regulative\nprinciple of the faculty of cognition\u201d (5:197).\n7.2 The purposiveness of nature\n\nIn the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant discusses four\nmain ways in which reflecting judgment leads us to regard nature as\npurposive: first, it leads us to regard nature as governed by a system\nof empirical laws; second, it enables us to make aesthetic judgments;\nthird, it leads us to think of organisms as objectively purposive;\nand, fourth, it ultimately leads us to think about the final end of\nnature as a\n whole.[28]\n\nFirst, reflecting judgment enables us to discover empirical laws of\nnature by leading us to regard nature as if it were the product of\nintelligent design (5:179\u2013186). We do not need reflecting\njudgment to grasp the a priori laws of nature based on our categories,\nsuch as that every event has a cause. But in addition to these a\npriori laws nature is also governed by particular, empirical laws,\nsuch as that fire causes smoke, which we cannot know without\nconsulting experience. To discover these laws, we must form hypotheses\nand devise experiments on the assumption that nature is governed by\nempirical laws that we can grasp (Bxiii\u2013xiv). Reflecting\njudgment makes this assumption through its principle to regard nature\nas purposive for our understanding, which leads us to treat nature as\nif its empirical laws were designed to be understood by us\n(5:180\u2013181). Since this principle only regulates our cognition\nbut is not constitutive of nature itself, this does not amount to\nassuming that nature really is the product of intelligent design,\nwhich according to Kant we are not justified in believing on\ntheoretical grounds. Rather, it amounts only to approaching nature in\nthe practice of science as if it were designed to be understood by us.\nWe are justified in doing this because it enables us to discover\nempirical laws of nature. But it is only a regulative principle of\nreflecting judgment, not genuine theoretical knowledge, that nature is\npurposive in this way.\n\nSecond, Kant thinks that aesthetic judgments about both beauty and\nsublimity involve a kind of purposiveness, and that the beauty of\nnature in particular suggests to us that nature is hospitable to our\nends. According to his aesthetic theory, we judge objects to be\nbeautiful not because they gratify our desires, since aesthetic\njudgments are disinterested, but rather because apprehending their\nform stimulates what he calls the harmonious \u201cfree play\u201d\nof our understanding and imagination, in which we take a distinctively\naesthetic pleasure (5:204\u2013207, 217\u2013218, 287). So beauty is\nnot a property of objects, but a relation between their form and the\nway our cognitive faculties work. Yet we make aesthetic judgments that\nclaim intersubjective validity because we assume that there is a\ncommon sense that enables all human beings to communicate aesthetic\nfeeling (5:237\u2013240, 293\u2013296). Beautiful art is\nintentionally created to stimulate this universally communicable\naesthetic pleasure, although it is effective only when it seems\nunintentional (5:305\u2013307). Natural beauty, however, is\nunintentional: landscapes do not know how to stimulate the free play\nof our cognitive faculties, and they do not have the goal of giving us\naesthetic pleasure. In both cases, then, beautiful objects appear\npurposive to us because they give us aesthetic pleasure in the free\nplay of our faculties, but they also do not appear purposive because\nthey either do not or do not seem to do this intentionally. Kant calls\nthis relation between our cognitive faculties and the formal qualities\nof objects that we judge to be beautiful \u201csubjective\npurposiveness\u201d (5:221). Although it is only subjective, the\npurposiveness exhibited by natural beauty in particular may be\ninterpreted as a sign that nature is hospitable to our moral interests\n(5:300). Moreover, Kant also interprets the experience of sublimity in\nnature as involving purposiveness. But in this case it is not so much\nthe purposiveness of nature as our own purpose or\n\u201cvocation\u201d as moral beings that we become aware of in the\nexperience of the sublime, in which the size and power of nature stand\nin vivid contrast to the superior power of our reason\n(5:257\u2013260, 267\u2013269).\n\nThird, Kant argues that reflecting judgment enables us to regard\nliving organisms as objectively purposive, but only as a regulative\nprinciple that compensates for our inability to fully understand them\nmechanistically, which reflects the limitations of our cognitive\nfaculties rather than any intrinsic teleology in nature. We cannot\nfully understand organisms mechanistically because they are\n\u201cself-organizing\u201d beings, whose parts are \u201ccombined\ninto a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect of their\nform\u201d (5:373\u2013374). The parts of a watch are also possible\nonly through their relation to the whole, but that is because the\nwatch is designed and produced by some rational being. An organism, by\ncontrast, produces and sustains itself, which is inexplicable to us\nunless we attribute to organisms purposes by analogy with human art\n(5:374\u2013376). But Kant claims that it is only a regulative\nprinciple of reflecting judgment to regard organisms in this way, and\nthat we are not justified in attributing objective purposiveness to\norganisms themselves, since it is only \u201cbecause of the peculiar\nconstitution of my cognitive faculties [that] I cannot judge about the\npossibility of those things and their generation except by thinking of\na cause for these acts in accordance with intentions\u201d\n(5:397\u2013398). Specifically, we cannot understand how a whole can\nbe the cause of its own parts because we depend on sensible intuition\nfor the content of our thoughts and therefore must think the\nparticular (intuition) first by subsuming it under the general (a\nconcept). To see that this is just a limitation of the human,\ndiscursive intellect, imagine a being with an intuitive understanding\nwhose thought does not depend, as ours does, on receiving sensory\ninformation passively, but rather creates the content of its thought\nin the act of thinking it. Such a (divine) being could understand how\na whole can be the cause of its parts, since it could grasp a whole\nimmediately without first thinking particulars and then combining them\ninto a whole (5:401\u2013410). Therefore, since we have a discursive\nintellect and cannot know how things would appear to a being with an\nintuitive intellect, and yet we can only think of organisms\nteleologically, which excludes mechanism, Kant now says that we must\nthink of both mechanism and teleology only as regulative principles\nthat we need to explain nature, rather than as constitutive principles\nthat describe how nature is intrinsically constituted (5:410ff.).\n\nFourth, Kant concludes the Critique of the Power of Judgment\nwith a long appendix arguing that reflecting judgment supports\nmorality by leading us to think about the final end of nature, which\nwe can only understand in moral terms, and that conversely morality\nreinforces a teleological conception of nature. Once it is granted on\ntheoretical grounds that we must understand certain parts of nature\n(organisms) teleologically, although only as a regulative principle of\nreflecting judgment, Kant says we may go further and regard the whole\nof nature as a teleological system (5:380\u2013381). But we can\nregard the whole of nature as a teleological system only by employing\nthe idea of God, again only regulatively, as its intelligent designer.\nThis involves attributing what Kant calls external purposiveness to\nnature \u2013 that is, attributing purposes to God in creating nature\n(5:425). What, then, is God\u2019s final end in creating nature?\nAccording to Kant, the final end of nature must be human beings, but\nonly as moral beings (5:435, 444\u2013445). This is because only\nhuman beings use reason to set and pursue ends, using the rest of\nnature as means to their ends (5:426\u2013427). Moreover, Kant claims\nthat human happiness cannot be the final end of nature, because as we\nhave seen he holds that happiness is not unconditionally valuable\n(5:430\u2013431). Rather, human life has value not because of what we\npassively enjoy, but only because of what we actively do (5:434). We\ncan be fully active and autonomous, however, only by acting morally,\nwhich implies that God created the world so that human beings could\nexercise moral autonomy. Since we also need happiness, this too may be\nadmitted as a conditioned and consequent end, so that reflecting\njudgment eventually leads us to the highest good (5:436). But\nreflection on conditions of the possibility of the highest good leads\nagain to Kant\u2019s moral argument for belief in God\u2019s\nexistence, which in turn reinforces the teleological perspective on\nnature with which reflecting judgment began.\n\nThus Kant argues that although theoretical and practical philosophy\nproceed from separate and irreducible starting points \u2013\nself-consciousness as the highest principle for our cognition of\nnature, and the moral law as the basis for our knowledge of freedom\n\u2013 reflecting judgment unifies them into a single, teleological\nworldview that assigns preeminent value to human autonomy.\n",
