    "main_text": "What Legal Interpretation Seeks || Linguistic Meaning\n2.1 Linguistic Meaning\nIn discussions of legal interpretation, there is a widespread assumption \u2013 sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit \u2013 that legal interpretation seeks the meaning of the legal texts. Frequently, all sides to a legal interpretive debate ostensibly agree that the debate concerns the meaning of a particular legal text (Berman and Toh 2013, 547, fn. 11; Greenberg 2014, 1297 fn. 19; see, e.g., Greenawalt 2004, 275\u201377; Alexander and Prakash 2004, 991; Goldsworthy 2009, 683; Fallon 2015, 1237, 1297\u20131307; Lawson 1997; Barak 2005, 3; Whittington 2010, 121; Fiss 1982, 739, 743\u201345; Dickerson 1975, 3, 217; for judicial examples, see the various opinions in Smith v. United States, and District of Columbia v. Heller).[4] But this apparent agreement does not in fact tell us much because the term \u201cmeaning\u201d (and its cognates) is often used loosely and, in any event, has several senses. There is a broad use of the term in which it is a rough synonym of \u201cimplication\u201d or \u201cconsequence.\u201d One might ask what the outcome of a particular election means for international trade or for abortion rights.\nAgain, \u201cmeaning\u201d can be used to mean, roughly, significance, as when we catch someone doing something inappropriate and ask, \u201cwhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\nDifferently again, \u201cmeaning\u201d can be used for the information or content that a symbol expresses or represents. This symbolic meaning can be called meaning in the strict sense. Mathematical symbols and semaphore flags have meanings in the strict sense.\nLinguistic meaning is a species of symbolic meaning. Linguistic meaning is the information that is reliably and systematically conveyed by words, sentences, and other linguistic entities. In fact, there are several kinds and components of linguistic meaning, such as word meaning, semantic content, what is said, speaker meaning, and implicature.[5] (In this subsection, in considering the possibility that legal interpretation seeks linguistic meaning, I set aside the issue of the type of linguistic meaning.)\nThe widespread acceptance that legal interpretation seeks the meaning of a statute or constitutional provision most likely reflects some combination of 1) a lack of clarity about the sense in which the term \u201cmeaning\u201d is being used; 2) misunderstandings about what linguistic meaning is; 3) a conflation of a provision\u2019s linguistic meaning with its contribution to the content of the law (its contribution, for short); 4) and an assumption that a provision\u2019s contribution is its linguistic meaning.[6] See Berman and Toh 2013, 547. Even sophisticated theorists who carefully distinguish between different kinds of linguistic meaning fail to distinguish between a provision\u2019s linguistic meaning and its contribution to the content of the law.[7]\nThe \u201cnew originalists\u201d (see section 3) explicitly advocate using the term \u201cconstitutional interpretation\u201d for the process of discovering the meaning of the constitutional text (to be distinguished from \u201cconstitutional construction,\u201d an \u201cessentially creative\u201d process of constructing meaning). But, with the important exception of Larry Solum (2010), it is clear from their writings that they are not using the term \u201cmeaning\u201d consistently for linguistic meaning, often seeming to have in mind, for example, a legal norm or understandings about how a legal norm was to be applied to specific cases (e.g., Whittington 1999a, 5\u201311; Barnett 2013, 419). For further examples, see section 4.2. As suggested below, it is arguable that their view is best reconstructed as holding that legal interpretation seeks the content of the law, which they hold to be constituted by \u201cpublic meaning.\u201d\nIt is crucial not to conflate a provision\u2019s linguistic meaning with its contribution to the content of the law. It might turn out that a statute\u2019s contribution is constituted by its linguistic meaning (or, more precisely, by a specific kind of linguistic meaning), but this is a highly controversial claim about how the content of the law is determined. If, in addressing the preliminary question of what legal interpretation seeks, we simply conflate a statute\u2019s contribution with its linguistic meaning, then, among other mistakes, we miss the need for a substantive argument for that claim.\nDespite the widespread assumption that legal interpretation seeks linguistic meaning, many prominent and influential theories of legal interpretation \u2013 including purposivism, some forms of intentionalism, Ronald Dworkin\u2019s theory, and pragmatism \u2013 do not make any kind of linguistic meaning the focus of their inquiry, though this fact is often obscured by confusions about the nature of linguistic meaning as well as claims by the advocates of the theories. (See sections 3 and 4.) In fact, as we will see (section 4.2), there is a good case that even contemporary textualism is not best understood as trying to ascertain linguistic meaning.\nWhat can be said in favor of the claim that legal interpretation seeks linguistic meaning? It is often taken as a starting point that interpretation is the activity of attributing meaning. (e.g., Knapp and Michaels 1982; 1983; Graglia 1992; Fish 2005; 2008; Michaels 2009; Alexander 2013). By definition, one version of the argument goes, interpretation of any object seeks its meaning \u2013 presumably in the strict sense of what that object symbolizes or represents. (If \u201cmeaning\u201d were intended in the loose sense of significance, the argument could yield no real constraint on legal interpretation.) A different but related argument is that legal interpretation is an instance of linguistic interpretation, and linguistic interpretation seeks linguistic meaning (e.g., Soames, 2009; Alexander 2011).\nThe former argument does not take us very far. To begin with, the claim that interpretation of an object is, by definition, the search for its meaning is dubious. Radiologists interpret x-rays, and x-rays don\u2019t have meanings in the strict sense. More to the point, the meaning of the word \u201cinterpretation\u201d or the nature of interpretation (in general, as opposed to legal interpretation specifically) is peripheral to our concerns. Rather, as noted above, the central consideration is what the paradigm theories \u2013 textualism, purposivism, and the like \u2013 are engaged in. If it turns out that they are engaged in some enterprise that is not correctly designated \u201cinterpretation,\u201d then so be it. It would not be problematic if legal interpretation \u2013 the topic of this chapter \u2013 is not in fact a type of interpretation properly so called (cf. Sunstein 2015).\nThe second argument \u2013 that linguistic interpretation in general seeks the linguistic meaning of texts \u2013 begs the question because it starts from the assumption that legal interpretation is a type of linguistic interpretation. It\u2019s uncontroversial that legal interpretation typically involves scrutinizing linguistic texts, among other things \u2013 even that interpreting linguistic texts is typically part of what goes into legal interpretation. But in an inquiry into the constitutive aim of legal interpretation, it is question begging to assume that legal interpretation is linguistic interpretation in a sense that entails that legal interpretation has the constitutive aim of linguistic interpretation.[8]\nAn important reason for rejecting the claim that legal interpretation seeks linguistic meaning derives from three propositions that are widely shared by theorists of legal interpretation: 1) legal interpretation often yields interpretations that resolve legal disputes; 2) in resolving disputes, judges must follow the content of the law except in extremely unusual circumstances; 3) the content of the law is often determinate enough to resolve disputes. Given these tenets, the output of legal interpretation cannot be merely the linguistic meaning of the relevant texts. If it were, and if judges must in general follow the content of the law, then legal interpretation would not be able to yield outputs that resolve legal disputes; there would have to be a further step of ascertaining the content of the law. In addition, as will be evident from the discussion in sections 3 and 4, most theories of legal interpretation make legal interpretation depend on factors that are not relevant to ascertaining linguistic meaning.\nIt might be objected that finding the linguistic meaning of the relevant legal texts does resolve disputes because the linguistic meaning constitutes the provision\u2019s contribution to the law. This objection concedes that legal interpretation seeks a provision\u2019s contribution to the law and assumes that that contribution is constituted by linguistic meaning. The objection therefore should be understood as taking the position that legal interpretation, by its nature, seeks the (provisions\u2019 contribution to the) content of the law, and further holding, based on a controversial substantive claim about how the content of the law is determined, that the correct method of legal interpretation is to ascertain linguistic meaning. At any rate, legal interpretation\u2019s constitutive aim should not be understood in a way whose plausibility depends on a controversial substantive claim about how the content of the law is determined.\nThe argument based on the three widely shared propositions counts strongly in favor of either the position that legal interpretation seeks the correct resolution of disputes or the position that it seeks the content of the law. Let us address these positions in turn.\n",
