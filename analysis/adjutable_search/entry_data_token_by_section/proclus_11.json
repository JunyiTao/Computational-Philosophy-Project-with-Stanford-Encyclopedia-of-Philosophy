    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Theurgy\n4. Influence\n\n\nIn his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, in the\nchapter on Alexandrian Philosophy, Hegel said that \u201cin Proclus we\nhave the culminating point of the Neo-Platonic philosophy; this method\nin philosophy is carried into later times, continuing even through the\nwhole of the Middle Ages. [\u2026] Although the Neo-Platonic school\nceased to exist outwardly, ideas of the Neo-Platonists, and specially\nthe philosophy of Proclus, were long maintained and preserved in the\nChurch.\u201d\n\n\nThat Proclus, who set up his elaborate Platonic\nTheology in an attempt to rationally justify a pagan religious\ntradition whose existence was threatened by the upcoming Christian\ncivilization, would have had such an influence in Christian medieval\nthought might seem surprising. His influence, however, is mainly\nindirect, as his ideas circulated under the names of other\nphilosophers. There was, of course, a direct confrontation with the\nworks of Proclus in the later Neoplatonic school (via Damascius and\nAmmonius, 5th\u20136th century) and in Byzantium. In the\n11th century, Michael Psellus studied Proclus intensively\nand even preserved fragments of his lost works. One of his disciples\nwas the Georgian Ioanne Petritsi, who translated Proclus\u2019\nElements into Georgian and composed a commentary on it\n(Gigineishvili 2007). In the 12th century, bishop Nicolaus\nof Methone wrote a Christian reply to Proclus\u2019 Elements,\nthus showing indirectly that the work was still attracting interest.\nMoreover, Isaac Sebastocrator (11\u201312th century) produced a\nChristian adaption of the Tria opuscula. Around 1300 Proclus\nattracted the interest of the philosopher George Pachymeres, who\nprepared an edition of Proclus\u2019 Commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which was only preserved in a very corrupt\ntradition, and even composed a commentary to the last part of the\ndialogue where Proclus\u2019 commentary was lacking. Cardinal\nBessarion was an attentive reader of Proclus\u2019 works and possessed\nseveral manuscripts. We owe to the interest of scholars such as\nPsellus, Pachymeres, and Bessarion, the preservation of the work of the\npagan Proclus, who had not such a good reputation in theological\ncircles in Byzantium. And yet, the number of direct readers of Proclus\nbefore the Renaissance was very limited.\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Proclus\u2019 influence was mainly indirect, above all\nthrough the writings of the Christian author Dionysius the Areopagite\nand the Arabic Liber de causis. Dionysius was a Christian\nauthor writing around 500, who was deeply fascinated by Proclus. He\nfully exploited Proclus\u2019 works \u2013 which he must have read\nintensively \u2014 to develop his own original Christian Platonic theology.\nHe presented himself as a disciple of Saint Paul, a pretence which was\ngenerally accepted until the late 19th century, thus giving\nhis works, and indirectly Proclus\u2019 theology, an almost apostolic\nauthority. As Dodds 1963\u00b2, xxviii, has nicely put it:\n\u201cProclus was [\u2026] conquering Europe in the guise of an\nearly Christian.\u201d The well known Book of Causes is an\nArabic adaption of the Elements of Theology, made in the\n9th century. Translated in the 12th century, the\nLiber de causis circulated in the Middle Ages under the name\nof Aristotle, and was considered as a complement to the\nMetaphysics, offering a treatise on the divine causes. The\ntext entered the corpus of Aristotelian works and was intensively\nstudied and commented at the universities. Thomas Aquinas is the first\nto have discovered that this work derived in fact from Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology, of which he had obtained a Latin\ntranslation made by his Dominican confrere William of Moerbeke in 1268\n(see Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Liber de causis,\nintroduction). Moerbeke also translated the Tria\nopuscula and the huge commentary on the Parmenides,\nbut these works had almost no readers in the Middle Ages. Berthold of\nMoosburg wrote in the 14th century a comprehensive\ncommentary on the Latin Elements of Theology . The real\nrediscovery of Proclus started in the Italian Renaissance, mainly\nthanks to Marsilio Ficino who followed Proclus\u2019 influence in his\nPlatonic commentaries and even composed, in imitation of Proclus, a\nChristian Platonic Theology on the immortality of the soul.\nBefore Ficino, Nicolaus Cusanus had already intensively studied\nProclus in translations. Proclus continued to enjoy wide interest at\nthe turn of the 18th century. Thomas Taylor (1758\u20131835)\ntranslated all of Proclus\u2019 works into English (reprinted by the\nPrometheus Trust [London]) and tried to reconstruct the lost seventh\nbook of the\nPlatonic Theology. Victor Cousin (1792\u20131867) aimed at\na complete edition of his preserved work. At the beginning of the\n20th century we have the great editions of commentaries in\nthe Teubner collection. Renewed philosophical interest in Proclus in\nthe last century started with the edition of the Elements of\nTheology by Eric Robertson Dodds, and carried on with the edition of the\nPlatonic Theology by Henry Dominique Saffrey, Leendert\nGerrit Westerink and, not least, in Germany with the works of Werner\nBeierwaltes.\n\nLists of Proclus\u2019 works are available in the two supplements on \n\nProclus\u2019 main extant works\n\nand\n\nProclus\u2019 complete works (extant, lost, and spurious).\n\n",
