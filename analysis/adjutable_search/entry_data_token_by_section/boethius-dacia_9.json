    "main_text": "Influence\n4. Influence\n\nIn the 1290s the wealthy scholar Geoffrey of Fontaines personally\nwrote down abridgments of Boethius\u2019 Modi Significandi,\nthe questions on Topics and De anima I\u2013II, as\nwell as the opuscula (see the introductions to the\neditions).\n\nModi significandi had a considerable diffusion, evidenced by\nsix extant copies from the thirteenth, five from the fourteenth, and\ntwo from the fifteenth century. Strong influence from Boethius has\nbeen detected in the anonymous question commentary on Priscian\nMinor known as Innata est nobis, where he is referred to\nas \u201ca famous man\u201d (Pinborg 1967: 93\u20134). The\nSumma grammatica of John of Dacia (1280), while more\ndependent on Martin of Dacia\u2019s Modi significandi, also\nowes a considerable debt to Boethius (Pinborg 1967: 87). According to\nPinborg (1967: 91\u20132), Boethius further left his mark on Michael\nof Marbais\u2019 Summa de modis significandi, but this has\nbeen called in doubt (Kelly 1995: XLV).\n\nQuestions on the Topics had a fair number of readers for a\nlong time, surviving in eleven manuscripts from the thirteenth to the\nfifteenth centuries plus Geoffrey\u2019s abridgement, and being\nquoted as late as the fifteenth century (Green-Pedersen 1984:\n388\u20139).\n\nThe commentaries on Physics, On Generation and Corruption\n(\u201cGC\u201d), Meteorology and De\nanima are only preserved in one manuscript each, and so,\npresumably, had little impact. Those on Physics and\nGC, which are transmitted in the same manuscript, repeatedly\ndeal with controversial matters like the eternity of the world. The\nlast question on GC has been rendered almost entirely\nunreadable by overlining, presumably the owner\u2019s reaction to the\n1277 condemnation, for the title of the question was \u201cWhether\nthe first movement can be perpetual\u201d and from what remains of\nthe question it is clear that Boethius argued that, scientifically\nspeaking, the world cannot be \u201cnew\u201d, although according to\nfaith it is so. Other copies of the two works must have existed, but\nfear of being denounced to ecclesiastical authorities may have stopped\nthe production of new ones after the condemnation.\n\nTraces of Boethius\u2019 lost questions on the Metaphysics\nhave been discovered in an anonymous set of questions that may be from\nthe 1270\u2019s (Fioravanti 2009). Only a handful of manuscripts\ntransmit De aeternitate mundi and the same is true of De\nsomniis, whereas there is a score of text witnesses to De\nsummo bono, whose success was helped by a common misattribution\nto the famous sixth-century Roman Manlius Boethius, and in some\nmanuscripts to Thomas Aquinas. Finally, only one manuscript carries\nthe sophisma Syllogizantem, while Omnis homo\n\u2026 is found in two, but in one of them the text has been\nrevised and enlarged by a slightly later scholar.\n\nThe 1277 condemnation did not make arts masters stop praising the\nphilosopher\u2019s life in the introductory lecture with which they\nhabitually began every question course on an authoritative book, and\nin practice most kept Boethius\u2019 distinction between science and\nfaith, though without his provocative formulations.\n",
