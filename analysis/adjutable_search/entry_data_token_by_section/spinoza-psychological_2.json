    "main_text": "The Human Being as Part of Nature || The Striving Doctrine as an Account of the Natures of Particular Objects\n1.2 The Striving Doctrine as an Account of the Natures of Particular Objects\n\n\nDespite worries that one might have about the validity of Spinoza\u2019s\nargument, the doctrine has at least some claim to plausibility as an\naccount of the nature of particular things. The Ethics stands\nbadly in need of some account of what finite modes are, after all, and\nIIIp4 provides at least one interesting way of distinguishing genuine\nobjects from mere constructs: if the thing in question destroys itself\nit is not a genuine object. Thus, by IIIp4, a thing that destroys\nitself\u2014one might think a lit candle or a time bomb such a\nthing\u2014is not a genuine object but a thing which does not destroy\nitself is. To the extent that IIIp4 makes most of the things we\nintuitively consider genuine objects genuine objects, it captures\nordinary views. To the extent that it rules out some clear class of\nthings that we intuitively consider genuine objects (lit candles and\ntime bombs), it represents a controversial philosophical thesis. The\nplausibility of the doctrine depends on whether we find that there\nreally is reason to find basic metaphysical differences in kind\nbetween \u201cthings\u201d which tend to destroy themselves and things which do\nnot.  One strategy for defending the plausibility of IIIp4 may be to\ninvestigate what Spinoza means there by an \u201cexternal cause.\u201d\nSpinoza\u2019s various claims about essences, properties, and accidents\nsuggest that at least some of the cases of destruction that we might\nconsider self-destruction are, for Spinoza, destruction by external\ncauses (Garrett, 2002, pursues this strategy), a suggestion that is supported by Spinoza\u2019s account of suicide later in the Ethics at IVp20s.   The class of things which tend to destroy themselves may be different from, and narrower\nthan, one might think it is on a first reading of IIIp4.\n\n\nIIIp6 introduces, perhaps, a slightly different thesis about what it\nmeans to be a particular thing: a particular thing is one which\nstrives to persevere in being. IIIp6\u2019s dependence upon IIIp4 suggests\nthat this thesis means that any object will remain in the same state\nunless external causes affect it. Such a thesis appears to be a\nprinciple of inertia, and, indeed, Spinoza seems to invoke a principle\nof inertia in the terms he uses at IIIp6.\n\u2018Conatus\u2019 is a technical term of Cartesian\nphysics, referring to an object\u2019s motion. Spinoza himself uses the\nterm in this way in his exposition of Descartes\u2019s Principles of\nPhilosophy. (Compare, for example, Descartes\u2019s\nPrinciples II, art. 37, III, art. 56 and III, art. 58 to\nSpinoza\u2019s exposition IIp14c, IIID3 and IIp17,\nrespectively). Moreover, at IIIp6, in addition to using the term\n\u2018conatus\u2019 again, Spinoza also uses the same\nphrase that he uses in framing a different principle of inertia at\nIIp14 of his exposition of Descartes\u2019s physics: \u201cas far as\nit can by its own power\u201d quantum in se est. This phrase\nis also one that Descartes himself uses at Principles II,\nart. 37. (Note however that there is some controversy over how this\nphrase is to be understood: see Curley\u2019s footnote to IIIp6 in\nhis translation and Garrett, 1999, note 2.) So there is a good textual\nbasis for the conclusion that IIIp6 indeed has this meaning.\n\n\nApart from the question of how a principle of inertia can give us an\nunderstanding of human nature, this interpretation of IIIp6 raises a\ndifficult question about Spinoza\u2019s use of the striving doctrine.  One\nmight object that IIIp6, understood as a restatement of a principle\nof inertia, extends a physical principle to mind without sufficient\nclarity. In stating their versions of a principle of inertia in physics, both Descartes and Spinoza are careful to limit the claim to a claim about bodies.\nSpinoza, for example, in his definition of conatus ad motum,\nIIId3 of his exposition of Descartes, writes:\nBy striving for motion we do not understand any thought,\nbut only that a part of matter is so placed and stirred to motion, that\nit really would go somewhere if it were not prevented by any\ncause.\n\n\nIn addition to characterizing matter, however, IIIp6 is a foundational\nclaim about the nature of mind and, in particular, about human\npsychology. There is a basis, in Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics, for thinking\nthat whatever is true about bodies is true about minds also in some\nsense (and see IIIp10 and IIIp11 for Spinoza\u2019s account of striving and\nthe mind/body relation). Striving in physics, however, is understood\nas a tendency to a certain kind of motion, and motion seems, if\nanything does, to belong to bodies alone. So Spinoza needs to supply\nan account of the mental correlate to the physical \u201cstriving for\nmotion.\u201d But IIIp6 leaves open the question of what it means for\na mind to strive. On this objection, the striving doctrine uses a kind\nof metaphorical language, the term \u2018striving\u2019, where a\nprecise and literal account of what it is that is characteristic of\nmind is required.\n",
