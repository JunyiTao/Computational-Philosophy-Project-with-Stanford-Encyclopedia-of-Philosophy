    "main_text": "Epistemological Views || Academics vs. Stoics\n3.1 Academics vs. Stoics\n\nPhilo\u2019s distinct epistemological views share one fundamental\nfeature: all of them deny the possibility of knowledge according to\nthe dominant Stoic conception of it. The essential context for\nunderstanding Philo is thus the critique of Stoic epistemology offered\nby Academic philosophers, and especially by Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nover the preceding hundred and fifty years (c. 280\u2013130 BCE).\n\nThe Stoics\u2019 epistemology was designed to accommodate their\nbelief that it must be possible, in principle, to achieve the sort of\ninerrant wisdom Socrates had desired. The Stoic theory depends on\nthree innovations (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 1.40\u20132.). (1)\nThey defined the formation of a belief as a matter of assenting to an\noccurrent thought or impression that something is, or is not, the\ncase. (2) They isolated a certain kind of perceptual (and perhaps also\nnon-perceptual) impression as \u201ccognitive\u201d\n(cataleptic), because it was self-warranting, such that\nassenting to these impressions constituted a \u201ccognition\u201d\n(catalepsis\u2014lit. a \u201cgrasp\u201d) of the state of\naffairs they represented. And (3) they took secure knowledge of the\nsort Socrates sought to be the state of an agent whose beliefs are\nconstituted entirely by perceptual and non-perceptual cognitions. As a\nresult, given their ethical doctrine that secure knowledge was\nnecessary and sufficient for happiness, and since, according to (3),\nsuch knowledge could be achieved by restricting one\u2019s assent to\ncognitive impressions, the Stoics identified the avoidance of opinion\nand error\u2014i.e., assent to non-cognitive impressions, whether\ninadequately warranted (opinion) or false (error)\u2014as the\noverriding principle of rationality.\n\nThe Academics attacked every part of this Stoic theory\u2014their\npractice was to argue against all philosophical positions\u2014but\ntheir criticism focused, unsurprisingly, on the central notion of the\ncognitive impression. The Stoics standardly defined a cognitive\nimpression as one that came from what is, was stamped and impressed\nexactly in accordance with it, and was, accordingly, such that it\ncouldn\u2019t be false (see, e.g., Sextus\u00a0Adversus\nMathematicos\u00a0[\u00a0M]\u00a07.248 or Cicero\nAc. 2.77). They took this to mean, roughly, that an\nimpression is cognitive if and only if\n\nits content is true\nit is caused in the appropriate way for correctly representing its\nobject, and\nits truth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of\nrepresentation guaranteed by its causal history (see M. Frede\n1999).\n\n\nThe general Academic tactic against this view was to concede the\npossibility that an impression might meet conditions [a] and [b], but\nargue that condition [c] never obtained. They appealed to our\nexperience of twins etc. and in abnormal states such as dreams,\nillusions and episodes of madness to show that it was always possible\nto have a false impression with exactly the same richness and detail\nof representation as a true one; it follows that meeting condition [b]\ncould never suffice to show that condition [c] obtains, with the\nresult that the warrant claimed in [c] is never available to us. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M\u00a07.402\u201310 & Cicero Ac.\n2.84\u201390).\n\nThe Academics used these arguments to point out that if our\nimpressions are never self-warranting in the way cognitive impressions\nare supposed to be, and if the Stoic definition of the cognitive\nimpression is correct, there is no cognition. Hence, if all knowledge\ndepends on cognitions, as the Stoics claim, nothing at all can be\nknown. The Academics also offered a corollary to this argument,\ndrawing on the Stoic principle of rationality mentioned above:\n\nif there are no cognitive impressions (as the Academics have\nargued)\nand if the wise person never assents to a non-cognitive impression\n(as the Stoics think)\nthen the wise person will never assent to anything, viz. she will\nsuspend her assent universally.\n\n\nThus, according to the Stoic theory, once it is shown that there are\nno cognitive impressions as they define them, if there are any wise\npeople, they will have no beliefs; and, whether there are any wise\npeople or not, it is never rational to assent to any impression. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M\u00a07.150\u20137 & Cicero Ac.\n2.66\u20138 & 2.77\u20138).\n\nThe Stoics, of course, came up with plenty of sophisticated\ncounter-arguments to the criticisms of the cognitive impression, to\nwhich the Academics devised equally subtle responses. But one argument\nin particular seems to have seriously troubled the Academic students\nof Carneades: the Stoic \u201cinactivity\u201d objection. This was a\nvery simple practical reductio, connected to the corollary\nargument given above: if the Academics were right it would be\nimpossible to act at all (let alone well), since voluntary action\ndepends on beliefs and thus on assent (see, e.g., Cicero Ac.\n2.24\u20135 and 2.34\u20137). But since action (indeed, good action)\nis possible, the Academics must be mistaken. The later Academics saw\nthree ways in which they could respond to this counter-argument\nwithout giving up their arguments against cognitive impressions. They\ncould:\n\ndeny the connection the Stoics discerned between voluntary action\nand belief or assent; or\nreject the Stoic principle of rationality by allowing for\nrationally defensible assent to non-cognitive impressions, i.e.,\nopinions (thus rejecting premise [ii] above and the conclusion [iii]);\nor\naccept the force of the Stoic position by allowing that knowledge\nmust after all be possible, though on some weaker definition of\ncognition than the Stoic one.\n\n\nThese three options turn out to define the three Academic positions\nPhilo held: position [1] was the core of Clitomachus\u2019 defense of\nradical skepticism; position [2] was the basis of Philo\u2019s\ndefense of mitigated skepticism; and position [3] was the one Philo\ndefended in the Roman Books.\n",
