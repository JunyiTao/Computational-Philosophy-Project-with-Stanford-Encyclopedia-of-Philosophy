It was\nHenslow who was the final link to Darwin in a chain connected to\nCaptain Robert Fitzroy of H. M. S. Beagle. Fitzroy sought a gentleman\ncompanion who could also collect information on geology and natural\nhistory during a proposed circumnavigation of the globe. Henslow\u2019s\nnote to Darwin, asking if he would be interested in being recommended\nfor this post, arrived at the Darwin home, \u2018the Mount\u2019,\nwhile Charles Darwin was on a geological survey of Northern Wales with\nAdam Sedgwick. After resistance from his father had been overcome,\nDarwin was offered the post and accepted it.\n\n\nThe combination of meticulous field observation, collection and\nexperimentation, note taking, reading and thinking during what turned\ninto the Beagle\u2019s five year journey through a very wide cross-section\nof the earth\u2019s environments was to set the course for the rest of his\nlife. During the voyage he read and reread Charles Lyell\u2019s newly\npublished Principles of Geology, a three-volume work that\narticulated a philosophical vision of rigorously empirical historical\nscience, oriented around five key ideas:\n\nThe geologist investigates both the animate and inanimate changes\nthat have taken place during the earth\u2019s history.\nHis principal tasks are to develop an accurate and comprehensive\nrecord of those changes, to encapsulate that knowledge in general\nlaws, and to search for their causes.\nThis search must be limited to causes that can be studied\nempirically\u2014those \u2018now in operation\u2019, as Lyell puts\nit in the sub-title of his Principles. \nThe records or \u2018monuments\u2019 of the earth\u2019s past\nindicate a constant process of the \u2018introduction\u2019 and\n\u2018extinction\u2019 of species, and it is the geologist\u2019s task to\nsearch for the causes of these introductions and extinctions,\naccording to the strictures note in 3., above.\nThe only serious attempt to do so according to the idea that species are\ncapable of \u2018indefinite modification\u2019, that of Jean\nBaptiste Lamarck, is a failure on methodological grounds.  All the\nevidence supports the view that species variability is limited, and\nthat one species cannot be transformed into another.\n\n\n\nThis vision influenced Darwin profoundly, as he freely admitted. While\nhe became convinced by his observations and reading that the fossil\nrecord and current distribution of species could only be due to the\ngradual transformation of one species into another, he was determined\nto articulate a theory that measured up to Lyell\u2019s principles. The\ncrucial event in convincing him that this was to be his life\u2019s work\nwas likely a visit to Cape Town, South Africa during the Beagle\u2019s return\ntrip to England. John F. W. Herschel was in Cape Town on a mission to do\nfor the Southern Hemisphere what his father William had done for the\nNorthern, namely to develop a comprehensive star map with the new\npowerful telescopes developed by his father and aunt.  As noted\nearlier, Darwin had been deeply impressed by Herschel\u2019s\nPreliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy when\nit first appeared a year before the Beagle set sail, and in his\nprivate journal he referred to his meetings with Herschel during a\nweek long stop in Cape Town in June of 1836 as among the most profound\nevents of the entire voyage. Just five months before meeting Darwin,\nHerschel had finished reading the 2nd edition of Lyell\u2019s\nPrinciples. He sent Lyell a long letter filled with detailed\nconstructive commentary.  The letter opens by praising Lyell for\nfacing the issue of the \u2018introduction of new species\u2019\u2014which Herschel calls \u2018that mystery of mysteries\u2019\u2014scientifically, and for advocating that we search for\n\u2018intermediate causes\u2019 to explain these\n\u2018introductions\u2019\u2014code for natural, as opposed to\n\u2018miraculous\u2019,\n causes.[5]\n  This part of the letter was quoted in Charles Babbage\u2019s\nBridgewater Treatise, published in 1837 while Darwin was\nstruggling to develop just such a theory. Upon reading the Herschel\nquotation in Babbage, Darwin wrote in his private\n\u2018species\u2019 notebooks: \n\n\nBabbage 2d Edit, p. 226.\u2014Herschel calls the appearance of new\nspecies. the mystery of mysteries. & has grand passage upon\nproblem.! Hurrah.\u2014\u201cintermediate causes\u201d. (Barrett et\nal., 1987, 413; original punctuation) \n\n\nHe clearly recognizes that Herschel is here providing a\nphilosophical justification for the project upon which Darwin was secretly\nworking. And, in the very first paragraph of On the Origin of\nSpecies, Darwin looks back to this \u2018Hurrah\u2019,\nattributing the idea that the origin of species is \u2018that mystery\nof mysteries\u2019 to \u2018one of our greatest philosophers\u2019,\nwithout mentioning Herschel by name. The first mention of the\npossibility of an evolutionary solution to this problem is in his\nOrnithological Notebooks, in a note written shortly after\ndeparting Cape\n Town.[6]\n\n\n\nDarwin\u2019s theoretical task was, by the time he opened his species\nnotebooks, tolerably clear: the only process that could produce the\nsystematic patterns in the fossil record and the otherwise strange\nbiogeographic distribution of species he now understood so widely and\ndeeply was a process of slow, gradual transformation of species. He\nneeded to come up with a natural, causal theory that would account for\nsuch transformations, and every element of that theory had to identify\n\u2018causes now in operation\u2019, causes that could be\ninvestigated empirically. The problem, and the methodological\nconstraints, had been advocated by his geological hero, and now close\nfriend, Charles Lyell; and they had been defended philosophically by\nhis philosophical hero, Sir John Herschel. \n\n\nDarwin, of course, expected, and got, outraged reactions from\nreligiously conservative colleagues, such as his old geology teacher\nSedgwick, who in a review expressed his \u201cdeep aversion to the\ntheory; because of its unflinching materialism;--because it has\ndeserted the inductive track,--the only track that leads to physical\ntruth;--because it utterly repudiates final causes, and therby [sic]\nindicates a demoralized understanding on the part of its\nadvocates.\u201d What he had not expected was Lyell\u2019s refusal to\nopenly endorse his theory and Herschel\u2019s decisive (if polite)\nrejection of its key elements.  After we set out the theory in its\nDarwinian form, we can consider these reactions from those who\napparently shared Darwin\u2019s philosophical norms about scientific\ntheory, explanation and confirmation. \n\n\nThe theory can be set out as a series of causal elements that, working\ntogether, will produce the needed transformations.\n\nSpecies are comprised of individuals that vary ever so slightly\nfrom each other with respect to their many traits.\nSpecies have a tendency to increase in numbers over generations at a\ngeometric rate.\nThis tendency is checked, to use the language of Thomas\nMalthus\u2019 On the Principle of Population, by limited\nresources, disease, predation, and so on, creating a struggle for\nsurvival among the members of a species.\nSome individuals will have variations that give them a slight\nadvantage in this struggle, variations that allow more efficient or\nbetter access to resources, greater resistance to disease, greater\nsuccess at avoiding predation, and so on.\nThese individuals will tend to survive better and leave more\noffspring.\nOffspring tend to inherit the variations of their parents.\nTherefore favorable variations will tend to be passed on more\nfrequently than others and thus be preserved, a tendency Darwin labeled \u2018Natural\nSelection\u2019. \nOver time, especially in a slowly changing environment, this\nprocess will cause the character of species to change.\nGiven a long enough period of time, the descendant populations of\nan ancestor species will differ enough both from it and each other to be classified as different\nspecies, a process capable of indefinite iteration. There are, in\naddition, forces that encourage divergence among descendant\npopulations, and the elimination of intermediate varieties.\n\n\n\nIt will be noticed that there is no element of this theory that is\nincapable of empirical investigation\u2014indeed by now the published\nconfirmatory studies of this process would fill a small\n library.[7]\n One can understand why devout and orthodox Christians would have\nproblems; but why Darwin\u2019s philosophical and scientific mentors?  It\nwould seem to be the model of Herschelian/Lyellian orthodoxy.\n",
