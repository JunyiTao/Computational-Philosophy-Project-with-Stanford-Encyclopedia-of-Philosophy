    "main_text": "Theology || Divine ideas\n4.1 Divine ideas\n\nWyclif\u2019s world is ultimately grounded on divine essence. Thus\nthere is a close connection between any kind of truth and the\ndivine ideas (cf. Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 15, pp.\n371\u201374; De materia et forma, chap. 2, pp.\n170\u201376). Divine ideas play a threefold role in relation to God\nand creatures: they are (i) the specific essences of individual things\nthemselves, considered according to their intelligible being in the\nmind of God; (ii) God\u2019s principles of cognition of creatures;\nand (iii) the eternal models of creatures. If we also take into\naccount that in his opinion (iv) divine ideas are really the same as\nthe divine essence and formally distinct from it, and (v) this\ndistinction originates from their being efficient (con)causes in\nrelation to the different kinds of creatures, we can easily realize\nwhy Wyclif\u2019s position on this matter leads to heretical\nconsequences from the point of view of the Catholic theology: (i)\nmetaphysical and theological necessitarianism; (ii) restriction of\ndivine omnipotence; (iii) negation of the process of\ntransubstantiation in the Eucharist. In fact, Wyclif defines ideas as\nthe divine nature in action, since they are the means by which God\ncreates all that is outside Himself. In this way, any distinction\nbetween the ideas as pure rationes and the ideas as\nexemplaria, stated by St. Thomas in his Summa\ntheologiae (I, q. 15), is abolished. Furthermore, ideas are the\nconstitutive principles of divine nature, essentially identical with\nit. Thus divine ideas become as necessary as the divine nature itself.\nOn the other side, ideas are the first of the four levels of being\nproper to creatures. Indeed, since God could not help but create this\nUniverse (as we shall see in Section 4.2), everything which is is\nnecessary and so is a necessary object of God\u2019s volition. Thus,\nthe three spheres of possible, existent, and necessary totally\ncoincide. As a matter of fact, Wyclif, having defined necessary truths\nas those truths which cannot not be the case, (i) distinguishes\nbetween absolutely necessary truths and conditionally (or relatively\n\u2013 secundum quid) necessary truths, and (ii) tries to\nshow how relative necessity is consistent with supreme contingence\n(Logicae continuatio, tr. 1, chap. 11, vol. 1, pp.\n156\u201365). He thought that such distinctions enabled him to\nmaintain simultaneously the necessity of all that happens and human\nfreedom (cf. Tractatus de universalibus, ch. 14, pp.\n333\u201347); and many times he affirms that it would be heretical to\nsay that all things happen by absolute necessity; but his\nattempt failed in achieving its goal.\n\nAccording to him, absolutely necessary truths are such truths as (i)\nthose of theology (like the real proposition that God exists), that\nare per se necessary and do not depend on something else;\n(ii) those of geometry, that neither can, nor ever could, nor ever\nwill be able to be otherwise, even though they depend on something\nelse (est ab alio sed non potuit non esse); and (iii) the\npast and present truths (like the real proposition that I have existed\n\u2013 me fuisse), that cannot be, but might have been\notherwise (per accidens necessarium, quia est necessarium quod\npotuit non esse). On the contrary, relative necessity applies to\nthose events that must follow certain conditions in order to be or\nhappen \u2013 so that any contingent truth is relatively necessary if\nconsidered in relation to its conditions (Logicae\ncontinuatio, tr. 1, chap. 11, p. 157). In its turn, relative\nnecessity is divided into antecedent, consequent, and concomitant. (i)\nA certain truth is an antecedent relative necessity when its existence\ncauses the existence of another contingent truth (antecedens ut\ncausa contingentis, inferens posterius naturaliter). An instance\nof such a necessity is the necessity of volition, as where my\nunconstrained will or the unconstrained will of God is the cause which\nnecessitates something else (ibid., p, 158). (ii) A certain\ntruth is a consequent relative necessity when its existence is caused\nby an antecedent (relative) necessity. And finally, (iii) a certain\ntruth is a concomitant relative necessity when it merely accompanies\nanother true event (ibid., p. 157). These features proper to\nthe relative necessity are not opposites, and the same truth may be\nnecessary in all the three ways (ibid., pp. 157\u201358).\nWyclif insists that all three kinds of relative necessity are\ncontingent truths in themselves (ibid., p. 158), yet he was\nunable to show how this is possible. He thought he had an explanation,\nbut he was mistaken. In his Tractatus de universalibus (where\nhe uses all these distinctions in order to try to solve the problem of\nthe relationship between divine power and human freedom), he\nexplicitly maintains that in relation to the foreknowledge of God\nevery effect is necessary to come about (Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, chap. 14, p. 333), and the Aristotelian principle\nthat everything which is, when it is, necessarily is (the well known\nformulation of the diachronic contingence), applies also to what will\nbe and has been (ibid., p. 334). Taking into account that God\nhimself cannot begin or cease actually to know or will something, and\nthus He cannot change from knowing that p to knowing that\nnot-p (where p is a given truth), nor from volition\nto non-volition or vice versa (ibid., p.\n335; cf. also De volucione Dei, chap. 3, p. 149), the logical\nresult is that in Wyclif\u2019s world nothing may happen purely\ncontingently. It is true that Wyclif insists that even if God can\nnever change from volition to non-volition, the fact that God wills\np is in itself contingent, if p is not a theological\ntruth (De volucione Dei, chap. 7, p. 192), but, like\nBradwardine, he maintains that God\u2019s antecedent will is\nnaturally prior to what He foresees. Given that God is immutable, and\nhence that the divine power is not affected by the passage of time,\nand divine ideas, within Wyclif\u2019s system, are as necessary as\nthe divine essence itself, the logical consequence is that, despite\nWyclif\u2019s claims of the contrary, the whole history of the world\nis determined from eternity. As a matter of fact, Wyclif\u2019s\nconditional (or relative) necessity is as necessary as his absolute\nnecessity: given God, the world\u2019s entire history follows.\n",
