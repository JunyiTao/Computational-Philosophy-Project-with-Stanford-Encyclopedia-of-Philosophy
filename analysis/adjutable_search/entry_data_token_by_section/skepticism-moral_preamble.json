    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u201cMoral Skepticism\u201d names a diverse collection of views that deny or\nraise doubts about various roles of reason in morality. Different\nversions of moral skepticism deny or doubt moral knowledge, justified\nmoral belief, moral truth, moral facts or properties, and reasons to\nbe moral.\n\n\nDespite this diversity among the views that get labeled \u201cmoral\nskepticism\u201d, many people have very strong feelings about moral\nskepticism in general. One large group finds moral skepticism obvious,\nbecause they do not see how anyone could have real knowledge of the\nmoral status of anything or how moral facts could fit into a physical\nworld. Others see moral skepticism as so absurd that any moral theory\ncan be refuted merely by showing that it leads to moral\nskepticism. Don\u2019t you know, they ask, that slavery is morally wrong?\nOr terrorism? Or child abuse? Skeptics who deny that we have reason to\nbelieve or obey these moral judgments are seen as misguided and\ndangerous. The stridency and ease of these charges suggests mutual\nmisunderstanding, so we need to be more charitable and more\nprecise.\n",
