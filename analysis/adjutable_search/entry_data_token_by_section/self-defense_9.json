    "main_text": "Necessity\n4. Necessity\nEven when the use of force satisfies the proportionality requirement, it may nonetheless be morally impermissible. For example, if Victim can avert a lethal threat only by either killing Attacker or breaking Attacker\u2019s arm, it would be wrong to kill Attacker. Though proportionate, killing would be unnecessary in this case. As standardly understood, the necessity constraint requires defenders to compare the available means of averting a threat, rank them according to some relevant moral criteria, and use only the means that is favored by that ranking.\nBy what criteria should we rank the available means of defense? One intuitive suggestion is the we should rank defensive options according to their harmfulness. On this view, necessity requires defenders to use the least harmful means of averting a threat. However, this proposal requires modification. Consider Ledge:\n\nLedge: Victim can save his own life by either (a) pushing his culpable attacker, Villain, off a ledge, breaking Villain\u2019s leg, or (b) jumping off the ledge himself, breaking his own arm.\n\nIf it is permissible for Victim to break Villain\u2019s leg, and only necessary defense is permissible, breaking Villain\u2019s leg must be necessary. But (we assume) a broken leg is more harmful than a broken arm. How, then, can pushing Villain be necessary for saving Victim\u2019s life, given Victim\u2019s available alternative of jumping at the cost of breaking his own arm? One influential proposal (which we touched on in \u00a73.1), is that harms to which a person is liable count for less than harms to which a person is not liable. Since Villain is liable to defensive harm, we can discount Villain\u2019s interests relative to Victim\u2019s interests (as well as the interests of any bystanders) (Lazar 2012:7; McMahan 2016:185). On this view, necessity requires defenders to use the defensive option which causes the least morally-discounted harm.\nTo be plausible, the necessity constraint must be limited to comparing alternatives that are genuinely available to the defender. Even if an expertly-delivered karate chop could harmlessly render Villain unconscious, this does not make harming Villain unnecessary if Victim is not an expert in karate, even if it is, in some sense, physically possible for Victim to deliver such a blow. It also seems plausible that \u201cavailability\u201d should be understood in terms of the defender\u2019s evidence. A hidden trapdoor might offer Victim a means of escaping Attacker without using defensive force. But if Victim has no evidence of this trapdoor, the presence of this less harmful means cannot render force unnecessary (for discussion, see Steinhoff 2019: 174\u2013181).\nNecessity is also sensitive to the different probabilities of success of various defensive options. Imagine that in Murder, Victim can either kill Attacker, which has a .9 chance of saving Victim\u2019s life, or break Attacker\u2019s arm, which has a .1 chance of saving Victim\u2019s life. We are likely to think that killing Attacker counts as necessary despite the chance that a much smaller harm could also save Victim\u2019s life. But our intuitions might change as we increase the chances of success of the lesser harm. If breaking Attacker\u2019s arm has a .7 chance of saving Victim\u2019s life, perhaps killing Attacker does not satisfy the necessity constraint.\n",
