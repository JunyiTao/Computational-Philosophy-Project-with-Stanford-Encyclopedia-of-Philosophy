He did it in 1918, a\nlittle earlier than Post. However, although Post\u2019s remarks were\nparenthetical and extremely condensed, \u0141ukasiewicz explained his\nintuitions and motivations carefully and at length. He was guided by\nconsiderations about future contingents and the concept of\npossibility.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz observed that no functor of classical propositional\ncalculus could be read as \u201cit is possible that\u201d and\nprovided that the formula Mp (it is possible that p)\nis extensional (i.e., that its value depends solely on the value of\np). The difficulty can be solved if we admit a third value.\nSentences about future contingent states of affairs are natural\ncandidates for having the third value (\u00bd). For example, the\nsentence \u201cI will visit Warszawa next year\u201d, is neither\ntrue nor false, it is merely possible and has the value \u00bd. Its\nnegation has the same value. This idea led to three-valued logic. The\nusual equalities for N, A, Kand C\nare supplemented by (I list only some cases) p = \u00bd =\nNp, K \u00bd\u00bd = \u00bd,\nA\u00bd\u00bd = \u00bd. Easy calculations shows that\nApNp and NKpNp have the value \u00bd for\np = \u00bd. This means that the laws of contradiction and\nexcluded middle do not hold in three-valued logic. Later,\n\u0141ukasiewicz generalized it to logics with an arbitrary finite\nnumber of values and finally to an countably infinite number of\nvalues. The sense of implication is given by the equations:\n\nCpq = 1, for p\u2264q\n\nCpq = 1\u2212(p + q), for p>q,\n\n\nand the sense of negation by the equation:\n\nNp = 1\u2212p, where 0\u2264p\u22641.\n\n\nIf we have only two values, these equations determine the usual\ntruth-tables for C and N.\n\nThree problems arose after discovering many-valued logic. The first\nconcerned its axiomatization and metalogical properties, the second\nits philosophical foundations and intuitive interpretation, and the\nthird its applications. Due to the work of \u0141ukasiewicz himself,\nWajsberg and S\u0142upecki, the first group of questions was largely\nsolved. Wajsberg showed that the formulas: CpCqp,\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNpNqCqp, CCCpNppp axiomatize\n\u01413 (three-valued propositional calculus). The same\nauthor proved that a finite \u0141n is axiomatizable if it\nincludes the theorems: CCpqCCqrCpr, CCCqrCCpqCpr,\nCCqqCpp, CCpqCNqNp, CNqCCpqNq. If\nn = \u21350, \u0141n can be\naxiomatized by (\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s conjecture, proved by\nWajsberg): CpCqp, CCpqCCqrCpr,\nCCCpqqqCCqpp, CCCpqCqpCqp, CCNpNqCqp.\nHowever, all of the above axiom-sets are functionally incomplete. The\nproblem was solved by S\u0142upecki for \u01413. He\nintroduced the new functor T defined by T1 =\nT\u00bd = T0 = \u00bd and added the formulas\nCTpNTp, CNTpTp to Wajsberg\u2019s axioms. All\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s many-valued logics are consistent.\nS\u0142upecki proved that \u01413 is Post-complete. Every\n\u0141n (n>2) is contained in two-valued logic,\nalthough the converse does not hold; for example, the formulas\nCCNpNp, CCNppp, CCpqCCpNqNp,\nCCpKNqNp, CcpEqNqNq are theorems in the two-valued\nsystem only. If n = \u21350, \u0141n\nis contained in every finite \u0141n.\n\nAt first, \u0141ukasiewicz called his three-valued logic\n\u201cNon-Aristotelian\u201d, but later he preferred the\nqualification \u201cNon-Chrysippean\u201d. According to\n\u0141ukasiewicz, the Stagirite himself doubted the validity of the\nprinciple of excluded middle in the domain of future contingents. On\nthe other hand, the Stoics believed that every proposition is true or\nfalse, independently of its temporal reference. Thus, the Stoics\naccepted the principle of bivalence in its unrestricted form. Now, the\nfoundation of two or many-valued logic lies not in this or that\nlogical theorem, but in metalogic; in particular, it is determined by\naccepting or rejecting the principle of bivalence. Whoever, as\nChrisippus did, accepts the validity of the principle of bivalence,\nopts for two-valued logic; whoever even partially rejects this\nprinciple, as Aristotle did, thereby opens the door to many-valued\nlogic. \u0141ukasiewicz took the side of Aristotle. However, this did\nnot close the problem of the interpretation of other logical values.\n\u0141ukasiewicz tried to go though indeterminism and causality. A\ntypical difficulty is the following. Take p as valued by\n\u00bd. Its negation also has the value \u00bd. The same holds for\nKpNp, contrary to the firm intuition that any pair of\ncontradictory sentences is false. Difficulties with interpretation\nchanged \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s primary view concerning the relation\nof many-valued logic to reality. At first, guided by a realistic\nepistemology of logic, he maintained that one of the rival logics\ncould be proved to be the correct description of the physical world.\nLater, he was rather inclined to look at logical systems as formalisms\nhaving their own problems deserving research and as useful devices for\nsolving various questions but not as something leading to the only\n\u201ctrue\u201d ontological scheme. Yet he believed that\nmany-valued logic would play a considerable role in the foundations of\nmathematics.\n3.3.1 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems\n\nLe\u015bniewski intended to a formulate the full logical system that\nwould serve as the basis for the whole of science, and in particular\nfor mathematics. This system consists of three parts (a) protothetic\n(a generalized propositional calculus); (b) ontology (a logic of\nterms); (c) mereology (a theory of parts and wholes). Protothetic is a\ncalculus in which quantifiers bind propositional variables and\nvariables referr to arbitrary functors constructible over the usual\nfunctors: that is, functors of propositional variables, functors of\nfunctors, etc. In general, if we start with the category of sentences\nalone, protothetical quantifiers bind variables of all further\ndefinable categories. The shortest axiom of protothetic (written in\nthe Russell-like symbolism) is the formula\n\n[pq] :: p \u2194 . q \u2194\n:.[f]:. f (pf (p [u].\nu)). \u2194 : [r]: f (qr). \u2194\n. q \u2194 p\n\n\n(Soboci\u0144ski). Protothetic is an absolute propositional calculus\nin the sense that the principle of bivalence is its theorem. In fact,\nprotothetic inspired \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s system with variable\nfunctors, another absolute propositional logic.\n\nIf we add the functor \u03b5 (read as \u201cis\u201d) forming\nsentences from two names, we obtain Le\u015bniewski\u2019s ontology\n(LO). The meaning of the constant \u03b5 is perhaps the most\nimportant matter for a proper understanding of LO. The epsilon\ncorresponds well to the sense of the copula \u201cest\u201d\nin Latin sentences of the type \u201cSocrates est\nhomo\u201d. The epsilon has no spatio-temporal connotations and\ndoes not indicate the membership relation or identity. The rendering\nof the epsilon by the English \u201cis\u201d may be misleading,\nbecause the latter is modified by articles. The axiomatic\ncharacterization of the meaning of the epsilon is given by\n\n(O)\n[Aa]:: (A \u03b5 a) \u2194\n:.[\u03a3B]. (B \u03b5 a):.\n[BC]: (B \u03b5 A). (C\n\u03b5 A). \u2192\n\n(B \u03b5 C):. [B]: (B\n\u03b5 A) \u2192. B \u03b5 a.\n\n\nIts simplified form (discovered by Soboci\u0144ski) is:\n\n(O\u2032)\n[Aa] A \u03b5a:\n\u2194.[\u03a3B]. (A \u03b5B).\n(B \u03b5a).\n\n\nThe right sides of (O) and (O\u2032) are conjunctions. The intuitive\ncontent of (O) is simple in spite of its formal complexity. It\nestablishes that the sentence \u201cA is a\u201d\nis equivalent to the following conditions (a) A is not an\nempty term; (b) there is only one A; (c) whatever is\nA, is also a. Thus, \u201cA is\na\u201d is a singular sentence which is true if and only if\n(a)-(c) hold. In particular, such a sentence is false if A is\na general or an empty term. On the other hand, (O) (or O\u2032) is\nvalid for all terms, even general or empty ones. Thus, LO is valid in\nall domains, including the empty one and can be regarded as the first\nsystem of free logic. In LO we can define two important concepts,\nnamely that of existence and that of being an object. This is done by\n(I use non-symbolic forms): (1) for any A, A exists\n= for some x, x is A; (2) for any\nA, A is an object = for some x, A\nis x. LO performs functions usually provided by predicate\nlogic. The meaning of the constant \u03b5 is sufficiently general\nto define identity and the inclusion of classes. Since these concepts\nare definable in elementary ontology, it is stronger than first-order\nlogic.\n\nMereology, assumes protothetic and ontology as logically prior\ntheories, and has the term \u201cpart of\u201d as its sole primitive\nconcept. Being a part is a non-reflexive and transitive relation.\nThere are no empty classes. Moreover, the class consisting of a single\nelement is identical with it. In general, mereology is a theory of\nsets in the collective (mereological) sense, contrary to ordinary set\ntheory, which describes sets in the distributive sense. The main\ndifference between the two interpretations of the term\n\u201cset\u201d consists in the fact that the membership relation is\ntransitive under the mereological reading, but non-transitive under\nthe distributive one. Le\u015bniewski believed that his theory classes\nwould perform all the tasks of ordinary set theory without generating\nparadoxes. In fact, he invented mereology when he tried to solved the\nRussell paradox. Since there are no mereological classes which are not\ntheir own elements, the question which led to the Russell paradox\nsimply makes no sense in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems. On the other\nhand, mereology is weaker than set theory.\n\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems have some formal features, even very\npeculiar ones in some respects. All are axiomatic. According to his\nnominalistic preferences, they are concrete physical objects.\nExpressions are always understood as sequences of concrete\ninscriptions. There are as many expressions as have been written; no\nexpression exists merely potentially. This view is called constructive\nnominalism. According to it, two intuitively equivalent systems, for\nexample, protothetic based on equivalence and protothetic based on\nimplication, are different systems. Every logical system, on\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s view, is not finished at any time because\nthere is always the possibility of adding new elements to it. Hence,\nthe rules for constructing and developing formal systems are of\ncrucial importance for Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logics. He understood\nthis very well and devoted much attention to explaining the details of\nhis formalization. Le\u015bniewski formulated his procedural\ndirectives purely syntactically and completely. Due to the role of\nequivalence, he was able to treat definitions as theorems. In general,\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems are commonly considered to be perfect\nfrom the point of view of the requirements of correct formalization.\nThe Le\u015bniewski project is a version of logicism.\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s three systems form a grand logic and provide a\nuniversal language to capture the whole of knowledge. It is certainly\nnot an orthodox system and lies on the margin of contemporary research\nin logic. Yet it continues to attract many logicians and philosophers.\nIn spite of their marginality, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems are\ninvestigated in all parts of the world.\n\nLe\u015bniewski suggested the theory of syntactic categories, later\ndeveloped by Ajdukiewicz in the early 1930s. This theory takes the\ncategories of sentences and names (for Ajdukiewicz, following\nLe\u015bniewski, there is no syntactic difference between proper names\nand common nouns) as fundamental and assigns the pointer s to\nsentences and n to names. Now functors have fractions as\npointers. For example, \u201cis\u201d has s/nn as its\ncategorial index; it says that \u201cis\u201d is a two-placed\nfunctor of two nominal arguments which forms a sentence. The\nconjunction as a propositional connective forming sentences from two\nother sentences has s/ss as its index. Consider now\nthe expression \u201cp and q\u201d. Write the\ncategorial indexes of its parts. We thus obtain the sequence:\ns s/ss s. Perform simplifications\nby divisions similar to dividing algebraic fractions. The letter\ns is the result. A simple algorithm says that an expression\nis syntactically coherent if and only if s or n is\nits index after performing all simplifications. Ajdukiewicz\u2019s\nquasi-arithmetical notation was the first system of categorial\ngrammar.\n",
