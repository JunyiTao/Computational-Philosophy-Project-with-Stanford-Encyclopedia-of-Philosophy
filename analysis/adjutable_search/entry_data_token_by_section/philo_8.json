    "main_text": "Philo and Philosophical Schools || Epicureanism\n3.4 Epicureanism\n\nEvidently, Philo felt no sympathy towards Epicureanism (L\u00e9vy,\nRanocchia 2008), an exclusively materialistic doctrine which denied\nthe existence of Providence and defined pleasure both as the first\nmotivator of human actions and as the supreme good. As if this was not\nenough, Epicureans also described gods as taking human form, which was\nfor Philo an indisputable case of idolatry. Nevertheless, his attitude\ntowards Epicureanism is at times more complex than one might expect.\nIn the first instance, his condemnation of Epicureanism is clear. In\nthe same sentence at Post. 2, he castigates Epicurean impiety\nalongside Egyptian atheism. In De providentia as well we find\nstrong elements of a refutation of Epicurean denial of Providence. And\nin Aet. 6\u20138, he draws a clear contrast between\nEpicureans who believe in the genesis and dissolution of worlds\ncreated by the chance of atomic collisions, and the Stoics, who\ndespite being materialists themselves, claim that the world is single\nand governed by Reason. In addition, atomism becomes an allegorical\ninstrument in the splendid exegesis of Moses killing the Egyptian\n(Fug. 148), where this episode becomes the symbol of the\nconfrontation between the doctrines of unity and of extreme\nfragmentation. The Egyptian, who symbolizes pleasure, is buried in the\nsand, symbol of atoms. Nothing in all this is truly unexpected. More\nsurprising, however, is the inclusion of the most complete exposition\nof the Epicurean version of oikei\u00f4sis in Opif.\n161, the doctrine of first adaptation to nature, probably of Stoic\norigin but also adopted by other schools. Moreover, despite many\nappearances, Philo does not consider pleasure an absolute evil. For\nhim, it has a place in the divine program of Creation since it plays\nan essential role in procreation. The error lay with those who would\ntransform a relative good into a perfect one.\n",
