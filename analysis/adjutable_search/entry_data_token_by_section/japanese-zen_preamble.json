    "main_text": "\n\nZen aims at the perfection of personhood. To this end, sitting\nmeditation called \u201cza-zen\u201d is employed as a\nfoundational method of pr\u0101xis across the different\nschools of this Buddha-Way\u2014which is not an ideology, but a way\nof living. Through za-zen the Zen practitioner attempts to\nembody non-discriminatory wisdom vis-\u00e0-vis the\nmeditational experience known as \u201csatori\u201d\n(enlightenment). A process of discovering wisdom culminates, among other things, in the\nexperiential apprehension of the equality of all thing-events.\n\nThe most distinguishing feature of this school of the Buddha-Way is\nits contention that wisdom, accompanied by compassion, is expressed in\nthe everyday lifeworld when associating with one\u2019s self, other\npeople, and nature. The everyday lifeworld for most\npeople is an evanescent transforming stage in which living is\nconsumed, philosophically speaking, by an either-or, ego-logical,\ndualistic paradigm of thinking with its attendant psychological states\nsuch as stress and anxiety. Zen demands an overcoming of this paradigm\nin practice by achieving a holistic and nondualistic perspective in\ncognition, so that the Zen practitioner can celebrate, with stillness\nof mind, a life directed toward the concrete thing-events of\neveryday life and nature. For this reason, the Zen practitioner is\nrequired to embody freedom expressive of the original human nature,\ncalled \u201cbuddha-nature.\u201d\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Zen cherishes simplicity and straightforwardness\nin grasping reality and acting on it \u201chere and now,\u201d for\nit believes that a thing-event that is immediately presencing\nbefore one\u2019s eyes or under one\u2019s foot is no other than an\nexpression of suchness. In other words the thing-event is disclosing\nits primordial mode of being such that it is as it is. It\nalso understands a specificity of the thing-event to be a recapitulation\nof the whole; parts and the whole are to be lived in an inseparable\nrelationship through an exercise of nondiscriminatory wisdom, without\nprioritizing the visible over the invisible, the explicit over the\nimplicit, or vice versa.\n\n\nAs such, Zen maintains a stance of \u201cnot one\u201d and\n\u201cnot two,\u201d that is \u201ca positionless position,\u201d\nwhere \u201cnot two\u201d means negating the dualistic stance that\ndivides the whole into two parts, while \u201cnot one\u201d means\nnegating the nondualistic stance occurring when the Zen practitioner\ndwells in the whole as one, while suspending judgment in\nmeditation. The free, bilateral movement between \u201cnot one\u201d and\n\u201cnot two\u201d characterizes Zen\u2019s achievement of a\npersonhood with a\nthird perspective that cannot, however, be confined to either\ndualism or non-dualism, neither \u201cnot one\u201d nor \u201cnot\ntwo\u201d. \n",
