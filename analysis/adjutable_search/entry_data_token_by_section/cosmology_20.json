    "main_text": "Anthropic Reasoning and Multiverse || Multiverse\n4.3 Multiverse\n\nThe multiverse response replaces a single, apparently finely-tuned\nuniverse within an ensemble of universes, combined with an appeal to\nanthropic selection. Suppose that all possible values of the\nfundamental constants are realized in individual elements of the\nensemble. Many of these universes will be inhospitable to life. In\ncalculating the probabilities that we observe specific values of the\nfundamental constants, we need only consider the subset of universe\ncompatible with the existence of complexity (or some more specific\nfeature associated with life). If we have some way of assigning\nprobabilities over the ensemble, we could then calculate the\nprobability associated with our measured values. These calculations\nwill resolve the fine-tuning puzzles if they show that we observe\ntypical values for a complex (or life-permitting) universe.\n\nMany cosmologists have argued in favor of a specific version of the\nmultiverse called eternal inflation\n (EI).[51]\n On this view, the rapid expansion hypothesized by inflationary\ncosmology continues until arbitrarily late times in some regions, and\ncomes to an end (with a transition to slower expansion) in others.\nThis leads to a global structure of \u201cpocket\u201d universes\nembedded within a larger multiverse.\n\nOn this line of thought, the multiverse should be accepted for the\nsame reason we accept many claims about what we cannot directly\nobserve\u2014namely, as an inevitable consequence of an established\nphysical theory. It is not clear, however, that EI is inevitable, as\nnot all inflationary models, arguably including those favored by CMB\nobservations, have the kind of potential that leads to\n EI.[52]\n Accounts of how inflation leads to EI rely on speculative\n physics.[53]\n Furthermore, if inflation does lead to EI, that threatens to\nundermine the original reasons for accepting inflation (Smeenk 2014):\nrather than the predictions regarding the state produced at the end of\ninflation taken to provide evidence for inflation, EI seems to imply\nthat, as Guth (2007) put it, in EI \u201canything that can happen\nwill happen; in fact, it will happen an infinite number of\ntimes\u201d.\n\nThere have been two distinct approaches to recovering some empirical\ncontent in this\n situation.[54]\n First, there may be traces of the early formation of the pocket\nuniverses, the remnants of collisions between neighboring\n\u201cbubbles\u201d, left on the CMB sky (Aguirre & Johnson\n2011). Detection of a distinctive signature that cannot be explained\nby other means would provide evidence for the multiverse. However,\nthere is no expectation that a multiverse theory would generically\npredict such traces; for example, if the collision occurs too early\nthe imprint is erased by subsequent inflationary expansion.\n\nThe other approach regards predictions for the fundamental constants,\nsuch as Weinberg\u2019s prediction of \\(\\Lambda\\) discussed above.\nThe process of forming the pocket universes is assumed to yield\nvariation in the local, low-energy physics in each pocket. Predictions\nfor the values of the fundamental constants follow from two things:\n(1) a specification of the probabilities for different values of the\nconstant over the ensemble, and (2) a treatment of the selection\neffect imposed by restricting consideration to pocket universes with\nobservers and then choosing a \u201ctypical\u201d observer.\n\nThe aim is to obtain probabilistic predictions for what a typical\nobserver should see in the EI multiverse. Yet there are several\nchallenges to overcome, alongside those mentioned above related to\nanthropics. The assumption that the formation of pocket universes\nleads to variation in constants is just an assumption, which is not\nyet justified by a plausible, well-tested dynamical theory. The most\nwidely discussed challenge in the physics literature is the\n\u201cmeasure problem\u201d: roughly, how to assign\n\u201csize\u201d to different regions of the multiverse, as a first\nstep towards assigning probabilities. It is difficult to define a\nmeasure because the EI multiverse is usually taken to be an infinite\nensemble, lacking in the kinds of structure used in constructing a\nmeasure. On our view, these unmet challenges undercut the hope that\nthe EI multiverse yields probabilistic predictions. And without such\nan account, the multiverse proposal does not have any testable\nconsequences. If everything happens somewhere in the ensemble, then\nany potential observation is compatible with the theory.\n\nSupposing that we grant a successful resolution of all these\nchallenges, the merits of a multiverse solution of fine-tuning\nproblems could then be evaluated by comparison with competing ideas.\nThe most widely cited evidence in favor of a multiverse is\nWeinberg\u2019s prediction for the value of \\(\\Lambda\\), discussed\nabove. There are other proposals to explain the observed value of\n\\(\\Lambda\\); Wang, Zhu, and Unruh (2017), for example, treat the\nquantum vacuum as extremely inhomogeneous, and argue that resonance\namong the vacuum fluctuations leads to a small \\(\\Lambda\\).\n\nThe unease many have about multiverse proposals are only reinforced by\nthe liberal appeals to \u201cinfinities\u201d in discussion of the\n idea.[55]\n Many have argued, for example, that we must formulate an account of\nanthropic reasoning that applies to a truly infinite, rather than\nmerely very large, universe. Claims that we occupy one of infinitely\nmany possible pocket universes, filled with an infinity of other\nobservers, rest on an enormous and speculative extrapolation. Such\nclaims fail to take seriously the concept of infinity, which is not\nmerely a large number. Hilbert (1925 [1983]) emphasized that while\ninfinity is required to complete mathematics, it does not occur\nanywhere in the accessible physical universe. One response is\nto require that infinities in cosmology should have a restricted use.\nIt may be useful to introduce infinity as part of an explanatory\naccount of some aspect of cosmology, as is common practice in\nmathematical models that introduce various idealizations. Yet this\ninfinity should be eliminable, such that the explanation of the\nphenomena remains valid when the idealization is\n removed.[56]\n Even for those who regard this demand as too stringent, there\ncertainly needs to be more care in clarifying and justifying claims\nregarding infinities.\n\nIn sum, interest in the multiverse stems primarily from speculations\nabout the consequences of inflation for the global structure of the\nuniverse. The main points of debate regard whether EI is a disaster\nfor inflation, undermining the possibility of testing inflation at\nall, and how much predictions such as that for \\(\\Lambda\\) lend\ncredence to these\n speculations.[57]\n Resolution of these questions is needed to decide whether the\nmultiverse can be tested in a stronger sense, going beyond the special\ncases (such as bubble collisions) that may provide more direct\nevidence.\n",
