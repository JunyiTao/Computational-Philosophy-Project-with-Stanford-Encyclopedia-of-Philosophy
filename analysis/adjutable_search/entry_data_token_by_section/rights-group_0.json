    "main_text": "Identifying group rights\n1. Identifying group rights\n\nA group right is a right possessed by a group qua group rather than by\nits members severally. It contrasts with a right held by an individual\nperson as an individual. An example of a commonly asserted group right\nis the right of a nation or a people to be self-determining. If there\nis such a right, it is a right possessed and exercised by a nation or\na people as a group. It will not be reducible to the individually-held\nrights to individual self-determination of those who belong to the\nrelevant nation or people. Other rights that have often been asserted\nas group rights include the right of a cultural group that its culture\nshould be respected and perhaps protected; the right of a linguistic\ngroup that its language should be usable and provided for in the\npublic domain; and the right of a religious group that it should be\nfree to engage in collective expressions of its faith. Groups rights\nare also claimed for organized groups such as commercial corporations,\nchurches, political parties, universities and charitable associations.\nIn each of these cases, the right is a right held by the group qua\ngroup, and duties generated by the right will be duties owed to the\ngroup.\n\nGroup rights should not be confused with rights that people possess in\nvirtue of being group members. People normally possess rights as\nmembers of universities or sports clubs or businesses or trade unions\nor churches or states but, in the ordinary run of cases, these are\nindividual rights. For example, the right of a member of a university\nto use its library, or the right of a citizen to vote in elections, is\nthe right of an individual person. An infringement of that right would\ninfringe the right of the individual right-holder, rather than a group\nright of the relevant university or state. In fact, most rights held\nby individuals are associated with group identities or group\nmemberships of some sort. If we are willing to extend rights to\nnon-human animals, even human rights will be rights unique to a\nparticular group; yet most human rights are conceived as individual\nrights and, on some views, can only be individual rights.\n\nA group right should not therefore be identified with a\n\u201cgroup-differentiated\u201d right. That term has been coined by\nWill Kymlicka (1995) to describe a right that is accorded to a\nparticular group but not to the larger society within which the group\nexists. For example, a society might accord special rights, such as\nspecial territorial rights or rights of self-government, to an\nindigenous minority in recognition of the special status that that\nminority should enjoy within the larger society, or out of concern for\nthe vulnerability of its traditional form of life. These would be\n\u201cgroup-differentiated rights\u201d. That term is now sometimes\nabbreviated to \u201cgroup right\u201d, which is unfortunate since a\ngroup-differentiated right may or may not be a group right properly\nso-called. If, for example, the group-differentiated right is the\nright of a group to be self-governing, it will also be a group right.\nBut if it is, for example, a right unique to the members of an\nindigenous minority to fish in certain waters and if that right is\nvested in, and is exercisable by, the several individuals who make up\nthe minority, it will be a group-differentiated individual right.\n(Kymlicka 1995, 45\u201348; Jones 2010.)\n",
