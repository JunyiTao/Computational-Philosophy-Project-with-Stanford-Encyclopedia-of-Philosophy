    "main_text": "Aristotle\n2. Aristotle\n\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistics can be seen as a formal study of the\nmeaning of the four basic quantifier expressions all,\nno, some, not all, and of their properties. For\nexample, the validity, according to Aristotle, of the syllogism\n\n\nall(A,B)\nall(B,C)\n\nsome(A,C)\n\n\n\nshows that he considered, in contrast with modern logical usage, all\nto have existential import, so\nthat All A are B entails that A\nis not an empty term. Likewise, the\nvalidity of the syllogism\n\n\nsome(A,B)\nall(B,C)\n\nall(A,C)\n\n\n\nexpresses that some is monotone\nincreasing (as we now put it) in the second argument. Each valid\nsyllogism formalizes part of the meaning of these quantifier\nexpressions, but Aristotle\u2019s study of their properties went\nbeyond the syllogistics. He observed, for example, that some\nand no\nare convertible or, as we might now say, symmetric,\nsince they satisfy the scheme\n\n\nQ(A,B)\n\nQ(B,A)\n\n\n\nin contrast with all and not\nall. Further, he studied how various\nforms of negation combined with quantifier expressions in\n(what was later called) the square of\n opposition.[4]\n Medieval logicians continued in Aristotle\u2019s tradition, but also\nextended syllogistic reasoning to cases where A,B\ncould themselves be quantified expressions, thus\ndealing with premises and conclusions like Some\ndonkey of every man doesn\u2019t run (example\nfrom John Buridan, 14th century). Even though Aristotelian logic falls\nshort of the expressivity and precision of modern logic, the\nsyllogistics certainly was a decisive contribution to the study of\nquantification. In fact, syllogistic systems of various expressive\npower have recently been studied in mathematical logic, precisely\nbecause of their affinity to natural reasoning and their simple\ncomputational properties; see\n section 18\n below.\n\nEspecially interesting in the present context is the fact that these\nquantifier expressions take two arguments or terms, and thus\ncan be seen as binary relations, both syntactically (as\nAristotle no doubt saw them) and semantically: given that terms\nsignify sets of individuals, the expression some\ncan be taken to signify the relation of overlap,\ni.e., of having non-empty intersection, between two sets, and all\nsignifies the inclusion relation. Note\nthat these are not relations between individuals but between sets of\nindividuals\u2014second-order relations. Indeed, they are\nexactly the generalized quantifiers some and all,\nrespectively (on a given universe).\n\nThis thread\u2014that quantifier expressions signify second-order\nrelations\u2014was not picked up by any of Aristotle\u2019s medieval\nfollowers (as far as we know). Instead, they picked up on the fact\nthat the two terms have different status: the first combines with the\nquantifier expression to form a noun phrase (as we now say), which is\nthe subject of the sentence, whereas the second is a verb\nphrase constituting the predicate. This led them to focus on\nwhat the subject\u2014all men, some\ndogs, no\nsailors\u2014signified, which conceptually seems to be a\nharder question. One might surmise that all\nmen signifies every man (or the set of men), and that some\ndogs signifies some particular dog, but\nwhat about no sailors? In fact, one\ncan show that approaches like these are doomed to\n failure.[5]\n The modern \u201csolution\u201d is that noun phrases signify\nsets of sets of individuals, so that, for example some\ndogs signifies the set of sets\ncontaining at least one dog\u2014but that appears to require a more\nabstract and mathematical approach to semantics than the idea, which\nis at least implicit in Aristotle, that quantifier phrases signify\nrelations between (the denotations of) terms.\n",
