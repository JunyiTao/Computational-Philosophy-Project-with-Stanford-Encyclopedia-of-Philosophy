    "main_text": "Language and Truth || Language and Philosophy\n2.1 Language and Philosophy\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll look at Austin\u2019s views about the\nrole of the study of language in philosophy more generally. It is\ncommon to count Austin as an \u201cOrdinary Language\nPhilosopher\u201d, along with, for example, Gilbert Ryle, P.F.\nStrawson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. However, although each of these\nthinkers was sometimes concerned, in one or another way, with our use\nof ordinary language, it is far from clear what in addition to that\nthe label is supposed to entail. And it is equally unclear that the\nvarious thinkers so-labelled deserve to be grouped together.\n\nAustin cared about language for two main reasons. First, language use\nis a central part of human activity, so it\u2019s an important topic\nin its own right. Second, the study of language is an\naide\u2014indeed, for some topics, an important preliminary\u2014to\nthe pursuit of philosophical topics. Many of Austin\u2019s most\ndistinctive reflections on the use of language arise in the course of\ndiscussion of other topics (see especially his \u201cA Plea for\nExcuses\u201d 1957).\n\nOne route to understanding Austin\u2019s general approach to\nphilosophy is provided by reflection on the following comment by\nStuart Hampshire:\n\n\n[Austin] was constitutionally unable to refrain from applying the same\nstandards of truth and accuracy to a philosophical argument, sentence\nby sentence, as he would have applied to any other serious\nsubject-matter. He could not have adopted a special tone of voice, or\nattitude of mind, for philosophical questions. (Hampshire 1960:\n34)\n\n\nIn short, it mattered to Austin that, in attempting to make out\npositions and arguments, philosophers should meet ordinary standards\nof truth, accuracy, and so forth. On the one hand, this presented a\ngeneral challenge to philosophers, a challenge that they might easily\nfail to meet. The challenge is either to make use of an ordinary\nvocabulary, or ordinary concepts, in order to make claims or judgments\nthat are, according to ordinary standards, at least true (or accurate,\netc.); or to do the serious work required to set up an appropriate\ntechnical vocabulary and then use it to say things that are by\nappropriate standards true (accurate, etc.). On the other hand, it\nprovided Austin with what he took to be a reasonably secure approach\nto general philosophical questions: first, find a connection between\nthose general philosophical questions and the more specific claims or\njudgments that we ordinarily make and take ourselves to be secure in\nmaking; second, make sufficiently many of the relevant claims or\njudgments, in a sufficient variety of circumstances, in order to\naddress the general philosophical questions.\n\nAustin held that, in their hurry to address general philosophical\nquestions, philosophers have a tendency to ignore the nuances involved\nin making and assessing ordinary claims and judgments. Among the risks\nassociated with insensitivity to the nuances, two stand out. First,\nphilosophers are liable to miss distinctions that are made in our\nordinary use of language and that are relevant to our concerns and\nclaims. Second, failure to exploit fully the resources of ordinary\nlanguage can make philosophers susceptible to seemingly forced choices\nbetween unacceptable alternatives. Here Austin warns:\n\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind\u2026the general rule that we must not\nexpect to find simple labels for complicated cases\u2026however\nwell-equipped our language, it can never be forearmed against all\npossible cases that may arise and call for description: fact is richer\nthan diction. (1957: 195)\n\n\nOn Austin\u2019s view, language is likely to be well designed for the\nends to which it is ordinarily put. But special, or especially\ncomplicated, cases may require special treatment. This is apt to be an\nespecial liability when it comes to the question whether a sentence\ncan be used in a particular circumstance to state something true or\nfalse:\n\n\nWe say, for example, that a certain statement is exaggerated or vague\nor bold, a description somewhat rough or misleading or not very good,\nan account rather general or too concise. In cases like these it is\npointless to insist on deciding in simple terms whether the statement\nis \u201ctrue or false\u201d. Is it true or false that Belfast is\nnorth of London? That the galaxy is the shape of a fried egg? That\nBeethoven was a drunkard? That Wellington won the battle of Waterloo?\nThere are various degrees and dimensions of success in making\nstatements: the statements fit the facts always more or less loosely,\nin different ways on different occasions for different intents and\npurposes. (1950a: 129\u2013130)\n\n\nAustin makes two points here. First, when faced with a putative choice\nof this sort, we should not insist on deciding in simple\nterms whether a statement is true or false (or whether an\nexpression applies or fails to apply to something). Some cases are\ncomplicated, and, in some of those cases, we are capable of meeting\nsome of the complications by saying more: \u201cWell, it is true that\nBelfast is north of London if you understand that claim in the\nfollowing way\u2026.\u201d Second, the complications can take\ndifferent forms, and can matter in different ways, on different\noccasions. Given the prior course of our conversation, and our\nspecific intents and purposes in discussing the issue, it might be\nmanifest that, on that particular occasion, we will\nunderstand the complications, without a need for their\narticulation, so that the following is fine as it stands: \u201cYes,\nit is true that Belfast is north of London.\u201d\n\nAustin\u2019s summarised his view of the role of attention to\nordinary language in philosophy thus:\n\n\nFirst, words are our tools, and, as a minimum, we should use clean\ntools: we should know what we mean and what we do not, and we must\nforearm ourselves against the traps that language sets us. Secondly,\nwords are not (except in their own little corner) facts or things: we\nneed therefore to prise them off the world, to hold them apart from\nand against it, so that we can realize their inadequacies and\narbitrariness, and can re-look at the world without blinkers. Thirdly,\nand more hopefully, our common stock of words embodies all the\ndistinctions men have found worth drawing, and the connexions they\nhave found worth making, in the lifetimes of many generations: these\nsurely are likely to be more sound, since they have stood up to the\nlong test of the survival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in\nall ordinary and reasonably practical matters, than any that you or I\nare likely to think up in our arm-chairs of an afternoon\u2014the\nmost favoured alternative method. (1957:\n 181\u2013182)[1]\n\n\nAustin holds, then, that an important preliminary to philosophising on\nat least some topics\u2014for instance, where the topic is\n\u201cordinary and reasonably practical\u201d\u2014would be the\ndetailed study of the language we use to speak on that topic, and of\nthe way that we use it.\n\nAustin didn\u2019t think that the investigation of language was more\nthan a preliminary to theorising, either in philosophy or science. He\nwasn\u2019t averse to theory construction, even if its outcome were\npotentially revisionary (see e.g., 1957: 189). His concern was only\nthat such theorising should be properly grounded, and that it should\nnot be driven, for example, by an initial failure to keep track of\ndistinctions that we mark in our ordinary use of language. Further,\nAustin draws an important distinction between \u201cwords and facts\nor things,\u201d and he seems to suggest that we have ways of\ninvestigating the world\u2014that is, facts and things\u2014which\ncan bypass the \u201cblinkers\u201d sometimes imposed on us by our\nwords. We\u2019ll return to Austin\u2019s distinction between the world,\nincluding facts\u2014which Austin thinks of as particular or\nconcrete\u2014and words, including the statements we make in using\nwords, in \n section 2.2. \n And we\u2019ll return to Austin\u2019s idea that we can\nhave unblinkered awareness of the world\u2014unblinkered, that is, by\nthe linguistic or judgmental capacities that we bring to bear on what\nwe experience\u2014in \n section 3.1.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Austin\u2019s work has been caught up in\nthe stampede away from broadly ordinary language-based approaches to\nphilosophical questions. The work of Paul Grice, collected in his\nStudies in the Way of Words (1989), has played an important\nrole in the negative assessment of such approaches, including aspects\nof Austin\u2019s work. One central idea in Grice\u2019s work is that\nthe ways in which we use language\u2014crudely, the pairings of\nsituations and sentences that we find appropriate or inappropriate, or\nwhat we would or wouldn\u2019t say in those situations\u2014is not a\nsimple function of the nature of the respective situations and the\ncorrectness conditions with which the sentences are associated.\nRather, judgments about appropriateness are driven also by, for\nexample, our sensitivities to the demands of rational co-operation\nwith our conversational partners. And it has been thought that, in one\nor another way, ordinary language philosophers, including Austin, have\nbeen insensitive to the additional parameters to which judgments of\nappropriateness are beholden (for early attacks of this sort, see Ayer\n1967 and Searle 1966). It is beyond the scope of this entry to attempt\nto assess either the extent to which Austin should really be seen as a\ntarget of such objections or, if he should, whether they demonstrate\nweaknesses in his work. However, in pursuing any such assessment, it\nis important to note that Austin\u2019s exploitation of ordinary\nlanguage is never driven by simple appeal to whether, in a situation\nconsidered as a whole, we would take it to be simply appropriate or\ninappropriate to use some sentence or other. Rather, Austin\nis\u2014as we are\u2014sensitive to more fine-grained appraisals of\nuses of bits of language and, when he judges that an utterance on an\noccasion would be false or nonsensical, he intends that judgment to\ncontrast with less damaging negative appraisals\u2014for example,\nabout what it would be merely inappropriate or impolite to say.\nMoreover, Austin is sensitive to the specific features of situations\nupon which we base one or another more fine-grained appraisal of uses\nof sentences. As he stresses, \u201cIt takes two to make a\ntruth\u201d (1950a: 124 fn.1). And Austin is sensitive to the details\nof both participants in that and other forms of transaction between\nword and\n world.[2]\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s approach to philosophical questions,\nwith reference to his classification as an ordinary language\nphilosopher, see Berlin 1973b; Cavell 1965; Garvey 2014; Grice 1989:\n3\u201321; Gustafsson 2011; Hampshire 1960, 1965; Kaplan 2018: 1\u201339; Longworth 2018a; Marion 2009; Martin\nms (Other Internet Resources); Pears 1962; Pitcher 1973; Putnam 1994;\nQuine 1965; Reimer 2018; Searle 1966; Soames 2003: 171\u2013219; Travis 1991;\nUrmson 1965, 1967; Urmson and Warnock 1961; Warnock 1973a, 1989:\n2\u201310; White 1967.)\n",
