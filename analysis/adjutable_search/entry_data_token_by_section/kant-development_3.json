Dynamic Debut: \u201cRadiation in the Inverse Square\u201d\nKant\u2019s own intent was to understand the powers of nature and he set\nout to solve the puzzle of force. The Thoughts on the True\nEstimation of Living Forces was a contribution to the\nso-called vis-viva-controversy; its goal was to settle the\nissue once and for all. The issue was as simple as it is profound:\nwhat is force, and how can it be measured?\nThe controversy had begun in the previous century and was rife\nthrough the entirety of the modern period. Following the implications\nof his mechanical description of physical substances, Descartes\nargued that force is reducible to the mathematical quantity of motion\nobservable in matter. Descartes contended that this quantity is\nconserved in the universe. Nature is matter in motion, and motion is\nthe explanatory principle. \u201cForce\u201d is the product of mass\nand velocity (mv), a quantity called \u201cquantity of\nmotion\u201d or \u201cdead pressure\u201d then and momentum\nnow.[11] Beyond\nthis, for Descartes, \u201cforce\u201d has no further\nmeaning. Cartesian essence can be isolated to physical and mental\nsubstances and force is neither of these. Force is not a dynamic\nessence, nor an essence at all. It is merely a quantity of motion\ncalculable in another substance.  By his rendering, Descartes reduced\nphysics to kinematics.\nLeibniz rejected the Cartesian formulation. When examining rising\nand falling bodies, he recognized that their behavior reveals a\ndifferent quantity, derived from Galileo\u2019s law of fall, which is the\nproduct of mass and velocity squared (mv\u00b2). Leibniz\nthought this implied Descartes\u2019s quantity to be false and that\nonly mv\u00b2, not mv, is conserved. Leibniz called\nthis new quantity \u201cliving force\u201d (vis viva); we\ncall it kinetic energy now. Force is real, he argued, and it is more\nthan a quantity (mv of Decartes)\u2014 it is the basic\nquality of nature and its activity can be observed in nature. Leibniz\nexpanded physics to a dynamics.\nLeibniz was correct about rising and falling bodies, but the\nCartesians (Descartes had died in 1650) pointed to other experiments\nin support of the mv-formula. Unfortunately for the early\ndebate, the issue could not be decided\u2014because both sides had\nbeen right; there is both momentum and kinetic energy. So the\narguments continued for decades. After Leibniz\u2019s death (1716), the\ncontroversy continued through his followers, who quarreled with the\ncurrent crop of French Cartesians. Newtonians were split over vis\nviva; Newton and his British fans rejected it, while continental\nNewtonians accepted it.  After Newton\u2019s death (1727), in the 1740s,\nthe issue was settled\u2014in Newton\u2019s favor. D\u2019Alembert proved that\nthere is a place for both quantities in physics (1743). Before that,\nEuler (1737) had already found out that Descartes\u2019s momentum is\nNewton\u2019s force acting over time, and Leibniz\u2019s kinetic energy is\nNewton\u2019s force acting through space. It did take, however, a while\nbefore this information spread and became generally accepted. The\ndebate died down around the time Kant published the Living\nForces (1749).\nKant\u2019s debut was one of the many attempts at settling the dispute,\nbut for all practical purposes, it was a failure. The Living\nForces appeared too late to make any difference, and Kant was\nunaware of d\u2019Alembert\u2019s and Euler\u2019s research. But what doomed the book\nin the public eye was that Kant seemed to have bet on the wrong team\nof horses. He argued for a synthesis of Cartesian kinematics and\nLeibnizian dynamics, and did so at the expense of Newtonian mechanics.\nAt the time he grasped Newton\u2019s ideas only partially. He did not yet\nunderstand that motion, like rest, is a state (something Galileo had\ndiscovered) and that force is needed only for changing, not for\nkeeping a state (which is Newton\u2019s first law of motion). He not only\nimplicitly rejected Newton through such mistakes, but also explicitly\nquestions his authority (preface, 1:7). Later in the book, he\ncriticizes the first law of motion (#50\u201351, #97\u20138),\nsuggests an alternative to Newtonian inertia (#124\u20135,\n#132\u20133), and dismisses as a \u201cdesperate excuse\u201d\nNewton\u2019s view that loss of motion reveals nature\u2019s entropic tendency\n(#50; 1:59). He tried to determine force without even mentioning the\nsecond law of motion that defines it as the product of mass and\nacceleration. For Kant, Newtonian mechanics was irrelevant. While\nthere are hundreds of references to Descartes and Leibniz in the book,\nthe references to Newton can be counted on the fingers of one\nhand.\nIn fact, however, Kant was not as mistaken as it seemed at the\ntime.  For one thing, he arrived essentially at the same conclusion as\nd\u2019Alembert and Euler: both mv and mv\u00b2 are\nlegitimate, determinable quantities. More importantly, he proposed a\ndeep connection. While showing in chapter 2 that Descartes\u2019s quantity\nis empirically well supported, he argued in chapter 3 that Leibniz\u2019s\nquantity must be factored in to arrive at a full qualitative\nunderstanding of force. \u201cActive force\u201d is jointly\nmeasurable as \u201cdead pressure\u201d and \u201cliving\nforce\u201d\u2014the full account of force requires a synthesis of\nCartesian kinematics and Leibnizian dynamics, notwithstanding their\nconflicts.\nThat is, Kant not only regarded momentum and energy as relevant\nquantities, as d\u2019Alembert had done, but he grasped that their union\npoints to the universal nature of force. This was sharper than even\nEuler\u2019s insight. Euler had discovered that these quantities are\nderivable from Newtonian force and that there is accordingly a\nquantitative connection among them. But Kant invested this connection\nwith qualitative meaning, arguing that the structure of nature must\nbe understood in dynamic terms, and that Newton really misses the\npoint.  The title of the book, \u201cThoughts on the True Estimation\nof Living Forces\u201d is no idle boast, for Kant\u2019s \u201ctrue\nestimation\u201d is the insight that \u201cliving force\u201d and\n\u201cdead pressure\u201d are two sides of the same\ncoin. Throughout the book, he wrestles with the harmony of opposites,\nCartesian kinematics and Leibnizian dynamics, trying to marry\nmomentum and energy\u2014while having the audacity to criticize\nNewton. This is the thrust of the work. Taken as a prediction, it is\nsuperb. With his first publication, Kant intuited not only that\nmatter is ultimately energetic, but also that its dynamic measure is\nmomentum-energy.[12]\nThis aper\u00e7u was no lucky guess. Kant understood what force\ninvolves.  He argues that force is the essence of action (#4). This\naction is a pulse that \u201cbroadens out\u201d\n(#9\u201310). Out-broadening of force (ausbreiten; 1:24.23)\nis an out-stretching of space (Ausdehnung; 1:24.6). Force\nmakes the continuum, being governed, in turn, by the created\nstructure (#10). This shift in understanding the nature of force\ncorrespondingly alters the nature one must think of material objects\nand dynamic interaction. The origin and source is force, and not\nsubstance, as the Cartesians had insisted. Force is responsible for\nsubstance, quantification and laws of nature\u2014not the other way\naround. In this bold thesis Kant anticipates his more famous\n\u201cCopernican turn\u201d\u2014an inversion of the way we view\nnature\u2014but in this context he is still working in the field of\nnatural philosophy of his day. Dynamic interaction turns force into a\nfield and the void into a plenum. Kant anticipated that\nmomentum-energy is the substantial correlate of spacetime. Bypassing\nNewton, he caught up with \nEinstein.[13]\nConnected with this apercu is the proposed bond of force and\nspace\u2014\u201cforce\u201d understood as momentum-energy, Kant\u2019s\nactive essence of substance, and \u201cspace\u201d defined as Kant\u2019s\ndimensional continuum. For Kant, force grips the void, holding it as a\ndimensional presence that localizes the original pulse. Force extends\nspace, ordering it, and space places force, governing it. Space\ndynamically expands; force structurally acts. Each needs the other.\nWithout force, space would lack structure (Abmessungen\nor Dimensionen, #9\u201310) and could not place a world\n(#7\u20139, 11). Without space, force could not be a field\n(#10). Force is spaced and space is forced. This is their bond\n(1:23\u20134).  Indeed: mass stretches spacetime, and spacetime grips\nmass.\nIn fact, Kant caught up with modern physics in several regards.\nAnother of his insights is so basic that it is easy to miss. He\ndefended force as the interactive matrix of nature and insisted on the\nimportance of dynamics. The dynamic ontology of the Living\nForces was ridiculed in its day, for Newton\u2019s mechanics had\ndigested Kepler\u2019s celestial dynamics and marginalized Leibniz\u2019s\nphysical dynamics. Yet Kant\u2019s stance would mark out the future course\nof science. We do not regard nature as a collection of particles and\nforces in empty space anymore, but instead as a system of\nenergy-pulses interacting in fields. Dynamics has turned out to be\nfundamental.\nWhen examining the force-space bond in detail (#10), Kant\ndiscovered the law of free point source radiation (1:24.19\u201323),\nhistorically the first generalization of the individual inverse-square\nlaws in natural philosophy:\nThe pressure of any point-source radiation in a free field drops at\na rate that is inversely proportional to the square of the propagated\ndistance.[14]\nKant\u2019s generalization unites Kepler\u2019s law of photo measurement\n(1604), Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation (1697), and Coulomb\u2019s\nlater law of electrostatic force (1785) as instantiations of the\nspread of energy.[15]\n Kant\u2019s law governs multiple forms of\nfree radiation, not just light, gravity, and electrostatic force, but\nalso radioactivity, radio waves, and sound.  Its most famous\napplication, in its first, Keplerian, instantiation, was Hubble\u2019s\nmeasure of the luminosity of distant variable stars\n(1924)\u2014which led to the discoveries of cosmic expansion and the\nBig Bang.\nIn the concluding reflection of the pivotal tenth section of\nthe Living Forces, Kant recognized the contingency of the\npressure-propagation ratio (1:24.26\u20138), inferred that other\nratios would generate continua with other dimensions\n(1:24.28\u201330), and surmised that a science in command of the\ndimensional range would be the highest geometry achievable\n(1:24.31\u20133). In light of quantum geometry and its modern\nguises\u2014superstring and M-theories\u2014this last remark might\nwell have been Kant\u2019s most far-sighted prediction. Despite suffering\nfrom insufficient scientific training, the rejection by his advisor,\nthe academic failure, and the catastrophe in his family, Kant\u2019s\nphilosophical debut in 1749 reveals the mark of genius.\n",
