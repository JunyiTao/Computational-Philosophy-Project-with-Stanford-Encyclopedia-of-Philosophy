    "main_text": "Philosophical accounts of levels of organization || The layer-cake account\n2.1 The layer-cake account\n\nIn the classic paper \u201cThe Unity of Science as a Working\nHypothesis\u201d (1958; see also the entry\n The Unity of Science),\n Oppenheim and Putnam (hereafter O&P) put forward a system of\nlevels that became very influential, and is still implicitly present\nin many references to levels. This \u201clayer-cake\u201d model\ncomprises three components. First, their conception of levels was\ncomprehensive, meaning they wished to subsume all instances\nof where one could talk of \u2018levels\u2019 into their account.\nSecond, O&P posited that levels are related via compositional\nrelations that are structured in a stepwise fashion. That is,\nall constituents of the objects of study of one branch of science, or,\nthe branch\u2019s \u201cuniverse of discourse\u201d, are\nexhaustively related as wholes to the parts located at the next\nadjacent lower level, and as themselves parts to the constituents\noccurring at the next adjacent higher level. This component is\nprobably most responsible for the \u201clayer-cake\u201d moniker.\nFinally, O&P presumed a strict correspondence between the\nconstituents comprising a level and the predicates and theories linked\nwith these constituents, meaning that levels of science neatly map\nonto levels of nature, so that for each level in nature there is\ncorresponding science or theory and vice versa (Craver 2007:\n174\u2013175; Brigandt 2010: 304\u2013305).\n\nO&P\u2019s usage of \u2018levels\u2019 can be broken down into\ntwo roles within their framework. The first concerns their use of\n\u2018levels\u2019 in their explication of reduction, i.e.,\nmicroreduction, which in turn aided in articulating their thesis of\nunity of science (1958: 5\u20136). In this framework, O&P suggest\nordering the branches of sciences so that the major potential\nreductions standing between the current situation and unified science\ncan be identified. For this purpose, they propose six \u201creductive\nlevels\u201d (1958: 9): Social groups; (Multicellular) living things;\nCells; Molecules; Atoms; Elementary particles. The branch of science\nwith the things of a given level as its universe of discourse is a\npotential \u201cmicroreducer\u201d of a branch with the things of\nthe next higher level as its universe of discourse (O&P 1958:\n9).\n\nO&P\u2019s second use of levels is to capture a natural epistemic\nordering of the sciences:\n\n\nThe idea of reductive levels employed in our discussion suggests what\nmay plausibly be regarded as a natural order of sciences. For\nthis purpose, it suffices to take as \u2018fundamental\ndisciplines\u2019 the branches corresponding to our levels. It is\nunderstandable that many of the well-known orderings of things have a\nrough similarity to our reductive levels, and that corresponding\norderings of sciences are more or less similar to our order of 6\n\u2018fundamental disciplines\u2019. (O&P 1958: 28, emphasis\nadded)\n\n\nThis shows that O&P assumed that the structure of the sciences\nfollows the structure of nature. Though they acknowledge the numerous\nprecedents to this hierarchical ordering of the sciences (e.g.,\nComte\u2019s pyramid of the sciences, 1958: 28), O&P considered\ntheir layer-cake account to be superior to these other\n\u201cintuitive\u201d senses of the order of sciences, since the\nexistence of levels themselves are grounded in the stepwise,\ncompositional continuity of nature.\n\nThe problems with the layer-cake account have been well-documented\n(Craver 2007: 172\u20136; Kim 2002; Potochnik & McGill 2012;\nRueger & McGivern 2010). For one thing, if we look at contemporary\nscience, the strict correspondence between levels and scientific\nfields breaks down immediately: Fields such as cognitive neuroscience\nspan multiple levels, and the level of multicellular organisms is\nstudied by a plethora of different scientific disciplines (Craver\n2005; Bechtel 2008: 145). Likewise, the exhaustive stepwise condition\non compositional relations between natural constituents, requiring\nthat entities at one level are composed of only entities at the next\nlower level, is largely a caricature (e.g., Kim 2002): think of blood,\nnominally a tissue-level phenomenon, which is directly composed by\nmolecular constituents such as vitamins and water without\nadjacent-level constituents, e.g., cells, playing any intermediary\nrole. Finally, and most importantly, the layer-cake account aspires to\na comprehensive notion of \u2018levels\u2019 that is wildly at odds\nwith the way that \u2018levels\u2019 is actually used in science.\nScientists often operate with a much more limited definition of the\nlevels concept that either (a) is restricted to a specific and local\ncontext (see\n section 2.2)\n or (b) makes room for exceptions to what \u2018levels\u2019\nexpresses (see\n section 3).\n Many biological sources in fact are completely aware that levels do\nnot capture a completely uniform reality, and sometimes remark on\nimportant exceptions to the rules that are laid down by the levels\nconcept. This is most prominently seen when referring to\n\u201corganisms\u201d in a piecemeal way so as to capture both\nmulticellular and unicellular forms of life (Mader 2010: 2).\n",
