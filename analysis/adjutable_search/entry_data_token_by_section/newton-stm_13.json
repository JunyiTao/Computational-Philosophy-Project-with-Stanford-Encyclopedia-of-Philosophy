    "main_text": "Common Impediments to Understanding the Scholium || Why They Are Indeed Impediments\n7. Newton's Legacy\n\n Newton's views on space, time, and motion dominated physics from the\n17th Century until the advent of the theory of relativity in the 20th\nCentury. Nonetheless, these views have been subjected to frequent\ncriticism, beginning with contemporaries, such as Leibniz and\nBerkeley, and continuing on to the close of the 19th Century, most\nnotably with Ernst Mach, whose writings influenced Einstein. In the\nearly twentieth century, Newton tended to be cast as a metaphysical\ndogmatist by the early philosophical interpreters of relativity, in\nparticular Hans Reichenbach.  Unfortunately, that stigma has tended to\nlinger.  \n\n More recent scholarship reveals a more sober picture of why Newton\nfelt fully justified in positing absolute space, absolute time, and\nabsolute motion. Moreover, the novel feature of special relativity,\nthe rejection of absolute simultaneity\u2014something that never\noccurred to any of Newton's earlier critics\u2014necessitated only\nthat absolute space and absolute time be replaced with an absolute\nspace-time (Minkowski spacetime). And although Einstein's development\nof general relativity was in large part motivated by a desire to\nimplement a general principle of relativity, to wit that all motion is\nrelative motion, that it succeeds in doing so was questioned shortly\nafter the theory was introduced. As for the question of the\nabsoluteness of space-time in general relativity, it no longer has the\ncharacter of something which acts without being acted upon, as\nEinstein himself pointed out. The space-time metric tensor\nnot only encodes for spatiotemporal structure, but also represents the\ngravitational potentials, and thus gravitational energy.  By Einstein's\nfamous equation for the equivalence of energy and mass,\nit follows that the gravitational field possesses mass.  \nOnly, since gravitational energy can not be localized in terms of\nan energy density tensor, but is possessed by the field holistically,\nneither can this mass be localized.  Thus, philosophical\ncontroversy as to whether space-time can exist without matter becomes\ntendentious according whether one counts the gravitation field as\nsomething material or not.  \n\n Thus, the question whether the revolution in our views about space\nand time in the last century vindicates Newton's critics as more\nphilosophically astute becomes a misplaced one. The distinction\nbetween what counts as matter in contrast to empty space presupposed\nin the earlier debates has been eclipsed by possibilities undreamt of\nbefore the introduction of modern field\n theory and relativity.[1]\n\n",
