    "main_text": "Realist Responses || Language Acquisition\n4.2 Language Acquisition\n\nThe challenge to realism posed by language acquisition is to explain\nhow a child (or novice) could come to know the meanings of certain\nsentences within his/her language: the ones the realist contends have\nundetectable truth-makers associated with them. How could the child\nlearn the meanings of such sentences if these meanings are determined\nby states of affairs not even competent speakers can detect?\n\nA straightforward realist reply is that knowledge of the meanings of\nsentences with undetectable truth-conditions is acquired in the same\nway as knowledge of the meanings of sentences with recognisable\ntruth-conditions: namely, compositionally by acquiring knowledge of\nthe lexicon and the relevant compositional principles [Pagin\n 2009].[2]\n Anti-realists respond by contesting the interpretation of the\ncompositional principles that generate sentences with undetectable\ntruth-conditions \u2014 where realists assert \\(S \\lor \\neg S\\) is\ntrue (\\(S\\) being the Socrates sentence), anti-realists maintain there\nis no ground for asserting this disjunction [e.g. Tennant 1987].\n\nSome realists reject the publicity of meaning principle as it applies\nto language learning. While many accept that the meaning of a word is\ndetermined by its use in a given language, not all do [e.g. Chomsky\n1986; Fodor and Lepore 2002]. Realists who think of semantic\nunderstanding as a mental state reject the idea that a speaker\u2019s\nunderstanding of meaning is exhaustively manifest in its use as an\ninstrument of communication rather than in its internal use in\nexpressing thought. If Dummett\u2019s manifestation requirement is a\ndemand for a behaviouristic reduction of semantic knowledge, they\nargue, it should be rejected [Burgess 1984; Chomsky 1986]. However,\nsome sympathetic to the demand for full manifestability of semantic\nknowledge reject the behaviouristic construal and instead justify it\non conceptual grounds [e.g. Shieh 1998, McGee\n 2015].[3]\n\n\nThe Acquisition Challenge is a vexed one for realists because Dummett\nshares little common ground with the many (realist) philosophers,\nlinguists and cognitive scientists who believe language acquisition is\neffected by a dedicated language module [Fodor 1975, 1983, 2008;\nChomsky 1986, 2006; Crain 2012; Pinker 1994] or even with those who\ndisavow modularity but agree that semantic knowledge is partly\nunconscious. Thus, Dummett rejected Chomsky\u2019s thesis that\nspeakers have unconscious knowledge of the rules of Universal Grammar\non the Wittgensteinian grounds that it was, at best \u201can\nexplanatory hypothesis, not a systematisation of facts open to\nview.\u201d [Dummett 1981]. Dummett apparently took this\n\u201csystemisation of facts\u201d to be satisfied by an account\nthat pairs knowledge of meaning with recognitional\n abilities.[4]\n\nIt is worth noting that evidence from developmental psychology\nindicates some meaning is pre-linguistic and that some pre-linguistic\nmeaning or conceptual content relate to situations that are not\ndetectable by the child. For example, psychologists have discovered\nsystems of core knowledge activated in infancy that govern the\nrepresentation of, inter alia concrete objects and human\nagents [see Spelke 2003; Spelke and Kinzler 2007]. An interesting\nfinding from preferential gaze experiments suggests 4 month old\ninfants represent occluded objects as continuing behind their\n barriers.[5]\n\nWhile these findings do not by themselves show that the meanings of\nmental symbols is not determined by public use, they do provide\nevidence that \u2018verification-transcendent\u2019 conceptual\ncontent is laid down in the earliest stages of cognitive development.\n\n",
