    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n4. Natural Philosophy\n\n\nFitzRalph\u2019s views on motion, time, and infinity were the\ntopics upon which his near contemporaries, especially Wodeham and\nHolcot, most frequently quoted him (Dunne 2008). Wodeham, it seems, changed many\nof his opinions in the light of FitzRalph\u2019s, especially regarding\ninfinity. In Book III of his Oxford Lectura, Wodeham followed\nFitzRalph word for word on the issue, thereby rejecting the very\nposition he had himself defended in Book I. Again, Gregory of\nRimini recognized FitzRalph as the source for the common view of\ninfinity held at Oxford by Holcot and Wodeham, and he repeated\nFitzRalph\u2019s arguments, albeit in order to reject this position\n(Courtenay 1987: 76\u20138.)\n\n\nFitzRalph deals with these topics in the Lectura Book II,\nqu. 1: Whether God at the beginning of time created the world from\nnothing. One of the more striking features of the text is its\npredominantly philosophical flavor and its comparative lack of\ntheological material. The principal question is devoted to the general\nproblem of the eternity of the world. FitzRalph begins by putting\nforward arguments against the beginning of the world in time. One goes\nas follows: if God\u2019s power is always the same, then it was the\nsame before the world was created; therefore, God could always from\neternity have produced the world. Thus, there is no contradiction in\nstating that the world has always existed. FitzRalph attributes this\nposition to the Commentary on the Sentences of Thomas Aquinas.\nIndeed, he continues that, even if the world is not from eternity, we\ncan argue that in the future God might make it so, since what he once\ncan do, he can always do. In other words, it remains part of\nGod\u2019s power to make a universe that has always existed, just as\nit remains possible for God to destroy this universe, or again, to\ncreate other universes that have always existed.\n\n\nAnother argument among the many put forward is that if some\ncontradiction can be found in the notion of a world existing from\neternity, then this should be shown through the use of reason. If it\nwere possible to show that the world and time began at a certain\ninstant, then the philosophers of the past would have proven it.\nFitzRalph quotes Aristotle as saying, in the first book of the\nTopics, that either position is possible and can be argued\nfor, but neither position can be shown to be conclusive. Thus,\nFitzRalph concludes that the creation of the world ex nihilo et de\ntempore can be taken only as an article of faith; indeed, if this\nwere not the case, then there would be no merit in believing in the\ncreation of the world.\n When dealing with the associated question of the infinity\nof the number of souls FitzRalph discusses the nature of the infinite.\nHe comments that the eternity of the world does not necessarily imply\nan infinity of souls, since the first man could have been made at a\ncertain time and so have a finite number of descendants. Again, through\nreincarnation a finite number of souls could be continually reborn\nthroughout a perpetual time. FitzRalph continues by pointing out that\nsome people say that an infinity of souls is in no way impossible, or,\nat least, does not involve a contradiction, since God can make an\nactual infinite number of souls, angels, or beings at once, or he can\ndo so successively, so that an actual infinite will exist at some\nfuture time, even given that the world began at a certain\npoint.\n\n\nAgain, in every body there is an infinite number of proportional\nparts (partes proportionales: the terminology is\nChatton\u2019s, and the source for the treatment that follows is\nprobably the De indivisibilibus of Wodeham) that are\ncompletely distinct one from another (totaliter diverse).\nThus, God can make something exist at once which is actually infinite,\nand the same is as true of souls or angels as it is of bodies. That\nthere is an infinite number of proportional parts in a body is\nconsidered by FitzRalph to have been shown by Aristotle in Book III of\nthe Physics and in Averro\u00ebs\u2019s commentary, since\nevery continuum is composed of an infinite number of proportional\nparts, each of which is distinct from the other. FitzRalph holds\nthat it can be argued that in any line there is an infinite number of\npoints, that there is an infinite number of lines in any surface, and\nan infinite number of surfaces in every body, and yet each is distinct\nfrom the other.\n\n\nFitzRalph continues his argument by stating that if there is an\nactual infinity within bodies, that is to say, if they can actually be\ndivided to infinity, then it is clear that it is possible for God to\nmake an infinite number of other things. Thus, there is no\ncontradiction in there being an infinite number of human souls. Nor is\nthere any problem with God\u2019s not knowing which is first and\nwhich is last in an infinite series; this is not because of any\nignorance on God\u2019s part but because, quite simply, there is no\nfirst and last. In the end he refers his audience back to his\ndiscussion of the topic in his commentary on the Physics, now\nlost.\n\n\nFinally, FitzRalph makes an interesting distinction between\nphilosophy and theology. In the ninth argument, where Anselm\u2019s\nassertion (in the Monologion, chap. 22) that time is composed\nof parts is addressed, FitzRalph begins by stating that he is concerned\nhere with Anselm\u2019s standing (auctoritas) as a natural\nphilosopher and not as a theologian. In fact, FitzRalph goes further:\n\u201chere we must follow reason more than the standing\n(auctoritas) of any theologian.\u201d\n",
