    "main_text": "Correspondence revisited || Facts again\n3.3 Facts again\n\nThere have been a number of correspondence theories that do make use\nof facts. Some are notably different from the neo-classical theory\nsketched in section 1.1. For instance, Austin (1950) proposes a view\nin which each statement (understood roughly as an utterance event)\ncorresponds to both a fact or situation, and a type of situation. It\nis true if the former is of the latter type. This theory, which has\nbeen developed by situation theory (e.g., Barwise and Perry,\n1986), rejects the idea that correspondence is a kind of mirroring\nbetween a fact and a proposition. Rather, correspondence relations to\nAustin are entirely conventional. (See Vision (2004) for an extended\ndefense of an Austinian correspondence theory.) As an ordinary\nlanguage philosopher, Austin grounds his notion of fact more in\nlinguistic usage than in an articulated metaphysics, but he defends\nhis use of fact-talk in Austin (1961b).\n\nIn a somewhat more Tarskian spirit, formal theories of facts or states\nof affairs have also been developed. For instance, Taylor (1976)\nprovides a recursive definition of a collection of \u2018states of\naffairs\u2019 for a given language. Taylor\u2019s states of affairs\nseem to reflect the notion of fact at work in the neo-classical\ntheory, though as an exercise in logic, they are officially\n\\(n\\)-tuples of objects and intensions.\n\nThere are more metaphysically robust notions of fact in the current\nliterature. For instance, Armstrong (1997) defends a metaphysics in\nwhich facts (under the name \u2018states of affairs\u2019) are\nmetaphysically fundamental. The view has much in common with the\nneo-classical one. Like the neo-classical view, Armstrong endorses a\nversion of the correspondence theory. States of affairs are\ntruthmakers for propositions, though Armstrong argues that\nthere may be many such truthmakers for a given proposition, and vice\nversa. (Armstrong also envisages a naturalistic account of\npropositions as classes of equivalent belief-tokens.)\n\nArmstrong\u2019s primary argument is what he calls the\n\u2018truthmaker argument\u2019. It begins by advancing a\ntruthmaker principle, which holds that for any given truth,\nthere must be a truthmaker \u2013 a \u201csomething in the world\nwhich makes it the case, that serves as an ontological ground, for\nthis truth\u201d (p. 115). It is then argued that facts are the\nappropriate truthmakers.\n\nIn contrast to the approach to correspondence discussed in section\n3.1, which offered correspondence with minimal ontological\nimplications, this view returns to the ontological basis of\ncorrespondence that was characteristic of the neo-classical\ntheory.\n\nFor more on facts, see the entry on\n facts.\n",
