    "main_text": "Representation\n5. Representation\n\nDespite the disagreements among partisans of the theories of\nremembering discussed in section 4,\nthey are, for the most part, in agreement on the point that\nremembering involves representations of past events. The role of\nrepresentations in remembering, however, raises a number of difficult\nquestions of its own. One such question concerns the implications of\nmental content externalism\nfor memory content in particular.[2]\nExternalism, which has become the dominant view of the nature of\nmental content, holds that the content of a subject\u2019s mental\nrepresentations depends not only on his own internal states but also\non his relationships to things in his external environment. For\nexample, what one thinks when one thinks the thought that one would\nexpress by saying \u201cwater is wet\u201d\nis determined in part by the chemical composition of the substance that fills the\nlakes and rivers and falls from the sky in the environment in which one learned\nto use the word \u201cwater\u201d, namely,\nH2O; had one learned to use the word\n\u201cwater\u201d in an environment in which\nsomething other than H2O fills the lakes and rivers and\nfalls from the sky, then one\u2019s thought would have been that\nthat other substance is wet, not that H2O is wet (Putnam 1975).\nThis much is common ground among externalists. But a subject might\nmove from one environment to another, and externalists disagree about\nthe contents of memories formed before such moves and retrieved after\nthem. Pastist externalists (e.g., Boghossian 1989; Burge\n1998) maintain that the past environment alone is relevant.\nPresentist externalists (e.g., Ludlow 1995; Tye 1998)\nmaintain that the past and the present environments are both relevant.\nAnd futurist externalists (e.g., Stoneham 2003; Jackman 2005)\nmaintain that the past, the present, and any future environments are\nall relevant. Since the arguments for and against these views have had\nlittle contact with mainstream philosophy of memory, they will not be\nreviewed here; for further discussion, see Bernecker (2010).\n\nTwo further questions concerning the role of representations in\nremembering have been at the heart of mainstream philosophy of memory.\nThese questions are sometimes run together, but they raise distinct\nissues. The first, concerning retrieved representations, is the\nquestion of the nature of the objects of memory. The second,\nconcerning stored representations, is the question of the existence\nand role of memory traces.\n",
