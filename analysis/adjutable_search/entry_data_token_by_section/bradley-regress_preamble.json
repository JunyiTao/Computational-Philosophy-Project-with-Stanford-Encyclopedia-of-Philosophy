    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cBradley\u2019s Regress\u201d is an umbrella term for a family\nof arguments that lie at the heart of the ontological debate\nconcerning properties and relations. The original arguments were\narticulated by the British idealist philosopher F. H. Bradley, who, in\nhis work Appearance and Reality (1893), outlined three\ndistinct regress arguments against the relational unity of properties.\nBradley argued that a particular thing (a lump of sugar) is nothing\nmore than a bundle of qualities (whiteness,\nsweetness, and hardness) unified into a cohesive\nwhole via a relation of some sort. But relations, for Bradley, were\ndeeply problematic. Conceived as \u201cindependent\u201d from their\nrelata, they would themselves need further relations to relate them to\nthe original relata, and so on ad infinitum. Conceived as\n\u201cinternal\u201d to their relata, they would not relate\nqualities at all, and would also need further relations to relate them\nto qualities. From this, Bradley concluded that a relational unity of\nqualities is unattainable and, more generally, that relations are\nincoherent and should not be thought of as real.\n\nIn the decades since its original formulation by F. H. Bradley,\n\u201cBradley\u2019s regress\u201d has come to refer to a wider\nvariety of arguments. This diversification has happened in two main\ndirections: (i) with respect to the ontology that the argument targets;\nand (ii) with respect to the argument-type presented. (i)\nBradley\u2019s original arguments targeted a one-category ontology of\nqualities, where by \u201cqualities\u201d Bradley seemed to have in\nmind unrepeatable particularized properties or tropes. The\nsame argument form, however, has been used against the one-category\nontology of qualities conceived as multiply occurring universals, as\nwell as against the two-category ontology of particulars and\nuniversals. In fact, one of the most commonly cited versions of\nBradley\u2019s regress in contemporary ontological debate challenges\nthe possibility of appealing to relations to unify particulars (such\nas electrons, apples, chairs) with their respective property\nuniversals (negative charge, roundness,\nblackness). The argument aims to show that any appeal to a\nrelation R (of instantiation, exemplification, etc.) to relate\na particular a with its universal F will require a\nfurther relation R\u2032 to relate the particular a,\nthe universal F, and the relation R; and so on ad\ninfinitum. (ii) In contemporary literature,\n\u201cBradley\u2019s regress\u201d has been associated with a\nnumber of arguments and problems that are not, in the way they are\nposed, strictly regress arguments. Some of these take the form of the\ngeneral problem\nabout unity, i.e., the question of what is the ontological\nground of the unity of a bundle of tropes/state of affairs as opposed\nto the sum/list/set of their constituents. Others are after an\nexplanation of how relations relate, i.e., the question of\nwhat it is about relations that makes them apt to relate distinct\nrelata. Still others are after an explanation of the\nexistence of specific unified complexes, i.e., the question\nof what makes it the case that a number of constituents of the right\nkinds are actually connected so as to form an existing\nfact/state of affairs/bundle of tropes.\n\nIn the face of these Bradleyean arguments, philosophers have had a\nvariety of replies. Some have opted for a rejectionist route\nwhich involves questioning the very assumptions that Bradley\u2019s\narguments make and consequently refusing to reply to the arguments as\nstated (for instance, Russell, Blanshard, Alexander, and Grossman have\nargued that it is a job of relations to relate and that\nBradley\u2019s relational regresses cannot get started if\nrelations\u2019 relating role is taken seriously). The majority of\nphilosophers, however, have accepted some form of the Bradleyan\nargument and replied in one of the following ways: 1) by appealing to\na non-relational tie to relate the relata (Bergmann, Strawson,\nArmstrong); 2) by invoking external relations in possession of some\nspecial features which make them better apt to relate their relata\n(Meinertsen, Vallicella, Maurin, Weiland and Betti); 3) by describing\na special sort of mutual inter-dependence of the would-be relata\n(Frege, Baxter, Simons, Perovic); 4) by claiming simply that the\ncomplex entities themselves (such as states of affairs or facts) act\nas unifiers of their own constituents (Olson, Armstrong); and 5) by\narguing in favor of the benign nature of an infinite regress\n(Armstrong, Orilia).\n\nThis entry starts with a historical background of Bradley\u2019s\nregress arguments. Section 1 opens with an outline of some of\nthe historical precursors of Bradley\u2019s regress arguments in\nancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. It then presents in some\ndetail the regress arguments as they were formulated by Bradley in\nAppearance and Reality (1893), as well as Bradley\u2019s\nlater concerns with complexes and relations. Section 2\ndiscusses the two types of extensions that Bradley\u2019s regress\narguments have undergone\u2014with respect to the ontology that they\napply to, and with respect to the exact sort of problem in view.\nSection 3 presents six common types of replies that can be\nfound in the literature surrounding Bradleyean problems. And\nSection 4 concludes by describing some of the recent\napplications of the regress arguments in the literature on grounding,\ncomposition of objects, and unity of the proposition.\n",
