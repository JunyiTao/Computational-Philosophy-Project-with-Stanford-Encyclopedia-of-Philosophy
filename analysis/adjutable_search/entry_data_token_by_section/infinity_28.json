Conclusion\n\nWe are well aware that our discussion of infinity is\nincomplete\u2014but then, so is any such discussion. We take some\ncomfort from the fact that it is impossible to give balanced coverage\nto a boundless set of issues in finite space.\n\nThere are many more philosophically significant paradoxes and puzzles\nthat involve infinity in one way or another; we have only given a\nsmall sample. And new paradoxes involving infinity seem to appear at\nan ever-increasing rate (doubtless yet another one can be fashioned\nout of this very fact!). However, so too are our tools for\nunderstanding infinity. Of course, we cannot give a definitive\nassessment of the state of play, but the theoretical developments that\nwe have sketched and references that we have cited make us sanguine\nthat overall, the prospects for our relationship with infinity are\ngood: we can indeed live with it.\n",
