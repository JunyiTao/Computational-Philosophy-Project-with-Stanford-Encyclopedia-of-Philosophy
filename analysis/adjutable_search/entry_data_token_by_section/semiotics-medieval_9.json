The sign as a central notion in 14th-century logic\n\n\nEven though in 13th-century terminist logic\n\u2018significatio\u2019 is seen as the foundation of all\n\u2018properties of terms\u2019 (proprietates terminorum),\nthe generation of William of Sherwood and Peter of Spain is not\nparticularly interested in the concept of signification.\nSignificatio is shortly described as \u201cpresentation of\nsome form to the intellect\u201d (praesentatio alicuius formae ad\nintellectus)[44]\n or as \u201crepresentation of a thing by\nmeans of a conventional vocal expression\u201d (rei per vocem\nsecundum placitum repraesentatio) (Peter of Spain, Summule\nlogicales, 1972, 79). But the detailed logical discussion\nstarts right away with the concept of suppositio\n(supposition), i.e., from the capacity of substantive terms to stand\nfor something in a propositional context.\n\n\nWith William of Ockham (ca. 1285\u20131347/49), however, the concepts of\nsign and signification begin to take center stage in logic (Biard\n1981, 452; Biard 1989, Lenz 2003, Panaccio 2004). Logic is seen as\nexclusively concerned with signs, primarily with mental signs,\nsecondarily with vocal or written signs.  Ockham integrates the\nconcept of supposition into his definition of sign. He recognizes that\nthe general notion of sign as something that makes something else come\ninto cognition is too broad to be useful in logic and semantic theory;\ntherefore, he adds to the definition the criterion that a sign, as far\nas its use in logic is concerned, has to be apt to stand for the thing\nit makes come into cognition, or else it has to be such that it could\nbe added to such a sign standing for something (natum est pro illo\nsupponere vel tali addi in propositione) (William of\nOckham, Summa log., 1974, 9).[45] Thus, Ockham's logical concept of sign is\nrestricted to what later will be termed a \u2018propositional\nsign\u2019 (signum propositionale) (John Raulin, In log.\nArist. comment., 1500, fol. a5rb). Due to the central\nposition of the notion of sign in his logic, one is entitled to\ncharacterize Ockham's logic as \u201cruled by the concept of\nsign\u201d (\u201cr\u00e9gie par le concept de signe\u201d)\n(Biard 1989, 102). Ockham, constantly referring to the notion of sign,\nventures in many cases a semiological redefinition of basic logical\nconcepts (Biard 1989, 102\u201325), which in turn allows him to reformulate\ntraditional ontological issues, as for instance the questions of\nuniversals, the number of categories, or the ontological status of\nrelations, as semantic questions.\n\n\nOckham's logic marks an important, though not the only important,\nstep in the process that might be described as a progressive\n\u2018mentalization\u2019 of sign. The idea behind this process is\nthe contention that without some sort of \u2018intentionality\u2019\nthe phenomena of sign, signification and semiosis in general must\nremain inconceivable. This tendency of relocating the notions of sign\nand signification from the realm of spoken words to the sphere of the\nmind is characteristic of the mentalist logic arising in the early\n14th century, and remaining dominant throughout the later\nMiddle Ages. Words or signs, insofar as they concern rational\ndiscourse, were traditionally held to be the essential subject matter\nof logic. According to mentalist logic, however, the\n\u2018words\u2019 or \u2018signs\u2019 primarily relevant to logic\nare not the spoken words, but the trans-idiomatic mental words\n(verba mentis) or mental concepts. Thus, in later medieval\nlogic, as already in Burleigh and Ockham, the mental sign will be the\nfocus of logical semantics. According to a distinction introduced by\nPeter of Ailly (1330\u20131421) in the second half of 14th\ncentury,\n\u2026a thing can be called a sign in two senses. In the\nfirst sense, because it leads to an act of knowing the thing of which\nit is a sign. In a second sense, because it is itself the act of\nknowing the thing. In the second sense we may say that a concept is a\nsign of a thing of which such a concept is a natural likeness \u2014\nnot that it leads to an act of knowing that thing, but because it is\nthe very act itself of knowing the thing, [an act that] naturally and\nproperly represents that thing (Peter of Ailly, Concepts,\n1980, 17).\n\n\nEven if Ockham's semantics, as well as his theory of mental language\ngoverned by a trans-idiomatic mental grammar transforming the theorems\nof terminist logic into a theory of thought processes (William of\nOckham, Summa log., 1974,\n 11ff),[46]\n was by no means\nundisputed, and came under severe criticism by his opponents as well as\nno less severe modifications by his \u2018followers\u2019. What,\ndespite all the differences, logical authors from the\n14thcentury on generally have in common is their awareness\nof the importance of the concept of sign \u2014 even though, of\ncourse, there were exceptions to this rule. Some realistic-minded\ntheologians, such as John Wyclif (1330\u20131384) or Stanislas of Znoymo\n(fl. ca. 1400), harshly criticize the alleged overestimation of the\nsign by the \u201cteachers of signs\u201d (doctores\nsignorum), as the latter calls them. According to Stanislas, the\nhuman \u2018errantry through the vain and useless signs\u2019 of\nlogic is nothing but the necessary consequence of the fall of mankind\n(in penam peccati sumus necessitati in his vacuis et inanis signis\nerranter ambulare) (Stanislas of Znoymo, De vero et\nfalso, 1971,\n 207).[47]\n",
