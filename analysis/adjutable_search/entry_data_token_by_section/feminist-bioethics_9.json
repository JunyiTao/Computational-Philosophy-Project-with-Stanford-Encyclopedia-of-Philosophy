    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis || Political commitment/activism\n3.5 Political commitment/activism\n\nA final characteristic of feminist bioethics that draws together all\nthe other distinctive features is its political commitment. While\nfeminist bioethics, like feminist ethics more broadly, is an academic\ndiscipline, it originated in and alongside a social-political movement\nwith the aims of global justice and equality for women. Feminist\ntheory has always attempted to connect the personal with the\npolitical. In the context of ethics, this means something more than\njust expanding the ethical frame of reference beyond person to person\ninteractions to the institutional or societal scale; it means an\nunderstanding that individual and interpersonal issues are\nfundamentally shaped by broader socio-political forces. Hence,\nfeminist bioethics always has a perspective that pushes beyond the\nstraightforward characterization of a moral concern in medicine or\nlife sciences, and even beyond examining why it has arisen. A feminist\napproach to bioethics pushes towards identifying and catalyzing social\nand political change to create better lives for women.\n",
