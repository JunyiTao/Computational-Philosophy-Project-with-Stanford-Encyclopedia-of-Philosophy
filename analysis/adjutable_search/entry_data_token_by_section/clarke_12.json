    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Trinitarian Views\n4.3 Trinitarian Views\n\nIn his lifetime, Clarke was infamous for his view of the trinity, and\nhe sparked a vociferous debate (Ferguson 1974, 59\u2013149;\nPfizenmaier 1997, 179\u2013216). Clarke was not officially censured\n(but nearly so), but it surely prevented his rising to higher office.\nClarke\u2019s writing on the trinity are relevant for understanding\nhis other metaphysical positions, especially his identification of\n\u201cperson\u201d with intelligent, acting agent rather than with a\nparticular substance, which has not been sufficiently reconciled with\nhis account of personal identity as wrapped up with an immaterial\nsoul.\n\nIn Christian theology, God is represented as tripartite\u2014three\npersons but one God. In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, in\nuse in England during Clarke\u2019s lifetime, one of the liturgies\ndraws from the Athanasian Creed, which includes the following\ndiscussion of the Trinity: \u201cFor there is one Person of the\nFather, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost. But the\nGodhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all\none\u2026 So the Father is God, the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost\nis God. And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.\u201d In his\nposition as a cleric, Clarke was required to subscribe to this\nformulation. In 1712, against the advice of his friends, he published\nThe Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity, in which he diverged\nfrom what his opponents considered the plain sense of this\nformulation. The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity begins by\ncollecting all the passages of the New Testament that relate to the\nTrinity. It then sets out a series of 55 propositions regarding the\nTrinity, each supported by references to the texts collected in the\nfirst section and writings from the early Christian church. However,\nthe biblical texts do not primarily discuss God\u2019s metaphysical\nattributes, according to Clarke, but ascribe dominion to God (W 4.150;\nSnobelen 2004, 265\u2013275). The third section relates these propositions\nto the Anglican liturgy. This approach reflects Clarke\u2019s general\nexpectation that the correct theological doctrines are found in the\nBible, are endorsed by the early church, and are compatible with\nreason. Through hundreds of years of what he considered bad\nmetaphysics, the correct and intelligible doctrine of the trinity had\nbecome obscured, and Clarke hoped to return to a pre-Athanasian\nunderstanding of the trinity.\n\nClarke\u2019s position in The Scripture-Doctrine of the\nTrinity was labeled by his opponents as \u201cArian,\u201d\n\u201cSocinian,\u201d and \u201cSabellian.\u201d Although they\nwere commonly used as abusive terms for anyone holding non-traditional\nor anti-trinitarian views, they also have more precise meanings. An\nArian holds that the Son (the second person of the Trinity) is divine\nbut not eternal; he was created by God the Father out of nothing\nbefore the beginning of the world. A Socinian holds that the Son is\nmerely human and was created at or after the conception of Jesus. A\nSabellian holds that the Son is a mode of God. In the precise use of\nthe terms, Clarke is none of these. Unlike the Arians, Clarke affirmed\nthat the Son is co-eternal with the Father and not created (W 4.141).\n(Pfizenmaier 1997 provides further textual and historical arguments\nthat Clarke should not be classified as an Arian.) From this it also\nfollows that, contra the Socinians, the Son existed before\nthe conception of Jesus. Unlike the Sabellians, Clarke denied that the\nSon was a mode of the Father. (This would have been very problematic\ngiven that he sometimes claimed that space is a mode of God.)\nClarke\u2019s claimed ignorance about substance made him reluctant to\ndeclare that the Father and the Son were the same divine substance,\nbut the Son is endowed by the Father with all of the power and\nauthority of the Father. He also called the manner of the Son\u2019s\ngeneration from the father \u201cineffable.\u201d So while Clarke\ndenied that the trinity was a \u201cmystery,\u201d he did believe\nthat the manner in which the Father\u2019s power is communicated to the\nSon is \u201cafter a manner to us unknown\u201d (Proposition 35;\n4.159).\n\nClarke affirms that each member of the trinity is a person, but only\nthe Father is self-existent, which means that the Father by essence\n(rather than by \u201coffice\u201d) has a property that the Son does\nnot. His views are best described as subordinationist but he could\nalso be called a unitarian, in at least some senses of the term (Tuggy\n2014; 204\u2013205). See especially Prop. 25 (W 4.150); Prop. 27 (W 4.151);\nand Prop. 34 (\u201cThe Son, whatever his metaphysical essence of\nsubstance be, and whatever divine greatness and dignity is ascribed to\nhim in scripture; yet in this he is evidently subordinate to the\nFather, that he derives his being, attributes, and powers, from the\nFather, and the Father nothing from him\u201d; 4.155). To the Father\nalone are ascribed \u201cindependence and supreme authority\u201d\n(Proposition 27; 4.151). Every other attribute and power that can be\nascribed to the Father can also be ascribed to the Son, \u201cbut the\ntitles ascribed to the Son, must always carry along with them the idea\nof being communicated or derived\u201d (4.153).\n",
