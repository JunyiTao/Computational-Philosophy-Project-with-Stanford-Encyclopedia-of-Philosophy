Three Types of Philosophy of Biology\n\nThree different kinds of philosophical inquiry fall under the general\nheading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the\nphilosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. Second,\nconceptual (or theoretical) problems within biology itself are\nsubjected to philosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are\nmade in discussions of traditional philosophical questions. The first\nmajor debate in the philosophy of biology exemplified the first of\nthese, the use of genetics to explore reductionism and\nanti-reductionism in the philosophy of science. Kenneth F. Schaffner\napplied the logical empiricist model of theory reduction to the\nrelationship between classical, Mendelian genetics and molecular\ngenetics (Schaffner 1967a; Schaffner 1967b; Schaffner 1969). David\nHull argued that the lesson of this attempt was that Mendelian\ngenetics is irreducible to molecular genetics (Hull 1974; Hull 1975).\nThis debate reinforced the near-consensus in the 1970s and 1980s that\nthe special sciences are autonomous from the more fundamental sciences\n(Fodor 1974; Kitcher 1984). However, the apparent absurdity of the\nclaim that the molecular revolution in biology was not a successful\ninstance of scientific reduction also led the formulation of\nincreasingly more adequate models of theory reduction (Wimsatt 1976;\nWimsatt 1980; Schaffner 1993; Waters 1994; Rosenberg 1997; Sarkar\n1998). \n\nIn another important early debate philosophers set out to solve a\nconceptual problem within biology itself. The concept of reproductive\nfitness is at the heart of evolutionary theory, but its status has\nalways been problematic. It has proved surprisingly hard for\nbiologists to avoid the criticism that, \u201c[i]f we try to make\nlaws of evolution in the strict sense we seem to reduce to\ntautologies. Thus suppose we say that even in Andromeda \u2018the\nfittest will survive\u2019 we say nothing, for \u2018fittest\u2019\nhas to be defined in terms of \u2018survival\u2019\u201d (Smart\n1959, 366). This came to be know as the \u201ctautology\nproblem\u201d. Alexander Rosenberg and Mary B. Williams argued that\nfitness is an irreducible primitive which derives its meaning from its\nplace in an axiomatic formulation of evolutionary theory (Rosenberg\n1983; Sober 1984a; Williams and Rosenberg 1985). If correct, this\nwould solve the tautology problem since axioms are often thought of as\ntautologous. In the 1970\u2019s the new generation of philosophers of\nbiology offered a different solution to the tautology problem in two\nsteps. First, they began by arguing that fitness is a supervenient\nproperty of organisms: the fitness of each particular organism is\nnecessarily dependent on some specific set of physical characteristics\nof the organism and its particular environment, but two organisms that\nhave the same fitness may do so in virtue very different sets of\nphysical characteristics (Rosenberg 1978). Second, they argued that\nthis supervenient property is a propensity \u2013 which is a\nprobabilistic disposition represented by a probability distribution\nover possible numbers of offspring (Mills and Beatty 1979). Although\nfitness is defined in terms of reproductive success, it is not a\ntautology that the fittest organisms have the most offspring, any more\nthan it is a tautology that dice produce even numbers more often than\nthey produce sixes. The propensities of fit organisms to survive and\nof dice to fall equally often on each side both allow us to make\nfallible predictions about what will happen, predictions that become\nmore reliable as the size of the sample increases. It remains unclear,\nhowever, whether it is possible to specify a probability distribution\nor set of distributions that can play all the roles actually played by\nfitness in population biology (Beatty & Finsen 1989, Sober 2001;\nPence & Ramsey 2013).\n\nThe phrase \u2018conceptual problems\u2019 should be understood very\nbroadly. The conceptual work done by philosophers of biology in many\ncases merges smoothly into theoretical biology. It also sometimes\nleads philosophers to examine and criticize the chains of argument\nconstructed by biologists, and thus to enter directly into ongoing\nbiological debates. In the same way, the first kind of philosophy of\nbiology we have described \u2013 the use of biological examples to work\nthrough general issues in the philosophy of science \u2013 sometimes\nfeeds back into biology itself through specific recommendations for\nimproving biological methodology. It is a striking feature of the\nphilosophy of biology literature that philosophers often publish in\nbiology journals and that biologists often contribute to philosophy of\nbiology journals. The philosophy of biology also has a potentially\nimportant role as a mediator between biology and society. Popular\nrepresentations of biology derive broad lessons from large swathes of\nexperimental findings and theoretical work. Philosophers of science\nhave an obvious role in evaluating these interpretations of the\nsignificance of specific biological findings (Stotz and Griffiths\n2008). As two important examples, philosophers of biology have\nprovided a great deal of clarity regarding creationism/intelligent\ndesign (Kitcher 1982; Ruse 1982; Pennock 2000; Sarkar 2007) and\nsociobiology/evolutionary psychology (Kitcher 1985; Buller 2006;\nRichardson 2010; Barker 2015). \n\nA third form of philosophy of biology occurs when philosophers appeal\nto biology to support positions on traditional philosophical topics,\nsuch as ethics or epistemology. The extensive literature on biological\nteleology is a case in point. After a brief flurry of interest in the\nwake of the \u201cmodern synthesis\u201d, during which the term\n\u2018teleonomy\u2019 was introduced to denote the specifically\nevolutionary interpretation of teleological language (Pittendrigh\n1958), the ideas of function and goal directedness came to be regarded\nas relatively unproblematic by evolutionary biologists. In the 1970s,\nhowever, philosophers started to look to biology to provide a solid,\nscientific basis for normative concepts, such as illness, disorder, or\nmalfunction (Wimsatt 1972; Wright 1973; Boorse 1976). Eventually, the\nphilosophical debate produced an analysis of teleological language\nfundamentally similar to the view associated with modern synthesis\n(Millikan 1984; Neander 1991; Godfrey-Smith 1994). According to the\n\u201cselected effects\u201d theory of function, the functions of a\ntrait are those activities in virtue of which the trait was selected.\nThe idea of proper function has become part of the conceptual\ntoolkit of philosophy in general and of the philosophy of language and\nthe philosophy of mind in particular (Dretske 1991, 1997; Millikan\n1995, 2004, 2005; Papineau 1987, 1993; Neander 2017; Garson 2019).\n",
