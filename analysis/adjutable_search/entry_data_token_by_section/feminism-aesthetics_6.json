    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Everyday Life\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe topics included under the designation \u201cfeminist\naesthetics\u201d extend through philosophy, history, critical\ndisciplines, and art practices. Theories of perception, appreciation,\nand interpretation have been developed in all of these areas. While\nmuch of this thinking began with examination of philosophical\ntradition and the conceptual frameworks it affords, feminist\nperspectives have also opened the field in many directions, such that\ntheorizing in the twenty-first century has taken different directions\nfrom the critical perspectives that began to probe gender analysis in\nthe 1970s. Of special note is the diffusion of interests from overtly\npolitical and strategic analyses of women in society and culture, to\nexploration of the variant forms that gender can assume, a shift that\nalso distinguishes aspects of the transition from feminism to\npostfeminism. A wider attention to issues of diverse identity,\nparticularly attentive to racially inflected differences,\ncharacterizes both feminist theory in general and aesthetics today.\nThus feminist work is more and more likely not to focus on women as an\nexclusive topic but to consider other modes of identity as well. And\nfeminists have employed philosophies of divergent stripes in their own\nquests, elaborating and refining them, and\u2014most\nimportantly\u2014formulating ideas that are independent of any particular\ntheoretical allegiances. The changing emphases of feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics and philosophy of art over the last five\ndecades are evident in philosophy, art theory, criticism and\ncommentary on the arts, and in the practice of artists themselves,\ntestimony to the degree to which philosophy and cultural production\ntravel hand in hand, which is an abiding characteristic of the field\nof aesthetics itself.\n",
