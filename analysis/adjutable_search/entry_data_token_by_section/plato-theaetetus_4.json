Definition by Examples: 146a\u2013151d\n\n\nAt 145d Socrates states the \u201cone little question that\npuzzles\u201d him: \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d Theaetetus\u2019 first\nresponse (D0) is to offer examples of knowledge\n(146c).  Socrates rejects this response, arguing that, for any\nx, examples of x are neither necessary nor\nsufficient for a definition of x. They are not necessary,\nbecause they are irrelevant (146e). They are not sufficient, because\nthey presuppose the understanding that a definition is meant to\nprovide (147a\u2013b). Moreover (147c), a definition could be briefly\nstated, whereas talking about examples is \u201can interminable\ndiversion\u201d (aperanton hodon).\n\n\nDoes Socrates produce good arguments against definition by examples?\nMany philosophers think not (McDowell 1976 (115), Geach 1966, Santas\n1972, Burnyeat 1977). They often argue this by appealing to the\nauthority of Wittgenstein, who famously complains (The Blue and\nBrown Books, 20) that \u201cWhen Socrates asks the question,\n\u2018What is knowledge?\u2019, he does not regard it even as a\npreliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge.\u201d\nFor arguments against this modern consensus, see Chappell 2005\n(36\u201337).\n\n\nSome commentators have taken Socrates\u2019 critique of definition by\nexamples to be an implicit critique of the Republic\u2019s\nprocedure of distinguishing knowledge, belief, and ignorance by\ndistinguishing their objects. The suggestion was first made by Ryle\n1990 (23), who points out that \u201cSocrates makes it clear that\nwhat he wants discussed is not a list of things that people\nknow,\u201d \u201cbut an elucidation of the concept of\nknowledge.\u201d Ryle suggests that \u201cAttention to this simple\npoint might have saved Cornford from saying that the implicit\nconclusion of the dialogue is that \u2018true knowledge has for its\nobjects things of a different order\u2019.\u201d Ryle thinks it\n\u201csilly\u201d to suggest that knowledge can be defined merely by\nspecifying its objects.\n\n\nHowever, 145e\u2013147c cannot be read as a critique of the\nRepublic\u2019s procedure of distinguishing knowledge from belief\nby their objects. 145e\u2013147c is not against defining knowledge by\nexamples of objects of knowledge; it is against\ndefining knowledge by examples of kinds of\nknowledge.  (See e.g., 146e7, \u201cWe weren\u2019t wanting to\nmake a list of kinds of knowledge.\u201d) This is a different\nmatter.\n\n\nWhy, anyway, would the Platonist of the Republic think that\nexamples of the objects of knowledge are enough for a definition of\nknowledge? He is surely the last person to think that. The person who\nwill think this is the empiricist, who thinks that we acquire\nall our concepts by exposure to examples of their application: Locke,\nEssay II.1, Aristotle, Posterior Analytics 100a4\u20139.\nFor the Platonist, definition by examples is never even possible; for\nthe empiricist, definition by examples is the natural method in every\ncase. This suggests that empiricism is a principal target of the\nargument of the Theaetetus. More about this in sections\n6\u20138.\n\n\nTheaetetus is puzzled by his own inability to answer Socrates\u2019 request\nfor a definition of knowledge, and contrasts it with the ease with\nwhich he can provide mathematical definitions. He gives an example of\na mathematical definition; scholars are divided about the aptness of\nthe parallel between this, and what would be needed for a definition\nof knowledge. Socrates\u2019 response, when Theaetetus still protests his\ninability to define knowledge, is to compare himself to a midwife in a\nlong and intricate analogy.\n\n\nMany ancient Platonists read the midwife analogy, and more recently\nCornford 1935 has read it, as alluding to the theory of recollection.\nBut it is better not to import metaphysical assumptions into the text\nwithout good reason, and it is hard to see what the reason would be\nbeyond a determination to insist that Plato always maintained the\ntheory of recollection.  With or without this speculation, the midwife\npassage does tell us something important about how\nthe Theaetetus is going to proceed. In line with the\nclassification that the ancient editors set at the front of the\ndialogue, it is going to be peirastikos,\nan experimental dialogue. It will try out a number of\nsuggestions about the nature of knowledge. As in the aporetic\ndialogues, there is no guarantee that any of these suggestions will be\nsuccessful (and every chance that none of them will be).\n\n\nSo read, the midwife passage can also tell us something important\nabout the limitations of the Theaetetus\u2019 inquiry. The\nlimitations of the inquiry are the limitations of the main inquirers,\nand neither (the historical) Socrates nor Theaetetus was a\ncard-carrying adherent of Plato\u2019s theory of Forms. Perhaps the\ndialogue brings us only as far as the threshold of the theory of Forms\nprecisely because, on Socratic principles, one can get no further. To\nget beyond where the Theaetetus leaves off, you have to be a\nPlatonist. (For book-length developments of this reading of the\nTheaetetus, see Sedley 2004 and Chappell 2005.)\n",
