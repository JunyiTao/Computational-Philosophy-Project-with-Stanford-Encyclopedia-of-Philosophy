    "main_text": "Mind and Metaphysics || Dialectics and the Not-Self View\n6.1 Dialectics and the Not-Self View\nA common stylistic feature of the Buddhist canonical literature is\nthe use of similes and parables, of which perhaps the best known is\nthe simile of the raft. In the Middle Length Discourses, the\nBuddha is seen explaining to an old man that his body of teachings is\nlike a raft: it serves the purpose of crossing over (viz., from the\nshore of afflictions to that of nirv\u0101\u1e47a) and should be\nabandoned once the crossing has been effected (Majjhima\nNik\u0101ya, III, 22; \u00d1\u0101namoli & Bodhi 1995,\n228f). The simile of the raft marks the pragmatic (Jayatilleke (1963,\n357) calls it \u2018utilitarian\u2019) approach of the Buddha's\nteachings, and is also suggestive of a core aspect of Buddhist praxis:\nthe notion of expedient means\n(up\u0101ya-kau\u015balya). Ganeri has recently proposed that\nwe identify the nature of Buddha's discourses as being essentially\nprotreptic, similar to the Stoic exhortation which invites the adept\nto reconsider and rethink her ethical and metaphysical position\n(cf. Ganeri 2007, 100 and passim). Thus, the notion of\nexpedient means\u2014this specifically Buddhist\nprotreptic\u2014operates as a cautionary device against the tendency\nto assume that Buddhist doctrines may be seen as articulating a\nparticular type of metaphysics whose principles are to be examined\nwithout any appeal to context or target audience.\nIt is primarily in response to the Buddha's use of expedient means\n(and the expansion of the Buddhist canonical literature with the\nadvent of Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras) that Abhidharma traditions\ndevelop the hermeneutics of two truths: depending on scholastic\naffiliation, doctrinal positions are henceforth classified as either\nin need of interpretation (ney\u0101rtha) or as already\npossessing the definitive meaning (n\u012bt\u0101rtha) (see\nLopez 1988, and contributions therein).\nThe hermeneutics of two truths is central to Madhyamaka dialectics\nand its deconstructive analysis of key metaphysical concepts,\nincluding those of causation, essence, and the self. In\nthe Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way\n(M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101s; hereafter MMK),\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna extends the notion that phenomena lack intrinsic\nexistence (svabh\u0101va) to apply to the self, which is\nusually conceived in dependence upon the five aggregates (MMK, IX,\n12). While considering various ways of conceiving of the self (viz.,\nas distinct from the psychophysical aggregates, as unchanging, as a\nunifying principle, or as an agent), N\u0101g\u0101rjuna concludes\nthat none of them actually make sense on account of the fact that\nnothing can be said to be prior to the cognitive activities of seeing,\nhearing, etc. (MMK, IX, 7, 10). A metaphysical self, conceived as an\nabiding and substantive entity, is therefore inconceivable.\nHowever, the mistaken apprehension of a self in a stream of\ncausally interconnected cognitive events does not preclude endorsing a\nconventional notion of self for ordinary individuals who lack a proper\nunderstanding of actions and their consequences. Indeed, \u0100ryadeva\n(ca. 150 C.E.), an immediate disciple of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, invokes\nthe expedient means device to endorse precisely such a view: for\ncertain classes of individuals adherence to a conventional view of\nself is more profitable than the denial of self. The not-self view,\nclaims \u0100ryadeva, is primarily reserved for those of a superior\ndisposition, who alone can grasp the definite meaning of the Buddha's\nteachings (cf. Catu\u1e25\u015bataka, 12.12-14). However,\nultimately the Buddha's teachings are interpreted as endorsing not any\nspecific view, but rather the relinquishing of all views\u2014which\nis only possible in a non-positional awareness that captures the\nparadoxical nature of the Madhyamaka dialectic (detailed discussions\nof the Madhyamaka dialectic of emptiness as applied to the self are\nfound in Sprung 1979, Huntington 1989, Tillemans 1990, Garfield 1995,\nand Westerhoff 2009).\n\n",
