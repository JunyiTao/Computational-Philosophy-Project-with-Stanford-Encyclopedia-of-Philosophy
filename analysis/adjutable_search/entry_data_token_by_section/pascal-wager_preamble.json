    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d is the name given to an argument\ndue to Blaise Pascal for believing, or for at least taking steps to\nbelieve, in God. The name is somewhat misleading, for in a single\nsection of his Pens\u00e9es, Pascal apparently\npresents\u00a0four\u00a0such arguments, each of which might\nbe called a \u2018wager\u2019\u2014it is only the third\u00a0of\nthese that is traditionally referred to as \u201cPascal\u2019s\nWager\u201d. We find in it the extraordinary confluence of several\nimportant strands of thought: the justification of theism; probability\ntheory and decision theory, used here for almost the first time in\nhistory; pragmatism; voluntarism (the thesis that belief is a matter\nof the will); and the use of the concept of infinity.\n\nWe will begin with some brief stage-setting: some historical\nbackground, some of the basics of decision theory, and some of the\nexegetical problems that the Pens\u00e9es pose. Then we\nwill follow the text to extract three main arguments. The bulk of the\nliterature addresses the third of these arguments, as will the bulk of\nour discussion here. Some of the more technical and scholarly aspects\nof our discussion will be relegated to lengthy footnotes, to which\nthere are links for the interested reader. All quotations are from\n\u00a7233 of Pens\u00e9es (1910, Trotter translation), the\n\u2018thought\u2019 whose heading is\n\u201cInfinite\u2014nothing\u201d.\n",
