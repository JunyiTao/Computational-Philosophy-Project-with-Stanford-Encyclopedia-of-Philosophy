    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Public Reason\n3.6 Public Reason\n\nHaving seen how Rawls answers the challenges of legitimacy and\nstability, we can return to legitimacy and its criterion of\nreciprocity: citizens must reasonably believe that all citizens can\nreasonably accept the enforcement of a particular set of basic laws.\nIt is unreasonable for citizens to attempt to impose what they see as\nthe whole truth on others\u2014political power must be used in ways\nthat all citizens may reasonably be expected to endorse. With his\ndoctrine of public reason, Rawls extends this requirement of\nreciprocity to apply directly to how citizens explain their political\ndecisions to one another. In essence, public reason requires citizens\nto be able to justify their political decisions to one another using\npublicly available values and standards.\n\nTo take a straightforward example: a Supreme Court justice deciding on\na gay marriage law would violate public reason were she to base her\nopinion on God\u2019s forbidding gay sex in the book of Leviticus, or\non a personal spiritual revelation that upholding such a law would\nhasten the end of days. This is because not all members of society can\nreasonably be expected to accept Leviticus as stating an authoritative\nset of political values, nor can a religious premonition be a common\nstandard for evaluating public policy. These values and standards are\nnot public.\n\nRawls\u2019s doctrine of public reason can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\nCitizens engaged in certain political activities have a\nduty of civility to be able to justify their decisions on\nfundamental political issues by reference only to public\nvalues and public standards.\n\n\nEach of the highlighted terms in this doctrine can be further\nelucidated as follows:\n\n\n\nThe public values that citizens must be able to appeal to are\nthe values of a political conception of justice: those related to the\nfreedom and equality of citizens, and society as a fair system of\ncooperation over time. Among such public values are the freedom of\nreligious practice, the political equality of women and of racial\nminorities, the efficiency of the economy, the preservation of a\nhealthy environment, and the stability of the family (which helps the\norderly reproduction of society from one generation to the next).\nNonpublic values include values internal to associations like churches\n(e.g., that women may not hold the highest offices) or private clubs\n(e.g., that racial minorities can be excluded) which cannot be squared\nwith public values such as these. \n\n\nSimilarly, citizens should be able to justify their political\ndecisions by public standards of inquiry. Public standards are\nprinciples of reasoning and rules of evidence that all citizens can\nreasonably endorse. So citizens should not justify their political\ndecisions by appeal to divination, or to complex and disputed economic\nor psychological theories. Rather, publicly acceptable standards are\nthose that rely on common sense, on facts generally known, and on the\nconclusions of science that are well established and not\ncontroversial. \n\n\nThe duty to abide by public reason applies when the most\nfundamental political issues are at stake: issues such as who\nhas the right to vote, which religions are to be tolerated, who will\nbe eligible to own property, and what are suspect classifications for\ndiscrimination in hiring decisions. These are what Rawls calls\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice.\nPublic reason applies more weakly, if at all, to less momentous\npolitical questions, for example to most laws that set rates of\ntaxation, or that put aside public money to maintain national\nparks. \n\n\nCitizens have a duty to constrain their decisions by public reason\nonly when they engage in certain political activities, usually\nwhen exercising powers of public office. So judges are bound by public\nreason when they issue their rulings, legislators should abide by\npublic reason when speaking and voting in the legislature, and the\nexecutive and candidates for high office should respect public reason\nin their public pronouncements. Significantly, Rawls says that voters\nshould also heed public reason when they vote. All of these activities\nare or support exercises of political power, so (by the liberal\nprinciple of legitimacy) all must be justifiable in terms that all\ncitizens might reasonably endorse. However, citizens are not bound by\nany duties of public reason when they engage in other activities, for\nexample when they worship in church, perform on stage, pursue\nscientific research, send letters to the editor, or talk politics\naround the dinner table. \n\n\nThe duty to be able to justify one\u2019s political decisions with\npublic reasons is a moral duty, not a legal duty: it is a duty of\ncivility. All citizens always have their full legal rights to free\nexpression, and overstepping the bounds of public reason is never in\nitself a crime. Rather, citizens have a moral duty of mutual respect\nand civic friendship not to justify their political decisions on\nfundamental issues by appeal to partisan values or controversial\nstandards of reasoning that cannot be publicly redeemed. \n\n\nIn an important proviso, Rawls adds that citizens may speak the\nlanguage of their controversial comprehensive doctrines\u2014even as\npublic officials, and even on the most fundamental issues\u2014so\nlong as it can be shown that these assertions appeal to public values.\nSo President Lincoln, for instance, could legitimately use Biblical\nimagery to condemn the evil of slavery, since his condemnations\nappealed to the public values of freedom and equality. Thus even\nwithin its limited range of application, Rawls\u2019s doctrine of\npublic reason is rather permissive concerning what citizens may say\nand do within the bounds of civility.\n",
