    "main_text": "Leibniz || Force and the Nature of Motion\n6.2 Force and the Nature of Motion\n\nSo far (apart from that remark about \u2018unchanged\u2019 bodies)\nwe have not seen Leibniz introduce anything more than relations of\ndistance between bodies, which is certainly consistent with the folk\nview of his philosophy. However, Leibniz sought to provide a\nfoundation for the Cartesian/mechanical philosophy in terms of the\nAristotelian/scholastic metaphysics of substantial forms (here we\ndiscuss the views laid out in Sections 17\u201322 of the 1686\nDiscourse on Metaphysics and the 1695 Specimen of\nDynamics, both in Garber and Ariew 1989). In particular, he\nidentifies primary matter with what he calls its \u2018primitive\npassive force\u2019 of resistance to changes in motion and to\npenetration, and the substantial form of a body with its\n\u2018primitive active force\u2019. It is important to realize that\nthese forces are not mere properties of matter, but actually\nconstitute it in some sense, and further that they are not themselves\nquantifiable. However, because of the collisions of bodies with one\nanother, these forces \u2018suffer limitation\u2019, and\n\u2018derivative\u2019 passive and active forces\n result.[11]\n Derivative passive force shows up in the different degrees of\nresistance to change of different kinds of matter (of \u2018secondary\nmatter\u2019 in scholastic terms), and apparently is measurable.\nDerivative active force, however, is considerably more problematic for\nLeibniz. On the one hand, it is fundamental to his account of motion\nand theory of mechanics \u2013 motion fundamentally is\npossession of force. But on the other hand, Leibniz endorses the\nmechanical philosophy, which precisely sought to abolish Aristotelian\nsubstantial form, which active force represents. Leibniz\u2019s goal\nwas to reconcile the two philosophies, by providing an Aristotelian\nmetaphysical foundation for modern mechanical science; as we shall\nsee, it is ultimately an open question exactly how Leibniz intended to\ndeal with the inherent tensions in such a view.\n6.2.1 Vis Viva and True Motion\n\nThe texts are sufficiently ambiguous to permit dissent, but arguably\nLeibniz intends that one manifestation of derivative active force is\nwhat he calls vis viva \u2013 \u2018living force\u2019.\nLeibniz had a famous argument with the Cartesians over the correct\ndefinition of this quantity. Descartes defined it as size\ntimes speed \u2013 effectively as the magnitude of the\nmomentum of a body. Leibniz gave a brilliant argument (repeated in a\nnumber of places, for instance Section 17 of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics) that it was size times\nspeed2 \u2013 so (proportional to) kinetic\nenergy. If the proposed identification is correct then kinetic energy\nquantifies derivative active force according to Leibniz; or looked at\nthe other way, the quantity of virtus (another term used by\nLeibniz for active force) associated with a body determines its\nkinetic energy and hence its speed. As far as the authors know,\nLeibniz never explicitly says anything conclusive about the relativity\nof virtus, but it is certainly consistent to read him (as\nRoberts 2003 does) to claim that there is a unique quantity of\nvirtus and hence \u2018true\u2019 (as we have been using\nthe term) speed associated with each body. At the very least, Leibniz\ndoes say that there is a real difference between possession and\nnon-possession of vis viva (e.g., in Section 18 of the\nDiscourse) and it is a small step from there to true, privileged\nspeed. Indeed, for Leibniz, mere change of relative position is not\n\u2018entirely real\u2019 (as we saw for instance in the\nCorrespondence) and only when it has vis viva as its\nimmediate cause is there some reality to\n it.[12]\n An alternative interpretation to the one suggested here might say\nthat Leibniz intends that while there is a difference between\nmotion/virtus and no motion/virtus, there is somehow\nno difference between any strictly positive values of those\nquantities.\n\nIt is important to emphasize two points about the preceding account of\nmotion in Leibniz\u2019s philosophy. First, motion in the everyday\nsense \u2013 motion relative to something else \u2013 is\nnot real. Fundamentally motion is possession of virtus,\nsomething that is ultimately non-spatial (modulo its interpretation as\nprimitive force limited by collision). If this reading is right\n\u2013 and something along these lines seems necessary if we\naren\u2019t simply to ignore important statements by Leibniz on\nmotion \u2013 then Leibniz is offering an interpretation of motion\nthat is radically different from the obvious understanding. One might\neven say that for Leibniz motion is not movement at all! (We will\nleave to one side the question of whether his account is ultimately\ncoherent.) The second point is that however we should understand\nLeibniz, the folk reading simply does not and cannot take account of\nhis clearly and repeatedly stated view that what is real in motion is\nforce not relative motion, for the folk reading allows\nLeibniz only relative motion (and of course additionally,\nmotion in the sense of force is a variety of true motion, again\ncontrary to the folk reading).\n",
