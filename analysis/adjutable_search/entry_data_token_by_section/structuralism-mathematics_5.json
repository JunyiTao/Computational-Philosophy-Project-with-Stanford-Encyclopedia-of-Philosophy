    "main_text": "Later Developments and a Broader Taxonomy || A Broader Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions\n2.3 A Broader Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions\n\nAll the variants of structuralism described up to this point are forms\nof \u201cphilosophical structuralism\u201d, or more precisely, of\n\u201cmetaphysical structuralism\u201d.  What that means is that\nthese positions are intended to provide answers to questions about\nwhat mathematical structures are (even when this involves an\neliminative stance), including views about their existence,\nabstractness, identity, dependence, etc.  Now, one can distinguish\nthis whole variety of philosophical positions from what is sometimes\ncalled \u201cmathematical structuralism\u201d, or again more\nprecisely, \u201cmethodological structuralism\u201d (cf. Reck &\nPrice 2000, earlier Awodey 1996).  In fact, we suggest that\nrecognizing this basic dichotomy\u2014\u201cmetaphysical versus\nmethodological\u201d\u2014to is crucial with respect to both\nsystematic and historical discussions of structuralism.  (Among\nothers, it allows us to connect more naturally with categorical\nstructuralism; see, e.g., Corry 2004 and Marquis 2009.) \n\nAs its name suggests, methodological structuralism concerns the\nmethodology of mathematics, thus mathematical practice.  Or as one\nmight also put it, it concerns a certain \u201cstyle\u201d of doing\nmathematics. That style consists in studying whole systems or\nstructures of objects in terms of their global, relational, or\nstructural properties, while neglecting the intrinsic nature of the\nobjects involved. This can be done in two main ways, often intertwined\nin practice: by proceeding axiomatically, i.e., by deriving theorems\nfrom basic axioms for the systems at issue; and by considering\nmorphisms between them (homomorphisms, isomorphisms, etc.), together\nwith invariants under those morphisms. As such an approach typically\ninvolves infinite sets, non-decidable properties, and classical logic,\nit tends to be opposed to more \u201ccomputational\u201d and\n\u201cconstructivist\u201d ways of doing mathematics (cf. Reck &\nSchiemer forthcoming for extensive historical background).\n\nSuch a structuralist methodology, or corresponding forms of\nmethodological structuralism, tends to be tied to a general assumption\nabout the subject matter of mathematics, namely: mathematics is the\nstudy structures.  But accepting that assumption does not, in itself,\ninvolve any further views about the nature of those structures, at\nleast not in any detailed and philosophically loaded way. In contrast,\nall the forms of metaphysical structuralism considered earlier are\nmeant to provide such views.  This is exactly how they go beyond\nmethodological structuralism (often by building on it).\n\n\nWith respect to such metaphysical positions, Parsons\u2019\n\u201celiminative versus non-eliminative\u201d distinction remains\nhelpful (although a more positive label for the latter kind of views,\nalong the lines of \u201cstructuralism with structures\u201d, might\nbe better). However, the differences among metaphysical forms of\nstructuralisms do not stop there. In fact, only working with\nParsons\u2019 distinction obscures some important differences. As\nalready mentioned, Shapiro\u2019s ante rem structuralism is\nfar from the only version of non-eliminative structuralism; nor is\nHellman\u2019s the only form of eliminative structuralism.  We now\nwant to suggest some more fine-grained distinctions so as to introduce\nmore order and clarity into the debates.\n\nLet us first look again at non-eliminative versions of\nstructuralism. Some positions falling under that label introduce\nabstract structures by means of a basic theory. This includes\nShapiro\u2019s structure theory, but also, e.g., Nodelman &\nZalta\u2019s object theory and Leitgeb\u2019s adaptation of graph\ntheory. All of them are forms of ante rem structuralism, but\nsignificantly different ones. In addition, there are forms of\nnon-eliminative structuralism that are based on abstraction principles\ninstead, which we called \u201cabstractionist forms of\nstructuralism\u201d above. We distinguished two variants of those,\nthe Russellian and the Dedekindian variant, which involve different\nkinds of structures as the outcome of the abstraction process.  (If we\nreconstruct such abstraction as mathematical operations or functions,\ntheir arguments are the same but their values are different.)  And as\nthis shows, there are abstractionist and non-abstractionist versions\nof non-eliminative structuralism.\n\nIf we reflect on these alternatives more, the role of a further basic\ndichotomy becomes apparent (within the category of non-eliminative\nstructuralism): that between\nante rem positions and either in\nre or post rem positions.\nShapiro\u2019s position is explicitly a form of \nante rem structuralism. In contrast, Russellian\nabstractionist structuralism can be seen as a form of\npost rem structuralism, because the equivalence\nclasses used as the relevant structures are \u201cbuilt\nout of\u201d their elements as classes, to which they \nare thus posterior. In Dedekindian abstractionist\nstructuralism, there is a form of posteriority\ninvolved as well. Here too, we start with more concrete relational\nsystems, usually systems of sets or urelements, and we introduce\nabstract structures on that basis. But the\nprior versus posterior relation is different now. (It is not\nbased on the element-class relation, but on a more basic\nargument-function-value relation.) We also end up with abstract\nstructures that are neither standard sets nor classes.\n\nOn the side of eliminative structuralism, further sub-divisions should\nbe made as well. Again, there are fully eliminative positions, which\navoid commitment to any kind of abstract objects.  Hellman\u2019s\nmodal structuralism is designed to be of this sort. But there are also\nsemi-eliminative positions, which avoid commitment to abstract\nstructures in addition to more usual, relatively concrete mathematical\nobjects, which are accepted.  Set-theoretic structuralism is a good\nillustration; universalist structuralism is another, at least when\nbacked by set theory.  Should relativist structuralism in general, and\nset-theoretic structuralism in particular, be seen as cases of\nin re structuralism, in the sense that\nabstract structure exist \u201cin\u201d \ntheir more concrete instantiations? Perhaps; but this thesis does\nnot seem to be forced on us (cf. Leitgeb forthcoming for more on this\nissue). Note also that we would end up with a form of\nnon-eliminative structuralism then instead. The same\nquestion arises for in re forms of structuralism \nmore generally; the details will matter. (For more on such \napproaches\u2014sometimes labeled \n\u201cAristotelian\u201d as opposed to \n\u201cPlatonist\u201d\u2014see Pettigrew 2008 and\nFranklin 2014.) \n\nYet another version of eliminative structuralism that has started to\nattract more attention in the literature is concept structuralism.  In\ncases where this position is meant to do without any appeal to\nabstract objects (e.g., by basing itself on formalism), it amounts to\na fully eliminative view. Various questions remain, however, about the\nappeal to concepts in it, i.e., about their existence, nature, and\nidentity (cf. Parsons 2018).  Depending on the answers, a strict\nnominalist might still find this position unacceptable, since concepts\nmay be seen as another problematic kind of abstract entities.  If a\nconcept structuralist allows for abstract objects, such as sets, to\nplay a secondary role, this becomes a semi-eliminative\nposition. Structures conceived of as abstract objects are still\neliminated (by reconceiving them as concepts), but relational systems\nremain.  Alternatively, we might be dealing with a particular form of\nmethodological structuralism here, where additional metaphysical\nquestions are brushed aside.\n",
