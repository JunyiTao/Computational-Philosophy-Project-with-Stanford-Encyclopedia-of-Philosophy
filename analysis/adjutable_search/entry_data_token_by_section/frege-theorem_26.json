This in\nturn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only\nrules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic\nprinciples of logic. This view has become known as\n\u2018Logicism\u2019. Here is what Frege says: \n\n\n[Begr, Preface, p. 5:]\n\nTo prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had\nto bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps.\n[from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967]\n\n[Begr, Part III, \u00a723:]\n\nThrough the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought,\nirrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an\nintuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results\nfrom its own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight\nappear to be possible only on the basis of some intuition. \\(\\ldots\\)\nThe propositions about sequences [\\(R\\)-series] in what follows far\nsurpass in generality all those that can be derived from any intuition\nof sequences. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort\n1967]\n\n[Gl, \u00a762:]\n\nHow, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas\nor intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a\nproposition that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To\ndefine the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs. [from\nthe Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n[Gl, \u00a787:]\n\nI hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that\nthe laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a\npriori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and\nevery proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative\none. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n[Gg I, \u00a70:]\n\nIn my Grundlagen der Arithmetik, I sought to make it\nplausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any\nground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the\npresent book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the\nsimplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone. [from the Furth\ntranslation in Frege 1967]\n\n[Gg II, Appendix:]\n\nThe prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to\nconceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we\njustified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is\nnot solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume,\nstill I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found.\n[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n",
