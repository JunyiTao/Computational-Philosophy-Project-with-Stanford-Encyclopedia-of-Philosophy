    "main_text": "General Features of Introspection || The Products of Introspection\n1.3 The Products of Introspection\n\nThough philosophers have not explored the issue very thoroughly,\naccounts also differ regarding the products of introspection.\nMost philosophers hold that introspection yields something like\nbeliefs or judgments about one\u2019s own mind, but others prefer to\ncharacterize the products of introspection as \u201cthoughts\u201d,\n\u201crepresentations\u201d, \u201cawareness\u201d, or the like.\nFor ease of exposition, this article will describe the products of the\nintrospective process as judgments, without meaning to beg the\nquestion against competing views.\n",
