    "main_text": "How to Specify the Threshold || Specifying the Threshold as a Sufficientarian Standard\n4.3 Specifying the Threshold as a Sufficientarian Standard\n\nInterpreting the threshold concept as an element of a sufficiency\nconception of intergenerational justice can take a number of different\nforms (see Benbaji 2005: 316\u2013321 and 2006; Casal 2007:\n312\u2013326; Huseby 2010a). A plausible version is characterized by\ntwo theses, namely by what scholars have called the \u201cPositive\nThesis\u201d (see especially Casal 2007: 298\u2013299) and the\n\u201cShift Thesis\u201d (Shields 2016: 34\u201335). The Positive\nThesis states that we have weighty non-instrumental reasons to secure\nat least enough of some benefit(s). According to the Shift Thesis,\n\n\n\nonce people have secured enough there is a discontinuity in the rate\nof change of the marginal weight of our reasons to benefit individuals\nfurther. (Shields 2018: 211) \n\n\nThe Shift Thesis is compatible with several understandings of the\nrelevance of justice-based reasons above the threshold, among them:\nFirst, once a person is above the threshold of sufficiency there is no\njustice-based reason to benefit this person. This claim is often\nreferred to as the \u201cNegative Thesis\u201d of sufficientarianism\nand has been much criticized (Casal 2007: 299\u2013304). Second,\nother justice-based reasons apply above the threshold that are less\nweighty. This would mean that additional justice claims reflecting,\nfor example, prioritarian or egalitarian reasoning (see\n \u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3)\n can be valid. Third, the same justice-based reasons as below the\nthreshold undergo a relative change of weight at the sufficiency\nthreshold.\n\nThe third understanding of the Shift Thesis relates to a further\ndistinction of how to understand the sufficiency conception. Versions\nof sufficientarianism differ in how they take into account ethical or\njustice-based reasons to benefit persons above the threshold of\nsufficiency. Strong sufficientarianism gives absolute, weak\nsufficientarianism gives some but not absolute priority to those who\nare below the threshold. In the intergenerational context weak\nsufficientiarianism seems more plausible than strong\nsufficientarianism (Meyer & Stelzer 2018).\n\nSuppose not all presently living and future persons\u2019 claims to\nsufficiency well-being can be met (but see Wolf 2009: 362). Then we would need to weigh\nall people\u2019s claims. Proponents of sufficientarianism have\nproposed different principles of distribution below the threshold of\nsufficiency. Most prominently, they have argued that we ought to\nmaximize the well-being of present and future individuals below the\nthreshold (so-called \u201cmin-deprivation\u201d; Wolf 2009:\n356\u2013357); or that\nwe ought to maximize the number of individuals who are sufficiently\nwell-off (so-called \u201cheadcount\u201d; Page 2007a: 85\u201395).\nBoth of these below-threshold principles seem problematic. They will\noften imply that we ought to sacrifice the worst-off present or future\npersons for the sake of better-off, but still badly-off persons.\nAccording to a third understanding, we should rely on a priority view\nfor unavoidable sub-threshold distributions: benefitting persons below\nthe threshold of sufficiency matters more the more claimants are\nbenefitted and the greater these benefits (Meyer 2009a, 2009b, 2015;\nMeyer & Roser 2009). This understanding only entails sacrificing\nthe worst-off individuals for the sake of better off but still badly\noff individuals under circumstances where the former higher weighted\nclaims will be outweighed by the sum of the less weighty claims of\nmore better-off people.\n\nRichard Arneson and others (Arneson 1999, 2000; Roemer 2004; and see\nCasal 2007: esp. 312\u2013314, 315\u2013318) have objected to\nthresholds, and especially those that designate an absolute\npriority\u2014as is characteristic of the position of strong\nsufficientarianism\u2014on the grounds that we cannot avoid an\narbitrary specification of such priority thresholds and, further, that\nsuch thresholds are incompatible with our distributive\nconvictions\u2019 being continuous (that is, that they all can be\naccounted for by means of one principle of distribution). Others have\ndefended a priority threshold against both objections (Crisp 2003:\n753\u2013757; Benbaji 2006: 332\u2013344; Page 2007a: 16\u201318;\nDorsey 2008; Huseby 2010b: 180\u2013182; Freiman 2012: 30\u201333;\nShields 2012: 111\u2013115; Sher 2014: chs. 8 and 9; Meyer &\nP\u00f6lzler forthcoming). In specifying a priority threshold one\nimportant issue is on what currency we should rely (see\n \u00a74.4).\n .\n\nDefining a threshold of well-being according to which both currently\nand future living people are able to reach a sufficientarian threshold\narguably avoids the implausible implications of the egalitarian and\nprioritarian alternatives when we understand the latter to define\nthresholds of harm (see\n \u00a74.1\n and\n \u00a74.2):\n First, avoiding or reducing differences must not lead to a state of\naffairs in which people are worse off than they ought to be. Secondly,\nclaims against currently living people are unreasonable if in\nfulfilling them the currently living people will bring about minimal\nor even trivial improvements of the well-being of future people but\nsuffer losses themselves, causing them to fall below a plausible\nthreshold level of well-being. Third, the number of people brought\ninto existence ought to be compatible with all people having\nsufficiently good lives or lives worth living (see Meyer 1997:\n139\u2013140).\n\nTo be sure, according to the \u201cshift thesis\u201d justice-based\nreasons may apply above the threshold and they can include egalitarian\nor prioritarian reasons. And one should note that the reasons for a\nsufficientarian understanding of intergenerational justice are at\nleast in part specific reasons and are not necessarily relevant for\nunderstanding either global justice or the notion of justice that\nholds among contemporary members of well-ordered societies.\n",
