Despite the unfamiliar term\n\u201cDiophantine,\u201d what is at issue here is truly elementary.\nConsider any equation with one or more variables and with integer\ncoefficients, which involves only addition and multiplication, such as\n\\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), or \\(3x^2 + 5y^2 + 2xy = 0\\). If real-number\nsolutions are sought, one usually speaks simply about an\n\u201cequation\u201d. However, in number theory, typically a\nsolution is sought consisting only of integers. That makes a great\ndifference. The former of the above equations has infinitely many\nsolutions among real numbers, but only four among integers. The\nequation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\) also has infinitely many real solutions but\nno integer solutions. When the focus is on the integer solutions, one\ntalks about \u201cDiophantine equations\u201d (after the ancient\nnumber theorist Diophantus of Alexandria). \n\nFor a positive solution of Hilbert\u2019s tenth problem, it would\nhave sufficed to present a particular concrete method which would have\nintuitively been a \u201cmechanical\u201d decision method. However,\nTuring\u2019s pioneering analysis of the notion of decision method\nbrought into focus the possibility of a negative solution. Beginning\nin the early 1950s, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis worked on this\nproblem, later joined by Hilary Putnam. As a result of their\ncollaboration, the first important result in this direction was\nachieved. Call an equation \u201can exponential Diophantine\nequation\u201d if it involves also exponentiation, as well as\naddition and multiplication (that is, one can have both constants and\nvariables as exponents); naturally, the focus is still in the integer\nsolutions. Davis, Putnam, and Robinson (1961), showed that the problem\nof solvability of exponential Diophantine equations is undecidable. In\n1970, Yuri Matiyasevich added the final missing piece, and\ndemonstrated that the problem of the solvability of Diophantine\nequations is undecidable. Hence the overall result is often called\nMRDP Theorem (for an exposition, see, e.g., Davis 1973; Matiyasevich\n1993).\n\nThe essential technical achievement was that all semi-decidable\n(recursively enumerable) sets can be given a Diophantine\nrepresentation, i.e., they can be represented by a simple formula of\nthe form \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n (s = t)\\), where \\((s = t)\\)\nis a Diophantine equation. More exactly, for any given recursively\nenumerable set \\(S\\), there is a Diophantine equation \\((s(y, x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) = t(y, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n))\\) such that \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\n\\in S\\) if and only if \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n\n(s(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n) = t(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots\n,x_n))\\).\n\nAs there are semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets which are\nnot decidable (recursive), the general conclusion follows immediately:\n\n\nMRDP Theorem\n\nThere is no general method for deciding whether or not a given\nDiophantine equation has a solution.\n\n\nThis also provides an elegant variant of the incompleteness theorems\ndealing with Diophantine equations:\n\nCorollary\n\nFor any 1-consistent axiomatizable formal system \\(F\\) there are\nDiophantine equations which have no solutions but cannot be proved in\n\\(F\\) to have no solutions.\n\n\n(The question of avoiding the requirement of 1-consistency here is\ntricky; see Dyson, Jones and Shepherson 1982.)\n",
