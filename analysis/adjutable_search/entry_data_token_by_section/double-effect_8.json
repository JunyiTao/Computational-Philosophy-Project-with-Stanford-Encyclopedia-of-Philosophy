    "main_text": "Criticisms || Does Double Effect Explain the Permissibility of Risky Rescues and Rescue by Reducing the Extent of Harm?\n4.6 Does Double Effect Explain the Permissibility of Risky Rescues and Rescue by Reducing the Extent of Harm?\n\nProponents of double effect have argued that agents may cause certain\nand serious harm or run the risk of causing serious harm when they are\ntrying to prevent even greater harm that would otherwise be certain to\noccur. In such cases, the harm or the risk of harm is described as\nforeseen by the agent but not intended. Dangerous surgery undertaken\nto save a life is one example (Anscombe 1982; Boyle 1991; Uniacke\n1998). Uniacke mentions that the distinction between intended and\nforeseen effects can also be applied to acts of justifiable\nrisk-taking in which the good effect and the bad effect are\n\u201cincompatible outcomes\u201d, noting that a parent might\njustifiably throw a child out of a burning building in an attempt to\nsave its life (1998, s. 3). The parent intends to prevent certain\ndeath, while foreseeing that the rescue might cause death.\n\nCould it be claimed that the rescuing agents foresaw a risk of causing\nharm as a side effect of their attempt at rescue but did not intend to\nrisk harm to those they were trying to rescue? Proponents of double\neffect claim that the physician foresaw but did not intend that the\npatient might not survive risky surgery, that the parent foresaw but\ndid not intend that the child could be killed by the fall, and that\nthe soldier foresaw but did not intend to cause his own death (Uniacke\n1998). But this justification is incomplete for two reasons. First,\nemphasizing that the risk of causing death is foreseen by the\nrescuer but not intended by the rescuer implicitly compares\nthe rescuer\u2019s motives with the motives of agents who aimed to\ncause death as an end, out of malice, callousness, or some other\nwrongful motive. But double effect speaks only about the contrast\nbetween harming as a side effect of promoting a good end and harming\nas part of one\u2019s means of promoting a good end. Second, this\njustification fails to distinguish between intending to impose a risk\nof death on a person by acting in a certain way and intending to cause\ndeath. These agents certainly did not intend to cause death, but they\ndid intend to impose a risk of death on a person by acting in a\ncertain way.\n\nThe physician who undertakes dangerous surgery in a patient who would\notherwise face certain death is attempting to reduce the risk of harm\nto the patient. Undertaking the risky surgery constitutes the\nphysician\u2019s means of lowering the patient\u2019s risk of death.\nThe surgery is chosen because it imposes a lower risk of death on the\npatient than what the patient faced without it. The surgeon intended\nto impose a (lower) risk of death on the patient by undertaking the\nrisky surgery. Given that fact, it is not true that the surgeon did\nnot intend to impose a risk of harm. Imposing a (lower) risk of harm\nin order to prevent a greater harm is exactly what the agent intended\nto do. This was not a foreseen side effect of action, this was what\nconstituted the physician\u2019s attempt to save the patient\u2019s\nlife.\n\nSimilarly, the soldier who throws himself on a grenade is attempting\nto reduce the extent of the harm that the explosion will cause by\nattempting to absorb the force of the explosion with his body. The\nheroic action is chosen because it imposes a very high risk of harm to\nhimself, thereby lowering the risk of harm to others nearby. Such\nrescues seem to be cases in which agents act permissibly when they\nchoose to impose a risk of death on someone as their means of lowering\nthat person\u2019s risk of death (surgery, burning building) or as\ntheir means of lowering the risk of harm to others nearby\n(self-sacrifice). This involves imposing a risk of harm on a person in\norder to promote a good end. It seems that the agents do intend to\nimpose a risk of harm on the person they involve: that is their means\nto the good end. If this is permissible, double effect does not have\nthe resources to explain why it is permissible, since it is harmful\n\u2013 but justifiably harmful \u2013 direct agency. These cases\nsatisfy Warren Quinn\u2019s definition of direct agency as agency in\nwhich \u201charm comes to some victims, at least in part, from the\nagent\u2019s deliberately involving them in something in order to\nfurther his purpose precisely by way of their being so involved\n(agency in which they figure as intentional objects),\u201d and they\nclearly do not satisfy the definition of harmful indirect agency as\nagency \u201cin which either nothing is in that way intended for the\nvictims or what is so intended does not contribute to their\nharm\u201d (1989, p. 343). If the risky surgery is unsuccessful and\nthe patient dies, the surgeon cannot say that what was intended,\ndangerous but potentially life-saving surgery, did not contribute to\nthe harm.\n",
