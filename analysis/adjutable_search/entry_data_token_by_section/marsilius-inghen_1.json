    "main_text": "Teachings || Logic and Epistemology\n2.1 Logic and Epistemology\n\nIn his logic and epistemology, Marsilius followed the nominalist\ntradition of the fourteenth century as exemplified by William of\nOckham and John Buridan. Yet Marsilius never qualified himself as a\nnominalist or follower of Ockham. He was an independent thinker who\nsometimes went back to the older tradition of the thirteenth century\n(e.g., in Peter of Spain), or advocated theories which were more in\nline with ordinary speech, as against the highly specialized views of\nhis contemporaries. Marsilius employed logical methods and discussed\nlogical and epistemological issues in almost all of his writings,\nincluding his commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard,\nwhich, in addition to his works specifically dedicated to logic, were\nalso used as a source for late medieval and early modern treatises on\nlogic.\n\nMarsilius\u2019s nominalism comes to the fore in his views on the\nobject of scientific knowledge, the nature of universals, and the\nlogical doctrine of supposition. His basic assumption is that there\nare only individuals and no universals outside the human mind.\n2.1.1 The Object of Scientific Knowledge\n\nAccording to the Aristotelian standard accepted by Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge must be universal and necessarily true.\nThis is not the case with individual things in the external world,\nsince they are subject to change. Only the conclusion of a true and\nnecessary syllogism can meet the standard. Hence, for Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge is not anything outside the mind, but\nthe mental proposition which refers to individual things and their\nqualities. More specifically, the proper object of scientific\nknowledge is a proposition in the form of a conclusion that has been\ndeduced from necessary\n premises.[4]\n2.1.2 Universals\n\nMarsilius argued that universal concepts such as\n\u2018humanity\u2019 do not refer to real universals outside the\nhuman mind. Accordingly, there is no universal essence in singular\nindividuals. Individuals of one genus or species do resemble each\nother, however, and this resemblance is the foundation of universal\nconcepts in the human mind. The generation of universal concepts is a\nnatural process, which Marsilius described as follows: suppose\nindividual A of species S evokes concept X\nin the human mind. This concept is similar to concept Y which\nhas been evoked by B of the same species S. By\nabstracting from all the differences between X and\nY, the human mind is able to produce another concept,\nZ, which stands for both A and B.\nUniversality is then taken to be a quality of concept Z, the\nproduct of the epistemological operation of abstraction on concepts\nX and Y by the human\n mind.[5]\n2.1.3 Supposition\n\nIn line with his account of the nature of universals, Marsilius\nrejected simple supposition. Logicians such as Peter of Spain had used\nthe notion to indicate that a term stood not for an individual but for\na universal or common nature in the external world, like the term\n\u2018man\u2019 in the proposition, \u2018Man is a species\u2019.\nSince Marsilius rejected the idea of universals existing outside the\nmind, he eliminated simple supposition from the list of different\ntypes of supposition. He was critical of some of his contemporaries\n(e.g., Albert of Saxony) who likewise dismissed the concept of real\nuniversals, yet kept on using the notion of simple supposition. They\nhad changed the meaning of the term, he said, by claiming that a\nwritten or spoken term had simple supposition if it was used to refer\nto a concept in the human mind. Marsilius wondered whether young\nstudents would be able to understand this new meaning of simple\nsupposition, since they would hardly know what concepts are. To avoid\nconfusion, Marsilius decided not to deal with simple supposition at\nall in his\n logic.[6]\n2.1.4 Categories\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Marsilius\nadheres to William of Ockham\u2019s and John Buridan\u2019s view\nthat the ten Aristotelian categories are distinguished by the way they\nrefer to things in extra-mental reality. The emphasis here is on the\n\u2018way they refer to\u2019 things, i.e., their modus\nsignificandi, and not on the things themselves, he argues, since\ndistinct categories like \u2018quantity\u2019 and\n\u2018quality\u2019, while doing so in different manners, may still\nrefer to one and the same individual thing in the outside world, e.g.,\nSocrates. Different categories, therefore, do not represent different\nthings but stand for distinct and unique ways of signifying\n things.[7]\n Together, the ten categories cover all possible ways of speaking\nabout things. Like Buridan, however, Marsilius emphasizes that it is\nimpossible to prove that their precise number is and must be ten, as\nsome philosophers like Albert the Great had claimed. It is only\nlengthy experience that has led philosophers to acknowledge their\nnumber to be\n ten.[8]\n If an additional mode of signifying things was discovered in the\nfuture, Marsilius states, he would readily accept there to be more\nthan ten Aristotelian categories, even though he does not consider\nsuch a discovery to be very\n likely.[9]\n\n\nAccording to Marsilius, the ten Aristotelian categories refer to\nthings in reality which themselves are not signs of other things.\nThese categories are names or concepts of primary intention, as he\ncalls them. However, since there are also names which are used to\nrefer to signs or to names of things and not to things themselves\n\u2014 such as the terms \u2018genus\u2019 and\n\u2018species\u2019, which are called names of secondary intention\n\u2014 there needs to be an additional category of secondary\nintention, beside the ten Aristotelian categories of primary\nintention. This category may be called the \u2018category of\nsigns\u2019 (praedicamentum signi) or the \u2018category of\nterms\u2019 (praedicamentum termini), Marsilius\n says.[10]\n The existence of such a category does not refute the traditional\nnumber of ten categories, since the traditional categories, even\nthough they are names or concepts themselves, do not refer to names or\nconcepts, but to things in reality. In claiming such a category,\nMarsilius goes beyond John Buridan, who does not recognize it, and\nfurther elaborates a position already mentioned by Duns Scotus.\nAccordingly, for the metaphysician who considers \u2018being as\nbeing\u2019 (ens inquantum ens) there are only ten\ncategories, whereas for the logician who deals with \u2018concepts as\nconcepts\u2019 (intentiones per se ) there are more than\nten. In the late Middle Ages, philosophers like John Eck attributed\nthe view that there is an additional category called\npraedicamentum signi to Marsilius of Inghen and his\nfollowers, among whom was the Nominalist John\n Parreut.[11]\n2.1.5 Some Specific Views\n\nMarsilius was his own person when it came to assessing the views of\nothers. In his analysis of the proposition \u2018Socrates is not a\nchimera\u2019 he followed what he called \u2018the Parisian\nmethod\u2019, according to which the proposition is false because the\nterm \u2018chimera\u2019 supposits for nothing, there being no real\nchimeras to which it can refer. Others, however, considered the\nproposition to be\n true.[12]\n\nElsewhere, he departed from the opinions of the Parisian School\n(scola Parisiensis) and opted for the perspective of ordinary\nlanguage or common way of speaking (communis modus loquendi).\nThis was the case with his analysis of the proposition \u2018The\nAntichrist is not, but he will be\u2019. According to the Parisian\nSchool, the term \u2018he\u2019 refers to the thing referred to by\nthe term \u2018Antichrist\u2019. Since there is no Antichrist,\nneither term has reference. But in ordinary language it is different,\nfor there the term \u2018he\u2019 is meant to refer to the future\nAntichrist. Marsilius accepted the latter analysis as sound, despite\nthe authority of the\n former.[13]\n\nIn the definition of ampliation, Marsilius went back to logicians of\nthe thirteenth century such as Peter of Spain, who had defined\nampliation as an extension of supposition, whereas fourteenth-century\nlogicians such as Albert of Saxony did not consider ampliation to be a\nkind of supposition. Marsilius reinterpreted their definition so that\nit fit better with the older tradition. Such efforts to harmonize\nolder and newer positions were typical of the late fourteenth\n century.[14]\n\nRegarding the theory of consequences, Marsilius was in line with John\nBuridan and Albert of Saxony. However, unlike them, he considers the\nconsequence as an oratio, not as a hypothetical proposition,\nproperly speaking. As such, consequences also include statements that\nhave no truth value. Crucial for a consequence is the so-called\nnota illationis, which signifies the necessary connection\nbetween the antecedent and the consequent. This connection is\nunderstood as a relationship of semantic entailment. Similar to Albert\nof Saxony but unlike Buridan, for Marsilius there are no invalid\nconsequences. A consequence is either valid or it is no\n consequence.[15]\n\nIn the context is his theory of consequence, Marsilius treats the\nwell-known issue of coming to be (incipit) and passing away\n(desinit). Here he likewise follows John Buridan, although once\nagain in an independent way. His logical point of view, intentionally\nignoring specific features of physical reality, is striking. For\nexample, he considers the physical distinction between permanent and\nsuccessive things irrelevant to the validity of consequences that\nimply notions of coming to be and passing away. Also, in dealing with\nsuch consequences, he accepts indivisible instances of time for\nmethodological reasons, though physically speaking time is infinitely\ndivisible for him. Here, he joins Albert of\n Saxony.[16]\n\nFinally, Marsilius\u2019s understanding of per se predication\nprovides a similar picture. His point of departure again is Buridan.\nYet, he includes some remarkable new elements. For example, he defines\nper se predication not as a necessary predication, as Buridan\nand most contemporary authors do, but as a predication which excludes\nany contingency. Thus per se predication covers both necessary\npropositions like \u2018Man is a living being\u2019 and impossible\nones such as \u2018Man is a donkey\u2019. Also, he widens the realm\nof per se predications by allowing not only the traditional\ncategorical affirmative per se predication, but also\nhypothetical and negative ones, like \u2018If there are humans, all\nhumans are living beings, and \u2018Man is not a donkey\u2019. Here,\nhis probable sources of inspiration were William of Ockham and Albert\nof\n Saxony.[17]\n",
