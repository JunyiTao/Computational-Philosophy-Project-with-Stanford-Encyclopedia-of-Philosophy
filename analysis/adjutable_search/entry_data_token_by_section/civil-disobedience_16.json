    "main_text": "Responding to Civil Disobedience || A Right to Civil Disobedience\n4.2 A Right to Civil Disobedience\n\nFor Rawls, there is only a moral right to engage in justified\ncivil disobedience. But many other theorists defend at least a limited\nright to engage in civil disobedience irrespective of a particular\nact\u2019s justification, given the general value of the practice.\nDworkin (1978) outlines what such a right of conduct might look like,\nanalogizing civil disobedients with Supreme Court justices, who test\nthe constitutional validity of (unjust) law through direct\ndisobedience of that law. In doing so, they can make law more faithful\nto the principles of justice and fairness that justify it (on\nDworkin\u2019s theory of law). Some theorists accept the value of\nconstitutional challenges but argue that once the law is found by a\nhigh court to be constitutional and disobedients\u2019 initial\nconviction is upheld, disobedients have a duty to accept their\npunishment and recognize the law\u2019s validity (Fortas 1968;\nNussbaum 2019, 177). In contrast, Dworkin argues that forcing citizens\nto obey court decisions \u2013 including the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\u2013 would mean forcing them to do something their conscience\nforbids them to do, which would contravene the constitutional\nimperative, entrenched in the First Amendment and rooted in dignity,\nto respect individuals\u2019 \u201cright to conscience\u201d and\nprotect their freedom of speech.\n\nThe right to conscience, on this account, thus grounds a weak\n\u201cright to break the law\u201d. It is a right in the sense that\none \u201cdoes the right thing to break the law, so that we should\nall respect\u201d the agent when she follows her conscientious\njudgment about doubtful law and refuses to comply with a law that\nrequires her to do what her conscience forbids (Dworkin 1978,\n228\u201337), but it does not ground a right in the strong sense that\nthe government would do wrong to stop her from disobeying. In other\nwords, on this view, the right to disobedience is deemed to be\ncompatible with the state\u2019s right to punish. Contra Cohen (1966,\n6), Rawls (1999, 322), and others, however, Dworkin does not defend\nagents\u2019 moral duty to accept punishment (1985, 114\u20135). He\nconsiders non-evasion of legal sanctions to be a good strategy for\ncivil disobedients denouncing unconstitutional law and unjust policy\n(justice- and policy-based civil disobedience on his\nview) but denies that accepting punishment is a conceptual, moral, or\ntactical requirement for civil disobedience motivated by personal\nconvictions (\u2018integrity-based\u2019 civil disobedience). For\nthe latter, Dworkin argues that utilitarian reasons for punishing\nshould be weighed against the fact that the accused acted out of\nprincipled convictions, and that the balance should generally favor\nleniency.\n\nJoseph Raz puts forward a different account of the right to civil\ndisobedience, insisting that this right extends to cases in which\npeople ought not to exercise the right: it is part of the nature and\npurpose of rights of conduct that they give persons a protected sphere\nin which to act rightly or wrongly. To say that there is a right to\ncivil disobedience is to allow the legitimacy of resorting to this\nform of political action for causes one opposes (Raz 1979, 268). That\nsaid, Raz places great emphasis on the kind of regime in which a\ndisobedient acts, arguing that only in an illiberal regime could\nindividuals have a right to civil disobedience to reclaim their\npolitical participation rights which their illiberal state is\nviolating: they are entitled to \u201cdisregard the offending laws\nand exercise their moral right as if it were recognized by law.\u201d\nRaz adds that \u201cmembers of the illiberal state do have a right to\ncivil disobedience which is roughly that part of their moral right to\npolitical participation which is not recognized in law\u201d (Raz\n1979, 272\u20133). By contrast, in a liberal state, the right to\npolitical activity is, by hypothesis, adequately protected by law and,\nhence, the right to political participation cannot ground a right to\ncivil disobedience.\n\nA different view of rights holds that when a person appeals to\npolitical participation rights to defend her disobedience, she does\nnot necessarily criticize the law for outlawing her action. Lefkowitz\nmaintains that members of minorities can appreciate that democratic\ndiscussions often must be cut short so that decisions may be taken,\nand those who engage in civil disobedience may view current policy as\nthe best compromise between the need to act and the need to\naccommodate continued debate. Nonetheless, they also can point out\nthat, with greater resources or further time for debate, their view\nmight have held sway. Given this possibility, the right to political\nparticipation must include a right to continue to contest the result\nafter the votes are counted or the decisions taken. And this right\nshould include suitably constrained civil disobedience because the\nbest conception of political participation rights is one that reduces\nas much as possible the impact that luck has on the popularity of a\nview (Lefkowitz 2007; see also Smith 2013, ch. 4; Ceva 2015).\n\nAn alternative response to Raz questions whether the right to civil\ndisobedience must be derived from rights to political participation.\nBrownlee (2012, ch. 4) bases the right to civil disobedience on a\nright to object on the basis of sincere conviction. Whether such a\nright would fall under participation rights depends on the\nexpansiveness of the latter rights. When the right to participate is\nunderstood to accommodate only legal protest, then the right\nconscientiously to object, which commonsensically includes civil\ndisobedience, must be viewed as distinct from political participation\nrights.\n\nA further challenge to a regime-focused account is that real societies\ndo not align with a dichotomy between liberal and illiberal regimes;\nrather they fall along a spectrum of liberality and illiberality,\nbeing both more or less liberal relative to each other and being more\nor less liberal in some domains than in others. Perhaps, in a society\nthat approximates a liberal regime, the political-participation case\nfor a right to civil disobedience diminishes, but to make legally\nprotected participation fully adequate, a liberal society would have\nto address Bertrand Russell\u2019s charge that controllers of the\nmedia give defenders of unpopular views few opportunities to make\ntheir case unless they resort to sensational methods such as\ndisobedience (1998, 635).\n",
