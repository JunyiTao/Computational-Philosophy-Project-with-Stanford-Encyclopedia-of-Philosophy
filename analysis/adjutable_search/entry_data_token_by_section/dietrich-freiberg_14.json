    "main_text": "The Separation of the Intellect\n15. Conclusion\n\n\nOn the basis of the survey of Dietrich of Freiberg just given one\nmight surmise that his philosophy in general is consummated in his\ndoctrine of intellect. Such a conclusion, however, would not be\nstrictly correct. Although Krebs in his study of Dietrich concludes\nthat the theory of the intellect was the culmination of his entire\nphilosophical project, William Wallace has shown that Dietrich\u2019s\nqualitative methodology, especially as applied in his optical studies,\nis a valuable contribution to scientific methodology, a fact that can\nbe appreciated independently of his theory of the intellect. It is\nalso possible to argue that his contribution to the discussion\nconcerning the metaphysical status of essence and existence in\ncreatures can be understood without reference to his analysis of\nintellect. And yet one would not wish to undervalue the importance of\nDietrich\u2019s doctrine of mind not only in terms of his own philosophical\nenterprise but also in terms of its influence on the later course of\nmedieval German philosophy, beginning with Meister Eckhart and ending\nwith Nicholas Cusanus.\n\n\nKurt Flasch attempts to put Dietrich\u2019s contributions to the philosophy\nof mind in its proper perspective. To see what Dietrich has\naccomplished we must try to understand how he introduces a new element\ninto medieval scholastic speculations concerning mind. To begin with,\nFlasch notes, Dietrich\u2019s distinction between ens reale and\nens conceptionale replaces the old scholastic distinction\nbetween ens naturae and ens rationis in such a way\nthat it is no longer possible to claim that being as found in the mind\nis dependent upon extra-mental reality. Where Thomas Aquinas claimed\nan exclusive distinction between the two categories of being, Dietrich\nwith his doctrine of coextentionality insists on an inclusive\ndistinction. The result of this new perspective on the priority of\nens conceptionale, Flasch argues, not only grounds a new\nmetaphysics but also establishes a new methodology for studying nature\nbased upon an inclusive understanding of natural being. Looked at in\nthis way Dietrich\u2019s theory of mind can indeed be seen as the\nculmination of his philosophy.\n",
