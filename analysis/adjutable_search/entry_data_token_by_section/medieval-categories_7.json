    "main_text": "Later Middle Ages\n5. Later Middle Ages\n\n\nAfter Aquinas' death in 1274, the number of commentaries written on\nAristotle's Categories multiplied exponentially, of which, as\nwe said before, almost 200 are still extant, although virtually all\nlack a critical edition and / or translation into English.  That said,\nthe most prominent commentators include Giles of Rome, (b. ca. 1245,\nd. 1316), Peter John Olivi (b. 1247, d. 1298), Dietrich of Freiberg\n(b. ca. 1250, d. 1320), Walter Burley (b. ca. 1275, d. ca. 1345),\nAntonius Andreae (b. ca.1280, d. 1320), Durand of St. Pour\u00e7ain\n(b. ca., 1275, d. 1334), Hervaeus Natalis (b. ca.1260, d. 1323), Peter\nof Auvergne, John Buridan (b. 1295, d. 1358/61), Martin of Dacia\n(d. 1304), Simon of Faversham (b. 1260, d. 1306), and Radulphus Brito\n(b. 1270, d. 1320).  \n\n\nSeveral points are worth noting about these commentaries: First,\nMasters in the Arts faculty were formally forbidden from talking about\ntheological matters in their philosophical\ncommentaries. Notwithstanding this formal prohibition, the\ncommentaries on the categories were crucial for subsequent theological\ndiscussions, and the thinnest of pretexts would sometimes occasion a\ndigression into theological territory. Perhaps the most important\ntopic was the definition of an accident and whether or not every\naccident actually inhered in a substance or only had the potential so\nto inhere in it. How one answered this question was extremely\nsignificant in discussions of the Eucharist, in which the quantity of\nthe host, after consecration, no longer had a substance in which to\ninhere.  \n\n\nA second topic concerns the gradual shift away from exposition and\ntoward problem solving (\u2018questions\u2019, as put by Andrews\n2001).  Even though the vast majority of these commentaries are not in\nprint and are difficult to obtain, the commentaries from the two most\ninfluential authors in the later Middle Ages survive and are\navailable. John Duns Scotus' Commentary was written around 1295, and\nWilliam of Ockham's around 1319.\n",
