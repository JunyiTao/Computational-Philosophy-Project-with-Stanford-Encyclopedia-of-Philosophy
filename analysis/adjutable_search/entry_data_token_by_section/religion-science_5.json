    "main_text": "Science and religion in various religions || Christianity\n2.1 Christianity\n\nChristianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion, currently the\nreligion with the most adherents. It developed in the first century CE\nout of Judaism. Christians adhere to asserted revelations described in\na series of canonical texts, which include the Old Testament, which\ncomprises texts inherited from Judaism, and the New Testament, which\ncontains the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (narratives on\nthe life and teachings of Jesus), as well as events and teachings of\nthe early Christian churches (e.g., Acts of the Apostles, letters by\nPaul), and Revelation, a prophetic book on the end times.\n\nGiven the prominence of revealed texts in Christianity, a useful\nstarting point to examine the relationship between Christianity and\nscience is the two books metaphor (see Tanzella-Nitti 2005 for an\noverview): God revealed Godself through the \u201cBook of\nNature\u201d, with its orderly laws, and the \u201cBook of\nScripture\u201d, with its historical narratives and accounts of\nmiracles. Augustine (354\u2013430) argued that the book of nature was\nthe more accessible of the two, since scripture requires literacy\nwhereas illiterates and literates alike could read the book of nature.\nMaximus Confessor (c. 580\u2013662), in his Ambigua (see\nLouth 1996 for a collection of and critical introduction to these\ntexts) compared scripture and natural law to two clothes that\nenvelop the Incarnated Logos: Jesus\u2019 humanity is revealed by\nnature, whereas his divinity is revealed by the scriptures. During the\nMiddle Ages, authors such as Hugh of St. Victor (ca. 1096\u20131141)\nand Bonaventure (1221\u20131274) began to realize that the book of\nnature was not at all straightforward to read. Given that original sin\nmarred our reason and perception, what conclusions could humans\nlegitimately draw about ultimate reality? Bonaventure used the\nmetaphor of the books to the extent that \u201cliber\nnaturae\u201d was a synonym for creation, the natural world. He\nargued that sin has clouded human reason so much that the book of\nnature has become unreadable, and that scripture is needed as an aid\nas it contains teachings about the world.\n\nChristian authors in the field of science and religion continue to\ndebate how these two books interrelate. Concordism is the attempt to\ninterpret scripture in the light of modern science. It is a\nhermeneutical approach to Bible interpretation, where one expects that\nthe Bible foretells scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory\nor evolutionary theory. However, as Denis Lamoureux (2008: chapter 5)\nargues, many scientific-sounding statements in the Bible are false:\nthe mustard seed is not the smallest seed, male reproductive seeds do\nnot contain miniature persons, there is no firmament, and the earth is\nneither flat nor immovable. Thus, any plausible form of integrating\nthe book of nature and scripture will require more nuance and\nsophistication. Theologians such as John Wesley (1703\u20131791) have\nproposed the addition of other sources of knowledge to scripture and\nscience: the Wesleyan quadrilateral (a term not coined by Wesley\nhimself) is the dynamic interaction of scripture, experience\n(including the empirical findings of the sciences), tradition, and\nreason (Outler 1985).\n\nSeveral Christian authors have attempted to integrate science and\nreligion (e.g., Haught 1995, Lamoureux 2008, Murphy 1995), making\nintegration a highly popular view on the relationship between science\nand religion. These authors tend to interpret findings from the\nsciences, such as evolutionary theory or chaos theory, in a\ntheological light, using established theological models such as\nclassical theism or the doctrine of creation. John Haught (1995)\nargues that the theological view of kenosis (self-emptying of God in\ncreation) anticipates scientific findings such as evolutionary theory:\na self-emptying God (i.e., who limits Godself), who creates a distinct\nand autonomous world, makes a world with internal self-coherence, with\na self-organizing universe as the result.\n\nThe dominant epistemological outlook in Christian science and religion\nhas been critical realism, a position that applies both to theology\n(theological realism) and to science (scientific realism). Barbour\n(1966) introduced this view into the science and religion literature;\nit has been further developed by theologians such as Arthur Peacocke\n(1984) and Wentzel van Huyssteen (1999). Critical realism aims to\noffer a middle way between na\u00efve realism (the world is as we\nperceive it) and instrumentalism (our perceptions and concepts are\npurely instrumental). It encourages critical reflection on perception\nand the world, hence \u201ccritical\u201d. Critical realism has\ndistinct flavors in the works of different authors, for instance, van\nHuyssteen (1998, 1999) develops a weak form of critical realism set\nwithin a postfoundationalist notion of rationality, where theological\nviews are shaped by social, cultural, and evolved biological factors.\nMurphy (1995: 329\u2013330) outlines doctrinal and scientific\nrequirements for approaches in science and religion: ideally, an\nintegrated approach should be broadly in line with Christian doctrine,\nespecially core tenets such as the doctrine of creation, while at the\nsame time it should be in line with empirical observations without\nundercutting scientific practices.\n\nSeveral historians (e.g., Hooykaas 1972) have argued that Christianity\nwas instrumental to the development of Western science. Peter Harrison\n(2007) maintains that the doctrine of original sin played a crucial\nrole in this, arguing there was a widespread belief in the early\nmodern period that Adam, prior to the Fall, had superior senses,\nintellect, and understanding. As a result of the Fall, human senses\nbecame duller, our ability to make correct inferences was diminished,\nand nature itself became less intelligible. Postlapsarian humans\n(i.e., humans after the Fall) are no longer able to exclusively rely\non their a priori reasoning to understand nature. They must\nsupplement their reasoning and senses with observation through\nspecialized instruments, such as microscopes and telescopes. As the\nexperimental philosopher Robert Hooke wrote in the introduction to his\nMicrographia:\n\n\nevery man, both from a deriv\u2019d corruption, innate and born with\nhim, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to\nslip into all sorts of errors \u2026 These being the dangers in the\nprocess of humane Reason, the remedies of them all can only proceed\nfrom the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy\n[experiment-based science]. (1665, cited in Harrison 2007: 5)\n\n\nAnother theological development that may have facilitated the rise of\nscience was the Condemnation of Paris (1277), which forbade teaching\nand reading natural philosophical views that were considered\nheretical, such as Aristotle\u2019s physical treatises. As a result,\nthe Condemnation opened up intellectual space to think beyond ancient\nGreek natural philosophy. For example, medieval philosophers such as\nJohn Buridan (fl. 14th c) held the Aristotelian belief that there\ncould be no vacuum in nature, but once the idea of a vacuum became\nplausible, natural philosophers such as Evangelista Torricelli\n(1608\u20131647) and Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) could experiment\nwith air pressure and vacua (see Grant 1996, for discussion).\n\nSome authors claim that Christianity was unique and instrumental in\ncatalyzing the scientific revolution. For example, according to the\nsociologist of religion Rodney Stark (2004), the scientific revolution\nwas in fact a slow, gradual development from medieval Christian\ntheology. Claims such as Stark\u2019s, however, fail to recognize the\nlegitimate contributions of Islamic and Greek scholars to the\ndevelopment of modern science, and fail to do justice to the\nimportance of practical technological innovations in map-making and\nstar-charting in the emergence of modern science. In spite of these\npositive readings of the relationship between science and religion in\nChristianity, there are sources of enduring tension. For example,\nthere is still vocal opposition to the theory of evolution among\nChristian fundamentalists. In the public sphere, the conflict view\nbetween Christianity and science prevails, in stark contrast to the\nscholarly literature. This is due to an important extent to the\noutsize influence of a vocal conservative Christian minority in the\nAmerican public debate, which sidelines more moderate voices (Evans\n2016).\n",
