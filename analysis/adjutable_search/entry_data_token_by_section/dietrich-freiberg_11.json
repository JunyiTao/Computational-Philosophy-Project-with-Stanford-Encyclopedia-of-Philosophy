Empirical and Transempirical Consciousness\n\n\nDoes the disassociation of man from his intellect mean that human\nbeings have knowledge of which they are unaware? How is this possible\ngiven that the intellect has the property of consciousness? After all,\nit does not make any sense to say that one knows something of which he\nis totally unaware. And yet this is precisely what Dietrich claims.\nBurkhard Mojsisch draws attention to the fact that in identifying the\nagent intellect with the abditum mentis (the hiddenness of\nthe mind) of St. Augustine Dietrich establishes a distinction between\nwhat Mojsisch calls \u201ctransempirical consciousness\u201d and\nempirical consciousness. Mojsisch argues that Dietrich held such a\nposition because it is the agent intellect itself that grounds\nempirical consciousness. Since empirical consciousness is the function\nof the possible intellect according to Dietrich, and since in his\nNeoplatonic hierarchy the agent intellect being the cause of the\npossible intellect must be superior to it, it follows that empirical\nconsciousness is due to the causal action of the agent\nintellect. Although this is not the place to pursue a detailed\nphilosophical analysis of Dietrich\u2019s theory, it should be\npointed out that his position fits the facts of common sense and is\nconcordant with some contemporary theories of mind. We surely maintain\nthat we know things that we are unaware of when we are, for example,\nasleep or simply not thinking of them at the moment but could recall\nthem from memory. Peter Geach in his book Mental Acts\ndevelops an analysis of concepts as capacities that are exercised or\nconsciously manifest themselves in acts of judgment. And capacities,\none could argue, need not be continuously exercised to be\ncapacities. Thus it is with regard to Dietrich\u2019s theory of the\nagent intellect; it need not always and everywhere be completely\noperative upon the possible intellect. Indeed, it can remain a\n\u201chiddenness of the mind\u201d for the entirety of a\nperson\u2019s life and still be a reality about the person. Anyone\nwho has ever had the dubious privilege of teaching in a modern\nuniversity knows this to be a truism that borders on the obvious.\n",
