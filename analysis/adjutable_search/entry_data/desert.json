    "preamble": "\n\nClaims about desert are familiar and frequent in ordinary\nnon-philosophical conversation. We say that a hard-working student who\nproduces work of high quality deserves a high grade; that a vicious\ncriminal deserves a harsh penalty; that someone who has suffered a\nseries of misfortunes deserves some good luck for a change. \n\nPhilosophers have made use of the concept of desert in several\ncontexts. In discussions of the nature of justice, several\nphilosophers have advocated versions of the idea that justice obtains\nwhen goods and evils are distributed according to desert. In\ndiscussions of the concept of intrinsic value, some philosophers have\nsuggested that happiness may be the greatest good but it has\noutstanding value only when enjoyed by someone who deserves it. In\ntheories about moral obligation, some consequentialists have defended\nthe idea that right acts lead to outcomes in which higher welfare is\npreferentially distributed to people who deserve it. In social and\npolitical philosophy (or philosophy of law) a number of philosophers\nhave appealed to the concept of desert when discussing the\njustification of penalties for violations of law. \n\nSo appeals to desert appear frequently in many contexts, in philosophy\nas well as in ordinary non-philosophical talk. Yet many questions\nremain about desert: how can it be distinguished from mere\nentitlement? What is its conceptual structure? What kinds of things\ncan be deserving? What kinds of things can be deserved? What kinds of\nproperties can serve as bases on which a deserver deserves a desert?\nHow can claims about desert be justified? \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Desert and Entitlement\n\nIt is important here at the outset that we draw attention to a\ndistinction between desert and another concept with which it\nmight be confused. We will speak of this latter concept as the concept\nof entitlement, though different philosophers use different\nterminology to mark this distinction. \n\nA typical desert claim is a claim to the effect that someone \u2013\nthe \u201cdeserver\u201d \u2013 deserves something \u2013 the\n\u201cdesert\u201d \u2013 in virtue of his or her possession of\nsome feature \u2013 the \u201cdesert\n base\u201d.[1]\n For example, consider the claim that a certain student deserves a\nhigh grade from her teacher in virtue of the fact that she did\nexcellent work in the course. A typical entitlement claim is a claim\nto the effect that someone is entitled to something from someone on\nsome basis. For example, consider the claim that a customer is\nentitled to a refund from a merchant in virtue of the fact that the\nmerchandise he purchased from that merchant had been sold with a\nguarantee and turned out to be defective. \n\nThere are obvious structural similarities between desert claims and\nclaims about entitlement. In typical examples of each sort, someone is\nsaid to deserve (or be entitled to) something from someone on some\nbasis. However, there is an important difference between the concepts\nof desert and entitlement. As the terminology is used here, desert is\na more purely normative concept, while entitlement is a sociological\nor empirical concept. If some social or legal institution is in place\nin your social group, and that institution has a rule that specifies\nsome treatment for those who have some feature, and you have the\nfeature, then you are entitled to that treatment. Thus, for example,\nsuppose that when the customer purchased a certain item, he received a\nlegally binding written guarantee from the seller. The guarantee\nspecified that if the item should turn out to be defective, the seller\nwould either replace the item or refund the money that the buyer had\nspent for the defective item. In such a case, if the buyer satisfies\nthe conditions stated in the guarantee, and the purchased item is\nindeed defective, the buyer is entitled to the refund or replacement.\n\n\nTypical desert claims have a similar structure, but do not always\ndepend in this way on the existence of laws or contracts or other\nsimilar social institutions. A person may deserve some sort of\ntreatment even though there are no rules in place in his society that\ncodify the conditions under which someone deserves that sort of\ntreatment. In such a case, a person may deserve something even though\nhe is not entitled to it. Similarly, a person may be entitled to\nsomething by some rules that are in place in his society even though\nhe does not deserve it. Some examples may help to make this\ndistinction clearer. \n\nConsider an example involving a wealthy grandfather and two\ngrandchildren. One grandchild is vicious and rich; the other is\nvirtuous and poor. The vicious grandchild never treated his\ngrandfather with respect. The virtuous grandchild was always\nrespectful and caring. Suppose the grandfather leaves his entire\nfortune to the vicious grandchild. As the terminology is used here, we\nmay want to describe the situation by saying that the vicious\ngrandchild is entitled to the fortune (the rules of the legal\nsystem are unambiguous on this point), but at the same time we may\nwant to say that he does not deserve it (he already has too\nmuch money; he is a rotten person who never treated his grandfather\nrespectfully). The virtuous grandchild may deserve at least\nsome of the inheritance, but he is not entitled to any of it.\n\n\nAnother example illustrates the same point. Suppose that an athlete\nhas her heart set on doing well in a competition. Suppose she has a\nlot of natural talent and trains diligently for a long time until she\nhas developed championship-level abilities in her sport. Suppose that\nthe training involves quite a bit of sacrifice on her part. Suppose\nthat at the last minute the competition is cancelled, and the athlete\nhas no opportunity to compete. Then we might say that this was a great\nmisfortune for her; she deserved to have a chance to\nparticipate. Unfortunately, there is no rule in the rulebook of the\nathlete\u2019s sport that says that those who have trained diligently\nare to get a chance to participate. Let us assume that there is no\ninstitution in place in the athlete\u2019s society that specifies\nthat those who train hard shall be given a chance to compete. In this\ncase, it would be wrong to say (using the terminology in the way that\nhas been specified) that the athlete is entitled to a chance\nto participate, yet we may still feel that she deserved the\nchance. This seems to be an example of a case in which someone has\ncompletely \u201cnon-institutional\u201d desert of something. \n\nSome philosophers use the expression \u2018pre-institutional\ndesert\u2019 where we use \u2018desert\u2019, and\n\u2018institutional desert\u2019 where we use\n\u2018entitlement\u2019. To avoid confusion, we will use\n\u2018desert\u2019 to refer to the relation that does not\nessentially involve the existence of social or legal institutions, and\n\u2018entitlement\u2019 to refer to the relation that does\nessentially involve the existence of such institutions. Our focus in\nthis article is on desert; we mention entitlement only as it bears on\ndesert. \n2. Deservers, Desert, and Desert Bases\n\nIn his seminal work on desert and justice (Feinberg 1970) Joel\nFeinberg presented a catalog of types of seemingly uncontroversial\ndesert claims: a student might deserve a high grade in virtue of\nhaving written a good paper; an athlete might deserve a prize in\nvirtue of having excelled in a competition; a successful researcher\nmight deserve an expression of gratitude in virtue of having perfected\na disease-preventing serum; a criminal might deserve the contempt of\nhis community in virtue of having committed crimes; the victim of an\nindustrial accident may deserve compensation from his negligent\nemployer; a hard-working public official may deserve to be promoted to\na higher office in virtue of her diligence. Leibniz, Kant, and others\nfocused on examples in which a person is said to deserve happiness in\nvirtue of having been morally excellent. \n\nIn all these familiar cases, the deserver is a person. But as Feinberg\nhimself mentioned, there does not seem to be any conceptual barrier to\nsaying that non-persons may also be deservers. Thus, for example, it\nseems acceptable to say that a beautiful ancient city deserves to be\npreserved; that a unique and formerly vibrant ecosystem deserves to be\nrestored; that the scene of a horrible massacre deserves to be torn\ndown. In moral and political discussions, cases under scrutiny tend to\nbe ones in which deservers are either individual people or groups of\npeople. This should not blind us to the fact that non-persons can also\nbe deservers. \n\nDesert claims also typically involve a desert. This is the\nthing that the deserver is said to deserve. As Feinberg indicated,\nfamiliar deserts include such things as grades, wages, prizes,\nrespect, honors and awards, rights, love, benefits and other such\nthings. Leibniz and Kant would surely insist that we include happiness\namong the possible deserts; and others would insist that we should\nmention welfare. \n\nThose deserts may seem at first to be \u201cpositive.\u201d However,\nthere are \u201cnegative\u201d counterparts. Indeed, some of the\nitems on that list are already negative. Thus, some grades are bad\ngrades, as for example, the F a student might deserve for a very weak\npaper. Other deserts are uniformly negative: burdens, fines, booby\nprizes, contempt, dishonors, onerous obligations, penalties,\ncondemnation, hate, etc. \n\nSome contributors to the literature on desert suggest that every\ndesert is either a plus or a minus. Some speak, in this context of\n\u201cbenefits and burdens,\u201d or advantages and disadvantages.\nHowever, there are cases in which someone deserves something that is\nneither good nor bad, neither a benefit nor a burden. Suppose someone\nwho has done outstanding academic work deserves to get an A, while\nsomeone who has done completely unsatisfactory work deserves to get an\nF. It is reasonable to suppose that the A is a good grade \u2013\nsomething the recipient will be pleased to get \u2013 and the F is a\nbad grade \u2013 something that the recipient will be disappointed to\nget. But suppose a student did mediocre work and deserves a mediocre\ngrade \u2013 a C. This is neither good nor bad, neither a benefit nor\na burden. Nevertheless, someone might deserve it. This would be a case\nin which someone deserves something that is neither\n\u201cpositive\u201d nor \u201cnegative.\u201d \n\nThe same could be true of welfare. Someone might deserve happiness and\n(we may assume) that would be a good thing to get; someone else might\ndeserve unhappiness and (we may assume) that would be a bad thing to\nget. But another person might deserve to be at an intermediate welfare\nlevel, neither happy nor unhappy. While it might be good in some way\nfor the person to be at that neutral welfare level, the thing he\ndeserves would be neither good nor bad. So while it is convenient to\nsay that deserts are benefits or burdens \u2013 things that will be\ngood or bad for the deserver to receive \u2013 in fact some deserts\nare neither benefits nor burdens. \n\nFeinberg suggested that we can distinguish between \u201cbasic\u201d\nand \u201cderived\u201d deserts. He went on to say that basic\ndeserts are always responsive attitudes such as approval and\ndisapproval. On this view, derived deserts are forms of treatment that\nwould be fitting expressions of the more fundamental basic deserts.\nThus, giving a student an A might be the fitting expression for\napproval of her work; giving a student an F might be the most fitting\nexpression of serious disapproval of her work. Some recent\ncontributors to the literature on desert seem to ignore this\ndistinction between basic and derived desert, but others continue to\nemploy the distinction and to treat it as important. Scanlon, for\nexample, makes it a central feature of his conception of desert (see\nScanlon 2013, 2018). \n\nPerhaps the most important and controversial bit of information we\ntypically seek in connection with a claim about desert concerns the\ndesert base. This is generally taken to be the feature in\nvirtue of which the deserver deserves the desert. On this view, a\ndesert base is always a property. If we adopt this view, we will say\n(for example) that the student deserves a high grade in virtue of her\npossession of the property of having produced course work of high\nquality. On another view, a desert base is always a fact. If we\nadopt this view we will prefer to say that the student deserves her\nhigh grade in virtue of the fact that her work was of such high\nquality. \n\nWe are inclined to think that it makes no difference whether we take\ndesert bases to be properties or to be facts. The views seem to be\nintertranslatable. In this article, simply as a matter of convenience,\nwe generally speak of desert bases as properties. \n\nIn some cases there is little debate about whether a certain property\nserves as a desert base for a certain sort of treatment. This may be\nillustrated by the example of the student who produced outstanding\nwork in a course and deserves a high grade. Few would debate the claim\nthat the student deserves the grade in virtue of the high quality of\nher work. The desert base in that case would be having produced\nacademic work of high quality. Similarly consider the case of the\ncold-blooded criminal who has inflicted great harm on many innocent\nvictims. It is reasonable to suppose that he deserves a harsh penalty\nin virtue of his evil behavior. In this case, the desert base is\nsomething like having inflicted great harm on many innocent\nvictims. \n\nIn other cases, however, there would be more controversy about desert\nbases. A good example involves the desert of wages. Suppose an\nemployee works hard, is productive, is loyal to his employer, and in\nvirtue of some health problems in his family, needs more money. We may\nagree in such a case that the employee deserves a raise \u2013 but we\nmay disagree about the basis on which he deserves that raise. \n\nThere is general agreement that properties of certain types cannot\nserve as desert bases. Consider a case in which punishing an innocent\nperson would have good consequences. The person has this property:\nbeing such that punishing him would have good consequences.\nBut it would be seriously counterintuitive to say that the person\ndeserves punishment in virtue of his possession of this property. \n\nCertain general principles about desert bases have been introduced in\nan effort to explain why certain properties seem ineligible to serve\nas desert bases. Perhaps the least controversial principle is the\nso-called \u201cAboutness Principle,\u201d mentioned by Feinberg. In\nits propositional form, this principle says that a person can deserve\nsomething in virtue of a certain fact only if that fact is a fact\n\u201cabout the person.\u201d In its property form, the principle\nwould say that a person can deserve something in virtue of a certain\nproperty only if the person actually has the property. The Aboutness\nPrinciple does not offer any assistance with respect to the punishment\ncase just mentioned. After all, the innocent person in that example\nactually does have the property of being such that punishing him\nwould have good consequences. The fact that punishing him would\nhave good consequences is a fact about him. \n\nSome have said that if someone deserves something, D, in virtue of\nhaving some desert base, DB, then the deserving one must be\nresponsible for having DB (see, for example, Rawls 1971; Rachels 1978;\nSadurski 1985). This \u201cResponsibility Principle\u201d seems to\nbe satisfied by many of the examples already discussed. The good\nstudent, we may suppose, is responsible for having produced good\nacademic work. The cold-blooded criminal, similarly, may seem\nresponsible for his vicious behavior. The hard working employee bears\nsome responsibility for having worked so hard. We may generalize from\nthese cases and conclude that all cases of desert are like this: if\nsomeone deserves something, D, on some basis, DB, then he or she is\nresponsible for having DB. Appeal to the Responsibility Principle\nwould explain why the innocent person does not deserve punishment. He\nis not responsible for having the property of being such that\npunishing him would have good consequences. \n\nA variety of cases have been offered as counterexamples to the\nResponsibility Principle. Feldman (1995a) described a case in which\npatrons at a restaurant became ill as a result of having been served\nspoiled food. He claimed that the patrons in such a case would deserve\ncompensation. The desert base here seems to be having been harmed\nby the negligent food preparation by the restaurant \u2013 yet\nthe patrons were not responsible for having that desert base. They\nwere innocent victims. A similar thing happens in the case of someone\nwho has been egregiously insulted. She may deserve an apology in\nvirtue of having been insulted, but she is not responsible for the\ninsult. Another case mentioned by McLeod involves a child who, through\nno fault of his own, comes down with a painful illness. He deserves\nthe care and sympathy of his parents, yet he is not responsible for\nhaving become ill. \n\nOthers have suggested what may be called \u201cthe Temporality\nPrinciple\u201d: the idea here is roughly this: if someone deserves\nsomething, D, in virtue of having a certain desert base, DB, then he\nor she must already have DB at the time he or she begins to deserve D\n(see, for example, Rachels 1978; Kleinig 1971; Sadurski 1985). You\ncannot deserve something on the basis of a property you will begin to\nhave only later. The Temporality Principle has been invoked in an\neffort to explain why it is wrong to engage in\n\u201cpre-punishment.\u201d It is said that even if a certain person\nis going to commit a crime, he does not begin to deserve punishment\nfor that crime until he actually commits it. This line of thought has\nbeen debated. One problem is that even before he commits the crime,\nthe future criminal already has this property: being such that he\nwill later commit a crime. It might be said that he deserves\npunishment in virtue of already having this property even before he\ncommits the crime. While the Temporality Principle is widely endorsed,\ncounterexamples have been presented (see, for example, Feldman 1995b).\nThose counterexamples have not been universally accepted (see, for\nexample, Smilansky 1996a, 1996b).\n\nIn many cases, when we make a desert claim we mention a\ndistributor. This is the person or institution from whom the\ndeserver deserves to receive the desert. In some cases, the identity\nof the distributor will be clear. In other cases, it is not so clear.\nConsider, for example, the motto that the McDonald\u2019s restaurants\nformerly used: \u2018You deserve a break today.\u2019 No distributor\nis explicitly mentioned in the motto. It just says that you deserve a\nbreak. Perhaps when McDonald\u2019s made this statement, they did not\nhave any particular distributor in mind. Maybe they just thought that\nyou deserve it from someone. The same would be true of the\nGates Foundation\u2019s former motto according to which \u2018Every\nperson deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive\nlife.\u2019 The motto does not mention anyone who has the job of\nensuring that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive\nlife. Given that no one has the capacity to ensure that everyone lives\na healthy and productive life, we may conclude that in this case no\ndistributor is mentioned precisely because no one is qualified to be a\ndistributor. \n\nIn other cases, there is a distributor and its identity is clear.\nConsider, for example, the claim that a certain elderly professor\ndeserves some respect from his unruly students. Here the distributor\nis explicitly mentioned: it is the unruly students. Those who endorse\nthe notion that virtuous people deserve happiness in heaven will\npresumably say that the distributor in that case is God. In social and\npolitical contexts we often find philosophers assuming that citizens\ndeserve certain rights from the government of their country. \n\nIt may seem that we could relocate this reference to the distributor.\nWe could build reference to the distributor into the description of\nthe desert. Thus, instead of saying that the desert in the example\ninvolving the elderly professor is respect, we could say that\nthe desert is respect from his students. \n\nIn some cases a desert statement may also indicate something about the\nstrength of the deserver\u2019s desert of the thing deserved. The\nstrength of someone\u2019s desert of something might be indicated\nloosely, as when we say that someone\u2019s desert of something is\n\u201cvery strong,\u201d or \u201conly slight.\u201d In some cases\nwe can use some numbers to represent strengths of desert, though the\nchoice of a numbering system will be to some extent arbitrary. But\nthere are some important facts here: sometimes you deserve both A and\nB, but you deserve A more than you deserve B; sometimes two different\ndeservers deserve the same thing and it is not possible for both of\nthem to get it; maybe one of them deserves it more than the other.\nSometimes you deserve something, but only to a very slight degree and\nthis desert could easily be overridden by some other consideration.\n\n\nIn many cases a desert statement (if fully spelled out) would also\nindicate some times. One of these is the time of the\ndeserving; the other is the time when the receipt of the desert is\nsupposed to take place. Thus, for example, suppose a lot of money has\nbeen withheld from a certain person\u2019s paycheck each week for a\nwhole year. Suppose in fact the government has withheld more than the\nperson owes in taxes. Then he deserves a refund. Suppose refunds are\nall given out on April 1. We might want to say this: at every moment\nin March, the taxpayer deserves to get a refund on April 1. In this\nexample, the time of the deserving is every moment in March.\nThe time at which the deserver deserves to receive the desert is April\n1. \n3. The Justification of Desert Claims\n\nA number of related questions have been discussed under the general\ntitle of \u2018the justification of desert claims.\u2019 Some\napparently take the question about justification to be a question\nabout epistemic justification (see, for example, McLeod 1995,\n89). If we understand the question in this way, we may want to know\nhow \u2013 if at all \u2013 a person can be epistemically justified\nin believing that (for example) hard work is a desert base for reward.\nOthers take the question about justification in a different way. They\ntake it to be a question about explanation. Consider again\nthe question about the justification of the claim that hard work makes\nus deserve reward. On this second interpretation, the question is:\nwhat explains the fact that hard work is a desert base for reward?\nOthers speak in this context of \u201cnormative force\u201d (see,\nfor example, Sher 1987, xi). They seem to be concerned with a question\nabout what explains the fact that when someone deserves something, it\nis obligatory for others to provide it, or good that it be provided.\nStill others may phrase the question by appeal to concepts of\ngrounding or foundation. They may ask what grounds\nthe fact that those who work hard deserve rewards. Still others write\na bit more vaguely about the analysis of desert claims (see,\nfor example, Feinberg 1970). \n\nThere is a further distinction to be noted. Some who write about the\njustification of desert claims seem to think that it is specific\ndesert claims about particular individuals that call for\njustification. Thus, they might ask for a justification of the claim\nthat Jones deserves a $100 bonus for having worked extra hard over the\nholiday weekend. Others apparently think that what calls for\njustification is a more general claim about desert bases and deserts.\nThey might ask for a justification of the claim that hard\nwork is a desert base for financial reward. \n\nWe will formulate the discussion in the admittedly vague idiom of\njustification of claims about desert bases and deserts. But\nas we understand the question, it can be explicated in this way:\nsuppose someone claims that in general the possession of some desert\nbase, DB, makes people deserve a certain desert, D. If challenged, how\ncould the maker of such a claim support his claim? How could he argue\nfor his assertion? What facts about DB and D could he cite in order to\nshow that he was right \u2013 the possession of DB does make someone\ndeserve D? \n\nSome who write on this topic are \u201cmonists\u201d about\njustification; they apparently assume that there is a single feature\nthat will serve in all cases to justify desert claims. Others are\n\u201cpluralists.\u201d They defend the idea that desert claims fall\ninto different categories, and that each category has its own\ndistinctive sort of justification (see, for example, Feinberg 1970,\nSher 1987, and Lamont 1994). We first consider some monist views. \n\nSome popular views about the justification of desert claims are based\non the idea that such claims can be justified by appeal to\nconsiderations about the values of consequences. Sidgwick seems to be\nthinking of something like this in The Methods of Ethics\nwhere he mentions \u2018the utilitarian interpretation of\nDesert.\u2019 He describes this by saying: \u2018when a man is said\nto deserve reward for any services to society, the meaning is that it\nis expedient to reward him, in order that he and others may be induced\nto render similar services by the expectation of similar\nrewards\u2019 (1907, 284, note 1). (It is not clear that Sidgwick\nmeans to defend this view about desert; he seems to be offering it as\nan account of what a determinist would have to say.) \n\nSidgwick\u2019s statement has direct implications only for cases in\nwhich what is deserved is some sort of reward and the desert base of\nthis desert is some sort of \u2018service to society.\u2019 As a\nresult, it is not clear that this idea about justification, taken\nsimply by itself, has any direct relevance to cases in which someone\ndeserves punishment, or compensation, or a prize for outstanding\nperformance, or a grade for academic work. \n\nAccording to a natural extension of the view that Sidgwick mentioned,\na claim to the effect that someone deserves something, D, in virtue of\nhis possession of some feature, DB, is justified by pointing out that\ngiving the person D in virtue of his possession of DB would have high\nutility. \n\nWhile there surely are some cases in which giving someone what he\ndeserves would have high utility, this link between desert and utility\nis just as frequently absent. To see this, consider a case in which a\nvery popular person has engaged in some bad behavior for which he\ndeserves punishment \u2013 but suppose in addition that no one\nbelieves he is guilty. If he were punished for having done the nasty\ndeed, there would be an outpouring of anger from all of the popular\nperson\u2019s fans and friends who think he has been framed. If our\ninterest were in producing an outcome with high utility, we would have\nto refrain from punishing him. But in spite of that, since in fact he\ndid do the nasty deed, he does deserve the punishment. \n\nIn other cases, giving a person some benefit might have good results\neven though the person does not deserve to receive those benefits. To\nsee this, imagine that a crazed maniac threatens to murder a dozen\nhostages unless he is given a half-hour of prime time TV to air his\ngrievances. Giving him this airtime might have high utility \u2013 it\nmight be the best thing for those in charge to do in the circumstances\n\u2013 but at the same time we might feel that the maniac does not\ndeserve it. \n\nAnother serious problem with the consequentialist approach is brought\nout by consideration of the famous telishment case, also known as\n\u2018The Small Southern Town.\u2019 The example was presented by\nCarritt in his Ethical and Political Thinking, but gained\ngreat notoriety as a result of being quoted at length in Rawls\u2019s\n\u2018Two Concepts of Rules\u2019 (Rawls 1955). Here is the passage\nfrom Carritt:\n\n\u2026if some kind of very cruel crime becomes common, and none of\nthe criminals can be caught, it might be highly expedient, as an\nexample, to hang an innocent man, if a charge against him could be so\nframed that he were universally thought guilty\u2026 (Carritt 1947,\n65)\n\n\nIn this example, punishing an innocent person has high utility because\nit would have great deterrent effect. But the victim of the punishment\ndoes not deserve punishment \u2013 after all, he is innocent. This\nhighlights an important fact about desert and utility: sometimes it\ncan be expedient to give someone a reward or a punishment that he or\nshe does not deserve. \n\nIt appears then that the consequentialist approach confronts\noverwhelming objections. Sometimes deserved treatment is expedient;\nsometimes it is not. Sometimes undeserved treatment is expedient;\nsometimes it is not. As a result, appeals to the utility of giving\nsomeone some benefit or burden cannot justify the claim that the\nperson deserves that sort of treatment. \n\nA second approach to the justification of desert claims is based on\nsome ideas concerning institutions. There are several different ways\nin which this \u201cinstitutional justification\u201d can be\ndeveloped. (Our discussion in this section has benefited enormously\nfrom McLeod 1999b.) \n\nFirst, some background: an institution may be identified by a\nsystem of rules that define positions, moves, penalties, rewards, etc.\nIn some cases the rules of an institution are carefully written down\nand perhaps made a matter of legislation. The system of taxation in\nsome country might be a good example. In other cases the rules of an\ninstitution are not explicitly formalized. An example might be the\nsystem of etiquette governing the writing, sending, replying to, etc.\nof wedding invitations. It is not easy to say what makes an\ninstitution \u201cexist\u201d in a society. That is a puzzle best\nleft to the sociologists. \n\nWe may also need to assume that when people set up institutions, they\ndo so with some intention. They are trying to achieve something; or\nmore likely, they are trying to achieve several different things.\nMaybe different people have different aims. We can say \u2013\nsomewhat vaguely \u2013 that the point of an institution is\nthe main goal or aim that people have in establishing or maintaining\nthat institution. \n\nA person may be governed by some institution even if he does\nnot like it, or does not endorse it. Thus, for example, suppose a\ncriminal justice system exists in a certain state. Suppose some\nmiscreant lives in that state and has been charged with some crime.\nSuppose he is found guilty in a duly established court of law and is\nsentenced to ten years in prison. He is governed by the rules of the\njudicial system whether he likes it or not. To be governed by an\ninstitution one must live (or perhaps be a visitor) in the state or\nsociety where the institution exists, and one must somehow \u201cfall\nunder\u201d the rules. Those rules must \u201capply to\u201d the\nindividual. Again, these are tricky sociological notions, not easily\nspelled out. \n\nSome philosophers have said things that suggest that it is possible to\njustify a desert claim by identifying a currently existing, actual\ninstitution according to which the deserver is entitled to the desert.\nWe can state this idea a bit more clearly: \n\nAID: The claim that a person, S, deserves something, D, on the basis\nof the fact that he has a feature, DB, is justifiable if and only if\nthere is some social institution, I; I exists in S\u2019s society; S\nis governed by I; according to the rules of I, those who have DB are\nto receive D; S has DB.\n\n\nThis \u201cactual institutional\u201d account of desert is almost\nuniversally\n rejected.[2]\n There are several independent sources of difficulty. Most of these\nemerge from the requirement that a desert claim is justifiable always\nand only when there is an appropriate actual social\ninstitution. This produces a number of devastating objections. Suppose\na thoroughly decent person has suffered a number of serious\nmisfortunes. He deserves a change of luck; he deserves some good luck\nfor a change. Suppose he lives in a country where there is no social\ninstitution that supplies compensatory benefits to those who have had\nbad luck. If AID were true, it would be impossible to justify the\nclaim that he deserves it. \n\nAn equally serious objection arises from the fact that some of the\ninstitutions that actually exist are morally indefensible. Let us\nimagine a thoroughly horrible social institution \u2013 slavery.\nSuppose some unfortunate individual is governed by that institution.\nSuppose the institution contains rules that say that slaves who are\nstrong and healthy shall be required to work without pay in the cotton\nfields. Suppose this individual is strong and healthy. Consider the\nclaim that he deserves to be required to work in the fields without\npay in virtue of the fact that he is strong and healthy. AID implies\nthat this desert claim is justified. That is as preposterous as it is\noffensive. \n\nThe general point: we must not lose sight of the fundamental\ndifference between entitlement and desert. AID seems\nto confuse these. It seems to say that you deserve something if and\nonly if you are entitled to it by the rules of an actual institution.\nSince there are bad institutions, and cases in which desert arises in\nthe absence of institutions, this is clearly a mistake. \n\nWe can deal with all of these objections by altering the institutional\naccount of justification. Instead of making the justification of a\ndesert claim depend upon the existence of an actual social\ninstitution, we can make it depend upon the rules that would be\ncontained in some ideal social institution. The main change is that we\nno longer require that the social institution exists. We require\ninstead that it be an ideal institution \u2013 an institution that\nwould be in some way excellent or preferable. Then we can attempt to\njustify desert claims by saying that the deservers would be entitled\nto those deserts by the rules of an ideal social institution. \n\nWe can state the thesis this way:\n\nIID: The claim that a person, S, deserves something, D, on the basis\nof the fact that he has a feature, DB, is justifiable if and only if\nthere is some possible social institution, I; I would be ideal for\nS\u2019s society; S would be governed by I; according to the rules of\nI, those who have DB are to receive D; S has DB.\n\n\nBefore we can evaluate this proposal, we have to explain in greater\ndetail what makes a possible institution \u201cideal\u201d for a\nsociety. We might try to define ideality by saying that an ideal\ninstitution is one that would distribute benefits and burdens to\npeople precisely in accord with their deserts. With this account of\nideality in place, IID generates quite a few correct results.\nUnfortunately, it would be unhelpful in the present context. After\nall, the aim here is to explain how desert claims can be justified.\nThis account would explain desert by appeal to ideal institutions, and\nthen explain ideal institutions by appeal to desert. \n\nFollowing the rule utilitarians, we could attempt to define ideality\nby saying that a possible institution is ideal for a society if and\nonly if having it as the society\u2019s institutional way of\nachieving its point would produce more utility than would the having\nof any alternative institution. This yields a form of the\ninstitutional approach that seems importantly similar to the\nconsequentialist approach already discussed. \n\nUnfortunately, with this conception of ideality in place, the proposal\nseems to inherit some of the defects of the simpler consequentialist\napproach. It implies, for example, that if it is possible for there to\nbe a seriously unfair but nevertheless utility maximizing institution,\nthen people would deserve the burdens allocated to them by the rules\nof that institution, even if it were not in place. \n\nA further difficulty arises in connection with actual but not\noptimific institutions. Suppose, for example, the utility maximizing\nice-skating institution would have rules specifying that in order to\nwin the gold medal, a competitor must perform a 7 minute free program;\na 6 minute program of required figures; and that all contestants must\nwear regulation team uniforms consisting of full length trousers and\nmatching long-sleeved team shirts. Suppose in fact that this\ninstitution is not in place in Nancy\u2019s society. Suppose instead\nthat the de facto institution contains some slightly different but\nstill fairly reasonable rules for ice-skating competitions. Suppose\nNancy abides by all the relevant extant rules and is declared the\nwinner in a competition. She is entitled to the gold medal by the\nactual rules. It may seem, in such a case, that her claim to deserve\nthe medal would be justified. But since she would not be entitled to\nit by the rules of the ideal institution, IID implies that it is\nimpossible to justify her claim that she deserves the medal by virtue\nof her performance here tonight. \n\nIt appears, then, that difficulties confront the attempt to justify\ndesert claims by appeal to claims about the entitlements created by\ninstitutions, actual or ideal. \n\nSome philosophers have drawn attention to alleged connections between\ndesert claims and facts about \u201cappraising attitudes\u201d or\n\u201cresponsive attitudes\u201d (see, for example, Feinberg 1970).\nCommentators have understood these philosophers to have been defending\nthe idea that desert claims can be justified by appeal to facts about\nappraising attitudes. Some have said, for example, that David Miller\ndefended a view of this sort in his Social Justice (1976).\nWhile there may be debate about whether Miller actually intended to be\ndefending such a view, it is worthwhile to consider it. (In the\ndiscussion that follows we are indebted to McLeod 1995 and McLeod\n2013.) \n\nWe need first to understand what is meant by \u2018appraising\nattitude.\u2019 \n\nAdmiration, approval, and gratitude are typically cited as examples of\n\u201cpositive\u201d appraising attitudes. In each case, if a person\nhas such an attitude toward someone, he has that attitude in virtue of\nsome feature that he takes the person to have. Suppose, for example,\nthat you admire someone; then you must admire her for something\nshe is or something she did. Maybe she worked hard; or wrote a\ngood paper; or can run very fast; or is able to play the violin\nbeautifully. Similarly for the other positive appraising attitudes.\n\n\nDisapproval, resentment, contempt, \u201cthinking ill of,\u201d and\ncondemnation may be cited as examples of \u201cnegative\u201d\nappraising attitudes. They are similar to the positive attitudes in\nthis respect, if you disapprove of someone, then you must disapprove\nof him for something he is or something he did. Maybe he\nplagiarized a paper; maybe he is totally out of shape; maybe he is\nutterly talentless. \n\nMiller says that if we did not have these attitudes, \u2018we would\nnot and could not use the concept of desert\u2019 (1976, 89). He also\nsays that the range of possible desert bases coincides with the range\nof bases for appraising attitudes. You cannot deserve something on the\nbasis of your possession of a property, DB, unless we could have an\nappraising attitude toward you on the basis of your possession of DB.\nBut what is most important for our present purposes is that, according\nto Miller, \u2018the existence of these appraising attitudes makes\nintelligible the connection between a desert judgment and its\nbasis\u2019 (89). Some have understood Miller to be claiming that\nsomething about these appraising attitudes provides the answer to our\nquestion about the justification of desert claims. \n\nA certain appraising attitude may seem appropriate to a desert claim.\nFor example, suppose a person feels strong approval (a positive\nappraising attitude) of a subject in virtue of his heroic action. The\nattitude would be appropriate to the claim that the hero deserves a\nreward for his heroism. On the other hand, if someone feels contempt\n(a negative appraising attitude) for a person in virtue of his\ncowardice, then this attitude would be appropriate to the claim that\nthe coward deserves some sort of penalty. On one possible view,\nwhether a desert judgment is justifiable depends upon whether the\nperson who makes that judgment has an appraising attitude that is\nappropriate to the desert claim. \n\nThis view (presumably not Miller\u2019s) is clearly confused. Suppose\nthe leader of a terrorist gang claims that a member of his gang\ndeserves respect for having set off a suicide bomb in an elementary\nschool. Suppose the leader has great admiration for this the gang\nmember precisely because he set off the bomb. On the current proposal,\nsince the leader in fact has a positive appraising attitude toward the\nmember, his desert claim is justified. That cannot be right. \n\nThe difficulty cannot be resolved by appealing to the reactions of the\ncommunity. It is easy enough to imagine a case in which the\noverwhelming majority of the bomber\u2019s community admire him for\ndestroying the elementary school. Surely, however, no matter how many\nof his compatriots admire him for doing this deed, the claim that he\ndeserves admiration for having done it is still not justified. \n\nInstead of appealing to facts about the appraising attitudes that\nothers in fact have, we might consider a different question: what sort\nof appraising attitude would be fitting for others to have in virtue\nof the fact that he has committed this deed? If it would be fitting\nfor others to admire him for bombing the school, then he deserves\nadmiration. If it would be fitting for others to hold him in contempt\nfor bombing the school, then he deserves contempt. \n\nIn general, then, we might say that the claim that S deserves a\ncertain benefit (burden) in virtue of having done X is justified if\nand only if it would be fitting for observers to have a positive\n(negative) appraising attitude toward S in virtue of his having done\nX. \n\nThis proposal seems misguided for several reasons. First, it seems to\nbe circular. It purports to explain the justification of desert claims\nby appeal to claims about what appraising attitude would be\n\u201cfitting.\u201d But to say that it would be fitting for someone\nto receive a certain benefit is dangerously close to saying that he\ndeserves to receive it. In this form the proposal seems circular. \n\nFurthermore, it appears that there are cases in which a person\ndeserves something but in which no appraising attitude seems to be\nfitting. Suppose, for example, that an abandoned child is in need of\nmedical care and nurturance. The fact that the child is sick does not\nmake it appropriate for onlookers to admire her or to condemn her. It\ndoes not call for any \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d\nappraising attitude. Nevertheless, the claim that the child deserves\nmedical care and nurturance in virtue of her need might be justified.\nThis objection presents a genuine difficulty only if every appraising\nattitude is a favorable or an unfavorable attitude. If we assume that\npity, or compassion, is also an appraising attitude, the problem\nmentioned here will not arise.\n\nIn his (1970) Feinberg hints at a different way in which appraising\nattitudes might figure in the justification of desert claims. Feinberg\nstarts by noting that \u2018reasonable men naturally entertain\ncertain responsive attitudes toward various actions, qualities, and\nachievements.\u2019 Those who engage in the actions or manifest the\nqualities thereby deserve to be the subjects of the responsive\nattitudes. Going further, we can say that various forms of treatment\n\u2013 punishments, rewards, prizes, etc. \u2013 are the customary\nway of expressing the natural responsive attitudes. When such forms of\ntreatment are in this way the customary and natural ways of expressing\nthe attitudes, then those who engage in the action or manifest the\nquality deserve, in a derived way, to receive the treatment. The\nsuggestion, then, is that in such cases the claim that someone\ndeserves D on the basis of his possession of DB can be justified by\npointing out that giving D is the conventional way of expressing the\nresponsive attitude that reasonable men entertain toward those with\nDB. \n\nIf understood in the suggested way, this account would rely on some\nproblematic assumptions about the responsive attitudes that\n\u2018reasonable men naturally entertain.\u2019 We might well doubt\nwhether all such men invariably entertain those attitudes in cases\nwhere the recipients deserve to be their subject. In any case where\nonly some reasonable men entertain the attitudes, it would be\nimpossible to justify the associated desert claims. On the other hand,\nif we required merely that some reasonable men entertain the attitudes\nin question, then it would become far too easy to justify dubious\ndesert claims. Furthermore, it would make it possible for there to be\ncases in which someone both deserves a certain treatment and also\ndeserves not to get that treatment. \n\nThe details of the appraising attitudes approach remain controversial.\n\n\nA few philosophers \u2013 including George Sher (1987) and Julian\nLamont (1994) \u2013 said things that suggest a pluralistic approach\nto the question about the justification of desert claims. On this\nview, there are several different \u201cexternal values\u201d;\ndifferent values would be relevant in different cases; different\ndesert claims would be justifiable by appeal to different external\nvalues. Thus, for example, consider the claim that you deserve a\nreward for having saved a life. The external value in this case might\nbe some combination of the value of courage and the alleged value of\nhuman life. Consider a different case in which someone claims that you\ndeserve a high grade for having done outstanding work in a course. In\nthis case, the external value might be the value of academic\nachievement. In every case, a desert claim \u2013 if it can be\njustified at all \u2013 can be justified by pointing out that giving\nthe deserver the desert would properly respect the associated external\nvalue. A full exposition of this approach would require a detailed\naccount of what makes a certain external value be relevant to a desert\nclaim; it would also require a detailed account of what is meant by\nsaying that some action would \u201cproperly respect\u201d some\nexternal value. \n4. Desert and Intrinsic Value\n\nHere is a natural and appealing idea: it is a good thing when people\nget what they deserve. If I am distributing raises, and only Jones\ndeserves a raise, then it would be better for me to give the raise to\nJones than to anyone else.\n\nAs simple and straightforward as this idea is, given certain\nbackground assumptions it raises difficult questions about the\nconnection between desert and \u201cgoodness,\u201d or intrinsic\nvalue. \n\nSome consequentialist moral theories make use of (and so presuppose\nthe intelligibility of) the notion of the \u201cintrinsic value of a\nstate of affairs,\u201d or the \u201cintrinsic value of a possible\nworld.\u201d This notion of intrinsic value is a quantitative one:\nconsequentialists usually assume that we can choose a unit for\nmeasuring intrinsic value, and in terms of that unit we can say that\nthe intrinsic value of one possible world is 100 units, while the\nintrinsic value of another is, say, merely 10 units. \n\nCommon forms of consequentialism go on to say that whether an action A\nis permissible or impermissible is determined by how the intrinsic\nvalue of the world that would be actual if A were performed compares\nto the intrinsic values of the worlds that would be actual if the\nalternatives to A were performed instead. (The alternatives to A are\nthe actions other than A that are \u201copen\u201d to the agent at\nthe time he performs A.) One standard form of consequentialism says\nthat an act A is permissible if and only if none of the worlds that\nwould be actual were the agent to perform one of the alternatives to A\nhas a greater intrinsic value than the world that would be actual were\nhe to perform A. Thus, in a consequentialist framework, if one holds\nthat facts about desert make a difference to intrinsic value, one may\nalso hold that facts about desert make a difference to whether an act\nis permissible or impermissible. If, in virtue of the fact that only\nJones deserves a raise, it is better to give a raise only to Jones,\nthen the right thing to do is to give the raise only to Jones. \n\nThis section started with the generalization that, other things being\nequal, it is a good thing when people get what they deserve. We have\njust seen that in a consequentialist framework this generalization\nabout value leads naturally to another one, about moral obligation:\nother things being equal, one ought to ensure that people get what\nthey deserve. But one might endorse the second generalization without\nthe first. Some opponents of consequentialism hold that talk of\n\u201cthe intrinsic value of a possible world\u201d makes no sense\n(for example, Thomson 2008). They could still accept that, other\nthings being equal, one ought to ensure that people get what they\ndeserve. One could hold, for example, that the obligation to ensure\nthat people get what they deserve is a prima facie duty, in\nthe sense that W. D. Ross (2002) attaches to this phrase. \n\nSome consequentialists have hoped that basing their theory of\nobligation on a \u201cdesert-sensitive\u201d theory of intrinsic\nvalue will make their theory immune to certain common objections. To\nget a sense of what these philosophers hope to accomplish we will need\na more detailed statement of a theory of intrinsic value. We will make\nuse of the notion of individual welfare, or well-being. Talk of\nsomeone\u2019s well-being is talk of how good their life is for them.\nWe may speak of how good someone\u2019s life is at a particular\nmoment, or how good their life is as a whole; our focus here is on\nwelfare-values of entire lives. Let us assume, as is common in\ndiscussions of desert, that welfare is a quantitative notion. We can\nchoose a unit for measuring welfare; then for each person there is,\nrelative to that choice of unit, a number that represents how good\nthat person\u2019s life is for them. One simple\n(non-desert-sensitive) theory of intrinsic value for possible worlds\nsays that the (number representing) the intrinsic value of a world is\nequal to the sum of the numbers representing the \u201cwelfare\nvalues\u201d of the lives of the people in that world. \n\nAccording to standard consequentialism, combined with this theory of\nintrinsic value, \u201cdistribution does not matter.\u201d All that\nmatters, for determining whether an act is right, is the sum total of\nthe welfare in the world that would be actual if that act were\nperformed, and how that sum total differs from the totals in the\nworlds that would be actual if some alternative act were performed; it\ndoes not matter how good any particular individual\u2019s life is.\nJohn Rawls famously argued that this is an objectionable feature of\nthe theory (Rawls 1971, 26; his target is a slightly different theory\nof intrinsic value). \n\nA desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value might yield a version of\nstandard consequentialism that evades this objection. If worlds in\nwhich people get what they deserve are better than worlds in which\npeople do not, then it is not true that distribution does not matter.\nA desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value could say that, if Smith\nand Jones each deserves 25 units of welfare, then a world in which\nthey each receive 25 units is better than a world in which Smith\nreceives 50 and Jones receives 0. \n\nFeldman (1995a, 567) is explicit that the goal of his desert-sensitive\nversion of consequentialism is to respond to Rawls\u2019 objection.\nHe suggests that his theory can handle many of the examples commonly\nthought to raise problems for consequentialism, such as the Organ\nTransplant. In another paper Feldman suggests that a desert-adjusted\ntheory of intrinsic value can avoid Parfit\u2019s Repugnant\nConclusion (see Feldman 1995c; for the Repugnant Conclusion, see\nParfit 1984; for reservations about Feldman\u2019s response to\nRawls\u2019 objection, and an alternative, see McLeod 2006). \n\nWhat might a desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value, one that might\nform the basis for a desert-sensitive version of consequentialism,\nlook like? To evaluate desert-adjusted theories of intrinsic value we\nneed to see them stated at a greater level of detail than we have seen\nso far. Presumably, if it is a good thing when people get what they\ndeserve, then if the people in world w1 are closer\nto getting what they deserve than the people in world\nw2, w1 is better (has a greater\nintrinsic value) than w2 (other things being equal).\nBut, again, intrinsic value is a quantitative notion. So it makes\nsense to ask: how much better is w1 than\nw2? 10 units? 100 units? Even if we say a lot more\nabout what worlds w1 and w2 are\nlike, the answers to these questions are not obvious. \n\nTo make a start let us go back to an assumption we quietly made three\nparagraphs back: that welfare levels are among the things that people\ndeserve. This claim does not seem controversial. It follows from the\ncommon idea that the wicked deserve to suffer, and the saintly deserve\nto prosper, for to prosper is to have a relatively high welfare level.\nBut philosophers who attempt to formulate (welfarist) desert-sensitive\ntheories of intrinsic value often make a stronger assumption: that\nwhen it comes to determining the intrinsic value of a possible world,\nall that matters is the extent to which people get the\nwelfare levels they deserve. Suppose I deserve an apology from my\nneighbor in virtue of the fact that he (inadvertently) tore up some of\nthe plants in my yard. But suppose also that I do not really care\nabout my yard, or about the quality of my relationship with my\nneighbor. Getting the apology would mean nothing to me, nor would I be\nupset if my neighbor did not apologize. The apology would not make my\nlife better or worse. Then on the stronger assumption, the intrinsic\nvalue of the world is not higher if I get the apology than if I\ndon\u2019t \u2013 even though only if I get the apology do I get\nsomething I deserve. \n\nOne possible justification for this assumption goes as follows. Even\nthough we may deserve all sorts of things, only instances of\nsomeone\u2019s deserving a certain welfare level are instances of\n\u201cmoral desert.\u201d And only moral desert\n\u201cmatters\u201d for the intrinsic value of a possible world. A\ntheory that says the world is no better if I get that apology is not\nfalse-but-legitimately-oversimplified. It is saying the truth.\nAccording to this line of thought, it is not, in fact, always better\nwhen people get what they deserve. It is only better if they get what\nthey morally deserve. (Shelly Kagan focuses on moral desert,\npresumably to the exclusion of other kinds of desert, in chapter 1 of\nhis 2012.) \n\nJustified or not, most work on desert-sensitive theories of intrinsic\nvalue does assume that the only instances of desert that matter are\ninstances of deserved welfare. What should a desert-sensitive theory\nof intrinsic value that makes this assumption look like? If the value\nof a possible world is a function, not just of the welfare levels of\nthe people in that world, but also of the welfare levels they deserve,\njust which function is it? \n\nProducing a theory that answers this question and is initially\nplausible is not easy. One way to approach the problem is to start\nwith another simplifying assumption. The simple non-desert-sensitive\ntheory of intrinsic value stated above is \u201ctotalist\u201d; the\nintrinsic value of a possible world is got by summing up\n\u201ccontributions\u201d made by each individual\n\u201cseparately.\u201d The amount of intrinsic value contributed by\nan individual is equal to (or proportional to) that person\u2019s\nwelfare level. We could try for a desert-sensitive theory that is also\ntotalist. The contribution made by an individual will not (or not\nalways) be equal to their welfare level; the amount they deserve will\nalso be relevant. Still, the value of the world as a whole will just\nbe the sum of the individual contributions.\n\nHere is a sketch of a theory like this. It treats someone\u2019s\ndesert level as a \u201cmultiplier.\u201d The value an individual\ncontributes to the intrinsic value of a possible world is equal to the\nproduct of the welfare level they receive in that world and the\nwelfare level they deserve. (A more sophisticated treatment of the\nidea of \u201cdesert-as-multiplier\u201d may be found in Kagan 2012,\nsection 2.4.) \n\nThis theory says plausible things about simple cases. If Smith\ndeserves 10 units of welfare and Jones deserves 20, and you can either\nensure that Smith receives 10 units, or that Jones receives 10 units,\nthe theory says that it is better to ensure that Jones receives the 10\nunits. For if Smith receives the welfare, the total value of the world\nwill be equal to 100, while if Jones does, the total value will be\nequal to 200. These facts are summarized in the table below (the\nmultiplications in the contribution columns are \u201cwelfare level\ntimes desert level\u201d): \n\n\nWho gets the welfare?\nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019s contribution\nTotal value\n\nSmith\n10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n100\n\nJones\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n10 \u00d7 20 = 200\n200\n\n\nThe idea behind using deserved welfare levels as multipliers is that\nthe welfare of more deserving people is worth more than that of less\ndeserving people. As far as the quality of the lives of the\nindividuals involved are concerned, 10 units of welfare is 10 units of\nwelfare, no matter who it \u201cgoes to\u201d: if Smith\u2019s life\nis made better by 10 units of welfare, his life is made better by the\nsame amount as if Jones\u2019 life is made better by 10 units. But as\nfar as the world is concerned, it does make a difference who\nthe 10 units goes to. When 10 units of welfare goes to someone highly\ndeserving, someone who deserves a high welfare level, the value of\nthat 10 units is \u201caugmented,\u201d so that 10 units of welfare\ncorresponds to a much larger number of units of value-for-the-world.\n\n\nWhile the desert-as-multiplier idea gets some cases right, it gets\nother cases very wrong. Think again of Smith and Jones, deserving 10\nand 20 units of welfare, respectively. Suppose that, if you do\nnothing, Jones will live a life worth 100 units, and Smith will live a\nlife worth 0 units. Your only two options are to act so that Jones\nlives a life worth 110 and Smith \u201cstays where he would have\nbeen\u201d (he lives a life worth 0), or act so that Jones stays\nwhere he would have been, and Smith lives a life worth 10. The table\nbelow shows the values of the worlds that correspond to each of your\noptions, according to this theory:\n\n\nOption \nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019 contribution\nTotal value\n\nDo nothing\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n100 \u00d7 20 = 2000\n2000\n\nAugment Smith \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n100 \u00d7 20 = 2000\n2100\n\nAugment Jones\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n110 \u00d7 20 = 2200\n2200\n\n\nThe theory says you should augment Jones. This is implausible. Even if\nyou do nothing, Jones will be living a life far better than the one he\ndeserves to be living. What sense is there in making his life better,\nwhen instead you could cause Smith to be living a life he deserves,\nrather than one worse than he\n deserves?[3]\n\n\nIt seems wrong to multiply every bit of welfare Jones receives by 20,\neven bits of welfare that put him way above the level of welfare he\ndeserves, when computing his contribution to the intrinsic value of\nthe world. This failure of the desert-as-multiplier view suggests an\nalternative mathematical role for deserved welfare levels. What is\nimportant is not the welfare level you deserve, but how close\nyou are to the welfare level you deserve: how good the\n\u201cfit\u201d is between what you get and what you deserve. A\nnatural way to measure fit is to look at the distance between what you\nget and what you deserve: the absolute value of the difference between\nyour welfare level and your deserved welfare level. (So when Jones\ndeserves 20 units and gets 100, his \u201cfit value\u201d is the\nnumber 80.) \n\nHaving latched on to the importance of fit values, how should we make\nuse to them? The simplest way to implement the idea that \u2018the\ncloser one is to getting what one deserves, the better\u2019 defines\nthe contribution made to intrinsic value by an individual as follows:\n\n \nContribution = welfare level \u2212 fit value.\n\n\nThe minus sign is there because someone\u2019s fit value goes up as\ntheir welfare level gets farther away from their deserved welfare\nlevel. Thus increases in the fit value correspond to worse states of\naffairs; so we want fit values to make a negative impact on\ncontributions. \n\nThis new theory gives a plausible judgment about our second\nSmith/Jones case. Here are the values it assigns: \n\n\nOption\nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019 contribution\nTotal value\n\n\nDo nothing \n\u00a00 \u2212 |10\u22120| = \u221210 \n100 \u2212 |20\u2212100| = 20 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \n\n\nAugment Smith \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \u2212 |10\u221210| = 10 \n100 \u2212 |20\u2212100| = 20 \n30 \n\n\nAugment Jones \n\u00a00 \u2212 |10\u22120| = \u221210 \n110 \u2212 |20\u2212110| = 20 \n10 \n\n\n\nPhilosophers have articulated other principles they think a\ndesert-sensitive theory of value should entail, and have proposed yet\nmore complicated \u201ccontribution formulas\u201d as parts of\ntheories of that sort. For example, Eric Carlson holds that if you\nhave a bunch of people with the same desert level, and you \u201chave\na fixed amount of welfare to distribute between them\u201d (really,\nin each world that you can \u201cmake actual\u201d the sum of their\nwelfare levels is the same), then the world in which they all receive\nthe same welfare level should have the greatest intrinsic value. Equal\nlevels of welfare are best, when everyone is equally deserving. The\ntheory we just described is incompatible with this idea. (For\nCarlson\u2019s theory, which does entail this principle, see Carlson\n1997. Feldman 1995a articulated many ideas about how intrinsic values\nshould be adjusted to take desert into account. Persson 1997\ndistinguished the idea of desert as a multiplier (he called it the\n\u201cmerit idea\u201d) from the idea that what matters is the fit\nbetween desert and receipt; he sees both ideas at work in\nFeldman\u2019s paper. Other constraints people have wanted to place\non a desert-sensitive theory may be found in Carlson 1997, Arrhenius\n2006, and Skow 2012.) \n\nThe theories we have discussed so far aim to be \u201coverall\u201d\ntheories of intrinsic value, theories of intrinsic value all things\nconsidered, even if they may make some simplifying assumptions about\nwhat is valuable. Another approach to theorizing about desert aims to\ndo something different. Shelly Kagan, in his book The Geometry of\nDesert (2012), aims at a theory of \u201cintrinsic value from\nthe perspective of desert.\u201d To have a complete theory of\nintrinsic value one would have to take Kagan\u2019s theory and find a\nway to combine it with theories of value from other perspectives. \n\nKagan\u2019s book is by far the most comprehensive discussion of the\nrole of desert in the theory of value. He discusses both\n\u201cnoncomparative desert\u201d and \u201ccomparative\ndesert.\u201d Without trying to be too precise about this\ndistinction, comparative desert concerns how the fit between one\nperson\u2019s welfare level and desert level compares to that of\nothers; noncomparative desert ignores these comparisons. His theory of\nnoncomparative desert comprises several claims, the core of which are\nthese: \n\nIt is best, from the perspective of noncomparative desert, when\nsomeone gets exactly the welfare level they deserve. (That is, a world\nin which he gets exactly what he deserves is better than a world in\nwhich he gets more or less, other things being equal.)\nIf someone has a positive desert level, then it is better, from the\nperspective of noncomparative desert, if they get more than they\ndeserve, than if they get less (by the same amount); moreover, the\ndegree to which it is better to get more than one deserves increases\nas one\u2019s desert level increases. The opposite is true if someone\nhas a negative desert level.\n\n\nThe image below illustrates these claims. Each \u201cmountain\u201d\nplots an individual\u2019s value, from the perspective of\nnon-comparative desert, as a function of their welfare level. The\n\u201cpeak\u201d of a person\u2019s mountain sits directly above\nthe welfare level that person (non-comparatively) deserves; this\nillustrates claim 1, that things are best when someone gets they\nwelfare level they deserve. Note also that the mountain on the\nleft-hand side of the y-axis has a steeper eastern slope than western\nslope. This illustrates part of claim 2. It indicates that if you\ncould either overcompensate a person who deserves a negative amount of\nwelfare, or undercompensate him, by the same amount, it is better to\nundercompensate him. The mountain on the right-hand side of the y-axis\nillustrates the corresponding claim about someone with \u201cpositive\ndesert\u201d: it is better to overcompensate than to undercompensate\nsuch a person. The image also illustrates a claim that Kagan calls\n\u201cBell Motion\u201d (this claim is also part of 2): the\nmountains \u201cswing\u201d in a counter-clockwise direction, as\nthey move from left to right in the diagram. Mountains farther to the\nright have shallower eastern slopes and steeper western slopes. This\nmeans, among other things, that if you have to overcompensate one\nperson by a fixed amount, it is best to overcompensate the person with\nthe highest desert level. Overcompensating makes things worse from the\nperspective of non-comparative desert; overcompensating the most\ndeserving person is, however, less bad, brings about a smaller\nvertical drop in the graph, than overcompensating anyone else would.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nSo far we have been discussing Kagan\u2019s theory of non-comparative\ndesert. His theory of comparative desert is meant to answer questions\nlike the following: suppose that there are two people, that one of\nthem is getting more welfare than he deserves, and that there is\nnothing we can do about that. What must the welfare level of the other\nperson be, if the demands of comparative desert are to be perfectly\nsatisfied? Kagan advocates what he calls the \u201cY-gap\u201d view.\nThe image below illustrates this view. Suppose that the mountain on\nthe left represents the person whose welfare level we cannot control,\nand the mountain on the right represents the person whose welfare\nlevel we can control. Then we should overcompensate the person on the\nright by that amount which results in his Y-gap being the same as that\nof the person on the left. A person\u2019s Y-gap is the vertical\ndistance between the peak of his mountain, and his actual location (in\nthis case) on the eastern slope. The vertical bars in the diagram\ndepict the two Y-gaps. In this case, although the person on the left\nis over-compensated by amount A, the person on the right must be\nover-compensated by a greater amount B, to achieve the same Y-gap, and\nso to perfectly satisfy the demands of comparative desert, as Kagan\nsees them. \n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nOne question about Kagan\u2019s theory is, what exactly are we\nmeasuring when we measure intrinsic value from the perspective of\ndesert? In his book Kagan remains agnostic about whether it is better\nif a more deserving person gets exactly what he deserves than if a\nless deserving person does. Maybe this is better; but maybe, on the\nother hand, a situation in which someone who deserves a high welfare\nlevel gets exactly what he deserves is just as good as a situation in\nwhich someone who deserves a low (but still positive) welfare gets\nexactly what he deserves (2012, section 4.3). However, on one natural\nunderstanding of the perspective of desert, there is not much room for\ndebate here. It is natural to think that \u2018from the perspective\nof desert,\u2026\u2019 just means \u2018taking into account only\nhow close people are to getting what they deserve,\u2026\u2019 If\nthis is right then it is obvious that a situation in which someone who\ndeserves a welfare level of 50 and gets a welfare level of 50 is just\nas good, from the perspective of desert, as a situation in which\nsomeone who deserves a welfare level of 200 gets a welfare level of\n200. (One who held this view can, of course, say that in another sense\nthe second situation is better: it is better all-things-considered,\nbecause the total amount of welfare in that situation is higher.) The\nfact that Kagan does not think it obvious that the two situations are\nequally good from the perspective of desert is evidence that he\nrejects this account of what the perspective of desert is. (For more\non this question about Kagan\u2019s theory, see Appendix I of Feldman\n2003, and Skow 2014.) \n5. Desertist Theories of Justice\n\nThere is a long tradition according to which justice is fundamentally\na matter of receipt in accord with desert. There are passages in the\nwritings of Aristotle, Leibniz, Mill, Sidgwick, Ross and others in\nwhich this idea seems to be\n present.[4]\n The abstract desertist idea can be combined with different views\nabout what people deserve and the bases upon which they deserve these\nthings; for each combination of these views about deserts and desert\nbases, there is a different version of the desertist theory of\njustice. One of the broadest of these may be called \u201cUniversal\nDesertism about Justice.\u201d It is the idea that justice obtains\nwhen people receive everything they deserve on any basis. Although\nMill did not accept this conception of justice, he claimed that\nsomething quite like it is very widely accepted by \u201cthe general\nmind.\u201d Mill said: \n\nIt is universally considered just that each person should obtain that\n(whether good or evil) which he deserves; and unjust that he\nshould obtain a good, or be made to undergo an evil, which he does not\ndeserve. This is, perhaps, the clearest and most emphatic form in\nwhich the idea of justice is conceived by the general mind\n(Utilitarianism, ch 5, para\n 7).[5]\n\n\nWhen combined with natural and popular assumptions about what people\ndeserve, Universal Desertism gives an account of a form of justice\nthat probably would not be of much interest to social and political\nphilosophers. For given these assumptions about what people deserve,\nthe view implies that in order for there to be perfect justice in a\nsociety, every student would have to get every grade that he or she\ndeserves, and every athlete would have to win every competition that\nhe or she deserves to win, every neighbor would have to receive every\napology and thank-you note that he or she deserves, and everyone would\nhave to receive the amount of respect, and admiration, and love, and\ncontempt, and good luck that he or she deserves. The society would be\na veritable wonderland of requited desert in which no one would have\nany grounds for complaint about being short-changed about anything.\nSurely, however, when political philosophers are drawn to the idea\nthat justice is a matter of receipt in accord with desert, they do not\nhave anything quite so fantastic in mind. \n\nLeibniz maintained a desertist theory of justice that makes use of\nconsiderably restricted views about the relevant desert and desert\nbases. He described what he called \u2018the law of justice\u2019 in\nthese words: \n\n\u2026 everyone is to participate in the perfection of the universe,\nand to have personal happiness, in proportion to his own virtue and to\nthe extent that his will has contributed to the common good. (Leibniz\n1697)\n\n\nLeibniz evidently was imagining a view according to which there is\nonly one main currency of justice (\u2018happiness and participation\nin the perfection of the universe\u2019), and only one main desert\nbase (\u2018virtue and the extent to which his will has contributed\nto the common good\u2019) whose magnitude determines the amount of\nthe desert he deserves. Leibniz suggested that it falls to God to\nensure that people receive these deserts in the afterlife. \n\nWe can say that \u201cDivine Moral Desertism\u201d is the view that\njustice obtains when everyone receives from God in the afterlife\nprecisely the level of happiness or unhappiness that he or she\ndeserves on the basis of his or her level of moral virtue or vice\nduring life.\n\nClearly it is possible for there to be a situation in which the level\nof justice as measured by Universal Desertism is very low, but the\nlevel of justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism is very high.\nThis would happen if people rarely received the prizes and awards and\nincome and other things that they deserve here on earth, but if in\naddition they always received their heavenly rewards from God in the\nafterlife. \n\nIt is also possible for there to be a situation in which the level of\njustice as measured by Universal Desertism is very high, but the level\nof justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism is very low. This\nwould happen if people often received the apologies, thank-you notes,\nwages, grades, honorific jobs, etc. that they deserve on earth, but if\nin addition they never received any heavenly or infernal rewards in an\nafterlife for the virtue or vice that they manifested while they\nlived. \n\nWhile Divine Moral Desertism might be of interest to some theologians\nor philosophers of religion, it is doubtful that any social or\npolitical philosopher would have any professional interest in it.\nSocial and political philosophers are more interested in\nearthly justice \u2013 the kind of justice that obtains in\nvirtue of things that governments are called upon to do for their\ncitizens here on earth. But Divine Moral Desertism concerns things\nthat God does; and benefits or burdens to be received in the\nafterlife, rather than on earth. \n\nA historically important form of desertism emerges if we continue to\nmaintain that the relevant desert bases are all manifestations of\nmoral virtue and vice, but we introduce different assumptions about\ndeserts and distributors. Instead of saying (with Leibniz) that the\nrelevant deserts are levels of happiness and unhappiness to be\nexperienced in heaven or hell, we can say that the relevant deserts\nare levels of happiness and unhappiness to be experienced here on\nearth, during our lives. Furthermore, instead of saying that the\ndistributor from whom we deserve to receive these rewards is God, we\ncan say that we deserve them from our country. The result is a form of\ndesertism according to which there is perfect justice in a country if\nand only if in every case in which a citizen of that country deserves\nto be at a certain level of happiness or unhappiness in virtue of\nhaving lived at a certain level of moral virtue or vice, the\ngovernment of his or her country sees to it that the person comes to\nbe at that level of happiness during his or her lifetime. We can call\nthis \u201cEarthly Moral Desertism about Justice.\u201d \n\nIt should be obvious that justice as measured by Earthly Moral\nDesertism is not equivalent to justice as measured by Divine Moral\nDesertism. \n\nIn several passages in A Theory of Justice John Rawls attacks\nwhat he takes to be the desertist conception of justice. In these\npassages, Rawls seems to have in mind something quite like Earthly\nMoral Desertism. He mentions what he takes to be the motto of\ndesertism: \u2018justice is happiness according to virtue\u2019\n(1971, 310). Some of his objections to desertism turn on difficulties\nthat governments would face if they were to try to ensure a proper fit\nbetween citizens\u2019 levels of virtue and happiness. This indicates\nthat Rawls was imagining (and trying to refute) a form of desertism\nthat would saddle the government with the task of matching happiness\nlevels to virtue levels. \n\nA more plausible form of earthly desertism might attempt to assess\nstates or communities for the way in which economic items such as\nmoney, jobs, and taxes, and political items such as political rights\nand opportunities and obligations are distributed. The imagined form\nof desertism could purport to give an account of the circumstances\nunder which these things have been distributed justly even though it\nis silent on the distribution of other very important things such as\nhappiness, or victories in sporting events, or warm loving\nrelationships or apologies. \n\nInstead of focusing on all the things that anyone could deserve, or\nupon just one thing \u2013 happiness \u2013 such a theory could\nfocus on what we may call \u2018political economic deserts.\u2019\nThese might include such things as political rights and obligations,\nother benefits and burdens we get from our countries, security of\ncertain sorts, access to publicly owned or regulated infrastructure\nsuch as transportation systems, educational systems, judicial systems,\ncommunication systems, etc. \n\nInstead of focusing on all the desert bases in virtue of which anyone\ncould deserve anything, or simply upon the single desert base of moral\nvirtue, a theory of political economic justice could focus on what we\nmay call \u2018political economic desert bases.\u2019 These might\ninclude such things as being a citizen; having been unjustifiably\nharmed by a government agency; having earned a lot of money; being\nkeen on getting into business; being vulnerable to robbers and muggers\nwho might attack. The theory could thus focus on desert bases such\nthat it is the business of a government to take note of the fact that\nits citizens manifest these bases, and it is the business of that\ngovernment to try to see to it that its citizens receive the things\nthat they deserve on these bases. \n\nFurthermore, the imagined theory could focus on what we may call our\n\u2018political economic distributors.\u2019 In the typical case,\nthe political economic distributor for a certain person is the\ngovernment of that person\u2019s country, or suitable representatives\nof that government. The resulting theory, which we may dub\n\u2018Political Economic Desertism about Justice,\u2019 then could\nmaintain that there is perfect political economic distributive justice\nin a country if and only if in every case in which a citizen of that\ncountry deserves a political economic desert in virtue of having a\npolitical economic desert base, the government of his or her country\nensures that he or she receives that desert. \n\nIt should be clear that there might be perfect justice as measured by\nPolitical Economic Desertism in some country even though some citizens\nof that country fail to get some of the things they deserve. Maybe the\ncitizens are getting everything they deserve from their country, but\nsome fail to receive the apologies that they deserve from their\nspouses and children, and others fail to receive the good luck in\nsports or romance that they deserve. Indeed, there could be perfect\njustice as measured by Political Economic Desertism in every country\nin some possible world even though many residents of that world fail\nto receive lots of things that they deserve. \n\nIt should also be clear that there is no interesting connection\nbetween justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism and justice as\nmeasured by this Political Economic Desertism. We can easily imagine a\nsituation in which people receive all the political economic deserts\nthat they deserve from their governments, but never receive any of the\nheavenly rewards they deserve in the afterlife. \n\nSuppose the government in some country steadfastly keeps out of the\nbusiness of tracking the levels of virtue in its citizens. Suppose\nthis government also steadfastly keeps out of the business of worrying\nabout how happy its citizens are. But suppose in addition that the\ngovernment scrupulously distributes income tax refunds, in-state\ntuition waivers, voting rights, police protection, and other such\nthings to citizens who deserve to have them. Then the level of justice\nas measured by Earthly Moral Desertism in that country could be very\nlow, but the level of justice as measured by Political Economic\nDesertism would be very high. So these are clearly distinct concepts\nof justice. \n\nIn recent work, after explicating his concept of desert, T. M. Scanlon\npresents an extended argument designed to show \u201cnot just that\nthe particular conception of desert that [he has] examined \u2026\nplays no role in distributive justice. It is rather that initially\nplausible claims that individuals deserve certain economic benefits\nturn out, on closer examination, either to be invalid or to reduce to\nclaims of justice of some other identifiable sort\u201d (see Scanlon\n2013, 2018). Scanlon\u2019s claim seems to be that no fundamentally\ndesertist theory of distributive justice is correct. \n\nIn an effort to explicate the notion of desert that he has in mind,\nScanlon points out some principles concerning it that he means to\nendorse. First he distinguishes between desert and entitlement and\nreminds the reader that the mere fact that someone is entitled to a\ncertain form of treatment by the rules of some institution is not\nsufficient by itself to show that he or she deserves that treatment.\nThis would be evident in cases in which the entitlement-generating\ninstitution is itself seriously unjust. Next, Scanlon reminds the\nreader that the fact that some treatment would have good consequences\nis not, in itself, a basis for saying that the person deserves that\ntreatment. Scanlon also accepts the notion that there is a distinction\nbetween basic and derived desert. If a person deserves a form of\ntreatment, then this desert must be related to a more fundamental form\nof desert involving reactive attitudes. The deserved treatment must be\na standard way of expressing the deeper fact that the person deserves\nthe attitude. In general, Scanlon accepts the idea that if a person\ndeserves some treatment, the basis on which he or she deserves it must\ninvolve his or her own behavior or character. In virtue of the fact\nthat Scanlon endorses all these familiar doctrines about desert, it\nseems fair to say that his concept of desert is entirely within the\nmainstream.\n\nScanlon sketches several proposed desert bases by appeal to which a\ndesertist might attempt to explain why justice requires that citizens\nreceive economic benefits from their countries. These include (a)\nbeing morally meritorious, (b) having expended effort in productive\nlabor, (c) having made some other socially valuable contribution, and\n(d) being in possession of some special talent. In each case, Scanlon\nclaims either that the alleged factor is not a desert base at all, or\nelse that appeal to it cannot explain why certain people deserve\ngreater economic benefits from their countries. \n\nThe central problem that Scanlon emphasizes is that, as he sees it,\ndesertist theories of justice cannot explain how it can be just for\ndifferent citizens to receive different-sized benefits from their\ncountries. In this context, he hints at a two-level view according to\nwhich citizens may be entitled to different-sized benefits by the\nrules and regulations of some distributive institution that has been\nestablished in their country. Scanlon seems to acknowledge that if the\ninstitution itself is just, the citizens will deserve the\ndifferent-sized benefits to which they are entitled. But he emphasizes\nthat this desert of differential benefits will arise only if the\ninstitution that authorizes them is itself somehow justified. Scanlon\nsuggests that such institutions may be justified, and so the scheme as\na whole may be on the right track, but he seems to claim that the\njustification of the institution would then have to appeal to some\njustifying feature other than desert. And so, as he sees it, the\nscheme as a whole would not be a desertist theory of distributive\njustice.\n\nHowever, a defender of a desertist theory of political economic\ndistributive justice like the one sketched earlier might claim, in\nreply, that the distributional system itself might be justified in\nvirtue of the fact that citizens deserve to live in a country where\nsuch a system is in place. Perhaps it could be argued that citizens\ndeserve this because they need it in order to flourish as human\nbeings, and no individual human being is capable of establishing such\na distributional system on his or her own. If this is right, it would\napparently follow that the theory as a whole is a desertist theory of\ndistributive justice. It remains to be seen whether Scanlon\u2019s\nobjections to desertist theories of justice ultimately succeed, or\nwhether a desertist theory of the sort sketched may in the end prove\nto be acceptable.\n",
