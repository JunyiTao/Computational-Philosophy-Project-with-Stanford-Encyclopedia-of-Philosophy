    "main_text": "Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons\n6. Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons\n\nST has sparked a lively debate, which has been going on since the end\nof the 1980s. This debate has dealt with a great number of theoretical\nand empirical issues. On the theoretical side, we have seen\nphilosophical discussions of the relation between ST and functionalism\n(Gordon 1986; Goldman 1989; Heal 2003; Stich & Ravenscroft 1992),\nand of the role of tacit knowledge in cognitive explanations (Davies\n1987; Heal 1994; Davies & Stone 2001), just to name a few.\nExamples of empirical debates are: how to account for mindreading\ndeficits in Autism Spectrum Disorders (Baron-Cohen 2000; Currie &\nRavenscroft 2002), or how to explain the evolution of mindreading\n(Carruthers 2009; Lurz 2011). It goes without saying that discussing\nall these bones of contention would require an entire book (most\nprobably, a series of books). In the last section of this\nentry, we confine ourselves to briefly introducing the reader to a\nsmall sample of the main open issues concerning ST.\n",
