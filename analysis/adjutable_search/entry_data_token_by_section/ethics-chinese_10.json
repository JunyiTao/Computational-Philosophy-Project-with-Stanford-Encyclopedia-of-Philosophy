Confucians accept\nthat there are plural sources of moral duty, and that conflicts\nbetween the reasons provided by these sources must be dealt with\nthrough the discretion and weighing of judgment. While Mohists appear\nto put forward a monistic source of duty\u2014promoting benefits and\navoiding harms, a plausible reading of the Mozi has it including\nplural sources of benefit, e.g., food and filiality. They may also\nhave to resort to discretion and weighing of judgment when there are\nconflicts between plural goods. Mohists might attach more weight to\nthe value of doing good for the most people when it comes into\nconflict with loyalty to kin, but there is no explicit position on\nthis question in the Mozi.\n\nThere are certainly differences between the two ethics on the value of\nritual and musical performance. Of course, many Confucians might be\nunhappy with the Mohist portrayal of their tradition as insisting on\nextravagantly expensive performances. But the difference over the\nvalue of ritual and music has even deeper roots than the issue of how\nmuch of a society\u2019s material resources should be expended to\nstage them. Confucians tend to view the moral life as not only service\nto others but as fulfilling one\u2019s own humanity. This feature of\nConfucian ethics, which it shares with classical Greek virtue ethics,\ndistances it from Mohism.\n\nFurthermore, as pointed out earlier, the Confucian conception of a\nhumanly fulfilling way of life has aesthetic and emotionally\nexpressive dimensions that set it further apart from Mohism. The focus\non ritual and music exemplifies a deep concern for graceful and\nskillful enactments of concern and respect for others. To express\nthese attitudes in a fitting and beautiful way is intrinsically\nvaluable. The practice of ritual and music is also conceived as\ncrucial for cultivation of one\u2019s desires and emotional\ndispositions. For Confucius and Xunzi, such practice constituted\ntraining of one\u2019s desires and emotional dispositions, ways of\nrestraining a stubborn and undue concern for the self. While Mencius\ndoes not emphasize such a function for the practice of ritual and\nmusic, he does conceive of moral cultivation as nurturing the inborn\nemotional sensibilities that find fulfillment in relationship to\nothers. He recognizes the danger of overfeeding the small part of the\nself that takes pleasure in eating and drinking. This need to shape\nand train the self stands in contrast with the aforementioned Mohist\nassumption that the main cause of social conflict is the variety of\ndifferent conceptions of what is right that individuals tend to have.\nThere is no indication in this Mohist diagnosis that there is any\nspecial difficulty in getting oneself or others to try to do what one\nthinks is right.\n",
