    "main_text": "Theory Fictions: Baudrillard in the Contemporary Moment\n6. Concluding Assessment\n\n\nBaudrillard has never been as influential in France as in the\nEnglish-speaking world and elsewhere \u2013 a point made in many\nFrench obituaries upon his death. He is an example of the\n\u201cglobal popular,\u201d a thinker who has\nfollowers and readers throughout the world, though, so far, no\nBaudrillardian school has\n emerged.[20]\nBaudrillard\u2019s influence has been largely at\nthe margins of a diverse number of disciplines ranging from social\ntheory to philosophy to art history, thus it is difficult to gauge his\nimpact on philosophy or the mainstream of any specific academic\ndiscipline.\n\n\nBaudrillard is perhaps most important as part of the postmodern turn\nagainst modern society and its academic disciplines. His work cuts\nacross the disciplines and promotes cross-disciplinary thought. He\nchallenges standard wisdom and puts in question received dogma and\nmethods. While his early work on the consumer society, the political\neconomy of the sign, simulation and simulacra, and the implosion of\nphenomena previously separated can be deployed within critical\nphilosophy and social theory, much of his post-1980s work quite\nself-consciously goes beyond the classical tradition and in most\ninterviews of the past decade Baudrillard distances himself from\ncritical philosophy and social theory, claiming that the energy of\ncritique has dissipated.\n\n\nBaudrillard thus emerges in retrospect as a transdisciplinary\ntheorist of the end of modernity who produces sign-posts to the new era\nof postmodernity and is an important, albeit hardly trustworthy, guide\nto the new era. One can read Baudrillard\u2019s post-1970s work as\nscience fiction that anticipates the future by exaggerating present\ntendencies, and thus provides early warnings about what might happen if\npresent trends continue (Kellner 1995). It is not an accident that\nBaudrillard is an aficionado of science fiction, who has himself\ninfluenced a large number of contemporary science fiction writers and\nfilmmakers of the contemporary era, including The Matrix\n(1999) where his work is\n cited.[21]\n\n\nHowever, in view of his exaggeration of the alleged break with\nmodernity, it is ambiguous whether Baudrillard\u2019s last two decades\nof work is best read as science fiction or theory. He obviously wants\nto have it both ways with social theorists thinking that he provides\nsalient perspectives on contemporary social realities, that Baudrillard\nreveals what is really happening, that he tells it like it is. And yet\nmore cynical anti-sociologists are encouraged to enjoy\nBaudrillard\u2019s fictions, his experimental discourse, his games,\nand play. Likewise, he sometimes encourages cultural metaphysicians to\nread his work as serious reflections on the realities of our time,\nwhile winking a pataphysical aside at those skeptical of such\nundertakings. And Baudrillard\u2019s philosophical writings provoke\nphilosophers to defend their positions against his and to rethink\ncertain traditional questions in the light of contemporary\nrealities.\n\n\nThus, it is difficult to decide whether Baudrillard is best read as\nscience fiction and pataphysics, or as philosophy, social theory, and\ncultural metaphysics, and whether his post-1970s work should be read\nunder the sign of truth or fiction. In retrospect, Baudrillard\u2019s\nearly critical explorations of the system of objects and consumer\nsociety contain some of his most important contributions to\ncontemporary social theory. His mid-1970s analysis of a dramatic\nmutation occurring within contemporary societies and rise of a new mode\nof simulation, which sketched out the effects of media and information\non society as a whole, is also original and important. But at this\nstage of his work, Baudrillard falls prey to a technological\ndeterminism and semiological idealism which posits an autonomous\ntechnology and play of signs generating a society of simulation which\ncreates a postmodern break and the proliferation of signs, spectacles,\nand simulacra. Baudrillard erases autonomous and differentiated spheres\nof the economy, polity, society, and culture posited by classical\nsocial theory in favor of an implosive theory that also crosses\ndisciplinary boundaries, thus mixing philosophy and social theory into\na broader form of social diagnosis and philosophical play.\n\n\nIn the final analysis, Baudrillard is perhaps more useful as a\nprovocateur who challenges and puts in question the tradition of\nclassical philosophy and social theory than as someone who provides\nconcepts and methods that can be applied in philosophical, social or\ncultural analysis. He claims that the object of classical social theory\n\u2014 modernity \u2014 has been surpassed by a new postmodernity and\nthat therefore alternative theoretical strategies, modes of writing,\nand forms of theory are necessary. While his work on simulation and the\npostmodern break from the mid-1970s into the 1980s provides a\nparadigmatic postmodern theory and analysis of postmodernity that has\nbeen highly influential, and that despite its exaggerations continues\nto be of use in interpreting present social trends, his later work is\narguably of more literary interest. Baudrillard thus ultimately goes\nbeyond philosophy and classical social theory altogether into a new\nsphere and mode of writing that provides occasional biting critical\ninsights into contemporary social phenomena and provocative critiques\nof contemporary and classical philosophy and social theory. He now\nappears, in retrospect, as a completely idiosyncratic thinker who went\nhis own way and developed his own mode of writing and thought that will\ncontinue to provoke contemporary and future students of philosophy and\ncritical theory.\n",
