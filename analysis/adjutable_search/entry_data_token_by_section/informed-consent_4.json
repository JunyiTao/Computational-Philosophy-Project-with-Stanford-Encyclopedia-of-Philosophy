    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Preventing abusive conduct\n2.3 Preventing abusive conduct\n\nAn alternate rationale defends informed consent requirements as a\nbulwark against such deontological offenses as assault, deceit,\ncoercion, and exploitation (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 75f.), or\nfraud (Millum and Bromwich 2013). From this viewpoint, informed\nconsent requirements are instrumental against certain abusive acts,\nnot (only) against setbacks to health and welfare.\n\nThe abuse-prevention rationale may be unable to account for the full\nextent of clinicians\u2019 informed consent duties. We have already\nmentioned that physicians should make some effort to explain\ninformation again if they discover that their patients misunderstand\ncrucial risks. Intuitively, this is so even if the patient was given\nan excellent explanation, one that worked with similar patients and\nwhich would rule out reasonable suspicion of deceit, exploitation, or\nfraud, their patients misunderstand crucial risks should make some\neffort to explain again. Given that abuse has already been ruled out,\nthe abuse-prevention rationale fails to account for this duty\n(Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 118; compare Manson and O\u2019Neill\n2007, 82\u20133). That said, the abuse-prevention rationale in no way\nrules out an account of that duty based on complementary rationales\nfor informed consent (Millum and Bromwich 2013, 218).\n\nAnother challenge for the abuse-prevention rationale is that it is\ndifficult to ground in the deontological morality that has been\ninvoked to motivate it. Typically understood as\n agent relative\n and moment relative, deontological morality may be unable to provide\nstrong reasons for preventing future deontological offenses,\nespecially by others. A truly deontological abuse-prevention rationale\nwould therefore leave little room for strong reasons to enforce\ninformed consent requirements on others, yet some informed consent\nrights are surely legally enforceable by third parties later. It would\nalso hardly leave room for strong reasons against coercive medical\nintervention when third parties perform the coercion; for example,\nagainst extracting a live kidney from a consenting patient who\nconsents only due to her family\u2019s coercion, yet such reasons are\nwidely recognized. Any consequentialist variant on the\nabuse-prevention rationale would usually need to focus on all bad\nconsequences, not just on abusive conduct and its downstream\nconsequences, and serious harm to someone\u2019s health would often\ncount as a worse consequence than someone\u2019s having been\ndeceived. \n",
