Valuing life above all is the true spirit of humanism, and\nit must come before all other political ideals (Xu 1953 [2022: 157]).\nXu means a biological notion of life primarily, so caring for the\nphysical self takes priority over caring for the moral self. Xu\nfurther emphasizes that respecting life means respecting individual\npersons. The primary duty of government is providing for\npeople\u2019s material needs; education and pursuit of the good come\nafter that (Xu 1979 [1988]: 198), so a Confucian government can never\njustify harming individuals in the name of either their own good or\nthe good of society as a whole.\n\nXu claims Confucianism is democratic in spirit. Ideas of human dignity\nand equality that are foundational for liberal democracy were part of\nChinese culture, by which he means Confucian thought (Xu 1966 [2022:\n235]). Universal human nature implies a certain kind of equality, and\nas Mengzi emphasizes it is the moral potential which makes people\ndifferent from beasts, it is not a great leap to an idea of human\ndignity in virtue of this nature (Gao 2010). However, these ideals can\nbe the basis for democracy, but ideals are not enough. What is\nnecessary are objective institutions to guarantee the realization of\nthese ideals (Xu 1953 [2022: 149\u201350]). What required a sage\nruler in earlier Confucian political theory is routinized in\ndemocracy; the rulers respect the dignity of the people because they\nhave no choice. Virtue is objectified so it no longer relies on\ncaprice.\n\nXu considers rule by virtue and non-action the foundations of\ntraditional Confucian political thought and still apply in a Confucian\ndemocracy. For Xu, non-action means \u201cnot using one\u2019s\npersonal preferences to rule the people, and not using coercive means\nto rule the people\u201d (Xu 1966 [2022: 237]). Instead, virtue\noperates through rituals (Xu 1951 [2022: 72]). In his analysis, the\nsage rulers of the past reflected and implemented the people\u2019s\npreferences; they did not impose their own ideas (Xu 1953 [2022:\n143\u201344]). But getting rid of one\u2019s own preferences is very\ndifficult to do, and the value of democracy is putting structural\nlimits on governors\u2019 ability to rule according to their desires.\nWhere traditional Confucian politics depended on the ruler being\nwilling to set aside his own preferences, democracy removes the\nsubjective element: the governors must follow the people\u2019s\npreferences whether they want to or not. By removing the uncertainty\nof relying on individual virtue, democracy is actually the full\nrealization of the ideal of rule by virtue (Xie 2008: 183\u201385).\nThis is why Xu believes democracy is the natural path for Confucianism\nto take.\n\nWhere Xu is most Confucian is that he does not see law as sufficient\nfor good government. Law is necessary, but so is virtue and providing\na moral basis for government (Xu 1959 [2022: 229\u201330]). Xu\nbelieves the problem with Western democracy is it just treats people\nas physical beings acting to satisfy desires (what he sometimes\ncriticizes as the utilitarian view) (Xu 1980a: 241; 2022: 96). Western\npolitics is inadequate because it ignores the moral self, assuming\npeople are merely self-interested. The common interest is just a\nresult of individual interests limiting and controlling each other; it\nis not based on awareness of shared morality and respect for human\ndignity. What needs to be added is the concept of people as moral\nbeings, the virtue dimension (Xu 1951 [2022: 73\u201374]). Xu makes a\nmoral argument for democracy: it allows better realization of the\npotential of human nature than all other systems. His faith in human\nnature manifests in trusting people to allow them to develop their own\nmoral selves.\n",
