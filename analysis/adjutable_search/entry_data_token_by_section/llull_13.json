    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || The Sixth Sense\n4.1 The Sixth Sense\n\nLlull explains how the senses function perceptually and cognitively\nbased on the theory of the correlatives. Each one of the five\ntraditional senses has its three correlatives. Following the example\nproposed by Romano and de la Cruz (2008: 380), the eye functions\nintrinsically according to \u201cVisituus\u201d,\n\u201cVisibilis\u201d, and \u201cVidere\u201d,\nwhereas \u201cVisibilitas\u201d is found in objects, that\nis, its visible species. Since the act of seeing is similar to the act\nof being seen, they are connected in such a way that the extrinsically\nvisible species can be perceived and transformed in the intrinsically\nvisible species through the activity of the mind, by the imagination,\nwhich is the faculty that completes the process of abstraction.\n\nLlull presents an original contribution he designates as\nAffatus, which operates in the same way as the five\ntraditional senses. The Affatus is defined as the\npotentiality by which an animal manifests its conceptions through its\nvoice to another animal. This is the means, as he writes in the\nLibre dels proverbis de Ramon CCLXII, through which man\ncommunicates with the rational soul more than with any other sense, by\nwhich the soul produces sound, and, in the case of man, communicates\nscience. It is the image of understanding, it allows communication\nwith God, and it is how the mechanical arts are expressed.\n\nAll the senses have the same purpose as the affatus: to\nrealize the activity of man, the homificans, through the\nconnection of the internal and external species in order to enable man\nto know, remember, love, and live. Consequently, the senses are\nnecessary for living, but particularly the lowest kind, such as touch,\ntaste, and smell, are especially important for distinguishing pleasure\nfrom pain. The superior senses, such as hearing, sight, and\naffatus, not only allow man to live, but they also activate\nhis highest faculties and they bring man closer to God. Hearing is\nnecessary to know and remember, especially God\u2019s name; sight, to\nunderstand, remember, and love, particularly God; and\naffatus, to communicate knowledge and to talk to God.\n",
