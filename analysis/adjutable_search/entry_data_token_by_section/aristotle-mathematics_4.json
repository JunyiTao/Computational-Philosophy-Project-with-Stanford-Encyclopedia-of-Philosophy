The Relation Between Different Sciences: Autonomy and Subalternation\n\n\nA science is defined by the genus or kind it studies and by a group of\nspecifiable properties which belong to that kind. Secondly, the\nproperties studied within a science are defined in terms of the genus\nof the science (per se2). Hence, it follows that it will\ncommonly be impossible to prove one thing using a different science.\nFor one would have to prove that a property within one genus applies to\na completely different genus. Hence, every science is\nautonomous. Aristotle makes this claim, however, in\nthe context of his rejection of Plato's view that sciences are\nsubordinate to knowledge of the Good. What he actually claims is much more\nmodest. If one genus comes under another genus, it will be possible, in\nsome cases incumbent, to prove that a property belongs to a genus by\nusing a theorem from another science. In such a case the one science is\nsaid to be under (subalternate with) the other\nscience. \n\n\nHere are the sciences along with their relations which Aristotle\nmentions in the Analytics:\n\n\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\n\nStereometry (solid geometry)\n\n\nArithmetic\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\nOptics\n\n(mathematical)\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n(mathematical)\n\n\nMechanics\n\n\nHarmonics\n\n(mathematical)\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerning the Rainbow\n\n\nNautical Astronomy,\n\nPhenomena,\n\nEmpirical\n\n\n\nAcoustical Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle treats the science at the lowest level, descriptions of\nthe rainbow, astronomical phenomena, and acoustical harmonics, as\ndescriptive, providing the fact that something is the case, but not the\nexplanation, which is provided by the higher science. It is very easy\nto speculate how Aristotle would fill in the relations in the table;\ne.g., would he put stereometry below geometry, as Plato does in\nRep. vii? Similarly, the explanatory relation between\nmathematical optics and geometry is not the same as the relation of\noptics to empirical optics. This example of the rainbow seems to refer\nto the argument in Meteorology iii.5, where the observed fact\nthat rainbows are never more than a semicircle (true in flat lands) is\nexplained by a proof in optics that is thoroughly geometrical in\ncharacter. Once the basic set-up and principle of reflection is\nprovided, the rest is geometrical.\n\n\nA different situation obtains when one science is not under another\nscience, but some of the properties come from the other science.\nAristotle's example is the fact that that round wounds heal more slowly\n[than slashes]. The medical property depends on the area of the wound\nand its perimeter.\n\n\nAristotle's point about autonomy is that a theorem in arithmetic\n(even less a theorem in harmonics) cannot be used to prove something in\ngeometry. Here, arithmetic is probably understood as the number theory\nfound in Euclid, Elements vii-ix, and not mere calculation of\nnumbers, which, of course, is used in geometry. This allows the\nanti-Platonic point that theorems about the beautiful and theorems in\nmathematics have nothing to do with one another, even if some theorems\nare beautiful.\n\n\nElsewhere (esp. Physics ii.2 and Metaphysics\nxiii.3), Aristotle provides different accounts of the relations between\nmathematical sciences.\n6. What Mathematical Sciences Study: Puzzles\n\n\nAristotle's principal concern in discussing ontological issues in\nmathematics is to avoid various versions of platonism. Aristotle\nshares with Plato the view that there are objects of understanding,\nthat these must be universal and not particular and that they have to\nsatisfy certain \u201cParmenidean\u201d conditions, such as being\nunchanging and eternal. However, Aristotle rejects the view of Plato\nthat objects of understanding are separate from particulars. This is a\ngeneral problem in Aristotle's metaphysics. However, in the case of\nmathematical objects, there are three important difficulties. First,\nif physical objects are the objects of mathematical understanding and\nsatisfy the standard definitions of line, circle, etc., then it is\narguable that they manifestly fail in two ways (cf. Met. iii\n2 997b25-8a19): \n\nThe physical straight lines we draw are not straight; a physical\ntangent line does not really touch a circle at a point. In other words,\nphysical objects fail to have the mathematical properties we study.\nThis is the problem of precision.\nPhysical mathematical objects lack properties which we require of\nobjects of understanding. They are not separate or independent of\nmatter. Hence, they are not eternal or unchanging. This is the problem\nof separability.\n\n\n\nAlthough these two problems are distinct, Aristotle may hold that\nthis failure is at least partly responsible for the failure of\nmathematical objects to have the mathematical properties we study.\nPlatonic Forms fail in a third way.\n\nSuppose that there is a Form for each kind of triangle. There still\nwould be only one Form for each kind. A mathematical theorem about\ndiagonals of rectangles might mention two equal and similar triangles\nwhich are, nonetheless, distinct. Mathematical sciences require many\nobjects of the same sort. This is the problem of\nplurality (cf. Met. iii 2 and Met.\niii.1-2).\n\n\n\nA fourth problem is not explicitly stated by Aristotle, but is\nclearly a presupposition of his discussion.\n\nAn account of mathematics should not impinge on mathematical\npractice so as to make it incoherent or impossible. If mathematicians\ntalk about triangles, numbers, etc., the account of mathematical\nobjects should at least explain the discourse. This is the problem of\nnon-revisionism (sometimes also called\nnaturalism).  So Aristotle says (Met. xiii.3\n1077b31-33) of his own account of mathematics that \u201cit is\nunqualifiedly true to say of the mathematicals that thay exist and are\nsuch as they <the mathematicians say>\u201d\n(cf. Phys. iii.7 207b27-34 for an application of the\nprinciple).\n\n\n\nTo solve the problems of separation and precision, contemporary\nphilosophers such as Speusippus and possibly Plato posited a universe\nof mathematical entities which are perfect instances of mathematical\nproperties, adequately multiple for any theorem we wish to prove, and\nseparate from the physical or perceptible world. Aristotle calls them\nmathematicals or intermediates,\nbecause they are intermediate between the Forms and physical objects,\nin as much as they are perfect, eternal, and unchanging like the Forms,\nbut multiple like physical objects (cf., for example, Met. i.6\n987b14-18, iii 2, xiii.1-2). This solution is the ancestor of many\nversions of platonism in mathematics.\n\n\nAristotle's rejection of intermediates involves showing that their\nadvocates are committed to an unwieldy multiplicity of mathematical\nuniverses, at least one corresponding to each mathematical science,\nwhether kinematics, astronomy, or geometry. However, he also sets out\nto show that such ontologies are not merely pleonastic, but also that\nan alternative account can be given free of all the difficulties\nmentioned. In other words, Aristotle's strategy is best seen as\ndiffusing some versions of platonism.\n\n\nAristotle also rejects a compromise as merely compounding this\ndifficulty, the view that either Forms or intermediates are immanent in\nthings (separate but coextensive), since these different worlds will\nnow have to exist bundled together.\n7. Aristotle's Treatment of Mathematical Objects\n\n\nThe account here of Aristotle on the status of mathematical objects\nwill center on five concepts, which Aristotle uses in his discussions:\n\u2018abstraction\u2019 or \u2018taking away\u2019 or\n\u2018removal\u2019 or \u2018subtraction\u2019\n(aphairesis), \u2018precision\u2019\n(akribeia), \u2018as separated\u2019\n(h\u00f4s kekh\u00f4rismenon),\n\u2018qua\u2019 or \u2018in the respect that\u2019\n(h\u00eai), and \u2018intelligible\nmatter\u2019 (no\u00eatik\u00ea hyl\u00ea).\nPrincipal sources are the Posterior Analytics, De\nAnima iii.6-8, Metaphysics iii.2, vi.1, vii.10-11, ix.9,\nx.1-2, xi.2-3, 7, xiii.1-3, Physics ii.2. \n7.1 Objects From Abstraction or \u2018Removal\u2019 (ta ex aphairese\u00f4s)\n\n\nAristotle occasionally refers to mathematical objects as things by,\nin, from, or through removal (in different works Aristotle uses\ndifferent expressions: ta aphairesei, ta en\naphairesei, ta ex aphairese\u00f4s, ta di\u2019\naphairese\u00f4s). It is also clear that this usage relates to\nlogical discussions in the Topics of definitions where one can\nspeak of adding a term or deleting a term from an expression and seeing\nwhat one gets as a result. Our principal task is to explain what this\nlogical/psychological removal is and how it solves the four puzzles.\nAristotle starts with the class of perceptible or physical\nmagnitudes. The examination of these is a part of physics (cf.\nPhysics iii.4). The ontological status of these does not\nconcern him, but we may suppose that they consitute the category of\nquantities: the bodies, surfaces, edges, corners, places, and times,\nsounds, etc. of physical substances (Categories 6).\n\n\nIn the Analytics, where the notion of matter is absent,\nAristotle begins with a particular geometrical perceptible figure. What\nis removed is its particularity and all that comes with this, including\nits being perceptible. What is left then is a universal of some sort.\nAristotle also does not seem to think in this work that there is any\nconflict between the plurality problem and thinking of all terms in a\nmathematical deduction as universals. However, since he allows that a\nterm can be a very complex expression, it can designate a rich complex\nfor which there would probably be no corresponding Form in a Platonic\ntheory.\n\n\nElsewhere, Aristotle usually seems to mean that the attributes not a\npart of the science are removed. What is left may be particular, a\nquasi-fictional entity. It is the status of this entity which leads to\nmuch controversy. Is it a representation in the soul or is it the\nperceptible object treated in a special way? Ancient and medieval\nreaders tended to take the former approach in their interpretation of\nAristotle, that the object left is a stripped down representation with\nonly the required properties. (Cf. Mueller (1990) and neo-Platonic\nfoundations for these interpretations of mathematics, such as Proclus\nin his commentary on Euclid.)\n\n\nMost modern readers, perhaps influenced by the critiques of Berkeley\nand Hume against the first position and certainly less committed to\nneo-Platonism, take the second approach. The objects studied by\nmathematical sciences are perceptible objects treated in a special\nway, as a perceived representation, whether as a diagram in the sand\nor an image in the imagination. Furthermore, perhaps as a response to\nFrege's devastating critique of psychologism and Husserl's first\nattempt at a psychological account of arithmetic, some have suggested\nthat Aristotle has no need for a special faculty of\nabstracting. Rather the mind is able to consider the perceived object\nwithout some of its properties, such as being perceived, being made of\nsand, marble, bronze, etc. However, this is analogous to the logical\nmanipulation of definitions, by considering terms with or without\ncertain additions. Hence, Aristotle will sometimes call the material\nobject, the mathematical object by adding on. As a convenience, the\nmind conceives of this as if the object were just that. On this view,\nabstraction is no more and no less psychological than inference.\n\n\nConceptually, we might think of the process as the mind rearranging\nthe ontological structure of the object. As a substantial artifact,\nwhat-it-is, the sand box has certain properties essentially. The figure\ndrawn may be incidental to what-it-is, i.e., an accident. In treating\nthe object as the figure drawn, being made of sand is incidental to it.\nHence, \u2018things by removal\u2019 may be one way of explaining\nperceptible magnitudes qua lengths. This is the concept which\ndoes most of the work for Aristotle.\n7.2 Precision (akribeia)\n\n\nIn his discussions of precision, Aristotle states that those\nsciences which have more properties removed are more precise.\nArithemetic, about units, is more precise than geometry, since a point\nis a unit having position. A science of kinematics (geometry of moving\nmagnitudes) where all motion is uniform motions is more precise than a\nscience that includes non-uniform motions in addition, and a science of\nnon-moving magnitudes (geometry) is more precise than one with moving\nmagnitudes. However, one might infer that \u2018precision\u2019 here\nmeans nothing more than \u2018clarity\u2019 (or perhaps\n\u2018refinement\u2019, with all its ambiguity). Does this concept of\n\u2018precision\u2019 provide a framework for solving the problem of\nprecision?\n7.3 As Separated (h\u00f4s kekh\u00f4rismenon)\n\n\nAristotle solves the separability problem with a kind of\nfictionalism. The language and practice of mathematicians is legitimate\nbecause we are able to conceive of perceptible magnitudes in ways that\nthey are not. The only basic realities for Aristotle remain substances,\nhowever we are to conceive them. A primary characteristic of substances\nis that they are separate. Yet we are able to speak of a triangle, a\nfinite surface, merely the limit of a body, and hence not separate, as\nif it were separate (h\u00f4s kekh\u00f4rismenon). It is a\nsubject in our science (in our discourse in the science). The mental\nand logical mechanism by which we accomplish this is the core of\nAristotle's strategy in diffusing platonisms.\n7.4 X Qua (h\u00eai) Y\n\n\nThe word Aristotle uses is commonly translated with the English word\n\u2018qua\u2019 which itself translates the Latin relative\npronoun \u2018qua\u2019, but with one important grammatical\ndifference. The English adverb is normally followed by a noun\nphrase.\n\n\nAs a relative adverbial pronoun in the dative case, the Greek word\ncaptures all possible meanings of the dative, including,\n\u2018where\u2019, \u2018in the manner that\u2019,\n\u2018by-means-of-the-fact-that\u2019, or\n\u2018in-the-respect-that\u2019. Some have suggested translating it\nwith the word \u2018because\u2019, although it is arguable that the\nEnglish word at best intersects with the appropriate Greek meaning\n(perhaps \u2018just or precisely because\u2019 works better. Hence,\n\u2018X qua Y\u2019 should be understood\nas elliptic for:\n\u2018X in the respect that X is\nY\u2019\n\n\nor \n\u2018X by means of the fact that X is\nY\u2019 (or \u2018X precisely because X is\nY\u2019).\n\n\nHere \u2018X\u2019 is normally a noun phrase referring to\nan entity in any ordinary way, e.g., arithmetic studies Leopold\nqua unit, this man qua unit, this musician\nqua unit.\n\n\nIn the context of a scientific claim, \u2018X\nby-means-of-the-fact-that or in-the-respect-that X is\nY is F\u2019 maintains that \u2018Y is\nF\u2019 is a theorem, where Y is the most universal\nor appropriate subject for F, and that X is\nF in virtue of the fact that X is Y. For\nexample, Figure ABC qua triangle has internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles, but qua right triangle has sides\nAB2 + BC2 = AB2.\n\n\n\nIn the case where we examine or study an object X\nqua Y or X in-the-respect-that X is\nY, we study the consequences that follow from something's\nbeing an Y. In other words, Y determines the logical\nspace of what we study. If X is a bronze triangle (a\nperceptible magnitude), to study X qua bronze will be\nto examine bronze and the properties that accrue to something that is\nbronze. To study X qua triangle is to study the\nproperties that accrue to a triangle. Unless it follows from\nsomething's being a triangle that it must be bronze, the property of\nbeing bronze will not appear in one's examination.\n\n\nNote that there is no necessity that \u2018qua\u2019\noperators be of the form \u2018qua Y\u2019, where\nY is a noun phrase. For example, Aristotle says (De\nanima iii.4.429b25-6) that two things affect and are affected\n\u201cqua something in common belongs to both.\u201d\nSimilarly, as evidence that \u2018qua\u2019 does not in\nthese contexts always mean \u2018because\u2019 (usually, the context\nis too ambiguous to precisely decide whether it means\n\u2018because\u2019 or \u2018in the respect that\u2019), consider\nNicomachean Ethics i.3.1102b8-9, \u201cSleep is an inactivity\nof the soul qua it is called good or bad,\u201d but certainly\nnot because it is.\n\n\nWith only one or two possible exceptions, it seems that whenever\nAristotle speaks of F(X) qua\nG(X), G(X) must be true. We can\nstudy a perceptible triangle qua triangle because it is a\ntriangle. For convenience, we can call this principle\nqua-realism.\n\nThe Account of Mathematical Objects with\n\u2018Qua\u2019. We begin with perceptible\nmagnitudes. These are volumes, surfaces, edges, and corners. They\nchange in position and size. They are made of some material and are the\nquantities of substances and their interactions. The volumes, surfaces,\nand edges have shape. Times and corners do not. Different sciences\ntreat different perceptible magnitudes qua different\nthings.\n\n\nMoreover, since there are many perceptible magnitudes, there will be\nenough, qua line, to prove any theorem that involves lines.\nThe plurality problem is trivially solved.\n\n\nThe separability problem is solved because if we examine X\nqua Y, we will talk about Y as if it is a\nseparate entity, as a subject, and will pay no attention to the way in\nwhich we captured Y through a description\n\u2018X\u2019, in the sense that only the residue of the\nqua-filter are studied. The science will speak of Y.\nThis too will not interfere with mathematical practice and so will not\nviolate non-revisionism.\n\n\nIn Metaphysics vi.1, Aristotle argues that physics concerns\nthings which have change, but are substances, that at least some of the\nthings that mathematics is about do not change and are eternal but are\nnot substances (exceptions would probably include stars and spheres in\nmathematical astronomy and bodies in mathematical kinematics), while\nfirst philosophy or theology is about things which are substances but\ndo not change and are eternal. We can now characterize the way in which\nmathematical objects are eternal and lack change. Namely, generation\nand change are not among the predicates studied by geometry or\narithmetic. Hence, it is correct to say that qua lines,\nperceptible lines lack generation, destruction, and change (with\nappropriate provisos for kinematics and mathematical astronomy).\n\n\nWhether the precision problem is also solved and how it is solved is\nmore controversial. On the ancient and medieval interpretation, the\nproblem of precision is solved by allowing mental representations to be\nas precise as one chooses. The contemporary interpretation of\nconsidering Aristotle's mathematical objects as physical object treated\nin a special way has a more difficult task. There are five ways in\nwhich Aristotle may attempt to solve the precision problem.\n\nMany scholars today seem to hold to a view that for Aristotle if\none can speak of X qua Y, then X\nmust be Y precisely. This means that any theorem about\ntriangles will only hold of the rare perfect triangles, wherever they\nmay be (a thesis once suggested by Descartes).\nTo increase the number of instances of exact triangles in the\nontology, some scholars turn to Met. xiii.3, where Aristotle\nnotes that being is said in two ways, the one in actuality and the\nother materially, he may be pointing to the fact that mathematical\nentities exist in continua as potentialities. Hence, a perfect line\nexists potentially in the sand, even if the one I have drawn is\nnot. (Some have also seen support for this in Met. ix.9.)\nHence, although there may be no actual triangles right now, at least\nthere are an infinity of potential ones. The difficulty is that the\nargument is not about precision. It concerns an objection to Aristotle\nthat man\nqua man is indivisible, but geometry studies man qua\ndivisible. Since man is not divisible, the principle of\nqua-realism, that if one can study X qua\nY then X is Y, is violated. Aristotle says\nthat man is in actuality indivisible (you cannot slice a man in two and\nstill have man or men), but is materially divisible. It is enough that\nX is Y materially or in actuality to study X\nqua Y. Nonetheless, the solution to the puzzle could\npoint to an Aristotelian solution to the problem of precision.\nAlternatively, it is arguable that Aristotle allows that\n\u2018X is Y\u2019 may be true only imprecisely.\nFor example, I may study a triangle in a diagram ABC\nqua triangle, but ABC is only a triangle imprecisely.\nMany Hellenistic treatises involving applied sciences set up convenient\nbut false premises for the purposes of mathematical manipulation,\nincluding, notably, Aristotle's own account of the rainbow (Meteorology\niii.5). Hence, an appeal to potentialities to get more exact triangles\nwill do nothing to eliminate these apparent violations of\nqua-realism.\nIn providing his hierarchy of precision in sciences, Aristotle may\nthink that from filtering out more properties one gets greater\nprecision. One finds more precise straight lines in geometry than in\nkinematics. Besides the obscurity of the position, it is not clear that\nhe intends any such thing (see Section 7.2 above).\nOne possibility is that Aristotle thinks that if a description has\nmore properties removed from consideration, the entity studied is more\nprecise in that there will be instances materially or actually that\nexactly exhibit satisfy qua-realism. For example, there are\nprecise instances of units or of corners or points so that arithmetic\nand geometry are precise, while astronomy might not be so precise,\nsince the planets are imprecisely points, but are studied qua\npoints.\n\n\n\nOur difficulty is that while Aristotle raises the problem of\nprecision, he does not explicitly explain his solution to it.\n7.5 Intelligible matter (no\u00eatik\u00ea hyl\u00ea)\n\n\nPerceptible magnitudes have perceptible matter. A bronze sphere is a\nperceptible magnitude. For solving the plurality problem, Aristotle\nneeds to have many triangles with the same form. Since perceptible\nmatter is not part of the object considered (in abstraction or\nremoval), he needs to have a notion of matter which is the matter of\nthe object: bronze sphere MINUS bronze (perceptible matter). Since this\nobject must be a composite individual to distinguish it from other\nindividuals with the same form, it will have matter. He calls such\nmatter intelligible or mathematical matter. Aristotle has at least four\ndifferent conceptions of intelligible matter in the middle books of the\nMetaphysics, Physics iv, and De anima i: \n\nThe form of a magnitude is its limit (Metaphysics v.17);\nhence, the matter is what is between the limits of the magnitude, its\nextension (Physics iv 2).\nMatter is the genus, e.g., in the sense that magnitude (and not\nperceptible-magnitude) is the kind for triangles (e.g.,\nMetaphysics v.28, viii.6).\nThe \u2018non-perceptible\u2019 matter of a perceptible\nmagnitude, which is in the perceptible matter (Metaphysics\nvii.10, cf. De anima i.1).\nThe parts of a mathematical object which do not occur in the\ndefinition of the object, e.g., acute angle is not in the definition of\nright angle, but is a part of it and so is a non-perceptible material\npart of the angle (Metaphysics vii.10, 11).\n\n\n\n(1) and (3) are compatible; (2) may be a separate notion having more\nto do with the unity of definition and seems incompatible with (4);\nAristotle treats (3) and (4) as the same notion. Since Aristotle's\nconcern in discussing (4) is with the nature of the parts of\ndefinitions and not with questions of extended matter, it is unclear\nwhether the non-definitional parts are potential extended parts or\nmerely forms of extended parts, although the former seems more\nplausible.\n8. Universal Mathematics\n\n\nAncillary to his discussions of being qua being and theology\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), Aristotle suggests an analogy with\nmathematics. If the analogy is that there is a super-science of\nmathematics coverying all continuous magnitudes and discrete\nquantities, such as numbers, then we should expect that Greek\nmathematicians conceived of a general mathematical subject as a\nprecursor of algebra, Descartes' mathesis universalis (universal\nlearning/mathematics), and mathematical logic. \n\n\nAristotle reports (Posterior Analytics. i.5, cf.\nMetaphysics xiii.2) that whereas mathematicians proved\ntheorems such as a : b = c : d\n=> a : c = b : d (alternando)\nseparately for number, lines, planes, and solids, now there is one\nsingle general or universal proof for all (see Section 3). The\ndiscovery of universal proofs is usually associated with Eudoxus'\ntheory of proportion. For Aristotle this creates a problem since a\nscience concerns a genus or kind, but also there seems to be no kind\ncomprising number and magnitude. Some scholars have proposed that a\nuniversal science of \u2018posology\u2019 (a science of quantity)\ntakes the whole category of quantity as its subject.\n\n\nAristotle seems more reticent, describing the proofs as concerning\nlines, etc., qua having such and such increment (An. Post.\nii.17). He seems to identify such a super-mathematics\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), but seems to imply that it does not\ntake a determinate kind as its subject. Another possibility is that the\ncommon science has theorems which apply by analogy to the different\nmathematical kinds.\n\n\nElsewhere (Metaphysics xi.4), where Aristotle builds an\nanalogy with the science of being qua being, he seems to suggest that\nuniversal proofs of quantities (here too including numbers) concern\ncontinuous quantity (unlike the similar passage in Metaphysics\niv.3). If so and if this is by Aristotle, it would correspond to the\ngeneral theory of proportions as it comes down to us. One may well\nwonder if scholars have been led astray by a hyperbole about universal\nproofs.\n\n\nIronically, extant Greek mathematics shows no traces of an\nAristotelian universal mathematics. The theory of ratio for magnitudes\nin Euclid, Elements v is completely separate from the\ntreatment of ratio for number in Elements vii and parts of\nviii, none of which appeals to v, even though almost all of the proofs\nof v could apply straightforwardly to numbers. For example, Euclid\nprovides separate definitions of proportion (v def. 5, and vii def.\n20). Compare the rule above (alternando),which is proved at v.16, while\nthe rule follows trivially for numbers from the commutivity of\nmultiplication and vii.19: ad = bc \u21d4 a\n: b = c : d.\n9. Place and continuity of Magnitudes\n\n\nIn Plato's Academy, some philosophers suggested that lines are composed\nof indivisible magnitude, whether a finite number (a line of\nindivisible lines) or a infinite number (a line of infinite points).\nAristotle builds a theory of continuity and infinite divisibility of\ngeometrical objects. Aristotle denies both conceptions. Yet, he needs\nto give an account of continuous magnitudes that is also free from\nparadoxes that these theories attempted to avoid. The elements of his\naccount may be found principally in Physics iv.1-5 and v.1 and\nvi. Aristotle's account pertains to perceptible magnitudes. However, it\nis clear that he understands this to apply to magnitudes in mathematics\nas well. \n\n\nAristotle has many objections to thinking of a line as composed of\nactual points (likewise, a plane of lines, etc.), including:\n\nNo point in a line is adjacent to another point.\nIf a line is composed of actual points, than to move a distance an\nobject would have to complete an infinite number of tasks (as suggested\nby Zeno's arguments against motion)\n\n\n\nTo say that a line is comprised of an infinity of potential points\nis no more than to say that a line may be divided (with a line-cutter,\nwith the mind, etc.) anywhere on it, that any potential point may be\nbrought to actuality. The continuity of a line consists in the fact\nthat any actualized point within the line will hold together the line\nsegments on each side. Otherwise, it makes no sense to speak of a\npotential point actually holding two potential lines together.\n\n\nSuppose I have a line AB and cut it at C. The\nlines AC and CB are distinct. Is C one point\nor two?\nC is one point in number.\n\nC is two points in its being or formula\n(logos).\n\n\nThis merely means that we can treat it once or twice or as many times\nas we choose. Note that Aristotle says the same thing about a\ncontinuous proportion. in a : b = b :\nc, b is one magnitude in being, but is used as two. \n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nPlace and continuity of Magnitudes\n10. Unit (monas) and Number (arithmos)\n10.1 Background\n\n\nGreek mathematicians tend to conceive of number (arithmos) as\na plurality of units. Perhaps a better translation, without our deeply\nentrenched notions, would be \u2018count\u2019. Their conception\ninvolves: \n\nA number is constructed out of some countable entity, unit\n(monas).\nNumbers are more like concatenations of units and are not sets. To\ndraw a contrast with modern treatments of numbers, a Greek pair or a\ntwo is neither a subset of a triple, nor a member of a triple. It is a\npart of three. If I say that ten cows are hungry, then I am not saying\nthat a set is hungry. Or to point to another use of \u2018set\u2019, my 12 piece\nteaset is in a cabinet, not in an abstract universe. So too, these ten\nunits are a part of these twenty units: \n\n\n\nOne (a unit) typically is not a number (but Aristotle is ambivalent\non this), since a number is a plurality of units.\nAt least in theoretical discussions of numbers, a fractional part\nis not a number.\nIn other words, numbers are members of the series: 2, 3, \u2026,\nwith 1 conceived as the \u2018beginning\u2019 (arch\u00ea)\nof number or as the least number.\nIn early Greek mathematics (5th century), numbers were represented\nby arrangements of pebbles. Later (at least by the 3rd century BCE)\nthey were represented by evenly divided lines.\n\n\n\nFor Aristotle and his contemporaries there are several fundamental\nproblems in understanding number and arithmetic:\n\nThe precision problem of mathematicals is similar in the case of\ngeometrical entities and units (see Section 6). Consider, for example,\nPlato's discussion of incompatible features of a finger as presenting\none or two things to sight. Aristotle deals with the problem in his\ndiscussion of measure (see Section 10.1).\nThe separability problem is the same as for geometry (see Section\n6).\nThe plurality problem of mathematicals (Section 6) is similar in\nthe case of geometrical entities and units, with some differences. To\ncount \u2018perceptible\u2019 units, or rather units from abstraction\n(cf. Section 7.1), one needs some principle of individuating units,\nwhat one is counting, whether cows or categories of predication.\nAristotle says that one can always find an appropriate classification\n(we may assume that some classifications would be fairly convoluted,\nbut that this is at best an aesthetic and not a logical problem). For\nunits, one will use the same principle that allows one to individuate\ntriangles. This is why Aristotle can describe a point as\nunit-having-position. Arithmetic involves the study of entities qua\nindivisible.\nThe unity problem of numbers: This problem\nbedevils philosophy of mathematics from Plato to Husserl. What makes a\ncollection of units a unity which we identify as a number? It cannot be\nphysical juxtaposition of units. Is it merely mental stipulation?\n\n\n\nAristotle does not seem bothered by:\n\nThe overlap problem: What guarantees that when I\nadd this 3 and this 5 that the correct result is not 5, 6, or 7, namely\nthat some units in this 3 are not also in this 5.\n\n\n\nAristotle presents three Academic solutions to these problems. Units\nare comparable if they can be counted together (such as the ten cows in\nthe field). Units are not comparable, if it is conceptually impossible\nto count them together (a less intuitive notion). \n\nIncomparable Units: Form numbers are conceived as\nordinals, with units conceived as being well ordered. What makes this\nnumber 3 is not that it is a concatenation of three units, but that its\nunit is the third unit in this series of units. Hence, it is simply\nfalse that there is a unity of the first three units forming a number\nthree. What makes an ordinary concatenation, e.g., a herd of cows, ten\ncows is that they can be counted according to the series of\nForm-numbers. The notion of incomparable numbers lacks the basic\nconception of numbers as concatenations of units.\nComparable/Incomparable Units: Form numbers are,\nof course, special. Each is a complete unity of units. For example, the\nForm of 3 is a unity of three units. Since it is a unity, it cannot be\nan accident that these three units form this unity. They are comparable\nwith each other in the sense that together they comprise Three Itself\nand perhaps cannot be conceived separately. Hence, they cannot be parts\nof any other Form number. We cannot take 2 units from the Three Itself\nand add them to 4 units in the Six itself, to get a Form-number of the\nSeven itself. Myles Burnyeat once suggested an analogy with a sequence\nof playing cards of one suit, say\n diamonds.[1]\n Each card from ace (unit) to ten contains the appropriate diamonds\n(from 1 to 10) on each card, unified by their being on their\nparticular card. Yet we don't count up two diamonds from the deuce and\ntwo from the trey, but treat each card as a complete unity.\nComparable Units: These are intermediate or\nmathematical numbers (see Section 6). There is a unlimited number of\nunits (enough to do arithmetic), which are arranged and so forth.\nComparable numbers solve the plurality problem, but not the unity\nproblem.\n\n\n\nAristotle reports that some Academics opted for a version of\nIncomparable or Comparable/Incomparable Units to solve the unity\nproblem and introduced comparable units as the objects of mathematical\ntheorems, e.g., given some comparable units, they are even if they can\nbe divided in half, into two concatenations corresponding to\n(participating in) the same Form-number.\n10.2 Measure (metron)\n10.2.1 Background\n\n\nGreeks used an Egyptian system of fractions. With the exception of 2/3,\nall fractions are proper parts which modern readers will see as unit\nfractions: 1/n. For example, 2/5 is 1/3 1/15 (that is, the sum of 1/3\nand 1/15). Additionally, Greeks used systems of measure, as we do, with\nunits of measure being divided up into more refined units of measure. 1\nfoot is 16 finger-widths (inches). Hence, one can always eliminate\nfractions by going, as we do, to a more refined measure (1, 1/2, 1/4\nfeet or 1 foot 12 inches). This feature of measure may be reflected in\nPlato's observation (Rep. vii) that in arithmetic, one can\nalways eliminate parts of units. \n10.2.2 Aristotle's views\n\n\nSince Aristotle (esp. Metaphysics x.1-2) treats measurement under his\ndiscussions of units (and hence number), it turns out that the\nprecision problem becomes a problem of sorting out precise units of\nmeasure. Hence, in the case discrete quantities, such as cows, the unit\nis very precise, one cow. In the case of continuous quantities, the\nmost precise unit of time is the time it takes for the fixed stars (the\nfastest things in the universe) to move the smallest perceptible\ndistance. But a point or indivisible with position removed or a cow qua\nunit, i.e., a mathematical unit, is precise. \n10.3 Time\n\n\nAristotle's treatment of time (Physics iv.10-14) includes some\nobservations about numbers which come closest to being an account of\nnumber. Aristotle defines time as the number or count of change and\nthen proceeds to distinguish two senses of number, what is counted\n(e.g., ten cows as measured by the cow-unit, or ten feet as measured by\nthe foot-unit) and that by which we count. Time is number in the first\nsense, not as so-many changes, but as so-much change as measured by a\nunit of change. Aristotle clarifies the distinction between what is\ncounted (or is countable) and that by which we count. These five black\ncats (number as what is counted) are different from these five brown\ncats, but their number (that by which we count) is the same. \n\n\n\nBut what are the numbers by which we count? Aristotle says nothing, but\nwe may speculate that the five by which we count is the single formal\nexplanation of what makes the five black cats five and what makes the\nfive brown cats five. Hence, Aristotle probably subscribes to an\nAristotelian version of the distinction between intermediate and\nForm-numbers. \n\n\nAristotle's discussion of time also gives us some insight into the\nunity problem. What gives the five black cats unity is just that they\ncan be treated as a unity. From this it follows for Aristotle that\nthere can be no number without mind. Nothing is countable unless there\nexists a counter.\n11. Mathematics and Hypothetical Necessity\n\n\nIt is often supposed, for Aristotle, mathematical explanation plays no\nrole in the study of nature, especially in biology. This conception is,\nmost of all, a product of anti-scholastics of the late Renaissance, who\nsought to draw the greatest chasm between their own mechanism and\nscholasticism. Mathematics plays a vital role in both. The principal\nway in which mathematics enters into biological explanation is through\nhypothetical necessity: \nIf X is to have feature Y (which is good\nfor X), then it is a feature of its matter that Z be\nthe case.\n\nZ may be a constraint determined by a mathematical fact.\nFor example, animals by nature do not have an odd number of feet. For\nif one had an odd number of feet, it would walk awkardly or the feet\nwould have to be of different lengths (De incessuanimalium 9).\nTo see this, imagine an isosceles triangle with a altitude drawn.\n12. The Infinite (apeiron)\n\n\nAristotle famously rejects the infinite in mathematics and in\nphysics, with some notable exceptions. He defines it thus:\nThe infinite is that for which it is always possible to\ntake something outside.\n\n\nImplicit in this notion is an unending series of magnitudes, which will\nbe achieved either by dividing a magnitude (the infinite by division)\nor by adding a magnitude to it (the infinite by addition). This is why\nhe conceives of the infinite as pertaining to material explanation, as\nit is indeterminate and involves potential cutting or joining (cf.\nSection 7.5). \n\n\nAristotle argues that in the case of magnitudes, an infinitely large\nmagnitude and an infinitely small magnitude cannot exist. In fact, he\nthinks that universe is finite in size. He also agrees with Anaxagoras,\nthat given any magnitude, it is possible to take a smaller. Hence, he\nallows that there are infinite magnitudes in a different sense. Since\nit is always possible to divide a magnitude, the series of division is\nunending and so is infinite. This is a potential, but never actual\ninfinite. For each division potentially exists. Similarly, since it is\nalways possible to add to a finite magnitude that is smaller than the\nwhole universe continually smaller magnitudes, there is a potential\ninfinite in addition. That series too need never end. For example, if I\nadd to some magnitude a foot board, and then less than a half a foot,\nand then less than a fourth, and so forth, the total amount added will never\nexceed two feet. Aristotle claims that the mathematician never needs\nany other notion of the infinite.\n\n\nHowever, since Aristotle believes that the universe has no beginning\nand is eternal, it follows that in the past there have been an infinite\nnumber of days. Hence, his rejection of the actual infinite in the case\nof magnitude does not seem to extend to the concept of time.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle on the Infinite\n13. Aristotle and the Evidence for the History of Mathematics\n\n\nAs philosophers usually do, Aristotle cites simple or familiar examples\nfrom contemporary mathematics, although we should keep in mind that\neven basic geometry such as we find in Euclid's Elements would\nhave been advanced studies. The average education in mathematics would\nhave been basic arithmetical operations (possibly called\nlogistik\u00ea) and metrological geometry (given certain\ndimensions of a figure, to find other dimensions), such as were also\ntaught in Egypt. Aristotle does allude to this sort of mathematics on\noccasion, but most of his examples come from the sort of mathematics\nwhich we have come to associate with Greece, the constructing of\nfigures from given figures and rules, and the proving that figures have\ncertain properties, and the \u2018discovery\u2019 of numbers with\ncertain properties or proving that certain classes of numbers have\ncertain properties. If we attend carefully to his examples, we can even\nsee an emerging picture of elementary geometry as taught in the\nAcademy. In the supplement are provided twenty-five of his favorite\npropositions (the list is not exhaustive). \n\n\nAristotle also makes some mathematical claims that are genuinely\nproblematic. Was he ignorant of contemporary work? Why does he ignore\nsome of the great problems of his time? Is there any reason why\nAristotle should be expected, for example to refer to conic sections?\nNonetheless, Aristotle does engage in some original and difficult\nmathematics. Certainly, in this Aristotle was more an active\nmathematician than his mentor, Plato.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle and Greek Mathematics\nGlossary\n\n\nThe standard English translation is given first, and, where\nappropirate, other more idiomatic translations.
