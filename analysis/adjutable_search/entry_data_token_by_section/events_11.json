    "main_text": "Event Metaphysics and Semantics || Identity\n3.3 Essence\n\nLastly, there is an array of questions that arise in relation to the\nmodal profile of events. Could Brutus\u2019s stabbing of\nCaesar\u2014that particular event that took place at the\nides of March, 44 BCE\u2014have taken place at a different time?\nCould it have taken place somewhere else than in the Senate at the\nCuria of Pompey in Rome? Could it have been less violent than it was?\nCould it have been something else than a stabbing, e.g., a poisoning?\nCould it have been done by someone else than Brutus, or could it have\nhad a different victim than Caesar?\n\nQuestions such as these, and more generally questions about the\nessential features of an event, arise naturally and play a crucial\nrole in the context of counterfactual thinking. Yet it appears that\nthe answers will depend crucially on one\u2019s metaphysical\nstandpoint. For example, philosophers who endorse a reductionist\nmetaphysics of events \u00e0 la Kim (1966, 1969) tend to be\nessentialist about all these features: if event e is an\nexemplification of property P by objects o1,\n\u2026, on at time t, then it is\nnecessarily so\u2014and ditto for other reductionist metaphysics,\nsuch as Lombard\u2019s (1979, 1986). On such views, the actual\noccurrence of an event is a contingent matter, but it isn\u2019t a\ncontingent matter whether an actually occurring event has the features\nit has. Others feel differently, arguing that a lot depends on how we\nerect the relevant de re/de dicto distinctions in the way\nevents are individuated (Forbes 1985), to the point that some may even\nthink that events have no individual essences except perhaps\nfor their \u201crarified and elusive\u201d haecceities\n(Lycan 1987). (That events have haecceities, or thisnesses,\nis itself a controversial matter, though see e.g. Berckmans 1995 and\nDiekemper 2009.) Moreover, the questions themselves are open to a\nnumber of qualifications. For example, with regard to time, we may\nwant to distinguish the question of whether an event could have\noccurred wholly earlier or wholly later than it actually did (Lombard\n1982) from the question of whether it could have occurred more quickly\nor more slowly (Bennett 1987; Lombard 1992, 1995). With regard to an\nevent\u2019s participants, we may want to distinguish between, say,\nan action\u2019s agent and its essential subject: perhaps\nBrutus\u2019s stabbing of Caesar could not have been done by someone\nelse than Brutus, but surely the hand with which Brutus held the knife\nplayed a different, more essential role than his left ear lobe\n(Lombard 1981, 1986; Carter 1989). And so on.\n\nThere are also questions about an event\u2019s essence that arise\nnaturally by analogy with questions about the essence of other\nentities, beginning with objects. For example, just as one may wonder\nwhether objects can be contingently identical, one may wonder whether\nthe relationship between, say, certain pain-events and the\ncorresponding brain-events is one of contingent identity (Teichman\n1967; Feldman 1974; Maxwell 1979). Just as we may wonder whether\nobjects have their origin essentially, so we may wonder whether events\nhave their causes essentially (van Inwagen 1978; Carter 1979; Lombard\n1986; Hughes 1994). Just as we may wonder whether objects have their\nparts essentially, so we may ask whether events could have been\ncomposed of different parts than the ones they actually have (Thomson\n1977; Carter 1979; Hornsby 1997; Allen 2005; Daniels & Goswick\n2017). And just as we may wonder whether an object\u2019s topological\nstructure and relations are essential to its being the object it is,\nso we may wonder whether, say, a continuous event could have been\ndiscontinuous, or whether two successive events, such as a process and\nits culmination, are connected as a matter of necessity or only\ncontingently (Casati & Varzi 2000).\n\nFinally, as with every question concerning matters of possibility and\nnecessity, a lot will depend on how we understand modality in the\nfirst place. In the case of objects, different frameworks are\navailable to account for their de re modal profile, including\nframeworks that differ significantly with regard to whether transworld\nidentification is a matter of strict transworld identity or a mere\ncounterpart relation. When it comes to events, similar options present\nthemselves and there is no obvious reason to think that they should be\nhandled in a parallel fashion. Kripke (1972), for instance, is a\ntransworld identity theorist in both regards but Lewis is a\ncounterpart theorist with regard to objects (1968) and a transworld\nidentity theorist with regard to events, at least in his account of\ncausation (1973). Only recently the counterpart-theoretic framework\nhas been endorsed for objects and events alike (Schaffer 2005;\nMcDonnell 2016; Kaiserman 2017). Among other things, it is claimed\nthat such a unified framework allows for a better account of the\ncontext-sensitivity of much modal and causal talk, e.g. with reference\nto various puzzles of preemption and redundant causation. Its\nessentialist consequences, however, must be carefully evaluated: short\nof assuming that every object and event could have at most one\ncounterpart in any world, the very idea that, say, the death of Caesar\nis necessarily of Caesar becomes problematic (Hazen\n1979).\n",
