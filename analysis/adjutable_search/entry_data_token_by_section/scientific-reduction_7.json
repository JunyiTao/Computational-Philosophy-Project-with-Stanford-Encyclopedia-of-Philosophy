    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of science || \u201cNew Wave\u201d-models of reduction\n2.6 \u201cNew Wave\u201d-models of reduction\n\nRelatively independent of structuralist models, philosophers who work\nat the interface of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of\nscience have developed accounts that have come to be known as\n\u2018New Wave\u2019 reductionism.\n\nNew Wave reductionists take it that their models give an appropriate\nreconstruction of a specific kind of scientific development\n(Churchland 1986: 279ff.; Bickle 1998: chapter 1). At the same time,\nhowever, this movement is associated with a reductionist metaphysical\nposition. Arguing that neuroscience reduces or eliminates psychology,\nsome protagonists try to show that we should embrace an eliminative\nform of reductionism about the mind (e.g., Paul Churchland 1981, 1985;\nPatricia Churchland 1986; Bickle 1998). Thus, there is a tendency to\ncontinue debates originating from the philosophy of mind tradition.\nThe so called New Wave model (or better: a family of similar models),\nwhich was developed in a series of articles and books by Clifford\nHooker (1981), Paul Churchland (1979, 1985) and more recently John\nBickle (esp. 1998), builds on some aspects of Schaffner\u2019s\ncurrent model (1993) and its earlier versions (Schaffner 1967, 1974,\n1976). Here is a formulation of Hooker\u2019s definition:\n\n\nWithin TB construct an analog, T*R, of TR under\ncertain conditions CR such that TB and CR entail\nT*R and argue that the analog relation, AR, between\nT*R and TR warrants claiming (some kind of) reduction\nrelation, R, between TR and TB. Thus (TB\n& CR \u2192 T*R) and (T*R AR\nTR) warrants (TB R TR). (Hooker 1981:\n49)\n\n\nThe conditions, CR, will consist of limiting assumptions and\nboundary conditions that guarantee that if TB is more\ncomprehensive than TR, the application of elements of\nTB\u2019s vocabulary is restricted to the domain relevant for\nTR. The idea is to effect reductions that include corrections\nby working on the reducing theory (here \u2018TB\u2019) and\nnot by working with corrections formulated in the vocabulary of the\nreduced theory. Ronald Endicott (1998: 56) identifies four core\naspects of New Wave reduction: (i) \u201cNew Wave\nconstruction\u201d: the corrected version of the reduced theory is\nconstructed within the vocabulary of the reducing theory; (ii)\n\u201cNew Wave deduction\u201d: this corrected version is deduced\nfrom the reducing theory; (iii) \u201cNew Wave relation\u201d:\nanalogical relations play the role bridge-laws play within Nagelian\nmodels; (iv) \u201cNew Wave continuum\u201d: these analogical\nrelations may differ in degree of strength\u2014reductions based on\nstrong analogical relations justify a conservative stand towards the\n(ontology of) the reduced science, whereas reductions based on weak\nanalogical relations justify elimination. Identity (a limiting case\nfor the continuum), for example, ensures that the ontology of the\nreduced theory is preserved by the reducing theory.\n\nSo, what is the basic refinement of New Wave reduction? According to\nBickle (1998: 29 & 1992: 224) and Paul Churchland (1985: 11),\navoiding reference to bridge-principles has a great epistemological\nadvantage: The epistemological virtue of reduction does not depend\nupon knowledge of bridge-principles. Rather, comparison of reduced and\nreducing theories justifies identity claims.\n\nNew Wave reductionists typically allow for a great variety of\nrelations backing up the analogical relation established between\nTR and TR*. In New Wave reduction, bridge-laws are\nreplaced by ordered pairs of elements of the descriptive parts of the\nvocabularies of the two theories, which enable us to judge the degree\nof similarity between the derived image (which is formulated in the\nlanguage of the reducing theory) and the reduced theory (Bickle 1992:\n223). Reduction is associated with a space of theory-relations ranging\nfrom \u201cperfectly smooth\u201d or \u201cretentive\u201d\nreductions to \u201cbumpy\u201d reductions, which are best\nunderstood as mere replacements (Bickle 1992: 223; Hooker 1981: 45).\nBickle describes smooth reductions as follows:\n(\u2018IN\u2019 designates the derived image and\n\u2018TO\u2019 designates the reduced or the\n\u201cold\u201d theory):\n\n\nIn cases lying at or near the retentive endpoint, the IN is the\nexactly equipotent isomorphic image of the TO, and no\ncounterfactual limiting assumptions or boundary conditions are\nrequired for the derivation of IN. (Bickle 1992: 223)\n\n\nIn this case, the pairing of the terms corresponds to identity of\nreferents (Bickle 1992: 224) and IN can be directly obtained\nfrom TR (the reducing theory), whereas in cases on the opposite\npoint of the spectrum, pairing is achieved only by reference to\ncounterfactual limiting assumptions and boundary conditions. In this\ncase, ontology is eliminated, as in the reduction of phlogiston-theory\ncase.\n",
