    "main_text": "Psychology and the Life Sciences || Mach Bands\n3.2 Mach Bands\n\n\nIn 1865 Mach published, \u201cOn the effect of the spatial\ndistribution of the light stimulus on the retina,\u201d the first of a\nseries of remarkable articles on what are now known today as Mach\nBands.\n\n\n\nMach Bands \u00a9 Alan Stubbs, from\n Perceptual Stuff.\n\nReproduced with permission.\n\n\n\nThe thin dark bands along the outer edges of the gradients and the\nthin light bands along the inner edges of the gradients are optical\nillusions. The cause of this effect is due to contrast perception; we\nover process at boundaries and under process where there is\nconstancy. In fact sensory response can even stop with unchanging\nstimulation. Mach is credited for discovering lateral inhibition in\nour sense organs, the idea that our senses pre-process information\nbefore sending it to the brain.\n\n\nBefore this period, optical illusions were understood as just that,\nerrors in judgment, quirks of the brain. The sense organs were\nseen as simple media with a direct link to the brain. Their only\nrole was to transmit a sensation to the brain, where it was then\ninterpreted. Mach argued that the processing does not\nall occur in the brain. The quirks of judgment are not due to\nprocessing errors in the brain, but innate features of the senses\nthemselves.\n\n\nThe immediate significance of this was that it provided a strong\nargument against direct representationalist theories of\nperception. There simply is no isomorphism between reality and\nappearance. But Mach took this even further, embedding it within\nhis evolutionary Fechnerian framework.\n\n\nMach argued that perception works through perceiving the relations\nbetween stimuli. And this process is at the root of all\nlife. The same process that drives evolution, drives perception,\nand even (as we shall see shortly) drives science.\n\n\nSince every retinal point perceives itself, so to speak, as above or\nbelow the average of its neighbors, there results a characteristic type\nof perception. Whatever is near the mean of the surroundings becomes\neffaced, whatever is above or below is disproportionately brought into\nprominence. One could say that the retina schematizes and\ncaricatures. The teleological significance of this process is\nclear in itself. It is an analog of abstraction and of the\nformation of concepts. [Mach 1868, in Ratliff 1965: 306]\n\n\nThat which is constant receives less attention, that which varies\nmust be brought into equilibrium. It is this process of bringing\ncontrasts into equilibrium which is at the basis of all organic\nprocesses, evolutionary, developmental, and perceptual. The\norganism is a dynamic system that has innate tendencies to\nself-regulation and equilibrium. When equilibrium is disturbed,\nwhich can happen on a variety of levels, the organism works to form a\nnew equilibrium. The senses are not things that got passively\nwritten on, but rather things that interact with environments.\nLife is not mechanistic but teleological.\n\n\nAnd this is not an accident, for can we imagine life\notherwise? Mach asks us to consider the following:\n\n\nLet us first ask how we would find our way in the visual world if we\nwould perceive, not relations of, but only differences in,\nillumination. One and the same thing in the same surroundings\nwould become immediately unrecognizable with the slightest alteration\nof light intensity, such as when a cloud covers the sun. Should\nwe still want to find our way, we would then have to habituate\nourselves to maintain equal levels of light intensity, for instance by\nclosing and opening our eyes. In fact, if this god of the\npsychophysical law were non-existent, the organism itself would have to\ndevise it and, if the Darwinian theory is correct, it has devised\nit. The seeing of light intensity relations, within certain\nlimits, is necessary for the existence of organisms. [Mach 1868 in\nRatliff 1965: 300]\n\n\nWe do not perceive the world in itself, Mach claims. If we did\nwe would perceive chaos. Thus we have evolved senses that\nperceive contrasts of perception, relations of perception.\nSensations by themselves can have no organic meaning; only the\nrelations of sensations to one another can have meaning.\nPerception, Mach believed, is never perception of direct stimuli.\n",
