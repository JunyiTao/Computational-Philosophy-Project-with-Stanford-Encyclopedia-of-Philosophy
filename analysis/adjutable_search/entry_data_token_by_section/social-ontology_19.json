One debate in the literature concerns the kind\nof entities that social groups are: collections, classes, sets,\nfusions, structures, or some other kind of entity. It may seem natural\nto think of a group as a set of people in the mathematical sense.\nHowever, groups can persist through changes in membership, while sets\nare generally understood as having their members essentially (see\nSharvy 1968, Ruben 1985, Uzquiano 2004, Sheehy 2006). Effingham (2010)\nproposes an account that identifies groups with complex sets, so that\nthey can have different members at different times and at different\nworlds. Others (including Macdonald & Pettit 1981, Copp 1984,\nSheehy 2006) argue that groups are fusions of people. A problem with\nthis is the transitivity of parthood: since Alice\u2019s finger is a\npart of Alice, it follows from the fusion view that if Alice is a part\nof a group, then so is Alice\u2019s finger. That is a problem,\nbecause while Alice is a member of the group her finger is not.\nAnother view is that groups are realizations of structures: Schmitt\n(2003a) considers and objects to this, and Ritchie (2013) defends it.\nOthers argue that groups are distinct from their members but are\nconstituted by them (Uzquiano 2004, Jansen 2009, Epstein 2015).\n\nDifferent approaches to groups make different commitments with regard\nto the entities that should be included among the social\ngroups\u2014e.g., committees, teams, corporations, universities,\nnations, races, genders, red-haired people. Some theorists also\npropose that social groups must have certain distinctive\ncharacteristics, such as the members being in certain cognitive states\nor being subject to certain norms. Related to this is the question of\nwhether there are distinct types of groups. Ritchie (2015) argues that\nthere are two prominent types\u2014organized groups, which\nare realizations of structured sets of nodes that stand in a\nfunctional relation to one another, and feature groups, which\nare collections of people who have a property or feature in common\nwith one another. Thomasson (forthcoming) argues that an important way\nof characterizing groups is in terms of the norms they bear. Epstein\n(forthcoming) challenges simple typologies of groups and proposes a\nframework for the metaphysics of groups involving multiple\ndimensions.\n",
