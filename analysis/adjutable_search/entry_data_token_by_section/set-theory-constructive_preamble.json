    "main_text": "\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories\nare\n axiomatic theories of sets\n in the\nstyle of\n Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF)\n which are based on\n intuitionistic logic.\n They were introduced in the 1970\u2019s and they represent a formal context\n within which to codify mathematics based on intuitionistic logic (see the entry\non\n constructive mathematics).\nThey are formulated on the standard first order language of \nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory and make no direct use of inherently \nconstructive ideas. In working in constructive and intuitionistic \nZF we can thus to some extent rely on our familiarity with ZF and \nits heuristics.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the similarities with classical set theory, the\nconcepts of set defined by constructive and\nintuitionistic set theories differ considerably from that of\nthe classical tradition; they also differ from each other. The\ntechniques utilised to work within them, as well as to obtain\nmetamathematical results about them, also diverge in some respects\nfrom the classical tradition because of their commitment to\nintuitionistic logic. In fact, as is common in intuitionistic\nsettings, a plethora of semantic and proof-theoretic methods are\navailable for the study of constructive and intuitionistic set\ntheories.\n\n\nThis entry introduces the main features of constructive and intuitionistic set theories. As the field is expanding at a fast \npace, we can only briefly recall some key aspects of results and available techniques. We focus more on\nconstructive set theory to highlight important\nfoundational issues that arise within it.\nNote that we omit a conspicuous part of the literature \non constructive and intuitionistic ZF which relates to their categorical \ninterpretations. This area has seen major developments over the years, so much \nso that an adequate treatment of that progress would require a \nsubstantial extension of this entry. \nThe interested reader might wish to consult the entry on \n category theory \n and its references (see also its\n supplement Programmatic Reading Guide). \n",
