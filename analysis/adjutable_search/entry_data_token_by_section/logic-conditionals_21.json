Modals and Speech Acts\n\nThe previous sections have looked at propositional logics of\nconditionals, which extend Boolean logic with a distinguished\nconditional operator. To wrap up, we look briefly at some richer\nlanguages, in particular at the interplay of conditionals with\nmodalities, and at the interplay of conditionals with other speech\nacts than assertions.\n",
