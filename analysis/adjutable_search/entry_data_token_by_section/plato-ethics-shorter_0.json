    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAt the center of Plato\u2019s shorter ethical works is the\n Apology of Socrates,\n which consists of a speech purportedly given by Socrates at his\ntrial, and is probably the closest of Plato\u2019s works to the\nhistorical Socrates. The Apology is closely linked to two\nother works. The first is the\n Euthyphro,\n which shows Socrates discussing reverence as he is about to report to\ncourt for his indictment, an indictment that includes by implication a\ncharge of irreverence. The second is the\n Crito,\n which shows Socrates in prison on the day before his execution,\ndefending his decision to accept the penalty rather than corrupt the\nlaw by bribing his way out of prison and away from Athens. The\nCrito argument depends on a principle that is the bedrock of\nSocratic ethics: that it is never right to do wrong, even in return\nfor wrong (49ab). This bedrock principle rules out the view that one\nshould do right by one\u2019s friends and wrong by one\u2019s\nenemies, a view that had roots in Greek tradition.\n\nFour of the dialogues in this group are concerned with\n definition\n of virtues or good qualities:\n Euthyphro\n (piety or reverence),\n Laches\n (courage),\n Charmides\n (temperance, integrity, or soundness of mind), and\n Hippias Major\n (the fine or beautiful). These dialogues of definition indirectly\nraise questions about the mutual relations of the virtues, and this\nquestion is taken up explicitly in the\n Protagoras,\n which introduces the doctrines of the\n unity of virtue\n and the impossibility of\n acrasia\n (the doctrine that it is impossible to know what is right and still\ndo wrong). A corollary of this is the claim that no one does wrong\nwillingly, which supports part of Socrates\u2019 argument in the\nApology. Another corollary is that in seeking virtue we\nshould seek knowledge about virtue. Nevertheless, Socrates entertains\nstrong doubts as to the teachability of virtue. Socrates sometimes\ntreats virtue on the analogy of\n techne,\n however, and techne means a body of specialized knowledge\nthat can be taught. \n\nAside from the Apology and Crito, which contain\nextended speeches, the most prominent feature of these works is\nSocrates\u2019 use of questions calling for short answers. Although\nSocrates uses this style of conversation for a number of different\npurposes, it has been called the Socratic method, and in one of its\nforms is has become known to scholars as the\n elenchus.\n\nFour dialogues in the group show Socrates in contrast to\n sophists,\n who were paid teachers of subjects ranging from\n rhetoric\n to mathematics. Some sophists claimed expertise on virtue, and\nSocrates took it as part of his mission to investigate such claims.\nThe Protagoras treats its eponymous sophist with some\nrespect, but the two Hippias dialogues (Hippias\n Major\n and Hippias\n Minor)\n poke fun at their namesake, and the\n Euthydemus\n shows its sophists as puzzle-makers who cannot make good their claim\nto teach virtue. The Gorgias is too long to be considered in\nthis article, but it has strong affinities with these shorter works in\nstyle and content. \n\nFollowing the lead of Vlastos (1971 and 1991), many scholars represent\nthe philosophical content of these dialogues as teachings of the\nhistorical Socrates. This article follows that convention. On\nSocrates, see Benson 1992, Brickhouse and Smith 2000, Rappe and\nKamtekar 2005, Rudebusch 2009, Bussanich and Smith (eds.) 2013, and\nPrior 2019. On Socrates\u2019 ethical theory, see the first half of Irwin\n1995 as well as Reshotko 2006, Iakovo 2008, and Smith 2021.\n",
