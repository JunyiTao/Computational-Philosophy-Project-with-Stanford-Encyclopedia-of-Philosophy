    "main_text": "Antireductionism\n6. Antireductionism\n\nSome advocate antireductionist, antisupervenience views (Carroll 1994,\n2008, Ismael 2015, Lange 2000, 2009, Maudlin 2007, Woodward\n1992). Regarding the question of what it is to be a law, they\nreject the answers given by Humeans; they often deny Humean\nsupervenience, and they see no advantage in an appeal to universals.\nThey reject all attempts to say what it is to be a law that do not\nappeal to nomic concepts. Yet they still believe that there really are\nlaws of nature; they are not antirealists. Maudlin takes\nlawhood to be a primitive status and laws to be ontological primitives\n\u2014 fundamental entities in our ontology. His project is to show\nwhat work laws can do, defining physical possibility in terms of laws\nand sketching law-based accounts of the counterfactual conditional and\nof explanation. Carroll\u2019s analysis of lawhood is in\nterms of causal/explanatory concepts. The starting point is the\nintuition that laws are not accidental, that they are not\ncoincidences. Not being a coincidence, however, is not all there is to\nbeing a law. For example, it might be true that there are no gold\nspheres greater than 1000 miles in diameter because there is so little\ngold in the universe. In that case, strictly speaking, that\ngeneralization would be true, suitably general, and not a coincidence.\nNevertheless, that would not be a law. Arguably, what blocks this\ngeneralization from being a law is that something in nature\n\u2014 really, an initial condition of the universe, the limited\namount of gold \u2014 accounts for the generalization. Contrast this\nwith the law that inertial bodies have no acceleration. With this and\nother laws, it seems that it holds because of nature (itself). \nLange\u2019s (2000, 2009) treatment includes an account of what it is\nto be a law in terms of a counterfactual notion of stability. The\noverall account is intricate, but the basic idea is this: Call a\nlogically closed set of true propositions stable if and only if the\nmembers of the set would remain true given any antecedent that is\nconsistent with the set itself. So, for example, the set of logical\ntruths is trivially stable, because logical truths would be true no\nmatter what. A set that included the accidental generalization that\nall the people in the room are sitting, but is consistent with the\nproposition that someone in the room shouts \u2018Fire!\u2019 would\nnot be a stable set; if someone were to shout \u2018Fire\u2019, then\nsomeone in the room would not be sitting. Lange argues that no\nstable set of sub-nomic facts \u2014 except maybe the set of all\ntruths \u2014 contains an accidental truth. \u201cBy identifying the\nlaws as the members of at least one non-maximal stable set, we\ndiscover how a sub-nomic fact\u2019s lawhood is fixed by the\nsub-nomic facts and the subjunctive facts about them\u201d (2009,\n43).\n\nAttempts to undermine antireductionism often include challenges to\nantisupervenience like those mentioned at the end of Section 4. \nHildebrand challenges Carroll\u2019s and Maudlin\u2019s\nantireductionisms based on the failure of primitive laws to explain\nthe uniformity of nature (Hildebrand, 2013). A symposium on\nLange\u2019s (2009)  Laws and Lawmakers includes, along with\nLange\u2019s replies, a variety of criticisms from Carroll, Loewer,\nand Woodward. (See Lange et al., 2011.) Demerest (2012)\nraises three challenges to Lange\u2019s antireductionism all centered\non whether subjunctives are suited to play the role of lawmakers.\n",
