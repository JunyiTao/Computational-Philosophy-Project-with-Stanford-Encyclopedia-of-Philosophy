    "main_text": "\n\nWith respect to many, if not most issues, there exist significant\ndifferences of opinion among individuals who seem to be equally\nknowledgeable and sincere. Individuals who apparently have access to\nthe same information and are equally interested in the truth do in\nfact affirm incompatible perspectives on, for instance, significant\nsocial, political, and economic issues. Such diversity of opinion,\nthough, is nowhere more evident than in the area of religious thought.\nOn almost every religious issue there are honest, knowledgeable people\nwho hold significantly diverse, often incompatible beliefs. \n\nReligious diversity of this sort can fruitfully be explored in many\nways \u2014for instance, from psychological, anthropological, or\nhistorical perspectives. The current discussion, however, will concern\nitself primarily with those key issues surrounding religious diversity\nwith which philosophers, especially analytic philosophers of religion,\nare most concerned at present. Specifically, our discussion will focus\nprimarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious\ndiversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can\na person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in\nclaiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally\njustifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective?\nCan it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path\ninto the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be\napproached in public education? The answers to such questions are not\nsimply academic; they have practical implications. They increasingly\nhave great impact on how we treat others, both personally and\ncorporately.\n\nThe main goal of this discussion, it is important to note, is not to\nsupport a given perspective on these issues. It is to clarify the\nissues and explore differing perspectives.\n",
