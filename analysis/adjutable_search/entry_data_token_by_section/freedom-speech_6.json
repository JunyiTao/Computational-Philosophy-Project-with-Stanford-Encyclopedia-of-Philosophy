    "main_text": "The Offense Principle and Free Speech || Pornography and the Offense Principle\n3.2 Pornography and the Offense Principle\n\nHow does the offense principle help us deal with the issue of erotica?\nGiven the above criteria, Feinberg argues that books should never be\nbanned because the offensive material is easy to avoid. If one is\nunaware of the content and should become offended in the course of\nreading the text, the solution is simple-close the book. A similar\nargument would be applied to erotic films. The French film Baise-Moi\nwas in essence banned in Australia in 2002 because of its supposed\noffensive material (it was denied a rating which meant that it could\nnot be shown in cinemas). It would seem, however, that the offense\nprinciple outlined by Feinberg would not permit such prohibition\nbecause it is very easy to avoid being offended by the film. It should\nalso be legal to advertise the film, but some limits could be placed\non the content of the advertisement so that sexually explicit material\nis not placed on billboards in public places (because these are not\neasily avoidable). At first glance it might seem strange to have a\nmore stringent speech code for advertisements than for the thing being\nadvertised; the harm principle would not provide the grounds for such\na distinction, but it is a logical conclusion of the offense\nprinciple.\n\nWhat of pornography i.e. material that is offensive because of its\nextremely violent or degrading content? In this case the offense is\nmore profound: simply knowing that such material exists is enough to\ndeeply offend many people. The difficulty here is that bare knowledge,\ni.e., being offended by knowing that something exists or is taking\nplace, is not as serious as being offended by something that one does\nnot like and that one cannot escape. If we allow that films\nshould be banned because some people are offended, even when they do\nnot have to view them, consistency demands that we allow the\npossibility of prohibiting many forms of expression. A lot of people\nfind strong attacks on religion, or t.v. shows by religious\nfundamentalists deeply offensive. Feinberg argues that even though\nsome forms of pornography are profoundly offensive to many people,\nthey should not be prohibited on these grounds.\n",
