    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects || From Frege to Intensions\n3.1 From Frege to Intensions\n\nThroughout most of his semantic work, Montague avowedly adopted a\nversion of Frege\u2019s (1892) distinction between\n\u2018sense\u2019 and \u2018denotation\u2019. Frege\u2019s\noriginal line of thought concerns sentences like The Greeks did\nnot know that the morning star is the evening star, which does\nnot seem to express that the Greeks were confused about the\nself-identity of Venus. Frege\u2019s analysis accounts for this\nobservation by having descriptive names like the morning star\ndenote their referents in ordinary contexts, but something different\nin embedded clauses (or, more generally, in \u2018indirect\ncontexts\u2019): their \u2018sense\u2019 \u2013 a semantic value\nthat captures the way in which an object is referred to. Since\nreferring to a celestial object by the morning star differs\nfrom referring to it by the evening star, the embedded clause\ndoes not denote an analytic truth but a contingent proposition, whose\ntruth may well have escaped the Greeks.\n\nFrege\u2019s approach is known to run into a number of problems. One\nof them concerns the iteration of indirect contexts, as in Gottlob\nsuspected that the Greeks did not know that the morning star is the\nevening star. Though he did not explicitly address the issue,\nFrege is usually understood as resorting to an infinite hierarchy of\never more indirect senses to be associated with each otherwise\nnon-ambiguous expression (Dummett 1981, 267; Carnap 1947, \u00a730;\nKripke 2008, 183; see however Parsons 1981 for a more cautious\ninterpretation). The purported Fregean line of analysis has been\ncriticized for multiplying ambiguity beyond necessity (Janssen 2012)\nas well as raising serious learnability issues (Davidson 1968, 11).\nThough Montague did acknowledge a hierarchy of senses, he did not\nemploy it for the analysis of iterated indirect contexts. Instead, he\nidentified Frege\u2019s (1892) senses with intensions along\nthe lines of Carnap (1947) \u2013 set theoretic functions on a\nlogical space of possible worlds (or world-time-pairs) whose values\nare the denotations of expressions \u2013 their extensions.\nIn particular, the way in which a description refers to its referent\nis captured by its dependence on contingent facts. As a case in point,\nthe famous Fregean descriptions differ in intension as long as there\nis a possible world in which the brightest star at dawn is not the\nsame object as the brightest star at night.\n\nThe replacement of senses by intensions paves the way to an\nalternative approach to iterated intensionality: generalizing\nKripke\u2019s (1963) semantics of modality, Montague (1970b, 73)\naccounted for clausal embedding in terms of propositional operators\nwhose extension, like that of their argument, depends on a given point\nin logical space. As it turns out, this so-called \u2018neighborhood\nsemantics\u2019 of clausal embedding does without reference to a\nsense hierarchy even in iterated indirect environments\n(ibid., 76), which is why Montague used it as the basis for\nhis general compositional analysis of natural language. Montague\n(ibid., 75f.) still presented his approach as being in line\nwith Frege\u2019s, thereby emphasizing the commonalities in the\noverall architecture of semantic theory, which he identified as\n\u2018Frege\u2019s functionality principle\u2019:\n\nthe extension of a formula is a function of the extensions (ordinary\nextensions) of those of its parts not standing within indirect\ncontexts (that is [\u2026] not standing within the scope of an\noperator), together with the intensions (what Frege also called\nindirect extensions) of those parts that do stand within\nindirect contexts. (Montague 1970b, 74f.)\n\n\nMoreover, Montague (1970c, 390) called one of the key constructions of\nhis general theory of reference \u2018Fregean interpretation\u2019;\nand in his type-logical hierarchy, intensions are marked by the letter\n\u2018\\(s\\)\u2019, which is short for \u2018sense\u2019\n(ibid., 379). This notation has become quite common in\nlinguistic semantics, although the \u2018\\(s\\)\u2019 is frequently\ntaken to stand for possible \\(s\\)ituations!\n\nOnly at one point in his semantic work did Montague abandon his\nFregean stance: in his essay \u2018English as a formal\nlanguage\u2019 (1970a), he employed a one-level architecture of\n\u2018Russellian\u2019 denotations and expressed his doubts about\nthe cogency of Frege\u2019s motivation for non-propositional senses\n(ibid., sec. 9, remark xi), thereby foreshadowing\nKaplan\u2019s (1975) comparison between the frameworks of Frege 1892\nand Russell 1905. Yet in his \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019, Montague\ncommented:\n\nI should like, however, to withdraw my emphasis [\u2026] on the\npossibility of doing without a distinction between sense and\ndenotation. While such a distinction can be avoided in special cases,\nit remains necessary for the general theory, and probably provides the\nclearest approach even to the special cases in question. (Montague\n1970c, 374, fn.)\n\n\nEven though Montague tended to play down the difference, the switch\nfrom senses to intensions is known to have dramatic consequences on\nthe fine-grainedness of semantic analysis. In particular, as mentioned\nin section 2.4, any two logically equivalent sentences come out as\nhaving the same intension; yet their senses will diverge if their\ntruth value is not determined in the same way. Montague indicated how\nthis unwelcome consequence may be avoided in terms of mismatches\nbetween worlds and contexts, creating what he called\n\u2018\u201cunactualizable\u201d points of reference\u2019\n(ibid., 382), but he did not provide a detailed analysis to\nsubstantiate his sketchy remarks.\n",
