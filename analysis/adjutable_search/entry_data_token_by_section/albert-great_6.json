    "main_text": "Ethics\n7. Ethics\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s ethics rests on his understanding of human freedom. This\nfreedom is expressed through the human power to make unrestricted\ndecisions about their own actions. This power, the liberum\narbitrium, Albert believes is identified neither with the\nintellect nor the will. He holds this extraordinary position because\nof his analysis of the genesis of human action. In his treatise on man\n(Liber de homine) he accounts for human action as beginning\nwith the intellect considering the various options for action open to\na person at a given moment in time. This is coupled by the will\ndesiring the beneficial outcome of the proposed event. Then the\nliberum arbitrium chooses one of the options proposed by the\nintellect or the object of the will\u2019s desire. The will then moves the\nperson to act on the basis of the choice of the liberum\narbitrium. Brutes do not have this ability, he argues, and must\nact solely on their initial desire. Hence they have no power of free\nchoice. In his later writings, however, Albert eliminates the first\nact of the will. But even so he distinguishes the liberum\narbitrium from both the will and the intellect, presumably so\nthat it can respond to the influences of both these faculties\nequally. Thus the way to ethics is open.\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s concern with ethics as such is found in his two\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. The\nprologues to both these works reveal Albert\u2019s original thoughts\non some problems about the discipline of ethics. He wonders if ethics\ncan be considered as a theoretical deductive science. He concludes that\nit can be so considered because the underlying causes of moral action\n(rationes morum) involve both necessary and universal\nprinciples, the conditions needed for a science according to the\nanalysis of Aristotle that Albert\n accepted.[18]\n The rationes morum are contrasted by him to the mere\nappearance of moral\n behaviour.[19]\n Thus virtue can be discussed in abstraction from particular actions\nof individual human agents. The same is true of other ethical\nprinciples. However, Albert maintains that it is possible to refer to\nparticular human acts as exemplifying relevant virtues and as such to\ninclude them in a scientific discussion of\n ethics.[20]\n Therefore, ethics is theoretical, even though the object of its\ntheory is the practical.\n\n\nAnother concern that Albert expresses is how ethics as a theoretical\ndeductive science can be relevant to the practice of the\nvirtuous life. He addresses this problem by distinguishing ethics as a\ndoctrine (ethica docens) from ethics as a practical activity\nof individual human beings (ethica\n utens).[21]\n The outcomes of these two aspects of ethics are different he\nargues. Ethics as a doctrine is concerned with teaching. It proceeds\nby logical analysis concentrating on the goals of human action in\ngeneral. As such its proper end is knowledge. But as a practical and\nuseful art ethics is concerned with action as a means to a desired\n end.[22]\n Its mode of discourse is rhetorical\u2014the persuasion of the\nhuman being to engage in the right actions that will lead to the\ndesired\n end.[23]\n Albert sees these two aspects of ethics as linked together by the\nvirtue of prudence. It is prudence that applies the results of the\ndoctrine of ethics to its\n practice.[24]\n Ethics considered as a doctrine operates through prudence as a remote\ncause of ethical action. Thus the two functions of ethics are related\nand ethics is considered by Albert as both a theoretical deductive\nscience and a practical applied science.\n\n\nAlbert goes beyond these methodological considerations. He addresses\nthe end of ethics, as he understands it. And here his psychology bears\nfruit. For he embraces the idea that the highest form of human\nhappiness is the contemplative life. This is the true and proper end\nof man, he claims. For the adept intellect, as noted above, is the\nhighest achievement to which the human condition can aspire. It\nrepresents the conjunction of the apex of the human mind to the\nseparated agent intellect. In this conjunction the separated agent\nintellect becomes the form of the soul. The soul experiences\nself-sufficiency and is capable of contemplative wisdom. This is as\nclose to beatitude as man can get in this life. Man is now capable of\ncontemplating separated beings as such and can live his life in almost\nstoical detachment from the concerns of sublunar existence.\n",
