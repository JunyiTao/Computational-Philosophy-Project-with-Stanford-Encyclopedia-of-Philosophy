    "main_text": "Freedom || Mediated Freedom\n4.2 Mediated Freedom\nIn Being and Nothingness, Sartre forwards an account of\n\u201cradical\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d freedom, an\nunconditioned \u201cfreedom-in-consciousness\u201d where we make or\ncreate ourselves ex nihilo, through the sheer\n\u201cupsurge\u201d of choice alone. But in the wake of Marxist\ncriticism in the 1940s and 1950s, his views changed; he realized that\nthis early account was far too abstract, interiorized, and influenced\nby Cartesian\n assumptions.[6]\nIt failed to engage the social, historical, and\nmaterial conditions that invariably limit and constrain our freedom. He\ncame to recognize that our choices and actions are always mediated by\nthe world, by the sociohistorical situation we\u2019ve been thrown\ninto. He sees that the idea of radical, unconditioned freedom \u201cis\nnonsense. The truth is that existence \u2018is-in-society\u2019 as it\n\u2018is-in-the-world\u2019\u201d (Sartre 1952 [1963, 590]). Freedom\nmust be understood as \u201cfreedom-in-situation.\u201d It is true\nthat we are free to create ourselves, but it is also true that we are\nalready created by our situation. \u201cMan,\u201d is best understood\nas \u201ca totally conditioned social being who does not render back\ncompletely what his conditioning has given him\u201d (Sartre 1972\n[2008, 35]).\nSartre\u2019s Marxist inspired conception of situated or mediated\nfreedom is one that had already been forwarded and developed by\nBeauvoir in her major treatises The Second Sex and The\nComing of Age and in her novels such as The Blood of\nOthers (1945 [1970]) and The Mandarins (1954 [1991]). The\nview is also developed by her compatriot Merleau-Ponty. In\nPhenomenology of Perception, for example, Merleau-Ponty makes\nit clear that the options we choose to act on do not emerge out of\nnothing. They are already embedded in a sociohistorical situation\n\u201cbefore any personal decision has been made.\u201d (1945 [1962,\n449]) The ways in which we create or make ourselves, then, are always\ncircumscribed by the meanings of our situation. We are simultaneously\nself-making and already made. \u201cWe exist in both ways at\nonce,\u201d writes Merleau-Ponty. \u201cWe choose the world, and the\nworld chooses us.\u201d (1945 [1962, 453\u2013454]). As we will see in\nsection 6.3, the recognition of the extent to which freedom is mediated\nby the material conditions of our situation opened existentialism to a\nbroader engagement with the social sphere and the structures of\noppression and violence that shape our experience and\nself-understanding.\n",
