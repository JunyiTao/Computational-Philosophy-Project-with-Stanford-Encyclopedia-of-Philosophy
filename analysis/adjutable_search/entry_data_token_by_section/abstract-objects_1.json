    "main_text": "Introduction || About the Expression \u2018Object\u2019\n1.1 About the Expression \u2018Object\u2019\n\nFrege famously distinguished two mutually exclusive ontological\ndomains, functions and objects. According to his\nview, a function is an \u2018incomplete\u2019 entity that maps\narguments to values, and is denoted by an incomplete expression,\nwhereas an object is a \u2018complete\u2019 entity and can be\ndenoted by a singular term. Frege reduced properties and relations to\nfunctions and so these entities are not included among the objects.\nSome authors make use of Frege\u2019s notion of \u2018object\u2019\nwhen discussing abstract objects (e.g., Hale 1987). But though\nFrege\u2019s sense of \u2018object\u2019 is important, it is not\nthe only way to use the term. Other philosophers include properties\nand relations among the abstract objects. And when the background\ncontext for discussing objects is type theory, properties and\nrelations of higher type (e.g., properties of properties, and\nproperties of relations) may be all be considered\n\u2018objects\u2019. This latter use of \u2018object\u2019 is\ninterchangeable with\n \u2018entity.\u2019[1]\n Throughout this entry, we will follow this last usage and treat the\nexpressions \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018entity\u2019 as having\nthe same meaning. (For further discussion, see the entry on\n objects.)\n",
