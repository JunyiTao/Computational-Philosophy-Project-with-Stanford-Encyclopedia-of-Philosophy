    "main_text": "The Definition of Critical Thinking\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\n\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\n\n\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\n\n\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\n\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\n\n\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\n\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\n\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\n\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n",
