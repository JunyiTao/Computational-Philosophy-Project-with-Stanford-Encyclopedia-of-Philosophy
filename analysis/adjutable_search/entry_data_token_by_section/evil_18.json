Some philosophers, such as Swinburne, are optimistic, and\nbelieve that \u201cthe required theodicy can be provided\u201d\n(1988, 311). Others, including many theists, are much less\nhopeful. Plantinga, for example remarks:\n\n\u2026 we cannot see why our world, with all its ills, would\nbe better than others we think we can imagine, or what, in\nany detail, is God\u2019s reason for permitting a given specific and\nappalling evil.  Not only can we not see this, we can\u2019t think of\nany very good possibilities.  And here I must say that most attempts\nto explain why God permits evil\u2014theodicies, as\nwe may call them\u2014strike me as tepid, shallow and ultimately\nfrivolous. (1985a, 35)\n\n\nWhat types of theodicies that have been proposed? An exhaustive\nsurvey is not possible here, but among the most important are\ntheodicies that appeal, first, to the value of acquiring desirable\ntraits of character in the face of suffering; secondly, to the value\nof libertarian free will; thirdly, to the value of the freedom to\ninflict horrendous evils upon others; and fourthly, to the value of a\nworld that is governed by natural laws.\n",
