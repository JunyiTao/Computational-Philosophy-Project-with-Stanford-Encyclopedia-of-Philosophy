    "main_text": "Alternative treatments of convention || Gilbert: plural subjects\n6.1 Gilbert: plural subjects\n\n\nEschewing Lewis\u2019s game-theoretic orientation, Margaret Gilbert\n(1989) instead draws inspiration from sociology, specifically from\nGeorg Simmel\u2019s theory of \u201csocial groups\u201d (1908). The\nbasic idea is that individual agents can \u201cjoin forces\u201d to\nachieve some common end, thereby uniting themselves into a collective\nentity. To develop this idea, Gilbert provides a complex account of how agents\nbind themselves into a \u201cplural subject\u201d of belief and\naction. A plural subject is a set of agents who regard themselves as\njointly committed to promoting some goal, sharing some belief, or\noperating under some principle of action. By virtue of their common\nknowledge of this joint commitment, members of the plural subject\nregard themselves as \u201cwe\u201d. They thereby regard one another\nas responsible for promoting the group\u2019s goals and principles.\nFor instance, two traveling companions make manifest their commitment\nto keep track of one another, whereas two people who happen to share a\nseat on a train do not. The traveling companions form a plural subject.\nThe unaffiliated travelers do not. The traveling companions regard each\nother as responsible for helping if one person falls behind, for not\nlosing one another in a crowd, and so on.\n\n\nGilbert proposes that \u201cour everyday concept of a social\nconvention is that of a jointly accepted principle of action, a group\nfiat with respect to how one is to act in certain situations\u201d (p.\n377). Members of a population jointly accept a fiat when it is\ncommon knowledge that they have made manifest their willingness to\naccept and promote that fiat as a basis for action. By Gilbert\u2019s\ndefinition, participants in a convention constitute a plural subject.\nFor they jointly accept the common goal of promoting some fiat.\nMoreover, members of the social group regard the fiat as exerting\nnormative force simply by virtue of the fact that they jointly accept\nit. Note that not all plural subjects instantiate conventions. For\ninstance, depending on the details of the case, the traveling\ncompanions from the previous paragraph might not. A convention arises\nonly when individual members of a plural subject jointly accept some\nfiat.\n\n\nGilbert\u2019s account differs from Lewis\u2019s in both\nontology and ideology. Ontologically, Gilbert\nisolates a sui generis entity, the plural subject, that\nLewis\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d approach does not\ncountenance. Gilbert argues that a population could instantiate a\nLewisian convention without giving rise to a plural subject.\nParticipants in a Lewisian convention may prefer that other\nparticipants conform to it, given that almost everyone does. But they\nneed not regard themselves as responsible for enforcing it or\nfor helping others conform. They would so regard themselves if they\nviewed themselves as belonging to a plural subject. Thus, a Lewisian\nconvention does not ensure that its adherents constitute a plural\nsubject.\n\n\nRegarding ideology, Gilbert\u2019s account attributes to\nconvention an intrinsically normative element that Lewis rejects. For\nGilbert, adopting a convention is making manifest a willingness to\npromote a certain fiat. Parties to a convention therefore accept that\nthey ought to act in accord with the fiat. In contrast, as we\nsaw in section 4.2, Lewis\u2019s account does not recognize any\nnormative elements as intrinsic to convention.\n\n\nThe contrast between Gilbert and Lewis instantiates a more general\ndebate over Homo economicus: a conception of agents as\nself-interested and instrumentally rational. Lewis attempts to analyze\nsocial phenomena reductively within that framework. In contrast,\nGilbert rejects the rational choice conception, opting for a picture,\nHomo sociologicus, according to which an agent acts based on\nher self-identification as a member of a social group constituted by\nvarious norms. Elizabeth Anderson (2000) analyzes how the clash between\nthese two conceptions relates to convention and normativity.\n\n\nIn her later work, Gilbert (2008) adopts a more concessive stance\ntowards Lewis\u2019s analysis of convention. She maintains that her\nanalysis handles many important social phenomena that Lewis\u2019s account\noverlooks, but she grants that there may be other social phenomena\nthat Lewis\u2019s account handles well.\n",
