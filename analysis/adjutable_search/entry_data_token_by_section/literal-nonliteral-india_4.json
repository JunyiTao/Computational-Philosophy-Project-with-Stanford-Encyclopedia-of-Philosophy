    "main_text": "Primary and Secondary Meaning\n2. Primary and Secondary Meaning\nOne of the most central distinctions in Indian philosophy of language is that between primary and secondary meaning. While this could be characterized as the distinction between \u201cliteral\u201d and \u201cnon-literal\u201d meaning, for some philosophers, word meanings that seem intuitively literal are classified as being secondary. For instance, the word \u201ccow\u201d in the sentence \u201cA cow is to be led out to pasture\u201d would, according to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers following Kum\u0101rila, be taken as an instance of secondary meaning, for reasons discussed below. Further, since the literal/non-literal distinction in Western philosophy of language is vexed (see the distinction \u201cliteral/non-literal\u201d in the entry on pragmatics), this entry henceforth avoids such terminology.\n",
