    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Categories, Rights, and Utility\n3.2 Categories, Rights, and Utility\n\nThere is an apparent tension between Mill\u2019s commitment to a\ncategorical approach to basic liberties and his defense of\nutilitarianism. Utilitarianism treats the good as prior to and\nindependent of the right or duty\u2014defining duty as the promotion\nof good consequences. Perhaps certain kinds of actions tend to be good\nor bad, but, according to direct utilitarianism, the moral quality of\na particular action depends on its own consequences. By contrast, the\ndeontological and natural rights traditions treat duty or the right as\nprior to and independent of the good. In particular, deontologists\nbelieve that it is not always one\u2019s duty to promote good\nconsequences. Sometimes one has a duty to do an act that is\nsuboptimal, and sometimes it is wrong to do the optimal act.\nDeontologists recognize moral constraints on pursuing the\ngood. These constraints usually take the form of categorical\nrules to perform or refrain from certain sorts of actions (e.g.,\nto keep promises or to refrain from lying), regardless of the\nconsequences. A special case of this perceived conflict between\ncategorical rules and utility is the perceived tension between utility\nand rights. For, on a common view, individual rights just are\na special case of categorical rules. Individual rights, such as rights\nto liberties or to freedom from harm, are interpreted as\n\u201ctrumps\u201d or \u201cside constraints\u201d on the pursuit\nof good consequences (Dworkin 1977: xi, 184\u2013205; Nozick 1974:\n28\u201335).\n\nThe apparent conflict between utility and rights poses an interesting\ntest for Mill, because he wants to defend liberal rights that have\nutilitarian foundations.\n\n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing\nindependent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense,\ngrounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\n(OL I 11)\n\n\nWe need to ask if Mill is able to reconcile his defense of utility and\nliberty without compromising either his utilitarianism or his defense\nof a right to liberties.\n",
