    "main_text": "Social Choice || The Informational Basis\n4.2 The Informational Basis\n\nSen (1970a) proposes a further generalization of the social choice\nframework, by permitting consideration of information about individual\nutility functions, not only preferences. This enlargement is motivated\nby the impossibility theorem, but also by the ethical relevance of\nvarious kinds of data. Distributional issues obviously require\ninterpersonal comparisons of well-being. For instance, an egalitarian\nevaluation of allocations needs a determination of who the worst-off\nare. It is tempting to think of such comparisons in terms of\nutilities. This has triggered an important body of literature which\nhas greatly clarified the meaning of various kinds of interpersonal\nutility comparisons (of levels, differences, etc.) and the relation\nbetween them and various social criteria (egalitarianism,\nutilitarianism, etc.). This literature (esp. d\u2019Aspremont and\nGevers 1977) has also provided an important formal analysis of the\nconcept of welfarism, showing that it contains two subcomponents. The\nfirst one is the Paretian condition that an alternative is equivalent\nto another when all individuals are indifferent between them. This\nexcludes using non-welfarist information about alternatives, but does\nnot exclude using non-welfarist information about individuals (one\nindividual may be favored because of a physical handicap). The second\none is an independence condition formulated in terms of utilities. It\nmay be called Independence of Irrelevant Utilities (Hammond 1987), and\nsays that the social ranking of any pair of alternatives must depend\nonly on utility levels at these two alternatives, so that a change in\nthe profile of utility functions which would leave the utility levels\nunchanged at the two alternatives should not alter how they are\nranked. This excludes using non-welfarist information about\nindividuals, but does not exclude using non-welfarist information\nabout alternatives (one may be preferred because it has more freedom).\nThe combination of the two conditions excludes all non-welfare\ninformation. Excellent surveys are given in d\u2019Aspremont (1985),\nd\u2019Aspremont and Gevers (2002), Bossert and Weymark (2004),\nMongin and d\u2019Aspremont (1998). In spite of the important\nclarification made by this literature, the introduction of utility\nfunctions essentially amounts to going back to old welfare economics,\nafter new welfare economics and authors such as Bergson, Samuelson and\nArrow failed to provide appealing solutions with data on consumer\ntastes only.\n\nA related issue is how the evaluation of individual well-being must be\nmade, or, equivalently, how interpersonal comparisons must be\nperformed. There is now a growing interest in exploring concrete ways\nof measuring individual well-being, as illustrated by happiness\nstudies (section 7.5 below) and the handbook published by Adler and\nFleurbaey (2016). Welfare economics traditionally relied on\n\u201cutility\u201d, and the extended informational basis of social\nchoice is mostly formulated with utilities (although the use of\nextended preference orderings is often shown to be formally\nequivalent: for instance, saying that Jones is better-off than Smith\nis equivalent to saying that it is better to be Jones than to be\nSmith, in some social state). But utility functions may be given a\nvariety of substantial interpretations, so that the same formalism may\nbe used to discuss interpersonal comparisons of resources,\nopportunities, capabilities and the like. In other words, one may\nseparate two issues: 1) whether one needs more information than\nindividual preference orderings in order to perform interpersonal\ncomparisons; 2) what kind of additional information is ethically\nrelevant (subjective utility or objective notions of opportunities,\netc.). The latter issue is directly related to philosophical\ndiscussions about how well-being should be conceived and to the\n\u201cequality of what\u201d debate. This debate, which originates\nwith Sen (1980), focuses on seeking the appropriate metric of\nadvantage that should be used by theories of justice that are\negalitarian or that give priority to the worst-off.\n\nThe former issue is still debated. Extending the informational basis\nby introducing numerical indices of well-being (or equivalent extended\norderings) is not the only conceivable extension. Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility is obtained with the condition of Independence of\nIrrelevant Alternatives, which may be logically analyzed, when the\ntheorem is reformulated with utility functions as primitive data, as\nthe combination of Independence of Irrelevant Utilities (defined\nabove) with a condition of ordinal non-comparability, saying that the\nranking of two alternatives must depend only on individuals\u2019\nordinal non-comparable preferences. Arrow\u2019s impossibility may be\navoided by relaxing the ordinal non-comparability condition, and this\nis the above-described extension of the informational basis by relying\non utility functions. But Arrow\u2019s impossibility may also be\navoided by relaxing Independence of Irrelevant Utilities only. In\nparticular, it makes sense to rank alternatives on the basis of how\nthese alternatives are considered by individuals in comparison to\nother alternatives. For instance, when considering to make a transfer\nof consumption goods from Jones to Smith, it is not enough to know\nthat Jones is against it and Smith is in favor of it (this is the only\ninformation usable under Arrow\u2019s condition). It is also relevant\nto know if both consider that Jones has a better bundle, or not, which\ninvolves considering other alternatives in which bundles are permuted,\nfor instance. In this vein, Hansson (1973) and Pazner (1979) have\nproposed to weaken Arrow\u2019s axiom so as to make the ranking of\ntwo alternatives depend on the indifference curves of individuals at\nthese two alternatives. In particular, Pazner relates this approach to\nSamuelson\u2019s (Samuelson 1977) and concludes that the\nBergson-Samuelson social welfare function can indeed be constructed\nconsistently in this way. Interpersonal comparisons may be sensibly\nmade on the sole basis of indifference curves and therefore on the\nsole basis of ordinal non-comparable preferences. This requires\nbroadening the concept of interpersonal comparisons in order to cover\nall kinds of comparisons, not just utility comparisons (see Fleurbaey\nand Hammond 2004).\n\nThe concept of informational basis itself need not be limited to\nissues of interpersonal comparisons. Many conditions of equity,\nefficiency, separability, responsibility, etc. bear on the kind and\nquantity of information that is deemed relevant for the ranking of\nalternatives. The theory of social choice gives a convenient framework\nfor a rigorous analysis of this issue.\n",
