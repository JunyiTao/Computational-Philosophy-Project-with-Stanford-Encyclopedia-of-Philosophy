    "main_text": "Objections || Libertarianism\n5.4 Libertarianism\n\nThe conflict between meritocracy and libertarianism is most obvious\nwhen one considers right-libertarian theories, like Robert\nNozick\u2019s (1974). But conflict exists, too, for left-libertarian\ntheories that have some common ground with meritocracy, like an\naffinity for equal opportunity (e.g., Otsuka\u2019s [2003]). (For a\nfull discussion, see Mulligan 2018d.)\n\nTo begin with, the meritocrat\u2019s distributive rule\u2014hire,\ncompensate, etc. on the basis of merit\u2014violates a libertarian\nright to contract. For libertarians, business owners are free to hire\nwhomever they want. They are not obligated to hire the most\nmeritorious applicant. An owner may wish to hire on the basis of race,\nor gender, or with an eye toward maximizing profits. She may wish to\nhire a friend or family member. So long as owner and employee enter\ninto their contract freely (and without fraud and the other typical\ncaveats), libertarian justice is done.\n\nA meritocratic government may enforce an alignment between\ncontribution and compensation. But that requires government\ninterventions into market exchanges which are unacceptable to the\nlibertarian. These interventions could include, for example, high top\nmarginal income tax rates and limits on executive compensation in\norder to disincentivize economic rent\n (\u00a74.3).\n\nMost libertarians also reject equal opportunity, and certainly the\ndemanding form required under meritocracy. In a meritocracy, extensive\nredistribution enables (among other things) education and healthcare\nfor the children of the poor. Coercive taxation is part and parcel of\nredistribution. Equal opportunity may also require that the government\nconfiscate and redistribute estates. All of this is problematic from\nthe libertarian perspective. (Although see Bird-Pollan 2013 and Braun\n2010 for arguments that libertarianism is compatible with estate\ntaxes.)\n\nFriedrich Hayek (1960) explicitly criticizes merit-based distribution.\nHe gives two arguments. First, he correctly observes that a\nmeritocratic economy may not be optimally efficient.\n\n\nWe do not wish people to earn a maximum of merit but to achieve a\nmaximum of usefulness at a minimum of pain and sacrifice and therefore\na minimum of merit. (1960: 96)\n\n\nHayek\u2019s point is that one way to distribute (the right way, to\nhis mind) is with an eye toward maximizing the economic surplus;\nanother way is to distribute on the basis of merit. This objection\ndoes not rest in a Nozickian freedom of contract but in\nlibertarianism\u2019s classical liberal tradition, which typically\nappeals to the consequentialist benefits of free markets.\n\nSecond, Hayek objects to the idea of a \u201cmerit czar\u201d who\nwould monitor market activity and intervene to enforce merit-based\ndistribution. That would be tyrannical. However (as Schmidtz &\nBoettke [2012 [2021]]) point out), this is not a normative objection\nto meritocracy but an objection to central planning. Indeed,\nHayek\u2019s argument can be turned around: Perhaps we should prefer\nmarket economies to central planning on the grounds that the former\ndoes a better job than the latter at recognizing merit.\n\nOne final objection, sometimes attributed to Hayek, is that\nmeritocracy is heartless. In the actual world, the objection goes,\n\u201closers\u201d can somewhat justifiably attribute their\ncondition to having grown up poor or to external factors, like racial\ndiscrimination. Those are psychologically useful excuses. But in a\nmeritocracy, in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged\non their merits, those excuses are unavailable.\n",
