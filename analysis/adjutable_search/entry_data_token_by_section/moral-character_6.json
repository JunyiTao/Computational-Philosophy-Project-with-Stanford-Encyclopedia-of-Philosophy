    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks\n3. Virtue and moral character after the Greeks\n\nSince the publication of Anscombe\u2019s \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy\u201d in 1958 (see Introduction above), it has become\nroutine to say that virtue and moral character have been neglected\ntopics in the development of western moral philosophy since the\nGreeks. Rather than thinking about what it is to flourish and live\nwell, moral philosophers, it is argued, became focused on a different\nset of notions: obligation, duty, and law.\n\nAnscombe and others have suggested how such a move might have taken\nplace. The Stoic ideas outlined above may have influenced early\nChristians such as St. Paul to develop the idea of a natural law that\napplies to all human beings. Once Christianity became more widespread,\nnatural law could be understood in terms of God\u2019s directives in\nthe Bible. Still later, after the European political revolutions of\nthe 17th and 18th centuries, there was\nintellectual room for secularized versions of the same idea to take\nhold: duty or obligation was understood in terms of obedience to moral\nlaw(s) or principles that do not come from God but are devised by\nhuman beings. Morally right action was action in accord with moral\nlaw(s) or principles. On such a view, where the central focus is on\nobedience to moral law, the virtues and moral character are secondary\nto action in accordance with law. Someone who acts rightly may develop\nstanding habits or dispositions of doing so, and these habits then\nconstitute the virtues or good character.\n\nThis section of the entry on moral character will provide a brief\nsummary of some important developments both in this\n\u201cmodern\u201d approach to moral character and in what appear to\nbe revivals of the pre-Christian Greek interest in the psychological\nfoundations of character.\n",
