    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe term \u201cecology\u201d was coined by the German zoologist,\nErnst Haeckel, in 1866 to describe the \u201ceconomies\u201d of\nliving\n forms.[1]\n The theoretical practice of ecology consists, by and\nlarge, of the construction of models of the interaction of living\nsystems with their environment (including other living\n systems).[2]\n These models are then tested in the laboratory and the\nfield. (Field-work in ecology also consists of data collection that\nneed not be inspired by any theory.)\n\n\nTheory in ecology consists of the heuristics\u2014or\nprinciples\u2014used to construct models. Unlike evolutionary theory,\necology has no generally accepted global principles such as Mendel's\n(and other) rules of genetic\n inheritance.[3]\n Contemporary ecology consists of a patchwork of sub-disciplines\nincluding population ecology, community ecology, conservation ecology,\necosystem ecology, metapopulation ecology, metacommunity ecology,\nspatial ecology, landscape ecology, physiological ecology,\nevolutionary ecology, functional ecology, and behavioral ecology. What\nis common to all these fields is the view that: (i) different biota\ninteract in ways that can be described with sufficient precision and\ngenerality to permit their scientific study; and (ii) ecological\ninteractions set the stage for evolution to occur primarily because\nthey provide the external component of an entity's fitness. The latter\naspect makes ecology a central part of\n biology.[4]\n As van Valen once put it: \u201cevolution is the control of\ndevelopment by\n ecology.\u201d[5]\n However, the creation of a unified theoretical framework for\nevolution and ecology remains the task for the future and will be of\nno further concern in this entry.\n\n\nTurning to the philosophy of ecology, beyond those interpretive and\nconceptual problems that arise because of the evolutionary context,\necology also presents interpretive and philosophical problems from its\nown unique conceptual structure and experimental practices. In this\nentry, attention will largely be restricted to population, community,\nand ecosystem ecology since these have been the focus of the little\nphilosophical attention that has so far been afforded to ecology;\nthere will also be some limited treatment of spatial ecology (in\n Section 5.2).\n However, because ecology has not received the degree of professional\nphilosophical attention it deserves\u2014while popular\n\u201cecological philosophies\u201d abound\u2014this entry\nconcentrates more on foundational and interpretive issues raised by\nthe science of ecology rather than only on what philosophers have\nwritten about the subject.\n\n\nThis entry treats experimental and theoretical work simultaneously\nwith a bias in favor of those theoretical results that are\nunambiguously testable. It was once commonplace for even ecologists to\naccuse ecological theory of\n untestability.[6]\n This criticism was not completely fair even in the past; moreover,\nboth experimental and theoretical developments during the last few\ndecades have removed much of its force. Instead, what ecology poses is\na much more philosophically intriguing set of seven problems:\n\n\n\ni. \nthe formalization indeterminacy problem: apparently\ninformally clear hypotheses can be translated into radically different\nformal counterparts. If one of these formal models turns out to be\nempirically incorrect, there is the danger that the original informal\nhypothesis will be rejected even though some other formalization may\nhave saved the phenomena;\n\n\nii. \nthe interpretation indeterminacy problem: parameters in\nwell-confirmed models can be interpreted in mutually exclusive\nways;\n\n\niii. \nthe structural uncertainty  problem: differences in\ntheoretical assumptions and techniques make enormous predictive\ndifferences;[7]\n\n\niv. \ndemarcation ambiguity problem: the classification of\nmodels presents inordinate difficulties because the boundaries\ndemarcating different ecological sub-disciplines is often unclear.\nObviously, this problem is more a concern of philosophers (and others\ninterpreting ecology) rather than of ecologists.\n\n\n\n\n Some typical examples of all these largely theoretical problems will\nbe pointed out later in this entry. Fieldwork, on which all empirically\nsound ecological theory should presumably be based, poses an additional\nproblem:\n\n\n\nv. \nthe partial observability problem: even the most basic\nparameters are often difficult to estimate accurately. One consequence\nis that many ecological models are often difficult to test in the\nfield.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, many philosophers and some ecologists have also argued that\necological experimentation is confronted with two additional\nproblems:\n\n\n\nvi. \nthe complexity problem: ecological systems are supposed\nto be not merely complicated, they are \u201ccomplex.\u201d While\nmuch has been written about an alleged new science of complexity in\nrecent years, no compelling operational distinction has yet been\npresented to distinguish complexity from complicatedness.  In general,\ncomplex systems are supposed to exhibit \u201cemergent\u201d\nproperties, that is those that, in some sense or other, resist\nreductionist explanation. The question of reductionism in ecology will\nbe briefly discussed in this entry. Beyond that, no stance will be\ntaken on the complexity versus complicatedness\n issue;[8]\n\n\nvii. \nthe uniqueness problem: ecological systems are\nsupposed to be unique both because they are contingent historical\nentities, and structurally because of their complexity. By itself being\na historical entity does not present any problem for scientific study:\nplanets and galaxies are historical entities successfully studied by\nastronomers. However, ecological systems are supposed to have histories\nthat result in highly contingent structures\u2014part of their\ncomplexity\u2014that make them special.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last two problems often preclude the use of laboratory experiments\nand model systems as a guide to what should happen in the\nfield. Moreover, according to skeptics, they are an impediment to the\nreplication of field experiments: the extent to which this is a\nserious obstacle to ecological experimentation remains\ncontroversial. These two problems will lurk in the background of all\nthe discussions here.\n\n\nThere are also many other general philosophical problems about science\nthat also occur in the ecological context, for instance, the role of\nidealizations, models, and so on. But ecology does not seem to make\nany unique contribution to these problems\u2014they will be ignored\nhere in the interest of focusing on ecology per se.  The aim\nof this entry is to describe\u2014in broad terms\u2014the type of\nphilosophical questions raised by different areas of ecology so as to\nencourage further philosophical work. No general conclusions will be\ndrawn from the various cases because none seem feasible at\npresent.\n",
