    "main_text": "The Debate Between the \u2018Old\u2019 and the \u2018New\u2019 || Liberal Theories of Social Justice\n2.3 Liberal Theories of Social Justice\n\nOne consequence of Rawls\u2019s great work, A Theory of\nJustice (1999 [first published in 1971]) is that the \u2018new\nliberalism\u2019 has become focused on developing a theory of social\njustice. Since the 1960s when Rawls began to publish the elements of\nhis emerging theory, liberal political philosophers have analyzed, and\ndisputed, his famous \u2018difference principle\u2019 according to\nwhich a just basic structure of society arranges social and economic\ninequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least\nwell off representative group (1999b:266). For Rawls, the default is\nnot liberty but rather an equal distribution of (basically) income and\nwealth; only inequalities that best enhance the long-term prospects of\nthe least advantaged are just. As Rawls sees it, the difference\nprinciple constitutes a public recognition of the principle of\nreciprocity: the basic structure is to be arranged such that no social\ngroup advances at the cost of another (2001: 122\u201324). Many\nfollowers of Rawls have focused less on the ideal of reciprocity than\non the commitment to equality (Dworkin, 2000). Indeed, what was\npreviously called \u2018welfare state\u2019 liberalism is now often\ndescribed as liberal egalitarianism. However, see Jan Narveson\u2019s\nessay on Hobbes\u2019s seeming defense of the welfare state (in\nCourtland 2018) for historical reflections on the difference.\n\nAnd in one way that is especially appropriate: in his later work Rawls\ninsists that welfare-state capitalism does not constitute a just basic\nstructure (2001: 137\u201338). If some version of capitalism is to be\njust it must be a \u2018property owning democracy\u2019 with a wide\ndiffusion of ownership; a market socialist regime, in Rawls\u2019s\nview, is more just than welfare-state capitalism (2001: 135-38). Not\ntoo surprisingly, classical liberals such as Hayek (1976) insist that\nthe contemporary liberal fixation on \u2018the mirage of social\njustice\u2019 leads modern liberals to ignore the extent to which, as\na matter of historical observation, freedom depends on a decentralized\nmarket based on private property, the overall results of which are\nunpredictable.\n\nThus, Robert Nozick (1974: 160ff) famously classifies Rawls\u2019s\ndifference principle as patterned but not historical: prescribing a\ndistribution while putting no moral weight on who produced the goods\nbeing distributed. One stark difference that emerges from this is that\nRawlsian liberalism\u2019s theory of justice is a theory about how to\ndistribute the pie while old liberalism\u2019s theory of justice is a\ntheory about how to treat bakers (Schmidtz, 2022).\n\nThe problem with patterned principles is that, in Nozick\u2019s\nwords, liberty upsets patterns. \u201cNo end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continuously\nrealized without continuous interference with people\u2019s\nlives\u201d (1974: 163). To illustrate, Nozick asks you to imagine\nthat society achieves a pattern of perfect justice by the lights of\nwhatever principle you prefer. Then someone offers Wilt Chamberlain a\ndollar for the privilege of watching Wilt play basketball. Before we\nknow it, thousands of people are paying Wilt a dollar each, every time\nWilt puts on a show. Wilt gets rich. The distribution is no longer\nequal, and no one complains. Nozick\u2019s question: If justice is a\npattern, achievable at a given moment, what happens if you achieve\nperfection? Must you then prohibit everything\u2014no further\nconsuming, creating, trading, or even giving\u2014so as not\nto upset the perfect pattern? Notice: Nozick neither argues nor\npresumes people can do whatever they want with their property. Nozick,\nrecalling the focus on connecting property rights to liberty that\nanimated liberalism in its classical form, notes that if there is\nanything at all people can do, even if the only thing they\nare free to do is give a coin to an entertainer, then even that\ntiniest of liberties will, over time, disturb the favored pattern.\nNozick is right that if we focus on time slices, we focus on isolated\nmoments, and take moments too seriously, when what matters is not the\npattern of holdings at a moment but the pattern of how people treat\neach other over time. Even tiny liberties must upset the pattern of a\nstatic moment. By the same token, however, there is no reason why\nliberty must upset an ongoing pattern of fair treatment. A moral\nprinciple forbidding racial discrimination, for example, prescribes no\nparticular end-state. Such a principle is what Nozick calls weakly\npatterned, sensitive to history as well as to pattern, and prescribing\nan ideal of how people should be treated without prescribing an\nend-state distribution. It affects the pattern without\nprescribing a pattern. And if a principle forbidding racial\ndiscrimination works its way into a society via cultural progress\nrather than legal intervention, it need not involve any interference\nwhatsoever. So, although Nozick sometimes speaks as if his critique\napplies to all patterns, we should take seriously his concession that\n\u201cweak\u201d patterns are compatible with liberty. Some may\npromote liberty, depending on how they are introduced and maintained.\nSee Schmidtz (2006: chap.6). For work by modern liberals that\nresonates with Nozick\u2019s dissection of the dimensions of equality\nthat plausibly can count as liberal, see also Anderson (1999), Young\n(1990), and Sen (1992).\n\nAccordingly, even granting to Nozick that time-slice principles\nlicense immense, constant, intolerable interference with everyday\nlife, there is some reason to doubt that Rawls intended to embrace any\nsuch view. In his first article, Rawls said, \u201cwe cannot\ndetermine the justness of a situation by examining it at a single\nmoment\u201d (1951: 191) Years later, Rawls added, \u201cIt is a\nmistake to focus attention on the varying relative positions of\nindividuals and to require that every change, considered as a single\ntransaction viewed in isolation, be in itself just. It is the\narrangement of the basic structure which is to be judged, and judged\nfrom a general point of view\u201d (1999b: 76). Thus, to Rawls, basic\nstructure\u2019s job is not to make every transaction work to the\nworking class\u2019s advantage, let alone to the advantage of each\nmember of the class. Rawls was more realistic than that. Instead, it\nis the trend of a whole society over time that is supposed to benefit\nthe working class as a class. To be sure, Rawls was a kind of\negalitarian, but the pattern Rawls meant to endorse was a pattern of\nequal status, applying not so much to a distribution as to an ongoing\nrelationship. This is not to say that Nozick\u2019s critique had no\npoint. Nozick showed what an alternative theory might look like,\nportraying Wilt Chamberlain as a separate person in a more robust\nsense (unencumbered by nebulous debts to society) than Rawls could\ncountenance. To Nozick, Wilt\u2019s advantages are not what Wilt\nfinds on the table; Wilt\u2019s advantages are what Wilt\nbrings to the table. And respecting what Wilt brings to the\ntable is the exact essence of respecting him as a separate person. In\npart due to Nozick, today\u2019s egalitarians now acknowledge that\nany equality worthy of aspiration will focus less on justice as a\nproperty of a time-slice distribution and more on how people are\ntreated: how they are rewarded for their contributions and\nenabled over time to make contributions worth rewarding.\n(Schmidtz, 2006).\n",
