    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors || Arguments Against Gamete Donor Parenthood\n1.2 Arguments Against Gamete Donor Parenthood\n\nThose who argue that gamete donation does not result in parental\nresponsibilities find fault with causal accounts of parenthood. One\nprominent move is the \u2018too many parents\u2019 objection. The\ncore of this objection is the claim that causal theorists have no\nprincipled way to distinguish members of the causal chain who acquire\nparental responsibilities from those who ought not be ascribed such\nresponsibilities. As a result, causal accounts ascribe parenthood to\ntoo many people. \n\nFor instance, Tim Bayne (2003) argues that both Benatar and Nelson are\ncommitted to including biological grandparents and great grandparents\netc. amongst those who acquire parental responsibilities for\ndonor-conceived children. Bayne thinks Benatar is committed to this\nconclusion because subsequent generations are the result of an\nindividuals\u2019 exercise of reproductive autonomy. He thinks that\nNelson is committed to this conclusion because biological grandparents\nand great grandparents are necessary causes of their donor-conceived\nchildren, and so satisfy Nelson\u2019s criteria for parenthood.\n\nIt is however unclear whether Bayne\u2019s criticism is apt.\nNelson\u2019s account does rely on causal proximity, but he\nexplicitly rejects the view that merely being a necessary part of a\ncausal chain that results in the creation of a child is sufficient for\nparenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). The actions of intervening agents\nplausibly restricts the scope of individuals who are causally\nproximate. \n\nAnd Benatar\u2019s view does not ascribe obligations for all the\ndownstream consequences of one\u2019s exercise of reproductive\nautonomy. Indeed, autonomous control over the use of particular\ngametes is an important feature of Benatar\u2019s account.\nGrandparents and great grandparents do not normally possess autonomous\ncontrol over the use of their offspring\u2019s gametes, and so would\nnot normally be parents on this view. \n\nJason Hanna (2019) advances a better version of the objection. Hanna\nargues that medical professionals do exercise control over gametes and\nare proximate causes of the children created through their use. After\nall, medical professionals often perform the critical steps necessary\nfor conception. Indeed, in many cases medical professionals are more\ncausally proximate and exercise more control over the creation of\nchildren than gamete donors. Consistency thus demands that at least\nsome of the medical professionals involved in gamete donation be\nascribed parenthood. According to Hanna, the most promising way for\ncausal theorists to escape this reductio is to accept that causal\nresponsibilities do not extend to cases in which: (a) one individual\nacts for the sake of another in an employee/employer type relationship\nand (b) that individual has reasonable assurances that the employer\nwill ensure that any obligations arising from their actions will be\nfulfilled. This move has intuitive appeal. We do not think that an\nemployee whose assigned task produces pollutants has a special\nresponsibility to clean up those pollutants if her employer fails to\ndo so as promised. Hanna notes that this limit on the scope of causal\nresponsibility insulates gamete donors from weighty obligations\nbecause gamete donors provide services for commissioning parents in\nsomething like an employee/employer relationship. \n\nElizabeth Brake advances another challenge to causal views of\nparenthood. Brake (2005, 2010) argues that we are mistaken to think\nthat being causally involved in creating offspring suffices for\nacquiring parental responsibilities. According to Brake, many of the\nsocial practices that causal theorists appeal to, like child\nmaintenance obligations in accidental pregnancy cases, are in fact\nmistaken. Brake argues that instead, we ought to be voluntarists about\nparenthood. This does mean that those who cause children to exist are\nfree from obligations altogether. Brake argues that we ought to\ndistinguish between what she calls \u2018procreative costs\u2019 and\nthe more demanding obligations of parenthood. While causal actors may\nbe responsible for procreative costs, they certainly do not have\nparental responsibilities. More will be said about Brake\u2019s\nprocreative costs in\n section 1.4\n\n",
