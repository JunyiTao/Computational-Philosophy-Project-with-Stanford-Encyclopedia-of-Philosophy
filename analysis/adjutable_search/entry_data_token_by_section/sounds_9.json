    "main_text": "Distal Theories of Sounds || Sounds as Located Events\n3.2 Sounds as Located Events\n\nIn this and the following section, we shall present two Event Theories\nof sounds, for which we use two distinct labels. An earlier one, The\nLocated Event Theory, was defended by Casati and Dokic (1994). It has\nbeen rejoined by Pasnau (2009) and extended to the field of sonic art\nby Roden (2010). A second, more recent version, the Relational Event\nTheory, has received an articulated defense by O\u2019Callaghan\n(2007, 2010a). The two accounts agree on categorizing sounds as\nevents, that is, located temporal particulars, and diverge on some\nspecifics of the class of particulars that are admitted to be sounds.\nThe Relational Event Theory makes sounds depend upon the existence of\na medium that carries information about them. In this sense, only a\nsubclass of situations involving sounds for the Located Event Theory\nare situations involving sounds for the Relational Event Theory.\n3.2.1 The located event theory\n\nAccording to the Located Event Theory, sounds are events happening to\nmaterial objects. They are located at their source, and are identical\nwith, or at least supervene on, vibration processes in the source. On\nthis view (Casati & Dokic 1994), auditory perception of sounds\nrequires a medium which transmits information from the vibrating\nobject to the ears; however, the transmitting medium is not essential\nto the existence of sounds. One can see at once the fit of this view\nwith those features of sound which were sources of trouble in the\ncases discussed above when criticizing proximal and medial\ntheories.\n\nVibration processes in the sounding object do not move any more\nthan sounds appear to.\nThey do not propagate from the object, as much as sounds do not\nappear to.\nDistal volume is constant: Like sounds, and unlike sound waves in\nthe ambient medium, the intensity of vibration processes can remain\nthe same through a period of time, even if one distances oneself from\nthe source and hence hears them as less loud.\nFinally, and most importantly, tuning-forks and other sounding\nobjects can be taken as continuing to vibrate irrespective of their\nbeing or not being immersed in a vibrating medium. One does not create\nsounds by surrounding vibrating objects with a medium\u2014one simply\nreveals them.\n\n\nA by-product of the Located Event Theory is that it makes plain what\ncategory sounds belong to, as opposed to views that construe sounds\ngenerically as qualities. Sounds are either instantaneous events or\ntemporally extended processes. They start and cease. They are\nintrinsically temporal entities.\n\nAnother feature of the Located Event Theory is that it provides us\nwith a clear example of the compatibility of a theory of non-direct\nperception, according to which we hear external events by hearing\ntheir perceptual deputies, with a non-phenomenalistic theory,\naccording to which perceptual deputies are not mental items. The case\nof sound perception shows that there can be indirect perception\nwithout mental deputies. We hear coaches and telephones by hearing\ntheir sounds, i.e., by hearing some (cluster of) vibratory processes\nor events occurring in those objects. Sounds are both physical events\nand perceptual deputies.\n3.2.2 Objections to the located event theory\n\nWe shall now briefly discuss some objections to the identification\nproposed by the Located Event Theory, as they allow us to highlight\ncertain metaphysically interesting features of sounds.\nImprecise Location and Echoes\n\nThe first objection concerns sound location. Even if sounds are heard\nas located, it could be held that location is often imprecise or even\nerroneous, this in turn depending on\u2014and being explained\nby\u2014the nature of sound waves. Here is a relatively common echo\nexample. Suppose you walk under the rain, your umbrella open. At some\npoint you enter a building with a glass roof. Rain drops on the roof,\nand no longer on your umbrella. The umbrella attenuates the noise from\nthe roof, which is reflected by the ground. You hear the raindrops as\nif they were below you, and not above you. Erroneous location is here\nexplained by the path of sound waves.\n\nThe temptation of identifying sounds with sound waves can arise\nbecause of this fact: that sounds can be mislocated in audition. They\ncan be heard as located in a region which is larger than, or removed\nfrom, the one occupied by a sounding object, a region which it is\nreasonable to take as being occupied by sound waves.\n\nThis example poses no particular threat to the distal view. Consider\nagain a visual analogy. Seeing an object in a mirror is not seeing\nanother, immaterial object located in an immaterial space beyond the\nmirror-plane. There is no such immaterial object; we see one and the\nonly material object, and we locate it incorrectly as if it was behind\nthe mirror.\n\nThe mirror sophism should be credited to Hobbes\u2019\nLeviathan (1651: I, I; cf. Casati & Dokic 1994:\n49\u201351), which explicitly linked perception in a mirror and\nperception of echoes:\n\n\nThe cause of sense, is the external body, or object, which presseth\nthe organ proper to each sense, either immediately, as in the taste\nand touch; or mediately, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling; which\npressure, by the mediation of the nerves, and other strings and\nmembranes of the body, continued inwards to the brain and hearth,\ncauseth there a resistance, or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the\nearth to deliver itself, which endeavour, because outward, seemeth to\nbe some matter without. And this seeming, or fancy, is that which men\ncall sense; and consisteth, as to the eye, in a light, or colour\nfigured; to the ear, in a sound\u2026if those colours and sounds\nwere in the bodies, or objects that cause them, they could not severed\nby them, as by glasses, and in echoes by reflection, we see they are;\nwhere we know the thing we see is in one place, the appearance in\nanother.\n\n\nThe deviant paths of sound waves (in echoes) is responsible for the\nperceptual difficulty in locating sounds, much as the deviant path of\nlight rays (in mirrors) is responsible for the analogous difficulty\nfor visible objects (Casati & Dokic 1994; see also\nO\u2019Callaghan 2007 for a lengthy discussion of echoes, and Fowler\n2013 for arguments against O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view). But it is\nnot the case that sound waves are sounds just because of their\nresponsibility. From the fact that a subject hears something as\nimperfectly located, it does not follow that she hears something which\nis imperfectly located.\nDoppler Effect\n\nThe second objection concerns typical acoustical effects, like the\nDoppler effect, which are perfectly accounted for by appealing to\n(medial) sound waves. The Doppler effect is a shift in frequency of\nthe sound heard by an observer who moves relative to the sound source.\nAs waves in the direction of movement are compressed, and waves in the\nopposite direction are expanded, the frequency drops dramatically when\nthe hearer and the source go past each other. Such explanations of the\nDoppler effect are harmless for a distal account. The Doppler effect\nis dependent on something going on in the medium, but this should not\nallow one to conclude that what we hear are sound waves in the medium.\nThe situation can be described as follows in a way that is relatively\nuncommitting: When we hear sounds as undergoing the Doppler effect, we\ndo not hear anything different from a vibration process in a sounding\nobject, a process which is heard in a sort of perspectival shortening\nbecause the movement of the sounding object causes, among other\nthings, the Doppler effect.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the objection could be turned on its head. On a\ntrain passing by, a trumpet player is delivering a concert. According\nto the distal view, the melody does not change, it is just perceived\nas changing. If we repeated the experience a number of times, we would\nfind it suspect that the melody\u2019s key drops only when the train\npasses by. Surely, we would infer, there is something wrong with the\nmedium that blocks our perception of the true melody. And surely the\ntrain passengers would disconfirm our impression: they do not hear any\nkey drop. The medial theory here indeed predicts that there are two\nmelodies, the one that we hear from the platform, and the one the\npassengers hear.\nProperties of Sounds\n\nA third objection is as follows. \n\n\nSounds are phenomenologically high or low (they have high or low\npitch). But processes in objects cannot be high or low. Therefore\nsounds are not processes in objects. \n\n\nThis can be answered in the following way. Notice first that sound\nwaves fare no better on this objection\u2014they cannot literally be\nsaid to be high or low. But a more substantial answer is available.\nWhat one needs is a way of systematically correlating predicates like\n\u201c\u2026is high\u201d, \u201c\u2026is higher\nthan\u2026\u201d to processes in sounding objects. It is likely\nthat a high sound corresponds to a quickly vibrating process, and so\nforth.\nThe Causal Link\n\nA fourth objection has it that \n\n\nsurely there are sound waves in the ambient medium, otherwise no\ncausal link could be set between the sounding object and our\nperception of the latter. \n\n\nAnd such sound waves can certainly be measured and physically\ndescribed. Now there is no point in denying that there are sound waves\nin the ambient medium: of course there are, and they are causally\nresponsible for our aural perceptions when these are perceptions of\nanything at all. A defender of the Located Event Theory ought to just\ncontend that such sound waves are not what we hear.\n\nConsider an analogy we discussed before. Light is causally responsible\nfor your perception of an object\u2019s surface. But this does not\nmake you see the light when you see the surface. We can see\nluminescent sources, but never light in itself: in order to be seen,\nlight should have to emit light carrying information about it.\nSpace Filling Sounds?\n\nFinally, another objection concerns the alleged meaningful use of\nexpressions such \u201cthe sound fills the room\u201d, \u201csounds\nfill the room\u201d. It seems that what makes these sentences true is\nbest found in the spreading of sound waves, which could actually be\neverywhere in the room. But one should not be too much impressed by\nidioms. \u201cThe sound fills the room\u201d does not describe any\nphenomenological fact which is different from the fact that the sound\nis audible from any place in the room (in this respect sounds are\nunlike fog, which can literally be seen to fill a room).\n\nHowever, this point deserves closer attention. For sometimes sounds do\nseem to fill space. Thunders seem to. This is a case in which the only\nvibrating entity is the medium. Nonetheless this case too can be\naccommodated by the Located Event Theory: what we hear is sudden\nheating of air due to the electric discharge, whose impact is\nconfusedly propagated by the medium. A portion of air (the portion\nthat is suddenly heated up) is the vibrating object and another\nportion is the transmitting medium.\n3.2.3 The relational event theory\n\nAccording to the Relational Event Theory, sounds are events which\ninvolve both the source and the surrounding medium. They are\nrelational rather than \u201cmonadic\u201d events. (The distinction\nbetween monadic and relational events is not to be taken as cast in\niron, since the latter can be reduced to the former by making the\nmereological sum of sources and surrounding medium the subject of\nsounds.) O\u2019Callaghan (2002, 2007) has developed such a view at\nsome length. He notes that the wave conception of sounds is not the\nonly possible interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s remarks about sounds\nin On the Soul. Aristotle writes that \u201ceverything that\nmakes a sound does so by the impact of something against something\nelse, across a space filled with air\u201d (De Anima II.8\n420b15). On O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view, what Aristotle might have\nmeant is that the sound itself is not a movement of the air, it is\nrather the event in which a vibrating object disturbs a surrounding\nmedium and sets it \u201cmoving\u201d. Waves in the medium are not\nthe sounds themselves, but rather the effects of sounds. According to\nthe Relational Event Theory, sounds are \u201cdisturbings\u201d of a\nmedium, hence depend existentially on a medium that is disturbed and\nthat will transmit information to a listener. This account differs\nfrom the Located Event Theory insofar as the latter allows for sounds\nthat exist in a vacuum, and thus distinguishes between a medium that\nhosts the vibration and a medium that transmits the vibration.\n\nThe Relational Event Theory shares with medial theories an endorsement\nof Berkeley\u2019s argument that sounds do not exist in a vacuum. It\nis, in point of fact, a hybrid theory (O\u2019Callaghan 2007: 55),\nsharing with medial theories the tenet of the indispensability of a\nmedium to the existence of a sound.\n\nAn argument against the Relational Event Theory capitalizes upon the\nfact that we have the conceptual resources to distinguish between not\nhearing a sound because the sounding object is no longer resonating\nand not hearing it because we do not have informational access to the\nsounding object anymore. The Relational Event theory faces the risk of\ncollapsing unto a medial position.\n\nTo develop this line of thought and make it vivid, imagine a vacuum\njar which has the property of immediately creating a vacuum upon\nclosing the lid, and of immediately recalling air upon opening the\nlid. Take now a sounding object like a tuning fork at 440Hz and have\nit vibrate, supposing that the vibration fades and becomes inaudible\nafter 10 seconds. What you hear is an A that becomes feebler and\nfeebler until it disappears. Now, place the tuning fork inside the\njar, have it vibrate as before, and repeatedly open-and-close the lid\nof the jar, say once in a bit less than a second. What do you hear?\nYou may have the feeling that a few short sounds, each feebler than\nthe preceding one, come into existence and pass away. But you may as\nwell have the impression of a sound that is revealed by the\nopening and closing of the jar. Indeed, the fading of the sound should\nbe audible from each \u201cwindow\u201d to the next, implying that\nthere is a single sound that fades. If sounds were either sound waves\nin the medium surrounding the object, or items dependent on the medium\nas per the Relational Event Theory, we would be forced to admit that\nthe tuning-fork started and ceased to sound; because the relevant\nsound waves would not be present in the surrounding medium. Only the\nfirst impression, that of a series of short sounds, would be accounted\nfor. But the second impression, that of a continuous underlying sound\nthat is revealed, is supported too. A visual analogue of this would be\nthe perception of an object in the dark, on which light is shed at\nintervals. We would not have the impression that the object gets its\ncolors and then loses them at intervals.\n\nAn advantage of the Relational Event Theory over the Located Event\nTheory is that the former provides a criterion for specifying which\namong vibratory events at a source are sounds, namely, those that\ncreate medial disturbances that are (or can be) heard. The Located\nEvent Theorist can, on the one hand, observe that the minimal\nrequirement of a metaphysics of sounds is to specify which type of\nentities are sounds, and not, more specifically, which, among entities\nof that type, are sounds. Thus she would claim that sounds are events\nat a source, without caring to discuss whether some events at a source\nare not sounds. On the other hand, she can observe that too much\nfine-grained a classification would create a problem with those events\nthat share with sounds all interesting metaphysical properties except\nfor the property of being audible; a problem which, incidentally,\naffects a number of physicalist reductions of sounds.\n3.2.4 Discussing the located event theory and the relational event theory\nRelation between sound and sound source\n\nThe Relational Event Theory and the Located Event Theory differ\nconcerning the way in which they account for the audible relationship\nbetween sound and sound source. A manner of characterizing this\nrelation within the Relational Event Theory is the part-whole\nrelationship, according to which sounds are heard as the constituent\nparts of wholes that are everyday audible events (O\u2019Callaghan\n2011a, 2011b). This is a Mereological View, which presupposes a\ndistinction between sound and the broad event which sound is part of.\nThe parthood relationship explains a striking and quite ambiguous\naspect of audition, namely, the fact for which we hear the sound and\nits source as two different events but, at the same time, we hear them\nas not wholly distinct.\n\nThe advantages of the Mereological View over both the Property\nInstantiation view\u2014which claims that sound is heard as a\nproperty of the sounding object\u2014and the Causal View\u2014for\nwhich sound is heard as the effect of its source (O\u2019Callaghan\n2011a: 383 and following)\u2014are that:\n\nIt explains why we often perceive sound as part of a multipartite\noccurrence which might also involve inaudible features. For\nO\u2019Callaghan, there might be features of the event source that\nare not features of sound, and we may hear the sound without\nperceiving the features of the event source. For instance, the\nhappening of \u201cthe stomping of the foot\u201d (2011a: 396)\nincludes non-audible features like a foot stomping or a release of\nenergy, but also something that we hear, a sound.\nMereology explains the intuitive fact that sounds may usually seem\nto be heard as bound or unified with their\nsources.\nParthood explains the classical Berkeleyan account of auditory\nperception for which sound sources are perceived by virtue of the\nperception of the sounds they make.\n\n\nThe Located Event Theory proposes a metaphysical Ockhamization of the\nMereological View (Casati, Di Bona, & Dokic 2013), which cleans\nthe metaphysical landscape up from entities which are not necessary.\nAs a starting point, it is useful to distinguish between two\ncomponents of sound sources: thing sources (such as keys or\nmusical instruments) and event sources (such as collisions or\nvibratory events at the sounding object) (2013: 462). The Located\nEvent Theory maintains an Identity View for which sound, instead of\nbeing a proper part of a distinct event that is its source, is\nidentical with the event source. That is, the collision we hear\nis the sound we hear. The Identity View appears to simplify\nthe metaphysical landscape depicted by the Mereological View (2013:\n463). The metaphysical claim which grounds the Identity View is\nsupported by considerations about the phenomenology of audition. These\nconsiderations suggests that we do not commonly hear sounds as part of\nlarger events\u2014at least when, with \u201clarger events\u201d,\nwe refer to event sources. We hear sounds as a unified entity, and not\nas parts of larger events. The biggest price the Identity View has to\npay is for some ordinary language statements to which we have to\nrenounce, meaning that instead of saying \u201cI heard the bang\n(produced by/and) the collision\u201d, it would be more appropriate\nto say that we heard the collision. This is a disadvantage of the\ntheory which is acceptable, though, if the advantage is to propose a\nplausible theory of sound (2013: 465).\n\nAs for the advantages that the Mereological View has over the Property\nView and the Causal View, the Identity View can account for them as\nwell. One of the advantages of the Mereological View is that it\njustifies the supposedly different properties that we usually\nattribute to sounds and to sound sources. The Identity View responds\nto this by arguing that:\n\nThese differences in the attributable properties are only\napparent. We are tempted to introduce this distinction since it seems\nthat we ascribe properties to the source and not to sound because of\nthe non-auditory character of these non-audible properties. But the\nIdentity View claims that from the fact that some features\u2014such\nas the release of energy, vibrations, a painful sensation\u2014are\nperceivable through other sense modalities, it does not follow that\nsuch properties are not features of sounds themselves (2013: 464).\nMoreover, the extra-properties, if any, can be perfectly ascribed to\nthe thing source.\n The sense of unification we experience when we hear bangs and\ncollisions can perfectly be explained in terms of identity.\n Then Mereological View would explain the Berkeleyan claim for\nwhich we hear the source by virtue of hearing the sound since one\nperceives a whole by virtue of perceiving its parts. The Identity View\nas well accounts for the Berkeleyan claim since it states that,\nbecause the immediate object of auditory perception is just the event\nthat is the sound, then, the latter is the thing source we perceive\nindirectly by virtue of hearing a sound.\n\n\nThe Identity View and the Mereological View have an equal explanatory\ncapacity, but the Identity View, in addition to the metaphysical\nreduction, seems to untangle the ambiguity of hearing sound and sound\nsources as two different events and, at the same time, of hearing them\nas not wholly distinct. This ambiguity evaporates if we\nidentify sound with the event source.\n\nDifferent options concerning the relationship between sound and sound\nsources and how we perceive them have been proposed. According to\nMatthen (2010) both sounds (and sound composites like melodies,\nharmonies or sequences of phonemes) and sound sources can be heard\ndirectly. Leddington supports the Heideggerian view of hearing, for\nwhich we \u201chear sound sources directly, in hearing the sounds\nthey make\u2014not, \u00e0 la Berkeley, merely in virtue\nof hearing those sounds\u201d (2014: 340). Nudds, instead, suggests\nthat when listening to sounds we hear them as apparently being\nproduced by the same source (2010a, 2010b). He suggests that\nwe can also perceive the production of sound bi-modally: by\nsimultaneously listening to and seeing the cause of sound (2001).\n\nNevertheless, issues about the relationship between sound and the\nthing source (namely, sound and the material object which produces it)\nand about how we hear both the objects that produce sounds, and the\nrelation between objects and sounds still have to be fully worked out\nwithin both views. As a starting point to develop an account on the\nperception of sound sources or, at least, of some aspects of the thing\nsource, Di Bona (2017) proposes an argument for the perception of a\nspecific characteristic of human voices. She offers an account of how\na certain feature of the sound source when the source is the human\nvoice is perceivable. Di Bona focuses on gender and engages with the\ndebate on the admissible content of auditory experience, which has\nbeen mostly developed within the field of visual perception, and\nargues for a \u201crich\u201d view of the auditory experience. This\nview is defended by means of the method of contrast applied to a case\nof auditory adaptation to human voices. The idea is that we hear not\nonly the low-level auditory properties of pitch, timbre, and loudness\nbut also the high-level property of gender, that is, the property\ncommonly referred to as being a female voice or a male voice. This\nhigh-level property displays adaptational effects and, given that\ndisplaying these effects for a property is a clear mark that this\nproperty is perceivable, then we can conclude we hear gender\nproperties instantiated by human voices. O\u2019Callaghan (2011b)\nalso engages with the debate on the admissible content of auditory\nperception, endorsing a more restricted view on the content of\naudition. He focuses on speech perception and argues that we do not\nhear the semantic properties of voices (which can also be seen as\nproperties of sound sources, of voices) since what is auditory\nperceivable are, instead, the phonological properties.\nSome objections to both event theories\n\nSoteriou (2018) claims that both versions of the event theory are too\nstrict about what they count as sounds: the Located Event Theory\ncounts as sounds only monadic events happening at material objects;\nthe Relational Event Theory, instead, admits only relational events\nthat are bearers of acoustic properties. Soteriou challenges the\nassumption that sounds are one kind of thing and suggests that the\nsounds we hear are both pure audibilia (such as the barking\nof a dog), which are events or act-types bearing acoustic properties\nthat can also be disconnected from their material causes and cannot\nexist in a vacuum, and events or act-types that can lack acoustic\nproperties (footsteps), which are perceivable by means of modalities\nthat are different from audition, and can exist in a vacuum.\nSoteriou\u2019s \u201csimple view\u201d or \u201ccatholic\nview\u201d (2018: 48) moves from the necessity of rejecting the idea\nof considering the experiences of echoes and recorded sounds as\nillusory experiences or distortion of space and time, which is how he\nthinks both event theories regard them in order to be consistent. The\nevent theories classify the experiences of echoes and recorded sounds\nas illusory for the sake of preserving the idea that, usually, sounds\nare the bearers of acoustic properties located where we experience\nthem to be located, namely distally. That is because if sound is\nsomething located at its own source and the echo seems to be a sound\nnot perceived at its source, then we are hallucinating a sound. When\nhearing recorded sound, we experience and illusion since the bearer of\nthe acoustic properties that we actually hear to be distally located\nis distinct from the \u201coriginal\u201d bearer of acoustic\nproperties (2018: 44). Soteriou suggests that when hearing echoes or\nrecorded sounds, even though we do not hear event-like individuals\ndistally located, we do not have an illusory experience since what we\nhear are pure audibilia. Soteriou\u2019s proposal has the\nmerit of broadening up the range of the audible, but it might\nencounter some worries because of the non-univocal characterization of\nwhat sounds are. For example, a challenge to this view is to explain,\non the one hand, how pure audibila are connected to the\nphysical causes and, on the other hand, how collisions or non-audible\nact-types \u201cacquire\u201d acoustic properties that make them\naudible.\n\nNudds (2018) challenges both event theories by virtue of \u201cthe\nargument from the medium\u201d which is elaborated to show that\nenvironmental events are not the bearers of acoustic features (2018:\n54). The main premise of the argument, the existence premise, states\nthat we can hear a sound without the occurrence of an environmental\nevent. This premise can be used against both event theories, which\nclaim that sounds are either identical to environmental events or to\nparts of such events (2018: 67). Nudds imagines two situations, S1 and\nS2. In S1 there is a disturbance of the medium and an environmental\nevent, such as a collision; S2 is just like S1 except for the fact\nthat the disturbance of the medium takes place without that there is\nan environmental event. In both situations you hear a sound, but in S2\nthere is not any environmental event; therefore, it is possible to\nhave a sound and its acoustic features without the happening of an\nenvironmental event. In order to check whether this conclusion is\ntrue, Nudds elaborates an analogous case within vision and concludes\nthat while there are two different arguments to show that the premise\nis false in vision, none of them apply also to the auditory case. He\nasks to imagine to have the situation S3 in which you see a red cube,\nand the situation S4 in which we keep the same pattern of light which\ndetermine the appearance of a red cube in S3, except for the fact that\nthere is no red cube. The arguments to show that the premise is false\nin the visual case are as follows.\n\n(1) The premise is false since you cannot see a red cube without that\nthere is something, a real thing, that is the bearer of the visual\nfeatures that usually a red cube has. When it seems to you that you\nare seeing a red cube without that there actually is a red cube, it is\nbecause you are hallucinating it: there is nothing that instantiates\nthe visual features of a real red cube. Can we apply the same\nreasoning to audition in order to claim that the premise is false\nconcerning auditory appearances too? When hearing a sound in S2, you\ndo not hallucinate the sound of a collision since you can perfectly\nhear a sound without that there is a collision, as when listening to\nmusic played by loudspeakers. Therefore, there is still something that\nis the bearer of auditory qualities that you hear in S2 which can be\nproduced, for example, by loudspeakers and you are clearly not having\na hallucination (Nudds 2018: 56). That is to say that while it seems\nthat, in the visual case, we hallucinate, in the auditory case we are\nclearly hearing a sound, and we can conclude that the premise is true\nin audition. Nudds\u2019 conclusion can be challenged by the event\nview since one can say that an environmental event is still present in\nS2, that is, the event involved in the mechanics responsible for the\nfunctioning of the loudspeaker. Therefore, the premise is false in the\nauditory case as well, but for a different reason: not because you are\nhallucinating a sound, but because the loudspeaker case does not show\nthat you hear sound in the absence of an environmental event.\n\n(2) Nudds (2018: 56) adds that the falsity of the existence premise in\nthe visual case can be showed also by imagining to see a hologram in\nS4. If what you see when it seems to you that you see a red cube is a\nhologram of a red cube\u2014that is, you have the experience of\nseeing something that is indistinguishable from seeing a real red\ncube\u2014you don\u2019t literally see the object, but you do not\nhallucinate it as well. When seeing a hologram of a red cube, you see\nsomething which is the bearer of visual qualities without that the\nactual object having these visual features is present. Starting from\nMartin\u2019s (2012) discussion of visual images, according to which\na hologram is the appearance of an object \u201cin the absence of any\nobject which might possess it\u201d (2012: 339), Nudds concludes that\na hologram presents the appearance of something that it does not\ninstantiate. Therefore, the existence premise is false not because you\nliterally see nothing in S4, as usually happens in hallucinations, but\nbecause what you see is not the bearer of visual features; and yet it\nis indistinguishable from a real red cube. Is there a similar case in\naudition which can be used in order to show that the existence premise\nis false? Given that auditory holograms do not seem to exist, namely,\n\u201csomething that presents the acoustic appearance of a\nsound-producing event, an appearance it does not itself\ninstantiate\u201d (2018: 58), it is difficult to claim that the\nexistence premise is false in audition for the same reasons for which\nit is false in vision; therefore, Nudds concludes that the existence\npremise is true: environmental events are not the bearers of acoustic\nfeatures. This conclusion is based on the debatable notions of\nauditory hologram and auditory \u201cimage\u201d. Is it really\nlegitimate to look for analogous auditory concepts for notions that\nare authentically visual? Important questions that are triggered by\nNudds\u2019 argument are: how far we can go with the analogy between\nvision and audition, and how admissible is to ground our reasoning on\nthe analogy between the two sensory modalities especially when dealing\nwith items so intrinsically visual, such as holograms and images?\n",
