    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || Tanabe\u2019s Absolute Nothingness as the Other-Power of Absolute Mediation\n3.4 Tanabe\u2019s Absolute Nothingness as the Other-Power of Absolute Mediation\n\nIt is Tanabe\u2019s declaration of partial independence from\nNishida\u2019s thought in an essay written in 1930, \u201cRequesting\nInstruction from Professor Nishida\u201d (THZ IV, 305\u2013328),\nthat many see as the origin of the Kyoto School as more than a group\nof disciples of \u201cNishida Philosophy.\u201d In this essay Tanabe\nsharply criticizes Nishida\u2019s middle-period philosophy of the\n\u201cplace of absolute nothingness,\u201d claiming that it falls\ninto kind of Plotinian \u201cemanationism\u201d that ultimately\nrests on a religious or mystical intuition. For Tanabe, this posed two\nserious problems for a genuine philosophy of absolute nothingness.\n\nTo begin with, in crossing the line between philosophical reason,\nbased on ordinary experience, and supra-rational intuition, based on\nextra-ordinary religious experience, Nishida had purportedly committed\na methodological transgression. Here Tanabe poses a question that\nstill resounds through (some would say haunts) the halls of Kyoto\nSchool studies to this day. As James Heisig puts it, the Kyoto School\nthinkers in general do not share an important assumption of Western\nphilosophy as a whole, namely, a \u201cclear delineation between\nphilosophy and religion\u201d (Heisig 2001, 13\u201314). This is a\ncomplex issue, since the Western concept of \u201creligion\u201d was\njust as much an import to Japan as was \u201cphilosophy.\u201d The\nproblems faced and the possibilities opened up by a Zen Buddhist\n\u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d in particular differ in\nsignificant ways from a Judeo-Christian one, insofar as the former\ncalls for extending rational thought in the direction of a\n\u201cpractice of awakening\u201d rather than in the direction of a\nleap of faith.\n\nThe provocative methodological issues involved in the relation between\nthe philosophical thinking and the Zen practice of some Kyoto School\nphilosophers deserves greater attention than can be given here (see\nDavis 2021; 2022a, 275\u2013289). Let it suffice to point out here\nthat Tanabe too later crisscrosses the line between philosophy and\nreligion as much as any Kyoto School thinker, although his Shin\nBuddhist inclinations took him in the direction of \u201cfaith\u201d\nrather than\n \u201cintuition.\u201d[14]\n After this religious turn in his thinking, Tanabe claimed that\nphilosophy and faith must be mediated by a personal act of metanoesis\n(Tanabe 2000, 34; Tanabe 1986, 29) and that, in order to develop a\ngenuine philosophy of religion, \u201cin the end one must have faith\nand become self-aware by means of religious faith\u201d (Tanabe 2003,\n27).\n\nFor his part, Nishida responded to Tanabe\u2019s early critique by\naffirming that his idea of the self-awareness of absolute nothingness\ndoes indeed entail the profound significance of religious experience.\nYet he claims that this is neither mystical in the sense of\n\u201creligious ecstasy\u201d nor \u201cis it thought in the\ndirection of substance, as is Plotinus\u2019 One.\u201d He denies\nthe charge of emanationism, claiming that in his thought \u201cit is\nnot a matter of the self-determination of being, but rather the\nself-determination of nothingness\u201d (NKZ VI, 154). For Nishida,\nonly if the absolute is thought in terms of a self-negating\nnothingness, rather than in terms of a transcendent plenum of the One,\nis it possible to truly affirm the world of the many. The absolute is\nfound in the very midst of beings, not beyond them. It is\n\u201cbecause this is absolute nothingness,\u201d Nishida writes in\nthe parlance of Zen, \u201cthat the mountain is mountain, the river\nis river, and all beings are just as they are\u201d (NKZ V, 182; see\nNishida 1958, 137).\n\nBut the other major concern of Tanabe\u2019s critique of Nishida was\nthat, insofar as absolute nothingness is made into an unchanging basis\nor enveloping \u201cplace\u201d of a system of reality, and insofar\nas it is seen as transcending the dialectical interactions among\nbeings, then such a philosophy ends up falling back into a metaphysics\nof being after all. In order to radically think the idea of absolute\nnothingness, Tanabe argues, we must conceive of it rather in terms of\n\u201cabsolute mediation\u201d or \u201cabsolute dialectic.\u201d\nAbsolute nothingness must be thought, not as an enveloping place, but\nas the very movement of \u201cabsolute negation,\u201d a movement\nwhich originates in the self-negation of absolute nothingness itself.\nTanabe writes: \u201cSince the absolute, as nothingness, must act as\nan absolute mediating force, it presupposes relative being as its\nmedium. In contrast with the doctrine of the creation of the world\nmaintained by the theist, or the theory of emanation propounded by the\npantheist, [for] historical thinking the absolute and the relative,\nnothingness and being, are interrelated each with the other as\nindispensable elements of absolute mediation\u201d (Tanabe 2000, 27;\nTanabe 1986, 23).\n\nIn this later text, Philosophy as Metanoetics, written around\nthe same time as Nishida was elaborating his own kenotic idea of a\nself-negating absolute nothingness, Tanabe, in a putative critique of\nNishida, also writes: \u201cBecause the absolute subject of\nOther-power is absolute nothingness \u2026 it must be thoroughly\nmediated by the relative self. In contrast to a mere\n\u2018self-identity of absolute contradictories\u2019, only that\nwhich entails the absolute existential mediation of the death and\nresurrection of the self can be called absolute nothingness\u201d\n(Tanabe 2000, 13; Tanabe 1986, 8). Tanabe\u2019s passing dismissal of\nNishida\u2019s terminology here is hardly convincing, since in fact\nNishida too speaks of the absolute self-negation of absolute\nnothingness and of the existential death and resurrection of the\nfinite self. In any case, Tanabe\u2019s philosophy as the \u201cway\nof metanoetics\u201d (zanged\u014d) entails a ceaseless\nmovement of what he calls \u201cabsolute critique,\u201d where the\nself-power of finite reason again and again runs up against\nantinomies, and is reborn only by way of absolute nothingness as what\nhe calls, in the parlance of Shinran\u2019s Shin Buddhism, the\nworkings of Other-power (tariki).\n\nAs Nishitani and others have pointed out (see NKC IX, 212ff.;\nNishitani 1991, 161ff.), Tanabe\u2019s criticisms often fail to do\njustice to Nishida\u2019s thought, and we should not forget the\nimpetuses Tanabe acknowledges having received from his erstwhile\nmentor. Yet, on the other hand, his criticisms were not without their\npoint, and his provocations certainly did serve as counter-impetuses\nthat spurred Nishida on, not just to clarify, but also to further\ndevelop his philosophy of absolute nothingness (see Sugimoto 2011;\nKopf 2004). No doubt in large part due to the persistent attention\ngiven by Tanabe\u2019s \u201clogic of the specific\u201d to the\nhistorical world, to the irrational element of the specific through\nwhich the individual and the universal must be mediated, and to the\ndialectical relations between finite beings, Nishida gradually moved\ntoward a much more dynamic conception of absolute nothingness as the\nself-determination of the dialectical world, a self-determination\nwhich takes place only by way of the mutual interactions between\nindividual persons, things, and their social-historical contexts.\n",
