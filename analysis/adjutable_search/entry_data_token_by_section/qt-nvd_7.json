    "main_text": "Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory || Algebraic Quantum Field Theory\n4.1 Algebraic Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn 1943, Gelfand and Neumark published an important paper on an\nimportant class of normed rings, which are now known as abstract\n\\(C^*\\)-algebras. Their paper was influenced by Murray and von\nNeumann\u2019s work on rings of operators, which was discussed in the\nprevious section. In their paper, Gelfand and Neumark focus attention\non abstract normed \\(*\\)-rings. They show that any\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra can be given a concrete representation in a Hilbert\nspace (which need not be separable). That is to say, there is an\nisomorphic mapping of the elements of a \\(C^*\\)-algebra into the set\nof bounded operators of the Hilbert space. Four years later, Segal\n(1947a) published a paper that served to complete the work of Gelfand\nand Neumark by specifying the definitive procedure for constructing\nconcrete (Hilbert space) representations of an abstract\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra. It is called the GNS construction (after Gelfand,\nNeumark, and Segal). That same year, Segal (1947b) published an\nalgebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, which was substantially\ninfluenced by (though deviating somewhat from) von Neumann\u2019s\n(1963, Vol. III, No. 9) algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics,\nwhich is cited in the previous section. It is worth noting that\nalthough \\(C^*\\)-algebras satisfy Segal\u2019s postulates, the\nalgebra that is specified by his postulates is a more general\nstructure known as a Segal algebra. Every \\(C^*\\)-algebra is a Segal\nalgebra, but the converse is false since Segal\u2019s postulates do\nnot require an adjoint operation to be defined. If a Segal algebra is\nisomorphic to the set of all self-adjoint elements of a\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra, then it is a special or exceptional Segal algebra.\nAlthough the mathematical theory of Segal algebras has been fairly\nwell developed, a \\(C^*\\)-algebra is the most important type of\nalgebra that satisfies Segal\u2019s postulates.\n\nThe algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics that were developed by\nvon Neumann and Segal did not change the way that quantum mechanics\nwas done. Nevertheless, they did have a substantial impact in two\nrelated contexts: QFT and quantum statistical mechanics. The key\ndifference leading to the impact has to do with the domain of\napplicability. The domain of quantum mechanics consists of finite\nquantum systems, meaning quantum systems that have a finite number of\ndegrees of freedom. Whereas in QFT and quantum statistical mechanics,\nthe systems of special interest \u2013 i.e., quantum fields and\nparticle systems in the thermodynamic limit, respectively \u2013 are\ninfinite quantum systems, meaning quantum systems that have an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom. Dirac (1927) was the first to\nrecognize the importance of infinite quantum systems for QFT, which is\nreprinted in Schwinger (1958).\n\nSegal (1959, p. 5) was the first to suggest that the beauty and power\nof the algebraic approach becomes evident when working with an\ninfinite quantum system . The key advantage of the algebraic approach,\naccording to Segal (1959, pp. 5\u20136), is that one may work in the\nabstract algebraic setting where it is possible to obtain interacting\nfields from free fields by an automorphism on the algebra, one that\nneed not be unitarily implementable. Segal notes (1959, p. 6) that von\nNeumann (1937) had a similar idea (that field dynamics are to be\nexpressed as an automorphism on the algebra) in an unpublished\nmanuscript. Segal notes this advantage in response to a result\nobtained by Haag (1955), that field theory representations of free\nfields are unitarily inequivalent to representations of interacting\nfields. Haag mentions that von Neumann (1938) first discovered\n\u2018different\u2019 (unitarily inequivalent) representations much\nearlier. A different way of approaching unitarily equivalent\nrepresentations, by contrast with Segal\u2019s approach, was later\npresented by Haag and Kastler (1964), who argued that unitarilty\ninequivalent representations are physically equivalent. Their notion\nof physical equivalence was based on Fell\u2019s mathematical idea of\nweak equivalence (Fell 1960).\n\nAfter indicating important similarities between his and von\nNeumann\u2019s approaches to infinite quantum systems, Segal draws an\nimportant contrast that serves to give the advantage to his approach\nover von Neumann\u2019s. The key mathematical difference, according\nto Segal, is that von Neumann was working with a weakly closed ring of\noperators (meaning that the ring of operators is closed with respect\nto the weak operator topology), whereas Segal is working with a\nuniformly closed ring of operators (closed with respect to the uniform\ntopology). It is crucial because it has the following interpretive\nsignificance, which rests on operational considerations:\n\nThe present intuitive idea is roughly that the only measurable\nfield-theoretic variables are those that can be expressed in terms of\na finite number of canonical operators, or uniformly\napproximated by such; the technical basis is a uniformly\nclosed ring (more exactly, an abstract \\(C^*\\)-algebra). The crucial\ndifference between the two varieties of approximation arises from the\nfact that, in general, weak approximation has only analytical\nsignificance, while uniform approximation may be defined\noperationally, two observables being close if the maximum (spectral)\nvalue of the difference is small (Segal 1959, p. 7).\n\n\nInitially, it appeared that Segal\u2019s assessment of the relative\nmerits of von Neumann algebras and \\(C^*\\)-algebras with respect to\nphysics was substantiated by a seminal paper, (Haag and Kastler 1964).\nAmong other things, Haag and Kastler introduced the key axioms of the\nalgebraic approach to QFT. They also argued that unitarily\ninequivalent representations are \u201cphysically equivalent\u201d\nto each other. However, the use of physical equivalence to show that\nunitarily inequivalent representations are not physically significant\nhas been challenged; see Kronz and Lupher (2005), Lupher (2018), and\nRuetsche (2011). The prominent role of type-III factor von Neumann\nalgebras within the algebraic approach to quantum statistical\nmechanics and QFT raises further doubts about Segal\u2019s\nassessment.\n\nThe algebraic approach has proven most effective in quantum\nstatistical mechanics. It is extremely useful for characterizing many\nimportant macroscopic quantum effects including crystallization,\nferromagnetism, superfluidity, structural phase transition,\nBose-Einstein condensation, and superconductivity. A good introductory\npresentation is Sewell (1986), and for a more advanced discussion see\nBratteli and Robinson (1979, 1981). In algebraic quantum statistical\nmechanics, an infinite quantum system is defined by specifying an\nabstract algebra of observables. A particular state may then be used\nto specify a concrete representation of the algebra as a set of\nbounded operators in a Hilbert space. Among the most important types\nof states that are considered in algebraic statistical mechanics are\nthe equilibrium states, which are often referred to as \u201cKMS\nstates\u201d (since they were first introduced by the physicists\nKubo, Martin, and Schwinger). There is a continuum of KMS states since\nthere is at least one KMS state for each possible temperature value\n\\(\\tau\\) of the system, for \\(0\\le \\tau \\le +\\infty\\). Given an\nautomorphism group, each KMS state corresponds to a representation of\nthe algebra of observables that defines the system, and each of these\nrepresentations is unitarily inequivalent to any other. It turns out\nthat each representation that corresponds to a KMS state is a factor:\nif \\(\\tau = 0\\) then it is a type-I factor, if \\(\\tau = +\\infty\\) then\nit is a type-II factor, and if \\(0\\lt \\tau \\lt +\\infty\\) then it is a\ntype-III factor. Thus, type-III factors play a predominant role in\nalgebraic quantum statistical mechanics.\n\nIn algebraic QFT, an algebra of observables is associated with bounded\nregions of Minkowski spacetime (and unbounded regions including all of\nspacetime by way of certain limiting operations) that are required to\nsatisfy standard axioms of local structure: isotony, locality,\ncovariance, additivity, positive spectrum, and a unique invariant\nvacuum state. The resulting set of algebras on Minkowski spacetime\nthat satisfy these axioms is referred to as the net of local\nalgebras. It has been shown that special subsets of the net of\nlocal algebras \u2013 those corresponding to various types of\nunbounded spacetime regions such as tubes, monotones (a tube that\nextends infinitely in one direction only), and wedges \u2013 are\ntype-III factors. Of particular interest for the foundations of\nphysics are the algebras that are associated with bounded spacetime\nregions, such as a double cone (the finite region of intersection of a\nforward and a backward light cone). As a result of work done over the\nlast thirty years, local algebras of relativistic QFT appear to be\ntype III von Neuman algebras see Halvorson (2007, pp. 749\u2013752)\nfor more details.\n\nOne important area for interpretive investigation is the existence of\na continuum of unitarily inequivalent representations of an algebra of\nobservables. Attitudes towards unitarily inequivalent representations\ndiffer drastically in the philosophical literature. In (Wallace 2006)\nunitarily inequivalent representations are not considered a\nfoundational problem for QFT, while in Ruetsche (2011), Lupher (2018)\nand Kronz and Lupher (2005) unitarily inequivalent representations are\nconsidered physically significant.\n",
