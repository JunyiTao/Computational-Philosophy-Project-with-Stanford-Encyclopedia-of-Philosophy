    "main_text": "Foundations of the Harm Principle || Utilitarian/Consequentialist Foundations\n6.1 Utilitarian/Consequentialist Foundations\n\nMoving on from questions of definition, what are the foundations of\nthe harm principle? Mill, together with Jeremy Bentham and Henry\nSidgwick, was one of three giants of nineteenth century\nutilitarianism. He declared utility to be the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions. Speaking of his harm principle, he also\ndeclared:\n\n\nI forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the\nidea of abstract right, as a thing independent from utility. (Mill\nOn Liberty, ch. 1.11 [1993: 79])\n\n\nThe harm principle sounds rather like the (foregone) stuff of abstract\nright, so how is utility to give any support to the harm principle? At\nfirst sight, the principle of utility looks like a straightforward\nrival to the harm principle, not its sturdy foundation. Mill\nheld of the principle of utility that\n\n\nactions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness,\nwrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. (Mill\nUtilitarianism, ch. 2.2 [1993: 7]\n\n\nThis last formulation seems to counsel states to keep their options\nopen in their law-making. \u201cDo what you can to reverse\nunhappiness\u201d, the advice seems to be, \u201cand do what you can\nto promote happiness\u201d,\n\n\nCoerce to prevent harm to others if that will reverse unhappiness;\ncoerce for some other end if that will equally do the trick.\n\n\nBut as we have just seen, coercion to prevent harmless wrongdoing is\nruled out by Mill, irrespective of whether such an action is the\nstate\u2019s best bet for reversing unhappiness.\n\nThe path to reconciling the harm principle with utilitarianism is\noften thought to be some form of indirect utilitarianism\n(Gray 1996; Mulgan 2007: 117\u2013119). The distinction is drawn\nbetween a criterion of rightness and a decision\nprocedure (Mulgan 2007: 117\u2013119). Thus, on this indirect\nview the words \u201cactions are right in proportion as they tend to\npromote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of\nhappiness\u201d is not any part of a decision procedure; it is a\ncriterion of rightness. Sometimes, perhaps often, a criterion of\nrightness will itself feature heavily in a decision procedure. But at\nother times a decision procedure will not contain the supreme\ncriterion of rightness. Acting always to promote happiness or minimize\nunhappiness may be self-defeating for various reasons or impossible in\nthe practical circumstances of ignorance that ordinary people face.\nOver the course of a lifetime and across all the activities of a legal\nsystem, more utility will be produced and disutility avoided if the\nharm principle has the place Mill argues it has, despite the fact that\nthis will repeatedly require the sacrifice of some utility in day to\nday legal dealings. Much of this, for Mill, relates to the importance\nof human liberty to happiness (Gray 1996: 136). Demonstrating that one\ncan really derive something as strong as the harm principle (\u201cto\ngovern absolutely\u201d) in this way is a formidable challenge. It is\nsubject, among other things, to scepticism about the workability of\nthe distinction between criterion of rightness and decision procedure\n(Griffin 1994; Mulgan 2007). John Gray\u2019s book-long attempt to\nspell out how the harm principle can be underpinned by indirect\nutilitarianism came to be repudiated by Gray himself (Gray 1996:\npostscript) . Contemporary consequentialism, however, continues to\nflourish (Sinnott-Armstrong 2019); and many accounts of the harm\nprinciple still see a form of utilitarianism as the best grounding for\nthe harm principle (Sumner 2004, 2011). Moreover, there are\nnon-utilitarian writers making related arguments in support of the\nharm principle. Les Green for example argues that\n\n\nThere can be reasons to promulgate, and attempt to conform to, an\nabsolute norm even if the reasons that justify having a norm in that\nfield are defeasible. (Green 2013: 191)\n\n\nOther accounts of criminalization maintain utilitarianism or a broad\nconsequentialism but conclude the harm principle must be rejected\n(Petersen 2020a,b).\n",
