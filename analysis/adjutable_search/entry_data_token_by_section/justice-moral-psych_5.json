Conclusion\nAt this point, it is tempting to speculate about what some of the\nbroader implications might be of these empirical findings. For\ninstance, what can they tell us about how to design a just society? If\nwe should assume that most of us suffer from moral hypocrisy to enough\nof an extent that we are not fair people, does that support more\nactive monitoring by the state to detect unfair behavior? How might we\npractically implement the findings about mirrors (should they be\nstrategically placed around the public square to encourage fair\nbehavior?) and empathy (should there be regular public reminders to\nimagine what others are going through who are less fortunate?)? And\nwhat other lessons can we extrapolate from this research to help us\nimprove society? This is not the place to explore these questions, but\nthey are a natural next step.\nOf course, allocation decisions in real life tend to be much more complicated\nthan simple dictator or ultimatum games. But as we have seen, these\ngames and their many different variations can shed important light on\nthe moral psychology of justice. Clearly no simple story about our\nmotives to be just or fair is going to be plausible. We are more\ncomplex creatures than that.\n",
