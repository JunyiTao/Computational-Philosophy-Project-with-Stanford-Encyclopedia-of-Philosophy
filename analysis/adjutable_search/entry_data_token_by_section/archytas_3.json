    "main_text": "Life and Works || Archytas and Plato\n1.4 Archytas and Plato\n\nArchytas was most famous in antiquity and is most famous in the modern\nworld for having sent a ship to rescue Plato from the tyrant of\nSyracuse, Dionysius II, in 361. In both the surviving ancient lives of\nArchytas (by Diogenes Laertius, VIII 79\u201383, and in the\nSuda) the first thing mentioned about him, after the name of\nhis city-state and his father, is his rescue of Plato (A1 and A2).\nThis story is told in greatest detail in the Seventh Letter\nascribed to Plato. It has accordingly been typical to identify\nArchytas as \u201cthe friend of Plato\u201d (Mathieu 1987). Archytas\nfirst met Plato over twenty years earlier, when Plato visited southern\nItaly and Sicily for the first time in 388/7, during his travels after\nthe death of Socrates (Pl. [?], Ep. VII 324a, 326b-d; Cicero,\nRep. I 10. 16; Philodemus, Acad. Ind. X 5\u201311;\ncf. D.L. III 6). Some scholars have seen Archytas as the dominant\nfigure in the relationship (Zhmud 2006, 93) and even as the \u201cnew\nmodel philosopher for Plato\u201d (Vlastos 1991, 129) and the\narchetype of Plato\u2019s philosopher-king (Guthrie 1962, 333). The\nactual situation appears to be considerably more complicated. The\nancient evidence, apart from the Seventh Letter, presents the\nrelationship between Archytas and Plato in diametrically opposed ways.\nOne tradition does present Archytas as the Pythagorean master at whose\nfeet Plato sat, after Socrates had died (e.g., Cicero, Rep. I\n10.16), but another tradition makes Archytas the student of Plato, to\nwhom he owed his fame and success in Tarentum (Demosthenes [?],\nErotic Oration 44).\n\nThe Seventh Letter itself is of contested authenticity. Many\nscholars regard it either as the work of Plato himself or of a student\nof Plato who had considerable familiarity with Plato\u2019s\ninvolvement in events in Sicily (see e.g., Brisson 1987; Lloyd 1990;\nSchofield 2000), but grave doubts about this view have been raised by\nBurnyeat and Frede (2015). The letter appears to serve as an apologia\nfor Plato\u2019s involvement in events in Sicily. Lloyd has argued,\nhowever, that the letter also serves to distance Plato from\nPythagoreanism and from Archytas (1990). Nothing in the letter\nsuggests that Plato was ever the pupil of Archytas; instead the\nrelationship is much closer to that presented in the Erotic\nOration. Plato is presented as the dominant figure upon whom\nArchytas depends both philosophically and politically. Archytas writes\nto Plato claiming that Dionysius II has made great progress in\nphilosophy, in order to urge Plato to come to Sicily a third time\n(339d-e). These claims are belied as soon as Plato arrives (340b). The\nletter thus suggests that, far from being the Pythagorean master from\nwhom Plato learned his philosophy, Archytas had a very imperfect\nunderstanding of what Plato considered philosophy to be. The letter\nmakes clear that Plato does have a relationship of xenia,\n\u201cguest-friendship,\u201d with Archytas and others at Tarentum\n(339e, 350a). This relationship could have been established on\nPlato\u2019s first visit in 388/7, since Plato uses it as a basis to\nestablish a similar relationship between Archytas and Dionysius II\nduring his second visit in 367 (338c). It is also the relationship in\nterms of which Plato appeals to Archytas for help, when he is in\ndanger after the third trip to Sicily goes badly (350a). Such a\nfriendship need not imply any close personal intimacy, however.\nAristotle classifies xenia as a friendship for utility and\npoints out that such friends do not necessarily spend much time\ntogether or even find each other\u2019s company pleasant (EN\n1156a26 ff.). Apart from Archytas\u2019 rescue of Plato in 361 (even\nthis is described as devised by Plato [350a]), Plato is clearly the\ndominant figure in the relationship. Archytas is portrayed as\nPlato\u2019s inferior in his understanding of philosophy, and Plato\nis even presented as responsible for some of Archytas\u2019 political\nsuccess, insofar as he establishes the relationship between Archytas\nand Dionysius II, which is described as of considerable political\nimportance (339d).\n\nHow are we to unravel the true nature of the relationship between\nPlato and Archytas in the light of this conflicting evidence? Apart\nfrom the Seventh Letter, Plato never makes a direct reference\nto Archytas. He does, however, virtually quote a sentence from\nArchytas\u2019 book on harmonics in Book VII of the Republic\n(530d), and his discussions of the science of stereometry shortly\nbefore this are likely to have some connections to Archytas\u2019\nwork in solid geometry (528d). It is thus in the context of the\ndiscussion of the sciences that Plato refers to Archytas, and the\nremains of Archytas\u2019 work focus precisely on the sciences (e.g.,\nfr. B1). Both strands of the tradition can be reconciled, if we\nsuppose that Plato\u2019s first visit to Italy and Sicily was at\nleast in part motivated by his desire to meet Archytas, as the first\ntradition claims, but that he sought Archytas out not as a new\n\u201cmodel philosopher\u201d but rather as an expert in the\nmathematical sciences, in which Plato had developed a deep interest.\nIn Republic VII, Plato is critical of Pythagorean harmonics\nand of current work in solid geometry on philosophical grounds, so\nthat, while he undoubtedly learned a considerable amount of\nmathematics from Archytas, he clearly disagreed with Archytas\u2019\nunderstanding of the philosophical uses of the sciences. In 388\nTarentum had not yet reached the height of its power, and Archytas is\nnot likely to have achieved his political dominance yet, so that there\nmay also be some truth to the claim of the second tradition that\nArchytas did not achieve his great practical success until after his\ncontact with Plato; whether or not that success had any direct\nrelationship to his contact with Plato is more doubtful. On their\nfirst meeting in 388/7, Plato and Archytas established a relationship\nof guest-friendship, which obligated them to further each\nother\u2019s interests, which they did, as the events of\n367\u2013361 show. Plato and Archytas need not have been in agreement\non philosophical issues and are perhaps better seen as competitive\ncolleagues engaged in an ongoing debate as to the value of the\nsciences for philosophy (Huffman 2005, 32\u201342).\n",
