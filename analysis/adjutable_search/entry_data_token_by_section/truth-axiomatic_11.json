    "main_text": "Type-free truth\n4. Type-free truth\nThe truth predicates in natural languages do not come with any\nouvert type restriction. Therefore typed theories of truth (axiomatic\nas well as semantic theories) have been thought to be inadequate for\nanalysing the truth predicate of natural language, although recently\nhierarchical theories have been advocated by Glanzberg (2015)\nand others. This is one motive for investigating type-free theories of\ntruth, that is, systems of truth that allow one to prove the truth of\nsentences involving the truth predicate. Some type-free theories of\ntruth have much higher expressive power than the typed theories that\nhave been surveyed in the previous section (at least as long as\nindexed truth predicates are avoided). Therefore type-free theories of\ntruth are much more powerful tools in the reduction of other theories\n(for instance, second-order ones). \n",
