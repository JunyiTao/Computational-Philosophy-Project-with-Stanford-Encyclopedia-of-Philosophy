    "main_text": "Preliminaries: The Face Value Theory\n1. Preliminaries: The Face Value Theory\n\nA useful starting point for thinking about religious language is a\nface value theory that promises to give an interpretation of\nreligious sentences and utterances that adheres as closely as possible\nto what they appear to say. Take, for instance, the affirmation of an\nindicative religious sentence such as\n\n(1)God is\nomnipotent\n\n\nAccording to the face value theory, (1) has various apparent\ncharacteristics: (a) It has the propositional\u2014or\n\u201clinguistic\u201d or \u201csemantic\u201d\u2014content\nthat God is omnipotent and is true just in case God is\nomnipotent; (b) it is an assertion that conventionally expresses the\nspeaker\u2019s belief that God is omnipotent; (c) it is a descriptive\nutterance that represents (truly or falsely) the fact that God is\nomnipotent, just as other descriptive utterances in other fields of\ndiscourse (in science, history, etc.) represent facts. For proponents\nof face value theory, generalisations of (a), (b) and (c) that extend\nto indicative religious utterances such as (1)\u2014(a*), (b*) and\n(c*) respectively\u2014provide the starting point for the\ninterpretation of religious discourse. It should be treated in the\nsame way as the interpretation of other descriptive areas of\ndiscourse: there\u2019s nothing special about religious discourse\nother than its distinctive subject matter.\n\nThe face value theory will, of course, need more development if it is\nto explain other areas of religious discourse. The approach taken to\n(1) clearly does not apply to non-literal or non-assertoric religious\nutterances, such as metaphors, questions, fictional stories,\nexpressions of hope, or devotion. However, these are all forms of\nexpression that occur outside religious discourse; they are not unique\nto religion. For the face value theory, the treatment of religious\ncases will fall in line with the treatment of non-literal and\nnon-assertoric communication more generally. So, other than the fact\nthat religious discourse is about God, the afterlife and so on, there\nis nothing remarkable or distinctive in the interpretation of\nreligious utterances.\n\nA large part of research on religious language has been concerned with\nwhether one or more of (a*), (b*) and (c*) ought plausibly to be\nrejected. Indeed, the attention that some theories of religious\nlanguage receive is in part due to their divergence from a face value\ninterpretation. Most of the theories that are discussed within the\nfield reject at least one of the components of face value theory.\n\nThe most radical rejection of face value theory is the denial of (a*),\ni.e., that religious utterances express religious\n propositions.[1]\n These theories will be explored in\n section 2.\n The most famous example of this position is Ayer\u2019s version\nlogical positivism\n (2.1).\n Non-cognitive accounts, from which we have selected Braithwaite\n (2.2.1)\n and Berkeley\n (2.2.2),\n are similarly radical but are differently motivated and offer a more\npositive alternative account of the meaning of religious utterances.\nThe prospects for a more sophisticated non-cognitivism are considered\nin\n 2.2.3.\n A third class of theories\n (2.3),\n propose that religious utterances are paradoxical or fail to express\ncomplete propositions. A fourth group, reductionist and subjectivist\ntheories\n (2.4),\n allow that religious utterances express propositions but not the ones\nthat they appear to. Instead, their truth conditions are given by\n\u201creduced\u201d (typically non-religious) sentences.\n\nSection 3\n will look at theories that reject (b*), i.e., that indicative\nstatements affirmed about God are not literal assertions.\n 3.1\n will review metaphor theories, encompassing a discussion of analogy.\nInterpretations of religious discourse as a form of praise or prayer,\nsuggested by Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida, will be considered\nin\n 3.2.\n These theories propose that despite appearing to literally assert\nreligious sentences, speakers are instead employing a different type\nof speech act. An alternative approach is to argue that religious\nutterances are avowed for practical reasons rather than their truth.\nIan Ramsey\n (3.3)\n takes this approach, as do hermeneutic fictionalists\n (3.4).\n\nMinimalists\n (4.1)\n agree that indicative religious utterances are representational and\nassertoric but deny that they represent religious facts in the way\nthat other areas of descriptive discourse represent facts. That is,\nthey agree with (a*) and (b*) but reject (c*). This view is sometimes\nassociated with Wittgenstein, whose brief remarks and lectures on\nreligion have been highly influential. However, the interpretation of\nhis work is not widely agreed upon and some different possibilities\nwill be considered in\n 4.2.\n\n\nThe face value theory is a widely assumed\u2014if not the\ndefault\u2014approach taken to religious discourse in contemporary\nanalytic philosophy of religion. Resistance to it is sometimes\npresented a brief aberration confined to the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century (Mackie 1982: 2; Swinburne 1993: 88) with\nquestionable if not anti-religious motivations (van Inwagen 2006: 156;\nPlantinga 2000: ch. 2, particularly in reference to Gordon Kaufman).\nHowever, as will become clear in the following sections, the\nopposition to face value theory is not of recent vintage and although\nsome who disagree with face value theory may be atheists, the position\nis not tied to atheism.\n",
