Metaphysics and epistemology\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s \u201cOn Evidence in Metaphysical Sciences\u201d\n(the so-called Prize Essay) garnered first prize in the\ncontest staged by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences on the\nquestion of whether metaphysical truths are able to have the same sort\nof evidence as mathematical truths. (An essay by Immanuel Kant came in\nsecond place; for a detailed comparison and contrast of the two\n\u201cprize essays,\u201d see Guyer 2020, 27\u201372.) In\nMendelssohn\u2019s essay, published in 1763, he argues that\nmetaphysics pursues its subject matter by applying the same method\nthat mathematics does: conceptual analysis. As he puts it, \u201cThe\nanalysis of concepts is for the understanding nothing more than what\nthe magnifying glass is for sight\u201d (Philosophical\nWritings, p. 258). But Mendelssohn then proceeds to differentiate\nthe kinds of evidence in mathematics and in metaphysics in the\nfollowing way. Like calculus, but unlike geometry, metaphysics works\nwith concepts that are no less certain than those of geometry, but\nlack the transparency and imaginative resources available to the\ngeometer\u2019s concepts. The difference between mathematics and\nmetaphysics lies in the difference in the content of the concepts,\nnamely, the difference between quantity and quality. At the same time,\nthere is a basic harmony between the two disciplines since quantity\nand quality are both intrinsic characteristics of finite things and\nneither quantity nor quality exists without the other (for review of\nMendelssohn\u2019s and Kant\u2019s theories of mathematics, see\nCallanan 2014).\n\nMendelssohn acknowledges that, despite the fact that the method is the\nsame and the content in each case (mathematics and metaphysics) is an\nintrinsic character of things, progress in metaphysics has lagged far\nbehind that in mathematics. He suggests three \u201cobjective\u201d\nreasons for this lag: first, metaphysics\u2019 greater reliance upon\narbitrary signs (signs that do not essentially coincide with what is\nsignified); second, the holistic content of metaphysics (no quality\ncan be defined without an adequate insight into the others); and\nthird, metaphysics\u2019 need to establish the actual existence of\nwhat corresponds to the analyzed concepts. Thus, for Mendelssohn,\nmathematical truths need not suppose more than the appearances of\nthings as long as a distinction is maintained between constant and\ninconstant appearances or, equivalently, between appearances that have\ntheir basis in the intrinsic, essential constitution of our senses and\nthose that do not (e.g., those due to sickness or a faulty\nperspective). \u201cThus, even in the system of a doubter or an\nidealist, the value of not only pure, theoretical mathematics but even\npractical and applied mathematics remains, and it retains its\nundeniable certainty\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 268).\nMetaphysics, by contrast, requires a resolution of the problem of\nidealism.\n\nTwenty-five years after the Prize Essay, Mendelssohn\ncontinues to struggle with the issue of idealism in Morning\nHours, his final metaphysical work. Although he espouses a theism\nthat is compatible with a realist position (what he dubs\n\u201cdualism\u201d as opposed to idealism, materialism, and\nskepticism), he appears to be moving toward a position that straddles\nan idealist/non-idealist divide. He views inquiry into something\n\u201cextra-conceptual\u201d as tantamount to \u201cinquiring about\na concept that is actually no concept and therefore something\ncontradictory is supposed\u201d (Morning Hours, p.\n42/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 60f). A further tilt in the\ndirection of idealism is apparent in his rejection of the traditional\ndefinition of truth as an agreement of things with thoughts, on the\nground that the copy (the thought) cannot be compared with the\noriginal (the thing). Since thoughts can be compared with one another,\nhe turns to them for a determination of truth, though it is not clear\nhow this move can avoid idealism. At the same time, however, he\ndistinguishes truths that are certain (consisting in the\nagreement of thoughts with themselves) from actual truths,\ndetermined by adherence to principles of induction and analogy in\naddition to the principle of noncontradiction. The latter truths are\ntruths about facts outside us or about a causal connection, though\nthey are relative to certain factors: the number of sensations of a\nsingle sort that agree with one another, the number of different sorts\nof sensations that concur, and the number of times our assessment\nagrees with those of others, of other species, and of even\n\u201chigher entities\u201d (Morning Hours, pp. 6f, 37ff,\n41/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 15f, 54f, 59; for review of\nMendelssohn\u2019s epistemology in the undeservedly neglected first\npart of Morning Hours, see Dahlstrom 2018b and, more fully, Guyer\n2020, 123\u2013140). Echoing Descartes, Mendelssohn maintains that\ndemonstration of God\u2019s existence is necessary to certify the\nactual existence of things outside us.\n\nThis ambivalence can perhaps be traced to the mature\nMendelssohn\u2019s growing suspicions that the entire issue\nseparating idealists and those supporting contrasting positions is\nmisbegotten, a product of linguistic confusion (see the discussion of\nMendelssohn\u2019s views on language below). \u201cI fear that, in\nthe end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists\namounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the\nlinguist than for the speculative philosopher\u201d (Morning\nHours, p. 42 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, p. 61). Mention has already been made of\nMendelssohn\u2019s view in the Prize Essay that\nmetaphysics\u2019 necessary reliance upon artificial signs is one\nreason why its difficulties are more intractable than those of\nmathematics. In 1785, in Morning Hours, he goes further:\n\u201cYou know how much I am inclined to explain all the\ncontroversies of the philosophical schools as merely verbal disputes\nor at least as originally deriving from verbal disputes\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 75/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n104; for commentary, see Dahlstrom 2011). In keeping with these\nadvancing suspicions about the origin and the efficacy of the issue\nover idealism and dualism (realism), Mendelssohn eventually comes to\nassign reason a mediating role in disputes between common sense and\nspeculation. Common sense is usually but not invariably right, he\ncontends, and hence reason\u2019s task is to present a defense of\nspeculation when it departs from common sense. For valuable discussion\nof Mendelssohn\u2019s approach to common sense, see Franks 2011. (The\nappeal to reason to mediate and, if necessary, to rein in speculation\nalso plays a significant role in Mendelssohn\u2019s account of a\n\u201crefined\u201d or \u201cpurified\u201d pantheism in\nMorning Hours. On this point, see below \u201c9. Controversy\nwith Jacobi over Lessing\u2019s alleged pantheism\u201d). As for the\nimpact of Mendelssohn\u2019s approach to idealism in Morning\nHours, many scholars concur that Kant\u2019s Refutation of\nIdealism directly takes it up. However, at least one scholar contends\nthat Kant does so by accepting Mendelssohn\u2019s approach (Munk\n2011b) while others argue, albeit for contrasting reasons, that he\ndoes so in order to refute Mendelssohn\u2019s position (Dyck 2011;\nGuyer 2018a; see, too, Guyer\u2019s contrast of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nmore empirically-bent \u201cmodest epistemology\u201d with\nKant\u2019s more rationalist-inspired \u201ctranscendental\nidealism,\u201d in Guyer 2020, 167\u2013201.)\n",
