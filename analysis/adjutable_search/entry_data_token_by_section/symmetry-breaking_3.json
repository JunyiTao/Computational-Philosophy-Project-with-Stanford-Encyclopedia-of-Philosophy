    "main_text": "Symmetry Principles || Symmetry and quantum mechanics\n2.2 Symmetry and quantum mechanics\n\nThe application of the theory of groups and their representations for\nthe exploitation of symmetries in the quantum mechanics of the 1920s\nundoubtedly represents the second turning point in the\ntwentieth-century history of physical symmetries. It is, in fact, in\nthe quantum context that symmetry principles are at their most\neffective. Wigner and Weyl were among the first to recognize the great\nrelevance of symmetry groups to quantum physics and the first to\nreflect on the meaning of this. As Wigner emphasized on many\noccasions, one essential reason for the \u201cincreased effectiveness\nof invariance principles in quantum theory\u201d (Wigner, 1967, p.\n47) is the linear nature of the state space of a quantum physical\nsystem, corresponding to the possibility of superposing quantum\nstates. This gives rise to, among other things, the possibility of\ndefining states with particularly simple transformation properties in\nthe presence of symmetries.\n\nIn general, if G is a symmetry group of a theory describing a\nphysical system (that is, the dynamical equations of the theory are\ninvariant under the transformations of G), this means that\nthe states of the system transform into each other according to some\n\u201crepresentation\u201d of the group G. In other words,\nthe group transformations are mathematically represented in the state\nspace by operations relating the states to each other. Roberts (2022,\n2.3) characterizes this as an essential requirement for concept\nlike \u201cdynamical evolution\u201d and \u201cspatial\ntranslation\u201d to have meaning in state-space theory, which\nhe refers to as the Representation View.  In the state space of\nquantum mechanics, these operations are implemented through the\noperators that act on the state space and correspond to the physical\nobservables, and any state of a physical system can be described as a\nsuperposition of states of elementary systems, that is, of systems the\nstates of which transform according to the \u201cirreducible\u201d\nrepresentations of the symmetry group. Quantum mechanics thus offers a\nparticularly favourable framework for the application of symmetry\nprinciples. The observables representing the action of the symmetries\nof the theory in the state space, and therefore commuting with the\nHamiltonian of the system, play the role of the conserved quantities;\nfurthermore, the eigenvalue spectra of the invariants of the symmetry\ngroup provide the labels for classifying the irreducible\nrepresentations of the group: on this fact is grounded the possibility\nof associating the values of the invariant properties characterizing\nphysical systems with the labels of the irreducible representations of\nsymmetry groups, i.e. of classifying elementary physical systems by\nstudying the irreducible representations of the symmetry groups.\n",
