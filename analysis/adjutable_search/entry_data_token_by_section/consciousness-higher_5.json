    "main_text": "Self-Representational Higher-Order Theories\n6. Self-Representational Higher-Order Theories\n\nThe two most familiar forms of higher-order theory postulate the\nexistence of a pair of distinct mental states: a first-order\nperceptual or quasi-perceptual state with a given content, and a HOT\nor HOP representing the presence of that first-order state, thereby\nrendering it conscious. Either one of these states can occur without\nthe other, although there may be a reliable causal relation between\nthem, such that certain types of first-order perception (e.g. attended\noutputs of the temporal-lobe visual system) regularly cause\nhigher-order representations of themselves to be formed. In recent\nyears, however, a cluster of different proposals have been made that\nwould reject this independent-state assumption.  Rather, the\nrelationship between the conscious state in question and the\nhigher-order state is said to be constitutive, or\ninternal. To some extent, this view is inspired by Brentano\n(1874/1973) and the phenomenological tradition, including Sartre\n(1956). (See Kriegel 2006, 2018; Kriegel and Williford 2006; Zahavi\n2004; Miguens et al. 2016.) We can refer to these as\n\u2018self-representational\u2019 higher-order theories. (Kriegel\ninitially coined the term \u2018same-order monitoring theory\u2019\nbut this was potentially misleading).\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nSelf-Representational Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(perhaps with analog/non-conceptual intentional content) which also,\nat the same time, possesses an intentional content,\nthereby in some sense representing itself to the person who\nis the subject of that state.\n\n\nThere are two basic types of self-representational theory, depending\non whether the constitutive relation between the conscious state and\nthe higher-order state is one of identity, on the one hand,\nor part-whole, on the other. According to the former type of\naccount, it is one and the same perceptual state that is both\nfirst-order (representing the world to us) and higher-order\n(presenting itself to us). (Caston 2002, argues that Aristotle had a\ntheory of conscious perception of this sort.) Kriegel (2006) claims\nthat such accounts are rather mysterious from a naturalistic\nperspective, but Carruthers (2000, 2005) and perhaps also Van Gulick\n(2001, 2004) purport to provide naturalistic explanations of just this\nsort of view. According to Carruthers, a first-order perceptual state\nwith analog content acquires, at the same time, a higher-order analog\ncontent by virtue of its availability to a \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 faculty, together with the truth of some suitable form of\nconsumer semantics (as explained in section 5 above). Van Gulick can\nbe interpreted as defending a similar view, which likewise relies on a\nform of consumer semantics/functional role semantics, which he labels\na \u2018Higher-Order Global State (HOGS) theory\u2019. On this\naccount, globally broadcast first-order perceptual states acquire at\nthe same time a higher-order\nseeming dimension though their availability to, and\nincorporation into, higher-order models of the self and its relation\nto the perceived environment. (What isn\u2019t entirely clear is whether\nVan Gulick thinks that the resulting perceptual state is the\nHOG state, or is rather a component part of the HOG\nstate\u2014in which case he would be advocating a kind of part-whole\nself-representational account.)\nKriegel\u2019s (2009) eventual view emphasizes and argues for the\nclaim that there is a ubiquitous conscious (but inattentive or\nperipheral) self-awareness which accompanies all first-order\n(attentive and outer-directed) conscious states. Gennaro (2012,\nchapter five) rejects this view by, among other things, arguing that\nit is difficult to make sense of such alleged pervasive peripheral\nself-awareness especially when one is focused on outer-directed\ntasks. It is at least not as clearly present as, say, outer-directed\nperipheral vision in normal visual perception. At minimum, it is\nnotoriously difficult to settle these sorts of disagreements between\ncompeting phenomenological claims.\n\nSome varieties of part-whole self-representational theory take the\nsame general form as actualist kinds of HOT theory, in which a\nfirst-order perceptual state with the content analog-red (as\nit might be) gives rise to a higher-order thought that one is\nexperiencing red. But rather than claiming that it is the first-order\nperception that becomes phenomenally conscious because of the presence\nof the higher-order thought, what is said that the complex state made\nup of both the first-order perception and the\nhigher-order thought becomes conscious. Gennaro (1996, 2008, 2012)\ndefends such a view which he calls the wide intrinsicality\nview such that the HOT is better thought of as belonging to the\nsame overall complex state as its target. It is, however, not always\nclear how this theory could offer any substantive benefits not already\nobtainable from actualist HOT theory. Rather, the claim is merely that\na conscious state is one that contains two parts, one of which is an\nawareness of the other. Kriegel himself (2003, 2006, 2009) and (as\nKriegel interprets him) Van Gulick (2001, 2004) emphasize that the\nfirst-order perception and the higher-order judgment need to\nbe integrated with one another in order for the resulting\ncomplex state to be phenomenally conscious.  Kriegel argues that there\nneeds to be a kind of integration resulting from a psychologically\nreal process (as opposed to a theorist\u2019s definition) in order\nfor the resulting state to have causal powers that differ from those\nof the first-order state/higher-order state pair.\n\nKriegel and Van Gulick do not give fully developed accounts of just\nwhy the integration of first-order perceptions with\nhigher-order judgments should give rise to the properties that are\ndistinctive of phenomenal consciousness. But one plausible\nreconstruction is as follows, modeled on the way that the\nconceptualization of analog (non-conceptual) first-order perceptual\ncontent can transform the latter\u2019s properties. Consider, for\nexample, the familiar duck/rabbit. When someone sees this figure for\nthe first time she may just experience a complex of curved lines,\nrepresenting nothing. But when she comes to see it as a\nrabbit, those lines take on a certain distinctive organization (the\nfigure now has both a front and a back, for example), thereby\ntransforming the represented properties of the figure. Arguably what\nhappens in such cases is that the conceptual systems succeed in\ndeploying a recognitional template for the concept rabbit,\nfinding a \u2018best match\u2019 with the incoming non-conceptual\nrepresentations. Indeed, there is reason to think that just such a\nprocess routinely takes place in perception, with conceptual systems\nseeking matches against incoming data, and with the resulting states\npossessing contents that integrate both conceptual and non-conceptual\n(analog) representations (Kosslyn 1994; Carruthers 2000). The result\nis a single perceptual state that represents both a\nparticular analog shape and a rabbit. Now suppose that when\nsuch states are globally broadcast and are made available to the\nsystems responsible for higher-order thought, a similar process takes\nplace. Those systems bring to bear the concept experience or\nthe concept seeing to produce a further integrated perceptual\nstate. This single state will not only have first-order contents\nrepresenting the lines on the page, and representing a rabbit, they\nwill also have a higher-order content representing that one is\nexperiencing something rabbit-like. Hence the perceptual\nstate in question becomes \u2018self-presenting\u2019, and acquires,\nas part of its content, a dimension of seeming or\nsubjectivity. (See also Gennaro 2005, 2012, for a related\nline of argument in response to this sort of challenge.)\n\nPicciuto (2011) points out, however, that Kriegel\u2019s form of\nself-representational theory still permits a mismatch between the\nfirst-order and higher-order components of the integrated state. For\nthere seems to be nothing in the structure of the account to rule out\nthe possibility of a first-order analog content green\nbecoming integrated with the higher-order judgment I am\nexperiencing yellow, for example. In order to avoid this\ndifficulty, Picciuto (2011) proposes an alternative form of part-whole\nself-representational theory. (See also Coleman, 2015; Timpe, 2015.)\nHe does so by appropriating, and deploying for a novel purpose, the\nidea of a quotational phenomenal concept, originally\nintroduced by Papineau (2002) and Balog (2009) as part of their\ndefense of physicalism against the arguments of Chalmers (1996) and\nothers. Picciuto\u2019s idea is that the relevant sort of complex\nself-representational state will consist of a first-order perceptual\ncontent combined with a higher-order concept like experience\nthat embeds, or \u2018quotes\u2019 that very perceptual\ncontent. Given this structure, it will be impossible that there should\nbe a mismatch between the two. For the higher-order component of the\ncomplex state is not a judgment about the experience\ncomponent (which would permit them to be mismatched) but rather a\nconcept that quotes the experience component.\n\nAll part-whole self-representational accounts differ from the\ndual-content theory of Carruthers (2000, 2005) in the following way,\nhowever: on Carruthers\u2019 account, the end-product can be entirely\nnon-conceptual. And in particular, the higher-order content possessed\nby a conscious percept is a non-conceptual one, representing a\nseeming of the first-order content of the state by virtue of\nits availability to higher-order consumer systems. On all of the\npart-whole accounts sketched above, in contrast, a conscious\nperception is always partially conceptual, containing the higher-order\nconcept experience (or something similar) as part of its\ncontent. There are probably multiple dimensions along which these two\nsorts of theory could be compared, and each may have its own\nadvantages. \n",
