    "main_text": "\n\nYou think to yourself, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t drink another Dr.\nPepper. I\u2019ve had two already\u201d. But the claim that you\nshouldn\u2019t drink another seems like a very different kind of\nclaim than the claim that you\u2019ve had two Dr. Peppers already.\nBroadly (and vaguely) speaking, the first claim tells us something\naction-guiding, whereas the second does not. The first tells us\nsomething about your reasons for acting or thinking a certain way; the\nsecond, by itself, does not. In sum, the first is a normative\nclaim, whereas the second is not.\n\nAction-guiding claims include claims about what someone ought to do,\nor should do, or is obligated to do, or has reason to do. Some\nphilosophers take it that all normative claims are action-guiding in\nthis way. We will take a broader view, however, and include evaluative\nclaims among those that we classify as \u201cnormative\u201d.\nExamples are claims about what it would be good to do, or what would\nbe praiseworthy or virtuous, or about beauty. Our reason for taking\nthis broader view of the normative is that evaluative claims give rise\nto similar philosophical questions as do the claims we described as\naction-guiding. One might suggest that evaluative claims are\nattitude-guiding rather than action-guiding. Perhaps, then, the\ncentral issue we need to understand, in thinking about normativity, is\nthe nature of such \u201cguidance\u201d.\n\nWhat precisely is the nature of the normative? How is it\ndifferent from the non-normative? And how are the two related? Are any\nnormative claims actually true, or is there properly speaking\nnothing I should or shouldn\u2019t do? Are there normative\nproperties, like goodness, obligation, reasons, etc. \u2013 and if so,\nhow are they related to each other? And is the normative fundamentally\na matter of our attitudes, or do certain normative truths obtain\nindependently of what anyone thinks or feels?\n\nIn this article, we will explore these questions, attempting to\noutline some of the major debates about normativity in\nmeta-ethics.\n",
