    "main_text": "Epistemological Views || Radical Skepticism\n3.2 Radical Skepticism\n\nThe dialectic of Academic and Stoic argument and counter-argument\noutlined above may give the impression that Carneades, and the earlier\nAcademic skeptics more generally, were committed to the conclusions\nthat they argued for, i.e., that there are no cognitive impressions,\nthat nothing can be known, that the wise person will suspend assent\nuniversally, etc. But there are several reasons to doubt that\nCarneades straightforwardly believed on the basis of these arguments\nthat nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any\nimpression (see M. Frede 1987). First, such a position is obviously\ninconsistent: since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view (and\nCarneades\u2019 arguments rely on Stoic assumptions), the two\nconclusions cannot be consistently held at one time by a rational\nagent. Secondly, the arguments only work if one already accepts a\nbasically Stoic epistemological framework, i.e., their theory of\nimpressions, their empiricism, their conception of knowledge, their\npsychological doctrine etc. But Carneades had no reason to accept any\nof these highly contestable views rather than, e.g., the Platonic or\nEpicurean alternatives. And, thirdly, we know that the Academic method\nof argument was dialectical: Carneades made it his practice to argue\nfor and against any and all philosophical views. And, in this\nparticular case, there is good reason to think that his arguments were\ndesigned to show the inadequacies of the Stoic view and their\napparently skeptical consequences for the Stoics themselves. This is\nmore or less directly attested in some sources (Numenius fr. 27,\nSextus M\u00a07.159\u201364, cf. 7.150), as well as evident\nfrom the fact that Carneades was happy to try several incompatible\nresponses to the Stoic reductio argument\u2014viz. options\n[1] and [2] above\u2014both of which can easily be read as further\ncriticisms of Stoic epistemological views (see Striker 1980 [1996] and\nAllen 1994).\n\nSo Carneades was not committed to the views that nothing can be known\nand that it is always irrational to assent on the basis of\nthese anti-Stoic arguments: the latter do not give him reasons to\nbelieve their conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems likely that he\nwas committed to them in some sense, since the Stoics and other\nphilosophers kept on arguing against these views as if they were his,\nor the Academic, position, and some of his students clearly agreed.\n(Carneades\u2019 actual position remains controversial; see Bett 1989\nand Allen 2004 [2020].) Clitomachus, at any rate, advocated an\ninterpretation of Carneades\u2019 skepticism that saw his method of\nargument on either side of all philosophical questions as motivated by\nsome sort of commitment to the view that it is irrational to assent to\nanything less than what one knows to be true, and as resulting in a\nsimilar kind of commitment to the view that nothing can be known. And\nit was this interpretation of Carneades that Philo held at the start\nof his Academic career (Numenius fr. 28).\n\nClitomachus defended the consistency of a radical skepticism of this\nsort by denying that assent is necessary for action or belief, as the\nStoics had claimed in their inactivity objection to the Academic\ncorollary argument\n (section 3.1\n above). His defense came in two stages, both appealing to arguments\nCarneades had used in response to the Stoic objection. The first stage\nidentified a way to discriminate between our thoughts without\nappealing to their objective status as true or as\n\u201ccognitive\u201d impressions (see Cicero Ac.\n2.98\u201399, cf. 2.32). Here Clitomachus drew on Carneades\u2019\n\u201ctheory of probable [or, better, \u2018persuasive\u2019\n(pithanon)] impressions\u201d\u2014i.e., the description of\nordinary epistemic procedures that Carneades promoted as an\nalternative to the Stoic theory of cognitive impressions (see Sextus\nM\u00a07. 166\u201389 and Allen 1994). In ordinary life,\nCarneades argued, we proceed without assuming that a set of what the\nStoics call impressions is \u201ccognitive\u201d or immediately\nwarranted to be true. Rather, some \u201cimpressions\u201d leave us\nwith no immediate inclination to accept them, while some strike us as\nsubjectively \u201cpersuasive\u201d, at least initially, owing to\ntheir internal characteristics (e.g., the richness of their\nrepresentation). We can increase or diminish the initial\npersuasiveness of our impressions by considering the perceptual\nconditions under which we experience them (e.g., normal perceptual\nconditions for perceiving the state of affairs they represent), and\ntheir fit with our other impressions (e.g., normal coherence\nconditions). And we accept and act on impressions when they reach the\nlevel of persuasiveness we find appropriate to the situation we are\nin. But, Clitomachus insisted, none of these procedures is sufficient\nto establish that an impression is true or \u201ccognitive\u201d,\nsince, as the Academics have argued, the representational features of\nany true impression can always be replicated by a false one. (See\nCicero Ac. 2.98\u201399.) And there is no reason to think\nthat in ordinary life we assume that the procedures are sufficient\n(see Plutarch Common Conceptions ch. 36).\n\nThis first stage gives the Academic a procedure that allows for\ndiscrimination between impressions while preserving the Academic\nthesis that nothing can be known. The second stage of\nClitomachus\u2019 defense drew on Carneades\u2019 criticisms of the\nStoic unitary notion of assent as simply a matter of taking an\nimpression (or its content) to be true. Carneades had argued that this\nfails to account for the complexity of our cognitive life: many of our\nactions are not the product of distinct acts of assent, but are rather\nunconscious, or habitual, like animal action; and we sometimes\ndeliberately act without assent, for instance, when we follow\nunendorsed hypotheses or act in conditions of uncertainty (see Bett\n1990). On the basis of considerations of this sort, Clitomachus argued\nthat we should distinguish \u201cassenting\u201d to an impression,\nin the Stoic sense of taking it to be true, from\n\u201capproving\u201d an impression, in the sense of acting on it or\naccepting it as if it were true. (See Cicero Ac.\n2.104.)\n\nThis second stage gives the Academics a way of accepting impressions\nand acting on them that preserves the thesis that rationality demands\nthat one should always suspend assent. Thus, by combining both stages,\nClitomachus was able to argue that the Academic is free to\n\u201cfollow\u201d or \u201capprove\u201d persuasive impressions\nwithout assenting to them: the Academic has a \u201cpractical\ncriterion\u201d that allows for action without presupposing the\ncognitive access to objective truth required for rational assent\n(Sextus M\u00a07. 166; cf. Cicero Ac. 2.108).\nClitomachus, however, did not restrict the application of this\n\u201cpractical\u201d criterion to cases of ordinary action\n(pace G\u00f6rler 1994). He also explicitly claimed that it\ngave the radical skeptics a means to explain their philosophical\nactivities, i.e., their arguments and views (Cicero Ac.\n2.104; cf. 2.32). He was thus in a position to explain the\nAcademics\u2019 apparent commitment to the theses that assent is\nirrational and knowledge is unattainable. These are views that the\nradical skeptic finds \u201cpersuasive\u201d; but they are not\n\u201cbeliefs\u201d, at least not in the Stoic sense, because the\nAcademic does not take them to be true.\n\nOne might plausibly question whether Carneades\u2019 resistance to\n(straightforward Stoic) assent was the \u201cheroic\u201d defense of\nrationality against opinion and error Clitomachus took it to be\n(Cicero Ac. 2.108). It remains very controversial whether\nthere is a coherent distinction to be made between approving a view\nand assenting to its truth (see the wider discussion in Burnyeat &\nFrede [ed.] 1998). But a case can be made that acts of pretense,\nimagination, and supposition require taking on views in a manner\ndistinct from that of belief and that the rational activities of the\nradical skeptic are founded on supposition (see Striker 1980 [1996];\nBett 1990; Reinhardt 2018). Another way to support the distinction is\nto note that the process of arguing for and against a thesis, in the\nway Carneades did, can leave one stuck with a view one way or the\nother, but without being aware of any rational ground for preferring\nthis view. After constant repetition of this process, one can see how\nthe Academics might have come to have the view that their views or\n\u201cbeliefs\u201d are all non-rational in the specific sense that\nthey were not actively formed in accordance with the explicit criteria\nof rationality advocated by the dogmatic philosophers. And if they\nremained committed\u2014in the same attenuated or\n\u201cnon-rational\u201d sense\u2014to the Socratic ideal of\ninerrant knowledge, one can see why they might try to preserve their\nrationality by not giving their assent to the views they found\nthemselves holding. A case along these lines is made in Brittain 2005\n[2008]. Philo, at any rate, initially agreed with Clitomachus that\nCarneades\u2019 ability to maintain something like these critical\nstances towards all beliefs\u2014his own as well as the theories of\nhis philosophical opponents\u2014represented a paradigm of\nself-conscious rationality (see Numenius fr. 28).\n",
