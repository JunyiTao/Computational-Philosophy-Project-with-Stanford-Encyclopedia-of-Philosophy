    "main_text": "Individual essences and bare identities || Forbes on individual essences and bare identities\n4.2 Forbes on individual essences and bare identities\n\nAnother type of argument for the conclusion that unless things have\nnon-trivial individual essences there will be \u2018bare\u2019\ntransworld identities: identities that do not supervene on (are not\ngrounded in) other facts, is presented by Graeme Forbes. (Strictly\nspeaking, Forbes is concerned to avoid identities that are not\ngrounded in what he calls \u2018intrinsic\u2019 properties.) A\nsketch of a type of argument used by Forbes is this. (What follows is\nbased on Forbes 1985, Ch. 6; see also Mackie 2006, Ch. 3.) Suppose (as\nis surely plausible) that an actually existing oak tree could have\nbeen different in some respects from the way that it is; suppose also\nthat, even if it has some essential properties (perhaps it is\nessentially an oak tree, for example), it has no non-trivial\nindividual essence consisting in some set of its intrinsic properties.\nThen there is the danger that there may be three possible worlds (call\nthem \u2018w2\u2019,\n\u2018w3\u2019, and\n\u2018w4\u2019), where in w2\nthere is an oak tree that is identical with the original tree\n(w2 representing one way in which the tree could\nhave been different), and in w3 there is an oak\ntree that is identical with the original tree (w3\nrepresenting another way in which the tree could have been different),\nand in w4 there are two oak trees, one of\nwhich is an intrinsic duplicate of the tree as it is in\nw2, and the other an intrinsic duplicate of the\ntree as it is in w3. If all of\nw2, w3, and\nw4 are possible, then, given that at least one of\nthe trees in w4 is not identical with the original\ntree (since two things cannot be identical with one thing) there are\ninstances of transworld identity (and transworld distinctness)\nconcerning a tree in one possible world and a tree in another that are\nnot grounded in (do not supervene on) the intrinsic features that\nthose trees possess in those possible worlds. For example, suppose\nthat, of the two trees in w4, the intrinsic\nduplicate of the w2 tree is not identical\nwith the original tree. Then, obviously, the distinctness\n(non-identity) between this w4 tree and the tree\nin w2 is not grounded in the intrinsic features\nthat the trees have in w2 and\nw4\u2014and nor is the identity between the tree\nin w2 and the original tree grounded in the\nintrinsic features that the tree has in w2 and in\nthe actual world.\n\nForbes argues that, in order to avoid this (and similar) consequences,\nwe should suppose that (contrary to the second assumption used in\nsetting up the \u2018reduplication argument\u2019 sketched above)\nthe oak tree does have a non-trivial individual essence\nconsisting in some of its intrinsic properties, and his favoured\ncandidate for its essence is one that includes the tree\u2019s coming\nfrom the particular acorn from which it actually originated. If the\ntree does have such an \u2018intrinsic\u2019 individual essence,\nthen, if w2 and w3\nare both possible, each of them must contain a tree that has (in that\nworld) intrinsic properties that are guaranteed to be\nsufficient for identity with the original tree, in which case\n(as a matter of logic) there can be no world such as\nw4 that contains intrinsic duplicates of both of\nthem. (See Forbes 1985, Ch. 6, and, for discussion, Mackie 1987;\nMackie 2006; Robertson 1998; Yablo 1988; Chihara 1998; Della Rocca\n1996; further discussions by Forbes include his 1986, 1994, and\n2002.)\n\nFinally, it is obvious that the structure of Forbes\u2019s argument\nhas nothing to do with the fact that the chosen example is a tree.\nForbes\u2019s \u2018reduplication argument\u2019 therefore appears\nto pose a general problem for the characterization of de re\nmodal statements about individuals in terms of transworld identity:\neither we must admit that their transworld identities can be\n\u2018bare\u2019, or we must find non-trivial individual essences,\nbased on their intrinsic properties, that can ground their identities\nacross possible worlds.\n",
