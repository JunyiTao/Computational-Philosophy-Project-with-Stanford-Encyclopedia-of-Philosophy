However, a number of thorny ethical issues can arise during\nthe course of a continuing pregnancy, labor, and birth, and these are\nreceiving growing attention in bioethics. This article is restricted\nto a discussion of such issues. See the entries on\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the grounds of moral status\n for discussions of related issues such as abortion and assisted\nreproduction.\n\nPregnancy and birth can be approached from many philosophical angles.\nPregnancy raises interesting issues in philosophy of law, such as the\nappropriate legal status of the fetus and whether pregnancy ought to\nbe legally classified as a disability. Some authors have discussed\npregnancy in phenomenological terms, and others have used pregnancy\nand/or birth as a springboard for more theoretical reflections on the\nnature of selfhood, care, embodiment, and personal identity. In this\narticle, however, we will focus on pregnancy and birth insofar as they\nare treated as medical processes and situated within a\nmedical context. (The boundary around this topic is necessarily\nimperfect, since medical, legal, metaphysical, experiential, and other\ncontexts intersect. For instance, one cannot responsibly examine the\nethics of treating the fetus as a medical patient without at\nleast considering the legal ramifications of doing so.) For better or\nfor worse, in most developed countries, including the United States\nand Canada, normal pregnancy and birth are highly\n\u2018medicalized\u2019. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for women\nto experience problems during pregnancy that require medical care and\nintervention. The medical management of both \u2018normal\u2019\npregnancies and those that face complications raises a variety of\ncomplex ethical issues, and these will be our topic.\n\nWe will begin with a general discussion of pregnancy and childbirth as\nmedicalized processes. We will then move on to three categories of\nethical issues: (1) issues arising in the course of obstetrical care\nfor women who are taken to be competent and capable of autonomous\ndecision-making; (2) issues that arise when women are decisionally\nincompetent or when their right to decisional autonomy is in question;\n(3) issues concerning the management and communication of reproductive\nrisk.\n", "toc": [{"#Medi": "1.

Medicalization\n\nPregnancy and childbirth have become increasingly medicalized\nin most parts of the world since the early twentieth century. That is,\nthey are increasingly processes that\u2014in fact and as a social\nideal\u2014are managed and overseen by medical professionals,\ntypically involve a high degree of technological medical intervention\nand contact with clinics and hospitals, and are assessed by medical\nexperts who are the authorities on their progress. Amy Mullin explains\nthat medicalized pregnancy \u201cinvolves interpreting pregnancy\nitself as a disruption to health that necessarily requires expert\nmedical intervention, and thinking of pregnancy as primarily about\nhealth and illness\u201d (Mullin 2005, 54). The concept of\nmedicalization is helpful in making clear how this sort of insertion\ninto a medical context is not (or not simply) a response to fixed\nbiological facts, but rather a contingent social and institutional\nprocess. Death, depression, and short attention span are other\nexamples of processes or conditions that have undergone intense\nmedicalization. In general, medicalization comes with both benefits\nand burdens, and the medicalization of pregnancy and birth is no\nexception. Increasingly few obstetricians would claim that intense\nmedicalization straightforwardly promotes good birth outcomes for\nmothers and infants; rather, almost all would acknowledge that while\nmedical interventions have lessened many risks (e.g. death from\nplacenta previa and ectopic pregnancy), other medical interventions\nhave become routine despite having no proven benefit and some proven\nadded risks for patients (e.g. routine fetal monitoring, normalization\nof the lithotomy position for childbirth, and episiotomies). Partly\nbecause of these mixed effects of increased medicalization, opposing\nnarratives of pregnancy and birth continue to grow in visibility and\nsupport. These narratives may aim to de-medicalize the notion of\nnormalcy in pregnancy and birth, or centralize the knowledge and\ncompetence of midwifery (e.g., Lyerly 2012; Shaw 2013)\n\nThe medicalization of pregnancy and birth takes many forms. North\nAmerican births typically involve a variety of technological\ninterventions, regularly including labor-inducing drugs, spinal\nepidurals, fetal monitoring, and\u2014in roughly one third of\nbirths\u2014surgical delivery. Prior to birth, most pregnancies will\ninvolve medical interventions such as genetic testing, ultrasound\nscreening, prescriptions to control various symptoms and risks,\nand\u2014with increasing frequency\u2014technological assistance for\nconception. Importantly, however, the rate and intensity with which\nsuch interventions are offered or imposed is far from uniform. Dorothy\nRoberts highlights the striking disparity of benefits enjoyed as a\nresult of medicalization: \"The multibillion-dollar apparatus devoted\nto technologically facilitating affluent couples' procreative\ndecisions stands in glaring contrast to the high rate of infant death\namong black people, which remains more than twice the rate for whites\"\n(2009, 784, citing Mathews and MacDorman 2007). Some dimensions of the\nmedicalization of pregnancy do not directly involve medical\ninterventions. Both inside and outside the clinic, pregnancy is\ntreated as a medical event requiring intense risk management,\nmonitoring, and appeals to expert medical knowledge: pregnant women\nare expected to regulate and monitor their eating, drinking, fetal\nkicks, weight gain, sleeping position, emotions, exposure to basic\nhousehold products, exercise, sexual activity, and many other aspects\nof their lives according to standards established by medical\nprofessionals (Kukla 2005). Recently, there has been a vigorous\nmandate to involve medical professionals in helping women regulate\ntheir bodies in accordance with medical standards for minimizing\nreproductive risk even prior to conception. The CDC now recommends\nthat all primary care for all women who may\neventually become pregnant (including prepubescent girls) be treated\nas \u2018preconception care\u2019 (Kuehn 2006). A majority of women\nembrace at least some aspects of medicalization; many take it as part\nof responsible motherhood to maximize the expert management of their\npregnancies and to follow risk-minimization advice carefully (Seigel\n2013).\n\nThe general trend towards medicalizing pregnancy and birth has had\nseveral ethically noteworthy effects (Davis-Floyd 2004, Duden 1993,\nMitchell 2001, Morgan 1998, Sherwin 1992). First, medicalization has\nencouraged us to imagine pregnancy and birth as inherently high-risk,\npathological processes that it is irresponsible to undertake without\nlarge amounts of expert help and surveillance. Second, when medical\nprofessionals become the primary managers of reproduction, pregnant\nwomen's epistemic privilege is undermined and they are arguably\nreduced to playing passive roles in their own pregnancies and births\n(e.g., Freeman 2015). Third, some have argued that medicalization has\nrendered pregnancy in general, and labor and birth in particular, more\nalienating and stressful for women, burdening them with constant and\ncomplicated responsibilities for elaborate risk management and bodily\nand behavioral surveillance (for review see, e.g., Mykitiuk and Scott\n2011; Savell 2012).\n\nAmong the voices pushing back against the medicalization of\nreproduction are those that insist that pregnancy is a\n\u2018natural\u2019 process that generally needs no technological\nassistance, and advocate \u2018natural\u2019 childbirth, free of\nlabor-inducing and pain medications and attended by midwives rather\nthan doctors. There are reasons for philosophers to be as wary of the\n\u2018natural\u2019 birth movement as of uncritical, unchecked\nmedicalization (Kukla 2005, Lyerly 2006 and 2012, Purdy 2001).\nTypically, its advocates do not specify a clear concept of the\n\u2018natural\u2019\u2014for example, they have no account of why\nprescription pain medications are \u2018unnatural\u2019 while\nacupuncture or pain-relieving herbs are \u2018natural\u2019. Nor do\nthey explain why the \u2018natural\u2019 is prima facie\nbetter or more ethical. More broadly, this account of pregnancy and\nbirth involves comparable pressures on pregnant women to conform to\nrigid standards of attitudes and behaviours, and, like the medicalized\naccount, is in danger of de-politicizing and essentializing the\nexperience and management of pregnant women (Beckett 2005, Malacrida\nand Boulton 2014).\n\nFrank Chervenak and Laurence McCullough (2006) contrast\nmedicalization, not with an absence of technological interventions,\nbut with the co-option of these technological interventions by the\nnon-medical sphere of commodification. They focus on the upsurge in\n\u201cboutique\u201d fetal ultrasound centers that offer expectant\nparents \u201cpictures of the baby\u201d, without any pretence that\nthese pictures serve a diagnostic medical role. They argue that such\nnon-medical, social imaging is ethically unacceptable, as it raises\nconcerns about informed consent, psychosocial risks to women, false\nsenses of security in the health of the baby, and economic conflicts\nof interest. They conclude that medical professionals ought to retain\ncontrol and authority over the use and interpretation of fetal imaging\ntechnology. Their argument could easily be extended to other\ntechnologies used in obstetrics.\n\nYet Chervenak and McCullough may overestimate the authority that\nmedical professionals are generally able to exercise over the meaning\nand use of technology. For instance, ultrasound imaging is already\nviewed by pregnant women as playing much more of a social than a\nmedical role; whether it occurs in a medical clinic or at a boutique\nparlour, it is primarily understood as the first opportunity to\n\u201cmeet the baby\u201d, and women are caught off guard when this\nevent yields substantive medical information (Mitchell 2001, Kukla\n2005a). All the same, their argument raises an important point: the\nalternative to medicalized pregnancy is not, in practice,\n\u2018natural\u2019 pregnancy. Instead, medicine is one institution\namong many that vies for control over the cultural use and\nsignificance of this technology, and pregnancy is likely to continue\nto be technologically intensive no matter how his struggle plays\nout.\n2. Ethical Issues in Obstetrical Care\n\nIn this section, we examine ethical issues that can arise in the\ncourse of obstetrical care for women whose decisional autonomy and\ncompetence are not in question.\n2.1 Prenatal Diagnosis and Screening\n\nIt is becoming increasingly routine to test fetuses for a variety of\ngenetic and other anomalies. Ultrasound screening for various\nmorphological anomalies and the Maternal Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Test\n(MSAFP) that screens for trisomy chromosomal disorders such as Down\nsyndrome are routine parts of prenatal care; indeed, ultrasound\nscreening does not even require formal informed consent from patients.\nOther tests such as amniocentesis (which diagnoses rather than screens\nfor trisomy disorders) and genetic testing for Tay-Sachs disease are\ncommon. More arcane tests are available, and it seems clear that the\nrange of conditions and traits for which prenatal testing is possible\nwill continue to grow rapidly. The rise in prenatal testing allows\nparents and society at large new forms of control over what sorts of\nchildren are born, and it enhances the level of medicalization and\nsurveillance during pregnancy. These tests raise a variety of ethical\nissues.\n2.1.1 Issues for Pregnant Women\n\nBecause all prenatal testing is, strictly speaking, voluntary (even if\nroutinization and social pressures together may guide women towards\nchoosing it), and because the tests give prospective parents a form of\nincreased control over their reproductive lives, many writers have\nseen the advent of prenatal testing as straightforwardly enhancing\nwomen's reproductive autonomy. For instance, John Robertson (1996) has\nargued that women should have access to any technologically available\nprenatal test as part of their right to reproductive autonomy and\nprivacy. On his account, reproductive autonomy rights cover not only\nwhen and whether and how we reproduce, but what kind of child\nwe have, and the availability of prenatal tests increases this\nautonomy.\n\nThere are reasons to doubt, however, that increased access to prenatal\ntesting translates directly into an increase in women's autonomy. For\nexample, soon after Robertson argued for women's autonomous control\nover which tests they use, Julian Savulescu appealed to what he dubbed\nthe principle of \u201cprocreative beneficence\u201d in order to\nargue that pregnant women are morally required to utilize\navailable tests for serious fetal anomalies (and to abort fetuses with\nthese anomalies), because they are required to select the child, of\nthe possible children they could have, who is expected to have the\nbest possible life given the available information (Savulescu 2001,\n2007; Savuelescu and Kahane 2009). Others argue that reasons to select\nfor the best possible children extend beyond concern for the\nwell-being of the potential child herself to the well-being of others\n(Douglas and Devolder 2013, Elster 2011).\n\nPrenatal screening and diagnosis does not, at the very least,\nobviously or in principle operate to enhance free choices for women.\nVirtually all women undergo routine ultrasound testing and accept\nMSAFP testing when it is offered to them. Nancy Press and Carole\nBrowner (1995) have used qualitative evidence to argue that women tend\nto see the choice to accept MSAFP tests as the\n\u201cresponsible\u201d choice that \u201cprotects the\nhealth\u201d of their babies, even though the only intervention\navailable in the case of a positive test is abortion. When a test\nbecomes routine and medically legitimized, choosing against it can be\ndifficult. In light of such considerations, Press and Browner and\nothers have questioned the extent to which choices to test are really\ninformed and autonomous, and whether women are really prepared for\nmaking the difficult decisions that they may confront after testing.\nMany authors have also pointed out that as testing and abortion for\nfetal anomalies becomes more common, women who choose not to test, or\nwho choose to carry an impaired fetus to term, may face diminished\nsupport and increased blame for their choice (see for instance Lawson\n2003). Thus the availability and routinization of prenatal testing may\ncompromise women's autonomy in some ways while increasing it in\nothers.\n\nSeveral authors have pointed out that increased routine medical\nsurveillance during pregnancy has put new pressure on women to\nshoulder the responsibility for producing socially acceptable,\nproductive citizens, and for disciplining their own bodies and laying\nthem open to medical intervention and surveillance in accordance with\nthis goal (Tremain 2006, Kukla 2005, Roberts 2009). Prenatal testing\njoins forces with a host of other cultural pressures to portray\npregnancy as an inherently risky and perilous process (Duden 1993). It\ncan create unrealistic pressures on women to emotionally bond with or\ndisengage from their fetuses on cue (Kukla 2007a, Kukla 2008, Mitchell\n2001), and to keep their relationship to the pregnancy\n\u2018tentative\u2019 until tests come back negative (Katz-Rothman\n1993).\n2.1.2 Issues for Future Children\n\nA variety of ethical concerns have been raised with respect to how\nprenatal testing may impact future children. Some authors worry that\nprenatal testing helps to inculcate an inappropriate stance towards\nparenting: perhaps parents will come to desire or expect\n\u201cdesigner children\u201d built to their specifications, and\nthis may translate into an overly controlling attitude towards their\nchildren later in life, or an expectation that children will match an\nadvance set of idealized expectations about what they will be like\n(Rothschild 2005, Introduction to Parens and Asch 2000). A related\nconcern is that when carrying pregnancy to term becomes conditional\nupon the fetus having certain traits, our love for our children once\nthey are born may become similarly conditional. Most broadly,\nquestions regarding how prenatal screening and testing impacts the\nwell-being of future children remain unresolved. At the moment, almost\nall prenatal testing screens or diagnoses well-defined medical\ndisorders such as Down syndrome and Tay-Sachs disease. Ethical\nconcerns will likely become yet more acute as the technology develops,\nparticularly if it extends to testing for traits that are not clearly\ndisorders, such as homosexuality, aggression, or a propensity to\nobesity.\n\nPrenatal testing is often presented, in medical practice and in some\nbioethical literature, as protecting the well-being of children. It is\noften argued that it is wrong to bring a child with a disability into\nthe world if we can prevent doing so (i.e. Savulescu 2001 and 2007,\nDavis 2001). However, this claim faces the much discussed\n\u201cnonidentity problem\u201d, which was introduced by Derek\nParfit (1976, 1984) and adapted to the reproductive ethics context by\nmany authors (e.g., Steinbock 2009, Wasserman 2005, Brock 1996) (see\nthe entry on \u201cThe Nonidentity Problem\u201d). In short, the\nproblem is that you cannot harm a non-existent person by bringing it\ninto existence, unless the person's life is so dreadful that\nnonexistence is preferable. That life with a disability or chronic\nillness is predictably worse than non-existence is not plausible for\nmost of the defects for which we test\u2014notably including Down\nsyndrome, which is the most common target for testing and abortion.\nSome philosophers take an antinatalist stance and argue that human\nlife in general is prima facie worse than non-existence (e.g., Benatar\n2006), but it is a far more widely held stance that bringing a child\ninto existence does not typically count as harming that child.\n\nThis may sound like a straightforward point, but it leads quickly to\nresults that many find philosophically puzzling or implausible. For\nexample, if a woman is carrying twins and requires a selective\nabortion, and one of the fetuses is known to have a serious anomaly\nwhile the other does not, many people feel it would be cruel to choose\nto keep the fetus with the anomaly. And yet, the fetus with the\nanomaly does not itself have the option of becoming an anomaly-free\nchild; it will either become a child with a disability or not exist at\nall. We can be doing this child no harm by choosing it over its\nhealthy twin, and its twin, if it counts as a being that can be harmed\nat all by being aborted, is not harmed in any extra way in virtue of\nhaving a twin who will live with an anomaly. Even more\ncounterintuitively: imagine that a woman is taking a medication that\nis almost sure to cause substantial limb deformities if she gets\npregnant while taking it, but that leaves her system completely within\n24 hours. Imagine also that she takes her last dose on Tuesday\nmorning. She wants a child, and finds herself with an opportunity to\nhave unprotected sex on Tuesday evening. She will have the same\nopportunity on Wednesday. If she has sexual intercourse and conceives\non Tuesday, her child will almost certainly suffer from limb\ndeformities. If she waits 24 hours, her child suffers no unusual\nrisks. Most of us feel that it would be callous and unethical of her\nto have unprotected sex on Tuesday. But why, exactly? Any child she\nconceives on Tuesday will have limb deformities, but its other\n\u2018option\u2019 is nonexistence, and limb deformities, while\nburdensome perhaps, certainly don't make a life not worth living. She\ndoes not wrong the child by having unprotected sex on\nTuesday. Nor does she harm any nonexistent child that she might have\nbrought into existence, limbs intact, on Wednesday, for you cannot\nharm a nonexistent being. Variations on this problem and its practical\nand theoretical implications have been widely discussed and continue\nto feature in heated debates in bioethics (e.g., Boonin 2014, McMillan\n2014, Jecker 2012)\n\nIndeed, even going out of one's way to create a disabled child\n(through genetic engineering, selective abortion, or preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis) cannot count as harming the child, since that\nparticular child has no options for existing other than as disabled.\n(This issue has most often come up with respect to deaf parents, who\nsometimes prefer to have a deaf child, e.g. in Wasserman and Asch\n2012). And yet, many writers have the strong intuition that\nintentionally creating a disabled child is a wrong done to the\nchild\u2014for instance, Dena Davis (2001) argues that since\ndisabilities generally close down possible ways of living,\nintentionally creating a disabled child violates the child's right to\nan open future. The non-identity problem forces us to search for an\nexplanation of what sort of wronging or rights violation this could\nbe, given that this child could have no non-disabled future\nopen to her to start with.\n\nResponses to the non-identity problem, then, may conclude that (1)\nindeed there is no wrong done by bringing someone into the world in a\nway that compromises her opportunities for flourishing (Heyd 2009), or\nthat (2) the wrong involved is not one done to the\nchild\u2014for instance, it might be wrong on roughly\nconsequentialist grounds (Brock 1995), because it promotes problematic\nvalues or reflects unacceptable motivations (Kumar 2003), or because\nit fails to promote the interests of an alternative possible child\n(Holtug 2009), or (3) that the non-identity problem is illusory, and\nthat someone can indeed be harmed by being brought into existence\n(Benatar 2006, Harman 2004). As Roberts and Wasserman (2009) note,\ndifferent strategies for resolving the non-identity problem emerge\nfrom different accounts of harm\u2014e.g. as concerning states of\naffairs, or as (uniquely) concerning identifiable\nindividuals\u2014and will therefore have distinctive implications for\nobligations of beneficence and non-maleficence in reproduction. For\nsome commentators, however, debate surrounding the non-identity\nproblem carries tenuous import for real-life procreative\ndecision-making, and offers little help to prospective parents in\naddressing the ethical challenges associated with reproduction (e.g.\nOverall 2012, 154). A strategy for addressing the non-identity\nproblem, then, is not equivalent to a strategy for addressing the\nchallenges of harms and benefits to future children for prospective\nparents. (See the entry on\n parenthood and procreation\n for further discussion). \n2.1.3 Social Concerns\n\nMany have worried that the increasing routinization of prenatal\ntesting is tantamount to eugenics. As the term is paradigmatically\nused, eugenics involves an intentional, top-down planned social\nprogram for engineering an entire population so as to eliminate or\npropagate particular traits. John Robertson (1996, 2003), who defends\na strong version of the right to procreative liberty, defends prenatal\ntesting against charges that it should be understood as ethically\nequivalent to eugenics by emphasizing the role of individual,\nautonomous parental choices in controlling this technology. Likewise,\nthose supporting a moral obligation to have children with the best\npossible lives using available technological means tend to\nsimultaneously emphasize the individual, personal nature of\nprocreative decision-making (Mills 2011). Yet some doubt that any\ngenuine procreative freedom is preserved when prenatal testing is\ntreated as required (e.g., Sparrow 2011). Moreover, many have argued\nthat as our culture increasingly values and takes for granted the\npower to control whether our offspring have particular traits, a kind\nof bottom-up eugenics will be instituted. Declining control and\naccepting devalued traits in our children will become a less socially\nacceptable choice for prospective parents, and some homogenization of\nthe gene pool and elimination of diversity will emerge regardless of\nwhether this is anyone's planned agenda (Tremain 2006, Rothschild\n2005). Furthermore, while individual parents may be free to decide\nwhether or not to avail themselves of tests, which tests we make\navailable will almost surely reflect and entrench existing social\nnorms that tell us what count as valuable and disvaluable traits\n(Sparrow 2007). Thus, the argument goes, individual decisions to use\nthese tests will collectively instantiate a eugenic project of\ndesigning a population that reflects these values, even if this\nproject does not belong to any centralized intentional agent. On the\nother hand, it seems that we already engage in such\n\u2018bottom-up\u2019 eugenics by taking steps to have children with\nvalued traits: pregnant women take folic acid in order to avoid having\na child with Spina Bifida, we try to find successful and attractive\nmates, and so forth (Mahowold 2002). Hence we need to settle whether\nmaking prenatal testing widely available introduces eugenics in a new\nand problematic way, and if so, whether this worry is sufficient to\noverride its advantages.\n\nThere are additional reasons to worry about the distortion of the gene\npool that may result from long-term, routine prenatal testing. In a\nclassic paper, \u201cMoral Issues in Human Genetics\u201d, Ruth\nMacklin (1977) points out that homogenizing or otherwise manipulating\nthe gene pool may have dangerous effects that we do not presently\nunderstand and can't foresee. We don't know enough about how specific\ngenes and mutations work to understand how they may be advantageous or\ndisadvantageous at the population level. Furthermore, in eliminating a\nparticular individual with some specific trait, we might be\naccidentally eliminating someone who has other traits that would have\nmade her an exceptionally valuable member of society and contributor\nto the gene pool. (What if we had selectively aborted Abraham Lincoln\nin virtue of his Marfan syndrome, she asks? The fact that Lincoln\nprobably did not have Marfan syndrome is beside the point.)\n\nAssuming that we believe that some, but not all, prenatal tests should\ncontinue to be available, at least in certain circumstances, we need\nto ask a host of more specific questions. We need to decide which\ntraits and conditions we ought to be testing for (perhaps\nincurable and painful life-shortening diseases such as Tay-Sachs;\nperhaps a broader set of traits) and which traits it is\npermissible to test for (perhaps less serious conditions such\nas Down syndrome and Huntington's disease; perhaps a wide variety of\nnon-medical traits). We need to settle which, if any, of these tests\nwill be covered by insurance (as prenatal testing for Down syndrome,\nultrasound screening, and other tests currently are), and how we want\nto manage the consequences of prenatal testing for later insurability.\nWe need to decide whether procreative liberty and privacy rights give\nparents the right to test their fetuses for what we might consider\nmorally unacceptable reasons\u2014for example, in order to abort\ntheir fetus if it has a \u2018gay gene\u2019, should such a thing be\ndiscovered. We also need to consider the consequences of prenatal\ntesting for genes that probabilistically raise the risk of developing\na condition (such as obesity or breast cancer) rather than determining\nthat it will be present. Finally, we must decide how we will manage\nand control the genetic information that results from prenatal tests,\nwhich can have significant consequences for other, genetically related\nfamily members who might have a strong stake in knowing or in\nnot knowing this information. All of these questions are receiving\nvigorous discussion in bioethics; disagreements have pervaded\ndiscussions among scholars, health care practitioners, and disability\nadvocates. (A classic source that discusses all the above issues is\nBuchanan et al. 2000. Other widely cited authors and collections\ncontributing to these discussions include Harris 2010 and Shakespeare\n2006.)\n2.1.4 The Disability Rights Critique of Prenatal Testing\n\nThe disability critique of prenatal testing constitutes a large,\nloosely bound cluster of arguments that draw upon disability rights\ntheory and activism in order to critically question the increased\nroutinization of prenatal testing and selective abortion (Asch and\nWasserman 2015, Parens and Asch 2000). In general terms, the\ndisability rights critique raises the worry that prenatal testing and\nselective abortion risk further stigmatizing disabled people, reducing\nthem to a single defining trait, and harming disability communities.\nIt points out that the offer of a prenatal test for a\nparticular trait is never neutral, but rather implies that a\nreasonable person might wish to know whether her fetus has this trait,\nand that this information might reasonably be the basis for a decision\nnot to continue the pregnancy. Although many contributors to the\ndisability rights critique of prenatal testing consider themselves\nfirmly in favor of general abortion rights, they share at least a\nprima facie worry about the ethics of aborting fetuses on the\nbasis of tests for future disability.\n\nThe disability critique of prenatal testing encompasses at least five\ntypes of arguments:\n\n\n\nEntrenchment of the Medical Model of Disability\n\nDisability theorists have most visibly distinguished between the\nmedical and the social model of disability, but sometimes use related\nlabels such as the metaphysical, the biological, and the political\nmodel of disability (for discussion see, e.g., Scully 2008,\nShakespeare and Watson 2001). According to the medical model, a\ndisability is a pathology or impairment of an individual body, in\nvirtue of which the disabled person is less able to perform various\nfunctions than the able-bodied person. Accordingly, since it is the\njob of medicine to fix bodies or at least minimize the undesirable\neffects of their medical conditions, it is appropriate for doctors to\nfix or mitigate disability when they can (Saxton 2000). According to\nthe social model, on the other hand, disability is inherently a\nrelational property: it concerns a more problematic than\nnormal fit between a body and its social and material environment.\nDisabilities are historically specific and context-dependent (Tremain\n2001). Someone who used a wheelchair in an environment in which\nall spaces accessible to any normal person are wheelchair\naccessible, the argument goes, would be no more disabled than is a\nresident of a sprawling American suburb who cannot obtain food or make\na living without driving her car. Myopia was a serious, even a\nlife-threatening disability in the hunter-gatherer era, but in the age\nof easily accessible effective eyeglasses most of us never even think\nto conceptualize our myopia as a disability.\n\nIf disability is a relational misfit between body and environment,\nthen mitigating or eliminating disability can be accomplished by\nchanging the body, the environment, or both. On this view, making\nspaces accessible to people with different means of mobility, ensuring\nthat everyone has access to text-based communication options, and\nworking to remove social stigmas concerning abnormal anatomy, for\nexample, literally lessen or remove disabilities such as mobility\nimpairment, deafness, and cleft palate rather than merely\naccommodating them. (This is not to say that all disabilities\nare such that we could design an environment that would substantially\nmitigate them.) In the proper environment, what might otherwise be a\ndisability can just be a difference, a human variation that can\nenhance the diversity of our culture (Wendell 1996). Once we accept\nthis, then we are faced with a choice when it comes to managing a\nparticular disability: we can try to change bodies, social and\nmaterial environments, or a combination of these, and it is an open\nquestion in each case which is the most effective and ethical\napproach.\n\nThe routinization of prenatal testing arguably institutionalizes the\nidea that disability is a medical condition detected at the level of\nthe individual body. Furthermore, insofar as the standard response to\nprenatal testing is abortion, it entrenches the practice of\n\u2018fixing\u2019 disability through a medical\nintervention\u2014specifically, the extreme intervention of simply\neliminating the disabled body. According to the disability rights\ncritique, this limits our ability to imagine addressing and\nalleviating disability at the social level. Yet in at least some\ncases, social approaches to disability have proven enormously\neffective. Consider Down syndrome, which is the main condition for\nwhich prenatal testing has become routine: Due to increased\nintegration into families and schools, better support and education,\nchanging expectations, and other social changes, people with Down\nsyndrome now often have life spans and a level of independence and\neducational achievement that were inconceivable fifty years ago.\nMoreover, as Sophia Isako Wong illustrates, the social model's\nencouragement of integration, understanding, and acceptance may have\nsignificant positive impacts on non-disabled individuals, and on\ncommunities more generally (2002). Thus disability theorists and\nadvocates urge us to reject the assumption that prenatal testing and\nabortion should be the default \u2018solution\u2019 to\ndisability. \n\n\nWeakening the Disability Community\n\nTo the extent that prenatal testing and abortion for a particular\ncondition become routinized, there will be fewer people born with that\ncondition. Insofar as prenatal testing and abortion are generally\ncheaper and easier than social interventions, over the long term they\nmay come to be seen as the only responsible and socially supported\noption. This threatens the quality of life and availability of\nresources for those who remain. They may be faced with increased\nstigmatization, less possibility for community, and less tolerance and\nunderstanding. Some commentators, however, deny that things have\ngotten worse for people with disabilities since selective abortion of\nfetuses with impairments has gained popularity (e.g. Overall 2012,\n166). And if efforts to accommodate persons with impairments are\nincreasing, charges against prenatal testing for further weakening and\nmarginalizing the disability community may be complicated if not\ndiminished. Nevertheless, the fruits of those efforts at accommodation\nare not enjoyed equally by all. For instance, the rarer a condition\nis, the less social and political motivation will exist to provide\nresources, support, tailored educational activities, and the like for\nthose who have it. \n\n\nOur Current Counseling Practices Distort Decision-Making\n\nCurrently, a large majority of pregnant women who are offered standard\nprenatal screens and tests accept them, and the majority of those who\nreceive abnormal test results proceed to abort. However, current\ncounseling surrounding the tests does not include any exposure to\npeople who have the tested-for conditions or any discussion of the\nsocial resources available for families with children with the\nconditions. Even supposedly nondirective counseling often uses\nstigmatizing language to talk about disability and the choice not to\nabort a fetus with a disabling trait, and reflects unsupported\nnegative judgments regarding the abilities of and quality of life for\npersons with disabilities (Asch 2000, Madeo et al. 2011). Different\nforms of counseling might enable more informed decision-making and\nyield fewer choices to test and fewer choices to abort after testing.\nFor instance, Bonnie Steinbock (2007) argues that prenatal testing\npractices for some conditions could be geared towards helping parents\nprepare for the birth of a child with that condition, rather than\nframed as preludes to a decision about abortion. In order for\ngenuinely informative and trusting interactions to take place between\ncounselors and prospective parents, however, counselors must be\nequipped with \"disability competencies,\" which involve experience with\ndisabilities and understanding of how various disabilities affect\nlives and families; improving counseling practices will require\nmandatory training in these areas (Sanborn and Patterson 2014).\n\n\n\nThe Expressivist Argument\n\nThis argument holds that prenatal testing, particularly as linked with\nselective abortion, has expressive meaning for\neveryone with that condition. Abby Lippman writes:\n\u201cThat the birth of certain babies should be avoided is announced\nmerely by making testing available\u201d (1994, 24). If we abort a\nfetus on the basis of a single trait, this symbolically suggests that\nnot only this fetus's life but the life of anyone who has\nthis trait is not worth living or preserving. Prenatal genetic\ntesting, as disability rights critics suggest, thus perpetuates and\nreinforces denigrating social attitudes toward persons with\ndisabilities (e.g. Saxton 2000). One might argue that any use\nof prenatal testing for a condition followed by abortion expressively\ndevalues that condition. Or, one might argue that it is the\nroutinization of testing\u2014the practice of checking for a\ncondition and making abortion available as a \u2018normal\u2019 part\nof \u2018responsible\u2019 prenatal care\u2014is what has\nexpressive devaluing significance.\n\nNot all disability theorists agree that prenatal testing does indeed\nsend a discriminatory message, or that it expresses anything specific\nat all (e.g. Malek 2010). James Nelson (2000) tells the story of\nchoosing to get a vasectomy after his third child. He argues it seems\nimplausible to understand his act as having an expressive significance\nthat devalues all fourth-children. Rather, his act may just\n\u2018mean\u2019 that, in context, having a fourth child is not the\nbest choice for his family. Whenever we decide not to have a child, he\nargues, we always do so based on some specific\nfeatures it would have, such as adding to a large family with strained\nresources. Likewise, he claims, choosing not to carry a pregnancy to\nterm after a prenatal test revealing a particular condition may\nreflect a judgment about particular circumstances rather than\nexpressing a general attitude towards people with that condition.\n\nAdrienne Asch (2000) responds that one cannot relevantly compare the\nproperty of being a fourth child to the property of having a specific\ndisabling trait, because the latter is an inherent rather than a\nrelational property of the child. Hence to abort on the basis of the\ndisabling trait is to reject that kind of person in a different and\nstronger way. But Asch's response seems to push against one of the\nmain points of the social model of disability, which she otherwise\ndefends: the view that disabilities are also relational rather than\ninherent properties. More generally, the force of the expressivist\nobjection may rely on a view of disabling traits as identity\nconstituting, thereby endorsing an essentialist understanding of\ndisability (Edwards 2004). For many, it seems possible to decide\nagainst bearing a child who has a property that in context\nwill make that child more difficult to raise (whether it is deafness,\na chromosomal disorder, or fourth-childness), without devaluing all\npeople with that property in any decontextualized way. Notice that\nthis response does not combat the idea that routinization is\nexpressively devaluing of some lives, even if it convinces us that\nindividual uses of the technology are not. \n\n\nParental Attitudes and Responsibilities\n\nSome disability rights critics suggest that prenatal genetic testing\nencourages an inappropriately commodifying and perfectionist approach\nto potential children, and stultifies parental expression of\nunconditional love and commitment (Asch and Wasserman 2005). By\nallowing particular traits to determine reproductive decision-making,\npotential parents adopt an attitude of conditional acceptance that is\ndirectly at odds with the nurturing and devotion children need to\nflourish. Others, however, question the requirement of so-called\nunconditional love, given that this requirement has developed in a\ncontext where mothers are judged by the completeness of their\ncaregiving roles, and where other social factors impeding good care\nand acceptance are ignored (e.g. Gedge 2011).\n\nA familiar concern with the disability critique of prenatal testing is\nthat it asks too much from prospective parents. Even if there are good\nreasons to worry about the impact of widespread testing, it is hard to\ndeny that for many people, given the level of support and acceptance\navailable for families with disabled children, raising a child with a\ndisability can be a serious challenge. Asking parents to take on this\nchallenge so as to promote larger social goals may be unreasonable.\nYet some critics of prenatal testing reject the assumption that\nbearing and raising a child with a disability is inevitably more\nburdensome than raising a non-disabled child. Marsha Saxton, for\ninstance, counters the purportedly feminist endorsement of prenatal\ntesting that casts testing as a protective or even emancipatory tool\nfor women. She argues that it is not disability itself that burdens\nwomen who have disabled children, but rather the unjust circumstances\nof caregiving, where ongoing sacrifices are expected from mothers, and\ncommunity resources and support remain woefully inadequate (2000,\n2006). \n\n\nDisability theorists have worried that it seems nearly impossible, in\npractice, to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable tests.\nNearly all scholars agree that testing for Tay-Sachs or other diseases\nthat lead to a short life filled with intense suffering and no hope of\na cure is ethically acceptable, and nearly all agree that testing for\nvanity traits such as eye color would be unacceptable. But when it\ncomes to deciding which conditions are \u2018serious\u2019 enough to\nwarrant the availability of prenatal tests, there is little agreement.\nAnywhere this line is drawn risks stigmatizing those with\n\u2018serious\u2019 conditions and belittling the challenges faced\nby those with \u2018unserious\u2019 conditions (Parens and Asch\n2000, Introduction). It also risks treating the\n\u2018seriousness\u2019 of a condition as a fixed medical fact\nrather than as a potentially socially malleable state of affairs. This\nis another reason that many scholars and advocates wish to emphasize\nthe stigmatization of particular traits and the layers of social and\neconomic injustice that exacerbate this stigmatization(e.g. Roberts\nand Jesudason 2013, Wasserman 2000).\n2.1.5 Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing\n\nThe recent advancement of so-called non-invasive prenatal testing\n(NIPT) has complicated existing ethical issues and introduced new ones\nin obstetrical care, and some believe that current normative\nframeworks for assessing prenatal testing are ill-equipped to navigate\nthese issues (Schmitz 2013). The past decade has seen enormous changes\nin testing technologies, and non-invasive prenatal testing is a\nstriking example of how rapidly new testing methods translate to\nclinical and commercial enterprise (Skirton and Patch 2013). Most NIPT\ntargets aneuploidy; some tests for monegenic disorders are also sought\nafter but development and clinical uptake of these is relatively slow\n(Chitty and Bianchi 2013).\n\nSeveral ethical concerns piggy back on those associated with prenatal\ntesting generally; for instance, earlier and less risky testing may\nfacilitate selective abortions, encourage the commodification of\nchildren, or, conversely, amplify the coercive technological force of\nprenatal testing as a medical intervention required for responsible\nparenting (de Jong and de Wert 2014). Each of these concerns picks up\non the likelihood of greater routinization of prenatal testing given\nthe tests' non-invasiveness, low medical risk to the pregnant woman\nand fetus, and high accuracy. Some commentators worry that these\nfeatures of NIPT, particularly its lower medical risk, may serve to\njustify loosening, limiting, or even discarding informed consent\nrequirements (e.g., Deans and Newson 2011). Other problems with\nincreased routinization may also include affirmation of\nanti-disability bias and devaluation of disabled lives, particularly\nregarding Down Syndrome (Kaposy 2013). NIPT carries most of the same\nethical issues as traditional testing and screening methods, and may\nexacerbate some.\n2.2 Birth and Mode of Delivery\n\nAs discussed above, birth has been heavily medicalized in contemporary\nNorth America, while at the same time a vocal \u2018natural\nbirth\u2019 movement has pushed against medicalization. The\ndisagreement between these two camps often circulates around whether\nbirth is best thought of as a dangerous and abnormal process best\nmanaged by medical experts in an institutional setting, or as a\n\u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 bodily function that\nrequires formal medical intervention only in unusual cases. Proponents\nof \u2018natural\u2019 childbirth point out that current norms of\nhospital birth often result in a cascade of interventions (with the\nmajority of births involving labor inducing drugs and fetal\nmonitoring, for instance, both of which in turn raise the chance that\nthe labor will end with a cesarean section). In contrast, proponents\nof the medical model of birth argue that while serious complications\nduring labor are reasonably rare, they can occur quickly and their\neffects can be catastrophic, and it is simply good risk reasoning to\nhave the expertise and resources of high-tech medicine available\nduring labor.\n\nThere is no clear scientific method for assessing the overall benefits\nor detriments of normalizing highly technologically mediated,\nmedicalized birth. Most of the standard interventions during labor\nhave never been tested in any systematic fashion, but are rather part\nof a folk culture of medicine. The rhetorical valuation of either\n\u2018natural\u2019 or medically managed birth as safer, more\nresponsible, more maternal, etc. can function to enforce a set of\nsocial norms that are for the most part cut free from scientific\nevidence about the medical soundness of various birth decisions and\npaths (Kukla 2008, Lyerly 2006).\n\nLyerly (2006) argues that the problem with modern birthing practices\nis not the use of technology or the lack of it per se, for\ntechnology itself has no inherent meaning or import. Rather, the\nproblem lies in a culture of birth that is expert-centered rather than\npatient-centered. She draws on phenomenological work by Sandra Bartky\nin order to show how \u201cfemale shame is reinforced by dominant\nstrains of birthing practice\u2014both hospital-based obstetrics\nand midwifery\u201d (Ibid, 103). She writes, \u201cAnalyses\nthat focus on models of birthing rather than women's emotional lives\nfail to capture the substance of the insult that women have recently\nincurred in giving birth. In holding technology culpable, these\nanalyses are not only inaccurate but also threaten to disenfranchise\nwomen for whom sensitively applied medical practices can enhance both\nthe safety and agency so important to a good birth\u201d (Ibid, p.\n117). When misused, technology can subjugate women to medical\nauthority, undercut their sense of dignity and control, and alienate\nthem from the birth process. But it can also be used to enhance\nwomen's agency (such as when pain medication enables a woman to\nmaintain her dignity and presence of mind at her birth, or when a\nscheduled cesarean allows a woman to feel confident that she will have\nher partner who is about to deploy overseas present at her birth).\nMeanwhile, a relatively \u2018natural\u2019 birth that does not get\ncaught up in a cascade of medical interventions can be empowering. But\nnatural childbirth advocates often paint an idealized picture of how\nbirth is supposed to proceed (see also Crossley 2007), and\ntreat \u2018success\u2019 at natural childbirth as a mark of\nmaternal character (see also Kukla 2008). Women who for various\nreasons\u2014including pre-existing medical conditions or various\ncomplications during labor\u2014do not manage to have a vaginal\ndelivery free of pain medication and medical intervention may feel\nthat they have \u2018failed\u2019 to give birth properly.\n\nEthical debate surrounds when and how women ought to be able to choose\nto have a cesarean delivery for non-medical reasons. Because there is\nno validated and universal medical code to indicate such deliveries,\nwe do not know whether elective cesareans (typically referred to as\nCesarean Deliveries on Maternal Request, or CDMRs) significantly\nimpact the overall cesarean rate or are a rare novelty. Nevertheless,\nin light of several notorious cases of celebrity CDMRs, the issue has\nsparked intense controversy. Some worry about the prevalence of\ncesarean sections indicating the rise of a technological imperative in\nstandard obstetrical practice (Burrow 2012). On the other hand, women\nwho choose cesarean deliveries are often stereotyped as \u201ctoo\nposh to push\u201d, and seen as privileging their own convenience\nover their children's well-being and their maternal responsibilities.\nEmpirical evidence, however, does not decisively support either\nbirthing method. A 2006 NIH State of the Science conference assessed\nthe available scientific evidence concerning the short and long term\nrisks to women and infants of vaginal and surgical delivery, and\nconcluded that there was insufficient evidence to issue a\nrecommendation concerning the relative safety of planned vaginal and\ncesarean births. The most comprehensive meta-analyses reveal different\nrisks in each case that are hard to commensurate and a dearth of\nhigh-quality data. Thus from a narrowly medical evidence-based point\nof view there is no justification for recommending one approach to\ndelivery over the other (Minkoff 2006, Young Mi and D'Alton 2008).\n\nThere is a clear sense in which expanding women's voluntary access to\ncesarean deliveries increases women's autonomy: it gives women more\noptions. Some of the ethical literature on this issue\n(Minkoff and Chervenak 2003, Schwartz 2004) takes it as obvious that\nincorporating CDMR into obstetrical practice would enhance patient\nautonomy, and then asks whether this advantage is offset by the harm\nof unnecessary surgery. But others have argued that autonomy consists\nof more than choice, and that in social context, making CDMR routinely\navailable might actually impede women's autonomy (Bergeron 2007, Kukla\net al. 2009). In a context where doctors have high cognitive and\nsocial authority, and technological intervention and management are\nassociated with safety, the offer of CDMR will not be a neutral offer\nbut one that has performative force and a normative valence: it will\nnot merely report on an option, but may well alter the woman's\npreferences and her understanding of what counts as a socially\nsanctioned choice. Furthermore, the act of offering CDMR may itself\ncontribute to the normalization of technologically intensive birth and\nmedicalization. If, over time, cesarean section is routinely offered\nas an option, then it may become the norm, as women will feel that the\nmore predictable and expertly managed option is the more responsible\nchoice. And, as cesarean deliveries become increasingly normalized,\nobstetricians' skills at vaginal delivery might attenuate, in turn\ncreating more need for cesarean deliveries and eventually perhaps\nmaking vaginal delivery a choice out of reach for most women (Little\net al. 2008).\n2.3 The Fetus as Patient\n\nMedical care for pregnant women generally impacts fetuses, whether by\ndesign or as a side effect. Likewise, direct attempts to provide\nmedical assistance to fetuses inevitably impact the women in whose\nbodies they reside. A recurring issue in obstetrical ethics concerns\nwhether and when the fetus should be conceptualized as a patient in\nits own right. Doing so has substantive and complex implications for\ndoctors, who have distinctive duties to their patients, as well as\nother possible legal and ethical consequences.\n\nIn several papers (the first published in 1996), Chervenak and\nMcCullough have argued that late-term, viable fetuses ought to be\nconceived of as patients who are owed beneficence and respect for\ntheir (future) autonomy. A pre-viable fetus, in their view, should\nbecome a patient if and only if the pregnant woman autonomously\nchooses to grant it such status. Once the fetus is a patient, they\nargue, the doctor has a duty to try to protect its well-being and\nbalance its needs against the needs of the pregnant woman. They point\nout that they are not committed to viewing fetuses as persons. The\nquestion of whether the fetus is a patient is distinct from (though in\nvarious ways intertwined with) the well-worn question of whether it is\na person. It is by no means obvious that only people can be patients,\nnor that all people become patients just by being impacted by a\nmedical procedure.\n\nNevertheless, many feminist bioethicists (i.e., Duden 1993, Lyerly and\nMahowald 2001) have been concerned that conceiving of the fetus as a\nseparate patient tends to imaginatively bolster the personification of\nthe fetus, as well as giving it a practical status that ought to be\nreserved for persons. Furthermore, understanding the fetus as a\npatient in its own right encourages conceiving of the mother and fetus\nas beings with entirely separate interests, which may then be in\nconflict as easily as aligned. While at times the interests of the\nwoman and the fetus may diverge, typically these interests are\ninextricably related, both because expectant mothers usually care\nintensely about fetal well-being, and because protecting the health of\nthe pregnant woman is typically the best way to protect the health of\nthe fetus (Mattingly 1992, Lyerly, Little and Faden 2008a).\n\nMaternal-fetal surgery to correct serious fetal anomalies such as\nsevere Spina Bifida is an experimental field of medicine. Until fairly\nrecently, such procedures were known as \u2018fetal\nsurgery\u2019\u2014a label that made it invisible that in all fetal\nsurgeries the pregnant woman underwent invasive surgery herself. Early\nassessments of \u2018fetal surgery\u2019 considered only the risks\nand potential benefits to fetuses, while the medical consequences for\nwomen were understudied and received short shrift in the informed\nconsent process (Lyerly and Mahowald 2001). At a 2000 conference on\n\u2018fetal surgery\u2019 at Vanderbilt University, Susan Wolf\nsuggested the switch to the term \u2018maternal-fetal surgery\u2019,\nand this terminology was adopted by the NIH, and by many\u2014though\nnot all\u2014practitioners and commentators (Ibid). Lyerly and\nMahowald argue that even the switch to conceiving the surgeries as\ninvolving two patients whose well-being must be weighed separately is\ninsufficient; rather, they think, we should understand maternal and\nfetal well-being and interests as tightly intertwined, and the woman\nas the sole patient. In both theory and practice, maternal-fetal\nsurgery raises a number of ethical issues we discuss in this article,\nincluding questions concerning pregnant women's autonomy, consent\nunder social pressure and in the shadow of powerful social values, and\nattitudes towards disability (Antiel 2016).\n3. Compromises of Pregnant Women's Autonomy\n\nIn this section, we take up ethical issues that arise in the medical\nmanagement of pregnant women who are decisionally impaired, as well as\nthe question of whether it is ever ethically justifiable to override a\npregnant woman's autonomous refusal of medical intervention for the\nsake of the well-being of her fetus.\n3.1 Incapacity for Autonomy: Pregnancy in Decisionally Impaired Women\n\nWhen a patient is decisionally impaired or incapacitated, ethical\ndilemmas concerning medical decision-making arise: Should the patient\nbe included in decision-making in a limited way, to the best of her\nabilities, or should paternalistic decision-making take over? Should a\nproxy decision-maker make choices on the basis of the patient's best\ninterest, or by simulating as best she can the autonomous decision\nthat the patient would have made, had she been in a position to make\none? Such issues are familiar in the context of end of life care and\ncare for children and the cognitively impaired.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman is decisionally impaired or incompetent,\nhowever, there are extra layers of ethical complexity to contend with,\nbecause her treatment typically affects not only her, but also her\nchild to-be. The developing fetus clearly has welfare (or at least\nfuture welfare) but no capacity for autonomous choice, and we have no\nformula for combining its interests and moral claims with those of the\nmother. For extra complication, the well-being of the child to-be is\ntypically not independent of the well-being of its mother. Further\nethical issues may arise in cases where, prior to serious decision\nimpairment (due, for example, to massive brain injury or brain death),\nthe pregnant woman has autonomously expressed her preference to\ncontinue to gestate and give birth. In such cases, ethicists at both\nthe clinical and policy-making level may face questions about how to\nrespect the pregnant woman's autonomy while balancing concerns for the\npotential child. They may be required to consider how external factors\nsuch as available caregivers for the potential child may factor into\nthe possibility and desirability of going forward with the pregnancy.\nThus doctors must balance autonomy-based and beneficence-based\nobligations to the pregnant woman, along with beneficence-based\nobligations to the fetus (e.g. Coverdale et al. 2004). When a pregnant\nwoman is decisionally competent, health care practitioners and\nethicists strongly privilege her right to make final treatment\ndecisions in complicated cases where her interests may conflict with\nthose of her future child (although see section 3.2 below). Moreover,\nthe fetus generally has no legal standing that would allow its\ninterest to override the pregnant woman's interest (Sperling 2006).\nBut when the pregnant woman has diminished or no autonomy, the\nsituation is murkier.\n3.1.1 Pregnancy in Fully Incapacitated Women\n\nCases have arisen in which a pregnant woman has zero decisional\ncapacity and no hope of future agency, for instance when she is in a\nlong-term persistent vegetative state or has suffered frontal brain\ndeath and is being kept alive artificially (for recent case studies\nsee, e.g., Said et al. 2013; Esmaeilzadeh et al. 2010). The central\nquestions raised in such cases include whether it is ethical to keep a\npregnant woman alive for the sole purpose of continuing the pregnancy,\nwho should make this determination, and which considerations should\nfactor into that decision. One recent case demonstrates the continuing\npower of fetal protections in contexts where anti-abortion laws are\nstill in place. In 2013, a woman from Texas became braindead at 14\nweeks pregnant, and was kept on life-support against her and her\nfamily's wishes, until it was established that her fetus was also\nbrain dead (Ecker 2014). In many situations, however, the woman's\npreference will remain unclear. In 1992, a pregnant German woman\nsuffered brain death in a car accident that did no apparent damage to\nthe fetus, and debate ensued over whether to keep her alive\nartificially so that the \u2018Erlanger baby\u2019 could continue to\ngestate (Anst\u00f6tz 1993). (The woman miscarried while the debate\nwas still in progress.) Other recent medical attempts to continue\nfetal gestation in the wake of maternal brain death have enjoyed some\nsuccess (Esmaeilzadeh et al. 2010).\n\nIn some of these cases, questions about how to include the woman's\nvoice or respect her agency are off the table, and her welfare\ninterests, if any, are minimal. She has no conscious experience or\nfuture narrative to protect. We may, however, believe that she still\nhas interests in dignity and in having her former narrative and values\nrespected. Protecting these interests may preclude certain forms of\ntreatment of the dead, including artificially continuing pregnancy\n(Sperling 2006 77-80). Protecting these interests may also,\nconversely, raise issues regarding performing abortions on pregnant\nwomen who have become brain dead (Watt 2016 57-58). Some feel that it\nis unacceptable to use a pregnant woman's body as a mere means by\ncontinuing her life solely for its incubation function; others will\nargue that if the father-to-be wants to raise his child, it is callous\nto deny the child-to-be its chance at life and the father his chance\nat parenthood in virtue of abstract concerns about instrumentalism and\nrespect, given that the woman will experience no extra suffering, and\nno thwarting of her autonomous preferences (assuming she left no\nadvance directive). Anst\u00f6tz (1993) argues that the fetus has a\nright to life sufficiently strong to mandate that the woman\nbe kept alive to enable the fetus to become viable. Fost (1994) argues\nthat a brain-dead pregnant woman ought not be counted as a person with\ninterests relevant to the moral calculation, and he urges moving moral\nattention away from the \u2018interests\u2019 of the fetus as well.\nInstead, he urges that the next of kin ought to have the right to\ndecide when to remove life support, as they would in normal cases of\nnon-pregnant patients.\n\nHilde Lindemann (writing as Hilde Lindemann Nelson, 1994) and Laura\nPurdy (1994) argue that keeping a brain dead woman alive for the\nsingular purpose of continuing her pregnancy is problematic. Lindemann\nargues that the woman no longer exists as a person of the sort that\ncan have agent-relative duties towards her fetus. Furthermore, keeping\nher alive as an incubator grossly misrepresents the significance of\npregnancy, reducing it to a passive biological process rather than a\ncreative, cooperative process involving the woman's agency. Similarly,\nPurdy (1994) argues that such postmortem pregnancies contribute to a\nproblematic view of pregnant women as mere fetal\n\u2018containers\u2019. On the other hand, in these cases\npregnancy is clearly not a creative or active project for the\nwoman, and, while it may be symbolically problematic not to\nacknowledge women's creative, agential role in typical pregnancies, it\nseems odd to argue that we should prevent pregnancies that do not fit\nthis typical profile from existing in order to symbolically protect\nthe myth that they always do so.\n\nPurdy also points out that sustaining such pregnancies is ethically\nproblematic because it involves extreme interventions on women's\nbodies without their consent. Both Lindemann and Purdy question\nwhether such extraordinary and expensive medical interventions, aimed\nat saving a fetus who is not yet a baby, are a just or reasonable use\nof medical resources (especially if the fetus stands a low chance of\nsurvival and normal development). Lindemann worries, furthermore, that\nsuch extraordinary measures help enforce an image of the fetus as\nalready a person with a claim on resources as large as or even larger\nthan that of existing persons.\n3.1.2 Pregnancy in Decisionally Impaired Women\n\nPregnant women with limited capacity for autonomous agency and\ndecision-making (due to cognitive disability, mental illness, drug\nuse, etc.) still have the right to have their (limited) autonomy\nrespected and fostered to the largest extent possible; at the same\ntime, both they and their future children must be protected somehow\nfrom harms that bad choices stemming from decisional impairment could\ncause. Such women are often particularly socially vulnerable and\nfrequent targets of manipulation; they face multiple barriers to\nhaving their reproductive and sexual health needs recognized and met\n(e.g. see Greenwood and Wilkinson 2013 on women with intellectual\ndisabilities). Protecting their agency and well-being as well as the\nwell-being of their future children can thus be a delicate\nnegotiation. Furthermore, physicians and family members may not be\nneutral parties when it comes to assessing a pregnant woman's level of\ndecisional competence: if they disagree with her expressed desires\nconcerning her own care (for example, her opposition to abortion, or\nrefusal of medication or bed rest) or believe her choices put her\nfetus at unacceptable risk, they may be motivated to overestimate her\nlevel of decisional impairment, thereby justifying paternalistically\noverriding her expressed wishes.\n\nDouglas Diekema (2003) points out that decisional capacity is not a\nthreshold capacity, and that it may fluctuate with timing, context,\nand type of decision. Hence, in settling on how much paternalism is\nappropriate in managing a decisionally impaired patient, doctors have\na responsibility to try to find a time and approach that will promote\nand assist rather than foreclose the possibility of the patient's\nmeaningful autonomous participation in medical decision making.\nFacilitating patients' autonomy in reproductive decision-making while\nprotecting their best interests is perhaps especially challenging in\ncases where mood or personality disorders may erratically influence\ndecision-making capacity (e.g. Zalpuri et al. 2015). Coverdale et al.\n(2004) argue that respecting the autonomy of decisionally compromised\npatients involves actively working towards removing or diminishing\ncircumstantial and reversible barriers to participation in\ndecision-making. This might include education, creative forms of\ninvolvement in decision-making from loved ones, postponing a medical\ndecision until after psychotropic medication has had time to become\neffective, accommodating a patient's special needs for an environment\nconducive to making a decision, etc. The presence of a fetus should\nnot serve as ground for detracting from our duty to protect a pregnant\nwoman's right to participate in decisions about her own care to\nwhatever extent she is capable (which is not to say that paternalistic\ninterventions on behalf of her or her fetus's welfare are never\nappropriate for decisionally impaired women).\n3.2 Overriding Autonomy: Forced Interventions During Pregnancy\n\nWhen a pregnant woman refuses an intervention that doctors judge\nprovides a substantial benefit or life-saving intervention for her\nfetus, is overriding her refusal ever ethically justified? It is\ntypically a sacrosanct principle in medical ethics that patients have\nan absolute right to refuse medical interventions, including\nlife-saving interventions, if they make an autonomous, informed,\ncompetent choice to do so. However, in the case of pregnant women,\nthis principle has been questioned and sometimes violated by force in\nthe name of protecting the fetus. Examples have included forced\ncesarean deliveries, mandatory HIV testing, and life-saving blood\ntransfusions performed despite religious objections.\n\nThe 1987 case of Angela Carder, a 27-year-old woman who had cancer\nthat had gone into remission but recurred during her pregnancy,\nbrought these issues to a head. Fully competent, Carder made clear\nthat she wanted everything possible done to save her life. However,\nduring the 25th week of gestation, it became clear that\nCarder was dying. George Washington University Medical Center, where\nshe was a patient, tried to insist upon an early cesarean section\ndelivery in order to save her fetus. She refused the intervention,\nwhich was nearly certain to kill her, with the support of her family,\nhusband, and doctors, but the hospital obtained a court order and\nforced the delivery. Both Carder and her extremely premature baby\nsurvived the operation only very briefly. In 1990, the D.C. Court of\nAppeals posthumously vacated the court-ordered cesarean section,\nholding that Carder had the right to make health care decisions for\nherself and her fetus, and that only in the most exceptional\ncircumstances should a pregnant woman's right to refuse interventions\nbe called into question (Thornton and Paltrow, 1991).\n\nForced interventions have also taken place more recently. In 2009,\nSamantha Burton was forced to stay in hospital for prescribed bedrest\nwhen her membranes ruptured at 25 weeks. Burton's competence was not\nin doubt, but her interests in leaving the hospital (to return to her\nother children and her job) were overridden because her fetus could be\nexposed to greater risk if she failed to comply with bedrest orders.\nThe hospital's obstetrician testified in favour of court-ordered care\nin the role of the fetus's attending physician, and the judge ruled\nthat any interventions required for the fetus should be administered.\nA few days later the fetus was delivered by cesarean, already dead.\nThis case illustrates how pregnant women's rights to refuse\ninterventions are still treated as violable in cases where refusing\ncare may harm the fetus (for discussion see Cantor 2012, Charles\n2011).\n\nNevertheless, there is now widespread legal and ethical agreement in\nlight of the Carder case that pregnant women, as autonomous adults and\nfull citizens, do not lose their constitutional rights to privacy and\nbodily integrity in light of their pregnancy (Pollitt 1990). These\nrights continue to hold in cases where exercising them may result in\nthe death of a fetus or in harm to the child the fetus will become.\nEven when the survival of a fetus depends on a pregnant woman\nundergoing some intervention, she can no more be compelled to consent\nto it than anyone else could be compelled to undergo a medical\nintervention to save another person. Some authors have expressed\nconcern that forcing interventions on pregnant women for the sake of\nthe fetus contributes to our cultural imagining of the fetus as a\nfull-fledged person who functions as a patient with rights and medical\nneeds equivalent to the woman's own (Nelson and Milliken 1988, Roth\n2003). Indeed, as Paltrow and Flavin (2013) discuss, even embryos and\nfertilized eggs may enjoy the protections of personhood status, albeit\nnot as a result of formal legislation. Evidence suggests that wide\nacceptance of such extensions of personhood will be particularly\ndetrimental to the procreative autonomy of vulnerable women (ibid). On\nthe other hand, some forced interventions are designed to improve the\nhealth of the children that fetuses will become. If the fetus will\nsurvive, there will eventually be a full-fledged person with interests\nthat can be harmed during pregnancy. So forced interventions do not\nnecessarily personify the fetus; they may instead force the\npregnant woman to sacrifice her own well-being or autonomy for the\nsake of her future child. But even if the intervention furthers the\ninterests of a person\u2014either a future person, or a fetal person\nif we accept that there are such things\u2014it may be unjust to\npermit overruling pregnant women's interests in favour of fetal\ninterests. In fact, since we do not force medical interventions on\nanyone in order to save another fully developed, rights-bearing\nperson, a double standard that allows forced interventions on pregnant\nwomen seems to enshrine the fetus or future child as more\nvaluable and deserving of protection than born persons (Minkoff and\nPaltrow 2004).\n\nEven if forced interventions on competent pregnant women are virtually\nnever justified, there may be good moral reasons why pregnant women\nought not to refuse various interventions in particular cases. One\nmight argue that, at least in the case of voluntary pregnancy, the\npregnant woman has taken on a special duty to protect the well-being\nof her future child in continuing to be pregnant. Savulescu (2007a)\nargues for a \u2018duty of easy rescue\u2019\u2014regardless of\nwhether the fetus counts as a person, he claims, a pregnant woman has\na duty to allow acts that do not significantly harm her while\nprotecting her future child from significant harm (see also Draper\n1996). Chervenak and McCullough (1991) argue that sometimes refusal of\ntreatment can be expected to result in further medical complications,\nand hence constitutes an implicit positive demand for alternative\ntreatment that may be more costly. While we typically take refusals of\ntreatment to be sacrosanct, our respect for autonomy does not extend\nto recognizing an unlimited right to demand particular interventions\nat will. If a pregnant woman's refusal of a treatment that would stave\noff premature birth, for instance, implicitly involves demand for\nexpensive care for her premature infant, it is unclear that she has\nthe moral right to refuse treatment. On the face of it, this argument\nis not specific to pregnant women. However, non-pregnant citizens who\nshoulder extra risk by refusing treatment could in principle commit to\nrefraining from using future medical resources, whereas pregnant women\narguably have no moral or legal right to do so on behalf of their\nfuture children. Hence they may have special moral responsibilities\nnot to refuse interventions in some cases.\n\nOn the other hand, the question of the ethical responsibilities of\npregnant women ought to remain separate from the question of what they\ncan be compelled to do by law, medical authority, or brute\nforce (Draper 1996, Nelson and Milliken 1988). Even if pregnant women\nsometimes have a moral duty not to refuse interventions, this\ndoes not count against the conclusion that, as full citizens, they\nhave the same privacy and bodily integrity rights as all other\ncitizens, even when their exercise of these rights involves morally\nproblematic behavior.\n\nIn the wake of the Carder ruling, cases of forcing a manifestly\ncompetent pregnant woman to undergo an intervention over her\nobjections have been rare. However, forced interventions are still\nsometimes performed on women who are vulnerable due to poverty, mental\nillness, immigration status, racism, etc. (Roth 2003, Roberts 1996).\nThese vulnerable women, whose contact with the health care system is\nmore likely to be fragmented, are more open to being assessed as\nincompetent when their expressed decision differs sharply from the\njudgment of medical professionals responsible for their care. Social\nmarginalization can create the appearance of incompetence, and it can\nalso genuinely hamper competence when it comes to negotiating\nphysician-patient interactions.\n\nCases involving possible forced interventions on pregnant women are\noften framed as cases of \u2018maternal-fetal conflict\u2019, in\nwhich doctors or courts must adjudicate between the wishes of the\nwoman and the well-being or rights of the fetus (Draper 1996, Van\nBogaert 2006). Such a framing positions the fetus as in need of\nrescuing from a callous mother. Several authors have argued, however,\nthat we ought to presume that almost all expectant mothers are\nconcerned about the well-being of their future children and do not\ntake an adversarial stance towards them (Minkoff and Paltrow 2004,\nFinn 1998). With this in mind, some authors conclude that the very\nnotion of maternal-fetal conflict ought to be discarded; not only may\nit undermine pregnant women's autonomy, it falsely describes the\nnature and source of the conflict. Baylis, Rodgers, and Young (2008)\nargue that the pertinent conflict is typically between pregnant women\nand others who presume authority regarding the appropriate care of the\nfetus, and that it is not in any case typically a conflict between the\nmother and the fetus. In this light, we ought to first try to\nunderstand disagreements between pregnant women and their doctors over\npotential interventions in terms of different understandings of what\nwould best promote maternal and fetal well-being. Such disagreements\nare perhaps better cast as maternal-physician conflicts than as\nmaternal-fetal conflicts. Furthermore, the fact that vulnerable women\nare most frequently the ones that find themselves in an adversarial\nrelationship with their caregivers suggests that we ought to look for\nsocial factors that create miscommunication and conflict rather than\nsimply casting such women as bad mothers whose fetuses must be\nprotected from their selfish decisions (Finn 1998).\n4. Managing and Communicating Reproductive Risk\n\nMany commentators have pointed out that we live in a \u2018risk\nsociety\u2019 (Beck 1992). The language of risk pervades our public\ndiscourse surrounding pregnancy and birth, both currently and\nhistorically (e.g. Hallgrimsdottir and Benner 2014). Where\ncost-benefit analyses serve as paradigms of rationality and hallmarks\nof efficiency, social problems are framed as exercises in risk\nmanagement. While most pregnancies in developed countries yield\nhealthy mothers and babies, pregnancy unavoidably involves risk for\nwomen and fetuses alike. Women generally care deeply about the\nwell-being of their future children, and hence are typically concerned\nwith managing reproductive risk. More broadly, as a social body, we\nhave a strong collective interest in the health and welfare of our\nfuture community members, and hence reproductive risk is a matter of\npublic concern.\n\nPregnancy is portrayed in our culture as fraught with risk on all\nsides, while at the same time even minimal risks to fetuses are\ntreated as intolerable (Kukla 2005, Lyerly et al. 2009). Many have\nargued that pregnant women (as opposed to policy makers, fathers,\nindustrial manufacturers, etc.) are disproportionately burdened with\nthe responsibility for managing reproductive risk (i.e., Armstrong\n2003, Kukla 2005, Rothman 2014). The combined force of these factors\nis that pregnant women are often expected to survey and discipline\nvirtually all aspects of their bodies and lives, from each bite they\neat, to which products they use, where they work and recreate, how\nthey lie in bed, which emotions they feel, and much more, in\naccordance with elaborate, ever-proliferating, ever-changing rules of\nrisk minimization (Duden 1993, Lupton 1998, Kukla 2005, Lyerly et al.\n2009).\n\nIn managing and communicating about reproductive risk, we face several\nchallenges. First and perhaps most obviously, while pregnant women and\nfetuses are inextricably physically intertwined, the risks and\npotential benefits to each of them of various actions, situations, and\ninterventions are typically different and can even be in tension.\nManaging risk can be especially complicated and ethically charged\ngiven this entwinement of two different sets of risks and potential\nbenefits. Second, as will be discussed below, there are various\nreasons why good-quality evidence about reproductive risk is hard to\ncome by, and hence we often must make decisions about how to manage\nsuch risk under a great deal of uncertainty. Third, features of our\ncultural context can distort our perceptions of reproductive risk\n(Drabble et al. 2011). Such distortions become ethically relevant to\nthe extent that they either lead us to decisions that are not, as they\npurport to be, in the best interests of babies or their mothers, or\nthat place inappropriate burdens and responsibilities on pregnant\nwomen that are not responsive to reality. The following sections\nsurvey some ethical issues that highlight these barriers to\nhigh-quality reasoning about reproductive risk.\n4.1 Alcohol and drug use during pregnancy\n\nPregnant women who use alcohol and drugs violate deeply held cultural\nvisions of appropriate motherhood. We tend to frame any level of\ndrinking or drug use during pregnancy as indicating serious maternal\nirresponsibility. The United States and Canada advocate total\nabstinence from drinking during pregnancy, or even when becoming\npregnant is a possibility. The United Kingdom and other countries have\nrecently followed suit. And yet, while we know that alcoholic women,\nparticularly those who smoke and experience social stress such as\npoverty, are at risk for giving birth to babies with Fetal Alcohol\nSyndrome, the risk to fetuses from light to moderate maternal drinking\nis merely theoretical. Researchers have repeatedly failed to find any\nconcrete evidence of fetal harm from such drinking (Armstrong 2003,\nLee 2009). Vigilant abstention may be demanded alongside explicit\nacknowledgment of such evidence. In 2014, the Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention released an extensive study showing no\nmeasurable ill effects on children from light maternal drinking. Two\nyears later, the Center released an advisory telling all\nwomen who could become pregnant to abstain entirely from\ndrinking, whether or not they were or planned to become pregnant (CDC\nApril 2014, February 2016).\n\nIt is tempting to think that even if light drinking or drug use poses\nonly a small teratogenic risk, women are morally obligated to refrain\nfrom it. For instance, Elizabeth Harman (1999) claims that\nany smoking during a pregnancy one plans to carry to term is\n\u201cmorally impermissible\u201d, and Gilmore (2008) argues that\nwomen who are or might become pregnant ought to abstain from drinking\nany alcohol. But we cannot, of course, ask pregnant women to abstain\ncompletely from all voluntary activities carrying some fetal risk, for\nthey would be paralyzed into inactivity (which would itself come with\nsome risk). Indeed, we are not nearly so draconian in our attitudes\ntowards other, more clearly risky behaviors during pregnancy, such as\ndriving a car. Elizabeth Armstrong (2003) and Janet Golden (2006) have\nargued that widespread social anxiety over Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\nconstitutes a \u2018moral panic\u2019 over mothers engaging in what\nwe imagine as self-indulgent or decadent behavior, rather than an\nevidence-based response to risk. Focusing on the consumption of\nalcohol or drugs as a particularly pernicious form of risk-taking\nseems to have more to do with images and ideologies of maternal\nself-sacrifice, purity, and decadence than with rational concern for\nfetal well-being. The failure of extreme risk-aversion strategies to\nreliably decrease harmful behaviours and contribute to positive health\noutcomes for pregnant women and their fetuses should lead\npractitioners and researchers toward alternative approaches to\nunderstanding, communicating about, and managing risks for pregnant\nwomen (Ballantyne et al. 2016). Alternative approaches call for\nclearer understanding of fetal risk among both clinicians and policy\nmakers, and explicit consideration of the social and political values\nthat shape current forms of risk management in pregnant women.\n(Minkoff and Marshall 2016).\n\nThe ethical issues are different when we turn to pregnant women who\nseriously abuse alcohol and other drugs known to cause major damage to\nfetuses. This is undesirable behavior that we would like to prevent if\npossible, and if a woman can stop this behavior, then she ought to.\nMany states have tried to prosecute pregnant drug users for separate\ncrimes beyond illicit drug use, such as child abuse, but such charges\nhave rarely stood up in court (but see Whitner v. South Carolina,\n1997). Not infrequently, pregnant drug users have had their children\nremoved from their care at birth, or have been coerced into treatment.\nAs we discuss below, these forms of intervention may have the opposite\nof the desired effect, by discouraging pregnant women who use drugs\nand alcohol from seeking prenatal care (Roberts and Pies 2011).\n\nGeorge Schedler (1991, 1992) has argued that as a society we ought to\nforce pregnant women who persistently abuse drugs to have abortions.\nHe argues that harm is minimized by simply eliminating fetuses at high\nrisk for damage through maternal drug abuse. The harm of unwanted\nabortion, he claims, \u2018pales in comparison\u2019 to the\nsuffering imposed on other family members, teachers, etc. who must\nhelp care for a damaged child. He also argues that fetuses have a\nright not to be subjected to a life damaged by in utero drug exposure,\nand that reproductive autonomy does not extend to the right to bear a\nchild damaged by one's own drug use. It is integral to his argument\nthat doing drugs is a \u2018leisure activity\u2019, and hence that\nwomen morally forfeit their protection from unwanted abortion and\ntheir right to bear a child through participating in this activity.\nOne might find implausible the idea that non-existence is preferable\nto a life involving even quite severe impairments caused by in utero\ndrug exposure, and hence Schedler's argument from fetal rights is\nquestionable. Furthermore, the idea that caring for such an impaired\nchild obviously involves far more suffering than joy is disturbing.\nMoreover, Schedler does not discuss the emotional damage and the\nassault on bodily integrity and privacy involved in a forced abortion;\nhe considers only the immediate discomfort of the surgical procedure\nin factoring in the harm done to pregnant women under his\nproposal.\n\nMost commentators on the ethics of managing pregnant drug abusers have\nrejected a punitive or coercive approach (Capron 1998, Steinbock 1992,\ndeVille et al. 1998, Terplan, Kennedy-Hendricks, and Chisolm 2015).\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights published a brief in 2000\nsummarizing common arguments against punishing pregnant drug abusers.\nThey point out that punishing the mother does not particularly protect\nthe well-being of children. It is also unlikely to have a deterrent\neffect, since drug use among addicts is rarely a voluntary choice\nbased on a rational assessment of the risks and potential benefits of\ndrug use. Indeed, most pregnant addicts are not \u2018choosing\u2019\ntheir own pleasure over their children's well-being, as they would\ngenerally prefer not to be drug abusers, for their own sake as well as\ntheir child's. In addition to creating barriers to effective prenatal\ncare, punitive and coercive approaches to drug use during pregnancy\nmay inappropriately diminish women's agency and misconstrue the\ninterests of pregnant women who use drugs (Olsen, Banwell, and Madden\n2014). Threatening pregnant drug users with punishment does not serve\nto protect children from their \u201cunfit\u201d mothers, and may\ndeter women from getting prenatal care and especially drug treatment,\nthereby further harming their children (Terplan, Kennedy-Henricks and\nChisolm 2015). Furthermore, a punitive approach individualizes the\nproblem of drug use during pregnancy and ignores social determinants\nof drug addiction. Some argue that punitive measures against pregnant\nwomen addicted to drugs are inherently unjust when taken in a system\nthat fails to meet the basic health needs of marginalized women and\nchildren (Flavin and Paltrow 2010). Poor and minority pregnant women\nare disproportionately tested for drugs and threatened with\npunishment, even though they use drugs at rates no higher than their\nwhite, middle-class counterparts, and hence a punitive approach is\nlikely to be unjustly applied (see also Hans 1999). Iris Young argues,\n\u201c[b]ecause punishing the pregnant addict does next to nothing to\nprevent the birth of babies harmed by the chronic drug use of their\nmothers, punishment seems only to have the function of marking the\nwomen as deviant, publicly reaffirming their exclusion from the class\nof upstanding citizens\u201d (Young 1994, 39).\n\nIris Young (1994) distinguishes between three approaches to drug abuse\nduring pregnancy: punishment, treatment, and empowerment. She rejects\nthe punishment approach as immoral and impractical. Most critics of\nthe punitive approach advocate a treatment approach (e.g., Steinbock\n1992, DeVille et al. 1998). Young, however, has reservations about the\ntreatment approach as currently practiced; she argues that it still\ntreats addiction as an individual, medicalized health problem, rather\nthan as a social problem. An empowerment approach of the sort that\nYoung favors offers treatment, but in the context of a project of\nsocial empowerment and consciousness-raising designed to foster a\ncritically reflective \u201csense of collective influence over the\nsocial conditions of one's life\u201d (Young 1994, 48). She advocates\nprograms that help women develop a perspective from which overcoming\naddiction can be understood not just as an individual health or\nwill-power problem, but as part of a shared project of personal and\ncommunity transformation.\n4.2 Research and Medical Treatment Involving Pregnant Women\n\nUp until the early 1990s, women were dramatically underrepresented in\nclinical research trials. Historically, the two most common reasons\ngiven for women's default exclusion were their purportedly more\ncomplicated and variable hormonal patterns and the possibility that\nthey might be or become pregnant during the study, which could harm\nthe fetus (DeBruin 1994, Little 1996, Giacomini and Baylis 2003). The\nNational Institutes of Health solicited a report from the Institute of\nMedicine in 1992 on the effects upon women's health of these routine\nexclusions, and the report concluded that serious harms were being\ndone to women. Women were disproportionately denied the direct\nbenefits that might come from study participation. More importantly,\ntheir systematic exclusion from clinical trials meant that we did not\nknow how to design appropriate treatment plans for women, whose\ndifferent hormones and reproductive system, longer life span, and\nother medically relevant differences meant that treating them as\nsmallish men for the purposes of dosing drugs and other treatment\ndecisions was not a medically sound strategy. In 1993, the NIH changed\nits policies to make inclusion of women the default in all research,\nvariation from which requires explicit justification. Constance Holden\n(2008) reported that as of 2006, women comprised 68.9% of participants\nin clinical trials. However, some argue that women continue to be\nsignificantly outnumbered by male subjects in biomedical research and\nclinical trials generally; these commentators suggest that women's\ninclusion rates were artificially inflated by a small number of single\nsex studies (Kim, Tingen, and Woodruff 2010). Moreover, disclosure of\ninclusion practices and rates in clinical trials is unreliable, and\nrecent reviews fail to confirm reports of significant progress in\ndiverse inclusion (Woodruff et al. 2015, Geller et al. 2011). \n\nIn any case, pregnant women remain an official \u2018vulnerable\ngroup\u2019 under the federal policies governing human subjects\nresearch, and are exempt from the inclusion mandate. Indeed, virtually\nall clinical research excludes pregnant women out of purported concern\nfor teratogenic effects on fetuses, while even trials for\ninterventions not classified as potentially teratogenic routinely\nexclude pregnant women (Shields and Lyerly 2013). Ongoing exclusion\nstymies development of safe and effective medical interventions for\npregnant women, whose metabolism, blood volume, hormones, immune\nsystem, and other bodily systems are affected by pregnancy in ways\nthat impact their response to medication (Blehar et al. 2013). It also\nplaces fetuses at risk; out of the 468 medications approved in the\nUnited States in 2002, 91% pose an unknown risk to fetuses (Lyerly,\nLittle, and Faden 2008b). While the lacuna of reliable evidence\nregarding safe and effective medical interventions for pregnant women\nand their fetuses is widely acknowledged as a problem, it has not, in\ngeneral, shaken the consensus that it is unethical to put fetuses at\nunknown risk for the purposes of research. Often the thalidomide\ncrisis of the 1970s is cited as an example of the potential dangers of\nexposing fetuses to drugs, and hence as an object lesson in the need\nfor precautionary principle to govern our practices of including\npregnant women in research. But if the welfare of fetuses is our\nprimary concern, we ought to take the opposite lesson from the\nthalidomide disaster: it is precisely because thalidomide was\nnot systematically tested before being prescribed that so\nmany babies were affected (Ibid.).\n\nIn light of our lack of knowledge of the teratogenic effects of most\ndrugs, advice for pregnant women is generally conservative; women are\nadvised to avoid medical interventions and medications during\npregnancy if at all possible. For example, women with mental illnesses\nsuch as bipolar disorder and depression are often counseled to avoid\nmedication during pregnancy, both because psychotropic drugs tend to\ndiffuse readily across the placenta, and because typically, the mental\nstate of the mother does not directly impact the health of\nthe fetus (in contrast with, for instance, diabetes or\nlife-threatening cancer). However, mental illness in pregnant women\nmatters to fetal development: untreated depression, for example, is\nassociated with premature birth, low birthweight, and other\ncomplications (Gold and Marcus 2008). Moreover, some researchers argue\nthat evidence for negative health outcomes for children born from\nwomen taking anti-depressants is scant and unreliable, and provides\nlittle guidance for treatment (Byatt, Deligiannidis, and Freeman 2013,\nPearlstein 2015). Without improved evidence, it is difficult to give\nany rules of thumb for the ethics of treating mental illness during\npregnancy.\n\nMore generally, the conservative approach to doing research with and\ntreating women during pregnancy emphasizes the risks to fetuses from\nintervening, but not the risks from not intervening (Lyerly, Little,\nand Faden 2008b). When we exclude pregnant women from research or\ndiscourage treatment because of a lack of knowledge about the effects\nof a medication, we are not typically erring on the side of fetal\nsafety; rather, we generally have no idea whether it is\nriskier for the fetus to be exposed to a medication or to the effects\nof untreated maternal morbidity. As Lyerly, Little and Faden point\nout, \u201cIf research is important to tell us when medications are\nunsafe, it is also important to reassure us when drugs are\nsafe \u2026 In the absence of information about the safety and\nefficacy of medications, pregnant women and their providers are left\nwith two unsavory options\u2014take a drug, with unknown safety and\nefficacy; or fail to treat the conditions, thus leaving the woman and\nfetus vulnerable to the consequences of the underlying medical\nproblems\u201d (Lyerly, Little and Faden 2008b, 12, 19). Pregnant\nwomen who have medical needs during pregnancy are typically told to\nweigh the risks and benefits when deciding whether to proceed with a\ntreatment whose impact on fetuses is unknown. But this is an\nimpossible demand; no one can weigh unknown risks and benefits.\nExcluding pregnant women from research sustains the impossibility of\nthis calculation, and erring on the side of nontreatment may or may\nnot best protect fetal well-being.\n\nTo our knowledge, no bioethicist has defended the current policy of\nnear-universal exclusion of pregnant women from research. It is\nunclear, however, how best to craft appropriate standards for\ninclusion. Not only is the random exposure of fetuses to unknown\nteratogenic risks ethically problematic, but few pregnant women are\nlikely to enroll in such trials. Some bioethicists propose ethical\nguidelines for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials that\nattend to both the woman and her fetus as patients (Chevernak and\nMcCullough 2011). As others point out in response, however, the fetus\nas patient approach will likely entail continuing strict limitations\non clinical trial participation, including in cases where the\nintervention in question is potentially life-saving for the pregnant\nwoman but risky to the fetus. The approach does not resolve the\nproblem of pregnant women's exclusion from medical research\nparticipation and associated health impacts (Baylis and Kaposy 2011,\nLiaschenko, Debruin, and Marshall 2011, Perry 2011). We are in need of\nnew practices and policies that are sensitive to the difficulties and\ndangers of research on pregnant women, but are undistorted by\nassumptions that it is always more responsible and safer to protect\nfetuses from unknown interventions. Proposals for identifying and\nimplementing ethically and medically sound guidelines for including\npregnant women in clinical trials are currently under development\n(e.g. Brandon et al. 2014, White 2015).\n\nIn rare cases, such as some advanced cancers, treatment decisions for\na pregnant woman necessitate a choice between saving her life and that\nof the fetus, or other dramatic trade-offs. In such cases, there is\ngeneral consensus (especially in the wake of the Angela Carder case\ndiscussed above) that the primary consideration should be saving the\nlife of the mother (i.e. see Puls, Terry, and Hunter 1997). Charles\nWeijer (1998) points out, however, that in some cases a pregnant\nwoman's decision to refuse treatment and sacrifice herself for her\nchild should be counted as an autonomous decision worth respecting,\nand that we should not assume that only self-interested decisions can\nbe autonomous.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Amundson,Ron, 2005, \u201cDisability, ideology, and quality of\nlife: a bias in biomedical ethics\u201d, in Wasserman, Bickenbach,\nand Wachbroit (eds.), <em>Quality of Life and Human Difference:\nGenetic Testing, Health Care and Disability</em>, New York: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 101\u2013120.", "Anst\u00f6tz, C., 1993, \u201cShould a brain-dead pregnant woman\ncarry her child to full term?
