    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of political representation is misleadingly simple:\neveryone seems to know what it is, yet few can agree on any particular\ndefinition. In fact, there is an extensive literature that offers many\ndifferent definitions of this elusive concept. [Classic treatments of\nthe concept of political representations within this literature\ninclude Pennock and Chapman 1968; Pitkin, 1967 and Schwartz, 1988.]\nHanna Pitkin (1967) provides, perhaps, one of the most straightforward\ndefinitions: to represent is simply to \u201cmake present\nagain.\u201d On this definition, political representation is the\nactivity of making citizens\u2019 voices, opinions, and perspectives\n\u201cpresent\u201d in public policy making processes. Political\nrepresentation occurs when political actors speak, advocate,\nsymbolize, and act on the behalf of others in the political arena. In\nshort, political representation is a kind of political assistance.\nThis seemingly straightforward definition, however, is not adequate as\nit stands. For it leaves the concept of political representation\nunderspecified. Indeed, as we will see, the concept of political\nrepresentation has multiple and competing dimensions: our common\nunderstanding of political representation is one that contains\ndifferent, and conflicting, conceptions of how political\nrepresentatives should represent and so holds representatives to\nstandards that are mutually incompatible. In leaving these dimensions\nunderspecified, this definition fails to capture this paradoxical\ncharacter of the concept.\n\nThis encyclopedia entry has three main goals. The first is to provide\na general overview of the meaning of political representation,\nidentifying the key components of this concept. The second is to\nhighlight several important advances that have been made by the\ncontemporary literature on political representation. These advances\npoint to new forms of political representation, ones that are not\nlimited to the relationship between formal representatives and their\nconstituents. The third goal is to reveal several persistent problems\nwith theories of political representation and thereby to propose some\nfuture areas of research.\n",
