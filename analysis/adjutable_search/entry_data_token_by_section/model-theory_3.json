Given two\nlanguages \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\), we can compare them by asking whether\nevery class \\(\\Mod(S)\\), with \\(S\\) a sentence of \\(L\\), is also a\nclass of the form \\(\\Mod(S')\\) where \\(S'\\) is a sentence of \\(L'\\).\nIf the answer is Yes, we say that \\(L\\) is reducible to\n\\(L'\\), or that \\(L'\\) is at least as expressive as \\(L\\).\n\n\nFor example if \\(L\\) is a first-order language with identity, whose\nsignature consists of 1-ary predicate symbols, and \\(L'\\) is the\nlanguage whose sentences consist of the four syllogistic forms (All\n\\(A\\) are \\(B\\), Some \\(A\\) are \\(B\\), No \\(A\\) are \\(B\\), Some \\(A\\)\nare not \\(B)\\) using the same predicate symbols, then \\(L'\\) is\nreducible to \\(L\\), because the syllogistic forms are expressible in\nfirst-order logic. (There are some quarrels about which is the right\nway to express them; see the entry on the traditional\n square of opposition.)\n But the first-order language \\(L\\) is certainly not reducible to the\nlanguage \\(L'\\) of syllogisms, since in \\(L\\) we can write down a\nsentence saying that exactly three elements satisfy \\(Px\\), and there\nis no way of saying this using just the syllogistic forms. Or moving\nthe other way, if we form a third language \\(L''\\) by adding to \\(L\\)\nthe quantifier \\(Qx\\) with the meaning \u201cThere are uncountably\nmany elements \\(x\\) such that \u2026\u201d, then trivially \\(L\\) is\nreducible to \\(L''\\), but the downward Loewenheim-Skolem theorem shows\nat once that \\(L''\\) is not reducible to \\(L\\).\n\nThese notions are useful for analysing the strength of database query\nlanguages. We can think of the possible states of a database as\nstructures, and a simple Yes/No query becomes a sentence that elicits\nthe answer Yes if the database is a model of it and No otherwise. If\none database query language is not reducible to another, then the\nfirst can express some query that can\u2019t be expressed in the\nsecond.\n\nSo we need techniques for comparing the expressive strengths of\nlanguages. One of the most powerful techniques available consists of\nthe back-and-forth games of Ehrenfeucht and Fra\u00efss\u00e9\nbetween the two players Spoiler and Duplicator; see the entry on\n logic and games\n for details. Imagine for example that we play the usual first-order\nback-and-forth game \\(G\\) between two structures \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The\ntheory of these games establishes that if some first-order sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) is true in exactly one of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then there is a\nnumber \\(n\\), calculable from \\(\\phi\\), with the property that Spoiler\nhas a strategy for \\(G\\) that will guarantee that he wins in at most\n\\(n\\) steps. So conversely, to show that first-order logic can\u2019t\ndistinguish between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), it suffices to show that for\nevery finite \\(n\\), Duplicator has a strategy that will guarantee she\ndoesn\u2019t lose \\(G\\) in the first \\(n\\) steps. If we succeed in\nshowing this, it follows that any language which does distinguish\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is not reducible to the first-order language\nof the structures \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nThese back-and-forth games are immensely flexible. For a start, they\nmake just as much sense on finite structures as they do on infinite;\nmany other techniques of classical model theory assume that the\nstructures are infinite. They can also be adapted smoothly to many\nnon-first-order languages.\n\nIn 1969 Per Lindstr\u00f6m used back-and-forth games to give some\nabstract characterisations of first-order logic in terms of its\nexpressive power. One of his theorems says that if \\(L\\) is a language\nwith a signature \\(K, L\\) is closed under all the first-order\nsyntactic operations, and \\(L\\) obeys the downward Loewenheim-Skolem\ntheorem for single sentences, and the compactness theorem, then \\(L\\)\nis reducible to the first-order language of signature \\(K\\). These\ntheorems are very attractive; see Chapter XII of Ebbinghaus, Flum and\nThomas for a good account. But they have never quite lived up to their\npromise. It has been hard to find any similar characterisations of\nother logics. Even for first-order logic it is a little hard to see\nexactly what the characterisations tell us. But very roughly speaking,\nthey tell us that first-order logic is the unique logic with two\nproperties: (1) we can use it to express arbitrarily complicated\nthings about finite patterns, and (2) it is hopeless for\ndiscriminating between one infinite cardinal and another.\n\nThese two properties (1) and (2) are just the properties of\nfirst-order logic that allowed Abraham Robinson to build his\nnonstandard analysis. The background is that Leibniz, when he\ninvented differential and integral calculus, used infinitesimals, i.e.\nnumbers that are greater than 0 and smaller than all of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4\netc. Unfortunately there are no such real numbers. During the\nnineteenth century all definitions and proofs in the Leibniz style\nwere rewritten to talk of limits instead of infinitesimals. Now let\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) be the structure consisting of the field of real\nnumbers together with any structural features we care to give names\nto: certainly plus and times, maybe the ordering, the set of integers,\nthe functions sin and log, etc. Let \\(L\\) be the first-order language\nwhose signature is that of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Because of the expressive\nstrength of \\(L\\), we can write down any number of theorems of\ncalculus as sentences of \\(L\\). Because of the expressive weakness of\n\\(L\\), there is no way that we can express in \\(L\\) that\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) has no infinitesimals. In fact Robinson used the\ncompactness theorem to build a structure \\(\\mathbb{R}'\\) that is a\nmodel of exactly the same sentences of \\(L\\) as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), but\nwhich has infinitesimals. As Robinson showed, we can copy\nLeibniz\u2019s arguments using the infinitesimals in \\(\\mathbb{R}'\\),\nand so prove that various theorems of calculus are true in\n\\(\\mathbb{R}'\\). But these theorems are expressible in \\(L\\), so they\nmust also be true in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nSince arguments using infinitesimals are usually easier to visualise\nthan arguments using limits, nonstandard analysis is a helpful tool\nfor mathematical analysts. Jacques Fleuriot in his Ph.D. thesis (2001)\nautomated the proof theory of nonstandard analysis and used it to\nmechanise some of the proofs in Newton\u2019s Principia.\n",
