    "main_text": "Brownian Motion || The Density Distribution of Brownian Particles\n6.1 The Density Distribution of Brownian Particles\n\n\nBrownian motion is the fluctuating motion of particles of an emulsion\nvisible through a microscope. Two features of it led physicists in the\nlate nineteenth century to suspect that it was caused by the molecular\nmotions assumed in the kinetic theory. Those two features were its\npermanence and its random character. Perrin\u2019s experiments of\n1908 were able to give precision to those suspicions. He was able to\nshow that the motions of the particles are indeed random, in a\ntechnical sense, and he showed that the general features of the motion\nare permanent, once equilibrium has been reached. The density\ndistribution and mean free path of the particles remain constant at\nconstant temperature. The kinetic theory had a ready explanation of\nthese features, attributing the randomness to the randomness of the\nmotions of the molecules making up the liquid in which the emulsion\nwas suspended, and the equilibrium conditions as a dynamic equilibrium\ncorresponding to the distribution of velocities formalised by Maxwell.\nThose wishing to resist the conclusion that Brownian motion\nconstituted strong evidence for the kinetic theory needed to offer\nsome alternative explanation for the two features.\n\n\nThe randomness of the motion rules out causes, such as convection\ncurrents in the liquid, which operate on a scale larger than the\ndimensions of the particles. Causes of that kind would lead to\ncorrelations between the motions of neighbouring particles and that is\nprecisely what is ruled out by a truly random motion of particles. The\npermanence of the motion is a puzzle because the particles, moving\nthrough a viscous liquid, will be slowed down, losing heat to the\nliquid, suggesting that the whole motion should come to a halt just as\na sizeable object such as a cricket ball, projected into a liquid,\nwill be brought to rest. General, quantitative features of\nPerrin\u2019s results made life difficult for the anti-atomists, but\nthere was yet more to his case.\n\n\nAs was observed in \n Section 5.3, \n it had been experimentally established that the osmotic pressure of a\nsolute in small concentrations obeys the gas laws. A natural step from\nthe point of view of the kinetic theory is to assume that the\ndifference between the molecules of a solute distributed through the\nliquid in which it is dissolved and Brownian particles all of like\nsize suspended in a liquid is simply one of scale. Einstein (1905,\n1906,1907) was the first to stress this point and to give a detailed\naccount of Brownian motion as a thermal agitation. Perrin's initial\nwork on the density distribution of Brownian particles seems to have\nbeen carried out in ignorance of Einstein's paper. But it was soon\nbrought to his attention and influenced his subsequent work with full\nacknowledgment given to Einstein.\n\n\nPerrin's observations revealed that the density distribution of\nBrownian particles decreased exponentially with height. He was able to\nexplain this quantitatively by appeal to Newtonian mechanics and\nstatistics. Because of the decrease in their density with height, more\nparticles per second strike a unit area of the lower surface of a thin\nhorizontal layer in the liquid than will strike a unit area of the\nupper surface. As a result there will be a net pressure directed\nupwards. Perrin was able to derive a value for the pressure in terms of\nthe number of particles per unit volume, their mass and the mean of\nthe squares of their velocities. Equilibrium is reached when the\nupwards force due to the pressure is equal to the weight of the\nparticles arising from the excess of the density of the material of\nthe particles over that of the suspending liquid. The resulting\nequation, when integrated, showed the density of the particle\ndistribution to vary exponentially with height and also enabled Perrin\nto calculate a value for the mean kinetic energy of the Brownian\nparticles from the measured variation in density of the particle\ndistribution. It transpired that the mean kinetic energy depended only\non temperature and was independent of the material of the particles,\ntheir size and the density of the liquid in which the particles were\nsuspended.\n\n\nOnce Perrin was able to calculate the mean kinetic energy of the\nBrownian particles he could support the most basic assumptions of\nkinetic theory without a need to complicate matters by adding\nadditional hypotheses. From the point of view of the kinetic theory,\nsystems are in equilibrium when the mean kinetic energy of the\nmolecules in those systems are equal, with particle collisions being\nthe mechanism by means of which equilibrium is reached. Brownian\nparticles constitute a system that differs from the molecules\nconstituting a gas only quantitatively, not qualitatively. If a system\nof Brownian particles is in thermal equilibrium with a gas at some\ntemperature, T, then, from the point of view of the kinetic\ntheory, the mean kinetic energy of the particles must be equal to\nthat of the molecules of the gas. By measuring the mean kinetic energy\nof Brownian particles from the observable density distribution at\ntemperature, Tr, Perrin had in effect measured the mean\nkinetic energy of the molecules of a gas at that temperature. That\nknowledge enabled him to calculate Avogadro's number. As Perrin (1990,\n104) remarked, it was with \u2018the liveliest emotion\u2019 that he\nfound that number to be in accord with previous, more indirect,\nestimates of Avogadro's number.\n\n\nPerrin stressed the extent to which the value for Avogadro\u2019s\nnumber yielded by his experiments on density distribution formed the\nbasis of a strong argument from coincidence for the kinetic theory.\nPerrin posed the question of what density distribution of Brownian\nparticles might have been suspected prior to his experiments if the\nkinetic theory is ignored. Since the particles were denser than the\nliquid in which they were suspended, a reasonable assumption might be\nthat the particles fall to the bottom so that the density distribution\nis zero. This experimental result, substituted into Perrin\u2019s\nformula, would have led to an infinitely large value for\nN. Another plausible assumption might have attributed an even\ndistribution to the suspended particles. Such an outcome would have\nled to a value of zero for N. A decrease in density with\nheight yields some value in between these two extremes. Prior to the\nexperiment, then, the range of plausible results to be expected from\nfeeding the measured distribution into Perrin's equation, derived on\nthe basis of the kinetic theory, is immense. And yet the outcome was a\nnumber very close to that predicted by the kinetic theory.\n",
