    "main_text": "The science of happiness || Can happiness be measured?\n3.1 Can happiness be measured?\n\nWith the explosive rise of empirical research on happiness, a central\nquestion is how far, and how, happiness might be\n measured.[11]\n There seems to be no in-principle barrier to the idea of measuring,\nat least roughly, how happy people are. Investigators may never enjoy\nthe precision of the \u201chedonimeter\u201d once envisaged by\nEdgeworth to show just how happy a person is (Edgeworth 1881). Indeed,\nsuch a device might be impossible even in principle, since happiness\nmight involve multiple dimensions that either cannot be precisely\nquantified or summed together. If so, it could still be feasible to\ndevelop approximate measures of happiness, or at least its various\ndimensions. Similarly, depression may not admit of precise\nquantification in a single number, yet many useful if imprecise\nmeasures of depression exist. In the case of happiness, it is\nplausible that even current measures provide information about how\nanxious, cheerful, satisfied, etc. people are, and thus tell us\nsomething about their happiness. Even the simplest self-report\nmeasures used in the literature have been found to correlate well with\nmany intuitively relevant variables, such as friends\u2019 reports,\nsmiling, physiological measures, health, longevity, and so forth\n(Pavot 2008).\n\nImportantly, most scientific research needs only to discern patterns\nacross large numbers of individuals\u2014to take an easy case,\ndetermining whether widows tend to be less happy than\nnewlyweds\u2014and this is compatible with substantial unreliability\nin assessing individual happiness. Similarly, an inaccurate\nthermometer might be a poor guide to the temperature, but readings from\nmany such thermometers could correlate fairly well with actual\ntemperatures\u2014telling us, for instance, that Minnesota is colder\nthan Florida.\n\nThis point reveals an important caveat: measures of happiness could\ncorrelate well with how happy people are, thus telling us which groups\nof people tend to be happier, while being completely wrong about\nabsolute levels of happiness. Self-reports of happiness, for\ninstance, might correctly indicate that unemployed people are\nconsiderably less happy than those with jobs. But every one of those\nreports could be wrong, say if everyone is unhappy yet claims to be\nhappy, or vice-versa, so long as the unemployed report lower happiness\nthan the employed. Similarly, bad thermometers may show that Minnesota\nis colder than Florida without giving the correct temperature.\n\nTwo morals emerge from these reflections. First, self-report measures\nof happiness could be reliable guides to relative happiness,\nthough telling us little about how happy, in absolute terms, people\nare. We may know who is happier, that is, but not whether people are\nin fact happy. Second, even comparisons of relative happiness will be\ninaccurate if the groups being compared systematically bias\ntheir reports in different ways. This worry is particularly acute for\ncross-cultural comparisons of happiness, where differing norms about\nhappiness may undermine the comparability of self-reports. The French\nmight report lower happiness than Americans, for instance, not because\ntheir lives are less satisfying or pleasant, but because they tend to\nput a less positive spin on things. For this reason it may be useful\nto employ instruments, including narrower questions or physiological\nmeasures, that are less prone to cultural\n biasing.[12]\n\nThe discussion thus far has assumed that people can be wrong about how\nhappy they are. Is this plausible? Some have argued that (sincerely)\nself-reported happiness cannot, even in principle, be mistaken. If you\nthink you\u2019re happy, goes a common sentiment, then you\nare happy. This claim is not plausible on a hedonistic or\nemotional state view of happiness, since those theories take judgments\nof happiness to encompass not just how one is feeling at the moment\nbut also past states, and memories of those can obviously be spurious.\nFurther, it has been argued that even judgments of how one feels at\nthe present moment may often be mistaken, particularly regarding moods\nlike\n anxiety.[13]\n\nThe idea that sincere self-reports of happiness are incorrigible can\nonly be correct, it seems, given a quite specific conception of\nhappiness\u2014a kind of life satisfaction theory of happiness on\nwhich people count as satisfied with their lives so long as they are\ndisposed to judge explicitly that they are satisfied with their lives\non the whole. Also assumed here is that self-reports of happiness are\nin fact wholly grounded in life satisfaction judgments like\nthese\u2014that is, that people take questions about\n\u201chappiness\u201d to be questions about life satisfaction. Given\nthese assumptions, we can plausibly conclude that self-reports of\nhappiness are incorrigible. One question is whether happiness, thus\nconceived, is very important. As well, it is unlikely that respondents\ninvariably interpret happiness questions as being about life\nsatisfaction. At any rate, even life satisfaction theorists might balk\nat this variant of the account, since life satisfaction is sometimes\ntaken to involve, not just explicit global judgments of life\nsatisfaction, but also our responses to the particular things or\ndomains we care about. Some will hesitate to deem satisfied people who\nhate many of the important things in their lives, however satisfied\nthey claim to be with their lives as a whole.\n\nIn a similar vein, the common practice of measuring happiness simply\nby asking people to report explicitly on how \u201chappy\u201d they\nare is sometimes defended on the grounds that it lets people decide\nfor themselves what happiness is. The reasoning again seems to\npresuppose, controversially, that self-reports of happiness employ a\nlife satisfaction view of happiness, the idea being that whether you\nare satisfied (\u201chappy\u201d) will depend on what you care\nabout. Alternatively, the point might be literally to leave it up to\nthe respondent to decide whether \u2018happy\u2019 means hedonic\nstate, emotional state, life satisfaction, or something else. Thus one\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d might mean \u201cmy\nexperience is generally pleasant,\u201d while another\u2019s might\nmean \u201cI am satisfied with my life as a whole.\u201d It is not\nclear, however, that asking ambiguous questions of this sort is a\nuseful enterprise, since different respondents will in effect be\nanswering different questions.\n\nTo measure happiness through self-reports, then, it may be wiser to\nemploy terms other than \u2018happiness\u2019 and its\ncognates\u2014terms whose meaning is relatively well-known and fixed.\nIn other words, researchers should decide in advance what they want to\nmeasure\u2014be it life satisfaction, hedonic state, emotional state,\nor something else\u2014and then ask questions that refer\nunambiguously to those\n states.[14]\n This stratagem may be all the more necessary in cross-cultural work,\nwhere finding suitable translations of \u2018happy\u2019 can be\ndaunting\u2014particularly when the English meaning of the term\nremains a matter of contention (Wierzbicka 2004).\n\nThis entry focuses on subjective well-being studies, since that work\nis standardly deemed \u201chappiness\u201d research. But\npsychological research on well-being can take other forms, notably in\nthe \u201ceudaimonic\u201d\u2014commonly opposed to\n\u201chedonic\u201d\u2014literature, which assesses a broader range\nof indicators taken to represent objective human needs, such as\nmeaning, personal growth, relatedness, autonomy, competence,\n etc.[15]\n (The assimilation of subjective well-being to the\n\u201chedonic\u201d realm may be misleading, since life satisfaction\nseems primarily to be a non-hedonic value, as noted earlier.)\nOther well-being instruments may not clearly fall under either the\n\u201chappiness\u201d or eudaimonic rubrics, for instance extending\nsubjective well-being measures by adding questions about the extent to\nwhich activities are seen as meaningful or worthwhile (White and Dolan\n2009). An important question going forward is how far well-being\nresearch needs to incorporate indicators beyond subjective\nwell-being.\n",
