    "main_text": "The Nature of Envy || Envy vs. Jealousy\n1.2 Envy vs. Jealousy\n\nOrdinary language tends to conflate envy and jealousy. The\nphilosophical consensus is that these are distinct emotions.While it\nis linguistically acceptable to say that one is jealous upon hearing\nabout another\u2019s vacation, say, it has been plausibly argued that one\nis feeling envy, if either, in such a case. According to Farrell\n(1980) and Neu (1980), both envy and jealousy are three-place\nrelations; but this superficial similarity conceals an important\ndifference. Jealousy involves three parties, the subject, the rival,\nand the beloved; and the jealous person\u2019s real locus of concern is the\nbeloved, a person (or being) whose affection he is losing or fears\nlosing. The locus of concern in jealousy is not the rival. Whereas\nenvy is a two party relation, with a third relatum that is a good\n(albeit a good that could be a particular person\u2019s affections); and\nthe envious person\u2019s locus of concern is the rival. \n\nOn this way of distinguishing envy from jealousy there is a difference\nbetween them even when the good that the rival has is the affection of\nanother\n person.[2]\n Roughly, for the jealous person the rival is fungible and the beloved\nis not fungible. So he would be equally bothered if the beloved were\nconsorting with someone else, and would not be bothered if the rival\nwere. Whereas in envy it is the other way around. Because envy is\ncentrally focused on competition with the rival, the subject might\nwell be equally bothered if the rival were consorting with a different\n(appealing) person, but would not be bothered if the\n\u2018good\u2019 had gone to someone else (with whom the subject was\nnot in competition). Whatever the ordinary meaning of the terms\n\u2018envy\u2019 and \u2018jealousy,\u2019 these considerations\ndemonstrate that these two distinct syndromes need to be\ndistinguished.\n",
