    "main_text": "Questions about Realism and Explanation || Taking Stock\n5.3 Taking Stock\n\nKellert\u2019s discussion of \u201cdynamic understanding\u201d\nand Peter Smith\u2019s critical remarks both overlap in their agreement that\nvarious robust or universal features of chaos are important for chaos\nstudies The idea of focusing on universal features such as patterns,\ncritical numbers, and so forth suggests that some form of unification\naccount of explanation is what is at work in chaos explanations: group\ntogether all examples of chaotic behavior via universal patterns and\nother features (e.g., period doubling sequences). There is disagreement\non the extent to which the methodologies of current chaos research\npresent any radically new challenges to the project of scientific\nexplanation.\n\n\nEven if there is not something radically new here regarding\nscientific explanation, the kind of understanding provided by chaos\nmodels is challenging to clarify. One problem is that this\n\u201cdynamic understanding\u201d appears to be descriptive only.\nThat is, Kellert seems to be saying we understand how chaos arises when\nwe can point to a period doubling sequence or to the presence of a\nstrange attractor, for instance. But this appears to be only providing\ndistinguishing marks for chaos rather than yielding genuine insight\ninto what lies behind the behavior, i.e., the cause of the\nbehavior. Kellert eschews causes regarding chaos explanations and there\nis a fairly straightforward reason for this: The simplified models of\nchaos appear to be just mathematics (e.g., one dimensional maps)\nbased on the original nonlinear equations. In other words, it\nlooks as if the causes have been squeezed out! So the question of\nwhether causal, unificationist or some other approach to scientific\nexplanation best captures chaos research remains open.\n\n\nMoreover, since all these simplified models use roughly the same\nmathematics, why should we think it is surprising that we see the same\npatterns arise over and over again in disparate models? After all, if\nall the traces of processes and interactions\u2014the\ncauses\u2014have been removed from chaos models, as Kellert suggests,\nwhy should it be surprising that chaos models in physics, biology,\neconomics and social psychology exhibit similar behavior? If it really\nboils down to the same mathematics in all the models, then what is it\nwe are actually coming to understand by using these models? On the\nother hand, perhaps chaos studies are uncovering universal patterns\nthat exist in the actual world, not just in mathematics. Identifying\nthese universal patterns is one thing, explaining them is another.\n\n",
