    "main_text": "The Epistemological Status of Computer Science || Computer Science as an Engineering Discipline\n8.2 Computer Science as an Engineering Discipline\n\nIn the late 1970s, the increasing number of applications of\ncomputational systems in everyday contexts, and the consequent booming\nof market demands caused a deviation of interests for computer\nscientists in Academia and in Industry: from focusing on methods of\nproving programs\u2019 correctness, they turned to methods for\nmanaging complexity and evaluating the reliability of those system\n(Wegner 1976). Indeed, expressing formally the specifications,\nstructure, and input of highly complex programs embedded in larger\nsystems and interacting with users is practically impossible, and\nhence providing mathematical proofs of their correctness becomes\nmostly unfeasible. Computer science research developed in the\ndirection of testing techniques able to provide a statistical\nevaluation of correctness, often called reliability (Littlewood and\nStrigini 2000), in terms of estimation of error distributions in a\nprogram\u2019s code.\n\nIn line with this engineering account of computer science is the\nthesis that reliability of computational systems is evaluated in the\nsame way that civil engineering does for bridges and aerospace\nengineering for airplanes (DeMillo et al. 1979). In\nparticular, whereas empirical sciences examine what exists, computer\nscience focuses on what can exist, i.e., on how to produce\nartifacts, and it should be therefore acknowledged as an\n\u201cengineering of mathematics\u201d (Hartmanis 1981). Similarly,\nwhereas scientific inquiries are involved in discovering laws\nconcerning the phenomena under observation, one cannot identify proper\nlaws in computer science practice, insofar as the latter is rather\ninvolved in the production of phenomena concerning computational\nartifacts (Brooks 1996).\n",
