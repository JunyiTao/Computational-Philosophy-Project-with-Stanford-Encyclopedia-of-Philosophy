    "main_text": "Approaches to AI || Non-Logicist AI: A Summary\n3.3 Non-Logicist AI: A Summary\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to define non-logicist AI by negation: an approach\nto building intelligent agents that rejects the distinguishing\nfeatures of logicist AI. Such a shortcut would imply that the agents\nengineered by non-logicist AI researchers and developers, whatever the\nvirtues of such agents might be, cannot be said to know that \\(\\phi\\);\n\u2013 for the simple reason that, by negation, the non-logicist\nparadigm would have not even a single declarative proposition that is\na candidate for \\(\\phi\\);. However, this isn\u2019t a particularly\nenlightening way to define non-symbolic AI. A more productive approach\nis to say that non-symbolic AI is AI carried out on the basis of\nparticular formalisms other than logical systems, and to then\nenumerate those formalisms. It will turn out, of course, that these\nformalisms fail to include knowledge in the normal sense. (In\nphilosophy, as is well-known, the normal sense is one according to\nwhich if \\(p\\) is known, \\(p\\) is a declarative statement.) \n\nFrom the standpoint of formalisms other than logical systems,\nnon-logicist AI can be partitioned into symbolic but non-logicist\napproaches, and connectionist/neurocomputational approaches. (AI\ncarried out on the basis of symbolic, declarative structures that, for\nreadability and ease of use, are not treated directly by researchers\nas elements of formal logics, does not count. In this category fall\ntraditional semantic networks, Schank\u2019s (1972) conceptual\ndependency scheme, frame-based schemes, and other such schemes.) The\nformer approaches, today, are probabilistic, and are based on the\nformalisms (Bayesian networks) covered\n below.\n The latter approaches are based, as we have noted, on formalisms that\ncan be broadly termed \u201cneurocomputational.\u201d Given our\nspace constraints, only one of the formalisms in this category is\ndescribed here (and briefly at that): the aforementioned artificial\nneural\n networks.[30].\n Though artificial neural networks, with an appropriate architecture,\ncould be used for arbitrary computation, they are almost exclusively\nused for building learning systems. \n\nNeural nets are composed of units or nodes designed to\nrepresent neurons, which are connected by links designed to\nrepresent dendrites, each of which has a numeric weight.\n\n\n\nA \u201cNeuron\u201d Within an Artificial Neural Network (from\nAIMA3e)\n\n\nIt is usually assumed that some of the units work in symbiosis with\nthe external environment; these units form the sets of input\nand output units. Each unit has a current activation\nlevel, which is its output, and can compute, based on its inputs\nand weights on those inputs, its activation level at the next moment\nin time. This computation is entirely local: a unit takes account of\nbut its neighbors in the net. This local computation is calculated in\ntwo stages. First, the input function, \\(in_i\\), gives the\nweighted sum of the unit\u2019s input values, that is, the sum of the\ninput activations multiplied by their weights:  \n\n\\[\nin_i = \\displaystyle\\sum_j W_{ji} a_j\n\\]\n\n\nIn the second stage, the activation function, \\(g\\), takes the\ninput from the first stage as argument and generates the output, or\nactivation level, \\(a_i\\):  \n\n\\[\na_i = g(in_i) = g \\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_j W_{ji}a_j\\right)\n\\]\n\n\nOne common (and confessedly elementary) choice for the activation\nfunction (which usually governs all units in a given net) is the step\nfunction, which usually has a threshold \\(t\\) that sees to it that a 1\nis output when the input is greater than \\(t\\), and that 0 is output\notherwise. This is supposed to be \u201cbrain-like\u201d to some\ndegree, given that 1 represents the firing of a pulse from a neuron\nthrough an axon, and 0 represents no firing. A simple three-layer\nneural net is shown in the following picture.\n\n\n\nA Simple Three-Layer Artificial Neural Network (from\nAIMA3e)\n\n\nAs you might imagine, there are many different kinds of neural\nnetworks. The main distinction is between feed-forward and\nrecurrent networks. In feed-forward networks like the one\npictured immediately above, as their name suggests, links move\ninformation in one direction, and there are no cycles; recurrent\nnetworks allow for cycling back, and can become rather complicated.\nFor a more detailed presentation, see the\n\nSupplement on Neural Nets.\n \n\nNeural networks were fundamentally plagued by the fact that while they\nare simple and have theoretically efficient learning algorithms, when\nthey are multi-layered and thus sufficiently expressive to represent\nnon-linear functions, they were very hard to train in practice. This\nchanged in the mid 2000s with the advent of methods that exploit\nstate-of-the-art hardware better (Rajat et al. 2009). The\nbackpropagation method for training multi-layered neural networks can\nbe translated into a sequence of repeated simple arithmetic operations\non a large set of numbers. The general trend in computing hardware has\nfavored algorithms that are able to do a large of number of simple\noperations that are not that dependent on each other, versus a small\nof number of complex and intricate operations.\n\nAnother key recent observation is that deep neural networks can be\npre-trained first in an unsupervised phase where they are just fed\ndata without any labels for the data. Each hidden layer is forced to\nrepresent the outputs of the layer below. The outcome of this training\nis a series of layers which represent the input domain with increasing\nlevels of abstraction. For example, if we pre-train the network with\nimages of faces, we would get a first layer which is good at detecting\nedges in images, a second layer which can combine edges to form facial\nfeatures such as eyes, noses etc., a third layer which responds to\ngroups of features, and so on (LeCun et al. 2015).\n\nPerhaps the best technique for teaching students about neural networks\nin the context of other statistical learning formalisms and methods is\nto focus on a specific problem, preferably one that seems unnatural to\ntackle using logicist techniques. The task is then to seek to engineer\na solution to the problem, using any and all techniques\navailable. One nice problem is handwriting recognition (which\nalso happens to have a rich philosophical dimension; see e.g.\nHofstadter & McGraw 1995). For example, consider the problem of\nassigning, given as input a handwritten digit \\(d\\), the correct\ndigit, 0 through 9. Because there is a database of 60,000 labeled\ndigits available to researchers (from the National Institute of\nScience and Technology), this problem has evolved into a benchmark\nproblem for comparing learning algorithms. It turns out that neural\nnetworks currently reign as the best approach to the problem according\nto a recent ranking by Benenson (2016).\n\nReaders interested in AI (and computational cognitive science) pursued\nfrom an overtly brain-based orientation are encouraged to explore the\nwork of Rick Granger (2004a, 2004b) and researchers in his\n Brain Engineering Laboratory\n and\n W. H. Neukom Institute for Computational Sciences.\n The contrast between the \u201cdry\u201d, logicist AI started at\nthe original 1956 conference, and the approach taken here by Granger\nand associates (in which brain circuitry is directly modeled) is\nremarkable. For those interested in computational properties of neural\nnetworks, Hornik et al. (1989) address the general representation\ncapability of neural networks independent of learning. \n3.4 AI Beyond the Clash of Paradigms\n\nAt this point the reader has been exposed to the chief formalisms in\nAI, and may wonder about heterogeneous approaches that bridge them. Is\nthere such research and development in AI? Yes. From an\nengineering standpoint, such work makes irresistibly good\nsense. There is now an understanding that, in order to build\napplications that get the job done, one should choose from a toolbox\nthat includes logicist, probabilistic/Bayesian, and neurocomputational\ntechniques. Given that the original top-down logicist paradigm is\nalive and thriving (e.g., see Brachman & Levesque 2004, Mueller\n2006), and that, as noted, a resurgence of Bayesian and\nneurocomputational approaches has placed these two paradigms on solid,\nfertile footing as well, AI now moves forward, armed with this\nfundamental triad, and it is a virtual certainty that applications\n(e.g., robots) will be engineered by drawing from elements of all\nthree. Watson\u2019s DeepQA architecture is one recent example of an\nengineering system that leverages multiple paradigms. For a detailed\ndiscussion, see the\n\nSupplement on Watson\u2019s DeepQA Architecture.\n \n\nGoogle DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo is another example of a multi-paradigm\nsystem, although in a much narrower form than Watson. The central\nalgorithmic problem in games such as Go or Chess is to search through\na vast sequence of valid moves. For most non-trivial games, this is\nnot feasible to do so exhaustively. The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)\nalgorithm gets around this obstacle by searching through an enormous\nspace of valid moves in a statistical fashion (Browne et al. 2012).\nWhile MCTS is the central algorithm in AlpaGo, there are two neural\nnetworks which help evaluate states in the game and help model how\nexpert opponents play (Silver et al. 2016). It should be noted that\nMCTS is behind almost all the winning submissions in general game\nplaying (Finnsson 2012).\n\nWhat, though, about deep, theoretical integration of the main\nparadigms in AI? Such integration is at present only a possibility for\nthe future, but readers are directed to the research of some striving\nfor such integration. For example: Sun (1994, 2002) has been working\nto demonstrate that human cognition that is on its face symbolic in\nnature (e.g., professional philosophizing in the analytic tradition,\nwhich deals explicitly with arguments and definitions carefully\nsymbolized) can arise from cognition that is neurocomputational in\nnature. Koller (1997) has investigated the marriage between\nprobability theory and logic. And, in general, the very recent arrival\nof so-called human-level AI is being led by theorists seeking\nto genuinely integrate the three paradigms set out above (e.g.,\nCassimatis 2006).\n\nFinally, we note that cognitive architectures such as Soar\n(Laird 2012) and PolyScheme (Cassimatis 2006) are another area where\nintegration of different fields of AI can be found. For example, one\nsuch endeavor striving to build human-level AI is the Companions\nproject (Forbus and Hinrichs 2006). Companions are long-lived systems\nthat strive to be human-level AI systems that function as\ncollaborators with humans. The Companions architecture tries to solve\nmultiple AI problems such as reasoning and learning, interactivity,\nand longevity in one unifying system.\n4. The Explosive Growth of AI\n\nAs we noted above, work on AI has mushroomed over the past couple of\ndecades. Now that we have looked a bit at the content that composes\nAI, we take a quick look at the explosive growth of AI.\n\nFirst, a point of clarification. The growth of which we speak is not a\nshallow sort correlated with amount of funding provided for a given\nsub-field of AI. That kind of thing happens all the time in all\nfields, and can be triggered by entirely political and financial\nchanges designed to grow certain areas, and diminish others. Along the\nsame line, the growth of which we speak is not correlated with the\namount of industrial activity revolving around AI (or a sub-field\nthereof); for this sort of growth too can be driven by forces quite\noutside an expansion in the scientific breadth of\n AI.[31]\n Rather, we are speaking of an explosion of deep content: new\nmaterial which someone intending to be conversant with the field needs\nto know. Relative to other fields, the size of the explosion may or\nmay not be unprecedented. (Though it should perhaps be noted that an\nanalogous increase in philosophy would be marked by the development of\nentirely new formalisms for reasoning, reflected in the fact that,\nsay, longstanding philosophy textbooks like Copi\u2019s (2004)\nIntroduction to Logic are dramatically rewritten and enlarged\nto include these formalisms, rather than remaining anchored to\nessentially immutable core formalisms, with incremental refinement\naround the edges through the years.) But it certainly appears to be\nquite remarkable, and is worth taking note of here, if for no other\nreason than that AI\u2019s near-future will revolve in significant\npart around whether or not the new content in question forms a\nfoundation for new long-lived research and development that would not\notherwise\n obtain.[32]\n\nAI has also witnessed an explosion in its usage in various artifacts\nand applications. While we are nowhere near building a machine with\ncapabilities of a human or one that acts rationally in all scenarios\naccording to the Russell/Hutter definition above, algorithms that have\ntheir origins in AI research are now widely deployed for many tasks in\na variety of domains. \n4.1 Bloom in Machine Learning\n\nA huge part of AI\u2019s growth in applications has been made\npossible through invention of new algorithms in the subfield of\nmachine learning. Machine learning is concerned with building\nsystems that improve their performance on a task when given examples\nof ideal performance on the task, or improve their performance with\nrepeated experience on the task. Algorithms from machine learning have\nbeen used in speech recognition systems, spam filters, online\nfraud-detection systems, product-recommendation systems, etc. The\ncurrent state-of-the-art in machine learning can be divided into three\nareas (Murphy 2013, Alpaydin 2014):\n\nSupervised Learning: A form of learning in which a computer\ntries to learn a function \\(\\ff\\) given examples, the training data\n\\(T\\), of its values at various points in its domain \n\n\\[\nT=\\left\\{\\left\\langle x_1, \\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle x_2, \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle, \\ldots, \\left\\langle x_n, \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle\\right\\}.\n\\] \n\n A\nsample task would be trying to label images of faces with a\nperson\u2019s name. The supervision in supervised learning comes in\nthe form of the value of the function \\(\\ff(x)\\) at various points\n\\(x\\) in some part of the domain of the function. This is usually\ngiven in the form of a fixed set of input and output pairs for the\nfunction. Let \\(\\hh\\) be the \u201clearned function.\u201d The goal\nof supervised learning is have \\({\\hh}\\) match as closely as possible\nthe true function \\({\\ff}\\) over the same domain. The error is\nusually defined in terms of an error function, for instance, \\(error =\n\\sum_{x\\in T} \\delta(\\ff(x) - \\hh(x))\\), over the training data \\(T\\).\nOther forms of supervision and goals for learning are possible. For\nexample, in active learning the learning algorithm can request\nthe value of the function for arbitrary inputs. Supervised learning\ndominates the field of machine learning and has been used in almost\nall practical applications mentioned just above. \nUnsupervised Learning: Here the machine tries to find\nuseful knowledge or information when given some raw data \\(\\left\\{\nx_1,x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\right\\}\\). There is no function associated with\nthe input that has to be learned. The idea is that the machine helps\nuncover interesting patterns or information that could be hidden in\nthe data. One use of unsupervised learning is data mining,\nwhere large volumes of data are searched for interesting information.\nPageRank, one of the earliest algorithms used by the Google\nsearch engine, can be considered to be an unsupervised learning system\nthat ranks pages without any human supervision (Chapter 14.10, Hastie\net al. 2009). \nReinforcement Learning: Here a machine is set loose in an\nenvironment where it constantly acts and perceives (similar to the\nRussell/Hutter view above) and only occasionally receives\nfeedback on its behavior in the form of rewards or punishments. The\nmachine has to learn to behave rationally from this feedback. One use\nof reinforcement learning has been in building agents to play computer\ngames. The objective here is to build agents that map sensory data\nfrom the game at every time instant to an action that would help win\nin the game or maximize a human player\u2019s enjoyment of the game.\nIn most games, we know how well we are playing only at the end of the\ngame or only at infrequent intervals throughout the game (e.g., a\nchess game that we feel we are winning could quickly turn against us\nat the end). In supervised learning, the training data has ideal\ninput-output pairs. This form of learning is not suitable for building\nagents that have to operate across a length of time and are judged not\non one action but a series of actions and their effects on the\nenvironment. The field of Reinforcement Learning tries to tackle this\nproblem through a variety of methods. Though a bit dated, Sutton and\nBarto (1998) provide a comprehensive introduction to the field. \n\n\nIn addition to being used in domains that are traditionally the ken of\nAI, machine-learning algorithms have also been used in all stages of\nthe scientific process. For example, machine-learning techniques are\nnow routinely applied to analyze large volumes of data generated from\nparticle accelerators. CERN, for instance, generates a petabyte\n(\\(10^{15}\\) bytes) per second, and statistical algorithms that have\ntheir origins in AI are used to filter and analyze this data. Particle\naccelerators are used in fundamental experimental research in physics\nto probe the structure of our physical universe. They work by\ncolliding larger particles together to create much finer particles.\nNot all such events are fruitful. Machine-learning methods have been\nused to select events which are then analyzed further (Whiteson &\nWhiteson 2009 and Baldi et al. 2014). More recently, researchers at\nCERN launched a machine learning\n  competition\n to aid in the analysis of the Higgs Boson. The goal of this challenge\nwas to develop algorithms that separate meaningful events from\nbackground noise given data from the Large Hadron Collider, a particle\naccelerator at CERN.\n\nIn the past few decades, there has been an explosion in data that does\nnot have any explicit semantics attached to it. This data is generated\nby both humans and machines. Most of this data is not easily\nmachine-processable; for example, images, text, video (as opposed to\ncarefully curated data in a knowledge- or data-base). This has given\nrise to a huge industry that applies AI techniques to get usable\ninformation from such enormous data. This field of applying techniques\nderived from AI to large volumes of data goes by names such as\n\u201cdata mining,\u201d \u201cbig data,\u201d\n\u201canalytics,\u201d etc. This field is too vast to even\nmoderately cover in the present article, but we note that there is no\nfull agreement on what constitutes such a \u201cbig-data\u201d\nproblem. One definition, from Madden (2012), is that big data differs\nfrom traditional machine-processable data in that it is too big (for\nmost of the existing state-of-the-art hardware), too quick (generated\nat a fast rate, e.g. online email transactions), or too hard. It is in\nthe too-hard part that AI techniques work quite well. While this\nuniverse is quite varied, we use the Watson\u2019s system later in\nthis article as an AI-relevant exemplar. As we will see later, while\nmost of this new explosion is powered by learning, it isn\u2019t\nentirely limited to just learning. This bloom in learning algorithms\nhas been supported by both a resurgence in neurocomputational\ntechniques and probabilistic techniques.\n4.2 The Resurgence of Neurocomputational Techniques\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects of (Charniak & McDermott 1985) is\nthis: The authors say the central dogma of AI is that \u201cWhat the\nbrain does may be thought of at some level as a kind of\ncomputation\u201d (p. 6). And yet nowhere in the book is brain-like\ncomputation discussed. In fact, you will search the index in vain for\nthe term \u2018neural\u2019 and its variants. Please note that the\nauthors are not to blame for this. A large part of AI\u2019s growth\nhas come from formalisms, tools, and techniques that are, in some\nsense, brain-based, not logic-based. A paper that conveys the\nimportance and maturity of neurocomputation is (Litt et al. 2006).\n(Growth has also come from a return of probabilistic techniques that\nhad withered by the mid-70s and 80s. More about that momentarily, in\nthe next \u201cresurgence\u201d\n section.)\n \n\nOne very prominent class of non-logicist formalism does make an\nexplicit nod in the direction of the brain: viz., artificial neural\nnetworks (or as they are often simply called, neural\nnetworks, or even just neural nets). (The structure of\nneural networks and more recent developments are discussed\n above).\n Because Minsky and Pappert\u2019s (1969) Perceptrons led many\n(including, specifically, many sponsors of AI research and\ndevelopment) to conclude that neural networks didn\u2019t have\nsufficient information-processing power to model human cognition, the\nformalism was pretty much universally dropped from AI. However, Minsky\nand Pappert had only considered very limited neural networks.\nConnectionism, the view that intelligence consists not in\nsymbolic processing, but rather non-symbolic processing at\nleast somewhat like what we find in the brain (at least at the\ncellular level), approximated specifically by artificial neural\nnetworks, came roaring back in the early 1980s on the strength of more\nsophisticated forms of such networks, and soon the situation was (to\nuse a metaphor introduced by John McCarthy) that of two horses in a\nrace toward building truly intelligent agents.\n\nIf one had to pick a year at which connectionism was resurrected, it\nwould certainly be 1986, the year Parallel Distributed\nProcessing (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986) appeared in print.\nThe rebirth of connectionism was specifically fueled by the\nback-propagation (backpropagation) algorithm over neural networks,\nnicely covered in Chapter 20 of AIMA. The\nsymbolicist/connectionist race led to a spate of lively debate in the\nliterature (e.g., Smolensky 1988, Bringsjord 1991), and some AI\nengineers have explicitly championed a methodology marked by a\nrejection of knowledge representation and reasoning. For example,\nRodney Brooks was such an engineer; he wrote the well-known\n\u201cIntelligence Without Representation\u201d (1991), and his Cog\nProject, to which we referred above, is arguably an incarnation of the\npremeditatedly non-logicist approach. Increasingly, however, those in\nthe business of building sophisticated systems find that both\nlogicist and more neurocomputational techniques are required (Wermter\n& Sun\n 2001).[33]\n In addition, the neurocomputational paradigm today includes\nconnectionism only as a proper part, in light of the fact that some of\nthose working on building intelligent systems strive to do so by\nengineering brain-based computation outside the neural network-based\napproach (e.g., Granger 2004a, 2004b). \n\nAnother recent resurgence in neurocomputational techniques has\noccurred in machine learning. The modus operandi in machine learning\nis that given a problem, say recognizing handwritten digits\n\\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,9\\}\\) or faces, from a 2D matrix representing an image\nof the digits or faces, a machine learning or a domain expert would\nconstruct a feature vector representation function for the\ntask. This function is a transformation of the input into a format\nthat tries to throw away irrelevant information in the input and keep\nonly information useful for the task. Inputs transformed by \\(\\rr\\)\nare termed features. For recognizing faces, irrelevant\ninformation could be the amount of lighting in the scene and relevant\ninformation could be information about facial features. The machine is\nthen fed a sequence of inputs represented by the features and the\nideal or ground truth output values for those inputs. This converts\nthe learning challenge from that of having to learn the function\n\\(\\ff\\) from the examples: \\(\\left\\{\\left\\langle x_1,\n\\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle x_2, \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle, \\ldots,\n\\left\\langle x_n, \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle \\right\\}\\) to having to learn\nfrom possibly easier data: \\(\\left\\{\\left\\langle \\rr(x_1),\n\\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle \\rr(x_2), \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle,\n\\ldots, \\left\\langle \\rr(x_n), \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle \\right\\}\\). Here\nthe function \\(\\rr\\) is the function that computes the feature vector\nrepresentation of the input. Formally, \\(\\ff\\) is assumed to be a\ncomposition of the functions \\(\\gg\\) and \\(\\rr\\). That is, for any\ninput \\(x\\), \\(f(x) = \\gg\\left(\\rr\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\). This is\ndenoted by \\(\\ff=\\gg\\circ \\rr\\). For any input, the features are first\ncomputed, and then the function \\(\\gg\\) is applied. If the feature\nrepresentation \\(\\rr\\) is provided by the domain expert, the learning\nproblem becomes simpler to the extent the feature representation takes\non the difficulty of the task. At one extreme, the feature vector\ncould hide an easily extractable form of the answer in the input and\nin the other extreme the feature representation could be just the\nplain input.\n\nFor non-trivial problems, choosing the right representation is vital.\nFor instance, one of the drastic changes in the AI landscape was due\nto Minsky and Papert\u2019s (1969) demonstration that the perceptron\ncannot learn even the binary XOR function, but this function\ncan be learnt by the perceptron if we have the right representation.\nFeature engineering has grown to be one of the most labor intensive\ntasks of machine learning, so much so that it is considered to be one\nof the \u201cblack arts\u201d of machine learning. The other\nsignificant black art of learning methods is choosing the right\nparameters. These black arts require significant human expertise and\nexperience, which can be quite difficult to obtain without significant\napprenticeship (Domingos 2012). Another bigger issue is that the task\nof feature engineering is just knowledge representation in a new skin.\n\n\nGiven this state of affairs, there has been a recent resurgence in\nmethods for automatically learning a feature representation function\n\\(\\rr\\); such methods potentially bypass a large part of human labor\nthat is traditionally required. Such methods are based mostly on what\nare now termed deep neural networks. Such networks are simply\nneural networks with two or more hidden layers. These networks allow\nus to learn a feature function \\(\\rr\\) by using one or more of the\nhidden layers to learn \\(\\rr\\). The general form of learning in which\none learns from the raw sensory data without much hand-based feature\nengineering has now its own term: deep learning. A general and\nyet concise definition (Bengio et al. 2015) is: \n\nDeep learning can safely be regarded as the study of models that\neither involve a greater amount of composition of learned functions or\nlearned concepts than traditional machine learning does. (Bengio et\nal. 2015, Chapter 1)\n\n\nThough the idea has been around for decades, recent innovations\nleading to more efficient learning techniques have made the approach\nmore feasible (Bengio et al. 2013). Deep-learning methods have\nrecently produced state-of-the-art results in image recognition (given\nan image containing various objects, label the objects from a given\nset of labels), speech recognition (from audio input, generate a\ntextual representation), and the analysis of data from particle\naccelerators (LeCun et al. 2015). Despite impressive results in tasks\nsuch as these, minor and major issues remain unresolved. A minor issue\nis that significant human expertise is still needed to choose an\narchitecture and set up the right parameters for the architecture; a\nmajor issue is the existence of so-called adversarial inputs,\nwhich are indistinguishable from normal inputs to humans but are\ncomputed in a special manner that makes a neural network regard them\nas different than similar inputs in the training data. The existence\nof such adversarial inputs, which remain stable across training data,\nhas raised doubts about how well performance on benchmarks can\ntranslate into performance in real-world systems with sensory noise\n(Szegedy et al. 2014).\n4.3 The Resurgence of Probabilistic Techniques\n\nThere is a second dimension to the explosive growth of AI: the\nexplosion in popularity of probabilistic methods that aren\u2019t\nneurocomputational in nature, in order to formalize and mechanize a\nform of non-logicist reasoning in the face of uncertainty.\nInterestingly enough, it is Eugene Charniak himself who can be safely\nconsidered one of the leading proponents of an explicit, premeditated\nturn away from logic to statistical techniques. His area of\nspecialization is natural language processing, and whereas his\nintroductory textbook of 1985 gave an accurate sense of his approach\nto parsing at the time (as we have seen, write computer programs that,\ngiven English text as input, ultimately infer meaning expressed in\nFOL), this approach was abandoned in favor of purely statistical\napproaches (Charniak 1993). At the\n AI@50\n conference, Charniak boldly proclaimed, in a talk tellingly entitled\n\u201cWhy Natural Language Processing is Now Statistical Natural\nLanguage Processing,\u201d that logicist AI is moribund, and that the\nstatistical approach is the only promising game in town \u2013 for\nthe next 50\n years.[34]\n\nThe chief source of energy and debate at the conference flowed from\nthe clash between Charniak\u2019s probabilistic orientation, and the\noriginal logicist orientation, upheld at the conference in question by\nJohn McCarthy and others.\n\nAI\u2019s use of probability theory grows out of the standard form of\nthis theory, which grew directly out of technical philosophy and\nlogic. This form will be familiar to many philosophers, but\nlet\u2019s review it quickly now, in order to set a firm stage for\nmaking points about the new probabilistic techniques that have\nenergized AI. \n\nJust as in the case of FOL, in probability theory we are concerned\nwith declarative statements, or propositions, to which degrees\nof belief are applied; we can thus say that both logicist and\nprobabilistic approaches are symbolic in nature. Both approaches also\nagree that statements can either be true or false in the world. In\nbuilding agents, a simplistic logic-based approach requires agents to\nknow the truth-value of all possible statements. This is not\nrealistic, as an agent may not know the truth-value of some\nproposition \\(p\\) due to either ignorance, non-determinism in the\nphysical world, or just plain vagueness in the meaning of the\nstatement. More specifically, the fundamental proposition in\nprobability theory is a random variable, which can be conceived\nof as an aspect of the world whose status is initially unknown to the\nagent. We usually capitalize the names of random variables, though we\nreserve \\(p,q,r, \\ldots\\) as such names as well. For example, in a\nparticular murder investigation centered on whether or not Mr. Barolo\ncommitted the crime, the random variable \\(Guilty\\) might be of\nconcern. The detective may be interested as well in whether or not the\nmurder weapon \u2013 a particular knife, let us assume \u2013\nbelongs to Barolo. In light of this, we might say that \\(\\Weapon =\n\\true\\) if it does, and \\(\\Weapon = \\false\\) if it doesn\u2019t. As a\nnotational convenience, we can write \\(weapon\\) and \\(\\lnot weapon\\)\nand for these two cases, respectively; and we can use this convention\nfor other variables of this type. \n\nThe kind of variables we have described so far are\n\\(\\mathbf{Boolean}\\), because their \\(\\mathbf{domain}\\) is simply\n\\(\\{true,false\\}.\\) But we can generalize and allow\n\\(\\mathbf{discrete}\\) random variables, whose values are from any\ncountable domain. For example, \\(\\PriceTChina\\) might be a variable\nfor the price of (a particular, presumably) tea in China, and its\ndomain might be \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), where each number here is in US\ndollars. A third type of variable is \\(\\mathbf{continous}\\); its\ndomain is either the reals, or some subset thereof. \n\nWe say that an atomic event is an assignment of particular\nvalues from the appropriate domains to all the variables composing the\n(idealized) world. For example, in the simple murder investigation\nworld introduced just above, we have two Boolean variables,\n\\(\\Guilty\\) and \\(\\Weapon\\), and there are just four atomic events.\nNote that atomic events have some obvious properties. For example,\nthey are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and logically entail the\ntruth or falsity of every proposition. Usually not obvious to\nbeginning students is a fourth property, namely, any proposition is\nlogically equivalent to the disjunction of all atomic events that\nentail that proposition. \n\nPrior probabilities correspond to a degree of belief accorded to a\nproposition in the complete absence of any other information. For\nexample, if the prior probability of Barolo\u2019s guilt is \\(0.2\\),\nwe write \n\n    \\[\n    P\\left(\\Guilty=true\\right)=0.2\n    \\]\n\n \n\nor simply \\(\\P(guilty)=0.2\\). It is often convenient to have a\nnotation allowing one to refer economically to the probabilities of\nall the possible values for a random variable. For example,\nwe can write \n\n    \\[\n    \\P\\left(\\PriceTChina\\right)\n    \\]\n\n \n\nas an abbreviation for the five equations listing all the possible\nprices for tea in China. We can also write \n\n    \\[\n    \\P\\left(\\PriceTChina\\right)=\\langle 1,2,3,4,5\\rangle\n    \\]\n\n \n\nIn addition, as further convenient notation, we can write \\(\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\Guilty, \\Weapon\\right)\\) to denote the probabilities\nof all combinations of values of the relevant set of random variables.\nThis is referred to as the joint probability distribution of\n\\(\\Guilty\\) and \\(\\Weapon\\). The full joint probability\ndistribution covers the distribution for all the random variables used\nto describe a world. Given our simple murder world, we have 20 atomic\nevents summed up in the equation \n\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{P}\\left(\\Guilty, \\Weapon, \\PriceTChina\\right)\n    \\]\n\n \n\nThe final piece of the basic language of probability theory\ncorresponds to conditional probabilities. Where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nare any propositions, the relevant expression is \\(P\\!\\left(p\\given\nq\\right)\\), which can be interpreted as \u201cthe probability of\n\\(p\\), given that all we know is \\(q\\).\u201d For example,\n\n    \\[\n    P\\left(guilty\\ggiven weapon\\right)=0.7\n    \\]\n\n \n\nsays that if the murder weapon belongs to Barolo, and no other\ninformation is available, the probability that Barolo is guilty is\n\\(0.7.\\) \n\nAndrei Kolmogorov showed how to construct probability theory from\nthree axioms that make use of the machinery now introduced, viz., \n\n All probabilities fall between \\(0\\) and \\(1.\\) I.e., \\(\\forall\np. 0 \\leq P(p) \\leq 1\\). \n Valid (in the traditional logicist sense) propositions have a\nprobability of \\(1\\); unsatisfiable (in the traditional logicist\nsense) propositions have a probability of \\(0\\). \n \\(P(p\\lor q) = P(p) +P(q) - P(p\\land q)\\) \n\n\nThese axioms are clearly at bottom logicist. The remainder of\nprobability theory can be erected from this foundation (conditional\nprobabilities are easily defined in terms of prior probabilities). We\ncan thus say that logic is in some fundamental sense still being used\nto characterize the set of beliefs that a rational agent can have. But\nwhere does probabilistic inference enter the picture on this\naccount, since traditional deduction is not used for inference in\nprobability theory?\n\nProbabilistic inference consists in computing, from observed evidence\nexpressed in terms of probability theory, posterior probabilities of\npropositions of interest. For a good long while, there have been\nalgorithms for carrying out such computation. These algorithms precede\nthe resurgence of probabilistic techniques in the 1990s. (Chapter 13\nof AIMA presents a number of them.) For example, given the\nKolmogorov axioms, here is a straightforward way of computing the\nprobability of any proposition, using the full joint distribution\ngiving the probabilities of all atomic events: Where \\(p\\) is some\nproposition, let \\(\\alpha(p)\\) be the disjunction of all atomic events\nin which \\(p\\) holds. Since the probability of a proposition (i.e.,\n\\(P(p)\\)) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the atomic\nevents in which it holds, we have an equation that provides a method\nfor computing the probability of any proposition \\(p\\), viz., \n\n\\[\n P(p) = \\sum_{e_i\\in\\alpha(p)} P(e_i)\n\\]\n\n\nUnfortunately, there were two serious problems infecting this original\nprobabilistic approach: One, the processing in question needed to take\nplace over paralyzingly large amounts of information (enumeration over\nthe entire distribution is required). And two, the expressivity of the\napproach was merely propositional. (It was by the way the philosopher\nHilary Putnam (1963) who pointed out that there was a price to pay in\nmoving to the first-order level. The issue is not discussed herein.)\nEverything changed with the advent of a new formalism that marks the\nmarriage of probabilism and graph theory: Bayesian networks\n(also called belief nets). The pivotal text was (Pearl 1988).\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the\n\nSupplement on Bayesian Networks.\n \n\nBefore concluding this section, it is probably worth noting that, from\nthe standpoint of philosophy, a situation such as the murder\ninvestigation we have exploited above would often be analyzed into\narguments, and strength factors, not into numbers to be\ncrunched by purely arithmetical procedures. For example, in the\nepistemology of Roderick Chisholm, as presented his Theory of\nKnowledge (1966, 1977), Detective Holmes might classify a\nproposition like  Barolo committed the murder. as\ncounterbalanced if he was unable to find a compelling argument\neither way, or perhaps probable if the murder weapon turned out\nto belong to Barolo. Such categories cannot be found on a continuum\nfrom 0 to 1, and they are used in articulating arguments for or\nagainst Barolo\u2019s guilt. Argument-based approaches to uncertain\nand defeasible reasoning are virtually non-existent in AI. One\nexception is Pollock\u2019s approach, covered below. This approach is\nChisholmian in nature. \n\nIt should also be noted that there have been well-established\nformalisms for dealing with probabilistic reasoning as an instance of\nlogic-based reasoning. E.g., the activity a researcher in\nprobabilistic reasoning undertakes when she proves a theorem \\(\\phi\\)\nabout their domain (e.g. any theorem in (Pearl 1988)) is purely within\nthe realm of traditional logic. Readers interested in logic-flavored\napproaches to probabilistic reasoning can consult (Adams 1996,\nHailperin 1996 & 2010, Halpern 1998). Formalisms marrying\nprobability theory, induction and deductive reasoning, placing them on\nan equal footing, have been on the rise, with Markov logic (Richardson\nand Domingos 2006) being salient among these approaches. \n\nProbabilistic Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning, in the sense given\n above,\n has been associated with probabilistic techniques. Probabilistic\ntechniques have been associated with both the learning of functions\n(e.g. Naive Bayes classification) and the modeling of theoretical\nproperties of learning algorithms. For example, a standard\nreformulation of supervised learning casts it as a Bayesian\nproblem. Assume that we are looking at recognizing digits\n\\([0{-}9]\\) from a given image. One way to cast this problem is to ask\nwhat the probability that the hypothesis \\(H_x\\): \u201cthe digit\nis \\(x\\)\u201d is true given the image \\(d\\) from a sensor. Bayes\ntheorem gives us:  \n\n\\[\n P\\left(H_x\\ggiven  d\\right) = \\frac{P\\left(d\\ggiven  H_x\\right)*P\\left(H_x\\right)}{P\\left(d\\right)}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(P(d\\given H_x)\\) and \\(P(H_x)\\) can be estimated from the given\ntraining dataset. Then the hypothesis with the highest posterior\nprobability is then given as the answer and is given by:\n\\(\\argmax_{x}P\\left(d\\ggiven H_x\\right)*P\\left(H_x\\right) \\) In\naddition to probabilistic methods being used to build algorithms,\nprobability theory has also been used to analyze algorithms which\nmight not have an overt probabilistic or logical formulation. For\nexample, one of the central classes of meta-theorems in learning,\nprobably approximately correct (PAC) theorems, are cast in\nterms of lower bounds of the probability that the mismatch between the\ninduced/learnt fL function and the true function\nfT being less than a certain amount, given that the\nlearnt function fL works well for a certain number\nof cases (see Chapter 18, AIMA). \n5. AI in the Wild\n\nFrom at least its modern inception, AI has always been connected to\ngadgets, often ones produced by corporations, and it would be remiss\nof us not to say a few words about this phenomenon. While there have\nbeen a large number of commercial in-the-wild success stories for AI\nand its sister fields, such as optimization and decision-making, some\napplications are more visible and have been thoroughly battle-tested\nin the wild. In 2014, one of the most visible such domains (one in\nwhich AI has been strikingly successful) is information retrieval,\nincarnated as web search. Another recent success story is pattern\nrecognition. The state-of-the-art in applied pattern recognition\n(e.g., fingerprint/face verification, speech recognition, and\nhandwriting recognition) is robust enough to allow\n\u201chigh-stakes\u201d deployment outside the laboratory. As of mid\n2018, several corporations and research laboratories have begun\ntesting autonomous vehicles on public roads, with even a handful of\njurisdictions making self-driving cars legal to operate. For example,\nGoogle\u2019s autonomous cars have navigated hundreds of thousands of\nmiles in California with minimal human help under non-trivial\nconditions (Guizzo 2011). \n\nComputer games provide a robust test bed for AI techniques as they can\ncapture important parts that might be necessary to test an AI\ntechnique while abstracting or removing details that might beyond the\nscope of core AI research, for example, designing better hardware or\ndealing with legal issues (Laird and VanLent 2001). One subclass of\ngames that has seen quite fruitful for commercial deployment of AI is\nreal-time strategy games. Real-time strategy games are games in which\nplayers manage an army given limited resources. One objective is to\nconstantly battle other players and reduce an opponent\u2019s forces.\nReal-time strategy games differ from strategy games in that players\nplan their actions simultaneously in real-time and do not have to take\nturns playing. Such games have a number of challenges that are\ntantalizing within the grasp of the state-of-the-art. This makes such\ngames an attractive venue in which to deploy simple AI agents. An\noverview of AI used in real-time strategy games can be found in\n(Robertson and Watson 2015). \n\nSome other ventures in AI, despite significant success, have been only\nchugging slowly and humbly along, quietly. For instance, AI-related\nmethods have achieved triumphs in solving open problems in mathematics\nthat have resisted any solution for decades. The most noteworthy\ninstance of such a problem is perhaps a proof of the statement that\n\u201cAll Robbins algebras are Boolean algebras.\u201d This\nwas conjectured in the 1930s, and the proof was finally discovered by\nthe Otter automatic theorem-prover in 1996 after just a few months of\neffort (Kolata 1996, Wos 2013). Sister fields like formal verification\nhave also bloomed to the extent that it is now not too difficult to\nsemi-automatically verify vital hardware/software components (Kaufmann\net al. 2000 and Chajed et al. 2017).\n\nOther related areas, such as (natural) language translation, still\nhave a long way to go, but are good enough to let us use them under\nrestricted conditions. The jury is out on tasks such as machine\ntranslation, which seems to require both statistical methods (Lopez\n2008) and symbolic methods (Espa\u00f1a-Bonet 2011). Both\nmethods now have comparable but limited success in the wild. A\ndeployed translation system at Ford that was initially developed for\ntranslating manufacturing process instructions from English to other\nlanguages initially started out as rule-based system with Ford and\ndomain-specific vocabulary and language. This system then evolved to\nincorporate statistical techniques along with rule-based techniques as\nit gained new uses beyond translating manuals, for example, lay users\nwithin Ford translating their own documents (Rychtyckyj and Plesco\n2012). \n\nAI\u2019s great achievements mentioned above so far have all been in\nlimited, narrow domains. This lack of any success in the unrestricted\ngeneral case has caused a small set of researchers to break away into\nwhat is now called\n  artificial general intelligence\n (Goertzel and Pennachin 2007). The stated goals of this movement\ninclude shifting the focus again to building artifacts that are\ngenerally intelligent and not just capable in one narrow domain. \n6. Moral AI\n\nComputer Ethics has been around for a long time. In this\nsub-field, typically one would consider how one ought to act in a\ncertain class of situations involving computer technology, where the\n\u201cone\u201d here refers to a human being (Moor 1985). So-called\n\u201crobot ethics\u201d is different. In this sub-field (which goes\nby names such as \u201cmoral AI,\u201d \u201cethical AI,\u201d\n\u201cmachine ethics,\u201d \u201cmoral robots,\u201d etc.) one is\nconfronted with such prospects as robots being able to make autonomous\nand weighty decisions \u2013 decisions that might or might not be\nmorally permissible (Wallach & Allen 2010). If one were to attempt\nto engineer a robot with a capacity for sophisticated ethical\nreasoning and decision-making, one would also be doing Philosophical\nAI, as that concept is characterized\n elsewhere\n in the present entry. There can be many different flavors of\napproaches toward Moral AI. Wallach and Allen (2010) provide a\nhigh-level overview of the different approaches. Moral reasoning is\nobviously needed in robots that have the capability for lethal action.\nArkin (2009) provides an introduction to how we can control and\nregulate machines that have the capacity for lethal behavior. Moral AI\ngoes beyond obviously lethal situations, and we can have a spectrum of\nmoral machines. Moor (2006) provides one such spectrum of possible\nmoral agents. An example of a non-lethal but ethically-charged machine\nwould be a lying machine. Clark (2010) uses a computational theory\nof the mind, the ability to represent and reason about other\nagents, to build a lying machine that successfully persuades people\ninto believing falsehoods. Bello & Bringsjord (2013) give a\ngeneral overview of what might be required to build a moral machine,\none of the ingredients being a theory of mind. \n\nThe most general framework for building machines that can reason\nethically consists in endowing the machines with a moral code.\nThis requires that the formal framework used for reasoning by the\nmachine be expressive enough to receive such codes. The field of Moral\nAI, for now, is not concerned with the source or provenance of such\ncodes. The source could be humans, and the machine could receive the\ncode directly (via explicit encoding) or indirectly (reading). Another\npossibility is that the code is inferred by the machine from a more\nbasic set of laws. We assume that the robot has access to some such\ncode, and we then try to engineer the robot to follow that code under\nall circumstances while making sure that the moral code and its\nrepresentation do not lead to unintended consequences. Deontic\nlogics are a class of formal logics that have been studied the\nmost for this purpose. Abstractly, such logics are concerned mainly\nwith what follows from a given moral code. Engineering then studies\nthe match of a given deontic logic to a moral code (i.e., is the logic\nexpressive enough) which has to be balanced with the ease of\nautomation. Bringsjord et al. (2006) provide a blueprint for using\ndeontic logics to build systems that can perform actions in accordance\nwith a moral code. The role deontic logics play in the framework\noffered by Bringsjord et al (which can be considered to be\nrepresentative of the field of deontic logic for moral AI) can be best\nunderstood as striving towards Leibniz\u2019s dream of a universal\nmoral calculus: \n\nWhen controversies arise, there will be no more need for a disputation\nbetween two philosophers than there would be between two accountants\n[computistas]. It would be enough for them to pick up their pens and\nsit at their abacuses, and say to each other (perhaps having summoned\na mutual friend): \u2018Let us calculate.\u2019\n\n\nDeontic logic-based frameworks can also be used in a fashion that is\nanalogous to moral self-reflection. In this mode, logic-based\nverification of the robot\u2019s internal modules can done before the\nrobot ventures out into the real world. Govindarajulu and Bringsjord\n(2015) present an approach, drawing from formal-program\nverification, in which a deontic-logic based system could be used\nto verify that a robot acts in a certain ethically-sanctioned manner\nunder certain conditions. Since formal-verification approaches can be\nused to assert statements about an infinite number of situations and\nconditions, such approaches might be preferred to having the robot\nroam around in an ethically-charged test environment and make a finite\nset of decisions that are then judged for their ethical correctness.\nMore recently, Govindarajulu and Bringsjord (2017) use a deontic logic\nto present a computational model of the\n Doctrine of Double Effect,\n an ethical principle for moral dilemmas that has been studied\nempirically and analyzed extensively by\n philosophers.[35]\n The principle is usually presented and motivated via dilemmas using\ntrolleys and was first presented in this fashion by Foot (1967). \n\nWhile there has been substantial theoretical and philosophical work,\nthe field of machine ethics is still in its infancy. There has been\nsome embryonic work in building ethical machines. One recent such\nexample would be Pereira and Saptawijaya (2016) who use logic\nprogramming and base their work in machine ethics on the ethical\ntheory known as contractualism, set out by Scanlon (1982). And\nwhat about the future? Since artificial agents are bound to get\nsmarter and smarter, and to have more and more autonomy and\nresponsibility, robot ethics is almost certainly going to grow in\nimportance. This endeavor might not be a straightforward application\nof classical ethics. For example, experimental results suggest that\nhumans hold robots to different ethical standards than they expect\nfrom humans under similar conditions (Malle et al.\n 2015).[36]\n\n7. Philosophical AI\n\nNotice that the heading for this section isn\u2019t Philosophy\nof AI. We\u2019ll get to that category momentarily. (For now\nit can be identified with the attempt to answer such questions as\nwhether artificial agents created in AI can ever reach the full\nheights of human intelligence.) Philosophical AI is AI, not\nphilosophy; but it\u2019s AI rooted in and flowing from, philosophy.\nFor example, one could engage, using the tools and techniques of\nphilosophy, a paradox, work out a proposed solution, and then proceed\nto a step that is surely optional for philosophers: expressing the\nsolution in terms that can be translated into a computer program that,\nwhen executed, allows an artificial agent to surmount concrete\ninstances of the original\n paradox.[37]\n Before we ostensively characterize Philosophical AI of this sort\ncourtesy of a particular research program, let us consider first the\nview that AI is in fact simply philosophy, or a part thereof. \n\nDaniel Dennett (1979) has famously claimed not just that there are\nparts of AI intimately bound up with philosophy, but that AI\nis philosophy (and psychology, at least of the cognitive\nsort). (He has made a parallel claim about Artificial Life (Dennett\n1998)). This view will turn out to be incorrect, but the reasons why\nit\u2019s wrong will prove illuminating, and our discussion will pave\nthe way for a discussion of Philosophical AI. \n\nWhat does Dennett say, exactly? This: \n\nI want to claim that AI is better viewed as sharing with traditional\nepistemology the status of being a most general, most abstract asking\nof the top-down question: how is knowledge possible? (Dennett 1979,\n60)\n\n\nElsewhere he says his view is that AI should be viewed \u201cas a\nmost abstract inquiry into the possibility of intelligence or\nknowledge\u201d (Dennett 1979, 64). \n\nIn short, Dennett holds that AI is the attempt to explain\nintelligence, not by studying the brain in the hopes of identifying\ncomponents to which cognition can be reduced, and not by engineering\nsmall information-processing units from which one can build in\nbottom-up fashion to high-level cognitive processes, but rather by\n\u2013 and this is why he says the approach is top-down\n\u2013 designing and implementing abstract algorithms that capture\ncognition. Leaving aside the fact that, at least starting in the early\n1980s, AI includes an approach that is in some sense bottom-up (see\nthe neurocomputational paradigm discussed above, in\n Non-Logicist AI: A Summary;\n and see, specifically, Granger\u2019s (2004a, 2004b) work,\nhyperlinked in text immediately above, a specific counterexample), a\nfatal flaw infects Dennett\u2019s view. Dennett sees the potential\nflaw, as reflected in: \n\nIt has seemed to some philosophers that AI cannot plausibly be so\nconstrued because it takes on an additional burden: it restricts\nitself to mechanistic solutions, and hence its domain is not\nthe Kantian domain of all possible modes of intelligence, but just all\npossible mechanistically realizable modes of intelligence. This, it is\nclaimed, would beg the question against vitalists, dualists, and other\nanti-mechanists. (Dennett 1979, 61)\n\n\nDennett has a ready answer to this objection. He writes: \n\nBut \u2026 the mechanism requirement of AI is not an additional\nconstraint of any moment, for if psychology is possible at all, and if\nChurch\u2019s thesis is true, the constraint of mechanism is no more\nsevere than the constraint against begging the question in psychology,\nand who would wish to evade that? (Dennett 1979, 61)\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is acutely problematic; and examination of the\nproblems throws light on the nature of AI. \n\nFirst, insofar as philosophy and psychology are concerned with the\nnature of mind, they aren\u2019t in the least trammeled by the\npresupposition that mentation consists in computation. AI, at least of\nthe \u201cStrong\u201d variety (we\u2019ll discuss\n\u201cStrong\u201d versus \u201cWeak\u201d AI\n below)\n is indeed an attempt to substantiate, through engineering certain\nimpressive artifacts, the thesis that intelligence is at bottom\ncomputational (at the level of Turing machines and their equivalents,\ne.g., Register machines). So there is a philosophical claim, for sure.\nBut this doesn\u2019t make AI philosophy, any more than some of the\ndeeper, more aggressive claims of some physicists (e.g., that the\n universe is ultimately digital in nature)\n make their field philosophy. Philosophy of physics certainly\nentertains the proposition that the physical universe can be\nperfectly modeled in digital terms (in a series of cellular automata,\ne.g.), but of course philosophy of physics can\u2019t be\nidentified with this doctrine. \n\nSecond, we now know well (and those familiar with the relevant formal\nterrain knew at the time of Dennett\u2019s writing) that information\nprocessing can exceed standard computation, that is, can exceed\ncomputation at and below the level of what a Turing machine can muster\n(Turing-computation, we shall say). (Such information\nprocessing is known as hypercomputation, a term coined by\nphilosopher Jack Copeland, who has himself defined such machines\n(e.g., Copeland 1998). The first machines capable of hypercomputation\nwere trial-and-error machines, introduced in the same famous\nissue of the Journal of Symbolic Logic (Gold 1965; Putnam\n1965). A new hypercomputer is the infinite time Turing machine\n(Hamkins & Lewis 2000).) Dennett\u2019s appeal to Church\u2019s\nthesis thus flies in the face of the mathematical facts: some\nvarieties of information processing exceed standard computation (or\nTuring-computation). Church\u2019s thesis, or more precisely, the\nChurch-Turing thesis, is the view that a function \\(f\\) is effectively\ncomputable if and only if \\(f\\) is Turing-computable (i.e., some\nTuring machine can compute \\(f\\)). Thus, this thesis has nothing to\nsay about information processing that is more demanding than what a\nTuring machine can achieve. (Put another way, there is no\ncounter-example to CTT to be automatically found in an\ninformation-processing device capable of feats beyond the reach of\nTMs.) For all philosophy and psychology know, intelligence, even if\ntied to information processing, exceeds what is Turing-computational\nor\n Turing-mechanical.[38]\n This is especially true because philosophy and psychology, unlike AI,\nare in no way fundamentally charged with engineering artifacts, which\nmakes the physical realizability of hypercomputation irrelevant from\ntheir perspectives. Therefore, contra Dennett, to consider AI\nas psychology or philosophy is to commit a serious error, precisely\nbecause so doing would box these fields into only a speck of the\nentire space of functions from the natural numbers (including tuples\ntherefrom) to the natural numbers. (Only a tiny portion of the\nfunctions in this space are Turing-computable.) AI is without question\nmuch, much narrower than this pair of fields. Of course, it\u2019s\npossible that AI could be replaced by a field devoted not to building\ncomputational artifacts by writing computer programs and running them\non embodied Turing machines. But this new field, by definition, would\nnot be AI. Our exploration of AIMA and other textbooks provide\ndirect empirical confirmation of this. \n\nThird, most AI researchers and developers, in point of fact, are\nsimply concerned with building useful, profitable artifacts, and\ndon\u2019t spend much time reflecting upon the kinds of abstract\ndefinitions of intelligence explored in this entry (e.g.,\n What Exactly is AI?).\n \n\nThough AI isn\u2019t philosophy, there are certainly ways of doing\nreal implementation-focussed AI of the highest caliber that are\nintimately bound up with philosophy. The best way to demonstrate this\nis to simply present such research and development, or at least a\nrepresentative example thereof. While there have been many examples of\nsuch work, the most prominent example in AI is John Pollock\u2019s\nOSCAR project, which stretched over a considerable portion of his\nlifetime. For a detailed presentation and further discussion, see\nthe\n\nSupplement on the OSCAR Project.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note at this juncture that the OSCAR project,\nand the information processing that underlies it, are without question\nat once philosophy and technical AI. Given that the work in\nquestion has appeared in the pages of Artificial Intelligence,\na first-rank journal devoted to that field, and not to philosophy,\nthis is undeniable (see, e.g., Pollock 2001, 1992). This point is\nimportant because while it\u2019s certainly appropriate, in the\npresent venue, to emphasize connections between AI and philosophy,\nsome readers may suspect that this emphasis is contrived: they may\nsuspect that the truth of the matter is that page after page of AI\njournals are filled with narrow, technical content far from\nphilosophy. Many such papers do exist. But we must distinguish between\nwritings designed to present the nature of AI, and its core methods\nand goals, versus writings designed to present progress on specific\ntechnical issues. \n\nWritings in the latter category are more often than not quite narrow,\nbut, as the example of Pollock shows, sometimes these specific issues\nare inextricably linked to philosophy. And of course Pollock\u2019s\nwork is a representative example (albeit the most substantive one).\nOne could just as easily have selected work by folks who don\u2019t\nhappen to also produce straight philosophy. For example, for an entire\nbook written within the confines of AI and computer science, but which\nis epistemic logic in action in many ways, suitable for use in\nseminars on that topic, see (Fagin et al. 2004). (It is hard to find\ntechnical work that isn\u2019t bound up with philosophy in some\ndirect way. E.g., AI research on learning is all intimately bound up\nwith philosophical treatments of induction, of how genuinely new\nconcepts not simply defined in terms of prior ones can be learned. One\npossible partial answer offered by AI is inductive logic\nprogramming, discussed in Chapter 19 of AIMA.) \n\nWhat of writings in the former category? Writings in this category,\nwhile by definition in AI venues, not philosophy ones, are nonetheless\nphilosophical. Most textbooks include plenty of material that falls\ninto this latter category, and hence they include discussion of the\nphilosophical nature of AI (e.g., that AI is aimed at building\nartificial intelligences, and that\u2019s why, after all, it\u2019s\ncalled \u2018AI\u2019). \n8. Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence\n8.1 \u201cStrong\u201d versus \u201cWeak\u201d AI\n\nRecall that we earlier discussed proposed definitions of AI, and\nrecall specifically that these proposals were couched in terms of the\ngoals of the field. We can follow this pattern here: We can\ndistinguish between \u201cStrong\u201d and \u201cWeak\u201d AI by\ntaking note of the different goals that these two versions of AI\nstrive to reach. \u201cStrong\u201d AI seeks to create artificial\npersons: machines that have all the mental powers we have, including\nphenomenal consciousness. \u201cWeak\u201d AI, on the other hand,\nseeks to build information-processing machines that appear to\nhave the full mental repertoire of human persons (Searle 1997).\n\u201cWeak\u201d AI can also be defined as the form of AI that aims\nat a system able to pass not just the Turing Test (again, abbreviated\nas TT), but the Total Turing Test (Harnad 1991). In TTT, a\nmachine must muster more than linguistic indistinguishability: it must\npass for a human in all behaviors \u2013 throwing a baseball, eating,\nteaching a class, etc. \n\nIt would certainly seem to be exceedingly difficult for philosophers\nto overthrow \u201cWeak\u201d AI (Bringsjord and Xiao 2000). After\nall, what philosophical reason stands in the way of AI\nproducing artifacts that appear to be animals or even humans?\nHowever, some philosophers have aimed to do in \u201cStrong\u201d\nAI, and we turn now to the most prominent case in point. \n8.2 The Chinese Room Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n\nWithout question, the most famous argument in the philosophy of AI is\nJohn Searle\u2019s (1980) Chinese Room Argument (CRA), designed to\noverthrow \u201cStrong\u201d AI. We present a quick summary here and\na \u201creport from the trenches\u201d as to how AI practitioners\nregard the argument. Readers wanting to further study CRA will find an\nexcellent next step in the entry on\n the Chinese Room Argument\n and (Bishop & Preston 2002). \n\nCRA is based on a thought-experiment in which Searle himself stars. He\nis inside a room; outside the room are native Chinese speakers who\ndon\u2019t know that Searle is inside it. Searle-in-the-box, like\nSearle-in-real-life, doesn\u2019t know any Chinese, but is fluent in\nEnglish. The Chinese speakers send cards into the room through a slot;\non these cards are written questions in Chinese. The box, courtesy of\nSearle\u2019s secret work therein, returns cards to the native\nChinese speakers as output. Searle\u2019s output is produced by\nconsulting a rulebook: this book is a lookup table that tells him what\nChinese to produce based on what is sent in. To Searle, the Chinese is\nall just a bunch of \u2013 to use Searle\u2019s language \u2013\nsquiggle-squoggles. The following schematic picture sums up the\nsituation. The labels should be obvious. \\(O\\) denotes the outside\nobservers, in this case the Chinese speakers. Input is denoted by\n\\(i\\) and output by \\(o\\). As you can see, there is an icon for the\nrulebook, and Searle himself is denoted by \\(P\\).\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Room, Schematic View\n\n\nNow, what is the argument based on this thought-experiment? Even if\nyou\u2019ve never heard of CRA before, you doubtless can see the\nbasic idea: that Searle (in the box) is supposed to be everything a\ncomputer can be, and because he doesn\u2019t understand Chinese, no\ncomputer could have such understanding. Searle is mindlessly moving\nsquiggle-squoggles around, and (according to the argument)\nthat\u2019s all computers do,\n fundamentally.[39]\n\nWhere does CRA stand today? As we\u2019ve already indicated, the\nargument would still seem to be alive and well; witness (Bishop &\nPreston 2002). However, there is little doubt that at least among AI\npractitioners, CRA is generally rejected. (This is of course\nthoroughly unsurprising.) Among these practitioners, the philosopher\nwho has offered the most formidable response out of AI itself is\nRapaport (1988), who argues that while AI systems are indeed\nsyntactic, the right syntax can constitute semantics. It should be\nsaid that a common attitude among proponents of \u201cStrong\u201d\nAI is that CRA is not only unsound, but silly, based as it is on a\nfanciful story (CR) far removed from the practice of AI\n\u2013 practice which is year by year moving ineluctably toward\nsophisticated robots that will once and for all silence CRA and its\nproponents. For example, John Pollock (as we\u2019ve noted,\nphilosopher and practitioner of AI) writes: \n\nOnce [my intelligent system] OSCAR is fully functional, the argument\nfrom analogy will lead us inexorably to attribute thoughts and\nfeelings to OSCAR with precisely the same credentials with which we\nattribute them to human beings. Philosophical arguments to the\ncontrary will be pass\u00e9. (Pollock 1995, p. 6)\n\n\nTo wrap up discussion of CRA, we make two quick points, to wit: \n\n Despite the confidence of the likes of Pollock about the eventual\nirrelevance of CRA in the face of the eventual human-level prowess of\nOSCAR (and, by extension, any number of other still-improving AI\nsystems), the brute fact is that deeply semantic natural-language\nprocessing (NLP) is rarely even pursued these days, so proponents of\nCRA are certainly not the ones feeling some discomfort in light of the\ncurrent state of AI. In short, Searle would rightly point to any of\nthe success stories of AI, including the Watson system we have\ndiscussed, and still proclaim that understanding is nowhere to be\nfound \u2013 and he would be well within his philosophical rights in\nsaying this. \n It would appear that the CRA is bubbling back to a level of\nengagement not seen for a number of years, in light of the empirical\nfact that certain thinkers are now issuing explicit warnings to the\neffect that future conscious, malevolent machines may well wish to do\nin our species. In reply, Searle (2014) points out that since CRA is\nsound, there can\u2019t be conscious machines; and if there\ncan\u2019t be conscious machines, there can\u2019t be malevolent\nmachines that wish anything. We return to this at the end of our\nentry; the chief point here is that CRA continues to be quite\nrelevant, and indeed we suspect that Searle\u2019s basis for\nhave-no-fear will be taken up energetically by not only philosophers,\nbut AI experts, futurists, lawyers, and policy-makers. \n\n\nReaders may wonder if there are philosophical debates that AI\nresearchers engage in, in the course of working in their field (as\nopposed to when they might attend a philosophy conference). Surely, AI\nresearchers have philosophical discussions amongst themselves, right?\n\n\nGenerally, one finds that AI researchers do discuss among themselves\ntopics in philosophy of AI, and these topics are usually the very same\nones that occupy philosophers of AI. However, the attitude reflected\nin the quote from Pollock immediately above is by far the dominant\none. That is, in general, the attitude of AI researchers is that\nphilosophizing is sometimes fun, but the upward march of AI\nengineering cannot be stopped, will not fail, and will eventually\nrender such philosophizing otiose. \n\nWe will return to the issue of the future of AI in the\n final section\n of this entry. \n8.3 The G\u00f6delian Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n\nFour decades ago, J.R. Lucas (1964) argued that G\u00f6del\u2019s\nfirst incompleteness theorem entails that no machine can ever reach\nhuman-level intelligence. His argument has not proved to be\ncompelling, but Lucas initiated a debate that has produced more\nformidable arguments. One of Lucas\u2019 indefatigable defenders is\nthe physicist Roger Penrose, whose first attempt to vindicate Lucas\nwas a G\u00f6delian attack on \u201cStrong\u201d AI articulated in\nhis The Emperor\u2019s New Mind (1989). This first attempt\nfell short, and Penrose published a more elaborate and more fastidious\nG\u00f6delian case, expressed in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Shadows of\nthe Mind (1994). \n\nIn light of the fact that readers can turn to the\n entry on the G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems,\n a full review here is not needed. Instead, readers will be given a\ndecent sense of the argument by turning to an online paper in which\nPenrose, writing in response to critics (e.g., the philosopher David\nChalmers, the logician Solomon Feferman, and the computer scientist\nDrew McDermott) of his Shadows of the Mind, distills the\nargument to a couple of\n paragraphs.[40]\n Indeed, in this paper Penrose gives what he takes to be the perfected\nversion of the core G\u00f6delian case given in SOTM. Here is\nthis version, verbatim: \n\nWe try to suppose that the totality of methods of (unassailable)\nmathematical reasoning that are in principle humanly accessible can be\nencapsulated in some (not necessarily computational) sound formal\nsystem \\(F\\). A human mathematician, if presented with \\(F\\), could\nargue as follows (bearing in mind that the phrase \u201cI am\n\\(F\\)\u201d is merely a shorthand for \u201c\\(F\\) encapsulates all\nthe humanly accessible methods of mathematical proof\u201d):\n\n\n(A) \u201cThough I don\u2019t know that I necessarily am \\(F\\), I\nconclude that if I were, then the system \\(F\\) would have to be sound\nand, more to the point, \\(F'\\) would have to be sound, where \\(F'\\) is\n\\(F\\) supplemented by the further assertion \u201cI am \\(F\\).\u201d\nI perceive that it follows from the assumption that I am \\(F\\) that\nthe G\u00f6del statement \\(G(F')\\) would have to be true and,\nfurthermore, that it would not be a consequence of \\(F'\\). But I have\njust perceived that \u201cIf I happened to be \\(F\\), then \\(G(F')\\)\nwould have to be true,\u201d and perceptions of this nature would be\nprecisely what \\(F'\\) is supposed to achieve. Since I am therefore\ncapable of perceiving something beyond the powers of \\(F'\\), I deduce\nthat I cannot be \\(F\\) after all. Moreover, this applies to any other\n(G\u00f6delizable) system, in place of \\(F\\).\u201d (Penrose 1996,\n3.2)\n\n\n\nDoes this argument succeed? A firm answer to this question is not\nappropriate to seek in the present entry. Interested readers are\nencouraged to consult four full-scale treatments of the argument\n(LaForte et. al 1998; Bringsjord and Xiao 2000; Shapiro 2003; Bowie\n1982).\n8.4 Additional Topics and Readings in Philosophy of AI\n\nIn addition to the G\u00f6delian and Searlean arguments covered\nbriefly above, a third attack on \u201cStrong\u201d AI (of the\nsymbolic variety) has been widely discussed (though with the rise of\nstatistical machine learning has come a corresponding decrease in the\nattention paid to it), namely, one given by the philosopher Hubert\nDreyfus (1972, 1992), some incarnations of which have been\nco-articulated with his brother, Stuart Dreyfus (1987), a computer\nscientist. Put crudely, the core idea in this attack is that human\nexpertise is not based on the explicit, disembodied, mechanical\nmanipulation of symbolic information (such as formulae in some logic,\nor probabilities in some Bayesian network), and that AI\u2019s\nefforts to build machines with such expertise are doomed if based on\nthe symbolic paradigm. The genesis of the Dreyfusian attack was a\nbelief that the critique of (if you will) symbol-based philosophy\n(e.g., philosophy in the logic-based, rationalist tradition, as\nopposed to what is called the Continental tradition) from such\nthinkers as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty could be made against the\nrationalist tradition in AI. After further reading and study of\nDreyfus\u2019 writings, readers may judge whether this critique is\ncompelling, in an information-driven world increasingly managed by\nintelligent agents that carry out symbolic reasoning (albeit not even\nclose to the human level). \n\nFor readers interested in exploring philosophy of AI beyond what Jim\nMoor (in a recent address \u2013 \u201cThe Next Fifty Years of AI:\nFuture Scientific Research vs. Past Philosophical Criticisms\u201d\n\u2013 as the 2006 Barwise Award winner at the annual eastern\nAmerican Philosophical Association meeting) has called the \u201cthe\nbig three\u201d criticisms of AI, there is no shortage of additional\nmaterial, much of it available on the Web. The last chapter of\nAIMA provides a compressed overview of some additional\narguments against \u201cStrong\u201d AI, and is in general not a bad\nnext step. Needless to say, Philosophy of AI today involves much more\nthan the three well-known arguments discussed above, and, inevitably,\nPhilosophy of AI tomorrow will include new debates and problems we\ncan\u2019t see now. Because machines, inevitably, will get smarter\nand smarter (regardless of just how smart they get),\nPhilosophy of AI, pure and simple, is a growth industry. With every\nhuman activity that machines match, the \u201cbig\u201d questions\nwill only attract more attention. \n9. The Future\n\nIf past predictions are any indication, the only thing we know today\nabout tomorrow\u2019s science and technology is that it will be\nradically different than whatever we predict it will be like.\nArguably, in the case of AI, we may also specifically know today that\nprogress will be much slower than what most expect. After all, at the\n1956 kickoff conference (discussed at the start of this entry), Herb\nSimon predicted that thinking machines able to match the human mind\nwere \u201cjust around the corner\u201d (for the relevant quotes and\ninformative discussion, see the first chapter of AIMA). As it\nturned out, the new century would arrive without a single machine able\nto converse at even the toddler level. (Recall that when it comes to\nthe building of machines capable of displaying human-level\nintelligence, Descartes, not Turing, seems today to be the better\nprophet.) Nonetheless, astonishing though it may be, serious thinkers\nin the late 20th century have continued to issue incredibly optimistic\npredictions regarding the progress of AI. For example, Hans Moravec\n(1999), in his Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind,\ninforms us that because the speed of computer hardware doubles every\n18 months (in accordance with Moore\u2019s Law, which has\napparently held in the past), \u201cfourth generation\u201d\nrobots will soon enough exceed humans in all respects, from running\ncompanies to writing novels. These robots, so the story goes, will\nevolve to such lofty cognitive heights that we will stand to them as\nsingle-cell organisms stand to us\n today.[41]\n\n\nMoravec is by no means singularly Pollyannaish: Many others in AI\npredict the same sensational future unfolding on about the same rapid\nschedule. In fact, at the aforementioned AI@50 conference, Jim Moor\nposed the question \u201cWill human-level AI be achieved within the\nnext 50 years?\u201d to five thinkers who attended the original 1956\nconference: John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge, Ray\nSolomonoff, and Trenchard Moore. McCarthy and Minsky gave firm,\nunhesitating affirmatives, and Solomonoff seemed to suggest that AI\nprovided the one ray of hope in the face of fact that our species\nseems bent on destroying itself. (Selfridge\u2019s reply was a bit\ncryptic. Moore returned a firm, unambiguous negative, and declared\nthat once his computer is smart enough to interact with him\nconversationally about mathematical problems, he might take this whole\nenterprise more seriously.) It is left to the reader to judge the\naccuracy of such risky predictions as have been given by Moravec,\nMcCarthy, and\n Minsky.[42]\n\n\nThe judgment of the reader in this regard ought to factor in the\nstunning resurgence, very recently, of serious reflection on what is\nknown as \u201cThe Singularity,\u201d (denoted by us simply as\nS) the future point at which artificial intelligence exceeds\nhuman intelligence, whereupon immediately thereafter (as the story\ngoes) the machines make themselves rapidly smarter and smarter and\nsmarter, reaching a superhuman level of intelligence that, stuck as we\nare in the mud of our limited mentation, we can\u2019t fathom. For\nextensive, balanced analysis of S, see Eden et al. (2013).\n\nReaders unfamiliar with the literature on S may be quite\nsurprised to learn the degree to which, among learned folks, this\nhypothetical event is not only taken seriously, but has in fact become\na target for extensive and frequent philosophizing [for a mordant tour\nof the recent thought in question, see Floridi (2015)]. What\narguments support the belief that S is in our future?\nThere are two main arguments at this point: the familiar\nhardware-based one [championed by Moravec, as noted above, and again\nmore recently by Kurzweil (2006)]; and the \u2013 as far as we know\n\u2013 original argument given by mathematician I. J. Good (1965). In\naddition, there is a recent and related doomsayer argument advanced by\nBostrom (2014), which seems to presuppose that S will occur.\nGood\u2019s argument, nicely amplified and adjusted by Chalmers\n(2010), who affirms the tidied-up version of the argument, runs as\nfollows:\n\nPremise 1: There will be AI (created by HI and such that AI\n= HI). \nPremise 2: If there is AI, there will be AI\\(^+\\) (created\nby AI). \nPremise 3: If there is AI\\(^+\\), there will be AI\\(^{++}\\)\n(created by AI\\(^+\\)). \nConclusion: There will be AI\\(^{++}\\) (= S will\noccur). \n\n\nIn this argument, \u2018AI\u2019 is artificial intelligence at the\nlevel of, and created by, human persons, \u2018AI\\(^+\\)\u2019\nartificial intelligence above the level of human persons, and\n\u2018AI\\(^{++}\\)\u2019 super-intelligence constitutive of S.\nThe key process is presumably the creation of one class of\nmachine by another. We have added for convenience \u2018HI\u2019 for\nhuman intelligence; the central idea is then: HI will create AI, the\nlatter at the same level of intelligence as the former; AI will create\nAI\\(^+\\); AI\\(^+\\) will create AI\\(^{++}\\); with the ascension\nproceeding perhaps forever, but at any rate proceeding long enough for\nus to be as ants outstripped by gods. \n\nThe argument certainly appears to be formally valid. Are its three\npremises true? Taking up such a question would fling us far beyond the\nscope of this entry. We point out only that the concept of one class\nof machines creating another, more powerful class of machines is not a\ntransparent one, and neither Good nor Chalmers provides a rigorous\naccount of the concept, which is ripe for philosophical analysis. (As\nto mathematical analysis, some exists, of course. It is for example\nwell-known that a computing machine at level \\(L\\) cannot possibly\ncreate another machine at a higher level \\(L'\\). For instance, a\nlinear-bounded automaton can\u2019t create a Turing machine.)\n\nThe Good-Chalmers argument has a rather clinical air about it; the\nargument doesn\u2019t say anything regarding whether machines in\nthe AI\\(^{++}\\) category will be benign, malicious, or munificent.\nMany others gladly fill this gap with dark, dark pessimism. The\nlocus classicus here is without question a widely read paper by\nBill Joy (2000): \u201cWhy The Future Doesn\u2019t Need Us.\u201d\nJoy believes that the human race is doomed, in no small part because\nit\u2019s busy building smart machines. He writes: \n\n\nThe 21st-century technologies \u2013 genetics, nanotechnology, and\nrobotics (GNR) \u2013 are so powerful that they can spawn whole new\nclasses of accidents and abuses. Most dangerously, for the first time,\nthese accidents and abuses are widely within the reach of individuals\nor small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw\nmaterials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.\n\nThus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction\nbut of knowledge-enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness\nhugely amplified by the power of self-replication. \n\nI think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further\nperfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well\nbeyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the\nnation-states, on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme\n individuals.[43]\n\n\n\nPhilosophers would be most interested in arguments for this\nview. What are Joy\u2019s? Well, no small reason for the attention\nlavished on his paper is that, like Raymond Kurzweil (2000), Joy\nrelies heavily on an argument given by none other than the Unabomber\n(Theodore Kaczynski). The idea is that, assuming we succeed in\nbuilding intelligent machines, we will have them do most (if not all)\nwork for us. If we further allow the machines to make decisions for us\n\u2013 even if we retain oversight over the machines \u2013, we will\neventually depend on them to the point where we must simply accept\ntheir decisions. But even if we don\u2019t allow the machines to make\ndecisions, the control of such machines is likely to be held by a\nsmall elite who will view the rest of humanity as unnecessary \u2013\nsince the machines can do any needed work (Joy 2000).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to assess this argument. (Having said that,\nthe pattern pushed by the Unabomber and his supporters certainly\nappears to be flatly\n invalid.[44])\n In fact, many readers will doubtless feel that no such place exists\nor will exist, because the reasoning here is amateurish. So then, what\nabout the reasoning of professional philosophers on the matter? \n\nBostrom has recently painted an exceedingly dark picture of a possible\nfuture. He points out that the \u201cfirst superintelligence\u201d\ncould have the capability\n\nto shape the future of Earth-originating life, could easily have\nnon-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental\nreasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition. If we now reflect\nthat human beings consist of useful resources (such as conveniently\nlocated atoms) and that we depend on many more local resources, we can\nsee that the outcome could easily be one in which humanity quickly\nbecomes extinct. (Bostrom 2014, p. 416)\n\n\n Clearly, the most vulnerable premise in this sort of argument\nis that the \u201cfirst superintelligence\u201d will arrive indeed\narrive. Here perhaps the Good-Chalmers argument provides a basis.\n\n\nSearle (2014) thinks Bostrom\u2019s book is misguided and\nfundamentally mistaken, and that we needn\u2019t worry. His rationale\nis dirt-simple: Machines aren\u2019t conscious; Bostrom is alarmed at\nthe prospect of malicious machines who do us in; a malicious machine\nis by definition a conscious machine; ergo, Bostrom\u2019s argument\ndoesn\u2019t work. Searle writes: \n\nIf the computer can fly airplanes, drive cars, and win at chess, who\ncares if it is totally nonconscious? But if we are worried about a\nmaliciously motivated superintelligence destroying us, then it is\nimportant that the malicious motivation should be real. Without\nconsciousness, there is no possibiity of its being real.\n\n\nThe positively remarkable thing here, it seems to us, is that Searle\nappears to be unaware of the brute fact that most AI engineers are\nperfectly content to build machines on the basis of the AIMA\nview of AI we presented and explained above: the view according to\nwhich machines simply map percepts to actions. On this view, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter whether the machine really has desires;\nwhat matters is whether it acts suitably on the basis of how AI\nscientists engineer formal correlates to desire. An\nautonomous machine with overwhelming destructive power that\nnon-consciously \u201cdecides\u201d to kill doesn\u2019t become\njust a nuisance because genuine, human-level, subjective desire is\nabsent from the machine. If an AI can play the game of chess, and the\ngame of Jeopardy!, it can certainly play the game of war. Just\nas it does little good for a human loser to point out that the\nvictorious machine in a game of chess isn\u2019t conscious, it will\ndo little good for humans being killed by machines to point out that\nthese machines aren\u2019t conscious. (It is interesting to note that\nthe genesis of Joy\u2019s paper was an informal conversation with\nJohn Searle and Raymond Kurzweil. According to Joy, Searle\ndidn\u2019t think there was much to worry about, since he was (and\nis) quite confident that tomorrow\u2019s robots can\u2019t be\n conscious.[45])\n \n\nThere are some things we can safely say about tomorrow.\nCertainly, barring some cataclysmic events (nuclear or biological\nwarfare, global economic depression, a meteorite smashing into Earth,\netc.), we now know that AI will succeed in producing artificial\nanimals. Since even some natural animals (mules, e.g.) can be\neasily trained to work for humans, it stands to reason that artificial\nanimals, designed from scratch with our purposes in mind, will be\ndeployed to work for us. In fact, many jobs currently done by humans\nwill certainly be done by appropriately programmed artificial animals.\nTo pick an arbitrary example, it is difficult to believe that\ncommercial drivers won\u2019t be artificial in the future. (Indeed,\nDaimler is already running commercials in which they tout the ability\nof their automobiles to drive \u201cautonomously,\u201d allowing\nhuman occupants of these vehicles to ignore the road and read.) Other\nexamples would include: cleaners, mail carriers, clerical workers,\nmilitary scouts, surgeons, and pilots. (As to cleaners, probably a\nsignificant number of readers, at this very moment, have robots from\niRobot cleaning the carpets in their homes.) It is hard to see how\nsuch jobs are inseparably bound up with the attributes often taken to\nbe at the core of personhood \u2013 attributes that would be the most\ndifficult for AI to\n replicate.[46]\n\n\nAndy Clark (2003) has another prediction: Humans will gradually\nbecome, at least to an appreciable degree, cyborgs, courtesy of\nartificial limbs and sense organs, and implants. The main driver of\nthis trend will be that while standalone AIs are often desirable, they\nare hard to engineer when the desired level of intelligence is high.\nBut to let humans \u201cpilot\u201d less intelligent machines is a\ngood deal easier, and still very attractive for concrete reasons.\nAnother related prediction is that AI would play the role of a\ncognitive prosthesis for humans (Ford et al. 1997; Hoffman et al.\n2001). The prosthesis view sees AI as a \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d\nthat would lead to less stratification in society, perhaps similar to\nhow the Hindu-Arabic numeral system made arithmetic available to the\nmasses, and to how the Guttenberg press contributed to literacy\nbecoming more universal. \n\nEven if the argument is formally invalid, it leaves us with a question\n\u2013 the cornerstone question about AI and the future: Will AI\nproduce artificial creatures that replicate and exceed human cognition\n(as Kurzweil and Joy believe)? Or is this merely an interesting\nsupposition? \n\nThis is a question not just for scientists and engineers; it is also a\nquestion for philosophers. This is so for two reasons. One, research\nand development designed to validate an affirmative answer must\ninclude philosophy \u2013 for reasons rooted in earlier parts of the\npresent entry. (E.g., philosophy is the place to turn to for robust\nformalisms to model human propositional attitudes in machine terms.)\nTwo, philosophers might well be able to provide arguments that answer\nthe cornerstone question now, definitively. If a version of either of\nthe three arguments against \u201cStrong\u201d AI alluded to above\n(Searle\u2019s CRA; the G\u00f6delian attack; the Dreyfus argument)\nare sound, then of course AI will not manage to produce machines\nhaving the mental powers of persons. No doubt the future holds not\nonly ever-smarter machines, but new arguments pro and con on the\nquestion of whether this progress can reach the human level that\nDescartes declared to be unreachable.
