    "main_text": "Legitimacy and Political Cosmopolitanism\n5. Legitimacy and Political Cosmopolitanism\n\nPolitical cosmopolitanism about political legitimacy is the view that\nnational communities are not the exclusive source of political\nlegitimacy in the global realm. This is a minimal characterization. It\nis compatible with a system in which nation states and their\ngovernments remain the main political agents, as long as there is some\nattribution of legitimate political authority to international\nconventions. For even if states and their governments are the main\npolitical entities, there is still the question about appropriate\nrelations among national actors. When should nation states recognize\nanother political entity as legitimate? And what are appropriate\nsanctions against entities that do not meet the legitimacy criteria?\nCall this the problem of international legitimacy.\n\nPolitical cosmopolitanism is also compatible with the much more\ndemanding idea of replacing nation states and national\ngovernments\u2014at least in certain policy areas\u2014by global\ninstitutions. Examples of relevant policy areas are trade or the\nenvironment. The associated global institutions may include both\nglobal rules (e.g., the rules of the WTO treaty) and global political\nagents (e.g., the UN General Assembly). This raises the question of\nwhat conditions such global governance institutions have to satisfy in\norder to qualify as legitimate. Call this the problem of global\nlegitimacy.\n",
