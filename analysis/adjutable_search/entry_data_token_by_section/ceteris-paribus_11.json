    "main_text": "Conclusion\n11. Conclusion\n\nWhere are the debates about cp-laws leading? What are the important\nchallenges to be met in future research? There are at least four main\nareas of productive future research:\n\n The debate on cp-laws since the 1980s has not particularly\nfocused on detailed case studies of laws in different scientific\ndisciplines. But this just seems to be what a satisfying theory of\ncp-laws requires. A possible result of detailed case studies might\nwell be that generalizations reveal quite different features in\ndifferent disciplines. In other words, the explication of cp-laws in,\nfor instance, physics, biology and economics might differ\nsignificantly. If so, this result also raises interesting\nmethodological questions for philosophers of science, such as\n\u201cWhat degree of unification (with respect to laws in different\nscientific disciplines) do we require in order to approve of a theory\nof cp-laws?\u201d. \n What is the connection between cp-laws and theories of (causal)\nexplanation, various theories of causation and mechanisms? When\napplied to the special sciences, many theories of (causal) explanation\n(cf. Woodward 2003, EG1, EG2), causation (cf.\nHausman 1998; Pearl 2000; Hitchcock 2001; Woodward 2003) and\nmechanisms (Machamer, Darden and Craver 2000; Glennan 2002; Craver\n2007) seem to presuppose generalizations. Interestingly, these\ngeneralizations tend to be classified as non-strict. Consequently,\nthese generalizations are in the domain of the debate on cp-laws.\nThese theories of explanation, causation and mechanisms are important\ntest cases for the adequacy of theories of cp-laws. \n What metaphysical claims do the various theories of cp-laws\ncommit us to? Do exclusive cp-laws commit us to assume that the\nfundamental laws of nature are deterministic? Or are they compatible\nwith a probabilistic metaphysics? Furthermore, do cp-laws commit us to\na dispositionalist metaphysics? Or are they compatible with a Humean\nontology? Is structural realism an adequate metaphysics for cp-laws in\ngeneral (see Wright 2017 for discussion) and in particular for the\nlaws of the special sciences? \n What role do cp-laws play in formal philosophy? For example, it\nis important to answer the following questions: How are the logical\nprinciples of non-monotonic reasoning connected to cp-laws? How do\ncp-laws relate to Bayesian probabilities, and to the rules of Bayesian\nupdating of these probabilities? \n\n\nThese areas of research are, of course, not a complete list of future\nresearch topics. Nevertheless, it seems to us that these questions are\ninteresting enough to stimulate productive further research on\nceteris paribus laws.\n",
