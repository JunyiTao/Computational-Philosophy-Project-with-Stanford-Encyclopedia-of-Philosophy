    "main_text": "\n\nA man might lose an appendix and some blood in surgery, but it seems\nwrong to say that there is a thing he lost in addition to the\nappendix. After a child destroys her sandcastle, there is one less\nthing in the world, but no less sand. One can count cakes, but not\ncake. Split a large portion of water in half and you will be left with\nwhat you started with\u2014water. Split a computer monitor in half\nand you will not be left with a monitor or monitors.\n\nThese examples point to a ubiquitous but elusive conceptual\ndistinction between stuff and things. Paradigmatic\nexamples of stuffs are wood, water, hydrogen, and iron. Less\nparadigmatic stuffs include beer, salsa, and butter. The most general\nphysical stuff-kind is matter. The concept of stuff is even\nmore general than matter. Concepts such as ectoplasm,\njustification, or phlogiston may refer to spiritual or abstract stuff.\n\u2018Things\u2019 or \u2018objects\u2019 refer, most\nparadigmatically, to medium-sized entities such as tables and cables,\npears and bears, and rocks and socks.\n\nPhilosophical explorations of the distinction have generated a number\nof interesting questions in philosophy of language and metaphysics.\nThe linguistic distinction between what are called mass\nexpressions (e.g., \u2018lead\u2019, \u2018the water in the\ntub\u2019) and count expressions (e.g., \u2018two\nhorses,\u2019 \u2018the horse in the barn\u2019) is believed to be\nimportant in examining the metaphysical stuff/thing distinction. In\nthis entry we will be more concerned with nominal mass expressions\n(e.g., \u2018the water in the tub\u2019, \u2018the gold in his\nteeth\u2019), as opposed to predicative mass expressions (e.g.,\n\u2018the statue is lead\u2019). While there are many issues in this\narea, we will be focused on the following kind of questions: Are\nthings illusory, the world consisting, most fundamentally, of stuff\nalone? Or is stuff just a certain kind of thing or things? Is all\napparent talk about physical kinds of stuff really veiled talk about\nindividual concrete portions of matter, or is matter per se\nan irreducible part of the furniture of the world?\n\nThe present essay articulates the foregoing questions, and surveys\nvarious answers to them.\n\nIn\n Section 1\n we will explore the metaphysical distinction between stuff and\nthings, and examine the linguistic data used to make the\nmass-noun/count-noun distinction, and show how it has been used to\nmotivate the metaphysical distinction. In\n Sections 2\n and\n 3,\n we will survey different answers to our main target question:\n\u201cwhat do nominal mass expressions refer to?\u201d Lastly, after\nexamining the linguistic data and the metaphysical theories, in\n Section 4\n we will examine whether the metaphysical stuff/thing distinction is\nwell-motivated by the linguistic mass/count distinction, and whether\nthe latter is up to the tasks assigned to it by\nmetaphysicians.\n",
