    "main_text": "Areas of overlap || The form of thought and the structure of reality. (L4) meets (O3)\n4.6 The form of thought and the structure of reality. (L4) meets (O3)\n\nOne way to understand logic is as the study of the most general forms\nof thought or judgment, what we called (L4). And one way to understand\nontology is as the study of the most general features of what there\nis, our (O3). Now, there is a striking similarity between the most\ngeneral forms of thought and the most general features of what there\nis. Take one example. Many thoughts have a subject of which they\npredicate something. What there is contains individuals that have\nproperties. It seems that there is a kind of a correspondence between\nthought and reality: the form of the thought corresponds to the\nstructure of a fact in the world. And similarly for other forms and\nstructures. Does this matching between thought and the world ask for a\nsubstantial philosophical explanation? Is it a deep philosophical\npuzzle?\n\nTo take the simplest example, the form of our subject-predicate\nthoughts corresponds perfectly to the structure of object-property\nfacts. If there is an explanation of this correspondence to be given\nit seems it could go in one of three ways: either the form of thought\nexplains the structure of reality (a form of idealism), or the other\nway round (a form of realism), or maybe there is a common explanation\nof why there is a correspondence between them, for example on a form\nof theism where God guarantees a match.\n\nAt first it might seem clear that we should try to give an explanation\nof the second kind: the structure of the facts explains the forms of\nour thoughts that represent these facts. And an idea for such an\nexplanation suggests itself. Our minds developed in a world full of\nobjects having properties. If we had a separate simple representation\nfor these different facts then this would be highly inefficient. After\nall, it is often the same object that has different properties and\nfigures in different facts, and it is often the same property that is\nhad by different objects. So, it makes sense to split up our\nrepresentations of the objects and of the properties into different\nparts, and to put them back together in different combinations in the\nrepresentation of a fact. And thus it makes sense that our minds\ndeveloped to represent object-property facts with subject-predicate\nrepresentations. Therefore we have a mind whose thoughts have a form\nwhich mirrors the structure of the facts that make up the world.\n\nThis kind of an explanation is a nice try, and plausible, but it is\nrather speculative. That our minds really developed this way in light\nof those pressures is a question that is not easy to answer from the\narmchair. Maybe the facts do have a different structure, but our forms\nare close enough for practical purposes, i.e. for survival and\nflourishing. And maybe the correspondence does obtain, but not for\nthis largely evolutionary reason, but for a different, more direct and\nmore philosophical or metaphysical reason.\n\nTo explain the connection differently one could endorse the opposite\norder of explanatory priority, and argue that the form of thought\nexplains the structure of the world. This would most likely lead to an\nidealist position of sorts. It would hold that the general features of\nour minds explain some of the most general features of reality. The\nmost famous way to do something like this is Kant\u2019s in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (Kant 1781/7). We won\u2019t be able\nto discuss it here in any detail. This strategy for explaining the\nsimilarity has the problem of explaining how there can be a world that\nexists independently of us, and will continue to exist after we have\ndied, but nonetheless the structure of this world is explained by the\nforms of our thoughts. Maybe this route could only be taken if one\ndenies that the world exists independently of us, or maybe one could\nmake this tension go away. In addition one would have to say how the\nform of thought explains the structure of reality. For one attempt to\ndo this, see Hofweber 2019, for another one, see Gaskin 2020.\n\nBut maybe there is not much to explain here. Maybe reality does not\nhave anything like a structure that mirrors the form of our thoughts,\nat least not understood a certain way. One might hold that the truth\nof the thought \u201cJohn smokes\u201d does not require a world\nsplit up into objects and properties, it only requires a smoking John.\nAnd all that is required for that is a world that contains John, but\nnot also another thing, the property of smoking. Thus a structural\nmatch would be less demanding, only requiring a match between objects\nand object directed thought, but no further match. Such a view would\nbe broadly nominalistic about properties, and it is rather\ncontroversial. \n\nAnother way in which there might be nothing to explain is connected to\nphilosophical debates about truth. If a correspondence theory of truth\nis correct, and if thus for a sentence to be true it has to correspond\nto the world in a way that mirrors the structure and matches parts of\nthe sentence properly with parts of the world, then the form of a true\nsentence would have to be mirrored in the world. But if, on the other\nextreme, a coherence theory of truth is correct then the truth of a\nsentence does not require a structural correspondence to the world,\nbut merely a coherence with other sentences. For more on all aspects\nof truth see K\u00fcnne 2003.\n\nWhether or not there is a substantial metaphysical puzzle about the\ncorrespondence of the form of thoughts and the structure of reality\nwill itself depend on certain controversial philosophical topics. And\nif there is a puzzle here, it might be a trivial one, or it might be\nquite deep. And as usual in these parts of philosophy, how substantial\na question is is itself a hard question.\n",
