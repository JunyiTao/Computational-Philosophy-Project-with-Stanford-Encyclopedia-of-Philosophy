    "main_text": "What do genes and DNA do? || A causal interpretation of claims about what genes do\n5.3  A causal interpretation of claims about what genes do\n\n Another approach to elucidating the role of genes and DNA is to\nreplace loose information talk with concrete causal descriptions\ngrounded in an explicit understanding of causation (Waters 2000, and forthcoming). This approach is\npremised on the idea that the basic theory and\nlaboratory methods associated with molecular genetics can be\nunderstood in purely causal terms. The basic\ntheory and methodology concerns the syntheses of DNA, RNA, and\npolypeptide molecules, not the alleged role of DNA in \"programming\" or\n\"directing\" development (section 2.3). The causal role of molecular\ngenes in the syntheses of these molecules can be understood in terms\nof causally specific actual difference making. This involves two\ncausal concepts, actual difference making and causal\nspecificity. These concepts can be explicated in terms of the\n manipulability account of causation\n .\n\n The concept of actual difference making applies in the context of an\nactual population containing entities that actually differ with\nrespect to some property. In such a population, there might be many\npotential difference makers. That is, there may be many\nfactors that could be manipulated to alter the relevant property of\nthe entities in the population. But the actual difference\nmakers are (roughly speaking) the potential difference makers that\nactual differ, and whose actual differences bring about the actual\ndifferences in the property in the population.\n\n The concept of actual difference making can be illustrated with the\ndifference principle of classical genetics (section 2.1). According to\nthis principle, genes can be difference makers with respect to\nphenotypic differences in particular genetic and environmental\ncontexts. So, it identifies potential difference makers. When this\nprinciple is used to explain an actual hereditary pattern, it is\napplied to genes that actually differed in the population exhibiting\nthe pattern (often an experimental population). In such cases, an\nactual difference in the gene among the organisms in the population\ncaused the actual phenotypic differences in that population (see\nGifford 1990). That is, the gene was the actual\ndifference maker, not just a potential difference maker (in that\npopulation). \n\n The concept of actual difference making can be applied to molecular\ngenetics as follows. In an actual cell, where a population of\nunprocessed RNA molecules differ with respect to linear sequence, the\nquestion arises: what causes these differences?  The answer is that\ndifferences in genes in the cell cause the actual differences in the\nlinear sequences in the unprocessed RNA molecules, and also in\npopulations of RNA molecules and polypeptides. Genes are not the only\nactual difference makers of the actual differences in the linear\nsequences of these molecules. And this brings us to the second causal\nconcept, causal specificity. \n\n Causal specificity has been analyzed by Lewis (2000). The basic idea\nis that a causal relationship between two properties is specific when\nmany different values in a causal property bring about many different\nand specifically different values of a resultant variable (the causal\nrelationships instantiate something like a mathematical function).  An\non/off switch is not specific in this technical sense because the\ncausal property has only two values (on and off). A dimmer switch is\ncausally specific in this sense. Genes can be specific difference\nmakers because many specific differences in the sequences of\nnucleotides in DNA result in specific differences in RNA\nmolecules. This is not the case with many other actual difference\nmakers, such as polymerases, which are more like on/off switches (with\nrespect to differences in linear sequences). Biologists have\ndiscovered, however, the existence of other actual difference makers,\nbesides genes and DNA, that are causally specific with respect to the\nlinear sequences of processed RNA and polypeptides, to some degree at\nleast. For example, in some cells splicing complexes called\nsplicosomes actually differ in multiple ways that result in multiple,\nspecific differences in the linear sequences of processed RNA\nmolecules. \n\n The fact that all kinds of entities are causally relevant to the\nsynthesis of RNA might lead one to think there is causal parity among\nthe causal elements. But this account shows that genes and DNA play a\ndistinctive causal role in that genes are the causally specific actual\ndifference makers of difference in the linear sequences of unprocessed\nRNA molecules. This distinctive role extends (with important\nqualifications) to the linear sequences of processed RNA molecules and\npolypeptides. The basic theory associated with molecular genetics, as\ndistinguished from the fundamental theory, can be elucidated in causal\nterms.\n",
