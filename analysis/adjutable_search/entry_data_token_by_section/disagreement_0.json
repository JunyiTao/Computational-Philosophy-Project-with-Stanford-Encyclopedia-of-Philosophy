    "main_text": "Disagreement and Belief\n1. Disagreement and Belief\n\n\nTo a certain extent, it may seem that there are just three doxastic\nattitudes to adopt regarding the truth of a claim: believe it\u2019s\ntrue, believe it\u2019s false (i.e., disbelieve it), and suspend\njudgment on it. In the most straightforward sense, two individuals\ndisagree about a proposition when they adopt different doxastic\nattitudes toward the same proposition (i.e., one believes it and one\ndisbelieves it, or one believes it and one suspends judgment). But of\ncourse there are levels of confidence one can have regarding a\nproposition as well. We may agree that global warming is occurring but\nyou may be much more confident than I am. It can be useful to use\n\u2018disagreement\u2019 to cover any difference in levels of\nconfidence: if \\(X\\) has one level of confidence regarding belief\n\\(B\\)\u2019s truth while \\(Y\\) has a different level of confidence,\nthen they \u201cdisagree\u201d about \\(B\\)\u2014even if this is a\nslightly artificial sense of \u2018disagree\u2019. These levels of\nconfidence, or degrees of belief, are often represented as point\nvalues on a 0\u20131 scale (inclusive), with larger values indicating\ngreater degrees of confidence that the proposition is true. Even if\nsomewhat artificial, such representations allow for more precision in\ndiscussing cases.\n\n\nWe are contrasting disagreements about belief from disagreements about\nmatters of taste. Our focus is on disagreements where there is a fact\nof the matter, or at least the participants are reasonable in\nbelieving that there is such a fact.\n",
