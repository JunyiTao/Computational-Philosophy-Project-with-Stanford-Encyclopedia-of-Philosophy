    "main_text": "Non-Paradigmatic Relational Situations || Relations of Reason\n5.1 Relations of Reason\n\n\nSo far, then, we have seen that medieval philosophers are committed to\nrecognizing at least one type of non-paradigmatic relational\nsituation\u2014namely, those involving a pair of substances and a\nsingle accident inhering in just one them. As we might expect,\nmedieval philosophers disagree about the precise nature of the\naccidents involved in these situations\u2014with reductive realists\nidentifying them with ordinary, non-relational accidents, and\nnon-reductive realists identifying them with accidents of a sui\ngeneris type.\n\n\nFor our purposes, however, what is most interesting about this type of\nrelational situation has to do with complication it presents for\nreductivists and non-reductivists alike. In paradigmatic relational\nsituations, there is always a distinct property or accident\ncorresponding to each member of the relevant pair of converse\nrelational concepts. Thus, when Simmias is taller than Socrates, there\nis one accident corresponding to the concept \u2018taller than\u2019\n(namely, an accident of Simmias) and another accident corresponding to\nthe concept \u2018shorter than\u2019 (namely, an accident of\nSocrates).  But now consider a situation such as Simmias\u2019s thinking\nabout Socrates (or God\u2019s being related to a creature)\u2014that is, a\nsituation where two substances are related by a property or accident\ninhering in only one of the relata. What is to be said about\nthe relationship between the relevant properties and concepts in\nsituations of this sort?\n\n\nInitially, we might expect medievals to respond to this by saying\nthat, in such situations, the single accident responsible for relating\nboth subjects corresponds to both members of the relevant pair of\nrelational concepts. Thus, if Simmias is thinking about Socrates, a\nquality of Simmias corresponds to both the concepts \u2018thinking\nof\u2019 and \u2018thought about\u2019. The problem with this\nsuggestion, however, is that it leads to the same sort of difficulties\nwe encountered earlier for identifying relations with pairs of\naccidents taken jointly. Socrates\u2019s being thought about appears to be\nsomething inhering in Socrates and Socrates alone. But if we identify\nthis relation with an accident of Simmias, then we shall have to say\nthat Socrates\u2019s being thought about does not exist in Socrates after\nall, but rather exists only in Simmias. Although medievals do allow\nfor cases of extrinsic denomination\u2014that is, cases\nwhere a property or accident of one thing is predicated of something\nelse\u2014they typically do not allow for this in the case of\nrelations. That is to say, they typically regard relations as\nintrinsic to the subjects of which their corresponding terms or\nconcepts are\n predicated.[35]\n Evidently, therefore, the relevant accident of Simmias can correspond\nto the concept \u2018thinking of\u2019, but not to the concept\n\u2018thought about\u2019. But, then, we still need to know what\ncorresponds to this latter concept.\n\n\nNow perhaps it will be suggested that, in the absence of any property\nor accident of Socrates to correspond to the concept \u2018thought\nabout\u2019, Socrates himself can serve as the correspondent. In that\ncase, however, we should have to admit that an individual substance is\na relation (since, as we have seen, whatever corresponds to a\nrelational concept and plays the relevant metaphysical role qualifies\nas a relation). But such an admission goes against deep-seated\nintuitions deriving from the Categories.  As we have seen,\nAristotle not only assumes that relations are accidents in the\nCategories, but intentionally characterizes them in such a\nway as to exclude substances from this category. But then we still\nlack a solution to our problem. If there is no property or accident of\nSocrates to correspond to the concept \u2018thought about\u2019, and\nneither Socrates nor a property of anything else can correspond to it,\nwhat if anything can?\n\n\nIt is at this point that the medieval notion of a relation of reason\n(relatio rationis) becomes relevant. Medieval philosophers\noften say that, even if there are relational situations involving only\na single accident, nonetheless these situations must be conceived\nas if they involved a pair, one belonging to each of the\nrelated things (cf., e.g., Aquinas, De potentia q. 1, a. 1,\nad 10). Like Boethius, the medievals accept the view that relations\ncannot be understood to exist by themselves or apart from their\ncorrelatives. At least conceptually, they say, relations always come\nin pairs. Thus, even if there is no real or extramental property in\nSocrates that accounts for his being thought about by Simmias, we must\nstill conceive of this situation as if there were one and, as\nit were, project this property onto Socrates. Since such\nprojections depend for their existence on the activity of the mind,\nmedieval philosophers refer to them as beings of reason (entia\nrationis). And their suggestion is that we take these beings of\nreason to be the items corresponding to or signified by concepts such\nas \u2018thought about\u2019.\n\n\nThe notion of a being of reason, or more specifically the notion of a\nrelation of reason, does not appear to have been invoked in the Latin\nWest before the thirteenth century, when Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics and certain Muslim philosophical commentaries and\ntreatises derived from it began to circulate widely. The notion of a\nrelation of reason is not to be found explicitly in the works of\nAristotle, though he does distinguish beings of reason in general from\nreal beings (cf.  Metaphysics IV, 1, esp. 1003a32\u2013b11 and V,\n7, esp.  1017a31\u201335). Even so, this notion is explicitly invoked by\ncertain Muslim philosophers, most notably Avicenna (d. 1037), and it\nmay well be that it makes its way into the Latin west through\nthem.\n\n\nHowever that may be, once the notion of a relation of reason is\nintroduced in the Latin West, it becomes pervasive\u2014so pervasive,\nin fact, that even philosophers, such as Ockham, who complain that\nsuch a notion is \u201cnot to be found in the writings of\nAristotle\u201d and that \u201c\u2018relation of reason\u2019 is\nnot a philosophical term,\u201d nevertheless feel compelled to give\nsome account of it in order to preserve common\n usage.[36]\n The pervasiveness of this notion is explained at least partly by the\nfact that medieval philosophers think it can be used to clarify and\nexplain a number of troublesome non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations. For example, by the end of thirteenth century, most\nphilosophers use it to explain the doctrine of creation, saying that\ncreatures are related to God by a real relation, whereas God is\nrelated to them by a mere relation of reason (cf.  Henninger\n1989). Again, many use the notion to clarify certain cases of\nrelational change. Thus, when a substance acquires a new relation\nwithout undergoing any real change this is often explained by saying\nthat the substance acquired a mere relation of\n reason.[37]\n Finally, some medieval philosophers use relations of reason to\nidentify a sense in which God can have accidents after all. Since\nrelations of reason are mere projections (or properties a thing has by\nvirtue of the activity of some mind), we can conceive of\nthem as accidents in a broad sense\u2014that is, as properties or\nfeatures that a thing can both acquire and lose. But since the\nacquisition or loss of these properties does not require a subject to\nundergo any real change, some medievals claim that there is no reason\nin principle why even God should not have accidents of this\n sort.[38]\n",
