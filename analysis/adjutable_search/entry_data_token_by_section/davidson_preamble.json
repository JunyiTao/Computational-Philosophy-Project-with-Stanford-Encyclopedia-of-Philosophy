    "main_text": "\n\nDonald (Herbert) Davidson was one of the most important philosophers\nof the latter half of the twentieth century whose reception and\ninfluence is matched, among American philosophers, perhaps only by\nthat of his teacher, W. V. O. Quine. Davidson\u2019s ideas, presented\nin a series of essays (and one posthumous monograph) from the 1960s\nonwards, have had an impact in a range of areas from semantic theory\nthrough to epistemology and ethics. His work exhibits a breadth of\napproach, as well as a unitary and systematic character, that is\nunusual within twentieth century analytic philosophy. Although he\nacknowledged an important debt to Quine, Davidson\u2019s thought\namalgamates influences from a wide range of sources within philosophy\nas well as outside. And whilst often developed separately,\nDavidson\u2019s ideas nevertheless combine in such a way as to\nprovide a single integrated approach to the problems of knowledge,\naction, language, and mind. The breadth and unity of his thought, in\ncombination with the sometimes terse character of his prose, means\nthat Davidson is not an easy writer to approach. Given the demanding\nnature of his work, it is perhaps only to be expected that it would\nreceive a range of interpretations and assessments, and this is\nespecially true of much of the engagement with Davidson\u2019s\nthought that has developed in the last 20 years or so. In several\npublications, Kirk Ludwig, for instance, has advanced readings of\nDavidson\u2019s philosophy, frequently in collaboration with Ernest\nLepore, that although partly exegetical also take issue with many of\nDavidson\u2019s claims and arguments (see e.g. Lepore and Ludwig\n2005; see also the exchange between Lepore and Ludwig and Stoutland in\nBaghramian, 2013). This reflects a more general tendency for\nDavidson\u2019s thinking to appear as a focus more often for critique\nthan elaboration. Despite Davidson\u2019s pre-eminence in analytic\nfigure during the 1970s and 1980s, his influence has waned over the\nlast decade or more and his work is now largely taken up, not in any\nsystematic fashion, but in relation to specific issues, especially of\nmind and action (although this also reflects more general shifts in\nthe configuration of current philosophical thought and practice\n\u2013 see Brandom, 2020: 260). Yet neither the various critiques\nthat have been advanced nor disciplinary shifts in philosophical\ndirection or approach should be taken to undermine the significance of\nDavidson\u2019s contribution, and his work has nonetheless continued\nto have an influence in the work of a range of thinkers. At the same\ntime, the re-publication of Davidson\u2019s essays, especially those\nfrom later in his career, has disseminated his ideas to a wider, and\nsometimes newly appreciative audience. In addition, Davidson\u2019s\nwork remains an important, if sometimes contentious, point of focus\nfor philosophical interaction between analytic and so-called\n\u2018continental\u2019 thought (see e.g. Malpas, 2011), and for\nreflection on the history and character of analytic thought as such\n(see, e.g, Isaac, 2013; Braver, 2017).\n",
