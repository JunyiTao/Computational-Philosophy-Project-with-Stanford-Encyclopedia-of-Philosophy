    "main_text": "Philosophy || Affecting the Past\n2.2 Affecting the Past?\n\nDoes backward causation mean that a future cause is changing\nsomething in the past? Talking about forward causation we think\nof the cause as the event that produces its effect or brings it about.\nIt is not part of our notion of forward causation that the cause\nchanges anything in the future. A cause determines what the effect\nwill be. Regardless of whether one is an advocate for presentism, the\ngrowing block universe, or eternalism, one never considers the cause\nas an event that will make the future different from what it will\nbe. Indeed, without the forward-directed cause the future would have\nbeen different from what it is going to be.\n\nEven most protagonists consider it an unwarranted consequence that the\nnotion of backward causation, if consistent, involves the idea that\nthe future is able to change the past. Their answer has therefore\nusually been that if we have the power to bring something about in the\npast, what came about really already existed when the past was\npresent. We have to make a distinction between changing the past so it\nbecomes different from what it was and influencing the past so it\nbecomes what it was. A coherent notion of backward causation only\nrequires that the future is able to have an influence on what happens\nin the past. Nonetheless, we can say, quite parallel to forward\ncausation, that the past would have been different if the\nbackward-directed cause had not made the past as it turned out to\nbe.\n",
