    "main_text": "\n\nIn the discipline of international relations there are contending\ngeneral theories or theoretical perspectives. Realism, also known as\npolitical realism, is a view of international politics that stresses\nits competitive and conflictual side. It is usually contrasted with\nidealism or liberalism, which tends to emphasize cooperation. Realists\nconsider the principal actors in the international arena to be states,\nwhich are concerned with their own security, act in pursuit of their\nown national interests, and struggle for power. The negative side of\nthe realists\u2019 emphasis on power and self-interest is often their\nskepticism regarding the relevance of ethical norms to relations among\nstates. National politics is the realm of authority and law, whereas\ninternational politics, they sometimes claim, is a sphere without\njustice, characterized by active or potential conflict among states,\nwhere ethical standards do not apply.\n\nNot all realists, however, deny the presence of prescriptive ethics in\ninternational relations. The distinction should be drawn between\nclassical realism\u2014represented by such twentieth-century\ntheorists as Reinhold Niebuhr and Hans Morgenthau\u2014and radical or\nextreme realism. While classical realism emphasizes the concept of\nnational interest, it is not the Machiavellian doctrine \u201cthat\nanything is justified by reason of state\u201d (Bull 1995, 189). Nor\ndoes it involve the glorification of war or conflict. The classical\nrealists do not reject the possibility of moral judgment in\ninternational politics. Rather, they are critical of\nmoralism\u2014abstract moral discourse that does not take into\naccount political realities. They assign ethical value to successful\npolitical action based on prudence: the ability to judge the rightness\nof a given action from among possible alternatives on the basis of its\nlikely political consequences.\n\nRealism encompasses a variety of approaches and claims a long\ntheoretical tradition. Among its founding fathers, Thucydides,\nMachiavelli and Hobbes are the names most usually mentioned.\nTwentieth-century classical realism has today been largely replaced by\nneorealism, which is an attempt to construct a more scientific\napproach to the study of international relations. Both classical\nrealism and neorealism have been subjected to criticism from IR\ntheorists representing liberal, critical, and post-modern\nperspectives. The growing tensions among superpowers have revived the\nrealist-idealist debate in the twenty-first century and have led to a\nresurgence of interest in the realist tradition.\n",
