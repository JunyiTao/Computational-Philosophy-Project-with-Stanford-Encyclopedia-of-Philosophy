In this respect, what we\nfind in Book One is similar to the algebraic elaboration of\ngeometrical problems presented by Vi\u00e8te in his 1594\nSupplement of geometry as he explains the stage of exegetics.\nThat said, Descartes\u2019 approach to analysis rests on innovations\nin notation and formalism as well as in the merging of geometry and\narithmetic which move him beyond Vi\u00e8te\u2019s analysis,\nlending some credence to Descartes\u2019 remark to Mersenne that, in\nLa G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, his program for geometry begins\nwhere Vi\u00e8te\u2019s left off (To Mersenne, December 1637, AT I,\n479; CSMK 77\u201379; See Macbeth 2004 for discussion of the\nrelationship between Vi\u00e8te\u2019s \u201canalytical art\u201d\nand Descartes\u2019 use of analysis in geometry).\n\nBook One commences with the geometrical interpretation of algebraic\noperations, which, we saw above, Descartes had already explored in the\nearly period of his mathematical research. However, what we are\npresented in 1637 is, as Guicciardini aptly describes, a\n\u201cgigantic innovation\u201d both over Descartes\u2019 previous\nwork and the work of his contemporaries (Guicciardini 2009, 38). On\nthe one hand, Descartes offers a geometrical interpretation of root\nextraction and thus treats five arithmetical operations (as opposed to\nthe four operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\ndivision that were treated in his early work). On the other hand, and\nmore significantly, his treatment relies on an interpretation of\narithmetical operations according to which these operations are taken\nto be closed operations on line segments. Traditionally, for instance,\nthe product of two segments \\(a \\times b\\) was interpreted as\na rectangle, but for Descartes, the product is interpreted as a\nsegment. This allows Descartes to translate geometrical problems into\nequations (that include products such as \\(a \\times b)\\) and\ntreat each term of the equation as similar in kind. Finally, Descartes\nuses a new exponential notation as he sets forth equations of multiple\nterms in Book One, and this notation, which replaces the traditional\ncossic notation of early modern algebra, allows Descartes to tighten\nthe connection between algebra and geometry, and more specifically,\nbetween the algebraic representation of curves through equations with\nthe geometrical classification and geometrical solution of stated\nproblems (as we will see more clearly below in\n section 3.2).\n\nWith his new geometrical interpretation of the five basic arithmetical\noperations at his disposal, Descartes proceeds to describes how, in\nthe stage of geometrical analysis, one is to give an algebraic\ninterpretation of a geometrical problem:\n\n\nIf, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution\nalready effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful\nfor its construction,\u2014to those that are unknown as well as to\nthose that are known. Then, making no distinction between unknown and\nunknown lines, we must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows\nmost naturally the relations between these lines, until we find it\npossible to express a single quantity in two ways. This will\nconstitute an equation, since the terms of one of these two\nexpressions are together equal to the terms of the other (G,\n6\u20139).\n\n\nWe notice that the key to Descartes\u2019 analysis is to make no\ndistinction between the known and unknown quantities in the problem:\nBoth kinds of quantities are granted a variable (generally,\n\\(a, b, c\\ldots\\) for known quantities and\n\\(x, y, z\\ldots\\) for unknown quantities),\nand thus, we treat the unknowns as if their values were already found.\nOr, as Descartes puts it, we \u201csuppose the solution already\neffected.\u201d The task then is to reduce the problem to an equation\n(in contemporary terms, to a polynomial equation in two unknowns) that\nexpresses the unknown quantity, or quantities, in terms of the known\nquantities. For instance, take the following\n problem:[5]\n\n\nGiven a line segment AB containing point C (see\n figure 6),\n the problem is to produce AB to D such that the product AD\\(\\times\\)DB is\nequal to the square of CD. Let AC \\(= a\\), CB \\(= b\\), and\nBD \\(= x\\), which yields AD \\(= a + b + x\\) and CD \\(= b + x\\). Thus, the problem to find\nBD such that AD\\(\\times\\)DB = (CD)\\(^2\\) is algebraically equivalent to\nfinding \\(x\\) such that: \\((a + b + x)\\times(x) = (b + x)^2\\). Or,\nsolving for \\(x\\), the problem is to find \\(x\\) such that,\ngiven \\(a\\) and \\(b, x = b^2 /\n(a\\)\u2014\\(b)\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\nIn this example, we are dealing with a determinate problem, i.e., a\nproblem to which there are a finite number of solutions, and we can\ntherefore reduce the problem to a single equation that expresses the\nunknown quantity in terms of the known quantities. However, as\nDescartes points out, there are also indeterminate problems that\ninvolve an infinite number of solutions. (Locus problems, such as the\nPappus Problem, are of this sort, because the solution includes the\ninfinitely many points that lie along a curve.) When dealing with an\nindeterminate problem, Descartes instructs us that \u201cwe may\narbitrarily choose lines of known length for each unknown line to\nwhich there corresponds no equation\u201d (G, 9), i.e., we are to set\nthe unknown lines as oblique coordinates that have a stated value. We\nthen generate several equations that express the unknown quantities in\nterms of one or more known quantities, and solve the equations\nsimultaneously. This is precisely the approach that Descartes takes as\nhe treats the Pappus Problem in Book One.\n\n\nFigure 7. The Four-Line Pappus Problem in Book One (G, 27)\n\n\nDescartes begins with consideration of the problem when we are given\nthree or four lines, which, borrowing from Guicciardini (2009), can be\nstated as follows (see\n figure 7):\n\n\nHaving three or four lines given in position, it is required to find\nthe locus of points C from which drawing three or four lines to the\nthree or four lines given in position and making given angles with\neach one of the given lines the following condition holds: the\nrectangle [or product] of two of the three lines so drawn shall bear a\ngiven ratio to the square of the third (if there be only three), or to\nthe rectangle [or product] of the other two (if there be four)\n(Guicciardini 2009, 54; based on G, 22).\n\n\nIn Book One, Descartes applies his geometrical analysis to the\nfour-line case of the Pappus problem. He begins by designating two\ngiven line segments (of unknown length) AB and BC as oblique\ncoordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, such that all\nother lines needed to solve the problem will be expressed in terms of\n\\(x\\) and\n \\(y\\).[6]\n Then, by considering the angles given in the problem and the\nproperties of similar triangles, he generates an algebraic expression\nof the sought after points C in terms of the two unknowns \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) and the known quantity \\(z\\) (where \\(z\\)\ndesignates the ratio given in the problem) (G, 29\u201330).\n\nImportantly, the analytic method that Descartes uses in the four-line\ncase is generalized to apply to the general, \\(n\\)-line version\nof the Pappus Problem. That is, Descartes\u2019 claim is that no\nmatter how many lines and angles are given in the problem, it is\npossible, by means of his analytic method, to express the sought after\npoints C in terms of two unknown quantities (in contemporary terms, to\nreduce the problem to a polynomial equation in two unknowns) (G, 33).\nAs a result, for any \\(n\\)-line version of the Pappus Problem, we\ncan generate values for C and construct the sought after Pappus curve\nin a pointwise manner by assigning different values to \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\). As Descartes puts it,\n\n\nFurthermore, to determine the point C, but one condition is needed,\nnamely, that the product of a certain number of lines shall be equal\nto, or (what is quite as simple), shall bear a given ratio to the\nproduct of certain other lines. Since this condition can be expressed\nby a single equation in two unknown quantities, we may give any value\nwe please to either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) and find the value of the\nother from this equation. It is obvious that when not more than five\nlines are given, the quantity \\(x\\), which is not used to express\nthe first of the lines can never be of degree higher than the\nsecond.\n\nAssigning a value to \\(y\\), we have \\(x^2 = \\pm ax \\pm b^2\\), and therefore\n\\(x\\) can be found with ruler and compasses, by a method [for\nconstructing roots] already explained. If then we should take\nsuccessively an infinite number of different values for the line\n\\(y\\), we should obtain an infinite number of values for the line\n\\(x\\), and therefore an infinity of different points, such as C,\nby means of which the required curve can be drawn (G, 34).\n\n\nThe result of Descartes\u2019 analysis, as indicated by the remarks\nabove, is that the curve that includes the sought after points C can\nbe pointwise constructed by using ruler and compass to solve for the\nroots of a second-degree equation in two unknowns. He then generalizes\nthis result and claims that the solution points for any problem that\ncan be reduced to a second-degree equation can be constructed by ruler\nand compass. If instead a problem is reduced to an equation of third\nor fourth degree, the points are constructed by conics, and if a\nproblem is reduced to an equation of fifth or sixth degree, the points\nare constructed by a curve that is \u201cjust one degree higher than\nthe conic sections\u201d (G, 37). In other words, Descartes\u2019\nclaim is that if a problem can be reduced to a single equation of\ndegree not higher than six, in which the unknown quantity or\nquantities are expressed in terms of a known quantity, then the roots\nof the equation can be constructed by straightedge and circle, or by\nconic, or by a more complicated curve that does not have degree higher\nthan four. Based on this result, Descartes suggests a way to\ngeneralize further and solve the \\(n\\)-line Pappus Problem, for\nno matter how many given lines and angles with which a Pappus Problem\nbegins, it will be possible to reduce the problem to an equation and\nthen pointwise construct the roots of the equation, i.e., the sought\nafter points C of the problem (G, 37).\n\nWhat Descartes achieves here by means of his geometrical analysis is\nno doubt significant. He has outlined a way of solving the Pappus\nProblem for any number of given lines. However, questions about\nproving the Pappus Problem solved still linger come the end of Book\nOne. As in Vi\u00e8te\u2019s analysis, Descartes has shown that a\nsolution to the general problem exists but the algebraic elaboration\nof the problem does not unto itself give a clue to how we are to\ngeometrically construct the curve that solves the problem. Notice in\nparticular that in Book One the roots (i.e., the points along the\nsought after curves) are constructed by straight edge, compass,\nconics, and higher order curves, such that the Pappus curves that\ninclude the roots are constructed pointwise. But this leaves us the\nquestion: Are the Pappus curves of Book One legitimately geometrical?\nThat is, can the curves that solve the \\(n\\)-line version of the\nPappus Problem themselves be constructed by legitimately geometrical\nmethods? This is an issue broached in Book Two, the main focus of\nwhich is how to enact a synthesis, or construction, of a geometrical\nproblem.\n",
