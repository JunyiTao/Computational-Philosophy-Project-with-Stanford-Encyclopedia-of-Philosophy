    "main_text": "Contemporary Approaches and Debates || Feminist Democratic Theory\n2.8 Feminist Democratic Theory\n\nAre there any reliable foundations on which to base feminist politics?\nBy the end of the 1990s, postmodern critiques of the subject and\nfeminist critiques of the category \u201cwoman\u201d produced real\nuncertainty about the status of the subject of feminist politics,\nseeing a radical danger of relativism and disunity, and the field\nseemed to be at an impasse. But then another approach began to emerge.\nAs Mary Dietz writes in her 2003 essay on current controversies in\nfeminist theory,\n\n\nIn recent years, political theorists have been engaged in debates\nabout what it might mean to conceptualize a feminist political praxis\nthat is aligned with democracy but does not begin from the binary of\ngender. Along these lines, Mouffe (1992b: 376, 378; 1993), for\nexample, proposes a feminist conception of democratic citizenship that\nwould render sexual difference \u201ceffectively nonpertinent\u201d.\nPerhaps the salient feature of such conceptions is the turn toward\nplurality, which posits democratic society as a field of interaction\nwhere multiple axes of difference, identity, and subordination\npoliticize and intersect. (Dietz 2003: 419; citing Phelan 1994; Young\n1990, 1997, 2000; Benhabib 1992; Honig 1992; K. Ferguson 1993;\nPhillips 1993, 1995; Mouffe 1993; Yeatman 1994, 2001; Bickford 1996;\nDean 1996; Fraser 1997; K. Nash 1998; Heyes 2000; McAfee 2000)\n\n\nFollowing up on what has happened in feminist political theory since\nDietz\u2019s article, Sharon Krause writes that this work is\n\u201ccontesting the old assumption that agency equals\nautonomy\u201d and makes room \u201cwithin agency for forms of\nsubjectivity and action that are nonsovereign but nevertheless\npotent\u201d (Krause 2011; citing Amy Allen 2008, Beltr\u00e1n\n2010, Butler 2004, Hirschmann 2003, and Zerilli 2005.) \u201cFor some\ntheorists\u201d, Krause writes,\n\n\nthis shift involves thinking of agency and freedom in more collective\nways, which emphasize solidarity, relationality, and constitutive\nintersubjectivity. (Krause 2011: 108; citing Butler 2004; Cornell\n2007; Mohanty 2003; and Nedelsky 2005)\n\n\n(As we saw in the previous section, decolonial feminists like Lugones\nwere already critiquing Eurocentric conceptualizations of agency that\npresume individual autonomy and sovereignty [Lugones 2003].)\n\nThis constellation of thinkers have a performative account of politics\nand subjectivity. Performative in several senses: in theorizing how\nagency is constituted, how political judgments can be made in the\nabsence of known rules (Honig 2009: 309), how new universals can be\ncreated and new communities constituted. From a performative feminist\nperspective, feminism is a project of anticipating and creating better\npolitical futures in the absence of foundations. As Linda Zerilli\nwrites,\n\n\npolitics is about making claims and judgments\u2014and having the\ncourage to do so\u2014in the absence of the objective criteria or\nrules that could provide certain knowledge and the guarantee that\nspeaking in women\u2019s name will be accepted or taken up by others.\n(Zerilli 2005: 179)\n\n\nZerilli calls for a \u201cfreedom-centered feminism\u201d that\n\n\nwould strive to bring about transformation in normative conceptions of\ngender without returning to the classical notion of freedom as\nsovereignty\n\n\nthat feminists have long criticized but found difficult to resist\n(ibid.). Rather than basing politics on already existing categories,\nprinciples, or values, a performative approach understands categories\nlike identity and gender to be performatively constituted, thus\nappealing to other people, not to supposed universal truths or\nfoundations. \u201cHow we assume these identities\u201d, Drucilla\nCornell writes,\n\n\nis never something \u201cout there\u201d that effectively determines\nwho we can be as men and women\u2014gay, lesbian, straight, queer,\ntranssexual, transgender, or otherwise. (Cornell 2003: 144)\n\n\nIt is something that is shaped as we live and externalize identities\nwith others.\n\nThis view takes democracy to be an ongoing and unfinished project with\nany outcome open to further contestation. It recuperates many of the\nideals of the Enlightenment\u2014such as freedom, autonomy, and\njustice\u2014but in a way that drops the Enlightenment\u2019s\nmetaphysical assumptions about reason, progress, and human nature.\nInstead of seeing these ideals as grounded in some metaphysical facts,\nthis new view sees them as ideals that people hold and try to\ninstantiate through practice and imagination. Where many ancient and\nmodern ideals of politics were based on suppositions about the nature\nof reality or of human beings, contemporary political philosophies\ngenerally operate without supposing that there are any universal or\neternal truths. Some might see this situation as ripe for nihilism,\narbitrariness, or the exercise of brute power. The democratic\nalternative is to imagine and try to create a better world by\nanticipating, claiming, and appealing to others that it should be so.\nEven if there is no metaphysical truth that human beings have dignity\nand infinite worth, people can act as if it were true in order to\ncreate a world in which it is seen to be so.\n\nDespite the shared post-foundational theorizing among democratic\nfeminist theorists and the commitment to thinking of politics as\nplural, when it comes to thinking about democratic politics, there are\nsharp divergences, namely on the question of \u201cwhat it means to\nactualize public spaces and enact democratic politics\u201d (Dietz\n2003: 419). On this question, theorists tend to diverge into two\ngroups: associational and agonistic. Associational theorists (e.g.,\nBenhabib 1992, [ed.] 1996b; Benhabib & Cornell [eds] 1987; Fraser\n1989; Young 1990, 1997, 2000) gravitate more toward deliberative\ndemocratic theory. They have roots in the socialist and Marxist\ntraditions, especially as they developed in the Frankfurt-School\ntradition of critical theory. They are more optimistic about the\nprospects for democracy. Agonistic theorists (e.g., Mouffe [ed.]\n1992a, 1993, 1999, 2000; Honig [ed.] 1995; Ziarek 2001) worry that\ndemocratic theories that focus on consensus can silence the kind of\ndisagreement essential for democratic progress. Thus they focus more\non plurality, dissensus, and the ceaseless contestation within\npolitics. Agonistic theorists are grounded in much of the\npoststructural feminist approach described earlier, wary of any claims\nto universality and identity.\n\nThe differences spring from, or perhaps lead to, different readings of\nthe philosopher who has most inspired performative political theory:\n Hannah Arendt,\n namely Arendt\u2019s ideas of speech and action in the public\nsphere, of the meaning of plurality, of the ways in which human beings\ncan distinguish themselves. As Bonnie Honig, a champion of the\nagonistic model writes,\n\n\nPolitical theorists and feminists, in particular, have long criticized\nArendt for the agonistic dimensions of her politics, charging that\nagonism is a masculinist, heroic, violent, competitive, (merely)\naesthetic, or necessarily individualistic practice. For these\ntheorists, the notion of an agonistic feminism would be, at best, a\ncontradiction in terms and, at worst, a muddled and, perhaps,\ndangerous idea. Their perspective is effectively endorsed by Seyla\nBenhabib who, in a recent series of powerful essays, tries to rescue\nArendt for feminism by excising agonism from her thought. (Honig\n1995b: 156)\n\n\nAssociational theorists tend to look for ways, amidst all the\ndifferences and questions about the lack of foundations, it is\npossible to come to agreement on matters of common concern. This is\nseen in feminist democratic theory, perhaps best known through the\nworks of Seyla Benhabib (1992, 1996b), greatly inspired by her\nnon-agonistic reading of Arendt and of the work of the German critical\ntheorist, J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Benhabib\u2019s work engages\ndemocratic theorists quite broadly, not just feminist theorists. The\nfollowing passage helps to clarify what she takes to be the best aim\nof a political philosophy: a state of affairs to which all affected\nwould assent. As she writes,\n\n\nOnly those norms (i.e., general rules of action and institutional\narrangements) can be said to be valid (i.e., morally binding), which\nwould be agreed to by all those affected by their consequences, if\nsuch agreement were reached as a consequence of a process of\ndeliberation that had the following features: 1) participation in such\ndeliberation is governed by norms of equality and symmetry; all have\nthe same chances to initiate speech acts, to question, to interrogate,\nand to open debate; 2) all have the right to question the assigned\ntopics of conversation; and 3) all have the right to initiate\nreflexive arguments about the very rules of the discourse procedure\nand the way in which they are applied or carried out. (Benhabib 1996b:\n70)\n\n\nFollowing Habermas, Benhabib contends that certain conditions need to\nbe in place in order for members of a political community to arrive at\ndemocratic outcomes, namely the proceedings need to be deliberative.\nSome take deliberation to be a matter of reasoned argumentation;\nothers see it as less about reason or argumentation but more about an\nopen process of working through choices. (McAfee 2004.)\n\nNot all theorists who tend toward the associational model embrace\ndeliberative theory so readily. Iris Young\u2019s pioneering book,\nJustice and the Politics of Difference and several of her\nsubsequent works have been very influential and led to a good deal of\nhesitance in feminist theoretical communities about the claims of\ndeliberative theory. Where Benhabib is confident that conditions can\nbe such that all who are affected can have a voice in deliberations,\nYoung points out that those who have been historically silenced have a\ndifficult time having their views heard or heeded. Young is skeptical\nof the claims of mainstream democratic theory that democratic\ndeliberative processes could lead to outcomes that would be acceptable\nto all (Young 1990, 1997). Young, along with Nancy Fraser (1989) and\nothers, worried that in the process of trying to reach consensus, the\nuntrained voices of women and others who have been marginalized would\nbe left out of the final tally. Young\u2019s criticisms were very\npersuasive, leading a generation of feminist political philosophers to\nbe wary of deliberative democratic theory. Instead of deliberative\ndemocracy, in the mid 1990s Young proposed a theory of communicative\ndemocracy, hoping to make way for a deliberative conception that was\nopen to means of expression beyond the rational expression of\nmainstream deliberative democratic theory. Young worried that\ndeliberation as defined by Habermas is too reason-based and leaves out\nforms of communication that women and people of color tend to use,\nincluding, as she puts it, \u201cgreeting, rhetoric, and\nstorytelling\u201d. Young argued that these alternative modes of\ncommunication could provide the basis of a more democratic,\ncommunicative theory. In her last major book, Inclusion and\nDemocracy (2000), Young had clearly moved to embrace deliberative\ntheory itself, seeing the ways in which it could be constructed to\ngive voice to those who had been otherwise marginalized. More recent\nfeminist democratic theory has engaged deliberative theory more\npositively (see McAfee & Snyder 2007).\n\nWhere liberal feminists inspired by\n John Rawls\n and democratic feminists inspired by\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas\n and/or\n John Dewey\n hold out the hope that democratic deliberations might lead to\ndemocratic agreements, agonistic feminists are wary of consensus as\ninherently undemocratic. Agonistic feminist political philosophy comes\nout of poststructural continental feminist and philosophical\ntraditions. It takes from Marxism the hope for a more radically\negalitarian society. It takes from contemporary continental philosophy\nnotions of subjectivity and solidarity as malleable and constructed.\nAlong with postmodern thought, it repudiates any notion of\npre-existing moral or political truths or foundations (Ziarek 2001).\nIts central claim is that feminist struggle, like other struggles for\nsocial justice, is engaged in politics as ceaseless contestation.\nAgonistic views see the nature of politics as inherently conflictual,\nwith battles over the direction of political society being the central\ntask of democratic struggle. Advocates of agonistic politics worry\nthat the kind of consensus sought by democratic theorists (discussed\nabove) will lead to some kind of oppression or injustice by silencing\nnew struggles. As Chantal Mouffe puts it,\n\n\nWe have to accept that every consensus exists as a temporary result of\na provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power, and that it\nalways entails some form of exclusion. (Mouffe 2000: 104)\n\n\nWhere associational theorists seek out ways that people can overcome\nsystematically distorted communication and deliberation, Dietz notes\nthat agonists eschew this project because they understand politics\nas\n\n\nessentially a practice of creation, reproduction, transformation and\narticulation.... Simply put, associational feminists scrutinize the\nconditions of exclusion in order to theorize the emancipation of the\nsubject in the public sphere of communicative interaction; agonistic\nfeminists deconstruct emancipatory procedures to disclose how the\nsubject is both produced through political exclusions and positioned\nagainst them.
