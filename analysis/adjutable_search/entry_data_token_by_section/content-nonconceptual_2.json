An important distinction: State vs. content nonconceptualism\n\nHeck (2000) introduces an alternative conception of the debate over\nnonconceptual content. This conception arises from an ambiguity he\nfinds in Evans (1982) and other proponents of nonconceptual content.\nHe notes that these proponents appeal to the thesis that while the\nbeliefs a person can have depend on the concepts she possesses, the\nperceptual states she can have do not. However, this thesis does not\nimmediately establish a conclusion about the contents of\nperception. It establishes only a conclusion about the conditions a\nsubject must satisfy to be in a perceptual state with some\ncontent. Prima facie, this conclusion appears to be compatible with\nthe claim that perceptual states and belief states have the same type\nof content.\n\nHeck distinguishes two different ways of drawing the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction. According to the\ncontent view, there is a fundamental difference between the\ntype of content that perceptual experiences can have and the type of\ncontent that beliefs and other propositional attitudes can have.\nAccording to the state view, in contrast, there need not be\nmore than one type of content. Perceptual experiences and\npropositional attitudes could have contents of the same type (in both\ncases content could be given in terms of sets of possible worlds, for\nexample). What distinguishes perceptions from propositional attitudes\non the state view is that the latter are concept-dependent while the\nformer are concept-independent. A state-type is concept-dependent just\nif it is content-bearing and it is impossible for a thinking and\nperceiving subject to be in a token state of that type without\npossessing the concepts required to specify the content of that token\nstate. In contrast, a subject can be in states of a\nconcept-independent state-type even if she lacks all or some of the\nconcepts required for an accurate specification of the relevant\n contents.[5]\n\nSeveral reasons have been proposed for considering state,\nrather than content, nonconceptualism as of primary\nimportance in the nonconceptual debate. First, as many have noted\n(Byrne 2003, 2005, Speaks 2005, Crowther 2006, Heck 2007), keeping the\nstate/content distinction in mind suggests that much of the recent\ndebate purportedly aiming at the content of perception in\nfact only concerns state-nonconceptualism. Arguments for the\nnonconceptual content of perception usually proceed via demonstration\nof the concept-independence of perception. However, this is a\ncharacteristic of state-nonconceptualism; it does not seem to entail\ncontent-nonconceptualism directly. In section\n 4.1,\n after reviewing the arguments that have been proposed for the\nnonconceptual content of perception, we will return to this\nconcern.\n\nA second reason offered for discussing nonconceptualism at the level\nof state type rather than at the level of content is that it allows\nfor a meaningful debate about nonconceptualism even if one holds that\nall content is nonconceptual. Stalnaker (1984, 1998), for example,\nargues that all content should be understood in terms of sets of\npossible worlds. If that is the case, then the difference between the\npropositional attitudes and perception should be elucidated in terms\nextrinsic to the type of content involved in these states. This can be\nachieved if we think that the propositional attitudes, but not\nperceptual states, are concept-dependent; that is, if we think that\nhaving propositional attitudes but not perceptual states requires the\nsubject of those attitudes to possess certain concepts. This reasoning\nholds equally well if one thinks that all content is conceptual. In\nsuch a case, one is forced to explain the difference between different\ntypes of content involving states in terms extrinsic to the nature of\ntheir contents; the state-view is one way of explaining this\ndistinction, by appeal to the capacities required of a subject if she\nis to undergo such states.\n\nAn additional reason that the \u201cstate\u201d view might be found\nappealing is that it allows for the commonsensical notion that the\ncontents of perception can be taken at face value to produce beliefs\nthat have the same content. If, on the other hand, one holds\nthat the content of perception is of a fundamentally different\nkind than that of belief, it is less easy to see how one can\nrespect the intuition that one believes the same thing that one\nperceives (Byrne 2005, Speaks 2005). Furthermore, it has been argued\nthat perception can play a justificatory role in the production of\nperceptual beliefs only if belief and perception involve the same kind\nof content (McDowell 1994a, 2006, Brewer 1999, 2005). This claim has\nbeen disputed (e.g., Heck 2000, Peacocke 2001a, Lerman 2010, Cahen\n2019. For more on the justificatory role of perception see section\n 4.1).\n\nThe \u201cstate\u201d view attempts to make the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction a distinction between types of\nstates, those that are concept-dependent and those that are\nconcept-independent. Berm\u00fadez (2007) argues that such a\ndistinction is implausible when considered independently of the\ndistinction drawn by the \u201ccontent\u201d view. The difficulty he\nidentifies with the \u201cstate\u201d view is that it is unclear\nwhat basis there might be for a distinction between concept-dependent\nand concept-independent state types other than the distinctive\ncontents of these states. That is, the \u201cstate\u201d view owes\nus some account of why some states, such as the propositional\nattitudes, are concept-dependent, whereas other states, such as\nperceptual states, are concept-independent. It seems that a natural\nexplanation for why perceptual states, but not propositional\nattitudes, are concept-independent is that perceptual states differ\nfrom propositional attitudes in the type of contents that are\ninvolved (which determines, for example, the particular inferential relations in which they can stand). This explanation is not available if we hold that perception\nand the propositional attitudes have contents of the same type.\n\nIt is open to the \u201cstate\u201d view theorist to attempt to\nexplain the \u201cstate\u201d view distinction in terms of the\nfunctional roles of the different state types. She might argue for the\ndistinction by pointing out that the functional role of belief depends\non an organism\u2019s conceptual capacities and the functional role\nof perception does not depend on its conceptual capacities (since,\narguably, an organism\u2019s perceptual discriminations can outstrip\nits conceptual capacities). However, there is a sense in which this\nwould be a mere restatement of the problem rather than a solution to\nit, since we still need some account of the concept-(in)dependence\nof these functional roles. Again, an appeal to the different\nkinds of contents involved in these different states seems to be a\nstraightforward explanation. The \u201cstate\u201d view theorist\nmight also attempt to explain the \u201cstate\u201d view distinction\nby appeal to the phenomenological differences between the\npropositional attitudes and perception. However, this too seems\nproblematic, since it is unclear why the lack of phenomenology should\nmake a belief concept-dependent or why the phenomenology of perception\nshould make it concept-independent (Berm\u00fadez 2007).\n\nIn a recent article, Toribio (2008) places further pressure on the\nplausibility of the state/content distinction. She argues that\narguments couched in \u201cstate\u201d terms\u2014appealing to the\nconditions the subject must satisfy in order to undergo states with\ncertain representational contents\u2014do entail conclusions about\nthe contents of those states. The entailment is established by noting\nthe first motivation for the conceptual constraint, mentioned above\n(section 2), regarding the proper specification of content. When\nspecifying the representational content of some mental state one has\nto be as faithful as possible to how the creature undergoing that\nstate apprehends the world. Yet, how the creature apprehends the\nworld, she argues, depends on what cognitive capacities it has. Thus,\na creature that lacks conceptual capacities cannot be properly\nattributed states with conceptual contents. Arguments to the effect\nthat perception is state-nonconceptual\u2014that a creature\ncan undergo perceptual states without having the concepts utilized in\nspecifying the content of those states\u2014thus also amount to\narguments that the content of those states are nonconceptual. See Van\nCleve (2012) and Schmidt (2015) for further arguments supporting the\ninterdependence of the state and content views of nonconceptualism. For responses to these arguments against the state/content distinction, see Duhau (2014)\n",
