Conclusions\n\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox is not only a surprising mathematical fact; it\nserves as a lens through which to understand the role of probabilities\nin data analysis, causal inference, and decision-making. In this\narticle, we have characterized its mathematical properties, given\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence, discussed its\ninfluence on theories of causality, evaluated competing theories of\nthe nature of the paradox, and surveyed its applications in a range of\nempirical domains.\n\nAlthough Simpson\u2019s Paradox has been known for over a century and\nhas a straightforward probabilistic analysis, we predict that it will\nremain a source of fruitful philosophical discussion. Pearl\u2019s\ncausal analysis of the paradox is relatively recent, and it is only\nnow that graphical causal models are starting to play a central role\nin philosophical discussions of the paradox. Despite the continuity\nbetween graphical accounts and earlier probabilistic theories of\ncausality, here we have highlighted ways in which the newer methods\nlead one to draw substantially different implications from the\nparadox. Pearl\u2019s account renders certain debates from the\nearlier literature moot, while opening up new debates about the proper\ninterpretation of the paradox. The responses to Pearl considered in\n section 4\n are only the first steps in a broader discussion about the\nrelationships between causation, probability theory, and the\npsychology of reasoning. There remains room to clarify what it means\nto explain the paradox, and what counts as empirical support for a\nparticular explanation. Such work would open the door to empirical\ntesting, which has thus far been limited.\n\nFinally, we would like to highlight connections between\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox and other reasoning fallacies in the\nliterature. First, the base rate fallacy is related to\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox since the illusion that association reversal\nis impossible may be based on a neglect of the different base rates\nfor treated and untreated people, given the third variable (Bar-Hillel\n1990). Second, the fallacy of mistaking correlation for\ncausation may contribute to the appearance of paradoxicality\nsince association reversal implies two contradicting causal claims,\nwhen combined with this fallacy. Third, in both Simpson\u2019s\nParadox and the Monty Hall fallacy reasoners fail to see the\nprobabilistic relevance of causal information. While in\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox, reasoners ignore the relevance of a back-door\npath for an observed association, in the Monty Hall problem, reasoners\nfail to take into account how Monty\u2019s action depends on his\nknowledge of what is in back of the doors. Fourth, and last, the\ncapacity of reasoners to detect the causes of association reversal\nalso depends on the extent of the confirmation bias to which\nthey are exposed (e.g., whether or not they find a discrimination\nmechanism plausible). We are unaware of systematic research into the\nconnection between Simpson\u2019s Paradox and these reasoning\nfallacies, but this could be a fruitful field for future research.\nThere is perhaps nothing paradoxical about Simpson\u2019s Paradox,\nbut since we often struggle to understand it, our reasoning about\nassociation reversals may be entangled with various forms of reasoning\nthat are susceptible to bias and error.\n",
