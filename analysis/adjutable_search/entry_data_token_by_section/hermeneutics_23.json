Both Heidegger and Gadamer, for example, uphold\nAristotle\u2019s ethics as an important source for their respective\napproaches to interpretive\n experience.[14]\n Gadamer, in particular, develops the implications of his hermeneutics\nfor practical life. Although Gadamer provides no systematic ethical or\npolitical theory, he maintains the significance of interpretive\nexperience as a counter to the alienation produced in modern,\nbureaucratically managed society, he develops a hermeneutical approach\nto the ethical significance of friendship as well as a related\napproach to political solidarity (see Gadamer, \u201cFriendship and\nSolidarity\u201d; see Vessey 2005). Moreover, Paul Ricoeur has argued\nthat an important test of the universality of hermeneutics is the\nextension of hermeneutical considerations to the practical sphere. In\nthis, he clarifies that and how interpretive experience, especially\nthe interpretive experience of narrative, plays an important role no\nless in practical agency than political critique (see Ricoeur,\nFrom Text to Action).\n\nIt is therefore perhaps no surprise that several philosophers have\ndeveloped approaches and positions in ethical and political philosophy\nin connection with hermeneutics. In ethical philosophy, for example,\nDennis Schmidt has recently argued that Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics comprises an \u2018original ethics,\u2019 in that\nGadamer clarifies normative implications of interpretive experience\nthat, however, are irreducible to any ethical system or principles\n(see D. Schmidt 2008, 2012 and 2016). In political philosophy, Richard\nBernstein\u2019s considerations of human rationality \u2018beyond\nobjectivism and relativism,\u2019 and the attention he gives to\nhermeneutics in this context, has been an important impetus (Bernstein\n1983). Relatedly, Genevieve Lloyd has invoked hermeneutic motifs to\nquestion norms of rationality from a feminist perspective (Lloyd\n1984). Fred Dallmayr\u2019s use of Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics in\nhis considerations of political theory, comparative political theory,\nand inter-cultural dialogue (see for example Dallmayr 1987, 1996 and\n2009) have been likewise influential. Georgia Warnke has defended\nGadamer\u2019s hermeneutics as a middle path between subjectivism and\nconservatism, and, in turn, she has examined the significance of\nhermeneutics for democratic theory, theories of deliberative\ndemocracy, questions of race and identity, and solidarity (see for\nexample Warnke 1987, 1993, 2002, 2007 and 2012). Linda Mart\u03afn\nAlcoff has also drawn substantially on Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics in\nconsiderations of race and gender identity (see Alcoff 2006). Lauren\nSwayne Barthold has drawn on hermeneutics to develop a feminist\napproach to social identity and, more recently, to examine the\nsignificance of civic dialogue to foster pluralistic, democratic\ncommunities (see Barthold 2016 and 2020).\n",
