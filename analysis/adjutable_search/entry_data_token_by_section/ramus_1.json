    "main_text": "Biography || Ramus\u2019 death and personality\n1.3 Ramus\u2019 death and personality\n\nRamus was an extremely controversial figure. He acquired admirers and\nfriends as easily as he did opponents, critics and enemies\u2014one\nof whom, according to an unreliable report, was responsible for his\ndeath. In spite of the differing accounts given by his biographers, we\nknow that Ramus was murdered during the St. Bartholomew\u2019s day\nmassacre, which started on August 24, 1572. On the third day he was\ncaptured in his study at the Coll\u00e8ge de Presles. His body was\nmutilated and perhaps decapitated before being thrown into the Seine.\nAlthough the king had ordered for him to be spared, we do not know why\nthese instructions were disobeyed. Since, however, Ramus was not\nkilled until the slaughter had almost died down, this may indicate\nthat the reasons for his murder went beyond his conversion to\nProtestantism. At any rate, he became a kind of martyr to his many\nfollowers.\n\nNancelius, in order to present an accurate portrait of Ramus, provides\nsome details about his way of life and his personality. He tells us\nthat Ramus was as dark-skinned as an Italian or a Spaniard, rather\ntall and had an impressively black and bushy beard, of which he was\nvery proud\u2014once when the rector of the University of Paris\nordered all professors to shave, Ramus obeyed but stayed at home until\nhis beard had grown out again. His gait was graceful and regal, his\nposture striking and dignified. He seems to have been quite moderate\nin his drinking and eating habits. He spent most of his time reading,\nwriting and talking with friends. Nancelius also reports that Ramus\ntook a bath only once a year, but washed his hands, face and beard\ndaily in a mixture of water and white wine. Although as a professor he\nwas not allowed to marry, he did from time to time have female\nfriends.\n\nRamus is reputed to have had a very bad temper. Sometimes he even\nphysically attacked his young students, though apparently this did not\nprevent him from gaining many devoted disciples. He amassed a\nsubstantial fortune and made a provision in his will that this money\nshould be used to establish a chair of mathematics. Significantly, it\nwas not to be attached to the University of Paris but was instead to\nhave the same type of special conditions granted to royal\nprofessors.\n",
