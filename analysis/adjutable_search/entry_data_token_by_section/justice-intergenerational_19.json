    "main_text": "The Significance of Past Wrongdoing || Carrying Out Acts of Symbolic Compensation in Fulfilling a Surviving Duty Towards the Dead Victims\n5.5 Carrying Out Acts of Symbolic Compensation in Fulfilling a Surviving Duty Towards the Dead Victims\n\nDoes the theory of surviving duties contribute to an understanding of\nthe moral significance of the fact that past people\nwere severely wronged? Here we consider the notion that if\npeople (possibly as members of ongoing societies) can be said to have\nan obligation to compensate surviving and indirect victims of past\ninjustices (see\n \u00a75.1\n and\n \u00a75.2),\n they may also have an obligation symbolically to compensate dead\nvictims of past injustices, people who cannot now be affected by\nactions of currently living people (Meyer 2005: ch. 3; Meyer\n2018).\n\nLet us suppose that currently living people can stand under surviving\nduties toward past people even though they can neither change the\nvalue to them of any moment of their lives since they cannot be\naffected by what people do after their death nor can they be thought\nto be bearers of interests or rights (see\n \u00a75.4).\n If so, currently living people can act in ways that will constitute a\nviolation of the surviving duties under which they stand owing to the\nrights the deceased once held. Currently living people may be thought\nto stand under particular surviving duties toward the deceased owing\nto their future-oriented projects, the promises they made to them, or\nthe contractual obligations they entered into with them. However, not\nall people have the opportunity or the wish to have a specific impact\non posthumous states of affairs. Not all people pursue projects that\nare future-oriented in the relevant way and not all people oblige\nothers to bring about what for them are posthumous states of affairs.\nHere one suggestion is that currently living people can stand under\nsurviving duties toward dead people owing to the fact that they were\nvictims of historical injustices. In order to show that currently\nliving people can stand under such duties, one will have to assume\nthat people generally have interests with respect to posthumous states\nof affairs. Indeed, people can generally be thought to be interested\nin enjoying a good reputation both during their lifetime and\nposthumously (Meyer 2005: 99\u2013104).\n\nOn the basis of this assumption the theory of surviving duties\ncontributes to an understanding of the moral significance of the\nfact that past people were severely wronged When\npeople were violated in their rights, and badly so, their posthumous\nreputation depends upon their being publicly acknowledged as victims\nof these wrongs, and others being identified as the wrongdoers (see\nalso Margalit 2002: chs. 2\u20134). In acknowledging past individuals\nas victims of egregious wrongs we cannot affect their well-being.\nAlso, such acknowledgment cannot be expressed face to face with the\ndead victims, but only vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people in\nlight of the wrongs past people suffered. However, if it is true that\ncurrently living people stand under surviving duties toward past\nvictims of historical injustice owing to the wrongs they suffered,\nthen currently living people fulfilling the duty by publicly\nacknowledging the past injustices they suffered will change the\nrelation between them and the dead victims of historical injustice. It\nwill be true of the past victims of these injustices that they have\nthe posthumous property that currently living people fulfilled their\nsurviving duty toward them. To be sure, a change of the relation\nbetween an existent person and a dead person does not bring about a\nreal change to the latter. Rather, the relational change is based upon\nthe real change of the person who carries out the act (see Ruben 1988:\n223\u201331).\n\nFor currently living people to bring about public acknowledgment of\npast people as victims of historical injustice can require different\nmeasures under different circumstances. They can express their\nacknowledgment of past people as victims of past wrongs in an indirect\nway, namely, by providing compensation for those who are worse off\nthan they should be owing to the effects of the past injustices\nsuffered by their predecessors or by conferring benefits on living\npeople in whose well-being as members of a group we assume the dead\nvictims of past wrongs had an interest. The message of such\ncompensation can contain the acknowledgment that past people were\nvictims of past wrongs. Arguably, efforts at appropriate commemoration\nof past victims can be understood as symbolic compensation and\nrestitution.\n\nEstablishing a memorial is the typical course of action where the\neffort is made to realize the symbolic value of compensating those\nvictims who are no longer living. A memorial may be a public speech, a\nday in the official calendar, a conference, a public space or a\nmonument\u2014for example, a sculpture or an installation. Often\nthese memorials are meant to commemorate crimes that previous members\ncommitted in the name of a political society whose currently living\nmembers now want to carry out actions of public symbolic compensation\nor restitution for these crimes toward the victims and their\ndescendants. Such acts have been carried out since the 1970s in\nGermany, and there is evidence of an international practice of\nsymbolic\n compensation.[20]\n Those who carry out acts of symbolic compensation will want to\nprovide some real compensation to those who currently suffer as a\nresult of the same past wrongs, to help those who currently are\nvictims of similar injustices, and to prevent such injustices from\nhappening\n again.[21]\n The reasons for acts of symbolic compensation provide reasons for\nreal compensation where this is possible. Symbolic compensation\nbelongs to the measures likely to have the effect of providing\nsurviving victims or groups with assistance in recovering or regaining\nmembership and recognition in their respective societies, such that\nthey are once again able to lead lives under conditions of\n justice.[22]\n\nThe practice of symbolic compensation as understood here aims at\nrecognizing past people as victims of injustices without presupposing\nthat they can be current bearers of interests or rights. Insofar as\npeople generally have an interest and a just claim to enjoy the\nreputation they deserve while alive, and insofar as the reasons for\ntheir just claim can oblige us even after the bearer of the interest\nand the just claim has ceased to exist, our carrying out acts of\nsymbolic compensation can be understood as fulfilling a surviving duty\ntoward dead people who were wronged in the past, namely the duty of\nrestoring to them the posthumous reputation they deserve.\n",
