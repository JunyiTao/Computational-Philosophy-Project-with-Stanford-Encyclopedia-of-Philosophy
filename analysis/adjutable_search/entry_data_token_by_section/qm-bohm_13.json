    "main_text": "Lorentz Invariance\n14. Lorentz Invariance\n\nLike nonrelativistic quantum theory, of which it is a version, Bohmian\nmechanics is not compatible with special relativity, a central\nprinciple of physics: Bohmian mechanics is not Lorentz invariant. Nor\ncan it easily be modified to accommodate Lorentz\ninvariance. Configurations, defined by the simultaneous\npositions of all particles, play too crucial a role in its\nformulation, with\n the guiding equation\n defining an evolution on configuration space. (Lorentz\ninvariant extensions of Bohmian mechanics for a single particle,\ndescribed by the Dirac equation (Bohm & Hiley 1993; D\u00fcrr et\nal. 1999) or the Klein-Gordon equation (Berndl et al. 1996; Nikolic\n2005), can easily be achieved, though for a Klein-Gordon particle\nthere are some interesting subtleties, corresponding to what might\nseem to be a particle traveling backwards in time.)\n\nThis difficulty with Lorentz invariance and the nonlocality in Bohmian\nmechanics are closely related. Since quantum theory itself, by virtue\nmerely of the character of its predictions concerning EPR-Bohm\ncorrelations, is irreducibly nonlocal (see\n Section 2),\n one might expect considerable difficulty with the Lorentz invariance\nof orthodox quantum theory as well with Bohmian mechanics. For\nexample, the collapse rule of textbook quantum theory blatantly\nviolates Lorentz invariance. As a matter of fact, the intrinsic\nnonlocality of quantum theory presents formidable difficulties for the\ndevelopment of any (many-particle) Lorentz invariant formulation that\navoids the vagueness of orthodox quantum theory (see Maudlin\n1994).\n\nBell made a somewhat surprising evaluation of the importance of the\nproblem of Lorentz invariance. In an interview with the philosopher\nRen\u00e9e Weber, not long before he died, he referred to the\nparadoxes of quantum mechanics and observed that \n\n\nThose paradoxes are simply disposed of by the 1952 theory of Bohm,\nleaving as the question, the question of Lorentz invariance.\nSo one of my missions in life is to get people to see that if they\nwant to talk about the problems of quantum mechanics\u2014the real\nproblems of quantum mechanics\u2014they must be talking about Lorentz\ninvariance. (Interview with John Bell, in Weber 1989 [Other Internet\nResources])\n\n\nThe most common view on this issue is that a detailed description of\nmicroscopic quantum processes, such as would be provided by a putative\nextension of Bohmian mechanics to the relativistic domain, must\nviolate Lorentz invariance. In this view Lorentz invariance in such a\ntheory would be an emergent symmetry obeyed by our\nobservations\u2014for Bohmian mechanics a statistical consequence of\nquantum equilibrium that governs the results of quantum experiments.\nThis is the opinion of Bohm and Hiley (1993), of Holland (1993), and\nof Valentini (1997).\n\nHowever\u2014unlike nonlocality\u2014violating Lorentz invariance is\nnot inevitable. It should be possible, it seems, to construct a fully\nLorentz invariant theory that provides a detailed description of\nmicroscopic quantum processes. One way to do this is by using an\nadditional Lorentz invariant dynamical structure, for example a\nsuitable time-like 4-vector field, that permits the definition of a\nfoliation of space-time into space-like hypersurfaces providing a\nLorentz invariant notion of \u201cevolving configuration\u201d and\nalong which nonlocal effects are transmitted. See D\u00fcrr et al.\n1999 for a toy model. Another possibility is that a fully Lorentz\ninvariant account of quantum nonlocality can be achieved without the\ninvocation of additional structure, exploiting only what is already at\nhand, for example, the wave function of the universe or light-cone\nstructure. For more on the latter possibility, see Goldstein and\nTumulka\u2019s model (2003), in which they reconcile relativity and\nnonlocality through the interplay of opposite arrows of time. For a\ndiscussion of the former possibility, see D\u00fcrr et al. 2014. In\nthe sort of theory discussed there, the wave function of the universe\nprovides a covariant prescription for the desired foliation. Such a\ntheory would be clearly Lorentz invariant. But it is not so clear that\nit should be regarded as relativistic.\n\nBe that as it may, Lorentz invariant nonlocality remains somewhat\nenigmatic. The issues are extremely subtle. For example, Bell rightly\nwould find \n\n\ndisturbing \u2026 the impossibility of \u201cmessages\u201d faster\nthan light, which follows from ordinary relativistic quantum mechanics\nin so far as it is unambiguous and adequate for procedures \\(we\\)\n[emphasis added] can actually perform. The exact elucidation of\nconcepts like \u201cmessage\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d, would be a\nformidable challenge. (1981a, reprinted 1987c: 155) \n\n\nWhile quantum equilibrium and the absolute uncertainty that it entails\n(D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec 1992a) may be of some help\nhere, the situation remains puzzling.\n",
