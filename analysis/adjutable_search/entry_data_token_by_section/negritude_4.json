N\u00e9gritude as ontology\n\nWhen it comes to defining the substance of N\u00e9gritude, there is\nan important difference between the three main heralds of the\nmovement. Damas, a poet more than a theorist, spoke of it in the\n\u201cintroduction\u201d of his anthology as the vital force behind\nany new and true\u2014that is liberating\u2014poetry. As to\nC\u00e9saire, he has often insisted that N\u00e9gritude was\nprimarily the reclaiming of a heritage in order to regain initiative.\nHe declared:\n\nN\u00e9gritude, in my eyes, is not a philosophy. N\u00e9gritude is\nnot a metaphysics. N\u00e9gritude is not a pretentious conception of\nthe universe. It is a way of living history within history: the\nhistory of a community whose experience appears to be \u2026 unique,\nwith its deportation of populations, its transfer of people from one\ncontinent to another, its distant memories of old beliefs, its\nfragments of murdered cultures. How can we not believe that all this,\nwhich has its own coherence, constitutes a heritage? (2004,\n 82)[6]\n\n\nUnlike Damas and C\u00e9saire, Senghor affirmed that\nN\u00e9gritude was also the expression of a philosophy to be read in\nthe cultural products of Africa; and above all in African religions.\nDifferent as they are from one region to another, from one culture to\nanother, there is still ethnographical evidence that many of them\nshare to be founded on an ontology of life forces. \u201cThe whole\nsystem\u201d, Senghor declares, in a lecture \u201cOn\nN\u00e9gritude\u201d delivered at Lovanium University in Kinshasa,\n\u201cis founded on the notion of vital force. Pre-existing, anterior\nto being, it constitutes being. God has given vital force not only to\nmen, but also to animals, vegetables, even minerals. By which they\nare. But it is the purpose of this force to increase\u201d (1993,\n19). Senghor then explains that in the human being the increase of the\nforce is the process of her becoming a person \u201cby being\nfreer and freer within an interdependent community\u201d (1993, 19).\nHe adds that the ultimate meaning of religion is to assure the\ncontinuous increase of the vital force of the living, in particular\nthrough the main ritual of the sacrifice of an animal. This ontology\nof life forces has been summarized by Belgian philosopher Leo Apostel\nin the following propositions:\n\nTo say that something exists is to say that it exercises a\nspecific force. To be is to be a force.\nEvery force is specific (as against a pantheistic interpretation,\nsince what is asserted here is the existence of monadic, individual\nforces).\nDifferent types of beings are characterized by different\nintensities and types of forces.\nEach force can be strengthened or weakened [rein-forced\nor de-forced, as Senghor puts it].\nForces can influence and act upon each other in virtue of their\ninternal natures.\nThe universe is a hierarchy of forces organized according to their\nstrengths, starting from God and going all the way down to the mineral\nthrough the founding ancestors, the important dead, living humans,\nanimals and plants.\nDirect causal action involves the influence of more-being or\nstronger force, on less-being, weaker force. (Apostel 1981,\n 26\u201329)[7]\n\n\nPoint 6 in particular constitutes a good summary of the view shared by\nmany African religions characterized as \u201canimism\u201d while\nthe other points help understand the particular type of causality that\nhas been labeled magical thinking. As early as in 1939, at a time when\nLeon Damas had already published his first collection of poems,\nPigments (1937) and C\u00e9saire had just finished a\nversion of his Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal\n(\u201cNotebook of a return to my Native Land\u201d (C\u00e9saire\n2000a)), Senghor had published an essay on the philosophy of\nN\u00e9gritude entitled \u201cCe que l\u2019homme noir\napporte\u201d (\u201cWhat the Black Man Contributes\u201d). As he\nexplored in that essay the notion of rhythm as constitutive of what he\ncalled \u201cthe negro style\u201d, Senghor was trying to say that\nthe productions of African art were to be understood first and\nforemost as the language of an ontology of vital forces.\n\nSo it is not surprising that he was so enthusiastic when, six years\nlater, he discovered a book by Reverend Father Placide Tempels diving\na clear exposition of Bantu Philosophy as resting upon such\nan ontology (Tempels 1945). Tempels was a Belgian Franciscan priest\nwho went to the Congo as a missionary. He had the view that in order\nto be more efficient preaching the Gospel to the Bantu people he had\nfirst to understand the principles underlying their belief system,\ntheir customary law, their cultural habits, and so on. He explained\nthat he came to realize that one could and should go beyond mere\nethnographical description of those characteristics of the\npeople\u2019s lives and dig out a set of ontological principles on\nwhich they were founded. In other words that there existed a Bantu\nphilosophy of being underlying their laws, behaviors,\nbeliefs, politics, etc. The book, first written in Flemish then\npublished in French in 1945 by Pr\u00e9sence africaine\nunder the title La philosophie bantoue, became quite an\nevent: it was one of the very first times that an African people was\nassociated with philosophy, an intellectual pursuit considered at\nleast since Hegel to be the unique telos of Western\ncivilization.\n\nNothing probably is more indicative of the difference between\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor and his friend Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire than their respective reactions to the widely\ncelebrated book by Father Tempels. While Senghor embraced it as going\nalong the same lines he was exploring in his 1939 essay,\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s reaction was one of rejection. It is not that\nC\u00e9saire did not accept the substance of Tempels\u2019 theses.\nIn fact the summary he makes of them is perfectly adequate: \u201cNow\nthen, know that Bantu thought is essentially ontological\u201d, he\nwrites in his 1955 Discours sur le colonialisme\n[8],\u201cthat\n Bantu ontology is based on the truly fundamental notions of a life\nforce and a hierarchy of life forces; and that for the Bantu the\nontological order which defines the world comes from God and, as a\ndivine decree, must be respected\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58). In\nfact what provoked C\u00e9saire\u2019s skepticism and sarcasm\nvis-\u00e0-vis Tempels\u2019 work was its implications as a tool to\njustify and perpetuate the colonial order. \u201cSince Bantu thought\nis ontological\u201d, he tittered, \u201cthe Bantu only ask for\nsatisfaction of an ontological nature. Decent wages! Comfortable\nhousing! Food! These Bantu are pure spirits, I tell you\n\u2026\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58) Above all, there is for\nC\u00e9saire, the way in which the colonial order is made by Tempels\na new part of Bantu ontology and therefore legitimized and even\nsanctified in the eyes of the Bantu themselves: \u201cAs for the\ngovernment, why should it complain?\u201d Since the Rev. Tempels\nnotes with obvious satisfaction, \u201cfrom their first contact with\nthe white man, the Bantu considered us from the only point of view\nthat was possible to them, the point of view of their Bantu\nphilosophy\u201d and \u201cintegrated us into their hierarchy of\nlife forces at a very high level\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b,\n58). The final result being then that \u201cthe Bantu god will take\nresponsibility for the Belgian colonialist order, and any Bantu who\ndare to raise his hand against it will be guilty of sacrilege\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58).\n\nIn sum, in the eyes of Senghor, Tempels\u2019 Bantu\nphilosophy, along with Bergson\u2019s philosophy of\n\u00e9lan vital, provided the language of life philosophy\nwhich he considered characteristic of the cultures of Africa and those\nof African\n origin.[9]\n For him N\u00e9gritude is an ontology of life forces to be\ndescribed as a vitalism. C\u00e9saire who was more skeptical about a\nphilosophical content of the word dismissed Tempels\u2019 enterprise\nnot on the basis of its substance but because of what he considered\nthe intention behind the text of Bantu philosophy: an attempt\nto reform colonialism in order to perpetuate it.\n",
