    "main_text": "Pragmatist Theories of Truth || James on Truth\n3.2 James on Truth\n\nJames departed from Peirce in claiming that pragmatism was itself a\ntheory of truth. And his writings on this topic rapidly became\nnotorious. They are characteristically lively, offering contrasting\nformulations, engaging slogans, and intriguing claims which often seem\nto fly in the face of common sense. We can best summarize his view\nthrough his own words:\n\nThe true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way\nof belief, and good, too, for definite assignable reasons. (1907: 42)\n\n\n\u2018The true\u2019, to put it very briefly, is only the\nexpedient in the way of our thinking, just as \u2018the right\u2019\nis only the expedient in the way of our behaving. Expedient in\nalmost any fashion; and expedient in the long run and on the whole, of\ncourse. (1907: 106)\n\n\nOther formulations fill this out by giving a central role to\nexperience:\n\nIdeas \u2026 become true just in so far as they help us to get into\nsatisfactory relation with other parts of our experience. (1907: 34)\n\n\nAny idea upon which we can ride \u2026; any idea that will carry us\nprosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor; is true\nfor just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally.\n(1907: 34)\n\n\nThis might be taken to suggest that beliefs are made true by the fact\nthat they enable us to make accurate predictions of the future run of\nexperience, but other passages suggest that the \u2018goodness of\nbelief\u2019 can take other forms. James assures us that it can\ncontribute to the truth of a theological proposition that it has\n\u2018a value for concrete life\u2019 (1907: 40); and this can occur\nbecause the idea of God possesses a majesty which can \u2018yield\nreligious comfort to a most respectable class of minds\u2019\n(1907:40). This suggests that a belief can be made true by the fact\nthat holding it contributes to our happiness and fulfilment.\n\nThe kind of passages just noted may seem to support Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s famous objection that James is committed to the truth\nof \u201cSanta Claus exists\u201d (Russell 1946, p, 772). This is\nunfair; at best, James is committed to the claim that the happiness\nthat belief in Santa Claus provides is truth-relevant. James\ncould say that the belief was \u2018good for so much\u2019 but it\nwould only be \u2018wholly true\u2019 if it did not \u2018clash\nwith other vital benefits\u2019. It is easy to see that, unless it is\nsomehow insulated from the broader effects of acting upon it, belief\nin Santa Claus could lead to a host of experiential surprises and\ndisappointments.\n",
