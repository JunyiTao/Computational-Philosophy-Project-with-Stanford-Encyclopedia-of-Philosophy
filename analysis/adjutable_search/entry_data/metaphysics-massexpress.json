    "preamble": "\n\nA man might lose an appendix and some blood in surgery, but it seems\nwrong to say that there is a thing he lost in addition to the\nappendix. After a child destroys her sandcastle, there is one less\nthing in the world, but no less sand. One can count cakes, but not\ncake. Split a large portion of water in half and you will be left with\nwhat you started with\u2014water. Split a computer monitor in half\nand you will not be left with a monitor or monitors.\n\nThese examples point to a ubiquitous but elusive conceptual\ndistinction between stuff and things. Paradigmatic\nexamples of stuffs are wood, water, hydrogen, and iron. Less\nparadigmatic stuffs include beer, salsa, and butter. The most general\nphysical stuff-kind is matter. The concept of stuff is even\nmore general than matter. Concepts such as ectoplasm,\njustification, or phlogiston may refer to spiritual or abstract stuff.\n\u2018Things\u2019 or \u2018objects\u2019 refer, most\nparadigmatically, to medium-sized entities such as tables and cables,\npears and bears, and rocks and socks.\n\nPhilosophical explorations of the distinction have generated a number\nof interesting questions in philosophy of language and metaphysics.\nThe linguistic distinction between what are called mass\nexpressions (e.g., \u2018lead\u2019, \u2018the water in the\ntub\u2019) and count expressions (e.g., \u2018two\nhorses,\u2019 \u2018the horse in the barn\u2019) is believed to be\nimportant in examining the metaphysical stuff/thing distinction. In\nthis entry we will be more concerned with nominal mass expressions\n(e.g., \u2018the water in the tub\u2019, \u2018the gold in his\nteeth\u2019), as opposed to predicative mass expressions (e.g.,\n\u2018the statue is lead\u2019). While there are many issues in this\narea, we will be focused on the following kind of questions: Are\nthings illusory, the world consisting, most fundamentally, of stuff\nalone? Or is stuff just a certain kind of thing or things? Is all\napparent talk about physical kinds of stuff really veiled talk about\nindividual concrete portions of matter, or is matter per se\nan irreducible part of the furniture of the world?\n\nThe present essay articulates the foregoing questions, and surveys\nvarious answers to them.\n\nIn\n Section 1\n we will explore the metaphysical distinction between stuff and\nthings, and examine the linguistic data used to make the\nmass-noun/count-noun distinction, and show how it has been used to\nmotivate the metaphysical distinction. In\n Sections 2\n and\n 3,\n we will survey different answers to our main target question:\n\u201cwhat do nominal mass expressions refer to?\u201d Lastly, after\nexamining the linguistic data and the metaphysical theories, in\n Section 4\n we will examine whether the metaphysical stuff/thing distinction is\nwell-motivated by the linguistic mass/count distinction, and whether\nthe latter is up to the tasks assigned to it by\nmetaphysicians.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n1.1 \u2018Thing Theory\u2019\n\nThe relatively orthodox reactions to \u2018stuff\u2019 (or\n\u2018matter\u2019) as opposed to \u2018things\u2019 in\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics is to either ignore stuff, reduce\nstuff to things, or eliminate stuff from one\u2019s ontology. These\nreactions are required by the previous embrace of what we could call\n\u2018Thing Theory.\u2019 Thing Theory, very roughly, is the view\nthat (excluding properties and\n relations)[1],\n all concrete existents are either things fundamentally, or reducible\nto fundamental things.\n\nPeter Strawson, in his influential Individuals claims\n\u201cAnything whatever can be introduced into discussion by means of\na singular, definitely identifying substantival expression \u2026\nanything whatever can be identifyingly referred to \u2026 Anything\nwhatever can appear as a logical subject, an\n \u201cindividual.\u2019\u201d[2]\n\nIn Quine\u2019s influential Word and Object he speaks about\n\u201climning the true and ultimate structure of reality,\u201d\n(1960, 221) and according to him, for an object to exist is for it to\nbe necessarily quantified over in an idealized and regimented logical\nlanguage used to truly and comprehensively describe the world. And he\nclaims that the values of the variables of such a theory will only\nrange over sets and physical objects, so \u201cas far as he is\nconcerned \u2026 only physical objects and sets really exist,\u201d\nand, it must be noted, both objects and sets, even if the latter are\nabstract, are all regarded as \u2018things\u2019 or\n \u2018objects\u2019[3]\n\nAnd, from a recent abstract of a book chapter, we have the terse\n\u201cthe world is a world of objects\u201d (Heil 2003, Ch. 15).\nThis family of views goes back to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\nZeta and the Categories. (See the section on\n substance, matter, and subject in the entry on Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics\n for details.)\n\nBut if the world is a world of things, what are they in general? What\nthings, individuals, or objects are is itself a controversial and\nmurky matter, and goes beyond the purview of this article (for more,\nsee these related entries:\n object,\n ordinary objects,\n sortals,\n substance). Related terms in philosophy for \u2018thing\u2019 are\n substance,[4]\nprimary substance, particular, concrete\nparticular, existent, being, entity,\nsubstratum, term, and so on. For the purposes of\nthis entry, we will take a rather minimalistic view of thinghood. We\nwill regard a thing or object as whatever satisfies this\ndefinition:\n\n(Thinghood) x is a thing or object\nif and only if:\n\n\nx falls under some F, and F is\nsingular. [Furthermore, the plural \u201cthe Fs\u201d is\nwell-formed and does not refer to kinds (e.g., in \u2018the wines of\nFrance\u2019).]\nx can be unqualifiedly counted as one. [i.e.,\nx can take \u2018one\u2019 as an unqualified numerical\ndeterminer, without recourse to measurement, \u2018packaging\u2019,\nor partitive phrases (e.g., \u2018one dog\u2019, versus \u2018one\ngallon of water\u2019 or \u2018one water molecule\u2019).] (See\nLaycock 2006, chapter 2)\nx is concrete (i.e., x is not a universal,\nproperty, relation, or abstract entity).\n\n\n\nAnd now, using the notion of Thinghood, a minimalist Thing Theory can\nbe captured as follows:\n\n(TT)\nWhatever exists is a thing, or is reducible to a thing or\nthings.\n\n\nThing theorists hold that whatever exists is unqualifiedly countable\nas one, or reducible to such things. For the Thing Theorist \u201cto\nbe is to be countable.\u201d Some Stuff Ontologists would\ncounter\u2014\u201cto be is to be either countable or\nmeasurable\u201d (a gloss on Burge 1975, p.\u2009459).\n\nAll three Thing-Theoretic views in section\n 2\n maintain that, fundamentally, it all boils down to things.\n\u2018Matter\u2019 always refers to parcels (or \u2018sums\u2019)\nof matter, and parcels are always particular things, which can even be\ncounted in principle. (If there are n simple and discrete\nfundamental things across all of space-time, then there are at most\n(2n \u2212 1) things total in the cosmos).\nMasses-as-sets can always be held to be sets of things, and plural\nreference can always be held to be reference to a number of\nthings.\n\nWe can view \u2018Stuff Ontologies\u2019 as views which, in some\nsense, depart from this picture and \u2018take stuff\nseriously.\u2019 That is, a Stuff Ontology is any view which departs\nfrom Thing Theory in important respects so as to allow non-thing-like\nstuff to be part of the fundamental furniture of the world, whereas\nThing Theorists believe that stuff-talk modeled on mass term use has\nno proper place in the fundamental correct description of the\nworld.\n\nStuff Ontologists can either (i) eliminate things, (ii) accept that\nthere are things, but hold that they are merely derivative entities\nwhich are parasitic on the fundamental stuff of the world, or (iii)\nhold that both stuff and things are fundamental, and are\n inter-irreducible.[5]\n1.2 Stuff, Things, Fundamentality and Reduction\n\nThese debates are motivated by not just the linguistic data covered\nbelow, but by conflicting intuitions about the relation between\nobjects and their constituting matter. (See the entry on\n material constitution\n for more details.) Many make a strong case for an ontological\ndistinction between stuff (or matter) and things. Here are some\ntypical reasons given to believe in the distinction:\n\nSome stuff often has a different history than an object which it\nconstitutes. Invariably, the water that makes up a snowball pre-dates\nthe snowball.\nThe persistence of an object (e.g., a desk) is sensitive to the\ncontiguity of its parts. Some stuff (e.g., the wood), however, can\nsurvive many instances of spatial scatter.\nStuffs are cumulative, objects are not (Burge 1977,\np.\u2009104). For instance, any two portions of water, considered\ntogether, make up a portion of water that contains the first two\nportions as parts. But objects are not like this, e.g., two cars or\ncats do not make up a car or cat.\nStuffs are dissective, objects are not (Burge 1977, p.\u2009106)\nDivide up a (macroscopic) portion of water in half and you will be\nleft with water. Divide a flower in half, and you won\u2019t be left\nwith\n flowers.[6]\nExtended simple objects with no parts are possible. While there\nare no objects or things making up such objects, there is nevertheless\nstuff composing it. The parts do not pre-date the division of an\nextended simple, whereas the stuff does (Markosian 1998a; Scala\n2002).\n\n\nBut, if stuff and things are distinct, they must be intimately\nrelated. It is tempting to philosophers to try to reduce or eliminate\none of the categories and hold that only one category is\nfundamental (or \u2018ontologically basic,\u2019 i.e., it\nmust be mentioned in any true, comprehensive, and non-redundant\ndescription of the world).\n\nReflection can lead us to believe that a familiar object, such as a\ntree, is nothing more than some stuff in a certain arrangement. This\nstuff could have been in a different arrangement, possibly\nconstituting two smaller trees, or perhaps nothing at all. This raises\nthe possibility that stuff is more fundamental than things.\n\nBut, when we look closely at stuff, or listen to scientists, we see\nthat it is likely particulate, and, if particles are objects, then it\nappears that stuff is actually not fundamental after all\u2014objects\nare. Prima facie these positions cannot both be true, and our\nconflicting intuitions call for an explanation as to the relation\nbetween stuff and things.\n\nWhat are we talking about when we talk about stuff? We will first look\nat the three main answers given in\n section 2.\n The first answer, by far the most popular (and consequently receiving\nthe most attention), is that stuff-talk is talk about masses of\nparticles or molecules. The second is that stuff-talk is talk about\nsets, and, lastly, that it is talk about many things (or\n\u2018pluralities\u2019). The views in\n section 2,\n in one way or another, hold that stuff is very thing-like or\nreducible to things.\n\nIn\n section 3\n we will examine more radical views which say that the moral to draw\nfrom reflection upon concrete mass expressions, among other things, is\nthat the world consists of stuff, not things; or stuff in\naddition to things, where the former is not thing-like.\n1.3 Mass and Count Nouns; Mass and Count Expressions\n\nThe most common entry-point for thinking that there may be a\nmetaphysical difference between stuff and things is by noting that\nwhile common things, such as dogs and rocks, can be unqualifiedly\ncounted, there are also stuffs, such as water and air, which cannot be\nunqualifiedly counted. But the entry point can be even more\nrudimentary, possibly pre-linguistic. As Burge (1975, 199) notes,\n\u201cfrom early childhood we learn to distinguish compact, enduring\nthings from the stuffs of which they are consituted. We count the\nformer and measure the latter. We treat things as stable points of\nreference \u2026 stuffs we think of as amorphous and protean.\u201d\nPhilosophers and linguists have often latched onto this distinction by\nnoting the difference between what are called \u2018mass\nterms/nouns\u2019 and \u2018count terms/nouns.\u2019 Burge goes on,\n\u201cMass terms are typically used to measure the masses\u2014count\nnouns, to number the multitudes\u201d (1975, 199).\n\nBut what distinguishes mass from count nouns? In order to answer this,\nit will be helpful if some preliminary conventions and issues are\nexplained or noted, even if only to sidestep them in order to make the\nfocus of this entry clear.\n\nWhile this entry is about mass and count expressions, the\nliterature has typically focused instead on what are called mass and\ncount nouns. Mass nouns include nitrogen,\nporridge, trash, china, traffic,\ndata, shade, music, pain, and\nfurniture. Count nouns include horse,\nfuton, army, codicil, proposition,\nand galaxy. It should be noted from the outset that the\nrelation between the mass/count distinction and the stuff/thing\ndistinction across all metaphysical categories is not straightforward,\nas there are so many different kinds of entities (e.g., events,\nconcreta, sets, processes, absences, conventional entities, etc.)\nreferred to by both mass and count expressions.\n\nThere is debate about whether nouns as such are count or\nmass, as opposed to\n expressions.[7]\nMass expression is a broader class than mass noun,\nsince the former includes instances of the latter, as well as phrases\nsuch as \u2018the water in the tub\u2019, \u2018the gold in\nFrance,\u2019 and \u2018the grape juice Roderick drank.\u2019 In\ncomparison, \u2018Robert\u2019s car\u2019, \u2018John\u2019s\nstudent,\u2019 and \u2018a NATO signatory\u2019 are count\nexpressions. But, while there is debate about whether nouns are count\nor mass, no one denies that expressions can be count or mass (a single\nword representing the limiting case). This is one reason our emphasis\nis on \u2018expressions.\u2019\n\nThere is a further preliminary issue, orthogonal to our discussion,\nabout whether expression-types or\nexpression-instances are what are primarily mass or count.\nMany hold that mass expressions are ambiguous between mass or count\nsenses depending upon context (e.g., \u2018Mary had a little\nlamb\u2019 could mean she owned one, or ate some (Quine 1960,\np.\u200991)). This question, and the former, can be side-stepped by\nstipulating, in what follows, that the phrases \u2018mass\nnouns,\u2019 \u2018mass terms,\u2019 and \u2018mass\nexpressions\u2019 will mean \u201cnoun/term/expression occurrences\nemployed with a mass\n sense.\u201d[8]\n\nFollowing common usage (cf Pelletier & Schubert 1989), we\nwill occasionally label linguistic items with mass features by\n\u2018+MASS\u2019, and those without by\n\u2018-MASS\u2019, and those with count features by\n\u2018+COUNT\u2019 and without by\n\u2018-COUNT.\u2019 As will become clear, an\nexpression\u2019s being mass or count are not always mutually\nexclusive, and neither is the distinction exhaustive. There are indeed\ncases of +MASS/+COUNT (e.g.\n\u2018hair\u2019, \u2018fish\u2019), or\n-MASS/-COUNT (e.g.\n\u2018fireworks\u2019)). This ends the preliminaries.\n\nThe following are commonly employed syntactic and lexical distinctions\nbetween mass and count nouns. Mass and count nouns act differently in\nrelation to quantifiers and non-logical determiners. Count nouns, but\nnot mass nouns (when not used in the kind sense), can be prefaced by\n\u2018each\u2019, \u2018every\u2019, \u2018few\u2019,\n\u2018fewer\u2019, \u2018many\u2019, and \u2018a\u2019. Mass\nnouns, but not count nouns, can be prefaced by \u2018much\u2019,\n\u2018little\u2019, \u2018a lot of\u2019, \u2018less\u2019,\n\u2018more\u2019, \u2018a quantity of\u2019, and so on. Both mass\nand count nouns take \u2018most\u2019, \u2018all\u2019,\n\u2018some\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018none of the\u2019,\n\u2018any\u2019, \u2018hardly any\u2019, and \u2018a\nlittle\u2019.\n\nOnly count nouns can be prefaced unqualifiedly by numerals or the\nindefinite article, and be pluralized without a category shift. When\nwe switch from speaking of \u2018a horse\u2019 to \u2018five\nhorses\u2019 we have not switched from speaking of things to speaking\nof kinds of things. However, when we switch from speaking of\n\u2018wine\u2019 to \u2018a wine\u2019 or \u2018seven\nwines\u2019, we usually switch from speaking about wine\n(+MASS/-COUNT) to either portions of it\n(-MASS/+COUNT), or to kinds of\nwine (-MASS/+COUNT) (Pelletier 1974).\n(Compare \u2018The wine is over there\u2019 to \u2018Gallo sells\nseven wines.\u2019) While we do say things like \u201cWe\u2019ll\nhave six beers,\u201d or \u201cI need five milks for the\nchildren,\u201d these are understood, depending on context, as\nshorthand for \u2018six bottles/kegs of beer,\u2019 or \u2018six\ncartons/pints of milk\u2019 (Higginbotham 1995, Pelletier 1979 pp.\n2\u20134, 2012). If you pour some wine on the floor you cannot, if\ngrammar is your guide, count the number of \u2018wines\u2019\n(+MASS/-COUNT) (in the non-kind sense)\non the floor. There are no things (or at least no commonsense things,\nby which we individuate and track persistence) which are wines, such\nthat there are a number of them on the floor. Even if there were, say,\nseven pools (or droplets, puddles, etc.) on the floor, we think the\nsame wine remains on the floor even if the pools cease to be, e.g. if\nthey are merged or further divided.\n\nWhile mass nouns do not admit the indefinite article, they admit a use\nof \u2018some\u2019 which acts like an indefinite article\n(Cartwright 1965). We can say, for example, \u201cAdam drank some\nwater which is worse than Onondaga Lake water,\u201d or,\n\u201cHeraclitus bathed in some water yesterday and bathed in it\nagain today.\u201d (Note the anaphoric use of \u2018it\u2019 in the\nlast sentence, and how it does not necessarily imply its referent is a\nparticular thing).\n\nBoth count and mass nouns admit the definite article. There are\nsentence forms with a mass noun prefaced by the definite article, such\nas \u201cSocrates drank the hemlock in that cup,\u201d \u201cBob\njust wrote your name in the snow over there.\u201d These sentences,\nif true, will be cases of definite reference of mass expressions, in\nthat they pick out an actual concrete referent. Both mass and count\nnouns admit definite reference. But, it is controversial whether\ndefinite reference to stuff is singular reference.\n\nFor our purposes, it is useful to lay down a limited taxonomy of mass\nnouns, not based on their linguistic, logical, or semantic features,\nbut based upon prima facie salient metaphysical\n criteria.[9]\n Compare the following lists:\n\nConcrete Quasi-Mass Nouns: furniture, silverware, china,\ntrash, clothes\nConcrete Mass Nouns: water, iron, lead, porridge,\nflesh\nAbstract Mass Nouns: information, data, wisdom\nPsychological Mass Nouns: pain, admiration\nQuantitative Mass Nouns: speed, weight, work, mass\n\n\n(a) are definitely mass by the grammatical criteria discussed above,\nand they refer to concrete entities. But, it is hard to see what\nimport they would have for supporting a metaphysics of\n stuff.[10]\n These words are devices for speaking about distinct, discrete objects\nin a collective manner. In certain contexts, we seek to draw attention\nto a bunch of distinct individuals, not as such, but, for pragmatic\nreasons, as an undifferentiated mass or plurality of a certain\nkind.\n\nFew have been led by the use of the words furniture or\nsilverware to conclude that there is a category of stuff or\nmatter which is distinct from things, nor have many others denied that\nthere is such a strong distinction based on the interchangeability of\nphrases like \u2018get your stuff off my desk!\u2019 with \u2018get\nyour things off my desk!\u2019 But, as we will discuss, the apparent\nmetaphysical triviality of category (a) could very well undermine the\ncontention that concrete mass nouns do in fact have metaphysical\nimport, since there is little or no grammatical difference between\nterms in category (a) or\n (b).[11]\n This is discussed more in\n Section 4\n and in\n Supplement: Non-Atomicity and its Relevance to the Mass/Count Distinction.\n\n\u2019Concrete Mass Nouns\u2019 refer to the kinds of entities\ndiscussed most often in the linguistically-informed metaphysics\nliterature. They have also been called \u2018physical stuff-kind\nterms\u2019 (Zimmerman 1995).\n\nAbstract mass nouns, if they do refer, do not, prima facie,\nrefer to physical stuffs or hunks of stuff. And the possibility of\npropositional or \u2018abstract stuff\u2019 strikes many, if it\nstrikes them at all, as dubious\u2014but it is not clear what is\nproblematic about it. (Some work on abstract mass nouns can be found\nin Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Husi\u0107 2020; Hinterwimmer 2020;\nMoltmann 2013, esp. 1.6; Nicolas 2002, 2003, and 2010; and Zamparelli\n2020. See Treanor 2013, esp. p10, for an applied discussion which\nrelates, and see Koslicki 1999, 68\u20139 for a rejection of the\nparallel between some abstract mass nouns and concrete mass nouns).\nMore on abstract mass nouns can be found in\n this section\n of the entry on the Logic of Mass Expressions.\n\nAddressing issues surrounding abstract, psychological, and\nquantitative mass nouns and their referents is beyond the scope of\nthis\n article.[12]\n Due to the almost exclusive emphasis on concrete and quasi-concrete\nmass nouns in the metaphysics literature, this article will follow\nsuit. While an analysis of concrete and quasi-concrete mass\nexpressions could possibly be carried over to generate a\ngeneral metaphysical theory of masses, the prospects for this are dim.\nThis is because, even given the grammatical similarities between all\nmass expressions, there are far too many differences between concrete\nstuff and the entities in categories\n (c)\u2013(e).[13]\n\nIn what follows, both concrete and quasi-concrete mass expressions\nwill be referred to as \u2018concrete mass expressions,\u2019 except\nwhen the distinction is needed. Also, due to our focus, \u2018mass\nexpressions\u2019 henceforth refers only to concrete mass\nexpressions, except where indicated.\n1.4 Some Terminology\n\nMereologies are formal systems, but we will be ignoring technicalities\nin this entry as far as possible (for details, see the entry\n Mereology).\n Still, some terminology is necessary and useful, since we will be\ndiscussing theories which employ mereological notions. Let us take the\nnotion of part as primitive. A \u2018simple\u2019 is a\nnon-composite entity, i.e., something with no\n parts.[14]\n\nA composite thing has more than one part. The verb\nfuse refers to an asymmetric relation between a whole and its\nparts. If two things fuse they \u2018join together\u2019 to make up\na whole. For example, if the water in my glass and the water in your\nglass fuse, then there exists a thing, a fusion, which is\nmade up of the two portions (sometimes it is said that the two\nportions \u2018have a fusion\u2019). No literal contact or fusion\n(e.g., welding two rods together) is implied by this usage. If a fleet\nis a single thing, then it is arguably a fusion of the boats making it\nup. The nouns whole and sum are synonymous with\nfusion and composite. Overlap occurs when\ndistinct things share one or more parts.\n\nIt is also necessary to make the following distinctions, which are not\nstandard to the literature, but are useful for our purposes. Any\nconcrete +MASS or +COUNT kind noun\nK (e.g., \u2018gold\u2019, \u2018lobster,\u2019) will\nfall into one or more of the following categories:\n\nK is an atomic kind iff if something is some\nK, then it is a K-atom, or it is identical with a\nfusion of K-atoms. And, something is a K-atom iff it\nhas no parts which are K.\nK is a non-atomic kind iff any K has\n(proper) parts which are K.\nK is a fuzzy atomless kind iff any K\nhas parts of which it is indeterminate whether they are K\n(i.e., there is no fact of the matter as to what counts as a smallest\nunit of K).\nK is a heterogeneous kind iff any K has\nsome parts which are\nK1\u2026Kn, where\n\u2018K\u2019,\n\u2018K1\u2019\u2026Kn\u2019\nall refer to distinct kinds.\n\n\nElectrons are atomic, since they have no parts which are electrons.\nAlso, if ships have no parts which are ships, then \u2018ship\u2019\nis an atomic kind term as well (Zimmerman 1995, p.\u200975; Sider\n2001). Portions of non-atomic gunk or infinitely divisible\nmatter of a kind K are K through-and-through, as\nwould an infinitely descending chain of \u2018box-particles\u2019,\neach of which contains a box-particle (Gardner 1983, p.\u200926).\nFruit cake is arguably a fuzzy atomless substance, since it can have\nparts (e.g., half a blueberry with some gluten attached) that are not\ndeterminately fruit cake. (cf. Landman 2011 on \u2018mess mass\nnouns\u2019). Some mass terms, e.g., \u2018cutlery\u2019 and\n\u2018gold\u2019 are heterogeneous. While a fork is some cutlery, a\ntine is not, and, presumably, an electron in a gold atom is not gold.\nNot all the categories are mutually exclusive, and the list is not\nintended to be exhaustive for all kind-terms.\n2. Stuff as a Special Kind of Thing or Things\n\nA natural thought to have about sentences with referring nominal\nconcrete mass expressions (e.g., \u201cAlvin drank the water\nthat Roderick poured\u201d or \u201cThe coffee in that cup\nis too hot\u201d) is that the expressions refer to portions of\nmatter, which are themselves made up of smaller bits of matter. It\nseems obvious that thinking this is what taking such\nsentences at face value amounts to. Not obvious, though, is what\nmetaphysical commitments this requires, and what metaphysical problems\nmight come along with this thought.\n\nA general consensus has been reached that it is helpful to think\nthrough these issues about matter within the framework of\nmereology, or the logic of parts and wholes, even though there is much\ndisagreement about what the correct mereology is.\n2.1 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Mereological Sums\n\nIn the various sum-theoretical analyses of mass expressions\n(Cartwright 1965, 1979b; Burge 1977; Moravcsik 1973), all mass\nexpressions with their non-count features disappear upon analysis and\nare replaced by talk of sums.\n\nThese accounts can get quite technical, but the basic idea is\nrelatively easy to understand. Since, on these accounts, concrete mass\nexpressions refer to mereological sums, a sentence such as \u201cSnow\nis white\u201d is understood to mean that there is a sum of all the\nsnow (flakes, bits, balls, etc.), and that this sum is part of the\nfusion of all the white things (Quine 1960, ch. 20). A sentence such\nas \u201cThe water is in the tub\u201d gets cashed out to mean that\nthere is a fusion of water molecules which is in the tub. While there\nare many permutations on this strategy, sum theorists will, whenever\npossible, paraphrase away talk of stuffs and talk instead of sums,\nwhere sums satisfy the constraints of Thinghood and do not\ncontradict Thing Theory (TT) as outlined in\n 1.1.\n\nThere are many possible positions for those who wish to analyze mass\nexpressions in terms of sums. What follows is a short survey of some\nof the most salient decision points one must confront in constructing\na detailed view of this kind, and what problems emerge from deciding\none way or another.\n2.1.1 Which Sums of Stuff Are There?\n\nIn the literature on material objects, an oft-discussed question is:\nwhen do two or more things compose a further thing (van Inwagen 1990)?\nSome common answers are\u2014never (Compositional\nNihilism\u2014Unger 1979, Dorr and Rosen 2002); always\n(Mereological Universalism\u2014Lewis 1986, pp.\u2009212\u2013213;\nRea 1998); only when they form a life (Organicism\u2014van\nInwagen 1990; Merricks 2001); whenever the candidate fusion has\nnon-redundant causal powers (Merricks 2001); whenever (and\nonly whenever) we intuitively think they do\n(Intuitivism\u2014Commonsense); or that composition is a brute\nfact (Brutalism\u2014Markosian 1998b). And the answers have\n proliferated.[15]\n\nThe most commonly held view is Mereological Universalism, or\n\u2018Unrestricted Mereology\u2019 (\u2018UM\u2019 for short). Two\nor more things always have a fusion. For example, the Empire State\nBuilding and the Dalai Lama compose an object.\n\nThe debates about composition largely focus on the fusion of\nobjects\u2014but what of matter? A strong case can be made for what\nwe could call the Unrestricted Fusion of Matter principle:\n\n(UFM):\nIf there is some matter and some distinct matter, then there is a\nsum of all of it. (cf. Markosian 2004, p.\u2009410)\n\n\nThere are several ways to argue for this. Here\u2019s one:\n\nFor any two masses of stuff K, they compose a further\nmass of K. (Summativity)\nMatter is the most general material stuff kind.\n(Generality)\nSo, any two or more masses of matter whatsoever compose a mass of\nmatter. (cf. Zimmerman 1995, section 5, Tanksley 2010)\n\n\nSummativity is a plausible principle. We believe that we\nrefer when we say things like \u2018the water in your bottle\u2019.\nNow, if you keep half of the water in your bottle, and pour half in\nLarry\u2019s empty bottle, and Larry drives off with his bottle, does\nthe water still exist? Supposing that none of the water is destroyed,\nthe answer seems to be clearly\n \u2018yes\u2019.[16]\n\nNow, if this is so, and some water can exist while being spread out,\nwhy suppose that that very same water came into existence only when\npoured into your cup (from, say, two bottles)? It seems like it could\ncome into existence when joined only if it went out of existence when\nscattered. But it didn\u2019t go out of existence when\nscattered\u2014so it couldn\u2019t have come into existence when\njoined. So, there always was this water fusion (at least as long as\nall the sub-portions of water existed). We can repeat the same\nargument for the copper in two distinct statues. There will also be\nthe sum of the gold in Sweden and the lead in Tanzania, if we can\nreplace the K in Summativity with \u2018metal\u2019.\n\nAnd it also seems true that matter is a genuine kind term,\nand the most general one there is for concrete stuffs. If it\nwasn\u2019t, it is hard to see how scientists could speak, as they\ndo, about universal properties of matter, or what kinds of matter\nthere are, or how philosophers could contrast matter with allegedly\nnon-physical minds, abstract objects, and so forth.\n\nSo, it seems that any two portions of matter whatsoever have a fusion.\nAccepting this result leads to acceptance of \u2018Mere\nSums,\u2019 i.e.,\n\n\u2018Mere Sum\u2019: A composite object whose only existence\ncondition is the existence of its (fundamental) parts, and only\npersistence condition is the persistence of all of the same ultimate\nparts. A mere sum\u2019s parts need not be cohesive, spatially close,\nor exhibit any kind of functional unity, and the sum need not be\nsolid, macroscopic, or fall under any commonsense or scientific kind\nterm. Even if it does have these features, they are inessential to its\n existence.[17]\n\n\nIt has proven extremely tempting to identify matter with Mere Sums\n(and their ultimate parts) in the mereologist\u2019s sense, which\nunrestricted mereology holds of, for the reasons just\n outlined.[18]\n\nOf course, if sums are object-like, and one has reason to believe that\nthe only objects are ones with structured essences, then one would\nhave reason to reject Summativity and UFM which lead to the posit of\nunstructured Mere Sums. (Generality seems harder to reject). Arguments\nagainst these principles can be found in sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3.1.\n (See also Laycock 1972, pp.\u20094\u20135; 2006a, Appendix\nIII).\n2.1.2 Can Sums Change Their Parts?\n\nAnother crucial decision point in developing a sum theory of the\nreferents of mass expressions is deciding whether the elements in the\nsum (e.g., the H2O molecules in some water, the gold atoms\nin some gold) are essential to the sum. The case of the most general\nkind, masses of matter, is a particularly important instance\nof this question.\n\nIt seems intuitively obvious that when one takes a sip of water, or\nadds a bit of water to a glass of water, that one does not have in the\nglass precisely the same water both before and after. Even if the same\namount of water from a different batch replaces the water\nwhich was taken away, we still would not have the same exact water\nbefore us after the replacement. And, if we perform electrolysis on a\nbatch of water but preserve any matter from being lost we can rightly\nsay we have all the same matter as we did before, just not the same\nwater, since there is none. We can construct similar examples for any\ntype of matter. What can explain and unify these obvious intuitions is\nthat there is a most general category of entity\u2014masses of\nmatter, where all the fundamental parts of any\nmass are essential to it. Such masses of matter cannot change parts\nwhatsoever.\n\nThe existence of entities like this could easily explain why there is\nnot precisely the same water through these changes. An unqualified\nview of this kind would be that nothing whatsoever can change\nparts\u2014this is called \u2018Mereological Essentialism.\u2019\nMore restricted views hold that at the very least masses of matter\ncannot change parts. Mereological essentialism has been an extremely\npopular approach throughout history. (Abelard, Reid, Bishop Butler,\nLocke, Hume, and Leibniz were all mereological essentialists of some\nkind.)\n\nThere is much to say in favor of the following principle of\nMereological Essentialism for Masses (of matter) in general (for early\ndiscussion of Mereological Essentialism under that name, see Chisholm\n1973, 1975; Plantinga 1975):\n\n(MEM)\nFor any mass of matter M and any mass of matter\nx, if x is ever a part of M, M\nwill exist only when x exists and is a part of\nM.\n\n\nWe can argue for a principle like this by first stating that masses of\nmatter at a time are individuated by having the same parts, and then\narguing that no mass can change parts over time.\n\nOur more restricted \u2018Mereological Essentialism for Masses\u2019\n(MEM) seems prima facie consistent with allowing ordinary\nobjects to change parts. MEM seems less controversial than\n\u2018Mereological Essentialism for Objects\u2019 (MEO). MEM seems\nlike something of a truism, and perhaps part of the nature of the\ncategory of matter. But let us turn to an argument for MEM on the\nassumption that there are Mere Sums.\n\nAt a time, it is easy to distinguish and identify masses,\nwhich in this context are considered Mere Sums. Assume a toy model of\na world with only 20 simples, each given a unique number from\n1\u201320 as a name. By UFM, 1\u20134 will fuse at \\(t_1.\\) Let us\ncall that sum \u2018Quadri.\u2019 Quadri will be distinct from any\nsums with distinct parts, since no sum can have different parts from\nitself at a time. Will Quadri be identical with anything\n\u2018else\u2019 composed of the same fundamental parts? Suppose 1\nis an electron, and 2\u20134 are quarks. Suppose 1\u20134 compose a\nhydrogen atom at \\(t_1.\\) Call the atom \u2018Hydro\u2019. By the\ndefinition of Mere Sums, Quadri\u2019s parts\u2019 proximity to each\nother is irrelevant to its persisting, but not so for Hydro, which, if\nit loses its electron, will cease to exist as hydrogen. (The lone\nproton is a cation of the hydron variety). So Hydro cannot be a Mere\nSum. The same will go for any putative object composed of\n1\u20134 which do not have the same persistence conditions as Quadri.\nAnd so any fusion resulting in a Mere Sum of 1\u20134 is\nQuadri; and 1\u20134 compose no other Mere Sums than Quadri. And so\nsomething is Quadri at \\(t_1\\) if and only if it has all and only\n1\u20134 as parts at that time. And so all those parts are essential\nto it at that\n time.[19]\n\nOne can make a further case that sums\u2019 parts are essential to\nthem over time. Suppose that simples 1\u20139 exist at\n\\(t_1.\\) Assuming UFM, then 1\u20139 fuse to give us the sum \\(S\\).\nAt \\(t_1,\\) also by UFM, there is the fusion of 1\u20138, which we\ncan call S\u2212. Since S\u2212 and S\nhave different parts, by\n Leibniz\u2019s Law,\n they are distinct. If a sum could lose a part and persist, then it\ncould be possible for the fusion S to come to be made up of\ndifferent parts. Suppose that only part 9 is destroyed. If MEM is\nfalse, then S could come to be composed of exactly what\nS\u2212 is. So, if MEM is false, either (i) S became\nS\u2212, (ii) S\u2212 went\nout of existence, or (iii)\nS and S\u2212 coincide as distinct sums. But, (i)\ncannot be true: two things cannot become one (although this has been\nchallenged, see Gallois 1998); (ii) cannot be true\u2014how can a\nmere mass of matter go out of existence without undergoing any\nintrinsic change? (for challenges to this see Burke 1994, Markosian\n1998a and 2004); (iii) violates a very clear intuition\u2014if you\nhave some stuff, and take some of it away, then you do not have the\nvery same stuff (cf. Jubien 1993 pp. 18\u201319). So (iii) is false.\nBut then all of (i)\u2013(iii) are false. And so MEM is true. (For\nanother challenge to an argument like the foregoing, see van Inwagen\n2009.)\n\nSo, if there can be mere sums, and UFM is true, then we ought\nto believe in MEM, even if we do not accept MEO. (Arguments against\nMEM can be found in the supplement\n Challenges to Mereological Essentialism for Masses\n and arguments against UFM in section\n 3.1.)\n2.1.3 How do Sums of Stuff Relate to Ordinary Objects?\n\nOf course, if ordinary objects can change parts, but sums can not,\nthen it seems that ordinary objects are not mereological sums. But\nthen, what are they, and how do they relate to the sums which\nobviously seem to constitute them?\n\nIf one is serious about the existence of sums of matter, it seems\nthere are only a few ways they could relate to ordinary\n objects.[20]\n One way is to say that sums constitute ordinary objects by\ncoinciding with them. That is, sums are distinct objects\nwhich share all of their parts with the commonsense objects they make\nup. One could also eliminate ordinary objects. Ordinary\nobjects either do not exist, or exist in some kind of shadowy or\nderivative sense (think of \u2018the average man\u2019). Another way\nis to say that while sums are in fact things or objects, ordinary\nobjects are a different kind of entity. These dual-category\nviews hold that commonsense objects are in a different ontological\ncategory than sums.\n\nThose who wish to explore in more detail the metaphysics of masses,\nordinary objects, and their relations, can read the supplement on\n Sums and Ordinary Objects.\n2.1.4 Are Sums of Stuff Non-Atomic?\n\nGodehard Link and Harry Bunt have argued that the best models of\nnatural language use of mass expressions will distinguish mass\nentities from count by treating the former as if they are non-atomic,\nwhether or not they actually are. Godehard Link (1998) argues that the\nreference of mass expressions is best understood via the development\nof a rich model-theoretic semantics, which algebraically models the\ninterrelated network of talk of mass, plural, and particular entities.\nHarry Bunt (1985) subsumes both set theory and mereology into an\naxiomatic system called \u201cEnsemble Theory\u201d in order to\nmodel the structure of talk about mass expressions. Link\u2019s\naccount in particular embraces coincidence on a massive scale.\n\nSince Link and Bunt\u2019s views are put forward in a relatively\nmetaphysically neutral way, we will relegate more information about\nthese views to an appendix. But, if the modeling they propose handles\nthe linguistic data better than other views then that will give\nfurther support to a theory which embraces both coincidence and\ninfinite divisibility. Hence these treatments are ontologically\nrelevant. Examining Link\u2019s theory in some detail can show us\njust how far distinguishing mass- and count- via the atomic/non-atomic\ndistinction can take us, and what it can\u2019t do for us. See the\nsupplement\n Non-Atomicity and the Mass/Count Distinction\n for details.\n2.2 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Sets\n\nA slightly less popular way to answer our question is to treat mass\nexpressions as referring to sets. For instance, suppose there\u2019s\nsome wine on the floor. Roughly, according to the masses-as-sets\ntheorist, this is equivalent to there being a set of wine bits\n(whatever they are) on the floor. If Nancy\u2019s ring is gold, then\nthere is a set of gold molecules which compose or constitute the ring.\nIf \u2018the gold\u2019 is identified with a set, then some problems\nfaced by the mereologists are avoided. While a mereologist who is\ncommitted to the existence of the mass of gold is under pressure to\ndeny the existence of the ring if she wants to avoid coincidence, the\nmasses-as-sets theorist has a great advantage in that she can say that\nboth the ring and gold exist but are not coinciding material things,\nsince the gold, unlike the ring, is a set and not an object.\n\nThe masses-as-sets theorist reduces mass expressions to count\nexpressions, by treating concrete mass expressions (e.g., \u2018the\ngold\u2019) as veiled count-expressions (e.g., \u2018the set of gold\natoms\u2019).\n\nOne stark problem for the masses-as-sets view (henceforth we will\nidentify a proponent of this view as a \u2018set theorist,\u2019\nignoring its more general meaning), is that it identifies\nparadigmatically concrete stuffs with what are usually regarded as\nparadigmatically abstract objects\u2014sets. How could some gold be a\nset? Suppose we can pick out a definite portion of gold which makes up\na ring. If sets are abstract, then the set theorist must say that the\ngold is abstract. This is pretty hard to swallow. Abstract things are\nnot in time or space, but gold is. Also, sets are not identical to\ntheir members. But the gold in the ring does seem identical\nto the members of the set of gold atoms, not the set itself.\n(Regarding issues of \u2018many-one identity\u2019, see Baxter 1988,\nWallace 2011a,b, and see\n section 8 of the entry on identity).\n\nPerhaps the set theorist can instead maintain that masses are sets,\nbut deny that sets (or at least sets of bits of matter) are abstract.\nA set theorist might maintain that sets of physical objects (such as\ngold atoms) can be said to be in space in virtue of their members\nbeing in space. The gold, construed as a set of gold atoms, can be\nsaid to weigh ten ounces in virtue of its members collectively\nweighing ten ounces. On this kind of view, massy sets have their\nphysical properties \u2018by proxy\u2019 (Zimmerman 1995, sections 3\nand 9).\n\nBut, when we try to unpack exactly in which sense the set of gold\natoms is non-abstract, we can see that it is hard to distinguish the\nmasses-as-sets view from the plurals approach which we will examine\nbelow. The non-abstract set theorist will hold that a set of gold\natoms can in fact have physical properties, in virtue of the\nproperties of its members. So, a non-abstract set theorist would first\nparaphrase \u201cthe gold weighs ten ounces\u201d into \u201cthat\nset of gold atoms weighs ten ounces.\u201d But, in order to explain\nhow a set weighs ten ounces, they would have to again paraphrase and\nanalyze the latter as something like \u201cthe set\u2019s\nmembers collectively weigh ten ounces.\u201d But if the set\ntheorist has to paraphrase their paraphrase, then there is\nconsiderable pressure for the set theorist to instead switch over to\nthe stuff-as-plurals view (section\n 2.3)\n and just talk directly about the members. If we are just talking\nabout the members, or the gold atoms, and we can say what we want\nabout many things without talking about the set of those many things,\nthen why complicate matters by introducing sets?\n\nThere are some problems for the set-theoretic paraphrase. Suppose one\ntruly says \u201cthe melted sugar here is the same sugar that was in\nthe packet.\u201d If \u2018sugar\u2019 in this context referred to\nthe various lumps and grains of sugar in a packet, then, if there are\nno more lumps or grains after the melting, then the set-equality, and\nhence the identity-claim, comes out false. As Pelletier points out,\nwhen we identify some stuff, there are many different individuating\nstandards available (e.g., \u2018packets of ___\u2019,\n\u2018bottles of ___\u2019, \u2018granules of ___\u2019), and\ndifferent divisions will yield different sets (1974, p.\u200994).\nThis ends up either under-determining which identities hold, or,\nabsurdly, entailing that some stuff is distinct from itself.\n\nIn addition, set theorists usually formulate their theory in terms\nassuming atomism, yet it seems possible that there is gunky non-atomic\nstuff (Zimmerman 1995, \u00a79, 1996b; Sider 1993). If there are, or\ncould be, stuffs like this, then standard set-theoretic treatments\nwill not work, since such theories require all sets to be\nwell-founded. Another problem is that for some stuffs it is (or seems\nto be) indeterminate what, if anything, will count as a smallest unit\nof it\u2014e.g., minestrone soup or beer. So, the set theorist has a\nproblem with non-atomic or fuzzy atomless stuffs (see\n 1.4\n for terminology). In what immediately follows, we will only discuss\nthe issue of non-atomicity.\n\nSuppose there is a cube of completely homogenous and gunky jello on\nthe table, with no empty space inside. Suppose that the cube\ncan\u2019t survive being sliced or having its parts scattered.\nSuppose that the jello composing the cube is a fundamental stuff-kind.\nOn the set-theoretic proposal, to say that the jello constitutes the\ncube is to say that a set of jello-individuals constitutes the cube.\nWhich individuals? One non-option is the set {cube}, for then the\njello would be identical with the cube, and could not undergo any\nchanges which the cube could not. So, the set must include at least\ntwo jello individuals. Suppose that the set\u2019s members are the\nleft and right halves of the jello\u2014call them \u2018Lefty\u2019\nand \u2018Righty\u2019. So, saying that the jello constitutes the\ncube is to say that {Lefty, Righty} constitute the cube. But, of\ncourse, there is also the set of Lefty\u2019s left half, right half,\nand Righty\u2019s left and right halves. This set, {Lefty\u2019s\nleft half, Lefty\u2019s right half, Righty\u2019s left half,\nRighty\u2019s right half}, is a better candidate to identify with the\njello stuff, since it will survive if cut into four pieces the right\nway, whereas {Lefty, Righty} will not. We want to pick out the set of\njello-individuals which can survive any kind of scattering. But, the\nproblem, of course, is that Lefty\u2019s left half is composed of\nLefty\u2019s left half\u2019s left half, and so on. Since the\npostulation of gunk rules out employing a set of point-particles,\nthere appears to be no set of jello-individuals that we can\nidentify the jello stuff with which can serve to pick out all the\njello stuff and account for the persistence conditions of the\nstuff (=set) in the right way. So, there is absolutely\nnothing which is the set of individuals which make\nup the cube. If we wish to identify the jello stuff with every set\nthat is some of it, since the members of every set are themselves\ncomposed of further sets, then it is sets \u2018all the way\ndown\u2019, where we never arrive at members which are not composed\nof further members of sets of stuff. Dean Zimmerman notes,\n\nThe mere thought of these \u201cnon-well-founded\u201d sets is\nenough to induce vertigo. How could something as concrete and physical\nas a mass of matter be made of nothing but sets of sets of\nsets\u2026ad infinitum? (1995, p.\u200999, italics his)\n\n\nFor masses of stuff composed of simples, however, the procedure is\nrelatively simple\u2014\u201cwhenever you have a larger mass\ncompounded out of smaller masses of the same kind, identify the larger\nmass with a set of these smaller masses.\u201d There is no way to do\nthis with gunky masses, since, for any arbitrarily chosen constituting\nindividual, it itself is a constituted object that needs to have the\nsame treatment applied to it.\n\nThe set-theoretical interpretation has many difficulties, and few\nchampions. But, this should not be regarded as the last word on the\nsubject. There are non-well-founded set theories, which could perhaps\nget around the foregoing difficulties.\n2.3 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Many Things, Not One Thing: Pluralities and Plural Reference\n\nWe do not only speak of individual things, we speak of many things.\nSentences such as \u201cThe cheerleaders formed a human\npyramid,\u201d or \u201cThose dogs are sick\u201d are examples of\nplural predication, quantification, and reference. Some hold that some\nplural referring expressions are irreducible to singular predication,\nquantification, and reference (Boolos 1984; McKay 2005; Yi 2005).\nAccording to standard logic, \u201csome things are F\u201d\nis true only if each of those things is F. But, as McKay and\nothers point out, \u201cThe students surrounded the building\u201d\ncould be true even though it is false to say of Bob (one of the\nstudents) that he surrounded the building (McKay 2005, chapter 1).\nThose in favor of plural logic argue that we need not countenance sums\nor sets to account for plural logic, rather, we can take such\nsentences at face value. Those tigers may be distinct from those\nlions, but this doesn\u2019t require \u2018the tigers\u2019 to\nrefer to a collection, sum, or particular thing of any stripe.\n\nSome \u2018pluralists\u2019, as we may call those who analyze mass\nexpressions in terms of plural expressions, hold that mass terms are\nused, generally, to refer to many things at once (Nicolas 2002).\n\u2018Gold\u2019, on most occasions of use, does not refer to a\nthing\u2014it refers to many things.\n\nAccording to an early account (Laycock 1975) statements such as\n\u201cthe water is boiling\u201d or \u201cBob took out that\ntrash\u201d mean \u201cthose water molecules are\nboiling\u201d and \u201cBob took out those pieces of\ntrash.\u201d The idea (also developed more fully later by Nicolas\n2008, who, in turn, was inspired by Gillon 1992) that mass expressions\nare used to refer to several things at once seems especially promising\nfor concrete quasi-mass nouns such as silverware and\nfurniture, whose reference is particular pieces of silverware\nor furniture. Concrete mass nouns such as beer will be\nparaphrased as referring, depending on context, to bottles, drops,\nglasses, gallons, or quantities (in Cartwright\u2019s 1979b sense) of\nbeer.\n\nPluralists about mass expressions differ most markedly from sum and\nset theorists as follows. The set theorist would take \u2018the water\nin Merrihew\u2019s cup\u2019 to refer to the set of water molecules\nin his cup, and the sum theorist would take it to refer to a fusion.\nThese are both particular entities. But, for the Pluralist, the water\nis not a particular thing\u2014it is many things. For example, the\naccount that Nicolas recommends\n\n\nassociates to a mass noun [M], not a set of things, but some\nthings, each of which is M\u2026the denotation of the\nexpression the gold on the table, the as, comprises\nany things that are gold on the table. (2008, 22)\n\n\nMany claim that plural logic, reference, predication, and\nquantification is ontologically innocent. That is, we are not\ncommitting ourselves the existence of new entities by employing\nplurals, even if we believe that some usage featuring plural reference\nis irreducible. Being committed to the existence of \u2018those\ncats\u2019 (while adverting to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and\nMagnificat) is not an additional commitment over and above the\ncommitment to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and Magnificat. When one\npays for this apple, and that apple, one gets \u2018the apples\u2019\nfor free. In this respect the ontologically innocent Pluralist has a\nleg up over the set and sums theorists, since the former posits no\nnovel entities. But, to be fair, some sum theorists have argued that\npositing sums is \u2018ontologically innocent\u2019\u2014i.e., when\nwe have two things, positing a sum of those two things does not\nintroduce anything in addition to the initial two things. So, there\nmay be parity in this\n respect.[21]\n\nIn some of his early work Laycock makes arguments by analogy to\nsupport the proposal that mass expressions are veiled plural\nexpressions, so that water, in its analysis, gets treated\nlike apples or Hobbits does. We turn to the\nanalogies.\n\nBoth mass and plural terms refer cumulatively. Just as any two\nportions of water considered together are water, so these apples and\nthose apples together are apples.\n\nAlso, Hobbits, just like water, resists\npluralization. For the former, this is because Hobbits is already\nplural: \u2018Hobbitses\u2019 does not make sense. Water\ncannot be pluralized and retain its standard reference, since\n\u2018waters\u2019 either means kinds of water, or different\nbodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, pools, seas, rather\nthan numerous water per se, which doesn\u2019t make sense\nunless used in a technical or stipulative way). One way to explain\nthis is to suppose that water is already plural.\n\nBoth Hobbits and water do not take the indefinite\narticle. Neither \u2018a water\u2019 (when not understood in the\nkind sense or with an implicit partitioning e.g., \u2018bottle\nof\u2019) nor \u2018a Hobbits\u2019 are grammatical. Both mass and\nplural expressions take the definite article since \u2018the\u2019\n\u201cdoes not discriminate between singular and plural\u201d\n(Laycock 2006, p.\u200935). Both Hobbits and water\ntake the non-singular analogue of the indefinite\narticle\u2014\u2018some\u2019. Some Hobbits and some water can both\nsurround a castle, and neither use implies singularity.\n\nBoth mass and plural terms can be prefaced by partitioning and\nmeasurement terms. One could buy seven pounds of applesauce, or seven\npounds of apples. One could sell a jar of applesauce, or a box of\napples, a gallon of marbles, or a gallon of milk.\n\nBut, even given the aforementioned similarities, there are significant\ndifferences between mass and plural terms. While one can infer from\n\u201cThere are peppercorns in the sauce\u201d that there is at\nleast one peppercorn in the sauce, one cannot infer from \u201cThere\nis wine in the sauce\u201d that there is at least one (non-kind\nusage) wine in the sauce. Furthermore, every plural term (except for\nplural invariable terms such as \u2018cattle\u2019 and\n\u2018groceries\u2019) e.g., \u2018cats\u2019, is correlated with\na singular cognate, e.g., \u2018cat\u2019. But there are no singular\ncognates for mass terms e.g., \u2018water\u2019 or\n\u2018silverware\u2019\n\nThere is much to say for the pluralist position. Plural logic is\nbecoming better understood, less controversial, and a case can be made\nthat standard first-order logic will be subsumed under, or merged\nwith, plural logic (for discussion of these issues, see the entry on\n plural quantification).\n If this is so, and mass expressions are plural expressions, then mass\nexpressions can be accounted for in a relatively well understood and\nuncontroversial logic which accounts for a wider range of commonsense\ninferences than standard logic does.\n\nThe pluralist account is quite plausible when we consider atomic mass\nexpressions, or mass expressions with atomic denotata (def.\n\u2018atomic\u2019 in\n 1.4)\n such as \u2018silverware\u2019, \u2018furniture\u2019, and\n\u2018water\u2019. It will become easy to cash out the truth\nconditions of such talk in terms of the atomic units, such as pieces\nof silverware, furniture, and H2O molecules (Nicolas\n2008).\n\nAlso in favor of the account is that it does at least as good a job as\nthe set-theoretical view since it explains the relationship between a\nthing and its constituting matter in a similar way, yet posits no\nnovel entities like sets. There are just the many bits, and the\nconstituted object of which they are parts. This point has been stated\nforcefully by Laycock (1972) and Burke (1997), yet these accounts have\nthe worrying feature (for some) of not being truly reductive. See\nsection\n 3.1\n for an \u2018ontologically serious\u2019 view of pluralities.\n\nMany of the problems which beset the set theorist confront the\nPluralists as well. What about fuzzy atomless or gunky stuff? If talk\nof stuff is to be paraphrased in terms of plural reference, what are\nthe individuals slotted for this role? With atomic stuffs, it is\nclear. But with \u2018fruitcake\u2019 and \u2018taco sauce\u2019\nit is not. Why suppose there is a fact of the matter as to what counts\nas stuffs of these kinds? And if there is no fact of the matter then\nwhat are the individuals we are speaking of when we speak of\nfruitcake? And our Pluralist has just as much trouble chopping up the\nJello cube as the Set Theorist in\n 2.2.\n\nOf course, vagueness and indeterminacy are problems for most theories\nof masses, so it could be unfair to overstress this point, and it is\nnot at all clear that the pluralist can\u2019t augment her account\nwith standard logics of vagueness or employ analogues to set-theoretic\nnon-well-foundedness moves. (See Chierchia 2010 for an examination of\nvagueness and its relation to mass nouns, and a development of a\nplural approach, which can be found in many other articles, e.g.\nChierchia 1998a). Given the many salutary components of plural logic\nin relation to mass expressions, this remains a promising area of\ninquiry.\n3. Stuff as Distinct From Things\n\nThe first three approaches to the referents of nominal concrete mass\nexpressions in the foregoing section are all relatively conservative.\nAll three are compatible with Thing Theory as described in\n 1.1.\n In this section we will examine views which posit non-thing-like\nstuff in addition to things\n (3.1),\n or eliminate things altogether\n (3.2),\n and so are not compatible with Thing Theory.\n3.1 Serious Pluralities\n\nSome have taken a view of pluralities which is not ontologically\ninnocent. Henry Laycock and Michael Burke, at times, have tentatively\nfavored the notion that there is a novel ontic category of plural\nentities which are not individual items of quantification.\n\nWhat is the difference between the ontologically innocent and\nontologically serious pluralists, and what is the case for the serious\nposition? The serious pluralist can have several motivations. Laycock\n(1972) argues that there is definite reference of mass expressions,\nsuch as \u2018that water\u2019, \u2018the water in the tub\u2019,\nbut that this reference is not singular reference. \u2018This\nwater\u2019, on a demonstrative occasion, refers, but, \u201cmy\ncontention is that this water, unlike this or that drop, is\nnot a particular object\u201d (1972, p.\u20094). Laycock claims\nthat \u201cwe can and do think of stuff as having an\nindependent reality [from things]\u201d (1972, p.\u200927,\nitalics his). While saying \u201cthat there is gold in a certain\nregion is certainly to assert the existence of\nsomething\u201d (1972, p.\u200928), he does deny that this\n\u2018something\u2019 is particular, and, throughout his work,\ndenies that it is a set or a fusion. What definite singular terms like\n\u2018the gold in the\u2026\u2019 \u201cdesignate is a quite\ndistinct type of item, concrete but not particular\u201d (1972,\np.\u200928).\n\nIf one really believes that i) there is water, ii) we make definite\nreference to it, iii) water is not a thing (i.e., not a sum or set),\nand iv) plural quantification and predication is irreducible to\nsingular quantification and predication, then one might feel compelled\nto accept that mass expressions like water and gold\nrefer to genuine entities distinct from (or \u2018over and\nabove\u2019) the water and gold molecules. Let us call whatever it is\nthat is referred to with definite reference by mass expressions in\nthis way \u2018pluralities\u2019 (Laycock and Burke do not use the\nphrase, and Laycock would probably find it at best infelicitous, and\nat worst a grave source of metaphysical error).\n\nBelief in irreducible pluralities gets more traction when combined\nwith a denial of unrestricted mereology, which is just what Laycock\ndoes:\n\nThe posit of a physical object without a physical unity\u2014the\nposit of a \u2018formless\u2019 or \u2018structureless\u2019\nconcrete plurality, an arbitrary physical unit upon which there are no\nphysical or spatio-temporal constraints\u2014is no mere curiosity: it\nwould seem to be a kind of incoherence\u2026the concept of an object\nis the concept of a unit or a unity\u2026A physical object with all\nthe physical unity of a set of physical objects, for example\n{Caesar\u2019s nose, the Eiffel Tower, the Andromeda galaxy}\u2014a\nphysical object in short lacking physical or spatio-temporal\nunity\u2014is no physical object at all. (2006, p.\u200995)\n\n\nIf one accepts (i)\u2013(iv), and has reason to reject both UFM (see\n 2.1.1)\n and the set-theoretical view, and one wants commonsense sentences\nfeaturing mass expressions to come out true, then what is left to be\nreferred to by nominal statements about water, lead, etc. except\npluralities?\n\nAnother motivation can be found in Burke (1997), inspired by Laycock.\nBurke was concerned to resolve the coincidence puzzle between not only\na thing and its constituting piece of matter, but between these things\nand the matter per se. (Since some copper can persist past\nthe shattering of a piece of copper which constitutes a statue, then\npresumably the copper is distinct from either). Burke\u2019s account,\nall the details of which do not concern us here (see the entry on\n material constitution\n and the supplement\n Sums and Ordinary Objects\n for details) requires that the statue and piece of copper be\nidentical. If this is so, and the statue comes into existence, and is\nidentical with its constituting piece, then a new piece must come into\nexistence and the old one cease to be. One of the options Burke\ncanvasses to explain why it is that we (mistakenly) assume the piece\ncontinues in existence is because the copper persists through\nthe change:\n\nOf course, this explanation concedes that the statue\u2026shares its\nplace with something, namely, the copper. So am I not\nallowing coinciding objects after all? No, I am not, since I deny that\nthe copper is a single object. Following Laycock (1972) , I claim that\nthe copper is a plurality. It is many objects\u2026 The case of the\nstatue and the copper is not a case of coinciding objects because it\nis not a case in which one object occupies the same place as any one\nother. (1997, p.\u200912, italics his)\n\n\nBurke denies the identification of the many copper bits and the piece\nof copper:\n\nWell, I hold that each of the many is a part of the one, but I deny\nthat the many parts collectively are identical with the\none\u2026Trivially, the many are many. But it is not individually\nthat they are many. (They are one each.) So the many collectively are\nmany. But \u2018many\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 are contrary. So\nthe many collectively are not one. But, again trivially, the one is\none. So it is false that the many collectively are identical with the\none. (1997, p.\u200913)\n\n\nIt is doubtful, though, that postulating pluralities which are not\nthings can solve the coincidence puzzles. Burke, who himself brought\nup a similar objection to coincidence in general, faces the following\nproblem. How are distinct entities, such as the statue and the copper,\ndifferent in sort, given that they both have the same intrinsic\nproperties? There seems to be a one to one correspondence between the\nfeatures of the statue and those of the copper. Why isn\u2019t the\ncopper a statue, for the same reasons the piece of copper is? Burke\ncan insist that the main difference is that the statue/piece is one\nthing, whereas the copper is many things, but it is not clear why\nwithholding the honorific thing from \u2018the\u2019 copper\nplurality solves the problem (Zimmerman 1997, p.\u200923).\n\nIt is unclear what the addition of the attribution of \u2018concrete\nnon-particulars\u2019 to the plural analysis is doing, and doubtful\nthat it clarifies matters. (See Steen 2011 for a critique of\n\u2018contingent non-particularity\u2019). Indeed it seems to\nsomewhat back away from the plural analysis. The initial reason for\nanalyzing concrete mass expressions in terms of plural quantification\nand predication is that talk about \u2018the lions\u2019 and\n\u2018those Hobbits\u2019 is relatively unproblematic. But then, why\nreduce mass expressions to plural reference if one holds that\nwater or a water plurality is something over and above\nthose water molecules, yet denies that the lion\nplurality is something over and above those lions?\nIt\u2019s not clear why both water and lions get a plural reference\ntreatment, yet the referents of mass expressions get to retain some\nkind of ontological halo which distinguishes their referents from\nnon-mass plural expressions. Laycock (2006) no longer holds (and only\ntentatively held) that mass expressions are plural.\n3.2 World-Stuff\n\nSome stuff ontologists eliminate concrete things altogether. There is\nonly stuff, objects being accidental phases of objectively\nnon-objectual stuff. Alternatively, concepts are thought of as\n\u2018cookie-cutters\u2019, which conventionally carve\npseudo-objects (cf Dummet 1981, chap 16) out of the amorphous\nworld-blob, which either is not itself an object (Sidelle 1989), or is\nthe only object there is (Horgan & Potr\u010d 2000,\n 2008).[22]\n\nAlan Sidelle (1989, 1991, 1998) argues that while stuff exists, there\nare no things which exist and actually have the essences we believe\nthey do. In 1998 he argues that we should regard the unraveling of a\nsweater, or the chopping down of a tree, not as substantial\nchanges in which things cease to be, but rather as accidental changes\nin underlying, persisting stuff (compare also Needham 2010):\n\nthe intuitive [claim] we are here considering amounts to the claim\nthat while there are trees, sweaters, and other ordinary objects, our\nordinary substance terms are not, in fact, substance terms, but pick\nout these objects according to accidental properties\u2026Being a\ntree, or a sweater, is an accidental property of something more basic.\n\n\nWhat is more basic? Stuff. Supposed substantial\nchange in objects is actually accidental change to some stuff. Sidelle\ndiagnoses the phenomenon of coincidence as a species of the problem of\nindividuation:\n\nWhether there is coincidence is fundamentally the question of whether\nthere can be more than one criterion of identity instantiated at a\ngiven location, that is, whether, for any location taken to contain an\nobject, the various seemingly possible criteria of identity can all be\nruled out as false, save one. (1998, p.\u2009441)\n\n\nHe claims that the problem of coincident entities arises not due to\nthe diversity of individuals in a region, but rather due to the fact\nthat the world as it is under-determines which principles of\nindividuation are the correct ones to employ. We can treat any\nproperty as accidental or as essential by employing different sortals,\nor nominal essences, to describe a thing. When a cow dies, we can\ndescribe this either as the accidental change in some flesh-and-bones,\nor the substantial change in a cow which is no more. Sidelle\nconcludes, in a Lockean vein, that which changes we conceive of as\nsubstantial and which as accidental is more a function of us and our\ninterests than of the way things really are (1998, p.\u2009439).\n\nSidelle goes on to note that the main cause of our philosophical\npuzzles about objects is the dogmatic assumption that there are some,\ntogether with our employing the concept object. \u201cIt is\nobjects which have made the problem, and the solution\nisn\u2019t to switch which objects we allow, but to disallow\nobjects altogether\u201d (1998, p.441).\n\nSidelle recommends, tentatively, that we describe the world without\nquantification over things, and deny that \u201cthere is genuine,\nworld-given individuation.\u201d Furthermore, as it is supposedly\nobvious that there is at least stuff, we should suppose so, and\ntheoretically regard the role of the \u2018world-stuff\u2019 as\n\u201cthe mind-independent matter of the world which, among other\nthings, determines our perceptions\u201d (1998, p.\u2009443).\n\nOne problem for this view is that it is virtually indistinguishable\nfrom a Quinean view according to which a physical object is just\n\u201cthe content, however heterogeneous, of some portion of\nspace-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered\u201d (Quine 1960,\np.\u2009171). Our sortals, according to a type of Quinean, are used\nto pick out definite filled portions, and any and all of these are\nobjects. What Sidelle calls \u2018stuff\u2019 Quine (or Jubien in\n1993) is happy to call an \u2018object\u2019. If Sidelle\u2019s\nstuff talk is inter-translatable into Quinean thing-talk then there is\nmerely a terminological difference between the posit of World-Stuff\nand the posit of arbitrary things.\n\nA further strange point about this view is that it entails that, just\nas there are no objects which have the persistence conditions that we\nthink, there are no non-fundamental stuffs. The very same arguments\ngiven for rejecting ordinary objects and reducing them to world stuff\ncan be given for water molecules and sodium chloride. Electrolysis can\nbe seen not as the destruction of water but as a change in persisting\nunderlying stuff. This can be carried on until we get to the\nfundamental stuff(s). Hydrogen can be seen as a phase of a proton and\nan electron, and a proton can be seen as a phase of quarks and gluons.\nSo, it seems that elements and complexes, since they are not the\nfundamental or non-individuated world-stuff, must also be the result\nof conceptual carvings.\n\nWhat about fundamental particles (assuming there are some)?\nThey\u2019ve got to go as well, if we assume they are objects. If\nthere are in fact gluons and electrons which exist, are objects, and\nare particular things with identity and persistence conditions, then,\nif they are in fact simple they form the basis out of which we could\nconstruct the other objects. So, if non-individual world stuff is\ngoing to play a role, it seems that we must eliminate fundamental\nparticles as well. This approach allows too much physics to be done\nfrom the armchair. (Other criticisms of views like Sidelle\u2019s can\nbe found in Denkel 1989, 1995; Laycock 1989; Steen 2011; Turner 2011;\nand meta-ontological criticisms of these kind of disagreements can be\nfound in Eklund 2008. And, while not directly addressed in the\nfollowing sources, a template for the criticism that these varying\nviews about stuff vs. things may be a \u2018disagreement without a\ndifference\u2019 can be found in Hirsch 2002 and Carnap 1950).\n\nIt must be noted, though, that such a World-Stuff view is similar to\nsome interpretations of elementary particle physics and quantum\ntheory. Some scientists and philosophers of science do in fact argue\nthat at bottom the world is not a world of things or objects (or not\nentities we would unqualifiedly apply \u2018object\u2019 to).\nRather, the basic stuff is non-particular\n mass-energy,\n or evolving local quantum states (Arntzenius 2012 \u00a73.14), or\nfields, wave-functions, or spacetime itself (Malament 1996, Wallace\nand Timpson 2007), or structures (Ladyman and Ross 2009), or a kind of\nphysics-friendly materia prima (Esfeld et al 2017).\nSome argue that the only real entity is the space-time fabric,\nordinary objects just being temporary warpings or disturbances in it.\nOn such views both ordinary macroscopic objects and putative\nfundamental particles are only epiphenomenal entities or temporary\nmanifestations in the electromagnetic or gravitational fields (or\nother entities), which are fundamentally non-individual\u2014some\nkind of world stuff or spacetime and its features (for details, see\nthe entry\n identity and individuality in quantum theory).\n So, one should not rule out such views tout court. But,\ngiven the flux and opacity of such views, the untestability of some of\nthe theories which underly some of these views (e.g. String Theory),\nand the lack of scientific consensus on these issues, one should not\nquickly and whole-heartedly embrace the notion of fundamental\nnon-particular stuff either. These views merit further examination,\nbut their adequate demonstration in part rests upon succesful\nadvancements in physics and, for a layperson, a clear understanding of\nthese interpretations, each of which may not come anytime soon.\n4. Stuff and Things and the Limits of Linguistically-Guided Metaphysics\n\nThe foregoing entry represents a detailed case-study of metaphysical\nviews which are heavily guided by syntactical, lexical, and semantic\nconsiderations, but freed from some of the methodological constraints\nand more narrow objectives of linguists and semanticists. Often in the\npreceding we have seen how the\n+MASS/+COUNT distinction was used to\nmotivate a parallel \u2018metaphysically serious\u2019 stuff/thing\ndistinction. The question to be briefly addressed here, after looking\nback on sixty years of work on the topic, is: to what extent is\nthe +MASS/+COUNT distinction up to\nthe tasks assigned to it by metaphysicians?\n\nSuch tasks often serve two main functions: constructive, and\nprohibitive. The constructive aspect is the idea that we can (and\nshould) \u2018read off\u2019 the correct (or what we think is the\ncorrect) ontology from our language use. The prohibitive aspect is the\nidea that if syntax, semantics, or lexical meaning prohibits (or\nrenders incoherent, or non-well-formed) certain constructions, then we\ncan not (or should not) be ontologically committed to what the\nimpermissible renderings would commit us to. Often the constructive\nand prohibitive work hand-in-hand, such as we have seen by noting how\nthe fact that \u2018wine\u2019 cannot be prefaced with numerals\n(without referring to kinds) has lead many to think that wine cannot\nbe a thing (prohibitive), and that, since wine exists, and can be\nmeasured, that it must be instead stuff (constructive).\n\nBut can the +MASS/+COUNT distinction do\nthis much metaphysical work in a reliable way?\n4.1 Mass/Count Interchangeability, Arbitrariness, and Non-Universality\nInterchangeability\n\nAs an introductory example of the topic of interchangeability,\nconsider these well-known lyrics from the musical Sweeney\nTodd:\n\n\nTODD: (spoken) These are desperate times,\n\nMrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for!\n\nLOVETT: Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven!\n\nTODD: What is that?\n\nLOVETT: It\u2019s priest. Have a little priest.\n\nTODD: Is it really good?\n\nLOVETT: Sir, it\u2019s too good, at least!\n\nThen again, they don\u2019t commit sins of the flesh,\n\nSo it\u2019s pretty fresh.\n\n\u2026\n\nTODD: Haven\u2019t you got poet, or something like that?\n\nLOVETT: No, y\u2019see, the trouble with poet is\n\n\u2019Ow do you know it\u2019s deceased?\n\nTry the priest!\n\n(Lyrics from Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet\nStreet)\n\n\nAs Pelletier has frequently noted (e.g. 1989, 2001, 2011, 2012a,\n2012b), even if one wants to ignore putative metaphysical distinctions\nfor distinguishing mass and count, instead maintaining that there are\nmerely syntactical, lexical, or semantical ones\u2014there remain\nsignificant problems for distinguishing mass vs. count. And if such\nfundamental linguistic problems are still outstanding, then the\nprospects of employing the +MASS/+COUNT\ndistinction as the basis for a strong metaphysical distinction are\n hazy.[23]\n Let\u2019s see why.\n\nEvery criterion put forth for distinguishing between\n+MASS and +COUNT faces\nsignificant\u2014and seemingly systematic\u2014counterexamples. We\nattempted to side-step such problems in\n Section 1\n by stipulating that there is a difference between\n\u2018nouns/terms/expressions used with a mass sense,\u2019 versus\n\u2018nouns/terms/expressions used with a count sense,\u2019 but\nforebore giving an account of what gives particular instances the\nsense they do have. (More detail on this can be found in the\n \u201cLogic of Mass Expressions\u201d\n entry). Then, using the rough-and-ready characterization of\n+COUNT versus +MASS (or things versus\nstuff) we, mirroring our authors, went on to exploit the distinction\nfor our ends of taxonomizing the world\u2019s inhabitants and\ndescribing their features.\n\nBut, this stipulation ignores the following kinds of problems. Suppose\nwe accept that syntactic criteria (as covered in\n Section 1)\n are doing the distinguishing. The problem with this is that every\nputatively +MASS/-COUNT noun admits of\n-MASS/+COUNT instances, and we cannot\ntell the difference based on syntax alone. But if this is so, then we\nwould need \u201csyntactic derivation rules to convert each noun from\none to the other category\u2014a terrible syntactic idea (or double\nentries for every lexical noun\u2014another terrible syntactic idea)\n\u2026 once [this is done] \u2026, then the\n+MASS/-COUNT features do no syntactic work: they never\nrule out any construction as ungrammatical on their own\u201d\n(Pelletier 2011, pp. 22\u201323).\n\nAny supposed count noun can have mass instances, and vice versa. For\nexample, employing something like the \u2018Universal Grinder\u2019\nidea of Pelletier (1979, pp. 5\u20136) we can imagine any putative\ncount-item C as being ground up so that there is \u2018C all over the\nfloor.\u2019 The quoted passage above from Sweeney Todd is\nan example of how count-terms for kinds of people are easily\ntransformed into mass terms to refer to the stuffs in (or kinds of)\nmeat-pies served to the unwittingly cannibalistic customers. The\nUniversal Grinder idea relies more on the ease with which we can\nswitch from +COUNT to +MASS than it does\non any actual grinding (cf. Chierchia 2010 and 2021, Rothstein 2010 p.\n390\u20134). We can refer to any individual (be it ground or whole)\nin a \u2018massy\u2019 way. Think of how Mark\u2019s spouse might\nthink, \u2018there\u2019s a lot more Mark now after the\nquarantine\u2019 if he gained a lot of weight. These instances of\n\u2018grinding\u2019, which may seem peculiar or violent, have been\nargued to be merely \u201crealizations of a regular polysemy\u201d\n(Kiss et al 2021b, 379).\n\nBunt (1985) discussed the reverse operation(s):\n(+MASS/-COUNT ->\n-MASS/+COUNT), which comes in two\nvarieties. The first is the \u2018Universal Sorter\u2019, which\nsorts into kinds, such as with \u2018Voodoo Brewery sells\nsix beers.\u2019 The second is the \u2018Universal Packager\u2019\n(Pelletier 1975), which puts masses into portions, as with\n\u2018we\u2019ll have six beers,\u2019 or \u2018there are four\nbutters in the package.\u2019 (Granted, there is a change in sense in\nthese cases, but, as addressed below, this doesn\u2019t undermine the\nnotion that these nouns are polysemous, and so also does not undermine\nthe point of interchangeability without a lexical switch). We can\nrefer to any stuff (be it packaged, atomistic, or neither) in a\nparticular way.\n\nHuddleston & Payne, in The Cambridge Grammar of the English\nLanguage (Huddleston & Pullum (eds.), 2002, pp. 334\u20135,\ncited in Pelletier 2011 and 2012), show convincingly that such\ntransformations are ubiquitous and do not at all support the notion\nthat [chocolate (+MASS/-COUNT)]\n(\u2018he had a lot of chocolate\u2019) is a different word\nthan [chocolate (-MASS/+COUNT)]\n(\u2018he had three chocolates\u2019). \u2018Chocolate\u2019 is\npolysemous, not homonymous. In addition to the lack of syntactic\nfeatures to distinguish between mass and count terms, there are no\ninherent lexical features either.\n\nSo if syntax or lexical meaning won\u2019t do it, maybe a semantic\ndistinction will do? Huddleston & Payne go on to distinguish\nbetween the heterogeneity of terms like\n\u2018crockery\u2019 and \u2018furniture\u2019, which are not\ndissective, versus terms like \u2018water,\u2019 which are (2002,\n336\u20137). (They call the former sort of mass terms\n\u2018aggregative\u2019). But if dissectivity is taken seriously as\na semantic requirement to be considered as mass, then it will end up\nthat an H2O molecule is not water, nor is an NaCl molecule\nsalt. (More on the non-atomic criteria is discussed in the Supplement\non\n Non-Atomicity and Its Relevance to the Mass/Count Distinction).\n As the authors point out (p338), when some material comes in small\nenough units, we often treat it as\n+MASS/-COUNT, such as dust,\nhair (e.g. when there\u2019s scattered piles of it on the\nfloor), change (i.e., coins)\u2013\u2013not because we\nthink the stuff is non-atomic, but because when the atoms are small\nenough it is more convenient or intuitive to think of it in a\n+MASS way. Dissectivity may do some work, but only to a\npoint, and so it\u2019s not really what is distinguishing mass from\ncount. And we cannot appeal to language-users\u2019 intentions in\nparticular instances to settle whether their use is mass or count\nbecause it may be \u201cthat in most instances speakers simply have\nno intentions that are relevant\u201d (Pelletier 2001 p496,\nsummarizing Ware 1975). Often, people\u2019s use, mental states, and\nthe nature of the referent under-determine whether on a particular\noccasion a noun/term/expression is used in a mass or count manner.\n\nCumulativity may be a more dogged criterion, as it is relatively\nconsistent for two (+COUNT/-MASS)\nN\u2019s not to be an N, e.g. two people don\u2019t seem to be a\nperson, whereas some (-COUNT/+MASS) N\nand some other N are N, e.g. two bits of water are water. But there\nare many counterexamples to this as well. If there is an aggregate of\nwell-demarcated individuals, then the aggregation of it with another\nyields an aggregate. Two connected but discrete planes can compose a\nplane, and some robots could be made to, Voltron-style, compose a\nrobot. Or, less exotically, in certain circumstances two fleets or\narmies could compose a fleet or army. Granted, these are somewhat\nartificial examples, and cumulativity does seem to be much more common\nin +MASS than +COUNT, but it is not\ndistinguished in this from +PLURAL. (See Sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3.1\n for accounts which reduce mass reference to plural reference).\n\nThere is empirical work which militates against the standard criteria\nput forward for differentiating mass and count, and also questions the\nover-reliance of researchers on their own intuitions about the\ndistinction (Kiss et al, 2017). Reflection upon recent\nempirical evidence in language-acquisition has led some researchers to\ntentatively conclude that particular nouns themselves, whether mass or\ncount, \u201cdo not encode full conceptual criteria for\nindividuation, but instead encode partial criteria that are filled out\npragmatically, by contrasting alternative descriptions of objects and\ntheir parts\u201d (Srinivasan and Barner 2020, p159). But it would be\nirresponsible to suggest that there is just \u2018nothing to\u2019\nthe mass/count distinction, nor any universal or near-universal\ndistinguishing features (See Chierchia 2010 p.4). One can maintain\nthat while there are different mass and count senses, that\nnevertheless, all nouns are both mass and count, as\nwe see defended in Pelletier 2012b. (For challenges to this, see Kiss\net al 2021b). Yet others argue that it is not the distinction\nbetween mass and count that matters so much, rather what matters is\nthe more general distinction between being +COUNT and\n+NON-COUNT (Laycock 2006b & 2006c, Rothstein 2010,\nWiese 2012, and see chapter 1 of Massam 2012 for other proposed\nreplacements to, or more general alternatives to, the mass/count\ndistinction).\nArbitrariness\n\nRelying on the +MASS/+COUNT distinction\nto support any strong metaphysical conclusions has the additional\nproblem that, in many cases, whether we use a mass or count term\nappears to be almost completely arbitrary (and certainly\nnon-universal, see the next section). The following is a chart which\nlists many nouns in English and shows how their translations\nfrequently diverge in terms of being +MASS or\n+COUNT (The following examples are from Pelletier 2001,\n2011; Chierchia 1998a, 2010):\n\nCross-Linguistic Mass/Count Variation\n\n\ndandruff\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nFrench: les pellicules\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) lit. \u2018the\nfilms\u2019 \n\ndish(es)\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT)\nFrench: la vaisalle\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT) \n\nfurniture\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nGerman: ein m\u00f6bel\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) \n\nnews\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nGerman: eine nachricht\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) lit. \u2018a\nnews\u2019 \n\nstrawberry\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT)\nRussian: klubnika /\n\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)  \n\n\nEven within English often the use seems arbitrary, where the\nfollowing illustrate cases where either (i) the choice to use a\n+MASS/-COUNT or\n-MASS/+COUNT term is (usually) arbitrary\non the occasion of use, or (ii) where a contrast is given (e.g.\nbetween fruit and vegetables) where one can see that\nour decision to make the default noun mass and another count is\narbitrary, since there is no inherent mass/count difference in the\nreferents. (These examples, and the point, are from Pelletier 1989\np19, and 2012 p429, and Gillon 1992 p.627, 2012 p.721).\n\n\n\n+MASS/-COUNT\n-MASS/+COUNT  \n\n\nfruit\nvegetables \n\nflu\ncold \n\nspaghetti\nnoodle \n\nfootware\nshoes \n\nchange\ncoins \n\nknowledge\nbelief \n\nrice\nbeans \n\nbaklava\nbrownies \n\nfoliage\nleaves \n\nammunition\nbullets  \n\nNon-Universality\n\nStrawson\n (1959) introduced the notion of \u2018descriptive metaphysics\u2019\nto self-describe his attempt to explain what \u2018individuals\u2019\nare, according to ordinary language. Projects like this do not seek to\ncarve out the ontic joints in nature so much as show where \u2018the\nfolk\u2019 supposedly think such joints are, as implied by their\nlanguage use. Projects like this represent attempts to describe our\nmetaphysical picture of the world rather than argue that the picture\nis right.\n\nPrescriptive metaphysics, by contrast, seeks to argue for particular\nmetaphysical views that may not gel with commonsense or ordinary\nlanguage. Prescriptive metaphysics often relies on the descriptive in\norder to advance its agenda\u2014sometimes as a foil, other times as\na baseline from which to deviate minimally only when required, or\nregarded as an oppressive thought system that we need liberation from,\nand so on. Often prescriptivists are descriptivists inasmuch as they\nattempt to \u2018paraphrase\u2019 their replacement ontology into\nthe language of the folk and its implicit ontology, and the\navailability of such a paraphrase is sometimes thought to be required\nfor the replacement ontology to be considered successful. Such a\nparaphrase requires doing descriptive metaphysics.\n\nYet the descriptive is not free from prescriptivity either, since\nthere are obviously disagreements amongst practitioners of descriptive\nmetaphysics, and conflicting intuitions about what \u2018our\u2019\nimplicit ontology is. And so descriptivists argue that we should\naccept one descriptive view over another, but such arguments often\nrely on pointing out that the opponents\u2019 view cannot be a\ncorrect view of reality, or rely on a principle of charity that\nrequires attempting to massage the folk view so that it ends up being\ncorrect as a depiction of reality, which in turn relies on the\nprescriptive non-universal intuitions of the descriptive\nmetaphysician. Any sufficiently rich descriptive metaphysics is not\nfree from some prescriptive content. And so they need each other, and\nare inextricably intertwined.\n\nMost of the foregoing metaphysicians (not necessarily philosophers of\nlanguage or linguists) we have examined have practiced a sort of mixed\nmethodology. One starts by pointing out the commonsense distinction in\nEnglish between mass and count, and one then proceeds to develop a\npicture which can both explain, and be consistent with, ordinary talk,\nas well as solving whichever particular problems the metaphysician in\nquestion is concerned with. Often one takes the ordinary language\ndistinction as evidence in their view\u2019s favor, together with\nvarious prescriptively informed premises not necessarily endorsed by\nfolk ontology.\n\nThe problem with this procedure is that the distinction between mass\nand count is often employed by metaphysicians to make universal\nconclusions about \u2018our\u2019 (i.e., humanity\u2019s) implicit\nconceptual scheme, usually by merely examining English (or\nthe one to three Indo-European languages known by the author).\n\nAs one early critic of Strawson\u2019s method noted (Mei 1961, cited\nin Pelletier 2011 pp. 37\u20138):\n\n\nStrawson exploits facts peculiar to languages like English \u2026 in\nChinese, Strawson\u2019s criteria are inapplicable \u2026 [his]\n\u2026 Aristotelian arguments based upon the pecularities of English\nand its relatives \u2026 [Strawson\u2019s notion of]\n\u2018assertive ties\u2019, and subject-predicate\n\u2018congruence\u2019 only works for languages with sufficient\ninflection \u2026. Strawson\u2019s silence [about other languages]\ncan be interpreted in only two ways. He must either have thought that\nthey conform to his criterion or that they are irrelevant. But the\ngrammatical facts of Chinese do not conform to his criterion \u2026\nand to say that they are irrelevant is to claim that English is the\nparadigm of all languages. What justification can Strawson, or any of\nhis colleagues, offer for this act of linguistic imperialism? (Mei\n1961 p157, most truncation and interpolation is Pelletier\u2019s)\n\n\nWhile the mass/count distinction is relatively pervasive, it is not\nclearly universal. Some (e.g. Sharvy 1978) have argued that Mandarin\nhas no count nouns at all, and rather refers to individuals by\nimposing a measure or classifier on what are by default mass nouns.\nSo, for example, \u2018a cigarette\u2019\n(\u2018\u9999\u70df\u2019) is best understood as something like\n\u2018a stick\u2019s worth of cigarette-stuff.\u2019 But others\n(e.g. Cheng & Sybesma 1999, Cherchia 2010) have argued that we are\nto look for the +MASS/-COUNT distinction\nin the classifier system itself (cf Pelletier 2011 p30),\nwhile yet others argue that there just is no distinction between mass\nand count in Mandarin. In an opposite fashion, Whorf (1944) argued\nthat Hopi has only count nouns, and Davis and Matthewson (2009) have\nargued that the Lillooet Salish language lacks mass nouns\nentirely.\n\nWhile ignoring the details, The D\u00ebn\u00eb\nS\u0173\u0142in\u00eb\u0301 language (spoken by the Den\u00e9 or\nChipeweyan people of Northwest Canada) arguably does not have a\nmass/count distinction whatsoever, nor do the Amazonian languages\nKaritiana or Yudja. (See Pelletier 2011 p31, and a challenge to this\nin Chierchia 2021. See Wiltschko 2012 for an examination of languages\nwhich lack a mass/count distinction, and for extremely recent and\ncopious work on this see the Kiss, Pelletier, and Husic (eds.) 2021\ncollection).\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been definitively demonstrated that the\nmass/count distinction is not universal (cf. Chierchia 2021), neither\ncan one easily claim that it is (cf. Massam 2012 ch.1). Maybe its\nuniversality is not needed for their purposes, but authors frequently\nseem to argue that syntactical, lexical, or semantic features of mass\nvs. count give one strong reason to believe that such a distinction\ngoes beyond the representational and reflects reality itself.\n4.2 From Arbitrariness to Mass/Count Skepticism?\n\nIf the following summary propositions are all true:\n\nIt is arbitrary whether a term we decide to use is mass or count\n(e.g. leaves vs. foliage),\nEvery supposed mass noun can be used in a count sense, and every\nsupposed count noun can be used in a mass sense,\nThe mass/count distinction is not universal (or at least not\nobviously so),\n\n\nthen this calls into question the licitness of metaphysicians\u2019\nheavy reliance on the distinction in furthering their descriptive and\nprescriptive projects. This does not mean that these metaphysical\nviews are not worth arguing for, or entertaining, but that the\nparticular ways they have been argued for could reasonably be doubted\nby one we could call a \u2018Mass/Count Skeptic.\u2019 A Mass/Count\nSkeptic is one who thinks that the mass/count distinction is a red\nherring with regards to laying out either a descriptive or\nprescriptive metaphysics, since the undeterdetermination of\n(metaphysical) theory by (linguistic) data in this matter is acute.\nThis does not mean that one should not engage in metaphysical\narguments about stuff vs things, but perhaps the mass/count\ndistinction is not as firm a foundation as many have thought. After\ndemonstrating some of the preceding kinds of considerations, Pelletier\nsays\n\n\nthe facts surrounding how +MASS/+COUNT\nis manifested in languages other than the Indo-European ones might\nseem to show that the basis and rationale for making the\ndistinction\u2014and perhaps any philosophical consequences that\nmight seem to follow from the distinction\u2014are not really valid\nas claims about reality in general or about how people might\nconceptualize reality. (Pelletier 2012a p435).\n\n\nIn an earlier piece, Pelletier says \u201cit seems there is nothing\nin the referent of the terms that should make fruit mass and\nvegetable count, baklava mass and brownie\ncount, rice mass and bean count\u201d (2001 p497).\nWhen we are not thinking about linguistics or metaphysics, and have to\ngo about our business, we see that sometimes it is convenient to look\nat its inhabitants in a massy way (\u2018I\u2019ve got 1000 pounds\nof furniture to ship,\u2019 \u2018I had too much fruitcake\u2019),\nand sometimes in a count way (\u2018Large-Haired Real Estate\nAgent\u2019s Quarterly says that a dining table, six chairs, and\ncredenza are necessary for ideal dining room staging,\u2019 \u2018We\nneed two fruitcakes for the party\u2019). Whenever we have some stuff\nor particles whose smallest macroscopically visible bits are identical\nor interchangeable, and they can be gathered or stuck together or can\nact together in a macroscopic way (e.g. air/wind), we tend to think of\nit in massy way, and, as regards its small-scale structure, there just\nis no folk pre-scientific commonsense commitment to either atomism or\nnot (cf Ware 1975, pace Bunt 1985, Link 1998). The\nonly reason that rice is mass and beans count is\nprobably because the former are smaller and harder to distinguish, or\ncount separately. Change becomes coins when we want\nto count them, whereas humans become flesh when\ntheir individuality is regarded as unimportant, e.g. in the following\nreal-world example. One Dr. Albert Klingman, when beginning medical\nexperiments on prisoners, upon first seeing them (many who were\nshirtless), said that \u201cAll I saw before me were acres of skin.\nIt was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time\u201d\n(Munson & Lague, 2017, 133).\n\nIt\u2019s an open question how a metaphysician with a hardcore\ncommitment to following the dictates of language should adjust their\nmethodology, at least as regards the mass/count distinction, given the\nforegoing. Suppose one wants to become more inclusive, and follow not\nmerely the dictates of their own language (or even their larger\nlanguage group), and instead decides to constrain and shape their\nmetaphysical theories only by the most general aspects of shared human\ngrammar, syntax, or semantics. Supposing that there even are some\nuniversal semantic features (or a \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019, a\nnon-settled hypothesis), it seems that the mass/count distinction is\nnot among them (again\u2014not settled). Then it seems that the\nlinguistically-guided metaphysician must accept either that a\n\u2018metaphysically serious\u2019 distinction between stuff and\nthings cannot be maintained whatsoever, or, it can be. If it can be,\nit must be in some watered-down fashion. (E.g., maybe reality contains\nneither stuff nor things, but has beings which can be regarded either\nway\u2014cf. Pelletier 2001). It may be that the most universal\ncommonalities of all human language will not impose nearly as much\nstructure or guidance as linguistically-guided metaphysicians would\nwish, at least as regards mass vs. count.\n\nAlternatively, one can be a Mass/Count Skeptic, and, while not ceasing\nto do metaphysics, or theorize about the difference between\n\u2018stuff\u2019/\u2019matter\u2019 and\n\u2018things\u2019/\u2019individuals,\u2019 cease relying on the\nmass/count distinction to do the lion\u2019s share of work in\ndeciding whether there is such a corresponding ontological difference\nin the world. (cf. Pelletier 2011, \u00a73.2). That\u2019s not what\nit\u2019s there for.\n\nWhile the reservations expressed in this section may seem pessimistic,\nthey are not, as these observations are serving to move us forward.\nMuch exciting and useful work is being done and remains to be done on\nthe mass/count distinction, as mentioned below, and\nlinguistically-guided metaphysicians will have a role to play in this\ninter-disciplinary work. It may just be that metaphysicians will have\nto become more nuanced in their appreciation of mass vs. count, as\nthere will likely become ever more fine-grained distinctions and\nqualifications to\n consider.[24]\n\nFurthermore, the direction of the vast growing empirical data needs to\nbe reckoned with, which makes early oracular pronouncements from the\narmchair seem quaint. Linguistically-guided metaphysicians working at\nthe crossroads of philosophy of language, logic, and metaphysics, need\nnot merely follow the lead of linguists and semanticists, but can, and\nshould, play a role in this work, as they come at this topic with\ndifferent concerns and different skill-sets which matter. The\nconsiderations in this last section represent a tentative reappraisal\nof the value of continuing to practice a certain methodological stance\nin the light of recent developments. It could very well be that new\ndata, and new theories could show how the distinction between mass and\ncount actually is as important as many have thought, perhaps by\nresurrecting itself in a new guise, such as the distinction between\n+COUNT and -COUNT. Furthermore, we can never be sure what new\ndiscoveries will be made in fundamental physics which could suddenly\nmake us re-evaluate, revise, abandon, or double-down on the picture we\nhave of matter, ordinary objects, and their relations.\n\n\nMass expressions and their relations to count expressions, and how\nthey are interpreted and employed by metaphysicians, offer us an\ninteresting and voluminous case-study of recent metaphysics informed\nby lexical, semantic, and syntactic considerations. The careful\nstudent of this material can take away many cautionary tales, useful\ntools, and become aware of just how different the responses to the\nsame linguistic data can be. This is a very difficult and woolly area\nof inquiry where there is little consensus. But interesting recent\nempirical work on mass and count expressions is being done which is\nshedding some new light on these issues, and there has been an\nexplosion of recent work in linguistics which does seem to display\ngenuine progress, the most fecund research being more heavily\nempirical than before. (For earlier empirically-informed work on this,\nsee Casati 2005, and Frisson & Frazier 2005. For more recent\nrelevant work, see Husi\u0107 2020, Kiss et al 2021a, Kiss\net al 2017; Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Massam 2012;\nMoltmann 2020; and see the references mentioned in Pelletier 2012\np435).\n\nHopefully, philosophers can work together with linguists, computer\nscientists, cognitive scientists, and others to help achieve some kind\nof breakthrough that can comprehend the mass/count distinction, and in\nso doing situate it properly into a role it is well-suited for to help\nus understand more deeply the relations between mental representation,\nlinguistic representation, and represented real-world entities.\n\nThe category of Stuff is still under-developed, and seems to\nbe where the category Event was decades ago. Stuff\nand stuff-talk represent either (i) an important ontological category,\nwhich remains poorly understood, or, (ii) a distinct way of conceiving\nor talking about objects, where its interface with object-talk is,\nagain, poorly understood. In the absence of consensus on the referents\nand logico-linguistic mechanics of mass expressions, controversy about\nstuff is bound to continue.\n",
