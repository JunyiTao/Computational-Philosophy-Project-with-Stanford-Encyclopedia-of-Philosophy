    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam || Theodicy (The Problem of Evil)\n2.4 Theodicy (The Problem of Evil)\nThe problem of theodicy, which Khayyam handles both philosophically and poetically, is one of the most prevalent themes in his quatrains, yet his approach differs in each medium. It is an irony that while in his philosophy Khayyam offers a rational explanation for the existence of evil, in his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t he strongly criticizes the presence of evil and finds no justification for it fully satisfying. One may argue that such an inconsistency bears witness to the fact that the philosophical treatises and the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t are not authored by the same person. While this remains a possibility, it is also reasonable that these seemingly contradictory works might belong to the same person. The discrepancy speaks to the human condition that despite our rationalization of the problem of evil, on a practical and emotional level, we remain fundamentally bewildered by the unnecessary presence of so much pain and suffering.\nQ\u0101d\u0323\u012b Ab\u016b Nas\u0323r, a statesman and scholar from Shir\u0101z, posed the following question to Khayyam:\n\nIt is therefore implied that the Necessary Existent is the cause of the occurrence of evil, contrariety and corruption in the world. This is not worthy of the Divine status. So how can we resolve this problem and the conflict, so evil will not be attributed to the Necessary Existent? (The Necessity of Contrariety, Malik (ed.), 1998, 362\u20133)\n\nThe first sentence of the above quote is in fact the conclusion of a short argument, described on the previous page. Here is a slightly revised formulation of that argument:\n\nEvil and contrary events occur in this world.\nThe evil and contrary events that occur in this world are either necessary existents or contingent existents.\nThey cannot be necessary existents (because, this implies that multiple things are necessary existents, but it has been demonstrated that there is one and only one Necessary Existent, which is absolutely simple and one in all respects).\n\nSo,\n\nThe evil and contrary events that occur in this world are contingent existents.\n\nBut\n\nThe Necessary Existent is the ultimate cause of all contingent existents.\n\nThus,\n\nThe Necessary Existent is the ultimate cause of the occurrence of evil and contrary events.\nIf A is the cause of B and B is the cause of C, then A is the cause of C (Khayyam has formulated this premise explicitly in his response to the question).\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe Necessary Existent is (not only the ultimate cause but) the cause of the occurrence of evil and contrary events.\n\nIn The Necessity of Contrariety, Khayyam offers an extended argument to exonerate God from being morally blameworthy for the creation of evil (the expression \u201cmorally blameworthy\u201d is ours). Some have understood his response in terms of associating evil with non-existence or absence. Accordingly, God has created the essences of all contingent beings, which are good in and of themselves since any being, ontologically speaking, is better than non-being. Evil therefore represents an absence, a non-being for which God cannot be blamed (Nasr, The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher; Aminrazavi 2007, 172\u20135).[6]\nA closer reading of the text, however, may suggest a different and novel solution. Evil is sometimes introduced as nonexistence (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 118) and sometimes as following from nonexistence (ibid. and The Necessity of Contrariety, N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b 2000, 168), which itself follows from the contrary relations that hold between contingent objects or events. Many instances of evil, according to Khayyam, do exist in reality. Khayyam\u2019s main point is not that evil acts and events are absences or negative facts, as it were. Though he talks about nonexistence and associates evil with absence, the contribution of his argument is not to conceptualize all instances of evil in terms of nonexistence or merely mental existence. Rather, evil is characterized as the concomitant of the contrary relations that obtain between contingent existents, which themselves are essentially created by God. In this formulation, two notions call for clarification. First, the notion of \u201cconcomitant\u201d (law\u0101zim) as a \u201cnecessary non-essential predicable\u201d: this notion is well known in the Avicennan school and borrowed from the Aristotelian notion of per se accidents (kath\u2019 hauto sembeb\u00eak\u00f4s). The second notion is the distinction between essential and accidental causation. This is also rooted in an Aristotelian theory of causation and Avicenna\u2019s reconstruction of that. Evil, as the concomitant of the contrary relations that hold between contingent existents, is only accidentally created by God. Otherwise put, God essentially causes the (\u201cquiddative,\u201d this is our term) contingent beings and only accidentally causes contrary relations, and, as a result, the evil that follows from the co-existence of those essences. Furthermore, Khayyam claims, the problem in this case is whether God is the essential cause of the occurrence of evil. This can be interpreted as a value claim: causing something is not worthy of Divine status only if God essentially and intentionally causes it. (Khayyam immediately modifies this claim, explaining that the First, properly speaking, has no \u201cintention\u201d (qa\u1e63d) but there is eternal guardianship (\u02bfin\u0101ya).) Since God does not essentially and intentionally cause evil (in fact, the existence of some contrary relations is a necessary consequence of creating (quiddative) contingent existents), it follows that God accidentally causes evil and this is not morally problematic.\nIn the appendix to his response to the first question, Khayyam raises another objection: Given that evil is accidentally created by God and assuming that God is omniscient, \u201cWhy did God essentially create things, i.e. (quiddative) contingent existents, if He knew their existence would imply contrary relations, nonexistence, and eventually evil?\u201d Khayyam\u2019s response is based on three premises: (1) the existence of evil can be justified if the benefits following from essentially creating (quiddative) contingent beings massively outweigh the harms following from accidentally creating contrary relations (and eventually evil). Furthermore, (2) withholding an act whose benefits massively outweigh the harms following it, given an appropriate principle of proportionality, would imply massive evil. And (3), in fact the benefits following from essentially creating (quiddative) contingent beings massively outweigh the harms following from accidentally creating contrary relations (and eventually evil). These premises are intended to justify God\u2019s essential creation of contingent beings despite His knowledge of the ensuing evil.\n",
