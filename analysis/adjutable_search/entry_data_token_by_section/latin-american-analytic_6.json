    "main_text": "Development of Analytic Philosophy in Latin America || Other Countries\n2.5 Other Countries\n2.5.1 Peru\n\nAnalytic philosophy was introduced by Francisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada\nand Augusto Salazar Bondy at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San\nMarcos in\n Lima.[69]\n In 1946, Mir\u00f3 Quesada published one of the first textbooks of\nmathematical logic in Latin America. In subsequent work, he offered a\nformal analysis of the concept of understanding. He thought of\nphilosophy as having two sides: a systematic side that seeks to\ndevelop theories and a critical side that connects philosophy with\nsocial\n life.[70]\n In the 1980s, Mir\u00f3 Quesada and Alberto Cordero created a\nphilosophy program at the Universidad Cayetano de Heredia with a\nstrong concentration in philosophy of science (Vald\u00e9s and\nFern\u00e1ndez\n 2009).[71]\n\nSalazar Bondy published translations of Moore and Wittgenstein in 1961\nand, since the mid-1960s, a series of articles on evaluative language,\ncollected in his book Para una filosof\u00eda del valor\n (1971).[72]\n Subsequently, Salazar Bondy advocated for the liberation of Latin\nAmerican countries (Vald\u00e9s and Fern\u00e1ndez 2009) and\njoined a national committee to reform Peruvian education\n(Salmer\u00f3n 1991a).\n\nFrom 1963 to 1987, Edgar Guzm\u00e1n Jorquera worked at the\nUniversidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn. He defended the view that\nexistence is a predicate and tried to reconcile Tarski\u2019s\ndisquotational theory of truth with a correspondence theory of truth.\nHis papers were collected in a posthumous, two-volume book entitled\nExistencia y realidad (2002) (Quintanilla 2003).\n\nApart from these isolated philosophers who left no students, it is\nonly in the twentieth-first century that one finds a nascent analytic\ncommunity at two institutions in Peru. At the Pontificia Universidad\nCat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Pablo Quintanilla is the head of an\ninterdisciplinary group dedicated to the philosophies of language and\nmind (Grupo Mente y Lenguaje). V\u00edctor Krebs has\nconducted research on Wittgenstein and aesthetics. More recently,\nEduardo Villanueva has focused on philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of\n logic.[73]\n At the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, a small group led by\nOscar Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate created the Centro de estudios\nde filosof\u00eda anal\u00edtica (CESFIA) in 2006. CESFIA\nedits the journal Anal\u00edtica.\n2.5.2 Chile\n\nIn Chile, there has been a steady interest in mathematical logic since\nthe 1940s (Gracia 1984). Juan Rivano introduced symbolic logic in 1955\nand Gerold Stahl developed the area in the 1960s (Stahl 1956, 1960).\nRolando Chuaqui is, however, the most influential logician from Chile.\nIn Chuaqui (1965), he offered a novel interpretation of probability\nbased on the concepts of possibility and logical\n truth.[74]\n\nRoberto Torretti made an early impact with a well-regarded book on\nKant published in 1967. At that time, he also showed some interest in\nanalytic philosophy. He published review articles of Quine\u2019s\nFrom a Logical Point of View and Ayer\u2019s Logical\nPositivism and two articles on Wittgenstein (Torretti 1961,\n1968). Alfonso G\u00f3mez Lobo\u2014who had studied with Ernst\nTugendhat in Germany\u2014published a translation of texts by Frege\nin 1972. G\u00f3mez Lobo and Torretti were exiled to the United\nStates and Puerto Rico respectively.\n\nFrom the 1980s to the 1990s, there were only a couple of researchers\ndevoted to analytic philosophy in\n Chile.[75]\n It is noteworthy, however, that Ernst Tugendhat was a visiting\nprofessor at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile from\n1992 to 1996. During that time, he also gave many talks and lectures\nin other Latin American countries. These visits led to several\ntranslations of his works into Spanish that influenced the development\nof analytic philosophy in the Andean\n countries.[76]\n\nIn the twenty-first century, analytic philosophy in Chile has grown\nconsiderably. Many philosophers from younger generations have\ncompleted graduate studies abroad and joined Chilean universities\nafterwards. Some of these philosophers are Eduardo Fermandois\n(philosophy of language, Wittgenstein,\n metaphilosophy),[77]\n Wilfredo Quezada (logic, philosophy of mathematics), Andr\u00e9s\nBobenrieth (paraconsistent logics, logical pluralism, philosophy of\nlaw), Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Alvarado (metaphysics), Claudia\nMu\u00f1oz (philosophy of mind), Francisco Pereira (Hume,\nperception,\n consciousness),[78]\n and Pablo L\u00f3pez-Silva (philosophy of mind, philosophy of\npsychiatry). The recent growth of Chilean analytic philosophy is\nreflected in the organization of the Jornadas Rolando Chuaqui\nKettlun and the colloquium Lenguaje y\nCognici\u00f3n.\n2.5.3 Puerto Rico\n\nLudwig Schajowicz, an Austrian student of Karl B\u00fchler and Moritz\nSchlick, joined the Universidad de Puerto Rico as a visiting professor\nin 1947. Shortly after, he contributed to creating the Philosophy\nDepartment and the graduate program in philosophy. He also founded the\njournal Di\u00e1logos in\n 1964.[79]\n Roberto Torretti joined the Universidad de Puerto Rico in 1970 and\nworked there until his retirement. During his Puerto Rican phase, he\nwrote his two landmark studies in the history and philosophy of\nscience: Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to\nPoincar\u00e9 (1978) and Relativity and Geometry\n (1983).[80]\n Torretti also became the editor of Di\u00e1logos,\ntransforming it into one of the most prestigious journals in the\ncontinent (Dussel et al. 2009; Salmer\u00f3n 1991a). Some members of\nthe Philosophy Department at the Universidad de Puerto Rico have\npursued work in the analytic\n tradition.[81]\n2.5.4 Uruguay\n\nAlthough Carlos Vaz Ferreira is not clearly an analytic\n philosopher,[82]\n he influenced Latin American analytic philosophy in two ways. First,\nhis broad understanding of logic has had a late impact in the work of\nseveral Uruguayan philosophers with an analytic bent. Prominent\nexamples are Carlos Pereda and Eduardo Piacenza (Piacenza 2015).\nSecond, Vaz Ferreira promoted the creation of the Faculty of\nHumanities and Sciences at the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica in\n1946, where analytic philosophy developed a few years later. From 1953\nto 1974, Ezra Heymann\u2014a Kant scholar\u2014introduced Frege and\nAustin, and taught logic at the Universidad de la\n Rep\u00fablica.[83]\n During that same period, Mario Otero, who had previously spent some\ntime at the University at Buffalo in New York, went to Buenos Aires to\nwrite a PhD thesis under Mario Bunge\u2019s supervision, and then\ncontinued his postgraduate studies in Paris and the United States,\nwhere he worked with Quine and Putnam. Otero went into exile in Mexico\nfrom 1974 to 1980, where he contributed to the development of\nphilosophy of science at IIFs and Universidad Aut\u00f3noma\nMetropolitana-Iztapalapa. With the return of democracy, Otero went\nback to Uruguay, and focused on the history of logic and philosophy of\nscience. His student Luc\u00eda Leiwowicz has pursued the same line\nof research. Also exiled in the 1970s, never to return to Uruguay,\nwere Javier Sasso, Eduardo Piacenza, and Carlos Pereda. Sasso and\nPiacenza went to Venezuela and Pereda to IIFs (for further details,\nsee\n Section 2.5.5\n and\n Section 2.2).\n\nCurrently, the most prominent philosopher in Uruguay is Carlos Enrique\nCaorsi, who has worked in philosophy of language with an emphasis on\nDavidson\u2019s philosophy. There is also a new generation of\nphilosophers based at the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica working\nin philosophy of mind, cognitive science, deep disagreement,\nrationality, and scientific change. They include Victoria Lavorerio\nand Ignacio Cervieri. With Pablo Melogno, they created the Grupo\nde Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda\n(GESCyT).\n2.5.5 Venezuela\n\nIn the 1940s, Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca received an invitation to\ncreate the School of Philosophy at the Universidad Central de\nVenezuela, the first center for the professional study of philosophy\nin the country (Dussel et al. 2009). The school started its activities\nin 1946. Garc\u00eda Bacca, though not an analytic philosopher\nhimself, taught mathematical logic, philosophy of science, and\nintroduced some authors from the analytic tradition. Garc\u00eda\nBacca stayed there until his retirement in 1971.\n\nJuan Nu\u00f1o, one of Garc\u00eda Bacca\u2019s students, wrote\nsome analytic\n works.[84]\n In 1965, he published Sentido de la filosof\u00eda\ncontempor\u00e1nea (1965), where he offered an interpretation\nof Marxism and logical empiricism as transformative movements. Like\nhis Argentinian and Mexican peers, Nu\u00f1o saw analytic philosophy\nas a means to steer philosophy in the direction of a coherent and\nscientific investigation, and as a critical activity, opposing the\nconstruction of closed, philosophical\n systems.[85]\n In the 1970s, Nu\u00f1o was chair of the School of Philosophy.\nDuring those years, he and his colleagues founded a graduate program\nin logic and philosophy of science (1975), the journal Semestre de\nfilosof\u00eda (1977), and the Asociaci\u00f3n Venezolana\nde Epistemolog\u00eda (1979).\n\nIn the 1970s, several Uruguayan philosophers emigrated to Venezuela:\nEzra Heymann, Ernesto Battistella, Eduardo Piacenza, and Javier Sasso.\nBattistella published logic textbooks, and Selecci\u00f3n de\ntextos de Gottlob Frege (1971). He endorsed a view of philosophy\nas a critical activity and gave logic a central role as an instrument\nto clarify our imprecise concepts (Ramis 1978). Since the 1990s, there\nhas been a group of philosophers that still focus on mathematical\nlogic, set theory, and the foundations of\n mathematics.[86]\n Piacenza taught formal logic at different universities in Carabobo\nand Caracas. In the late 1980s, he moved away from formal logic, and\nfocused on argumentation\n theory.[87]\n While he was working at Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s\nBello, he created Cuadernos Venezolanos de Filosof\u00eda\nin 1989 and co-founded an MA program in philosophy. He also created a\nresearch group dedicated to the study of argumentation theory and\ninformal logic. That group is still\n active.[88]\n Sasso worked at various Venezuelan universities before being\nappointed at Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, where he worked\nfrom 1988 to 1997. He regularly taught Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein,\nRyle, Strawson, and other analytic philosophers. He was chair of the\nPhilosophy Department and the editor-in-chief of Revista\nVenezolana de Filosof\u00eda from 1993 to 1997. He combined his\nanalytic orientation with an interest in the history of Latin American\n philosophy.[89]\n\nVicenzo Lo Monaco studied with Garc\u00eda Bacca, Nu\u00f1o,\nHeymann, and Battistella. He has published articles and books in\nlogic, philosophy of language, methodology, and philosophy of science.\nHis work in philosophy of language focuses on Davidson\u2019s\nphilosophy, proper names, and ontological commitment. He re-founded\nthe journal Episteme NS in 1983, which progressively turned\nanalytic. From the same generation, Pedro Lluveres worked on the\nhistory of science and philosophy. He wrote a fine book entitled\nCiencia y escepticismo. Aproximaciones a Descartes\n(1976).\n\nSince the 1990s, there has been a group that conducts research in\nmathematical logic and set theory. It originates with Carlos di\nPrisco, a mathematician from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. His\nstudent Franklin Galindo introduced first-order logic and its\nmetatheory and various trends in philosophy of mathematics in the\nPhilosophy Department at the same university. Galindo\u2019s students\nhave pursued this line of research as\n well.[90]\n[91]\n2.5.6 Costa Rica\n\nAt the Universidad de Costa Rica, two analytic philosophers are worth\nmentioning: Claudio Guti\u00e9rrez and Luis Camacho.\nGuti\u00e9rrez developed most of his work from the late 1960s to the\nlate 1980s. He published mostly in logic, but also in epistemology,\nphilosophy of science, and AI (Guti\u00e9rrez 1974, 1982). Luis\nCamacho published reviews and articles on Wittgenstein and\nepistemology in the 1970s. Max Freund, from the next generation, has\nworked on the logics of sortals, modal logic, and on the logical,\ncomputational, and philosophical consequences of conceptualism (Freund\n1992, 2001, 2018). He has also contributed to the development of the\ngraduate program in cognitive science.\n\nThere are almost no visible traces of analytic philosophy\nin\u00a0Latin American countries not mentioned in this historical\n survey.[92]\n Their political, historical, and economic circumstances might explain\nthis absence. Some of those countries have endured the effects of\ncivil wars, dictatorships, and depressed economies. Under those\ncircumstances, the study of philosophy in any of its forms is not the\nfirst priority.\n3. Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers\n\nSection 2\n approached Latin American analytic philosophy from a historical\nperspective. This section presents some original contributions by\nanalytic philosophers working in the region regardless of any\ndiachronic considerations. It discusses three types of original\ncontributions: novel contributions to academic debates, novel\ncontributions to the public sphere, and autochthonous research\navenues. Novel contributions to academic debates include either\nuncommon but interesting claims that challenge entrenched views in\ninternational scholarship, or defenses of more traditional claims from\nunusual perspectives.\n Section 3.1\n presents some instances from the philosophies of language and mind.\nNovel contributions to the public sphere comprise applications of\nanalytic tools to address moral and political issues that are tied to\nthe sociopolitical circumstances of Latin American countries. Applied\nethics, bioethics, and philosophy of law are three areas where this\nform of originality can be found\n (Section 3.2).\n Finally, autochthonous research avenues refer to debates that\noriginated in Latin America and could have a significant impact\nworldwide.\n Section 3.3\n offers some examples from metaphilosophy.\n\nFor reasons of space, the following discussion is limited in three\nways. First, it does not cover some areas of analytic philosophy that\neither are insufficiently represented in the region (metaphysics) or\nare already covered by other entries (epistemology, logic, philosophy\nof science, political philosophy) (see the entries\n Philosophy of Science in Latin America,\n Epistemology in Latin America,\n Skepticism in Latin America,\n and\n Liberalism in Latin America).\n Second, it does not offer an exhaustive selection of contributions.\nThe aim is to present a small but representative sample. The\ninterested reader can find references to other significant\ncontributions in the footnotes. Third, it does not critically assess\nthe merits of each contribution. Instead, it provides sufficient\ninformation to show why each contribution is worthy of\nconsideration.\n3.1 Philosophy of Language and Mind\n\nMany Latin American analytic philosophers have joined the\nreferentialist movement that started with Barcan Marcus, Donnellan,\nPutnam, Kripke, Kaplan, and others.\n\nA key question for that movement concerns reference fixing: How do\n(uses of) linguistic expressions come to have the conventional\nreferents they have? G\u00f3mez-Torrente has offered accounts of\nreference fixing for widely discussed terms like definite descriptions\n(G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2015), proper names, demonstratives, and nouns\nfor natural kinds (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2019) and less discussed\nterms like Arabic numerals, color adjectives (G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2019), and quotations (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2013, 2017). His starting\npoint is a conception of human endeavors according to which\n\u201ctruth is something we pursue and very often achieve\u201d\n(G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2019, 9). Since truth depends on successful\nreference, a theory of reference should ensure that, in some central\nareas of discourse, our (uses of) linguistic expressions successfully\nrefer. To this end, one should think of the theory of reference as\nintertwined with metaphysics and epistemology. Metaphysically, one\nshould not think of the referents of referential expressions as\npeculiar and inaccessible entities. Epistemically, one should only\nposit reference-fixing conventions that humans can plausibly follow.\nAlthough shared reference-fixing conventions play a role in the\nexplanation of communication, one should not construe (many of) them\nas descriptive senses. Rather than trying to offer necessary and\nsufficient conditions that fix the reference of any possible use of an\nexpression, one should settle for conventions that provide roughly\nsufficient conditions for reference that work for some central uses\nand leave less central uses\n indeterminate.[93]\n\nMarco Ruffino has made another contribution to the referentialist\nmovement. Kripke (1980) famously argued that his views on proper names\nmade room for contingent truths that are a priori knowable. Let\n\u201cS\u201d be a particular stick used to conventionally\nestablish what we call \u201cmeter\u201d and\n\u201ct0\u201d the time at which the convention\nwas established. Consider now an utterance of (M):\n\n(M)\nThe length of S at t0 is one meter\nlong.\n\n\nFor Kripke, (M) expresses a contingent truth because S could\nbe longer or shorter than it actually is. And it is a priori knowable\nbecause the baptizer only needs to know the convention expressed by\n\u201cthe length of S at\nt0\u201d\u2014with no reliance on experience. A\nproblem for Kripke\u2019s view arises when one asks a metaphysical\nquestion: If (M) refers to an independently existing truth-maker, how\ncould one possibly know it a priori? Ruffino (2022) has tried to meet\nthis challenge by taking seriously the idea that many contingent a\npriori truths arise from stipulations. Building on speech-act theory,\nRuffino submits that cases like (M) originate from a specific type of\nspeech act that creates its own truth-maker. Consider a priest\u2019s\nutterance of \u201cI declare you husband and wife\u201d. If\nsuccessful, this declarative illocutionary act (Searle and Vanderveken\n1985) \u201cautomatically creates an alignment between word and world\n[\u2026] because the act itself brings about a new fact that\nverifies it\u201d (Ruffino 2022, 161). Since this new fact does not\nexist independently of the stipulation, there is no mystery as to how\nit could be known a\n priori.[94]\n\nReferential views like G\u00f3mez-Torrente\u2019s and\nRuffino\u2019s face a problem: many of the expressions whose\nreference they have tried to elucidate have non-referential uses. This\nproblem has led many authors to reject the traditional view of proper\nnames, indexicals, and demonstratives as referential expressions. For\nexample, some authors have argued that complex demonstratives are\nquantificational phrases (King 2000; Neale 2008; Lepore and Ludwig\n2000), and others have claimed that proper names are common nouns or\npredicates (Burge 1973; Fara 2015). Ezcurdia (2017, 2022) develops a\nreferential view that tackles the problem of non-referential uses.\nAccording to her referential functionalism, what makes an\nexpression referential is its function. More specifically,\ne is a referential expression just in case e has the\nfunction of communicating singular thoughts. On Ezcurdia\u2019s view,\nthis function explains why humans still employ proper names,\nindexicals, and demonstratives. Given that a function can go\nunfulfilled, referential expressions can have non-referential uses as\nwell. Ezcurdia\u2019s referential functionalism has two consequences:\nreferential expressions are systematically ambiguous, and a\nsemantically complex expression like \u201cthat taco\u201d can be\ngenuinely\n referential.[95]\n\nSlurs have also featured in recent Latin American philosophy of\nlanguage. A slur like \u201cspic\u201d is a word that conveys\nderogatory feelings for members of a certain group of people. Orlando\nand Saab (2019, 2020a, 2020b) defend a version of a dual analysis of\nparadigmatic slurs. Following Kaplan (1999), they associate slurs with\na dualistic semantics: a truth-conditional meaning and an expressive\n meaning.[96]\n What distinguishes their view from others is their account of\nexpressive meaning. They think of expressive meaning as determined by\na culturally determined stereotype, i.e., a set of schematic,\nsimple-minded, oversimplified, and mostly false beliefs involving a\nprejudicial view of the corresponding group. Thus, the stereotype for\n\u201cspic\u201d is a complex concept that encodes a global negative\nvalence: illegal, with a spanish accent, poor,\nuntrustworthy, family-oriented, good dancer, prone to laziness,\n etc.[97]\n Orlando and Saab model those stereotypes on Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(1953) notion of family resemblance. Thus, stereotypes do not offer\nnecessary and sufficient conditions that determine the corresponding\n extensions.[98]\n[99]\n\nSeveral Latin American philosophers have investigated the role of\nlanguage in the human mind. Their work has been influenced by\nWittgenstein and, in some cases, by empirical findings from cognitive\nscience.\n\nAt least since Black (1955), analytic philosophers have tried to\nexplain how metaphors work. Fermandois (2000, 2008, 2009, 2010) argues\nthat many analytic accounts of metaphor have trouble explaining our\nunderstanding and cognitive uses of \u201cstrong metaphors\u201d.\nVery roughly, strong metaphors are highly surprising and rich, so they\ncannot be easily paraphrased in a finite number of\n sentences.[100]\n An example of a strong metaphor is Wittgenstein\u2019s view of\nlanguage as a toolbox. While semantic accounts explain metaphor by\npositing a change in the meaning of sentences, pragmatic accounts rely\non Gricean intentions (Grice 1989) and speech acts (Searle 1969) to\nderive a few, true propositional contents from the literal content\nassociated with an utterance of a sentence. Insofar as these\napproaches depict metaphoric interpretation as an almost automatic\nderivation of a few propositional contents, they have a hard time\naccommodating the open-ended character of strong metaphors and the\nactive role of the interpreter in building an adequate interpretation\nof those metaphors. They also overlook two important features of\nstrong metaphors, namely, that they invite the formation of further\nmetaphoric thoughts and routinely exploit non-propositional elements\nlike experiences of \u201cseeing-as\u201d and emotions. In a more\npositive vein, Fermandois offers a characterization of strong\nmetaphors as tools that show new ways of seeing things, suggesting\nthat this role is best served if one reintroduces non-propositional\nelements, and supplements those non-propositional elements with a\nsui generis form of non-propositional, context-bound\ncorrectness.\n\nIn many everyday conversations, a hearer can automatically, fluently,\nand directly determine the intuitive truth-conditions of an utterance\nmade in their mother tongue. Leclerc (2009, 2012) has made some\ncontributions to the elucidation of this phenomenon, which he dubs\n\u201cspontaneous linguistic understanding\u201d (SLU). To begin\nwith, he offers a contrastive characterization of SLU. He contends\nthat SLU is a kind of occurrent understanding that differs from other\nphenomena, such as the understanding one can get from a foreign\nlanguage one does not fully understand or the \u201cdetached\u201d\nknowledge one can acquire of the content of an utterance from a\ntranslator. Furthermore, Leclerc argues that two influential programs,\nDavidson\u2019s (1984) and Grice\u2019s (1989), are inadequate to\ncharacterize the competences underlying SLU. Finally, building on\nideas from other philosophers, he offers the bare bones of an account\nof the competences underlying SLU. Very roughly, SLU is a kind of\noccurrent understanding that involves experience, it is not\nunderwritten by propositional knowledge but by a battery of\ndispositions, and it is ultimately grounded in human understanding of\nactions and\n situations.[101]\n\nWhat are the most distinctive features of human languages? Scotto\n(2017, 2019a, 2019b, 2020) thinks that human languages are\nmultimodal and semiotically heterogeneous systems. A\nlong-standing view thinks of speech as linked to a single modality:\nsound production in speakers and audition in hearers. Building on\nfindings from cognitive science and an original reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on meaning experiences, Scotto argues\nthat the unimodal view overlooks the key role of vision and hands in\nthe use of facial expressions and gestures in everyday communication,\nbodily posture, and speakers\u2019 proprioception of the muscles,\ntongue, and lips they use in the production of speech. Her focus on\nthe multimodal character of human languages casts doubts on some\nentrenched views of language. Consider one such view. If one thinks of\nlanguage production and interpretation as unimodal, it is tempting to\nendorse the view that words are linked to their contents by convention\n(as did Hockett 1960, Locke 1690, and de Saussure 1983). But, if\nlanguages exploit many other modalities with higher iconic potential,\nit is more plausible to think of large portions of languages as\nconnecting with their referents and the emotions they express through\nvarious forms of similarity between signs, referents, and the users of\nthose\n signs.[102]\n[103]\n\nSince Premack and Woodroff (1978), many philosophers, ethologists,\ncognitive scientists, and neuroscientists have investigated the human\nabilities involved in the way we understand each other in everyday\nlife. During the boom of cognitivism, the Theory-Theory and the\nSimulation Theory monopolized the discussion (Davies and Stone 1995;\nCarruthers and Smith 1996). From a post-cognitivist perspective,\nP\u00e9rez (2005a, 2005b, 2013) defends a Wittgensteinian approach\nto psychological concepts and supplements it with a pre-linguistic\nunderstanding of the mental in second-person interactions. Her\nanalysis of those interactions gives a pride of place to psychological\nstates other than belief and insists on the diversity of mental\nstates. This account has some important consequences. Consider\nJackson\u2019s (1982) case of Mary, the brilliant scientist who\napparently learns something new when she leaves her black-and-white\nroom and sees a red apple (see the entry\n Qualia: The Knowledge Argument).\n A popular response says that Mary acquires a phenomenal concept she\npreviously lacked (Alter and Walter 2006). P\u00e9rez (2011) offers\nan account of the possession conditions of phenomenal concepts that\nexplains why Mary lacked the relevant phenomenal concept before she\nleft the room. In joint work with Gomila (P\u00e9rez and Gomila\n2022), P\u00e9rez offers a post-cognitivist, empirically informed\naccount of the second-person perspective as fundamental to the\ndevelopment of mental concepts where emotions and direct perception\nplay a key\n role.[104]\n[105]\n\nMany analytic philosophers active in Latin America have joined the\ndebate on the nature of phenomenal consciousness.\n\nWhen you see a red patch, there is something it is like for you to\nundergo that experience (Nagel 1974). Many theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness have focused on the problem of qualities, which consists\nin characterizing the qualitative character that distinguishes an\nexperience as of a red patch from\u2014let us say\u2014an experience\nas of listening to a birdsong. Sebasti\u00e1n (2012, 2020,\nforthcoming) has focused on an equally important but less discussed\nissue, namely, the fact that experiences have subjective character. He\nhas put forward two hypotheses. First, if one unpacks the subjectivity\nof experience in representational terms, one will be able to use\nconceptual tools from teleosemantic theories of content to offer a\nnaturalistic explanation of subjective character (see the entry\n Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n Second, if one analyzes the representational content of subjective\ncharacter as a perspectival de se representation analogous to\nthat put forward by Lewis (1979), one will be able to offer an\naccurate characterization of altered states of consciousness and draw\na boundary between conscious and unconscious processes.\n\nAnother topic of interest has been metacognition. Consider the\nfollowing example. Just after the host of a TV show asks,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Bolivia?\u201d, Anna rushes to\npress the button before she has even retrieved the answer. Her action\nwas motivated by a \u201cfeeling of knowing\u201d. This and other\n\u201cmetacognitive feelings\u201d have been studied in cognitive\nscience for decades. However, philosophers only started to\nsystematically examine them in the 2000s (Dokic 2012; Proust 2012).\nArango-Mu\u00f1oz (2014a) has contributed to this research program\nby offering a unified account of metacognitive feelings that\nsynthetizes earlier work. On his view, metacognitive feelings are\nintentional experiences whose object is not transparent to the\nsubject, they come in non-conceptual and conceptual forms, and they\nare underwritten by heuristic mechanisms. His work has opened up new\nresearch avenues. For example, given the opacity of their intentional\nobject, metacognitive feelings challenge intentionalist views\naccording to which the phenomenal character of experiences supervenes\non their representational contents (Dretske 2006; Tye 2000).\nMetacognitive feelings can also explain how one manages to efficiently\nemploy external cognitive devices. To illustrate, when one is asked\nwhat the capital of Bolivia is, one must decide whether one retrieves\nthe information from memory or does a Google search.\nArango-Mu\u00f1oz (2013) thinks that this decision is modulated by\nthe presence or absence of the feeling of\n knowing.[106]\n[107]\n\nIn philosophy of action, rationalists hold that agency consists in\nacting for reasons, where reasons are understood thinly as an\nagent\u2019s preferences at the time of acting (Audi 1979; Davidson\n1980; Lewis 1989). Amaya (2013) argues that slips are counterexamples\nto this view. To illustrate, imagine that Axel has the intention to\ndrop his child at the daycare on the way to work. However, without\nchanging his mind, Axel winds up doing something else: he goes\nstraight to his office and leaves the child unattended for the entire\nworkday. A few hours later, his child has died of hyperthermia. On the\nassumption that Axel is a good parent who cares for his child, his\naction does not reveal his preferences at the time. Amaya thinks that\ncases like this one are performance mistakes, i.e., mistakes that\narise in the implementation of an agent\u2019s intention. His\nanalysis gives rise to important questions of cognitive architecture:\nWhat are the roles of capacities such as working memory, attention,\nand vigilance in performance mistakes? Also, questions of\nresponsibility: Given that we hold Axel responsible for his\nnegligence, slips put pressure on the so-called \u201cepistemic\ncondition for moral responsibility\u201d, i.e., the idea that moral\nresponsibility requires awareness of what one is doing, its\nconsequences, or its moral significance (Amaya and Doris 2015; Amaya\n2022). After all, these forms of awareness are absent in Axel\u2019s\nslip and other cases of negligence (but see Rudy-Hiller 2019 for\n criticism).[108]\n3.2 Applied Ethics, Bioethics, and Philosophy of Law\n\nLatin American analytic philosophers have made important contributions\nto ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of law (for overviews,\nsee Rivera L\u00f3pez 2010; Navarro 2010; V\u00e1squez 2012; and\nthe entry\n Liberalism in Latin America).\n This section presents a few contributions that apply analytic tools\nto address moral and political issues that are tied to the\nsociopolitical circumstances of Latin American countries.\n\nAbortion is not legal in most Latin American countries. Indeed, many\nwomen have died or been imprisoned due to this fact. However, abortion\nwas legalized in Mexico City in 2007 and decriminalized by the\nNational Supreme Court of Justice in 2021. Some analytic philosophers\nhave played a role in this change. Vald\u00e9s (2002) critically\nexamines the arguments of the Catholic Church against abortion. In\nVald\u00e9s (2001), she calls the public\u2019s attention to the\nproblems that arise from child and adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy\nthat results from rape. She also offers a critical assessment of the\nmain arguments for and against the legalization of abortion. She\ndistinguishes three concepts of a person (a biological concept, a\nconcept related to a potential person, and a moral concept of a\nperson), and argues that the concept of a person implicit in pro-life\nviews\u2014namely, that a person is present at the very moment of\nconception\u2014is not the moral concept that matters to this\n debate.[109]\n\nFlorencia Luna\u2019s views on vulnerability have been influential in\nbioethics. For many years, codes of ethics and research ethics\ntheories adopted a subpopulation approach. They used vulnerability\nas a label to refer to subjects of\nsome groups: women, racial minorities, the poor, the very sick, and so\non. This approach was subject to severe criticism, though. Some\nobjected that it promotes the creation of stereotypes that cannot be\neasily removed, and that reliance on labels does not offer sufficient\nprotection to vulnerable subjects. After all, it only exhorts\nresearchers and ethics committees to pay special attention to members\nof those groups when recruiting them as subjects in their studies.\nLuna (2004, 2009, 2019a) develops an account of vulnerability\nthat avoids these problems. On her\nview, vulnerability is a \u201clayered\nconcept\u201d: one and the same subject can have one or several\nlayers of vulnerability, those layers are not only determined by the\nsubject\u2019s membership in a group but also by their own context,\nand those layers can be modified and\u2014in some\ncases\u2014removed. Hence, being a woman does not entail per\nse being vulnerable. However, being a woman living in a country\nthat is intolerant to reproductive rights confers on that woman one\nlayer of vulnerability. If, on top of that, that woman is poor, she\nhas an extra layer of vulnerability. And so on. Since the layered\nconcept does not work as a label that singles out an essential\nproperty of members of some groups, it does not promote the creation\nof stereotypes. Given that the layered account does not treat vulnerability\nas a general and fixed category, it\nenables researchers to develop fine-grained analyses of specific\nlayers of vulnerability and\u2014on a case-by-case basis\u2014take\neffective action to mitigate them. For example, in a given country,\nwomen may have trouble negotiating the use of condoms with their\npartners. In such cases, the use of the female condom is not an\noption. Other contraceptive methods that preserve the secrecy that\nwomen may desire would be preferable. However, the use of those\ncontraceptive methods might not mitigate another layer of\nvulnerability, namely, the risk of HIV-AIDS\n infection.[110]\n\nCarlos Nino is the main representative of the Argentinian school of\nphilosophy of law. His influential work on human rights was a response\nto the human rights violations perpetrated by the \u201cmilitary\njuntas\u201d that governed the country from 1976 to 1983: thousands\nof people were tortured, assassinated, and subject to enforced\ndisappearance. As an advisor of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn\u2014the\nArgentinian president from 1983 to 1989\u2014, Nino helped designing\nnew laws to promote human rights and prevent their violation and\ndevelop a strategy to punish the militaries responsible for human\nrights violations during the dictatorship (Malem Se\u00f1a 1994).\nNino\u2019s philosophical work provided a theoretical framework to\njustify these\n programs.[111]\n Moreover, Nino himself played a decisive role in their\n implementation.[112]\n Nino defended a form of moral constructivism according to which\nmorality is a social practice that seeks to overcome conflicts and\nfavor cooperation through consensus. He thought of moral practice as a\ndiscourse where individuals freely accept principles to guide their\nactions and attitudes towards the actions of others. Those principles\nenjoy an intrinsic validity that could be used to confer final\njustification on human rights independently of any legal order. He\nproposed a principle of the inviolability of the person,\nwhich prohibits the imposition on humans\u2014against their\nwill\u2014of sacrifices and privations that do not lead to their own\nbenefit, a principle of autonomy of the person, which\nemphasizes a person\u2019s capacity to choose freely a model of life\nand imposes a limit on any interventions by the State and others, and\na principle of the dignity of the person, which says that\nhumans should be treated in accordance with their own decisions,\nintentions, or manifestations of consent. These three principles,\ndevised in the 1970s and developed in Nino (1984), offered the\ntheoretical foundation for Alfons\u00edn\u2019s legal reforms to\npromote human rights and prevent their\n violation.[113]\n As for past violations of human rights by the State, Alfons\u00edn\nand his collaborators created a committee to inquire into those crimes\n(Comisi\u00f3n Nacional sobre la Desaparici\u00f3n de\nPersonas, CONADEP) and urged the competent bodies to prosecute\nand condemn some of the militaries responsible for those crimes (the\n\u201cJuicio a las\n Juntas\u201d).[114]\n They faced a problem, though: there were so many people involved in\nthose human rights violations that trying to prosecute them all\ninvolved a serious risk of destabilizing the fragile democratic\ninstitutions and provoking a military coup. Nino\u2019s\n(1985, 1991b) views on punishment proved useful. Given a retributivist\nconception of punishment, the right thing to do was to punish them\nall. However, Nino opposed that view on the ground that the sum of two\nills (the offender\u2019s act and the punishment) could not give rise\nto a good. His alternative view was instrumentalist. If punishment was\na means to prevent future human rights violations, one could attain\nthat goal by punishing a select number of responsible\n agents.[115]\n\nThe presence of indigenous peoples in Latin America has given rise to\npolitical, social, and cultural tensions. In the 1990s, the Mexican\nphilosopher Luis Villoro joined the Zapatist movement against the\nexploitation, discrimination, and oppression that indigenous peoples\nhad suffered for more than 500\n years.[116]\n In a 1997 book, he defended a novel conception of the State inspired\nby the idea of community, a form of organization that is key to\nindigenous peoples. In this form of social organization, power is\nconstrained by value and the individual is conceived as part of a\ncollectivity, without any relation of domination or subordination of\none entity to\n another.[117]\n In a subsequent 2007 book, Villoro defended a moderate\nmulticulturalism that sought to reconcile the universality of human\nrights with the respect and tolerance of cultural diversity. He also\ndefended a communitarian democracy and urged national states to\nrespect the self-determination of indigenous peoples.\n\nMore recently, some Latin American analytic philosophers have\ncontributed to the global discussion about the distribution of\nvaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped develop protocols\nfor the allocation of scarce therapeutic resources (triage),\nand have discussed the social organization of science during the\n pandemic.[118]\n3.3 Metaphilosophy\n\nWhen analytic philosophy was introduced in the region, it generated an\nintellectual revolution. So, it is no wonder that many Latin American\nanalytic philosophers devoted their efforts to thinking about\nmetaphilosophical issues such as the methods and nature of philosophy,\nthe social role of philosophy, and more. This section presents two\nmetaphilosophical issues: professionalization and the language of\nphilosophy.\n\nSeveral Latin American philosophers thought of analytic philosophy as\na tool to professionalize philosophy\n (Section 2).\n Against this view, Rabossi (2008) presents some heterodox hypotheses\nabout philosophy as a discipline. For example, it is tempting to think\nof philosophy as a discipline that has been practiced for centuries.\nRabossi rejects this picture: on the basis of a detailed historical\nreconstruction, he argues that philosophy as it is practiced today is\nthe result of a split between philosophy and other theoretical\ndisciplines in Germany in the nineteenth century. Thus, far from\nhaving an essence that has been preserved for centuries, philosophy as\nwe know it today is a historically contingent\n practice.[119]\n\nIn recent years, other Latin American philosophers have seen the\nprofessionalization of philosophy with suspicion. Hurtado (2012)\nargues that professionalization led analytic philosophers to try to\n\u201cadjust a small screw in a piece of machinery\u201d, and\nneglect long-standing questions about human existence, the use of\nphilosophical tools to improve one\u2019s life, and the historical,\ncultural, and social context in which one does philosophy in Latin\nAmerican countries. Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2012) replies to Hurtado\nby offering examples where professionalization in the analytic\ntradition has led to philosophical progress about longstanding\nproblems. Quintanilla (2013) responds that the problems Hurtado\nassociates with professionalization are not specific to analytic\nphilosophy. They are not only widespread but also due to the research\npolicies that dominate global research institutions both in the\nhumanities and the social and natural sciences.\n\nLast but not least, Latin American analytic philosophers have\ndiscussed the role of language in philosophical practice. Analytic\nphilosophy has developed for the most part in English-speaking\ncountries, most analytic works are published in English, and\nglobalization has compelled Latin American analytic philosophers to\nproduce philosophy in English. These facts raise the question of\nwhether Latin American philosophers should abandon their native\nlanguage (Spanish or Portuguese) when they do philosophy.\nRodr\u00edguez-Pereyra (2013) and Ruffino (2013) think that\npragmatic professional reasons speak in favor of using English as the\nnew Latin, i.e., a new lingua franca for analytic philosophy.\nP\u00e9rez (2013b) and Hurtado (2013) object that this pragmatic\nstance overlooks the political, cultural, linguistic, contextual, and\nexperiential dimensions of language use. To illustrate, the choice of\na specific language can prompt hasty generalizations from a given\nlanguage that do not automatically hold for other\n languages.[120]\n A way of avoiding those hasty generalizations is to retain the use of\na plurality of languages in\n philosophy.[121]\n Moreover, the pragmatic argument hinges on a controversial view of\nthe language-thought interface. If natural languages are not only\ntools to communicate ready-made ideas, but media within which humans\nshape their own ideas, then the choice of a language can ultimately\nhave an impact on whether some ideas gain currency and others not.\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAnalytic philosophy in Latin America has reached a considerable degree\nof originality and impact. The more stable democratic political\nregimes of the past forty years have also promoted research, freedom\nof expression, and critical thought. Globalization and new\ntechnologies have further contributed to this development.\n\nIn the early days, Latin American analytic philosophers were mostly\ninterested in interacting with their Anglo-Saxon peers. That relation\nwas usually asymmetric. In the last two decades or so, the situation\nhas started to change. Many Latin American analytic philosophers have\nstarted to strengthen their links with their Latin American peers and\nestablish more symmetric relations. The first steps were taken with\nthe organization of small workshops where Anglo-Saxon and Latin\nAmerican philosophers exchanged ideas and discussed each other\u2019s\nwork as equals. In 2006, the project of creating a regional\nassociation for analytic philosophy emerged in Mexico City, when Maite\nEzcurdia introduced the idea to other Latin American colleagues. As a\nresult, the Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Filosof\u00eda\nAnal\u00edtica (ALFAn) was created in 2007. ALFAn has so far\norganized six meetings in different countries. Additionally, it has\nongoing projects to mentor new generations of philosophers and\nincrease the discussion of analytic works produced within the\nregion.",
