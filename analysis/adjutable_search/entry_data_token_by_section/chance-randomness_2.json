The best examples of probability functions that\nmeet the principles about chance are those provided by our best\nphysical theories. In particular, the probability functions that\nfeature in radioactive decay and quantum mechanics have some claim to\nbeing chance functions. In orthodox approaches to quantum mechanics,\nsome measurements of a system in a given state will not yield a result\nthat represents a definite feature of that prior state (Albert 1992).\nSo, for example, an \\(x\\)-spin measurement on a system in a\ndeterminate \\(y\\)-spin state will not yield a determinate result\nreflecting some prior state of \\(x\\)-spin, but rather has a 0.5\nprobability of resulting in \\(x\\)-spin \\(= +1\\), and a 0.5 probability\nof resulting in \\(x\\)-spin \\(= -1\\). That these measurement\nresults cannot reflect any prior condition of the system is a\nconsequence of various no-hidden variables theorems, the most\nfamous of which is Bell\u2019s theorem (Bell 1964; see the entry on Bell\u2019s\n theorem,\n Shimony 2009).\n Bell\u2019s theorem\nshows that the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics, and\nexperimentally confirmed, for spin measurements on a two-particle\nentangled but spatially separated system cannot be equal to the joint\nprobabilities of two independent one-particle systems. The upshot is\nthat the entangled system cannot be represented as the product of two\nindependent localised systems with determinate prior \\(x\\)-spin\nstates. Therefore, there can be no orthodox local account of these\nprobabilities of measurement outcomes as reflecting our ignorance of a\nhidden quality found in half of the systems, so that the probabilities\nare in fact basic features of the quantum mechanical systems\n themselves.[4]\n\n\nThe standard way of understanding this is that something\u2014the\nprocess of measurement, on the Copenhagen interpretation, or\nspontaneous collapse on the GRW theory\u2014induces a\nnon-deterministic state transition, called collapse, into a\nstate in which the system really is in a determinate state with respect\nto a given quality (though it was not previously). These transition\nprobabilities are dictated entirely by the state and the process of\ncollapse, which allows these probabilities to meet the stable trial\nprinciple. The models of standard quantum mechanics explicitly permit\ntwo systems prepared in identical states to evolve via collapse into\nany state which has a non-zero prior probability in the original state,\nwhich permits these probabilities to meet the BCP. And the no-hidden\nvariables theorems strongly suggest that there is no better information\nabout the system to guide credence in future states than the chances,\nwhich makes these probabilities play the right role in the PP. These\nbasic quantum probabilities governing state transitions seem to be\nstrong candidates to be called chances.\n\n\nThe foregoing argument makes essential use of collapse. The\nexistence of collapse as an alternative rule governing the evolution of\nthe quantum state controversial, and it is a scandal of quantum\nmechanics that we have no satisfactory understanding of why collapse\n(or measurement) should give rise to basic probabilities. But that\nsaid, the existence of well-confirmed probabilistic theories which\ncannot be plausibly reduced to any non-probabilistic theory is some\nevidence that there are chances. (Though the Everettian\n(\u2018many-worlds\u2019) program of generating quantum probabilities\nfrom subjective uncertainty, without basic chance in the present sense,\nhas recently been gaining adherents\u2014see Barrett 1999; Wallace\n2007.) Indeed, it looks like the strongest kind of evidence that there\nare chances. For if our best physical theories did not feature\nprobabilities, we should have little reason to postulate them, and\nlittle reason to take chances to exist. This will become important\nbelow\n (\u00a75),\n when we discuss classical physics.\nThe conventional view of classical physics, including statistical\nmechanics, is that it does not involve basic probability (because the\nstate transition dynamics is deterministic), and is not accordingly a\ntheory that posits chances (Loewer\n 2001).[5]\n Below, we will examine\nthis view, as well as some of the recent challenges to this\nconventional view. But there is at least enough evidence from\nfundamental physics for the existence of chances for us to adopt it\nalready at this point as a defensible assumption.\n",
