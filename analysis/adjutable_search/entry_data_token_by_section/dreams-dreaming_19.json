    "main_text": "The meaning of dreams and the functions of dreaming || The functions of dreaming\n6.2 The functions of dreaming\n\nDifferent theories on the functions of dreaming have been proposed and\nthe debate is ongoing. An important distinction is between the\nfunctions of sleep stages and the functions of dreaming.\nWell-documented functions of REM sleep include thermoregulation and\nthe development of cortical structures in birds and mammals, as well\nas neurotransmitter repletion, the reconstruction and maintenance of\nlittle-used brain circuits, the structural development of the brain in\nearly developmental phases, as well as the preparation of a repertoire\nof reflexive or instinctive behaviors (Hobson 2009). Yet none of these\nfunctions are obviously linked to dreaming. An exception is\nprotoconsciousness theory, in which REM sleep plays an important role\nin foetal development by providing a virtual world model\n even before the emergence of full-blown consciousness (Hobson 2009: 808).\n\nNumerous studies have investigated the contribution of sleep to memory\nconsolidation, with different sleep stages promoting different types\nof memories (Diekelmann et al. 2009; Walker 2009). However, only a few\nstudies have investigated the relationship between dream content and\nmemory consolidation in sleep (for a review, see Nielsen &\nStenstrom 2005). Dreams rarely involve episodic replay of waking\nmemories (Fosse et al. 2003). The incorporation of memory sources\nseems to follow a specific temporal pattern in which recent memories\nare integrated with older but semantically related memories (Blagrove\net al. 2011). Nielsen (2017) presents a model of how external and\nbodily stimuli on one hand and short- and long-term memories on the\nother hand form seemingly novel, complex, and dreamlike images at\nsleep onset; he proposes these microdreams shed light on the formation\nand sources of more complex dreams. There is also some evidence that\ndream imagery might be associated with memory consolidation and task\nperformance after sleep, though this is preliminary (Wamsley &\nStickgold 2009, 2010; Wamsley et al. 2010).\n\nProminent theories on the function of dreaming focus on bad dreams and\nnightmares. It has long been thought that dreaming contributes to\nemotional processing and that this is particularly obvious in the\ndreams of nightmare sufferers or in dreams following traumatic\nexperiences (e.g., Hartmann 1998; Nielsen & Lara-Carrasco 2007;\nLevin & Nielsen 2009; Cartwright 2010; Perogamvros et al. 2013).\nBased on the high prevalence of negative emotions and threatening\ndream content, threat simulation theory suggests that the evolutionary\nfunction of dreaming lies in the simulation of ancestral threats and\nthe rehearsal of threatening events and avoidance skills in dreams has\nan adaptive value by enhancing the individual\u2019s chances of\nsurvival (see Revonsuo 2000; Valli 2008). A more recent proposal is\nsocial simulation theory, in which social imagery in dreams supports\nsocial cognition, bonds, and social skills. (Revonsuo et al.\n2015).\n\nAn evolutionary perspective can also be fruitfully applied to specific\naspects of dream phenomenology. According to the vigilance\nhypothesis, natural selection disfavored the occurrence of those\ntypes of sensations during sleep that would compromise vigilance\n(Symons 1993). Dream sounds, but also smells or pains might distract\nattention from the potentially dangerous surroundings of the sleeping\nsubject, and the vigilance hypothesis predicts that they only rarely\noccur in dreams without causing awakening. By contrast, because most\nmammals sleep with their eyes closed and in an immobile position,\nvivid visual and movement hallucinations during sleep would not\ncomprise vigilance and thus can occur in dreams without endangering\nthe sleeping subject. Focusing on the stuff dreams are not\nmade of might then be at least as important for understanding the\nfunction of dreaming as developing a positive account.\n\nFinally, even if dreaming in general and specific types of dream\ncontent in particular were found to be strongly associated with\nspecific cognitive functions, it would still be possible that dreams\nare mere epiphenomena of brain activity during sleep (Flanagan 1995,\n2000). It is also possible that the function of dreams is not knowable\n(Springett 2019).\n\nA particular problem for any theory on the function of dreaming is to\nexplain why a majority of dreams are forgotten and how dreams can\nfulfill their putative function independently of recall. Crick and\nMitchinson (1983) famously proposed that REM sleep\n\u201cerases\u201d or deletes surplus information and unnecessary\nmemories, which would suggest that enhanced dream recall is\ncounterproductive. Another problem is that dreaming can be lost\nselectively and independently of other cognitive deficits (Solms 1997,\n2000).\n\nSome of the problems that arise for theories on the functions of\ndreaming can be avoided if we do not assume that dreaming has a\nspecific function, separate from the function(s) of conscious wakeful\nstates. This depends on the broader taxonomy of dreaming in relation\nto wakeful states. For example, if dreaming is continuous with waking\nmind wandering, imagination, and/or own-body perception, we should not\nexpect it to have a unique function, but rather to express a similar\nfunction as these wakeful states, perhaps to varying degrees. Nor\nshould we expect dreams to have a single function; the functions of\ndreaming might be as varied and complex as those of consciousness, and\ngiven the complexity of the target phenomenon, the failure to pin down\na single function should not be surprising (Windt 2015a).\n",
