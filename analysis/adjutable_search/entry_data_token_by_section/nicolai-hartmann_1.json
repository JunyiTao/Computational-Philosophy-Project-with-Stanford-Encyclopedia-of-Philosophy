    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nThree English translations of major book-length works have appeared\nwithin the last ten years, adding to the two existing translations and\nreissues of New Ways of Ontology (Hartmann 2012b [1953]) and\nthe Ethics (Hartmann 2003, 2004 [1932]), originally published\nearlier in the twentieth century. Volumes one and two of his ontology,\nOntology: Laying the Foundations (2019a [1935]) and\nPossibility and Actuality (2013 [1938]), as well as the\nposthumous Aesthetics (2014 [1953]), have been completed. New\ntranslations of shorter works include \u201cHow is Critical Ontology\nPossible?\u201d (Hartmann 2012a [1924]), \u201cThe Megarian and the\nAristotelian Concept of Possibility\u201d (Hartmann 2017 [1937]), an\nobituary for Max Scheler (Hartmann 2019b [1928]), and Hartmann\u2019s\n1914 review of the first volume of Husserl\u2019s Jahrbuch\n(Hartmann 2018). Other translations will no doubt be produced in the\ncoming years.\n\nEnglish readers have only a handful of book-length treatments of\nHartmann\u2019s thought to consult (Peterson and Poli 2016; Poli,\nScognamiglio, and Tremblay 2011; Kelly 2011; Werkmeister 1990;\nCadwallader 1984; and Mohanty 1957). For German readers, Martin\nMorgenstern\u2019s Nicolai Hartmann: Zur Einf\u00fchrung\n(1997) provides a comprehensive, if very brief, introduction, and\nWolfgang Harich\u2019s two works Nicolai Hartmann: Leben, Werk,\nWirkung (2000), as well as Nicolai Hartmann: Gr\u00f6sse und\nGrenzen (2002), provide unparalleled insights into the life and\nwork of Hartmann.\n\nWhile he wrote at length and with significant originality on\nepistemology, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of history, natural and\nsocial science, and many other topics, Hartmann\u2019s central\npreoccupation was with developing a new ontology adequate to the\nchanged scientific and humanistic intellectual landscape of the early\ntwentieth century. Since Hartmann himself indicated 1919 as the year\nhe finally broke through to what he called his \u201cnew\nontology\u201d (Harich 2000, 9), we could divide his voluminous work\ninto two periods: an earlier Neo-Kantian inflected period, and a later\nperiod defined by the new ontology. But even this line is difficult to\ndraw cleanly. The published works for his degree referred to above\nfall clearly into the earlier period, while some early essays, such as\n\u201cSystematische Methode\u201d (1912) and \u201c\u00dcber die\nErkennbarkeit des Apriorischen\u201d (1914), already show signs of\nmoving beyond the confines of the Marburg approach. The book\nFundamental Philosophical Questions of Biology\n(Philosophische Grundfragen der Biologie, 1912) also stands\nout in this period as his earliest attempt to tackle the ontological\nissues contained in philosophy of biology. Here we will set aside the\nworks of the earlier period.\n\nThe inter-war period was the time of his most extensive output. In his\n1921 Grundz\u00fcge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis\n(Fundamentals of a Metaphysics of Cognition), Hartmann\ndeclares his independence from the Marburg school (while occupying the\nChair of one of its founders) by challenging one of its central\ntenets: cognition does not create its objects, as Neo-Kantianism\nholds, but grasps something that exists independently of it. Put\nbriefly, the Metaphysics of Cognition discusses the\ninteraction between epistemology and ontology and the unavoidable\ndependence of any epistemology on ontological assumptions. He\npublished his truly magisterial, innovative and comprehensive work on\nEthics in 1926, which includes some extensive remarks on the\nontology of values in some core chapters (Hartmann 2002\u20132004). The\nfirst volume of the commissioned Die Philosophie des deutschen\nIdealismus (The Philosophy of German Idealism,\non Kant, Fichte, and the Romantics) appeared in 1923. Two very\nimportant essays on ontology also appeared in the mid-twenties,\n\u201cHow is Critical Ontology Possible?\u201d (2012 [1924]), and\n\u201cKategoriale Gesetze\u201d (\u201cCategorial Laws,\u201d\n1926), which are the major precursors of his fully developed\nontological views. If we set aside his continued strong output of\nessay-length work, then between 1926 and 1935 his major publications\ninclude Volume 2 of his Die Philosophie des deutschen\nIdealismus (Philosophy of German Idealism) in 1929,\nZum Problem der Realit\u00e4tsgegebenheit (On the Problem\nof the Givenness of Reality) in 1931 (reprinted in Hartung and\nWunsch 2014, 177\u2013264), as well as Das Problem des geistigen Seins:\nUntersuchungen zur Grundlegung der Geschichtsphilosophie und der\nGeisteswissenschaften (The Problem of Spiritual Being:\nInvestigations into the Foundations of the Philosophy of History and\nthe Human Sciences) in 1933. On the Problem of the Givenness\nof Reality is significant not only because it is revised and\nincorporated into Part III of Ontology: Laying the\nFoundations, but because it was originally presented to a meeting\nof the Kant-Gesellschaft in Halle dedicated to the \u201cturn to\nontology and realism in contemporary philosophy\u201d (Hartung and\nWunsch 2014, 181). Subsequent to Ontology: Laying the\nFoundations in 1935, he steadily churned out the remaining\nvolumes of his ontological work, publishing Possibility and\nActuality in 1938 (Hartmann 2013), Aufbau in 1940, and\nhe completed the fourth volume Philosophy of Nature in 1943,\nalthough it was not published until 1950, after all of the other\nvolumes could be republished after WWII. The Aesthetics,\nunder revision at the time of his death, was posthumously published in\n1953 (Hartmann 2014).\n\nGiven the vast scope and meticulous reasoning of Hartmann\u2019s\nwork, this entry cannot aspire to adequately present its rich content.\nBut since Hartmann was a problem-oriented thinker, the task will be\nmade easier by discussing the theses of his major works under the\nheadings of the problems with which he was attempting to deal. In the\nremaining four sections, we will look at Hartmann\u2019s responses to\nthese questions: What is the relationship between thinking and being?\nWhat is valuable, and relatedly, what is the place of humankind in the\nworld? What is the structure of the real world? Finally, in the\nConclusion, What is Philosophy?, we will also very briefly consider\nHartmann\u2019s conception of philosophy in relation to that of his\ncontemporaries.\n\nSince Hartmann organized his bulky books into short chapters,\nsubdivided into sections usually no longer than two or three pages, we\nfollow his method of internal referencing by indicating the relevant\nchapters and sections. The following abbreviations will be used: ME =\nGrundz\u00fcge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis; S =\n\u201cSystematische Philosophie in eigener Darstellung\u201d; ET1 =\nEthics (Volume 1: Moral Phenomena); ET2 = Ethics\n(Volume 2: Moral Values); ET3 = Ethics (Volume 3: Moral\nFreedom); P = Problem des geistigen Seins; OLF =\nOntology: Laying the Foundations; PA = Possibility and\nActuality; A = Der Aufbau der realen Welt; N =\nPhilosophie der Natur; ELO = \u201cErkenntnis im Lichte der\nOntologie\u201d; NW = New Ways of Ontology; and AE =\nAesthetics. The chapters of various Introductions\nwill be referred to as \u201cIntro\u201d. For example,\n\u201cNIntro5\u201d and \u201cN3c\u201d will respectively refer to\nSection 5 of the Introduction and Chapter 3, Section c of the\nPhilosophy of Nature. (These abbreviations are also included\nbefore the bibliography below.)\n",
