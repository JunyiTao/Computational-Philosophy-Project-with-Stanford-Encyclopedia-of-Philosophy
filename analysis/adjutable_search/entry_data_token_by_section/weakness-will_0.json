    "main_text": "Hare on the Impossibility of Weakness of Will\n1. Hare on the Impossibility of Weakness of Will\n\n\nLet us commence our examination of contemporary discussions of this \nissue in appropriately Socratic vein, with an account that gives \nexpression to and builds on many of the intuitions that lead us to be\nsceptical about reports like (3) above. For the moral philosopher \nR. M. Hare\u2014as for Socrates\u2014it is impossible for\na person to do one thing if he genuinely and in the fullest sense \nholds that he ought instead to do something else. (If, that \nis\u2014to echo the earlier quote from Socrates\u2014he \n\u201cbelieves that there is another possible course of action, \nbetter than the one he is following.\u201d) This certainly seems to \nconstitute a denial of the possibility of akratic or weak-willed \naction. In Hare\u2019s case it is a consequence of the general account of \nthe nature of evaluative judgments which he defends (Hare 1952; \nsee also Hare 1963).\n\n\nHare is much impressed by what we vaguely referred to above as the \n\u201cspecial character\u201d of evaluative judgments: judgments, \nthat is, such as that one course of action is better than \nanother, or that one ought to do a certain thing. Such \nevaluative judgments seem to have properties that differentiate them \nfrom merely \u201cdescriptive\u201d judgments such as that one \nthing is more expensive than another, or rounder than another \n(Hare 1952, p. 111). Evaluative judgments seem, in \nparticular, to bear a special connection to action which no \npurely descriptive judgment possesses. Hare\u2019s analysis, then, takes \noff from something like the data we rehearsed earlier. Hare goes on \nto develop these data in the following way. He begins by identifying,\nas the fundamental distinctive feature of evaluative \njudgments\u2014that which lends them a special character\u2014that \nevaluative judgments are intended to guide conduct. (See, \ne.g., Hare 1952, p. 1; p. 29; p. 46; p. 125;\np. 127; p. 142, pp. 171\u20132; Hare 1963, \np. 67; p. 70.) The special function of evaluative judgments\nis to be action-guiding: that is, if you will, what evaluative \njudgments are for. Hare then puts a more precise gloss on \nwhat it is for a judgment to \u201cguide conduct\u201d: an \naction-guiding judgment is one which entails an answer to the \npractical question \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d (Hare 1952, \np. 29; see Hare 1963, p. 54 for the terminology \u201cpractical \n question\u201d).[3]\n What is it that an action-guiding judgment must entail? That is, what\nconstitutes an answer to the question \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d \nHare holds that no (descriptive) statement can constitute an answer \nto such a question (Hare 1952, p. 46). Rather, such a \nquestion is answered by a first-person command or \nimperative (Hare 1952, p. 79), which could be \nverbally expressed as \u201cLet me do a\u201d \n(Hare 1963, p. 55).\n\n\nTo recap the argument thus far: it is the function of evaluative \njudgments like \u201cI ought to do a\u201d to guide \nconduct. Guiding conduct means entailing an answer to the question \n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d An answer to that question will take \nthe form \u201cLet me do a,\u201d where this is a \nfirst-person command or imperative. Therefore evaluative judgments \nentail such first-person imperatives (Hare 1952, p. 192). \nNow in general, if judgment J1 entails judgment \nJ2, then assenting to J1 must\ninvolve assenting to J2: someone who professed to\nassent to J1 but who disclaimed \nJ2 would be held not to have spoken correctly \nwhen he claimed to assent to J1 (Hare 1952, \np. 172). So assenting to an evaluative judgment like \u201cI \nought to do a\u201d involves assenting to the first-person \ncommand \u201cLet me do a\u201d (Hare 1952, \npp. 168\u20139). We should inquire, then, what exactly is \ninvolved in sincerely assenting to a first-person command or \nimperative of this type. Just as sincere assent to a statement \ninvolves believing that statement, sincere assent to an \nimperative addressed to ourselves involves doing the thing \nin question:\n\n  It is a tautology to say that we cannot sincerely assent to a\n  \u2026 command addressed to ourselves, and at the same\n  time not perform it, if now is the occasion for performing it\n  and it is in our (physical and psychological) power to do so.\n  (Hare 1952, p. 20)\n\n\n\nSo: provided it is within my power to do a now, if I do not \ndo a now it follows that I do not genuinely judge that I \nought to do a now. Thus, as Hare states at the very opening \nof his book, a person\u2019s evaluative judgments are infallibly revealed \nby his actions and choices:\n\n  If we were to ask of a person \u2018What are his moral\n  principles?\u2019 the way in which we could be most sure of a true\n  answer would be by studying what he did\u2026. It would\n  be when \u2026 he was faced with choices or decisions between\n  alternative courses of action, between alternative answers to the\n  question \u2018What shall I do?\u2019, that he would reveal in\n  what principles of conduct he really believed. (Hare 1952,\n  p. 1)\n\n\n\nNote that Hare is not simply saying that a person\u2019s actions are the \nmost reliable source of evidence as to his evaluative judgments, or \nthat if a person did b the most likely hypothesis is that he\njudged b to be the best thing to do. Hare is saying, rather,\nthat it follows from a person\u2019s having done b that \nhe judged b best from among the options open to him at the \ntime. On this view, then, akratic or weak-willed actions as we have \nunderstood them are impossible. There could not be a case in which \nsomeone genuinely and in the fullest sense held that he ought to do \na now (where a was within his power) and yet did \nb. On Hare\u2019s view, \u201cit becomes analytic to say that \neveryone always does what he thinks he ought to [if physically and \npsychologically able]\u201d (Hare 1952, p. 169).\n\n\nBut does everyone always do what he thinks he ought to, when\nhe is physically and psychologically able? It may seem that this is \nsimply not always the case (even if it is usually the case).\nHave you, dear reader, never failed to get up off the couch \nand turn off the TV when you judged it was really time to start \ngrading those papers? Have you never had one or two more \ndrinks than you thought best on balance? Have you never \ndeliberately pursued a sexual liaison which you viewed as an overall \nbad idea? In short, have you never acted in a way which \ndeparted from your overall evaluation of your options? If so, let me \nbe the first to congratulate you on your fortitude. While weak-willed\naction does seem somehow puzzling, or defective in some important \nway, it does nonetheless seem to happen.\n\n\nFor Hare, however, any apparent case of akrasia must in fact\nbe one in which the agent is actually unable to do \na, or one in which the agent does not genuinely evaluate \na as better\u2014even if he says he \n does.[4]\n As an example of the first kind of case Hare cites Medea \n(Hare 1963, pp. 78\u20139), who (he contends) is powerless,\nliterally helpless, in the face of the strong emotions and desires \nroiling her: she is truly unable (psychologically) to resist\nthe temptations besieging her. A typical example of the second kind \nof case, on the other hand, would be one in which the agent is \nactually using the evaluative term \u201cgood\u201d or \n\u201cought\u201d only in what Hare calls an \n\u201cinverted-commas\u201d sense (Hare 1952, p. 120; \npp. 124\u20136; pp. 164\u20135; pp. 167\u2013171). \nIn such cases, when the agent says (while doing b) \u201cI \nknow I really ought to do a,\u201d he means only that most \npeople\u2014or, at any rate, the people whose opinions on such \nmatters are generally regarded as authoritative\u2014would say he \nought to do a. As Hare notes (Hare 1952, p. 124), \nto believe this is not to make an evaluative judgment oneself; \nrather, it is to allude to the value-judgments of other people. Such \nan agent does not himself assess the course of action he fails to \nfollow as better than the one he selects, even if other people \nwould.\n\n\nNo doubt there are cases of the two types Hare describes; but they do\nnot seem to exhaust the field. We can grant that there is the odd \nmurderer, overcome by irresistible homicidal urges but horrified at \nwhat she is doing. But surely not every case that we might be tempted\nto describe as one of acting contrary to one\u2019s better judgment \ninvolves irresistible psychic forces. Consider, for example, the \nfollowing case memorably put by J. L. Austin:\n\n  I am very partial to ice cream, and a bombe is served divided into\n  segments corresponding one to one with the persons at High Table: I\n  am tempted to help myself to two segments and do so, thus succumbing\n  to temptation and even conceivably (but why necessarily?) going\n  against my principles. But do I lose control of myself? Do I raven,\n  do I snatch the morsels from the dish and wolf them down, impervious\n  to the consternation of my colleagues? Not a bit of it. We often\n  succumb to temptation with calm and even with finesse.\n  (Austin 1956/7, p. 198)\n\n\n\n(I might add that it also seems doubtful that irresistible psychic \nforces kept you on the couch watching TV while those papers were \nwaiting.) As for the \u201cinverted-commas\u201d case, this too \nsurely happens: people do sometimes pay lip service to conventional \nstandards which they themselves do not really accept. But again, it \nseems highly doubtful that this is true of all seeming cases of \nweak-willed action. It seems depressingly possible to select and \nimplement one course of action while genuinely believing \nthat it is an overall worse choice than some other option open to \nyou.\n\n\nHas something gone wrong? We started with the \nunexceptionable-sounding thought that moral and evaluative judgments \nare intended to guide conduct; we arrived at a blanket denial of the \npossibility of akratic action which fits ill with observed facts. But\nif we are disinclined to follow Hare this far we should ask what the \nalternative is, for it may be even worse. For Hare, the answer is \nclear: our only other option is to repudiate the idea that moral and \nother evaluative judgments have a special character or nature, namely\nthat of being action-guiding. For we should recall that Hare presents\nall his subsequent conclusions as simply following, through a series \nof steps, from that initial thought. \u201cThe reason why actions \nare in a peculiar way revelatory of moral principles is that the \nfunction of moral principles is to guide conduct,\u201d Hare \ncontinues in the passage quoted earlier (Hare 1952, p. 1). For \nHare, then, the only way to escape his \u201cSocratic\u201d \nconclusion about weakness of will would be to give up the idea that \nevaluative judgments are intended to guide conduct, or to \u201chave\n[a] bearing upon our actions\u201d (Hare 1963, p. 169; see\nalso Hare 1952, p. 46; p. 143; p. 163; \npp. 171\u20132; and Hare 1963, p. 70; p. 99).\n\n\nThe choices before us, then, as presented by Hare, are Hare\u2019s own \nview, or one which assigns no distinctive role in action or practical\nthought to evaluative judgments, treating them as just like any other\njudgment. We might call the first of these an extreme version of \n(judgment) internalism. (I use this polysemous label to \nrefer, here, to the idea that certain judgments have an internal or \nnecessary connection to motivation and to action.) By extension, we \nmight usefully follow Michael Bratman in calling the second type of \nview \u201cextreme externalism\u201d (Bratman 1979, \npp. 158\u20139).\n\n\nExtreme externalism also seems unsatisfactory, however. First, it \nseems unable to explain why there should be anything perplexing or \nproblematical about action contrary to one\u2019s better judgment, why \nthere should be any philosophical problem about its possibility or \nits analysis. On this kind of view, it seems, Joseph\u2019s choice ((3) \nabove) should strike us as no more puzzling than Julie\u2019s or Jimmy\u2019s \n((1) or (2)). As Hare puts it:\n\n  On the view that we are considering, there is nothing odder about\n  thinking something the best thing to do in the circumstances, but\n  not doing it, than there is about thinking a stone the roundest\n  stone in the vicinity and not picking it up, but picking up some\n  other stone instead\u2026. There will be nothing that requires\n  explanation if I choose to do what I think to be, say, the worst\n  possible thing to do and leave undone what I think the best thing to\n  do. (Hare 1963, pp. 68\u20139)\n\n\n\nBut our reactions to (1), (2), and (3) show that we do think\nthere is something peculiar about action contrary to one\u2019s better \njudgment which renders such action hard to understand, or perhaps \neven impossible. An extreme externalist view thus seems to \nmischaracterize the status of akratic actions.\n\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, however, extreme externalism has \ndramatic implications for our understanding of intentional action in \ngeneral\u2014not just weak-willed action. For such a view implies \nthat\n\n  deliberation about what it would be best to do has no closer\n  relation to practical reasoning than, say, deliberation about what\n  it would be chic to do. If one happens to care about what it would\n  be chic to do, then a consideration of this matter may play an\n  important role in one\u2019s practical reasoning. If one does not care,\n  it will be irrelevant. The case is the same with reasoning about\n  what it would be best to do. (Bratman 1979, p. 158)\n\n\n\nTo adopt a general doctrine of this sort seems an awfully precipitous\nresponse to the possibility of akrasia. For it seems \nextremely plausible to assign to our overall evaluations of our \noptions an important role in our choices. Man is a rational animal, \nthe saying goes; that is\u2014to offer one gloss on this \nidea\u2014we act on reasons, and in the light of our assessments of \nthe overall balance of reasons. When we engage in deliberation or \nreasoning about what to do, we often proceed by thinking about the \nreasons which favor our various options, and then bringing these \ntogether into an overall assessment which is, precisely, intended to \nguide our choice.\n\n\nOr, as Bratman puts it, we very often reason about what it is \nbest to do as a way of settling the question of what \nto do. (He calls this \u201cevaluative practical \nreasoning\u201d: Bratman 1979, p. 156.) \u201cOne\u2019s \nevaluations [thus] play a crucial role in the reasoning underlying \nfull-blown action,\u201d Bratman holds (p. 170), and to be \nforced to deny this would be in his view \u201ctoo high a price to \npay\u201d (p. 159). As Alfred Mele similarly puts it, \n\u201cthere is a real danger that in attempting to make causal and \nconceptual space for full-fledged akratic action one might commit \noneself to the rejection of genuine ties between evaluative judgment \nand action\u201d (1991, p. 34). But that would be to throw the \nbaby out with the bathwater. If we want to resist Hare\u2019s conclusions,\nwe must do so in a way which steers clear of the danger to which Mele\nalerts us. We must navigate between the Scylla of extreme internalism\nand the Charybdis of extreme externalism.\n",
