    "main_text": "Mixed Positions: A Rapprochement between Relativists and Objectivists?\n8. Relativism and Tolerance\n\nRelativism is sometimes associated with a normative position, usually\npertaining to how people ought to regard or behave towards those with\nwhom they morally disagree. The most prominent normative position in\nthis connection concerns tolerance. In recent years, the idea that we\nshould be tolerant has been increasingly accepted in some circles. At\nthe same time, others have challenged this idea, and the philosophical\nunderstanding and justification of tolerance has become less obvious\n(see Heyd 1996 and the entry on\n toleration).\n The question here is whether moral relativism has something to\ncontribute to these discussions, in particular, whether DMR\nor MMR provide support for tolerance (for discussion, see\nGraham 1996, Harrison 1976, Ivanhoe 2009, Kim and Wreen 2003, Prinz\n2007: pp. 207\u201313 and Wong 1984: ch. 12). In this context,\ntolerance does not ordinarily mean indifference or absence of\ndisapproval: It means having a policy of not interfering with the\nactions of persons that are based on moral judgments we reject, when\nthe disagreement is not or cannot be rationally resolved. The context\nof discussion is often, but not always, moral disagreements between\ntwo societies. Does moral relativism provide support for tolerance in\nthis sense?\n\nThough many people seem to think it does, philosophers often resist\nsupposing that there is a philosophical connection between accepting a\nmetaethical position and reaching a practical conclusion (however, see\nGillespie 2016). Hence, it is often thought that,\nthough DMR may provide the occasion for tolerance, but\nit could not imply that tolerance is morally obligatory or even\npermissible. DMR simply tells us there are moral\ndisagreements. Recognition of this fact, by itself, entails nothing\nabout how we should act towards those with whom we disagree.\nMMR fares no better. For one thing, MMR cannot very\nwell imply that it is an objective moral truth that we should be\ntolerant: MMR denies that there are such truths. (A mixed\nposition could contend that tolerance is the only objective moral\ntruth, all others being relative; but it would have to be shown that\nthis is more than an ad hoc maneuver.) It might be said that\nMMR implies that tolerance is a relative truth. However, even\nthis is problematic. According to MMR, understood to concern\ntruth, the truth-value of statements may vary from society to society.\nHence, the statement, \u201cpeople ought to be tolerant\u201d\n(T), may be true in some societies and false in others.\nMMR by itself does not entail that T is true in any\nsociety, and may in fact have the result that T is false in some\nsocieties (a similar point may be made with respect to\njustification).\n\nSome objectivists may add that in some cases we should be tolerant of\nthose with whom we morally disagree, but that only objectivists can\nestablish this as an objective moral truth (for example, by drawing on\narguments in the liberal tradition from Locke or Mill). To the\nobjection that moral objectivism implies intolerance (or imperialism),\nobjectivists typically contend that the fact that we regard a society\nas morally wrong in some respect does not entail that we should\ninterfere with it.\n\nNonetheless, the thought persists among some relativists that there is\na philosophically significant connection between relativism and\ntolerance. Perhaps the conjunction of MMR and an ethical\nprinciple could give us a reason for tolerance we would not have on\nthe basis of the ethical principle alone. Such an approach has been\nproposed by Wong (1984: ch. 12). The principle is, roughly speaking,\nthat we should not interfere with people unless we could justify this\ninterference to them (if they were rational and well-informed in\nrelevant respects). Wong called this \u201cthe justification\nprinciple.\u201d Of course, it is already a tolerance principle of\nsorts. The idea is that it gains broader scope if MMR is\ncorrect. Let us suppose the statement that there is an individual\nright to freedom of speech is true and justified for our society, but\nis false and unjustified in another society in which the press is\nrestricted for the good of the community. In this case, given\nMMR, our society might not be able to justify interference to\nthe restrictive society concerning freedom of the press. Any\njustification we could give would appeal to values that are\nauthoritative for us, not them, and no appeal to logic or facts alone\nwould give them a reason to accept our justification.\n\nIf the justification principle were widely accepted, this argument\nmight explain why some people have had good reason to think there is a\nconnection between relativism and tolerance. But there is a question\nabout whether the position is stable. Wong derived the justification\nprinciple from Kant, and Kant rejected MMR. If we were to\naccept MMR, would we still have reason to accept the\njustification principle? Wong thought we might, perhaps on the basis\nof considerations quite independent of Kant. In any case, this\nargument would only show that MMR plays a role in an argument\nfor tolerance that is relevant to people in a society that accepted\nthe justification principle. The argument does not establish that\nthere is a general connection between relativism and tolerance. Nor\ndoes it undermine the contention that MMR may have the result\nthat T is true in some societies and false in others.\n\nIn his more recent defense of pluralistic relativism (2006), Wong has\nargued that, since some serious moral disagreements are inevitable,\nany adequate morality will include the value of what he calls\naccommodation. This involves a commitment to peaceful and non-coercive\nrelationships with persons with whom we disagree. Accommodation\nappears to be related to tolerance, but Wong argues for more than\nthis: we should also try to learn from others, compromise with them,\npreserve relationships with them, etc. Wong\u2019s defense of\naccommodation is immune to the objection that relativism cannot be a\nbasis for such a universal value because his defense purports to be\nbased on considerations that any adequate morality should recognize.\nHowever, for this reason, though it presupposes the considerations\nsupporting the relativist dimension of his position (there is no\nsingle true morality), it argues from the non-relativist dimension\n(there are universal constraints any morality should accept, in\nparticular, that one function of morality is to promote social\nco-operation). Hence, it is not strictly speaking an argument from\nrelativism to accommodation.\n\nAs was noted in\n section 3,\n aside from the philosophical question whether or not some form of\nmoral relativism provides a reason for attitudes such as tolerance,\nthere is the psychological question whether or not people who accept\nrelativism are more likely to be tolerant. As was seen, there is some\nevidence that relativists are more tolerant than objectivists, and it\nhas been claimed that, even if relativism does not justify tolerance,\nit would be a positive feature of relativism that acceptance of it\nmakes people more tolerant (see Prinz 2007: 208). Of course, this\njudgment presupposes that, in some sense, it is good to be\ntolerant.\n",
