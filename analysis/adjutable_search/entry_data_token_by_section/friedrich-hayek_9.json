    "main_text": "Hayek Against Justice || Input, Output, and What It Means To Economize\n5.1 Input, Output, and What It Means To Economize\n\nMerit, as Hayek understands it, concerns the character of the action\nas opposed to the nature of the achievement (Hayek 1960, 94). In other\nwords, to Hayek, claims of merit concern the inputs one brings to a\nprocess, not the output. In Hayek\u2019s mind, nothing good can come\nof that. In a free society, to Hayek, we are rewarded for our output,\nnot our input (Hayek 1960, 98).\n\nHayek has an important point. Among his core concerns is the\n\u201cmirage\u201d of thinking that justice requires rewarding\npeople for supplying inputs rather than for supplying outputs.\nAdmittedly, if we leave customers to their own devices, output is what\nthey will reward, which is what Hayek wants. By the same token, when\npeople left to their own devices choose to reward us for our output,\ntheir behavior will not be utterly insensitive to merit. The tendency\nof market rewards to track merit will be merely a tendency, but\nmeritocracy being merely a tendency is not the same as meritocracy\nbeing a mirage. A key element of the success of a system in promoting\nprosperity will be that in rewarding excellent output, it will be\nrewarding the hard work, courage, alertness, and commitment that makes\nfor excellence. It will be rewarding luck too, to be sure, but\ntypically not sheer random\n fluke.[9]\n Hayek speaks as if merit has everything to do with trying hard, and\nnothing to do with achieving excellence.\n\nHayek says we want to economize on merit (Hayek 1960, 96). If merit\nwere tied exclusively to supplying inputs, then Hayek would be right.\nBut even so, saying we economize on hard work is another way of saying\nhard work is important. It is not evidence that we are in the grip of\na mirage when we imagine that we have reason to reward hard work that\nculminates in excellent output.\n\nIn sum, a merit theorist might concede to Hayek that rewards ought to\ntrack actual performance, not inner merit. Customers can judge your\nproduct\u2019s merits without needing to know whether you were lucky.\nThe crucial point is that wherever it is more rewarding to work hard\nthan not, more rewarding to do excellent work than not, more rewarding\nto be alert to customer needs than not, a system is tending to reward\nthe right things. In that system, output will tend to be increasingly\nexcellent over time. Products will tend to work. People will tend to\nprosper, and will tend to aim at being meritorious to boot.\n",
