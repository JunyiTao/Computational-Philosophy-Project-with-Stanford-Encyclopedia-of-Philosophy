    "main_text": "Tropes as Building Blocks || Tropes and Universals\n3.1 Tropes and Universals\n\nHow can distinct things have things\u2014their properties\u2014in\ncommon? This is the problem of \u2018the One over Many\u2019\n(cf. e.g., Rodriguez-Pereyra 2000; Maurin 2022: sect. 2).\nUniversals provide a straightforward solution to this problem:\ndistinct things can have things in common, because there is a type of\nentity\u2014the universal\u2014capable of existing in (and hence\ncharacterizing) more than one object at once. The trope\ntheorist\u2014at least if she does not accept the existence of\nuniversals in addition to\n tropes[21]\u2014does\n not have recourse to entities that can be likewise identical in\ndistinct instances. She must therefore come up with an alternative\nsolution. Here I\u2019ll consider three.\n\nThe Resemblance Class Theory: The most commonly accepted\ntrope-solution to the problem of the One over Many takes two objects\na and b to \u2018share\u2019 a\nproperty\u2014F-ness\u2014 if at least one of of the tropes\nthat make up a belongs to the same (exact) resemblance class\nas at least one of the (numerically distinct) tropes that make up\nb (cf. Williams 1953a: 10; Campbell 1990:\n31f.; cf. also Lewis 1986: 64f.). Exact resemblance is an\nequivalence relation (although cf. Mormann 1995 for\nan alternative view), which means that it is a symmetrical,\nreflexive, and transitive relation. Because it is an\nequivalence relation, exact resemblance partitions the set of tropes\ninto mutually excluding and non-overlapping classes. Exact resemblance\nclasses of tropes, thus understood, function more or less as the\ntraditional universal does. Which is why proponents of this view think\nthe problem can be solved with reference to them.\n\nA point of contention among those who hold this view is if accepting\nit mean having to accept the existence of resemblance relations. Those\nwho think it doesn\u2019t, point out that resemblance is an\ninternal relation which supervenes on whatever it relates:\nthat the (degree of) resemblance between distinct tropes is entailed\nsimply given their\n existence.[22]\n Assuming that our ontology is \u2018sparse\u2019 (a thought many\nbelieve can be independently justified, cf. e.g., Schaffer\n2004 and Armstrong 1978), only what is minimally required to make true\nall truths exists. Which means that, if resemblance is an internal\nrelation, what exists when distinct tropes resemble each\nother\u2014and so what plays the role of the realist\u2019s\nuniversal\u2014is nothing but the resembling tropes themselves\n(Williams 1963: 608; Campbell 1990: 37f.; cf. also Armstrong\n1989: 56).\n\nDoes it follow from the fact that exact resemblance must obtain given\nthe existence of its relata, that it is no ontological addition to\nthem? Some philosophers (Daly 1997: 152 is among them) do not think\nso. But if it doesn\u2019t follow, some have argued, the trope\ntheorist must combat a trope theoretical version of what has become\nknown as \u2018Russell\u2019s regress\u2019. Russell\u2019s\nregress (perhaps better: Russell\u2019s regress argument) is\nan argument to the effect that, if some particulars (Russell was\nthinking of concrete particulars, not of tropes) (exactly) resemble\neach other, then either the relation of resemblance exists and is\na universal, or we end up in (vicious) infinite regress (Russell\n1997 [1912]: 48; cf. also K\u00fcng 1967). Chris Daly (1997:\n149) provides us with a trope-theoretical version of this\n argument:[23]\n\n\nConsider three concrete particulars which are the same shade of\nred\u2026each of these concrete particulars has a red\ntrope\u2014call these tropes F, G, and\nH\u2014and these concrete particulars exactly resemble each\nother in colour because F, G, and H exactly\nresemble each other in colour. But it seems that this account is\nincomplete. It seems that the account should further claim that\nresemblance tropes hold between F, G, and\nH. That is, it seems that there are resemblance tropes\nholding between the members of the pairs F and G,\nG and H, and F and H\u2026 Let\nus call the resemblance tropes in question R1,\nR2, and R3\u2026each of\nthese resemblance tropes in turn exactly resemble each other.\nTherefore, certain resemblance tropes hold between these\ntropes\u2026we are launched on a regress.\n\n\nThis regress is a problem only if it is vicious. The most\nconvincing reason for thinking that it is not is provided if we\nconsider the \u2018pattern of dependence\u2019 it\n instantiates.[24]\n For, as we have seen, even those who do not think that the\ninternality of exact resemblance makes it a mere\n\u2018pseudo-addition\u2019 to its subvenient base, agree that\nresemblance, whatever it is, is such that its existence is necessarily\nincurred simply given the existence of its relata. But then, no matter\nhow many resemblances we regressively generate, ultimately they all\ndepend for their existence on the existence of the resembling tropes,\nwhich resemble each other because of their individual nature, which is\nprimitive. This means that the existence of the regress in no way\ncontradicts\u2014it does not function as a reductio\nagainst\u2014the resemblance of the original tropes. On the contrary;\nit is because the tropes resemble each other, that the\nregress exists. Therefore, the regress is benign (cf. e.g.,\nCampbell 1990: 37; Maurin 2013).\n\nThis response only works if the nature of individual\ntropes\u2014their being what they are\u2014is primitive and\nnot further analyzable (i.e., it only works if we assume a standard\nview of the nature of tropes). To see this, compare the standard view\nwith a view with which it is often confused: resemblance nominalism.\nOn a version of the trope view according to which universals are\nresemblance classes of tropes, tropes have the same nature if they\nresemble each other. Yet, importantly, they resemble each other (or\nnot) in virtue of the (primitive) nature they each\n\u2018have\u2019 (or \u2018are\u2019). Resemblance\nnominalism, on the other hand, is the view that two objects have the\nnatures they do in virtue of the resemblance relations which obtain\nbetween them. This means that, whether they resemble or not, is not\ndecided given the existence and nature of the objects themselves.\nRather, the pattern of dependence is the other way around. And\nthis\u2014arguably\u2014makes the regress vicious. Perhaps for that\nreason, resemblance nominalism has no explicit proponent among the\ntrope theorists.\n\nThe Natural Class Theory: Those not convinced that\n\u2018Daly\u2019s regress\u2019 is benign might prefer a view\n(first defended by Ehring 2011: 175f) according to which the trope is\nnot what it is either primitively or because of whatever resemblance\nrelations it stands in to other tropes, but because of the natural\nclass to which it belongs. Accepting this view provides us with a new\nsolution to the problem of the One over Many, one that does not depend\non the existence (or not) of exact resemblance relations. On this\nview, more precisely, two objects a and b\n\u2018share\u2019 a property\u2014F-ness\u2014 if at\nleast one of the tropes that make up a belongs to the same\nnatural class as at least one of the tropes that make up b.\nThe problem with this alternative is that it appears\nto\u2014implausibly\u2014turn explanation on its head. If accepted,\ntropes do not belong to this or that class because of their nature.\nRather, tropes have the natures they do because they belong to this or\nthat class.\n\nThe Trope-Kind Theory: Although he in his (1953a)\nbriefly \u2018dallied\u2019 (his word) with the view that, to be a\nuniversal is to be a resemblance class of tropes, Williams soon\nthereafter changed his mind (cf. esp. his 1986 [1959] and\n 1963).[25]\n According to the view he adopted instead of the resemblance view,\nuniversals are neither \u201cmade\u201d nor \u201cdiscovered\u201d\nbut are something we acknowledge \u201cby a relaxation of the\nidentity conditions of thought and language\u201d (1986 [1959]: 8;\ncf. also Campbell 1990: 44). If the F-ness of a and\nthe F-ness of b is counted in a way that is subject to the\nrule that anything indiscernible is identical, their sameness is\nexplained with reference to the universal they share. And if the\nF-ness of a and the F-ness of b is counted in a way\nthat isn\u2019t subject to that rule, their sameness is\nexplained with reference to their individual, distinct, yet exactly\nresembling tropes. Importantly, Williams thinks of this as a kind of\nrealism\u2014an immanent realism\u2014about\nuniversals (Fisher 2017: 346; cf. also Fisher 2018 and\nHeil 2012: 102f.). It takes universals to be \u201cpresent in, and in\nfact components of, their instances\u201d (Williams 1986 [1959]: 10).\nYet, as noted by Fisher (2017: 346) tropes are still the primitive\nelements of being. Universals are real in virtue of being\nmind-independent. Yet, universals aren\u2019t fundamental\n(Fisher: ibid.):\n\n\nTheir reality is determined by mind-independent facts about tropes.\nTropes manifest universals in the sense that universals are nothing\nover and above property instances as tropes are by their nature of\nkinds.\n\n\nThe trope-kind theory offers an interesting and so far surprisingly\nlittle discussed solution to the problem of the One over Many. So far,\nit is a view with few if any explicit contemporary proponents (though\ncf. Paul 2002, 2017 and van Inwagen 2017:\n 348f.[26]).\n It is not unlikely that this state of affairs is now about to\nchange.\n",
