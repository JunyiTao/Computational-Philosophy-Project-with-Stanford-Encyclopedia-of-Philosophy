If we have all these, then if (a) and (b)\ntogether logically entail the state of the world at all other\ntimes (or, at least, all times later than that given in (a)), the\nworld is deterministic. Logical entailment, in a sense broad enough to\nencompass mathematical consequence, is the modality behind the\ndetermination in \u201cdeterminism.\u201d\n",
