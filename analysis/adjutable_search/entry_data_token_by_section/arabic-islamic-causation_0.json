    "main_text": "Kal\u0101m debates || Divine justice and human freedom in Mu\u02bftazilite theology\n1.1 Divine justice and human freedom in Mu\u02bftazilite theology\n\nGenerally speaking, Islamic theologians in the Classical period saw\nthe created world as comprised of atoms and their\naccidents (Dhanani 1994; Frank 1999). They held that\nGod produced this world at an initial moment, and that He\nreproduces it at every subsequent moment in which it exists. They\nalso identified God as the immediate cause of every change in the\ncreated world. For example, according to their view, God\ncreated the atoms that comprise my skin, and the accidents of\npaleness that belongs to those atoms, at the initial moment of\ntheir existence, and he recreates them at all subsequent moments in\nwhich they exist. If my skin retains its paleness over a period\nof time, this is due to God\u2019s continuous recreation of its\npaleness. Likewise, if my skin reddens when exposed to\nsunlight, this is due to God\u2019s ceasing to recreate its paleness,\nand creating in it redness instead. (This would involve His creating a\nseries of accidents of deepening shades of red.)\n\nEighth-century Mu\u02bftazilite theologians made an important\nexception to this general account: they claimed that human\nbeings have the power to produce their own actions, whether these\nare thoughts, volitions or bodily movements. They saw this position as\nrequired by divine justice (Wolfson 1976; Frank 1982, 1983, 1985;\nVasalou 2008). Suppose, for example, that I intentionally strike you\nand that, as a result, you fall into a coma. According to\nthe ontology just described, this event involves the coming into\nbeing of several accidents, including my choice\n(ikhtiy\u0101r) to strike you, my bodily motion of striking,\nand your falling into a coma. According to the Mu\u02bftazilites,\nI must be the source of these accidents; if I were\nnot, divine reward or punishment of me on the basis of my\nactions would be unjust.\n\nFor Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, then, the circle of agents\nincludes both God and humanity, since human beings cause certain\naccidents. Some of these accidents are directly produced by human\nagents; for example, my choice to strike you and my bodily motion of\nstriking. Others are produced by \u201cgeneration\u201d\n(tawallud); for example, your falling into a coma. A human\nagent produces an accident by generation when she produces\nthe cause (sabab) of the accident, but not the accident\nitself. (The accident itself is brought into being by God,\nunless impeded by another accident.) The production of accidents\nby generation was not supposed to involve shared responsibility\nbetween God and human beings, since the point of identifying a\nhuman being as the source of such accidents was to attribute\nresponsibility for their production to that human being. \n\nThis approach to agency engendered debate among Mu\u02bftazilites\nabout the scope of human responsibility. One topic of concern\nwas the relationship between motivation and action. Given that\nmotivation is determined by antecedent causes, were an agent\u2019s\nmotivation the sufficient cause of her action, responsibility for the\naction would seem to lie with the source of the motivation, which\nmay be external to the agent. According to \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r\n(935\u20131025), motivation is not the sufficient cause of action,\nwhich requires choice as well (Frank 1982). This response links human\nagency and responsibility to choice.\n",
