    "main_text": "Introducing States of Affairs || Talking about States of Affairs\n1.1 Talking about States of Affairs\n\nCan one base our understanding of what states of affairs are on\nfeatures of how we talk about them?\n\nPollock holds that we normally refer to states of affairs by gerund\nclauses such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s being more than seven\nfeet tall or Spiro Agnew\u2019s being President of Yale\nUniversity (see Pollock 1984b: 121). However, while the referents\nof such gerund clauses seem not to be\npropositions\u2014\u201cKareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s being more\nthan seven feet tall is true\u201d does not sound\nright\u2014these clauses are referentially flexible. For the gerund\nclauses in the following sentences seem to refer to facts or events,\nthe relata of causal relations and objects of knowledge (the first two\nexamples are from Pollock 1984b: 122):\n\nCharlie\u2019s eloping with Ginger was surprising.\nMary\u2019s divorcing Charlie caused Charlie\u2019s\ndemise.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s being more than seven feet\ntall is well-known.\n\n\nNow facts may be nothing but states of affairs that obtain and events\nstates of affairs that obtain at some times and not at others. If this\nwere right, the gerund clauses above would refer to states of affairs.\nBut we need to get an independent grip on the notion of states of\naffairs before settling the question whether facts and events are a\nkind of state of affairs. For this purpose we can neither pick out\nstates of affairs as the things that obtain or nor say that they are\nthe referents of gerund clauses of the kind considered above.\n\nAre there predicates that we apply to states of affairs and that are\ndistinctive of them? States of affairs are said to obtain or\nnot, while Fregean thoughts are true or\nfalse. In contrast, facts exist; a fact cannot be qualified\nas obtaining or not obtaining (see Betti 2015: 35). However, it seems\ndifficult to get a grip on the difference between obtaining\nand non-obtaining on the one hand, and truth and\nfalsity on the other. Prima facie, the state of\naffairs Socrates\u2019s being wise obtains if, and only if,\nit is true that Socrates is wise (see Plantinga 1974: 45\u20136; see\nalso Betti 2015: 35). Pollock (1984a: 53) correctly observes that\n\u201cobtaining and not-obtaining are truth-like properties\u201d.\nBut why are they just truth-like and not just truth and\nfalsity under a different label; why can the obtaining of a state of\naffairs not be identified with the truth of a thought or\nproposition?\n\nBetti proposes that the distinction between obtaining and\nnon-obtaining states of affairs is an ontological one:\n\n\nnonobtaining states of affairs have no mode of being (so they neither\nsubsist nor exist) but they are still objects in their own\nright\u2014that is, they are part of the catalogue of the world in\ntheir own right. (2015: 35\u20136)\n\n\nIf this were right, states of affairs would be more even puzzling than\nMeinongian objects that at least subsist. However, false propositions\nseem equally to have only a \u201cshadowy\u201d existence:\n\n\nTime was when I thought there were propositions, but it does not seem\nto me very plausible to say that in addition to facts there are also\nthese curious shadowy things going about such as \u201cThat today is\nWednesday\u201d when in fact it is Tuesday. (Russell 1918: 223)\n\n\nIn conclusion: the difference between \u201cis true (false)\u201d\nand \u201cobtains (does not obtain)\u201d, does not help us to\ndistinguish states of affairs from other things. Is there a\ntheoretical role that states of affairs can, but thoughts\n(propositions) and facts can\u2019t fill?\n",
