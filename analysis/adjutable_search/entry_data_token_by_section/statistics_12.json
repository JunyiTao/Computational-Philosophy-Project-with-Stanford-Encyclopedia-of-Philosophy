    "main_text": "Statistical models\n5. Statistical models\nIn the foregoing we have seen how classical and Bayesian statistics\ndiffer. But the two major approaches to statistics also have a lot in\ncommon. Most importantly, all statistical procedures rely on the\nassumption of a statistical model, here referring to any\nrestricted set of statistical hypotheses.  Moreover, they are both\naimed at delivering a verdict over these hypotheses.  For example, a\nclassical likelihood ratio test considers two hypotheses, \\(h\\) and\n\\(h'\\), and then offers a verdict of rejection and acceptance, while a\nBayesian comparison delivers a posterior probability over these two\nhypotheses. Whereas in Bayesian statistics the model presents a very\nstrong assumption, classical statistics does not endow the model with\na special epistemic status: they are simply the hypotheses currently\nentertained by the scientist. But across the board, the adoption of a\nmodel is absolutely central to any statistical procedure.\nA natural question is whether anything can be said about the\nquality of the statistical model, and whether any verdict on this\nstarting point for statistical procedures can be given. Surely some\nmodels will lead to better predictions, or be a better guide to the\ntruth, than others. The evaluation of models touches on deep issues in\nthe philosophy of science, because the statistical model often\ndetermines how the data-generating system under investigation is\nconceptualized and approached (Kieseppa 2001). Model choice thus\nresembles the choice of a theory, a conceptual scheme, or even of a\nwhole paradigm, and thereby might seem to transcend the formal\nframeworks for studying theoretical rationality (cf. Carnap 1950,\nJeffrey 1980). Despite the fact that some considerations on model\nchoice will seem extra-statistical, in the sense that they fall\noutside the scope of statistical treatment, statistics offers several\nmethods for approaching the choice of statistical models.\n",
