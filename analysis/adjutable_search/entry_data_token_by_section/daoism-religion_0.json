    "main_text": "Early Daoist Texts\n1. Early Daoist Texts\n\nIt would hardly be possible to identify a school or a lineage in the\nhistory of Daoism which denies that the entire Daoist tradition, in\nthe forms in which it has been transmitted for about two and a half\nmillennia, ultimately derives from Laozi and from the work that is\nascribed to him, the Daode jing or Book of the Way and\nIts Virtue.\n\nAs shown below, neither has Daoism evolved exclusively on the basis of\nthis work, nor does evidence exist of a historical continuity between\nLaozi and the Daode jing, on the one hand, and the different\nforms in which Daoism has developed, on the other. Equally\nsignificant, however, is the fact that, in a traditional doctrine such\nas Daoism, history in the ordinary sense of the term can be altered at\nwill to frame a \u201csacred history\u201d of the teaching. The main\npoint is establishing and exhibiting a bond between an integral\nexposition of the doctrine\u2014which Daoists find in the Daode\njing\u2014and the particular teachings and practices of the\nindividual schools or lineages. To give a few examples, this can be\ndone by asserting that a particular \u201cWay\u201d (dao)\nderives from a revelation by Laozi, either in his human or in his\ndivine aspect; or by placing Laozi at the origins of (or within) a\n\u201cpre-historical\u201d line of transmission; or simply by using,\nin textual sources, key sentences or terms from the Daode\njing. In these and several other ways, Laozi and the Daode\njing are, for the Daoists, one of the main vehicles used to\ndeclare their identity as Daoists.\n\nAmong early works, the Daoist tradition usually places the\nZhuangzi immediately after the Daode jing. A third\ntext, the Liezi, has fallen into a sort of limbo, especially\nafter A.C. Graham demonstrated that parts of the received text are not\nauthentic and date from not earlier than the 2nd century CE (instead of the\n4th century BCE, as was supposed earlier; Graham 1961).\nRecently, however, there have been efforts to rehabilitate this work\n(Barrett 2011), also motivated by the fact that it appears to contain\nlost fragments of the Zhuangzi.\n",
