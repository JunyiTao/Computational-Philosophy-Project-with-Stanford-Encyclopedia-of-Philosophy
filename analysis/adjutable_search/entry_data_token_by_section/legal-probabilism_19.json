    "main_text": "Standards of Proof || Legal background\n5.1 Legal background\n\nIn criminal proceedings, the governing standard is \u201cproof beyond\na reasonable doubt\u201d. In civil cases, the standard is typically\n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d. The latter is less\ndemanding than the former, so the same body of evidence may be enough\nto meet the preponderance standard, but not enough to meet the beyond\na reasonable doubt standard. A vivid example of this difference is the\n1995 trial of O.J. Simpson who was charged with murdering his wife. He\nwas acquitted of the criminal charges, but when the family of the\nvictim brought a lawsuit against him, they prevailed. O.J. Simpson did\nnot kill his wife according to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard,\nbut he did according to the preponderance standard. An intermediate\nstandard, called \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d, is\nsometimes used for civil proceedings in which the decision is\nparticularly weighty, for example, a decision whether someone should\nbe involuntarily committed to a hospital facility.\n\nHow to define standards of proof, or whether they should be even\ndefined in the first place, remains contentious (Diamond 1990;\nHorowitz and Kirkpatrick 1996; Laudan 2006; Newman 1993; Walen\n2015). Judicial opinions offer different paraphrases, sometimes\nconflicting, of what these standards mean. The meaning of \u201cproof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is the most controversial. It has\nbeen equated to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d or \u201cabiding\nconviction\u201d (Commonwealth v. Webster, 59\nMass. 295, 1850), or to \n\n\nproof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would\nnot hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of his own\naffairs. (US Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Devitt et al. 1987, 12.10, 354)\n\n\n\nBut courts have also cautioned that there is no need to define the\nterm because \u201cjurors know what is reasonable and are quite\nfamiliar with the meaning of doubt\u201d and attempts to define it\nonly \u201cmuddy the water\u201d (U.S. v.\nGlass, 846 F.2d 386, 1988).\n\nProbability theory can bring conceptual clarity to an otherwise\nheterogeneous legal doctrine, or at least this is the position of\nlegal probabilists.\n",
