The explanation schema\nused is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nWhy do people have a particular kind of intelligent behavior?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nPeople have mental rules.\nPeople have procedures for using these rules to search a space of\npossible solutions, and procedures for generating new rules.\nProcedures for using and forming rules produce the behavior.\n\n\n\nComputational models based on rules have provided detailed simulations\nof a wide range of psychological experiments, from cryptarithmetic\nproblem solving to skill acquisition to language use. Rule-based\nsystems have also been of practical importance in suggesting how to\nimprove learning and how to develop intelligent machine systems.\n",
