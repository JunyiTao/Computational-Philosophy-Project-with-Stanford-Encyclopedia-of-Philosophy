    "main_text": "Applications of dependence logic || Dependence logic and database theory\n5.1 Dependence logic and database theory\n\nThere is a straightforward connection between the teams of team\nsemantics and the relations studied in relational database theory:\ngiven a team \\(X\\) and a tuple of variables \\(\\vec v = v_1 \\ldots\nv_k\\) occurring in its assignments, it is possible to define the\nrelation \\(X(\\vec v) = \\{\\langle s(v_1), \\ldots, s(v_n)\\rangle : s \\in\nX\\}\\). Furthermore, the dependency atoms studied in dependence logic\nand its variants are analogous to \u2013 and in many cases, derived\nfrom \u2013 dependencies considered in database theory such as\nfunctional dependencies (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007a),\nmultivalued dependencies (Engstr\u00f6m 2012), and\ninclusion and exclusion dependencies (Galliani 2012). The\nrelationship between dependence logic and database theory contributed\nnot only to the further development of dependence logic, but also to\nthat of database theory: for instance, in Hannula & Kontinen 2016\na finite axiomatization of the unrestricted implication problem for\ninclusion, functional, and embedded multivalued database-theoretic\ndependencies was found through the study of a similar problem within\nthe context of team semantics.\n",
