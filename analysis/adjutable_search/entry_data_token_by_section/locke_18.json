    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || The Function Of Civil Government\n4.6 The Function Of Civil Government\n\nLocke is now in a position to explain the function of a legitimate\ngovernment and distinguish it from illegitimate government. The aim of\nsuch a legitimate government is to preserve, so far as possible, the\nrights to life, liberty, health and property of its citizens, and to\nprosecute and punish those of its citizens who violate the rights of\nothers and to pursue the public good even where this may conflict with\nthe rights of individuals. In doing this it provides something\nunavailable in the state of nature, an impartial judge to determine\nthe severity of the crime, and to set a punishment proportionate to\nthe crime. This is one of the main reasons why civil society is an\nimprovement on the state of nature. An illegitimate government will\nfail to protect the rights to life, liberty, health and property of\nits subjects, and in the worst cases, such an illegitimate government\nwill claim to be able to violate the rights of its subjects, that is\nit will claim to have despotic power over its subjects. Since Locke is\narguing against the position of Sir Robert Filmer who held that\npatriarchal power and political power are the same, and that in effect\nthese amount to despotic power, Locke is at pains to distinguish these\nthree forms of power, and to show that they are not equivalent. Thus\nat the beginning of chapter 15 \u201cOf Paternal, Political and\nDespotic Power Considered Together\u201d he writes:\n\n\nTHOUGH I have had occasion to speak of these before, yet the great\nmistakes of late about government, having as I suppose arisen from\nconfounding these distinct powers one with another, it may not be\namiss, to consider them together.\n\n\nChapters 6 and 7 give Locke\u2019s account of paternal and political\npower respectively. Paternal power is limited. It lasts only through\nthe minority of children, and has other limitations. Political power,\nderived as it is from the transfer of the power of individuals to\nenforce the law of nature, has with it the right to kill in the\ninterest of preserving the rights of the citizens or otherwise\nsupporting the public good. Legitimate despotic power, by contrast,\nimplies the right to take the life, liberty, health and at least some\nof the property of any person subject to such a power.\n",
