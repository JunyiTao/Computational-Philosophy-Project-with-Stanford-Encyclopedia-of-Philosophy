    "main_text": "The Early Wittgenstein || The Nature of Philosophy\n2.3 The Nature of Philosophy\n\nAccordingly, \u201cthe word \u2018philosophy\u2019 must mean\nsomething which stands above or below, but not beside the natural\nsciences\u201d (TLP 4.111). Not surprisingly, then,\n\u201cmost of the propositions and questions to be found in\nphilosophical works are not false but nonsensical\u201d (TLP\n4.003). Is, then, philosophy doomed to be nonsense\n(unsinnig), or, at best, senseless (sinnlos) when it\ndoes logic, but, in any case, meaningless? What is left for the\nphilosopher to do, if traditional, or even revolutionary, propositions\nof metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, and ethics cannot be\nformulated in a sensical manner? The reply to these two questions is\nfound in Wittgenstein\u2019s characterization of philosophy:\nphilosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an activity. It\nis an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more so, of\ncritique (of language). Described by Wittgenstein, it should be the\nphilosopher\u2019s routine activity: to react or respond to the\ntraditional philosophers\u2019 musings by showing them where they go\nwrong, using the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words,\nby showing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense.\n\n\u201cAll propositions are of equal value\u201d (TLP\n6.4)\u2014that could also be the fundamental thought of the book. For\nit employs a measure of the value of propositions that is done by\nlogic and the notion of limits. It is here, however, with the\nconstraints on the value of propositions, that the tension in the\nTractatus is most strongly felt. It becomes clear that the\nnotions used by the Tractatus\u2014the logical-philosophical\nnotions\u2014do not belong to the world and hence cannot be used to\nexpress anything meaningful. Since language, thought, and the world,\nare all isomorphic, any attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language)\n\u201cthis and this there is in the world, that there is not\u201d\nis doomed to be a failure, since it would mean that logic has got\noutside the limits of the world, i.e. of itself. That is to say, the\nTractatus has gone over its own limits, and stands in danger\nof being nonsensical.\n\nThe \u201csolution\u201d to this tension is found in\nWittgenstein\u2019s final remarks, where he uses the metaphor of the\nladder to express the function of the Tractatus. It is to be\nused in order to climb on it, in order to \u201csee the world\nrightly\u201d; but thereafter it must be recognized as nonsense and\nbe thrown away. Hence: \u201cwhereof one cannot speak, thereof one\nmust be silent\u201d (7).\n",
