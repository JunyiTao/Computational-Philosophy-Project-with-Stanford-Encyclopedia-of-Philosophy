    "main_text": "The Epistemology of the PAO\n4. The Epistemology of the PAO\n\n\nI turn now to Vaihinger\u2019s chief systematic work, the\nPAO. That this work represents his attempt to continue\nLange\u2019s project of naturalizing Kantian epistemology\n(Heidelberger 2014, 51\u201355) may appear surprising given\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretation of Kant. Confusion here may be\nforestalled by attending to something Vaihinger himself says about the\naim of the work:\n\n\n\nThere were two possible ways of working out the Neo-Kantianism of\nF.A. Lange. Either the Kantian standpoint could be developed, on the\nbasis of a closer and more accurate study of Kant\u2019s teaching, and\nthis is what Cohen has done, or one could bring Lange\u2019s\nNeo-Kantianism into relation with empiricism and positivism. This has\nbeen done in my philosophy of \u201cAs if,\u201d which also leads to\na more thorough study of Kant\u2019s \u201cAs if\u201d theory.\n(PAO xxii)\n\n\nSo Vaihinger distinguishes between the views maintained by the\nhistorical Kant, and Lange\u2019s brand of\nKantianism, which his own systematic work defends and\ndevelops.\n\n\nBut, the PAO also builds on Lange\u2019s position in\nnon-trivial ways. Vaihinger\u2019s autobiographical essay \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Philosophy of \u2018As If\u2019\u201d points to two\nfurther significant influences, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin.\nVaihinger\u2019s interest in Schopenhauer was sparked by the doctrine\nthat the intellect is \u201ca mere tool in the service of the\nwill\u201d (Schopenhauer 1958, 2:205). This view is based in part on\nSchopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics, according to which the ultimate\nnature of reality is nothing other than a suprapersonal, aimless,\nquasi-volitional striving or \u201cwill.\u201d Schopenhauer holds\nthat this \u201cwill\u201d expresses itself empirically in the\nstriving of organic beings to preserve their individual existence, and\nthe intellect has accordingly developed as a mere tool to aid more\ncomplex organisms in this task. Vaihinger believed that Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of natural selection had provided an empirical grounding for\nSchopenhauer\u2019s hypothesis (PAO xviii). This was crucial,\nsince Vaihinger\u2019s own Kantianism prevented him from endorsing\nSchopenhauer\u2019s speculative vitalist metaphysics (PAO\nxvii). At the same time, Vaihinger comes to view Kant\u2019s doctrine\nof the essential limits of our cognition through this\nSchopenhauerian-Darwinian lens: the \u201climitations of human\nknowledge,\u201d he says, are \u201ca necessary and natural result of\nthe fact that thought and knowledge are originally only a means, to\nattain the Life-purpose, so that their actual independence signifies a\nbreaking-away from their original purpose; indeed, by the fact of this\nbreaking-loose, thought is confronted by impossible problems\u201d\n(PAO xviii). Vaihinger will use this idea to motivate his own\nfictionalism, and to provide a radical reinterpretation of\nKantianism.\n\n\nThese various influences are drawn together in the introductory\nchapters of PAO. Here, Vaihinger presents a view of the\n\u201cpsyche\u201d as a purely natural faculty, akin to a bodily\norgan, and bound by the same laws as the rest of the organic world. All\npsychic activities, including \u201cscientific thought,\u201d are\n\u201cto be considered from the point of view of an organic\nfunction\u201d (PAO 1). Like bodily organs, the psyche is\ndesigned (or rather, selected) to perform a particular role within the\ntotal economy of the organism. Its purpose is \u201cto change and\nelaborate the perceptual material into those ideas, associations of\nideas, and conceptual constructs,\u201d which produce \u201ca world\n[in which] objective happenings can be calculated and our behavior\nsuccessfully carried out in relation to phenomena\u201d(PAO\n2). Its purpose is therefore not \u201cto be a copy [Abbild]\nof reality,\u201d but rather \u201can instrument for finding our\nway about more easily in this world\u201d (PAO 22,\ntranslation altered). Though broadly in the spirit of Schopenhauer and\nDarwin, this instrumentalist conception of the mind is, as Ceynowa has\nargued (1993, 35\u2013132), also more specifically indebted to the\nnineteenth century psychologist Adolf Horwicz.\n\n\nWhatever its exact provenance, Vaihinger\u2019s basic thought is that\nwhat is selected for in the evolution of our cognitive capacities is\nthe ability to aid us in carrying out activities that are useful for\nthe purposes of survival. Specifically, Vaihinger seems to reason that\nany course of action\u2014say, procuring food for\noneself\u2014involves at least some minimal degree of planning, and\nthat in turn requires some basic ability to predict what the future\nwill be like, and to know how it will be different if we choose to\n\u03c6 rather than to \u03c8. Thus, he suggests that the purpose of\nthought is \u201cto calculate those events that occur without our\nintervention and to realize our impulses appropriately\u201d\n(PAO 3). For the bare purposes of carrying out those actions\nnecessary for survival, Vaihinger is claiming, the intellect would not\nhave to be a reliable guide to the way the world really is. On the\ncontrary, fictions may have an indispensable role to play here.\n\n\nWhat are we to make of this sort of argument? One might suggest that\nthe fact that our cognitive apparatus is a product of natural selection\nsupports, rather than undermines, the idea that it is a reliable guide\nto the way the world is. For, being mistaken about how things stand in\none\u2019s environment is surely an impediment, not an aid, to\nsurvival. Vaihinger would likely respond that this only shows that we\nhave to get the right things about the world right. It does\nnot mean that our total image of the world is, or even could be, a\ncopy of reality, accurate in all its details.\nVaihinger\u2019s view is that the picture of the world that is easiest\nto work with will depart from reality in certain crucial respects.\n\n\nOne may now wonder, however, what is to be made of Vaihinger\u2019s\nnear exclusive emphasis in PAO on fictions in the natural\nsciences and mathematics. After all, the theorizing in fundamental\nphysics is a rather different matter than determining how to find a\nmeal, and even if such theories turn out to be useful down the line, it\nseems that life would (and does) manage just fine without them. Here,\nVaihinger relies on another Darwinian idea, which he calls the\n\u201cLaw of Preponderance of the Means over the End,\u201d according\nto which \u201cmeans which serve a purpose often undergo a more\ncomplete development than is necessary for the attainment of their\npurpose\u201d (PAO xxix). In the language of contemporary\nevolutionary biology, scientific thought is like a\n\u201cspandrel.\u201d At the same time, Vaihinger is keen to\nemphasize the connection between scientific theorizing and more humdrum\ncognitive processes. He adopts the broadly Kantian view that what is\ngiven to us in experience is merely a \u201cchaos of sensations\u201d\n(PAO 117), which needs to be ordered and refined by the\nlogical functions of thought, or categories. For example, the repeated\nco-occurrence of sensations of a branching shape and sensations of\ngreen leads the psyche to postulate a relation of substantial inherence\nbetween a thing or substance (the tree) and its\nattribute (green) (PAO 122\u201323). However, he\nargues in a manner evocative of Berkeley, the notion of a substance is\nincoherent since it implies the existence of a bare substrate with no\nproperties whatsoever (PAO 125\u201326). The fiction is\nnevertheless justified, he suggests, because it facilitates the\nrecognition of regularities in the occurrences of our sensations, and\nthe communication of these regularities to others (PAO 130).\nGiven that our most immediate relation to the world is thus mediated by\nthe categories (which also include the relations of part-whole,\ncause-effect, inter alia), it is natural to suppose that these\nfictions will resurface in our more sophisticated theories, e.g., in the\nform of the atom (a simple material substance). Vaihinger is not\nsuggesting that genuine knowledge that serves no particular practical\naim is impossible; but he is suggesting that our total theoretic image\nof the world is ultimately limited by those fictions that have been\npreserved as most adaptive for our basic practical aims (PAO\n130).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s emphasis on the deep connection between cognition\nand action have led many interpreters to liken his views to those of\nthe American pragmatists (e.g., Appiah 2017, 4; Koridze 2014; Fine\n1993, 4; and esp. Ceynowa 1993). Others have disputed this connection\n(Bouriau 2016). Vaihinger himself tells us that fictionalism and\npragmatism share important similarities, but nevertheless are\ndistinguished by the fact that pragmatism accepts, whereas\nfictionalism rejects, the principle that \u201can idea which is found\nto be useful in practice proves thereby that it is also true in\ntheory\u201d (PAO viii). So, if one defines a pragmatist\nnarrowly as someone who endorses this Jamesian definition of truth,\nVaihinger is no pragmatist; his core contention is that \u201cwe may\nnot argue from the utility of a psychical and logical construct that\nit is right\u201d (PAO 51). Nevertheless, given\nVaihinger\u2019s emphasis on the inseparability of practical and\ntheoretical thought, his view that the use of a concept can be\njustified on purely practical grounds, and so forth, it does not seem\nunfair to liken him to the pragmatist tradition in a wider sense. \n",
