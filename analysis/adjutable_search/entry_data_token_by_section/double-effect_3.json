    "main_text": "Criticisms || Consequentialist Objections\n4.1 Consequentialist Objections\n\nThose who defend the principle of double effect often assume that\ntheir opponents deny that an agent\u2019s intentions, motives, and\nattitudes are important factors in determining the permissibility of a\ncourse of action. If the permissibility of an action depended only on\nthe consequences of the action, or only on the foreseen or foreseeable\nconsequences of the action, then the distinction that grounds the\nprinciple of double effect would not have the moral significance\nclaimed for it (see the related entry on\n consequentialism).\n Some opponents of the principle of double effect do indeed deny that\nthe distinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences ever\nhas any kind of moral significance.\n\nNevertheless, many criticisms of the principle of double effect do not\nproceed from consequentialist assumptions or skepticism about the\nimportance and moral significance of distinguishing between what an\nagent intends and what an agent merely foresees. Instead, critics ask\nwhether the principle adequately codifies the moral intuitions at play\nin the cases that have been taken to be illustrations of it.\n",
