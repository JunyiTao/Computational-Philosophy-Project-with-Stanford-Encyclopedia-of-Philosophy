    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || The Complexe Significabile\n4.5 The Complexe Significabile\n\nIf there is a topic that has dominated Wodeham scholarship, it is the\ncomplexe significabile or alternatively, that which is\nsignifiable in a complex way, i.e., through a proposition. This\nmysterious entity was intended by Wodeham to function both as the\nimmediate object of propositional knowledge and as a genuine via\nmedia between two extreme theories regarding the object of\nknowledge offered by his contemporaries. Representing one extreme was\nWilliam of Ockham, who was thought by Wodeham to identify the terms of\na proposition as the actual object. This is sometimes referred to as\nthe anti-realist position. On the other hand there was Walter Chatton,\nwho argued that the object of propositional knowledge was the actual\nentity signified by the subject term of the proposition. Wodeham, in\nturn, rejected both these positions and stated that the object of\nscience was an actual state of affairs which could only be signified\nthrough a complex or a proposition. Questions and puzzles have\ncontinued to linger regarding the exact ontological status of these\nstates-of-affairs. While insisting that they have some real\nontological weight, they do not fit nicely under either of the\nAristotelian categories of real being, substance or accident. Thus,\nwithin an Aristotelian framework, it is difficult to articulate\nexactly how or in what way the complexe significabile is\nactually real.\n\nThe legacy of the complexe significabile has a somewhat\ninvolved history. We can find several examples of its use and\ndiscussion throughout the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies. However, for many years the idea was thought to originate\nwith Gregory of Rimini. Modern scholarship slowly discovered, albeit\nnot immediately, that this particular terminology was original to\nWodeham and only later adopted by Rimini. (The idea, however, has many\nprecursors evident in earlier debates over terms like dicta\nor enuntiabilia. See Klima 1993; Nuchelmans 1973; Bermon\n2007.) The most frequently cited misattribution in modern scholarship\nhas been Hubert Elie\u2019s \u201cLe complexe significabile\u201d\n(Elie 1936). In the following generation, Gedeon G\u00e0l\n(G\u00e0l 1977) discovered that Wodeham was actually the author of\nthis idea. G\u00e0l edited the first modern edition of the\nLectura Secunda dist. 1, q. 1, the traditional point of entry\ninto Wodeham\u2019s thought on the matter. Since G\u00e0l\u2019s\narticle, several studies have followed: Nuchelmans (1980), Tachau\n(1987), Grassi (1990), Zupko (1994\u20131997), Karger (1995), and\nBrower-Toland (2007). A frequent part of the contemporary discussion\ninvolves distinguishing the genuine doctrine of Adam Wodeham from\nlater versions. G\u00e0l\u2019s initial characterization of\nRimini\u2019s position as a \u201cmutilation\u201d of\nWodeham\u2019s position has exerted its influence over the subsequent\nscholarship (cf. Nuchelmans, and esp. Zupko). Most complaints stem\nfrom the idea that Rimini gives too much ontological weight to this\nmysterious entity or at least lacks the nuance of Wodeham, exposing\nthe doctrine to objections that could not be addressed to Wodeham\nhimself (cf. Zupko 1994\u20131997). Brower-Toland has recently\nchallenged this traditional reading. She suggests the \u201cradical\nnature of Wodeham\u2019s claims\u201d have largely gone\nunrecognized, and that his complexe significabile represents\na significant \u201contological addition\u201d to the Aristotelian\nsubstance-accident framework (Brower-Toland 2007:600n7,\n638\u2013640).\n",
