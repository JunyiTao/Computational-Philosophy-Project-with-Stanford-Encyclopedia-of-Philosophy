In these celebrated papers Weyl drew together \nI. Schur\u2019s work on invariants and representations of the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional rotation group, and \u00c9. Cartan\u2019s work on \nsemisimple Lie algebras. In doing so, Weyl utilized different fields \nof mathematics such as, tensor algebra, invariant theory, Riemann \nsurfaces and Hilbert\u2019s theory of integral equations. Weyl himself \nconsidered these papers his greatest work in mathematics. \n\n\nThe central role that group theoretic techniques played in Weyl\u2019s \nanalysis of spacetime was one of several factors which led Weyl to \nhis general theory of the representations and invariants of the \nclassical Lie groups. It was in the context of Weyl\u2019s investigation \nof the space-problem (see \u00a74.2) that Weyl came to appreciate the\nvalue of group theory for investigating the mathematical and \nphilosophical foundations of physical theories in general, and for \ndealing with fundamental questions motivated by the general theory of\nrelativity, in particular. \n\n\nA motivation of quite another sort, which led Weyl to his general \nrepresentation theory, was provided by Study when he attacked Weyl \nspecifically, as well as other unnamed individuals, by accusing them \n\u201cof having neglected a rich cultural domain (namely, the theory\nof invariants), indeed of having completely ignored \n it\u201d.[84]\n Weyl (1924c) replied immediately providing a new foundation for the \ntheory of invariants of the special linear groups \n\n\\(SL(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and its most important subgroups, the special\northogonal group \\(SO(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and the special symplectic group\n\\(SSp(\\bfrac{n}{2}, \\mathbb{C})\\) (for \\(n\\) even) based on algebraic\nidentities due to Capelli. In a footnote, Weyl (1924c) sarcastically\ninformed Study that \u201ceven if he [Weyl] had been as well versed\nas Study in the theory of invariants, he would not have used the\nsymbolic method in his book\nRaum, Zeit, Materie and even with the last breath of his \nlife would not have mentioned the algebraic completeness theorem for \ninvariant theory\u201d. Weyl\u2019s point was that in the context of his \nbook Raum-Zeit-Materie, the kernel-index method of tensor \nanalysis is more appropriate than the methods of the theory of \nalgebraic \n invariants.[85]\n\n\n\nWhile this account of events leading up to Weyl\u2019s groundbreaking \npapers on group theory seems reasonable enough, Hawkins (2000) has \nsuggested a fuller account, which brings into focus Weyl\u2019s deep \nphilosophical interest in the mathematical foundations of the theory \nof general relativity by drawing attention to Weyl (1924d) on tensor \nsymmetries, which, according to Hawkins, played an important role in \nredirecting Weyl\u2019s research interests toward pure \n mathematics.[86]\n Weyl (1949b, 400) himself noted that his interest in the \nphilosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity \nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups: \u201cI can say that the wish to understand what \nreally is the mathematical substance behind the formal apparatus of \nrelativity theory led me to the study of representations and \ninvariants of groups; and my experience in this regard is probably \nnot unique\u201d. Weyl\u2019s paper (Weyl (1924a)), and the first chapter\nWeyl (1925) of his celebrated papers on representation theory, have \nthe same title: \u201cThe group theoretic foundation of the tensor \ncalculus\u201d. Hawkins (1998) says, Weyl \n \n\nhad obtained through the theory of groups, and in particular through \nthe theory of group representations\u2014as augmented by his own \ncontributions\u2014what he felt was a proper mathematical \nunderstanding of tensors, tensor symmetries, and the reason they \nrepresent the source of all linear quantities that might arise in \nmathematics or physics. Once again, he had come to appreciate the \nimportance of the theory of groups\u2014and now especially the \ntheory of group representation\u2014for gaining insight into \nmathematical questions suggested by relativity theory. Unlike his \nwork on the space problem \u2026Weyl now found himself drawing upon\nfar more than the rudiments of group theory. \u2026 And of course \n Cartan[87]\n had showed that the space problem could also be resolved with the aid\nof results about representations. In short, the representation theory\nof groups had proved itself to be a powerful tool for answering the \nsort of mathematical questions that grew out of Weyl\u2019s involvement \nwith relativity theory.\n\n\n\nSomewhat later, Weyl (1939) wrote a book, entitled The Classical \nGroups, Their Invariants and Representations, in which \nhe returned to the theory of invariants and representations of the \nsemisimple Lie groups. In this work, he satisfied his ambition \n\u201cto derive the decisive results for the most important of these\ngroups by direct algebraic construction, in particular for the full \ngroup of all non-singular linear transformations and for the \northogonal group\u201d. He intentionally restricted the discussion \nof the general theory and devoted most of the book to the derivation \nof specific results for the general linear, the special linear, the \northogonal and the symplectic groups. \n4.5.2 Weyl\u2019s philosophical critique of Cartan\u2019s approach to geometry\n\n\nAs far back as the 1920s, the great French mathematician and geometer\n\u00c9lie Cartan had recognized that the notions\nof parallelism and affine connection admit of an\nimportant generalization in the sense that (1) the spaces for which\nthe notion of infinitesimal parallel transport is defined need not be\nthe tangent spaces that intrinsically arise from the differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold \\(M\\) at each of its points;\nrather, the spaces are general spaces that are not intrinsically tied\nto the differential manifold structure of \\(M\\), and (2) relevant\ngroups operate on these general spaces directly and not on the\nmanifold \\(M\\), and therefore groups play a dominant and independent\nrole. \n\n\nWeyl (1938a) published a critical review of Cartan\u2019s (1937) book in \nwhich Cartan further developed his notion of moving frames \n(\u201crep\u00e8res mobiles\u201d) and generalized \nspaces (\u201cespaces g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s\u201d).\nHowever, Weyl (1988) expressed some of his reservations to Cartan\u2019s \napproach as early as 1925; and four years later Weyl (1929e) \npresented a more detailed critique. \n\n\nCartan\u2019s approach to differential geometry is in response to the fact\nthat Euclidean geometry was generalized in two ways resulting in \nessentially two incompatible approaches to \n geometry.[88]\n The first generalization occurred with the discovery of non-Euclidean\ngeometries and with Klein\u2019s (1921) subsequent Erlanger program in \n1872, which provided a coherent group theoretical framework for the \nvarious non-Euclidean geometries. The second generalization of \nEuclidean geometry occurred when Riemann (1854) discovered Riemannian\ngeometry. \n\n\nThe two generalizations of Euclidean geometry essentially constitute \nincompatible approaches to applied geometry. In particular, while \nKlein\u2019s Erlanger program provides an appropriate group theoretical \nframework for Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, it is \nRiemannian geometry, and not Klein\u2019s group theoretic approach, which \nprovides the appropriate underlying geometric framework for \nEinstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. As Cartan observes: \n \n\nGeneral relativity threw into physics and philosophy the antagonism \nthat existed between the two principle directors of geometry, Riemann\nand Klein. The space-times of classical mechanics and of special \nrelativity are of the type of Klein, those of general relativity are \nof the type of \n Riemann.[89]\n\n\n\n\nCartan eliminated the incompatibility between the two approaches by \nsynthesizing Riemannian geometry and Klein\u2019s Erlanger program through\na further generalization of both, resulting in what Cartan called, \ngeneralized spaces (or generalized geometries). \n\n\nIn his Erlanger program, Klein provided a unified approach to the \nvarious \u201cglobal\u201d geometries by showing that each of the \ngeometries is characterized by a particular group of transformations:\nEuclidean geometry is characterized by the group of translations and \nrotations in the plane; the geometry of the sphere \n\\(S^{2}\\) is characterized by the orthogonal group \n\\(O(3)\\); and the geometry of the hyperbolic plane is \ncharacterized by the pseudo-orthogonal group \\(O(1, 2)\\). In \nKlein\u2019s approach each geometry is a (connected) manifold endowed with\na group of automorphisms, that is, a Lie group \\(G\\) of \n\u201cmotions\u201d that acts transitively on the \nmanifold, such that two figures are regarded as congruent if and only\nif there exists an element of the appropriate Lie group \\(G\\) that\ntransforms one of the figures into the other. A generalized geometry \nin Klein\u2019s sense shifts the emphasis from the underlying manifold or \nspace to the group. Thus a Klein geometry (space) consists of, (1) a \nsmooth manifold, (2) a Lie group \\(G\\) (the principal group of the\ngeometry), and (3) a transitive action of \\(G\\) on the manifold. \nBesides being \u201cglobal\u201d, a Klein geometry (space) is \ncompletely homogeneous in the sense that its points cannot be \ndistinguished on the basis of geometric relations because the \ntransitive group action preserves such relations. \n\n\nAs Weyl (1949b) describes it, Klein\u2019s approach to the various \n\u201cglobal\u201d geometries is very suited to Einstein\u2019s theory \nof special relativity: \n \n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s special relativity theory the \nfour-dimensional world of the spacetime points is a Klein space \ncharacterized by a definite group \\(\\Gamma\\); and that group is the \n\u2026 group of Euclidean similarities\u2014with one very \nimportant difference however. The orthogonal transformations, i.e., \nthe homogeneous linear transformations which leave \n\n\\[\nx^{2}_{1} + x^{2}_{2} + x^{2}_{3} + x^{2}_{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\nunchanged have to be replaced by the Lorentz transformations leaving \n\n\\[\nx^{2}_{1} + x^{2}_{2} + x^{2}_{3} - x^{2}_{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\ninvariant.\n\n\n\nHowever, with the advent of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity \nthe emphasis shifted from global homogeneous geometric \nstructures to local inhomogeneous structures. Whereas Klein \nspaces are global and fully homogeneous, the Riemannian metric \nstructure underlying Einstein\u2019s general theory is local and \ninhomogeneous. A general Riemannian space admits of no isometry other\nthan the identity. \n\n\nReferring to Cartan (1923a), Weyl (1929e) says that Cartan\u2019s \ngeneralization of Klein geometries consists in adapting Klein\u2019s \nErlanger program to infinitesimal geometry by applying Klein\u2019s \nErlanger program to the tangent plane rather than to the manifold \n itself.[90]\n\n \n\nCartan developed a general scheme of infinitesimal geometry in which \nKlein\u2019s notions were applied to the tangent plane and not to the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) itself.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:\nCartan\u2019s generalization\n\n\n\nFigure 13 above, adapted from Sharpe (1997), may help in clarifying \nthe discussion. The generalization of Euclidean geometry to a \nRiemannian space (the left vertical blue arrow) says: \n\nA general Riemannian space approximates Euclidean space only\nlocally; that is, at each point \\(p \\in M\\) there exists\na tangent space \\(T(M_{p})\\) that arises\nintrinsically from the underlying differential structure of\n\\(M\\).\nIn addition, a Riemannian space is inhomogeneous through the\nintroduction of curvature.\n\n\n\nAnalogously, Cartan\u2019s generalization of a Klein space to a Cartan \nspace (the right vertical blue arrow) says: \n\nCartan\u2019s generalized space \\(\\Sigma(M)\\) approximates a\nKlein space only locally; that is, at each point \\(p \\in M\\) there\nexists a \u201cTangent Space\u201d, that is, a\nKlein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). Note that a Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is itself a generalized space (in the sense of\nCartan) with zero curvature; it possesses perfect homogeneity.\nIn addition, Cartan\u2019s generalized space \\(\\Sigma(M)\\) is\ninhomogeneous by the introduction of curvature.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:\nCartan\u2019s generalized space\n\n\n\nCartan\u2019s generalized space \\(\\Sigma\\)(M) is the space of all \n\u201cTangent Spaces\u201d (i.e., all Klein spaces\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p}))\\) and contains a mixture of \nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous spaces (see figure 14). \n\n\nFinally, Cartan\u2019s generalization of Riemannian space (lower \nhorizontal red arrow) (figure 13) turns on the recognition that the \n\u201cTangent Space\u201d in Cartan\u2019s sense is not\nthe same, or need not be the same, as the ordinary tangent \nspace that arises naturally from the underlying differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold. Cartan\u2019s \n\u201cTangent Space\u201d\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) denotes what is known as\na fiber in modern fiber bundle language, where the manifold\n\\(M\\) is called the base space of the fiber bundle. \n\n\nIn Weyl (1929e, 1988) and to a lesser extent in Weyl (1938a), Weyl\nobjected to Cartan\u2019s approach by noting that Cartan\u2019s\n\u201cTangent Space\u201d, namely the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) associated with each point of the manifold \\(M\\),\ndoes not arise intrinsically from the differential structure of the\nmanifold the way the ordinary tangent vector space does. Weyl\ntherefore noted that it is necessary to impose certain non-intrinsic\nembedding conditions on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) that specify how the\n\u201cTangent Space\u201d\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is associated with each point of the manifold\n\\(M\\). Paraphrasing Weyl, the situation is as follows: We assume that\nwe can associate a copy \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) of a given Klein space with\neach point \\(p\\) of the manifold \\(M\\) and that the displacement of\nthe Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) to the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) associated with an infinitely nearby point\n\\(p'\\in M\\), constitutes an isomorphic representation of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) by means of an infinitesimal\naction of the group \\(G\\). In choosing an admissible frame of\nreference \\(f\\) for each Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), their points\nare represented by\nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\). Any two frames \n\\(f,f'\\) are related by a group \nelement \\(s \\in G\\), and a succession of transformations\n\\(f \\rightarrow f'\\) and \\(f' \\rightarrow f''\\) by \\(s \\in G\\) and \n\\(t \\in G\\) respectively, relates \\(f\\) and \n\\(f''\\) by the group composition \\(t \\circ s \\in G\\). \n\n\nNothing so far has been said about how specifically the \n\u201cTangent Space\u201d \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is connected to the manifold. \nSince \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is supposed to be a \ngeneralization of the ordinary tangent space which arises \nintrinsically from the local differential structure of \\(M\\), Weyl\nsuggests that certain embedding conditions have to be imposed on the \nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). \n\nEmbedding Condition 1: We must first designate\na point as the center of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) and then require that they\ncoincide or cover the point \\(p \\in M\\). This leads, Weyl says, to a\nrestriction in the choice of a normal coordinate system\n\\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). And because \\(G\\) acts transitively, a\nnormal coordinate system \\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) can be chosen\nsuch that the normal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) vanish at the center, that\nis, \\(\\xi^{1} = \\xi^{2} = \\cdots = 0\\). The group \\(G\\) is therefore\nrestricted to the subgroup \\(G_{0}\\) of all representations of \\(G\\)\nwhich leave the center invariant.\n\n\nEmbedding Condition 2: The notion of a tangent\nplane also requires that there is a one-to-one linear mapping between\nthe line elements of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) starting \nfrom 0, with the line elements of \\(M\\) starting from \\(p\\). \nThis means that the number of dimension of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) has the same number of dimension\nas the manifold \\(M\\).\n\nEmbedding Condition 3: The infinitesimal \ndisplacement \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow \\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) will carry an \ninfinitesimal vector at the center of \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), which is in one-to-one \ncorrespondence with a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), to the \ncenter of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\). \n\n\nNo further conditions need be imposed according to Weyl. If we\ndisplace \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) by successive steps around a curve\n\\(\\gamma\\) back to the point \\(p \\in M\\) then the final position of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is obtained from its original poition or orientation\nby a certain automorphism \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow\n\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). This automorphism is Cartan\u2019s generalization of\nRiemann\u2019s concept of curvature along the curve \\(\\gamma\\) on\n\\(M\\). \n\n\nAccording to Weyl, the \u201cTangent Space\u201d\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is not uniquely determined by the differential\nstructure of \\(M\\). If \\(G\\) were the affine group, Weyl says, then\nthe conditions above would fully specify the normal\ncoordinate system \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) as a function\nof the chosen local coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) on \\(M\\). Since this is not\nthe case if \\(G\\) is a more extensive group than the affine group,\nWeyl concludes that the\n\u201cTangent Space\u201d \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) \u201cis not as yet uniquely \ndetermined by the nature of \\(M\\), and so long as this is not \naccomplished we can not say that Cartan\u2019s theory deals only with the \nmanifold \\(M\\).\u201d Weyl adds: \n \n\nConversely, the tangent plane in \\(p\\) in the ordinary sense, that\nis, the linear manifold of line elements in \\(p\\), is a centered \naffine space; its group \\(G\\) is not a matter of convention. This \nhas always appeared to me to be a deficiency of the theory \u2026.\n\n\n\nThe reader may wish to consult Ryckman (2005, 171\u2013173), who \nargues \u201cthat a philosophical contention, indeed, \nphenomenological one, underlies the stated mathematical reasons that \nkept him [Weyl] for a number of years from concurring with Cartan\u2019s \n\u201dmoving frame\u201c approach to differential geometry\u201d. \n\n\nIn 1949 Weyl explicitly acknowledged and praised Cartan\u2019s approach. \nUnlike his earlier critical remarks, he now considered it to be a \nvirtue that the frame of reference in \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is independent of the choice of \ncoordinates on \\(M\\). Weyl (1949b) says of the traditional \napproach and Cartan\u2019s new approach to geometry: \n \n\nHence we have here before us the natural general basis on which that \nnotion rests. The infinitesimal trend in geometry initiated by Gauss\u2019\ntheory of curved surfaces now merges with that other line of thought \nthat culminated in Klein\u2019s Erlanger program. \n\n\nIt is not advisable to bind the frame of reference in \\(\\Sigma_{p}\\)\nto the coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) covering the neighborhood of \\(p\\) in\n\\(M\\). In this respect the old treatment of affinely connected\nmanifolds is misleading. \u2026 [I]n the modern development of\ninfinitesimal geometry in the large, where it combines with topology\nand the associated Klein spaces appear under the name of fibres, it\nhas been found best to keep the r\u00e9p\u00e8res, the\nframes of the fibre spaces, independent of the coordinates of the\nunderlying manifold.\n\n\n\nMoreover, in 1949, Weyl also emphasizes that it is necessary to \nemploy Cartan\u2019s method if one wishes to fit Dirac\u2019s theory of the \nelectron into general relativity. Weyl (1949b) says: \n \n\nWhen one tries to fit Dirac\u2019s theory of the electron into general \nrelativity, it becomes imperative to adopt the Cartan method. For \nDirac\u2019s four \\(\\psi\\)-components are relative to a Cartesian (or rather \na Lorentz) frame. One knows how they transform under transition from \none Lorentz frame to another (spin representation of the Lorentz \ngroup); but this law of transformation is of such a nature that it \ncannot be extended to arbitrary linear transformations mediating \nbetween affine frames.\n\n\n\nWeyl is here referring to his three important papers, which appeared \nin 1929\u2014the same year in which he had published his detailed \ncritique of Cartan\u2019s method\u2014in which he investigates the \nadaptation of Dirac\u2019s theory of the special relativistic electron to \nthe theory of general relativity, and where he develops the \ntetrad or Vierbein formalism for the representation\nof local two-component spinor structures on Lorentz \nmanifolds. \n4.5.3 Weyl\u2019s New Gauge Principle and Dirac\u2019s Special Relativistic Electron\n\n\nOnly a year after Pauli\u2019s review article in 1921, in which Pauli had \nargued that Weyl\u2019s defence of his unified field theory deprives it of\nits inherent convincing power from a physical point of view, \nSchr\u00f6dinger (1922) suggested the possibility that Weyl\u2019s 1918 \ngauge theory could suitably be employed in the quantum mechanical \ndescription of the \n electron.[91]\n Similar proposals were subsequently made by Fock (1926) and London \n(1927). \n\n\nWith the advent of the quantum theory of the electron around 1927/28 \nWeyl abandoned his gauge theory of 1918. He did so because in the new\nquantum theory a different kind of gauge invariance associated with \nDirac\u2019s theory of the electron was discovered which, as had been \nsuggested by Fock (1926) and London (1927), more adequately accounted\nfor the conservation of electric \n charge.[92]\n Why did Weyl hold on to his gauge theory for almost a decade despite \na preponderance of compelling empirical arguments that were mounted \nagainst it by Einstein, Pauli and \n others?[93]\n In one of Weyl\u2019s (1918/1998) last letters to Einstein concerning his \nunified field theory, Weyl made it clear that it was mathematics \nand not physics that was the driving force behind his unified \nfield \n theory.[94]\n\n \n\nIncidentally, you must not believe that it was because of physics \nthat I introduced the linear differential form d\\(\\varphi\\) in addition \nto the quadratic form. I wanted rather to eliminate this \n\u201cinconsistency\u201d which always has been a bone of \ncontention to \n me.[95]\n And then, to my surprise, I realized that it looked as if it might \nexplain electricity. You clap your hands above your head and shout: \nBut physics is not made this way!\n\n\n\nAs London (1927, 376\u2013377) remarks, one must admire Weyl\u2019s \nimmense courage in developing his gauge invariant interpretation of \nelectromagnetism and holding on to it on the mere basis of purely \nformal considerations. London observes that the principle of \nequivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, which prompted \nEinstein to provide a geometrical interpretation of gravity, was at \nleast a physical fact underlying gravitational theory. In contrast, \nan analogous fact was not known in the theory of electricity; \nconsequently, it would seem that there was no compelling physical \nreason to think that rigid rods and ideal clocks would be under the \nuniversal influence of the electromagnetic field. To the contrary, \nLondon says, experience strongly suggests that atomic clocks exhibit \nsharp spectral lines that are unaffected by their history in the \npresence of a magnetic field, contrary to Weyl\u2019s non-integrability \nassumption. London concludes, that in the face of such elementary \nempirical facts it must have been an unusually clear metaphysical \nconviction which prevented Weyl from abandoning his idea that nature \nought to make use of the beautiful geometrical possibilities that a \npure infinitesimal geometry offers. \n\n\nIn 1955, shortly before his death, Weyl wrote an \n addendum[96]\n to his 1918 paper Gravitation und \nElektrizit\u00e4t, in which he looks back at \nhis early attempt to find a unified field theory and explains why he \nreinterpreted his gauge theory of 1918, a decade later. \n \n\nThis work stands at the beginning of attempts to construct a \n\u201cunified field theory\u201d which subsequently were continued \nby many, it seems to me, without decisive results. As is known, the \nproblem relentlessly occupied Einstein in particular, until his end. \n\u2026 The strongest argument for my theory appeared to be that \ngauge invariance corresponds to the principle of the conservation of \nelectric charge just as coordinate invariance corresponds to the \nconservation theorem of energy-impulse. Later, quantum theory \nintroduced the Schr\u00f6dinger-Dirac potential \\(\\psi\\) of the \nelectron-positron field; the latter revealed an experimentally based \nprinciple of gauge invariance which guaranteed the conservation of \ncharge and which connected the \\(\\psi\\) with the electromagnetic \npotentials \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) in the same way that my \nspeculative theory had connected the gravitational potentials \n\\(g_{ik}\\) with \\(\\varphi_{i}\\), where,\nin addition, the \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) are measured in known \natomic rather than unknown cosmological units. I have no doubts that \nthe principle of gauge invariance finds its correct place here and \nnot, as I believed in 1918, in the interaction of electromagnetism \nand gravity.\n\n\n\nBy the late 1920s Weyl\u2019s methodological approach to gauge theory \nunderwent an \u201cempirical turn\u201d. In contrast to \\(a\\) \npriori geometrical reasoning, which guided his early \nunification attempts\u2014Weyl calls it a \u201cspeculative \ntheory\u201d in the above citation\u2014by 1928/1929 Weyl \nemphasized experimentally-based principles which underlie \ngauge \n invariance.[97]\n\n\n\nIn early 1928 P. A. M. Dirac provided the first physically compelling\ntheoretical account of the dynamics of an electron in the presence of\nan electric field. The components \\(\\psi^{i} (x)\\)\nof Dirac\u2019s four-component wave function or spinor field in \nMinkowski space, \\(\\psi(x) = (\\psi^{1}(x), \\psi^{2}(x), \\psi^{3}(x), \n\\psi^{4}(x))\\), are complex-valued functions that \nsatisfy Dirac\u2019s first-order partial differential equation and provide\nprobabilistic information about the electron\u2019s dynamical behaviour, \nsuch as angular momentum and location. Prior to the appearance of \nspinor fields \\(\\psi\\) in Dirac\u2019s equation, it was generally \nthought that scalars, vectors and tensors provided an adequate system\nof mathematical objects that would allow one to provide a \nmathematical description of reality independently of the choice of \ncoordinates or reference \n frames.[98]\n For example, spin zero particles \\((\\pi\\) mesons, \\(\\alpha\\) particles) \ncould be described by means of scalars; spin 1 particles (deuterons) \nby vectors, and spin 2 particles (hypothetical gravitons) by tensors.\nHowever, the most frequently occurring particles in Nature are \nelectrons, protons, and neutrons. They are spin \n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particles, called fermions that \nare properly described by mathematical objects called \nspinors, which are neither scalars, vectors or \n tensors.[99]\n Weyl referred to the \\(\\psi(x)\\) in Dirac\u2019s equation as the \n\u201cDirac quantity\u201d and von Neumann called it the \n\u201c\\(\\psi(x)\\)-vector\u201d. Both von Neumann and Weyl, and \nothers, immediately recognized that Dirac had introduced something \nthat was new in theoretical physics. v. Neumann (1928, 876) remarks: \n \n\n\u2026 \\(\\psi\\) does by no means have the relativistic transformation \nproperties of a common four-vector. \u2026 The case of a quantity \nwith four components that is not a four-vector is a case which has \nnever occurred in relativity theory; the Dirac \\(\\psi\\)-vector is the \nfirst example of this type.\n\n\n\n(Weyl (1929c)) notes that the spinor representation of the orthogonal\ngroup \\(O(1, 3)\\) cannot be extended to a representation of the \ngeneral linear group \\(GL(n)\\), \\(n = 4\\), with the \nconsequence that it is necessary to employ the Vierbein, \ntetrad or Lorentz-structure formulation of the theory of \ngeneral relativity in order to incorporate Dirac\u2019s spinor fields \n\\(\\psi(x)\\): \n \n\nThe tensor calculus is not the proper mathematical instrument to use \nin translating the quantum-theoretic equations of the electron over \ninto the general theory of relativity. Vectors and terms \n[tensors] are so constituted that the law which defines the \ntransformation of their components from one Cartesian set of axes to \nanother can be extended to the most general linear transformation, to\nan affine set of axes. That is not the case for quantity \\(\\psi\\), \nhowever; this kind of quantity belongs to a representation of the \nrotation group which cannot be extended to the affine group. \nConsequently we cannot introduce components of \\(\\psi\\) relative to an \narbitrary coordinate system in general relativity as we can for the \nelectromagnetic potential and field strengths. We must rather \ndescribe the metric at a point \\(p\\) by local Cartesian axes \n\\(e(a)\\) instead of by the \\(g_{pq}\\). \nThe wave field has definite components \n\\(\\psi^{+}_{1}, \\psi^{+}_{2}, \\psi^{-}_{1}, \\psi^{-}_{2}\\) \nrelative to such axes, and we know how they transform on transition to\nany other Cartesian axes in \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nImpressed by the initial success of Dirac\u2019s equation of the spinning \nelectron within the special relativistic context, Weyl adapted \nDirac\u2019s special relativistic theory of the electron to the general \ntheory of relativity in three groundbreaking papers (Weyl \n(1929b,c,d)). A complete exposition of this formalism is presented in\n(Weyl (1929b)). O\u2019Raifeartaigh (1997) says of this paper: \n \n\nAlthough not fully appreciated at the time, Weyl\u2019s 1929 paper has \nturned out to be one of the seminal papers of the century, both from \nthe philosophical and from the technical point of view.\n\n\n\nIn this ground braking paper, as well as in (Weyl (1929c,d)), Weyl \nexplicitly abandons his earlier attempt to unify electromagnetism \nwith the theory of general relativity. In his early attempt he \nassociated the electromagnetic vector potential \n\\(A_{j}(x)\\) with the additional connection \ncoefficients that arise when a conformal structure is reduced to a \nWeyl structure (see \u00a74.1). The important concept of gauge \ninvariance, however, is preserved in his 1929 paper. Rather than \nassociating gauge transformations with the scale or gauge of the \nspacetime metric tensor, Weyl now associates gauge transformations \nwith the phase of the Dirac spinor field \\(\\psi\\) that represents \nmatter. In the introduction of (Weyl (1929b)), which presents in \ndetail the new formalism, Weyl describes his reinterpretation of the \ngauge principle as follows: \n \n\nThe Dirac field-equations for \\(\\psi\\) together with the Maxwell \nequations for the four potentials \\(f_{p}\\) of the \nelectromagnetic field have an invariance property which, from a \nformal point of view, is similar to the one that I called gauge \ninvariance in my theory of gravitation and electromagnetism of 1918; \nthe equations remain invariant when one makes the simultaneous \nreplacements \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\psi \\text{ by } e^{i\\lambda}\\psi \n & \\text{and} &\n f_p \\text{ by } f_p - \\dfrac{\\partial\\lambda}{\\partial x^p},\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is understood to be an arbitrary function of\nposition in the four-dimensional world. Here the factor\n\\(\\bfrac{e}{ch}\\), where \\(- e\\) is the charge of the electron, \\(c\\)\nis the speed of light, and \\(\\bfrac{h}{\\pi}\\) is the quantum of\naction, has been absorbed in \\(f_{p}\\). The connection of this\n\u201cgauge invariance\u201d to the conservation of electric charge\nremains untouched. But an essential difference, which is significant\nfor the correspondence to experience, is that the exponent of the\nfactor multiplying \\(\\psi\\) is not real but purely imaginary. \\(\\psi\\)\nnow assumes the role that \\(ds\\) played in Einstein\u2019s old\ntheory. It seems to me that this new principle of gauge invariance,\nwhich follows not from speculation but from experiment, compellingly\nindicates that the electromagnetic field is a necessary\naccompanying phenomenon, not of gravitation, but of the material wave\nfield represented by \\(\\psi\\). Since gauge invariance includes an\narbitrary function \\(\\lambda\\) it has the character of\n\u201cgeneral\u201d relativity and can naturally only be understood\nin that context.\n\n\n\nWeyl then introduces his two-component spinor theory in Minkowski\nspace. Since one of his aims is to adapt Dirac\u2019s theory to the\ncurved spacetime of general relativity, Weyl develops a theory\nof local spinor structures for curved\n spacetime.[100]\n He achieves this by providing a systematic formulation of \nlocal tetrads or Vierbeins (orthonormal basis\nvectors). Orthonormal frames had already been introduced as early as\n1900 by Levi-Civita and Ricci. Somewhat later, Cartan had shown the\nusefulness of employing local orthonormal-basis vector fields, the\nso-called \u201cmoving frames\u201d in his investigation of\nRiemannian geometry in the 1920s. In addition, Einstein (1928) had\nused tetrads or Vierbeins in his attempt to unify gravitation and\nelectricity by resorting to distant parallelism\nwith torsion. In Einstein\u2019s theory, the effects of\ngravity and electromagnetism are associated with a specialized torsion\nof spacetime rather than with the curvature of spacetime. Since the\ncurvature vanishes everywhere, distant parallelism is a feature of\nEinstein\u2019s theory. However, distant parallelism appeared to Weyl\nto be quite unnatural from the viewpoint of Riemannian geometry. Weyl\nexpressed his criticism in all three papers (Weyl (1929b,c,d)) and he\ncontrasted the way in which Vierbeins are employed in his own work\nwith the way they were used by Einstein. In the introduction Weyl\n(1929b) says: \n \n\nI prefer not to believe in distant parallelism for a number of \nreasons. First, my mathematical attitude resists accepting such an \nartificial geometry; it is difficult for me to understand the force \nthat would keep the local tetrads at different points and in rotated \npositions in a rigid relationship. There are, I believe, two \nimportant physical reasons as well. In particular, by loosening the \nrigid relationship between the tetrads at different points, the gauge\nfactor \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\), which remains arbitrary \nwith respect to the quantity \\(\\psi\\), changes from a constant to an \narbitrary function of spacetime location; that is, only through the \nloosening of the rigidity does the actual gauge invariance become \nunderstandable. Secondly, the possibility to rotate the tetrads at \ndifferent points independently from each other, is as we shall see, \nequivalent to the symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor or with the \nvalidity of its conservation law.\n\n\n\nEvery tetrad uniquely determines the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime\nmetric \\(g_{ij}\\). However, the converse does not hold since the\ntetrad has 16 independent components whereas the spacetime metric,\n\\(g_{ij} = g_{ji}\\), has only 10 independent components. The extra 6\ndegrees of freedom of the tetrads that are not determined by the\nmetric may be represented by the elements of a 6-parameter internal\nLorentz group. That is, the local tetrads are determined by the\nspacetime metric up to local Lorentz transformations. The tetrad\nformalism made it possible, therefore, for Weyl to derive, as a\nspecial case of Noether\u2019s second\n theorem[101],\n the energy-momentum conservation laws for general coordinate\ntransformations and the internal Lorentz transformations of the\ntetrads. Moreover, Weyl had always emphasized the strong analogy\nbetween gravitation and electricity. The tetrad formalism and the\nconservation laws both made explicit and supported this analogy. \n\n\nWeyl introduced the final section of his seminal 1929 paper saying \n\u201cWe now come to the critical part of the theory\u201d, and \npresented a derivation of electromagnetism from the new gauge \nprinciple. The initial step in Weyl\u2019s derivation exploits the \nintrinsic gauge freedom of his two-component theory of spinors for \nMinkowski space, namely \n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) \\rightarrow e^{i\\lambda}\\psi(x),\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere the gauge factor is a constant. Since Weyl wished to adapt his \ntheory to the curved spacetime of general relativity, the above phase\ntransformation must be generalized to accommodate local \ntetrads. That is, each spacetime point has its own tetrad and \ntherefore its own point-dependent gauge factor. The phase \ntransformation is thus given by \n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) \\rightarrow e^{i\\lambda(x)}\\psi(x),\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere the \\(\\lambda(x)\\) is a function of spacetime. Weyl says: \n \n\nWe come now to the critical part of the theory. In my view the origin\nand the necessity for the electromagnetic field lie in the following \njustification. The components \\(\\psi_{1},\\psi_{2}\\) \nare, in fact, not uniquely determined by the tetrad but only to the \nextent that they can still be multiplied by an arbitrary \n\u201cgauge-factor\u201d \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\) of \nabsolute value 1. The transformation of the \\(\\psi\\) induced by a \nrotation of the tetrad is determined only up to such a factor. In the\nspecial theory of relativity one must regard this gauge factor as a \nconstant, since we have here only a single point-independent tetrad. \nThis is different in the general theory of relativity. Every point \nhas its own tetrad, and hence its own arbitrary gauge factor, because\nthe gauge factor necessarily becomes an arbitrary function of \nposition through the removal of the rigid connection between tetrads \nat different points.\n\n\n\nToday, the concept of gauge invariance plays a central role in \ntheoretical physics. Not until 1954 did Yang and Mills (1954) \ngeneralize Weyl\u2019s electromagnetic gauge concept to the case of the \nnon-Abelian group \n \\(O(3)\\).[102]\n Although Weyl\u2019s reinterpretation of gauge invariance had been \npreceded by suggestions from London and Fock, it was Weyl, according \nto O\u2019Raifeartaigh and Straumann (2000), \n \n\nwho emphasized the role of gauge invariance as a symmetry \nprinciple from which electromagnetism can be derived. It took \nseveral decades until the importance of this symmetry \nprinciple\u2014in its generalized form to non-Abelian gauge groups \ndeveloped by Yang, Mills, and others\u2014also became fruitful for a\ndescription of the weak and strong interactions. The mathematics of \nthe non-Abelian generalization of Weyl\u2019s 1929 paper would have been \nan easy task for a mathematician of his rank, but at the time there \nwas no motivation for this from the physics side.\n\n\n\nIt is interesting in this context to consider the following remarks \nby Yang. Referring to Einstein\u2019s objection to Weyl\u2019s 1918 gauge \ntheory, Yang (1986, 18) asked, \u201cwhat has happened to Einstein\u2019s\noriginal objection after quantum mechanics inserted an \\(-i\\) into\nthe scale factor and made it into a phase factor?\u201d Yang \ncontinuous: \n \n\nApparently no one had, after 1929, relooked at Einstein\u2019s objection \nuntil I did in 1983. The result is interesting and deserves perhaps \nto be a footnote in the history of science: Let us take Einstein\u2019s \nGedankenexperiment \u2026. When the two clocks come back, because \nof the insertion of the factor \\(-i\\), they would not have \ndifferent scales but different phases. That would not influence their\nrates of time-keeping. Therefore, Einstein\u2019s original objection \ndisappears. But you can ask a further question: Can one measure their\nphase difference? Well, to measure a phase difference one must do an \ninterference experiment. Nobody knows how to do an interference \nexperiment with big objects like clocks. However, one can do \ninterference experiments with electrons. So let us change Einstein\u2019s \nGedankenexperiment to one of bringing electrons back along two \ndifferent paths and ask: Can one measure the phase difference? The \nanswer is yes. That was in fact a most important development in 1959 \nand 1960 when Aharonov and Bohm realized\u2014completely \nindependently of Weyl\u2014that electromagnetism has some meaning \nwhich was not understood \n before.[103]\n\n\n\n\nWe end the discussion on Weyl\u2019s gauge theory by quoting the following\nremarks by Dyson (1983). \n \n\nA more recent example of a great discovery in mathematical physics \nwas the idea of a gauge field, invented by Hermann Weyl in 1918. This\nidea has taken only 50 years to find its place as one of the basic \nconcepts of modern particle physics. Quantum chromodynamics, the most\nfashionable theory of the particle physicists in 1981, is \nconceptually little more than a synthesis of Lie\u2019s group-algebras \nwith Weyl\u2019s gauge fields. \n\n\nThe history of Weyl\u2019s discovery is quite unlike the history of Lie \ngroups and Grassmann algebras. Weyl was neither obscure nor \nunrecognized, and he was working in 1918 in the most fashionable area\nof physics, the newborn theory of general relativity. He invented \ngauge fields as a solution of the fashionable problem of unifying \ngravitation with electromagnetism. For a few months gauge fields were\nat the height of fashion. Then it was discovered by Weyl and others \nthat they did not do what was expected of them. Gauge fields were in \nfact no good for the purpose for which Weyl invented them. They \nquickly became unfashionable and were almost forgotten. But then, \nvery gradually over the next fifty years, it became clear that gauge \nfields were important in a quite different context, in the theory of \nquantum electrodynamics and its extensions leading up to the recent \ndevelopment of quantum chromodynamics. The decisive step in the \nrehabilitation of gauge fields was taken by our Princeton colleague \nFrank Yang and his student Bob Mills in 1954, one year before Hermann\nWeyl\u2019s death [Yang and Mills, 1954]. There is no evidence that Weyl \never knew or cared what Yang and Mills had done with his brain-child.\n\n\n\nSo the story of gauge fields is full of ironies. A fashionable idea, \ninvented for a purpose which turns out to be ephemeral, survives a \nlong period of obscurity and emerges finally as a corner-stone of \nphysics.\n\n4.5.4 Weyl\u2019s two-component Neutrino theory\n\n\nIt is remarkable that Weyl\u2019s (1929b) two-component spinor formalism \nled him to anticipate the existence of particles that violate \nconservation of parity, that is, left-right symmetry. In 1929 \nleft-right symmetry was taken for granted and considered a basic fact\nof all the laws of Nature. Weyl formulated the four-component Dirac \nspinor \\(\\psi\\) in terms of a two-component left-handed Weyl spinor \n\\(\\psi_{L}\\) and a two-component right-handed Weyl spinor\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\): \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\psi &= (\\psi^{1}, \\psi^{2}, \\psi^{3}, \\psi^{4})^{T} \\\\\n &= (\\psi^{1}_{L}, \\psi^{2}_{L}, \\psi^{1}_{R}, \\psi^{2}_{R})^{T} \\\\\n &= (\\psi_L, \\psi_R)^T\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nThe four-component Dirac spinor, formulated in terms of the two Weyl \nspinors \n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\left[\\matrix{\\psi_L \\\\ \\psi_R}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\n\npreserves parity; it applies to all massive spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\)\nparticles (fermions) and all massive fermions are known to obey parity\nconservation. However, a single Weyl spinor, either \\(\\psi_{L}\\) or\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\), does not preserve parity. Weyl noted that instead of the\nfour-component Dirac spinor \u201ctwo components suffice if the\nrequirement of left-right symmetry (parity) is dropped\u201d. A\nlittle later he added, \u201cthe restriction 2 removes the\nequivalence of left and right.  It is only the fact that left-right\nsymmetry actually appears in Nature that forces us to introduce a\nsecond pair of \\(\\psi\\)-components\u201d. Weyl\u2019s two-spinor\nversion of the Dirac equation is a coupled system of\nequations requiring both Weyl spinors \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and \\(\\psi_{R}\\) in\norder to preserve parity. Weyl considerd massless particles in his\ntwo-spinor version of the Dirac equation.  In this case, the equations\nof the two-spinor version of Dirac\u2019s equation decouple,\nyielding an equation for \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and for \\(\\psi_{R}\\). These\nequations are independent of each other, and the equation for the\n2-component left-handed Weyl spinor \\(\\psi_{L}\\) is\ncalled Weyl\u2019s equation; it is applicable to the\nmassless particle called the\n neutrino[104],\na spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particle, that was discovered in 1956. Yang\n(1986, 12) remarks \n \n\nNow I come to another piece of work of Weyl\u2019s which dates back to \n1929, and is called Weyl\u2019s two-component neutrino theory. He invented\nthis theory in 1929 in one of his very important articles \u2026 as\na mathematical possibility satisfying most of the requirements of \nphysics. But it was rejected by him and by subsequent physicists \nbecause it did not satisfy left-right symmetry. With the realisation \nthat left-right symmetry was not exactly right in 1957 it became \nclear that this theory of Weyl\u2019s should immediately be re-looked at. \nSo it was and later it was verified theoretically and experimentally \nthat this theory gave, in fact, the correct description of the \nneutrino.\n\n4.5.5 The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics\n\n\nDuring the interval from 1924\u201326, in which Weyl was intensely \noccupied with the pure mathematics of Lie groups, the essentials of \nthe formal apparatus of the new revolutionary theory of quantum \nmechanics had been completed by Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger and \nothers. As if to make up for lost time, Weyl immediately returned \nfrom pure mathematics to theoretical physics, and applied his new \ngroup theoretical results to quantum mechanics. As Yang (1986, 9, 10)\ndescribes it, \n \n\nIn the midst of Weyl\u2019s profound research on Lie groups there\noccurred a great revolution in physics, namely the development of\nquantum mechanics. We shall perhaps never know Weyl\u2019s initial\nreaction to this development, but he soon got into the act and studied\nthe mathematical structure of the new mechanics. There resulted a\npaper of 1927 and later a book, this book together with Wigner\u2019s\narticles and Gruppen Theorie und Ihre Anwendung auf die Quanten\nMechanik der Atome were instrumental in introducing group theory\ninto the very language of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\nMehra and Rechenberg (2000, 482) note in this context: \n\u201cActually, we have mentioned in previous volumes Weyl\u2019s early \nreactions to both matrix mechanics (in 1925) and wave mechanics (in \nearly 1926), and they were very enthusiastic. Therefore, we have to \nassume quite firmly that it was only his deep involvement with the \nlast stages of his work on the theory of semisimple continuous groups\nthat prevented Weyl \u2018to get in the act\u2019 \nimmediately.\u201d \n\n\nWeyl was particularly well positioned to handle some of the \nmathematical and foundational problems of the new theory of quantum \nmechanics. Almost every aspect of his mathematical expertise, in \nparticular, his recent work on group theory and his very early work \non the theory of singular differential-integral equations \n(1908\u20131911), provided him with the precise tools for solving \nmany of the concrete problems posed by the new theory: the theory of \nHilbert space, singular differential equations, eigenfunction \nexpansions, the symmetric group, and unitary representations of Lie \ngroups. \n\n\nWeyl\u2019s (1927) paper, referred to by Yang above, is entitled \nQuantenmechanik und Gruppentheorie (Quantum Mechanics \nand Group Theory). In it, Weyl provides an analysis of the \nfoundations of quantum mechanics and he emphasizes the fundamental \nrole Lie groups play in that \n theory.[105]\n Weyl begins the paper by raising two questions: (1) how do I arrive \nat the self-adjoint operators, which represent a given quantity of a \nphysical system whose constitution is known, and (2), what is the \nphysical interpretation of these operators and which physical \nconsequences can be derived from them? Weyl suggests that while the \nsecond question has been answered by von Neumann, the first question \nhas not yet received a satisfactory answer, and Weyl proposes to \nprovide one with the help of group theory. \n\n\nIn a way, Weyl\u2019s 1927 paper was programmatic in character; nearly all\nthe topics of that paper were taken up again a year later in his \nfamous book (Weyl (1928)) entitled Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik (The Theory of Groups and Quantum \nMechanics). The book emerged from the lecture notes taken by a \nstudent named F. Bohnenblust of Weyl\u2019s lectures given in Z\u00fcrich \nduring the winter semester 1927\u201328. A revised edition of that \nbook appeared in 1931. In the preface to the first edition Weyl says:\n\n \n\nAnother time I venture on stage with a book that belongs only half to\nmy professional field of mathematics, the other half to physics. The \nexternal reason is not very different from that which led some time \nago to the origin of the book Raum Zeit Materie. In the \nwinter term 1927/28 Z\u00fcrich was suddenly deprived of all \ntheoretical physics by the simultaneous departures of Debye and \nSchr\u00f6dinger. I tried to fill the gap by changing an already \nannounced lecture course on group theory into one on group theory and\nquantum mechanics. \n \u2026 \nSince I have for some years been deeply occupied with the theory of\nthe representation of continuous groups, it appeared to me at this\npoint to be a fitting and useful project, to provide an organically\ncoherent account of the knowledge in this field won by mathematicians,\non such a scale and in such a form, that is suitable for the\nrequirements of quantum physics.\n\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s book is one of the first textbooks on the new theory of \nquantum mechanics. As Weyl indicates in the preface it was necessary \nfor him to include a short account of the foundation of quantum \ntheory in order to be able to show how the theory of groups finds its\napplication in that theory. If the book fulfils its purpose, Weyl \nsuggests, then the reader should be able to learn from it the \nessentials of both the theory of groups and quantum theory. Weyl\u2019s \naim was to explain the mathematics to the physicists and the physics \nto the mathematicians. However, as Yang (1986, 10) points out, \nreferring to Weyl\u2019s book: \n \n\nWeyl was a mathematician and a philosopher. He liked to deal with \nconcepts and the connection between them. His book was very famous, \nand was recognized as profound. Almost every theoretical physicist \nborn before 1935 has a copy of it on his bookshelves. But very few \nread it: Most are not accustomed to Weyl\u2019s concentration on the \nstructural aspects of physics and feel uncomfortable with his \nemphasis on concepts. The book was just too abstract for most \nphysicists.\n\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s book (Weyl (1931b, 2 edn)) is remarkably complete for such an \nearly work and covers many topics. Chapters I and III are mainly \nconcerned with preliminary mathematical concepts. The first chapter \nprovides an account of the theory of finite dimensional Hilbert \nspaces and the third chapter is an exposition of the unitary \nrepresentation theory of finite groups and compact Lie groups. \nChapter II is entitled Quantum Theory; it is the earliest \nsystematic and comprehensive account of the new quantum theory. \nChapter IV, entitled Application of the Theory of Groups\nto Quantum Mechanics, is divided into four parts. In part A, \nentitled The Rotation Group, Weyl provides a systematic \nexplanatory account of the theory of atomic spectra in terms of the \nunitary representation theory of the rotation group, followed by a \ndiscussion of the selection and intensity rules. Part B is entitled \nThe Lorentz Group. After discussing the spin of the electron\nand its role in accounting for the anomalous Zeeman effect, Weyl \npresents Dirac\u2019s theory of the relativistic quantum mechanics of the \nelectron and develops in detail the theory of an electron in a \nspherically symmetric field, including an analysis of the fine \nstructure of the spectrum. In part C, entitled The Permutation \nGroup, Weyl applies the Pauli exclusion principle to explicate \nthe periodic table of the elements. Next, Weyl develops the second \nquantization of the Maxwell and Dirac fields required for the \nanalysis of many body relativistic systems. Weyl noted in the preface\nto the second edition that his treatment is in accordance with the \nrecent work of Heisenberg and Pauli. It is now customary to include \nsuch a topic under the heading of relativistic quantum field theory. \nThe final part of Chapter IV, part D, is entitled Quantum\nKinematics; it provides an exposition of part II of Weyl\u2019s \n(1927) paper, mentioned earlier. Chapter V, entitled The \nSymmetric Permutation Group and the Algebra of Symmetric \nTransformations, is for the most part pure mathematics. It is \nwidely regraded to be the most difficult part of the Weyl\u2019s book. \n\n\nOverall, Weyl\u2019s treatment is quite modern except for the confusion \nregarding the positive electron (anti-electron) that at that time was\nidentified with the proton rather than with the positron, which was \ndiscovered a few years later. Weyl was quite concerned about the \nidentification of the proton with the positive electron because his \nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) led him to conclude that the mass of the positive electron\nshould equal the mass of the \n electron.[106]\n\n4.5.6 Weyl\u2019s Early Discussion of the Discrete Symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\)\n\n\nWeyl (1931b, 2 edn) analyzed Dirac\u2019s relativistic theory of the \nelectron (Dirac (1928a,b)). Although this theory correctly accounted \nfor the spin of the electron, there was however a problem because in \naddition to the positive-energy levels, Dirac\u2019s theory predicted the \nexistence of an equal number of negative-energy levels. Dirac (1930) \nreinterpreted the theory by assuming that all of the negative-energy \nlevels were normally occupied. The Pauli Exclusion Principle, which \nasserts that it is impossible for two electrons to occupy the same \nquantum state, would prevent an electron with positive energy from \nfalling into a negative- energy state. Dirac\u2019s theory also predicted \nthat one of the negative-energy electrons could be raised to a state \nof positive energy, thereby creating a \u2018hole\u2019 or \nunoccupied negative-energy state. Such a hole would behave like a \nparticle with a positive energy and a positive charge, that is, like \na positive electron. \n\n\nBecause the only fundamental particles that were known to exist at \nthat time were the electron and the proton, one was justifiably \nreluctant to postulate the existence of new particles that had not \nyet been observed experimentally; consequently, it was suggested that\nthe positive electron should be identified with the proton. However, \nWeyl was quite concerned about the identification of the proton with \nthe anti-electron. In the preface to the second German edition of his\nbook Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, Weyl (1928, 2 edn, \n1931, VII) wrote \n \n\nThe problem of the proton and the electron is discussed in connection\nwith the symmetry properties of the quantum laws with respect to the \ninterchange of right and left, past and future, and positive and \nnegative electricity. At present no acceptable solution is in sight; \nI fear, that in the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling \ntogether to form a new, serious crisis in quantum physics.\n\n\n\nWeyl had good reasons for his concern. He analyzed the invariance of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac equations under the discrete symmetries that \ncorrespond to the transformations now called \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) both for the case of relativistic quantum \nmechanics and for the case of relativistic quantum field theory, and \nconcluded in both cases that the mass of the anti-electron should be \nthe same as the mass of the electron. That the mass of the proton was\nso different from the mass of the electron, therefore, appeared to \nWeyl to constitute a new serious crisis in physics. \n\n\nIn a lecture presented at the Centenary for Hermann Weyl held at the \nETH in Z\u00fcrich, Yang (1986, 10) says of the above quote from \nWeyl\u2019s preface to the second edition of Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik: \n \n\nThis was a most remarkable passage in retrospect. The symmetry that \nhe mentioned here, of physical laws with respect to the interchange \nof right and left, had been introduced by Weyl and Wigner \nindependently into quantum physics. It was called parity \nconservation, denoted by the symbol \\(P\\). The symmetry between \nthe past and future was something that was not well understood in \n1930. It was understood later by Wigner, was called time reversal \ninvariance, and was denoted by the symbol \\(T\\). The symmetry with\nrespect to positive and negative electricity was later called charge \nconjugation invariance \\(C\\). It is a symmetry of physical laws \nwhen you change positive and negative signs of electricity. Nobody, \nto my knowledge, absolutely nobody in the year 1930, was in any way \nsuspecting that these symmetries were related in any manner. I will \ncome back to this matter later. What had prompted Weyl in 1930 to \nwrite the above passage is a great mystery to me.\n\n\n\nIt would seem that Yang\u2019s comment is misleading since it\nsuggests that Weyl did not have a good reason for his remark. In fact,\nhowever, Weyl\u2019s statement was firmly based on a detailed\nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P},\n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\).  Coleman and Kort\u00e9 (2001)\nhave shown in detail that Weyl\u2019s treatment of these symmetries\nis the same as that used today except for the fact that the\nsymmetry \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) is treated by Weyl as linear and unitary,\nrather than as antilinear and antiunitary. Weyl had presented in 1931\na complete analysis, in the context of the quantized Maxwell-Dirac\nfield equations, of the discrete symmetries that are now called\n\\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\). His\ntransformations \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) are the same as\nthose used today. His transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) are also very close to those used today except that\nWeyl\u2019s transformations were linear and unitary rather than\nantilinear and antiunitary.  Moreover, Weyl drew two very\nimportant conclusions from his analysis of these discrete\nsymmetries. First, Weyl announced that the important question of the\narrow of time had been solved because the field equations were not\ninvariant under his time-reversal transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\). Second, Weyl pointed out that the invariance of the\nfield equations under his charge-conjugation transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) implied that the mass of the\n\u2018anti-electron\u2019 is necessarily the same as that of the\nelectron; moreover, Weyl\u2019s result is the primary reason that\nDirac (1931, 61) abandoned the assignment of the proton to the role of\nthe anti-electron. Many years later Dirac (1977, 145) recalled: \n \n\nWell, what was I to do with these holes? The best I could think of \nwas that maybe the mass was not the same as the mass of the electron.\nAfter all, my primitive theory did ignore the Coulomb forces between \nthe electrons. I did not know how to bring those into the picture, \nand it could be that in some obscure way these Coulomb forces would \ngive rise to a difference in the masses. \n\n\nOf course, it is very hard to understand how this difference could be\nso big. We wanted the mass of the proton to be nearly 2000 times the \nmass of the electron, an enormous difference, and it was very hard to\nunderstand how it could be connected with just a sort of perturbation\neffect coming from Coulomb forces between the electrons. \n\n\nHowever, I did not want to abandon my theory altogether, and so I put\nit forward as a theory of electrons and protons. Of course I was very\nsoon attacked on this question of the holes having different masses \nfrom the original electrons. I think the most definite attack came \nfrom Weyl, who pointed out that mathematically the holes would have \nto have the same mass as the electrons, and that came to be the \naccepted view.\n\n\n\nAt another place Dirac (1971, 52\u201355) remarks: \n \n\nBut still, I thought there might be something in the basic idea and \nso I published it as a theory of electrons and protons, and left it \nquite unexplained how the protons could have such a different mass \nfrom the electrons. \n\n\nThis idea was seized upon by Herman [sic] Weyl. He said boldly that \nthe holes had to have the same mass as the electrons. Now Weyl was a \nmathematician. He was not a physicist at all. He was just concerned \nwith the mathematical consequences of an idea, working out what can \nbe deduced from the various symmetries. And this mathematical \napproach led directly to the conclusion that the holes would have to \nhave the same mass as the electrons. Weyl just published a blunt \nstatement that the holes must have the same mass as the electrons and\ndid not make any comments on the physical implications of this \nassertion. Perhaps he did not really care what the physical \nimplications were. He was just concerned with achieving consistent \nmathematics.\n\n\n\nDirac\u2019s characterization of Weyl\u2019s unconcern for physics seems unfair\nin light of Weyl\u2019s own statement in the preface of the second edition\nof his book, cited earlier, where he expresses the fear \u201cthat \nin the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling together to \nform a new, serious crisis in quantum physics\u201d; Weyl did care \nabout the physics. \n\n\nWeyl\u2019s analysis did have a significant impact on the development of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac theory; however, as Coleman and Kort\u00e9 (2001)\nhave argued, Weyl\u2019s early analysis of the transformations \\(\\mathbf{C}, \n\\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) was, for the most part, lost to \nsubsequent researchers and had to be essentially re-invented. \nHowever, it should be noted in this context that Schwinger (1988, \n107\u2013129) was greatly influenced by Weyl\u2019s book. Schwinger makes\nparticular reference to Weyl\u2019s work on the discrete symmetries and \nsays that this work \u201c\u2026 was the starting point of my own \nconsiderations concerning the connection between spin and statistics,\nwhich culminated in what is now referred to as the TCP\u2014or some\npermutation thereof\u2014theorem\u201d. \n4.5.7 Weyl\u2019s Philosophical Views about Quantum Mechanics\n\n\nWeyl analyzed the foundations of both the general theory of \nrelativity and the theory of quantum mechanics. For both theories, he\nprovided a coherent exposition of the mathematical structure of the \ntheory, elegant characterizations of the entities and laws postulated\nby the theory and a lucid account of how these postulates explain the\nmost significant, more directly observable, lower-level phenomena. In\nboth cases, he was also concerned with the constructive aspects of \nthe theory, that is, with the extent to which the higher-level \npostulates of the theory are necessary. \n\n\nThere is no doubt that with regard to the general theory of \nrelativity, Weyl held strong philosophical views. Some of these views\nare couched in a phenomenological language and reveal Husserl\u2019s \ninfluence on Weyl. Ryckman\u2019s (2005) study The Reign of Relativity\nprovides an extensive account of Weyl\u2019s orientation to Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology. On the other hand, many of Weyl\u2019s philosophical views \nare couched in an unequivocal empiricist-realist language. For \nexample, Weyl rejected Poincar\u00e9\u2019s geometrical conventionalism \nand forcefully argued that the spacetime metric field is physically \nreal, that it is a physically real structural field (Strukturfeld), \nwhich is determined by the physically real causal (conformal) \nstructure and the physically real inertial (projective) structure or \nguiding field (F\u00fchrungsfeld) of spacetime. He was not deterred \nin putting forward such ontological claims about the metric structure\nof spacetime despite the fact that a complete epistemologically \nsatisfactory solution to the measurement problem for the spacetime \nmetric field was not then available. In the same manner, Weyl \nforcefully advanced a field-body-relationalist ontology of spacetime \nstructure. He argued that a Leibnizian or Einstein-Machian form of \nrelationalism that is based on a pure body ontology, is not tenable, \nindeed is incoherent within the context of general relativity, and he\npresented a reductio argument, the plasticine example, to \nunderscore the necessity of the existence of a physically real \nguiding field in addition to the existence of bodies. \n\n\nHowever, in contrast to Weyl\u2019s many philosophical views with regard \nto spacetime theories, Weyl\u2019s philosophical positions regarding the \nstatus of quantum mechanics, while not absent, are not as \ntransparent. There are passages, such as the following ((Weyl, 1931b,\n2 edn, 44), which argue for the reality of photons. \n \n\nThe intensity of the monochromatic radiation that is used to generate\nthe photoelectric effect has no influence on the speed with which the\nelectrons are ejected from the metal but affects only the frequency \nof this process. Even with intensities so weak that on the classical \ntheory hours would be required before the electromagnetic energy \npassing through a given atom would attain to an amount equal to that \nof a photon, the effect begins immediately, the points at which it \noccurs being distributed irregularly over the entire metal plate. \nThis fact is a proof of the existence of light quanta that is no less\nmeaningful than the flashes of light on the scintillation screen are \nfor the corpuscular-discontinuous nature of \\(\\alpha\\)-rays.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Weyl\u2019s (1931b) discussion of the problem of \n\u2018directional quantization\u2019 in the old quantum theory and \nof the way that this problem is \u2018resolved\u2019 in the new \nquantum theory appears to have a distinctly instrumentalist flavour. \nIn a number of places, he describes the essence of the dilemma posed \nby quantum mechanics with a dispassionate precision. Consider, for \nexample, the following (Weyl, 1931b, 2 edn, 67): \n \nNatural science has a constructive character. The phenomena with which\nit deals are not independent manifestations or qualities which can be\nread off from nature, but can only be determined by means of an\nindirect method, through interaction with other bodies. Their implicit\ndefinition is bound up with definite natural laws which underlie the\ninteractions. Consider, for example, the introduction of the Galilean\nconcept of mass which essentially comes down to the following indirect\ndefinition: \u201cEach body possesses a momentum, that is, a vector\n\\(m\\overline{v}\\) which has the same direction as its velocity\n\\(\\overline{v}\\)\u2014the scalar factor \\(m\\) is called its mass. The\nlaw of momentum holds, according to which the sum of the momenta\nbefore a reaction between several bodies is the same as the sum of\ntheir momenta after the reaction.\u201d By applying this law to the\nobserved collision phenomena, one obtains data for the determination\nof the relative masses. The scientific consensus was, however, that\nsuch constructive phenomena can nevertheless be attributed to the\nthings themselves even if the manipulations, which alone can lead\nto their recognition, are not being carried out. In Quantum Theory\nwe encounter a fundamental limitation to this epistemological position\nof the constructive natural science.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult for many people to accept quantum mechanics as an \nultimate theory without at the same time giving up some form of \nrealism and adopting something like an instrumentalist view of the \ntheory. It is clear that Weyl was fully aware of this state of \naffairs, and yet in all of his published work, he refrained from \nmaking any bold statements of his views on the fundamental questions \nabout quantum reality. He did not vigorously participate in the \ndebate between Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger and the Copenhagen \nSchool nor did he offer decisive views concerning, for example, the \nEinstein, Podolsky, Rosen thought experiment or \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat. Since Weyl held \nstrong philosophical views within the context of the general theory \nof relativity, it is therefore only natural that one might have \nexpected him to take a stand with respect to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \nand whether or not one should be fully satisfied with a theory \naccording to which the cat is neither alive or dead but is in a \nsuperposition of these two states. \n\n\nThe reason for Weyl\u2019s seeming reticence concerning the \nontological/epistemological questions about quantum reality was \nalready hinted at in note 5 of \u00a72, where it was suggested that \nWeyl was not especially bothered by the counterintuitive nature of \nquantum mechanics because he held the view that \u201cobjective \nreality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the use of \nsymbols\u201d. Although Weyl (1948, 1949a, 1953) did express his \nphilosophical views about quantum theory, he did so cautiously. Weyl \n(1949a, 263) summarizes some of the features of quantum mechanics \nthat he considered of \u201cparamount philosophical \nsignificance\u201d: the measurement problem, the incompatibility of \nquantum physics with classical logic, quantum causality, the \nnon-local nature of quantum mechanics, the Leibniz-Pauli \nExclusion\nPrinciple[107],\n and the irreducible probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. At the\nend of the summary Weyl remarks: \n \n\nIt must be admitted that the meaning of quantum physics, in spite of \nall its achievements, is not yet clarified as thoroughly as, for \ninstance, the ideas underlying relativity theory. The relation of \nreality and observation is the central problem. We seem to need a \ndeeper epistemological analysis of what constitutes an experiment, a \nmeasurement, and what sort of language is used to communicate its \nresult.\n\n4.5.8 Science as Symbolic Construction\n\n\nAccording to Weyl (1948, 295), both the theory of general relativity \nand quantum mechanics force upon us the realization that \n\u201cinstead of a real spatio-temporal material being what remains \nfor us is only a construction in pure symbols\u201d. If it is \nnecessary, Weyl (1948, 302) says, that our scientific grasp of an \nobjective world must not depend on sense qualities, because of their \ninherent subjective nature, then it is for the same reason necessary \nto eliminate space and time. And Descartes gave us the means to do \nthis with his discovery of analytic geometry. \n\n\nAs Weyl (1953, 529) observes, when Newton explained the experienced \nworld through the movements of solid particles in space, he rejected \nsense qualities for the construction of the objective world, but he \nheld on to, and used an intuitively given objective space for the \nconstruction of a real world that lies behind the appearances. It was\nLeibniz who recognized the phenomenal character (Phenomenalit\u00e4t)\nof space and time as consisting in the mere ordering of phenomena; \nhowever, space and time themselves do not have an independent \nreality. \n\n\nIt is the freely created pure numbers, that is, pure symbols, \naccording to Weyl, which serve as coordinates, and which provide the \nmaterial with which to symbolically construct the objective world. In\nsymbolically constructing the objective world we are forced to \nreplace space and time through a pure arithmetical construct. Instead\nof spacetime points, \\(n\\)-tuples of pure numbers corresponding to\na given coordinate system are used. Weyl (1948, 303) says: \n \n\n\u2026 the laws of physics are viewed as arithmetic laws between \nnumerical values of variable magnitudes, in which spatial points and \nmoments of time are represented through their numerical coordinates. \nMagnitudes such as the temperature of a body or the field strength of\nan electric field, which have at each spacetime point a definite \nvalue, appear as functions of four variables, the spacetime \ncoordinates \\(x, y, z, t\\).\n\n\n\nIn systematic theorizing we construct a formal scaffold that\nconsists of mere symbols, according to Weyl (1948, 311), without \nexplaining initially what the symbols for mass, charge, field \nstrength, etc., mean; and only toward the end do we describe how the \nsymbolic structure connects directly with experience. \n \n\nIt is certain, that on the symbolic side, not space and time but four\nindependent variables \\(x, y, z, t\\) appear; \none speaks of space, as one does of sounds and colours, only on the \nside of conscious experience. A monochromatic light signal \u2026 has \nnow become a mathematical formula in which a certain symbol \\(F\\),\ncalled electromagnetic field strength, is expressed as a pure \narithmetically constructed function of four other symbols \n\\(x, y, z, t\\), called spacetime coordinates.\n\n\n\nAt another place Weyl (1949a, 113) says: \n \n\nIntuitive space and intuitive time are thus hardly the adequate \nmedium in which physics is to construct the external world. No less \nthan the sense qualities must the intuitions of space and time be \nrelinquished as its building material; they must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional continuum in the abstract arithmetical sense.\n\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s point is that while space and time exist within the realm of \nconscious experience, or, according to Kant, as \\(a\\) priori\nforms underlying all of our conscious experiences, they are \nunsuited as elements with which to construct the objective world and \nmust be replaced by means of a purely arithmetical symbolic \nrepresentation. All that we are left with, according to Weyl, is \nsymbolic construction. If this still needed any confirmation, Weyl \n(1948, 313) says, it was provided by the theory of relativity and \nquantum \n theory.[108]\n For ease of reference we repeat a citation of Weyl (1988, 4\u20135) \nin \u00a74.3.1: \n \n\nCoordinates are introduced on the Mf [manifold] in the most direct \nway through the mapping onto the number space, in such a way, that \nall coordinates, which arise through one-to-one continuous \ntransformations, are equally possible. With this the coordinate \nconcept breaks loose from all special constructions to which\nit was bound earlier in geometry. In the language of relativity this \nmeans: The coordinates are not measured, their \nvalues are not read off from real measuring rods which react\nin a definite way to physical fields and the metrical structure, \nrather they are a priori placed in the world arbitrarily, in\norder to characterize those physical fields including the metric\nstructure numerically. The metric structure becomes through \nthis, so to speak, freed from space; it becomes an existing field \nwithin the remaining structure-less space. Through this, space as \nform of appearance contrasts more clearly with its real content: The \ncontent is measured after the form is arbitrarily related to \n coordinates.[109]\n\n\n\n\nThe last two sentences in the above quote suggest that, (a) Weyl \nembraces something close to Kant\u2019s position, according to which space\nand time are \u201ca priori forms of appearances\u201d, or\nthat (b) Weyl adheres to a position called spacetime \nsubstantivalism, according to which, in addition to body and \nfields and their relations, there also exists a \n\u2018container\u2019, the spacetime manifold, and this manifold, \nits points and the manifold differential-topological relations are \nphysically real. However, this interpretation would contradict Weyl\u2019s\nbasic thesis that in the symbolic construction of the objective word \nwe are left with nothing but symbolic arithmetic functional \nrelations. Weyl\u2019s phrases, do not denote either a physically real \ncontainer or something like Kant\u2019s a priori form of \nintuition. They merely denote a conceptual or formal \nscaffolding, a logical space, as it were, whose points \nare represented by purely formal coordinates \\((n\\)-tuple\nof pure numbers). It is such a formal space which is employed by the \ntheorist in the initial stages of constructing an objective world. To\nemphasize, in modelling the objective world the theorist begins by \nconstructing a formal scaffold which consists of mere \nsymbols and formal coordinates, without explaining initially what the\nsymbols for mass, charge, field strength, etc., mean; only toward the\nend does the theorist describe how the symbolic structure connects \ndirectly with experience ((Weyl, 1948, 311)). \n\n\nThe four-dimensional space-time continuum must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional coordinate space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). However, the \nsheer arbitrariness with which we assign coordinates does not affect \nthe objective relations and features of the world itself. To the \ncontrary, it is only relative to a symbolic construction or \nmodelling by means of an assignment of coordinates that the state of \nthe world, its relations and properties, can be objectively \ndetermined by means of distinct, reproducible symbols. While our \nimmediate experiences are subjective and absolute, \nour symbolic construction of the objective world is of \nnecessity relative. Weyl (1949a, 116) says: \n \n\nWhoever desires the absolute must take the subjectivity and \negocentricity into the bargain; whoever feels drawn toward the \nobjective faces the problem of relativity.\n\n\n\nWeyl (1949a, 75) notes, \u201cThe objectification, by elimination of\nthe ego and its immediate life of intuition, does not fully succeed, \nand the coordinate system remains as the necessary residue of the \nego-extinction.\u201d However, this residue of ego involvement is \nsubsequently rendered harmless through the principle of \ninvariance. The transition from one admissible coordinate \nsystem to another can be mathematically described, and the natural \nlaws and measurable quantities must be \ninvariant under such transformations. This, Weyl (1948, 336)\nsays, constitutes the general principle of \nrelativity. Weyl (1949a, 104) says: \n \n\n\u2026 Only such relations will have objective meaning as are \nindependent of the mapping chosen and therefore remain invariant \nunder deformations of the map. Such a relation is, for instance, the \nintersection of two world lines. If we wish to characterize a special\nmapping or a special class of mappings, we must do so in terms of the\nreal physical events and of the structure revealed in them. That is \nthe content of the postulate of general relativity. \nAccording to the special theory of relativity, it \nis possible in particular to construct a map of the world such that \n(1) the world line of each mass point which is subject to no external\nforces appears as a straight line, and (2) the light cone issuing \nfrom an arbitrary world point is represented by a circular cone with \nvertical axis and a vertex angle of 90\u00b0. In this \ntheory the inertial and causal structure and hence also the metrical \nstructure of the world have the character of rigidity, they are \nabsolutely fixed once and for all. It is impossible objectively, \nwithout resorting to individual exhibition, to make a narrower \nselection from among the \u2018normal mappings\u2019 satisfying the\nabove conditions (1) and (2).\n\n\n\nWeyl (1949a, 115) provides an illustration, which shows how a \nmeasurement by observer \\(B\\) of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) \nbetween two stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) can be \nconstructed in the four-dimensional number space, and can be \nexpressed as an \n invariant.[110]\n\n\n\nFigure 15:\nMeasurement of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) by an observer \\(B\\)\nbetween two stars\n\n\n\nIn figure 15 the stars and observer are represented by their world \nlines, and the past light cone \\(K\\) issuing from the observation \nevent \\(O\\) intersects the world lines of the stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \n\\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) in \\(E\\) and \n\\(E^{*}\\) respectively. The light rays emitted at \n\\(E\\) and \\(E^{*}\\), which arrive at the \nobservation event \\(O\\), are null geodesics laying on the past \nlight cone and are respectively denoted by \\(\\Lambda\\) and \n\\(\\Lambda^{*}\\). This construction of the numerical \nquantity of the angle \\(\\delta\\) observed by \\(B\\) at \\(O\\), which\nis describable in the form of purely arithmetical relations, is \ninvariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations and constitutes \nan objective fact of the \n world.[111]\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the angles between two stars determine the \nobjectively indescribable subjective experience of \nthe observer. Moreover, Weyl says, \u201cthere is no difference in \nour experiences to which there does not correspond a difference in \nthe underlying objective situation.\u201d And that difference is \nitself invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. In other\nwords, an observer\u2019s subjective experiences supervene on the\ninvariant relationships and structures of a symbolically constructed \nobjective world. \n\n\nPerhaps no statement captures the contrast between the \nobjective-symbolic and the subjective-intuitive more vividly then \nWeyl\u2019s famous statement \n \n\nThe objective world simply \\(is\\), it does not happen. \nOnly to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life \nline of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a \nfleeting image in space which continuously changes in \n time.[112]\n\n",
