    "main_text": "Religion and Social Instability\n10. Religion and Social Instability\n\nThe last crucial aspect of Hobbes\u2019s political philosophy is his\ntreatment of religion. Hobbes progressively expands his discussion of\nChristian religion in each revision of his political philosophy, until\nit comes in Leviathan to comprise roughly half the book.\nThere is no settled consensus on how Hobbes understands the\nsignificance of religion within his political theory. Some\ncommentators have argued that Hobbes is trying to demonstrate to his\nreaders the compatibility of his political theory with core Christian\ncommitments, since it may seem that Christians\u2019 religious duties\nforbid their affording the sort of absolute obedience to their\ngovernors which Hobbes\u2019s theory requires of them. Others have\ndoubted the sincerity of his professed Christianity, arguing that by\nthe use of irony or other subtle rhetorical devices, Hobbes sought to\nundermine his readers\u2019 religious beliefs. Howsoever his\nintentions are properly understood, Hobbes\u2019s obvious concern\nwith the power of religious belief is a fact that interpreters of his\npolitical philosophy must seek to explain.\n",
