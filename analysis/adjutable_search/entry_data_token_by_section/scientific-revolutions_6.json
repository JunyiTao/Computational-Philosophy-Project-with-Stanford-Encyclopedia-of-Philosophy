    "main_text": "Kuhn\u2019s Early Account of Scientific Revolutions || Revolution as Incommensurable Paradigm Change\n3.2 Revolution as Incommensurable Paradigm Change\n\nThe new paradigm overturns the old by displacing it as no longer a\ncompetent guide to future research. In the famous (or\nnotorious)chapter X of Structure, Kuhn claims that the change\nis typically so radical that the two paradigms cannot be compared\nagainst the same goals and methodological standards and values.\nMoreover, the accompanying meaning shift of key terms, such as\n\u2018simultaneous\u2019, \u2018mass\u2019, and\n\u2018force\u2019 in physics, leads to communication breakdown. In\neffect, scientists on different sides of a paradigm debate \u201clive\nin different worlds.\u201d Kuhn speaks of scientists experiencing a\nkind of gestalt switch or religious conversion experience. The heated\nrhetoric of debate and the resulting social reorganization, he says,\nresemble those of a political revolution. \u201cLike the choice\nbetween political institutions, that between competing paradigms\nproves to be a choice between incompatible modes of community\nlife\u201d (1970, 94). The comparison of scientific with political\nrevolutions should not surprise, given the entangled history of the\nterm \u2018revolution\u2019, but claiming such close similarity\nenraged philosophical and cultural critics of Kuhn.\n\nThe typical paradigm change does not involve a large infusion of new\nempirical results, Kuhn tells us (chs. IX and X). Rather, it is a\nconceptual reorganization of otherwise familiar materials, as in the\nrelativity revolution. A paradigm change typically changes goals,\nstandards, linguistic meaning, key scientific practices, the way both\nthe technical content and the relevant specialist community are\norganized, and the way scientists perceive the world. (For the often\nneglected practices dimension in Kuhn\u2019s account, see Rouse,\n2003.) Nor can we retain the old, linear, cumulative conception of\nscientific progress characteristic of Enlightenment thinking; for,\nKuhn insists, attempts to to show that the new paradigm contains the\nold, either logically or in some limit or under some approximation,\nwill be guilty of a fallacy of equivocation. The meaning change\nreflects the radical change in the assumed ontology of the world. A\nsecond Kuhnian objection to cumulative progress is what has come to be\ncalled \u201cKuhn loss\u201d (see Post 1971, 229, n. 38). Rarely\ndoes the new paradigm solve all of the problems that its predecessor\napparently solved. So even in this sense the new paradigm fails\ncompletely to enclose the old. The consequence, according to Kuhn, is\nthat attempts to defend continuous, cumulative scientific progress by\nmeans of theory reduction or even a correspondence relationship (e.g.,\na limiting relationship) between a theory and its predecessor must\nfail. Revolutions produce discontinuities.\n\nGiven all these changes, Kuhn claimed that the two competing paradigms\nare \u201cincommensurable\u201d, a technical term that he repeatedly\nattempted to clarify. Traditional appeals to empirical results and\nlogical argument are insufficient to resolve the debate. For details\nof the incommensurability debate, see the entry \u201cThe\nIncommensurability of Scientific Theories.\u201d as well as\nHoyningen-Huene and Sankey (2001) as a sample of the large literature\non incommensurability.\n\nNaturally, many thinkers of a logical empiricist or Popperian bent, or\nsimply of an Enlightenment persuasion, were shocked by these claims\nand responded with a barrage of criticism\u2014as if Kuhn had\ncommitted a kind of sacrilege by defiling the only human institution\nthat could be trusted to provide the objective truth about the world.\nToday there is fairly wide agreement that some of Kuhn\u2019s claims\nno longer look so radical. Meanwhile, Kuhn himself was equally shocked\nby the vehemence of the attacks and (to his mind) the willful\ndistortion of his views (see, e.g., Lakatos and Musgrave 1970). In\nlater papers and talks, he both clarified his views and softened some\nof his more radical claims. Critics reacted to the radical views of\nPaul Feyerabend (1962, 1975) in a somewhat similar manner. (For\ndetails, see the entry \u201cFeyerabend, Paul.\u201d)\n\nGiven that cyclic theories of history have, for the most part, long\ngiven way to linear, progressive accounts, readers may be surprised at\nKuhn critic, physicist Stephen Weinberg\u2019s comment that\nKuhn\u2019s overall model is still, in a sense, cyclic (Weinberg\n2001). In fact, Kuhn himself had already recognized this. After the\nfounding paradigm in Kuhn\u2019s account in Structure, we\nhave normal science under a paradigm, then crisis, then revolution,\nthen a new paradigm\u2014a development that brings back a new period\nof normal science. At this abstract level of description, the model is\nindeed cyclic, but of course the new paradigm heads the science in\nquestion in a new direction rather than returning it to a previous\nstate. Other commentators, including Marxists, have regarded\nKuhn\u2019s mechanism as dialectical, as illustrated by the\nsuccession of self-undermining developments in the theory of light,\nfrom a Newtonian particle theory to a wave theory to a new kind of\nwave-particle duality. (For the dialectical interpretation see\nespecially Krajewski 1977 and Nowak 1980 on the idealizational\napproach to science, as originated by Karl Marx.)\n\nSomewhat ironically, Kuhn\u2019s attempt to revolutionize the\nepistemology of science has had a wider socio-cultural impact than\nmany scientific revolutions themselves. While some of Kuhn\u2019s\ndoctrines step into the postmodern era, he still had a foot in the\nEnlightenment, which helps to explain his dismay at the critical\nreaction to his work and to radical developments in the new-wave\nsociology of science of the 1970s and \u201880s. For, unlike many\npostmodernists (some of whom make use of his work), Kuhn retained a\nscientific exceptionalism. He did not doubt that the sciences have\nbeen uniquely successful since the Scientific Revolution. For him,\nunlike for many of his critics, revolutions in his radical sense were\ngreat epistemological leaps forward rather than deep scientific\nfailures. On the science policy front, he intended his work to help\npreserve the integrity of this socially valuable enterprise. It is on\nscience policy issues that Steve Fuller is most critical of Kuhn\n(Fuller 2000).\n\nThe general problem presented by Kuhn\u2019s critique of traditional\nphilosophy of science is that, although the various sciences have been\nsuccessful, we do not understand how they have accomplished\nthis or even how to characterize this success. Enlightenment-style\nexplanations have failed. For example, Kuhn and Feyerabend (1975),\npreceded by Popper, were among the first philosophers to expose the\nbankruptcy of the claim that it was the discovery of a special\nscientific method that explains that success, a view that is still\nwidely taught in secondary schools today. And that conclusion (one\nthat cheered those postmodernists who regard scientific progress as an\nillusion) left Kuhn and the science studies profession with the\nproblem of how science really does work. To explain how and why it had\nbeen so successful became an urgent problem for him\u2014again, a\nproblem largely rejected as bogus by many science studies scholars\nother than philosophers. \n\nAnother of Kuhn\u2019s declared tasks in Structure was to\nsolve the problem of social order for mature science, that is, how\ncohesive modern science (especially normal science) is possible\n(Barnes 1982, 2003). Yet another was to bring scientific discovery\nback into philosophical discussion by endogenizing it in his model,\nwhile denying the existence of a logic of discovery. Whereas\nthe logical empiricists and Popper had excluded discovery issues from\nphilosophy of science in favor of theory of confirmation or\ncorroboration, Kuhn was critical of confirmation theory and supportive\nof historical and philosophical work on discovery. He argued that\ndiscoveries are temporally and cognitively structured and that they\nare an essential component of an epistemology of science. In Kuhnian\nnormal science the problems are so well structured and the solutions\nso nearly guaranteed in terms of the resources of the paradigm that\nthe problems reduce to puzzles (Nickles 2003b). Kuhn kept things under\ncontrol there by denying that normal scientists seek essential\ninnovation, for, as indicated above, major, unexpected discoveries\nthreaten the extant paradigm and hence threaten crisis and revolution.\nSo, even in normal science, Kuhn had to admit that major discoveries\nare unexpected challenges to the reigning paradigm. They are\nanomalous, even exogenous in the sense that they come as shocks from\noutside the normal system.\n\nBut this is the working scientists\u2019 point of view. As noted,\nnormal science is bound to turn up difficulties that resist\nresolution, at least some of which are sooner or later recognized by\nthe community. In Kuhn\u2019s own view, as a historian and\nphilosopher standing high above the fray, it is deliberate, systematic\nnormal research that will most readily sow the seeds of revolution and\nhence of rapid scientific progress. According to the old\nmusicians\u2019 joke, the fastest way to Carnegie Hall is slow\npractice. For Kuhn the fastest way to revolutionary innovation is\nintensely detailed normal science.\n\nWhen it comes to revolution on Kuhn\u2019s account, the social order\nbreaks down dramatically. And here his strategy of taming creative\nnormal research so as to make room for articulated discovery (the\nreduction of research problems to puzzles) also breaks down. Kuhn had\nto acknowledge that he had no idea how the scientists in extraordinary\nresearch contexts manage to come up with brilliant new ideas and\ntechniques. This failure exacerbated his problem of explaining what\nsort of continuity underlies the revolutionary break that enables us\nto identify the event as a revolution within an ongoing field of\ninquiry. As he later wrote:\n\nEven those who have followed me this far will want to know how a\nvalue-based enterprise of the sort I have described can develop as a\nscience does, repeatedly producing powerful new techniques for\nprediction and control. To that question, unfortunately, I have no\nanswer at all\u2026. [1977b, 332]\n\n",
