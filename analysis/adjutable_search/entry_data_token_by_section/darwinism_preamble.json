    "main_text": "\n\n\nDarwinism designates a distinctive form of evolutionary explanation\nfor the history and diversity of life on earth. Its original\nformulation is provided in the first edition of On the Origin of\nSpecies in 1859.  This entry first formulates \u2018Darwin\u2019s\nDarwinism\u2019 in terms of five philosophically distinctive themes:\n(i) probability and chance, (ii) the nature, power and scope of\nselection, (iii) adaptation and teleology, (iv) nominalism\nvs. essentialism about species and (v) the tempo and mode of\nevolutionary change.  Both Darwin and his critics recognized that his\napproach to evolution was distinctive on each of these topics, and it\nremains true that, though Darwinism has developed in many ways\nunforeseen by Darwin, its proponents and critics continue to\ndifferentiate it from other approaches in evolutionary biology by\nfocusing on these themes.  This point is illustrated in the second\nhalf of the entry by looking at current debates in the philosophy of\nevolutionary biology on these five themes. \n",
