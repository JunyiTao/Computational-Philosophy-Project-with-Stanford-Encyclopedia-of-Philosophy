    "main_text": "Causality in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee || The 17th Discussion of the Incoherence\n7.2 The 17th Discussion of the Incoherence\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee offers a brief yet very comprehensive\nexamination of causality within the 17th discussion of his\nIncoherence of the Philosophers. The 17th discussion is not\ntriggered by any opposition to causality. Rather it aims at forcing\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s adversaries, the\nfal\u00e2sifa, to acknowledge that all prophetical miracles\nthat are reported in the Qur\u2019an are possible. If their\npossibility is acknowledged, a Muslim philosopher who accepts the\nauthority of revelation must also admit that the prophets performed\nthese miracles and that the narrative in revelation is truthful.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee divides the 17th discussion into four different\nsections. He presents three different \u201cpositions\u201d (singl.\nmaq\u00e2m) of his (various) opponents and addresses them\none by one. His response to the \u201csecond position\u201d, which\nis that of Avicenna, is further divided into two different\n\u201capproaches\u201d (singl. maslak). This four-fold\ndivision of the 17th discussion is crucial for its understanding.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee addresses different concepts about causality\nwithin the different discussions and develops not one, but at least\ntwo coherent responses.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the four parts in the 17th discussion the\nreader must be referred to chapter 6 in Griffel 2009 (147\u201373).\nThe following pages give only an outline of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s overall argument. In the opening\nsentence of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee introduces the\nposition he wishes to refute and he lines out elements that\nalternative explanations of causality must include in order to be\nacceptable for al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. This opening statement is a\nmasterwork of philosophical literature:\n\nThe connection (iqtir\u00e2n) between what is habitually\nbelieved to be a cause and what is habitually believed to be an effect\nis not necessary (dar\u00fbr\u00ee), according to us. But\n[with] any two things [that are not identical and that do not imply\none another] (\u2026) it is not necessary that the existence or the\nnonexistence of one follows necessarily (min dar\u00fbra)\nfrom the existence or the nonexistence of the other (\u2026). Their\nconnection is due to the prior decision (taqd\u00eer) of\nGod, who creates them side by side (\u2018al\u00e2\nal-tas\u00e2wuq), not to its being necessary by itself,\nincapable of separation. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 166)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee lays out four conditions that any explanation\nof physical processes that is acceptable to him must fulfill: (1) the\nconnection between a cause and its effect is not necessary, (2) the\neffect can come to exist without this particular cause (\u201cthey\nare not incapable of separation\u201d), (3) God creates two events\nconcomitant, side by side, and (4) God\u2019s creation follows a\nprior decision (taqd\u00eer). On first sight, it seems that\nonly an occasionalist explanation of physical processes would fulfill\nthese four conditions, and this is how this statement has mostly been\nunderstood. Rudolph (in Perler/Rudolph 2000, 75\u201377), however,\npointed out that not only occasionalism but other types of\nexplanations also fulfill these four criteria. Most misleading is the\nthird requirement that God would need to create events \u201cside by\nside.\u201d These words seem to point exclusively to an occasionalist\nunderstanding of creation. One should keep in mind, however, that this\nformula leaves open, how God creates events. Even an\nAvicennan philosopher holds that God creates the cause concomitant to\nits effect, and does so by means of secondary causality. While the\n17th discussion of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Incoherence\npoints towards occasionalism as a possible solution, it also points to\nothers. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee chooses a certain linguistic\nassociation to occasionalism, which has led many interpreters of this\ndiscussion to believe that here, he argues exclusively in favor of\nit.\n\nIt is important to understand that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee does not\ndeny the existence of a connection between a cause and its effect;\nrather he denies the necessary character of this connection. In the\nFirst Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee brings\nthe argument that observation cannot prove causal connections.\nObservation can only conclude that the cause and its effect occur\nconcomitantly:\n\nObservation (mush\u00e2hada) points towards a concomitant\noccurrence (al-hus\u00fbl \u2018indahu) but not to a\ncombined occurrence (al-hus\u00fbl bihi) and that there is\nno other cause (\u2018illa) for it. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n2000a, 167.)\n\n\nIt would be wrong, however, to conclude from this argument that\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee denied the existence of causal connections.\nWhile such connections cannot be proven through observation (or\nthrough any other means), they may or may not exist. In the First\nPosition al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejects the view that the connection\nbetween an efficient cause and its effect is simply necessary per\nse, meaning that the proximate cause alone is fully responsible\nfor the effect and that nothing else is also necessary for the effect\nto occur. In another work this position is described as one held by\n\u201cmaterialists\u201d (dahriyy\u00fbn) who deny that\nthe world has a cause or a maker (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 19 =\n2000b, 61). The Mu\u2019tazilite view of tawallud, meaning\nthat humans are the sole creators of their own actions and their\nimmediate effects, also falls under this position\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000, 226.13\u201314). Like in the connection\nbetween a father and his son, where the father is not the\nonly efficient cause for the son\u2019s existence, so there\nmay be in every causal connection efficient causes involved other than\nthe most obvious or the most proximate one. The proximate efficient\ncause may be just the last element in a long chain of efficient causes\nthat extends via the heavenly realm. The intellects of the celestial\nspheres, which were thought to be referred to in revelation as\n\u201cangels,\u201d may be middle elements or intermediaries in\ncausal chains that all have its beginning in God.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejects the position of the materialists and\nthe Mu\u2019tazilites because it does not take account of the fact\nthat God is the ultimate efficient cause of the observed effect. God\nmay create this effect directly or by way of secondary causality.\nDiscussing the example that when fire touches a ball of cotton it\ncauses it to combust, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes about the First\nPosition that the fire alone causes combustion:\n\nThis [position] is one of those that we deny. Rather we say that the\nefficient cause (f\u00e2\u2019il) of the combustion through\nthe creation of blackness in the cotton and through causing the\nseparation of its parts and turning it into coal or ashes is\nGod\u2014either through the mediation of the angels or without\nmediation. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 167.)\n\n\nSecondary causality is a viable option for al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee that\nhe is willing to accept. Still he does not accept the teachings of\nAvicenna, which are discussed in the Second Position. Avicenna\ncombines secondary causality with the view that causal processes\nproceed with necessity and in accord with the natures of things, and\nnot by way of deliberation and choice on the side of the efficient\ncause. The ultimate efficient cause in a cosmology of secondary\ncausality is, of course, God. The Avicennan opponent of the Second\nPosition teaches secondary causality plus he holds that the\ncausal connections follow with necessity from the nature of the First\nBeing. They are not created through God\u2019s deliberation and\nchoice but are a necessary effect of God\u2019s essence.\n",
