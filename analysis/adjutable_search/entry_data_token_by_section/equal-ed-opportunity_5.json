    "main_text": "The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity || What is Educational Opportunity?\n3.1 What is Educational Opportunity?\n\nBefore we can say what an equal educational opportunity is, we need to\nsay what an opportunity is in general. Peter Westen (1985) provides a\nhelpful definition of an opportunity that can be applied to the\neducation sphere. For Westen, an opportunity is a relationship between\nan agent or a set of agents, and a desired goal, mediated by certain\nobstacles, none of which are insurmountable. For instance, Alice has\nan opportunity to become educated mediated by obstacles such as\nenrolling at a school, putting in hard work, and the quality of her\nteachers.\n\nTo employ this concept in the context of education, we need to answer\nquestions about who the proper agents are, what the appropriate goal\nor goals are, and what, if any, obstacles are legitimate. For example,\nif we take admission at a highly selective college as our goal, and\nthe citizens of some country as our agents, we might think that\nmeeting a certain academic requirement, such as passing an entrance\nexam, is a relevant obstacle that should be permitted to stand in the\nway of the goal. In this context, we will also think that an\napplicant\u2019s race, sex or religious affiliation should not be\nobstacles. When the appropriate group faces only the relevant\nobstacles with respect to the appropriate goal we can say that\nequality of opportunity obtains between the members of that group.\n\nFor instance, Alice and Belle have equal opportunity to attend a\nselective university if, all other things being equal, the only\nobstacle they face is passing an entry test, which is a relevant\nobstacle. They do not have equal opportunity if Alice also faces an\nirrelevant obstacle, such as race-based discrimination, that Belle\ndoes not face.\n\nEducational opportunities are those opportunities that aim to enable\nindividuals to acquire knowledge and certain skills, and to cultivate\ncertain capacities. As noted above, we may value educational\nopportunity in some instances for the intrinsic value of acquiring\nknowledge, while in other cases we may care more about its\ninstrumental effects on individual welfare (e.g., labor market\nsuccess). Whatever our rationale for caring about educational\nopportunity, in order for an individual to be said to have this\nopportunity, she must have no insurmountable, irrelevant obstacles to\nthe particular educational goal we have in mind.\n\nMost commonly we associate the goals that constitute educational\nopportunities with access to educational institutions such as schools\nand universities, but apprenticeships and professional development and\ntraining also provide educational opportunities. In addition, there\nare many informal types of educational opportunity. These include\npublic debates and lectures as well as time spent reading, practicing,\nor thinking outside of a school context.\n\nMost contributors to debates about equality of educational opportunity\nfocus on opportunities that are made available through public\nK\u201312 and higher education institutions. The reasons for this are\nsimilar to our reasons for being concerned with educational\nopportunity in the first place. Those institutional opportunities are\nmore easily regulated and under the state\u2019s control, they\neducate the vast majority of children in the developed world, and they\nhave a profound effect on the quality of our lives. As a result, most\nof the literature primarily concerns K\u201312 educational\ninstitutions and colleges. Nevertheless, a crucial question concerns\nthe extent to which the state should try to address inequalities in\neducational opportunities that are generated through the family. For\nexample, we know that parents who read to their children give their\nchildren an educational advantage (Hutton et al. 2015). Should the\nstate seek to correct for the disadvantages of those children whose\nparents could not (or would not) read to them? More generally, parents\npass on not only genetic traits to their children, but also\ncharacteristics that differentially prepare children for success at\nschool, and even at jobs. Again, how should the state respond to these\nand other factors that influence children\u2019s likelihood of\nsuccess at school? Are these appropriate obstacles for children to\nface or not?\n\nThe next sections survey different interpretations of equal\neducational opportunity in view of these questions.\n",
