Justice and Public Health\n\nMany familiar debates between utilitarian and various egalitarian\napproaches to distributional questions play themselves out in public\nhealth. Public health professionals and policymakers are typically\ncommitted to bringing about as much health as possible with the\nresources available. This interpretation of the remit and\nresponsibility of public health is understandable, and in many\nrespects, laudable. There is no context in public health in which\nresources are unlimited, or even sufficient to bring about all the\nhealth that might be secured. Efficiency in the use of constrained\nresources, especially public resources, is clearly morally important,\nif not imperative. And from the perspective of some utilitarian\naccounts, maximizing the amount of net good, in this case, health,\nthat can be secured is also the only just way to deploy resources.\n(See, for instance, the entry on\n justice.)\n\nPublic health professionals and policymakers are well aware, however,\nof concerns that the health maximizing approach to public health can\noften perpetuate and even exacerbate existing injustices in health and\nhuman well-being. At least since the 1990s, ethics scholars have\nchallenged public health to look beyond efficiency to address other,\ngenerally egalitarian concerns of justice. Activists concerned about\nracial, gender and other social group injustices also frequently call\non public health institutions to pursue health equity, particularly by\nreducing what are viewed as unjust health disparities.\n\nTensions between efficiency and egalitarian commitments arise in two\nstage-setting public health functions: the establishing of goals and\npriorities, for example, when the US Department of Health and Human\nServices sets goals and objectives to improve the health and\nwell-being of people in the United States in its Healthy People\nInitiative, and the allocating of resources that have been budgeted to\nsecure the goals that have been identified, for example, how to\ndistribute the funds that are allocated to the goal of reducing\ncardiovascular deaths. As important as setting goals and allocating\nresources are, there are other questions in public health ethics that\nalso engage considerations of justice but that are not centrally\nstructured around tensions between efficiency and equity. These\ninclude the moral value of prevention, the moral responsibility of\nindividuals for their health, and stigma in public health programming.\nPublic health also affects other things that matter morally to people,\nlike respectful treatment, personal security or personal relations.\nDepending on how one understands what social or structural justice\nentails, these other considerations may be matters of justice, or even\nin some cases of state legitimacy, but they are not typical of matters\ntaken up in either literatures.\n\nSection 2.1 begins with a review of different reasons that have been\nput forward for why health matters morally, and thus why health is or\nmight be a matter of justice. Section 2.2 discusses general problems\nof aggregation, goal setting and resource allocation. Sections 2.3\ntakes on distinctive moral issues that arise due to public\nhealth\u2019s emphasis on prevention, and sections 2.4 and 2.5 take\non individual responsibility and stigma, respectively, as well as some\nother examples where public health\u2019s engagement with justice\ngoes to impacts that are not primarily health. (For instance, stigma\ncan be conceptualized as a concern about social disrespect). Section\n2.6 concludes with a brief review of global justice considerations.\n\n",
