    "main_text": "Language Evolution || Phylogenetic emergence\n5.2 Historical evolution\n\nWe mentioned earlier that both early 20th-century linguistics\nmonographs and contemporary introductory textbooks include discussions\nof historical linguistics, i.e., that branch that studies the history\nand prehistory of changes in particular languages, how they are\nrelated to each other, and how and why they change. Again, this topic\nis distinct from the emergence of language in hominoid species and\nconcerns mostly the linguistic changes that have occurred over a much\nshorter period within languages.\n\nThe last decade has seen two kinds of innovations related to studying\nchanges in particular languages. One, which we will call\n\u2018linguistic phylogeny\u2019, concerns the application of\nstochastic phylogenetic methods to investigate prehistoric population\nand language dispersion (Gray and Jordan 2000, Gray 2005, Atkinson and\nGray 2006, Gray et al. 2009). These methods answer questions about how\nmembers of a family of languages are related to each other and\ndispersed throughout a geographic area. The second, which we will call\nthe effects of transmission, examines how interpreted artificial\nlanguages (sets of signifier/signified pairs) change under a range of\ntransmission conditions (Kirby et al. 2008, Kirby 2001, Hurford 2000),\nthus providing evidence about how the process of transmission affects\nthe characteristics, especially the structure, of the transmitted\ninterpreted system.\n5.2.1 Linguistic phylogeny\n\nRussell Gray and his colleagues have taken powerful phylogenetic\nmethods that were developed by biologists to investigate molecular\nevolution, and applied them to linguistic data in order to answer\nquestions about the evolution of language families. For example, Gray\nand Jordan (2000) used a parsimony analysis of a large language data\nset to adjudicate between competing hypotheses about the speed of the\nspread of Austronesian languages through the Pacific. More recently,\nGreenhill et al. (2010) used a NeighbourNet analysis to evaluate the\nrelative rates of change in the typological and lexical features of\nAustronesian and Indo-European. These results bear on hypotheses about\nthe relative stability of language types over lexical features of\nthose languages, and how far back in time that stability extends. If\nthere were highly conserved typological and lexical features, then it\nmight be possible to identify relationships between languages that\ndate beyond the 8000 (plus or minus 2000) year limit that is imposed\nby lexical instability.\n5.2.2 Effects of transmission\n\nThe computational and laboratory experiments of Kirby and his\ncollaborators have shown that under certain conditions of iterated\nlearning, any given set of signifier/signified pairs in which the\nmapping is initially arbitrary will change to exhibit a very general\nkind of compositional structure. Iterated learning has been studied in\nboth computational and laboratory experiments by means of diffusion\nchains, i.e., sequences of learners. A primary characteristic of such\nsequences of transmission is that what is transmitted from learner to\nlearner will change in an iterated learning environment, in a way that\ndepends on the conditions of transmission.\n\nThe children\u2019s game called \u2018Telephone\u2019 in the USA\n(\u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019 in the UK), provides an example of\ndiffusion chains under which what is transmitted is not stable. In a\ndiffusion chain learning situation what a chain member has actually\nlearned from an earlier member of the chain is presented as the input\nto the next learner, and what that learner has actually learned\nprovides the input to the following learner. In cases where the\ninitial learning task is very simple: i.e., where what is transmitted\nis both simple, completely transmitted, and the transmission channel\nis not noisy, what is transmitted is stable over iterated\ntransmissions even in cases when the participants are young children\nand chimpanzees (Horner et al. 2006). That is, there is little change\nin what is transmitted over iterated transmissions. However, in cases\nwhere what is transmitted is only partially presented, very complex,\nor the channel is noisy, then there is a decrease in the fidelity of\nwhat is transmitted across iterations just like there is in the\nchildren\u2019s game of Telephone.\n\nWhat Kirby and colleagues show is that when the initial input to a\ndiffusion chain is a reasonably complex set of arbitrary\nsignal/signifier pairs, e.g. one in which 27 complex signals of 6\nletters are randomly assigned to 27 objects varying on dimensions of\ncolor, kind of motion, and shape, what is transmitted becomes more and\nmore compositional over iterated transmission. Here,\n\u2018compositional\u2019 is being used to refer to the high degree\nto which sub-strings of the signals come to be systematically paired\nwith specific phenomenal sub-features of what is signified. The\ntransmission conditions in these experiments were free of noise, and\nfor each iteration of the learning task only half of the possible 27\nsignifier/signified pairs were presented to participants. Under this\nkind of transmission bottleneck a high degree of sign/signified\nstructure emerged.\n\nA plausible interpretation of these results is that the developing\nstructure of the collection of signs is a consequence of the repeated\nforced inference by participants from 14 signs and signifieds in the\ntraining set to the entire set of 27 pairs. A moral could be that\niterated forced prediction of the sign/signified pairs in the entire\nset, on the basis of exposure to only about half of them, induced the\ndevelopment of a systematic, compositional structure over the course\nof transmission. It is reasonable to conjecture that this resulting\nstructure reflects effects of human memory, not a domain-specific\nlanguage module\u2014although further work would be required to rule\nout many other competing hypotheses.\n\nThus Kirby and his colleagues focus on something very different from\nthe prerequisites for language emergence. Linguistic nativists have\nbeen interested in how primates like us could have become capable of\nacquiring systems with the structural properties of natural languages.\nKirby and his colleagues (while not denying that human cognitive\nevolution is of interest) are studying how languages evolve to be\ncapable of being acquired by primates like us.\n5.2.3 Trends in the Philosophy of Language Evolution\n\nLastly, language evolution has amassed a great deal of\ninterdisciplinary work in recent times. This has allowed philosophers\nto directly contribute to this emerging field. The trends in the\nphilosophical work have only loosely followed the Externalist,\nEmergentist and Essentialist divisions we advocate here. Most\nphilosophical work has largely been focused on Emergentist conceptions\nwithin the evolution of linguistic meaning specifically.\n\nBar-On (2013) distinguishes between Gricean and Post-Gricean\napproaches to the evolution of language. The former requires an\nattribution of Gricean speaker meaning to our languageless ancestors\nwhich in turn seems to assume intentional actions govern by\nrationality (\u2018nonnatural meaning\u2019). This task is as\nfraught as explaining the evolution of language itself. She thus\nproposes the latter, specifically a Post-Gricean (Orrigi and Sperber\n2000) approach which takes expressive communication (found widely in\nnon-human animal species) as a basis for the emergence of linguistic\nmeaning between signalers and receivers. She states:\n\n\nExpressive communication, I will argue, exhibits features that\nforeshadow significant aspects of linguistic communication. In its\ndomain, we can identify legitimate natural precursors of meaningful\nlinguistic communication. (For present purposes, by \u2018legitimate\nnatural precursors\u2019, I mean behavioral interactions that at\nleast: a. can be found in the natural world; b. go beyond\nTomasello\u2019s mere \u2018communicative displays\u2019; c. do not\ndepend on crediting the relevant creatures with language-like\npropositional thought or post-Gricean communicative intentions, and;\nd. exhibit features that foreshadow important semantic and pragmatic\nfeatures of linguistic communication so in that sense are\nproto-semantic and proto-pragmatic.) (2013: 354)\n\n\nRecent work in Evolutionary Game Theory has also lent credence to the\nemergence of signaling systems involving non-intentional states.\nTaking Lewis (1969) as a spring-board, Skyrms (2010) investigates the\nstructure of signaling behavior beyond the existence of mutual\nconventions. His framework starts from the most basic non-trivial\ncases and gradually introduces complexity (such as deception and the\nintroduction of new signals etc.). Skyrms\u2019 account views\npropositional or semantic content as a special case of informational\ncontent thereby reintroducing information theory as a tool to\nphilosophers of language and linguistics interested in the emergence\nof linguistic communication and/or semantic meaning.\n",
