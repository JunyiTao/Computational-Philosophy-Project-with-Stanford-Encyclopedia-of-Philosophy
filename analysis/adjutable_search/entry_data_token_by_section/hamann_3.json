    "main_text": "Relation\n4. Relation\n\nA second feature of Hamann\u2019s approach is a tendency which Goethe\nsaw as holism. This is perhaps not the best way to describe\nHamann\u2019s insight, as Hamann characteristically emphasised the\nbrokenness of human experience, and fragmentariness of human\nknowledge: \u201cGaps and lacks \u2026 is the highest and deepest\nknowledge of human nature, through which we must climb our way up to\nthe ideal \u2014 ideas and doubts \u2014 the summum bonum\nof our reason\u201d (ZH 3, 34:33\u201335). Hamann essentially\ndisliked attempts to isolate the phenomenon under consideration from\nother aspects with which he felt it to be intimately connected; this\nprecludes a deep and true understanding of our existence. Taken as far\nas he did, this means that philosophy of language must include a\ndiscussion of God, and a discussion of God must make reference to\nsexuality and vice versa.\n\nThus in \u201cEssay of a Sibyl on Marriage\u201d, which he takes as\nan opportunity to write about sex, a proper understanding of human\nsexuality and erotic enjoyment cannot be understood without seeing\nhumanity as the creature of God, made in God\u2019s image. He plays\nwith the Christian idea of God as a Trinity to depict a trinity of\nwoman-man-God in the moment of lovemaking; and reworks the account of\nthe creation of Adam in Genesis to describe the act of coitus itself.\nThe woman on perceiving her lover in his excitement sees \u2018that\nrib\u2019 and cries out in enthusiastic appropriation, \u2018That is\nbone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!\u2019 The man then\n\u2018fills the hole of the place with flesh\u2019 (as Genesis\ndescribes God doing with Adam after the creation of Eve). In doing so\nthe lover also acknowledges that the origin of a man is in\nwoman\u2019s body: the \u2018Sibyl\u2019 describes this moment of\nlovemaking as \u201che entered in whence he once came forth.\u201d\nIndeed, as Christ was born of a woman, the salvation of humanity\nproceeds from a woman\u2019s sexual body; the vagina is also\ndescribed as the place that the Saviour came forth as the body\u2019s\nhealer (the German language permits Hamann here to pun on\n\u2018healer\u2019 and \u2018saviour\u2019). This inclination to\ncombine topics more often kept separate (such as \u2018the concept of\nGod\u2019 and \u2018having sex\u2019) is salient throughout his\nwork.\n",
