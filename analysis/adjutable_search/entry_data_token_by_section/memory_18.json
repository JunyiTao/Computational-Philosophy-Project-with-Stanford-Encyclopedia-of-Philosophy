    "main_text": "Accuracy || Truth and authenticity\n6.1 Truth and authenticity\n\nAdopting Bernecker\u2019s (2010) terminology,\nauthenticity refers to the correspondence between the\nmemory representation and the subject\u2019s\nexperience of the past event, while truth\nrefers to the correspondence between the memory representation and the\npast event itself. Crucially, neither sort of accuracy entails the\nother. A retrieved representation may be authentic, but, if the\nsubject misperceived the relevant event, it may nevertheless not be\ntrue. A retrieved representation may be true, but, if the subject\nmisperceived the relevant event, or if he accurately perceived an\naspect of it other than what is given to him by the retrieved\nrepresentation, it may nevertheless not be authentic.\n\nThus, while preservative forms of content variantism imply that\ngenuine memories are always authentic, such memories are not always\ntrue. Authenticity implies truth only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience itself was accurate with respect to the\nexperienced event. Cases of misperception, again, illustrate the\npossibility of authenticity without truth. Preservationists who wish\nto hold that genuine memories are always true must therefore impose\nthis as an additional requirement, above and beyond what is required\nby the core of their theory. By the same token, while generative forms\nof content variantism allow that genuine memories are sometimes\ninauthentic, such memories are not always false. Inauthenticity\nimplies falsity only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience was both accurate and complete. Cases of boundary\nextension (discussed above) or field-observer perspective switching\n(Debus 2007b; McCarroll 2017; Sutton 2010b) illustrate the possibility of\ninauthenticity without falsity. In cases of perspective switching, the\nsubject perceives an event from one perspective (field perspective)\nbut remembers it from another, perhaps even seeing himself in the\nscene (observer perspective); while many or most observer memories are\ninauthentic (since they fail to correspond to the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience), they are not necessarily false (since they may\ncorrespond to what an observer would have seen). For these reasons,\ngenerationists do not hold that genuine memories are always authentic.\nBut those who wish to hold that genuine memories are always true can\nimpose this as an additional requirement\n",
