    "main_text": "E-Languages versus I-Languages || Chomsky\u2019s notion of an I-language\n3.1 Chomsky\u2019s notion of an I-language\n\nThe \u201cI-\u201d in \u201cI-language\u201d is short, not for\n\u201cidiolectal\u201d, but for a cluster words that connote an\nidiolectal approach and coincidentally begin with the same letter,\nespecially \u201cinternal\u201d and\n \u201cindividualistic\u201d.[3]\n \u201cE-language\u201d is used critically by Chomsky to refer to\nthose things, whatever they are, that are the target of study for\nthose who take languages and their properties to be external to the\nmind. This includes many philosophers of language. Chomsky\u2019s\ncase for introducing and using the notion of an I-language is, in the\nend, indistinguishable from his case for a cognitivist approach to the\nstudy of language as a natural phenomenon. And his case against\nE-languages is that there is no scientifically coherent project to\nwhich they belong as posits.\n3.1.1 The Case For I-languages\n\nOnce one sees beyond the technicalities, Lewis\u2019s notion of\nnatural languages approximates to the ordinary notion of languages as\nthings we use to communicate with others in a linguistic community.\nChomsky\u2019s notion of a language as an object internal to the\nhuman mind or brain can seem odd from this perspective. We can dispel\nthis sense of oddity by appreciating the scientific project from which\nthis usage of \u201ca language\u201d emerges. The fact that a usage\nfails to mesh with ordinary thinking hardly constitutes an objection\nto the usage if the project housing it is a good one. Ordinary\nthinking would struggle to accept mass as one of energy\u2019s\npossible forms, but this gives physicists no cause to pause.\n\nChomsky\u2019s project is to work towards a scientifically credible\nunderstanding of a natural object, the human brain. More feasibly, his\nambition is to make progress on understanding those aspects of the\nbrain that are central to our nature as linguistic beings. A\nreasonable starting hypothesis for such an inquiry is that a\nfunctionally discrete part of the brain, the \u201clanguage\nfaculty\u201d, is responsible for core elements of our capacity to\nuse language. If this hypothesis is right, other parts of the brain,\nand plenty that lies outside the brain in our external social and\nphysical environment, may well combine with this language faculty to\nproduce linguistic behaviour; but the inquiry itself is limited to\nunderstanding the language faculty itself. This voluntary limitation\nhas a rationale. Our overt behaviour is extraordinarily complex, an\nintractable interaction effect, so we need to be appropriately modest\nin our explanatory ambitions. A scientific understanding of the\ninternal workings of the language faculty would in itself be a massive\nachievement. Linguistic behaviour\u2014the sounds language-users\nproduce, their description of certain constructions as ungrammatical,\netc.\u2014can supply defeasible evidence for or against hypotheses we\nmake about the language faculty proper, but we should not treat the\ndescription of overt behaviour as the goal of study. (In an earlier\nincarnation of much the same point, Chomsky distinguished between core\ncompetence and the use of that competence manifest in overt\nperformance, arguing that competence is far more promising an\nobject of linguistic inquiry than the latter. He moved away from this\nterminology after it gave rise to persistent misinterpretations.\nCompetence, for example, has unintended normative\nconnotations\u2014we speak of people as having \u201cpoor competence\nin Spanish\u201d.)\n\nWhile this captures the sense in which Chomsky is taking an\ninternalist (and individualist) approach to the study of language, it\ndoes not yet reveal where the notion of a language, internalized or\notherwise, sits within the approach, or why any appeal to\nlanguages (with \u201clanguage\u201d used as a count noun\nrather than a mass noun) is needed at all. Chomsky\u2019s discussion\nof language acquisition can provide us with a good illustration of\nthis further step. It will also bring out a revealing contrast with\nLewis\u2019s approach (see\n 2.1).[4]\n\nLewis, we saw, thinks a language is an arbitrary pairing of sentences\nand meanings. This arbitrariness is overcome through the co-ordination\nembodied in a conventional practice, an E-language in Chomsky\u2019s\nterminology. Chomsky does not deny the existence of some linguistic\narbitrariness, manifest in linguistic diversity but he holds that this\ndiversity is limited by human psychology (1995a: 15f). On a\n\u201clearning\u201d model of language development, which Chomsky\nrejects, infants are little scientists observing and inferring the\nlinguistic conventions prevailing among adult users (e.g., to be\ntruthful and trusting in some L). But these learners could not\npossibly rule out all but one of the languages that are logically\ncompatible with the data. Even if the child was exceptionally smart,\nthe evidence available in the typical linguistic environment is\ninsufficiently rich\u2014there is a \u201cpoverty of\nstimulus\u201d. If the information in a child\u2019s environment is\ntoo poor to account for developments in her competence, anterior\nknowledge must be providing her with mental stirrups (see Laurence and\nMargolis 2001 and the entry on\n innateness and language).\n\nThis is the context in which introducing talk of I-languages can be\nuseful, according to Chomsky (1986: 22\u20133; 2000: 4\u20135).\nLanguage acquisition can be thought of as a development through states\nof the brain from S0 through intermediate states\ninto a relatively stable mature state, SM.\nS0 is the initial state common to all humans,\nidealizing away from individual linguistic impairments and the like.\nSubsequent states arise through exposure to a particular linguistic\nenvironment. Nothing said so far requires that these states be thought\nof as representational states we could call \u201cknowing a\nlanguage\u201d. But if we describe being-in-state\nSL as knowing a language L, knowledge that\na linguist might in principle make explicit in a theory of L,\nlanguage acquisition can be described\u2014usefully\u2014as a matter\nof children evolving through various stages of knowledge en\nroute to acquiring adult competence. This description is\nuseful because the empiricist/nativist debate can now be couched as a\ndebate over what linguistic information must already be known by\nsomeone in S0 if information supplied by the\nlinguistic environment is to culminate in knowledge of the mature\nlanguage M. Empiricists claim that nothing much is needed, that\nS0 is a \u201cblank slate\u201d to be filled in\nusing environmental data. Nativists claim that plenty of information\nmust already be provided, in the form of innate knowledge of a\nlanguage dubbed Universal Grammar (UG) by Chomsky. We each come\npredisposed to acquire only certain languages, the humanly possible\nones that can grow out of UG.\n\nAn I-language, then, is something that is represented in the language\nfaculty of an (idealized) individual at a particular stage of\ndevelopment. But it is not anything beyond the language faculty.\nStatements about I-languages being represented in the brain are\n\u201cstatements about the structures of the brain formulated at a\ncertain level of abstraction from mechanisms\u201d (1986: 33). In\nother words, to talk of the language faculty as representing some\npiece of information is simply one way among others of giving an\nabstract description of the language faculty, a human\n\u201corgan\u201d (Chomsky 1975: 10; Anderson & Lightfoot 2000).\nAnother way might be to describe it in chemical terms, but the\nrepresentationalist description is\u2014for reasons just\nsketched\u2014rather more helpful than a chemical one within the\ncontext of explaining language acquisition. A grammar for an\nindividual, a linguistic theory in other words, is an abstract\nstatement of this I-language, but what it purports to describe is\ntheir language faculty, not something external to it.\n\nAs theoretical posits, I-languages earn their keep through their role\nin this kind of enquiry. By treating states on the path to normal\nmature linguistic competence in humans as representational states,\nstates of knowledge (where what is represented or known is an\nI-language), important empirical generalizations can be formulated and\nassessed. One would not even have to sit at the nativist end of the\nspectrum in the debate on language acquisition to accept this way of\nframing the question. Moreover, this conception of the brain as a\nrepresentational, information processing system, or as an integrated\nbundle of such systems, has application beyond the specific instance\nof language, developmental or otherwise. Chomsky\u2019s case against\nbehaviorism in the study of language (1959), and his alternative\nvision of how it might be studied, was pivotal in the cognitive\nrevolution across psychology and affiliated disciplines (see e.g.,\nGlass, Holyoak, & Santa 1979; Marr 1982; Pylyshyn 1984; Fodor\n1987).\n3.1.2 The Case Against E-languages\n\nChomsky does not deny that language (in the mass-noun sense) is at\nleast in part \u201ca social product\u201d (1986: 18). He cites\nPutnam\u2019s famous \u201cdivision of linguistic labor\u201d\nhypothesis (Putnam 1975), for example, arguing that, suitably\ndescribed, the phenomenon of semantic deference is compatible with his\ninternalized perspective. The E-languages (\u201cE-\u201d for\n\u201cexternalized\u201d) of which he is skeptical are languages in\nthe count-noun sense. These objects have properties that are\nindependent of the mind/brain, or of the language faculty in\nparticular. He offers a number of examples (1986: 19):\nBloomfield\u2019s view that a language is a totality of utterances\nthat can be made in a speech community; Saussure\u2019s notion of a\nlangue (an arbitrary association of sounds with concepts);\nand Lewis\u2019s pairing of sentences and meanings, the actual\nlanguage of a population when the regularities described earlier hold.\nChomsky also includes any system of actions or behaviours, where this\nsystem is individualist but is the product of a myriad of performance\nsystems interacting with the language faculty and each other. A\ngrammar, on the E-language approach, purports to describe these\nmind-external (or at least language-faculty external) entities.\n\nBecause there is considerable variety here in the underlying\nconceptions of languages, Chomsky\u2019s criticisms can seem\nsweeping, but the underlying thought is that, because E-languages are\nless \u201creal\u201d than I-languages, \u201cthe concept [of an\nE-language] appears to play no role in the theory of language\u201d\n(1986: 26). The argument for this negative conclusion is not so\ndifferent from the positive argument for an I-language perspective\noutlined in\n 3.1.1.\n Linguistic behaviour is the product of both the language faculty on\nthe one hand and external influences\u2014performance systems in the\nmind/brain of the individual and social factors\u2014on the other. At\nissue is not whether anything at all can ever be said, usefully, about\nthese \u201cdownstream\u201d effects, but whether the notion of an\nE-language has any pivotal explanatory role to play in saying it (save\nas a useful shorthand). Nothing much is added to the account of\nlanguage learning in\n 3.1.1,\n for example, by describing it as development towards the learning of\nan externalistically specified social language, as opposed to some\nspecific mature state, SM, of an individual.\n\nOne apparent corollary of this is significant for those many\nphilosophers of language who have agonized over how to construct a\ntheory of meaning for English. A common thought is that such a theory\nought to take the form of a statement of the referential properties of\nthe expressions of English\u2014a link between words and objects in\nthe world\u2014from which the truth conditions of all English\nsentences can be derived (e.g., Davidson 1970, Montague 1970; see the\nentries for\n theories of meaning\n and\n reference).\n Echoing P.F. Strawson (1950), Chomsky suggests that referring is\nsomething people do. They use words in doing so, it is true, but\nreferring is not something that words somehow do by themselves,\nthrough some fantastical medium, English (2000: 40\u20131). If\nreferential properties of expressions amount to anything, rather than\nbeing relational properties between expressions and external objects\n(or \u201cword-world\u201d relations) they should be thought of as\nembodying instructions to the individual\u2019s conceptual system,\none of the performance systems with which the language faculty\ninterfaces (an idea explored in Jackendoff 2002). If Chomsky is right,\na great deal of the philosophy of language is either radically off\nbeam or needs considerable re-interpretation (see Hornstein 1989,\nLudlow 2003, Pietroski 2003, Stainton 2006).\n3.2 First Response to the I-language Perspective: No Representations Without Representeds\n\nCriticisms of Chomsky\u2019s internalism, and so by implication his\nnotion of an I-language, stretch back over half a century, as do his\nresponses. Three collections (George 1989; McGilvray 1999; Antony and\nHornstein 2003) between them contain a full array of philosophical\ncommentary. In this and the next section we focus on concerns that\nhave particular currency.\n\nMany critics have focused on an unacknowledged commitment to\nexternalism that they think is implicit in Chomsky\u2019s\nterminology. The charge can be made using any of the different\nphrasings he has used to express his internalism, including\ncompetence, knowledge, and representation.\nFor the first: competence implies competence in something.\nFor that something to be defined in terms of the language faculty\nitself, there would be no such thing as incompetence, making a\nnonsense of talk of competence. Error would be impossible (see Barber\n2001). For the second: knowledge implies something known\u2014an\nexternal language or some subset of its properties. Chomsky has\ndescribed these criticisms as arising from a misinterpretation of his\nview, and said that he was using competence and knowledge in a\ntechnical sense rather than in full accordance with ordinary usage. He\nhas occasionally suggested \u201ccognize\u201d as an alternative\nterm of art to prevent confusion, where to cognize an I-language is\nfor it to be represented in one\u2019s language\n faculty.[5]\n Recent iterations of the criticism have thus tended to focus on\nrepresentation. It seems that there can be no representing without\nsomething\u2019s being represented\u2014something external to the\nthing doing the representating, and so external to the language\nfaculty or even the individual. Chomsky\u2019s response has been to\nsay that he is not using representation in a relation sense,\nrepresentation of (1995a: 53 and in Antony and\nHornstein 2003: 276\u20137).\n\nThe notion of representation is central to a good deal of cognitive\nscience and is a topic that has preoccupied many philosophers of mind\nand language who share Chomsky\u2019s naturalistic bent. Many of the\nlatter have been surprised and puzzled by his rejection of both the\nrelational notion of representation (where the relation is between\nvehicles of representation in the mind/brain, and the things they\nrepresent) and attempts to define this relation in naturalistic\nlanguage (see\n causal theories of mental content,\n intentionality, and\n mental representation).\n Georges Rey, for example, sees the intentionality, the\n\u201caboutness\u201d, implicit in the notion of representation as\nessential to the computational-representational theory of\nmind\u2014precisely the theory that he and others think\nChomsky\u2019s work has helped to inspire and shape (Rey 2003a,b\n& 2005). Rey concludes that Chomsky is mistaken about the status\nhis own theory, and offers instead what he thinks is a more charitable\ninterpretation: that the representations are of something, but\ntypically inaccurate and harmlessly so.\n\nIn the earlier presentation\n (3.1.1)\n we tried to capture Chomsky\u2019s arelational notion of\nrepresentation, where to describe something as representating an\nI-language is simply a way of describing it abstractly. John Collins\nhas gone to greater lengths to make good this suggestion that there\ncould be representations without representata (2014). Adopting \u201cdyadic\nrepresentational talk\u201d helps us to \u201cframe generalizations\nabout monadic representational states\u201d, he says. Representata\nare no more than the byproducts of a grammarians\u2019 attempt to\ntype non-relational states the mind/brain can be in or pass through.\nInvoking them does not generate any ontological commitment to\nlanguages external to the mind/brain being described.\n\nFrances Egan has taken a view that appears to capture the spirit of\nChomsky\u2019s attitude to representation while also making room (and\nseeing the need) for a relational notion of representational content\nin cognitive explanation (generally, and in linguistics in\nparticular). According to Egan (2003, 2014), representational\ncontent\u2014the dyadic notion, that is\u2014figures in cognitive\nexplanation, but not in the way orthodoxy would have it. The internal\ncomputational mechanism alone, uninterpreted, does the explaining.\nThat this mechanism has the representational content it does figures\nonly within the explanans. It is used to specify the explanandum.\nThis explanandum, and hence any allocation to it of content, will\noften be quite vaguely characterized, and may even fail to correspond\nto anything real.\n\n\nBecause the mechanism, as computationally characterized, would not\ntrack these [external] properties in every environment, the semantic\ninterpretation of the device is not an essential characterization, and\ncannot serve to individuate it. However, the semantic interpretation\nenables us to specify the cognitive function of the mechanism, to\ncharacterize it as computing [visual] depth from disparity, for\nexample, or as computing the syntactic structure of a sentence. (Egan\n2014: 98)\n\n\nThis is arguably in the same spirit as Chomsky\u2019s description of\nthe language faculty as \u201cproviding instructions\u201d to\nperformance systems (1995b: 15). Representations in the language\nfaculty corresponding to elements of a grammar such as [voiced coronal\nsibilant], for example, do not stand for movements of the mouth (such\nas the one produced at the beginning of an utterance of the English\nword zebra), but they might nonetheless be part of the causal\nstory of why a human moves her or his mouth in a particular way in\nparticular circumstances.\n\nMany of those engaged in this debate focus on cases such as the edges\nin Kaniza\u2019s triange illusion (figure 1) or PRO (a sytanctic\nconstituent to which nothing corresponds in the sound-stream). The nub\nof the issue, here, seems to be what to make of the fact that there is\nno edge, or no syntactic constituent, beyond the edge or syntactic\nconstituent represented in our mind-brain. The same might even hold of\nthe notion of a common language. What we make of this for the nature\nof cognitive explanation, and of the notion of representation that so\ntypically figures within it, is yet to be settled, and goes to the\nvery heart of the philosophy of cognitive science.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Kanizsa\u2019s Triange (from\n Wikimedia Commons, by User:Fibonacci)\n\n3.3 Second Response to the I-language Perspective: Psycholinguistics\n\nMore recently, a whole field of scientific research,\npsycholinguistics, has been precisely dedicated to studying external,\nanti-individualistic, mind-independent properties of language,\nmassively advancing our understanding of language development in the\nprocess (see Hoff and Shatz 2007). The guiding assumption within this\nfield is that external factors, such as the child\u2019s social and\nphysical environment, can play a substantial role in determining both\nthe child\u2019s linguistic competence and the vocabulary and syntax\nof the acquired language. On this view, such external factors supply\nmost, if not all, of the relevant stimuli for language acquisition,\ncontrary to Chomsky\u2019s central poverty of stimulus argument for\nI-languages.\n\nSeveral different inquires have benefited from psycholinguistic\nstudies of overt linguistic behavior. These include questions about\nthe relative autonomy of distinct areas of linguistic knowledge, such\nas the question: are syntax, semantics and pragmatics independent from\neach other, or do they rather support each other? (see Gleitman,\nCassidy, et al. 2005; Gleitman 1990; Naigles and Swensen 2007; and\nDiesendruck 2007); and about the role of the child in the process of\nlanguage acquisition: is the child a passive subject, or an active\nparticipant within her linguistic community (see Shatz 1987, 1994;\nShafer and Garrido-Nag 2007; and Poulin-Dubois and Graham 2007)?\n\nWe saw (in section\n 3.1.1\n and\n 3.1.2)\n that Chomsky\u2019s case for I-languages and against E-languages is\nheavily entwined with the poverty of stimulus assumption. This is used\nto defend the claim that human languages are little more than\nmodifications of UG, and that the process of language acquisition and\ndevelopment is the process of such modifications. But studies have\nshown that social input, which children may pick up from and rely on,\nis rich both in content and structure (see Baldwin and Meyer 2007). In\nchild-directed speech, adults use words in a way that makes it easier\nfor children to identify the relevant information (see Brent and\nSiskind 2001; Akhtar, Dunham, and Dunham 1991), suggesting that social\ninput is highly relevant to the development of semantic knowledge.\nEven if we limit the UG hypothesis to a claim about syntax there are\nempirical challenges. According to this more limited reading, the\nacquisition of syntactic process is \u201cseen to rely most heavily\non the operation of innate structural principles\u201d (Baldwin and\nMeyer 2007: 95). Social input, on this view, plays a mere triggering\nrole. Further studies have shown this hypothesis to be controversial.\nAlternative, socio-pragmatic, accounts have shown that children can\nlearn syntax from adult language use (see Tomasello 2003, 2004).\nChildren\u2019s domain general abilities of statistical analysis, and\npattern and intention recognition, are believed to assist the child in\nidentifying and acquiring syntactic structure from the social\nlinguistic input they receive (see Saffran, Aslin, and Newport 1996;\nGentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov 2001). In general, the empirical\nevidence obtained by psycholinguistic studies strongly suggests that\nlanguage acquisition and development is much more than just a process\nof UG modifications by means of mind/brain maturation.\n\nHowever these debates evolve, two things seem clear. First, the\nexternal, anti-individualistic, mind-independent properties of\nlanguage, including overt linguistic behavior, are apt for proper\nscientific investigation. Exactly how much of a threat this is to\nChomsky\u2019s view is a matter for debate, since as we saw (in\n 3.1.2)\n he insists he is not denying that language is at least partly a\nsocial product; but the claims made on the back of these results\ncertainly seem to run contrary to the thrust of his internalism. And,\nsecond, against Chomsky\u2019s skepticism, there are good reasons to\ndevelop such research into external influences, as it may prove to be\ncentral for a proper understanding of the semantics, and even the\ngrammar and syntax, of human language and its acquisition.\n4. Further Reading\n\nFor thoughts on how best to characterize an idiolectal conception of\nlanguage, and views on how such a conception sits with respect to\nChomskian internalism and to conventionalist views, see George 1990\nand Higginbotham 2006.\n\nThe theory of conventions used in Lewis 1975 is developed at length in\nhis earlier book (1969). The resulting theory of language is\nelaborated by Bennett 1976 and criticized in Burge 1975 and Laurence\n1996. Wiggins 1997 and Millikan 2005, like Lewis, see languages as\nessentially social in nature (Chomsky replies to a version of the\nlatter in Antony and Hornstein 2003).\n\nA special issue of the journal Inquiry (see Begby &\nRamberg 2016) contains a handful of useful discussions of\nDavidson\u2019s influential 1986 article. These include Stainton\n2016, which rejects what the author describes as Davidson\u2019s case\nagainst public languages, adding to parallel criticisms of Chomskian\narguments to the same end in Stainton 2011. For work on the\npragmatics/semantics boundary, much of it raising similar issues, see\nStanley 2000, Carston 2002, Borg 2004, Recanati 2004, Cappelen and\nLepore 2005, and Szab\u00f3 2005. In earlier work on\nDavidson\u2019s paper, his anti-conventionalism is discussed by\nHacking 1986, Dummett 1986, Pietroski 1994, and Reimer 2004. Hacking\naddresses the extent to which Davidson\u2019s conclusion undermines\nhis earlier philosophy of language. Dummett attempts to show that the\nnotion of a prior theory presupposes the notion of a linguistic\ncommunity, and hence of a shared language.\n\nMcGilvray 1999 and Smith and Allott 2016 both offer clear introductions to\nChomsky\u2019s philosophy of language and linguistics, including his\nE-/I-language distinction. A shorter account of his views on this\ntopic in particular can be found in Bezuidenhout 2006. Critical\ndiscussion can be found in five collections: George 1989, Otero 1994\n(Volume II), Antony and Hornstein 2003, Barber 2003, and McGilvray\n2005. Chomsky\u2019s own non-technical writing is usually accessible.\nGood starting places would be the second chapter of Chomsky 1986, the\nessays in Chomsky 2000 (some of which also appeared within his 1995a),\nor the early sections of Chapter 1 of his 1995b (co-written with\nHoward Lasnik).\n\nHoff and Shatz 2007 offers an excellent overview of the field of\nlanguage development, including foundational issues, as well as\nsyntactic, semantic and pragmatic topics in infancy, early childhood\nand atypical development.",
