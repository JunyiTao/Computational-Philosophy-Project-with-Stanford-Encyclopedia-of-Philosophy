    "main_text": "Actual Causation || Problem Cases\n4.2 Problem Cases\n\nActual causes can sometimes lower the probability of their effects in\ncases of preemption: Suppose that Billy and Suzy are aiming\nrocks at a bottle. Billy decides that he will give Suzy the\nopportunity to throw first; he will throw his rock just in case Suzy\ndoesn\u2019t throw hers. For mathematical convenience, we will assume\nthat there is some small probability\u20140.1 say\u2014that Billy\ndoes not faithfully execute his plan. Billy is a more accurate thrower\nthan Suzy. If Billy throws his rock, there is a 90% chance that it\nwill shatter the bottle; if Suzy throws, she has a 50% chance of\nsuccess. Suzy throws her rock and Billy doesn\u2019t; Suzy\u2019s\nrock hits the bottle and smashes it. By throwing, Suzy lowered the\nprobability of shattering from 81% (the probability that Billy would\nboth throw and hit if Suzy hadn\u2019t thrown) to 54.5%\n(accommodating the small probability that Billy will throw even if\nSuzy throws). Suzy\u2019s throw preempts Billy\u2019s\nthrow: she prevents Billy from throwing, and substitutes her own, less\nreliable throw. Nonetheless, Suzy\u2019s throw actually caused the\nbottle to shatter.\n\nChanging the example slightly gives us a case of a probability-raising\nnon-cause. Suppose that Billy and Suzy throw their rocks\nsimultaneously. As it happens, Suzy\u2019s throw hits the bottle and\nBilly\u2019s misses. Nonetheless, Billy\u2019s throw increased the\nprobability that the bottle would shatter from 50% (the probability\nthat Suzy would hit) to 95% (the probability that at least one of them\nwould hit). But Billy\u2019s throw did not in fact cause the bottle\nto shatter. In the terminology of Schaffer (2001), Billy\u2019s throw\nis a fizzler. It had the potential to shatter the bottle, but\nit fizzled out, and something else actually caused the bottle to\nbreak.\n",
