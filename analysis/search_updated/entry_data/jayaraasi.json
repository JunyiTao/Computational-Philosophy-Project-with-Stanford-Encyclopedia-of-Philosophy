    "preamble": "\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, who most likely flourished\nbetween 800\u2013840 probably in Southern India, was an Indian\nphilosopher, a \u2018qualified sceptic\u2019, resorting to a kind of\nmethodological scepticism, affiliated to the materialist\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school of thought, the author of one\nof most extraordinary philosophical works in India, the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha (\u2018The Lion of the Dissolution of\n[all] Categories\u2019\u00a0or \u2018The Lion [Destroying] the\nDelusion of Categories\u2019). His main claim is that it is not\npossible to arrive at true knowledge with standard means recognized by\nthe traditionally adopted model of cognitive procedures\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) in Indian epistemology, because one should first\nproperly define basic criteria of validity for valid cognitive\nprocedures, which is not possible without a prior true knowledge of\nreality against which we could test the procedures for validity etc.\nAs it is traditionally argued, our knowledge of reality and of objects\ndepends on valid cognitive procedures. However, as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\npoints out, all valid cognitive procedures are either fundamentally\nflawed and ultimately unreliable or they require further valid\ncognitive procedures, and these stand in the same need etc. Therefore,\nwithin the traditional epistemological model, we can neither formulate\nproper definitions of valid cognitive procedures nor define what\nreality is and what basic categories are. This is at least the case,\nhe claims, with all the cognitive tools and epistemological categories\nwhich are traditionally claimed to be now at our disposal. He has been\ndifferently classified as a sceptic, agnostic or materialist.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life, Works, and Philosophical Affiliation\n1.1 The Dating of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n\nThe first serious attempt to date Jayar\u0101\u015bi\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da was undertaken by Sukhl\u0101lj\u012b\nSa\u1e41ghav\u012b and Rasikl\u0101l C. P\u0101r\u012bkh, who brought\nthe Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha to light, in their 1940 edition\n(p. iv-xi) of the treatise, assign the work to 8th century (p. x).\nThis dating was slightly modified by Sukhl\u0101lj\u012b\nSa\u1e41ghav\u012b (1941) who placed Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha between 725\u2013825, which, in turn, is\naccepted by Eli Franco (1987: 12\u201313). However, the latter, in\nthe \u2018Preface to the second edition\u2019 of 1994, modifies the\ndate of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and assigns him to the\nperiod of 770\u2013830 on the basis of what he thinks are\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s indirect references (primarily terminological\ngrounds) to the Buddhist philosopher Dharmottara (ca.\n740\u2013800).\n\nIn fact, that dating of the Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha could be\nslightly modified to perhaps 800\u2013840. I would place\nJayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da after the Digambara Jaina\nphilosopher Akala\u1e45ka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (c. 720\u2013780) and\nbefore Vidy\u0101nanda P\u0101trakesarisv\u0101min (c. 850), a\nphilosopher in the same tradition who commented on Akala\u1e45ka. As\nFranco (1994: XI) himself notices, the Buddhist Kamala\u015b\u012bla\n(c. 740\u2013795) nowhere refers to Jayar\u0101\u015bi in his\nencyclopedic commentary of the Tattva-sa\u1e45graha. Further, we\nfind no mention of Jayar\u0101\u015bi in the oeuvre of Akala\u1e45ka\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da, although he was very well acquainted with current\nideas of his contemporaries. It would be especially surprising in the\ncase of Akala\u1e45ka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da not to mention an author who\ngreatly influenced the way Jaina thinkers argued and formulated their\nthoughts, because both of them seem to belong to South India. On a few\noccasions Akala\u1e45ka did have a chance to either allude or even\ndirectly refer to such an original thinker as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\ncertainly was, but he nowhere does it. A good instance is\nAkala\u1e45ka\u2019s work A\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bat\u012b \u2018In Eight\nHundred Lines\u2019 (itself a commentary on the work\n\u0100pta-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, \u2018An Examination of An\nAuthoritative Person\u2019) of Samantabhadra, c. 580\u2013640). In\nit, (the commentary on verse 1.3 of\n\u0100pta-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, A\u1e63\u015ap.2 = A\u1e63S\n29.20), Akala\u1e45ka refers to a materialist argument: \u2018[The\nopponent]: \u201cFor this reason it has been said that there is no\nomniscient person, because truth claims [of various teachers competing\nfor primacy] turn out to be wrong cognitive criteria, inasmuch as\nthere is no difference between them (i.e., all are equal in their\nconvincing force). Since one accepts that [it is not possible to\ndecide for or against a view among a few competing ones], there is\nnothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient person].\u201d\n[Akala\u1e45ka:] Ergo this decision of some [thinkers, i.e.,\nmaterialists] is itself void of any rational basis. For, as we know,\nthe scope of perception [which could prove the materialist\u2019s rejection\nof an omniscient person] cannot itself demonstrate that there cannot\nbe any other proof of an omniscient person, because this would have\ntoo far-reaching consequences. Neither can [the materialist prove that\nan omniscient person cannot exist] with the help of inference\n\u00a0(anum\u0101na), because it has no validity [for him]\u2019.\nAkala\u1e45ka clearly has in mind a typical materialist philosopher\nwho rejects the idea of omniscience, but at the same time accepts\nperception (pratyak\u1e63a) as the only valid instrument of\nknowledge, while rejecting the validity of inference (anum\u0101na).\nThat is a standard account of a materialist (C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata) thinker in India and there is really nothing to suggest\nthat what Akala\u1e45ka had here in mind as the target of his\ncriticism was a \u2018qualified sceptic\u2019 (like\nJayar\u0101\u015bi) who rejected the ultimate validity also of\nperception.\n\nHowever, the account changes in what Vidy\u0101nanda (c. 850) has to\nsay on Akala\u1e45ka\u2019s passage. Vidy\u0101nanda is, to our knowledge,\nthe first Indian philosopher to know of and to directly refer to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. In his A\u1e63\u1e6da-sahasr\u012b \u2018In\nEight Thousand Lines\u2019, Vidy\u0101nanda (A\u1e63S 29.20\u201336.6)\ntakes the passage \u2018\u201cSince one accepts that [it is not\npossible to decide for or against a view among a few competing ones],\nthere is nothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient\nperson].\u201d [Akala\u1e45ka:] Ergo this decision of some\n[thinkers, i.e., materialists] is itself void of any rational\nbasis\u2019 (tath\u00ea\u1e63\u1e6datv\u0101d ado\u1e63a ity\neke\u1e63\u0101m\napr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ikaiv\u00ea\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25) as\nexplicitly implying two kinds of approaches to the same question.\nFirst (A\u1e63S 29.20 ff.), he says some nihilistic thinkers (eke)\nare the Lauk\u0101yatika (the followers of Lok\u0101yata, the\nmaterialist school), who do not admit any instrument of knowledge\nwhich would could go beyond the perceptible world, i.e., they accept\nperception as the only cognitive criterion. Second, Vidy\u0101nanda\nsays (A\u1e63S 31.2 ff.), there are also \u2018those who propound\nthe dissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din), a term which could hardly be more\nunivocal in its clearly referring to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. Had\nAkala\u1e45ka known of Jayar\u0101\u015bi, his \u2018qualified\nscepticism\u2019 and rejection of the validity of perception also, he\nwould have included him among those who rejected the idea of an\nomniscient being.\n\nThat Jayar\u0101\u015bi postdates Akala\u1e45ka is evident also from\nthe fact that, in his Ascertainment of Perfection\n(Siddhi-vini\u015bcaya), Akala\u1e45ka refers to\n\u2018heretics\u2019 (n\u0101stika) and to the materialist\ntradition, which maintains that the world is composed of the four\nelements, but at the same time accepts only one valid cognitive\nprocedure (pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception (pratyak\u1e63a),\nnot even inference (anum\u0101na), and therefore cannot demonstrate\nsuch element-based structure of the universe, or alternatively\nentertains a possibility that there are no valid cognitive procedures\nat all (pram\u0101\u1e47\u00e2bh\u0101va) or finds problems with\ndefining what perception is\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u00e2nupapatti; SVi 4.12, p.\n272.3\u20135). These are clearly the forerunners of the ideas\nelaborated by Jayar\u0101\u015bi, however at the time of\nAkala\u1e45ka they are still in an undeveloped form, and clearly the\nJaina philosopher does not refer to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. However, his\ncommentator Anantav\u012brya (SVi\u1e6c, p. 277.6\u2013278.22)\nimmediately recognizes in these nascent ideas the elaborated system of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, retroactively projecting them onto\nAkala\u1e45ka\u2019s passage, and refers to Jayar\u0101\u015bi and\nhis treatise by name.\n1.2 Native Place of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n\nAs little as we know of the exact dates of his life even less we know\nabout the place where he flourished, and we are actually left to\nspeculations, for no hard evidence, such as inscriptions etc., can be\nfound to help us. There are three points that might suggest\nJayar\u0101\u015bi was of South India, all being rather weak. The\nstrongest evidence is the circulation and reception of the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha: the first mention of the work is made\nby South Indian Digambara authors Vidy\u0101nanda (c. 850) and\nAnantav\u012brya (turn of 10th and 11th centuries). Another equally\nweak piece of evidence is that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s critical method of\nargument (see below), which the Jainas adopt, first penetrates the\nworks of South Indian Digambara authors, incidentally the same who are\nthe first to make reference to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. This method of\ncritique becomes the standard one among Gujarati Jainas only at a\nlater stage. The third argument in favour of South Indian origin of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi (Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b\u2013P\u0101r\u012bkh 1940,\nxi), even weaker that the two above, is his title Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nregularly appended to the names of a number of South Indian\nphilosophers and often used as an official title of South Indian\nDigambara high rank clerics (bha\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nbha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka). Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s title might suggest\nhe was both South Indian and a Brahmin by social class (var\u1e47a).\nHowever, the title Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not exclusively used by\nBrahmins or exclusively in South India, though there is indeed a\ncertain tendency of this kind. However, since there seems nothing at\nall to suggest that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was born in North India, even\nsuch slight hints gain some evidential weight.\n1.3 Works of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n\nThe only preserved work of Jayar\u0101\u015bi is the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha (\u2018The Lion [Destroying] the\nDelusion of Categories\u2019, often interpreted as \u2018The Lion of\nthe Dissolution of [all] Categories\u2019 or \u2018The Lion which\nAnnihilates [all] Principles\u2019). Its palm leaf manuscript was\ndiscovered in 1926 in a manuscript library at Patan by\nSukhl\u0101lj\u012b Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b and Rasikl\u0101l C.\nP\u0101r\u012bkh, and the text remained virtually unknown until its\npublication in 1940.\n\nThe work was quite well known in mediaeval philosophical milieu, both\nin the South and North of India, but hardly ever treated in a way a\nserious and original philosophical treatise deserves: Indian\nphilosophers of established traditions do not, as a rule, refer to the\nwork directly or refute its contents, not to mention any attempt at\nthe providing a genuine appraisal of the work or entering into\ndiscussion with its author. They simply ignored it.\n\nTwo reasons might be mentioned for such a situation. First, Indian\nphilosophers did not principally engage in discussions with\nrepresentatives of the materialist school, except for standardised\ndismissive refutations of a few basic materialist theories, which are\nmentioned by Indian philosophers in their works in order to render a\n\u2018complete\u2019 picture of the philosophical spectrum. These\nstandardised, habitually repeated refutations were not applicable to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, who was not a typical representative of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school. New powerful philosophical\nmachinery would have to be applied to engage in a discussion with\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. And that is precisely the second reason: the\narguments Jayar\u0101\u015bi consistently applies, his rigid and\ncoherent lines of argumentation proved to be an extremely hard piece\nof cake to swallow for those whose views he criticised. It seems,\ntherefore, that the general approach of Indian philosophers\nvis-\u00e0-vis Jayar\u0101\u015bi was that of disregard and failure\nto notice the weight of his work. A few exceptions can be mentioned\nthough of those who attempted to engage with\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s arguments, notably two Jaina philosophers,\nVidy\u0101nanda and Anantav\u012brya, and a propounder of the\nNy\u0101ya system, Bh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a (Franco (1994:\u00a0\n553\u2013586)). Jayar\u0101\u015bi is occasionally mentioned in a\npositive light when Indian authors acknowledge his powerful method of\ncritical analysis, and these are primarily, or even exclusively, Jaina\nauthors. Sometimes they even refer to Jayar\u0101\u015bi as an expert\nin some fields, e.g. by Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (c. 1229), who says:\n\u2018A refutation of all cognitive criteria in details should be\nconsulted from the Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha\u2019 (SVM,\np.118.1\u20132).\n\nThe text of Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha was preserved without any\ncommentary and it seems that its was never commented upon. We cannot\nsay with absolute certainty whether its author had any followers or\nwhether he established an independent school, but that is not unlikely\nbecause we occasionally come across the expression\ntattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din in the plural: \u2018those who\npropound the dissolution of [all] categories\u2019 in philosophical\nliterature, and across the single term Tattv\u00f4paplava used as if\nit denoted a separate school.\n\nIt is not certain whether Jayar\u0101\u015bi composed any other work.\nHe himself refers to a treatise entitled Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra\n(\u2018The Quintessence of the Definition [of Cognitive Criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a)]\u2019) on one occasion, while refuting the\nusage of the term \u2018non-verbal\u2019 (avyapade\u015bya) in the\ndefinition of the cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a, or\n\u2018veridical instrument of knowledge\u2019) of the Ny\u0101ya\nschool. There, he says that the inapplicability of the term has\nalready been shown in the Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra and one should\nconsult that work. It is highly probable that he indeed refers to his\nown text for the simple reason that he generally does not mention any\nworks of any other authors either in support of his own views or in\nfavourable light, except for the materialist teacher B\u1e5bhaspati\nand his B\u1e5bhaspati-s\u016btra. Still, it is not impossible that\nthe text he referred to under the title Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra\nmight have been penned by another representative of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school who had been held in esteem\nby Jayar\u0101\u015bi, e.g. his own guru.\n1.4 Philosophical Affiliation of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n\nThere has been some controversy concerning whether Jayar\u0101\u015bi\ncould at all be ranked among the representatives of the Indian\nmaterialist school, i.e., among the C\u0101rv\u0101kas /\nLok\u0101yatas. Until the publication of the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha, Jayar\u0101\u015bi was considered a\ntypical representative of the materialist school. It all changed when\nthe publication of the work in 1940 made the text available to\nscholars. The publication revealed that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s view are\nfar from what one considered \u00a0\u2018standard\u2019 or\n\u2018orthodox\u2019 materialism and hardly compatible with what we\nso far knew about the schools of the C\u0101rv\u0101kas /\nLok\u0101yatas. As a result, a wide range of conflicting\ninterpretations abound as to how to classify\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s philosophy.\n\nSukhl\u0101lj\u012b Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b and Rasikl\u0101l C.\nP\u0101r\u012bkh (1940: xi-xii) take the text as \u2018a work of the\nLok\u0101yata or C\u0101rv\u0101ka school, or to be more precise\n\u2013 of a particular division of that school\u2019, emphasising\nthat Jayar\u0101\u015bi \u2018is developing the doctrine of the\northodox (!) Lok\u0101yata\u2019 \u00a0with a \u2018critical\nmethod\u2019 (p. xii). The tradition of ascribing the view to\nSa\u1e41ghav\u012b and P\u0101r\u012bkh that the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha is \u2018a genuine C\u0101rv\u0101ka\nwork\u2019 relies rather on the misreading of what both the authors\nsay: they are well aware that Jayar\u0101\u015bi develops an original\nand independent school within what he himself considered a materialist\ntradition. This view, adopted also by Ruben (1958), is somewhat\nmodified by Franco (1987: 4\u20138), who speaks of a \u2018radical\nchange from a rather primitive materialism to a highly sophisticated\nform of scepticism\u2019, and also recently by Ethan Mills (2018),\nwho claims that Jayar\u0101\u015bi developed \u2018materialist\nstrains\u2019 and represented \u2018skepticism about\nphilosophy\u2019, or \u2018skepticism about epistemology\u2019\n(Mills (2015), (2018)).\n\nThus, a group of other researchers (e.g., Koller (1977), Matilal\n(1985: 482), Matilal (1986: 27), Solomon (2010: xvi), Jha (2013: vii),\nGokhale (2015: 156\u2013157), Mills (2018)) classify\nJayar\u0101\u015bi as a sceptic, either loosely affiliated to the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition or not at all, even as an\nanti-religious sceptic (Matilal (1985: 482)), a radical sceptic\n(Franco (1987: 3\u20138)), \u2018the full-fledged form of Indian\nSkepticism\u2019 (Solomon (2010: xvi)), an extreme sceptic who\nrepresents \u2018a kind of anarchism in the realm of values\u2019\n(Gokhale (2015: 180, 155)), sometimes also as an agnostic (Ruben\n(1958); Matilal (1985: 483, n. 10)), or a combination of both, being\nan author of \u2018a work in defence of scepticism, or at best,\nagnosticism\u2019 (Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya\u2019s\n\u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d to\nChattopadhyaya\u2013Gangopadhyaya (1990: xiv)). A rather unusual\nstance on Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s affiliation is represented by\nK.K. Dixit (1962: 103) / (1990: 529), who claims that he was both a\nmaterialist and\u2026 \u2018a worshipper of illogic\u2019\n(sic!).\n\nStill another line of researchers disagree that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\nbelonged to the materialist tradition at all, typical proponents of\nthis opinion being Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya (1959), (1989) and Karel\nWerner (1995). Chattopadhyaya (1989) argues that since\nJayar\u0101\u015bi criticises all philosophical views and schools, he\ncannot be reckoned as an adherent of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata tradition, because one can either be a materialist or\nsceptic; and clearly Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s philosophical views do not\nfit into the typical materialist framework. Karel Werner (1995) seems\nto support such an approach, although with some reservations, but\nwithout any solid rational argument, except for an subjective\nimpression. Recently, also Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2009: 51, 76 n.\n43) follows this line of interpretations and argues that\n\u2018Jayar\u0101\u015bi was not a\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka/Lok\u0101yata\u2019, suggesting that he was not a\nsceptic but represented \u2018a fundamental idealist (solipsist)\nposition\u2019. To this group belong also both A.K. Warder (1956:\n52), who accepts that he was neither a materialist nor sceptic but a\npositivist instead, and K.N. Jayatilleke (1963: 82), who interprets\nhim as \u2018not a sceptic but an absolute nihilist in his\nmetaphysics\u2019 and \u2018a pragmatic materialist\u2019 and\n\u2018a logical sceptic\u2019 (p. 91).\n\nThere could hardly be a better source of information on the true\naffiliation of Jayar\u0101\u015bi than the author himself. He nowhere\nstates in his work that he is a C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata, in\nwhich he does not differ from all other Indian authors who nowhere\nmention their philosophical affiliations in the form: \u2018The\nauthor of the present work is Buddhist\u2019 or \u2018I am a\nfollower of the Ny\u0101ya school\u2019. In most cases, such\naffiliations are communicated through the opening sections, e.g. in\nthe introductory verses (ma\u1e45gal\u00e2cara\u1e47a), or in the\ncolophons, but usually an indirect manner, e.g. by paying homage to\nthe Awakened One (buddha) or to a guru or Mah\u00ea\u015bvara, or\nthrough some other hint, but it is hardly ever done directly, in an\nunequivocal manner. Unfortunately, the preserved text of\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha does not contain any introductory\nverses (probably there were none). The only concealed information in\nthe opening section of the work could be found the first verse that\noccurs in the very beginning which says: \u2018The worldly path\n(laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25) should be followed\u2026/ With respect\nto everyday practice of the world (loka-vyavah\u0101ra), the fool and\nthe wise are similar\u2019 (TUS, p.1.9\u201310 = Franco (1987:\n68\u20136\u20137) \u00a0= Solomon (2010: 1\u20132) = Jha (2013: 2)),\nquoted from some other source, taken as authoritative by\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. The expression \u2018the worldly path\u2019\n(laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25) often occurs as a reference to the\nLok\u0101yata (\u2018the followers of the worldly [practice]\u2019),\ne.g. by Haribhadra in his \u015aVS1.64. Most importantly, however,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi on several occasions quotes verses of\nB\u1e5bhaspati in order to either support his own opinion or to show\nthat there is no disagreement between the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha and the tradition of B\u1e5bhaspati\n\u00a0(cf. Franco (1987: 5)). Further, he explicitly mentions the\nmaterialist teacher by name and refers to him with reverence\n\u2018Honourable B\u1e5bhaspati\u2019 (bhagav\u0101n\nb\u1e5bhaspati\u1e25, TUS, p.45.10\u201311 = Franco (1987: 228.10)\n\u00a0= Solomon (2010: 229) = Jha (2013:\n 187)),[1]\n the reverential term occurring only once in the whole work. This is\nrather unique, for Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not seem to follow any\nauthorities or to quote passages and opinions which he unreservedly\nviews in favourable light. There can hardly be any doubt, that\nJayar\u0101\u015bi placed himself within that tradition and apparently\nacknowledged that he was originally trained within it.\n\nIn the colophon of the treatise (TUP, p. 125.13\u201318 = Franco\n(1987: 7) = Solomon (2010: 98) = Jha (2013: 463\u2013464)),\nJayar\u0101\u015bi explicitly pays homage to B\u1e5bhaspati, here\nreferred to by his traditional epithet \u2018preceptor of gods\u2019\n(sura-guru; cf. Bhattacharya (2009: 25, 51, 76)), and so does the\nauthor refers to himself as \u2018preceptor of deities (gods)\u2019\n(deva-guru):\n\n\n\u2018Even [all] such unshakeable reductio arguments (vikalpa) that\nescaped the attention of the\u00a0 preceptor of gods (i.e.\nB\u1e5bhaspati) find their way into this lucid [treatise] that\ncrushes the conceit of charlatans. This [lucid treatise], titled\n\u201cThe Lion [Destroying] the Delusion of Categories\u201d, which\ncontributes to great advantage and will gain excellent reputation, has\nbeen composed by [me], the preceptor of deities (gods) [known as]\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da \u015ar\u012b\n Jayar\u0101\u015bi.[2]\n [These] reductio arguments of Jayar\u0101\u015bi [found] in this\n[treatise] are efficacious in annihilating the charlatans, are\nelaborated by [Jayar\u0101\u015bi who is] the ocean of knowledge, [and\nare meant to] vanquish disputants.\u2019\n\n\nThe idea which Jayar\u0101\u015bi here expresses is clear: he follows\nthe footsteps of his own preceptor, B\u1e5bhaspati (both\n\u2018preceptor of gods\u2019), developing the latter\u2019s\narguments and augmenting them with his own, more sophisticated.\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi criticises basically all philosophical schools with\ntwo exceptions: the Advaita Ved\u0101nta of \u015aa\u1e45kara and the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school. The reason for being silent\non the tradition of \u015aa\u1e45kara was that the latter was either\ncontemporaneous or posterior to Jayar\u0101\u015bi, but there would\nhave been no reason not to formulate any criticism against the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school, if that had not been\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s own tradition. Further, even though\nJayar\u0101\u015bi is generally very cautious not to express his own\npositive views and theories, there are several exceptions, which\nclearly reveal his materialistic outlook (see \n Section 2.3 Positive Views below).\n\nThere is also some external evidence corroborating to a certain degree\nthe thesis about C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata affiliation of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. Vidy\u0101nanda who first mentions\nJayar\u0101\u015bi brings some interesting details to light (alluded\nto above). In his A\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bat\u012b (A\u1e63S\n29.20\u201336.7), he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers\nwho reject a number of vital principles and claim that \u2018There is\nno [reliable] omniscient authority (t\u012brtha-k\u0101ra), there is\nno [reliable] cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a), there is no\n[reliable] authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any\nkind of [reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each\nother,\u2019 and he quotes a popular verse: \u2018Reasoning is not\nestablished, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a\ncognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral\nlaw (dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available).\nThe [proper] path is that taken by the majority of\n people\u2019[3].\n Whether the verse comes from an unidentified Lok\u0101yata source,\nwhich is not impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayar\u0101\u015bi in\nthe above mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the\nexpression \u2018the worldly path\u2019 (laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25).\nInterestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The\ncategory of such \u2018nihilists\u2019 includes (1) the followers of\nthe Lok\u0101yata school (lauk\u0101yatika, A\u1e63S 29.26), also\nknown as the C\u0101rv\u0101ka (A\u1e63S 30.25), who are associated\nwith the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e.\nperception, and (2) the category of \u2018those who propound the\ndissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din, A\u1e63S 31.2). Vidy\u0101nanda\n(A\u1e63S 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: \u2018Some who are\nthose who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all\nthe categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2)\nall the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not\nestablished)\u2019. Throughout his text, Vidy\u0101nanda keeps these\ntwo traditions \u2013 the Lok\u0101yata and the Tattv\u00f4paplava \u2014\nseparate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically\nrelated, the main difference between them being whether one recognises\nat least one cognitive criterion (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata)\nor none (Jayar\u0101\u015bi). Further on, Vidy\u0101nanda begins the\nexposition of materialism (A\u1e63S, p. 35.22 ff.) which is\ndesignated with a generic term \u2018cognitive criteria-free\nassumption\u2019 (apram\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101 \u2026\ni\u1e63\u1e6di), among which the first variety represents standard\nmaterialists who accept perception as the only cognitive criterion\n(A\u1e63S, p. 35.19\u201337.9), and the second variety concerns\n\u2018those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din) who do not accept any cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) (A\u1e63S, p. 37.10 ff.). Also\nAnantav\u012brya explicitly classifies Jayar\u0101\u015bi as a\nmaterialist by making a pun the the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka: \u2018The\nauthor of \u201c[The Lion Destroying] the Delusion of\nCategories\u2019\u201d says what is charmingly chastised by the\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas\u2019 (SVi\u1e6c, p. 277.19:\ntattv\u00f4paplava-k\u1e5bd \u0101ha \u2013\nc\u0101rv\u0101kai\u015b c\u0101ru carcitam\u2026).\n\nA typical charge against Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s affiliation to\nmaterialists (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata), known for two main\nclaims \u2013 that there is only one cognitive criterion\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception, and the four elements compose\nall the universe, including consciousness \u2013 would the apparent\nparadox: Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to acknowledge neither. This led\nBhattacharya (2017: 353\u2013354) to dispute, on philologically\nimplausible grounds, that Jayar\u0101\u015bi refers to B\u1e5bhaspati\nand the B\u1e5bhaspati-s\u016btra as his own tradition. However, the\nearliest external recipients of Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s ideas, the\nJaina thinkers Vidy\u0101nanda and Anantav\u012brya, importantly\nascribe to Jayar\u0101\u015bi or to his immediate materialist\ntradition a saying that \u2018B\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s aphorisms are\nprimarily meant to refute the opponents with respect to all\n [issues].\u2019[4]\n This serves as an external evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi did\nacknowledge the authority of\u00a0 B\u1e5bhaspati and his aphorisms\nbut interpreted them in the spirit of his own methodological\nscepticism.\n\nThat there must have been some strain among the materialists prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi which both admitted that the world is composed of\nthe four elements and at the same time apparently doubted that there\nis any cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a) is reflected by\nAkala\u1e45ka, who points to the following paradox such a materialist\nwould have to face: \u2018As a result of the absence of cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) [the materialist] cannot ascertain that\nperception, and nothing else, is the only one [cognitive criterion],\nor [ascertain] the essence of cognoscible objects. Since, when other\ncognitive criteria are negated, a [proper] definition of perception\nbecomes inexplicable, what [cognoscible objects] by what [cognitive\ncriteria] could be established or negated, on account of which [one\ncould maintain that] the world is composed of the four\nelements?\u2019 (SVi 4.12, p. 272.3\u20135).\n\nOf significance is that Vidy\u0101nanda puts Jayar\u0101\u015bi on par\nwith the Buddhist doctrine of Emptiness (\u015b\u016bnya-v\u0101da),\nas represented by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and with Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists (brahma-v\u0101da), as three kinds of self-refuting theories\n(T\u015aVA 80.22\u201381.14; 195.14\u201316). This might\ntheoretically be taken as evidence that all three represented\nscepticism. However, since there is no hint that Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists were sceptics at all at that\n time,[5]\n and we have strong evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was not a\nsceptic, what Mills (2018) takes to be the three pillars of skepticism\nin classical India, namely N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Jayar\u0101\u015bi and\n\u015arihar\u1e63a, represented here by a forerunner, cannot be\nclassified as sceptics, despite their commonalities, as noticed by\nVidy\u0101nanda.\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi can be therefore taken as a genuine representative\nof an offshoot of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition,\nprimarily because he himself thought he was a follower of\nB\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s materialist tradition, and probably because he had\noriginally been trained in the materialist system. It also seems very\nlikely that the representatives of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata system occasionally had sceptical inclinations prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, which helped him to abandon typically materialist\nclaims and undertake his sceptical project. However, neither he nor\nhis work can be taken as typical representatives of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school or a first-hand source of\ninformation about that tradition. Despite this, the work remains the\nonly authentic, albeit not \u2018orthodox\u2019 treatise of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition that has come down to\nus.\n2. The Method and Philosophy of Jayar\u0101\u015bi\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi can be classified as a sceptic \u00a0only in a\nqualified sense (\u2018qualified sceptic\u2019), namely as a kind of\nmethodological sceptic, who consistently avails himself of a\nparticular method to analyse theories and the contents of\npropositions, but at the same time retains a set of positive\nbeliefs.\n2.1 Use of Reductio Arguments\n\nThe point of departure of his methodology is a sophisticated and\nhighly elaborated reductio type of argument (prasa\u1e45ga),\ndeveloped earlier within the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism and its\nprominent adherent Nag\u0101rjuna (c. 150 CE).\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses a particular thesis T of\nhis opponent by, first, listing all logical implications or all\ndoctrinally possible conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn, admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s system, that follow from thesis T. Then he demonstrates how\nand why each of such conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn either leads to an\nundesired consequence (logically problematic or unwelcome within the\nopponent\u2019s system) or contradicts the initial thesis T:\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nT \u2192 C1 \u2227 C2 \u2227 C3\n\u2227 \u2026 \u2227 Cn \n\n(2)\n|C1| = 0\n\n|C2| = 0\n\n|C3| = 0\n\n\u2026\n\n|Cn| = 0 \n\n(3)\n|T| = 0  \n\n\n\nwhere \u20180\u2019 stands not simply for \u2018false\u2019\n(logically), but may also stand for \u2018not admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019, or \u2018not compatible\nwith the opponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019. To analyse the\ntruth value or admissibility of each of the conclusions C1,\nC2, C3, \u2026 Cn, if their\nstructure is complex, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses the conclusions in\ntheir turn using exactly the same method.\n\nWhat may look like a well-known logical law that underlies the\nreductio ad absurdum argument, i.e.,\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 p,\n\n\nor like other typical laws of the proof by contradiction, i.e.,\n\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 (~p\u2192~q)] \u2192\np,\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 p, or\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 p ,\n\n\nseems at first closely mirrored by Jayar\u0101\u015bi. However, his\napproach is significantly different in one particular aspect. First,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi analyses positive theses in order to disprove them.\nSecondly, the reductio or the proof by contradiction, whereby p is\nrejected, does not commit one to admitting ~p in the sense of\naccepting a positive state of affairs contrary to p.\nJayar\u0101\u015bi is satisfied merely with a rejection of a thesis,\nwithout postulating his own solution to a problem. In other words,\nwhen Jayar\u0101\u015bi disproves thesis T by demonstrating that its\nconclusions C1, C2, C3, \u2026\nCn are all wrong (either false or doctrinally\ninadmissible), he does not commit himself to the contrary thesis ~T\nwith some kind of ontological entailment. The better way to describe\nhis method would be the following patterns:\n\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 ~p,\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 (p\u2192~q)] \u2192\n~p,\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 ~p, or\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 ~p ,\n\n\nTo give an example, Jayar\u0101\u015bi first skillfully demonstrates\nthat the universal cannot exist by mentioning three possible\nconclusions: If (T) the universal exists, then (C1) the\nuniversal is different from the individuals in which it is\ninstantiated, (C2) it is not different from the\nindividuals, or (C3) it is different from the individuals\nin some aspects and it is not different from the individuals in other\naspects. Each of these options is then analysed into further options,\nall being eventually shown as wrong or impossible. Since all the three\nconclusions C1, C2 and C3 are\nrejected, the initial thesis T (\u2018the universal exists\u2019) is\nalso rejected. However, he does not say what at all exists, if there\nare no universals.\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not mention all logically\nconceivable conclusions entailed by a thesis he wants to disprove. In\nmost cases, he limits himself just to those implications which are\nrelevant to the discussion with a particular philosophical school, and\nall other logical or thinkable implications of which we know that the\nopponent would never admit for a variety of reason are simply\nignored.\n\nInterestingly, the critical method of analysis of the reductio type\n(prasa\u1e45ga) which Jayar\u0101\u015bi so amply uses is basically\nabsent in the works of the Digambara philosopher Akala\u1e45ka,\nwhereas the method is regularly used by his commentator\nVidy\u0101nanda and all subsequent Jaina thinkers, which may have its\nhistorical relevance and suggest that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was posterior\nto Akala\u1e45ka.\n\nThe reductionist tactics, which Jayar\u0101\u015bi shared with the\nM\u0101dhyamika Buddhists, was traditionally classified by Brahmanic\nphilosophers, e.g. the Naiy\u0101yikas, as an eristical dispute or\nrefutation-only debate (vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101) and considered as a\nnon-genuine argument, because the goal of an authentic debate was to\nstrive for truth, understood of course in positive terms. Were such\ncriticisms denying Jayar\u0101\u015bi a genuine argumentative value\njustified? Clearly not, and for a variety of reasons, the most\nimportant being that the main objective of Jayar\u0101\u015bi is\nindicated in the title of his treatise: the dissolution of all\ncategories. How should we understand it? Was his approach purely\nnegative, eristical, nihilistic or agnostic? His main objective, it\nseems, was not necessarily the strong claim that no truths can ever be\nknown. Rather his intention was to show the fundamental dependence of\nour knowledge of reality on cognitive means and categories we accept\nmore or less arbitrarily. The dissolution of all categories implies\nthat the criteria on which all philosophical systems and theories of\nthe world rest are in need of further evidence, which itself is not\npossible without adopting some of these categories or some other\ncategories which again call for further evidence, but which categories\nand methods we chose is ultimately our arbitrary decision. To engage\nin what Brahmanic philosophers would call a \u2018genuine\ndebate\u2019 (v\u0101da) one would necessarily have to accept that\nsuch an arbitrary decision is ultimate and justified, thus giving up\nthe further search for truth, even though the process would be\ninfinite and doomed to terminate untimely. In other words,\ncontradictions and inconsistencies are, in fact, inherently systemic\nin the sense that they are generated by a body of propositions each\nadopted arbitrary for this or other reason, and the systemic knowledge\nultimately lacks reliable and coherent foundations. Just as with\nPyrrhonism in Sextus\u2019 interpretation, Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to be a\nperpetual investigator: he discards all theories and propositions that\nare neither consistent nor proof-tight, for which there is also no\ncompelling evidence. But it would probably be far-fetched to claim\nthat the idea of truth did not represent any value for him.\n2.2 Scepticism and Definitions\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi may be arguably claimed to represent what has been\nonce labelled epistemological scepticism, or ontological scepticism\n(Hankinson 1995, 13ff), i.e., the position in which one refuses to\naccept the truth of some proposition or to affirm the existence of\nsomething, without denying it, as distinguished from negative\n(ontological) dogmatism, i.e., the attitude in which one actually\nrejects the truth of some proposition and denies the existence of the\nalleged objects. Further, Jayara\u015bi\u2019s qualified methodological\nscepticism should not be confused with what is covered by the term\ne.g. in the case of Descartes\u2019 approach to seek ultimately firm\nfoundations after all beliefs liable to doubt have been successfully\neliminated. Jayar\u0101\u015bi seeks neither ultimate foundations for\nhis system or firm basis for his epistemology, ontology or ethics,\nbecause he never, even vaguely, intimates he would have any. He is\nsatisfied with demonstrating that all we, the philosophers, have so\nfar established, does not hold. But contrary to Descartes\u2019\nmethodological scepticism, Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not really cast\ndoubt on what comes to us from the senses.\n\nAt the outset of his work (TUS 1), he points out the major deficiency\nof our knowledge: \u2018To establish cognitive criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a, instruments of knowledge) depends on proper\ndefinitions. Further, to establish objects of cognitive criteria\ndepends on cognitive criteria. When proper definitions are absent, how\nis it possible that one would treat both the cognitive criteria and\ntheir objects as genuinely real?\u2019 To adopt certain definitions\nwe first have to adopt certain definitions and criteria of validity.\nThat has to be done vis-\u00e0-vis the external reality and tested\nfor validity with respect to phenomena that have all the appearance of\nreal, for Indian philosophers en bloc accepted the correspondence\ntheory of truth. To test the definitions, criteria of validity and\ncognitive criteria with respect to real objects, we should first know\nwhat these real objects really are. To know that we have to have\nreliable instruments of knowledge (cognitive criteria) and criteria of\nvalidity at our disposal. We land in vicious circle: we can neither\nknow cognizable real objects nor determine what genuine cognitive\ncriteria are, nor be actually able to define them without having the\nidea of validity first. Without it we cannot even properly distinguish\nbetween valid cognitive procedures and invalid ones.\n\nSince it is vital to have a proper definition of a cognitive\ncriterion, or a valid cognitive procedure and criterion of truth for\nphilosophical enterprise, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses such definitions\nwhich were formulated within most important philosophical schools in\nIndia. The cognitive criteria whose various definitions are one by one\nexamined are perception (pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\npresumption (arth\u0101patti), reasoning based on analogy\n(upam\u0101na), negative proof based on absence (abh\u0101va),\nequivalence (sambh\u0101va), tradition (aitihya), and verbal or\nscriptural testimony (\u015babda, \u0101gama). In terms of\nargumentative structure and nature, they all can be reduced to three:\nperception, inference and testimony. The philosophical schools which\nJayar\u0101\u015bi most frequently refers to and criticises their\ndefinitions of the cognitive criteria are the Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika, S\u0101\u1e41khya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101\nas well as Buddhist and Jaina schools.\n\nHe demonstrates that no one so far has offered an irrefutable\ndefinition of perception (which does not have to mean that perception\nas such has to be completely unreliable). All definitions of\nperception are seriously flawed and we cannot rely on it in the way it\nis defined: we do not have even a reliable method or a dependable\ncriterion to distinguish a genuine perception from a mirage, optical\nillusion or a mental image (e.g. in hallucination, reminiscence or\ndream). However, Iit is not the case that Jayar\u0101\u015bi argues\nthat \u2018there is simply no way \u2026 to know that our\nsense-perceptions are true\u2019 (King 1999: 19). What he is up to is\nto demonstrate that, given our present definitions of perception and\ncategories on which our epistemology rests, there is no way to\ndetermine which of our sense-perceptions are true.\n\nWhat is considered inference (anum\u0101na) relies on data provided by\nperception which makes inference doubtful. But inference the way it\nhas so far been defined is flawed for a number of other reasons. There\nis no reliable way to relate properties or facts in a truth-conducive\nway. For instance, to infer the cause from the effect one would have\nto first define what causality is, which as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\ndemonstrates cannot be done with the categories we have at our\ndisposal: there is actually no reliable way to relate A and B as cause\nand effect. Further, what do we relate in inference: universals with\nuniversals, universals with a particular, or a particular with a\nparticular? Since universals do not exist, inferences which are based\non such notions are intrinsically flawed. We are left with the idea\nthat inferences depend on particular-to-particular relation. That\nbeing the case, there is no method to establish any kind of valid\nrelationship of universal\u00a0 character between two particulars\nwhich could allow us to draw any sound inferences from\nsingle-instantiated cases. Further, inferences will have to rely on\ncases of inductive reasoning which are logically not valid and cannot\nbe demonstrated to be universally valid. Also testimony of an\nauthority cannot be a legitimate source of knowledge because, first,\nsuch testimony would have to rely on other cognitive criteria and,\nsecond, we would have no means to determine what a reliable testimony\nis or who an authoritative person can be. Therefore, given all\navailable definitions and criteria\u00a0admitted by the tradition,\nnothing can be known for certain (Balcerowicz (2019:\n918\u2013\u00ad924)).\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s undertaking is not restricted to the examination\nof valid cognitive procedures, or cognitive criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) and their definitions. In the course of his work,\nhe analyses a number of fundamental ideas and demonstrates that their\ndefinitions are inadequate and they cannot exist as understood and\ndefined by philosophers. These include such notions as validity and\nnonerroneousness, sublation of previous knowledge by a subsequent\nexperience, universals, the relation of composite wholes to their\nparts, production of cognitions, ontological categories such as\ninherence of properties in their substrata, the nature of illusion,\nthe definition of what exists (e.g. the real object\u2019s ability to\nexecute causally efficient action, artha-kriy\u0101), the nature of\nsense-object contact, memory and recollection, momentariness and\npermanence, conceptuality or conceptual state of mind, relation of the\nconceptual image in cognition to the external thing represented, the\nnature of consciousness (rejection of non-material character), rebirth\nand karmic retribution, causality, visible and invisible objects,\nabsences, rules of inference etc. All these ideas, as\nJayar\u0101\u015bi demonstrates, stand in need of proper definition\nand as long as we do not have them cannot be maintained in their\npresent form.\n\nImportantly, as a recent publication demonstrates, he strictly applies\nfundamental principles of logic, including a range of standard,\nclassical laws of logic, such as: the law of non-contradiction, the\nlaw of excluded middle,\u00a0 the law of identity,\u00a0 De\nMorgan\u2019s laws,\u00a0 Leibniz\u2019s law (the indiscernibility\nof identicals), and other basic axioms of logic, including patterns of\na priori reasoning whose validity is solely determined by their\nlogical form and structure, and not necessarily by their empirical\nrelevance or validation through empirical observation. At least on one\noccasion he also makes use of the fourfold division of logically\npossible alternatives of p, i.e. the tetralemma\n(catu\u1e63-ko\u1e6di) in an argument directed against the Buddhists\n(who themselves accept the tetralemma as a standard procedure):\np, ~p, p\u2227~p, ~(p\u2227~p)\n(Balcerowicz (2019: 924\u2013931). He also takes the conclusions\nderived from premisses through such reasoning based on logic\nprinciples and range of rules (formulated as laws of logic) as valid.\nErgo, he accepts inference \u2013\u00a0but not anum\u0101na \u2013\nas legitimate means of arriving at truth, and these consistently\nremain beyond his criticism. This analysis sheds important light on\nthe nature of his criticism of what was traditionally accepted in\nclassical India as \u2018inference\u2019 (anum\u0101na), which is\ndeficient for two main reasons: its definitions formulated by\nphilosophers are faulty, and its validity is rooted in empirical\nconditions. Indian anum\u0101na is just a sub-theory of logic and\nshould be understood as inference in a qualified sense and of a\nnarrower scope, applied to empirically relevant claims, based on\nempirically observed regularities and advancing arguments involving\nthe problem of induction; anum\u0101na completely excludes deduction\nand all varieties of a priori reasoning and analytic judgements. What\nis termed anum\u0101na should therefore be called \u2018disputational\ninference\u2019 or \u2018debational inference\u2019, in view of its\norigins in the context of debate. We can observe that\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s case does not present that of a genuine\nsceptic who would put to doubt the possibility of arriving at truth\nper se and would point to fundamental impossibility to know facts. His\napproach is not scepticism, which questions the epistemic principles\nhe himself also employs. Instead, with the logical apparatus that\nrests in one domain the validity of which he takes for granted,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi finds fault with another, quite different domain:\nthat of the principles of traditional Indian epistemological and\nlogical model, rooted in reasonings which are based on empirical\nobservation and are not a priori (Balcerowicz (2019:\n931\u2013943).\n2.3 Positive Views\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, as we noted, is cautious not to affirmatively\nstate anything, and nowhere does he use such expressions as\n\u2018thus it was established that\u2019 (iti sthitam) or similar\nexpressions typical of all other philosophical works. Despite this,\ncan we reconstruct any positive views he affirms or is his scepticism\nall-embracing? It seems there a few such views. His clear rejection of\nkarmic retribution, afterlife and the supernatural (\u2018human\nactions do no bring otherworldly results, such as rebirth in heaven\netc.\u2019) and the claim the ultimate reality for us is what we\nexperience and what surrounds us concerns both metaphysics and ethics.\nMetaphysically, there is no supernatural reality of any relevance to\nus. Ethically, the only criterion to determine what is right and wrong\nis what people agree to accept as such (\u2018the worldly path should\nbe followed\u2019). Quite frequently, he uses examples of\nnon-existent entities such as demons (pi\u015b\u0101ca), atoms\n(param\u00e2\u1e47u) and god (mah\u00ea\u015bvara), taking their\nfictitious character for granted, which indicates that he apparently\nrejected invisible reality which is intrinsically beyond our\nsenses.\n\nA recent publication enumerates altogether more than a dozen such\npositive views that can be possibly reconstructed and ascribed to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi (Balcerowicz (2020: 599\u2013600)). On one\noccasion (in the Buddhist section, TUP, p.57\u201388 = Franco (1987:\n269\u2013271) = Solomon (2010: 120) = Jha (2013: 228\u2013229)),\nwhile refuting the view that \u2018the first moment of consciousness\n[of the newly born], immediately after the exit from the mother\u2019s\nwomb, is preceded by another moment of consciousness\u2019, he\nconcludes that \u2018the first moment of consciousness in the womb\netc. [i.e., of the newly born], must come from the combination of the\nelements\u2019, which is a typically materialist view. He further\ntakes consciousness to be a product of matter; rejects the existence\nof the soul or any kind of conscious entity that might exist\nindependently of the material body, and all that is supernatural and\nimperceptible, such as demons (pi\u015baca), atoms\n(param\u00e2\u1e47u) or god (mah\u00ea\u015bvara); dismisses\nafterlife, transmigration, karmic retribution (karman), virtue\n(pu\u1e47ya) or vice (p\u0101pa); denies heavens, hells, liberation,\nomniscient beings and omniscience; rejects ritualism and and the\npurposefulness of religious cult, religious revelation, religious\nauthority (\u0101pta), the concept of righteousness (dharma);\ndismisses the validity of the pram\u0101\u1e47a model of\nepistemology, but accepts the validity of direct experience\n(anubhava).\n\nHe plainly states that \u2018universals do not exist\u2019 (TUP, 4.5\nff.), which does not seem to be a mere thesis which he rejects just\nfor the sake of argument, because throughout his work he will refer to\nthis claim (\u2018we have already shown that universals do not\nexist\u2019). He is a nominalist in accepting only particulars which\nfor him are external, macroscopic, non-momentary and material objects.\nOn another occasion (TUS 24) he criticises the view that composite\nmacroscopic wholes cannot exist, and what exists instead are their\nparts only (a typical Buddhist nominalist position). He concludes\nthere is no way to demonstrate that composite wholes are non-existent.\nInterestingly, he nowhere links the idea of composite wholes (and the\nparadox of the whole and its parts), which he seems to accept, to idea\nthe universal (and the paradox of the universal and the particulars as\nits instantiations), which he clearly rejects. These two concepts, the\nwholes and universals, were generally analysed in India jointly as two\naspects of the same problem: just as the whole exists (or does not\nexist) through its parts, in the very same way also the universal\nexists (or does not exist) through its particulars. Interestingly,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi never links these two issues, precisely because, it\nseems, he admitted the existence of macroscopic objects of our\nexperience (i.e., composite wholes) whereas he rejected the existence\nof universals. Being a sceptic, he does seem to accept a\n\u2018commonsensical view\u2019 of the world that consists of such\nmacroscopic objects, but not of invisible atoms or universals, demons\nand god. In line with this approach, he seemed also to maintain that\nconsciousness is a product or combination of the four elements (see\nabove). It should not come as a surprise to discover that all these\nviews he shared with genuine materialists of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata tradition.\n\nWhat may appear as a truly sceptical thesis is his assumption that all\nphilosophical claims are always made within a particular set of\nbeliefs, i.e., within a particular system which is based on\narbitrarily accepted criteria, definitions and categories. His\npragmatic, \u2018commonsensical attitude\u2019 is highlighted in a\nverse he quotes: \u2018with respect to everyday practice of the\nworld, the fool and the wise are similar\u2019 (see above), because\nultimately we all have to rely on our experience and defective and\npartial knowledge of reality.\n\nThe conclusion of his work: \u2018Thus, when all categories are\ncompletely dissolved in the above manner, all practical actions (which\nentails thought, speech and activity) can be enjoyable, without being\nreflected upon\u2019, is quite meaningful. On the one hand it could\nbe taken to imply some kind of a carpe diem attitude: given our\nlimitations and intrinsic inability to know with certainty, the only\noption we are left with is to enjoy the world the way it appears to\nus. On the other hand, the statement could also suggest that what\nJayar\u0101\u015bi had in mind was that for all our practical\nactivities, including thinking, verbal communication, behaviour or\nordinary life, the world of our actions \u2014 as long as it is\nrelevant to us \u2014 is \u2018here and now\u2019 and retains its\nultimate validity, even though we are incapable of its proper\nphilosophical analysis.\n",
