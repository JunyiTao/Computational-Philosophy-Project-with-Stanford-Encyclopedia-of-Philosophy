    "main_text": "\n\nReflection on perfect goodness is most commonly carried out as part of\nthe project of philosophical theology. One prominent methodological\nstrand of philosophical theology is perfect being theology,\nin which the nature of God is made more explicit by identifying God as\nan absolutely perfect being and working out what features an\nabsolutely perfect being must exhibit (Morris 1989c; Rogers 2000;\nNagasawa 2008). As it is a commonplace that one of the perfections\nthat would have to be exhibited by any being that would qualify as\nabsolutely perfect is perfect goodness, it is obvious why\nphilosophical theologians employing perfect being theology would be\nmotivated to reflect in some detail on the character of perfect\ngoodness and to consider various challenges to the very idea.\n\nThis article will take for granted the importance of situating\nreflection on perfect goodness within philosophical theology. But it\nshould be noted that one need not proceed in this way. One might\ninstead attempt to reflect on the character of perfect goodness in a\nway that entirely abstracts from theological concerns, or indeed any\nconcerns about the particular being by whom, or by which, perfect\ngoodness is realized (McGinn 1992; Conee 1994). But typically such\nreflection focuses specifically on perfect goodness as realized in\nGod, a being that exhibits not only perfect goodness, but every\nother perfection as well. One might also wonder whether there is any\nsuch thing as a general standard for perfect goodness; perhaps perfect\ngoodness is kind-relative, such that there is nothing that privileges\nthe question of what counts as perfect goodness for God over the\nquestion of what counts as perfect goodness for humans, or angels, or\nMartians, or any other particular type of rational being. (Indeed, one\nmight go further, asking why we should privilege the goodness of\nrational beings over that of hedgehogs, movies, or landscapes.) But\nthis article will take the perfect goodness of God as privileged, and\nwill treat as a crucial difficulty for some conception of perfect\ngoodness that it cannot be exemplified with other features that an\nabsolutely perfect being would have to exemplify.\n",
