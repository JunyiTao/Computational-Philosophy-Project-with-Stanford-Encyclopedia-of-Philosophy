    "main_text": "Political Forgiveness\n8. Political Forgiveness\n\nThe power of pardon enjoyed by duly established political authorities\nmay be at best a loose cognate of forgiveness, but this is not to say\nthat all legal or political analogues to forgiveness are implausible\n(for discussion see MacLachlan 2012, cf. Norlock & Veltman 2009). P.E. Digeser (2001) has argued\nin favor of a conception of political forgiveness that breaks sharply\nwith the standard philosophical accounts of forgiveness as involving\nthe overcoming of resentment or other negative emotional states by\nvictims of wrong. Instead, Digeser seeks to divest political\nforgiveness of any personal feelings whatsoever in favor of a\nperformative account in which such overt behaviors as pardoning a\ncriminal or waiving a debt signify forgiveness. Digeser claims that\nseparating the action of forgiving from its underlying motive and from\nthe constellation of feelings often thought to accompany interpersonal\nforgiveness better suits a conception of justice as one in which\npeople get their due. On this performative conception, forgiveness\nconsists in political actors or institutions opting not to get their\ndue, for whatever reasons.\n\nDigeser claims to have created a serviceable political notion of\nforgiveness shorn of its usual psychological baggage. And surely, as\nnoted earlier, there is a sense of forgiveness in which an action such\nas waiving a debt or an utterance such as \u201cI forgive you\u201d\nis sometimes all that forgiveness is about. To this extent and in this\nsense, debt forgiveness and political pardons may reasonably be\nregarded as political forms of forgiving, and Digeser identifies four\nforms such political forgiveness may take (2001: 9). First, political\nforgiveness takes a many-to-one form when a group forgives an\nindividual. Suppose, for example, the American people could forgive\nformer President Clinton for lying to a grand jury, or that a\nuniversity community could forgive a dean who embezzled funds. Second,\nwe can recognize one-to-many political forgiveness, whereby\nan individual forgives a group. One can imagine, for example,\nexonerated prisoners forgiving police forces or the justice system for\nwrongly arresting or convicting them (for even if no single member of\nthe police or justice system wronged the exonerated prisoner, their\njoint action may have done so). Third, in many-to-many\npolitical forgiveness, groups or collectives enter into forgiveness\nrelations with other groups or collectives. Examples may include the\naforementioned cases of U.S.-Japan and Tutsi-Hutu relations. Finally,\none-to-one political forgiveness involves individuals\nforgiving other individuals. President Gerald Ford, for example,\nfamously issued an executive pardon to former President Richard Nixon\nafter his resignation amidst charges that he broke the law.\n\nThe past thirty or so years have seen a rapid increase on the part of\npolitical leaders apologizing for and seeking reconciliation between\nperpetrators and victims of moral atrocities. The ostensible aim of\nsuch efforts has not only been to rectify past wrongs and give those\nwho have been wronged their due, but to heal deep and sometimes\nlongstanding wounds caused by such wrongs as well. The South African\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in the mid 1990s is probably\nthe best-known example of such attempts to achieve reconciliation\nbetween perpetrators and victims of intra-national collective wrongs\n(Tutu 1999). Other instances of political apology, aimed in part at\neffecting some form of forgiveness or reconciliation, include\nAustralia\u2019s \u201csorry book\u201d, which records\ncitizens\u2019 remorse over a former government policy mandating the\nforced removal of aboriginal children from their natural parents in\nthe name of cultural assimilation, President Clinton\u2019s apology\nto African Americans and subsequent proposals by scholars and\npolicy-makers of reparations for slavery, and Northern Ireland\u2019s\n1998 Good Friday Agreement and the peace process initiated thereby\n(Brooks 2004; Biggar 2008). Understanding forgiveness as roughly\nsynonymous with reconciliation supports the notion that these\ncollective endeavors are institutional forms of forgiveness (Radzik\n2009).\n",
