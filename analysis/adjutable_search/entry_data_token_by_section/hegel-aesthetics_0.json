    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Knowledge of Art\n1. Hegel\u2019s Knowledge of Art\n\n\nHegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) contains\nchapters on the ancient Greek \u201creligion of art\u201d\n(Kunstreligion) and on the world-view presented in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone and Oedipus the King. His\nphilosophy of art proper, however, forms part of his\nphilosophy (rather than phenomenology) of spirit. The\nPhenomenology can be regarded as the introduction to\nHegel\u2019s philosophical system. The system itself comprises three\nparts: logic, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit, and is\nset out (in numbered paragraphs) in Hegel\u2019s Encyclopaedia of\nthe philosophical Sciences (1817, 1827, 1830). The philosophy of\nspirit is in turn divided into three sections: on subjective, objective\nand absolute spirit. Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art or\n\u201caesthetics\u201d constitutes the first sub-section of his\nphilosophy of absolute spirit, and is followed by his philosophy of\nreligion and his account of the history of philosophy.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art provides an a priori derivation\u2014from\nthe very concept of beauty itself\u2014of various forms of beauty and\nvarious individual arts. In marked contrast to Kant, however, Hegel\nweaves into his philosophical study of beauty numerous references to\nand analyses of individual works of art\u2014to such an extent,\nindeed, that his aesthetics constitutes, in Kai Hammermeister\u2019s words,\n\u201ca veritable world history of art\u201d (Hammermeister,\n24).\n\n\nHegel read both Greek and Latin (indeed, he wrote his diary partly in\nLatin from the age of fourteen); he also read English and French. He\nwas thus able to study the works of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles,\nEuripides, Virgil, Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re in the original\nlanguages. He never travelled to Greece or Italy, but he did undertake\nseveral long journeys from Berlin (where he was appointed Professor in\n1818) to Dresden (1820, 1821, 1824), the Low Countries (1822, 1827),\nVienna (1824) and Paris (1827). On these journeys he saw\nRaphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna and several paintings by\nCorreggio (in Dresden), Rembrandt\u2019s Night Watch (in\nAmsterdam), the central section of the van Eyck brothers\u2019\nAdoration of the Lamb (in Ghent)\u2014the wing panels were\nat that time in Berlin\u2014and \u201cfamous items by the noblest\nmasters one has seen a hundred times in copper engravings: Raphael,\nCorreggio, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian\u201d (in Paris) (Hegel: The\nLetters, 654). He liked to visit the theatre and opera, both\non his travels and in Berlin, and he was acquainted with leading\nsingers, such as Anna Milder-Hauptmann (who sang in the first\nproduction of Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio in 1814), as well as the\ncomposer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (whose revival of\nJ.S. Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion Hegel attended in March\n1829). Hegel was also on close personal terms with Goethe and knew his\ndrama and poetry especially well (as he did those of Friedrich\nSchiller).\n\n\nAdorno complains that \u201cHegel and Kant [ \u2026 ] were able to\nwrite major aesthetics without understanding anything about art\u201d\n(Adorno, 334). This may or may not be true of Kant, but it is clearly\nquite untrue of Hegel: he had an extensive knowledge and a good\nunderstanding of many of the great works of art in the Western\ntradition. Nor was Hegel\u2019s knowledge and interest restricted to\nWestern art: he read (in translation) works of Indian and Persian\npoetry, and he saw at first hand works of Egyptian art in Berlin\n(P\u00f6ggeler 1981, 206\u20138). Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art is\nthus an a priori derivation of the various forms of beauty that,\npace Adorno, is informed and mediated by a thorough knowledge\nand understanding of individual works of art from around the world.\n",
