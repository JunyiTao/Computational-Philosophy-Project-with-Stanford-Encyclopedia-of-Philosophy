Greeley had published\n\u201cThe Great Lawsuit\u201d in the Tribune and had\npersuaded Fuller to expand it into a book. His wife Mary had attended\nFuller\u2019s \u201cConversations\u201d and had prompted him to\nhire her (Capper 2007: 165). The Tribune provided Fuller with\na huge audience. Greeley and his paper belonged to the Whig political\nparty, which had formed in opposition to Andrew Jackson and criticized\nhis policies, including \u201cIndian Removal\u201d of tribes to west\nof the Mississippi. Fuller had travelled through Chicago and the\nMidwest earlier in the year and had become publicly critical of white\ntreatment of the Indians. She shared Greeley\u2019s opposition to\nslavery and praised Frederick Douglass. Greeley\u2019s\nTribune embraced many reform causes of the time. Fuller had\ncome to view women\u2019s rights as part of a broad need for social\nreform, evident in her compassion for the women in prison whom she\nvisited. Most of them had been convicted of prostitution, though the\nmen involved were never prosecuted. \n\nIn Congress, Timothy Fuller had strongly supported John Quincy\nAdams\u2019s presidential campaign, opposed the Missouri Compromise, and\ndefended the rights of Native Americans.  His daughter and pupil\ninvoked the sixth President\u2019s attitude toward the female sex in\nWoman in the Nineteenth Century (Fuller 1845: 77\u201378).\nWhen the Whig Party took shape in the 1830s, both Adams and Margaret\nFuller identified with it. Though women could not vote, Fuller saw the\nWhigs as her party of choice. \u201cI attended last week\u201d, she\nwrote to Emerson on 14 August 1837, \u201cthe Whig Caucus here\u201d\n(meaning Providence, Rhode Island). \u201cIt is rather the best thing\nI have done\u201d (Fuller, Letters, ed. Hudspeth 1983: I,\n295; for more on her Whig politics, see Letters, IV, 121).\nActually, the Whig Party was a bit more sympathetic to women\u2019s\nrights than the Democratic Party, probably because the cause of women\nwas a predominantly middle-class movement prior to the Nineteenth\nAmendment, and the Whigs were a middle-class party. The Whigs were\nalso the party of both evangelical and Unitarian Protestantism, which\nin those days provided the principal base of support for many reform\nmovements, including antislavery, temperance, public schools, higher\neducation, international peace, prison reform (which promoted\n\u201cpenitentiaries\u201d rather than simply punishment like\nflogging), the American Bible Society (which fostered literacy), and\nasylums for the insane, as well as women\u2019s liberation. Though\nUnitarians did not share the theology of the evangelical\ndenominations, they often shared common social and political aims.\n\nIn 1846 Fuller went to Europe and become a foreign correspondent for\nthe New York Tribune, writing about European literature and\npublic opinion. European travel was expensive, and it was not clear\nthat Greeley was willing to reimburse Fuller\u2019s costs\nsufficiently. Fortunately, a wealthy and politically enlightened\nQuaker couple, Marcus and Rebecca Spring, were friends of Fuller,\ndecided to spend some time in Europe, and offered to pay for some of\nher expenses if she would travel with them and tutor their young son\nEddie. \n\nFuller began touring in England and Scotland with the Springs, sending\narticles back to Greeley\u2019s Tribune. She met interesting\npeople there, including the elderly poet Wordsworth and Harriet\nMartineau, the English feminist who had earlier criticized her for\nshunning reforms other than feminism. Now that Fuller had embraced a\nmuch wider reform agenda, the two got along. London harbored an\nintellectual curiosity of the time, Thomas Carlyle, who rejected the\nCalvinist Christianity of his youth, celebrated German Romanticism,\nand knew many smart women, one of whom was his wife Jane. When Fuller\nand Carlyle met, mutual admiration ensued. But always with serious\nreservations. Carlyle\u2019s politics were very different from\nFuller\u2019s. He rejected democracy, endorsed antisemitism and white\nracism, and celebrated populist, nationalist historic leaders like\nOliver Cromwell and Frederick the Great. (Generations later some Nazis\nwould look back on Carlyle as a precursor.) Another Romantic whom\nFuller met in London would arouse her more uncritical admiration:\nGiuseppi Mazzini, the heroic Italian revolutionary. Mazzini embraced\nliberal democracy and personal fulfillment as aspects of his Italian\nrepublican nationalism. Fuller welcomed the chance to speak in an\nevent at a free elementary school for poor Italian expatriate boys,\nwhere she endorsed Mazzini\u2019s revolutionary cause and invoked the\nprinciple of self-improvement through public education so popular with\nAmerican Unitarians and Whig reformers. Mazzini loved it.\n\nFuller went on to France, where she confirmed that Paris was indeed\nthe cultural capital of the world; she enjoyed the music and fine arts\nthere as well as the literature and philosophy she was accustomed to\nengaging. She contrived to meet the woman who had adopted the pen name\nGeorge Sand and become one the most popular and successful writers in\nall Europe, along with her current lover, Frederic Chopin. More\nsignificant politically was her relationship with Adam Mickiewicz, the\nexiled Polish Romantic poet-turned- revolutionary, striving to achieve\nPolish independence from Russia and Austria. Fuller had admired him\neven before they met in France. His social democracy appealed to her\nand so did his Romantic religious passion. It seemed like the two of\nthem might form a bond both sexually romantic and philosophically\nRomantic\u2014but Mickiewicz was already married. Fuller moved on to\nthe Italian peninsula.\n\nMargaret Fuller\u2019s time in Italy proved politically climactic.\nShe embraced simultaneously the Italian language, in which she became\nfluent, and the revolutionary struggle for Italian unity and\ndemocracy. Now back in touch with Giuseppe Mazzini on his home turf,\nshe eagerly supported his cause: transforming Rome into a democratic\nrepublic. When the new Pope Pius IX temporarily seemed supportive, she\napproved but (perceptively) remained cautious. When forced to choose,\nthe Pope disavowed Mazzini, and Fuller denounced the Pope. As\nrevolutionary movements spread around Europe in 1848, Fuller was\nconsistently enthusiastic. She kept her American audience informed\nabout the European revolutions, explaining that America should no\nlonger imagine itself to be the model Europe should imitate. She had\nbecome impatient with middle-class moderates and endorsed socialism.\nBy now she was even further to the Left than Mazzini. Meanwhile,\nFuller\u2019s time in Italy was proving climactic personally as well\nas politically. She met the younger Giovanni Angelo Ossoli. Together\nthey had a child and their probable marriage is a point of discussion\nin the literature. \n\nMargaret Fuller\u2019s grand international political project was not\nrealized. The Roman revolution for which she and her husband fought\nproved a lost cause, and they had to flee to Florence. Her attempted\nreturn to the United States with her new family ended in disaster (as\nrelated above in Section 1 above). But Margaret Fuller\u2019s\nultimate vision of a world where people are free and empowered,\nregardless of gender, race, or class, has remained a noble and\ninspiring vision.\n",
