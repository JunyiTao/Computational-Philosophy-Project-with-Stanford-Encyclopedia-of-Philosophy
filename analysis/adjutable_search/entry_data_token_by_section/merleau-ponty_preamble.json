    "main_text": "\n\nMaurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961), French\nphilosopher and public intellectual, was the leading academic\nproponent of existentialism and phenomenology in post-war France. Best\nknown for his original and influential work on embodiment, perception,\nand ontology, he also made important contributions to the philosophy\nof art, history, language, nature, and politics. Associated in his\nearly years with the existentialist movement through his friendship\nwith Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty played a\ncentral role in the dissemination of phenomenology, which he sought to\nintegrate with Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and\nSaussurian linguistics. Major influences on his thinking include Henri\nBergson, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and Jean-Paul\nSartre, as well as neurologist Kurt Goldstein, Gestalt theorists such\nas Wolfgang K\u00f6hler and Kurt Koffka, and literary figures\nincluding Marcel Proust, Paul Claudel, and Paul Val\u00e9ry. In\nturn, he influenced the post-structuralist generation of French\nthinkers who succeeded him, including Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,\nand Jacques Derrida, whose similarities with and debt to the later\nMerleau-Ponty have often been underestimated. Merleau-Ponty published\ntwo major theoretical texts during his lifetime: The Structure of\nBehavior (1942 SC) and Phenomenology of Perception (1945\nPP). Other important publications include two volumes of political\nphilosophy, Humanism and Terror (1947 HT) and Adventures\nof the Dialectic (1955 AdD), as well as two books of collected\nessays on art, philosophy, and politics: Sense and Non-Sense\n([1948]1996b/1964) and Signs (1960/1964). Two unfinished\nmanuscripts appeared posthumously: The Prose of the World\n(1969/1973), drafted in 1950\u201351; and The Visible and the\nInvisible (1964 V&I), on which he was working at the time of\nhis death. Lecture notes and student transcriptions of many of his\ncourses at the University of Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the\nColl\u00e8ge de France have been published, as well as a number of\npreviously unpublished manuscript fragments, lectures, working notes,\ntranscriptions of recordings, and letters.\n\nFor most of his career, Merleau-Ponty focused on the problems of\nperception and embodiment as a starting point for clarifying the\nrelation between the mind and the body, the objective world and the\nexperienced world, expression in language and art, history, politics,\nand nature. Although phenomenology provided the overarching framework\nfor these investigations, Merleau-Ponty also drew freely on empirical\nresearch in psychology and ethology, anthropology, psychoanalysis,\nlinguistics, and the arts. His constant points of historical reference\nare Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Marx. The characteristic approach of\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s theoretical work is his effort to identify an\nalternative to intellectualism or idealism, on the one hand, and\nempiricism or realism, on the other, by critiquing their common\npresupposition of a ready-made world and failure to account for the\nhistorical and embodied character of experience. In his later\nwritings, Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly critical of the\nintellectualist tendencies of the phenomenological method as well,\nalthough with the intention of reforming rather than abandoning it.\nThe posthumous writings collected in The Visible and the\nInvisible aim to clarify the ontological implications of a\nphenomenology that would self-critically account for its own\nlimitations. This leads him to propose concepts such as\n\u201cflesh\u201d and \u201cchiasm\u201d that many consider to be\nhis most fruitful philosophical contributions.\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s thought has continued to inspire contemporary\nresearch beyond the usual intellectual history and interpretive\nscholarship, especially in the areas of feminist philosophy,\nphilosophy of mind and cognitive science, environmental philosophy and\nphilosophy of nature, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of art,\nphilosophy of language, and phenomenological ontology. The emerging\ndiscourse of \u201ccritical phenomenology,\u201d in particular, has\nexplored what Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought can contribute to\nunderstanding and responding to racism, sexism, heteronormativity,\ncolonialism, ableism, ageism, and other contemporary forms of violence\nand oppression. His work has also been widely influential on\nresearchers outside the discipline of philosophy proper, especially in\nanthropology, architecture, the arts, cognitive science, environmental\ntheory, film studies, linguistics, literature, political theory, and\npsychopathology.\n",
