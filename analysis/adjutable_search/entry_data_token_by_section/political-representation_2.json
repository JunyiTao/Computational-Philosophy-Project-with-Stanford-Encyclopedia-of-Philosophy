    "main_text": "Key Components of Political Representation || Pitkin\u2019s Four Views of Representation\n1.2 Pitkin\u2019s Four Views of Representation\n\nPitkin offers one of the most comprehensive discussions of the concept\nof political representation, attending to its contradictory character\nin her The Concept of Representation. This classic discussion\nof the concept of representation is one of the most influential and\noft-cited works in the literature on political representation. (For a\ndiscussion of her influence, see Dovi 2016). Adopting a\nWittgensteinian approach to language, Pitkin maintains that in order\nto understand the concept of political representation, one must\nconsider the different ways in which the term is used. Each of these\ndifferent uses of the term provides a different view of the concept.\nPitkin compares the concept of representation to \u201c a rather\ncomplicated, convoluted, three\u2013dimensional structure in the\nmiddle of a dark enclosure.\u201d Political theorists provide\n\u201cflash-bulb photographs of the structure taken from different\nangles\u201d [1967, 10]. More specifically, political theorists have\nprovided four main views of the concept of representation.\nUnfortunately, Pitkin never explains how these different views of\npolitical representation fit together. At times, she implies that the\nconcept of representation is unified. At other times, she emphasizes\nthe conflicts between these different views, e.g. how descriptive\nrepresentation is opposed to accountability. Drawing on her flash-bulb\nmetaphor, Pitkin argues that one must know the context in which the\nconcept of representation is placed in order to determine its meaning.\nFor Pitkin, the contemporary usage of the term\n\u201crepresentation\u201d can signficantly change its meaning.\n\nFor Pitkin, disagreements about representation can be partially\nreconciled by clarifying which view of representation is being\ninvoked. Pitkin identifies at least four different views of\nrepresentation: formalistic representation, descriptive\nrepresentation, symbolic representation, and substantive\nrepresentation. (For a brief description of each of these views, see\nchart below.) Each view provides a different approach for examining\nrepresentation. The different views of representation can also provide\ndifferent standards for assessing representatives. So disagreements\nabout what representatives ought to be doing are aggravated by the\nfact that people adopt the wrong view of representation or misapply\nthe standards of representation. Pitkin has in many ways set the terms\nof contemporary discussions about representation by providing this\nschematic overview of the concept of political representation.\n\n1. Formalistic Representation:\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The institutional arrangements\nthat precede and initiate representation. Formal representation has\ntwo dimensions: authorization and accountability.\n\n\nMain Research Question. What is the institutional\nposition of a representative?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nNone.\n\n\n(Authorization):\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The means by which a\nrepresentative obtains his or her standing, status, position or\noffice.\n\n\nMain Research Questions. What is the process by which\na representative gains power (e.g., elections) and what are the ways\nin which a representative can enforce his or her decisions?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives. No\nstandards for assessing how well a representative behaves. One can\nmerely assess whether a representative legitimately holds his or her\nposition.\n\n\n\n(Accountability):\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The ability of constituents to\npunish their representative for failing to act in accordance\nwith their wishes (e.g. voting an elected official out of office) or\nthe responsiveness of the representative to the\nconstituents.\n\n\nMain Research Question. What are the sanctioning\nmechanisms available to constituents? Is the representative responsive\ntowards his or her constituents\u2019 preferences?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives. No\nstandards for assessing how well a representative behaves. One can\nmerely determine whether a representative can be sanctioned or has\nbeen responsive.\n\n 2. Symbolic Representation:\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The ways that a representative\n\u201cstands for\u201d the represented \u2014 that is, the meaning\nthat a representative has for those being represented.\n\n\nMain Research Question. What kind of response is\ninvoked by the representative in those being represented?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nRepresentatives are assessed by the degree of acceptance that the\nrepresentative has among the represented.\n 3. Descriptive Representation:\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The extent to which a\nrepresentative resembles those being represented.\n\n\nMain Research Question. Does the representative look\nlike, have common interests with, or share certain experiences with\nthe represented?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nAssess the representative by the accuracy of the resemblance between\nthe representative and the represented.\n 4. Substantive Representation:\n\n\n\n\nBrief Description. The activity of\nrepresentatives\u2014that is, the actions taken on behalf of, in the\ninterest of, as an agent of, and as a substitute for the\nrepresented.\n\n\nMain Research Question. Does the representative\nadvance the policy preferences that serve the interests of the\nrepresented?\n\n\nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nAssess a representative by the extent to which policy outcomes\nadvanced by a representative serve \u201cthe best interests\u201d of\ntheir constituents.\n\n\n\nOne cannot overestimate the extent to which Pitkin has shaped\ncontemporary understandings of political representation, especially\namong political scientists. For example, her claim that descriptive\nrepresentation opposes accountability is often the starting point for\ncontemporary discussions about whether marginalized groups need\nrepresentatives from their groups.\n\nSimilarly, Pitkin\u2019s conclusions about the paradoxical nature of\npolitical representation support the tendency among contemporary\ntheorists and political scientists to focus on formal procedures of\nauthorization and accountability (formalistic representation). In\nparticular, there has been a lot of theoretical attention paid to the\nproper design of representative institutions (e.g. Amy 1996; Barber,\n2001; Christiano 1996; Guinier 1994). This focus is certainly\nunderstandable, since one way to resolve the disputes about what\nrepresentatives should be doing is to \u201clet the people\ndecide.\u201d In other words, establishing fair procedures for\nreconciling conflicts provides democratic citizens one way to settle\nconflicts about the proper behavior of representatives. In this way,\ntheoretical discussions of political representation tend to depict\npolitical representation as primarily a principal-agent relationship.\nThe emphasis on elections also explains why discussions about the\nconcept of political representation frequently collapse into\ndiscussions of democracy. Political representation is understood as a\nway of 1) establishing the legitimacy of democratic institutions and\n2) creating institutional incentives for governments to be responsive\nto citizens.\n\nDavid Plotke (1997) has noted that this emphasis on mechanisms of\nauthorization and accountability was especially useful in the context\nof the Cold War. For this understanding of political representation\n(specifically, its demarcation from participatory democracy) was\nuseful for distinguishing Western democracies from Communist\ncountries. Those political systems that held competitive elections\nwere considered to be democratic (Schumpeter 1976). Plotke questions\nwhether such a distinction continues to be useful. Plotke recommends\nthat we broaden the scope of our understanding of political\nrepresentation to encompass interest representation and thereby return\nto debating what is the proper activity of representatives.\nPlotke\u2019s insight into why traditional understandings of\npolitical representation resonated prior to the end of the Cold War\nsuggests that modern understandings of political representation are to\nsome extent contingent on political realities. For this reason, those\nwho attempt to define political representation should recognize how\nchanging political realities can affect contemporary understandings of\npolitical representation. Again, following Pitkin, ideas about\npolitical representation appear contingent on existing political\npractices of representation. Our understandings of representation are\ninextricably shaped by the manner in which people are currently being\nrepresented.
