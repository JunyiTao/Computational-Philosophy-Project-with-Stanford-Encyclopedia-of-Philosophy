    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nDutch artist M.C. Escher\u2019s elegant pictorial paradoxes are\nprized by many, not least by philosophers, physicists, and\nmathematicians. Some of his work, for example Ascending and\nDescending, relies on optical illusion to depict what is actually\nan impossible situation. Other works are paradoxical in the broad\nsense, but not impossible: Relativity depicts a\ncoherent arrangement of objects, albeit an arrangement in which the\nforce of gravity operates in an unfamiliar fashion. (See the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below for images.) Quantum gravity itself may be like this:\nan unfamiliar yet coherent arrangement of familiar elements. Or it may\nbe more like Ascending and Descending, an impossible\nconstruction which looks sensible in its local details but does not\nfit together into a coherent whole when using presently existing\nbuilding materials. If the latter is true, then the construction of a\nquantum theory of gravity may demand entirely unfamiliar elements.\nWhatever the final outcome, the situation at present is one of flux,\nwith a great many competing approaches vying for the prize. However,\nit is also important to note that the prize is not always the same:\nstring theorists seek a unified theory of all four interactions that\nhas the power of explaining such things as the numbers of generations\nof elementary particles and other previous inexplicable properties.\nOther approaches are more modest, and seek only to bring general\nrelativity in line with quantum theory, without necessarily invoking\nthe other interactions. Hence, the problem of quantum gravity\ncan mean very different things to different researchers and what\nconstitutes a possible solution to one group might not qualify as such\nto another.\n\nGiven that quantum gravity does not yet exist as a working physical\ntheory, one might legitimately question whether philosophers have any\nbusiness being involved at this stage. Certainly the\nphilosopher\u2019s task will be somewhat different from that faced\nwhen dealing with a more-or-less settled body of theory such as\nclassical Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, or quantum\nmechanics. In such cases, one typically proceeds by assuming the\nphysical soundness of the theory or theoretical framework and drawing\nout the ontological and perhaps epistemological consequences of the\ntheory, trying to understand what it is that the theory is telling us\nabout the nature of space, time, matter, causation, and so on.\nTheories of quantum gravity, on the other hand, are bedeviled by a\nhost of technical and conceptual problems, questions, and issues that\nmake them largely unsuited to this kind of interpretive approach. In\nthe case of string theory, there isn\u2019t even really a\n\u2018theory\u2019 to speak of, so much as several clues pointing to\nwhat many hope will some day be an applicable, consistent physical\ntheory. However, philosophers who have a taste for a broader and more\nopen-ended form of inquiry will find much to think about, and it is\nentirely possible that future philosophers of physics will be faced\nwith problems of a very different flavour as a result of the peculiar\nnature of quantum gravity. Indeed, Tian Cao argues that quantum\ngravity offers up a unique opportunity for philosophers of\nphysics, leaving them \u201cwith a good chance to make some positive\ncontributions, rather than just analysing philosophically what\nphysicists have already established\u201d (Cao, 2001, p. 138). This\nsentiment has in fact been echoed by several physicists, not least by\nCarlo Rovelli (a central architect of the approach known as loop\nquantum gravity), who complains that he wishes philosophers would not\nrestrict themselves to \u201ccommenting and polishing the present\nfragmentary physical theories, but would take the risk of trying to\nlook ahead\u201d (Rovelli, 1997, p. 182). This raises an\nimportant point: though we think of general relativity and quantum\ntheory as \u2018nice\u2019 theories from the point of view of\nphilosophical investigation, in a very real sense they are not the\nwhole story and break down at extreme scales. \n",
