    "main_text": "Newton's Life\n1. Newton's Life\n\n\nNewton's life naturally divides into four parts: the years before he\nentered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1661; his years in Cambridge\nbefore the Principia was published in 1687; a period of almost\na decade immediately following this publication, marked by the renown\nit brought him and his increasing disenchantment with Cambridge; and\nhis final three decades in London, for most of which he was Master of\nthe Mint. While he remained intellectually active during his\nyears in London, his legendary advances date almost entirely from his\nyears in Cambridge. Nevertheless, save for his optical papers of\nthe early 1670s and the first edition of the Principia, all\nhis works published before he died fell within his years in\n London.[1]\n",
