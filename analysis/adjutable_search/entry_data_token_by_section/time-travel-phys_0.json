    "main_text": "Paradoxes Lost?\n1. Paradoxes Lost?\n\nModern physics strips away many aspects of the manifest image of time.\nTime as it appears in the equations of classical mechanics has no need\nfor a distinguished present moment, for example. Relativity theory\nleads to even sharper contrasts. It replaces absolute simultaneity,\naccording to which it is possible to unambiguously determine the time\norder of distant events, with relative simultaneity: extending an\n\u201cinstant of time\u201d throughout space is not unique, but\ndepends on the state of motion of an observer. More dramatically, in\ngeneral relativity the mathematical properties of time (or better, of\nspacetime)\u2014its topology and geometry\u2014depend upon how\nmatter is arranged rather than being fixed once and for all. So\nphysics can be, and indeed has to be, formulated without treating time\nas a universal, fixed background structure. Since general relativity\nrepresents gravity through spacetime geometry, the allowed geometries\nmust be as varied as the ways in which matter can be arranged.\nAlongside geometrical models used to describe the solar system, black\nholes, and much else, the scope of variation extends to include some\nexotic structures unlike anything astrophysicists have observed. In\nparticular, there are spacetime geometries with curves that loop back\non themselves: closed timelike curves (CTCs), which describe the\npossible trajectory of an observer who returns exactly back to their\nearlier state\u2014without any funny business, such as going faster\nthan the speed of light. These geometries satisfy the relevant\nphysical laws, the equations of general relativity, and in that sense\ntime travel is physically possible.\n\nYet circular time generates paradoxes, familiar from science fiction\nstories featuring time\n travel:[1]\n\nConsistency: Kurt plans to murder his own grandfather\nAdolph, by traveling along a CTC to an appropriate moment in the past.\nHe is an able marksman, and waits until he has a clear shot at\ngrandpa. Normally he would not miss. Yet if he succeeds, there is no\nway that he will then exist to plan and carry out the mission. Kurt\npulls the trigger: what can happen?\nUnderdetermination: Suppose that Kurt first travels back\nin order to give his earlier self a copy of How to Build a Time\nMachine. This is the same book that allows him to build a time\nmachine, which he then carries with him on his journey to the past.\nWho wrote the book?\nEasy Knowledge: A fan of classical music enhances their\ncomputer with a circuit that exploits a CTC. This machine efficiently\nsolves problems at a higher level of computational complexity than\nconventional computers, leading (among other things) to finding the\nsmallest circuits that can generate Bach\u2019s oeuvre\u2014and to\ncompose new pieces in the same style. Such easy knowledge is at odds\nwith our understanding of our epistemic predicament. (This third\nparadox has not drawn as much attention.)\n\n\nThe first two paradoxes were once routinely taken to show that\nsolutions with CTCs should be rejected\u2014with charges varying from\nviolating logic, to being \u201cphysically unreasonable\u201d, to\nundermining the notion of free will. Closer analysis of the paradoxes\nhas largely reversed this consensus. Physicists have discovered many\nsolutions with CTCs and have explored their properties in pursuing\nfoundational questions, such as whether physics is compatible with the\nidea of objective temporal passage (starting with G\u00f6del 1949).\nPhilosophers have also used time travel scenarios to probe questions\nabout, among other things, causation, modality, free will, and\nidentity (see, e.g., Earman 1972 and\u00a0Lewis\u2019s seminal 1976\npaper).\n\nWe begin below with Consistency, turning to the other\nparadoxes in later sections. A standard, stone-walling response is to\ninsist that the past cannot be changed, as a matter of logic, even by\na time traveler (e.g., G\u00f6del 1949,\u00a0Clarke 1977, Horwich\n1987). Adolph cannot both die and survive, as a matter of logic, so\nany scheme to alter the past must fail. In many of the best time\ntravel fictions, the actions of a time traveler are constrained in\nnovel and unexpected ways. Attempts to change the past fail, and they\nfail, often tragically, in just such a way that they set the stage for\nthe time traveler\u2019s self-defeating journey. The first question\nis whether there is an analog of the consistent story when it comes to\nphysics in the presence of CTCs. As we will see, there is a remarkable\ngeneral argument establishing the existence of consistent solutions.\nYet a second question persists: why can\u2019t time-traveling Kurt\nkill his own grandfather? Doesn\u2019t the necessity of failures to\nchange the past put unusual and unexpected constraints on time\ntravelers, or objects that move along CTCs? The same argument shows\nthat there are in fact no constraints imposed by the existence of\nCTCs, in some cases. After discussing this line of argument, we will\nturn to the palatability and further implications of such constraints\nif they are required, and then turn to the implications of quantum\nmechanics.\n",
