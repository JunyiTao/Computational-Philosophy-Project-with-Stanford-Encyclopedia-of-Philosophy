Indeed, some have suggested that the deep\nsource of the self-torturer\u2019s problem, and what prompts his\nintransitive preferences, is that his goal of avoiding extreme pain is\nvague in the sense that, in the situation described, avoiding extreme\npain requires engaging in a multitude of goal-directed actions that\nare not individually necessary or sufficient for the achievement of\nthe goal and that are thus dispensable and perhaps even dominated if\nconsidered individually (Tenenbaum and Raffman, 2012). It may be\nhelpful to consider a more familiar example of a vague goal or\nproject, such as that of writing a good book. As Sergio Tenenbaum and\nDiana Raffman explain, this project may be characterizable as follows\n(2012, 99\u2013100):\n\nIts completion requires the successful execution of many momentary\nactions.\nFor each momentary action in which you execute the project,\nfailure to execute that action would not have prevented you from\nwriting the book.\nOn many occasions when you execute the project, there is something\nelse that you would prefer to be doing, given how unlikely it is that\nexecuting the project at this time would make a difference to the\nsuccess of your writing the book.\nHad you failed to execute the project every time you would have\npreferred to be doing something else, you would not have written the\nbook.\nYou prefer executing the project at every momentary choice\nsituation in which you could work on the project, over not writing the\nbook at all.\n\n\nIt is not difficult to see how, in a case like this, seemingly\nrational \u201clocal\u201d decisions can lead one off course.\n\nTenenbaum and Raffman\u2019s discussion of the pursuit of vague goals\nis interestingly related to Luca Ferrero\u2019s suggestion that many\nactivities are \u201cmade up of momentary actions that relate in\nnon-local ways that span over the entire length of the\nactivities\u201d and \u201crequire the agent\u2019s continuous\nappreciation of the structure and outcome of the extended activities\ntaken as a whole\u201d (2009, 406). Ferrero focuses on activities\nthat have a narrative dimension, in that \u201cthe unfolding of the\ncharacteristic temporal structure of \u2026[the] activities can be\nfully and perspicuously described solely by a narrative\u201d\n(412\u20133), but the pursuit of vague goals also seems to fit\nFerrero\u2019s initial description, as well as his idea that\nactivities of the relevant sort involve the \u201cparadigmatic\noperation\u201d of the \u201cdiachronic will\u201d (406). In all\nsuch activities, relentless guidance by \u201cproximal\nconcerns\u201d interferes with what is required by \u201cthe\nactivity\u2019s global structure\u201d (406).\n",
