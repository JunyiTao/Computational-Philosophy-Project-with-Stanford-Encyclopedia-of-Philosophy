Life and Work\n\nFranz Brentano was born on January 16, 1838 in Marienberg am Rhein,\nGermany, a descendent of a strongly religious German-Italian family of\nintellectuals (his uncle Clemens Brentano and his aunt Bettina von\nArnim were among the most important writers of German Romanticism and\nhis brother Lujo Brentano became a leading expert in social\neconomics). He studied mathematics, poetry, philosophy, and theology\nin Munich, W\u00fcrzburg, and Berlin. Already at high school he became\nacquainted with Scholasticism; at university he studied Aristotle with\nTrendelenburg in Berlin, and read Comte as well as the British\nEmpiricists (mainly John Stuart Mill), all of whom had a great\ninfluence on his work. Brentano received his Ph.D. from the University\nof T\u00fcbingen in 1862, with his thesis On the Several Senses of\nBeing in Aristotle.\n\nAfter graduation Brentano prepared to take his vows; he was ordained a\nCatholic priest in 1864. Nevertheless he continued his academic career\nat the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he presented his\nHabilitationsschrift on The Psychology of Aristotle\nin 1867. Despite reservations in the faculty about his priesthood he\neventually became full professor in 1873. During this period, however,\nBrentano struggled more and more with the official doctrine of the\nCatholic Church, especially with the dogma of papal infallibility,\npromulgated at the first Vatican Council in 1870. Shortly after his\npromotion at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Brentano withdrew from\nthe priesthood and from his position as professor.\n\nAfter his Habilitation, Brentano had started to work on a\nlarge scale work on the foundations of psychology, which he entitled\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint. The first volume was\npublished in 1874, a second volume (The Classification of Mental\nPhenomena) followed in 1911, and fragments of the third volume\n(Sensory and Noetic Consciousness) were published\nposthumously by Oskar Kraus in 1928.\n\nShortly after the publication of the first volume, Brentano took a job\nas a full professor at the University of Vienna, where he continued a\nsuccessful teaching career. During his tenure in Vienna, Brentano, who\nwas very critical towards his own writing, did not pursue his plans to\ncomplete and publish the second and third volumes of his\nPsychology, but preferred to publish shorter texts, most of\nwhich were based on manuscripts for public lectures. The topics range\nfrom aesthetics (Das Genie [The Genius], Das Schlechte\nals Gegenstand dichterischer Darstellung [Evil as Object of\nPoetic Representation]) and issues in historiography to The Origin\nof the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, in which Brentano laid out\nhis views on ethics. The latter was Brentano\u2019s first book to be\ntranslated into English in 1902. \n\nWhen in 1880 Brentano and Ida von Lieben decided to wed, they had to\nconfront the fact that the prevailing law in the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire denied matrimony to persons who had been ordained priests\n\u2013 even if they later had resigned from priesthood. They\nsurmounted this obstacle by temporarily moving to and becoming\ncitizens of Saxony, where they finally got married. This was possible\nonly by temporarily giving up the Austrian citizenship and, in\nconsequence, the job as full professor at the University. When\nBrentano came back to Vienna a few months later, the Austrian\nauthorities did not reassign him his position. Brentano became\nPrivatdozent, a status that allowed him to go on teaching\n\u2013 but did not entitle him to receive a salary or to supervise\ntheses. For several years he tried in vain to get his position back.\nIn 1895, after the death of his wife, he left Austria disappointed; at\nthis occasion, he published a series of three articles in the Viennese\nnewspaper Die neue freie Presse entitled Meine letzen\nW\u00fcnsche f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich [My Last Wishes for\nAustria] (which soon afterwards appeared as a self-standing book), in\nwhich he outlined his philosophical position as well as his approach\nto psychology, but also harshly criticized the legal situation of\nformer priests in Austria. In 1896 he settled down in Florence where\nhe got married to Emilie Ruprecht in 1897.\n\nBrentano has often been described as an extraordinarily charismatic\nteacher. Throughout his life he influenced a great number of students,\nmany of who became important philosophers and psychologists in their\nown rights, such as Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von\nEhrenfels, Anton Marty, Carl Stumpf, Kasimir Twardowski, as well as\nSigmund Freud. Many of his students became professors in different\nparts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Marty and Ehrenfels in Prague,\nMeinong in Graz, and Twardowski in Lvov (now Lviv), and so spread\nBrentanianism over the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire, which explains\nthe central role of Brentano in the philosophical development in\ncentral Europe, especially in what was later called the Austrian\nTradition in philosophy.\n\nBrentano always emphasized that he meant to teach his students to\nthink critically and in a scientific manner, without holding\nprejudices and paying undue respect to philosophical schools or\ntraditions. When former students of his took a critical approach to\nhis own work, however, when they criticized some of his doctrines and\nmodified others to adapt them for their own goals, Brentano reacted\nbitterly. He often refused to discuss criticism, ignored improvements,\nand thus became more and more isolated, a development that was\nreinforced by his increasing blindness.\n\nDue to these eye-problems Brentano could not read or write any longer,\nbut had his wife read to him and dictated his work to her.\nNonetheless, he produced a number of books in his years in Florence.\nIn 1907 he published Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie, a\ncollection of shorter texts on psychology. In 1911 he presented not\nonly the second volume of his Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint, but also two books on Aristotle: in Aristotle and\nhis World View he provides an outline and interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. In Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung\ndes menschlichen Geistes Brentano continues a debate with Zeller.\nThis debate had started already in the 1860s, when Brentano criticized\nZeller\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle in his Psychology of\nAristotle and became quite intense and aggressive in the\nseventies and eighties of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen Italy entered war against Germany and Austria during World War I,\nBrentano, who felt himself a citizen of all three countries, moved\nfrom Florence to neutral Switzerland. He passed away in Zurich on\nMarch 17, 1917.\n\nBrentano left a huge number of unpublished manuscripts, including\npoetry and letters on a wide range of philosophical topics in his last\ndomicile in Z\u00fcrich and in his summer-residence in\nSch\u00f6nb\u00fchel bei Melk; some manuscripts were probably left\nbehind in Florence. After his death, Alfred Kastil and Oskar Kraus, who\nwere students of Brentano\u2019s former student Anton Marty in\nPrague, worked on the Nachlass, transferring a good part of it\nto Innsbruck. Their attempt to set up a Brentano-archive was supported\nby Tomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano who had become founder\nand first President (from 1918 to 1935) of the Republic of\nCzechoslovakia. As a result, in 1932 many of the original manuscripts\nwere moved to Prague where an archive was founded. Alas, due to the\npolitical turbulences that were to came over central Europe the\nproject made it necessary to transfer the archive again. Substantial\nparts of the Nachlass were transferred to different places in\nthe United States, some of it has later been brought back to Europe,\nespecially to the Brentano-Forschungsstelle at the University of Graz,\nAustria, and the Brentano family archive in Blonay, Switzerland. (For\na detailed history of Brentano\u2019s Nachlass, cf. Binder\n(2013)). \n\nKastil and Kraus did succeed, however, to begin to publish\nposthumously some of the lecture notes, letters, and drafts he had\nleft. They tried to present Brentano\u2019s work as best as they\ncould, putting together various texts to what they thought were\nrounded, convincing works, sometimes following questionable editorial\ncriteria. Their work was continued by other, more careful editors, but\nhas by far not yet been completed: a much needed critical edition of\nhis complete \u0153uvre is still to be waited for.\n2. Philosophy as a Rigorous Science and the Rise of Scientific Psychology\n\nA central principle of Brentano\u2019s philosophy, which should\nbecome widely accepted among Brentano\u2019s students, was that\nphilosophy should be done in a rigorous, scientific manner. Already\nearly in his career, in the public defense of his\nHabilitation in 1866, he stated 25 theses, the fourth of\nwhich reads: \u201cThe true method of philosophy is that of natural\nscience.\u201d (contained in: ZP, 136, my translation)\n[\u201cVerae philosophiae methodus nihil alia est nisi scientiae\nnaturarum\u201d]. Brentano, thus, opposed the idea that there\nwas a unique method for philosophy and denied that there was a\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d that could unveil genuinely\nphilosophical truths and thus play a privileged or foundational role\nin the overall system of the sciences. According to Brentano,\nphilosophy\u2014and in particular philosophical\npsychology\u2014should apply a method that is based on observation,\ndescription of facts, and induction; just like the (other) natural\nsciences.\n\nIt has been suggested that Brentano\u2019s fourth\nHabilitations-thesis makes him an advocate of a particular\nversion of the unity of the sciences, according to which there is a\nunity of method (cf. Haller 1993, 27) and that it stands in contrast\nto \u201cDilthey\u2019s view according to which the so-called\nGeisteswissenschaften or human or moral sciences would\nsomehow call for a special method of \u2018understanding\u2019 or\nVerstehen, as opposed to the \u2018explanation\u2019 of the\nnatural sciences.\u201d (Smith 1994, 31). One has to be cautious not\nto overstate this point, though. While it is true that Brentano uses\nboth the terms \u201cmethod\u201d [methodus] and\n\u201cnatural science\u201d [scientiae naturarum] in the\nsingular, there is strong evidence that he had a minimal understanding\nof what this method should exactly consist in. He never suggested that\nall scientific disciplines could be reduced to other, more basic\ndisciplines, nor did he argue that all natural sciences should apply\nexactly the same method, nor that mathematization or the use of a\nformal language was indispensable for scientificity. For Brentano, a\nmethod counts as scientific as long as it fulfills the minimal\nrequirements of applying observation, description of facts, and\ninduction. The specific methodological procedures applied in a given\nscientific discipline depend first and foremost on the objects\nstudied:\n\n\u201cNatural science, thus, requires in no way [...] that we should\nproceed everywhere in the same manner and in the way we do in the\nsimplest cases of mechanics. On the contrary, it teaches and instructs\nus to change our procedure [Verfahren] in accordance with the\nparticular nature of the objects\u201d (ZP, 35, my\ntranslation).\n\n[\u201cDie Naturwissenschaft verlangt also keineswegs, [...]\nda\u00df wir \u00fcberall gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und so, wie in den\neinfachsten F\u00e4llen der Mechanik vorgehen sollen. Im Gegenteil,\nsie unterweist uns und \u00fcbt uns darauf ein, der besonderen Natur\nder Gegenst\u00e4nde entsprechend unser Verfahren zu\n\u00e4ndern\u201d]\n\n\nRegarding formal methods he states: \u201cMathematical analysis,\nwhich is the main means of scientific progress in some areas of\nnatural science, does not play nearly any role at all in\nothers.\u201d (ZK 35, my translation) [\u201cDie\nmathematische Analyse, die auf manchem Gebiet der Naturwissenschaft\ndas haupts\u00e4chliche Mittel des Fortschritt ist, spielt darum\nbekanntlich auf anderen so gut wie gar keine Rolle.\u201d]\nBrentano has never made an attempt to introduce formal or mathematical\nmethods in philosophy or psychology. On the contrary, he criticized\nJohann Friedrich Herbart\u2019s attempts to mathematize psychology,\npointing out that Herbart\u2019s mathematical deductions lack\nempirical foundation and therefore lose contact to the actual\nphenomena (cf. LW, 36). In another place where he discusses\nHerbart\u2019s position, he states: \u201cAlas, many believed that\nwhere there is so much mathematical rigour, there must be exact\nscience\u201d (GA, 53f, my translation). [\u201cLeider\nmeinten viele, wo so viel mathematische Strenge zu finden sei,\nm\u00fcsse exakte Wissenschaft gegeben sein.\u201d] For\nBrentano, any rigorous, scientific method had to be appropriate for\nthe observed phenomena; his position, thus, is closer to classical\nempiricism and positivism than to the logical positivism as it was\ndeveloped in Vienna a decade after his death.\n\nBrentano\u2019s views concerning the right method in philosophy was\nof particular importance to his contributions to psychology, as\nalready the title of his main work, Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint suggests. Also there he argued that the right\nprocedure consisted in observing and describing the relevant phenomena\nand establishing the general laws on the basis of induction. The\nparticularity of Brentano\u2019s method lies in the fact that\npsychology is based mainly on observation that is performed from a\nfirst person point of view. The psychologist draws on the intimate\nknowledge concerning her own current mental phenomena that she gains\nthrough inner perception (which, as we shall see below, is to be\ndistinguished from inner observation). Brentano does not suggest,\nhowever, that these descriptions are infallible: as it is impossible\nto live and describe a particular experience at the same time, all\ndescriptions of mental phenomena have to rely on memory and inner\nobservation.\n\n\u201cIf the attempt to observe the anger which stirs us becomes\nimpossible because the phenomenon disappears, it is clear that an\nearlier state of excitement can no longer be interfered in this way.\nAnd we really can focus our attention on a past mental phenomenon just\nas we can upon a present physical phenomenon, and in this way we can,\nso to speak, observe it.\u201d (PES, 26).\n\n[\u201cWenn der Versuch, den Zorn, der uns bewegt, beobachtend zu\nverfolgen, durch Aufhebung des Ph\u00e4nomens unm\u00f6glich wird, so\nkann dagegen ein Zustand fr\u00fcherer Aufregung offenbar keine\nSt\u00f6rung mehr erleiden. Auch gelingt es wirklich, dem vergangenen\npsychischen Ph\u00e4nomen so wie einem gegenw\u00e4rtigen physischen\nmit Aufmerksamkeit sich zuzuwenden, und es in dieser Weise sozusagen\nbeobachten.\u201d (PES, 49)]\n\n\nMoreover, as inner perception and memory as sources of experience are\nlimited to one\u2019s own mental life, they have to be complemented\nwith the \u201cindirect knowledge of the mental phenomena of\nothers\u201d [\u201cindirekte Erkenntnis fremder psychischer\nPh\u00e4nomene\u201d], which we can gain on the basis of the manifest\nbehavior we can observe in others, including their verbal behavior,\ni.e., when \u201ca person describes them directly in words.\u201d\n(PES 28) [\u201cjemand geradezu in Worten sie\nbeschreibt\u201d] (PES 53). \n\nBrentano\u2019s approach, like that of other introspectionist\npsychologists of the late nineteenth century, was harshly criticized\nwith the rise of scientific psychology in the tradition of logical\npositivism, especially by behaviorists, who argue that empirical\npsychology must not make use of introspection, but only of data that\ncan be obtained by the observation of the manifest behaviour of human\nbeings from a third-person point of view. This should not obscure the\nfact that Brentano did play a crucial role in the process of\npsychology becoming an independent science. He distinguished between\ngenetic and empirical or, as he called it,\ndescriptive psychology, a distinction that is most explicitly\ndrawn in lecture notes form the mid-1880s that have been published in\nDescriptive Psychology (DP). Genetic psychology\nstudies psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view. It\ninvolves the use of experiments and thus satisfies the scientific\nstandards we nowadays expect of an empirical science. Even though\nBrentano never conducted psychological experiments in laboratories, he\nvery actively supported the installation of the first laboratories for\nexperimental psychology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2013 a goal\nthat was achieved by his student Alexius Meinong in Graz. Descriptive\npsychology (to which Brentano sometimes also referred\nas\u00a0\u201cphenomenology\u201d (cf. DP 137)) aims at\ndescribing consciousness from a first-person point of view. Its goal\nis to list \u201cfully the basic components out of which everything\ninternally perceived by humans is composed, and \u2026 [to\nenumerate] the ways in which these components can be connected\u201d\n(DP 4). Brentano\u2019s distinction between genetic and\ndescriptive psychology strongly influenced Husserl\u2019s development\nof the phenomenological method, especially in its early phases. But\nalready then Brentano could not approve of Husserl\u2019s development\nfor it involved the intuition of abstract essences, the existence of\nwhich Brentano denied. With his so-called \u201ctranscendental\nturn\u201d in the mid of the first decade of the twentieth century,\nHusserl alienated himself more and more from the Brentanian roots of\nthe phenomenological method.\n3. Brentano\u2019s Theory of Mind\n\nBrentano\u2019s main goal was to lay the basis for a scientific\npsychology, which he defines as\u00a0\u201cthe science of mental\nphenomena\u201d (PES, 14) [\u201cWissenschaft von den\npsychischen Erscheinungen\u201d]. In order to give flesh to this\ndefinition of the discipline, he provides a more detailed\ncharacterization of mental phenomena. He proposes six criteria to\ndistinguish mental from physical phenomena (PES 61\u201377),\nthe most important of which are: (i) mental phenomena are the\nexclusive object of inner perception, (ii) they always appear\nas a unity, and (iii) they are always intentionally directed\ntowards an object. (The other three criteria are: psychological\nphenomena \u2013 and only those \u2013 are presentations or\nphenomena based upon presentations; they seem to have no spatial\nextension; and have not only intentional, but also actual existence.)\nI will discuss the first two criteria in the next sub-section, and the\nthird in a separate sub-section below. \n3.1 Inner Perception, Unity of Consciousness and the Tripartition of Mental Phenomena\n\nAll mental phenomena have in common, Brentano argues, \u201cthat they\nare only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of\nphysical phenomena only external perception is possible\u201d\n(PES, 70) [\u201cda\u00df sie nur in innerem\nBewu\u00dftsein wahrgenommen werden, w\u00e4hrend bei den physischen\nnur \u00e4u\u00dfere Wahrnehmung m\u00f6glich ist.\u201d\n(PES 128)]. According to Brentano, the former of these two\nforms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is\ntrue. Since the German word for perception (Wahrnehmung),\nliterally translated, means \u201ctaking-true\u201d, Brentano says\nthat it is the only kind of perception in a strict sense. He points\nout that inner perception must not be mixed up with inner observation,\nwhich would require that one is having a mental act, the act of\nobserving, that is directed towards another mental act, the act\nobserved. Inner perception, on the other hand, must not be conceived\nas a full-fledged act that accompanies another mental act towards\nwhich it is directed. It is rather interwoven with the latter: in\naddition to being primarily directed towards an object, every mental\nact is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary\nobject. When I see a tree, for example, the primary object of my\nvisual experience is the tree. But I am also aware that I am\nseeing and not, say, hearing or touching the tree; I am, in\nother words, aware of the fact that I have a mental phenomenon that is\ndirected towards the tree. This is possible because one and the same\nmental phenomenon, my visual experience, is directed not only towards\nits primary object, the tree, it is incidentally directed\nalso towards itself as a secondary object. \n\n\u201cThe presentation of the sound and the presentation of the\npresentation of the sound form one single mental phenomenon; it is\nonly by considering it in its relation to two different objects, one\nof which is a physical phenomenon and the other a mental phenomenon,\nthat we divide it conceptually into two presentations. In the same\nmental phenomenon in which the sound is present to our minds we\nsimultaneously apprehend the mental phenomenon itself. What is more,\nwe apprehend it in accordance with its dual nature insofar as it has\nthe sound as content within it, and insofar as it has itself as\ncontent at the same time.\u201d (PES, 98)\n\n[\u201cDie Vorstellung des Tones und die Vorstellung von der\nVorstellung des Tones bilden nicht mehr als ein einziges psychisches\nPh\u00e4nomen, das wir nur, indem wir es in seiner Beziehung auf zwei\nverschiedene Objekte, deren eines ein physisches, und deren anderes\nein psychisches Ph\u00e4nomen ist, betrachten, begrifflich in zwei\nVorstellungen zergliederten. In demselben psychischen Ph\u00e4nomen,\nin welchem der Ton vorgestellt wird, erfassen wir zugleich das\npsychische Ph\u00e4nomen selbst, und zwar nach seiner doppelten\nEigent\u00fcmlichkeit, insofern es als Inhalt den Ton in sich hat, und\ninsofern es zugleich sich selbst als Inhalt gegenw\u00e4rtig\nist.\u201d (PES, 179)]\n\n\nAccording to Brentano, every mental phenomenon is directed\ntowards itself as a secondary object; inner perception is, thus, a\nform of mechanism on the basis of which we become aware of our own\nmental phenomena.\n\nAs a consequence, Brentano denies the idea that there could be\nunconscious mental acts: since every mental act is\nincidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object, we are\nautomatically aware of every occurring mental act. He admits, however,\nthat we can have mental acts of various degrees of intensity. In\naddition, he holds that the degree of intensity with which the object\nis presented is equal to the degree of intensity in which the\nsecondary object, i.e., the act itself, is presented. Consequently, if\nwe have a mental act of a very low intensity, our inner perception of\nthe act or, as he puts it, our secondary consciousness of it will also\nhave a very low intensity. From this Brentano concludes that sometimes\nwe are inclined to say that we had an unconscious mental phenomenon\nwhen actually we had a conscious mental phenomenon of very low\nintensity.\n\nConsciousness, Brentano argues, always forms a unity. While we can\nperceive a number of physical phenomena at one and the same time, we\ncan only perceive one mental phenomenon at a specific point in time.\nWhen we seem to have more than one mental act at a time, like when we\nare listening to a melody while tasting a sip of red wine and enjoying\nthe beautiful view from the window, all these mental phenomena melt\ninto one, they become moments or, to stick with Brentano\u2019s\nterminology, divisives of a collective. If one of the divisives ends\nin the course of time, e.g., when I swallow the wine and turn my eyes\nto the fireplace, but continue to listen to the music, the collective\ngoes on to exist. Brentano\u2019s views on the unity of consciousness\nentail that inner observation, as explained above, is strictly\nimpossible, for this would require us to have two distinct acts in the\nvery same moment. Of course it is possible to remember\nanother mental act one had a moment ago, or expect future mental acts,\nbut due to the unity of consciousness one cannot have two distinct\nmental acts, one of which being directed towards the other, at the\nsame time.\n\nThe fact that we can be directed towards one and the same object in\ndifferent ways allows Brentano to introduce a classification of mental\nphenomena. He distinguishes three basic kinds: presentations,\njudgments, and emotions (which he refers to as \u201cphenomena of\nlove and hate\u201d). These are not three completely distinct\nclasses, though. Presentations are the most basic kind of acts; we\nhave a presentation each time when we are directed towards an object,\nbe it that we are imagining, seeing, remembering, or expecting it,\netc. In his Psychology Brentano held that two presentations\ncan differ only in the object, towards which they are directed. Later\nhe modified his position, though, and argued that they can also differ\nin various modes, such as temporal modes (cf. PES 217 [This\ntext is part of the appendix to the second part of PES from\n1911 \u2013 for the German original cf. PES, vol II, 142]). The two\nother categories, judgments and phenomena of love and hate, are based\non presentations. In a judgment we accept or deny the existence of the\npresented object. A judgment, thus, is a presentation plus a\nqualitative mode of acceptance or denial. The third category, which\nBrentano names\u00a0\u201cphenomena of love and hate,\u201d\ncomprises emotions, feelings, desires and acts of will. In these acts\nwe have positive or negative feelings or attitudes towards an object.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s tripartition of mental phenomena is a basic element\nof his theory that remained central for his whole life. The fact that\nhe saw himself constrained to make minor adjustments shows that\nBrentano did approach philosophy in a very systematic manner and\nalways had the bigger picture in mind. It can, thus, be taken as\nevidence that \u201cin his mind Brentano was continuously refining\nand chiseling away at a unified system, a system that harmonized and\nstabilized the bits and pieces in his messy literary state\u201d\n(Kriegel 2017a, 29). \n\nMoreover, his conception of secondary consciousness, in combination\nwith this thesis of the unity of consciousness have had a strong echo\nin the philosophy of mind, in particular in the recent debate\nconcerning the nature of consciousness. It has been suggested that\nBrentano\u2019s notion of secondary consciousness (i.e., the thesis\nthat every mental phenomenon is incidentally directed also towards\nitself as a secondary object) can provide the means to overcome\nhigher-order theories of consciousness that have been widely discussed\nin the late twentieth century. In this debate, the exact reading of\nBrentano\u2019s thesis was often at stake. Some philosophers have\nsuggested that Brentano\u2019s view, according to which every mental\nphenomenon is object of inner perception, was an early expression of a\nhigher-order perception theory of consciousness (cf., for example,\nG\u00fczeldere 1997, 789). This interpretation, however, does not pay\ndue attention to the fact that according to Brentano, inner perception\nis not a self-standing mental phenomenon of a higher level, but rather\na structural moment of every mental phenomenon. Moreover,\nwith his unity of consciousness thesis Brentano explicitly rejects the\nbasic assumption of all higher-order perception theories of\nconsciousness, i.e., the idea that we can have two mental phenomena\n(of distinct levels) at the same time, one of them being directed\ntowards the other: higher-order perception theories postulate what\nBrentano calls \u2018inner observation\u2019 (as opposed to inner\nperception), which according to him was impossible, as we have seen\nabove. \n\nAccordingly, a number of recent interpreters have suggested that\nBrentano was an advocate of a one-level account of consciousness:\n\u201cSince the features that make an act conscious are firmly\nlocated within the act itself rather than bestowed on it by a second\nact, this locates Brentano\u2019s view as a one-level view of\nconsciousness\u201d (Thomasson, 2000, 192). This reading has given\nplace to neo-Brentanian theories such as Thomasson\u2019s adverbial\naccount (cf. Thomasson 2000) or self-representational approaches (cf.,\nfor example, Kriegel 2003a, b) that build on the thesis that\n\u201cevery conscious state has a dual representational content. Its\nmain content is the normal content commonly attributed to mental\nrepresentations. But it also has a (rather peripheral) special\ncontent, namely, its own occurrence\u201d (Kriegel 2003a, 480), which\nthey take as Brentano\u2019s central thesis. Moreover, Kriegel\nsuggests that for Brentano this self-representational aspect is a\nnecessary condition for having a presentation (Kriegel 2013). \n\nOther interprets have taken more cautious lines. Mark Textor (2006),\nfor example, has stressed the ties between Brentano\u2019s notion of\nsecondary consciousness and his thesis of the unity of consciousness.\nA mental phenomenon, according to Textor\u2019s interpretation of\nBrentano\u2019s theory, does not become conscious by representing\nitself, but rather by its being unified or fused with an\nimmediately evident cognition of it. Dan Zahavi, on the other hand,\nhas insisted that Brentano does distinguish two levels of perception,\nwhich sheds doubts on the one-level interpretation: \u201cIt could be\nargued that Brentano\u2019s claim that every conscious intentional\nstate takes two objects, a primary (external) object and secondary\n(internal) object, remains committed to a higher-order account of\nconsciousness; it simply postulates it as being implicitly contained\nin every conscious state\u201d (Zahavi, 2006, 5). In short,\nBrentano\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary\nconsciousness \u201cintroduces some kind of level-distinction into\nthe structure of experience\u201d (Brandl 2013, 61) but does not\nconceive of higher-perception as a full-fledged mental phenomenon at\nits own, which is why Brandl has recently proposed to regard it a\n\u2018one-and-a-half-level theory\u2019 (Brandl 2013, 61f).\n\nWhile the debate concerning the exact interpretation of his views\nconcerning secondary consciousness is still open, it underlines the\nrelevance of Brentano\u2019s contributions to contemporary philosophy\nof mind. \n3.2 Intentionality\n\nBrentano is probably best known for having introduced the notion of\nintentionality to contemporary philosophy. He first characterizes this\nnotion with the following words, which have become the classical,\nalbeit not completely unambiguous formulation of the intentionality\nthesis: \n\n\n\u201cEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the\nScholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental)\ninexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly\nunambiguously, reference to a content, direction toward an object\n(which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent\nobjectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object\nwithin itself...\u201d (Brentano PES, 68)\n\n[\u201cJedes psychische Ph\u00e4nomen ist durch das\ncharakterisiert, was die Scholastiker des Mittelalters die\nintentionale (auch wohl mentale) Inexistenz eines Gegenstandes genannt\nhaben, und was wir, obwohl mit nicht ganz unzweideutigen\nAusdr\u00fccken, die Beziehung auf einen Inhalt, die Richtung auf ein\nObjekt (worunter hier nicht eine Realit\u00e4t zu verstehen ist), oder\ndie immanente Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit nennen w\u00fcrden. Jedes\nenth\u00e4lt etwas als Objekt in sich\u2026\u201d (Brentano,\nPES 124f)]\n\n\nThis quotation must be understood in context: in this passage,\nBrentano aims at providing one (of six) criteria to distinguish mental\nfrom physical phenomena with the aim to define the subject matter of\nscientific psychology \u2013 and not to develop a systematic account\nof intentionality. The passage clearly suggests, however, that the\nintentional object towards which we are directed is part of the\npsychological act. It is something mental rather than physical.\nBrentano, thus, seems to advocate a form of immanentism, according to\nwhich the intentional object is \u201cin the head,\u201d as it were.\nSome Brentano scholars have recently argued that this immanent reading\nof the intentionality thesis is too strong. In the light of other\ntexts by Brentano from the same period they argue that he\ndistinguishes between intentional correlate and object, and that the\nexistence of the latter does not depend on our being directed towards\nit.\n\nWhen Brentano\u2019s students took up his notion of\nintentionality to develop more systematic accounts, they often\ncriticized it for its unclarity regarding the ontological status of\nthe intentional object: if the intentional object is part of the act,\nit was argued, we are faced with a duplication of the object. Next to\nthe real, physical object, which is perceived, remembered, thought of,\netc., we have a mental, intentional object, towards which the act is\nactually directed. Thus, when I think about the city of Paris, I am\nactually thinking of a mental object that is part of my act of\nthinking, and not about the actual city. This view leads to obvious\ndifficulties, the most disastrous of which is that two persons can\nnever be directed towards one and the same object.\n\nIf we try to resolve the problem by taking the intentional object to\nbe identical with the real object, on the other hand, we face the\ndifficulty of explaining how we can have mental phenomena that are\ndirected towards non-existing objects such as Hamlet, the golden\nmountain, or a round square. Like my thinking about the city of Paris,\nall these acts are intentionally directed towards an object, with the\ndifference, however, that their objects do not really exist.\n\nBrentano\u2019s initial formulation of the intentionality-thesis does\nnot address these problems concerning the ontological status of the\nintentional object. The first attempt of Brentano\u2019s students to\novercome these difficulties was made by Twardowski, who distinguished\nbetween content and object of the act, the former of which is immanent\nto the act, the latter not (cf. Twardowski 1977). This distinction\nstrongly influenced other members of the Brentano School, mainly the\ntwo students for who the notion of intentionality had the most central\nplace, Meinong and Husserl.\n\nMeinong\u2019s theory of objects can best be understood as a reaction\nto the ontological difficulties in Brentano\u2019s account. Rather\nthan accepting the notion of an immanent content, Meinong argues that\nthe intentional relation is always a relation between the mental act\nand an object. In some cases the intentional object does not exist,\nbut even in these cases there is an object external to the mental act\ntowards which we are directed. According to Meinong, even non-existent\nobjects are in some sense real. Since we can be intentionally directed\ntowards them, they must subsist (bestehen). Not all\nsubsisting objects exist; some of them cannot even exist for they are\nlogically impossible, such as round squares (cf. Meinong 1981). The\nnotion of intentionality played a central role also in Husserlian\nphenomenology. Applying his method of the phenomenological reduction,\nhowever, Husserl addresses the problem of directedness with his notion\nof \u2018noema\u2019 as intentional correlate of the act (for a more\ndetailed discussion, cf. the entry on\n Husserl).\n \n\nBrentano was not very fond of his students\u2019 attempts to resolve\nthese difficulties, mainly because he rejected their underlying\nontological assumptions. He was quick to point out that he never\nintended the intentional object to be immanent to the act. Brentano\nthought that this interpretation of his position was obviously absurd,\nfor it would be \u201cparadoxical to the extreme to say that a man\npromises to marry an ens rationis and fulfills his promise by\nmarrying a real person\u201d (PES, 299). In later texts, he\ntherefore suggested to see intentionality as an exceptional form of\nrelation. A mental act does not stand in an ordinary relation to an\nobject, but in a quasi-relation (Relativliches). For a\nrelation to exist, both relata have to exist. A person a is\ntaller than another person b, for example, only if both\na and b exist (and a is, in fact, taller\nthan b). This does not hold for the intentional\nquasi-relation, Brentano suggests. A mental phenomenon can stand in a\nquasi-relation to an object independently of whether it exists or not.\nMental acts, thus, can stand in a quasi-relation to existing objects\nlike the city of Paris as well as non-existing objects like the Golden\nMountain. Brentano\u2019s later account, which is closely related to\nhis later metaphysics, especially to his turn towards reism, i.e., the\nview that only individual objects exist, can hardly be considered a\nsolution of the problem of the ontological status of the intentional\nobject. He rather introduces a new term to reformulate the\ndifficulties.\n3.3 Time-Consciousness\n\nAccording to Brentano\u2019s thesis of the unity of consciousness, we\ncan have only one mental phenomenon at a time. Next to this synchronic\nunity, however, there is also a diachronic unity of consciousness: my\npresent mental phenomenon and the one I had just a moment or a few\nminutes ago form a unity as well. This becomes particularly evident\nwhen we consider cases in which we are intentionally directed towards\ntemporally extended objects such as melodies, movies, or goals in a\nsoccer game.\n\nBrentano regards time as a continuum of which only one point, the\npresent moment, is real. As a consequence, mental phenomena do not\nhave temporal extension (very much like like mathematical points on a\nline). The question, now, is: how can mental phenomena, which do not\nhave any temporal extension, be directed towards objects that are\nextended in time? Can we be directed towards the melody, or only\ntowards a (very small) temporal part of it? Brentano solves this\nproblem by arguing that the object of a presentation does not vanish\nimmediately from consciousness in the moment the presentation is over,\nit is rather retained in consciousness for a short while. In order to\nexplain this process, he introduces the notion of \u201coriginal\nassociation\u201d or \u201cproteraesthesis\u201d, which, as de\nWarren suggests, \u201coccupies a notable place in the list of\nBrentano\u2019s conceptual innovations; in contrast to other\ndistinguishing concepts of descriptive psychology ... it is without\nprecedence in the history of philosophy\u201d (De Warren 2009,\n57f).\n\nBrentano has reflected on time consciousness throughout his life, but\nhas never given a systematic exposition of his position that would\ngive it a static form. Rather, he has changed his position several\ntimes, often to accommodate it to changes in his overall views. Based\non the testimonies of his students and manuscripts contained in the\nNachlass, we can distinguish different phases of\nBrentano\u2019s views on time-consciousness (cf. Fr\u00e9chette\n2017).\n\nAccording to his early view, time consciousness depends on\nthe mode of judgment. I can be intentionally directed towards a past\nobject if I judge (correctly) that, say, \u201cCaesar was stabbed on\nthe Ides of March, 44 B.C.\u201d. The reason for characterising\ntemporal differences as modes of judgments is probably the fact that\nin language we express these temporal differences with the tense of\nthe verb (past, present, future) \u2013 but the verb also serves to\nexpress our accepting or denying the existence of an object in a\njudgment.\n\nIn his second phase, which he held from the early 1870s to\nthe early 1890s, Brentano introduced the notion of original\nassociation. A mental phenomenon does not disappear from consciousness\nfrom one moment to another, it is rather retained for a short period\nof time. When I hear a melody a, b, c,\nd, for example, I first hear a. When, in a second\nmoment, I hear b, a still persists in my\nconsciousness, but is modified as \u201cpast\u201d. When, another\nmoment later, I hear c, both b and a are\nretained in original association; now also b is given as\n\u201cpast\u201d, while a is \u201cpushed back\u201d even\nfurther into the past, as it were, etc. In this way, Brentano can\nexplain how the melody (as a whole) can be the intentional object of a\nmental phenomenon: in each moment, the present and the (very) recent\ntones are given, but the latter are not given in the same way (or else\nwe would not hear a melody, but we would hear all the tones at once;\nwe would, in other words, not hear a melody, but a cacophony). The\ntones that are past are given with temporal modifications \u2013\nwhich do not further determine them, but rather modify their\nontological status from real to not real. In this period Brentano\nholds that two presentations can differ only in the object towards\nwhich they are directed; the continuously changing temporal moment,\nthus, is a modification of the objects. An object that sinks back into\nthe past undergoes, according to this view, continuous\nmodifications.\n\nIn the early 1890s Brentano modifies his views again, suggesting that\nthe temporal modification is not a modification of the content, but of\nthe attitude of acknowledgement in judgments. With this change,\nBrentano avoids problems of his earlier view: he no longer needs to\nsuggest that temporal modifications are parts of the intentional\nobjects that are given in original associations, nor does he need to\nexplain how the real, present object can form a continuum with the\npast objects that are not real.\n\nIn later years, Brentano makes further changes to his theory of\ntime-consciousness. Since temporal modifications can be observed also\nin mental phenomena that do not contain a judgment (for example when\none imagines vividly hearing a melody), he gives up his view that two\npresentations can differ only in their intentional object and allows\nfor modes of presentation \u2013 such as temporal modes. Finally, in\na late manuscript that was dictated in 1915, Brentano introduces\nanother minor modification of his theory, suggesting that past objects\ncan be presented only in modo obliquo, while present objects\nare presented in modo recto.\n\nBrentano\u2019s reflections on time-consciousness illustrate very\nwell his way of doing philosophy, but also the way in which his views\nhave had an influence on others. As Oskar Kraus notes in his\nRecollections (cf. Kraus 1919, 39), Brentano has vividly\nengaged with the problem of time and the origins of time consciousness\nthroughout his life. He presented it several times to students in\nclass and discussed i in letters with colleagues at different moments\nin time. He never presented a systematic exposition of his views in\npublication, though. As a result, Brentano\u2019s views on the topic\nwere very dynamic, as he did not hesitate to revise them when he\nencountered problems or when changes in other parts of his overall\ntheory made it necessary. As he never published a systematic statement\nof his views on time-consciousness, interested scholars could learn\nabout it only from the expositions of Brentano\u2019s students like\nCarl Stumpf, Anton Marty, and in particular Edmund Husserl who,\nhowever, used Brentano\u2019s views as departing point for their own\nreflections, very often in an attempt to overcome the difficulties\ninherent to the version of Brentano\u2019s theory they were\nacquainted with. Brentano\u2019s own views were, thus, very\ninfluential, but risked to become eclipsed by the contributions of his\nstudents, who further developed them. \n4. Logic, Ethics, and Aesthetics\n\nAccording to Brentano, psychology plays a central role in the\nsciences; he considers especially logics, ethics, and aesthetics as\npractical disciplines that depend on psychology as their theoretical\nfoundation. He collocates these three disciplines in his larger\nsystematic outlook by tying them to the three kinds of mental\nphenomenon: presentations, judgments, and phenomena of love and hate,\ni.e., emotions. The \u201ctriad of the Beautiful, the\nTrue, and the Good ... [is] related to the three\naspects of our mental life\u201d (PES, 203). Moreover, the\nthree disciplines essentially build on his views that presentations\nare intrinsically valuable and that not only judgments, but also\nemotions can be correct or not correct. \n\nLogic, according to Brentano, is the practical discipline that is\nconcerned with judgments; i.e. with the class of mental phenomena in\nwhich we take a positive or a negative stance towards the (existence\nof the) object by affirming or denying it. In addition, judgments are\ncorrect or not; they have a truth-value. According to Brentano, a\njudgment is true when it is evident, i.e., when one perceives (in\ninner perception that is directed towards the judgment) that one\njudges with evidence. Brentano, thus, rejects the correspondence\ntheory of truth, suggesting that \u201ca person judges truly, if and\nonly if, his judgment agrees with the judgment he would make if we\nwere to judge with evidence\u201d (Chisholm 1986, 38).\nNotwithstanding this dependence on the notion of judgment, however,\ntruth, for Brentano, is not a subjective notion: if one person affirms\nan object and another person denies the same object, only one of them\njudges correctly. (For a more detailed discussion of Brentano\u2019s\ncontributions to logic, cf. the entry\n Brentano\u2019s Theory of Judgement.)\n\nEthics, on the other hand, is concerned with emotions or, as Brentano\ncalls them, phenomena of love and hate. Brentano sees a structural\nanalogy between judgments and phenomena of this class: just like\njudgments, that are either affirmative or negative, also emotions\nconsist in taking a positive or a negative (emotional) attitude\ntowards an object: love or hate, inclination and disinclination, being\npleased and being displeased, etc. Moreover, just as (positive and\nnegative) judgments can be correct or incorrect, Brentano holds that\nalso (both positive and negative) emotions can be correct or\nincorrect. An emotion is correct, according to Brentano, \u201cwhen\none\u2019s feelings are adequate to their object \u2014 adequate in\nthe sense of being appropriate, suitable, or fitting\u201d\n(ORW, 70). [\u201cWer richtig liebt und ha\u00dft,\ndessen Gem\u00fct verh\u00e4lt sich den Gegenst\u00e4nden\nad\u00e4quat, d.h. es verh\u00e4lt sich konvenient, passend,\nentsprechend\u201d (USE, 76)] \n\nIf it is correct to love an object, we can say that it is good; if it\nis correct to hate it, it is bad:\n\n\u201cWe call a thing true when the affirmation relating to\nit is correct. We call a thing good when the love relating to\nit is correct. In the broadest sense of the term, the good is that\nwhich is worthy of love, that which can be loved with a love that is\ncorrect.\u201d (ORW, 18)\n\n[\u201cWir nennen etwas Wahr, wenn die darauf bez\u00fcgliche\nAnerkennung richtig ist. Wir nennen etwas gut, wenn die darauf\nbez\u00fcgliche Liebe richtig ist. Das mit richtiger Liebe zu\nLiebende, das Liebenswerte, ist das Gute im weitesten Sinne des\nWortes.\u201d (USE 17)]\n\n\nNot any experience of pleasure is taken into consideration, one needs\nsome sort of evidence that the pleasure is correct. Brentano\ncharacterizes the relevant form of pleasure with the following words:\n\u201cit is a pleasure of the highest form; it is thus the analogue of\nsomething being evident in the sphere of judgment\u201d\n(ORW, 22) [\u201cEs ist ein Gefallen von jener\nh\u00f6heren Form die das Analogon ist von der Evidenz auf dem Gebiet\ndes Urteils\u201d (USE 21)]. In this way Brentano avoids a\nsubjectivist position. While it is true that correct pleasure is an\nemotion experienced by subjects, it is impossible that one person can\nevidently and correctly love an object and another correctly and\nevidently hate it. In some cases, pleasure or love might be misguided\nby our prejudices, instincts or habits. \n\nBrentano presented his reflections on ethics in a lecture in 1889. The\nmanuscript was published as a short monograph in the same year, an\nEnglish translation had appeared as early as 1902 and was, for a long\ntime, the only text by Brentano available in English. This might\nexplain why Brentano\u2019s views on ethics have received more\nattention in English speaking countries than in central Europe. In\nparticular, Brentano\u2019s basic insight that moral and aesthetic\nvalue are related to attitudes we take towards objects and that these\nlatter attitudes can be correct or incorrect, have had a revival in\nrecent years, as it has inspired\n fitting attitude theories of value.\n \n\nAesthetics, finally, is based on the most basic class of mental\nphenomena: on presentations. According to Brentano, every presentation\nis in itself of value; this holds even for those that become the basis\nof a correct, negative judgment or emotion. \n\n\u201cEvery presentation, taken by itself, is a good and recognizable\nas such, since an emotion that is characterized as being correct can\nbe directed towards it. It is out of question that everyone, if they\nhad to choose between a state of unconsciousness and the having of any\npresentation whatsoever, would welcome even the poorest presentation\nand would not envy lifeless objects. Every presentation appears of\nvalue in that it constitutes a valuable enrichment of life.\u201d\n(GA, 144 [my translation])\n\n[\u201cJedes Vorstellen ist aber, an und f\u00fcr sich\nbetrachtet, ein Gut und als solches erkennbar, weil sich eine als\nrichtig charakterisierte Gem\u00fctst\u00e4tigkeit darauf richten\nkann. Ohne Frage w\u00fcrde jedermann, wenn er zwischen dem Zustand\nder Bewu\u00dftlosigkeit und dem Besitz irgendwelcher Vorstellungen\nzu w\u00e4hlen h\u00e4tte, auch die \u00e4rmlichste\nbegr\u00fc\u00dfen und die leblosen Dinge nicht beneiden. Jede\nVorstellung erscheint als eine Bereicherung des Lebens von\nWert.\u201d (GA, 144)]\n\n\nThus, while judgments and emotions consist in taking either a positive\nor a negative stance, the value of a presentation is always positive,\nbut comes in degrees: some presentations are of higher value than\nothers. Not every presentations is of particular aesthetic value,\nthough; in order to be so, it has to become the object of an emotion\nin which one correctly takes a positive stance towards it. In short,\naccording to Brentano, an object is beautiful if a presentation that\nis directed at it arouses a correct, positive emotion, i.e., a form of\npleasure; it is ugly, on the other hand, if a presentation that is\ndirected at it arouses a correct, negative emotion, a form of\ndispleasure. \n\nLike secondary qualities, the aesthetic value is not an intrinsic\nproperty of the object but rather depends on the way we experience it.\nWe tend to attribute beauty to the objects of experience, but strictly\nspeaking, the experienced objects are neither beautiful nor ugly:\n\n\u201cWhen we call a girl beautiful, the term is used in a figurative\nsense. It is similar when we call objects that are outside of us\ngreen, red, warm, cold, sweet, bitter. All these expressions refer\ninitially to what appears, and are then also transferred to that which\npossibly evokes in us this appearance by having an impact on\nus.\u201d (GA 123 [my translation])\n\n[\u201cWenn wir ein M\u00e4dchen sch\u00f6n nennen, so wird der\nName in \u00fcbertragenem Sinn gebraucht. Es ist \u00e4hnlich, wie\nwenn wir K\u00f6rper, die au\u00dfer uns sind, gr\u00fcn, rot, warm,\nkalt, hei\u00df, biter nennen. Alle diese Ausdr\u00fccke bezeichnen\nzun\u00e4chst das, was erscheint, werden dann auch auf solches\n\u00fcbertragen, was unter Umst\u00e4nden auf uns einwirkend diese\nErscheinungen hervorruft.\u201d (GA 123)]\n\n\nEven though Brentano\u2019s views on ethics and aesthetics are\nsomewhat sketchy and not worked out in detail, we can note that his\ntreatment of the three practical disciplines of logics, ethics, and\naesthetics are unified by a common principle: the idea that judgments\nor emotions not only can be positive or negative, they can also be\nfitting or appropriate to their object. Moreover, by tying the three\ndisciplines to his tripartition of mental phenomena (presentations,\njudgments, emotions), he also assigns them an exact collocation in his\noverall philosophical system. For these reasons, recent commentators\nhave insisted in the systematicity of Brentano\u2019s philosophy,\narguing that he \u201cwas the last philosopher to have offered a\nsystem in the sense of a structurally unified account of the true, the\ngood, and the beautiful.\u201d (Kriegel 2017a, 29). Kriegel\nacknowledges, however, that \u201cBrentano was not a systematic\nwriter\u201d (ibid., 21). This shows in the fact that\nBrentano saw his task mainly in sketching the basic views on\naesthetics and ethics in lectures, but never presented a longer or\nsystematic treatise of these topics, which can be explained by his\nconviction that science was a collective enterprise and by his\naversion of the cult of the genius that was widespread in his times.\nBrentano probably hoped that others would continue to work out the\ndetails within the parameters he had set. We know about his views on\naesthetics and ethics only from lecture notes that have been cut,\nrevised, and amended by his students, who typically did not bother to\ndocument their substantial editorial changes in the published text.\nMoreover, Brentano never presented his philosophical position as a\nsystem, probably because he did not want to be associated with German\nsystem philosophers of the early and mid-nineteenth century. Thus, the\nclaim that Brentano was a system-philosopher is somewhat questionable,\nthough he definitely was a systematic thinker in the sense that he\nalways kept the overall picture in mind when working on a specific\nproblem. \n5. Psychologism and the Historiography of Philosophy\n\nThe discussion of Brentano\u2019s views on logic, ethics and\naesthetics shows that his philosophy has strong psychologistic\ntendencies. Whether or not one is to conclude that he does adopt a\nform of psychologism depends on the exact definition of the latter\nterm: Brentano vehemently rejects the charge of psychologism, which he\ntakes to stand for a subjectivist and anthropocentric position. At the\nsame time, however, he explicitly defends the claim that psychology is\nthe theoretical science on which practical disciplines of logic,\nethics, and aesthetics are based. In LW he explicitly notes\nthat, like all other philosophical disciplines, also aesthetics is\nrooted in psychology and continues: \u201cAnd similarly one could\nshow for aesthetics and any other philosophical discipline that\nseparated from psychology it would have to wither like a branch that\nis detached from the trunk.\u201d (LW, 39 [my translation])\n[\u201cUnd \u00e4hnlich lie\u00dfe sich f\u00fcr die Aesthetik\nund jede andere Disciplin der Philosophie aufs leichteste nachweisen,\nda\u00df sie, losgetrennt von der Psychologie, wie ein vom Stamm\nlosgetrennter Zweig verdorren m\u00fcsste.\u201d] Hence,\nBrentano does adopt the form of psychologism Husserl seems to have had\nin mind in the Prolegomena to his Logical\nInvestigations, where he defines logical psychologism as a\nposition according to which:\n\n\n\u2026 [T]he essential theoretical foundations of logic lie in\npsychology, in whose field those propositions belong \u2014 as far as\ntheir theoretical content is concerned \u2014 which give logic its\ncharacteristic pattern. \u2026 Often people talk as if psychology\nprovided the sole, sufficient, theoretical foundation for logical\npsychology (Husserl 2001, 40).\n\n[Die wesentlichen theoretischen Fundamente liegen in der\nPsychologie; in deren Gebiet geh\u00f6ren ihrem theoretischen Gehalt\nnach die S\u00e4tze, die der Logik ihr charakteristisches Gepr\u00e4ge\ngeben. \u2026 Ja nicht selten spricht man so, als g\u00e4be die\nPsychologie das alleinige und ausreichende theoretische Fundament\nf\u00fcr die logische Kunstlehre. (Husserl, 1900, 51)]\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s tendency to offer psychological explanations is shown\nalso in his approach to the history of philosophy, in particular in\nhis explanations of the mechanisms that explain the historical\ndevelopment in this discipline. In his text The Four Phases of\nPhilosophy and Its Current State (1998) he defended the\nmetaphilosophical thesis that progress in philosophy can be explained\naccording to principles of cultural psychology. According to Brentano,\nphilosophical progress takes place in circles. He divides the whole\nhistory of philosophy in three periods (ancient, medieval, and modern\nphilosophy), each of which can, according to him, be subdivided in\nfour phases. The first is a creative phase of renewal and ascending\ndevelopment; the other three are phases of decline, dominated by a\nturn towards practical interests, by scepticism, and finally by\nmysticism. After the fourth phase, a new period begins with a creative\nphase of renewal. \n\nBrentano has presented his model to a larger audience quite late in\nhis life, but he had come up with it very early in his career; Carl\nStumpf reports that Brentano first came up with this idea in 1860 and\nthat he used it in his lectures on the history of philosophy already\nin W\u00fcrzburg in the mid-sixties (cf. Stumpf 1919, 89f). While both\nthe historical accuracy of and the principles of cultural psychology\nthat gave rise to the model can be put in question (cf. Gilson 1976),\nit definitely tells the reader much about Brentano\u2019s conception\nof philosophy and his vivid interest in its history. Brentano\u2019s\nshort text can, thus, best be read as a simplifying narrative that\nallows the author to explain his conviction that philosophy ought to\npursue of pure, theoretical interests and to express his fascination\nfor philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas, or Descartes as well as his\ndislike of Plotinus, Nicolas of Cues, Kant, Hegel, and Schelling. \n6. Brentano\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nEven though Brentano worked on problems in metaphysics and ontology\nthroughout his life, he hardly published on these topics during his\nlifetime. The impact of his views is due to the fact that from his\nearly lectures at the University of W\u00fcrzburg on he discussed them\nwith his students, both in class and (especially in later years) in\ncorrespondence. \n\nEven though Brentano\u2019s views have underwent considerable changes\nover the years, his general attitude can be characterized as sober,\nparsimonious, and (in the current use of the term) nominalistic; at no\npoint did he admit the existence of universals, he rather relied on\nmereological principles to account for classical problems in ontology.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s early metaphysics, which is the result of his\ncritical reading of Aristotle, is a form of conceptualism. He does\ndistinguish between substance and accidents, but argues that both are\nbut fictions cum fundamentum in re. With this, he wants to\nsuggest that they do not have actual existence, but that we can make\njudgments about real things that are correct and contain references to\nsubstances and accidents. This view is closely connected to his\nepistemic notion of truth, according to which the question of whether\na judgment is true does not depend on its corresponding to reality,\nbut rather on whether it can be judged with evidence. Brentano\nelucidates the relation between a thing and its properties on the\nbasis of the mereological notions of \u201clogical part\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysical part,\u201d the former of which account for\nabstract, repeatable properties, the latter for the concrete\nproperties of a thing. Both are not considered to be denizens of\nreality in a narrow sense, but rather fictions that have a foundation\nin reality. (For a reconstruction and discussion of the details of\nBrentano\u2019s early ontology, cf. Chrudzimski 2004).\n\nAfter the introduction of the notion of intentionality in his\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874), Brentano\nstruggled to account for the ontological status of the intentional\nobject. When he first introduces the notion, suggesting, as we have\nseen above, that \u201c[e]very mental phenomenon includes something\nas object within itself\u201d (PES, 88), he seems to be\ninterested primarily in presenting a psychological thesis and does not\nseem to be overly worried with its ontological implications; at this\npoint, the talk of an \u201cimmanent object\u201d might have been a\nmere fa\u00e7on de parler(cf. Chrudzimski and Smith, 2003,\n205). Soon Brentano finds himself in the need, however, to address\nthis question and, as a result, to enrich the domain of objects in his\nontology. He seems to admit that next to concrete things there are\nirrealia, that is, objects that to not really exist but have\nthe status of thought-objects or, as he puts it, entia\nrationis, that do not have an essence and do not stand in causal\nrelations. Brentano does not systematically elaborate his ontological\nposition in this period, we rather find a bundle of ideas of which he\ndid not seem to be fully convinced. This underlines that the\nformulation of these views was not made with the intention to make a\ncontribution to ontology, but rather to reply to concerns that have\nemerged from his introduction of the notion of intentionality. \n\nIn his late philosophy, from 1904 on, Brentano rediscovers the virtue\nof ontological parsimony and takes up the main insights of his\nconceptualist period, developing (and radicalizing) them to a form of\n reism,\n according to which the only items that exist are individual things\n(res). \u201cWhile young Brentano tried to ontologically\nplay down certain ways of speaking, late Brentano tried to eliminate\nthem from philosophical discourse\u201d (Chrudzimski 2004, 177) [my\ntranslation. \u201cDer junge Brentano versuchte gewisse\nRedeweisen ontologisch zu bagatellisieren, der sp\u00e4te\nBrentano versuchte sie aus dem philosophischen Diskurs zu\neliminieren\u201d] . He abandons the notion of\nirrealia, which he now regards as linguistic fictions, and\ncontinues to deny the existence of universals or abstract entities.\nInstead, he conceives both substances and accidents as real things\nthat are related to one another by a particular mereological relation:\nan accident does not only ontologically depend on the substance, it\nalso contains the substance as a part without, however, containing any\nsupplementary part. A white table, accordingly, is an accident that\ncontains the table as a part. If we were to paint it red, the white\ntable would cease to exist and the red table would come into existence\n\u2013 the continuity between the two being guaranteed by the table,\nwhich was part of the white table and is now part of the red table.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s ontology is known to a broader audience only through\nposthumously published works that were edited by his late students\nOskar Kraus and Alfred Kastil, who considered his late position most\nimportant and accordingly put less emphasis on Brentano\u2019s\nearlier phases. Only recently the development of Brentano\u2019s\nviews on ontology has gained more attention, mainly through the work\nof scholars who were able to study unpublished manuscripts in the\narchives (cf., for example, Chrudzimski 2004). This underlines once\nmore the need of a critical edition of Brentano\u2019s entire\nNachlass, which would make it possible for a broader audience\nto critically assess the development of Brentano\u2019s views in\nontology. \n7. The Impact of Brentano\u2019s Philosophy\n7.1 Early Reception: The Brentano School\n\nBrentano\u2019s contributions to philosophy were widely discussed\namong philosophers and psychologists at the end of the nineteenth and\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. Moreover, he had a strong\nimpact on an impressive number of students who became famous\nphilosophers on their own right. Often, these philosophers are\nreferred to as the \u201cSchool of Franz Brentano,\u201d (cf.\nAlbertazzi e.al. 1996) in order to underline that all of them drew\nexplicitly (and when not explicitly, then recognizably) on\nBrentano\u2019s work. All members of the school have become\nacquainted with Brentano\u2019s philosophy in his lectures or through\nconversation or correspondence with him, but they form a quite\nheterogeneous group that did not make attempts to jointly develop a\nshared position: there was no general acceptance of a specific\nunifying doctrine of the \u201cSchool\u201d, nor did its members\nmake attempts to unite forces and cooperate on specific projects. What\nunites the School is a vivid interests in the topics that Brentano\ndiscussed in his lectures, first and foremost in psychology and in the\nidea that philosophy should adopt a rigorous, scientific method (cf.\nDewalque 2017a, b). In fact, it was Brentano\u2019s methodological\nmaxim that has raised the interest in most members of the school in\nthe first place, cf., for example, Stumpf (1919) and Husserl (1919),\nboth of who suggest that Brentano\u2019s conception of philosophy as\na rigorous science had a decisive impact on their decision to pursue a\nprofessional career in philosophy.\n\nBrentano\u2019s influence on students has seen different phases that\nare loosely connected to the places where he taught. In his early\nyears in W\u00fcrzburg (1866\u20131873), Brentano became noted mainly\nfor his attempt to renew philosophy on the basis of a rigorous,\nscientific method. His most important students at the time,\n Carl Stumpf\n and\n Anton Marty,\n made a significant academic career in their own right. As Brentano\nwas not yet appointed professor and could, in consequence, not yet\nsupervise PhD theses, both completed their PhD with Lotze in\nG\u00f6ttingen. Stumpf then held positions in Prague, Halle, Munich,\nand Berlin, where he founded a psychological laboratory and gave\ndecisive impulses for the development of Gestalt psychology. Anton\nMarty became professor at the University of Prague and had a strong\ninfluence with his work on the philosophy of language. Both Stumpf and\nMarty developed their own positions and deviated locally from\nBrentano\u2019s views, but they remained faithful followers who\ncontinued to acknowledge the influence that Brentano has had on\nthem.\n\nWhen Brentano took up teaching at the University of Vienna in 1874,\nhis lectures soon became very popular among students. In the first\nyears, Thomas Masaryk (who later became the first president of the\nCzechoslovakia),\n Alexius Meinong,\n Alois H\u00f6fler, and\n Christian von Ehrenfels\n attended Brentano\u2019s lectures. In the years after 1880 (when\nBrentano had lost his chair and was teaching as Privatdozent,\nwhich meant that he could no longer supervise PhD theses) Franz\nHillebrand,\n Edmund Husserl,\n and\n Kazimierz Twardowski\n studied with him. Unlike Stumpf or Marty, Brentano\u2019s students\nin Vienna encountered a mature professor who had his opus\nmaximum already published. Their relation to Brentano, in\nconsequence, was less that of a friendship, and more that between a\nstudent and a renowned professor. Soon many of them have felt the urge\nto overcome Brentano\u2019s influence and define their own,\nindependent philosophical position \u2013 and possibly form a school\nin their own right. In particular Meinong and Husserl, who are\nprobably the most famous representants of Brentano\u2019s school,\ncame to have a rather troublesome relation to their former teacher. It\nis not by accident that both used the term \u201cBrentano\nSchool\u201d only to distance themselves from it.\n\nIn 1895, when Brentano gave up his position as Privatdozent\nin Vienna and moved to Florence, he gave up teaching and could no\nlonger exert a direct influence on students. In this period, the\ncenter of the Brentano school moved to Prague, where Anton Marty held\nregular meetings with interested students, among them Oskar Kraus and\nAlfred Kastil. These second-generation members of the Brentano school\n\u2013 who are often called \u201cBrentanoten\u201d or\n\u201corthodox Brentanists\u201d \u2013 stayed very faithful to\nBrentano\u2019s philosophy, (in particular to his last, reistic phase\nthat they knew first-hand). They saw it as their main task to preserve\nBrentano\u2019s view and to defend them against the developments\nintroduced by Husserl and the early phenomenologists as well as those\nintroduced by Meinong and other members of the Graz School,\nrespectively. After Brentano\u2019s death in 1917, they tried to set\nup and archive for Brentano\u2019s Nachlass and publish\ntexts from it posthumously. While in the first years they achieved\nconsiderable results, not at least due to the help of the Czech\npresident Jan Masaryk, the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938\nforced them into emigration and so brought an end to the Brentano\nSchool.\n7.2 Recent Reception: Rediscovering Brentano\n\nBrentano\u2019s impact in a larger philosophical audience was soon\neclipsed by that of his students who founded philosophical traditions\non their own: Husserl started the\n phenomenological movement,\n Meinong the Graz school, Twardowski the\n Lvov-Warsaw School.\n As a result, in the second half of the twentieth century Brentano was\noften mentioned as the philosopher who had (re-)introduced\nthe notion of intentionality, as \u201cgrandfather\u201d of the\nphenomenological movement, or for his influence on early analytic\nphilosophy, but his own philosophical views and arguments were hardly\ndiscussed. \n\nThere are notable exceptions to this tendency, though. Roderick\nChisholm, for example, made a continuous effort to show\nBrentano\u2019s significance to contemporary philosophy by adopting\nhis results in his own contributions to the philosophy of mind, but\nalso in presentations of various aspects of Brentano\u2019s thought\n(cf. Chisholm 1966, 1982, and 1986). Moreover, in recent decades the\ntradition that is often referred to as \u201cAustrian\nphilosophy\u201d has gained increasing interest in a broader\nphilosophical audience, which is due mainly to the work of Rudolf\nHaller, Barry Smith, Peter Simons, and Kevin Mulligan, among others.\nBy showing the systematic relevance of Brentano\u2019s (and other\nAustrian philosophers\u2019) contributions to problems discussed in\nontology, logic, the theory of emotions, or consciousness, they could\ncounteract the tendency to reduce Brentano\u2019s contributions to\nthe introduction of the notion of intentionality. \n\nIt is quite interesting to note, however, that in the last two decades\nthe philosophical contributions of Brentano have gained a new life as\nan increasing number of philosophers from different fields are\nrediscovering and elaborating on different themes from\nBrentano\u2019s work. His contributions to the philosophy of mind\nhave been taken up and play a central role in the debate concerning\nthe nature of consciousness and the relation between\n consciousness and intentionality,\n the\n unity of consciousness\n and\n time-consciousness;\n his views on ethics have been inspired\n fitting attitude theories of value,\n which analyze ethical value in terms of correct or incorrect forms of\napproval or disapproval. Moreover, the recent centenary of\nBrentano\u2019s death (2017) has given occasion to a number of\nconferences and publications that put Brentano\u2019s contribution at\nthe center of attention (cf., for example, Kriegel 2017). This shows\nthat the interest in Brentano\u2019s systematic contribution to\nphilosophy is still strong and vivid. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"works\">Works by Brentano</a>", "<a name=\"secondary\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"works\">Works by Brentano</a>": ["</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"abbreviations\">Abbreviations for Works Cited</a></h4>\n<table class=\"cellpad-med-dense cell-rl vert-top\">\n<tr>", "DP", "<em>Descriptive Psychology</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "GA", "<em>Grundz\u00fcge der \u00c4sthetik</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "LW", "<em>Meine letzten W\u00fcnsche f\u00fcr\n\u00d6sterreich</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "ORW", "<em> The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong</em> \n</tr>\n<tr>", "PES", "<em>Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint / Psychologie vom\nempirischen Standpunkt</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "USE", "<em>Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "ZP", "<em>\u00dcber die Zukunft der Philosophie</em> \u2013 quoted\nfrom the 1929 ed. </tr>\n</table>\n<h4><a name=\"german\">Works (in German)</a></h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li><em>Die Abkehr vom Nichtrealen.
