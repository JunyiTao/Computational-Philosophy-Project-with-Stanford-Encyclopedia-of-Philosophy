Others maintain that at least some\ntypes of thinking (and hence some concepts) occur in the internal\nsystem of representation constituting our natural language competence\n(Carruthers 1996, 2002, Spelke 2003) or that natural language augments\nour concepts in significant ways (Lupyan 2012).\n\nThe arguments for deciding between these two positions involve a\nmixture of theoretical and empirical considerations. Proponents of the\nfirst view have claimed that language is ambiguous in ways that\nthought presumably is not. For example, the natural language sentence\neveryone loves someone could be interpreted to mean that for\neach person, there is some person that they love, or to mean that\neveryone loves one and the same person (Pinker 1994). Proponents of\nthe first view have also argued that since language itself has to be\nlearned, thought is prior to language (Fodor 1975; Pinker 1994). A\nthird and similar consideration is that people seem to be able\nformulate novel concepts which are given a linguistic label later; the\nconcept comes first, the linguistic label second (Pinker 1994).\n\nProponents of the alternative view\u2014that some thinking occurs in\nlanguage\u2014have pointed to the phenomenology of thought. It\ncertainly seems as if we are thinking in language when we\n\u201chear\u201d ourselves silently talking to ourselves (Carruthers\n1996; see also Langland-Hassan & Vicente 2018 on the nature and\nsignificance of inner speech). Another type of consideration that\nproponents of this view highlight is the finding that success on\ncertain tasks (e.g., spatial reorientation that relies on combining\nlandmark information with geometrical information) is selectively\nimpaired when the linguistic system is engaged but not when comparable\nattention is given to non-linguistic distractors. The suggestion is\nthat solving these tasks requires thinking in one\u2019s natural\nlanguage and that some of the crucial concepts must be couched\nlinguistically (Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, & Katsnelson 2001;\nShusterman & Spelke 2005; Carruthers 2002; see also Gleitman &\nPapafragou 2012 for a critical overview of a range of tasks where\nonline processing has been thought to rely on linguistic\nrepresentation).\n",
