    "main_text": "\n\nMany of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in\nordinary\u2014or at least extra-philosophical\u2014language.\nPerception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.\nBut the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of\nart. Its uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather\ndistorted way, from the philosophical senses. (Such expressions as\n\u2018a person of substance\u2019 or \u2018a substantial\nreason\u2019 would be cases of this. \u2018Illegal substances\u2019\nis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss\n\u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of\nobject, or thing when this is contrasted with\nproperties or events. But such \u2018individual substances\u2019 are\nnever termed \u2018substances\u2019 outside philosophy.\n\nThere could be said to be two rather different ways of characterising\nthe philosophical concept of substance. The first is the more\ngeneric. The philosophical term \u2018substance\u2019 corresponds to\nthe Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted\nvia the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that\nstands under or grounds things\u2019. According to the generic sense,\ntherefore, the substances in a given philosophical system are those\nthings that, according to the system, are the foundational or\nfundamental entities of reality. Thus, for an atomist, atoms are the\nsubstances, for they are the basic things from which everything is\nconstructed. In David Hume\u2019s system, impressions and ideas are\nthe substances, for the same reason. In a slightly different way,\nForms are Plato\u2019s substances, for everything derives its\nexistence from Forms. In this sense of \u2018substance\u2019 any\nrealist philosophical system acknowledges the existence of substances.\nProbably the only theories which do not would be those forms of\nlogical positivism or pragmatism that treat ontology as a matter of\nconvention. According to such theories, there are no real facts about\nwhat is ontologically basic, and so nothing is objectively\nsubstance.\n\nThe second use of the concept is more specific. According to this,\nsubstances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some\nphilosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not. On this\nuse, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even\nthough they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes\n\u2018being\u2019 for\u2014his world. According to this usage, it\nis a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or\nsomething else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of\nindividual thing or object, which contrast mainly\nwith properties and events. The issue is how we are to understand the\nnotion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct\nunderstanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be\ncharacterised in more fundamental terms. Whether, for example, an\nobject can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties,\nor a series of events.\n",
