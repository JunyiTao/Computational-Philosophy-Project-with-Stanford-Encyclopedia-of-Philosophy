    "main_text": "\n\nContemporary interest in the idea that there is a psychologically real\nand philosophically important distinction between moral judgments and\nconventional judgments can be traced to the work of psychologist\nElliot Turiel. Starting in the 1970s, Turiel and his collaborators\nborrowed some ideas from philosophers who had written on the nature of\nmorality and convention, and conducted a series of experiments\ndemonstrating that young children react very differently when asked\nabout prototypical moral transgressions, like one child hitting\nanother, and prototypical conventional transgressions, like wearing\npajamas to school. On the basis of this work, Turiel proposed and\ndefended a definition of morality according to which moral\ntransgressions involved harm, injustice, or the violation of rights.\nOther researchers, notably Richard Shweder and Jonathan Haidt, argued\nthat Turiel\u2019s definition \u201cdoes not travel well\u201d,\nbecause people in non-Western cultures treat a much wider range of\ntransgressions as moral. This led to an ongoing debate about the\nextent to which moral cognition differs across cultures.\n\nDuring the last two decades, philosophers have become increasingly\ninterested in the empirical and theoretical work of Turiel and his\ncritics. Some philosophers have argued that Turiel\u2019s findings\nsupport moral nativism. Other philosophers have invoked work in the\nTuriel tradition in debates over moral sentimentalism, moral\ninternalism, and the moral responsibility of psychopaths.\n\nSections 1 and 2 discuss some of the philosophical precursors of\nTuriel\u2019s work. Sections 3 thru 10 discuss the empirical\nfindings, debates about their empirical implications, and\nphilosophical arguments about how they are best interpreted. Section\n11 surveys the philosophical arguments that have invoked work in the\nTuriel tradition.\n",
