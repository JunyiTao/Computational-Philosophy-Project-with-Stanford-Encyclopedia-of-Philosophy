    "main_text": "Combining These Three Sources into a Concept of Causation in the Law || Skeptical approaches to the cause-in-fact requirement\n5.2 Skeptical approaches to the cause-in-fact requirement\n\nLegal theory, like philosophy, has had its share of skeptics about\ncausation. Most of such legally located skepticism has been directed\nat the proximate cause half of the conventional two-part definition of\ncausation in the law. As we shall see shortly, such skepticism there\nconsiders \u201cproximate cause\u201d a misnomer and\nreinterprets the proximate cause requirement in noncausal, policy\nterms. More radical is the skepticism here considered. Some legal\ntheorists are skeptical of there being any natural relation in the\nworld named by \u201ccausation\u201d. This skepticism includes what\nthe law names \u201ccause in fact\u201d as well as \u201cproximate\ncause\u201d.\n\nBefore we describe such skepticisms in legal theory, we do well to be\nsure we have a firm grasp on what skepticism about causation is. Take\nDavid Hume, often listed as a skeptic about causation. Hume famously\nidentified singular causal relations as spatiotemporally located\ninstances of causal laws, and he identified causal laws as no more\nthan uniformity in sequence between types of events. Hume was thus\ndoubly a reductionist about the causal relation, reducing it\nultimately to regular concurrence. In this, he is commonly said to be\na skeptic.\n\nBecause Hume\u2019s analysis takes \u201cthe glue\u201d out of the\ncausal relation\u2014a cause doesn\u2019t make its effect\noccur, it is only regularly followed by its effect\u2014it is\ncommonly classified as skeptical. And in a sense it is, if one treats\nthe making-things-happen \u201cglue\u201d to be essential to any\nrelation properly called \u201ccausal\u201d. But Hume\u2019s views\nare not radical enough to count as skeptical in the sense intended by\nlegal theoreticians. For Hume gives what Saul Kripke calls a\n\u201cskeptical solution\u201d to the problem of causation (1982:\n66\u201368): Hume doesn\u2019t deny that causation exists, but he\nreduces it to something less ontologically queer than\n\u201cglue\u201d.\n\nA better model of the radical skepticism here considered is the\n\u201cascriptivist\u201d views that Herbert Hart once held (but\nlater repudiated). In a famous analysis of our usage of the causative\nverbs of action such as \u201cA hit B\u201d, Hart\nurged that we describe no natural relations (such as that\nA caused there to be contact on B\u2019s body), but\nrather we ascribe responsibility to A for the contact\non B\u2019s body. (Hart 1949) If this bit of pre-Austin speech act\nanalysis were true, then causatives (and analogously, more explicit\nwords of causation) would only be the labels used to express\nconclusions about responsibility. Such words would not name real\nrelations that could be the justifying grounds for attributing\nresponsibility to someone.\n\nSuch are the conclusions of the legal skeptics here considered. Such\nskeptics appear to deny that causation exists as any kind of natural\nrelation, be it a \u201cglue-like\u201d natural relation, regular\nconcurrence in nature, or something else. Because it is easiest to\napproach such skepticism historically, I shall begin with the badly\nnamed American Legal Realists (badly named because in no sense were\nthey realists in the philosophical sense), with whom almost all of the\nskepticisms about proximate causation also originated.\n5.2.1 The skepticism about causation of the American Legal Realists\n\nMost of Henry Edgerton\u2019s much-cited work details his skepticism\nabout proximate causation. Some of it, however, reveals him to have\nbeen a skeptic about the cause-in-fact requirement as well. He notes,\nfor example, that the symmetrically concurrent overdetermination cases\nwere divided into two camps by the cause-in-fact doctrines of his day:\nwhere there were two culpable actors starting fires (where\nthe fires joined to produce a larger fire burning down the\nplaintiff\u2019s house), either actor was a cause of the destruction;\nbut when only one of the fires was of culpable origin, the other being\neither natural or of innocent human origin, then the culpable\nactor was not a cause of the destruction. From such examples, Edgerton\nsuggested that the cause-in-fact requirement was (like the proximate\ncause requirement) all a matter of policy, a matter, that is,\ndepending on \u201cour free and independent sense of justice\nand\u2014perhaps\u2014the interests of society\u201d.\n\nA late blooming of this Legal Realist conclusion was the well-known\nwork of Wex Malone (1956). Malone largely focused on an issue that\npreoccupied philosophers of causation in the 1950s: the pragmatic\nfeatures by which we pick out \u201cthe cause\u201d of some\nevent (Feinberg 1970: 143\u2013147). Malone found, unsurprisingly, only\ncontext-specific, practical interests guiding such locutions of causal\nemphasis, and skeptically concluded that that was all there was to\ncausation itself. To be said to be \u201cthe cause\u201d of some\nharm was just another way of saying one was responsible for the\nharm.\n5.2.2 The skepticism about causation of the Critical Legal Theorists\n\nThe skepticism of American Legal Realism has had two intellectual\ndescendants in legal theory. One of these consists of the self-styled\n\u201ccritical\u201d theorists\u2014the Critical Legal Studies\nmovement (or \u201cCrits\u201d) whose heyday was in the 1970s and\n1980s in America. Much of this movement\u2019s skepticism is simply\nwarmed-over postmodernism, itself a passing fashion in many\ndisciplines besides law (Moore 1989). More interesting intellectually\nwere criticisms that were not based on postmodernist platitudes but\nwere specific to causation.\n\nMark Kelman\u2019s skepticism was of this latter kind. Kelman urged\nthat all causal requirements in the law were part of the\n\u201cliberal myth\u201d of objective criteria for liability, but\nrather than reciting (yet again) the platitude of the historically\nsituated knower, Kelman actually directed arguments against the\nlaw\u2019s cause-in-fact tests, arguments denying that such tests\nmirrored anything in natural fact. Kelman accurately perceived that\nthe NESS variation of the counterfactual theory was an ineffectual\nversion of it, and he produced some of the criticisms of that\nvariation that others who are not causal skeptics have also pursued.\nFrom the perceived failure of this one variation of the counterfactual\ntheory of cause in fact, Kelman concluded that cause in fact itself\ncannot be a matter of fact (Kelman 1987).\n\nThe general, positive prescription that is supposed to flow from the\nskepticisms of the Legal Realists and the Crits is not so clear. One\ngathers that once skepticism (about causation being a matter of\nobjective fact) has removed the blinders, we can see that it is only\ninterests and policies that lead us to conclusions about moral\nresponsibility and legal liability. Presumably, then, the positive\nprescription is for us to do this openly, balancing all relevant\nconsiderations of policy in deciding who should be liable and then\ncasting those liability conclusions in terms of what was the cause of\nwhat.\n5.2.3 The skepticism about causation of the legal economists\n\nThe other intellectual descendant of the American Legal Realists on\ncausation is the law and economics movement in contemporary legal\ntheory. These theorists are seeking to show that legal rules and\ninstitutions either are or should be efficient, in the\npost-Pareto sense of that word distinctive of modern welfare\neconomics.\n\nLike the Crits, legal economists tend to be radical skeptics about\ncausation. The leading early papers on causation all express\nskepticism about \u201ccausation\u201d picking out any real relation\nin the world. On this skeptical view, lawyers are just doing intuitive\neconomics or some other policy balancing in their use of causal\nidioms, because that is all they can be doing. Shavell\n(1980), and Landes and Posner (1983) explicitly rely on Edgerton,\npicking up precisely where Edgerton began his skepticism, in the\nliability rules for symmetrically concurrent overdetermination\ncases.\n\nLike other skeptics about causation, the legal economists do not rest\ncontent in their demythologizing of the metaphysics of causation. Such\neconomists also have a more positive account of what should be made of\nthe law\u2019s causation-drenched requirements for liability. The\npositive, reconstructive prescriptions of the law and economics\ntheorists differ from those of the Crits and the Legal Realists in\nthat the policy favored is much more specific: liability (including\nthe supposedly causal requirements for liability) should give\nincentives for efficient behavior. Yet unnoticed by the economists was\nthat this monistic policy focus on efficiency made their causal\nskepticism unnecessary and beside the point in their recommendations\nabout what \u201ccause\u201d should mean in law.\n\nThis is because if efficiency is the normative polestar for both tort\nand criminal law, then there is a basis for denying the relevance of\nthe metaphysics of causation to the interpretation of legal usages of\n\u201ccause\u201d that does not depend on any skepticism about that\nmetaphysics. Such a basis begins with the quite correct insight that\nlegal texts are to be interpreted in light of the purposes (values,\nfunctions, \u201cspirit, \u201cmischief\u201d, etc.) such texts\nserve. Often such purposes will justify an interpreter in holding the\nlegal meaning of a term to be quite different from its ordinary\nmeaning in non-legal English. Whether this is so in the case of the\nlegal uses of \u201ccause\u201d depends on what one takes to be the\npurpose of those legal texts that use \u201ccause\u201d. Consider\nAmerican tort law.. Following the welfare economics of A. C. Pigou\n(1920), it was for a time fashionable to think that the purpose of\nliability rules in tort law was to force each enterprise or activity\nwithin an economy to pay its \u201ctrue costs\u201d. Those costs\nincluded damage caused to others by the activity as much as they\nincluded traditional cost items of production like labor, raw\nmaterials, and capital. The thought was that only if each enterprise\npaid its true costs would the goods or services produced by that\nenterprise be correctly priced, and only if such correct pricing\noccurred would markets achieve an efficient allocation of resources.\nThis came to be known as \u201centerprise liability\u201d in the\ntort law theory of 1950s America (Calabresi 1961).\n\nIf the point of tort law were to achieve an efficient allocation of\nresources, and if such efficiency could be achieved only by\ndiscovering the \u201ctrue costs\u201d of each activity when such\ncosts are defined in terms of that activity\u2019s harmful effects,\nthen \u201ccause\u201d as used in tort liability rules should mean\nwhatever the metaphysics of causation tells us the word means. For on\nthis theory it is the harmful effects that an activity really causes\nthat are the true costs for that activity; and this rationale thus\ndemands a robust use of some metaphysical view about causation.\n\nThis Pigouvian view of tort law has given way to the post-1960 view of\nRonald Coase: tort law indeed exists in order to achieve an efficient\nallocation of resources, yet such efficiency will be achieved whether\ntort liability tracks causal responsibility or not. Coase\u2019s\nessential insight was that to economically rational actors opportunity\ncosts are real costs too, so that a forgone opportunity to accept a\npayment in lieu of causing another person some harm already forces the\nharm-causer to \u201cinternalize\u201d all costs of his activities.\nSuch a harm-causer need not be liable for such harms in order to have\nhim pay for the \u201ctrue costs\u201d of his activity; he already\n\u201cpays\u201d by forgoing the opportunity to be bought off by the\nsufferer of the harm. As each harm-causer and harm-sufferer decides on\nthe desired level of his activity, he will thus take into account all\neffects of his interaction without a cause-based tort liability\nforcing him to do so (Coase 1960).\n\nOn this Coasean analysis of tort law, there is simply no need for\nliability to turn on causation. Rather, either tort liability is\nirrelevant to efficient resource allocation (in a world of low\ntransaction costs), or tort liability should be placed on the cheapest\ncost-avoider (in a world where transaction costs are high) in order to\ninduce that person to take the cost-effective precautions. In either\ncase, legal liability should not track causal responsibility, for even\nwhen there are high transaction costs the causer of a harm need not be\nthe cheapest cost-avoider for that kind of harm.\n\nThe irrelevance of causation to the giving of efficient incentives has\nleft economists struggling to make sense of the cause-in-fact\nrequirement of criminal law and tort liability rules. Since no\nmetaphysical reading of \u201ccause\u201d is appropriate to the goal\nof efficiency, some policy calculus is given as the legal meaning of\n\u201ccause\u201d. Such policy calculus typically generates a\nprobabilistic interpretation of \u201ccause\u201d, so that any\nactivity that raises the conditional probability of some harm that has\noccurred is said to have \u201ccaused\u201d that harm (Calabresi\n1975). For any theory seeking to use the law to give incentives to\nefficient behavior in a world of high transaction costs, this\nprobabilistic interpretation is seemingly just what is required. To\ncriticize such probabilistic interpretation of legal cause on the\nground that probability is a poor metaphysical account of what\ncausation is (Wright 1985a, 1987), would thus be beside the\npoint\u2014so long as one adheres to the economists\u2019\nutilitarian views about the proper function of the concept of\ncausation in the law.\n5.3 The variety of proximate cause tests in the law\n\nIt was useful in taxonomizing the seven variations of the\ncounterfactual test to show how such variations were produced in\nresponse to problems perceived to exist for the first variation, which\nwas the simple, unmodified counterfactual test. While there is no test\nof proximate causation that is comparably dominant in law (even if\nonly in lip service) to the counterfactual test of cause-in-fact, it\nis nonetheless useful to display the various proximate cause tests as\nthey react to problems in other tests of proximate causation. Some\ndiscussion of standard problems with each version of the tests within\nlegal theory is thus included as we describe what motivates others of\nthe tests. \n\nThe basic taxonomizing principle here is to separate tests that do not\nview proximate causation as having anything to do with real causal\nrelations (the conventional view within legal theory) from tests that\nare motivated by the contrary thought. We shall begin with the former\nkind of test, what should be called policy-based proximate cause\ntests. Policy-based proximate cause tests are themselves usefully\ndivided into two camps. Some\u2014general policy tests\u2014are\njustified by their service of a wide range of policies, indeed, as\nwide as are the policies that justify liability at all in torts or\ncriminal law. By contrast, other tests are in the service of only one\npolicy: the measurement of the culpability of the actor in terms of\nthe mental state she had or should have had as she acted.\n\nBeginning with the general policy-based proximate cause tests: the\nfirst of these are what we may call \u201cad hoc policy\ntests\u201d. The idea is that courts balance a range of policies in\neach case that they adjudicate where a defendant has been found to\nhave caused-in-fact a legally prohibited harm. They may balance\ncertain \u201csocial interests\u201d, like the need for deterrence,\nwith certain \u201cindividual interests\u201d, like the unfairness\nof surprising a defendant with liability (Edgerton 1924). Courts then\ndecide wherever such balance leads. Whatever decision is reached on\nsuch case-by-case policy balancing is then cast in terms of\n\u201cproximate\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d cause. Such labels are\nsimply the conclusions of policy balances; the labels have nothing to\ndo with causation in any ordinary or scientific sense (Green\n1929).\n\nThe second sort of test here is one that adopts general rules of legal\ncausation. Such rules are adopted for various policy reasons also\nhaving nothing to do with causation, but such rules differ from the\nad hoc test by their eschewal of case-by-case balancing;\nrather, it is the per se rules of legal causation that are\nadopted for policy reasons. Thus, at common-law the rule for homicide\nwas that death must occur within a year and a day of the\ndefendant\u2019s harmful action, else he could not be said to have\nlegally caused the death. Analogously, the last wrongdoer rule of both\ntorts and criminal law held that when a single victim is mortally\nwounded by two or more assailants, acting seriatim over time and not\nin concert, only the last wrongdoer could be said to be the legal\ncause of the death. As a third example, tort law for a time observed\nwhat was called a \u201cfirst house rule\u201d, according to which a\nrailroad whose negligently emitted sparks burned an entire town was\nonly liable for the house or houses directly ignited by its sparks,\nnot for other houses ignited by the burning of those first burnt\nhouses (Ryan v. New York Central RR). There is no pretense of\nmaking truly causal discriminations by such rules; rather, such rules\nwere adopted for explicit reasons of legal policy. The first house\nrule, for example, was said to be justified by the policy of\nsubsidizing the then developing railroad industry by protecting it\nfrom a liability that was thought to be potentially ruinous in its\nextent.\n\nThe main problem with both ad hoc and rule-based policy tests\ndoes not lie with their \u201cfunctionalist\u201d approach (Cohen\n1935; 1937). to legal concepts such as causation, for we should always\nask after the purpose of the rule or institution in which a concept\nfigures in order to ascertain its legal meaning. Yet for anyone who\nthinks that criminal law and torts have dominant, justice-oriented\npurposes, the open-endedness of these policy tests will be\ndisqualifying. If retributive justice is the value served by criminal\nlaw, and if such justice requires that we grade punishment\nproportionately to causation, then criminal law\u2019s proximate\ncause tests should aid in finding when offenders really cause a harm.\nAnalogously, a tort law that uses causation to mark out those owing\nduties of corrective justice will limit those owing such duties of\ncompensation to those who have really caused the harms for which\ncompensation is sought. On such a view of tort law, proximate\ncausation should aid in separating those who really have caused a harm\nfrom those who have not. To serve both retributive and corrective\njustice, thus, the last thing one wants to do is to define legal\ncausation so that the label names a balance of values rather than the\nfactual state of affairs (real causation) that determines moral\nblameworthiness. The Legal Realists\u2019 explicit policy tests are\nanathema to any justice-oriented scheme of punishment or of\ncompensation.\n\nThis problem does not so obviously infect the next two policy-based\nproximate cause tests, the foreseeability and the harm-within-the-risk\ntests. For those tests do seek to describe a factual state of affairs\nthat plausibly determines both moral blameworthiness and connects a\ndefendant\u2019s culpability to particular harms. These tests are\nthus serving the kinds of policies that must be served by the concept\nof causation in justice-oriented theories of criminal law and of\ntorts. Their novelty lies in their relocation of how and where legal\ncausation determines fault. On these theories, \u201clegal\ncause\u201d is not a refinement of an admitted desert-determiner,\ntrue causation; it is rather a refinement of another admitted\ndesert-determiner, culpable state of mind.\n\nConsider first the well-known foreseeability test. Unlike the case\nwith the rule-based policy tests, here there is no multiplicity of\nrules for specific situations (like long drawn out processes of death,\nintervening wrongdoers, railroad fires, etc.). Rather, there is one\nrule universally applicable to all criminal and tort cases: was it\nforeseeable to a defendant at the time that she acted that her act\nwould cause the harm that it in fact caused? (Green 1967). This\npurportedly universal test for legal causation is usually justified by\none of two policies: either the unfairness of punishing (or extracting\ncompensation from) someone for harms that they could not foresee, or\nthe inability to gain any deterrence by sanctioning such actors (since\nthe threat value of tort or criminal law sanctions is commonly thought\nto be nonexistent for unforeseeable violations of liability\nrules).\n\nSome jurisdictions restrict the foreseeability test to one kind of\nsituation. When some human action or natural event intervenes between\nthe defendant\u2019s action and the harm, the restricted test asks\nnot whether the ultimate harm to the victim was foreseeable but\nrather, whether that intervening action or event was foreseeable to\nthe defendant when he acted. This restricted foreseeability test is\nlike the restricted rules we saw before and is unlike the universal\ntest of legal causation the foreseeability test usually purports to\nbe.\n\nPrecisely because it is a culpability test, the foreseeability test\nbecomes subject to its own policy-based objection. The objection is\nthat of redundancy. Why should we ask two culpability\nquestions in determining blameworthiness? After we have satisfied\nourselves that a defendant is culpable\u2014either because she\nintended or foresaw some harm, or because she was unreasonable in not\nforeseeing some harm, the foreseeability test bids us to ask\n\u201cWas the harm foreseeable?\u201d This is redundant, because any\nharm intended or foreseen is foreseeable, and any harm foreseeable\nenough to render an actor unreasonable for not foreseeing it, is also\nforeseeable.\n\nThe only way the foreseeability test avoids redundancy is by moving\ntoward the other alternative here, the harm-within-the-risk test. That\nis, the law could have said that in situations where the defendant was\nculpable in intending, foreseeing, or unreasonably risking some harm\ntype H, but what his act in fact caused was an instance of harm\ntype J, one should ask whether J was foreseeable, a\ndifferent question than the one asked and answered as a matter of\nmens rea (which was about H). Of course, H must\nbe \u201cclose\u201d to J for there to be a mind guilty with\nrespect to the harm for which responsibility is sought. Yet this is to\ndo the work of the harm-within-the-risk test, which is to solve what\nshould be called the \u201cfit problem\u201d of mens rea\n(fitting the harm actually done, J, to the harm foreseen,\nintended, or risked, H; Moore 2011a). Moreover, it is to do such work badly.\nForeseeability is not the right question to ask in order to fit the\nharm in fact caused by a defendant to the type of harm with respect to\nwhich she was culpable (either because she intended to achieve, or\nforesaw that she would cause, or unreasonably risked achieving, such a\nharm). If to avoid redundancy the foreseeability test is to be\nrestricted to this non-redundant work, it is better abandoned for the\nharm-within-the-risk test.\n\nLet us examine, then, this fourth policy-based proximate cause test,\nthe misleadingly labeled \u201charm-within-the-risk\u201d test. Like\nthe foreseeability test, this test purports to be a test of legal\ncause that is universally applicable to all tort and criminal cases.\nThis test, too, is justified on policy grounds and does not pretend to\nhave anything to do with factual or scientific causation. Doctrinally,\nhowever, the test differs from a simple foreseeability test.\n\nConsider first the arena from which the test takes its name, which is\nfrom crimes or torts of risk creation. If the defendant is\ncriminally charged with negligent homicide (or wrongful death in\ntorts), for example, this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk that made the actor\u2019s action negligent. If it\nwas negligent to drop a can of nitroglycerin because it might explode\nand kill the victim, but instead it kills him by cutting his toe and\ncausing him to bleed to death, then the harm that happened (bleeding)\nwas not within the risk of harm (explosion) that made it negligent to\ndrop the can (American Law Institute 1934). Similarly, if the charge\nis manslaughter (for which consciousness of the risk is required in\nsome jurisdictions), this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk the awareness of which made the defendant\u2019s\naction reckless.\n\nExtension of this test to non-risk-creation crimes or torts requires\nsome modification. For crimes or torts of strict liability, where no\nmens rea is required, the test requires that the harm that\nhappened be one of the types of harms the risk of which motivated the\nlawmaker to prohibit the behavior. For torts or crimes requiring\nknowledge (or \u201cgeneral intention\u201d) for their mens\nrea, the test asks whether the harm that happened was an instance\nof the type of harm the foresight of which by the defendant made her\nculpable. For torts or crimes requiring purpose (or \u201cspecific\nintent\u2019) for their mens rea, the test asks whether the\nharm that happened was an instance of the type of harm intended by the\ndefendant which intention made him culpable.\n\nWhat motivates all of these variations of the harm-within-the-risk\ntest is the following insight: when assessing culpable mens\nrea, there is always a \u201cfit problem\u201d. Suppose a defendant\nintends to hit his victim in the face with a stick; suppose further he\nintends the hit to put out the victim\u2019s left eye. As it happens,\nthe victim turns suddenly as she is being hit, and loses her right ear\nto the blow. Whether the harm that happened (right ear loss) is an\ninstance of the type of harm intended (left eye loss) is what is\ncalled the fit problem. Fact finders have to fit the mental state the\ndefendant had to the actual result he achieved and ask whether it is\nclose enough for him to be punished for a crime of intent like mayhem.\n(If it is not close enough, then he may yet be found guilty of some\nlesser tort or crime of battery or reckless endangerment.)\n\nThe essential claim behind the harm-within-the-risk test is that\n\u201clegal cause\u201d is the label lawyers should put on a problem\nof culpability, the problem called the fit problem. Proponents of this\ntest urge that legal cause, properly understood, is really a mens\nrea doctrine, not a doctrine of causation at all (American Law\nInstitute 1985).\n\nThe main problem for the harm-within-the-risk test does not lie in any\nof the directions we have just explored with respect to foreseeability\nas a test. The harm-within-the-risk test is in the service of a\njustice-oriented policy in its seeking of a true desert-determiner\n(culpable mental state), and it does not ask a redundant question. To\ngrade culpability by the mental states of intention, foresight, and\nrisk, we do have to match the harm done to the type of harm intended,\nforeseen, or unreasonably risked. The real questions for the\nharm-within-the-risk test are why this culpability question is\nlabelled as a problem of legal causation, and whether this\ngrading by culpable mental states is all that is or should be going on\nunder the rubric of \u201clegal cause\u201d.\n\nConsider this last question in light of two well-known sorts of legal\ncause cases. It is a time-honored maxim of criminal and tort law that\n\u201cyou take your victim as you find him\u201d. Standard\ntranslation: no matter how abnormal may be the victim\u2019s\nsusceptibilities to injury, and no matter how unforeseeable such\ninjuries may therefore be, a defendant is held to legally cause such\ninjuries. Hit the proverbial thin-skulled man, and you have legally\ncaused his death if he dies, no matter how rare his condition might\nbe. This is hard to square with the harm-within-the-risk test. A\ndefendant who intends to hit or to cut does not necessarily (or even\nusually) intend to kill. A defendant who foresees that his acts will\ncause the victim to be struck or cut, does not necessarily (or even\nusually) foresee that the victim will die. A defendant who negligently\nrisks that his acts will cause a victim to be struck or cut is not\nnecessarily (or even usually) negligent because he risked death.\n\nThe second sort of case involves what are often called\n\u201cintervening\u201d or \u201csuperseding\u201d causes. Suppose\nthe defendant sets explosives next to a prison wall intending to blow\nthe wall and to get certain inmates out. He foresees to a practical\ncertainty that the explosion will kill the guard on the other side of\nthe wall. He lights the fuse to the bomb and leaves. As it happens,\nthe fuse goes out. However, a stranger passes by the wall, sees the\nbomb, and relights the fuse for the pleasure of seeing an explosion;\nor, alternatively, lightning hits the fuse, reigniting it and setting\noff the bomb. When the guard on the other side of the wall is killed\nby the blast, standard doctrines of intervening causation hold that\nthe defendant did not legally cause the death of the guard. Yet this\nis hard to square with the result that seemingly should obtain under\nthe harm-within-the-risk test. After all, did not the defendant\nforesee just the type of harm an instance of which did occur? Because\nthe harm-within-the-risk question asks a simple type-to-token\nquestion\u2014was the particular harm that happened an instance of\nthe type of harm whose foresight by the defendant made him\nculpable\u2014the test is blind to freakishness of causal route\n(Moore 2009a: ch. 10).\n\nThe American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code modifies its\nadoption of the harm-within-the-risk test in section 2.03 by denying\nliability for a harm within the risk that is \u201ctoo remote or\naccidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the\nactor\u2019s liability or on the gravity of his offense\u201d\n(American Law Institute 1962). This language was not intended as a\ngeneral, stand-alone test of proximate causation, as it is sometimes\nconstrued to be (Dan-Cohen 1983). Rather, the language gives a\nqualifying caveat to the more general harm within the risk test of the\nModel Penal Code. Such a caveat is an explicit recognition of the\ninability of the harm-within-the-risk test to accommodate the issues\ncommonly adjudicated as intervening cause issues.\n\nSuch a recognition is not nearly broad enough to cover the inadequacy\nof the harm-within-the-risk approach. The basic problem with the test\nis that it ignores all the issues traditionally adjudicated\nunder the concept of legal cause. The test is blind not only to\nfreakishness of causal route in the intervening cause situations,\nblind not only to the distinction between antecedent versus\nafter-arising abnormalities so crucial to resolution of the\nthin-skulled man kind of issue, but the test also ignores all those\nissues of remoteness sought to be captured by Sir Francis\nBacon\u2019s coinage \u201cproximate causation\u201d. Even where\nthere is no sudden \u201cbreak\u201d in the chain of causation as in\nthe intervening cause cases, there is a strong sense that causation\npeters out over space and time. Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon\nmay well be a necessary condition for your reading of this essay, but\nso many other events have also contributed that Caesar\u2019s causal\nresponsibility has long since petered out. The logical relationship at\nthe heart of the harm-within-the-risk test\u2014\u201cwas the\nparticular harm that happened an instance of the type of harm whose\nrisk, foresight, or intention made the defendant\nculpable?\u201d\u2014is incapable of capturing this sensitivity to\nremoteness. As such, the harm-within-the-risk test is blind to the\nbasic issue adjudicated under \u201clegal cause\u201d. The\nharm-within-the-risk test asks a question that well serves\njustice-oriented theories of torts and criminal law, but it asks it in\nthe wrong place and in substitution of other questions needing an\nanswer for desert to be assessed.\n\nWe turn now from the policy-based tests of proximate causation to\nthose tests based on the view that proximate causation, like cause in\nfact, has to do with real causal relations in the world. The oldest of\nthese tests is that suggested by Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s coinage\n\u201ccausa proxima\u201d (1630: first maxim). The simple\nidea behind such a remoteness test is that causation is a scalar\nrelation\u2014a more-or-less sort of thing, not an all-or-nothing\nsort of thing\u2014and that it peters out over time.\n\nA criticism of the remoteness test, often voiced in the legal\nliterature, is that distance in space and remoteness in time are\nirrelevant to degrees of causal contribution. Examples like People\nv. Botkin, where poisoned candy went a great distance (from\nCalifornia to the victim in New Jersey), or an undetonated bomb left\nburied for many years before it explodes and injures a victim, are\ntrotted out in support of the criticism. Justice Cardozo rejoined that\nsuch criticism surely ran counter to strong community sentiment that\nspatiotemporal distance does matter to degrees of causal contribution\n(Bird v. St. Paul F. and Minneapolis Ins. Co.), but one would\nhope that one could do better than that. Spatiotemporal distance is\nperhaps a serviceable proxy for the number of events or states of\naffairs through which a cause exerts its influence on its effects, and\nthe number of events could be relevant to the degree of causal\ncontribution. This is the metaphysical view that causation\n\u201ctires\u201d through its links and that in this way the\nrelation is not fully a transitive one.\n\nA second and quite distinct kind of cause-based proximate cause test\nis the \u201cdirect cause\u201d test. Despite the name, this test\ndoes not require that there be a complete absence of any\nevent or state of affairs intervening between a cause and its effect,\nfor that cause to be \u201cdirect\u201d. Not even the ancient\ndirect/indirect distinction between the writs of trespass and\ntrespass-on-the-case in torts was this stringent in its requirement of\ndirectness (for trespass; Scott v. Shepard). On the contrary,\nchains can be sufficiently direct for the direct cause test\neven though they are quite long chains extending over considerable\nspace and time. It is only if a special kind of event\u2014an\n\u201cintervening\u201d (aka \u201csuperseding\u201d,\n\u201cextraneous\u201d) cause\u2014intervenes that the chain is\ninsufficiently direct. The heart of the direct cause test is thus the\nidea that there are these chain-breaking, intervening causes.\n\nBeginning with a series of articles in the 1950s and culminating in\ntheir massive book of 1959, Causation in the Law, second\nedition 1985, Herbert Hart and Tony Honor\u00e9 sought to describe\nthe idea of intervening causation that they saw the law adopting from\neveryday causal idioms. One can see their concept most easily in three\nsteps. First, presuppose some version of the counterfactual analysis:\na cause is at least a necessary condition for its effect, or perhaps a\nNESS condition (Honor\u00e9 1997). Second, a cause is not just\nany necessary condition; rather, out of the plethora of\nconditions necessary for the happening of any event, only two sorts\nare eligible to be causes rather than mere \u201cbackground\nconditions:\u201d free, informed, voluntary human actions, and those\nabnormal conjunctions of natural events we colloquially refer to as\n\u201ccoincidences\u201d. Third, such voluntary human action and\nabnormal natural events cause a given effect only if some other\nvoluntary human action or abnormal natural event does not intervene\nbetween the first such event and its putative effect. Such salient\nevents, in other words, are breakers of causal chains\n(\u201cintervening causes\u201d) as much as they are initiators of\ncausal chains, so if they do intervene they relegate all earlier such\nevents to the status of mere background conditions.\n\nHart and Honor\u00e9 built on considerable case-law support for\ntheir two candidates for intervening causes (Carpenter 1932,\n1940\u201343; Eldredge 1937). Indeed, it is arguable that the basic\ndistinction between principal and accomplice liability in criminal law\ndepends in large part on this conceptualization of causation (Kadish\n1985), as does the tort law distinction between \u201cin\nconcert\u201d and \u201cconcurrent causer\u201d kinds of joint\ntort-feasors. One worry for this view of causation, nonetheless, is\nthat it is incomplete with respect to the remoteness range of issues\nusually dealt with under the rubric of \u201clegal cause\u201d in\nthe law. Causation in the law fades out gradually as much it breaks\noff suddenly, and the direct cause analysis ignores this.\n5.4 Unified (or \u201cone tier\u201d) approaches to causation in the law\n\nThe problems with the conventional legal analysis of\ncausation\u2014in terms of a bifurcation into cause in fact and\nproximate causation\u2014have tempted some legal theorists to abandon\nthe bifurcation of causation in the law and to search for a unitary\nnotion of causation that is much more discriminating (in what it\nallows as a cause) than the hopelessly promiscuous counterfactual\ncause-in-fact test of the conventional analysis. Indeed, the search is\nfor a unitary concept of causation that is so discriminating that it\ncan do the work that on the conventional analysis is done by both\ncause-in-fact and proximate cause doctrines. It is far from obvious\nthat causation is in fact a sufficiently discriminating relation that\nit can do this much work in assigning responsibility. Nonetheless,\nthere are three such proposals in the legal literature, each having\nsome doctrinal support in the law.\n\nOne we have seen already in the fourth variation in the counterfactual\ntest for cause in fact. If one does not ask whether the\ndefendant\u2019s act was necessary for the occurrence of the\nharm\u2014if one instead and more discriminatingly asks whether that\naspect of her act that made her negligent or otherwise\nculpable caused the harm\u2014then one has a causal test almost as\ndiscriminating as the simple counterfactual test coupled with a\nharm-within-the-risk version of the proximate cause test (Keeton 1963;\nWright 1985b). This is not surprising, because both tests rule\nineligible any aspects of the defendant\u2019s act that does\nnot make her culpable. For the aspect-causation view, such\nculpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant\u2019s action are not\n(relevantly) the cause of the harm; for the harm-within-the-risk test,\nsuch culpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant\u2019s action do\nnot fit the culpable mental states of the defendant. Whether one puts\nit as causation (the aspect-cause view), or as culpability (the\nharm-within-the-risk view), the discriminating power is roughly the\nsame.\n\nA second unified view of causation in the law is the oldest of these\nkinds of proposals. It conceives of causation as a metaphysical\nprimitive. Causation is not reducible to any other sort of thing or\nthings, so there is little by way of an analysis that one can\nsay about it and so very little that juries should be told about it\n(Smith 1911). The one thing we can say is that the causal relation is\na scalar relation, which is to say, a matter of degree. One thing can\nbe more of a cause of a certain event than another thing.\nGiven the scalarity of causation, all the law need do is draw the line\nfor liability somewhere on the scale marking degrees of causal\ncontribution. On matters that vary on a smooth continuum, it is\nnotoriously arbitrary to pick a precise break-point; where is the line\nbetween middle age and old age, red and pink, bald and not-bald, or\ncaused and not-caused? This approach thus picks an\nappropriately vague line below which one\u2019s causal\ncontribution to a given harm will be ignored for purposes of assessing\nresponsibility. Let the defendant be responsible and liable for some\nharm only when the degree of his causal contribution to that harm has\nreached some non de minimus, or \u201csubstantial\u201d,\nmagnitude. This is the original \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test,\nas articulated by Jeremiah Smith in 1911. To the common objection that\nthe test tells us little, its defenders reply that that is a virtue,\nnot a vice, for there is little to be said about causation. Like\nhard-core pornography, causation is something we can \u201cknow when\nwe see it\u201d (Potter Stewart\u2019s language about pornography in\nJacobellis v. Ohio), without need of general definitions and\ntests (Borgo 1979).\n\nThe third and last of these unified notions of causation is\nphysicalist in its ambitions. Some theorists have thought that we can\nsay more about the nature of the causal relation than that it is\nscalar and that a substantial amount of it is required for\nresponsibility. On this third view, the nature of causation is to be\nfound in the mechanistic concepts of physics: matter in motion,\nenergy, force (Beale 1895, 1920; Epstein 1973). This test is similar\nto the substantial factor view in its conceiving the causal relation\nto be scalar but differs in its reductionist ambitions: causation is\nnot a primitive but can be reduced to some kind of physical\nprocess.\n\nThis view handles easily the overdetermination cases that are such a\nproblem for the conventional analysis. When two fires join, two\nbullets strike simultaneously, two motorcycles scare the same horse,\neach is a cause of the harm because each is doing its physical work.\nWhen one non-mortal wound is inflicted together with a larger, mortal\nwound and the victim dies of loss of blood, each is a cause of death\nbecause each did some of the physical work (loss of blood) leading to\ndeath (People v. Lewis).\n\nSuch a mechanistic conception of causation is mostly a suggestion in\nthe legal literature because of the elusive and seemingly mysterious\nuse of \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cforce\u201d by legal theorists\n(Hart & Honor\u00e9 1959). One suspects that some such view is\noften applied by jurors, but unless theorists can spell out the\ngeneral nature of the relation being intuitively applied by jurors,\nthis test tends to collapse to the metaphysically sparer (because\nprimitivist) substantial factor test.\n5.5 Summary of the differing concepts of causation in the law\n\nAs we have seen, the Anglo-American law of torts and of crimes has a\nbafflingly large number of conceptions of legal causation. Displayed\nbelow is a review of what has been described above, organized by the\nvariables discussed earlier.\n\n Conventional bifurcated test: legal causation is constituted by\ntwo distinct components, cause- in-fact and proximate causation, with\neach component of this bifurcated test having contested meanings:\n\n\n Cause-in-fact tests\n\n\n Explicitly defined counterfactual test: the defendant\u2019s\naction must be necessary to the occurrence of the harm.\n Modified counterfactual tests, where the defendant\u2019s act\nmust be:\n\n\n A necessary element of a set of factors that are together\nsufficient for the harm, where the total set of factors is itself\nunnecessary for that harm to have occurred (the \u201cINUS\u201d and\n\u201cNESS\u201d tests)\n Necessary to every detail in the time, place, and manner of an\neffect\u2019s occurrence\n Necessary to accelerations (but not retardings) of the\neffect\n Not necessary in the sense that the existence of\nthe act is necessary, so long as that aspect of the\ndefendant\u2019s action as made that act culpable, is necessary\n A \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the production of the harm,\nwhere the necessity of that act is an always sufficient criterion of a\ncausal factor being \u201csubstantial\u201d while not being a\nnecessary criterion\n Necessary to an increase in the chance of an effect\noccurring (rather than being necessary to the effect actually\noccurring)\n\n Tests for causal skeptics: cause in fact as a conclusion of\npolicy rather than a natural relation existing antecedent to law\n\n\n Ad hoc balancing of all policies (Critical Legal Studies\nand Legal Realists)\n Incentive-based policies and probabilistic tests of cause-in-fact\n(legal economists)\n\n\n Proximate cause tests\n\n\n Tests regarding proximate \u201ccausation\u201d to be a balance\nof policies\n\n\n Tests based on a wide range of policies\n\n\n Ad hoc policy balancing in each case where the resulting\npolicy balance is honored as a conclusion of \u201cproximate\ncausation\u201d in that case\n Rules justified by policy balancing, such as:\n\n\n Year and a day rule\n First house rule\n Last wrongdoer rule\n\n\n Tests based on the single policy of gauging culpability (mental\nstate) of the actor\n\n\n Foreseeability test: was the harm foreseeable to the defendant as\nhe acted?\n Harm-within-the-risk test: was the harm that occurred an instance\nof the type of harm the risk of which (or the intent or foresight of\nwhich by the defendant) made the defendant\u2019s action negligent\n(or otherwise culpable)?\n\n\nTests regarding proximate causation to be a matter of fact (about\nreal causal relations) rather than a matter of policy\n\n\n Space-time proximity tests and the petering out of causation as\nit runs through a large number of events in the chain between cause\nand effect\n Direct cause test: sudden breaks in the causal chain formed by\nthe existence of \u201cintervening\u201d or\n\u201csuperseding\u201d causes that literally break causal chains\nthat would otherwise exist\n\nTests regarding proximate causation to be partly causal and partly\npolicy: direct cause combined with the requirement that the\nintervening cause be unforeseeable to the defendant at the time she\nacted\n\n\nUnified tests: legal causation requires a natural, unitary, causal\nrelation\n\n\nAspect cause\n (above, I.A.2.d.)\n aggressively applied\nCause as a scalar primitive: the original substantial factor\ntest\nPhysically reductionist tests: cause as physical process\n\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nAlthough it is possible to hold the view that causation in the law\nshares nothing with causation in science and in everyday life (save\nuse of the same word), such a view is very counterintuitive; some\nrelation between the two concepts of causation surely exists. That\nleaves two more plausible views of this relation. A strong view of\nthis relation would be that the concepts are the same. The three\nunified tests for legal causation last considered, and the two\nmetaphysical views of proximate causation earlier mentioned, all would\nmake such a strong relation plausible. A weaker view of this relation\nwould be to regard part of the law\u2019s concept of\ncausation\u2014\u201ccause-in-fact\u201d\u2014to be the same as\ncausation in science and everyday life, but to regard the other\npart\u2014\u201cproximate causation\u201d\u2014to be the\nconclusions of policy analyses having nothing to do with anything that\ncould be thought of as causation in any ordinary sense.\n\nTo decide which version of this relation is the correct one, one has\nto adjudicate between the various competing conceptions of causation\nin the law that we have examined. To have a baseline of comparison,\none must also resolve the many conundrums surrounding the search for\nthe true metaphysics of causation in philosophy; among other things,\nthis involves hiving off all the features of ordinary usage of\n\u201ccause\u201d that are merely pragmatic features of appropriate\nutterance rather than semantic features fixing the reference of the\nterm. These are daunting tasks to be done on both sides of the\nequation. To complete them, truly the lawyer must \u201cadventure\nhimself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of cause\u201d\n(Pollack 1901: 36). For philosophical lawyers and legal philosophers,\nthat will not be a cost but a benefit.",
