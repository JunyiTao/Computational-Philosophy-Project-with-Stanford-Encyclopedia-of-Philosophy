    "main_text": "Determinacy and Large Cardinals || Large Cardinals\n3.2  Large Cardinals\n\nThe second approach to new axioms\u2014which ran in parallel to\nthe approach using definable determinacy\u2014was to invoke large\ncardinal axioms. In fact, it was gradually shown (as Solovay had\nconjectured in the late 1960s) that large cardinal axioms actually\nimply forms of definable determinacy. \n\n The result that underscored the significance of large cardinal\naxioms for the structure theory of simply definable sets of reals is\nthe following early result of Solovay: \n\n Theorem 3.6 (Solovay 1965). Assume  ZFC and that there is a measurable cardinal. Then all \u03a3\u033012 sets of reals have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n\n Given\nthat \u03a0\u033011-determinacy\nimplies the regularity properties\nfor \u03a3\u033012\nsets of reals (see the discussion after Theorems 3.1\u20133.3), it\nwas reasonable to suspect that a measurable cardinal actually\nimplied \u03a0\u033011-determinacy. This\nwas established by Martin: \n\n Theorem 3.7 (Martin 1970). Assume ZFC and that there is a measurable cardinal. Then \u03a0\u033011-determinacy holds. \n\n\n Since definable determinacy lay at the heart of the structure\ntheory, much of the energy was focused on trying to show that it\nfollowed from large cardinal axioms. The next major advance was made\nin 1978. \n\n Theorem 3.8 (Martin 1978). Assume ZFC and that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding j : V\u03bb+1 \u2192 V\u03bb+1. Then \u03a0\u033012-determinacy holds. \n\n\n(Martin actually used a somewhat weaker assumption but it is\nsomewhat technical and it would not be illuminating to state it\nhere.) \n\n In early 1979, Woodin extended this by showing that PD follows\nfrom much stronger large cardinal hypotheses. To describe this, let us\nintroduce some terminology: Suppose j\n: V\u03bb+1 \u2192 V\u03bb+1\nis a non-trivial elementary embedding. Let\n\u03ba0(j) be the critical point of j and\nfor each n let \u03ban+1(j)\n= j(\u03ban(j)). Let\n\u03baw(j)\n={sup}n<\u03c9\u03ban(j). (Notice\nthat j(\u03ba\u03c9(j)) =\n\u03ba\u03c9(j).)  A sequence of\nembeddings j0,\u2026, jn\nis an n-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence if\nthere exists a \u03bb such that \n for each i \u2264 n, ji : V\u03bb+1 \u2192 V\u03bb+1\n\n is a non-trivial elementary embedding and \n\nfor each i < n, \u03ba\u03c9(ji) < \u03ba\u03c9(ji+1).\n\n\n\n Theorem 3.9 (Woodin 1979). Assume ZF. For each n < \u03c9, if there is an n-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence then \u03a0\u03301n+2-determinacy holds. \n\n\nSo PD follows from the assumption that for each n, there is\nan n-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence. \n\n The interesting thing about these large cardinal hypotheses is\nthat for n > 0 they are inconsistent with AC (by a result of\nKunen). Moreover, there is now reason to believe that for n\n> 0 they are outright inconsistent (in ZF) (see Woodin\n(2011)). Should this turn out to be the case it would be rather\ninteresting since it would be a case where one derived structure\ntheory from an inconsistency without awareness of the\ninconsistency. \n\n Fortunately, in December of 1983 Woodin both strengthened the\nconclusion and reduced the large cardinal hypothesis to one that is\nnot known to be inconsistent with AC: \n\n Theorem 3.10 (Woodin 1984). Assume ZFC and that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding j : L(V\u03bb+1) \u2192 L(V\u03bb+1) with critical point less than \u03bb. Then ADL(\u211d) holds. \n\n\nIn fact, Woodin got much more definable determinacy than\nADL(\u211d). \n\n Still, the large cardinal assumption was thought to be too\nstrong. At this point the episode of history described\nearlier\u2014the one involving Solovay's theorem of 1965 and Martin's\ntheorem of 1970\u2014repeated itself. For in 1984 Woodin showed that\nif there is a supercompact cardinal then all projective sets have the\nregularity properties. In joint work with Shelah, the hypothesis was\nsignificantly reduced. \n\n Theorem 3.11 (Shelah-Woodin 1984). Assume  ZFC and that there are n Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then the \u03a3\u03301n+2 have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n\n As in the earlier episode, this suggested that the above large\ncardinal hypothesis actually\nimplied \u03a0\u03301n+1-determinacy. This\nwas soon established by a landmark result of Martin and Steel. \n\n Theorem 3.12 (Martin-Steel 1985). Assume ZFC and that there are n Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then \u03a0\u03301n+1-determinacy holds. \n\n\nFinally, in combination with Woodin's work on the stationary tower,\nthe following result was established. \n\n Theorem 3.13 (Martin, Steel, and Woodin 1985). Assume  ZFC and that there are  \u03c9 many Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then  ADL(\u211d) holds. \n\n\n In this way the two approaches to new axioms\u2014via axioms of\ndefinable determinacy and via large cardinal axioms\u2014were shown\nto be closely related. In fact, in subsequent work it was shown that\nthe connections are much deeper. But to fully appreciate this we must\nfirst introduce the machinery of inner model theory. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on determinacy see sections\n27\u201332 of Kanamori (2003) and Moschovakis (1980).
