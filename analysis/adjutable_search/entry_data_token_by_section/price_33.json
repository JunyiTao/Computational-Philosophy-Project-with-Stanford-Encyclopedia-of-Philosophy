    "main_text": "Belief || The Occurrence Analysis of Belief\n6.3 The Occurrence Analysis of Belief\n\nPrice\u2019s central topic is his critique of the occurrence analysis\nof belief and his defence of the dispositional analysis.\n\nPrice proposes that the traditional occurrence analysis should be\nunderstood as focusing on what he calls \u201cassent\u201d (1969:\n204ff), which can stand for an occurrence. But in order to assent to a\nproposition one must entertain it. So Price attempts to say\nsomething informative about entertaining.\n\nPrice belongs in the truth-conditional tradition which links\nunderstanding a proposition to knowing its truth-conditions, what it\nwould be like for the proposition to be true, though, of course,\nwithout linking that to the Davidsonian idea of defining truth for\npropositions. Price distinguishes between knowing the truth-conditions\nand knowing how to verify or falsify the claim in question: we\nunderstand claims of which we cannot determine the truth (1969: 194).\nPrice\u2019s problem is this: knowing what the truth of a proposition\ninvolves is simply a dispositional condition and cannot consist in\noccurrently analysing those conditions\u2014so what is involved\noccurrently in entertaining it? Price insightfully claims that it does\nnot consist in mentally encountering either a pure contentful entity\nor an abstract possibility. His best answer is that the occurrence\ninvolves an experienced state of readiness to engage in analysing the\ntruth-commitments of the proposition (1969: 200ff).\n\nFurther, entertaining a proposition p is necessary to be able\nto doubt, reject, or assert that p, as well as to have a\nconscious desire or aversion regarding p (1972: 38\u201339).\nBernecker (2010: 236) claims that \u201centertaining\u201d plays the\nsame role for Price that \u201cthought\u201d plays in Descartes\n(1641 [1984: 17]), as an \u201cur-attitude that underlies all\nothers\u201d.\n",
