Essences of Substances: Real and Nominal\n\nThe canonical definition of the real essences is given in III.iii.15,\nwhere Locke contrasts his \u2018real essences\u2019 with what he\ncalls \u2018nominal essences\u2019:\n\n\nFirst, Essence may be taken for the very being of any thing,\nwhereby it is, what it is. And thus the real internal, but generally\nin Substances, unknown Constitution of Things, whereon their\ndiscoverable Qualities depend, may be called their\nEssence\u2026Secondly,\u2026it being evident,\nthat Things are ranked under Names into sorts or Species,\nonly as they agree to certain abstract Ideas, to which we\nhave annexed those Names, the Essence of each Genus,\nor Sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract Idea, which\nthe General, or Sortal (if I may have leave so to call it\nfrom Sort, as I do General from Genus,)\nName stands for. And this we shall find to be that, which the Word\nEssence imports, in its most familiar use. These two sorts of\nEssences, I suppose, may not unfitly be termed, the one the\nReal, the other the Nominal Essence.\n\n\nReal essences are the unknown constitutions which cause the\nobservable qualities of substances, and the nominal essences are the\nabstract ideas that constitute the definitions of species or genera.\nTo flesh this out a little more clearly we must define a few more\nterms.\n\nLocke defines the \u2018quality\u2019 of any substance as \u201cthe\nPower to produce any Idea in our mind\u201d (II.viii.8).\nThere are three categories of qualities according to the mechanical\nnatural philosophy. Primary qualities are the inseparable\nfeatures of a body, e.g., its solidity, extension,\nfigure, motion or rest, number, situation, etc. (II.viii.9 &\n23). Secondary qualities are the colors, sounds, smells,\ntastes, etc., of any object. These are secondary because\nthese features of objects do not exist in the objects themselves, but\nrather are nothing but the power of the primary qualities of the\nobject to produce an idea in us of a certain kind (II.viii.10). So,\nfor example, the color of the table is not in the table, rather, it is\npart of how the matter and texture of the table (i.e., its primary\nqualities), as it reflects, absorbs and refracts light, has the power\nto produce ideas in us of that color. Finally, the tertiary\nqualities of a body are those powers in it that, by virtue of its\nprimary qualities, give it the power to produce observable changes in\nthe primary qualities of other bodies, e.g., the power of the sun to\nmelt wax is a tertiary quality of the sun (II.viii.23).\n\nWhen one creates a nominal essence, one is cobbling together a\ncollection of particular qualities\u2014from among these three kinds\nof qualities\u2014that one observes together in a substance and\nmaking that collection definitive of a species or genus. Having said\nthat, I should point out that when Locke thinks of a species\nor genus, he is not thinking of these terms as applying\nexclusively in the biological realm, but rather as applying generally\nto any possible classification scheme we create when we organize our\nworld through naming. So, for example, gold is as much a\nspecies of the genus metal as human is a species of\nthe genus animal.\n\nThe term \u2018nominal\u2019 refers to names or naming, and is used\nby Locke to indicate that classifying substances based on their\nsimilar qualities is an exercise in naming. For example, the nominal\nessence of gold is the abstract idea that constitutes our definition\nof \u2018gold\u2019, i.e., yellowish, heavy, malleable metal that\ncan be dissolved in Aqua Regia, but not in sulfuric acid,\netc. According to Locke, the nominal essence contains the properties\nthat give meaning to the name \u2018gold\u2019 and allow us to know\nwhat gold is wherever we find it. What makes the nominal essence an\nessence is that it contains both the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for something to belong to its species or genus. Because of\nhow gold is defined, every yellowish, heavy, malleable metal that\ndissolves in water and hydrochloric acid and not in sulfuric acid, is\ngold.\n\nIn this way, nominal essences are created by human choice: we decide\nwhat we want to include in our definitions of species or genera. To\nborrow from Locke, species are \u201cthe workmanship of the\nunderstanding\u201d, not of nature.\n\n\nI would not here be thought to forget, much less to deny, that Nature\nin the Production of Things, makes several of them alike: there is\nnothing more obvious, especially in the Races of Animals, and all\nThings propagated by Seed. But yet, I think, we may say, the\nsorting of them under Names, is the Workmanship of the\nUnderstanding, taking occasion from the similitude it observes\namongst them, to make abstract general Ideas, and set them up\nin the mind, with Names annexed to them, as Patterns, or Forms, (for\nin that sense the word Form has a very proper signification,) to\nwhich, as particular Things existing are found to agree, so they come\nto be of that Species, have that Denomination, or are put into that\nClassis. (III.iii.13)\n\n\nNature provides us with similarities and we create definitions of\nspecies and genera. However, no matter how dependent general names are\non our definitions, we are answerable to nature and must keep our\ndefinitions as close as we can to what nature provides. It is in this\nsense that species and genera are the workmanship of the human\nunderstanding; we take what nature gives us and we create our own\ndefinitions and taxonomical categories.\n\nOn the other hand, a real essence is an essence\nbecause it makes the object to be what it is. It is real in\nthat it does not include human choice for it to be what it is, rather,\nit is precisely as nature made it. In the case of a piece of gold, the\nreal essence for the corpuscularian is that collection of\nparticles that make up that particular piece of gold and give it its\nqualities of color, weight, electrical conductivity, malleability,\netc.\n",
