To say that a kind\nis natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that\nreflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests\nand actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often\nsuccessful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific\nrealism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies\nemployed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The\nexistence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to\njustify our scientific inferences and practices.\n\nPutative examples of kinds may be found in all scientific disciplines.\nChemistry provides what are taken by many to be the paradigm examples\nof kinds, the chemical elements, while chemical compounds, such as\nH2O, are also natural kinds of stuff. (Instances of a\nnatural kind may be man-made, such as artificially synthesized\nascorbic acid, i.e., vitamin C; but whether chemical kinds all of\nwhose instances are artificial are natural kinds is open to debate.\nThe synthetic transuranium elements, e.g. Rutherfordium, seem good\ncandidates for natural kinds, whereas artificial chemical kinds, such\nas the entirely synthetic compound bismuth germanate,\nBi4Ge3OO12, which is used in particle\ndetectors, are, arguably, less obviously natural kinds.) The standard\nmodel in quantum physics reveals many kinds of fundamental particles\n(electron, tau neutrino, charm quark), plus broader categories such as\nkinds of kind (lepton, quark) and higher kinds (fermion, boson).\nAstronomy classifies the heavenly bodies: galaxies, for example, can\nbe either elliptical, lenticular, or spiral.\n\nSince kinds are revealed by science, a science can revise which kinds\nit holds exist: phlogisticated air was regarded as a kind until after\nLavoisier\u2019s chemical revolution. A science can even question a\nwhole category of kinds, or sort and classify kinds differently as the\nscience changes and new knowlege is gained. Before being superseded in\nthis regard by the chemical elements, biological species were taken to\nbe the best exemplars of kindhood. Yet now it is somewhat\ncontroversial to state that species are natural kinds. As the world\nchanges, its kinds may change too. Rapidly mutating micro-organisms\ndemand new classification systems. Kinds in the social sciences, such\nas economics or sociology, are even more problematic, since the\nchanging norms and practices of individuals and societies may also be\nheld to be constitutive factors in kind membership, and these norms\nand practices may themselves respond to our classification of people\ninto kinds. These examples are troublesome because there is some\ntension between the existence of kinds and the mutability of the\nparticulars which are supposed to fall under those kinds. In the case\nof atoms or galaxies, the particulars under study are typically\nlong-lived and only slowly changing; viruses and economic structures,\non the other hand, are more dynamic.\n\nThis article divides philosophical discussions of natural kinds into\nfour areas: metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, and\nphilosophy of language. The metaphysics of natural kinds asks whether\nwe should think of our supposed natural kinds as genuinely natural.\nAnd if they are, what are natural kinds? And, finally, do\nnatural kinds have essences? Philosophy of science is concerned with\nnatural kinds because, as mentioned above, it is the use of natural\nkinds by the individual (\u2018special\u2019) sciences that\ngenerates our interest in them. So we may ask, whether the kinds\nappearing in our best scientific theories do indeed satisfy the\ntheories of natural kinds proposed by the metaphysicians. Philosophy\nof language takes an interest in natural kinds because basic issues\nare raised by the semantics of natural kind terms. For example, if we\nthink of naming an entity and describing it as, semantically speaking,\nfundamentally different ways of talking about it, should we think of\nnatural kind terms as functioning like names or like descriptions?\n", "toc": [{"#MetaNatuKind": "1.

The Metaphysics of Natural Kinds\n\nThe principal metaphysical questions concerning natural kinds are\nfourfold. First, are the kinds that we think of as\n\u2018natural\u2019 kinds genuinely natural? Or are our\nclassification processes more anthropocentric than that? Secondly, are\nour natural kind classifications really classifications into\nkinds? Thirdly, what are natural kinds? Are natural kinds any\nsort of entity at all? Are they basic ontological entities or are they\nderived from or reducible to other entities (e.g., universals)?\nFourthly, do natural kinds have essences?\n\nAs regards the first question, the general problem is to determine\nwhich of the kinds to which science makes appeal, if any, correspond\nto real natural kinds\u2014those existing in nature, so to\nspeak\u2014and which of these kinds are merely\nconventional\u2014those whose boundaries are fixed by us rather than\nnature. The second question builds on the first by noting that in\naddition to classifying things in a natural way, classification by\nnatural kinds, is also classification of things into kinds. What then\nis it to classify by kind? Then, if natural kinds are genuinely\nnatural and genuinely kinds, what are they? Are there entities that\nare the natural kinds, and if so what can we say about the nature of\nsuch entities? Are they irreducible, basic, sui generis\nentities (alongside, for example, particulars and universals) (Ellis\n2001; Lowe 1998)? Or can they be reduced, say to universals (Armstrong\n1978, 1997; Hawley and Bird 2011) or to clusters of properties (Boyd\n1991, Millikan 1999)? The third question asks whether there are\nproperties that might be essential for kind membership. Natural kind\nessentialists hold that natural kinds have essences (Ellis 2001, 2002;\nDevitt 2008), where the essence of a natural kind is a property or set\nof properties whose possession is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor a particular\u2019s being a member of the kind. That fact is a\nso-called essential fact concerning the kind; it is a fact that, in\nFine\u2019s terms, stems from the identity or nature of the kind\n(Fine 1994).\n\nWe can use answers to these questions to articulate the metaphysical\ncommitment of a theory of natural kinds (Bird 2018). At one extreme\nthe out-and-out conventionalist may claim that there is no natural\nsameness and difference in nature (or at least that our human\nclassifications do not capture any such natural sameness and\ndifference). Afortiori, there are no classifications into natural\nkinds, no entities that are natural kinds, and no natural\nkinds essences. At the other extreme, one might hold that there are\nnatural distinctions between things, some of these distinctions are\ndistinctions of kinds, that the natural kinds are a certain species of\nentity, that these entities are irreducible, and that they have\nessences. Intermediate views tend to be more popular. For example, a\ncommon view is that there are natural classifications by kinds, but\nthere are no entities that are the natural kinds. Some hold that view\nand accept essentialism about natural kinds, while others hold that\nview and reject essentialism.\n1.1 Natural Classifications\n1.1.1 Naturalism (weak realism)\n\nA common view concerning our so-called natural kind classifications is\nthat there are genuinely natural ways of classifying things.\nIntuitively, to group all instances of the metal zinc together is to\nengage in a natural classification, whereas to group together\nTrajan\u2019s column, the number two, and Julius Caesar is to\nclassify things in an arbitrary manner. The classifications\n\u2018cars manufactured in Germany\u2019, \u2018culinary\nvegetables\u2019, \u2018altars\u2019 are not arbitrary, but neither\nare they natural, since they reflect human interests. This view we\ncall naturalism. It is often called realism because\nof the close affinity to scientific realism; indeed naturalism may be\nregarded as a consequence or component of standard scientific realism.\nScientific realists hold that successful scientific theories represent\ntheory-independent phenomena. Thus the theoretical posits of science\nreflect natural divisions in nature; for example, the periodic system\nfor classifying the chemical elements reflects natural divisions\nbetween the elements. However, since \u2018realism\u2019 is also\nassociated with ontological doctrines (e.g., realism about universals,\nmodal realism etc.) it would be preferable to use weak\nrealism (or, as above, naturalism) to label the\nontologically uncommitted view that our classifications are often\nnatural. (We will note below that not all natural classifications are\nclassifications into natural kinds.)\n\nNaturalism need not maintain that all the classifications we in fact\ntake to be natural are indeed natural. Sometimes scientists and others\nerr in the natural kinds they take to exist. There is no kind that is\nphlogiston or phlogisticated air. Many might suppose jade to be a\nnatural kind of mineral, but it is not because there are two distinct\nminerals called \u2018jade\u2019. (See LaPorte 2004, 94\u2013100\nand Hacking 2007b for detailed discussions of jade.) Similarly,\nbiologists now believe that reptiles do not form a natural kind.\nNaturalism is the view that there are in fact natural divisions among\nthings, so that when we attempt to make a natural classification,\nthere is a fact of the matter as to whether that classification is\nindeed genuinely natural.\n\nAssuming that one is a naturalist about (some of) our classifications,\nwhat makes a classification into one of natural kinds? The following\nare often suggested criteria or characteristics of a natural kind\nclassification (some of which are more contentious than others):\n\n\nMembers of a natural kind should have some (natural) properties\nin common.\n\nThis is a necessary condition of kindhood, but not a sufficient\ncondition, for objects of very different kinds may share some natural\nproperty. As Mill (1884) remarks, white objects do not form a natural\nkind. Natural properties here are often taken to be intrinsic\nproperties. The latter claim, as will be discussed in Section\n2.1, leads to problems with biological kinds. Some, it should be\nnoted, hold that not all natural properties are intrinsic.\n\nNatural kinds should permit inductive inferences.\n\nThis is a point emphasized by Whewell (1860) and Mill (1884), and is\ncentral to Quine\u2019s (1969) discussion of natural kinds (see\nSection 1.2.1). On its own, this criterion also does not help\ndistinguish natural kinds from sets of objects sharing some natural\nproperty, and in that sense does not go beyond Criterion 1. Criterion\n2 is also a necessary but not sufficient condition on natural kind\nclassifications.\n\nNatural kinds should participate in laws of nature.\n\nThis may be considered as a stronger, metaphysical version of\nCriterion 2. It is correspondingly more contentious: if something is a\nduck, then it has webbed feet; but one need not hold that such\ninductively obtained conditionals regarding biological kinds must\nconstitute laws of nature. Even if this is a necessary condition, like\nCriteria 1 and 2, it fails to be a sufficient criterion. For laws of\nnature may concern natural qualities and quantities that do not define\nkinds (e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation).\n\nMembers of a natural kind should form a kind.\n\nCriteria 1\u20133 supply related conditions that fail to be\nsufficient for kindhood. We may expand on Mill\u2019s example of\nwhite things, which do not form a natural kind; neither do negatively\ncharged things, nor do things with a mass of 1 kg. It is not\nimmediately clear what this criterion requires, but we may say that an\nadequacy condition on a satisfactory account of what kinds are must\naddress this \u2018kindhood\u2019 question (Hawley and Bird\n2011).\n\nNatural kinds should form a hierarchy.\n\nIf any two kinds overlap at all, then one is a subkind of the other,\nor they are identical (Kuhn 2000; Ellis 2001, 2002). This is\nexhibited, for example, by Linnaean taxonomy in biology. No organism\nis a member of two distinct species or genera. If organisms from\ndifferent species are members of the same genus, then all members of\nboth species are members of that genus. (One might add that every\norganism is a member of some species and some genus. In which case,\nthe Linnaean taxonomy provides a partition into species among all\norganisms and also within each genus.)\n\nNatural kinds should be categorically distinct.\n\nThere cannot be a smooth transition from one kind to another (Ellis\n2001). For then the borderline between them could not be one drawn by\nnature but is one that is somehow or other drawn by us. In which case\nthe kinds would not be genuinely natural. This is exhibited by the\nchemical elements. Chlorine and argon are neighbours in the periodic\ntable. There are no atoms that are intermediate between chlorine atoms\nand argon atoms, for the nucleus of an atom cannot have a number of\nprotons between seventeen (chlorine) and eighteen (argon).\n\n1.1.2 Conventionalism\n\nNaturalism about natural kind classifications contrasts with\nconventionalism (also called constructivism or\nconstructionism), the view natural kinds don\u2019t exist\nindependently of the scientists and others who talk about them. John\nStuart Mill expresses the contrast thus: \u201cIn so far as a natural\nclassification is grounded on real kinds, its groups are certainly not\nconventional; it is perfectly true that they do not depend upon an\narbitrary choice of the naturalist\u201d (Mill 1884, bk. IV, ch. II).\nWhile the sciences do, it appears, employ classifications according to\nkinds, the conventionalist will maintain that the purposes of\nscientists are just one species of interest among many: others will\ninclude the interests of automobile enthusiasts, of cooks, and of\nreligious people or sociologists of religion. Conventionalists\n(constructivists, constructionists) deny that any of our\nclassifications, including those of science, are naturally privileged\nforms of classification. The classifications of botanists do not carve\nnature at its joints any more than the classifications of cooks.\n\nWe may distinguish between weak conventionalism and strong\nconventionalism. Weak conventionalism asserts that our actual\nclassifications are not, or are very unlikely to be, natural. The\nprincipal ground for weak conventionalism is scepticism about the\nability of science to uncover the natural principles of\nclassification. We may attribute this reason for conventionalism to\nLocke (1690: III). It appears (although this is a matter of debate)\nthat Locke thought that if there were real essences of species, these\nwould be found in the shared imperceptible micro-structural properties\nof things, and that there may be such genuinely natural species but\nthat science was ill-equipped to do better than speculate about them.\n(Locke also held, employing Criterion 6 above, that there would be\n\u2018gaps\u2019 or \u2018chasms\u2019 between genuine species but\nthat observation showed only smooth gradations between the kinds we\nactually employ, which therefore must be conventional.)\n\nStrong conventionalism, however, goes on to deny even that\nconventionalism is forced upon us simply by ignorance. It denies that\nthere are any such natural divisions, known or unknown. Strong\nconventionalists claim that the differences and similarities that we\nattribute to things exist in virtue of, for example, the social\nfunction of the relevant concepts rather than in natural facts. For\nexample, the concept of gender is used to mark a distinction of social\nrole. The conventionalist treats natural kinds in the same way. The\nchemical elements, biological species, quarks, neutrinos and bosons\nare equally constructed by the activity of scientists. The key claim\nis that natural kinds are constructed rather than discovered. As\nWoolgar claims \u201cthere is no object beyond discourse\u201d\n(1988, 73).\n\nHacking (1999) argues against the strong version of conventionalism\n(which he terms \u2018universal constructivism\u2019). The point of\nsocial constructivism is to reveal that some of our classificatory\ncategories and practices, though they may appear inevitable, are\nactually contingent and relative to the practice of classification in\nthe context of social institutions and norms. However, according to\nHacking, some constructed categories reflect real divisions and so we\nneed not be constructivists in the strong sense. There is still room\nto distinguish between constructed kinds that reflect real categories\nand those that do not.\n\nFor example, Hacking (1999, Ch. 5) distinguishes between \u2018child\nabuse\u2019 and \u2018satanic ritual abuse\u2019. Satanic ritual\nabuse is a socially constructed idea, but not a social kind. In the\n1990s, there was an exhaustive investigation into satanic ritual abuse\nin Great Britain after a number of reported cases. However, an\nindependent commission claimed that none of the charges were\nsubstantiated by evidence. Thus, our constructed categories are\nsubject to empirical investigation. We must establish a referent class\nfor our constructed categories. For example and in contrast, a kind\nsuch as child abuse is considered real. The emergence of the category\ncan be traced to a definite time (1961) at a definite place (Denver)\nin the discussions of paediatricians. Moreover, the reference of the\ncategory was abused children. This reference dynamically changed as\nthe idea became embedded in new legislation, incorporated in practices\ninvolving social workers, police, schoolteachers etc. (see Hacking\n1999, Ch. 5.) But, importantly real instances of the category were\nfound through empirical investigation.\n\nThe chief claim made by all varieties of conventionalism is that facts\nabout the structure of the world are in some sense dependent on human\nbeings, their concepts and their activities in society. The denial of\nthis view, which we will examine in Section 1.2, is the claim that\nfacts about the world are independent of human beings, their concepts\nand their activities, that is, that there are real independent natural\nkinds in the world. The claim that scientific facts about the world\nare dependent on human activity has been analysed in\ndifferent ways by constructivists. Kukla (2000, Ch. 3) distinguishes\n(i) material, (ii) causal, and (iii) constitutive dependence. The\nfirst, and weakest, claim is material dependence, namely that\nscientific entities are constructed by the activities of scientists in\nthe laboratory. Chemical reactions are brought about by scientists in\nthe laboratory using purified chemicals in a controlled environment\n(Knorr-Cetina et al. 1983). The resultant kinds are merely the\nconstructs of this highly artificial environment, along with the\npragmatic interests of the scientists (i.e., what they are testing for\nand the methodology they choose to use). However, it is clear that\nscientists still abstract from a complex reality and in some\ncircumstances the materials used are purifications of some naturally\noccurring materials. Indeed, material dependence is a rather weak kind\nof conventionalism and could even be made compatible with some\nversions of naturalism/realism (cf. Hacking 1983). Therefore, no\ngeneral conclusion may be drawn about the natural world and its kinds,\nfrom the fact that scientists study scientific kinds in a highly\nidealized and controlled setting. The second element in Kukla\u2019s\nthree-fold distinction is causal dependence, which occurs when the\nrelevant facts are caused to be true by the fact that they are\nbelieved to be true (e.g. belief that there will be a run on the bank\ncan cause a run on the bank, Merton 1948). Hacking\u2019s (1995)\nhuman, interactive kinds, such as person with multiple-personality\ndisorder, may be regarded as instances, where the kind and its members\nare brought into existence by the belief that there are such kinds and\npeople do belong to them. Lastly, the constitutive dependence thesis\nclaims that convention is constitutive of the physical facts.\nPlausibly, conventions exist in virtue of people holding that they do.\nWoolgar\u2019s constructivism is of the type that treats all\nscientific facts like conventions in this respect.\n1.1.3 Promiscuous Realism\n\nDupr\u00e9 (1993) promiscuous realism claims that there are\ncountless ways of taxonomizing the world into kinds. The structure of\nthe world is vastly complex and can be categorized in many different\ncross-cutting ways, according to the different theoretical interests\nwe happen to be pursuing. Nevertheless, Dupr\u00e9 insists that his\nview is not conventionalist, but rather that he is committed to\nnaturalism and realism about natural kinds. He accepts that there are\nproperties that members of natural kinds have in common, but denies\nthat these are intrinsic properties of kinds (see Criterion 1 above).\nHe also denies that there is a hierarchical structure of natural kinds\nin the world (see Criterion 5 above) and that kinds are categorically\ndistinct (see Criterion 6 above).\n\nDupr\u00e9 (1993, 28) argues that promiscuous realism about natural\nkinds reflects our classificatory practices within the context of both\ncommon sense and particular sciences. The kinds classified by common\nsense and scientific practice often cross one another. For example, in\ncommon sense we classify lilies as a certain kind of flower. However,\nin biological classification the genus Lilium comprises over\none hundred species, including bulbs such as garlic and onions.\nMoreover, species with the name \u201clily\u201d in common sense do\nnot all in fact belong to the lilium genus in biological\nclassification (e.g., Calla Lilies and Canna Lilies). Therefore,\ncommon sense and biological science provide us with pluralistic ways\nof taxonomizing lilies. Each is equally legitimate, according to\nDupr\u00e9, depending on our interests. Furthermore, Dupr\u00e9\n(1993, 38) argues that cross-classification occurs even within the\ncontext of a science. Taking the biological classification of species\nas an example, he argues that there are countless ways of taxonomizing\nspecies, depending on the model of biological systematics that is used\n(see Section 2.1 below). There are equally legitimate, objectively\ngrounded ways of classifying natural kinds. There is accordingly no\nunique way of carving nature at its joints; different systems of\nclassification are equally acceptable, scientifically, and\nmetaphysically.\n1.2 Natural Kind Realism\n\nRealism about natural kinds is the view that there exist\nentities that are the natural kinds. While naturalism about natural\nkind classifications is a matter of there being natural groupings and\ndistinctions among things and as such has no ontological commitment,\nrealism is an ontologically committed view. Since \u2018(weak)\nrealism\u2019 is sometimes used to denote naturalism, we may\ndistinguish by using the term strong realism for the\nstronger, ontological, claim that the natural divisions between kinds\nreflect the boundaries between real entities; i.e. the\ndifference between silver and gold is not just a difference between\ntwo natural groups of thing, but is a difference between two distinct\nentities silver and gold.\n\nThe traditional realism versus nominalism debate is an ontological\ndebate over whether in order to account for properties we need to\ninvoke a class of entity, universals. There is an analogous debate as\nregards natural kinds, whether in order to account for our natural\nkind talk and our natural classifications, we need a special sort of\nentity in our ontology. The natural kind nominalist may accept that\nthere are genuinely natural classifications, but will reject the idea\nthat we should invoke any object as a consequence. For example, the\nnominalist might take the world to be made up of individuals, which\ncan be classified as kinds in a natural way. But, the nominalist\nclaims, there is no kind of entity beyond the individual instances of\neach kind. The (strong) realist maintains that we cannot explain the\ndistinction between natural and non-natural classifications without\nappealing to certain entities, the natural kinds. The naturalism\nversus conventionalism debate discussed in the preceding section asked\nwhether there is a genuine metaphysical difference between natural\nclassifications and non-natural classifications; it is not obvious\nthat the naturalist, who maintains that there is a metaphysical\ndifference, is obliged to understand that difference in terms of an\nontological category of entities that are natural kinds. The analogue\nin the debate over properties is whether there is a metaphysical\ndistinction between natural properties and non-natural properties,\nbetween, in David Lewis\u2019s terminology, sparse and abundant\nproperties (Lewis, 1986). There is no immediate contradiction in the\nposition of a nominalist who rejects universals, but who maintains\nthat there is a metaphysical difference between natural properties and\nother properties. The realist in both cases argues that, ultimately,\nnaturalism (about properties and about classification) requires a\ncommitment to entities (universals and natural kinds\nrespectively).\n1.2.1 Quine on Natural Kinds and Induction\n\nQuine is an example of a philosopher who accepts, to some extent,\nnatural classifications into kinds. He holds (1969) that kinds are\nsets, so he does think that there are entities that are kinds, and to\nthat extent he is a realist. That said, his realism is minimal, since\nsets are ubiquitous entities. Any coherent classificatory principle\nwill determine a set of things thus classified, whether natural or\nartificial. Thus the ontology of natural kinds does not of itself\nexplain there being natural kinds. Quine regards the notions\nof  kind and similarity as \u201csubstantially one\nnotion\u201d (1969, 119) but denies that it is straightforward to\ngive a definition of one in terms of the other. He does consider\ndefining relative similarity thus: a is more similar to\nb than to c iff a and b share more\nproperties than a and c do. But this will work only\nif properties are less abundant than sets are (since any two things\nare jointly members of any number of sets). And Quine regards such a\nnotion of property as no clearer than the notion of kind.\n\nQuine opens his discussion of natural kinds by asking \u201cwhat\ntends to confirm an induction?\u201d (see Criterion 2 above) (1969,\n114). With Goodman\u2019s new riddle of induction and Hempel\u2019s\nparadox of confirmation in mind, Quine answers that it is the\nsimilarity or sameness of kinds between instances that permits an\ninduction: two green emeralds are more similar than two grue emeralds\nwhen one of them is green and the other blue. It is the \u201cdubious\nscientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of\nkind\u201d (1969, 116) that prompts the discussion alluded to above.\nAn intuitive notion of similarity is used in our ordinary inductions.\nAnd the force of Darwinian processes gives us some reason to think\nthat we have evolved an innate similarity space that corresponds to\nsome natural similarities. At the same time, natural science, which\ndeveloped from these primitive inductions, supported by similarities,\nis able to reveal deeper similarities that may contradict superficial\nsimilarities. For example, we have strong sense that things of the\nsame colour are objectively alike, but science tells us that there is\nno deep similarity among like-coloured things. Quine thinks that in\ndue course science will obviate the need for a general notion of\nsimilarity or kind: in each area of science more specific notions will\ntake the place of the generic notion; this is a sign of the maturity\nof a branch of science. For example, in zoology we may replace talk of\nthe similarity between two animals by discussion of the historical\nproximity of their closest common ancestor.\n\nQuine\u2019s conception of natural kinds is liberal. Not all sets are\nnatural kinds, but any set whose members share a natural property are\na natural kind. So the set of white objects is at least a candidate\nnatural kind and Quine asserts that positively charged objects form a\nnatural kind. One might wonder whether an up quark, an uranium\nnucleus, a hydronium ion, a charged water droplet, and a balloon that\nhas been rubbed on someone\u2019s jumper all belong to one kind. The\nliterature on natural kinds (cf. Mill 1884) has tended to adopt a more\nrestricted conception of kinds, although articulating that conception\nis not straightforward. This question is related to the link that\nQuine draws between kinds and what it is that confirms induction. If\none adopts the narrower conception of kinds, then one will hold that a\nlaw such as \u2018positively charged objects repel one another\u2019\ndoes not concern kinds at all, but nonetheless may be confirmed by\ninstances of objects that are positively charged repelling one\nanother. So the real answer to \u201cwhat tends to confirm an\ninduction?\u201d is not \u201cnatural kinds and their\ninstances\u201d but is \u201cnatural properties and their\ninstances\u201d. A further reason for taking this view is that\ninductions often concern relations (such as the repulsion between two\nobjects). But we do not suppose that objects that enter into a natural\nrelation form a natural kind, nor that there is a natural kind of\nordered sequences of objects satisfying a given natural relation.\n1.2.2 Cluster Kind Realism\n\nFollowing Quine, some realists have expanded upon his intuition that a\nnatural kind\u2019s members share a natural property by counting\nfamilies of such properties that are contingently clustered in nature\n(Boyd 1991, 1999a; Millikan 1999). These families of properties\ncluster together over time either because the presence of some\nproperties in the family favours the presence of others or because\nthere are underlying internal mechanisms and/or extrinsic contextual\nmechanisms which tend to secure the co-occurrence of the properties. A\nnatural kind is any such family of co-occurring properties that may be\nemployed in inductive inferences or for the purposes of scientific\nexplanation. Cluster kind realists will readily concede that,\ndepending on the case, environmental pressures may affect and alter\nthe set of properties associated with a kind over time. Therefore, in\nsuch cases, none of the properties themselves need be individually\nnecessary for kind membership.\n\nRichard Boyd (1999) considers biological species to be paradigmatic\nnatural kind clusters, where the clustering is due to a\nhomeostatic mechanism. Homeostatic property clusters (HPCs)\noccur when mechanisms exist that cause the properties to cluster by\nensuring that deviations from the cluster have a low chance of\npersisting; the presence of some of the properties in the cluster\nfavours the presence of the others. A homeostatic mechanism thereby\nachieves self-regulation, maintaining a stable range of properties. In\nthe case of species, the homeostatic mechanisms may be intrinsic (e.g.\ngene exchange within a population or developmental factors) or\nextrinsic (e.g. a species\u2019s evolutionary niche provides common\nselective factors). Since individuals inherit their basic\ncharacteristics from their parents, and very few people are taller\nthan 2.5m, we can expect the next generation to contain few people of\nthat height. Height can, however, be affected by environmental\nfactors; a mutation can cause offpring to have genes different from\ntheir parents that might cause greater than usual height, and\nmalfunctioning of the pituitary gland can cause an excess of growth\nhormone. So there can be individual cases of excessive height. But\nthey will remain rare because such gigantism and acromegaly are\naccompanied by serious complicating disorders and often result in\npremature death. Consequently, these individuals are less likely to\nreproduce than others. Even greater extremes of height (e.g. 4m) are\njust not possible, since the same developmental factors would prevent\nthe individual from being viable at an earlier stage in life.\n\nColouration across a species is often uniform when it is a camouflage\nagainst predation. The more specific the ecological niche occupied,\nthe more uniform will colouration and other features be. Deviations\nwill lead to decreased fitness and will be selected against. Obligate\nmutualistic symbiosis often provides very specialized ecological\nniches; consequently certain key properties must be present in order\nfor an individual to survive. Certain beard worms, such as Riftia\npachyptila, live at ocean floor thermal vents and have no\ndigestive tract; instead they supply hydrogen sulphide and methane to\nbacteria in their trophosomes, which oxidise the hydrogen sulphide and\nmethane on behalf of the worm. As a result the worm cannot lack any\nproperty essential for the survival of the bacteria to which it is\nhost. Such homeostatic mechanisms do not preclude deviations from the\nstandard combinations of properties\u2014mutations do occur.\nHomeostasis just means that usually such mutations will not persist.\nThe rare benevolent, or even merely neutral, mutations may persist and\nflourish, in which case there will be variation and change.\nEnvironments may change, perhaps locally, also leading to variation\nand change (e.g. the famous peppered moth). Consequently, it will not\nalways be the case that property P in a homeostatic property cluster F\nis a necessary condition of an individual belonging to the relevant\nkind.\n\nOne potential problem with the HPC view account is that homeostatic\nmechanisms are not clearly delineated in the account. In other words,\nthe role of mechanisms in maintaining the stability of property\ncluster is not addressed in Boyd\u2019s original account. Craver\n(2009) is skeptical about our attempts to give a fully realist account\nof the homeostatic property clusters because conventional elements are\ninvolved in deciding when two mechanisms are of the same kind and also\nin identifying when one mechanism ends and the other begins. Tobin\n(2017) argues that there is an overlapping problem for mechanisms\nwhich is similar the overlapping problem often discussed in the\nnatural kinds literature.\n\nSlater (2015) claims that the HPC view can be made clearer by focusing\non the special sort of stability a cluster of properties might makes\nit successful for inductive and explanatory purposes, in favour of an\nappeal to mechanisms. Slater calls this view the Stable Property\nCluster account of natural kinds.\n\nIn such cases, the boundaries of the natural kind are vague. Cluster\nkinds nevertheless do form a kind (Criterion 4 above). Members will\nhave at least some properties in common (Criterion 1). Since the\nemergence of cluster kinds is not entirely random and a\ncausal-historical account can be provided in virtue of stable\nhomeostatic mechanisms, cluster kinds are sufficiently robust to\nsupport induction (Criterion 2) and perhaps even laws of nature in\nsome cases (Criterion 3). Conversely, because the boundaries between\nnatural kinds are vague, a cluster kind realist will reject the claim\nthat natural kinds are categorically distinct (Criterion 6). She may\nbe neutral on whether they always form hierarchies (Criterion 5). That\nsaid, not all clusters need exhibit the flexibility and vagueness of\nthese biological, homeostatic cases. In other cases the clustering may\nbe directly due to the laws of nature. Thus the laws of physics rule\nout fractional nuclear charge, with the consequence that the chemical\nelements are kinds that have clearly defined boundaries and nuclear\ncharge is a necessary and sufficient condition of kind membership.\n\nChakravarrty (forthcoming) argues that natural kind realism has run\nits course and that attempts to be more liberal about multifarious\nnatural kinds have meant that more recent natural kind realist\naccounts dissolve into conventionalism. Alternatively, many more\nrecent realist account of natural kinds attempt to cling on to natural\nkind realism by buttressing it to other forms of realism. For example,\ntheorist have identified what is (mind-independently) real with other\nthings (property clusters, correlations, mechanisms, structures and so\non). According to Chakravarrty this is to conflate sui\ngeneris natural kind realism with other kinds of realism (e.g.\nrealism about property clusters or realism about mechanisms).\n1.2.3 Fundamentalism and Reductionism\n\nAs mentioned above (introduction to Section 1.2), natural kind realism\nmay be understood as an analogue of realism about universals. A\nfurther question is whether these are simply analogues or in fact\nrelated positions. Perhaps natural kinds just are (a species of)\nuniversals or are reducible to universals. Within realism, that\nreductionist view can be contrasted with natural kind\nfundamentalism, which holds that not only are there natural\nkinds (as entities), but also that natural kinds find a basic and\nsui generis place in our ontology. We illustrate three\npositions within naturalism about natural kinds: (i) naturalism\nwithout (strong) realism; reductionist realism; fundamentalist\nrealism.\n\nAccording to David Armstrong (1997, 67\u20138) \u201cThe kinds mark\ntrue joints in nature. But it is not clear that we require an\nindependent and irreducible category of universal to accommodate the\nkinds\u201d. Armstrong\u2019s view is naturalistic, since there are\ngenuine natural divisions; but he is also resistant to realism. If\nthere were natural kinds they would be universals. But the properties\nshared by all and only the members of a kind will typically be very\ncomplex. For example, he considers whether there is some description\nof human DNA. There may be, but it would be too complex to qualify as\na genuine universal. And there is no reason to suppose that this\ncomplex universal would do any causal or nomic work. So there is not\nsimply an identity between natural kinds and a subcategory of\nuniversals, the natural kind universals (e.g., the universal of\nbeing gold, or of being a human)\u2014according to\nArmstrong\u2019s argument there are no natural kind universals. He\ndoes concede that the case is stronger for basic kind universals, such\nas electronhood, where a few properties (the electron\u2019s mass,\ncharge, and spin) are individually necessary and jointly sufficient\nfor kind membership.\n\nHawley and Bird (2011) argue that natural kinds are complex\nuniversals. A complex universal is a universal whose parts are\nuniversals (just as a complex particular is a particular whose parts\nare particulars). In the case of the electron the fundamental\nuniversals (the electron\u2019s mass, charge, and spin) do combine to\nform a complex universal. Since an universal is wholly\nlocated where the universal is located, every entity that instantiates\nelectronhood also instantiates its component universals, the\nelectron\u2019s mass, charge, and spin. Not every collection of\nuniversals constitutes a natural kind, just as not every collection of\nparticulars constitutes a natural (complex) particular. The facts that\nexplain the clustering of properties explain why these universals\ncompose a complex one. Not every complex universal is, like\nelectronhood, precise. Some are vague, and this fact can accommodate\nthe indeterminacy of kind constitution implied by Boyd\u2019s view of\nthe clusters in the case of biological kinds.\n\nLike Hawley and Bird, E. J. Lowe takes natural kinds to be entities\n(1998, 2006a, 2006b). Thus Lowe is a natural kind realist.\nFurthermore, he takes natural kinds\u2014substantial\nuniversals in his terminology\u2014to constitute an irreducible\nontological category (one category in his four-category ontology).\nHence he is a natural kind fundamentalist. Lowe argues that\nrecognizing the ontologically fundamental distinction between\nsubstantial universals (natural kinds) and non-substantial universals\n(properties) accounts for the laws of nature in a manner that, while\navoiding the problems of a regularity account, may nonetheless do\nwithout Armstrong\u2019s second order relation of necessitation,\nitself a relational universal (Armstrong 1983, 75\u2013110). Consider\nthe law that planets travel in ellipses. According to Lowe\u2019s\naccount, this should be understood as a matter of the kind\nplanet being characterized by the property travels in an\nellipse. (One might query whether all laws can be given this form\nand so whether the fact that some general truth is a law should be\nexplained this way. For what makes planets travel in ellipses is the\nfact that they have mass and hence little to do with their being\nplanets. For example, Kepler\u2019s law is an application of\nNewton\u2019s laws, but the latter concerns quantities (mass,\ndistance), which should be understood as universals not kinds.)\n\nAs in Lowe\u2019s ontology, natural kinds play a fundamental role in\nthe ontology of Brian Ellis (2001, 2002). For Ellis the term\n\u2018natural kind\u2019 covers three hierarchical categories:\nnatural kinds of objects (substantive kinds), natural kinds of\nprocesses and events (dynamic kinds), and natural kinds of properties\nand relations (property kinds). The chemical elements and compounds\nare substantive kinds; the different chemical reactions are dynamic\nkinds; a tetrahedral molecular structure is a (structural) property\nkind (whose species include the particular tetrahedral structures of\nmethane, carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride and so forth).\nEllis is uncommitted on whether the dynamic kinds are independent of\nthe other two types of kinds; but these are independent of one\nanother. Each kind is a universal, and the three categories of kind\ntherefore form three categories of universal. Thus the substantive\nkinds\u2014the familiar kinds of thing and stuff\u2014are\nuniversals, but these are not reducible to property universals. Ellis\nnotes that laws of nature have a hierarchical structure:\nKepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion are an application of\nNewton\u2019s laws. He argues (2001, 90) that the only satisfactory\naccount of this is fact that natural kinds also exist in hierarchies\n(see Criterion 5).\n1.3 Essentialism\n\nDo natural kinds have essences? When discussing kinds and essences we\nneed to distinguish two quite different claims. The first claim is\nthat the kind a particular belongs to is essential to that particular:\nif a belongs to kind K, then it is an essential\nproperty of a that it belongs to K. The second claim\nis that the kinds themselves have essential properties: for each kind\nK there is some property \u03a6 of the kind such that it is\nessential to K that \u03a6(K). What is the logical\nrelation between these two claims? The first claim may be strictly\nconsistent with the denial of the second, but it may be difficult to\nmotivate the first without having reason to accept the second. Would\none think that some object\u2019s nature requires it to belong to\nkind K without thinking that there is some distinctive (essential)\nproperty characteristic of all Ks?\n\nThe second claim, essentialism about kinds, does not obviously imply\nthe first, individual essentialism. To see this, consider the\nfollowing two cases that would seem to show that the latter does not\nimply the former (Bird 2018). The first case is chemical/physical. A\nnucleus of neptunium-239 may undergo beta decay, in which one of its\nneutrons emits an electron leaving a proton. As a consequence the\nnucleus now has one more proton and so is a nucleus of neptunium no\nlonger but is now a nucleus of plutonium. This description is\nconsistent with the claim that it is essential to neptunium that\nnuclei of neptunium atoms have 93 protons whereas it is essential to\nplutonium that its nuclei have 94 protons. But one may also claim, as\nthe description implicitly suggests, that one and the same nucleus\npersists through this transformation. If that is so, then a particular\nhas retained its identity while undergoing a change of kind. That kind\nessentialism does not entail essentialism of kind membership is also\ndemonstrated by a second, biological, example. According to\nMayr\u2019s biological species concept, a species is a reproductively\nisolated breeding population. Thus a new species can be created by the\nadvent of reproductive isolation, which will typically split existing\npopulations (Matthen 2009). And so the existing organisms in at least\none (and arguably both) of the newly isolated (sub-)populations will\nbelong to a new species. And if species are natural kinds, this is an\nexample of particulars changing their kinds. But this account of\nspecies is consistent with the view that species have essences\n(LaPorte 1997, 2004, 11\u201312). (As a matter of fact, most\nessentialists accept that an object\u2019s kind is essential to it.\nThe point being advanced here is that this claim does not follow\nimmediately from the claim that kinds have essences.)\n1.3.1 Arguments for Essentialism\n\nIt has been widely held that essentialism, and natural kind\nessentialism in particular, is a consequence of the semantic arguments\nconcerning reference put forward by Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975a).\nThese arguments support semantic externalism, the view that the\nreference of a speaker\u2019s term can depend on facts external to\nthe speaker herself (e.g. facts concerning prior uses of the term).\nHowever, Salmon (1979, 1982) has argued persuasively that only trivial\nessentialism can be inferred from such arguments; stronger\nessentialist theses are derived only on the basis of unstated\nessentialist premises. For example, consider the following argument,\nreconstructed by Donnellan and discussed in Salmon (1982,\n161\u201375):\n\n\n\n\nP1:\nIt is necessarily the case that: something is a sample of water\nif and only if it is a sample of dthat (the same substance that this\nis a sample of). \n\nP2:\nThis [the liquid sample] has the chemical structure\nH2O. \n\nP3:\nBeing a sample of the same substance as something consists in\nhaving the same chemical structure. \n\n \nTherefore \n\nC:\nIt is necessarily the case that: every sample of water has the\nchemical structure H2O.  \n\n\n(Salmon 1982, 166)\n\n\nP3, however, is not free of non-trivial essentialist import. According\nto Salmon, deriving essentialism via the theory of reference is\nquestion-begging. Nonetheless, the fact that essentialist conclusions\nseem so plausible may be taken as evidence that there exist strong\nessentialist intuitions, and the arguments from Kripke and Putnam can\nbe framed in non-semantic terms and thereby motivate essentialism\ndirectly\u2014indeed many of Kripke\u2019s arguments are not framed\nin semantic terms at all.\n\nSeveral of Kripke\u2019s exemplary cases concern theoretical\nidentities; these are typically identities of the form C =\nT, expressed using a common name for a kind,\n\u2018C\u2019, and a technical identification of the kind,\n\u2018T\u2019, typically thereby telling us what that kind\nis. Examples: light is a stream of photons; water is\nH2O; lightning is an electrical discharge; gold is the\nelement with atomic number 79. This might give the impression that\nKripkean essentialism is just a matter of the necessity of identity.\nHowever, in several of his discussions Kripke does provide separate,\nindependent arguments on the one hand for the (necessary) necessity of\nbeing T for being C and on the other hand for the\n(necessary) sufficiency of being T for being C. In\ngeneral, where K is a kind and P is some property,\narguments for \u25a1\u2200x(Kx\u2192Px)\ncan be decoupled from arguments for\n\u25a1\u2200x(Px\u2192Kx).\n\nFor example, in his discussion of gold, Kripke argues that something\nthat is superficially like gold in appearance but lacks the property\nof having atomic number 79, would not be gold. This establishes that,\nof necessity, having atomic number 79 is necessary for being gold, but\ndoes not show that possession of this property is sufficient for being\ngold. Similarly, argues Kripke, if we were to discover a population of\nanimals with the appearance of tigers but which turn out to be\nreptiles, we would deny that such creatures are tigers. Being\nmammalian is necessarily a necessary condition of being a tiger, but\nof course not a sufficient condition\n\nPutnam\u2019s (1975a) Twin Earth thought experiment, in a\nnon-semantic guise, leads to a similar conclusion. We imagine there is\na planet, \u2018Twin Earth\u2019, exactly like Earth in all readily\nobservable respects. Every person and thing on Earth has a twin\nequivalent on Twin Earth. However, there is no H2O on Twin\nEarth. Instead, there is a liquid that shares the manifest properties\nof water (e.g., its being colourless, tasteless, odourless, good for\ndrinking, etc.). This liquid is composed not of H2O\nmolecules but of very different molecules to which we assign the\nmade-up formula \u2018XYZ\u2019. Despite its superficially\nwater-like properties, intuitively XYZ is not water. What prevents XYZ\nfrom being water is the fact that XYZ is microstructurally different\nfrom H2O. If intuition is reliable in this respect, then\n(i) possessing water\u2019s superficial properties is not sufficient\nto make something a sample of water, and (ii) being composed of\nmolecules of H2O is necessary for something\u2019s being a\nsample of water. (For more on Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought\nexperiment, see Section 4.2.3.)\n\nIt is natural to use the expression \u2018the essence of\n\u2026\u2019, which implies sufficiency as well as necessity:\npossession of the essence of K suffices for membership of\nK, as well as being necessary for it. According to the\nforegoing, not all the arguments of Kripke and Putnam establish what\nthe essence of some kind is, rather they establish only what\nwe may call a partial essence, conditions that are necessary\nbut not sufficient. This is clear in some other of Kripke\u2019s\narguments. Thus it is only a partial essence that someone originates\nwith the gamete (sperm and egg) from which they in fact originate,\nsince they might have a monozygotic (identical) twin who has the same\norigin. A further question is whether there is a full essence\n(the essence) for everything that has a partial essence.\n\nThe fact that such arguments show only that F is an\nessential property of K means that they are invulnerable to\ncomplaints that not everything with F is K. For\nexample it is sometimes complained that water cannot be essentially\nH2O for the following reasons (a) water is a liquid,\nwhereas a substance comprised of H2O can exist as a solid\nor a gas; (b) a single H2O molecule is not a sample of\nwater because it does not have the properties we can ascribe to\nsamples of water (such as a temperature); (c) water is not simply\nH2O but is a polymer-like substance held together by\nhydrogen bonds. These observations are consistent with the claim of\nPutnam\u2019s argument that necessarily all water is composed of\nH2O molecules.\n\nThe arguments so far considered show that the superficial properties\nassociated with a kind are, in those cases, not sufficient for kind\nmembership, and so some further property (often a microstructural\nproperty) is a necessary condition. Kripke also provides arguments\nthat show that many of the superficial properties typically associated\nwith a kind are not even necessary. Kripke examines Kant\u2019s claim\nthat it is a priori that gold is a yellow metal (Kripke 1980,\n118). Let us imagine that the yellow appearance of what we have always\ntaken to be samples of gold is just an optical illusion. Intuitively,\nwe would conclude that we had previously erred in thinking that gold\nis yellow\u2014we would not conclude that there is no gold.\nLikewise, one might ask whether animal species are characterized\n(necessarily) by superficially available qualities, for example,\nwhether a tiger is, by definition, a large carnivorous quadrupedal\nfeline, tawny yellow in colour with blackish transverse stripes and a\nwhite belly (Kripke 1980, 119\u2013121). Again, we may consider that\nthese features of the individual animals we have held to be tigers are\nin fact illusory; that those individuals and others of the same\nspecies are, for example, three\u2013legged but that an optical\nillusion made us think otherwise. This suggests that satisfying a set\nof readily observable \u2018superficial\u2019 properties is not\nnecessary for membership of the tiger kind.\n\nThe foregoing arguments from Kripke lead to the conclusion that the\nrelevant kinds are not characterized of necessity by the readily\nobservable properties of their instances. They do not show what does\ncharacterize those kinds. Kripke takes the view that, in most cases,\nit is certain microstructural properties that determine the\nnature of these natural kinds, as evident in his endorsement of the\nidentities: \u2018water is H2O\u2019; \u2018gold is the\nelement with atomic number 79\u2019, \u2018light is a stream of\nphotons\u2019. Such essential properties of kinds are features,\ntherefore, that may be unknown even to competent users of a relevant\nkind concept. Consequently, these are essences that, when known at\nall, are known a posteriori.\n\nWhile the arguments just considered suggest a microstructural essence\nfor the chemical and physical kinds considered, they do not have the\nconsequence that every natural kind must have a microstructural\nessence. Kripke regards material individuals as having historical\nessences. In the light of cladism in biology, one may regard\nbiological taxa as having historical essences also, and this is\nconsistent with the general picture given to us by Kripke and Putnam,\neven if they themselves once thought that biological kinds had\nmicrostructural essences (McGinn 1976; Kornblith 1993, 111; LaPorte\n2004, 64). Cladism is the most commonly accepted system of biological\nclassification that groups organisms according to their shared\nphylogenetic ancestry. Cladism has replaced the Linnean hierarchical\nsystem of biological classification where organisms were grouped\naccording to their shared morphological characteristics (see Section\n2.1 below).\n\nKripke does not distinguish \u2018essential property\u2019 from\n\u2018necessary property\u2019. Fine (1994) notes that the claim\nthat P is a necessary property of X is not the same as the\nclaim that P is an essential property of X: the latter implies the\nformer but the former does not imply the latter. The arguments for\nessentialism discussed above do not note this distinction and move\nquickly from claims about necessity to claims about essence: having\nshown that necessarily anything that is gold is made up of an element\nwith atomic number 79, Kripke concludes that having atomic number 79\nis an essential property of the kind gold. Fine\u2019s point may not\nbe an insuperable obstacle to establishing essentialism via the\narguments of Kripke and Putnam. For it may be held, as Fine holds,\nthat essences concern the nature or identity of things. One may then\nargue that the arguments of Kripke, Putnam, and others do appeal to\nintuitions concerning the nature and/or identity of natural kinds, and\nso the inferences to essentialism from claims about necessity are\nlegitimate in these cases.\n\nThe Kripke\u2013Putnam arguments for essentialism are, in effect,\ndirect appeals to intuition. For Ellis and Lowe, the dialectical basis\nfor essentialism is that essentialism is a core part of what they each\ntake to be the optimal metaphysical system. Ellis (2001, 145\u201350)\nregards his essentialist metaphysics as supported by his argument that\nit yields a stronger argument for scientific realism. In particular,\nfor Ellis the essences of natural kinds explain the laws of nature:\nlaws are grounded in the world\u2019s natural kind structure, which\nincludes not only natural kinds of thing but also natural kinds of\nprocess and event. Above it was mentioned that for Lowe (2006, 144)\nlaws concern natural kinds; by contrast, for Ellis laws are grounded\nin essential facts about kinds. As a consequence, the laws of nature\nare metaphysically necessary. This has the advantage of explaining\nwhat natural necessity is (it is just metaphysical necessity), but at\nthe cost of denying the intuitive contingency of laws. Lowe, on the\nother hand, holds that laws can be grounded in the contingent\npossession of properties by kinds, and so need not be metaphysically\nnecessary. In conclusion we note that some anti-essentialists\nargue that there is no non-question begging way of motivating the\nappeal to essences. Hugh Mellor (1977, 309) argues that the existence\nof essences in essentialist accounts of natural kinds is simply a\ngratuitous assumption. Others use examples from the empirical sciences\nsuch as biology to argue that essentialism is too limited to capture\nthe kinds we find in the special sciences (Dupr\u00e9 1981, 1993).\nIn particular, essentialist accounts of kinds seem to construe them as\nimmutable or static, whereas examples from the natural sciences\ninclude mutable and dynamic kinds, as we see in Section 2.1 below.\n\n1.4 Natural Kind Eliminativism\n\nRecently, there has been a debate about the usefulness of natural kind\nclassification in philosophy of science. Some philosophers have argued\nthat the concept of natural kinds should be eliminated on the grounds\nthat it does not play a useful role in scientific classification.\nDavid Ludwig (2018) and Ian Hacking (2007a) have argued for\neliminating the concept of natural kind altogether. The arguments here\nare twofold: firstly, the concept of natural kind is applicable to a\nheterogeneous set of practices of natural classification. The usage of\nthe natural kind concept is so multifarious that it is misleading to\npracticing scientists if they use the natural kind concept in\nscientific classification. On these grounds, the concept of natural\nkind should be eliminated. Indeed Hacking (2007a, 229) does not mince\nhis words: \u201cDelete every mention of natural kinds\u201d. The\nsecond, related, argument is on the grounds that there are so many\ndifferent theories of natural kinds in the literature, of which some\napply more readily to some scientific disciplines, while others seem\nto apply more readily in others. For example, the grounds for\nessentialism seem more warranted in chemistry, while Boyd\u2019s HPC\nview seems more readily applicable in biology. Indeed, a homogeneous\ntheory of natural kinds that would apply in all disciplines looks very\nunlikely. On these grounds, so the argument goes, the search for a\nunitary theory of natural kinds for all scientific classification is\nfutile. Conix and Chi (2021) argue that these arguments for\neliminativism do not provide a sufficient justification to eliminate\nthe natural kind concept altogether. They argue that the notion of\n\u2018natural kind\u2019 plays another epistemic role in\nphilosophical research, because it enables fruitful investigation into\nnon-arbitrary classification.\n\n2. Natural Kinds in the Special Sciences\n\nOur interest in natural kinds is generated by the fact that the\nparticular sciences make frequent use of what, on the face of it, seem\nto be natural kinds. So an important question is whether the kinds of\nthe special sciences (e.g. psychology, economics, biology, chemistry\nand so on) do in fact satisfy the conditions laid out by\nmetaphysicians for natural-kindhood (Fodor 1974; Dupr\u00e9 1981,\n1993; Millikan 1999; Ellis 2001). And to the extent that they do not,\ndoes that show that these kinds are not genuine natural kinds after\nall, but are something different? Or does it show that the\nmetaphysicians need to revise their theories of natural kindhood? The\nmetaphysical issues raised by the special sciences vary. For example,\nphilosophers of biology ask whether species would be better understood\nas being individuals rather than natural kinds. The so-called\nspecies problem (Ghiselin 1974, 1987, 1997; Hull 1976, 1978;\nKitts and Kitts 1979, LaPorte 1994) asks which are the appropriate\ncriteria to use in order to decide which particular species an\norganism belongs to. This is particularly challenging because species\nevolve over time, which makes it difficult to determine when we should\nrecognize a new species and distinguish it from a distinct, older\nancestor species or from distinct sister species. Furthermore, the\ncriteria advanced by most of the various species concepts on offer\ninvolve relational rather than intrinsic properties of organisms. So\neither species are not natural kinds or the view that kindhood is\nfixed by the intrinsic properties of things must be revised. In the\nphilosophy of chemistry, a key question is whether chemical kinds\nprovide as much support for microstructuralism as the stock examples\ndiscussed by metaphysicians suggest (Hendry 2006; LaPorte 2004;\nNeedham, 2000, 2002; Van Brakel, 2000). Microstructuralism is the view\nthat chemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nchemical microstructure. Chemical elements would appear to support\nmicrostructuralism since atomic number is sufficient to individuate\nany element. However, the extension of this view to more complex\nchemical structures (such as molecules) is much discussed in the\nliterature. In the philosophy of mind, the ontological status of\npsychological kinds has been questioned in the light of modern\nadvances in neuroscience (Churchland 1981; Fodor 1974). In particular,\naction is causally overdetermined by mental and neurophysiological\nkinds. If neuroscience can provide a sufficient account of action,\nthen the role of our common-sense folk psychological concepts, such as\nbelief and desire is called into question. Maybe\nthere are no psychological natural kinds corresponding to those\nconcepts. Natural kind realists reject the conventionalist view that\nin all cases the boundaries of \u2018natural\u2019 kinds are drawn\nby human interests. But is it plausible to draw a distinction between\ngenuinely natural and conventional kinds when it comes to the social\nsciences? In particular, is it important that, via a feedback effect,\nhuman perceptions of what kinds there are can have an effect on the\ncomposition and even existence of those kinds (Hacking 1995)?\n2.1 Natural Kinds and Biology\n\nOne central issue in the philosophy of biology concerns the nature of\nbiological species, which have traditionally been held to be\nparadigmatic natural kinds. The traditional Linnean binomial system of\nclassification groups organisms into species and genera in virtue of\ntheir overall physical similarities (their morphology). However, only\nthe taxa species and genus were held to reflect\nontological divisions in nature. The higher taxa (e.g.,\nfamily, order, class, phylum,\nkingdom) are merely conventional divisions, which are of\nheuristic use in biology.\n\nBiologists offer many different species concepts, which disagree on\nhow species are individuated; indeed the different species concepts\nwill disagree about the extensions of species and about the number of\nspecies. For example, according to the interbreeding species concept\n(e.g. Mayr 1969), species are groups of interbreeding natural\npopulations, that are reproductively isolated from other groups.\nAlternatively, according to the phylogenetic approach to species (e.g.\nCracraft 1983), species are classified according to common ancestral\ndescent. These two approaches carve species differently. Some\nphylogenetic species fail to be interbreeding species. For example,\norganisms that reproduce asexually may nevertheless have a common\ndescent. They will be grouped together as species by the phylogenetic\napproach, but not by the interbreeding approach (see Ereshefsky 1998\nfor discussion). Philosophers question whether the multiple divisions\nused by biologists reflect an ontological pluralism in the world or,\nalternatively, whether there is a privileged conception of species\nthat captures ontological reality. Furthermore, some philosophers\nargue that species are not to be considered as natural kinds at all,\ninsisting instead that species are individuals.\n2.1.1 Species: Individuals or Kinds?\n\nDespite its long history and intuitive appeal, the conception of\nspecies as natural kinds is difficult to sustain while also\nmaintaining a traditional view of what a natural kind requires: a set\nof intrinsic natural properties that are individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for a particular to be a member of the kind.\n\nThe fact that lineages evolve more or less gradually over time and\nthat this process leads to new species and other taxa, has two\nconsequences: first, that species are spatio-temporally restricted in\nthe sense that the species to which a particular organism belongs\ndepends on its being related to a specific lineage; and secondly, that\nthe characteristic properties of a species may change over time.\n\nThe first consequence of evolution implies that, contra the\ntraditional view, intrinsically identical organisms may not be members\nof the same species: a cat-like organism independently evolved on a\ndistant planet would not be a cat. (Cf. Dummett 1973: 144 \u2018even\nif creatures exactly like men arose from dragons\u2019\nteeth, they would not be men, because not children of\nAdam\u2019.)\n\nThe second consequence implies that intrinsic similarity is not\nnecessary for membership of the same species. There exists a high\ndegree of variation in intraspecific morphology and genetic makeup.\nWhile members of kinds need not be intrinsically identical (e.g.,\nthere may be isotopic variation between samples of a chemical\nelement), there will nonetheless be certain distinctive intrinsic\nnatural properties common to all members of the kind (e.g., nuclear\ncharge in the case of atoms of the same element). That, it is claimed,\nis absent for species. Thus there is no genetic material or sequence\nof genes that all and only members of the species Drosophila\nmelanogaster possess, and likewise for all other species. Nor can\nwe turn to larger-scale phenotypic properties (which may nonetheless\nbe hidden), since evolutionary change may eliminate such features\nwithout a new species arising (Sober 1980). Furthermore, gradual\nchange, even through speciation, means that species will not be\ncategorically distinct (Criterion 6), which for Ellis (2001) is an\nadditional reason to conclude that species are not natural kinds.\n\nThese problems for the thesis that species are natural kinds may lead\none to conclude that classification by species does not correspond to\nany real division of things in nature any more than the higher taxa\ndo. Darwin himself expressed this kind of conventionalism, in taking\nspecies to differ only in degree from varieties on the one hand and\ngenera and higher taxa on the other hand:\n\nVarieties have the same general characters as species, for they cannot\nbe distinguished from species,\u2014except, firstly, by the discovery\nof intermediate linking forms\u2026and except, secondly, by a\ncertain amount of difference, for two forms, if differing very little,\nare generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate\nlinking forms have not been discovered. (Darwin 1859, 57)\n\n\n(Mishler 1999 contains a modern version of this view.) The rejection\nof species as natural kinds need not lead to the rejection of realism\nabout species altogether. Indeed, one can commit to species realism in\na specific way: Ghiselin (1974, 1987, 1995, 1997), Hull (1976, 1978,\n1980, 1987), and many other philosophers and biologists accept the\nclaim that species are individuals, not kinds. This claim\nwould appear to explain why, it is said, there are no serious\ncandidates for biological laws, at least concerning members of\nparticular species (Beatty 1997). Individual organisms are\nparts of species, not members of the species-kind. Speciation\ncreates a new individual (or possibly two new individuals and the\ncessation of the preceding species-individual) but not a new kind.\nOrganisms that are parts of the same species may share common\nfeatures, but that is not what makes them parts of that species.\nRather the explanation is the reverse: because the organisms are parts\nof the same species they are parts of the same lineage and so they\nwill probably (but not inevitably) share features in common.\n\nDoes individualism about species imply that species are not natural\nkinds? One might suspect as much, but perhaps the two views are\ncompatible. LaPorte (2004), for example, believes that one can\nconsistently hold both views. Where one theorist will see a\nspecies-as-kind and an organism-as-member of that kind, another\ntheorist will see a species-as-individual and an organism-as-part of\nthat kind. And so even allowing that individualism is correct, we can\nconstruct a kind: if S is a species-individual and x\nis an organism, then x is a member of the species-kind\nS* iff x is a part of S. For\nexample, an individual organism (a radish plant) is a part of the\nspecies-individual Raphanus Sativus if and only if it is a\nmember of the species-kind Raphanus Sativus (LaPorte 2004,\n16). LaPorte\u2019s view does entail giving up on certain features\nthat natural kinds are often thought to have; one cannot still hold\nthat kind membership is necessarily intrinsic, since \u2018being a\npart of y\u2019 is not an intrinsic property and parts of\nthe same entity do not necessarily have any intrinsic properties in\ncommon. For that reason, it is also less plausible that kinds must\nplay a role in laws of nature.\n\nIf one retains the view that species are natural kinds one must\nconfront the fact that a plethora of species concepts are available\nand as seen earlier, these species concepts do not always delineate\nthe same species. For example, Mayr\u2019s (1969) biological\nspecies concept (BSC) regards a species as a group of\n\u201cinterbreeding natural populations that are reproductively\nisolated from other such populations\u201d (1969, 26). The\nphylogenetic species concept (PSC) holds that a species is\n\u201cthe smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within\nwhich there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent\u201d\n(Cracraft 1983, 170). These definitions are not perfectly coextensive.\n(For a detailed discussion of species concepts see the entry on\n species.)\n\nThis diversity may be thought to support conventionalism about natural\nkinds (Section 1.1.2). But supporters of naturalism about our\nclassifications (Section 1.1.1) will deny that the dispute in\nsystematics reflects an indeterminacy in the natural world. A\nmonist will hold that one of the existing systems is a\nsuperior account of the natural world. A commitment to one of the\ndifferent systems over another will result in a different ontological\naccount of species. The most prevalent system of classification in\ncontemporary systematics is cladistics, which classifies organisms\nphylogenetically, in virtue of shared derived features or an\norganism\u2019s place in the genealogical tree.\n\nAn alternative view to monism, motivated by the variety of species\nconcepts, is pluralism, which holds that the different\naccounts of species in systematics reflect equally legitimate ways of\ncarving up nature subject to our pragmatic and theoretical interests.\nHowever, these systems do carve nature in genuinely natural ways. The\nspecies and higher taxa that they delineate reflect real features of\nthe world from the point of view of different theoretical interests.\nPluralism (Kitcher 1984; Dupr\u00e9 1993; Ereshefsky 1992) is the\nweakest form of realism about kinds in the philosophy of biology.\n2.1.2 Biological Essentialism\n\nKripke (1971, 1972) and Putnam (1975a) use animal kinds as examples of\nnatural kinds for which a posteriori essences can be found.\nThere is some implication that these essences are microstructural,\nintrinsic properties, which will be, of necessity, individually\nnecessary and jointly sufficient for an entity to be a member of a\nkind. However, if species are individuals, then it is not true that\nspecies may be individuated on the basis of the intrinsic properties\nof their members. The various species concepts tend to offer\nrelational criteria of species membership (see above). According to\nthe BSC, for example, membership of a species depends on relational\nproperties, such as membership of a certain population and\ninterbreeding. Alternatively, the PSC refers to shared descent.\n\nHowever, Kripke (1980) himself argues that a person\u2019s parentage\nis essential to them. If that is so, then if individual S is\ndescended from N, then S is necessarily descended\nfrom N. McGinn (1976) suggests that this extends to species\nalso. LaPorte (2004) argues that essentialism holds with respect to\nfacts relating individuals, species, and other taxa to the higher taxa\n(genus and above) within which they are nested. These taxa are clades,\nthat is to say kinds defined by shared descent from a common ancestral\ngroup: an individual or group that is a member or part of clade is\nnecessarily a member or part of that clade. Thus biological kinds\n(species, genera, etc.) do have essential properties, and these are\nhistorical rather than intrinsic properties.\n\nSo one option for biological essentialism is to drop the traditional\nview that the natural properties that are essential for membership of\na natural kind are intrinsic: natural, extrinsic (relational)\nproperties can play this role (Okasha 2002). The categorical\ndistinctness criterion must be dropped also.\n2.2 Natural Kinds and Chemistry\n\nOn account of the problems for natural kinds in biology as well as the\ndevelopment of modern chemistry, chemical kinds have replaced\nbiological kinds as the paradigms of natural kinds. The chemical\nelements and chemical compounds appear to be bona fide\nnatural kinds. We refer to chemical kinds in laws, explanations, and\ninductions: that a certain item is iron explains its behaviour and\nthat behaviour is predictable; that iron objects are magnetizable is a\nlaw of nature (criteria 2 and 3 above). Moreover, we can induce that\nall iron is magnetizable, from the observation of particular instances\nof iron objects that are magnetic. And chemical kinds appear to obey\nthe categorical distinctness requirement: iron is clearly distinct\nfrom its neighbours in the periodic table (manganese and cobalt); no\nelements are intermediate kinds (criterion 6 above). Furthermore,\nmicrostructural essentialism seems to be a prima facie\nplausible option for chemical kinds: it is essential to iron that\nsomething made of pure iron is constituted by atoms that have\nprecisely 26 protons in their nuclei.\n2.2.1 Microstructuralism\n\nMicrostructuralism in the philosophy of chemistry is the thesis that\nchemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nmicrostructural properties (Hendry 2006). As exemplified above by the\ncase of iron, the chemical elements provide paradigmatic kinds that\nmay be individuated microstructurally, since the atomic\nnumber\u2014the number of protons in the nucleus\u2014suffices to\nidentify the element. It is true that macro-level chemical and\nphysical properties can also serve to individuate chemical elements,\nand in the nineteenth century chemists were able to individuate\nelements without knowing what we do about nuclear structure. However,\nit is held that atomic number has explanatory priority: the number of\nprotons in the nucleus, and hence the nuclear charge, explains the\nstructure of electrons surrounding the nucleus, which, in turn,\nexplains the chemical behaviour of the element.\n\nThe microstructuralist can extend this approach from elements to\ncompounds. Compounds are identified principally by their constituent\nelements. Thus carbon dioxide is that compound of carbon and oxygen\nwith the molar proportion 1:2. In more detail, molecules of carbon\ndioxide consist of two oxygen atoms and a single carbon atom. The\npractice of identifying a chemical compound only by its composing\nelements was the norm in chemistry, until the discovery of isomerism\nby Friedrich Woehler in 1827. Isomers are distinct compounds that\nnonetheless share the same constituent elements in the same\nproportion. Thus fulminic acid and cyanic acid may both be expressed\nin terms of constituents in the empirical formula CHNO, but their\ndistinct chemical and physical properties identify them as different\nsubstances. The explanation of isomerism (and many other facts in\norganic chemistry), provided first by August Kekul\u00e9 and\nArchibald Scott Couper, is the fact that certain compounds exist in\nmolecular form and these molecules have internal structure. Thus\nmolecules of isomers have the same atoms in different spatial\narrangements, e.g., CHNO may be arranged as H\u2013O\u2013C\u2261N\n(cyanic acid) or as H\u2013C=N\u2013O (fulminic acid). Isomerism\nmeans that specifying the chemical composition alone is not sufficient\nfor classification. The microstructure of a compound concerns not just\nthe elemental atoms in its molecules, but also their spatial\narrangement.\n\nNeedham (2000) and van Brakel (2000) have argued that compounds such\nas water are dynamic structures whose natures cannot be given in\nstatic accounts of their composing elements. Molecules of\nH2O are polar, with the consequence that the\nelectropositive hydrogen atoms in one H2O molecule will\nbond with the electronegative oxygen atoms in another H2O\nmolecule, such bonds being hydrogen bonds with the result\nthat in liquid water H2O molecules will form polymer-like\nchains known as oligomers. The hydrogen bonds and the\nconsequent chains are responsible for the fact that water is liquid at\nroom temperature (whereas compounds with similarly sized molecules,\nsuch as hydrogen sulphide, methane, and carbon dioxide, are all\ngaseous at room temperature). These oligomers are constantly forming,\nbreaking, and reforming. The rate of such changes and the mean length\nof such oligomers are dependent on the thermodynamic context (in the\nextreme case, an ice crystal may be considered as a single such\noligomer, the crystal structure being dependent on the fixed, strong\nhydrogen bonds). Thus, say Needham and van Brakel, we cannot consider\nwater to be just a compound composed of a collection of H2O\nmolecules. Furthermore, anything that is to be water must be a\nmacroscopic entity, since only macroscopic bodies can bear\nthermodynamic properties, such as melting point, which we use to\nidentify water. Hence, a single H2O molecule is not\nwater.\n\nThese considerations need not undermine the microstructuralist claim.\nMany chemical kinds may exist in any of the solid, liquid, and gaseous\nstates while remaining the same substance, including water. But, water\nvapour will not possess the oligomers present in liquid water and ice.\nSo their presence, however characteristic of water in the liquid and\nsolid phases, cannot be a necessary feature of all bodies of water.\nAbove we saw that atomic number is regarded as the essential feature\nof an element because it explains the other characteristics an element\nhas. Likewise, the structure of the H2O molecule explains\nwhy it is a strongly polar molecule, which in turn explains why it\ntends to form oligomers. As regards thermodynamic properties, Hendry\n(2006) points out that we say that water is contained in a\nperson\u2019s body, without thinking that this water has any\nthermodynamic properties. More generally, thermodynamic properties can\nbe ascribed only to entities in equilibrium, but not all bodies of\nwater are in thermodynamic equilibrium or even nearly so. We may very\nwell use such thermodynamic properties in identifying something as\nwater, but that does not mean that it is in virtue of such properties\nthat something is water.\n\nHendry (2006) points to a potentially more difficult problem, which is\nthat any liquid sample of water, however pure, contains not only\nH2O molecules but also H3O+ and\nOH\u2212 ions. These ions cannot be regarded as\nimpurities, since they are also an inevitable consequence of the polar\nstructure of the H2O molecule. Hendry\u2019s solution is\nto regard H2O molecules as the constituents of water in\nrather the same sense that eggs and flour are the constituents of a\ncake\u2014they go into making the cake but need not retain exactly\nthe form they started with. Water is made from bodies of\nH2O molecules, but not all those retain precisely that\nstructure.\n\nThe taxa in the classical Linnean system of biological classification\nare nested in a hierarchy, as required by Criterion 5 in Section\n1.1.1. But, in certain respects, chemical classification fails to meet\nthis requirement. The phenomenon of allotropy is exhibited\nwhen an element exists in two or more distinct forms. The element\ncarbon has several, including the allotropes diamond and graphite. Tin\nhas two allotropes at room tempreature, white tin (which is metallic)\nand grey tin (which is non-metallic). Some instances of tin will fall\ninto one category and other instances will fall into the other\ncategory. Consequently, classification by element and classification\nby metal or non-metal cannot be combined hierarchically.\n\nSuch cross-cutting classifications are frequently found in organic\nchemistry, where compounds can be classified according to their\nso-called functional groups. Functional groups are specific\ncombinations of atoms within a molecule that will cause the molecule\nto engage in certain reactions and to have other physical and chemical\nproperties that are characteristic of that group. For example,\nalcohols are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group \u2212OH\nbound to a carbon atom of an alkyl group or derivative of an alkyl\ngroup. Alcohols undergo characteristic reactions such as\nesterification. Since other hydrogen atoms in an alcohol molecule may\nbe substituted by another functional group, the resulting molecule\nwill have properties characteristic of both functional groups and may\nbe classified accordingly. Benzyl alcohol,\nC6H5CH2OH (or BnOH), is obtained from\nmethane, CH4, by replacing one hydrogen atom by an\nalcohol-forming hydroxyl group, \u2212OH, and another by the phenyl\ngroup \u2212C6H5 (Ph) (the phenyl group plus\nthe CH2 from the methane is the benzyl group, i.e.\nBn is PhCH2). Thus benzyl alcohol may be classified either\nas an alcohol, or as an aromatic benzene derivative, since it\nparticipates in the characteristic reactions of the latter, such as\nelectrophilic aromatic substitution or hydrogenation of the benzene\nring. If the hierarchy requirement on a system of natural kinds is\ncorrect, then not all these cross-cutting classifications pick out\nnatural kinds. The claim that the hierarchy requirement is too\nstringent for scientific kinds has been defended by Khalidi (1998) and\nTobin (2010b).\n\nOne may have to deny that metals form a natural kind, and that\nclassification by functional group is a classification into natural\nkinds. (Not all classifications need to be into kinds in order for\nthem to be useful.) Note that in both cases, there is room for\nvagueness. Some elements, such as germanium and antimony, are classed\nas metalloids, with characteristics between metals and non-metals. The\nimpact of a functional group diminishes with the size of the molecules\nof which it is a part and in the presence of competing functional\ngroups, and so in certain cases, classification according to\nfunctional group will be vague. Such vagueness falls foul of the\ncategorical distinctness requirement (Criterion 6 above).\n\nPhilosophers have also discussed classification at the interface of\nbiology and chemistry. Goodwin (2011) has argued that structure is\nfundamental and sufficient for classification of biomolecules, such as\nproteins. Tobin (2010a) and Slater (2009) appeal to developments in\nthe relationship between protein structure and function in a number of\ncases such as moonlighting proteins, intrinsically unstructured\nproteins, and enzymes with multiple structural variants. They claim\nthat the path from structure to function in not straightforward and so\nundermines the fundamental individuating role of structure in protein\nclassification. Slater (2009) takes these developments in the practice\nto constitute an argument in favour of macromolecular pluralism.\nGoodwin (2011) claims that these developments do not undermine the\nfundamental role of structure in protein classification, but instead\nsuggest a more nuanced understanding of this role. (Goodwin, 2011: p.\n534) In a similar vein, Tahko (2020) argues that biochemical kinds\npose a challenge for ontological reductionism and for\nmicrostructuralism, which have led some to motivate a dual theory of\nchemical and biological kinds and others to argue for pluralism about\nnatural kinds. Tahko argues that the main challenge is multiple\nrealization, which he nevertheless, thinks can be addressed. The\nupshot is that there are reasonable prospects for ontological\nreductionism about biochemical kinds, which in his view corroborates\nnatural kind monism. Thus, even if there are indispensable\nclassificatory practices at the higher level, this need not entail\npluralism about biochemical kinds.\n2.3 Natural Kinds and Psychology\n\nDo the different sorts of mental state form natural kinds? We\ncertainly think that our minds make a difference to what happens in\nthe physical world and we think that we act because we have\ncertain beliefs, desires, hopes, fears etc. The distinctive\nexplanatory roles performed by these different states in folk\npsychology certainly suggest that these beliefs, desires, hopes and\nfears constitute distinct mental natural kinds. Note that in\nconsidering natural kinds in chemistry, biology, and physics we have\nthought of kinds principally as kinds of thing (kinds of stuff,\norganism, particle, etc.) whereas we are now considering the\npossibility of certain kinds of state. (Ellis (2001, 2002) is\nclear that he does not limit natural kinds to kinds of thing, but\nincludes kinds of state and process also.) A Cartesian dualist holds\nthat mental states are distinct from any physical state of the\nsubject, as they are states of an immaterial thinking substance. The\nproblem for dualism however is in finding the ground of the difference\nbetween fearing, believing, hoping etc. i.e. what difference is there\nto the immaterial substance when a subject is in different mental\nstates? In principle this problem could be avoided by the dualist if\nmental kinds are regarded as immaterial substances (Shoemaker\n2003).\n\nThere are many ways to understand mental natural kinds, and theories\nhave been proposed by eliminativists, identity theorists,\nfunctionalists and many others. We will treat each of these in turn.\nPhysicalists hold that the differences in mental kinds relate somehow\nto differences in states of the subject\u2019s brain, or, more\ngenerally, the subject\u2019s body. At one extreme, the (type)\nidentity theory of mind holds that types of mental state are identical\nwith types of brain state. If so, we may expect the kinds of\npsychology to be identical with the kinds of neuroscience.\n\nThe identity theory faces the problem of multiple\nrealizability\u2014the idea that it is possible for physically\ndiverse creatures to be in the same kind of mental state. It is\npossible, for example, that Martian neurophysiology might be entirely\ndifferent from that of humans while Martians nonetheless have the same\nkinds of mental state as humans have; if a Martian\u2019s body is\ninjured, it writhes, groans, and avoids the causes of such\ninjuries\u2014the Martian is in pain (Lewis 1980). Indeed it is\npossible that cognitive scientists might design a machine that is\ncapable of higher-level thought (implemented on, for example, a\nsilicon architecture). It is even possible that the same mental kinds\nbe realized by distinct neurophysiological systems in one and the same\norganism over time. Consequently, it is at least an open empirical\npossibility that mental kinds may correspond to a widely disjunctive\nand heterogeneous set of neurophysiological kinds, and hence that\nthere is no one-to-one correlation between them.\n\nEliminativism argues that the prima facie failure to\nstraightforwardly reduce mental kinds to neurophysiological kinds\nought to lead to the elimination of mental kinds altogether\n(Churchland 1981, 1988). This is to claim that there are no mental\nnatural kinds. On this view, the mental kinds in folk psychology are\ncomparable to the kinds delineated by discredited folk theories from\nthe past e.g., the humours in medieval medicine. The underlying\nprinciple of medieval medicine was the balancing of so-called four\nhumours. According to the theory, illness was caused by an imbalance\nof these four humours. From the point of view of modern medicine this\ntheory is radically false and so the only option is to eliminate the\nhumours as putative natural kinds. Analogously, mental kinds ought to\nbe eliminated in favour of those kinds uncovered by recent research in\nneuroscience. Eliminativists agree that human beings have invented a\nvery successful methodology for describing their mental lives. This\nmethodology is folk psychology, a common sense theory of how mental\nstates are causally related to human action. However, folk psychology,\nthey argue, is merely a heuristic device invented by human beings in\norder to make the explanation of behaviour easier. The posits of the\ntheory are not real natural kinds. Once a better explanation of human\nbehaviour in terms of neurophysiological kinds is available, then\nmental kinds will be eliminated.\n\nFunctionalists argue that the irreducibilty of mental kinds is\nnevertheless compatible with a token-token identity theory (Fodor\n1974, 1997). Mental kinds are not type-identical with\nneurophysiological kinds (i.e. there is not one type of\nneurophysiological correlate for each type of mental state, so we\ncannot make general identity statements such as \u201cpain =\nC-fibres firing\u201d). A Martian and I, both in a state of\nfear at a time t, may be in different physiological states.\nNevertheless, my token instance of the kind fear at time t\nwill be identical with the token physical state in my brain at that\ntime. Likewise, the token instance of the Martian\u2019s fear at time\nt1 is identical with his token physical state.\n\nIt has been argued by Kim (1992, 1993) that multiply realized mental\nkinds of the latter kind can in principle be locally reduced to their\nrealizing states. Mental kinds are analogous to mineral kinds such as\njade, which can be locally reduced to nephrite or jadeite depending on\nthe sample. Importantly, a sample that does not consist of either\nnephrite or jadeite is simply not jade. Nevertheless, there is an\nimportant disanalogy between mental kinds and locally reduced kinds\nlike jade. If you want a sample of jade, then it must be composed of\neither jadeite or nephrite. In other words, if J (jade) is\nrealized by the disjunction P (Jadeite) or Q\n(Nephrite), then it is metaphysically necessary that the properties a\nthing has qua J are either properties it has\nqua P or properties it has qua Q.\nSo, something with all the other qualitative properties of jade in\nanother possible world, but which lacked the essential properties\n(i.e. of jadeite or nephrite) would simply not be an instance of\njade.\n\nIn contrast, for the functionalist (Fodor 1997) mental kinds are\ndefined by their functional roles, rather than by the essential\nproperties of the neurophysiological kinds that realize them. It does\nnot matter which physical kind does the realizing, be it silicon\nchips, neurons, C-fibres or whatever. Rather, what matters is\nthat the psychological state (e.g., pain) plays a certain functional\nrole. The whole point of multiple realizability is that it is easy to\nimagine some possible world where a token mental kind is realized by\nsilicon chips, C-fibres firing, or whatever. So, a mental\nkind is not essentially realized by a certain neurophysiological kind;\nrather it plays the same functional role independently of what\nunderlying kind is realizing it. This appears to violate Criterion 1\nfor natural kinds (in Section 1.1.1), that members of a natural kind\nshould have some natural properties in common.\n\nThe functional role of mental kinds is explained by some\nfunctionalists in terms of the modularity of the mind (Fodor 1983).\nThis is the claim that the mind has different innate modules which\nplay a certain functional role. These modules are domain-specific,\noperating only on certain kinds of inputs. So, for example, there will\nbe distinct modules for mental tasks like mind-reading, speaker\nrecognition and facial recognition. The functional role associated\nwith mental kinds might for example be given an evolutionary account\nin terms of adapted modules (Cosmides and Tooby 1992). On this view,\nmental kinds in folk psychology are successful for the purposes of the\nexplanation of human behaviour because they refer to the functional\nmodules of the mind. Such views may motivate emergentism. One\ninterpretation of the emergentist account of mind is that there are\nemergent mental kinds that have no straightforward correlation with\nthe kinds identified by neuroscience. Nor are mental kinds and\nneurophysiological kinds either identical to or subkinds of one\nanother; consequently emergentism is in conflict with the (contested)\ntaxonomic hierarchy criterion (Criterion 5). (See the entry on\n emergent properties.)\n\nThe type-identity theory, if true, might seem to motivate essentialism\nabout psychological kinds, by analogy with other theoretical\nidentities (see Section 1.3.1 and Section 4.3). Kripke (1980),\nhowever, denies that his arguments concerning other theoretical\nidentities apply here. Let us say that (slow) pain for us humans is\ncorrelated with the firing of C-fibres. If this were a\ngenuine theoretical identity, then in all possible worlds, when\nsomeone undergoes C-fibre firing, then they are in a state of\npain. But it seems plausible that there could be worlds where\nC-fibre stimulation is not accompanied by any painful\nsensation. If there are such worlds, then the theoretical identity\nimplies that such a world is one where people can be in pain without\nhaving any painful sensation; indeed the pain might yield a pleasant\nsensation. Kripke regards this as counterintuitive. The concept of\npain is necessarily tied to the phenomenal nature of the pain\nsensation, whereas the concept of gold is not tied to the colour\nyellow. Consequently, there is no identity between pain and\nC-fibre firing (nor any other physical state); likewise there\nis no physical essence to pain. A posteriori natural kind\nessentialism fails in this case.\n\nRecently, there has been some discussion of whether mental concepts\nare themselves natural kinds. The claim that concepts form a natural\nkind has been accepted by philosophers of psychology and cognitive\npsychologists alike (Margolis, 1994, 1995; Fodor, 1998, 2008). Recent\nliterature has argued against that assumption (Griffiths 1997; Machery\n2005, 2009; Piccinini and Scott 2006). Griffiths 1997 has argued that\nindividual and familiar concepts such as emotion do not correspond to\ngenuine natural kinds, and should therefore be eliminated from\nscientific vocabulary. Machery\u2019s (2009, Ch. 3) heterogeneity\nhypothesis claims furthermore that the class of concepts do not\ndelineate a homogeneous class; the kind \u2018concept\u2019. Rather,\nthey divide into several distinct kinds that actually have little in\ncommon. Thus, it is a mistake to assume that there are many general\nproperties of concepts, and that a theory of concepts should attempt\nto describe these. In general, then the notion of concept is not part\nof an adequate taxonomy of our mental representation.\n2.4 Natural Kinds and Social Science\n\nThe question as to whether there are social kinds has a long history.\nIn the sociology of science, functionalists such as Durkheim (1897)\nhave argued that there is empirical support for the autonomy of social\nfacts. For example, statistical analysis shows that suicide rates\ndiffered radically depending on social factors, (e.g. religious\nbackground, gender, marital status etc.) This analysis led to the\npossibility of social science being taken in a quantitative direction.\nEven if every individual commits suicide as a result of psychological\nfactors, the statistical facts about the \u201creasons\u201d for\nsuicide and how they change with place and over time are distinctly\nsocial. One question then is whether one should be naturalist about\nsuch social facts. If so, how could naturalism be reconciled with the\nclaim that social facts are dynamic and changing in so far as they\nconcern human beings in social interactions?\n\nBecause social kinds are distinctly anthropocentric, some theorists\nclaim that the only plausible view we can hold is some form of\nconstructivism about them. Hacking (1995, 1999) argues that in social\ncontexts the object of classification itself changes in being\nclassified. The fact that the people being classified are conscious\nmakes for dynamic interactions between the classification and the\nclassified. The latter may resist or embrace certain classifications\n(\u2018child abuser\u2019, \u2018hip\u2019) and modify their\nbehaviour accordingly. This leads to a change in the extensions of\nthe relevant kind concepts. Furthermore, as the extensions change, the\ncriteria for membership may change also. Many of our classifications\nin social science are evaluative. A social situation looks deviant\nfrom the norm and people make an evaluative judgment about this.\nSometimes this means that people passively accept what experts say\nabout them, and see themselves in that light. But feedback can direct\nitself in many ways. Alternatively, some people seek to reclassify\nthemselves. Thus, classification in social science is interactive.\nHacking argues that this is in marked contrast to the indifferent\nkinds that are found in natural science. An electron is indifferent to\nbeing classified as an electron.\n\nPace Hacking, Khalidi (2010) argues that in fact the contrast\nbetween natural and social kinds is not so stark: even many chemical\nkinds would not have been instantiated in the world were it not for\nthe fact that a scientist conceived of them and acted on that\nconception. So in both cases the existence of a classification scheme\ncan cause changes to the extension of the kinds in question. The\ndifference between natural kinds and social kinds is a difference of\nthe degree of control we have over the object of classification. In\nthe chemical domain, for example, the nature of the phenomena\nthemselves imposes greater restrictions on the kinds that we can\ncreate. (See also Cooper 2004.)\n3. The Epistemology of Natural Kinds\n\nMany of these considerations from the practice of classification\nin the special sciences have led to an emerging naturalist approach to\nthe topic of natural kinds. It is clear from the examination of\nclassification in the special sciences, that it is difficult to find a\nconcept of natural kind that fits all of the different practices of\nclassification. This has sometimes been used as a core argument in\nfavour of pluralism about natural kinds (Dupr\u00e9 2001) or to\neliminate the need for natural kinds altogether (Hacking\n2007a). Additionally, this first argument has been used to support the\nhomeostatic property cluster view of kinds, because this takes a more\nliberal approach to classification. Indeed one of the motivations for\nBoyd\u2019s original HPC view was to outline an account of natural\nkinds that was liberal enough to accommodate a diversity of natural\nkinds, also including the kinds in the biological and social\nsciences.\n\nMany of the claims made in support of pluralism stem from concerns\nabout natural kind classification in the context of scientific\npractice. This approach tends to examine specific scientific case\nstudies and derive philosophical implications about classification\nfrom the examination of these classificatory practices (Kendig 2015).\nIt is important to point out that many of the discussions are\nepistemic in nature; that is to say the claim that there are different\nways to classify in scientific practice, which are all equally\nlegitimate ways of generating knowledge for practising scientists\ndepending on their theoretical interests and research questions.\n\nIn recent literature, some have argued for a move away from the\nmetaphysics of natural kinds to an epistemology-first approach to\nclassification. Slater (2015), Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015) argue that\nthe epistemic value of natural kinds can be considered independently\nfrom the metaphysics of natural kinds. They claim that it is more\nfruitful to be led by classification in scientific practice first and\nforemost. A philosophical account of our classificatory practices\nshould describe how kinds are made in the context of scientific\npractice, we might refer these as acts of \u201ckinding\u201d.\nSlater claims that what matters for classification is the role that\nour classes play in inductive inferences within the context of\nscientific practice. Slater argues that this requires a minimal\nmetaphysical commitment \u201cthat these properties be sufficiently\nstably co-instantiated to accommodate the inferential and explanatory\nuses to which particular sciences are put\u201d Slater (2015), p.\n396). Similarly, Magnus (2012) argues that a natural kind in a domain\nallows enquiry in the domain to achieve inductive and explanatory\nsuccess, a success which would be impossible without a pre-existing\ncommitment to a natural kind classification.\n\nAdditionally, those that take an epistemology first approach are\ncritical of metaphysical accounts of natural kinds which are overly\nprescriptive and homogeneous about what counts as a natural kind. The\nconsequence of taking a metaphysics first approach is that many of the\nimportant and heterogeneous practices of kinding that are used in the\ncontext of scientific practice do not count as natural kind\nclassifications in the metaphysical sense. The implication here is\nthat an epistemology first approach is more consistent with a\ndescriptive and naturalistic account of classification.\nEpistemological accounts of natural kinds must come first and our\nmetaphysical accounts must be informed by these epistemological\nconsiderations.\n\nEreshefsky and Reydon (2015) have argued that this has led to a\nfundamental mismatch between scientific kinds and natural kinds. In\nthe homeostatic property cluster view of kinds, the overarching\nprinciples of similarity and homeostatic mechanisms lead to many\nexamples of scientific kinds which do not then count as natural kinds.\nFor example, according to Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015), non-causal,\nfunctional and heterostatic kinds would not count as natural kinds\ndespite the fact that many successful scientific kinds are non-causal,\nfunctional or heterostatic.\n\nIn contrast, Lemeire (2018) argues that a purely epistemic approach to\nnatural kinds is misguided. The epistemic approach rests on the\nassumption that for kind categories to be epistemically fruitful, they\nhave to get something right about the world. However, epistemic\nsuccess is constrained by deference to the world not only in cases of\nnatural kind classification, but also in cases of conventional and\npragmatic classification, where the product of kinding is not\nconsidered to be a natural kind. For this reason, Lemiere argues that\na purely epistemic approach fails to give us a principled way of\ndistinguishing between the natural kinds and their conventional\ncounterparts. A metaphysical account of which features individuals\nrequire to be considered as natural kinds is required to lead our\ncategorization practices. An epistemic approach alone cannot provide a\nprincipled way of doing this.\n\nKendig and Grey (2021) are also critical of purely epistemic\napproaches to natural kinds. They accept that there is value to\nepistemology first accounts of natural kinds in so far as they\nhighlight the epistemic value of natural kind classifications to\nscientists. Nevertheless, they argue that doing this successfully\nrequires accurate metaphysical presuppositions. Their argument focuses\non Slater\u2019s HPC view of natural kinds to expose why metaphysical\npresuppositions are necessary for our categorisation practices. They\nclaim that it is not possible to evaluate the stability of a cluster\nof properties without taking stock of the metaphysical picture used to\naccount for that stability\n\nReydon (2016) has argued for a model which attempts to reconcile and\nintegrate the metaphysics and the epistemology in the act of\nclassification. On his co-creation model of natural kinds, both nature\nand the classifier are constitutive of the creation of kinds\u2019\n(p. 70); kinds are \u2018co-determined by aspects of the state of\naffairs in nature as well as by background assumptions and decisions\nby investigators\u2019 (p. 59).\n4. The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms\n\nMuch recent interest in natural kinds has been stimulated by debates\nconcerning the semantics of natural kind terms, originating especially\nwith the work of Saul Kripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1973, 1975a).\nTypical natural kind expressions fall into one of two categories:\npredicates (is water, is gold, is a tiger,\nand is an oak) and singular terms (water,\ngold, the tiger, and the oak). In this\nsection we survey some of the debates concerning the meaning of such\nterms, what\u2014if anything\u2014they refer to, and how they do so.\nMany discussions focus on the predicate kind terms, often considering\nthem alongside other general terms, taking the principal issue to be\nthe relationship between a natural kind term and its extension. Such\nan approach will appeal to conventionalists, but it may appeal also to\nthose naturalists who are nominalists about natural kinds or otherwise\nhostile or indifferent to (strong) realism about natural kinds.\nHowever, we shall see that there may be reason to take the singular\nkind terms as primary. (One difference between Putnam and Kripke is\nthat while Putnam tends to focus on the natural kind predicates,\nKripke\u2019s arguments are centered primarily on the singular\nnatural kind terms.) Kripke and Putnam attacked a pair of related\nviews about natural kind terms: descriptivist semantics (the meaning\nof such a term is a description satisfied by all and only members of\nthe kind) and internalism (the meaning of such a term, the relevant\ndescription, is fully grasped by competent users of the term so that\nwhat fixes the extension of the term supervenes on what is internal to\nthe user). Putnam\u2019s rejection of descriptivism is a component of\nhis argument that \u2018meanings ain\u2019t in the head\u2019\nwhereas for Kripke the goal is to show that natural kind terms are\nmuch like proper names, for which, he argues, a descriptivist\nsemantics fails. Members of the extension of a natural kind share\nproperties in common. If descriptivism were true, then one would\nreasonably believe that those properties would be the properties\nmentioned in the description with the possible addition of further\nproperties nomically correlated with those. But if descriptivism is\nfalse, it would appear that the characteristic properties of a kind\nwill not typically be knowable a priori, but must be uncovered by\nscientific investigation. If so, then those properties, being\nnecessary conditions of kind membership but discoverable only a\nposteriori, look very much like real essences. At first sight\nit seems then that the semantic arguments of Kripke and Putnam have\nmetaphysical consequences. This is highly controversial (Salmon 1979,\n1982). Do the arguments of Putnam and Kripke really support an\nessentialist metaphysics? Or do they illegitimately assume it? Or do\nthey, more innocently, show that we as users of natural kind terms\nimplicitly assume such a metaphysics?\n4.1 Descriptivism and Internalism\n\nThe modern tradition of natural kinds begins with J. S. Mill (1884)\nwho talked of \u2018Kinds\u2019 (the term \u2018natural kind\u2019\nis traced by Hacking (1991a) back to Mill\u2019s contemporary, the\nlogician John Venn (1866)). According to Mill, typical singular\n(individual) names such as \u2018Scott\u2019 denote their\nreferents but lack any connotation, that is to say the names\ndo not imply any attribute. Some singular names do have connotation as\nwell as denotation, for example \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019.\nA general name, such as \u2018white\u2019, denotes all the things\nthey hold of (its extension) while also connoting the attribute they\nall share in common. Natural kind terms are a special case of general\nterms in this respect\n\nThe idea that something such as a connotation determines the extension\nof a term is elaborated in Frege\u2019s notion of sense and,\nlater, that of intension. Frege and later philosophers have\napplied this view to singular proper names, and views of this sort\nfall under the general heading of \u2018descriptivism\u2019. Russell\nis also often referred to in this regard, but it should be remembered\nthat Russell\u2019s view is that grammatically proper names are\nabbreviations of quantified expressions and so do not have any\nreferring role at all (and so a fortiori they do not have a\nreferring role that is meditated by a connotation/sense/intension).\nSome neo-Fregeans nevertheless deny that Fregean senses should be\ncashed out as descriptions (e.g., McDowell 1977; Evans 1982).\n\nMill\u2019s descriptivism implies that for each natural kind term\nthere is an associated set of properties such that for some item to be\na member of that natural kind, it should possess those\nproperties\u2014these are properties that describe objects belonging\nto the kind in question. Implicit in Mill and explicit in Frege is the\nclaim that these descriptions are constitutive of the meaning of the\nterm in the following way: someone who understands the term adequately\nwill be in a position to grasp a priori that something falls\nunder the kind term if and only if it satisfies that description. For\nthis reason the relevant properties will normally be readily\nobservable properties of things; they will not be properties\nassociated with the kind only by a posteriori investigation.\nFor example, as mentioned above, Kant held the view that it is a\npriori that something falls under the kind term gold\nonly if it is a yellow metal. Because the extension-fixing meaning of\na term is thus graspable a priori this view is\ninternalist about extension fixing. The extensions of kind\nterms of any two subjects with the same internal mental states will\nhave (in the same context) the same extensions.\n4.2 Arguments Against Descriptivism\n\nPutnam (1973, 1975a) and Kripke (1972) reject the descriptivist view\nof natural kind terms. Putnam\u2019s principal aim is to undermine\ninternalism about reference and extension (\u201cmeanings just\nain\u2019t in the head\u201d). Kripke\u2019s aim is first to\nrestate a Millian view of proper names (they denote without connoting)\nand then to extend that view to natural kind terms.\n(\u2018Millian\u2019 will be used to characterize any account of the\nsemantics of a term that claims that it denotes without connoting,\neven when applied, pace Mill, to kind terms.) According to\nKripke, Mill was right about proper names but wrong about kinds;\nMillianism\u2014Mill\u2019s denotation-without-connotation\nview\u2014is right for both sorts of term. Salmon (1982) categorizes\nKripke\u2019s arguments against descriptivism for singular terms\nunder the headings \u2018the modal arguments\u2019, \u2018the\nepistemological arguments\u2019, and \u2018the semantic\narguments\u2019\u2014this categorization is useful also for the\ncorresponding arguments against descriptivism for general terms.\n4.2.1 The Modal Arguments Against Descriptivism\n\nThe modal arguments against descriptivism take the following form. Let\nC be some natural kind and D be some complex set of\nreadily observable properties that would, on a descriptivist view, be\nmost naturally regarded as providing the content of the description\nthat constitutes the meaning of \u2018C\u2019. Now\nconsider:\n\n(K) \u2200x(x is an instance of the kind\nC \u2194 Dx).\n\n\nSince D is constitutive of the meaning of\n\u2018C\u2019, (K) should be analytic and so necessary. The\ndescriptive view would thus be refuted either by (i) metaphysically\npossible instances of the kind C that do not possess the\nproperty complex D or by (ii) metaphysically possible items\nthat do possess the property complex D without being\ninstances of C.\n\nSome proposed cases of (i) require the laws of nature to be\ncontingent. Although the laws of nature are widely held to be\ncontingent, some philosophers hold that the laws are necessary, on the\nbasis of essentialist arguments that are much of a piece with\nKripke\u2019s essentialist arguments, even if strictly independent of\nthem. The anti-descriptivist arguments regard the observable\nproperties of instances of a kind C as nomic consequences of\nthe essence of C. If the laws of nature are metaphysically\nnecessary then D will be a necessary property of instances\nof C also. Thus, instances of (i) will not be available. If\nthe laws are necessary, then the melting point of gold will be\nnecessary just as the atomic number of gold is. However, not all\nobservable properties are consequences of the laws alone. Some are\nconsequences of the laws plus contingent environmental factors. Thus\nthe perceived colour of an object may change with environmental\ndifferences. Thus if looking yellow is a component of\nD, then a possible world in which gold does not look yellow\n(because of unusual atmospheric effects)\u2014surely a genuine\npossibility\u2014would be a counterinstance of type (i). On the other\nhand, it might be argued, that the proper component of D\nwould be being yellow, in which case we will have the makings\nof an epistemological argument against descriptivism (see below).\n\nOther cases of (i) might be thought to be generated, irrespective of\nthe necessity of the laws, by noting that a kind might be manifested\nin two or more superficially distinct species. Thus allotropes are\ndistinct types of a single chemical kind that may differ considerably\nin superficial properties (for example, graphite and diamond, both\ntypes of the element carbon). Similarly, a caterpillar and a butterfly\ncan be members of the same species. For known cases, D would\nhave to be disjunctive. While that may not itself be problematic, it\nraises the epistemic possibility that the same phenomenon may be\n(nomically and metaphysically) possible for many kinds that we think\nexist in only one form.\n\nCases of (ii) may be more readily available, since the necessity of\nlaws may rule out a particular kind having different possible sets of\nmanifest properties, but does not rule out two distinct possible kinds\nhaving the same manifest properties. Indeed, the case of jadeite and\nnephrite is often referred to as an example of the latter. Along the\nsame lines, we may imagine that something like fool\u2019s gold, iron\npyrites, is just like gold in observable properties, differing only in\nchemical constitution. We may imagine that there were creatures to all\nappearances like cats, but which are internally robots; or just like\ntigers but had reptilian innards. These are all metaphysically\npossible, so the arguments go; hence, possession of the relevant\nproperties cannot suffice for membership of the corresponding\nkind.\n\nThe modal argument does not refute descriptivism applied to every\ndescription\u2014after all, Kripke and Putnam do both think that the\ndescription \u201cis constituted by H2O\u201d holds\nnecessarily of anything that is water. Rather, the modal argument is\nintended to exclude as possible descriptions those that could be\nconstitutive of a sense or connotation that is grasped by any\ncompetent user of the term. Such a sense, if it exists, would employ\ndescriptions that refer to the observable features of the members of a\nkind, not those features uncovered by science.\n4.2.2 The Epistemological Arguments\n\nThe epistemological arguments against descriptivism have a similar\nstructure to the modal arguments. Consider again the proposition (K).\nSomeone who uses the term \u2018C\u2019 competently should be\nthereby able to come to know that (K) is true, in virtue of grasping\nthe meaning of \u2018C\u2019. Thus (K) should be a priori.\nSo counterexamples to descriptivism would be cases (i) where although\none knows that some thing is of the kind C one cannot thereby\ncome to know that it possesses the property complex D, or\n(ii) where although one knows that some thing possesses the property\ncomplex D, one cannot thereby come to know that it is of the\nkind C.\n\nTo generate epistemological type (i) cases, Kripke asks us to imagine\nthat gold might be blue but only appears yellow thanks to an optical\nillusion, or that tigers do not normally have four legs, but only\nappear that way, again thanks to an illusion. However, if the\ndescriptions associated with \u2018gold\u2019 were to include\n\u2018is yellow\u2019 and the descriptions associated with\n\u2018tiger\u2019 include \u2018is four-legged\u2019 then we would\nknow a priori that these possibilities do not obtain. But\nthat seems to be a mistake. Although we may reasonably be confident\nthat gold really is yellow and not blue, and not just appearing that\nway, this confidence is not a priori but is instead a\nconsequence of a posteriori experience of the conditions\nunder which we have observed samples of gold. It is a matter of\ndiscovery whether we are subject to this kind of illusion, or whether\nsomething that is in fact white or grey could be gold; for example it\nis only a posteriori that we know that gold does not have\nwhite and grey allotropes, as tin does. (What is called \u2018white\ngold\u2019 is in fact an alloy of gold; but given a description of\nits appearance, it is not a priori that it is not gold. This\nis a contrapositive version of an epistemological type (i) case.)\nLikewise, turning to epistemological type (ii) cases, if descriptivism\nwere correct, we could rule out a priori the possibility that\nsomething has all the superficial properties of gold, but is not gold.\nBut again we do not have such a priori knowledge (again we\nnote that jadeite is superficially similar to nephrite but not the\nsame kind).\n\nPutnam\u2019s Division of Linguistic Labor may be thought of as\nfurnishing an epistemological argument. Putnam\u2019s idea is that\nthe referent of a term used by some individual may be fixed not by\ntheir own knowledge or beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain\nexperts to whom that individual defers. Since aluminium and molybdenum\nare different kinds, then according to descriptivism there should be\nsome a priori knowable features that will distinguish between\nthem for anyone who is capable of using \u2018aluminium\u2019 to\nrefer to the one kind and \u2018molybdenum\u2019 to the other kind.\nLikewise there should be some mental difference between a speaker in\nthe actual world who uses \u2018aluminium\u2019 to refer to\naluminium and a speaker in another world, where the instances of\naluminium and molybdenum are swapped (pans and cans are made of\nmolybdenum there), who uses \u2018aluminium\u2019 to refer to\nmolybdenum. But, says, Putnam, no such difference need exist: ordinary\nspeakers have these differentiated referring capacities without any\ndifference in knowledge of the referents. That is because those\nreferential capacities are parasitic on those of the experts who do\nhave the required discriminating knowledge (Putnam, 1975b, 228). Their\nknowledge fixes the referents of their use of \u2018aluminium\u2019\nand \u2018molybdenum\u2019. Our deference to them as those people\nwho could tell us which things are aluminium and which are molybdenum,\nmeans that our referents of \u2018aluminium\u2019 and\n\u2018molybdenum\u2019 are the same as theirs.\n4.2.3 The Semantic Arguments\n\nThe modal and epistemological arguments concern the modal and\nepistemic properties of propositions of the form of (K). If\ndescriptivism were correct then there should be for each kind,\nC, a proposition of that form employing a manifest property\ncomplex D, such that the proposition is analytic and hence\nboth necessary and a priori. The modal and epistemological\narguments deny this.\n\nNote that the modal and epistemological arguments are most naturally\npresented in the material mode, concerning the objects themselves and\ntheir relations. (K) is in the material mode and we ask about its\nmodal status, by talking about certain stuff and asking whether it is\nor would be gold if it had such-and-such properties, and so forth.\nLikewise, mutatis mutandis, for the epistemological\narguments. The semantic arguments differ in that they are presented in\nthe formal mode, concerning the linguistic expressions in question.\nThis is because we are asking what a term\u2019s reference or\nextension would be in certain counterfactual circumstances. To use an\nexample concerning a proper (singular) name, we start by imagining\nthat it turns out that Johannes Kepler had not been the first to\npostulate the laws of planetary motion, whereas it was an unknown\nstudent of Kepler\u2019s who did this first. Many people have no\nbeliefs about Kepler other that that he was the first person to\npostulate those laws. If our story were true, would the name\n\u2018Kepler\u2019, as used by such people, refer to the student or\nto the teacher? Our intuition, so anti-descriptivists maintain, is\nthat the name would still refer to the teacher, the man we (falsely)\nbelieved to be responsible for the discovery of the laws of planetary\nmotion. Yet, if the descriptivist account were correct for proper\nnames, then with respect to the people under consideration, their use\nof \u2018Kepler\u2019 would either refer to the student, or would\nfail to refer at all.\n\nBoth Putnam and Kripke take arguments of this sort to generalize to\nnatural kind terms. The best known of the semantic arguments as\napplied to natural kind terms is Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought\nexperiment (see Section 1.3.1). Putnam asks us to imagine that\nelsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in\nvirtually all respects, which we may call \u2018Twin Earth\u2019.\nHowever, where on Earth we find H2O, on Twin Earth we find\nXYZ, a substance with a fundamentally different chemical\nstructure from H2O, but which shares all its manifest\nproperties (boiling and freezing points, taste, odour, ability to\nsupport life, being the predominant constituent of precipitation,\nseas, lakes etc.) with H2O. Every inhabitant of Earth has a\ntwin equivalent on Twin Earth. Twin Earthlings (at least those in the\nparts bearing a geographical similarity to Earth\u2019s United\nStates, Australia, Jamaica, Pitcairn etc.) speak a language rather\nlike English and use the term \u2018water\u2019 in circumstances\nprecisely analogous to our uses of \u2018water\u2019 on Earth, e.g.,\nthey say that their lakes and reservoirs are full of\n\u2018water\u2019.\n\nThe semantic Twin Earth argument now proceeds by asking what the\nextension of \u2018water\u2019 is, as used by some Earthling, and\nlikewise what the extension of \u2018water\u2019 is, as used by some\nTwin Earthling. Putnam\u2019s appeal to our linguistic intuitions is\nsupposed to yield the verdict that the extension of the\nEarthling\u2019s use of \u2018water\u2019 includes all and only\nH2O whereas the Twin Earthling\u2019s use of\n\u2018water\u2019 includes all and only XYZ. In support of this we\nmay consider that this is the judgment we must come to if we\nEarthlings are not to deny what Earth chemists tell us, viz. that\nwater is H2O, nor, symmetrically, deny the Twin Earth\nchemists\u2019 assertion, \u2018water is XYZ\u2019. Nor will it do\nto gainsay our chemists\u2019 judgment that water is H2O,\ngiven the assumption of the existence of XYZ. For that is tantamount\nto the suggestion that (actual) Berzelius (the discoverer of the\ncorrect chemical formula for water) was not entitled to assert that\nwater is H2O until he had ruled out the possibility of some\nsubstance other than H2O sharing water\u2019s manifest\nqualities.\n\nThe thought experiment is now almost in a position to claim the\nforegoing as a counterexample to descriptivism, for XYZ will satisfy\nany set of manifest properties that could be constitutive of the\nmeaning of \u2018water\u2019 as used on Earth. Yet the extension of\nthat term excludes XYZ. However, the reference to chemists\u2019\nknowledge made above reminds us that there is a difference between not\nonly the physical constitution of Earth and Twin Earth, but also a\ndifference between the psychological states of their inhabitants. For\n(some of) those on Earth believe \u2018water is H2O\u2019\nwhereas their Twin Earth counterparts believe \u2018water is\nXYZ\u2019. Perhaps, at least for those speakers, those beliefs are\nalso constitutive of the meanings of the two terms \u2018water\u2019\n(Earth) and \u2018water\u2019 (Twin Earth). In order to exclude this\nresponse, Putnam asks us to consider the same comparison made in 1750,\nbefore any beliefs of this form were held. We now assume that there\nhas been no major change in the (cross-temporal) extension of\n\u2018water\u2019 (Earth) since 1750. (That is to say, when David\nHume asked for a glass of what he called \u2018water\u2019, he was\nrequesting the same stuff as we are when we make a request using the\nsame term.) Since, as argued above, the extensions of\n\u2018water\u2019 (Earth) and \u2018water\u2019 (Twin Earth)\ndiffer today, their extensions differed in 1750. But in 1750 the\ndescriptions associated with the word \u2018water\u2019 cannot\ndiffer between Earth and Twin Earth. This is because the molecular\nstructure of water was unknown in 1750, prior to the chemical\nrevolution (when phlogiston theory was replaced by Lavoisier\u2019s\nnew oxygen theory). Given that the molecular structure was unknown\neven to the experts, the descriptive resources available to Earthians\nand their Twin Earthian counterparts were identical. Nonetheless,\ntheir references using \u2018water\u2019 differed. Hence,\ndescriptions do not suffice to fix reference.\n4.3 Direct Reference and Externalism\n\nThe conclusions of the arguments given above include not only the\nfalsity of descriptivism as a thesis about the reference of natural\nkind terms, but also the more general truth of semantic\nexternalism. The Earthling in 1750 and their Twin Earth\ncounterpart are supposed to be intrinsic physical duplicates. (There\nis a problem in that one would expect the twin to have XYZ in its\nblood stream, etc., not H2O, so the two are not perfect\nduplicates; but we can take it that this physical difference should\nnot affect the argument.) Although they are duplicates, the terms they\nuse have different extensions; likewise their thoughts have different\ntruth conditions. Consequently, the reference, extension, and truth\nconditions of a person\u2019s utterances do not supervene on their\nphysical state. These things are fixed, at least in part, by external\nconsiderations. We might retain a conception of the psychological such\nthat the psychological still supervenes on the physical; but then one\nwould have to deny that \u2018thinking about water\u2019\ncharacterizes a psychological state. Or, we must deny that the\npsychological state of a subject supervenes upon the physical state of\nthe subject.\n\nIf descriptions do not fix extensions, and some external factor fixes\nextensions, then by what process are extensions fixed? Kripke does not\nintend to propose a new theory of reference fixing, although the\noutlines of such a theory are fairly clearly implied by what he says.\nHis principal aim is to make the case for the Millian\ndenotation-without-connotation view of singular proper names, and then\nextend this (contrary to Mill\u2019s own opinion) to certain general\nterms also, including natural kind terms.\n\nThe Millian view may be called direct reference (Kaplan\n1977), since the reference of singular proper name is not mediated by\na connotation/sense/intension. The semantic value of such a name just\nis the individual to which it refers. Such terms are thus rigid\ndesignators\u2014they denote the same object with respect to all\npossible worlds (Kripke 1980, 48). How does this view extend to\nnatural kind terms? The answer is that the view does not transfer if\nwe take the analogue of the denotation of a singular term to be the\nextension of a kind term. This is because presumably the extension of\na kind term differs from world to world, since the individual members\nof a kind, such as individual tigers and lumps of gold, are generally\ncontingent entities.\n\nThe obvious route to an analogy between kind terms and singular direct\nreference is to focus not on natural kind predicates but on singular\nnatural kind terms (see first paragraph of Section 4 above). We should\nregard terms such as \u2018water\u2019, \u2018gold\u2019,\n\u2018Rattus rattus\u2019, etc. as denoting abstract\nindividuals and objects (or some other kinds of entity that may be the\nconstant recipient of reference across worlds). Thus the direct\nreference view applied to such terms says that the semantic value of\nthose terms just is those abstract individuals, and the claim that the\nterms are rigid designators is the claim that they denote the same\nabstract individual, the same natural kind, with respect to all\npossible worlds. Rigid designation is a consequence of direct\nreference (but not vice versa). (See Mart\u00ed 2003 for a\ndiscussion of the relationship between Millianism, direct reference,\nand rigid designation. See also Sullivan 2005.)\n\nTreating kinds as abstract individuals permits an analogue for natural\nkind terms to the natural story concerning the reference of singular\nproper names that emerges from Kripke\u2019s discussion. In the\nsimplest case, an individual receives a name in a naming ceremony, and\nthe use of that name is transferred from speaker to speaker,\npreserving its reference through each transfer. Thus the reference of\na later use is determined by tracing back the route of transmission to\nthe original naming ceremony. In the natural kind case, which is\nrather more of an idealization than the case of a concrete particular,\nthe original naming ceremony picks out a natural kind via an ostension\nof one of its samples. This is the so-called \u2018causal\u2019\ntheory of reference. Note that \u2018causal\u2019 refers to the\ncausal transmission of the use of the name. (Although an ostensive\nreference fixing will be causal, the link between the kind (or its\nsample) and the first use of the kind term could be secured by a\nreference-fixing description. In such as case the reference-fixing\ndescription does merely that; it does not supply a meaning (sense or\nintension).\n\nThus far Kripke\u2019s account of the semantics of natural kind terms\ntreats them very much on a par with proper names, suggesting that\nkinds are much like abstract individuals, being potential recipients\nof singular reference\u2014Millianism has been extended from proper\nnames of individuals to natural kind terms. (Mill\u2019s own view of\n\u2018general terms\u2019 was not Millian in this sense, but closer\nto a Fregean view.) Putnam gives a more elaborate account of the\nreference of natural kind terms, which apparently does not depend on\ntreating kinds as abstract individuals. According to Putnam, the\nextension of a natural kind term is fixed by ostending or otherwise\nidentifying a sample of the kind and appealing, explicitly or\nimplicitly, to a \u2018same kind relation\u2019. Thus the extension\nof \u2018water\u2019 includes all and only those things that bear\nthe same kind relation to some sample, which may be specified loosely,\nfor instance as \u2018the watery stuff around here\u2019 (where\n\u2018watery\u2019 is defined in terms of the manifest\ncharacteristics of water, not in terms of \u2018water\u2019). (Note\nthat Putnam says \u2018same liquid relation\u2019, but that would\nnot provide the extension of a natural kind term, since it would\nexclude the gaseous and solid phases of water.) Putnam (1975a) thereby\nextends the notion of rigid designation to general terms, since (a)\nthe same kind relation is a cross-world relation, and (b) it is\nanchored to a specific, actual world sample. Consequently all samples\nof water in all possible worlds will bear the same kind relation to\none another. That this excludes XYZ depends upon its being the case\nthat a sample that does not share the \u2018important physical\nproperties\u2019 of our sample cannot be of the same kind.\n\nThe view that natural kind terms are rigid designators has\nconsequences for identity statements involving natural kind terms\n(e.g., \u201cbrontosaurus is apatosaurus\u201d). The reason is that\nany identity statement relating two rigid designators is necessarily\ntrue. Hence identity statements involving natural kind terms express\nnecessary truths, even if knowable only a posteriori. Kripke\nregards theoretical identities such as \u2018water =\nH2O\u2019, where one of the terms is a description, as\ninstances of such a posteriori necessary identities. Such a\nclaim requires an argument to show that \u2018H2O\u2019\nis a rigid designator, since it is not a directly referring\nexpression. We may take \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018O\u2019 to\ndesignate hydrogen and oxygen rigidly. However, if the formula\n\u2018H2O\u2019 just means \u2018hydrogen and oxygen\ncompounded in the ratio 2:1\u2019 one might wonder whether, if the\nlaws of nature are contingent, there might be worlds where hydrogen\nand oxygen are compounded in that ratio in such a way that the\nresulting compound does not belong to the same kind as H2O,\nand is not water. If that is possible, then\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is not a rigid designator, and\n\u2018water = H2O\u2019 is not necessary. (As noted\nabove, Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought experiment does not establish\nthe identity of water and H2O\u2014all it establishes is\nthat being constituted of H2O is a necessary condition of\nbeing water. In which case it is consistent with some instances\n(actual and possible) of H2O not being water.) Most\ndiscussions accept that to count H2O as a substance it must\nbe compounded of hydrogen and oxygen in the way that they are actually\ncompounded. The rigid designation of simple, directly referring names\nand kind terms is often explained in terms of their having an\nindexical character. In ideal cases where the name is introduced via\nan ostension of its intended referent, the designation is literal. In\nother cases indexicality is less apparent, as we see in the case of\n\u2018water\u2019 where there is something like an implicit\nostension of \u2018watery stuff around here\u2019 (though\n\u2018water\u2019 could not mean \u2018watery stuff around\nhere\u2019, since then the referent of \u2018water\u2019 would then\nbe different in an XYZ environment). A similar implicit indexicality\nis found in the theoretical specification of kind terms, which\nexplains their rigid character also.\n\nThe Millian view applied to simple natural kind terms faces various\nproblems. One of these problems concerns empty terms.\n\u2018Phlogiston\u2019, \u2018caloric\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019,\n\u2018humour\u2019, are all natural kind terms that fail to refer to\nanything. Millianism implies that there is no semantic difference\nbetween these terms at all. Surely \u2018phlogiston does not\nexist\u2019 and \u2018caloric does not exist\u2019 mean different\nthings; Lavoisier asserted the first and denied the second with\napparent consistency. The most common response to this problem is a\nretreat from pure Millianism for such terms. Some descriptive\nelement is included in their semantics.\n\nThis need not be a full retreat to a Fregean view for two reasons. The\ndescriptive element may not suffice to pick out the kind (in the\nnon-empty cases)\u2014the implicit historical ostension of a sample\nmay be necessary to fix reference. And the description itself may have\nnon-Fregean features\u2014it may have an indexical component, for\nexample, a reference to the actual world, that a Fregean would deny.\nThe retreat from pure Millianism (and a partial vindication of\nMill\u2019s own view of general terms, which Kripke rejected) need\nnot undermine the claim that kind terms are rigid designators. Rigid\ndesignation does not require direct reference; complex theoretical\nexpressions, such as \u2018H2O\u2019, may, as we saw,\nalso be rigid designators.\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that rigid designation for kind and\nother general terms faces a serious objection: rigid designation for\nkind terms is trivial (Soames 2002; Schwartz 2002; Mart\u00ed 2004).\nRigid designation requires that the object designated by a rigid\ndesignator be the same in all worlds. That requirement rules out the\nextension of a kind term as its designation, since the same kind may\nhave different extensions in different worlds. On the other hand,\nregarding the extension as an abstract individual also faces\ndifficulties. One might take \u2018Mary\u2019s favourite\ncolour\u2019 to designate different colours in different worlds, and\nthus understood it is not a rigid designator. But we could take\n\u2018Mary\u2019s favourite colour\u2019 to designate (rigidly) an\nunusual abstract individual Mary\u2019s-favourite-colour,\nwhich has violet things as its extension in the actual world, but\nturquoise things in another possible world and so on. This thought\nexperiment suggests that it is always possible to regard a general\nterm as a rigid designator. One option for resisting this move is to\ndeny that in every case there is some entity for the term to refer to.\nThere is no thing abstract or concrete that is\nMary\u2019s-favourite-colour. Property terms may denote a\nnatural property, in Lewis\u2019s (1986) terms a sparse\nproperty or they do not denote at all. Similarly, natural kind terms\ndenote genuinely natural entities that are likewise sparse or they\nfail to denote.\n4.4 From Reference to Essence?\n\nAbove we saw that an identity statement conjoining two rigid\ndesignators expresses a necessary truth, one that may be knowable only\na posteriori. That follows simply from the definition of\n\u2018rigid designator\u2019. We have also seen that natural kind\nterms are rigid designators. That seems simply to be a fact about the\nsemantics of natural kind terms. Consequently it looks as if a\nnon-trivial metaphysical fact\u2014that there are necessary truths\nknowable only a posteriori\u2014is a consequence of\nKripke\u2019s semantics for natural kind terms. Furthermore, when we\nconsider theoretical identities, such as \u2018water is\nH2O\u2019 and \u2018gold is the element with atomic\nnumber 79\u2019 etc., it appears that we are being given a special\nkind of necessary truth, a truth that it necessary because it\nspecifies the essence of a kind.\n\nThe conclusion that we can derive metaphysical facts from semantic\nones has been regarded as highly questionable by many commentators.\nHow could facts about our use of terms lead to conclusions\nabout the essences of things and kinds? Furthermore, the\nanti-descriptivist semantics involved is closely related to semantic\nexternalism, but the latter need not imply essentialism, as Tyler\nBurge\u2019s social externalism shows (Burge 1979, 1986). Nathan\nSalmon (1982) argues that no non-trivial essentialist consequences can\nbe inferred from a theory of reference.\n\nOne might take the view that the apparent derivation of a metaphysical\nconclusion from semantic premises is a sleight of hand, with hidden\nessentialist premises being smuggled into the argument. If one were to\nassume that \u2018H2O\u2019 is a rigid designator, one\nmight be accused of tacitly assuming metaphysical essentialism.\nHowever, one might alternatively take the view that semantics and\nmetaphysics are more intimately related (Bird 2020). For example, one\nmight hold that the semantics itself makes certain metaphysical\nassumptions, in which case the metaphysics would follow from the\nsemantics, but innocently and for fairly trivial reasons. Note that a\nthoroughgoing Fregean descriptivism also has metaphysical\nconsequences, since it rules out essentialism. According to the view\nthat the correct semantics implies an essentialist metaphysics, the\nsemantic claim that \u2018water\u2019 is a rigid designator is\nitself metaphysically loaded. But this is not to say that Putnam,\nKripke, and other philosophers are smuggling in metaphysical\nassumptions. Rather, it is to say that competent users of the term\ntacitly make those assumptions. Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought\nexperiments make those assumptions explicit. Note that, as the above\ndiscussion has shown, while the thought experiments are normally\nexpressed in the formal mode\u2014we ask whether XYZ would fall\nwithin the extension of the term \u2018water\u2019 (Earth)\u2014the\nessentialist conclusion can be reached directly by phrasing the same\nquestion in the material mode: we ask whether XYZ would be\nwater.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armstrong, D.
