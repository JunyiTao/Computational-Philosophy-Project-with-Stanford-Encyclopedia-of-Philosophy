    "main_text": "What is the Structure of the Real World? || Special Categories\n5.3 Special Categories\n\nAfter covering the modal categories that allow us to distinguish\nbetween ideal and real spheres in PA, and exhaustively covering\nfundamental categories and categorial laws in A, Hartmann covers the\nspecial categories of the two lower strata in N. Hartmann had already\nworked out a number of special categories belonging to the higher\nstrata in earlier work, including the Ethics and the\nProblem of Spiritual Being. Philosophy of Nature\nexamines the ontological dimensions and categories of the\ncosmological, physical, and biological sciences of his day. Paul\nFeyerabend, while otherwise critical of Hartmann, praises Hartmann for\ndeveloping a coherent \u201cphilosophy of process\u201d in this book\n(Feyerabend 1963, 101). In it, Hartmann declares that\n\u201cmathematical physics deals with reality qua measurable, not\nwith reality as such\u201d (N24), and further develops his complex\nsystems conception of living things. Hartmann\u2019s work in these\nareas was influential for scientists like Konrad Lorenz (1903\u20131989)\nand Ludwig Bertalanffy (1901\u20131972), who explicitly refer to him.\nI\u2019ll summarize the special categories of the strata here before\nclosing with a few open questions about specific aspects of\nHartmann\u2019s ontology.\n\nThe lowest stratum of material or physical reality includes, for\nexample, the categories of corporeality, space, time, process,\nsubstance, causality, reciprocity, and dynamic structure and\nequilibrium (N1\u201344). Next, organic beings embody a peculiar organic\nstructure defined in terms of adaptability, purposiveness, metabolism\nor self-regulation, self-restoration, reproductive fitness, and\nhereditary constancy and variation (N45\u201364). In agreement with Scheler\nand the work of many ethologists (Scheler 2009 [1928]), it is widely\nrecognized that many types of animals possess a mental life. This\npsychological or mental stratum includes awareness, unconscious\nprocesses, pleasure and pain, conditioned learning, habit, associative\nmemory, communication, emotional response, problem-solving\nintelligence, and the categories of rigid social relations (NW). The\nstratum of spiritual capacities includes the power of conceptual\nthought, knowledge acquisition, ideal relations, moral evaluation and\nvalues, symbolic communication, teleological reasoning, personality,\nand all of the categories of the complex and variable social\nrelationships evinced by humanity. Historical reality and culture, or\nobjective and objectivated spirit, form the immediate context for a\ncharacteristically human existence (NW; P). Human beings are the most\nvulnerable entities, the most conditioned and dependent; but they have\nknowledge, they can consciously adapt, and they can use other entities\nfor their own purposes (A56b, d, 60a; ELO). The strata laws described\nabove specify why none of these strata is explanatorily reducible to\nanother.\n\nIn recent literature, a number of questions have arisen about\nHartmann\u2019s theory of stratification. One concerns the borderline\nbetween psychological and spiritual strata. Hartmann himself\nacknowledges that the distinction between the psychological and the\nspiritual levels is problematic. Hartmann vacillates as to the\ndelimitations of what is properly psychological. He assigns language,\nconsciousness, and foresight alternatively to the psychological level\nor to the personal level of the spirit. He even claims that the same\nacts of consciousness pertain to both psychic and spiritual being and\nthat only an exact clarification of the phenomenon of mental acts may\nsolve the aporia. Some authors have attempted to clarify\nthese relations (Scognamiglio 2011), while others have pointed out\nthat the overall architecture of the theory of strata of reality, or\nthe relations among the biological, the psychological and spiritual\nlevels, may need to be revised. Put briefly, if the psychological\nlevel ends up including what psychology and cognitive sciences\nacknowledge as psychological phenomena, the dividing line between the\npsychological and the spiritual levels should be located elsewhere,\nand what Hartmann calls personal spirit will become the higher layer\nof the psychological level. The reorganization suggested enables\nconstruction of an entirely different architecture of the three\nlevels, one that passes from a strictly linear organization (one level\nafter the other) to a non-linear, \u201ctriangular\u201d\narchitecture, which would be a major departure from Hartmann\u2019s\noriginal framework (Poli 2001; for other proposals, see Kleineberg\n2016, Dziadkowiec 2011).\n\nAnother question regarding stratification that even Hartmann faced\nduring his lifetime was how this stratified scheme bears on the\nquestion of emergence (or \u201csupervenience\u201d). Hartmann\nhimself explicitly refused to present an emergentist theory, and\ncharacteristically, he left the question whether an\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d account of the emergence of strata could be\nprovided entirely open (NW10). Consequently, it has been argued that\nattempts to treat Hartmann\u2019s ontology as emergentist are flawed\nby their conflation of the granular or hierarchical series of\nentities, as in a mereological hierarchy, with the series of strata\nthemselves (Dahlstrom 2012; Peterson 2016).\n",
