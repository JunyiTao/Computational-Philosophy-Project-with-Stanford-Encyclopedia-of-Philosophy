    "main_text": "\n1. Equality of Opportunity\u2014Constraint or State of Affairs\n\nThe essentials of Equality of Opportunity are most clearly illustrated\nthrough a contrast with Equality of Outcome (for critical reflections\non the contrast see Joseph 1980; Phillips 2004; Strauss 1992).\nAccording to an everyday understanding, the notion of Equality of\nOutcome entails that people should receive the same amount of some\ngood or goods, or enjoy the same rank or status, and deviations are\nalways bad. Whilst \u201cEquality\u201d as an ideal has profound\nsocio-political resonance in popular consciousness, it is\ncomparatively rare to see Equality of Outcome receive an explicit\ndefence (see Tawney 1931, for a forthright defence from the recent\npast). Dworkin (2000: 2) goes further and suggests that not only is\nEquality of Outcome unlikely to seem like a serious political ideal to\nanyone, but there is nothing to be said for it whatsoever (but, see\nPhillips 2004, who defends Equality of Outcome between groups as an\nindicator for Equality of Opportunity between individuals). In\ncontrast, the ideal of Equality of Opportunity commands far more\nwidespread support (Swift 2014: 102; Temkin 2016. For a critique see\nCavanagh 2002). Under Equality of Opportunity differences in outcome\nare justifiable, provided that individuals enjoy the\n\u201copportunity\u201d for the good or rank in the relevant sense\n(for critical reflections on this thought, see Chambers 2009).\n\nEquality of Opportunity can be \u201ccompetitive\u201d in that it\nrefers to a process by which persons compete for a good where some\npersons\u2019 successful pursuit of the good will mean that others\nfail\u2014such as prospective employees applying for a job (for\nemphasis on this facet, see Jacobs 2004). Less commonly, it can be\n\u201cnon-competitive\u201d in that it refers to cases where\npersons\u2019 enjoyment of the good does not directly depend on\nwhether others attain it\u2014such as eligibility for unemployment\nbenefit (see Sreenivasan 2014 for some reflections on how Equality of\nOpportunity is sometimes ambiguous between the two)\n\nThe term Equality of Opportunity can be understood in two broadly\ndifferent, albeit related, ways, which are sometimes combined in\nparticular accounts (for work drawing attention to these broad\ndifferences see Mason 2006; Holmes 2005; Radcliffe Richards 1997:\n265\u2013268) First, Equality of Opportunity is primarily seen as a\nconstraint on selection or distribution decisions for scarce positions\nor goods. For example, it might be claimed that Equality of\nOpportunity prohibits race and gender discrimination in employment\nhiring decisions, to provide applicants with the due consideration\nthey are owed in the process. Here Equality of Opportunity is\nunderstood in terms of permissible and impermissible criteria\ndetermining the allocation of positions. Second, Equality of\nOpportunity is seen as a social ideal concerning the structure of\nsociety as a whole concerning which factors should play a role in\ndetermining how well people fare, perhaps in comparison with one\nanother. For example, it might be claimed a society manifests Equality\nof Opportunity only when social class does not hinder a person\u2019s\noverall prospects for success. Here Equality of Opportunity is\nunderstood as a quality of the social order, rather than a feature of\nselection procedures.\n\nThe basic difference between these respective ways of thinking about\nEquality of Opportunity is that the former focuses primarily on the\nway allocative and selective decisions ought to be made and which\ncriteria should inform those decisions, whereas the latter focuses\nprimarily on whether people enjoy Equality of Opportunity as an\noverall state of affairs. In line with a broad distinction drawn in\nthe context of conceptions of equality more generally, we might call\nthe former \u201cdeontic\u201d conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity and the latter \u201ctelic\u201d conceptions of Equality\nof Opportunity (see Holmes 2005, for exploration of further\ncomplexities).\n\nDespite the general difference between deontic and telic ideas of\nEquality of Opportunity, the distinction between these ways of\nthinking about Equality of Opportunity should not be overdrawn. Both\nways of thinking about Equality of Opportunity focus on the factors\nwhich are relevant or irrelevant to the determination of the\nattainment of advantages but are different to the extent that one\nrelates this to the quality of a decision-making process, and the\nother relates this to the broader distributive profile of society.\nMoreover, the deontic and telic views may be connected in several\nways. For instance, one might hold a deontic view of Equality of\nOpportunity that prohibits sex discrimination in hiring precisely\nbecause prohibiting sex discrimination is judged necessary to\ninstantiate a version of telic Equality of Opportunity, under which\nno-one suffers generally lower social prospects because of their sex\n(for a view that links the wrongfulness of discrimination to Equality\nof Opportunity see Segall 2013). One might also hold that a given\ndeontic view of Equality of Opportunity is conditional on some form of\ntelic Equality of Opportunity. For instance, in university selection\nprocesses, one might hold that it is appropriate to select the best\nqualified candidates (a deontic version of Equality of Opportunity)\nonly when all candidates have enjoyed relevantly equal\nopportunities to achieve qualifications (a telic version of Equality\nof Opportunity) (Clayton 2012: 421). See\n section 10\n below for further discussion.\n2. Conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\n\nEquality of Opportunity is contested (Joseph 1980; Gross 1987), and\ndifferent conceptions of Equality of Opportunity can be distinguished\nfrom one another according to the factors which are seen as\ninappropriate influences on persons\u2019 prospects for success. Take\na committee tasked with selecting between university admissions\napplications trying to determine the appropriate selection criteria\nwhilst honouring the requirement to ensure Equality of Opportunity for\nall candidates. One view amongst the committee could be that Equality\nof Opportunity is satisfied when there is no explicit race or sex\ndiscrimination in the selection process. A further view might be that\nthis is necessary but insufficient, and Equality of Opportunity is\nonly satisfied when legacy admissions, giving preferential treatment\nto family of alumni, are also disallowed. Others on the committee\nmight argue that although it is right that race, sex, and legacy\ndiscrimination should be ruled out in order to ensure Equality of\nOpportunity, the selection criteria should also take into account the\nsocial disadvantages which result in some candidates being better\nqualified than others. Their view is that selection criteria based on\nwhich candidates are best qualified means that socially disadvantaged\ncandidates do not enjoy relevantly equal opportunities to gain\nadmission. The different views voiced within the committee represent\ndifferent views about the factors which are inappropriate to consider\nwhen deciding who is selected and, in that way, they reflect different\nconclusions about what Equality of Opportunity requires. The broader\npoint, then, is that different conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\ndiffer regarding which factors render the \u201copportunity\u201d an\nunequal one.\n\nThe fact that conceptions of Equality of Opportunity differ in this\nway helps explain why the notion of Equality of Opportunity\nis contested. People take different views about which factors are\nmorally significant, and, in turn, which factors should or should not\naffect persons\u2019 prospects for a position or good. In that way,\nEquality of Opportunity can be seen as an essentially contested\nconcept (Gallie 1955). The widespread agreement that Equality of\nOpportunity is a good thing in fact conceals importantly different\nviews about what Equality of Opportunity actually consists in. The\nterm \u201copportunity\u201d in Equality of Opportunity indicates\nthat a good is in some sense available but not necessarily\nguaranteed. (Westen [1985: 839], for instance, suggests an\n\u201copportunity\u201d is less than a guarantee but more than a\nmere possibility.) Depending on one\u2019s conception of Equality of\nOpportunity, possessing an \u201copportunity\u201d may not, however,\nmean that one has any realistic prospect of attaining the position or\ngood in question (Mason 2006: 22\u201326). For instance, it might be\nclaimed of a given society that everyone enjoys the Equal Opportunity\nto become a professional athlete, given that there are no formal\nconstraints on eligibility, however there will be many for whom their\nphysical limitations make this wholly unrealistic (for discussion of\n\u201copportunity\u201d in relation to \u201cfreedom\u201d, see\nCampbell 1974\u201375). Cases such as this lead G. A. Cohen (1989:\n916\u2013917) to draw a distinction between Equality of Opportunity\nand Equality of Access. The thought here is that although we\ndon\u2019t normally say that someone lacks an opportunity\nsimply because their physical or mental capacities limit their ability\nto achieve something, we still need a\nterm\u2014\u201caccess\u201d\u2014with which to articulate\ninequalities that derive from those sources. On this view, although\nthere may be Equal Opportunity to become a professional athlete,\nphysical inequalities mean that there is unequal access to\nbecoming one. Cohen\u2019s recommendation notwithstanding, there are\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity that do use the language of\n\u201copportunity\u201d to refer to such sources of inability. For\ninstance, it might be argued that demarcating separate categories for\nwomen\u2019s sports is a way of providing Equality of Opportunity for\nwomen in sport because an unsegregated category would deprive women of\nthe chance to compete on fair terms, given the physical differences\nbetween men and women (for a critique of this view, see Tannsjo 2007).\nOr it might be argued that the structure of sporting competition as a\nwhole (for instance, the range of available sports) should be\norganized so as to provide for a wider range of physical advantages so\nas to offer Equal Opportunity in sport (English 1978).\n\nThere is also disagreement over whether or not\n\u201copportunity\u201d ought to be understood as a subject\ndependent concept in the sense that an individual\u2019s values bear\non whether something qualifies as relevantly open. For instance,\nParekh (2000: 241) argues that something fails to qualify as an\nopportunity in the relevant sense if taking that path involves\ntransgressing a person\u2019s deeply held commitments\u2014such as\nan orthodox Jew being required to take off their yarmulke as a\nprecondition for doing a certain job. On the other hand, Brian Barry\n(2001: 36\u201338) contends that the range of opportunities a person\nfaces is a matter of the \u201cobjective state of affairs\u201d and\nnot dependent on the values of the person facing those opportunities\nand the choices they make between them. What this indicates, then, is\nthat \u201copportunity\u201d is really a placeholder for the idea\nthat certain factors should not obstruct the availability of a good or\na person\u2019s prospects for success (even if other factors, deemed\nlegitimate, render the good unavailable).\n\nThis way of thinking about different conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity suggests that the range of different conceptions of\nEquality of Opportunity is very broad indeed. Each conception will be\ndistinctive depending on which constellation of factors is deemed to\nobstruct the prospects of success in a way that renders the\nopportunities unequal. One way of roughly ordering different\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity on a continuum of sorts is,\ntherefore, to situate them according to the breadth of factors which\nobstruct Equality of Opportunity. Conceptions which identify\nrelatively few factors which obstruct Equality of Opportunity will be\nat one end of the continuum, with conceptions identifying a larger\nnumber of factors towards the other end (for this broad approach to\norganizing conceptions of Equality of Opportunity, see Cohen 2009:\n4\u20136; Miller 2013: 118\u2013119; Segall 2013: 3\u20134; Swift\n2014: 102\u2013109). Although imprecise, this is a useful way of\ndistinguishing thinner, formal conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\nfrom thicker, more substantial ones.\n3. Formal Equality of Opportunity\n\nThe term Formal Equality of Opportunity is often used to pick out a\nparticular conception of Equality of Opportunity, but it may be better\nunderstood to refer to a family of conceptions under which\nEquality of Opportunity obtains when advantages are in some sense\n\u201copen to all\u201d, even though there are a potentially\nsignificant range of further background factors which will determine\nhow likely it is for individuals to be able to successfully secure\nthem. A particularly thin conception of Formal Equality of Opportunity\nmight hold that persons enjoy equal opportunities simply when there is\nno legal impediment or other coercive restriction on access to the\nposition or good. Laws against women serving in the military, for\ninstance, would mean that women lacked the Equality of Opportunity to\nserve, as would formal exclusion from consideration in the application\nprocess, or women being coercively intimidated not to apply to serve.\nOn this view of Equality of Opportunity, the only factors which render\nthe opportunities unequal are certain restrictions on the freedom of\nsome individuals to compete for or access the position or good in\nquestion.\n\nA slightly thicker conception of Equality of Opportunity might expand\nthis to include a greater range of restrictions on freedom, beyond\nlegal restriction, formal exclusion, and overt coercion. For instance,\nit might be argued that enjoying a meaningful opportunity to compete\nfor a position depends on being in a position to know about the\nexistence of the competition. For this reason, it might be thought\nthat Equality of Opportunity for positions requires that they be\npublicized to a reasonable degree. It might also be argued that\nEquality of Opportunity is undercut by artificially constructed\ntechnical barriers to success deliberately designed to effectively\nexclude certain persons. A clear case of this would be the US during\nthe late nineteenth and twentieth century where literacy tests and\n\u201cgrandfather voting clauses\u201d\u2014whereby voting was\ndisallowed unless one\u2019s grandfather had voted\u2014were aimed\nat the de facto exclusion of \u201cblack\u201d Americans\nfrom exercising their formal voting rights.\n\nThese very thin ways of conceiving of Equality of Opportunity identify\nonly a limited range of factors which count as\nopportunity-undermining. Thus understood, Equality of Opportunity\nrules out caste hierarchy and manifest constraints on competing for or\nobtaining a good but fails to address a broad swathe of other factors\nwhich might plausibly be considered relevant for Equality of\nOpportunity. For this reason, as a political ideal of society or as a\ngenerally appropriate standard for competitive selection in areas like\nemployment and education, these thin conceptions are often considered\nto be inadequate ways of thinking about Equality of Opportunity.\n\nA still thicker conception of Equality of Opportunity, but still\nappropriately classified as Formal, also holds that factors such as\nnepotism and direct discrimination based on factors such as race, sex,\nand religion undermine Equality of Opportunity. Such a way of thinking\nabout Equality of Opportunity thereby identifies a further range of\nfactors that are impermissible determinants of different\npersons\u2019 prospects for success. A useful shorthand is to think\nabout this conception of Equality of Opportunity as including an\nanti-discrimination principle, under which certain factors, like race\nand sex, should not enhance or detract from a person\u2019s prospects\nof success in a competitive application. This matter is complicated by\na number of further considerations. First, some racialized or\nsex-based characteristics may, for some positions or roles, be\nconsidered appropriate criteria for selection\u2014such as selecting\nan actor to play the part of a member of a particular racialized\ngroup. Second, there is a difference between taking certain factors as\nthemselves a reason to select someone and using those factors as\nproxies for identifying other reasons for selection\u2014such as\ntaking honesty and conscientiousness as criteria for selection and\ndrawing on profiling data which suggests that women are generally more\nlikely to have such qualities in greater measure. Third, even when\napplicants are not directly discriminated against on the basis of\nfactors such as race and sex, other criteria for selection might\nindirectly discriminate against individuals with those\ncharacteristics\u2014such as criteria which downgrade applicants who\nmay need extended leave and the potential this has to indirectly\ndiscriminate against women during and after pregnancy.\n4. Meritocratic Equality of Opportunity\n\nTo this point, conceptions of Equality of Opportunity have been\narranged according to the factors which are identified as\ninappropriate determinants of people\u2019s prospects for success. By\nimplication this leaves open which further factors should in fact\ndetermine who succeeds in a competition or who obtains a good. There\nis an influential way of conceiving of Equality of Opportunity which\nincludes the aforementioned conditions on Equality of\nOpportunity\u2014no legal barriers, no formal exclusion,\nanti-discrimination protections\u2014but also adds the requirement\nthat applicants for a position be selected according to who is best\nqualified. Equality of Opportunity, thus understood, requires both\nthat the competition for positions and advantages is open in the\nrelevant ways, and also that the criteria for successful pursuit\nshould be governed by whatever it is which makes competitors best\nqualified to perform a role (James Fishkin 1983; Flew 1981; Daniels\n1978; Mason 2001; Miller 1999: chs. 7\u20139; Sher 1988). This might\nbe termed a \u201cmeritocratic\u201d conception of Equality of\nOpportunity inasmuch this conception requires that persons be judged\non their \u201cmerits\u201d in relation to the post they are\ncompeting for, although it is worth noting that the label\n\u201cmeritocratic\u201d is itself deployed differently in different\nwork. This idea of an open competition, in which success is determined\nby one\u2019s qualifications for a role, is also sometimes referred\nto as \u201ccareers open to talents\u201d. It is worth recalling\nhere that there can be telic or deontic versions of the meritocratic\nconception. Although the notion of the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\nlends itself most naturally to deontic principles concerning the\nappropriate selection criteria for positions, it is coherent to make\njudgements about a meritocratic society overall, and to consider how\nfar people\u2019s prospects overall are determined by their merit as\nopposed to other factors.\n\nThe relationship between formal Equality of Opportunity, as elaborated\nabove, and meritocratic Equality of Opportunity is contested.\nRadcliffe Richards (1997: 260\u2013263), for instance, argues that\nthe two ideas are radically discontinuous and do not have any\nnecessary implications for one another. On the other hand, Mason\n(2006: 29\u201332) argues that it is hard to establish what counts as\nunfair discrimination under the formal view without some account of\nwhat makes something a legitimate qualification, which leads us\ntowards a meritocratic view.\n\nThere are several further things to note about the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity. First, there is nothing in the\nmeritocratic view which entails distribution via free market\nmechanisms, even though such a view is commonly associated with the\nfree market. It is consistent to conceive of a centrally planned\ndistribution of social positions which is governed by best qualified\ncriteria (Mason 2006: 20). Indeed, an unregulated free market may\nquite conceivably involve violations of meritocratic Equality of\nOpportunity if firms discriminate against some applicants. It might be\ntempting to think that a free market naturally tilts towards adopting\na meritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity, given that firms\nin the market will be incentivized to hire employees who will best\nserve firms\u2019 interests. This is predicated on at least two\nfurther suppositions which may not necessarily be true. First, that\nthe \u201cbest qualified\u201d candidate under a meritocratic view\nwill in fact generally best serve the firm\u2019s interest. Second,\nthat firms generally make rational hiring decisions, or at least will\nbe forced to make rational hiring decisions over time.\n\nIndeed, there are a range of further complexities which means that it\nis not straightforwardly true that the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\ncandidate is the same as the candidate which best advances a\nfirm\u2019s interest. For one thing, there are different ways of\nthinking about the value of an open competition which selects the best\nqualified. On one meritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity,\nwhat matters is whether a position is filled with the best qualified\ncandidate, rather than this being done through an \u201copen\ncompetition\u201d. It would be consistent with this view to headhunt\nparticular individuals for roles if this were more efficient at\nidentifying the best qualified. This might still be considered an open\ncompetition under Equality of Opportunity inasmuch as there were no\nrelevant constraints on others becoming the best qualified (and then\nbeing headhunted). On a different meritocratic conception, though,\nthere is a reason to value an open competition, even if that will\nsometimes result in a less well-qualified candidate being selected,\nbecause doing so putatively gives potential candidates a relevantly\nfair chance at attaining the position. The difference between these\nviews, at bottom, is how far one values Equality of Opportunity for\nthe outcomes it delivers (the best qualified attaining the positions)\nas compared with the procedures it instantiates (the opportunities\nafforded to all to attain the position under a best qualified\nselection criteria). Both outcome and procedural oriented versions of\nthe meritocratic conceptions of Equality of Opportunity are consistent\nwith condemning certain kinds of profiling, even when profiling would\nbe a rational way of furthering a firm\u2019s interest (for a survey\nof reasons to be troubled by statistical discrimination of this kind,\nsee Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). For instance, suppose data supported the\nconclusion that appealing to sex or racialized group membership was a\ngood proxy for performance in a certain role, and that a firm could\nmake substantial efficiency savings in the hiring process by using\nsuch a proxy. A procedural version of meritocratic Equality of\nOpportunity might naturally condemn this form of profiling as\ninconsistent with a relevantly open competition for the position,\ngiven that potentially qualified individuals are disadvantaged using\nthe proxy. But even an outcome-oriented version has scope for\ncondemning the profiling, either on the grounds that it violates a\nmoral side-constraint, or on the grounds that it remains imperfect at\nidentifying the best qualified (even if it is more efficient than\nother alternatives).\n\nFurthermore, it may be morally troubling for an employer to take into\naccount certain employee characteristics, even when those\ncharacteristics render an employee \u201cbetter qualified\u201d for\na role in a way that serves the employer\u2019s interest. Consider a\nrestaurant owner seeking to hire a new waiter. The restaurant owner\nwants to appoint the candidate who is the best qualified according to\ncriteria which include being punctual, diligent, honest, and likely to\npromote repeat custom amongst the clientele, with the latter being\noverwhelmingly important. Suppose, however, that the restaurant is in\nan area rife with racist prejudice against members of certain\nracialized minority groups and that members of those groups are held\nin contempt by the majority of the local population, who constitute\nthe vast majority of the restaurant clientele. Though the restaurant\nowner does not harbour any racial prejudice themselves, they also know\nthat hiring a racialized minority will positively undermine repeat\ncustom. An antidiscrimination principle, which prohibits directly\ndiscriminating against applicants on racialized grounds, seems to be\nin tension with an unmodified meritocratic principle that requires\nappointing the best qualified in this sense. Any racialized minority\nindividual will be less \u201cwell-qualified\u201d, given the racial\nprejudice present in the local community. In this way, norms and\npreferences which would be inadmissible to directly consider might\nnevertheless filter through to determine who is successful in the\ncompetition by determining who satisfies the \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d criteria.\n\nBecause such qualifications\u2014like the ability to encourage repeat\ncustom\u2014depend on the reactions of recipients of a service, they\nare sometimes referred to as \u201creaction\u201d qualifications\n(Alexander 1992; Lippert-Rasmussen 2009; Lippert-Rasmussen 2014: ch.\n9; Mason 2017; Wertheimer 1983). Many reaction qualifications will\nappear quite unproblematic. For instance, a department store might\nwant to hire customer-facing staff that are considered polite, or a\ncomedy club might want to hire acts that punters find funny. However,\nexamples such as the case of the racist local community cast doubt on\nwhether this is true of all reaction qualifications and raise the\nquestion as to which kinds of reactions are legitimate to take into\naccount and which are not (Lippert-Rasmussen 2009; Mason 2017). The\nspectre of morally suspect reaction qualifications is a further\nindication that the relationship between firms\u2019 interests and a\nmeritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity might not be\nstraightforward.\n\nMore generally, it is worth remembering that the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity\u2014an open competition\nselecting the best qualified\u2014does not itself tell us which\npositions should exist in society; what makes someone \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d for those positions; and how those positions should\nbe rewarded. Nothing in the meritocratic conception, for instance,\ntells us which jobs should be available and at what levels of\ndifferential reward. Indeed, although the meritocratic conception\ntends to be seen as a justification for inequalities, it is\ntechnically consistent with a meritocratic conception of Equality of\nOpportunity that different social positions do not offer differential\nlevels of reward.\n\nMoreover, just as the meritocratic conception is consistent with\nnon-free market allocation of positions, it is also consistent with\npositions in society being organized in a range of different ways,\nprovided the selection for those positions is open to all and filled\naccording to the best qualified criteria. Suppose we have a factory\nproduction line with a number of workstations which each require very\ndifferent skills to operate. The first requires heavy lifting, the\nsecond requires quick thinking, the third requires manual dexterity,\nthe fourth requires attention to detail. There are different ways in\nwhich working practices could be organized amongst employees. One\noption would be to have each employee specialize in working only one\nstation. Another option would be to have each employee work each\nstation for a period of several weeks and then rotate to work another\nstation for several weeks and so on. A further option would be to have\nemployees work each of the stations throughout the day, so that they\nfollowed the good they are producing and worked with it at each\nstation. The meritocratic conception is indifferent as to how the\nfactory work practices are organized, provided the employees are\nselected under an open competition according to their qualifications.\nYet which workplace practices are adopted may have significant\nimplications for whom it is appropriate to select as an employee. The\nfirst option may favour selecting those who are adept at specializing\nin one of the relevant workplace tasks; the second option may favour\nselecting those who are versatile in the sense that they are able to\nacquire a number of different skills; the third option may favour\nselecting those who are adaptable in the sense that they are able to\nefficiently shift between different tasks during the same process. The\nsame is true when it comes to the structure of society as a whole,\nsuch that which positions are available will have profound\nimplications for who has the best chance to attain them (for critiques\nwhich emphasize these factors, see Markovits 2019; Sandel 2020). And\nthere will be a further question with respect to level of reward\ndifferent positions ought to be given. Because meritocratic Equality\nof Opportunity, thus understood, is silent on these further questions\nconcerning how society should be organized, and how far persons should\nhave an equal opportunity to become the best qualified, it is\nregarded by some as a relatively limited component of the justice of\nsociety as a whole.\n5. Substantive Equality of Opportunity\n\nThe meritocratic conception above is a relatively formal view of\nEquality of Opportunity. It holds that persons enjoy equal\nopportunities in the relevant sense provided they are not obstructed\nby legal or certain technical obstacles or by some forms of\ndiscrimination, and that under such conditions persons should compete\nfor positions under a process designed to select the best qualified.\nIn one sense, the meritocratic conception is quite a strict one\nconcerning the factors which are allowed to determine who successfully\ntakes advantage of their opportunities, in that, under the \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d criteria, only qualities appropriate to the position\nor good rightly determine the outcome of competitive applications.\nHowever, the meritocratic conception remains relatively formal in that\nit does not take into account broader obstacles to getting qualified\n(or, indeed, which qualifications ought to be rewarded) and so does\nnot take into account a wider range of factors which might have a\nsubstantial bearing on persons\u2019 chances to successfully compete\nfor social advantages (B. Barry 2005: ch.8)\n\nA famous illustration of this concern is given by Bernard Williams,\nwho offers the example of a society in which great prestige is\nattached to membership in a certain warrior class (Williams 1962\n[1973]).  Historically, members of the class were recruited from the\nwealthy class in society only, but reforms have resulted in the\ncompetition for membership now becoming open to all members in\nsociety. Under the terms of the competition the warriors are selected\nbased on their physical strength. Although the competition for\nselection is now an open one, it transpires that warriors are still\nonly selected from the wealthy class in society because the population\nin other social classes is so under-nourished that they lack the\nphysical strength to successfully compete for warrior status. It might\nbe argued that meaningful Equality of Opportunity for membership in\nthe warrior class has not really been achieved because the means to\ncompete on relevantly equal terms are denied to some\ncompetitors\u2014those from poorer social classes lack a realistic\nprospect for successfully satisfying the criteria for selection, in\nthis case physical strength.  One response here might be to argue that\nEquality of Opportunity\nis satisfied because those from poorer social classes are not\nbeing excluded because they are poor, but simply because they\nare physically weaker, which is a relevant criterion for selection to\nthe warrior class. In reply, it might be argued that this would amount\nto a merely formal and insubstantial way of thinking about Equality of\nOpportunity, given that those from the poorer social classes are\neffectively excluded, even if they are not explicitly barred (see\nWilliams 1962 [1973: 244\u2013245]).\n\nFor this reason, it might be thought that Equality of Opportunity\nrequires that people enjoy the substantive means to take advantage of\nthe formal opportunities available to them through open competition.\nViews which take this line can be broadly categorized as\nsubstantive conceptions of Equality of Opportunity. As with\ndifferent formal conceptions of Equality of Opportunity, substantive\nconceptions differ with respect to the way in which the opportunities\nshould be substantive.\n\nSuppose we complicate slightly Williams\u2019 warrior society example\nand say that warrior selection is based on physical strength, agility,\nand sword skills. Suppose that adequate nutrition is necessary for\nphysical strength, and sufficient physical strength is in turn\nrequired to develop the right agility and wield the heavy sword that\nthe warriors use. One substantive view might hold that Equality of\nOpportunity is secured when, and only when, citizens from all social\nclasses enjoy adequate nutrition. All citizens then have some\nrealistic prospect of developing the physical strength which is\nnecessary to procuring the further qualities that enable them to\nmeaningfully compete for warrior positions. However, suppose further\nthat the schools to which members of the wealthy class send their\nchildren offer agility training and sword skills classes as part of\nthe curriculum, whereas children from poorer classes go to schools\nwithout these lessons. It might be argued that although children have\nnutrition sufficient to give them some degree of meaningful\ncompetition, they do not have a relevantly equal prospects, given the\nother educational disadvantages they face relative to others. These\neducational inequalities might be countered by instituting an outreach\nprogram which rolls out the same forms of training in education to all\nother schools in less wealthy parts of the society.\n\nOne might take the view that this would now be sufficient to create\nthe conditions for Equality of Opportunity, given that these\neducational inequalities across different social classes have been\naddressed. The elimination of those educational inequalities is likely\nto result in increased competition for selection to the warrior class,\ngiven that a larger pool of children possess a more meaningful\nprospect of developing the necessary qualities. As a consequence,\nsuppose that wealthy families begin investing in private sword skill\ntuition for their children and that the tuition is far too expensive\nfor parents in poorer social classes to afford. If this tuition gives\nchildren from wealthy social classes a competitive advantage, it might\nbe argued that this undermines Equality of Opportunity, given that\nopportunities for children to successfully enter the warrior class are\nnot relevantly equal. It should be clear from this, then, that\ndifferent substantive views can be distinguished depending on the\nrange of factors they identify as those which undermine Equality of\nOpportunity.\n6. Fair Equality of Opportunity\n\nOne prominent substantive conception of Equality of Opportunity which\naddresses factors such as the investment in sword skill tuition by\nparents in the wealthy social class is the one offered by John Rawls\nthat he labels Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO). There are two\ncomponents to FEO. First, offices and positions are to be open to all\nin a formal sense under \u201ccareers open to talent\u201d, or, as\nit has been labelled above, the meritocratic conception (Rawls 1999:\n53, 57, 62). This is supplemented with the further requirement that\nall should have the fair chance to attain those offices and\npositions (Rawls 1999: 63; 2001: 43\u201344). A fair chance here\nmeans that\n\n\nthose who have the same level or talent and ability and the same\nwillingness to use these gifts should have the same prospects of\nsuccess regardless of their social class of origin. (Rawls 2001:\n44)\n\n\nIn other words, it is consistent with FEO that persons\u2019\nprospects for success vary depending on their levels of talent and\nabilities and their willingness to use them, however persons\u2019\nsocial class should not differentially affect those prospects (see\nalso Miller 1996).\n\nRawls\u2019s FEO is substantive by way of taking account of the\nbackground conditions which differentially affect persons\u2019\nrespective chances of fulfilling the meritocratic selection criteria.\nFEO does not obtain when social class structure results in persons\nfrom some social classes facing diminished prospects for obtaining the\nskills and qualifications necessary to compete on relevantly equal\nterms with others. For instance, if children from less privileged\nsocial backgrounds face lower quality education which results in\nlesser prospects for developing the skills and self-discipline to\ncompete for rewarding jobs, FEO fails to obtain, even though selection\nfor those jobs is based on meritocratic criteria. In this context,\nincome inequalities between social classes and the education system,\nbroadly construed, are plausibly important factors in determining how\nfar persons face relevantly equal prospects.\n\nOn its face, Rawls\u2019s FEO is a simple idea. Talent and effort are\nappropriate criteria for success in the competition for socially\nadvantageous positions and roles, but differences in social class\nbackground should neither directly influence the competition, nor\nindirectly influence how far persons can develop talent or make an\neffort. That simplicity belies many further complications, however\n(for a forthright critique see Arneson 1999).\n\nFirst, Rawls frames FEO as opposing the unequal effects of\n\u201csocial class\u201d (Rawls 1999: 63). At other times, Rawls\npresents FEO as addressing differences in \u201cincome class\u201d\n(Rawls 1999: 270). He also uses the term \u201csectors in\nsociety\u201d to seemingly refer to the same idea (Rawls 1999: 63).\nIt is not clear whether Rawls intends these different terms to be\nequivalent. After all, one can in principle envisage a society in\nwhich income levels are all equal and yet a social class system of\nsome form exists, whereby there is a hierarchy of rank and status and\ncitizens in the upper echelons enjoy social goods and opportunities\nunrelated to income (for some discussion of the relation between\nmaterial inequality and social inequality, see B. Barry 1998; Wolff\n2017). If only income class differences are objectionable\ninfluences on persons\u2019 opportunities under FEO, then this social\nhierarchy is unobjectionable, even if it has a profound effect on the\nchances different persons have to compete for social positions. A\nsensible reading of Rawls takes him to understand social class to\ninclude income differences without being exhausted by such\ndifferences. This, of course, raises the further question of what is\nto count as a \u201csocial class\u201d or \u201csocial\nsector\u201d based inequality.\n\nThe focus on social class specifically also makes FEO appear\nrelatively narrow. Insofar as FEO holds that social class should not\naffect persons\u2019 prospects to succeed, it seems to imply that\nunequal prospects within social classes are unobjectionable.\nFor instance, if children from rich backgrounds generally receive a\nbetter education which gives them a substantial advantage in the job\nmarket, this would be clearly incompatible with FEO. However, consider\nthe case where this is not true as a general matter but simply that\nonly some rich families invest heavily in their\nchildren\u2019s education such that only that subset of children from\nrich backgrounds have substantial advantages. Alternatively, in a\nstill more contrived example, suppose that social class is completely\nuncorrelated with public educational development and that state\neducation is equalized across society but that particular families,\nrandomly distributed across different social classes, invest heavily\nin their children\u2019s education to give them a competitive\nadvantage in later life. In both instances, the inequalities in\nprospects do not appear to be objectionable under FEO if FEO is\nunderstood to object to inequalities resulting from social\nclass. However, if FEO is designed to ensure a fair chance to\nobtain jobs and positions and this means, in Rawls\u2019s terms,\n\u201cthat those with similar abilities and skills should have\nsimilar life chances\u201d (Rawls 1999: 63), then it seems that these\nother non-class-based inequalities should also be deemed\nobjectionable.\n\nSecond, it might be argued that there is a tension inherent in FEO. On\nthe one hand social class inequality is considered to be an\ninappropriate source of competitive advantage. On the other hand,\nunder FEO, differences in talent and effort are appropriate\ncriteria for competitive selection for jobs. And yet, it is natural to\nsuppose that social class affects the development of talent and has an\nimpact on how much effort people are willing to make (Anderson 2004;\nElford 2016; Swift & Marshall 1997; for related discussion see\nChambers 2009: 379\u2013381). One option to avoid this tension would\nbe to say that differences in native talent and\nnative disposition to make an effort are appropriate\ndeterminants of success in competition for social advantage. So even\nthough developed levels of talent and effort will differ due to social\nclass influences, we should select for jobs based on the native\ncharacteristics. The problem, here, is that it is not clear whether\nnative talent and native disposition to make an effort pick out\nanything especially socially significant (Anderson 2004), or\nstraightforwardly measurable. And this seems to be a radical departure\nfrom most ways of understanding what makes a candidate\n\u201cbest-qualified\u201d under the meritocratic element of FEO. A\ntall, well-coordinated and exceptionally athletic person might have\nvery high native talent for becoming a basketball player, but if they\nhave not spent any of their life developing a talent for basketball\nthey are hardly more \u201cwell-qualified\u201d for team selection\nthan someone with less native talent but who has otherwise much more\nadvanced skill at basketball. In short, it seems to be talent and\neffort at the more developed end (or at least with enough remaining\npotential to be developed) which seem to matter under the meritocratic\nconception, and yet the \u201cfair chance\u201d element of FEO seems\nto hold that it is inappropriate for those with superior developed\ntalent to have an advantage in the competition for positions when the\nsuperiority of that talent is the result of social class factors\n(James Fishkin 1983: 30\u201332).\n\nA third complication when thinking about FEO is that social class\ncleavages might reflect factors which account for unequal\nopportunities without it being straightforwardly the case that social\nclass directly causes those unequal opportunities. Suppose social\nclass stratification is well-correlated with later success in the\ncompetition for jobs, such that social class is a strong predictor for\njob market success. As illustrated above, one typical way in which\nsocial class might result in unfair chances to compete for socially\nadvantageous positions is by giving children from privileged social\nclasses better education, broadly construed, in order to give them a\nbetter prospect at becoming the best qualified. Consider a possible\nalternative explanation of the correlation. It could be the case that\nthere is a higher level of native talent in the more\nadvantaged social class and very little inter-class mixing, such that\ncitizens in the advantaged social class only tend to meet, partner up\nwith, and bear children with fellow members of the same social class.\nPerhaps this results in native talent levels being inherited by the\nchildren born in that same social class, leading to the same process\ncontinuing. In that way, the high native talent levels are\nself-perpetuating and the lack of inter-class mixing results in the\ncorrelation between social class and job market success continuing\nover time. The question is what should FEO say about this? Social\nclass position is a strong predictor of job market success, but not\nbecause social class factors influence the development of talent and\neffort. Of course, it could still be said that social class plays a\nformative role in the relationship between social class and job market\nsuccess precisely because social class norms and expectations shape\nand condition the degree of inter-class mixing in the society. So, the\nresulting stratification of talent and effort along class lines is not\nitself independent of the operation of social class. Still, although\nsocial class is a part of the explanation for the inequalities in the\ncompetition for social positions, the role it plays seems importantly\ndifferent. In this case social class does not directly influence the\ndevelopment of talent and effort for children who already\nexist\u2014by way of greater educational resources for some children\nover others, for instance\u2014but, rather, social class determines\nwhich children are born in which social classes to begin with.\n\nA further case in which social class and the development of talent\nmight be connected is in the development of native talent\nduring gestation. For instance, if pregnant women from less advantaged\nsocial classes lack the means for adequate nutrition, this may affect\nthe \u201cnative talent\u201d of the children they bear. In that\nsense social class might differentially affect a child\u2019s\nprospects in the competition for socially advantageous position even\nbefore birth, and not simply by way of post-birth education and\ndevelopment (B. Barry 2005: 47\u201350; Kollar & Loi 2015; Loi,\nDel Savio, & Stupka 2013).\n\nFourth, as with formal equality of opportunity, FEO does not itself\naddress which rewards ought to be attached to the different roles and\npositions (although other parts of Rawls\u2019 theory constrain\npermissible inequalities). As a consequence, it\u2019s possible that,\nunder FEO, winning or losing in the competition for certain social\npositions will have substantial implications for one\u2019s later\nopportunities. The clearest illustration of this are the opportunities\nafforded in later life through success in the education system.\nSuccess in the competition for school and university places results in\nthe development of merit and the enhancement of qualifications for\nthose successful candidates, which in turn gives them advantages when\nit comes to the competition for desirable social roles and positions.\nThe cycle continues where success in that later competition for entry\nlevel social roles can similarly offer advantages in competition for\nfurther social roles. Success within the education system can thereby\nset some those successful candidates on a pathway towards a range of\nsubsequent opportunities whilst cleaving away unsuccessful candidates\nto a position of disadvantage, unable to compete for a range of roles\nand positions for which success in an earlier competition in education\nwas required. And yet, this is apparently consistent with FEO,\nprovided all individuals enjoyed a relevantly fair chance to compete\non the basis of merit for those earlier opportunities in education.\nJoseph Fishkin (2014) labels this type of structure of opportunities a\n\u201cbottleneck\u201d and commends a mechanism of\n\u201copportunity pluralism\u201d to address it. Under opportunity\npluralism there are a larger number of pathways over the course of\npersons\u2019 lives to successfully compete for different goods,\nrather than a narrower route to securing those goods through success\nin a limited range of competitions earlier in life (Joseph Fishkin\n2014: ch. 3). Similarly, Jacobs (2004) argues that a defensible\nconception of Equality of Opportunity ought to regulate the rewards\nand losses (the \u201cstakes\u201d) in competitions for role and\npositions and both broaden the distribution of opportunities to gain\nas well as limit the degree to which individuals can gain and lose in\neach competition.\n\nA fifth complication again relates to the potential narrowness of FEO\nas Rawls states the idea. Social class is typically understood to\nrelate to a stratification of persons along a rough cluster of social\nand economic dimensions. In that sense it is different from other ways\nin which people might be grouped together and face disadvantages as\nmembers of a group. It is different, for example, from racialized\ngroup membership, gender, and sex. Insofar as FEO addresses only\nsocial class disadvantages, rather than these other potential\nsources of unfair disadvantages, it might be thought to fail to\naddress other factors which undermine meaningful Equality of\nOpportunity (Wolff 2017). For instance, although direct race, gender,\nand sex discrimination in hiring is ruled out under FEO (by dint of\nthe requirement that positions be \u201copen to all\u201d),\nracialized group membership, gender, and sex might be a source of\nunfair disadvantage in less direct ways (Rawls 1999: 129\u2013130).\nSusan Moller Okin (1989) argues, for example, that the gendered\nstructure of the family is a major obstacle to Equality of Opportunity\nfor women and girls, particularly because women are usually the\nprimary caregivers for children. The unequal share of household labour\nundercuts Equality of Opportunity for women, both within and outside\nthe family unit itself, given that women\u2019s opportunities for\neconomic success and attainment of political office are so constrained\nby what is required of them in the home (Okin 1989: 116, 123; for\ndiscussion of some of the measures which might be taken to equalize\nopportunities between men and women in relation to this, see Bergmann\n2008; Brighouse & Wright 2008; Gheaus & Robeyns 2011; Gornick\n& Meyers 2008).\n\nThere are at least four mechanisms by which such factors might affect\nhow far people enjoy meaningfully equal opportunities. First, societal\nfactors related to racialized group membership and gender might\ninfluence the development of the talents relevant for selection under\nthe meritocratic conception. For instance, suppose conceptions of\nchildren\u2019s aptitude for certain subjects in schools are\nprejudiced on racialized or gender lines, resulting in members of some\nracialized groups or one gender being disproportionately streamed into\nclasses where the quality of education is lower. In this case, their\nprospects for future success in the job market are diminished by\nfactors other than social class. Second, societal factors other than\nsocial class might be thought to affect the development of ambition\nand the disposition to make an effort. Take a society where\nconceptions of race and gender are socially salient, and\nchildren\u2019s pursuit of career paths tends to be heavily\ninfluenced by whether or not they see others with the same racialized\nor gender characteristics succeeding in those vocations. Children\nmight simply fail to recognize a vocation as a possible path\n\u201cfor someone like them\u201d if there are very few others\nsucceeding in that vocation who share their characteristics. In this\nway, it might be argued that factors other than social class can\ndampen ambition and effort-making dispositions in ways that undercut\nmeaningful equal opportunity for certain jobs and roles. Third, there\nmight be certain social constraints on participation in the\ncompetition for socially advantageous positions that are\nnon-developmental but reflect more general norms and expectations\nconcerning who should apply for jobs and what a person has to\nsacrifice to do so (Phillips 2006). For instance, dominant social\nexpectations concerning women\u2019s role as primary caregivers might\nbe thought to constrain equal opportunity for participation in the\nlabour market beyond the household. Fourth, and relatedly, as noted\nabove in\n section 5,\n because FEO leaves open what constitutes a talent, a scheme of FEO\nmight, in principle, leave in place systematic disadvantages for\nmembers of certain groups. For instance, even if there is no direct\nsex-based discrimination against women in employment selection, a lack\nof workplace accommodation for leave during pregnancy, and measures\ndesigned to ensure that such absence is not disadvantageous, might be\nconsidered indirect discrimination against women. To address such\npotential sources of inequality, it might be argued that FEO should be\nbroadened (Miller 2013: 122\u2013123, although Miller is skeptical\nthat Rawls can accommodate all of the inequality upsetting effects of\nfamily life). Under such an adapted version of FEO, then, enjoyment of\na \u201cfair chance\u201d to develop the talent and effort required\nfor success in the competition for role and offices must take account\nof factors beyond \u201csocial class\u201d. Which factors do and do\nnot undermine a \u201cfair chance\u201d will, of course, be a matter\nof further debate between different conceptions of FEO thus\nconstrued.\n7. Equality of Opportunity and the Family\n\nOne thing these matters draw our attention to, however, is the\npotential for Equality of Opportunity to conflict with other\nconsiderations and values. A substantial amount of work has been\ndevoted to the scope for conflict between the demands of Equality of\nOpportunity and the role of the family in particular (Brighouse &\nSwift 2009; James Fishkin 1983; 1987; Joseph Fishkin 2014:\n48\u201356; MacLeod, 2002; Mason 2006: ch. 3; Miller 2013;\nMunoz-Dard\u00e9 1999; Okin 1989; Swift 2005). As indicated above,\ndifferent families will foster different environments and take\ndifferent measures for children which will often manifest in\ndifferences in prospects. Indeed, Rawls himself notes that \u201cthe\nfamily may be a barrier to equal chances between individuals\u201d\ngiven that\n\n\nthe internal life and culture of the family influence, perhaps as much\nas anything else, a child\u2019s motivation and his capacity to gain\nfrom education, and so in turn his life prospects. (Rawls 1999:\n265)\n\n\nRawls maintains that FEO does not require the eradication of such\ndifferences across families, because it only requires correcting for\nsocial class inequality (Rawls 1999: 265, although other passages in\nRawls seem in tension with this, for instance where he concedes that\nFEO can \u201cbe only imperfectly carried out, at least as long as\nsome form of the family exists\u201d (1999: 64)). Nevertheless,\nbecause the existence of the family as a social institution will\nalways result in unequal chances for different individuals, he poses\nthe question\n\n\nIs the family to be abolished then? Taken by itself and given a\ncertain primacy, the idea of equality of opportunity inclines in this\ndirection. (Rawls 1999: 448)\n\n\nThere is a tension, then, between the existence of the family and the\nrealization of equal prospects for all individuals in society. What is\nmore, as Rawls\u2019s remarks suggest, the tension does not seem to\nbe particular only to modes of family organization in present-day\nsocieties but seems to pertain to any conceivable form of the family\n(James Fishkin 1983: 48\u201349). This provokes the question of\nwhether the family is inconsistent with a defensible conception of\nEquality of Opportunity and, if they are incompatible with one\nanother, how far, if at all, should the activities of the family be\ncircumscribed by the requirements of Equality of Opportunity (for an\nargument that they are not necessarily incompatible, see\nArneson 2002 [2015]).\n\nA number of considerations will have a bearing on the answer to that\nquestion, including the kinds of values that the family embodies or\nserves (for instance, manifesting intimate relationships and nurturing\nresponsible, conscientious future citizens), which kinds of activities\nare integral to the family and its service of those values (for\ninstance, family members engaging in shared leisure and learning),\nwhether there are alternative sources of those values other than the\nfamily as traditionally organized (such as, perhaps, state-run\ncollective child-rearing), how far the equality-disrupting effects of\nthe family can be mitigated by other social measures (for instance, by\ncompensation or affirmative action), and, of course, which factors can\njustly affect differences in peoples\u2019 social prospects.\n\nOne thing worth noting here is that there are different ways of\nconceiving of Equality of Opportunity in relation to such questions.\nThe first independently identifies which factors obstruct\npersons\u2019 enjoyment of a fair chance\u2014such as facing a less\nnurturing family environment\u2014and then considers how far such\nunfairness should circumscribe the activities of the family and/or\ncommend other corrective social measures. On this approach, for\ninstance, one might conclude that differential family nurturing does\nindeed disrupt Equality of Opportunity\u2014because it undermines\nfair life chances\u2014but one might conclude that the values served\nby the family justify tolerating some degree of loss of Equality of\nOpportunity. The second involves specifying Equality of Opportunity\nafter taking into account other values, such as those served\nby the family. On this approach, one might conclude that the nurturing\nrole played by the family is so fundamentally important that even\nthough it creates unequal prospects, those unequal prospects are a\nprice worth paying for a society organized around familial care. On\nthis second way of thinking about Equality of Opportunity, however,\nthose unequal prospects do not undermine Equality of Opportunity\nprecisely because they are justified by the value of an institution\nsuch as the family. The former uses the label \u201cEquality of\nOpportunity\u201d to pick out the pro tanto consideration of\nunfairness involved in differential prospects, the latter uses the\nlabel \u201cEquality of Opportunity\u201d to pick out the\n\u201cmore-things-considered\u201d conclusion about which\ndifferential prospects remain unjustified by other values. The\ndifference between these two ways of thinking about Equality of\nOpportunity is not necessarily substantive. Rather, they differ in\nrespect of the degree to which \u201cEquality of Opportunity\u201d\nas an ideal takes into account values other than inequality in\nprospects.\n\nOne account famous for its advocating the abolition of the family is\nfound in Plato\u2019s Republic (V 457). Even those who place\nsignificant weight on a thick understanding of Equality of Opportunity\nhave tended to resist this conclusion, not necessarily because they\nconclude that Equality of Opportunity can be entirely reconciled with\nthe existence of the family, but because the existence of the family\nis often defended as indispensable for serving certain values.\n\nAn apparently straightforward reason to object to the abolition of the\nfamily is that it would place constraints on the freedom and autonomy\nof parents to raise children. Although it is widely accepted that\nparental rights to rear children are limited by the interests of the\nchildren within the family, for many parents raising children is an\nimportant source of flourishing and the abolition of the family would\nconstitute a constraint on this. Indeed, whether or not child-rearing\nis in fact a source of flourishing for any given potential parent, it\nmight still be thought to constrain a potential parent\u2019s\nautonomy if the state were to prohibit that life-choice. One challenge\nto such a parent-centred defence of the family and the parental rights\nassociated with it, draws attention to the difficulty of justifying\nrights of control over others based on the controlling party\u2019s\nown interests (Brighouse & Swift 2006: 82). Rather than justifying\nthe institution of the family on the grounds of parents\u2019\ninterest, one might point to other interests at stake in the form of\nthe interests of children, or in the interests of third parties.\n\nOne such suggestion is that the family is more reliable at cultivating\ncertain capacities for flourishing in children than any alternative\nsocial arrangement (Brennan & Noggle 1997; Munoz Dard\u00e9\n1999). There are a range of accounts here, but the basis of broad\nalignment is that familial relationships are generally of important\nservice to children\u2019s interests, either in order to equip\nchildren with the wide range of capacities necessary for healthy\ndevelopment and self-determination (Munoz Dard\u00e9 1999), or in\norder to provide the preconditions for a flourishing childhood\n(Brennan 2014). A child-centred account of this kind still seems to\nneed to explain why the family should not still be subject to\nsubstantial constraints when such constraints are necessary to help\nequip other children, outside the family, with such capacities. If\nthere are certain goods that can only be provided for children through\nparental nurture within the family, what does this imply for broader\nsocial obligations to ensure that all children enjoy relevantly equal\nopportunities to enjoy those goods?\n\nA further, compatible, claim is that the institution of the family can\nbe justified by its service to the interest of third parties. It is\nsometimes argued that children are a type of public good (Folbre 1994;\n2008; Olsaretti 2013) whose development as future citizens has\nsignificant implications for the social order as a whole. In this\ncontext, Jennifer Roback Morse (1999) argues, for instance, that the\nfamily plays an indispensable role in raising persons capable of\ntrust, co-operation, and self-restraint. A well-functioning society\ndepends on sufficient numbers of citizens possessing such traits such\nthat they can engage in the forms of social co-operation necessary to\nsustain collective self-governance.\n\nPerhaps the most notable parent-centred account in recent years is\noffered by Brighouse and Swift (2006), who argue that parents\u2019\ninterests are served by certain control rights over children and that\nthose parental interests also permit certain forms of parental\npartiality towards children which will naturally disrupt Equality of\nOpportunity (2009). They argue that\n\n\nParents enjoy a distinctively valuable relationship with their\nchildren; one that is intimate and mutually loving,\n\n\nand that\n\n\nthe institution of the family allows [the parent] to have [this]\nrelationship of a kind that cannot be substituted for by relationships\nwith other adults. (Brighouse & Swift 2009: 53\u201354)\n\n\nIn other words, the internal life of the family, along with shared\nactivities, experiences and even values between its members, support a\ndistinctive source of intimacy between parent and child which offers a\ndistinctive source of flourishing for parents. Other relationships are\nnot substitutable with those between parent child, so the abolition of\nthe family would mean that a particular, and valuable, source of\nflourishing would be lost. In order to create, sustain, and enjoy\nrelationships of such value, parents need to be able to do things with\nand for their children, and this will inevitably tend to create\ndifferences between families, leading some children to benefit more\nthan others. Although this will almost certainly disrupt Equality of\nOpportunity, Brighouse and Swift suggest that the value of these\nintimate relationships is a potential justification for such\ninequality. Some activities will be necessary to nourish these\nrelations of intimacy, whereas others will not. In the group of\nactivities that will be necessary, Brighouse and Swift (2009: 57) give\nthe examples of reading bedtime stories to children and parents\nenrolling children in associations which will enable them to\nparticipate in communities of value that can be shared between parent\nand child. In contrast, it is very unlikely that enrolling children in\nexpensive private schools designed to maximize their future\nopportunities, or investing in trust funds, will be essential for\nparent and child to enjoy the goods distinctively supported by family\nrelationships (Brighouse & Swift 2009: 58). If those other\nactivities are to be justified, given the inequality they tend to\nperpetuate, it must be on the basis of other values, rather than this\nspecial familial intimacy.\n\nIn work that explores the societal factors which tend to result in\nunequal life chances between different persons the family is\nunderstandably foregrounded in discussion. This is because it is so\nformative as a developmental pathway which has a bearing on the\nprospects for acquiring the traits to be successful in social\ncompetition (for a good analysis of the mechanisms by which families\ntransmit advantages see Swift 2005). At bottom, however, the conflict\nis more general. For it seems that when persons exercise their\nassociational freedom in different ways this generates inequality. The\ntension between the family and Equality of Opportunity reflects a more\ngeneral tension between freedom\u2014to organize associations, to\nfavour some over others\u2014and equality (James Fishkin 1987). The\ntension manifests to different degrees and in different ways,\ndepending on the thickness of one\u2019s conception of Equality of\nOpportunity, but it seems present to at least some degree for all\nconceptions. For instance, the freedom to racially discriminate is\nconstrained by relatively thin, formal conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity. Meritocratic conceptions go further and constrain the\nfreedom to select on grounds other than the best qualified. More\nsubstantive conceptions of Equality of Opportunity go still further,\nand imply a tension between relevantly equal life chances and the\nfreedom to associate and promote the good of particular others, which\nmanifests different prospects between different persons.\n8. Radical/Luck Egalitarian Equality of Opportunity\n\nTo this point, the entry has largely focused on the \u201csocietal\nfactors\u201d which determine differential prospects for\nsuccess\u2014whether in the form of legal constraints on\nopportunities, discrimination in hiring, family background etc. The\nrange of conceptions of Equality of Opportunity canvassed to this\npoint tend mostly to take for granted that there are at least some\nnatural or non-societal factors that differentially affect\npersons\u2019 prospects for success without undermining Equality of\nOpportunity. Under FEO and associated conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity, for instance, it is acceptable for more talented people\nto enjoy greater chances of success in social competition than those\nwho are less talented, provided those chances were not themselves\ninfluenced in the wrong ways by social factors, such as class, family,\nand perhaps other associational sources of inequality.\n\nThis position is challenged by a still thicker conception of Equality\nof Opportunity, which might be termed Radical Equality of Opportunity\n(Segall 2013; Swift 2014) and is often called Luck Egalitarianism (LE)\n(also labelled \u201cSocialist Equality of Opportunity\u201d by\nCohen 2009). Roughly, under the LE conception of Equality of\nOpportunity no factors other than persons\u2019 own responsible\nchoices should affect differential prospects for success (for some\nprominent early defences see Cohen 1989; Temkin 1993). LE thereby goes\nbeyond FEO and not only condemns the influence of societal\ninequalities but also differences in natural talent and ability.\nSuppose, in a simplified case, that the highest paying jobs in a given\nsociety select according to intellectual aptitude and that, even when\nsociety is organized to a point where class, gender-based, racialized,\nfamilial etc. inequalities do not affect persons\u2019 different\nprospects for success, natural differences in persons\u2019\nintelligence determine who does or does not get the highest paying\njobs. Unequal prospects based upon those natural differences are\ninconsistent with true Equality of Opportunity under the LE view,\nbecause those with lower intelligence still have relevantly unequal\nopportunities to succeed as compared with others.\n\nFor some, the intuitive appeal of the LE view is that differential\nprospects for success should be relevantly under the control of each\nindividual. Echoing concerns first voiced by Rawls (1999: 87, 274,\n447) in his A Theory of Justice, what drives the Luck\nEgalitarian view is an objection to the distributive influence of\nfactors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view and, by\nthat token, unfair determinants of inequality. As such, only\ndifferences that are the result of individuals\u2019 own responsible\nchoices (and, it is claimed, therefore non-arbitrary) create\nfair inequalities in success. The range of factors that are\nunacceptable determinants of differential success under the LE is\ntherefore broader than under thinner conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity and excludes everything other than the results of\none\u2019s own choices. The details of the LE version of\nEquality of Opportunity will be further unpacked in what follows, but\nit is worth noting that the LE view tends to differ from FEO and other\nthinner conceptions of Equality of Opportunity in other respects as\nwell. Many of the conceptions of Equality of Opportunity surveyed\nabove have a relatively limited scope inasmuch as they are concerned\nwith opportunities for certain goods, often in the context of\ncompetition\u2014usually socially advantageous positions of certain\nkinds, like jobs, offices, places in education. LE tends to be\nunderstood more broadly\u2014as a view about overall fairness of\npersons\u2019 life prospects (Segall 2013). It is therefore concerned\nwith persons\u2019 opportunities in general with respect to whatever\nhas value in life\u2014what has become known as the\n\u201ccurrency\u201d of egalitarian concern. Broadly, the LE view\nholds that if someone is worse off than others, in terms of the\noverall \u201ccurrency\u201d of what matters, because of factors\nother than their own choices, then this is an unfair violation of\nEquality of Opportunity. The LE view is therefore consistent with\npersons facing unequal opportunities to obtain particular jobs or\nroles, provided persons enjoy equal overall prospects for\nsuccess, measured in whatever \u201ccurrency\u201d is favoured. The\nLE view also naturally tends towards a global application in a way\nthat distinguishes it from some of the other conceptions. Thinner\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity are frequently consistent with\ncriteria for success which exclude or disadvantage people on the basis\nof their nationality or geographical proximity. For instance,\nuniversity admissions may give priority to domestic applicants or even\nexclude foreign students from eligibility altogether. Certain jobs\nwill require candidates to travel for interview and relocate in the\nevent that they are successful, which will effectively exclude many\npeople from being able to compete for or accept the role. These\nconstraints will often pass as acceptable under conceptions of\nEquality of Opportunity surveyed in the above, but for the LE view\nthey are just another potential source of inequality which may stand\nin the way of realizing Equality of Opportunity (for more see\n section 10.2).\n\nLE lies near the thickest end of the continuum by which we can\norganize various conceptions of Equality of Opportunity. It holds that\nonly choice is an appropriate source of unequal prospects for success.\nA still thicker conception might deny that even choice should\ndetermine differences, and, instead, that no factors are\nacceptable determinants of unequal success (for a qualified version of\nsuch a view see Persson 2007). This would amount to Equality of\nOpportunity as equal outcome. Whether or not this is a justified\nposition, it might be strained to label this an Equal\nOpportunity view. Although LE occupies this place on the\ncontinuum of conceptions, where few factors are acceptable\ndeterminants of unequal prospects, it is misleading to think of LE as\ncommending equal chances for success. Equal chances of\nsuccess could be secured by simply having an equal lottery between\neveryone, the outcome of which results in some people faring very well\nand others faring very poorly. This would be straightforwardly\ninconsistent with LE, because the inequalities would not be a result\nof persons\u2019 own choices but, rather, the outcome of the lottery\n(for an example of this type see B. Barry 1988)\n\nAt the heart of LE is the distinction, first introduced by Ronald\nDworkin, between \u201coption luck\u201d and \u201cbrute\nluck\u201d. Option luck is\n\n\na matter of how deliberate and calculated gambles turn\nout\u2014whether someone gains or loses through accepting an isolated\nrisk he or she should have anticipated and might have declined.\n(Dworkin 1981: 293)\n\n\nBrute luck is defined in contradistinction to option luck as \u201ca\nmatter of how risks fall out that are not in that sense deliberate\ngambles\u201d (1981: 293). To illustrate the distinction, Dworkin\ncontinues:\n\n\nIf I buy a stock on the exchange that rise, then my option luck is\ngood. If I am hit by a falling meteorite whose course could not have\nbeen predicted, then my bad luck is brute. (1981: 293)\n\n\nRoughly, then, brute luck is a matter of things that happen to us\nwhich are relevantly independent of our choices, including both things\nthat happen to us over the course of our lives and things which we are\nborn with, whereas option luck is a matter of the reasonably\nforeseeable consequences for us of the choices we could reasonably\nhave avoided making. For LE, inequalities in brute luck are unfair and\nunjust, whereas inequalities in option luck are fair and just. Persons\ntherefore enjoy Equality of Opportunity in the relevant way when their\nbrute luck is equal with others and outcomes differ only as a result\nof differences in option luck\u2014namely the foreseeable outcomes of\ntheir own responsible choices. These essentials of the LE view have\nbeen further refined in various work, and the LE view has generated\nsubstantial debate (for some critical views see Anderson 1999;\nFleurbaey 2001; Scheffler 2003; 2005; Seligman 2007; for some\ndefences, see Arneson 2004; N. Barry 2006; Elford 2017; Knight 2005;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2016; Segall 2007; Stemplowska 2013; Voigt\n2007).\n\nBeyond matters of substantive debate between critics and defenders of\nLE, there are various complexities pertaining to the application of\nthe LE view. One is that persons\u2019 choices are generally, if not\nalways, made in the context of pre-existing unfair inequality. Suppose\nwe have two young people\u2014Sydney and Miriam\u2014who face a\nchoice between going to university to acquire new skills or working a\nlow paying job. The outcome of that choice will affect their prospects\nfor success in applications for high paying jobs in the future, and\nthe earnings from those jobs will far exceed what they are able to\nearn in a low paying job, even when they take up that low paid work\nimmediately. Sydney enjoys the good brute luck of having been born\ninto a rich family, which can help pay for her university fees and are\nnot themselves suffering from any financial hardship. Miriam, on the\nother hand, is from a poor family, which does not have the means to\nhelp her financially through university and struggles to pay domestic\nbills. Suppose Sydney opts to go to university, Miriam chooses to take\na low paying job, and as a result Sydney enjoys far better prospects\nin the competition for higher paying jobs. Although the differences in\nadvantage between Sydney and Miriam were partly the result of their\nrespective choices (and, to that extent, constitute option luck),\nthose choices were made in the context of considerably different\ncircumstances, which themselves represent unfair brute luck\ndifferences between the two (see Swift 2008: 364 for a note on how\ncritics of LE have sometimes overlooked this important qualifier).\nThis brief illustration indicates that the question of how far persons\nshould be held liable for option luck disadvantage (or entitled to\noption luck advantage) under conditions of unequal brute luck is a\nprofoundly difficult one. To add to the complexity, choices may not\nonly be influenced in the sense that they are taken in the context of\na certain range of options, which may differ, unfairly, for different\npersons, but persons\u2019 choices are themselves informed by\ndifferent dispositions, inclinations, and knowledge bases which\nthemselves depend partly on brute factors (Voorhoeve 2008). How much\neffort a person is inclined to make, which options they view as being\nviable or valuable, and how focused different persons become on tasks\nare all things which differ across persons and may be affected, to one\ndegree or another, by brute luck factors such as a person\u2019s\nsocial circumstances or their genetic predisposition to think in\ncertain ways. Again, the question of how to disentangle brute from\noption luck considerations looks immensely challenging.\n\nStill further, circumstances constrain which options are\nreasonable for people to pursue and to that extent might\naffect which choices qualify as \u201cdeliberate gambles\u201d in\nDworkin\u2019s sense. Suppose, in the example above, that Miriam has\na gravely ill mother who urgently needs expensive medication that she\ncan only get if Miriam immediately begins earning money in whichever\njob is available. It is plausible to think that going to university,\nrather than earning immediate money, is simply an unreasonable option\nfor Miriam, given what it would mean for her mother\u2019s health.\nFor this reason, one might argue that Miriam\u2019s resulting\ndisadvantage in the future employment stakes is more brute luck than\noption luck, even though it issued from a choice she made (for\nanalysis of a similar case, see de Shalit and Wolff 2011).\n\nThe most well-developed theory attempting to grapple with some of the\nchallenges of this sort is offered by John Roemer (1998; 2002; 2003).\nRoemer starts from the perspective that there are aspects of a\nperson\u2019s environment which are relevantly beyond that\nperson\u2019s control\u2014their\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d\u2014which can be distinguished from a\nperson\u2019s acts of autonomous volition\u2014their\n\u201ceffort\u201d. Roemer offers a proposal designed to help\npolicymakers determine the extent to which persons\u2019 outcomes are\na result of their circumstances or their efforts. That proposal\ninvolves sorting people into \u201ctypes\u201d based on how\nadvantageous their circumstances are. Distributive differences within\neach types reflect the differential \u201ceffort\u201d individuals\nmake. Equality of Opportunity requires equalizing between\ntypes (given that the difference between types is based on\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d\u2014factors outside of\nindividuals\u2019 control in the relevant sense) but not equalizing\nto eliminate differences in individuals\u2019 place within\ntypes (given that such differences are based on \u201ceffort\u201d).\nTo crudely illustrate, suppose we have an \u201cadvantaged\u201d\ntype (e.g., from a rich background) and a \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d\ntype (e.g., from a poor background), and within each type we have\n\u201clow effort\u201d and \u201chigh effort\u201d groups.\nRoemer\u2019s proposal involves equalizing between \u201chigh\neffort\u201d \u201cadvantaged\u201d and \u201chigh effort\u201d\n\u201cdisadvantaged\u201d individuals and also equalizing between\n\u201clow effort\u201d \u201cadvantaged\u201d and \u201clow\neffort\u201d \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d individuals but does not\nrequire further equalization between \u201chigh effort\u201d and\n\u201clow effort\u201d (for critiques see Hurley 2003: ch. 7;\nPhillips 2006: 20\u201323; Risse 2002).\n\nAlthough the LE conception of Equality of Opportunity has classically\ninvolved a view of option luck which appears to take for granted\nDworkin\u2019s original way of specifying the idea, this aspect of LE\nhas been scrutinized and developed in other work (Arneson 2004; Dekker\n2009; Elford 2018; Olsaretti 2009; Stemplowska 2009; Temkin 2011).\nSuppose Taylor chooses to stay at home and take care of her two\nchildren and that this leaves her worse off than she would have been\nby going out to work a full-time job. Assuming her choice was\nrelevantly unconstrained by those circumstances, her being worse off\nlooks like a matter of option luck. She made a choice and should be\nheld liable for its foreseeable consequences. LE views have often\nimplicitly supposed that it is the actual foreseeable consequences of\nchoice, or the consequences determined by the uncoerced responses from\nothers (for instance through the free market) which ought to determine\nthe consequences. But this might be questioned, as the basic\ndistinction between choices and circumstances at the root of LE is, in\nfact, consistent with a range of different views regarding the\nconsequences that persons should be held liable for/entitled to as a\nresult of their choices (Arneson 2004; Olsaretti 2009; Stemplowska\n2009). Perhaps care-giving choices should be rewarded more highly than\nthe market rewards them, and perhaps more highly than the other\nvocations. One could argue for this conclusion on various grounds\n(Olsaretti 2009: 182\u2013186). Perhaps it would be valuable to\nincentivize care-giving choices in a way that the market presently\nfails to do, or, for a different reason, because there is something\nbasically valuable about care-giving that means such choices are\ndeserving of reward (Temkin 2011). The point is that the Equality of\nOpportunity aspect of LE\u2014that persons should only fare better or\nworse than others as a result of their own choices\u2014is\nconsistent with a range of accounts concerning which benefits or\nliabilities ought to pertain to different choices.\n\nThe LE position has engendered a substantial amount of debate since\nits inception. Some lines of criticism point to its putatively\nimplausible implications for policymaking (Wolff 1998).However, the LE\nconception of Equality of Opportunity is an abstract, ideal conception\nwhich few, if any, of its advocates believe can be perfectly\ninstantiated (Arneson 2004: 13\u201314). Almost all those who hold an\nLE conception also tend to view it as one consideration of justice, to\nbe considered against other values. LE is a view concerning which\ninequalities are fair, even if unfair inequalities can be justified on\nother grounds. For instance, just as with FEO, LE fairness is in\ntension with the family inasmuch as the existence of the family\ngenerates brute luck inequalities between different children. It is\nconsistent with LE to hold that the family is an all-things-considered\njustified and valuable social mode of organization, whilst contending\nthat it standardly generates lamentable, unfair inequalities which we\nhave reason to mitigate.\n\nThere are different approaches to the inequalities that are\njustified under the LE view. LE is sometimes understood as a view\nwhich merely permits those inequalities, such that the\nelimination of those inequalities would not be bad. This LE conception\nof Equality of Opportunity would be consistent with redistributive\nmeasures to create equal outcomes, even if it would not\nmandate the elimination of option luck inequality (Segall\n2013). Alternatively, LE is sometimes understood as a view that\nrequires option luck inequalities, under which redistribution\nto eliminate option luck inequalities would be positively unfair\n(Cohen 2006: 444), even if that might be justified by other values.\nUnderstood in this way, LE shares with the meritocratic conception the\nnotion that some differences in prospects are required (the\nmore qualified should be advantaged in the competition),\nrather than merely permitted.\n9. Equality of Opportunity in Practice\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we saw that Equality of Opportunity can be understood in deontic or\ntelic terms. To recall, a deontic view of Equality of Opportunity is\nprimarily concerned with processes and decisions by which goods or\npositions are allocated, whereas a telic view is concerned with\npersons\u2019 enjoyment of equal opportunities as a matter of the\noverall state of affairs. Rawls\u2019 conception of FEO, for example,\nexplicitly combines both deontic and telic elements. It includes a\ndeontic requirement that offices and positions are to be distributed\naccording to the talents and willingness to work of those competing\nfor such positions (a meritocratic conception, or, as Rawls calls it,\nformal equality of opportunity), and it includes a telic principle\nthat persons ought to enjoy conditions which provide them with a fair\nchance to compete under those terms. LE is most naturally understood\nas a telic ideal, given that it evaluates how a person fares overall\nin comparison with others. It is possible to conceive of LE as a\ndeontic approach, however. Such an approach might specify allocative\nrequirements as being those which, if adhered to, would best\ninstantiate LE outcomes (Segall 2013). Even so, because LE is\nconcerned with persons\u2019 levels of overall advantage, any\nprinciples regulating the allocation of jobs and positions\nspecifically would either be insufficient to ensure LE Equality of\nOpportunity (because only jobs and positions, along with their\nattendant rewards, would be allocated), or they would need to take\ninto account wider sources of inequality.\n\nThis points us in the direction of a tension between telic and deontic\nconsiderations of Equality of Opportunity. To take Rawls\u2019 FEO as\nan illustration, we can see that the deontic element\u2014that\noffices and positions should be allocated according to meritocratic\nprinciples\u2014is separable from the telic element\u2014that\npersons should enjoy a fair chance to compete for social advantages.\nThese elements can come apart in different ways. A society could offer\nan equal chance for social advantage whilst violating the meritocratic\nprinciple. Suppose we have a society sharply divided along racialized\nlines but in a way that is equal between groups. Members of each\nracialized group are systematically discriminated against in hiring\npractices, but this balances out overall to give each citizen no\nlesser chance than others at competing for social advantage. Though\nfanciful, this illustrates how meritocratic considerations are\nimportantly distinct from, and only contingently related to, the issue\nof equal prospects for success overall. If we object to the racialized\ndiscrimination in a case like this, it suggests that our reasons for\nobjecting to it are not reducible to its liability to create\ninequalities in life chances (though we may not be objecting to it\nqua being discrimination; Segall 2013: 122). More\nrealistically, a society could instantiate meritocratic hiring\npractices without giving citizens a relevantly fair chance to\ncompete.\n\nThis second scenario provokes a further important question: namely,\nhow should deontic principles of Equality of Opportunity be applied in\ncontexts where telic Equality of Opportunity is imperfectly\ninstantiated? (For some reflections, see Joseph Fishkin 2014:\n56\u201365.) For instance, when society fails to ensure that persons\nhave a fair chance to compete for offices and positions, should hiring\npractices be adjusted in light of this, or not (Clayton 2012)? Suppose\nsociety manifests substantial class inequality which leads to\nsystematic differences between children from the prosperous class and\na poor class when it comes to their prospects of success in an\nemployment market that is regulated by meritocratic principles.\nChildren from the prosperous class have a much greater chance at\nobtaining the qualifications that will help secure them the advantaged\npositions. Suppose that those inequalities remain unaddressed by\ndirect means (for instance, the redistribution of wealth or education\nreforms).\n\nOne measure here would be to institute workplace adaptations to offset\ndisadvantages. That is, the available range of jobs could be\nreconstituted to ensure that advantaged positions depend less on the\ntalents that are cultivated by the prosperous social class and depend\non traits that are more evenly distributed across the social spectrum.\nThis would be consistent with adhering to principles of meritocratic\nEquality of Opportunity. Competitive hiring would still be decided by\na \u201cbest qualified\u201d criteria, but the range of relevant\nqualifications is simply changed to counter unfair inequalities in\naccess to the jobs. This measure might seem to have limited mileage,\nhowever (although for a related proposal in a sporting context, albeit\nin response to natural physiological differences, see English 1978).\nQuite apart from the fact that there might be reasons of efficiency\nfor organizing the workplace in certain ways rather than others, it is\nalso likely that the sources of social inequality in a society divided\nalong class lines would be responsive to changes in how the workplace\nis organized. If families in prosperous social classes are intent on\nfunnelling resources into their children\u2019s development to give\nthem the highest chances of success, their money will simply follow\nwhichever set of qualifications happen to do that.\n\nSometimes social advantage can allow people to gain qualifications\nwhich advantage them in competitive applications, even though those\nqualifications are not necessarily reflective of higher underlying\ntalent or ability. For a stark illustration of this, suppose that\nchildren of wealthy families can gain preferential access to\nprestigious and high calibre universities, and that, whilst there,\nthey are given lenient grading given the quality of their work. They\nreach the job market with exceptionally strong qualifications\u2014in\nthe sense that their educational portfolio is strong\u2014even though\nthis is not an accurate reflection of their underlying ability. In the\ncontext of advantages of this kind\u2014where social advantage buys\n\u201csurface qualifications\u201d, rather than enhancing\n\u201ctalent for the job\u201d\u2014it might be that some degree of\nunfair inequality in the competition for social advantage can be\noffset by ensuring that hiring and admissions practices consistently\nadmit those with the highest underlying ability (and effort), rather\nthan those who have the best \u201csurface qualifications\u201d.\n\nAn example may help to illustrate. Take a competitive application for\na degree course in mathematics. Suppose the criteria for being\n\u201cbest qualified\u201d for selection is the level of aptitude at\nmaths that the student will reach at the end of the course. The\nuniversity begins with a selection procedure that uses school grades\nas the sole appropriate indicator as to which candidate is best\nqualified in that sense. It might be that school grades are an\nimperfect indicator because less well-qualified students from more\nprosperous backgrounds are able to go to schools which successfully\nallow them to get high grades, even though this does not necessarily\nreflect their superior underlying ability in maths. One measure the\nuniversity might take to apply the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\ncriteria more accurately, then, might be to design a maths test which\nmore accurately discriminates between candidates based on underlying\nability than school grades do.\n\nThis would not necessarily be a compromise of the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity, but a requirement to apply it\nmore accurately. For instance, it could be that using \u201csurface\nqualifications\u201d is a useful proxy for identifying underlying\nability and is otherwise more efficient than implementing a more\naccurate, but also more costly, procedure. Offsetting this source of\nunequal chances may involve requiring institutions like firms and\nuniversities to invest additional resources in more accurate\nprocedures.\n\nAlternatively, it might be argued that to counter the lack of equal\nchances for members of socially disadvantaged groups, we should depart\nfrom meritocratic principles in hiring and admissions. For instance, a\nquota system might be used to require the inclusion of members of\ncertain disadvantaged groups, even though they may be less qualified\nthan non-members (Mason 2006: 19, 78 ; Mason 2001: 767).This is\nimportantly different from the above thought that measures might be\ntaken to discount the social advantages that some have when it comes\nto portraying themselves as ultimately best qualified. It is not\nsimply a matter of eliminating the social advantages some candidates\nhave concerning how successfully they can navigate the competitive\nprocedures (for instance, through better qualifications on paper) but\nit is a matter of saying that members of certain groups should get an\nadvantage over those who are in fact better qualified for the\nposition. In the case of applications to study maths at university,\nfor instance, it could be that children from more prosperous\nbackgrounds receive an education that not only gives them better\ngrades, but it also genuinely enhances their ability at maths. In this\ncase they are genuinely better qualified in the relevant sense, rather\nthan simply appearing to be, but their educational advantages could be\nsaid to give them an unfair chance in the competition to study maths\nat university. A quota system requiring that a greater proportion of\nstudents be admitted from less prosperous backgrounds would thereby\ninvolve compromising the deontic, meritocratic element of FEO in order\nto better satisfy the telic, fair chances element.\n\nA quota system of this kind might fall under the umbrella of measures\noften referred to as \u201caffirmative action\u201d or\n\u201cpositive discrimination\u201d, under which members of some\ngroups receive preferential treatment in the competition for roles and\npositions in a way that departs from meritocratic criteria (see the\nentry on\n affirmative action).\n This need not necessarily come in the form of a quota but could be\nsimply that membership of a certain group gives a candidate some\nadvantage in the competition, say, by simply giving some extra weight\nto those applications (Dworkin 2002b; Jacobs 2004: ch. 5). There are a\nrange of reasons offered for pursuing such measures. The measures\ncould be pursued to make the competition for scarce roles and\npositions fairer, as in the above example of admitting a greater\nproportion of children from less prosperous backgrounds to a maths\ncourse. They could be pursued as a matter of compensation for\nhistorical disadvantage (Nickel 1972; Thomson 1973; Valls 1999; for\ncriticism, see Anderson 2010: 137\u2013141; Lippert-Rasmussen 2020:\nch. 2; Sher 1975). The measures could be pursued to try to counteract\nwould-be unfair inequalities more generally, and not specifically to\nequalize chances for the members of the group who are being favoured.\nFor instance, it might be argued that by bolstering the numbers of\nindividuals from disadvantaged or marginalized groups in certain roles\nor jobs, this helps to facilitate access to those positions more\ngenerally, or to work against broader forms of injustice. Perhaps\nadmitting a larger proportion of children from underprivileged social\nbackgrounds into university helps encourage members of those groups to\nsee university as a realistic ambition when, because of past social\nconditions, it has not been considered attainable from their point of\nview (for discussion, see Thomson 1973: 367). Or perhaps increasing\nthe numbers of members of racialized minority groups in a workforce\nwill play some part in broader efforts to destigmatize racialized\ndifferences between groups. One thing worth noting about this\nrationale is that on a broad enough understanding of what makes\nsomeone \u201cbest qualified\u201d for a role it might be that such\nmeasures do not constitute a compromise of the meritocratic\nrequirement to select the best qualified after all (Anderson 2010: ch.\n7; Dworkin 2002a: 109). This might be the case if the relevant purpose\nof the role included these broader social effects.\n10. The Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nDifferent conceptions of Equality of Opportunity tend to be aligned\nwith different views about what might be called the\n\u201cscope\u201d of Equality of Opportunity. There are two\ndimensions of the scope of Equality of Opportunity which might be\nhelpfully distinguished. First, there is the matter of the range of\ngoods or positions that considerations of Equality of Opportunity are\nrelevant for. Narrower views of the scope of Equality of Opportunity\nrestrict its application to a limited range of offices and positions\nallocated through a competitive process. Wider views of the scope\nmight encompass a broader range of positions, goods, and\nrelationships. Call this the \u201cgoods scope\u201d of Equality of\nOpportunity. Second, there is the matter of the range of persons\ndeemed relevant for Equality of Opportunity. Suppose it is claimed\nthat French society offers Equality of Opportunity for holding\npolitical office, in the sense that there are no formal or informal\nconstraints of relevance which stand between any French citizen and\nseeking to hold such office. Still, it might be that only French\ncitizens are eligible to run for political office, so the scope of\napplication of Equality of Opportunity is limited to French citizens.\nCall this the \u201cperson scope\u201d of Equality of\nOpportunity.\n10.1 Goods Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nAs much of the preceding material indicates, it is familiar to think\nof the application of Equality in relation to socially advantageous\nroles and positions involving a competitive application process, the\nparadigm of such cases being jobs and competitive admissions processes\nin education. We could think about this in terms of persons enjoying\nEquality of Opportunity for particular roles (for example, for a given\nteaching job) or for a type of role (for example, for teaching jobs in\ngeneral), or for roles more generally (for example, jobs in general).\nEquality of Opportunity is also sometimes used to refer to\npersons\u2019 access to goods other than socially advantageous roles\nsuch as healthcare. One example of healthcare concerns that might be\nframed in terms of Equality of Opportunity is the matter of the\nso-called \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d in the UK. This refers to the\nfact that where one lives in the UK can sometimes determine how\nreadily available certain drugs and treatments are under the National\nHealth Service. If citizens in one county have access to drugs that\nare far less available through the service to citizens in another\ncounty, this might be framed as a failure of Equality of Opportunity\nfor healthcare. Similar claims might be made about the distribution of\nmany other goods like this, which do not take the form of competition\nfor roles and positions, but which involve the distribution of scarce\nresources according to a given eligibility criteria. When people claim\nthat there is a failure of Equality of Opportunity, they may not be\nclaiming that everyone should have equal amounts of the good, or even\nequal access to the good, but that the distribution ought to be\ndetermined by justified criteria of eligibility, rather than by other\nfactors which are deemed illegitimate. So, for instance, in the\npostcode lottery case, the claim might be that healthcare should be\ndistributed according to need, rather than according to the\narbitrary fact of which county one happens to live in. As such, even\nthough this application of the notion of Equality of Opportunity\npertains to goods other than competitive application practices, it\ninvolves the same idea\u2014that some factors are legitimate\ndeterminants of the distribution and others are not.\n\nWhilst Equality of Opportunity is very commonly understood to have a\nscope that encompasses socially advantageous positions that are part\nof formalized institutions\u2014such as jobs and other institutional\nroles, and places in education\u2014it might also be understood more\nbroadly, to encompass more informal \u201cpositions\u201d in society\nwhich have value or constitute social advantages, including, for\ninstance, to competitions for prizes and honours. Still more broadly,\nthe notion of Equality of Opportunity might be applied to much less\nformalized social relations that constitute, or lead to, advantages.\nIt might be applied, for instance, to one\u2019s opportunity to be a\nparent, or even one\u2019s opportunity for marriage. Again, the\nnotion of Equality of Opportunity here can be used in a way that ties\nit closely to the institutional or political measures that might be\ntaken to ensure fair access to certain goods or relationships, or it\nmight be applied more broadly to take account of the wider social\nexplanation for some persons enjoying a good where others do not. For\ninstance, some conceptions of Equality of Opportunity for parenthood\nor for marriage will hold that persons enjoy equal opportunities when\nthere are no state-instituted barriers against certain persons\nmarrying or, say, adopting children. Other conceptions will go\nfurther, and contend that Equality of Opportunity requires, for\ninstance, subsidizing IVF treatment and adoption processes, or\nwidening access to marriage procedures. And, indeed, there will be\nsome conceptions which go still further and hold that social norms and\nthe behaviour of one\u2019s fellow citizens can themselves prove\nbarriers to Equality of Opportunity. To illustrate, suppose we can\nclearly identify a level of bias against certain members of a\nparticular racialized group in dating apps, leading to those\npersons\u2019 faring less well at matching with others. It might be\nargued that this reflects a lack of Equality of Opportunity for such\nindividuals to form romantic relationships.\n10.2 Person Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nThis dimension of the scope of Equality of Opportunity has thus far\nbeen framed as a matter of the range of persons to whom the conception\nof Equality of Opportunity is to be applied. However, it is worth\nnoting that we can think about this issue in slightly different\nterms\u2014understanding the identity or status of the person as one\nof the factors which should or should not affect a distribution. The\nexample of Equality of Opportunity for political office in France can\nbe understood as having a scope that is limited to French citizens,\nor, alternatively, it could be understood to have a global scope but\nwhere citizenship is a relevant factor which determines who should or\nshould not be able to run for office. Though it is true on a technical\nlevel that all such scope claims can be translated into the factors\nwhich should or should not affect success in a competition, it seems\nclearer to conceive of this in terms of the scope of application\nacross persons, given that it is a persons\u2019 identity\nwhich disbars them from consideration altogether.\n\nFurthermore, particularly when we think about telic ways of thinking\nabout Equality of Opportunity in terms of persons enjoying fair\nprospects for success, it seems more sensible to think of conceptions\nof Equality of Opportunity in terms of being scope limited across\npersons, rather than adding a person\u2019s identity to the range of\nfactors which legitimately affect the prospects for success. Consider,\nfor instance, the claim under Rawls\u2019 FEO that social class\nshould not affect persons\u2019 prospects for securing socially\nadvantageous positions. It seems clear that children in the poorest\nsocial class in, say, Afghanistan will have worse prospects for\nsuccess than the most prosperous social class in, say, Norway. And yet\nRawls does not class it as a failure of Equality of Opportunity if\nAfghan children fare worse in the competition for offices and\npositions in Norway than do Norwegian children. Rather than saying\nthat FEO has global scope but also includes the condition that\nprospects can legitimately vary according to nationality, it\nseems more sensible to say that Rawls\u2019 conception of FEO is\nlimited in scope to those persons within a particular social\nscheme. \n\nWhether Equality of Opportunity has a scope that traverses national\nborders is closely related to wider questions concerning the scope of\njustice (see the entries on\n global justice\n and\n international distributive justice)\n and is a debated matter (for defences of such a position, see Caney\n2000a,b; B. Barry 1991; Moellendorf 2002; Pogge 1994; for accounts\ncritical of coherent global scheme of Equality of Opportunity, see\nBoxill 1987; Miller 2005). There is no strict relationship between how\nformal or substantive a conception of Equality of Opportunity is and\nhow wide its person scope is. LE conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity tend to be associated with a global person scope, although\nLE is technically consistent with a more limited person scope. LE\ntilts in favour of a global person scope because conceptions of LE\ngenerally see all factors other than responsible\nchoice\u2014including citizenship and nationality\u2014as morally\narbitrary, and hence improper determinants of how well a person fares\nin comparison with others (Caney 2005: 123).\n11. Concluding remarks\n\nThe term Equality of Opportunity is really used to refer to several\ndistinct ideas, thematically unified by some form of commitment to\npermitting differential access to goods or positions based on certain\nfactors and condemning it in relation to others. The thinness of that\nbasis of unity helps to illuminate the apparent widespread (although\nnot by any means universal) agreement over the value of Equality of\nOpportunity. It also serves to expose the sense in which that degree\nof agreement is ultimately illusory, and that surface agreement\nconcerning the value of Equality of Opportunity can often conceal\nunderlying substantive disagreement over the respects in which\nindividuals ought to be made equal with one another.\n",
