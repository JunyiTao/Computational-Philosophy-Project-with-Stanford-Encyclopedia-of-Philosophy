It includes three texts: \u2018Ueber eine\nWeissagung Lichtenbergs\u2019, originally published in 1802; the\n\u2018Claudius-Rezension\u2019, which was scheduled to appear in\n1798; and a final long essay on Idealism and Realism. The whole\nproject was described by Jacobi himself as being devoted to revelation\n(Livieri, 2023). By contrast with the immediate interpretation of this\nreference to revelation, the \u2018Preface\u2019 to the third volume\nof the Complete Works (1816) states in clear terms that the \u2018Von\nden g\u00fcttlichen Dingen\u2019 manifests a thematic agreement with\nboth the \u2018Jacobi an Fichte\u2019 (1799) and \u2018Ueber das\nUnternehmen\u2019 (1802). Hence, the idea of revelation takes shape\nwithin a conceptual background that neither refers to Christian\ntheology nor explicitly addresses any topics of the philosophy of\nreligion. Instead, Jacobi uses the term (Offenbarung) as it\nis used in plain German, which emphasizes the immediate apprehension\nof real being. This linguistic strategy may appear hazardous at first\nglance, but it fits well with Jacobi\u2019s critical stance in\nopposition to Kant\u2019s philosophy and its heirs: the term\nrevelation announces the necessary duality in epistemology (an I in\nfront of a Thou) and demands that immediacy be a key factor.Moreover,\nOffenbarung must be considered the major concept that\nintroduces us to Jacobi\u2019s epistemology in general, in fact it\nmust prove instrumental to the subtle connection that he establishes\nbetween two realms of being: the finite and the divine (Koch, 2019:\nXVIIIff).\n\nTo present the content schematically, it is necessary to begin with\nthe distinction that Jacobi draws between \u2018integral\nexternalists\u2019 and \u2018integral internalists\u2019 in matters\nof religion. The first support the authority of externality in the\nform of historical instances of the divine (the historical Jesus,\ndivine messengers, etc.), while the second privilege the inner voice\nof the divine in the form of a conscience that is ingrained in the\nrational nature of the human. Jacobi finds instances of truth in both\napproaches, but a proper way to settle the issue would be to find a\nthird, more productive, stance, that would not be a simple mediation\nbetween the two parties. Jacobi finds such a solution in his theism,\naccording to which God is clearly not the God of the Christian Bible,\nnotwithstanding the many references to the Old and New Testament and\nJacobi\u2019s explicit profession of faith, but a God that results\nfrom an anthropomorphism that mirrors reciprocal theomorphism:\n\u2018I am who I am. This sovereign proclamation grounds everything.\nIts echo in the human soul is the revelation of God in it: \u2018made\nin His image, in the likeness of who is\u2019. By creating the human\nbeing God theomorphized it (theomorphisirt); necessarily then\nthe human being anthropomorphizes (anthropomorphisirt). What\nmakes the human being a human being, i.e., an image of God, is\nreason\u2019 (JWA 3: 112. See Goretzki, 2021).\n\nAs it is stated in the essay \u2018On Critique\u2019s Attempt to\nReduce Reason to the Understanding\u2019, reason functions as the\nreal definition of humanity, thanks to which the divine things are\nrevealed, namely, God, freedom, virtue, and the immortality of the\nsoul. This mediation between the divine and finite things is the basic\noperation executed by reason itself, which is embodied in the human\nbeing and can thus be defined as a concrete free agent. In fact, as\nmoral agents make existence conceivable, the same agent concurrently\nconnects the finite world with the supramundane one by way of\nconnecting the finite world with its divine origin. The practical\ndimension of the agent is thus key for connecting the\nGod\u2013creator with existence in any fashion. Only God gives\nnature, the finite world, a \u2018face\u2018, as much as our reason\ngives our knowledge of nature its real footing in existence. In this\nsense, one may claim that reason perceives what God creates: the order\nof reality, intended in both the moral and ontological senses.\n\nA re\u2013evaluation of Kant\u2019s philosophy is therefore given in\nthis text, performed in view of the authority that practical reason\nmust exercise upon every aspect of our rationality, whether\nepistemological or practical. Jacobi recognizes Kant\u2019s merit,\nhis \u2018spirit\u2019, in the fact that Kant did assume that there\nis in human reason \u2014 as the law of its truth immune to all error\n\u2014 an immediate cognition of both reality in general and of its\nsupreme ground, of a nature below that cognition and of a God above it\n(JWA 3: 85). Kant needed to assume an immediate knowledge before\nscience to arise, and nevertheless he also \u2018considered it\nnecessary to transform this purely revealed and independent knowledge\ninto one dependent on demonstrating, and the immediately known into\none mediated. He wanted to build the understanding under reason as\nfoundation and then elevate reason above it. The supremacy of reason,\nits eminent dignity as the unique and sole universal ground and source\nof all principles, thus came to the fore only afterwards, and then\nonly validated on condition that it reach a settlement with the\nunderstanding. But such a settlement could not be reached. Based as it\nwould have been, not on reserving space reciprocally, but on\nreciprocal surrender \u2014 on one side simply denying, the other\nsimply affirming \u2014 it amounted to the neutralization and\ndispossession of [any] supremacy. And since the understanding, with\nits veto\u2013power to which it in advance claimed to be entitled,\nsimply stood up against the unreasonable demands of reason, there was\nno way out. Practical reason could not make good on behalf of faith,\noutside the domain of science and cognition, what the theoretical (the\nunderstanding) had destroyed on behalf of science and cognition. The\ndoctrines of God, immortality, and freedom had to be straight out\nabandoned. There remained only a doctrine of nature, a philosophy of\nnature\u2019 (JWA 3: 88).\n\nIn the end, Kant, against his own spirit, does not credit reason with\nits proper place and function. However, Jacobi does not contend that\nreason must be given free rein, but instead, reason must always\ncommunicate with the understanding, although their functions and\nrelative hierarchy must be maintained and made productive (JWA 3: 79).\nIf their distinctions in rank and their synergy are not kept, then\neither reason would lose itself in empty dreams or Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy of nature would establish itself as the only coherent\noutcome of an overpowering understanding. In the last section of the\ntext, Jacobi shows that, contrary to what one may suppose,\nSchelling\u2019s doctrine of the Unitotality does not\nrepresent the true form of a scientific approach to reality, for real\nscience respects Jacobi\u2019s theism: true science moves only within\nthe horizon of the conditioned. Instead, Schelling\u2019s doctrine\ndisplays the paramount misstep of equating freedom with necessity, the\nscience of nature with the science of God, the doctrine of the\nconditioned with knowledge of the unconditioned. In short,\nSchelling\u2019s doctrine would make of the ground (in the form of\nnature) the origin and reality of all being. In Jacobi\u2019s eyes,\nhis own theism proves its superiority against Schelling\u2019s\nnaturalism, as theism does not ban necessity, whereas\nSchelling\u2019s naturalism bans real freedom (JWA 3: 110):\nJacobi\u2019s theism rejects naturalism\u2019s veto, while it allows\nthe science of the understanding to produce knowledge of the\nconditioned and, at the same time, introduces a different logos for\nthe unconditioned.\n",
