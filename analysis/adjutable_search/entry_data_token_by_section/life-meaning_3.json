    "main_text": "Naturalism || . Rejecting God and a Soul\n4. Nihilism\n\nThe previous two sections addressed theoretical accounts of what would\nconfer meaning on a human person\u2019s life. Although these theories\ndo not imply that some people\u2019s lives are in fact meaningful,\nthat has been the presumption of a very large majority of those who\nhave advanced them. Much of the procedure has been to suppose that\nmany lives have had meaning in them and then to consider in virtue of\nwhat they have or otherwise could. However, there are nihilist (or\npessimist) perspectives that question this supposition. According to\nnihilism (pessimism), what would make a life meaningful in principle\ncannot obtain for any of us.\n\nOne straightforward rationale for nihilism is the combination of\nextreme supernaturalism about what makes life meaningful and atheism\nabout whether a spiritual realm exists. If you believe that God or a\nsoul is necessary for meaning in life, and if you believe that neither\nis real, then you are committed to nihilism, to the denial that life\ncan have any meaning. Athough this rationale for nihilism was\nprominent in the modern era (and was more or less Camus\u2019\nposition), it has been on the wane in analytic philosophical circles,\nas extreme supernaturalism has been eclipsed by the moderate\nvariety.\n\nThe most common rationales for nihilism these days do not appeal to\nsupernaturalism, or at least not explicitly. One cluster of ideas\nappeals to what meta-ethicists call \u201cerror theory,\u201d the\nview that evaluative claims (in this case about meaning in life, or\nabout morality qua necessary for meaning) characteristically\nposit objectively real or universally justified values, but that such\nvalues do not exist. According to one version, value judgments often\nanalytically include a claim to objectivity but there is no reason to\nthink that objective values exist, as they \u201cwould be entities or\nqualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from\nanything else in the universe\u201d (Mackie 1977/1990, 38). According\nto a second version, life would be meaningless if there were no set of\nmoral standards that could be fully justified to all rational\nenquirers, but it so happens that such standards cannot exist for\npersons who can always reasonably question a given claim (Murphy 1982,\n12\u201317). According to a third, we hold certain beliefs about the\nobjectivity and universality of morality and related values such as\nmeaning because they were evolutionarily advantageous to our\nancestors, not because they are true. Humans have been \u201cdeceived\nby their genes into thinking that there is a distinterested, objective\nmorality binding upon them, which all should obey\u201d (Ruse and\nWilson 1986, 179; cf. Street 2015). One must draw on the intricate\nwork in meta-ethics that has been underway for the past several\ndecades in order to appraise these arguments.\n\nIn contrast to error-theoretic arguments for nihilism, there are\nrationales for it accepting that objective values exist but denying\nthat our lives can ever exhibit or promote them so as to obtain\nmeaning. One version of this approach maintains that, for our lives to\nmatter, we must be in a position to add objective value to the world,\nwhich we are not since the objective value of the world is already\ninfinite (Smith 2003). The key premises for this view are that every\nbit of space-time (or at least the stars in the physical universe)\nhave some positive value, that these values can be added up, and that\nspace is infinite. If the physical world at present contains an\ninfinite degree of value, nothing we do can make a difference in terms\nof meaning, for infinity plus any amount of value remains infinity.\nOne way to question this argument, beyond doubting the value of\nspace-time or stars, is to suggest that, even if one cannot add to the\nvalue of the universe, meaning plausibly comes from being the\nsource of certain values.\n\nA second rationale for nihilism that accepts the existence of\nobjective value is David Benatar\u2019s (2006, 18\u201359)\nintriguing \u201casymmetry argument\u201d for anti-natalism, the\nview that it is immoral to bring new people into existence because\ndoing so would always be on balance bad for them. For Benatar, the\nbads of existing (e.g., pains) are real disadvantages relative to not\nexisting, while the goods of existing (pleasures) are not real\nadvantages relative to not existing, since there is in the latter\nstate no one to be deprived of them. If indeed the state of not\nexisting is no worse than that of experiencing the benefits of\nexistence, then, since existing invariably brings harm in its wake, it\nfollows that existing is always worse compared to not existing.\nAlthough this argument is illustrated with experiential goods and\nbads, it seems generalizable to non-experiential ones, including\nmeaning in life and anti-matter. The literature on this argument has\nbecome large (for a recent collection, see Hauskeller and Hallich\n2022).\n\nBenatar (2006, 60\u201392, 2017, 35\u201363) has advanced an\nadditional argument for nihilism, one that appeals to Thomas\nNagel\u2019s (1986, 208\u201332) widely discussed analysis of the\nextremely external standpoint that human persons can take on their\nlives. There exists, to use Henry Sidgwick\u2019s influential phrase,\nthe \u201cpoint of view of the universe,\u201d that is, the\nstandpoint that considers a human being\u2019s life in relation to\nall times and all places. When one takes up this most external\nstandpoint and views one\u2019s puny impact on the world, little of\none\u2019s life appears to matter. What one does in a certain society\non Earth over 75 years or so just does not amount to much, when\nconsidering the billions of temporal years and billions of light-years\nthat make up space-time. Although this reasoning grants limited kinds\nof meaning to human beings, from a personal, social, or human\nperspective, Benatar both denies that the greatest sort of\nmeaning\u2013\u2013a cosmic one\u2013\u2013is available to them\nand contends that this makes their lives bad, hence the\n\u201cnihilist\u201d tag. Some have objected that our lives could in\nfact have a cosmic significance, say, if they played a role in\nGod\u2019s plan (Quinn 2000, 65\u201366; Swinburne 2016, 154), were\nthe sole ones with a dignity in the universe (Kahane 2014), or engaged\nin valuable activities that could be appreciated by anyone anywhere\nanytime (Wolf 2016, 261\u201362). Others naturally maintain that\ncosmic significance is irrelevant to appraising a human life, with\nsome denying that it would be a genuine source of meaning (Landau\n2017, 93\u201399), and others accepting that it would be but\nmaintaining that the absence of this good would not count as a bad or\nmerit regret (discussed in Benatar 2017, 56\u201362; Williams 2020,\n108\u201311).\n\nFinally, a distinguishable source of nihilism concerns the\nontological, as distinct from axiological, preconditions for meaning\nin life. Perhaps most radically, there are those who deny that we have\nselves. Do we indeed lack selves, and, if we do, is a meaningful life\nimpossible for us (see essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018; Le Bihan\n2019)? Somewhat less radically, there are those who grant that we have\nselves, but deny that they are in charge in the relevant way. That is,\nsome have argued that we lack self-governance or free will of the sort\nthat is essential for meaning in life, at least if determinism is true\n(Pisciotta 2013; essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018). Non-quantum\nevents, including human decisions, appear to be necessited by a prior\nstate of the world, such that none could have been otherwise, and many\nof our decisions are a product of unconscious neurological mechanisms\n(while quantum events are of course utterly beyond our control). If\nnone of our conscious choices could have been avoided and all were\nultimately necessited by something external to them, perhaps they are\ninsufficient to merit pride or admiration or to constitute narrative\nauthorship of a life. In reply, some maintain that a compatibilism\nbetween determinism and moral responsibility applies with comparable\nforce to meaning in life (e.g., Arpaly 2006; Fischer 2009,\n145\u201377), while others contend that incompatibilism is true of\nmoral responsibility but not of meaning (Pereboom 2014).\n",
