In addition to its portrayal of\nthe ens realissimum, one finds within it Kant\u2019s\nobjections to the Ontological, Cosmological and Physico-theological\n(Design) arguments. It is thus the text most central to the negative\nelements of Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion and is integral to the\nwidely held view that Kant is hostile to religion.\n3.1.1 The Ens Realissimum\n\nKant maintains that underlying all the traditional proofs for\nGod\u2019s existence is the concept of the ens realissimum,\nthe most real being. Reason comes to the idea of this being through\nthe principle that every individuated object is subject to the\n\u201cprinciple of complete determination\u201d. While the\ngenerality of concepts allows them to be less than fully determined\n(e.g., our concept of a horse extends over horses that are different\ncolors, heights, etc.), individuated objects must be completely\ndetermined (e.g., an individual horse must have specific colors, a\nspecific height, etc.).\n\nHence, where the particular determinations of actual objects are\ndiscovered through experience, our concepts, which in themselves are\nnot objects of experience, remain partly indeterminate. Nevertheless,\nreason can construct for itself what is on the one hand still an\nabstraction but yet also an individuated entity. Kant refers to such\nentities as \u201cideals\u201d and in most instances they are used\nby us regulatively as archetypes for reflection. For example, when\nconsidering whether or not to get a pet, one might envision an ideal\npet, a pet with the optimal set of desirable attributes. Such an\narchetype for thought, however, is still not completely determined,\nfor the ideal can still be neutral between various attributes that are\nnot regarded as relevant to one\u2019s interests (for example, one\nmay not consider any specific nostril width salient to one\u2019s\nchoice of pet).\n\nBy contrast, the ens realissimum is the concept of an\nindividual object that is completely determined, and is such through\nreason alone. In the case of most ideals, their determinations are the\nresult of various empirical concepts as well as various subjective\ninterests (such as what one believes a pet would bring to one\u2019s\ndaily life). However, in the ens realissimum, all its\ndeterminations are set solely through reason\u2019s formal\napplication of the principle of complete determination, aggregating\ntogether all possible predicates and selecting from these predicates\nall those which have a fully positive reality (no negative predicates,\nno derivative predicates). That is, following the concept of\n\u201cthe most real being\u201d, reason brings together all possible\npredicates and eliminates those which involve some limitation or\ndeficiency.\n\nIn doing this, the faculty does not violate any of the standards Kant\nsets out within Transcendental Idealism, for reason is merely applying\nthe formal principle of complete determination to all possible\npredicates and constructing an idea (or more precisely, an ideal)\nthereby. This construction can then be entertained by the intellect,\nor perhaps, used as a regulative principle, as one does with other\nless grand ideals. Transcendental error comes in, however, if reason\nalso then tenders the ens realissimum as not merely a formal\nconstruct but as the metaphysical ground of all that is: since it (in\nprinciple) contains all determinations, and these determinations are\nof actual entities, a \u201ctranscendental subreption\u201d may\noccur that transforms the ens realissimum from just an\nintellectual construct into a metaphysical reality as the sum total of\nall actuality.\n\nAs with other transcendental errors, we can subreptively conflate a\nsubjective principle generated by our intellects and of only\nregulative use to one that is objective, a real being not constructed\nin thought, but discovered through thought. Such, we may say, is the\nsource of error in Spinoza\u2019s use of substance and in other\nmonistic metaphysics. Our construction of the ens realissimum\nhas the appearance of an actual unity since it is the concept of the\nsum total of all positive predicates. This appearance then casts an\nillusion unrecognized by the metaphysicians, leading them into the\nsubreptive error.\n3.1.2 Kant\u2019s critique of the traditional arguments for God\u2019s existence\n3.1.2.1 Ontological argument\n\nAccording to the Ontological Argument, it is self-evident from the\nidea of the most real being that that being exists. Whatever it is\nthat is this most real being, it must include all predicates that\ncontribute to its greatness or reality; and given that actual\nexistence is (allegedly) one such predicate, whatever it is that is\nthe most real being is therefore a being who by definition must exist.\nHence, if one were to compare two beings, both equally great in all\nrespects except that one exists and one does not, the one that does\nnot exist, by virtue of its non-existence, is lacking a predicate that\ncontributes to the greatness of the other. The correct conception of\nthat than which nothing greater can be conceived must,\ntherefore, include existence.\n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason contains four distinct objections\nto the Ontological Argument. The first two of these follow what may be\nthought of as the standard assumption by the proponents of this\nargument that \u201cGod exists\u201d is to be treated as an analytic\njudgment (A594/B622\u2013A597/B625). Though rarely mentioned in the\nliterature, these arguments are salient to the common objection that\nKant\u2019s critique of the Ontological Argument doesn\u2019t impact\nthe Anselmian version (Plantinga 1966, Forgie 1975).\n\nThe second two objections arise as a result of the defeat of the\nanalytic rendering, and turn to a reading of \u201cGod exists\u201d\nas synthetic (A597/B625\u2013A602/B630). By far, the most famous of\nthese objections is that existence is not a predicate. What, however,\nKant means by \u201cpredicate\u201d requires some examination.\n\nOf key significance here is Kant\u2019s distinction between\n\u201clogical\u201d versus \u201creal\u201d predicates. The former\nis best understood as a syntactic notion: the second term, along with\nthe subject term, of a complete and well-formed proposition. A real\npredicate, by contrast, is distinguished by its semantic function. As\nKant describes it, a real predicate \u201cgoes beyond the concept of\nthe subject and enlarges it\u201d (A598/B626). Hence, logical and\nreal predicates involve two different orders of analysis, one\nsyntactic, one semantic. They are neither mutually exclusive (Abaci\n2008), nor exhaustive (Pasternack 2018). They instead distinguish\nbetween two different roles that one and the same term can have.\n\nTo help Kant make his case that existence is not a real predicate,\ni.e., a predicate that \u201cenlarges\u201d the subject term, he\nappeals to the distinction between an actual and non-actual unit of\ncurrency, say one hundred dollars. Between the two, there is no\ndifference in the concepts of each: existence adds nothing to the\nconcept of one hundred dollars. So, when one claims that \u201cone\nhundred dollars exist\u201d, one is not picking out one of its\npredicates, part of the nature of a hundred dollars, but rather one is\njust \u201cpositing\u201d (A598/B626) its existence. Likewise, to\nclaim that \u201cGod exists\u201d is merely to posit God\u2019s\nexistence. It is not a statement which attributes the property of\nexistence to the subject term, God.\n\nUnderlying this analysis is Kant\u2019s contention that existence\ndoes not add anything to the subject concept; for it if did, then, he\ncontends, a hundred dollars actualized would be different from it as\nmerely possible: \u201cmy concept would not express the entire object\nand thus would not be the suitable concept for it\u201d (A599/B627).\nThat is, the hundred dollars as possible would not be the same as what\nis actualized in the actual hundred dollars.\n\nThere are, unsurprisingly, many different interpretations as to what\nKant means when he claims that existence does not\n\u201cenlarge\u201d or add to the subject term. Let us here consider\nthree.\n\nThe first comes from James Van Cleve\u2019s Problems from\nKant (1999), where he offers an analysis of real predication that\nrenders conceptual enlargement (i.e., a predicate that \u201cgoes\nbeyond\u201d its subject) in terms of logical non-entailment. He\nwrites:\n\n\nA predicate P enlarges a concept \\(C =_{df} \\Diamond\n\\exists x (Cx \\amp {\\sim}Px)\\).\n\n\nIf C = triangle and P = red, P would be,\nfollowing this definition, a real predicate, since it is possible that\nthere exists an x which is a triangle and is not red. By\ncontrast, if P = three-sidedness, then we do not, by this\ndefinition, have a real predicate of C, since there are no\ntriangles that are not three-sided. In other words, where C =\ntriangle and P = three-sidedness, since \\(\\forall x (Cx \\supset\nPx)\\), P fails to meet the test for conceptual enlargement of\nC. Likewise, existence will fail to meet the definition above\nsince for any concept C, \\(\\exists x (Cx \\supset\n\\langle\\textrm{exists}\\rangle x)\\). That is, if there exists some\nx such that x is a C, then x exists.\nHence, Van Cleve treats existence as not an enlarging concept since,\nper his analysis, he is \u201cletting the existential quantifier\nexpress existence\u201d (Van Cleve 1999: 188).\n\nNick Stang follows Van Cleve in \u201cletting the existential\nquantifier express existence\u201d and further argues that Kant\nsubscribes to an \u201cactualism\u201d whereby there are no\nnon-existing objects (i.e., if unicorns do not exist,\n\u201cunicorn\u201d does not name an object, but rather references a\nstring of predicates). As such, Stang asserts that since\n\u201cexists applies to every object, it does not\ndistinguish some objects from other objects\u201d (Stang 2015: 599).\nNotice, however, that Stang\u2019s rationale for why existence is not\na predicate is that it is actually a \u201cpredicate that applies to\nevery object there is\u201d. That is, Stang interprets existence as\nan internal mark of our concept of objecthood itself (Stang 2015:\n599).\n\nA third recent analysis can be found in R. Lanier Anderson\u2019s\nThe Poverty of Conceptual Thought (2015). Anderson seeks to\nshow that philosophers need to follow Kant\u2019s treatment of\nexistence in order to preserve our contemporary use of modal terms.\nFor if our modal terms (existence, possibility, necessity) were\npredicates, then a change in modal terms would demand a change in the\ncontents of our concepts of objects.\n\nAccordingly, Anderson\u2019s argument is intended to reflect\nKant\u2019s conclusion from his hundred dollars example: \u201cwhat\nwould exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my\nconcept\u201d (A600/B628). More specifically, Anderson argues that if\nour modal terms were predicates, then the non-actual possible would\nhave as one of its marks, non-actual possibility; whereas the actual\nwould have existence as one of its marks. As a result, if one were to\nconsider the actualization of some non-actual possible P,\nP-actualized would no longer be the same P as\nthe P of P-non-actual possible. As Anderson\nexplains:\n\n\nthe supposition that <existence> would determine the concept of\na thing is incompatible with its logical function of a modal category,\nwhich is to separate the actual objects from the merely possible ones\nwithout altering the contents of the things\u2019 concepts.\n(Anderson 2015: 322)\n\n3.1.2.2 Cosmological argument\n\nKant further contends that the Cosmological Argument is parasitic on\nthe Ontological. He demonstrates this by taking Leibniz\u2019s Modal\nArgument as emblematic of all other Cosmological Arguments and then\ncontends that a being posited as necessary in order to explain the\ncontingency of creation has built into it the same error as discussed\nabove. According to Leibniz\u2019s Modal Argument, the existence of a\ncontingent reality can only be ultimately explained through a cause\nwhose existence is in itself necessary. However, something whose\nexistence is in itself necessary is something whose existence cannot\ndepend upon anything else but itself, its own nature. This returns us\nto the Ontological Argument, or at least the objectionable idea at its\nheart, for the necessary being that the Cosmological Argument proposes\nis also the idea of a being whose essence involves existence. So, as\nbefore, since existence is not a predicate, Kant rejects the coherence\nof the idea of a being whose existence depends upon nothing but its\nown nature.\n3.1.2.3 Physico-theological argument\n\nKant\u2019s assessment of the Physico-Theological (Design) Argument\nis substantially different from his treatment of the other two classic\nproofs. While he still contends that it, like the Cosmological\nargument, remains ultimately grounded upon the Ontological\nArgument\u2019s assumption that existence is a predicate, this\nobjection does not fully undo the force of the Physico-Theological\nArgument. Kant in fact expresses sympathy for this argument, writing,\nfor instance, that it \u201calways deserves to be mentioned with\nrespect\u201d (A623/B651) and that it is \u201cthe oldest, the\nclearest, and the most accordant with the common reason of\nmankind\u201d (A623/B651). He further claims that the argument\nsucceeds in at least establishing \u201can\narchitect of the world\u201d and a cause\n\u201cproportioned\u201d to the order of nature. So, up to this\npoint in the argument, he writes, \u201cwe have nothing to bring\nagainst the rationality and utility of this procedure, but have rather\nto commend it further\u201d (A624/B652). What Kant cannot accept,\nhowever, is its advance from a \u201cWise Author of Nature\u201d to\nan infinite creator. When it moves from architect to creator, it\nproposes an \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201csupreme\u201d cause,\nand in so doing, it calls for a being whose existence depends upon\nnothing but itself. This returns us to the Cosmological/Modal\nargument, and thus to its dependency on the Ontological. Despite,\nhowever, the failure of the argument to establish the existence of an\ninfinite creator, Kant does not abandon the relevance, particularly\nthe regulative relevance of the idea of a \u201cWise Author of\nNature\u201d for the natural sciences, a point he repeats in both the\nAppendix to the Transcendental Dialectic and in the Canon of Pure\nReason.\n3.2 Kant on Deism and Theism\n\nKant\u2019s distinction between Deism and Theism is intertwined with\nhis distinction between Transcendental Theology and Natural Theology\n(A631/B659\u2013A632/B660). The meaning of these terms, however, are\nnot what some have assumed (e.g., Wood 1991).\n\nIn his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion,\nKant defines \u201cTranscendental Theology\u201d as the\n\u201crecognition [Kenntniss] of God by means of concepts of\npure reason\u201d (AK 28:596 [1821]). These concepts are not,\nhowever, the pure concepts of the understanding, but rather what he\ncalls the four \u201cclasses of concepts\u201d (B110): namely,\nquantity, quality, relation and modality. More precisely, Kant sees\nTranscendental Theology as a consequence of reason\u2019s quest for\nthe unconditioned condition, with its concepts of God corresponding to\nthe unconditioned for each of the \u201cclasses of concepts\u201d,\nnamely: ens summum (quality), ens entium (quantity),\nens originarium (modality), and ens realissimum\n(relation).\n\nAs Transcendental Theology employs no \u201cinformation\u201d about\nthe conditioned (i.e., the created world), it is without the resources\nneeded to develop a concept of God \u201cin concreto\u201d\n(AK 28:1020 [1817]). Absent the \u201cmaterials for the concept of\nGod from empirical principles and empirical information\u201d (AK\n28:1020 [1817]), Transcendental Theology can do no more than attribute\nto God \u201cwhat is true of him as a thing in general\u201d (AK\n28:1020 [1817]). That is, its concept of God is just that of\nunconditioned quality, quantity, modality, and relation.\n\nAbsent all \u201cinformation\u201d about the conditioned,\nTranscendental Theology is thus without the resources to develop the\nconcept of God used in either Natural or Moral Theology, i.e, the\n\u201cwise author of nature\u201d or the judge and\n\u201cruler\u201d of nature, respectively (AK 28:452 [1968], AK\n28:596 [1821], AK 28:1002 [1817]). Consequently, Kant claims that\nTranscendental Theology is inadequate, yielding \u201conly a\nsilhouette of a theology\u201d (AK 28:605, AK 28:452 [1968]). Its\nconception of God is \u201cuseless\u201d (AK 28:596 [1821]),\n\u201cunusable\u201d (AK 28:452 [1968]), and \u201cquite\nsuperfluous to us\u201d (AK 28:1020 [1817]). For it provides us only\nwith the god of Deism, and according to the lectures, this God is\n\u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cunusable\u201d.\n\nHence, despite the familiar-seeming term, Kant does not mean by\n\u201cDeism\u201d how it was typically used by the British. Their\nDeism is rather much more akin to what Kant means by\n\u201cTheism\u201d, as the outcome of Natural (vs. Transcendental)\nTheology. That is, Kant maintains in the Critique of Pure\nReason that our picture of nature as having systematic unity\ncommits us to seeing nature \u201cas if\u201d it were created by a\n\u201cWise Author\u201d (A644/B672\u2013A645/B673).\n\nThis is not, however, a new twist on the Argument from Design. While\nKant turns to Theism to explain how we make the ground of the natural\norder \u201ccomprehensible\u201d (AK 6:65n [1793]) to ourselves,\nthis is not a proof for God\u2019s existence but rather an appeal to\nthe idea of a Wise Author varyingly described as\n\u201csymbolic\u201d (AK 4:437 [1785b]), \u201cheuristic\u201d\n(A671/B699), a \u201cfocus imaginarius\u201d (A645/B673),\nor a supposition to be taken\n\n\nonly problematically [vs assertorically] \u2026 so as to regard all\nthe connection of things in the world of sense as if they had their\nground in this being of reason. (A681/B709)\n\n\nIt is nonetheless a supposition that (at least from the later 1770\nthrough most of the 1780s) Kant believes we cannot do without.\n\u201c[W]e must presuppose such a being\u201d (A697/B725), for in\nits absence, reason would be at odds with itself, at once intending a\nsystematic unity to nature and at the same time without a principle to\nground that systematicity.\n\nLastly, note that despite Allen Wood\u2019s claim in\n\u201cKant\u2019s Deism\u201d that Kant\u2019s account of Deism is\ndisconnected from the \u201ccommon seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century usage\u201d and thus is\n\u201cidiosyncratic\u201d (Wood 1991), Wood has mistaken the more\nfamiliar British use of the term with how the term was used by German\nRationalism. For example, Wolff, in his Theologia Naturalis\nhighlights the areas of agreement between Deism and atheism, arguing\nthat Deism can easily devolve into a \u201cpractical atheism\u201d.\n(Theologia Naturalis, \u00a7547). Baumgarten as well, in the\nMetaphysica, the textbook that Kant used in his courses on\nMetaphysics and Natural Theology, follows Wolff in this, describing\nDeism as \u201cthe doctrine [which] maintains that almost nothing is\nconceivable about God, except perhaps his existence\u201d\n(\u00a7862). Hence, however idiosyncratic this use of\n\u201cDeism\u201d may seem to the modern reader, it would not have\nbeen so for Kant\u2019s contemporary audience. In short, Kant uses\n\u201cDeism\u201d in a manner reflective of Wolff and\nBaumgarten\u2019s approach rather than how the British employed\nit.\n3.3 Religion and Theoretical Knowledge\n\nDespite Kant\u2019s explicit claim that one of the underlying drivers\nof Transcendental Idealism is to defend faith against theoretical\nreason, it is widely believed that his philosophical system powerfully\nchallenges, if not outright bars, religious belief. His criticisms of\nthe traditional arguments for God\u2019s existence are taken as\nillustrative of his opposition to religion, and the so-called\n\u201cRestriction Thesis\u201d of Transcendental Idealism is\nregarded as a barrier against all legitimate religious assent\n(Wolterstorff 1998, Rawls 2000, DiCenso 2012).\n\nAccording to Kant, we can have no knowledge of anything outside of\nexperience, outside the scope of the spatio-temporal-causal order.\nHence, there can be no knowledge of God, of the soul, of the\nafterlife, or anything else beyond that order. To compound this\nrestriction, Kant further asserts that we also can have no\n\u201ccognition\u201d [Erkenntnis] of objects outside the\nscope of experience. While the former is less ambiguous, the latter\nhas generated more debate, hanging very much on what it is to have a\n\u201ccognition\u201d (e.g., Watkins & Willaschek 2017, Chignell\n2017).\n\nMany have taken \u201ccognition\u201d to be a semantic notion, and\nso have taken Kant\u2019s denial of the cognizability of the\nsupersensible as a denial of even the intelligibility of religious\nconcepts. Thus, it is not merely that we cannot prove whether or not\nGod exists, but the concept of God itself, like all other concepts of\nsupersensible entities and properties, (allegedly) cannot even have\nmeaning for us.\n\nThe former position, that we can have no knowledge of the\nsupersensible, is textually well supported. Knowledge\n[Wissen], for Kant, follows its traditional tripartite model\nas justified-true-belief, and if there is neither experience nor\nrational proof of any supersensible claim, no such claim can meet with\nsuitable justification.\n\nThe latter position, that we can have no cognition of supersensible\nobjects, is likewise correct. However, the alleged implication that\nthis makes meaningful thought about them impossible is false. Kant\ndoes not reject the thinkability of the supersensible, and, in fact,\nthe body of arguments in the Transcendental Dialectic show this to be\nclearly the case. If, for example, propositions about the\nsupersensible were incoherent according to Kant, then he would not\nneed his Antinomies or Paralogisms. Rather, he could sweep them all\naway quite simply through the charge that they fall short of the\nconditions for meaning.\n\nThe problem, thus, is not that we cannot coherently think the\nsupersensible. It is, rather, that we can think about it in too many\nways. Absent experience, reason is without a touchstone through which\nhypotheses can be refuted. Instead, so long as the ideas of reason are\ninternally consistent, it can construct a multitude of theses and\nantitheses about the supersensible. It can, moreover, argue quite\nrobustly in favor of each, something we see both in the Antinomies and\nall the more grandly in the great tomes of the metaphysicians. The\nproblem, for Kant, is thus not about meaning, but rather it is\nepistemic: having no possible experience of the supersensible, we lack\nthe theoretical resources to adjudicate between competing claims.\nAccordingly, to cognize, for Kant, is to think an object or\nproposition in relation to the order of nature and the material\nconditions that govern whether or not it obtains\u2014what Kant calls\nthe cognition\u2019s \u201creal possibility\u201d. The conditions\nfor real possibility, in turn, provide the investigational framework\nthrough which we can verify or falsify what is being cognized.\n\n\u201cCognition\u201d, thus, is not a semantic notion, but\nepistemic. It is a mode of thinking that is not just fanciful\nimagining but is directed to objects whose reality can be determined.\nThinking requires merely the logical possibility of what is being\nentertained. So long as it is not self-contradictory, it can be\nthought. Cognition, by contrast, embeds the thought in the material\nconditions for, or the Real Possibility of, the object of thought,\nsomething that is not possible once one steps beyond the scope of\npossible experience.\n\nHence, we cannot have a cognition of God because, as Kant argues in\nthe Transcendental Dialectic\u2019s Ideal of Reason, there is no\nviable argument for God\u2019s existence. Likewise, we cannot prove\nor disprove a miracle, for its alleged supersensible cause is not\nsomething whose conditions are determinable for us. Even if we\nexperience some event whose cause is supersensible, we have no way\nwhatsoever to establish that this is so, and have nothing to guide our\nhypotheses about how to test for miracles or how they come to be.\n\nNone of this challenges the intelligibility of religious doctrines. So\nlong as they are not self-contradictory, they are thinkable. It is\njust that their truth or falsehood cannot possibly be known. Moreover,\nsince they are not within the spectrum of epistemic evaluation, we\ncannot opine regarding them, for opinion [Meinung], as Kant\nunderstands the term, is a mode of assent based upon the weighing of\ntheoretical grounds (evidence and argument) for and against truth.\n\nYet, this does not leave us with agnosticism either. Along with\nknowledge and opinion, Kant identifies faith as our third legitimate\nmode of holding-to-be-true [F\u00fcrwahrhalten]. Faith is,\nfor Kant, a mode of justified assent, though the nature of its\njustification is quite different from opinion and knowledge. It is not\nrooted in experience or argument, but rather in what he characterizes\nas the \u201cneeds\u201d of practical reason. Hence, for Kant,\nreligious belief finds its proper seat not in intellectual reflection\nbut in our practical lives.\n\nMoreover, Kant sees faith, unlike knowledge, as engaging with our\nwill, calling it a \u201cfree assent\u201d. This is important for\nthe practical function of faith, since our commitment to morality does\nnot so simply depend on our affirmation of the postulates, but in our\nfree act of faith through which we more completely bind ourselves to\nmorality. Morality, thus \u201cinevitably leads to religion\u201d\n(AK 6:6 [1793]), since we need the latter in order to sustain or fully\nrealize our commitment to the former. This, however, must not be\ninterpreted as \u201ctheological ethics\u201d, as if the authority\nof the moral law depended upon God. It is not its authority that is in\nquestion (perhaps with the exception of the argument at AK 5:114 in\nthe Critique of Practical Reason [1788]). Rather, this\nadvance from morality to religion concerns how we bind ourselves to\nthe former (cf. A632/B660, AK 5:481 [1788], AK 6:3 [1793]).\n3.3.1 Competing interpretations of Kant on religious assent\n\nAlthough Kant\u2019s presentation of faith as legitimate mode of\n\u201cholding-to-be-true\u201d, is consistently maintained through\nthe Critical period\u2019s published corpus, some Kantians have opted\nto develop interpretations which dismiss or overlook such discussions.\nWe will here briefly compare four different stances on religious\nassent in Kant.\n3.3.1.1 A mistake for Kant\n\nSome scholars hold that we should mostly ignore what Kant has to say\nabout the postulates, and, consequently, the positive part of his\nreligious philosophy. This is either because the postulates are taken\nas hold-overs from Kant\u2019s pre-Critical period that are\nincompatible with his Critical philosophy (Allison 1990), or because\nthe philosophical reasoning involving them is so bad as to be\nirrelevant to what makes Kant an important philosopher (Rawls 2000).\nRegardless of whether the postulates are a hold-over or simply poorly\nsupported, the result is the same: for scholars who take this view, it\nis not important to have a detailed understanding of the attitudes\ninvolved in postulation, as they aren\u2019t key to understanding\nwhat is valuable about Kant\u2019s philosophy.\n3.3.1.2 Only as symbol (useful representation but no assent)\n\nA second position that may be understood as an attempt to reconcile\nTranscendental Idealism with Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion is to\nreplace what he says about assent with a non-doxic attitude where\nreligious concepts, rather than objects of belief, are instead taken\nas regulative ideals or representations of moral principles\n(Davidovich 1993, Henrich 1999, DiCenso 2012). While there are many\npassages in the Critical period where Kant promotes assent, this is a\nview in line with some fasciles of the Opus Postumum. Guyer\n(2005), for example, maintains that rather than the Opus\nPostumum reflecting a break from Kant\u2019s Critical stance on\nreligious assent, it instead finally brings the true character of his\nposition to light.\n3.3.1.3 Needed assent on practical grounds\n\nThe most widespread view in recent scholarship is one that corresponds\nwith the works of Stevenson (2003), Chignell (2007), and Pasternack\n(2011). It also has earlier adherents including Beck (1960) and Wood\n(1970). Although there are interpretative differences among these\nfigures, there is a shared recognition that Kant does regard actual\nassent (holding-to-be-true) as having its ground in our moral\ninterests, as driven by a \u201cneed\u201d or the\n\u201cneeds\u201d of practical reason.\n\nWood (1970), for example, bases his view upon the \u201cAbsurdum\nPracticum\u201d argument where Kant states that anyone who\nrenounces the postulates would become \u201ccontemptible\u201d in\ntheir own eyes (A828/B856, AK 28:1083 [1817]). Chignell and Pasternack\ndevelop their interpretations primarily by way of an analysis of texts\nwhere Kant discusses the relationship between belief, knowledge and\nopinion. What is emphasized among these interpreters is the moral\nsignificance of religious assent rather than ontological commitment.\nSuch may be taken as the spirit of Kant\u2019s comment that \u201cI\nmust not even say \u2018It is morally certain that there is a\nGod\u2019, but rather \u2018I am morally certain\u2019\u201d\n(A829/B857).\n\nNote that while there are a considerable number of texts where Kant\nendorses the need for religious assent, we may nevertheless\ndistinguish between a number of positions. One holds that the adoption\nof a belief-state that is more akin to the symbolic use of the\npostulates, adopting them only in the form of an \u201cas if\u201d,\nwithout a commitment to their objective reality (Ferreira 2014). The\nmost famous indication of the \u201cas if\u201d attitude appears at\n4:448. Another position (Pasternack 2011, Insole 2016) is that Kant\nregarded faith as including a commitment to the objective reality of\nits objects. Passages in support of this view include AK 5:4 &\n5:134 [1788], AK 5:456 & 5:469 [1790], AK 8:139 [1785a], AK\n20:299. Note further that the spirit behind the \u201cas if\u201d\nattitude may be reemerging in a new form within the recent interest in\nKant\u2019s conception of moral hope.\n3.3.2 Hope\n\nIn the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant writes\nthat\n\n\nall interest of my reason (the speculative as well as the practical)\nis united in the following three questions: 1. What can I know? 2.\nWhat should I do? 3. What may I hope.\n\n\nKant then goes on to explain that hope is\n\n\nsimultaneously practical and theoretical, so that the practical leads\nlike a clue to a reply to the theoretical question and, in its highest\nform, the speculative question.\n\n\nKant further describes hope in relation to our interest in happiness\n(A805/B833). The latter point perhaps connects more specifically with\nhow Kant frames the highest good in the Critique of Pure\nReason versus later work. Nevertheless, despite how Kant\nhighlights the question of hope in this text, it does not receive the\nsame level of exposition as knowledge, opinion or faith. For further\ndiscussion of Kant on hope, see the section on Kant in the  entry on\n hope.\n3.4 The Highest Good\n\nKant\u2019s doctrine of the highest good is the foundation of his\npositive philosophy of religion. With the exception of some musings\n(esp. in the Critique of Pure Reason) about an assent driven\nby our regulative employment of purposiveness (cf. B426, A670/B698 and\nA826/B854), the path to religion is through the highest good. It is\nthrough this doctrine that Kant endorses belief in God\u2019s\nexistence as well as the immortality of the soul. It is also through\nthis doctrine that Kant sets out what in the Religion he\ncalls the Pure Rational System of Religion. Therein, Kant appraises\nChristian doctrines to determine whether or not they are conducive to\nour duty to pursue the highest good (see\n section 3.6.4\n and\n section 3.7\n below).\n\nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant distinguishes\nbetween the \u201csupreme\u201d, the \u201ccomplete\u201d, and\n\u201chighest\u201d good. By \u201csupreme good\u201d, he means\nthe good that is \u201cnot subordinate to any other\u201d (AK 5:110\n[1788]). That is, if there are a plurality of values, the supreme good\nis the one that overrides the rest. Hence, if pleasure were taken as a\nvalue, its value would be subordinate to morality, and thus its value\nwould be defeated or overridden if the pleasure comes through a\nviolation of the moral law.\n\nThe \u201ccomplete good\u201d is one that \u201cis not part of a\nstill greater whole of the same kind\u201d (AK 5:110 [1788). Kant\nthen explains that while morality is the supreme good, it is not the\ncomplete good \u201cas the object of the faculty of desire of\nrational finite beings\u201d (AK 5:110). This is because in addition\nto morality, finite rational beings also desire happiness. So,\nalthough happiness is subordinate to morality, morality is not the\n\u201ccomplete good\u201d because it does not encompass all that we\ndesire.\n\nKant then presents the highest good as a synthesis of morality and\nhappiness in order to meet the axiological principles of supremacy and\ncompleteness. More specifically, he presents the highest good as an\nideal state of affairs in which there is a proportional distribution\nof happiness in accordance with moral worth (A809/B837, AK 5:110 &\n5:145 [1788]; AK 5:471 [1790]; AK 6:8n & 6:99 [1793]; AK 8:139\n[1785a]; AK 8:281 [1764]). Nevertheless, some interpreters have\nproposed that Kant withdrew this formulation in later years,\nsupporting instead the notion that the highest good reflects the idea\nof maximal happiness and maximal morality as two independent variables\n(Reath 1988, Guyer 2011, Moran 2012). However, Pasternack (2017a)\nargues at length that the corpus neither supports this nor the\nputative abandonment of one or both of the postulates of God and\nimmortality (see\n section 3.5.2\n below).\n3.5 The Practical Postulates\n\nAlthough Kant enumerates three postulates, freedom, God, and\nimmortality, their etiologies differ. In contrast to the latter two,\nthe postulate of freedom is more directly tied to the fact of reason,\ntaken as a necessary condition for the bindingness of the moral law\nupon us. By contrast, the postulates of God and Immortality are rooted\nin the highest good. As such, we will here only be concerned with the\nlatter two \u201creligious\u201d postulates.\n3.5.1 The postulate of God\n\nWhile the Critique of Pure Reason shows some sympathy for the\nArgument from Design, Kant remarks that it can only get us to a\n\u201cWise Author of Nature\u201d, a being who is responsible for\nthe order of nature, rather than a creator, a being with infinite\ncapacities, or a moral being. By contrast, the Canon of the First\nCritique advances a conception of God as omnipotent,\nomniscient, and omnibenevolent. Hence, as there argued, in order for\nthe highest good to obtain, there must be a being capable of arranging\nthe world such that happiness is exactly proportioned to moral worth.\nThis being must further have the cognitive powers necessary to judge\nor moral worth, and, presumably, a will aligned with morality.\n\nKant explains that our construction of the classic conception of God\nas omnipotent, omniscient and all good gains its validity through the\nneed for this being as the agent responsible for the distribution of\nhappiness in proportion to moral worth (A816/B845\u2013A819/B847). It\nis through morality and the highest good that we \u201cproduced a\nconcept of the divine being that we now hold to be correct\u201d\n(A818/B846). Likewise, \u201cWhat does it Mean to Orient Oneself in\nThinking\u201d, Kant explains that the very \u201cconcept\nof God and even the conviction of his existence\u201d arises\nthrough our practical needs and that these needs operate as the\n\u201csignpost or compass by means of which the speculative thinker\norients himself in his rational excursions into the field of\nsupersensible objects\u201d (AK 8:142 [1785a]). In other words, while\ntheoretical reason on its own ventures into this field without any\nvalid warrants, the needs of practical reason, from which we form both\nour concepts of the postulates and the basis for our assent, is, Kant\nmaintains, the sole basis by which we may extend our cognition (i.e.,\nvalid construction of concepts) into the supersensible.\n3.5.2 The postulate of immortality\n\nThe postulate of immortality is typically found alongside Kant\u2019s\ndiscussions of the postulate of God. He regards both as necessary\nconditions for the realization of the highest good, though the\nfunction of this postulate undergoes a number of revisions through the\nCritical period.\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant presents two distinct\narguments for it. The first is a non-moral argument and is found in\nthe B-Paralogism, after his rejection of Mendelssohn\u2019s argument\nfor the same. Mendelssohn\u2019s argument builds off the thesis that\nthe soul is a simple entity and cessation of existence involves a\ndissolution of one part and then another. He thus concludes that since\nthe soul is simple, it is impossible for it to cease to exist. Kant\nrejects this argument on the grounds that even simple beings can have\na degree of reality (an intensive magnitude) that can diminish to\nzero, he shortly thereafter presents his own argument for the\nsoul\u2019s immortality, one that has a similar metaphysical bent:\n(a) since throughout nature there is a proportionality between\npurposes and the conditions for the realization of those purposes,\nthere should be a similar proportionality between our capacities and\nthe conditions for their realization, and (b) since the grandeur of\nour capacities, including both our natural talents and moral vocation,\nexceeds what can be realized in this life, it follows (c) that we are\njustified in affirming a \u201cfuture life\u201d. This argument, or\none very similar to it, is also present in the Canon\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201cdoctrinal belief\u201d [doctrinale\nGlaube]. However, this is not an argument that endures beyond the\n1780s. It is absent in later works, and in the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant explicitly dismisses it along with all other\nnon-moral arguments for the afterlife (cf. AK 5:460 & 5:468\n[1790]).\n\nThe other and better known argument for this postulate is first found\nin the Critique of Pure Reason\u2019s Canon. Like his\nargument for the postulate of God, Kant also argues that we must\npostulate the immortality of the soul as a necessary condition for the\ndistribution of happiness in the highest good. Given the exigencies of\nthe natural order, this distribution cannot be secured within this\norder. We must therefore posit a \u201cfuture life\u201d, a\n\u201cKingdom of Grace\u201d where \u201cevery happiness awaits us\nas long as we do not ourselves limit our share of it through the\nunworthiness to be happy\u201d (A812/B840). Hence, in the First\nCritique, the purpose of the afterlife is to provide a domain\nfor the highest good\u2019s distribution of happiness.\n\nBefore moving forward, let us discuss the belief found in some\nquarters (Reath 1989, Rawls 2000, Guyer 2005) that Kant abandoned the\npostulate of immortality in the 1790s.\n\nThe most common claim used to support this assertion is that\nKant\u2019s uses the phrase \u201chighest good in the world\u201d\n(AK 5:450 [1790]) in the Critique of Judgment in order to\nsignal a shift away from an afterlife ideal distribution of happiness\nin proportion to moral worth to the ideal of the highest good as\nconnected with our ordinary corporeal existence. What, however, Kant\nmeans by \u201cin the world\u201d requires some investigation before\nany such conclusions can be drawn.\n\nFirst, Kant directly discusses what he intends by \u201cworld\u201d\nin the Critique of Pure Reason where he explains to readers\nthat he will be using \u201cnature\u201d to refer to \u201cthe\nunity in the existence of appearances\u201d (A419/B447) versus\n\u201cworld\u201d, which has a \u201ctranscendental sense\u201d,\nsuch that when dealing with cosmological ideas, \u201cworld\u201d\ngoes beyond just the phenomenal to the \u201csum total of existing\nthings\u201d (A419/B447).\n\nSecond, we see \u201cworld\u201d used in this manner throughout the\ncorpus, including passages where it is quite clear that Kant uses\n\u201cworld\u201d in its \u201ctranscendental sense\u201d,\nextending beyond just the realm of nature (e.g., A811/B839, A813/B839,\nAK 5:143 [1788], AK 8:139 [1785a], 20:298. In fact, Kant even\ndescribes the postulate of immortality as obtaining \u201cin the\nworld\u201d at the opening of his discussion of this postulate in the\nCritique of Practical Reason (AK 5:122\u2014see also 5:143\n[1788]).\n\nThird, the highest good is linked with the immortality of the soul\ncontinually through the texts of the 1790s, including the Critique of\nJudgment, where it can be found more than a dozen times through its\nfinal section. It is mentioned briefly in the \u201cTheodicy\u201d\nessay of 1791 (AK 8:262 & 8:269n), in multiple passages throughout\nthe Religion, in \u201cThe End of All Things\u201d (AK\n8:328\u2013330 [1794]) in the Conflict of the Faculties (AK\n7:40, 7:44, etc. [1798]), the 1796 \u201cProclamation\u201d Essay\n(AK 8:418\u2013419), as well as in \u201cReal Progress\u201d (AK\n20:298). Accordingly, despite the stature of those who put forward the\nclaim that Kant abandoned the postulate of immortality circa 1790, it\nis a claim that does not attend to either how Kant uses\n\u201cworld\u201d versus \u201cnature\u201d, nor the surfeit of\naffirmative discussions about the afterlife through the 1790s.\n\nFourth, supporters of the abandonment thesis assert that Kant no\nlonger needs the postulate of immortality (and perhaps God) because in\nthe 1790s he further abandons his earlier picture of the highest good\nas a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral worth, adopting\ninstead the idea that this ideal is composed of maximal happiness and\nmaximal morality as two independent variables. The basis for this\nclaim is his 1793 essay \u201cOn the Common Saying: \u2018That may\nbe Correct in Theory, but it is of no use in Practice\u2019\u201d\nwhere Kant describes the highest good as \u201cuniversal happiness\ncombined with and in conformity with the purest morality throughout\nthe world\u201d (AK 8:279). Yet the interpretative merits of this\nclaim built upon this passage are greatly diminished once one attends\nto the footnote Kant attaches to it, where he explains that he does\nnot mean happiness on its own, \u201cbut only of a proportion between\nit and the worthiness of a subject\u201d (AK 8:280n).\n\nThe abandonment thesis is further defended by Guyer (2016) where in\naddition to building his case for this thesis based upon the\naforementioned depiction of the highest good at AK 8:279, he also\nargues that in the Religion Kant has given up the Second\nCritique\u2019s rationale for the postulate of immortality,\nnamely, immortality as required for the sake of an eternal striving\nfor perfection. Rather than being tied to (striving for) perfection,\nwe find in the Religion that our moral worthiness is instead\ntied to our supreme maxim or \u201cchange of heart\u201d.\n\nThat is, Guyer proposes that the standard for moral worthiness offered\nby Kant in the Religion no longer itself requires the\npostulation of immortality. This is a view likewise advanced by\nPasternack (2014: 142\u2013146) in his discussion of the\n\u201cchange of heart\u201d in the Religion. Unlike what is\nfound in the Second Critique, in both the Religion\nand \u201cThe End of All Things\u201d (1794), Kant presents our\nafterlife fate as solely dependent upon (or should be viewed as solely\ndependent upon) what we can morally achieve in this life (AK\n6:69n\u201371n [1793], AK 8:328\u2013330 [1794]). Hence, once our\nmoral worthiness is understood as something to be achieved in this\nlife, how one interprets Kant\u2019s commitment to the postulate\ncentrally turns on how one interprets his views on the distribution of\nhappiness within the highest good.\n\nAs discussed through this subsection, Kant\u2019s views on the\npostulate of immortality through the Critical period involve these\nthree core issues: (a) the standard for moral worth articulated by\nKant in various texts; (b) whether Kant continues to regard the\nhighest good as a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral\nworth versus as maximal happiness and maximal morality as two\nindependent variables; and (c) whether or not the distribution of\nhappiness (especially if taken as proportionate to moral worth)\ndepends upon the postulate of immortality (i.e., cannot take place\nwithin the causal order of nature). Beyond these three core issues,\nfurther issues include: (d) the limitations to and relevance of our\nspeculations about the nature of the afterlife (see AK\n6:69n\u20136:71n [1793] and AK 8:328\u2013332 [1794]) and (e) the\nhistorical backdrop for Kant\u2019s engagement with various models of\nthe afterlife (see Bunch 2010).\n3.6 Kant as Philosophical Theologian\n\nIn October 1794, Kant received a royal rescript from the court of\nFrederick William II reprimanding him for his heterodox writings on\nChristianity and prohibiting him from further publication which\n\u201cdistort and disparage\u201d Christianity (cf. AK 7:6\n[1798]). In his official response (unknown date, but late October 1794\nis most likely), Kant agreed to \u201chereafter refrain altogether\nfrom discoursing publicly, in lectures or writing, on religion,\u201d\nbut also protested that his writings nevertheless have made\n\u201cno appraisal of Christianity\u201d (AK 7:8\n[1798]).\n\nPutting aside the question as to whether Kant might have prevaricated\nin his response, the question remains: to what extent does Kant engage\nwith Christian doctrine and to what extent is his philosophical\ntheology compatible with it? On the one hand, there are\nepistemological questions which we have addressed elsewhere in this\nentry. But there is also the question of whether or not Kant saw his\nwork as compatible or at odds with such core Christian doctrines as\nOriginal Sin, Grace, the Incarnation, and Vicarious Atonement. We will\nhere consider four interpretative positions.\n3.6.1 A successful Christian apologist\n\nSome interpreters have claimed that the Religion serves as\nKant\u2019s philosophical defense of traditional Christian doctrines,\nand that it succeeds in this regard. This is a view advanced by Chris\nFirestone and Nathan Jacobs in their In Defense of Kant\u2019s\nReligion. For example, these authors hold that Kant\u2019s\nportrayal of moral evil in Part One is shaped by an \u201cAugustinian\nmetaphysic\u201d (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), that in Part Two\nKant promotes the idea of the Incarnation, utilizing a\n\u201cScotistic understanding of divine being\u201d (Firestone &\nJacobs 2008: 161) and that Part Four not only concludes with an\nargument for the \u201cpriority of belief in Christianity\u201d but\ndefends the necessity of special revelation which, as they earlier\nclaim, is necessary for Kant\u2019s critical philosophy as a whole\n(Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 115).\n\nA similar position is advanced by Stephen Palmquist who finds in the\nReligion not only an examination of those aspects of rational\nreligion which conform with Christian doctrine, but also a\nphilosophical defense of the need for revelation. Palmquist claims,\nfor example, that Religion\u2019s treatment of Original Sin\nis used by Kant to articulate \u201cwhat we might call a Christ-sized\n\u2018hole\u2019 in the heart of humanity\u2019s rational\ncapacity\u201d (Palmquist 2016: 165), that Kant \u201cregarded the\nChristian Gospel as a genuine revelation\u201d (Palmquist 2016: 166)\nand that an otherwise deficient \u201cbare reason\u201d requires\nrevelatory content in order that we may \u201cbelieve\u201d in our\nown capacity to imitate the \u201carchetype of perfection\u201d\n(Palmquist 2016: 166). That is, Palmquist contends that, in line with\ntraditional Christianity, Kant regards our salvation as dependent upon\nhaving faith in the historical reality of the Incarnation.\n3.6.2 A Failed Christian apologist\n\nA second school of interpretation likewise maintains that Kant wrote\nthe Religion for the purposes of offering a philosophical\ndefense of traditional Christian doctrines. This school, however,\nholds that he was ultimately unsuccessful. This is a view which\nprincipally flows from Karl Barth\u2019s 1947 Die protestantische\nTheologie im 19. Jahrhundert, and is adopted by a group of later\nphilosophers of religion including members of the school of\n\u201cReformed Epistemology\u201d, including Philip Quinn, Nicholas\nWolterstorff and John Hare.\n\nWithin Kant circles, they are best known for the so-called\n\u201cConundrum\u201d interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nReligion, where these authors protest that Kant\u2019s\nventure into philosophical theology is not only inconsistent with the\nepistemic strictures of Transcendental Idealism (Wolterstorff 1998),\nbut also is internally inconsistent in virtue of the fact that its\nunderstanding of Original Sin is essentially Augustinian while its\nunderstanding of moral restoration is Pelagian. Wolterstorff goes so\nfar as to claim that Kant\u2019s philosophical theology suffers from\n\u201cnot just implausibility or tension, but internal\ncontradiction\u201d (Wolterstorff 1991: 49). Likewise, John Hare\n(1996) declares it an outright \u201cfailure\u201d and Gordon\nMichalson (1990) contends that the Religion contains a litany\nof \u201cwobbles\u201d between incompatible Christian and\nEnlightenment commitments.\n\nAlthough there are a number of other targets of criticism, their main\ncontention is that Kant inconsistently accepts (a) the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin which holds that our moral capacities have\nthrough the Fall been damaged in such a way that we are incapable of\nmoral improvement without Sanctifying Grace; and yet (b) Kant\nsubscribes to what they call his \u201cStoic Maxim\u201d that\n\u201ca person\u2019s moral worth is determined entirely by that\nperson himself\u201d (Wolterstorff 1991: 48). Recently, Andrew\nChignell has accepted the essence of the \u201cConundrum\u201d\nobjection, relying upon it as a reason why Kant must appeal to hope:\nsince Kant\u2019s alleged \u201cStoic Maxim\u201d leaves no room\nfor divine aid, and yet divine aid seems to be needed, it can be (at\nbest) an object of hope, since unlike other propositional attitudes,\nhope is rationally permissible in the face of a (seeming)\nimpossibility so long as it does not rise to an impossibility of\n\u201cthe most fundamental modal level\u201d (Chignell 2014:\n114\u2013115).\n3.6.3 Non-doxic theologian\n\nA third school holds that despite appearances to the contrary, the\nReligion does not engage in \u201ctheological speculation\nconcerning the doctrine of grace in any form\u201d (DiCenso 2012:\n117). This view is advanced by James DiCenso in his 2012 commentary on\nthe Religion, and more recently by Allen Wood in his Kant\nand Religion (2020). The former\u2019s 2012 commentary\nadvises that we avoid any literal reading of religious doctrines in\nthe text, and that we should instead interpret Kant\u2019s treatment\nof them as presenting no more than our moral ideals in\n\u201cimaginatively enhanced or pictorial form\u201d (2012:\n28).  Likewise, in the latter\u2019s Kant and\nReligion (2020), the author presents\nthe Religion as a study of how we can understand\nChristianity\u2019s presentation of a \u201csecond-person relationship\nbetween myself and God\u201d (Wood 2020: 137) as instead symbols\nfor a first-person \u201cself-relation\u201d (Wood 2020: 137,\n143) through which we gain \u201ca meaningful and\nemotionally enriched way of relating to our own past\u201d (Wood\n2020: 145). Interestingly, these interpretations\ncohere with certain interpretations of Kant\u2019s philosophical\ntheology in the Opus Postumum (see Section 4 below), with\nboth extending not only the thesis that God, for Kant, is nothing but\na symbol of our moral ideals, but that all religious doctrines\ninvolving the supersensible should likewise be interpreted as\nsuch.\n\nFurther, both interpretations pick up on a number of comments in\nthe Religion where Kant associates the historical side of\nreligion with our need for symbols to help us with the \u201chighest\nconcepts and grounds of reason\u201d (AK 6:109 [1793]) and hopes for\na future time where we will no longer need \u201call statutes that\nrest on history\u201d (AK 6:121 [1793]). Nevertheless, this aspect\nof Kant\u2019s treatment of religion does not apply to the\npostulates, nor does it pertain to the underlying moral/theological\nissues which are symbolized in specific doctrines (e.g., our innate\npropensity to evil as represented in the story of Genesis, or our hope\nfor divine as represented in the Crucifixion).\n\nWhat principally differentiates DiCenso (2012) and Wood (2020),\nhowever, is that the former\u2019s hermeneutic denies outright that Kant\never engages with any doctrine in its literal form, whereas the latter\nsees the core goal of the Religion to \u201cinterpret\nrevealed Christianity in such a way \u2026 [to] show that reason and\nChristianity are allies, not enemies\u201d (Wood 2020: 20). But in\norder to realize that goal, doctrines have to be rendered as just\nsymbols. So, while Wood recognizes that Kant rejects various doctrines\n(e.g. the story of Abraham and Isaac on Wood 2020: 14; and the\ninheritability of sin on Wood 2020: 62), such rejections occur only\nwhen doctrines are understood literally.  Accordingly, Wood would have\nus look past Kant\u2019s engagements with literal doctrines and take Kant\nas claiming that they need to be understood just as symbols. This\nwould then allow for the thesis that \u201ceverything in revealed\n(Christian) faith is compatible with rational faith\u201d (Wood 2020:\n20), which Wood asserts is the aim of the so-called \u201cSecond\nExperiment\u201d of the\nReligion, i.e. the goal of the Second Experiment is\nto \u201cdisprove the hypothesis... [that] there are parts\nof revealed Christianity that are demonstrably and permanently\nincompatible with rational religion\u201d (Wood 2020: 20). \n3.6.4 Pure rational system of religion\n\nA fourth interpretative position is that the aim of Religion\nis to (a) examine the scope of \u201cunity\u201d or\n\u201ccompatibility\u201d between rational religion and historical\nfaith and (b) evaluate which aspects of historical faith (with\nChristianity being the primary focus) are apt vehicles for rational\nreligion versus those which are incompatible with it (Pasternack\n2014). Hence, the Religion was not written as a Christian\napologetic, but rather is Kant\u2019s inquiry into the relationship\nbetween natural theology and revealed religion. However, unlike the\nmany other such inquiries written during the era, Kant\u2019s own\nversion of natural theology is one that shaped by moral rather than\ntheoretical reason.\n\nBy way of this interpretative framework, Pasternack (2014) maintains\nthat the Religion is both compatible with the epistemic\nstrictures of Transcendental Idealism (contrary the interpretations\nsummarized above) as well as internally consistent. As for the\ndiscussions where Kant appears to be guided by an \u201cAugustinian\nmetaphysic\u201d (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), \u201cfirmly\nensconced within the Augustinian tradition\u201d (Quinn 1988: 91) or\n\u201caccommodating\u201d (Wood 1970: 246) tenets \u201cfundamental\nto Augustine\u201d (Beiser 2006: 594), he is rather examining such\ntenets in order to determine whether or not they have\n\u201cunity\u201d or \u201ccompatibility\u201d with rational\nreligion. Such doctrines as Original Sin, Grace, the Incarnation,\nVicarious Atonement and so forth are thus examined by Kant in the\nReligion in order to, in each case, assess whether or not\nthey cohere with his moral anthropology and doctrine of the highest\ngood.\n3.7 The Aims and Structure of the Religion\n\nUntil the recent spate of commentaries on the Religion,\nlittle work has been done on its overall aims and structure. Although\nPart One of the text has long been mined for insights into\nKant\u2019s picture of the moral agency, such studies did not\nconsider how the overall text might inform the passages minded\ntherefrom. The last decade, however, has seen the publication of a\nnumber of commentaries on the Religion, each with their own\ndistinctive interpretations (Firestone & Jacobs 2008, DiCenso\n2012, Pasternack 2014, Miller 2015, Palmquist 2016), most of whose\nauthors are mentioned in this entry. The above section also provides a\nbrief overview of their respective positions with regards to the\nrelationship between Kant\u2019s Religion and core Christian\ndoctrines. In this section, we will briefly review what Kant himself\nsays about his project and how it unfolds through its four parts.\n3.7.1 The two prefaces\n\nTo begin, the publication of the Religion (1793) has a\ncomplicated history. Kant initially planned to write a series of\nessays on Christian doctrines, but that was frustrated when the second\nof these essays was denied official imprimatur. Because the Prussian\nCensorship Commission had different rules for the publication of\narticles versus books, Kant chose to combine the planned essays into a\nsingle volume, and to avoid further scrutiny by the Commission, he\nmade sure that it was assessed as a work of philosophy rather than\ntheology. Although such maneuvers ultimately led to his censorship\nduring the reign of Frederick William II, Kant nevertheless was able\nto publish the Religion, whose First Preface includes, after\nan initial discussion of how through the highest good \u201cmorality\nleads inevitably to religion\u201d (AK 6:8n), a defense of his\nrationale for treating the work as one of philosophical theology\nrather than \u201cbiblical theology\u201d (AK 6:7\u20136:11). The\nPreface then ends with Kant\u2019s characterization of the\nReligion as an \u201cattempt\u201d or\n\u201cexperiment\u201d (Versuch) at determining the scope\nof overlap between the \u201cpure philosophical doctrine of\nreligion\u201d (AK 6:10) and the contents of historical faith\n(especially Christianity).\n\nThe Preface to the second edition begins with a discussion of the\nReligion\u2019s title, which as Kant explains, is meant to\ndepict two overlapping domains, the \u201cwider sphere of\nfaith\u201d and the \u201cnarrower\u201d sphere of the \u201cpure\nreligion of reason\u201d (AK 6:12). Kant then writes that\nfrom \u201cthis standpoint I can also make this second\nexperiment\u201d (zweiten Versuch), without, however,\nexplicitly enumerating a \u201cfirst experiment\u201d.\n\nSome have proposed (Hare 1996, Reardon 1988) that the unstated\n\u201cfirst experiment\u201d pertains to the domain of overlap\nbetween Biblical Theology and the Pure Rational System of Religion.\nThe Second Experiment then seeks\n\n\nto show that certain items in the outer circle lead back within the\ninner circle when looked at in the light of, or translated in terms of\nmoral concepts. (Hare 1996: 40)\n\n\nOthers have proposed that the First Experiment pertains to the\nReligion\u2019s \u201ctranscendental elements\u201d while\nthe Second Experiment \u201caims at assessing one particular\nempirical religion\u201d, namely Christianity (Palmquist 2000: 143),\nor serves as a philosophical apologetic for Christianity (Firestone\n& Jacobs 2008).\n\nPasternack (2017b), however, argues that the interpretative debate\nover the first/second experiment distinction rests on a simple\nmistake. Normally, Versuch would be translated as\n\u201cattempt\u201d, but early Anglophone translators of the\nReligion chose instead \u201cexperiment\u201d. That choice\nhas passed along through contemporary translations and has led\ninterpreters to make far too much of this passage. The passage appears\ntowards the opening of the Preface to the second edition of\nthe Religion and is, as argued by Pasternack, merely meant by\nKant to indicate that he is issuing his second attempt\n[zweiten Versuch] at the very same non-enumerated\n\u201cexperiment\u201d [Versuch] similarly described in the\nPreface to the first edition (compare the language at AK 6:10\nin the First Preface to AK 6:12 in the Second). In other words,\nPasternack asserts that the many attempts to divide out the\nReligion into two distinct \u201cexperiments\u201d is an\nunfortunate byproduct of the secondary literature, unrelated to the\nactual structure of the text.\n\nWhat both Prefaces ultimately explain is that Kant\u2019s goal in the\nReligion is to (a) provide an inquiry into the scope of\noverlap between historical faith (especially in the form of\nChristianity) and pure rational religion; and (b) use the latter as a\nguide for distinguishing between which elements of the former are\nmatters of \u201cgenuine religion\u201d rather than\n\u201ccult\u201d (AK 6:12\u201313). Each of the\nReligion\u2019s four parts then take on core issues with\nChristian doctrine.\n3.7.2 Part one\n\nIn Part One, Kant\u2019s aim is to examine the Christian doctrine of\nOriginal Sin, especially as he would have been exposed to it through\nhis Lutheran Pietist upbringing. His interest is in finding out\nwhether there is any overlap between this historical doctrine and pure\nrational religion. More specifically, his goal is to assess the\ndoctrine of Original Sin so as to determine what (if any) overlap it\nhas with rational religion. He thus considers such matters as: how can\nour moral condition be innate and yet we can remain responsible for\nit; whether, as would have been held by the Augustinian tradition,\nOriginal Sin involves such a fundamental corruption of our faculties\nthat we lose the cognitive and volitional capacities needed to will\nthe good; and then in the \u201cGeneral Remark\u201d or first\nParergon, whether or not our corrupted moral condition is\nsuch that divine aid is required for us to overcome it. Throughout, we\nsee Kant taking up these and other themes within the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin, sometimes finding places of overlap with\nrational religion, sometimes finding the two in conflict.\n3.7.3 Part two\n\nThe Second Part of the Religion moves on to Christology and\nthe alleged role of Christ in our salvation. Kant begins with a\ndiscussion of the Incarnation and whether it can be interpreted in\nsuch a way that is compatible with pure rational religion (AK\n6:60\u20136:66). He then moves on to three\n\u201cdifficulties:\u201d how to understand the doctrine of\nSanctifying Grace (the \u201cchange of heart\u201d or moral\nregeneration) in relation to pure rational religion; whether an\nindividual can know his/her moral status as having undergone a\n\u201cchange of heart\u201d, and how this relates to the challenge\nof moral perseverance; how to understand the \u201cdebt of sin\u201d\nor the issue of \u201cJustifying Grace\u201d. On this issue, we\nagain see Kant opposing the prevailing doctrines of his day,\nexplicitly rejecting the idea of \u201cvicarious atonement\u201d (AK\n6:72\u201373) as anathema to pure rational religion.\n3.7.4 Part three\n\nThe Third Part of the Religion considers religion from a\nhistorical standpoint, including the need for the founding of a\nuniversal church, the importance of that church for the moral\nimprovement of society (the \u201cethical community\u201d),\nquestions of divine providence, and eschatology.\n\nKant\u2019s focus in this part is the social dimension of moral evil,\nwhere he draws from the Predisposition to Humanity discussed in Part\nOne (see Wood 1999), and argues that we \u201cmutually corrupt each\nother\u2019s moral dispositions and make one another evil\u201d (AK\n6:94). The goal of the universal church is to promote a new sort of\nsocial exchange guided by our collective \u201cduty sui\ngeneris\u201d of human beings to work cooperatively towards\n\u201ca common end, namely the promotion of the highest good\u201d\n(AK 6:97). The ethical community is then presented as an ideal state\nof affairs reflecting the realization of the highest good.\n3.7.5 Part four\n\nThe final part of the Religion focuses on ecclesiology. After\nan initial discussion of the religious framework for the ethical\ncommunity, Kant offers an important discussion of Christianity as a\nnatural versus a \u201clearned\u201d religion. The point of the\nformer is that \u201cgenuine religion\u201d, is one that can be\n\u201ccomprehensibly and convincingly\u201d communicated to all\nhuman beings \u201cthrough their own reason\u201d (AK 6:162) without\nany necessary role for revelation. The latter, by contrast, turns to\nthe \u201cdogmas of faith\u201d (AK 6:163) and its dangers. This\nbegins Kant\u2019s discussion of \u201ccounterfeit service\u201d,\n\u201cpriestcraft\u201d and the \u201cdelusions of religion\u201d\nhe sees in ecclesiastical practice. While rational religion maintains\nthat nothing apart from \u201cgood life-conduct\u201d is required to\n\u201cbecome well-pleasing to God\u201d (AK 6:170), historical faith\nroutinely claims that God\u2019s judgment is based instead on our\ndoctrinal commitments and liturgical observances.\n\nTherein, Kant examines the ultimate \u201csubjective ground of\nreligious delusion\u201d (AK 6:168), how the artificies of organized\nreligion let us \u201cslip back into evil\u201d (AK 6:184) and then\nfinally how practices including prayer, church attendance, and rituals\ncould nevertheless still be reconstituted for the genuine moral\nreligion of a universal church and \u201ccosmopolitan moral\ncommunity\u201d (AK 6:194\u2013200).\n3.7.6 The Parerga or General Remarks\n\nEach of the four parts of the Religion close with a section\nentitled \u201cGeneral Remark\u201d or \u201cParergon\u201d\n(Supplement or Appendix) to its main body. In the Second Edition to\nthe Religion, Kant adds a brief explanation of the function\nof the Parerga, describing them as concerned with matters\nwhich are at the \u201cborder\u201d of the \u201cboundaries of pure\nreason\u201d. He lists these as: (1) the effects of grace; (2)\nmiracles; (3) the holy mysteries; (4) the means of grace. Kant\nexplains that reason\n\n\ndoes not contest the possibility or actuality of the objects of these\nideas; it just cannot incorporate them into its maxims of thought or\naction. (AK 6:52)\n\n\nThey are topics to which we are lead given the issues under discussion\nthrough the main body of each part, but are all matters of caution for\nus for while they each pertain to a need that seems unfulfilled\nthrough what pure reason can allow for genuine religion, and in some\nmanner may invigorate our moral lives, they are all also paths to\n\u201cdogmatic faith\u201d (6:52).\n\nHence, each part of the Religion ends with a caution somewhat\nakin to the cautions which shape the Critique of Pure\nReason\u2019s Dialectic: though the needs of reason drive us to\nspeculation, we must not fall into error thereby. For example, while\nthe logic of ought implies can warrants our belief that a\n\u201cchange of heart\u201d is possible, we cannot either affirm or\ndeny a role for divine aid/grace. Likewise, while Transcendental\nIdealism leaves room for the possibility of a \u201csupernatural\nintervention\u201d (AK 6:191), we are not epistemically situated so\nthat we can ever justifiably claim that some particular effect was in\nfact due to such intervention.\n\nThe parerga thus are used by Kant to separate out what\ndoctrines of historical faith the pure rational system of religion can\nassess versus what doctrines that\u2014while we are compelled to\nspeculate about them\u2014require our agnosticism. As such, the\nparerga reflect limit issues, at the \u201cborder\u201d of\nrational religion, for which there is both a theoretical interest and\nmoral need to visit, but also where the dangers that we stray into\ndogmatism are the greatest (Palmquist 2016, Muchnik 2019).\n4. Religion in the Opus Postumum\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Kant began to explore what he saw as a \u201cgap...\nin the critical philosophy\u201d (Kant to Garve, September 21, 1798\nAK 12:257), namely, how to transition from what he established about\nnatural science in general in the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science to physics in particular. However, his notes on\nthis \u201cgap\u201d exceeded his original plan, as they came to\ncover not only how to transition from the foundations of natural\nscience to physics, but also self-positing, God, and the nature of\ntranscendental philosophy. These notes, which were composed during a\nroughly seventeen-year period, and came to be assembled under the\ntitle, Opus Postumum, prompt questions as to whether or not\nKant\u2019s views on God during this period represent a break from or\ncontinuity with the philosophy of religion he presented in his\nprevious works. And further, if there is continuity, in what way might\nits contents help to illuminate Kant\u2019s overall Critical\nphilosophy of religion?\n\nFor instance, there are many passages in the Opus Postumum\nwhich present God not as a substance or a being outside of us, but\nrather an ideal or thought-object. For some, this is taken as an\nindication that in Kant\u2019s final years, he withdrew from his more\naffirmative religious views seen up through the mid-1790s\n(F\u00f6rster 2000). While for others, it finally articulates the view\nthat Kant held throughout the Critical period, namely that despite\ntextual evidence to the contrary, Kant never advanced any argument,\nmoral or otherwise, for belief in God (W. Sullivan 1971, Guyer 2000,\nByrne 2007).\n\nNevertheless, amidst the passages in the Opus Postumum which\npresent God as merely an ideal or thought-object, there are others\nwhich are not so deflationary, presenting God in a manner similar to\nthe more familiar works of the Critical period (AK 21:13\u201314 [OP\n220\u2013222], AK 22:126\u2013127 [OP 206\u2013207]).\n\nOne way to understand these discrepancies is to recognize that the\nOpus Postumum is a collection of notes written over more than\na decade, unedited, and possibly different from what would have been\nthe final version of the treatise. Hence, Kant might have been\nrethinking his philosophy of religion, exploring possibilities, or\nworking through some ideas which could fill his perceived \u201cgap\nin the critical philosophy\u201d, ideas that neither undercut the\nepistemic strictures of the Critique of Pure Reason nor the\nreligiously affirmative language in his practical philosophy.\n\nFurther, though Kant sometimes describes God as an ideal or\nthought-object, he also says the same about the world and\nman-in-the-world, raising the possibility that his discussions of God\ntook place in two separate spheres: transcendental philosophy proper,\nwhich provides the purely formal conditions of metaphysics and so\nincludes only the ideals we must construct in order to posit ourselves\nin the world (namely, God, the world, and man-in-the-world); and\nmetaphysics, which is transcendental philosophy applied to certain\nobjects (\u201c[the transcendental philosopher] addresses merely what\nis formal, [the metaphysician] what is material (the object, the\nmaterial)\u201d [AK 21:79 [OP: 246]]). If this is right, then it\ncould be that Kant does not repudiate or deflate his prior philosophy\nof religion, but merely adds a new layer to it. Unfortunately, the\nOpus Postumum\u2019s unfinished state makes it difficult to\ncome to a secure conclusion about where Kant\u2019s thinking on\nreligion stood in his final years.",
