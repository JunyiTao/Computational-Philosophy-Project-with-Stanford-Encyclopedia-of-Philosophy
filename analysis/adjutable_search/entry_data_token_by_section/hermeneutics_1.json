    "main_text": "Interpretive Experience || Understanding as Educative\n1.1 Understanding as Educative\n\nIn hermeneutics, interpretive experience is typically clarified in\nreference to understanding. In this context, when we say that we\nunderstand, what we mean is that we have really gotten at something\nthrough an attempt at interpretation; and, when we say we do not\nunderstand, we mean that we have not really gotten anywhere at all\nwith our interpretation. For this reason, understanding can be\ndescribed as a \u2018success\u2019 of interpretation (even if, since\nHeidegger, understanding is more commonly described as a fulfillment,\nrealization, or enactment). In hermeneutics, such success of\nunderstanding is not measured by norms and methods typical of the\nmodern natural sciences and quantitative social sciences, such as\nwhether our understanding derives from a repeatable experiment, nor by\nnorms typical of much of modern philosophy, such as whether our\nunderstanding has indubitable epistemic foundations.\n\nNow, philosophers associated with hermeneutics describe the success of\nunderstanding in a number of manners. However else the success of\nunderstanding is described, though, it is typically also described as\nedifying or educative. Indeed, Hans-Georg Gadamer, the\nphilosopher perhaps most closely associated with hermeneutics in our\ntimes, closely connects interpretive experience with education. By\neducation, he has in mind the concept of formation (Bildung)\nthat had been developed in Weimar classicism and that continued to\ninfluence nineteenth-century romanticism and historicism in Germany\n(Truth and Method, Part\n I.1).[1]\n Education, as formation, involves more than the acquisition of\nexpertise, knowledge, or information; it concerns the enlargement of\nour person through formal instruction, especially in the arts and\nhumanities, as well as through extensive and variegated experience.\nAccordingly, the success of understanding is educative in that we\nlearn from our interpretive experience, perhaps not only about a\nmatter, but thereby also about ourselves, the world, and others.\n\nThat the success of understanding is educative in this manner can be\nclarified by an example, say, in reading a text such as\nThucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War. When we\nsay that we understand this text, we mean that our attempts to\ninterpret it (whether rigorously, as in scholarship, or more casually,\nas in evening reading) have gotten at something, perhaps: that in\npolitics, prudent reasoning is not always persuasive enough to stem\nthe tide of war. Certainly, we have not arrived at this understanding\nin result of repeatable scientific experiment or based on an\nindubitable epistemic foundation. But it is not for this reason any\nless educative. In this understanding, we have come to something that\nwe can agree or disagree with, something that in any case expands or\nchanges our views about the role of reason in politics (and no doubt\nthen also of public discourse and the causes of war), and, finally,\nsomething that can also teach us something about ourselves and the\nworld in which we find ourselves.\n",
