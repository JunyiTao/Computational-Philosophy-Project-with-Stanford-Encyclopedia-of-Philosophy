    "main_text": "Background || What is Moral Responsibility?\n1.2 What is Moral Responsibility?\n\nStart with what a person is morally responsible for. As\nformulated above, PAP is about responsibility for what a person\n\u201chas done\u201d. For most of this entry this will be\ninterpreted to mean her actions (see entry on\n action),\n here construed broadly to include both overt actions, such as walking\nto the store or shooting a gun, and mental actions, such as choosing\nto go to law school or calculating a move in chess. In addition to\nbeing responsible for actions, a person can be responsible for the\nconsequences of her actions. By putting salt in Sean\u2019s tea,\nMeghan is responsible, not just for ruining Sean\u2019s tea (what she\ndid), but for his tea\u2019s being ruined (the consequence of what\nshe did). A politician\u2019s opponents may claim she is responsible\nfor an economic downturn, a result of her decisions and policies.\nFinally, a person can be responsible for failures to act, sometimes\nknown as refrainings or omissions, and the consequences of such. Luke\nthe indifferent lifeguard is accountable for not saving the drowning\nswimmer, and thus for the death as well. PAP has a different cast\ndepending on whether responsibility for actions, consequences, or\nomissions is at issue. The focus for most of this entry is on actions,\nbut responsibility for consequences and omissions will appear again in\n \u00a75.3.\n\nWhat is it to be morally responsible? This entry adopts a broadly\n\u201cStrawsonian\u201d view in the tradition of P.F.\nStrawson\u2019s \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d (P. F. Strawson\n1962; cp. Fischer & Ravizza 1998, 6\u20138). To be morally\nresponsible is to be the proper object of the \u201creactive\nattitudes,\u201d such as respect, praise, forgiveness, blame,\nindignation, and the like. If Marija is responsible for adopting a\nstray cat, it\u2019s proper to praise her for this act. If it turns\nout Meghan is not responsible for ruining Sean\u2019s tea, then this\nmeans it\u2019s not appropriate, for Sean or anyone else, to blame or\nresent her for what she did. There are other theories of moral\nresponsibility (see entry on\n moral responsibility).\n What our principle looks like under these alternative accounts will\nremain open, though one can expect that problems similar to those\nconsidered below will arise on any but the most radically revisionary\nways of thinking of responsibility.\n\nOne final note on responsibility: In the literature one sometimes\nfinds the notion of true or ultimate moral\nresponsibility (Klein 1990; G. Strawson 1994; Kane 1996). It\u2019s\nnot always clear how this is related to what PAP calls, simply, moral\nresponsibility (M. Bernstein 2005; Boxer 2013). On one reading,\nultimacy is an additional condition on ordinary responsibility to be\nlisted alongside epistemic and other requirements alluded to earlier.\nOn the other hand, if talk of ultimacy is intended to signal a higher\ngrade of responsibility, there will be a corresponding version of our\nprinciple to be evaluated on its own terms:\n\n\nPAP-ultimate: a person is ultimately morally\nresponsible for what she has done only if she could have done\notherwise.\n\n\nThis enhanced version, if it\u2019s distinct from PAP, will not\nappear in what follows. But the discussion below could be relevant to\nPAP-ultimate. In particular, it\u2019s likely that PAP entails\nPAP-ultimate, so that arguments considered below for the former\n (\u00a72)\n could be brought in favor of the latter. What\u2019s less clear is\nwhether PAP-ultimate entails PAP. If it doesn\u2019t, then objections\nto the latter\n (\u00a73)\n needn\u2019t damage the former.\n",
