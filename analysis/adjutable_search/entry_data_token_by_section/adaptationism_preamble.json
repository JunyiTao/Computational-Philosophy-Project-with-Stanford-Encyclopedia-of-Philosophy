    "main_text": "\n\u201cAdaptationism\u201d refers to a family of views about the\nimportance of natural selection in the evolution of organisms, in the\nconstruction of evolutionary explanations, and in defining the goal of\nresearch on evolution.  Advocates of adaptationism or\n\u201cadaptationists\u201d view natural selection among\nindividuals within a population as the only important cause of the evolution\nof a trait; they also typically believe that the construction of\nexplanations based solely on natural selection to be the most fruitful\nway of making progress in evolutionary biology and that this endeavor\naddresses the most important goal of evolutionary biology, which is to\nunderstand the evolution of adaptations. An important alternative\napproach, \u201cpluralism\u201d, invokes historical contingency and\ndevelopmental and genetic constraints, in addition to natural\nselection, as important causes of the evolution of a trait. Advocates\nof pluralism, or \u201cpluralists\u201d often also argue that the\nattempt to construct a natural-selective explanation of a trait is not\nthe most fruitful way to make explanatory progress and that\nunderstanding adaptation is just one of several important questions in\nevolutionary biology. The \u201cdebate\u201d over adaptationism is\ncommonly understood to be the back-and-forth between adaptationists\nand pluralists.\n\n\nBiologists and philosophers have recently made three important\ncontributions that have led to better understanding of this\ndebate. First, they have delineated the differences among various\n\u201cflavors\u201d of adaptationism; this has helped clarify the\nbiological and philosophical stakes of the debate. Second, they have\nclarified standards of evidence for and against adaptationist claims;\nthis provides a clearer understanding of how to structure an empirical\ntest of a claim about natural selection and what implications the\nresults of the test have in regard to adaptationism. This\nclarification has the potential, not yet fully realized, to improve\nboth the practice of science and the philosophical understanding of\nthis practice. Third, there is improved understanding of the potential\nrole of non-selective influences on trait evolution.\n",
