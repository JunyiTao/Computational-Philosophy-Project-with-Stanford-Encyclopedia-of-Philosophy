The Major Problems with Zermelo's System\nZermelo's system, although it forms the root of all modern\naxiomatisations of set theory, initially faced various\ndifficulties. These were: \n\nProblems with the Axiom of Choice.\nProblem with the formulation of the Separation Axiom.\nProblems of \u2018completeness\u2019, one of Hilbert's important desiderata on the adequacy of an axiom system. Specifically, there were problems representing ordinary mathematics purely set-theoretically, and also problems representing fully the transfinite extension of mathematics which Cantor had pioneered.\n\nThe problems concerning the Axiom of Choice were discussed above;\nwe now discuss the difficulties with the formulation of Separation and\nthose of \u2018completeness\u2019.\n",
