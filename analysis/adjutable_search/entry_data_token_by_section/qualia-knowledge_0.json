History of the Underlying Ideas\n\nThe Knowledge Argument became the subject of intense philosophical\ndiscussion following its canonical formulation by Frank Jackson\n(1982). However, there are numerous precursors of this argument in the\nliterature. Precursors of the Knowledge Argument typically involve at\nleast one of two strategies which are familiar from Jackson\u2019s\nformulation. The first is to appeal to what Daniel Stoljar & Yujin\nNagasawa term the knowledge intuition: the intuition that no\namount of knowledge of the physical information or physical facts\nconcerning certain experiences can by itself suffice for knowledge of\nwhat these experiences are like, i.e., knowledge of their qualitative\ncharacter or distinctive qualia (2004, 2\u20133). The second is to\nmake use of thought experiments which are similar to Jackson\u2019s\nfamous example of Mary. These thought-experiments typically involve a\nbeing who has complete knowledge of the physical information or\nphysical facts concerning certain experiences, but who (it is claimed)\nlacks knowledge of what those experiences are like.\n\nAs examples of the knowledge intuition, Stoljar & Nagasawa cite\npassages by Bertrand Russell (1998, 13\u201314) and by J.W. Dunne\n(1929). As Dunne puts it, quoting James Ward, physical descriptions\ncannot entail knowledge of what it is that \u201cyou immediately\nexperience when you look at a field poppy\u201d (1929, 5). Around the\nsame time as Dunne was writing, C.D. Broad (1925) used a\nthought-experiment as part of an argument against a mechanistic\nversion of physicalism. Broad argues that even if the mechanistic\ntheory of chemistry were true there still would be a property of\nammonia that a mathematical archangel endowed with unlimited\nmathematical skills and \u201cgifted with the further power of\nperceiving the microscopic structure of atoms\u201d could not\npredict, namely its smell:\n\nHe [the archangel] would know exactly what the microscopic structure\nof ammonia must be; but he would be totally unable to predict that a\nsubstance with this structure must smell as ammonia does when it gets\ninto the human nose. The utmost that he could predict on this subject\nwould be that certain changes would take place in the mucous membrane,\nthe olfactory nerves and so on. But he could not possibly know that\ntheses changes would be accompanied by the appearance of a smell in\ngeneral or of the peculiar smell of ammonia in particular, unless\nsomeone told him so or he had smelled it for himself (1925,\n 71).[1]\n\n\nUnder the title \u201cThe Cognitive Role of Acquaintance,\u201d H.\nFeigl (1958) briefly discusses the epistemic limitations of a Martian\nwho studies human behavior but does not share human sentiments:\n\nThe first question I wish to discuss concerns the cognitive\n\u2018plus\u2019, i.e., the alleged advantages of knowledge by\nacquaintance over knowledge by description. We may ask, for example,\nwhat does the seeing person know that the congenitally blind person\ncould not know. Or, to take two examples from Eddington, what could a\nsomeone know about the effects of jokes if he had no sense of humor?\nCould a Martian, entirely without sentiments of compassion and piety,\nknow about what is going on during a commemoration of the armistice?\nFor the sake of argument, we assume complete physical predictability\nand explainability of the behavior of humans equipped with vision, a\nsense of humor, and sentiments of piety. The Martian could then\npredict all responses, including the linguistic utterances of the\nearthlings in the situations which involve their visual perceptions,\ntheir laughter about jokes, or their (solemn) behavior at the\ncommemoration. But ex hypothesi, the Martian would be lacking\ncompletely in the sort of imagery and empathy which\ndepends on familiarity (direct acquaintance) with the kinds of\nqualia to be imaged or empathized (1958, 431).\n\n\nB. A. Farrell had earlier presented a similar thought experiment\nfeaturing a Martian; in this version, it is humans who lack knowledge\nof what it is like for the Martian to exercise his sensory capacities\n(1950, 183; though Farrell ultimately argues that this thought\nexperiment does not present a challenge to physicalism). Paul E.\nMeehl, responding to Feigl, describes two individuals who each have\ncomplete neurophysiological knowledge, one of whom is congenitally\nblind; he takes it as intuitive that this person does not know\nsomething which the other does, namely \u201cwhat red looks\nlike\u201d (1966, 151).\n\nMore recent examples from the literature come closer to being versions\nof the Knowledge Argument rather than merely precursors to it. For\nexample, consider the following statement of the knowledge intuition\nby Nicholas Maxwell:\n\nfrom a complete physicalist description alone it would be impossible\nto deduce the perceptual qualities of things, but this is due, not to\nthe fact that things do not really possess perceptual qualities, but\nto the fact that the physicalist description is incomplete: it does\nnot tell us all that there is to know about the world. It does not\ntell us what it is like to be a human being alive and experiencing in\nthe world (1965,\n 309).[2]\n\n\nAnd Howard Robinson, writing the same year as Jackson published\n\u2018Epiphenomenal Qualia\u2019, describes a deaf scientist\n\u201cwho knows everything there is to know about the physical\nprocesses involved in hearing\u201d, but who intuitively does not\nknow what it is like to hear (1982, 4).\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the extremely influential thought\nexperiment described by Thomas Nagel (1974). According to Nagel, the\nphysical facts about an organism and its perceptual systems are\n\u201cobjective facts par excellence \u2013 the kind that\ncan be observed and understood from many points of view and by\nindividuals with differing perceptual systems\u201d (1974, 442).\nNagel argues that even if we knew all the objective facts about a\nbat\u2019s sonar system, we would still not know what it would be like to\nperceive using this system. Therefore, complete knowledge of the\nphysical facts about a bat\u2019s perceptual system would not yield\nknowledge of certain facts about a bat\u2019s experiences; these facts\ncan only be captured from a subjective perspective. Nagel does not\nargue against physicalism, but rather claims that we presently have no\nunderstanding of how it can be true. In Section 4.9, we shall outline\na related approach to the knowledge argument which interprets it as a\nchallenge not to physicalism but to a position called objectivism.\n",
