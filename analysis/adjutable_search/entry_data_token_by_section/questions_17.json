Indeed, Hintikka (1976, Chapter 4) argues that\nknowledge-wh sentences like (37)-(39) are ambiguous between two\nreadings: a universal reading and an existential reading. In the case\nof (37), Hintikka\u2019s two readings are as follows: \n\n (45)  a.\n\\(\\exists x(x\\) is in\nthe closet & John knows that \\(x\\) is in the closet)\n \n   b.\n\\(\\forall x(x\\) is in\nthe closet \\(\\rightarrow\\) John knows that \\(x\\) is in the\ncloset)  \n\n\nKarttunen (1977, 7) disputes the existence of Hintikka\u2019s\nambiguity, but a version of this ambiguity that sets aside the details\nof Hintikka\u2019s analysis of (37) has gained acceptance, namely,\nthe distinction between mention-some and mention-all\nreadings of a question or wh-complement. For example, under a\nmention-some reading of \u2018What is in the closet?\u2019, an\nanswer must mention at least one item, whereas under a mention-all\nreading an answer must mention all items. A perhaps clearer example of\na question for which a mention-some reading is natural is (51), which\nis discussed below in section\n 4.7\n in connection with false-belief sensitivity.\n",
