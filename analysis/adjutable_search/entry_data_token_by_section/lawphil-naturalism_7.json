    "main_text": "Substantive Naturalism || Legal Positivism\n5.3 S-Naturalism, Law, and the Causal Theory of Reference\n\nJust as semantic doctrines more-or-less related to logical positivism\nwere central to the S-naturalism of Scandinavian Realism, the more\nrecent S-naturalism of writers like David Brink, Michael Moore, and\nNicos Stavropoulos is indebted to the revolution in semantics\ninitiated by Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke known as the\n\u201cnew\u201d or \u201ccausal\u201d theory of reference. These\nlatter doctrines are not\u2014yet in any case\u2014museum pieces, so\nthe derived jurisprudential theses are very much live items of debate.\nStavropoulos explains the core semantic ideas on which jurisprudential\nwriters draw as follows:\n\nBoth Kripke and Putnam attack what they call the traditional theory of\nreference. That theory holds that an expression refers to whatever\nfits the description with which speakers associate the expression. The\nrelevant description\u2026captures necessary properties of the\nreferent which are knowable a priori, as in the case of\nknowing that a bachelor is an unmarried man. This cannot be true,\nKripke and Putnam argue, since expressions refer to the same object in\nthe lips of speakers who can only associate the expression with vague\nor mistaken descriptions. Indeed, not only individual speakers but the\ncommunity as a whole can be in error about the true properties of the\nrelevant object. \u2026 The important suggestion being made by\nKripke and Putnam is that reference is object-dependent.\nWhich object \u2018Aristotle\u2019 or \u2018water\u2019\nrefers to is not determined by the associated description, but turns\ninstead on a matter of fact, namely which object the name-using or\nterm-using practice is directed at. (1996, p. 8)\n\n\nThus, if on the old view the \u201cmeaning\u201d of an expression\n(the descriptions speakers associated with it) fixed the reference of\nthe expression, on the new theory, the referent fixes the meaning.\n\u201cWater\u201d picks out whatever stuff we happened to baptize\nwith the name \u201cwater\u201d at the beginning of the\n\u201cterm-using practice.\u201d As it happens, that stuff has a\ndistinctive micro-constitution: it is H20. Thus,\n\u201cwater\u201d refers to stuff that is H20, and that\nis what the term means: the stuff that is H20.\n\nWriters like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos propose that when the\nmeaning of expressions in legal rules\u2014and, in particular, the\nmeaning of the moral concepts (like \u201cequality\u201d) that\nfigure in some legal rules\u2014is understood in the same way, then\nit follows that all rules have determinate applications:\neither the facts do or do not fall within the extension of the meaning\nof the key terms in the rule. The meaning of the rule determines its\napplication, but the meaning is fixed by the real referents\nof the terms in the legal rule. Of course, for this to be a version of\nS-naturalism, the claim must be that the real referents are themselves\nthings cognizable within a naturalistic framework. So, e.g., it\nwould have to be the case that the legal and moral features of\nsituations picked out by our legal concepts (and the moral concepts\nembedded in them) must be identical with (or supervenient upon)\nnatural facts: just as there are necessary, a posteriori\nstatements of property identity about water, so too there are such\nstatements about legal and moral facts. For example, perhaps the\nproperty of being \u201cmorally right\u201d is just identical with\nthe property of \u201cmaximizing human well-being,\u201d where the\nlatter may be understood in purely psychological and physiological\nterms. In that case, whether an action X is morally right is\nsimply a scientific question about whether action X will in\nfact maximize the relevant kinds of psychological and physiological\nstates in the world. (Most naturalistic moral realisms are based on\nversions of utilitarianism, precisely because it is easy to see what\nthe naturalistic base of moral properties would be in a utilitarian\nschema. One peculiar feature of the moral realism of Moore (1992b) is\nthat it is conjoined with a deontological moral theory, yet within a\npurportedly naturalistic moral realist framework.) The crucial claim,\nplainly, is that moral facts are to be identified with (or treated as\nsupervenient upon) certain kinds of natural facts. Of course, many\nphilosophers are skeptical that this claim can be made out.\n\nProblems arise at several different levels with this more recent\nS-naturalism, though all are traceable to the reliance on the new\ntheory of reference. To begin, there are familiar reasons to be\nskeptical about whether the new theory of reference is correct,\nreasons that won\u2019t be rehearsed here (see, e.g., Evans 1973,\nBlackburn 1988). Even granting, however, the correctness of the new\ntheory, it is not obvious how it helps in the case of law. After all,\nthe new theory always seemed most plausible for a limited class of\nexpressions: proper names and natural kind terms. The reason has to do\nwith the implicit essentialism required for the new theory: unless\nreferents have essential characteristics\u2014just as\n\u201cwater\u201d has a distinctive and essential molecular\nconstitution\u2014they cannot fix meanings. But what is the essence\nof \u201cdue process\u201d or \u201cequal protection?\u201d And\nwhat is the \u201cessential\u201d nature of the many artifact terms\nthat populate legal rules (terms like \u201ccontract\u201d or\n\u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201csecurity interest\u201d)?\nUnsurprisingly, S-naturalists like Brink and Moore are also moral\nrealists, and also try to give accounts of artifact terms as picking\nout not \u201cnatural kinds\u201d but \u201cfunctional kinds\u201d\n(Moore 1992a, pp. 207\u2013208).\n\nOf course, even if the new theory of reference gives the correct\naccount of the meaning of some terms (like natural kind terms), that\nstill does not show that it gives us the right account of meaning for\npurposes of legal interpretation (cf. Munzer 1985). Suppose the\nlegislature prohibits the killing of \u201cfish\u201d within 100\nmiles of the coast, intending quite clearly (as the legislative\nhistory reveals) to protect whales, but not realizing that\n\u201cfish\u201d is a natural kind term that does not include whales\nwithin its extension. The new theory of reference tells us that the\nstatute protects sea bass but not whales, yet surely a court that\ninterpreted the statute as also protecting whales would not be making\na mistake. Indeed, one might think the reverse is true: for a court\nnot to protect whales would be to contravene the will of the\nlegislature, and thus, indirectly, the will of the people. What the\nexample suggests is that the correct theory of legal interpretation is\nnot a mere matter of philosophical semantics: issues about\npolitical legitimacy\u2014about the conditions under which\nthe exercise of coercive power by courts can be justified\u2014must\ninform theories of legal interpretation, and such considerations may\neven trump considerations of semantics.\n",
