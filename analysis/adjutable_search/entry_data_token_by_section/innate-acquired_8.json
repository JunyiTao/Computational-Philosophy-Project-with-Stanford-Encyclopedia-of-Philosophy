    "main_text": "Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates || A matter of explanatory emphasis\n2.1 A matter of explanatory emphasis\n\nOne possible reason for the persistence of scientific debates over\nnativism is that researchers approach psychological development with\ndifferent explanatory interests. This idea was defended by Peter\nGodfrey-Smith (1996), who distinguished between\n\u201cexternalist\u201d and \u201cinternalist\u201d modes of\nexplanation in biology generally. Externalists \u201cexplain\nproperties of organic systems in terms of properties of their\nenvironments\u201d; whereas internalists explain, \u201cone set of\norganic properties in terms of the other internal or intrinsic\nproperties of the organic system\u201d (1996, 30 quoted in Cowie\n1998, 16). Nativism can be viewed as an internalist mode of\nexplanation in that it focuses on internal (e.g. genetic)\ncontributions to development while setting aside environmental\ninfluences. Conversely, anti-nativists like Kuo or Lehrman focus on\ncertain \u201cexternal\u201d (e.g. environmental) factors. On this\nview, the two approaches are not in conflict. Ultimately, it comes\ndown to the interests of an investigator where to place explanatory\nemphasis.\n\nIf this analysis is correct, then the resolution of debates over\nnativism should be straightforward. It should be sufficient to point\nout that the two perspectives are complementary: that both\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d factors contribute\nto development. The problem with this analysis, however, is that it\nthreatens to trivialize the debate. Could it really be the case that\nsuch intellectual heavyweights as Lorenz and Lehrman were engaged in\nnothing more than a verbal dispute? Fiona Cowie (1998), for one, sees\nthis as a red flag. Although verbal disputes are not unheard of in\nscience and philosophy it is uncharitable to assume that all\nhistorical debates over nativism can be understood so simplistically.\nAs Cowie puts it, \u201c[v]iewing nativists and empiricists as\nquarreling merely over how \u2018important\u2019 the various factors\nin belief and concept acquisition are can incline us to see their\ndispute as insubstantial\u201d (1998, 22). We are well advised, she\nargues, to search for more substantial stakes in these debates.\n\nMore recently, James Tabery (2014) has developed an account of the\n\u201cinteraction debates\u201d (as he calls them) which also places\nexplanatory interests at the center of the disagreement. Tabery\nidentifies two general scientific approaches to the interaction\nbetween nature and nurture. So called \u201cvariation\npartitioners\u201d understand interaction in statistical terms. Their\nexplanatory aim is to identify the amount of actual variation\nexhibited by some phenotype that can be attributed to additive genetic\nvariance and environmental factors, respectively. A sharp distinction\nbetween innate versus acquired traits is central to this approach. By\ncontrast, Tabery\u2019s \u201cmechanism elucidators\u201d are\nprimarily interested in describing the developmental mechanisms\ngenerating particular phenotypes. These researchers understand\n\u201cinteraction\u201d in causal terms and tend to see little value\nin a sharp innate/acquired distinction.\n\nPhilosophers Slobodan Perovic and Ljiljana Radenovic (2011) have also\nsuggested that nativism/empiricism controversies might be dissolved by\nidentifying the different explanatory interests of the disputants.\nThey focus on the dispute between neo-nativist psychologists who see\nthemselves as heirs to Chomsky\u2019s linguistic nativism (Section\n1.5) and the intellectual descendants of anti-nativist developmental\npsychologists (Section 2.4) who believe that the distinction between\ninnate and acquired behavior is meaningless and that explaining\noutcomes of development by calling them \u2018innate\u2019 is\nscientifically vacuous (e.g. Oyama 1985; Ford and Lerner 1992; Michel\nand Moore 1995). According to Perovic & Radenovic these\nanti-nativists or \u2018developmental systems theorists\u2019 target\nneo-nativist claims about the pattern of gene-environment interaction\nin the development of cognition and behavior. Neo-nativists claim that\nthe pattern is maturational, with genes as specific causes and\nenvironmental factors as merely \u201cpermissive\u201d causes\n(Holtzer 1968). This is a fundamentally internalist form of\nexplanation, with external, environmental factors as mere background\nconditions and internal, genetic factors doing the real explanatory\nwork. However, while neo-nativist psychologists do make such claims,\nthey do not typically examine the developmental genetics of the traits\nwhich they claim are \u2018innate\u2019 (Gary Marcus (2004) is one\nimportant exception). Instead, their research examines specific stages\nin psychological development, often well into the life of the\nindividual, and specific environmental factors which might be thought\nto influence development at those stages. Their experiments aim to\nshow that the developmental outcome at such a stage is not\nspecifically influenced by the details of the environment, but instead\nfollows a pathway determined by internal cognitive structures. In one\nfamous body of research, children make an \u2018intellectual\nbreakthrough\u2019 at around age four when they come to properly\nunderstand the whole body of kinship terms in their local language,\nrather than treating categories like \u2018uncle\u2019 as defined by\nthe pattern of resemblance between uncles (Keil 1989). The fact that\nthis happens all at once, at around the same age, and despite a great\ndeal of variation in the specific kinship systems that children are\nlearning, supports the view that this transition is the result of an\ninternal, maturational change. While an environment of kinship\nstructures and kinship terms is needed, it functions as a merely\npermissive or background condition. The explanatory work is done by\nthe internal factors.\n\nPerovic & Radenovic (2011) point out that this claim about the\ncausal structure of development in a particular, late developmental\nstage is entirely compatible with the strongly interactionist view of\nhow genes and environment build the brain favoured by developmental\nsystems theorists. They suggest that neo-nativism is primarily\nconcerned to show that how organisms respond to their environments\ndepends strongly on cognitive structure that is in place before the\norganism encounters that environment. Conversely, anti-nativists are\nprimarily concerned to show that environments often play a specific,\ninstructive role in the development of cognitive structures. Since the\ntwo schools do such different research, the latter primarily focused\non human development post-partum and well into childhood, and the\nformer on early development, often in animal models for reasons of\nethical and experimental tractability, there is considerable scope for\naccounts of psychological development that draw on both perspectives\nat different stages of development. So, once again, on this account\ndisputes about nativism are fundamentally a reflection of scientists\ndifferent explanatory interests.\n",
