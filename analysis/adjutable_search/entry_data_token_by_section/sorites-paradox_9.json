    "main_text": "Philosophical Lessons || Meaning as Use\n5.1 Meaning as Use\n\nA challenge posed for the epistemic theorist\u2019s response is that on\nsuch a view the commonly supposed connection between meaning and use\nappears to be strained if not severed altogether (see again\n \u00a73.2).\n While the margin-for-error principle discussed in Williamson 1994a\nmight serve to explain how we could be ignorant of the postulated\nsharp boundaries, it might be thought that since our use of vague\nterms does not draw sharp boundaries, it could not contain them given\nthe generally accepted connection between meaning and use. As\nWilliamson reports this concern others might have, \u201cthe\nepistemic view of vagueness sets truth-conditions floating\nunacceptably free of our dispositions to assent and dissent\u201d\n(1994a: 205). It seems that such a view must abandon the idea that our\nuse determines meaning.\n\nOne obvious response is that the connection between meaning and use is\nnot as strong as might be supposed. Nature might also sometimes play a\nrole in determining meaning, e.g., in the case of natural kind terms;\nbut for a predicate like, say, \u2018thin\u2019, it is unlikely that\nnature provides what our use does not. Williamson further responds by\npointing out that the determination thesis at issue is really a\nsupervenience thesis\u2014meaning supervenes on use\u2014and this\nthesis can be agreed to by epistemicists. Granted, the epistemicist\ncannot say exactly how meaning supervenes on use, and so cannot\ncalculate the meaning or truth-conditions of an application of a vague\nterm from facts about use. However, the response continues, this\ninability is something which all theorists ought to accept. To suppose\nthat the epistemic theory must make good on this count is to place\nunreasonable expectations on the theory (see Williamson 1996 and\nBurgess 2001 for further discussion). \n\nThe supervenience thesis is also challenged by symmetry\nconsiderations. When confronted with a borderline case of\n\u2018thin\u2019, the argument goes, a language user will neither\nassent to the application of the term nor to the application of its\nnegation. Patterns of dissent are similarly symmetrical with respect to the two \nclaims.[11] \nAnd yet despite this symmetry at the level of use\nit must be broken at the level of truth and falsity where one of the\nterms or its negation truly applies according to the theory; one or\nthe other claim is true and the other false. If our patterns of use\nleave the matter equally unsettled either way then how can the truth\nof the matter be settled without arbitrariness and a severing of the\nconnection between meaning and use? The answer, Williamson suggests,\nlies in the fact that truth and falsity are not symmetrical notions.\nFalsity obtains in the absence of truth, so where there is symmetry at\nthe level of use, falsity reigns. Whether this response succeeds is\ndebated in Burgess 2001 and Weatherson 2003.\n",
