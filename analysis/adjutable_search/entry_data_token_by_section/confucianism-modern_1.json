Modernity and Tradition\n\nThe questions of how China should approach modernization and what\nremains valuable in Chinese tradition were crucial ones for modern\nConfucian philosophers. All of them lived through massive upheavals in\ntheir world: the fall of the imperial government, the failure of the\nfirst Republican government, the Japanese invasion, and the Communist\ntakeover of China. The worlds of their formative and later years were\nwildly different. Attacks on traditional culture increased over the\nearly twentieth century, spearheaded by intellectuals such as Chen\nDuxiu (a founder of the Chinese Communist Party) and Hu Shi (Republic\nof China ambassador to the US and an influential figure in Chinese\nliberalism). All of these four figures address to some extent the\nquestion of how to modernize while preserving the valuable features of\nChinese traditions, and further, to justify the positive aspects of\nmodernity through autochthonic values (Marchal 2016: 221; Schmidt\n2011: 275\u201383). They were also strongly critical of aspects of\nWestern culture, which they tended to identify with modernity.\n\nThe relatively greater success of Japan to modernize while the Chinese\nrevolution failed to produce a stable government or a strong state led\nto serious reflection. Mou, Tang, and Xu all wrote on where things\nwent wrong, and why Chinese culture had failed to develop some of the\nkey features of modernity such as science and democracy. They were\ngreat admirers of these achievements, as well as other aspects of\nmodern life such as specialized academic fields, equality and human\nrights, and greater individual freedoms. At the same time, they did\nnot endorse all of Western modernity. They understandably condemned\nimperialism and colonialism (even as all three resided at times in the\nBritish colony of Hong Kong), and they found modern Western culture\nspiritually and morally lacking. While attempting to understand where\nChinese culture had gone wrong, they also diagnosed what they saw as\nthe ills of Western culture (which they often discussed without much\nregard to the distinctions between different nations or cultures).\n",
