    "main_text": "Mechanical properties || Classical mechanical supertasks\n1.4 Classical mechanical supertasks\n\nThe discussions of supertasks so far suggest that the possibility of\nsupertasks is not so much a matter of logical possibility as it is\n\u201cphysical possibility.\u201d But what does \u201cphysical\npossibility\u201d mean? One natural interpretation is that it means,\n\u201cpossible according to some laws of physics.\u201d Thus, we can\nmake the question of whether supertasks are possible more precise by\nasking, for example, whether supertasks compatible with the laws of\nclassical particle mechanics.\n\nEarman and Norton\u2019s (1996) bouncing ball provides one indication that\nthe answer is yes. Another particularly simple example was introduced\nby P\u00e9rez Laraudogoita (1996, 1998), which goes as follows.\n\nSuppose an infinite lattice of particles of the same mass are arranged\nso that there is a distance of \u00bd between the first and the\nsecond, a distance of \u00bc between the second and the third, a\ndistance of \u215b between the third and the fourth, and so on. Now\nimagine that a new particle of the same mass collides with the first\nparticle in the lattice, as in Figure 1.4.1. If it is a perfectly\nelastic collision, then the incoming particle will come to rest and\nthe velocity will be transferred to the struck particle. Suppose it\ntakes \u00bd of a second for the second collision to occur. Then it\nwill take \u00bc of a second for the third to occur, \u215b of a\nsecond for the fourth, and so on. The entire infinite process will\nthus be completed after 1 second.\n\n\nFig 1.4.1.\nJon P\u00e9rez Laraudogoita\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Supertask\u2019\n\n\nEarman and Norton (1998) observed several curious facts about this\nsystem. First, unlike Thomson\u2019s lamp, this supertask does not require\nunbounded speeds. The total velocity of the system is never any more\nthan the velocity of the original moving particle. Second, this\nsupertask takes place in a bounded region of space. So, there are no\nboundary conditions \u201cat infinity\u201d that can rule out the\nsupertask. Third, although energy is conserved in each local\ncollision, the global energy of this system is not conserved, since\nafter finite time it becomes a lattice of infinitely many particles\nall at rest. Finally, the supertask depends crucially on there being\nan infinite number of particles, and the width of these particles must\nshrink without bound while keeping the mass fixed. This means the mass\ndensity of the particles must grow without bound. The failure of\nglobal energy conservation and other curious features of this system\nhave been studied by Atkinson (2007, 2008), Atkinson and Johnson\n(2009, 2010) and by Peijnenburg and Atkinson (2008) and Atkinson and\nPeijnenburg (2014).\n\nAnother kind of classical mechanical supertask was described by\nP\u00e9rez Laraudogoita (1997). Consider again the infinite lattice\nof particles of the same mass, but this time suppose that the first\nparticle is motionless, that the second particle is headed towards the\nfirst with some velocity, and that the velocity of each successive\nparticle doubles (Figure 1.4.2). The first collision sets the first\nparticle in motion. But a later collision then sets it moving faster,\nand a later collision even faster, and so on.\n\n\nFig 1.4.2.\nA supertask that relies on unbounded speed.\n\n\nIt is not hard to arrange this situation so that the first collision\nhappens after \u00bd of a second, the second collision after\n\u00bc of a second, the third after \u215b of a second, and so on\n(P\u00e9rez Laraudogoita 1997). So again we have a supertask that is\ncompleted after one second.\n\nWhat is the result of this supertask? Their answer is that none of the\nparticles remain in space. They cannot be anywhere in space, since for\neach horizontal position that a given particle can occupy there is a\ntime before 1 second that it is pushed out of that position by a\ncollision. The worldline of any one of the particles from this\nsupertask can be illustrated using Figure 1.4.3. This is what Malament\n(2008, 2009) has referred to as a \u201cspace evader\u201d\ntrajectory. The time-reversed \u201cspace invader\u201d trajectory\nis one in which the vacuum is spontaneously populated with particles\nafter some fixed time.\n\n\nFig 1.4.3. Worldline of the supertask particle.\n\n\nEarman and Norton (1998) gave some variations on this supertask,\nincluding one which occurs in a bounded region in space. Unlike the\nexample of P\u00e9rez Laraudogoita (1996), this supertask also\nessentially requires particles to be accelerated to arbitrarily high\nspeeds, and in this sense is essentially non-relativistic. See\nP\u00e9rez Laraudogoita (1999) for a rejoinder.\n\nThis supertask is modeled on an example of Benardete (1964), who\nconsidered a space ship that successively doubles its speed until it\nescapes to spatial infinity. Supertasks of this kind were also studied\nby physicists like Lanford (1975, \u00a74), who identified a system of\nparticles colliding elastically that can undergo an infinite number of\ncollisions in finite time. Mather and McGehee (1975) pointed out a\nsimilar example. Earman (1986) discussed the curious behavior of\nLanford\u2019s example as well, pointing out that such supertasks provide\nexamples of classical indeterminism, but can be eliminated by\nrestricting to finitely many particles or by imposing appropriate\nboundary conditions.\n",
