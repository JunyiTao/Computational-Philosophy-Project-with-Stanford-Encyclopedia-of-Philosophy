    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction || How Heidegger Understands Aesthetics\n2.1 How Heidegger Understands Aesthetics\n\n\nAs Heidegger points out, the term \u201caesthetics\u201d is a\nmodern creation. It was coined by Alexander Baumgarten in the\n1750s and then critically appropriated by Kant in his Critique of\nJudgment (published in\n 1790).[13]\nBaumgarten formed the term\n\u201caesthetics\u201d from the Greek word for\n\u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling,\u201d\naisth\u00easis (N1 83/GA43 98). As this indicates,\nmodern \u201caesthetics\u201d was originally conceived as the science\nof aisth\u00eata, matters perceptible by the senses, as\nopposed to no\u00eama, matters accessible to thought alone,\nlike the truths dealt with in mathematical logic. In fact, modern\naesthetics is born of the aspiration to be \u201cin the field of\nsensuousness what logic is in the domain of thinking\u201d (N1 83/GA43\n98). That is, just as logic (conceived as the science of thought)\nseeks to understand our relation to the true, so aesthetics (conceived\nas the science of sensation or feeling) seeks to understand our\nrelation to the\n beautiful.[14]\n\n\nTo recognize that the central focus of modern aesthetics is beauty\nis not to deny its traditional interest in the sublime or its\nlate-modern preoccupations with the abject, the obscene, kitsch, and so\non. Heidegger\u2019s point, rather, is that\n\n\naesthetics is that kind of meditation on art in which\nhumanity\u2019s state of feeling in relation to the beautiful\nrepresented in art is the point of departure and the goal that sets the\nstandard for all its definitions and explanations. (N1 78/GA43\n91)\n\n\nIn its paradigmatic form (the form \u201cthat sets the\nstandard\u201d for all its other \u201cdefinitions and\nexplanations\u201d), modern \u201caesthetics is the consideration of\nhumanity\u2019s state of feeling in relation to the beautiful\u201d\n(N1 78/GA43 90).\n\n\nHeidegger is not denying that there are numerous disagreements\nwithin the modern aesthetic tradition (between Kant and Baumgarten,\njust to begin with). Instead, his thesis is that even the\ndisagreements in the modern aesthetic tradition take place within the\nframework of a common approach. It is this shared framework that\nHeidegger designates when he refers to the \u201caesthetic\u201d\napproach to art. As we would expect, this basic framework\nundergirds the paradigmatic inquiry of modern aesthetics, the study of\nbeauty through a \u201cconsideration of humanity\u2019s state of\nfeeling in relation to the beautiful.\u201d In all the aesthetic\ninvestigations which take their cues from this one, Heidegger\nobserves:\n\n\nThe artwork is posited as the \u201cobject\u201d for a\n\u201csubject,\u201d and this subject-object relation, specifically\nas a relation of feeling, is definitive for aesthetic\nconsideration. (N1 78/GA43 91)\n\n\nIn other words, modern aesthetics frames its understanding of art by\npresupposing the subject/object dichotomy: Aesthetics presupposes\na fundamental divide between the art \u201cobject\u201d and the\nexperiencing \u201csubject,\u201d a divide which is subsequently\ncrossed by the commerce of sensation or feeling. Of course, the\nsubject/object dichotomy forms the very basis of the modern worldview,\nso we would be surprised if modern aesthetics did not presuppose\nit. So, what specifically does Heidegger object to about the way\nthe aesthetic approach to art presupposes a viewing subject, standing\nbefore some art object, enjoying (or not enjoying) his or her sensory\nexperience of this artwork? What is supposed to be the problem\nwith this aesthetic picture of art?\n",
