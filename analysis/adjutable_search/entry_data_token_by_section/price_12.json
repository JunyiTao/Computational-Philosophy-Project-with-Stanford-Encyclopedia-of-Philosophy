    "main_text": "Perception || Price\u2019s Theory of Sense-Data & their Relations\n3.6 Price\u2019s Theory of Sense-Data & their Relations\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 8) analyses \u201cbelonging to\u201d, the phrase he\nuses for the relation between a sense-datum s which is sensed\nand an object M where sensing s amounts to perceiving\nM. Here and now you are seeing a screen and you are sensing a\nsense-datum which therefore \u201cbelongs to\u201d the screen. He\nseems initially to want an analysis of what is involved in a\nsense-datum (the sensed one) being a member of a group of sense-data\nwhich has a relation to M. We are to envisage, say, walking\ntowards a table and what the evolving sequence of sense-data would be.\nVery roughly, there would be what Price calls a gradual transformation\nin the successive sense-data \u201cin respect of colour, shape, size,\nand position in the field of view\u201d (1932: 208). His central\ninsight is that, as we might put it, moving towards and around the\nobject M, certain groups of sense-data constitute a\nthree-dimensional solid shape (1932: 217\u2013229).\n\nBut how are material things that occupy the spatial world related to\nthis system of families of sense-data (1932: ch. 9)? First, Price\nrejects phenomenalism, which identifies material things with these\nfamilies (1932: 275\u2013282). His basic objection is that material\nthings occupy space and are present, often doing things, such as\nreflecting light or deflecting air, etc. But according to\nphenomenalism, all the presence of the family comes down to is that\nsense-data would be sensed if things were different. Clearly this sort\nof fact cannot itself deflect light rays. Price, therefore, has to\nrecognise \u201ctwo distinct\u201d entities (1932: 293). There is\nthe \u201cfamily\u201d of actual and obtainable sense-data\nand the physical object. Price claims that we are ignorant of\nthe intrinsic nature of the physical objects themselves and have to\nconceptualise them as bearers of causal powers (1932: 294\u2013300;\nalso 1927: 110). A table, for instance, is a \u201cfamily [viz. of\nsensibilia] together with the physical object which is coincident with\nit\u201d (1932: 301). His analysis of when a sense-datum s\nbelongs to an external object M is this:\n\n(1)\ns is a member of a family of sense-data F,\n(2)\nthere is a physical occupant O with which F is\ncoincident,\n(3)\nM consists of F and O in conjunction.\n\n\nIt is unclear exactly what \u201ccoincidence\u201d strictly means.\nFor instance, O and F, according to Price (1932: 252),\ncannot have the same position in space for the sense in which F\nhas a position in space is radically different from the sense in which\nO does. \n\nFinally, when considering the causal origins of sense-data, Price\ncontrasts (i) \u201cvertical\u201d causation, the causal process of\nsense-data genesis, with (ii) \u201chorizontal\u201d causation,\nother causal interactions between things in the world. Price claims\nthat our basic knowledge of objects does not depend on or presuppose\nour belief in vertical causation. Rather, we attain knowledge of\nvertical causation from already established knowledge of objects\n(1932: 311\u2013313 sketches this knowledge-acquisition). He\nconsiders this an objection to the causal theory of perception. But it\nis so only if that theory is defined as requiring that our basic,\nworldly knowledge is based on causal reasoning, which need not be\ncoupled with a causal model of perception.\n\nPrice also argues that phenomenalism cannot accommodate real vertical\ncausation by physical objects as they understand them. Idealists and\nphenomenalists, however, would generally agree and look for other\nexplanations of experience (e.g., God). The real causal generators in\nthe external world are, Price argues, not the complex two-component\nthings, which he previously (1932: ch. 8) claimed corresponded to our\nconception of material things, but, rather, are the real physical\noccupants with their causal powers. He writes: \u201csense-data are\ncausally dependent on the states and the changes of physical\noccupants\u201d (1932: 319). Price avoids confronting the natural\nquestion as to where this leaves the idea that material things cannot\nbe identified with the physical occupants, since, it now seems,\neverything that an external thing does will be done by the physical\noccupant. \n\nPrice ends up with a form of dualism, with physical occupants and\nthings of another sort which house sense-data occurrences, whose\nnature is radically under-described. For he claims that the events\nwhich are the occurrences of sense-data cannot themselves be events in\nthe physical occupants. So, strikingly, he defends a conception of\nobjects as two-sided compounds of a physical occupant of space with\ncausal properties and a family of sensibilia.\n",
