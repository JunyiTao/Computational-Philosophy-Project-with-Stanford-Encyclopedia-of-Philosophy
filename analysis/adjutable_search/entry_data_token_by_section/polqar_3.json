    "main_text": "Polqar and Abner of Burgos: Judaism vs. Christianity || The Authority of the Talmud and the Jewish Sages\n2.2 The Authority of the Talmud and the Jewish Sages\n\nIn Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, Abner consistently uses Jewish\nsources in order to prove that the doctrines of the Christian faith\nare true. He aims to show that although the Jews of his own time\nreject Christianity altogether, the Talmudic Sages, upon whom they\nrely, tacitly accepted Christianity\u2019s fundamental beliefs. Once\nagain, this topic is omitted in Teshuvat Apikoros; however,\nPolqar devotes two different chapters in \u02bfEzer ha-Dat to\nillustrating the erroneous use the Christians made of these texts.\n\nIn his Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, Abner discusses rabbinic\ntexts in extensive detail. When it suits his purposes, he cites\nrabbinic texts to show that the Talmudic Sages did, in fact, accept\nChristian doctrines; however, they could not disclose them to the\npeople, who were not ready to accept these beliefs (cf. Teshuvot\nla-Me\u1e25aref: 15b; 16b; 17a; 18ab). In other cases, Abner\naccuses the Jewish Sages of behaving unethically (Ibid: 33b; 34b). In\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat, Polqar does not offer a detailed response\nto Abner\u2019s hermeneutical attacks. Instead, he proposes a general\nsolution that clarifies the role of the Talmud and the significance of\nthe rabbinic texts.\n\nThe closing sections of treatise one in \u02bfEzerha-Dat\nexemplifies Polqar\u2019s threefold method. Firstly, he sets forth\nthe importance of the Oral Law, which is necessary for filling out the\nwritten law. While the Written Torah only sketches out the general\nfeatures of the law, the Oral Law explains in detail how man should\ninterpret and apply that law. Secondly, he narrates the historical\nevents that led Rabina and Rav Ashi, the two Amoraic sages who\ncompiled and revised the Babylonian Talmud, to write down the Oral\nLaw: the exile and the great risk of losing Talmudic foundations,\nrulings, and\n interpretations.[11]\n Thirdly, Polqar proclaims that the Talmud has many layers of meaning;\nsome assertions must be taken at face value, while other must be\nunderstood in an esoteric sense.\n\nIn addition to the Talmud, Polqar lists other texts that were written\nby the Jewish Sages but cannot be considered \u201cTalmud\u201d,\nsince this word refers only to the rabbinic interpretations of the\ncommandments. Because these texts are only of an aggadic and not a\nhalakhic nature, they do not possess any intrinsic authority, but have\nvalue only if they accord with or can be interpreted to accord with\nfundamental philosophical\n principles.[12]\n\nPolqar argues forcefully, in a general fashion, that all of\nAbner\u2019s allegations are, in principle, invalid. Polqar lists two\nmain justifications for his wholesale rejection of Abner\u2019s\nallegations. Firstly, according to Polqar, if rabbinic passages\ncontradict fundamental philosophical principles, then they should be\nviewed as non-halakhic midrashic texts. Insofar as all the quotations\nthat Abner uses in Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref are not\nconsidered \u201cLaw\u201d, we need not accept the conclusions drawn\nfrom them. He writes:\n\n\nMoreover, look at the confusion of your thought in your dependence\nupon a few legends of the Talmud that one cannot explain and take in\nany manner one wishes. Even if they are elucidated and explained\ncorrectly according to your opinion, they are (just) the teachings of\nindividuals, on account of which we will not turn aside or deviate in\nany direction from the belief in the Torah of Moses, may peace be upon\nhim. They do not suffice for Jews, since he [Moses] was the master of\nall the prophets and the Sages, according to the belief of all the\nnations. All the more so (they do not suffice) for negating and\noverturning [the Torah]. (Teshuvat Apikoros: 6b)\n\n\nNot only are we not obliged to accept the sources cited by Abner,\nbut\u2014and this is Polqar\u2019s second reason for dismissing\nAbner\u2019s claims\u2014Abner\u2019s reading of these sources,\naccording to Polqar, is tendentious. Abner deliberately reads these\npassages so that they cohere with his line of thought, without\nconsidering the possibility of other interpretations.\n\nIn the process of invalidating Abner\u2019s use of the Talmudic\npassages, Polqar reveals his view of the hierarchy of Jewish sources.\nNaturally, he ranks the \u201cTorah of Moses\u201d as the highest\nsource. Unlike the Sages of the Talmud, whose legal teachings are\nincumbent only upon Jews, the Torah of Moses offers fundamental\nuniversal truths accepted by both Judaism and Christianity.\n\nPolqar concludes his discussion regarding the Talmudic Sages by\nrejecting the opinions of the heretics (epikursin) who mock\nand deny the veracity of some of the Talmudic stories,\ninterpretations, and rulings [\u02bfEzerha-Dat: 65\u201367].\nThe Talmud is a source of knowledge for two types of students: the\nfirst is intelligent, perceptive, and a quick learner, while the\nsecond has a limited understanding, and therefore depends on\ntraditional knowledge without developing the urge to discover its\nprofound meanings. The Talmudic Sages, Polqar maintains, deliberately\nincluded popular knowledge in their teachings as a pathway for the\nsecond type of student, so that he, too, could have a part in true\nknowledge.\n\nThe Sages\u2019 goal was to provide each student with knowledge that\nsuited his abilities. The perceptive disciple grasps the true meaning\nthat will, eventually, lead him to the ultimate goal: the eternity of\nhis soul. The other disciple remains at a lower level of attaining\nknowledge, and is guided by the Sages for educational purposes\nonly.\n",
