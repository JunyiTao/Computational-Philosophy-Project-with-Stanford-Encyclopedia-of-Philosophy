    "main_text": "Arguments for Propositions || One over Many\n4.1 One over Many\n\nOne familiar argument for propositions appeals to commonalities\nbetween beliefs, utterances, or sentences, and infers a common entity.\nThus, it has been suggested, less in print perhaps than in\nconversation, that propositions are needed to play the role of being\nwhat synonymous sentences have in common, what a sentence and its\ntranslation into another language have in common, etc.\n\nArguments of this sort are typically met with the following reply:\ncommonalities do not necessarily require common relations to a single\nentity. Two red things have something in common, in that they are both\nred, but it does not follow that they bear a common relation\nto a single entity, the universal of redness. Similarly, two\nsentences, in virtue of being synonymous, can be said to have\nsomething in common, but that fact alone does not entail they are\ncommonly related to a proposition. When a relation \\(R\\) is symmetric\nand reflexive with respect to a certain domain, it may be useful to\nspeak of the things in the domain which bear \\(R\\) to one another as\n\u201chaving something in common\u201d, but nothing of ontological\nsignificance follows. Thus, the conclusion is drawn: we need an\nargument for thinking that commonalities require common relations to a\nsingle entity.\n",
