    "main_text": "Self-Respect || The concept of self-respect\n4.1 The concept of self-respect\n\nSelf-respect is a form of self-regard, a moral relation of persons\n(and only persons) to themselves that concerns their own important\nworth. Self-respect is thus essentially a valuing form of respect. It\nis, moreover, a normative stance--it is due regard for\noneself, proper regard for the dignity of one\u2019s person\nor position (as the O.E.D. puts it). Like respect for others,\nself-respect is a complex of multilayered and interpenetrating\nphenomena; it involves all those aspects of cognition, valuation,\naffect, expectation, motivation, action, and reaction that compose a\nmode of being in the world at the heart of which is an appropriate\nappreciation of oneself as having significant worth. Unlike some forms\nof respect, self-respect is not something one has only now and again\nor that might have no effect on its object. Rather, self-respect has\nto do with the structure and attunement of an individual\u2019s\nidentity and of her life, and it reverberates throughout the self,\naffecting the configuration and constitution of the person\u2019s\nthoughts, desires, values, emotions, commitments, dispositions, and\nactions. As expressing or constituting one\u2019s sense of worth, it\nincludes an engaged understanding of one\u2019s worth, as well as a\ndesire and disposition to protect and preserve it. Accounts of\nself-respect differ in their characterizations of the beliefs,\ndesires, affects, and behaviors that are constitutive of it, chiefly\nbecause of differences concerning both the aspects or conception of\nthe self insofar as it is the object of one\u2019s respect and also\nthe nature and grounds of the worth of the self or aspects of the\nself.\n\nMost theorists agree that as there are different kinds of respect, so\nthere are different kinds of self-respect. However, we clearly cannot\napply all kinds of respect to ourselves: it makes no sense to talk of\ndirective respect for oneself, for instance, and although one might\nregard oneself or some of one\u2019s characteristics as obstacles\n(\u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy\u201d), this would not generally\nbe considered a form of self-respect. Because the notion of self-worth\nis the organizing motif for self-respect, and because in the dominant\nWestern tradition two kinds of worth are ascribed to persons, two\nkinds of self-respect can be distinguished.\n\nOne way of expressing the distinction is to focus on the kinds of\nself-worth around which it is oriented. One kind of worth has to do\nwith what the individual is: occupant of a social role, member of a\ncertain class, group, or people, someone with a certain place in a\nsocial hierarchy, or simply a human person. Kantian dignity is one\nform, but not the only form, of this kind of worth. Such status- or\nidentity-grounded worth entails both entitlements to due treatment\nfrom others and responsibilities for the individual in virtue of being\nthe kind of thing that is rightly the object of respect.\nRecognition self-respect centers on this kind of worth. (Bird\ncalls this \u201centitlement self-respect\u201d (Bird 2010);\nSchemmel calls it \u201cstanding self-respect\u201d (Schemmel\n2019)). The censuring question, \u201cHave you no\nself-respect?\u201d, the phrase \u201cNo self-respecting person\nwould ...,\u201d and the idea that everyone has a right to\nself-respect concern recognition self-respect. Another kind of\nself-respect depends not on what one is but on the kind of person one\nis making of oneself, on the extent to which one\u2019s character and\nconduct meet standards of worthiness. Evaluative self-respect\nhas to do with this second kind of worth, an acquired worth that we\ncan call \u201cmerit,\u201d which is based on the quality of\none\u2019s character and conduct. (Darwall (1997) calls this\n\u201cappraisal self-respect\u201d; Bird and Schemmel call it\n\u201cstandards self-respect,\u201d since merit is a function of the\nstandards to which one holds oneself and by which one evaluates or\nappraises oneself.) We earn or lose merit, and so deserve or\ndon\u2019t deserve evaluative self-respect, through what we do or\nbecome. Although they are different, recognition self-respect and\nevaluative self-respect are related. The former involves, among other\nthings, recognizing certain norms as entailed by one\u2019s\nidentity-based worth and valuing oneself appropriately by striving to\nlive in accord with them. The latter involves regarding oneself as\nhaving merit because one is or is becoming the kind of person who does\nlive in accord with what one regards as appropriate norms or\nstandards.\n\nIndividuals have numerous identities and so worth bases for different\nforms of recognition self-respect. While self-respect based on\none\u2019s social role or position can be quite important to the\nindividual and how she lives her life as a self-respecting chef,\nrabbi, mother, teacher, Hindu, or member of the aristocracy, most\nphilosophical discussions, heavily influenced by Kant, focus on\ndignity-based respect for oneself as a person, that is, on moral\nrecognition self-respect. Recognition respect for oneself as a person,\nthen, involves living in light of an understanding and appreciation of\noneself as having dignity and moral status just in virtue of being a\nperson, and of the moral constraints that arise from that dignity and\nstatus. All persons are morally obligated or entitled to have this\nkind of self-respect. Because the dominant Kantian conception of\npersons grounds dignity in three things\u2014equality, agency, and\nindividuality\u2014we can further distinguish three kinds of\nrecognition self-respect. The first is respect for oneself as a person\namong persons, as a member of the moral community with a status and\ndignity equal to every other person (see, for example, Thomas 1983a;\nBoxill 1976; Hill 1973). This involves having some conception of the\nkinds of treatment from others that would count as one\u2019s due as\na person and treatment that would be degrading or beneath one\u2019s\ndignity, desiring to be regarded and treated appropriately, and\nresenting and being disposed to protest disregard and disrespectful\ntreatment. Thinking of oneself as having certain moral rights that\nothers ought not to violate is part of this kind of self-respect;\nservility (regarding oneself as the inferior of others) and arrogance\n(thinking oneself superior to others) are among its opposites.\n\nThe second kind of recognition self-respect involves an appreciation\nof oneself as an agent, a being with the ability and responsibility to\nact autonomously and value appropriately (see, for example, G. Taylor\n1985; Telfer 1968). Persons who respect themselves as agents take\ntheir responsibilities seriously, especially their responsibilities to\nlive in accord with their dignity as persons, to govern themselves\nfittingly, and to make of themselves and their lives something they\nbelieve to be good. So, self-respecting persons regard certain forms\nof acting, thinking, desiring, and feeling as befitting them as\npersons and other forms as self-debasing or shameful, and they expect\nthemselves to adhere to the former and avoid the latter. They take\ncare of themselves and seek to develop and use their talents and\nabilities in pursuit of their plans, projects, and goals. Those who\nare shameless, uncontrolled, weak-willed, self-consciously\nsycophantic, chronically irresponsible, slothfully dependent,\nself-destructive, or unconcerned with the shape and direction of their\nlives may be said to not respect themselves as agents.\n\nA third kind of recognition self-respect involves the appreciation of\nthe importance of being autonomously self-defining. One way a\nself-respecting individual does this is through having, and living in\nlight, of a normative self-conception, i.e., a conception of being and\nliving that she regards as worthy of her as the particular person she\nis. Such a self-conception both gives expression to ideals and\ncommitments that shape the individual\u2019s identity, and also\norganizes desires, choices, pursuits, and projects in ways that give\nsubstance and worth to the self. Self-respecting people hold\nthemselves to personal expectations and standards the disappointment\nof which they would regard as unworthy of them, shameful, even\ncontemptible (although they may not apply these standards to others)\n(Hill 1982). People who sell out, betray their own values, live\ninauthentic lives, let themselves be defined by others, or are\ncomplacently self-accepting lack this kind of recognition\nself-respect.\n\nTo these three Kantian kinds of recognition self-respect, we can add a\nfourth, which has to do with the fact that it is not just as abstract\nhuman beings or as agents with personal and universalizable moral\ngoals and obligations that individuals can, do, or should respect\nthemselves but also as concrete persons embedded in particular social\nstructures and occupying various social positions with status-related\nresponsibilities they must meet to be self-respecting (Middleton\n2006). This last kind also has political implications, as discussed\nbelow.\n\nEvaluative self-respect, which expresses confidence in one\u2019s\nmerit as a person, rests on an appraisal of oneself in light of the\nnormative self-conception that structures recognition self-respect.\nRecognition self-respecting persons are concerned to be the kind of\nperson they think it is good and appropriate for them to be and they\ntry to live the kind of life such a person should live. Thus, they\nhave and try to live by certain standards of worthiness by which they\nare committed to judge themselves. Indeed, they stake themselves,\ntheir value and their identities, on living in accord with these\nstandards. Because they want to know where they stand, morally, they\nare disposed to reflectively examine and evaluate their character and\nconduct in light of their normative vision of themselves. And it\nmatters to them that they are able to \u201cbear their own\nsurvey,\u201d as Hume says (1739, 620). Evaluative self-respect\ncontains the judgment that one is or is becoming the worthy kind of\nperson one seeks to be, and, more significantly, that one is not in\ndanger of becoming an unworthy kind of person (Dillon 2004).\nEvaluative self-respect holds, at the least, the judgment that one\n\u201ccomes up to scratch,\u201d as Telfer (1968) puts it. Those\nwhose conduct is unworthy or whose character is shameful by their own\nstandards do not deserve their own evaluative respect. However, people\ncan be poor self-appraisers and their standards can be quite\ninappropriate to them or to any person, and so their evaluative\nself-respect, though still subjectively satisfying, can be\nunwarranted, as can the loss or lack of it. Interestingly, although\nphilosophers have paid scant attention to evaluative respect for\nothers, significant work has been done on evaluative self-respect.\nThis may reflect an asymmetry between the two: although our evaluative\nrespect for others may have no effect on them, perhaps because we\ndon\u2019t express it or they don\u2019t value our appraisal, our\nown self-evaluation matters intensely to us and can powerfully affect\nour self-identity and the shape and structure of our lives. Indeed, an\nindividual\u2019s inability to stomach herself can profoundly\ndiminish the quality of her life, even her desire to continue\nliving.\n\nSome philosophers have contended that a third kind of self-valuing\nunderlies both recognition and evaluative self-respect. It is a more\nbasic sense of worth that enables an individual to develop the\nintellectually more sophisticated forms, a precondition for being able\nto take one\u2019s qualities or the fact that one is a person as\ngrounds of positive self-worth. It has been called \u201cbasic\npsychological security\u201d (Thomas 1989), \u201cself-love\u201d\n(Buss 1999), and \u201cbasal self-respect\u201d (Dillon 1997). Basal\nself-valuing is our most fundamental sense of ourselves as mattering\nand our primordial interpretation of self and self-worth. Strong and\nsecure basal self-respect can immunize an individual against personal\nfailing or social denigration, but damage to basal self-respect, which\ncan occur when people grow up in social, political, or cultural\nenvironments that devalue them or \u201ctheir kind,\u201d can make\nit impossible for people to properly interpret themselves and their\nself-worth, because it affects the way in which they assess reality\nand weigh reasons. Basal self-respect is thus the ground of the\npossibility of recognition and evaluative self-respect.\n\nThere are also non-deontological accounts of moral recognition\nself-respect. Utilitarians, for example, can treat self-respect as of\nparamount importance to a flourishing or happy life, and thereby\njustifying moral constraints on the treatment of others (Scarre 1992).\nSimilarly, one could give a virtue-theoretical account of recognition\nself-respect, especially the agentic form (Dillon 2015), although this\navenue has been relatively unexplored\n\nIt is common in everyday discourse and philosophical discussion to\ntreat self-respect and self-esteem as synonyms. It is evaluative\nself-respect, typically, with which self-esteem is conflated (Dillon\n2013). Evaluative self-respect and (high) self-esteem are both forms\nof positive self-regard concerned with one\u2019s worth, both involve\nhaving a favorable view of oneself in virtue of one\u2019s activities\nand personal qualities, and a person can have or lack either one\nundeservedly. Nevertheless, many philosophers have argued that the two\nattitudes are importantly different (for example, Dillon 2004, 2013;\nHarris 2001; Chazan 1998; Sachs 1981; Darwall 1977), although some\ntheorists treat the evaluative stance as a form of self-esteem\n(\u201cmortal self-esteem\u201d). The main difference between the\ntwo is that evaluative self-respect is a normative stance and\nself-esteem is not: the former calls for justification in light of\nstandards one has good reason to regard as appropriate, while the\nlatter arises from beliefs about oneself whose justification need not\nmatter to one and that need not involve standards-based\nself-assessment. Many philosophers agree that evaluative self-respect\nis morally important, which makes sense inasmuch as it is in the\nservice of the moral demands of dignity, worthy character, agency, and\none\u2019s moral commitments, and so is a motivation for morally\nappropriate living. Self-esteem--having a good opinion of oneself or\nfeeling good about oneself--is one of the most extensively studied\nphenomena in psychology and social psychology; it is generally\nregarded by social scientists as central to healthy psychological\nfunctioning and well-being, although they note that it has no\nnecessary connection to moral values, is central to such negative\nstates as narcissism, and can lead to serious disrespect of others and\nharm unless appropriately constrained (Baumeister et al 1996). (But\nsee Keshen (2017) on the value of reasonable self-esteem.) One way of\ndistinguishing evaluative self-respect and self-esteem is by their\ngrounds and the points of view from which they are appraised.\nEvaluative self-respect involves an assessment from a moral point of\nview of one\u2019s character and conduct in light of standards one\nregards as implied by one\u2019s moral worth as an agent and a\nperson. Self-esteem, as popularly and scientifically understood, is\nbased both on whatever qualities or activities one prizes or thinks\nothers prize, and on the esteem one believes one gets from others\nwhose esteem one values. It does not essentially concern morally\nsignificant worth, appropriate self-valuing, or self-assessment from a\nmoral point of view, and it can be based on features wholly unrelated\nto or even opposed to good character. For example, one can have a good\nopinion of oneself in virtue of being a good joke-teller or for having\nwon an important sports competition and yet not think one is a good\nperson because of it (Darwall 1977). And depending on what serves\none\u2019s psychological needs or suits one\u2019s companions, one\ncan derive high self-esteem from successful thuggery as from being\nhonest and kind. To have self-esteem is to feel good about oneself; to\nhave evaluative self-respect is to feel justified, to be able to hold\none\u2019s head up, look others in the eye, face oneself in the\nmirror. Another way of distinguishing them focuses on what it is to\nlose them: to lose evaluative respect for oneself is to find oneself\nto be shameful, contemptible, or intolerable; to lose self-esteem is\nto think less well of oneself, to be downcast because one believes one\nlacks qualities that would add to one\u2019s luster (Harris 2001) or\nthat others think less well of one.\n\nSelf-respect is also often identified with pride, although the two are\nrather different (Morton 2017). Just as there are different kinds of\nself-respect so, there are different kinds of pride, which are\ncomplexly related. In one sense, pride is the pleasure or satisfaction\ntaken in one\u2019s achievements, possessions, or associations; this\nkind of pride can be an affective element of either evaluative\nself-respect or self-esteem. In another sense, pride is inordinate\nself-esteem or vanity, an excessively high opinion of one\u2019s\nqualities, accomplishments, or status that can make one arrogant and\ncontemptuous of others. This kind of pride contrasts with both\nwell-grounded evaluative self-respect and the interpersonal kind of\nmoral recognition self-respect. But pride can also be a claim to and\ncelebration of a status worth or to equality with others, especially\nother groups (for example, Black Pride), which is interpersonal\nrecognition self-respect (Thomas 1993a, 1978\u201379). Pride can also be\n\u201cproper pride,\u201d which is a sense of one\u2019s dignity\nthat prevents one from doing what is unworthy; this is the agentic\ndimension of recognition self-respect. Pride\u2019s opposites, shame\nand humility, are also closely related to self-respect. A loss of\nevaluative self-respect may be expressed in shame, but shameless\npeople manifest a lack of recognition self-respect; and although\nhumiliation can diminish or undermine recognition self-respect and\nevaluative self-respect, humility is an appropriate dimension of the\nevaluative self-respect of any imperfect person.\n\nOne issue with which contemporary philosophers have been concerned is\nwhether self-respect is an objective concept or a subjective one. If\nit is the former, then there are certain beliefs, attitudes, and\ndispositions a person must have to be self-respecting. A person who\nthought of herself as a lesser sort of being whose interests and\nwell-being are less important than those of others would not count as\nhaving moral recognition self-respect, no matter how appropriate she\nregards her stance. If self-respect is a subjective concept, then a\nperson counts as having self-respect if, for example, she believes she\nis not tolerating treatment she regards as unworthy or behaving in\nways she thinks is beneath her, regardless of whether her judgments\nabout herself are accurate or her standards or sense of what she is\ndue are judged by others to be reasonable or worthy (Massey 1983a).\nPsychologists, for whom \u201cself-esteem\u201d is the term of\npractice, tend to regard the various dimensions of a person\u2019s\nsense of worth as subjective. Many philosophers treat the\ninterpersonal dimension of recognition self-respect objectively, and\nit is generally thought that having manifestly inaccurate beliefs\nabout oneself is good grounds for at least calling an\nindividual\u2019s sense of worth unjustified or compromised (Meyers\n1989). But there is no consensus regarding the standards to which\nindividuals hold themselves and by which they judge themselves, and\ncertainly the standards of the self-defining dimension of moral\nrecognition self-respect are inescapably, though perhaps not\nexclusively, subjective. Complicating the objective/subjective\ndistinction, however, is the fact of the social construction of\nself-respect. What it is to be a person or to have a status worthy of\nrespect, what treatment and conduct are appropriate to a person or one\nwith such a status, what forms of life and character have\nmerit\u2014all of these are given different content in different\nsociocultural contexts. Individuals necessarily, though perhaps not\ninalterably, learn to engage with themselves and with issues of\nself-worth in the terms and modes of the sociocultural conceptions in\nwhich they have been immersed. And different kinds of individuals may\nbe given different opportunities in different sociocultural contexts\nto acquire or develop the grounds of the different kinds of\nself-respect (Dillon 2021, 1997; Moody-Adams 1992\u201393; Meyers\n1989; Thomas 1983b). Even fully justified self-respect may thus be\nless than strongly objective and more than simply subjective.\n",
