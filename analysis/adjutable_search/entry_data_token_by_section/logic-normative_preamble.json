    "main_text": "\n\nWe consider it to be a bad thing to be inconsistent. Similarly, we\ncriticize others for failing to appreciate (at least the more obvious)\nlogical consequences of their beliefs. In both cases there is a\nfailure to conform one\u2019s attitudes to logical strictures. We\ngenerally take agents who fall short of the demands of logic to be\nrationally defective. This suggests that logic has a normative role to\nplay in our rational economy; it instructs us how we ought or ought\nnot to think or reason. The notion that logic has such a normative\nrole to play is deeply anchored in the way we traditionally think\nabout and teach logic. To consider just two examples, Kant\ncharacterizes what he calls \u201cpure general\u201d logic as\nembodying the \u201cabsolutely necessary rules of thought without\nwhich there can be no employment whatsoever of the\nunderstanding\u201d (A52/B76), which instruct us not \u201chow the\nunderstanding is and thinks\u201d but \u201chow it ought to\nproceed\u201d (Kant 1974 [1800]: 16). Similarly, Frege, in his\nvehement opposition to the psychologistic tendencies of his time,\nclassifies logic, \u201clike ethics\u201d as a \u201cnormative\nscience\u201d (Frege 1897/1979: 228), one whose laws \u201cprescribe\nuniversally how one should think if one is to think at all\u201d\n(Frege 1893/1903/2009: xv). This entry is concerned with the question\nas to whether the tradition and the intuitions that appear to\nunderwrite it are correct. In other words, it is concerned with the\nquestion as to whether logic has normative authority over us. And if\nit does, in what sense exactly it can be said to do so?\n",
