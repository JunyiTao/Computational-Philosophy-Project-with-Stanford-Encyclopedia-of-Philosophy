    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n7. Ethics\n\n\nBuridan's commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is\none of his most influential works, though it is today perhaps the least\nstudied (Zupko 2013a). It contains significant discussions of the structure of the\nwill and its relation to the intellect, the nature of human freedom,\nthe phenomenon of akrasia or weakness of will, practical\nreason, and the unity of the\n virtues.[54]\n\n\nIn moral psychology, Buridan appears to effect a compromise between\ntwo rival views on the relation between the will and the intellect: the\nintellectualist or naturalist tradition associated with Aristotle and\nThomas Aquinas, according to which the will is always subordinate to\nthe intellect, and the voluntarist tradition of Augustine and\nFranciscan thinkers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, which\nheld that the will is sometimes capable of acting autonomously.\nBuridan's apparent compromise is to argue (with the intellectualists)\nthat human happiness ultimately consists in an intellectual act,\n\u201cthe perfect apprehension of God\u201d, rather than in a\nvolitional act such as perfectly willing or perfectly loving God (QNE\nX.5: 213rb), although he emphasizes (with the voluntarists) the role of\nthe will as a self-determining power in achieving that end. The\ncompromise turns on Buridan's innovative conception of free choice,\nwhich develops Albert the Great's notion that certainty admits of\n degrees (see Saarinen 1993, 161\u201393).\n The idea is that even if the will lacks\nthe power to choose evil as such, it is still able to defer its choice\nand do nothing if the goodness of one of the alternatives presented to\nit is unclear or uncertain. Of course, given our poor epistemic\nposition in this life, it almost always has this power because it\nis almost always possible to doubt the goodness of a\nproposed course of action. The compromise is only apparent, however,\nbecause it turns out that the will's act of deferment is possible only\nif \u201cthe intellect would judge it to be good to consider the\nmatter further\u201d (QNE III.5:\n 44va).[55]\n This claim, together with his assumptions that the will can only\nchoose non-optimally through ignorance or impediment (QNE III.3\u20135; 9),\nplaces deferment squarely within the jurisdiction of the intellect,\nwhich must weigh the relative goodness of different possible courses\nof action, including deferment. It is not the case that the will can\nchoose to defer regardless of what the intellect decides, or that the\nwill can choose to defer even if the intellect has judged deferment to\nbe less good than some other course of action. Accordingly, if this is\na compromise between the intellectualists and the voluntarists, it is\na disingenuous one. It is more likely that Buridan simply appropriated\nvoluntarist terminology to express what is otherwise a\nstraightforwardly intellectualist account of the will, perhaps to\ndispel the cloud of heterodoxy which had surrounded intellectualist\nmoral psychology since the Condemnation of\n 1277.[56]\n\n\nIt is also in Buridan's moral psychology that we find the most\nplausible explanation of the example which has come down to us known as\n\u2018Buridan's Ass\u2019, in which a donkey starves to death because\nit has no reason to choose between two equidistant and equally tempting\npiles of hay. This particular example is nowhere to be found in\nBuridan's writings, although there are versions of it going back at\nleast to Aristotle (see De Caelo\n 295b32).[57]\n The best explanation of its association with Buridan is that it\noriginated as a parody of his account of free choice by later critics,\nwho found absurd the idea that the will's freedom could consist in\ninaction, i.e., in its ability to defer or \u2018send back\u2019 for\nfurther consideration any practical judgment which is not absolutely\ncertain.\n",
