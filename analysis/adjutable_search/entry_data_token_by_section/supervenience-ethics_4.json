    "main_text": "Theorizing Ethical Supervenience || Ontological and ascriptive supervenience\n1.4 Ontological and ascriptive supervenience\n\nThe ethical supervenience theses discussed thus far are\nontological: they propose various covariance relationships\nbetween ethical properties and certain other properties. However,\nJames Klagge (1988) has helpfully regimented an important alternative\nway of understanding ethical supervenience. Call two circumstances\nthat a thinker believes to be identical in all base respects\napparently base-identical. Now consider the following\nclaim:\n\nAscriptive\n\nAnyone who treats apparently base-identical circumstances as ethically\ndifferent from each other thereby makes a mistake.\n\n\nUnlike the supervenience theses encountered so far, Ascriptive is\nfundamentally a claim about ethical judgments: it is a claim\nthat someone who makes a certain pair of such judgments thereby makes\na mistake. Klagge usefully dubs claims like this ascriptive\nsupervenience theses.\n\nA fully informative ascriptive supervenience thesis would explain how\nwe should understand the mistake claimed by Ascriptive. There\nare several possibilities, of which four are worth emphasizing. The\nclaimed mistake could be alethic, consisting in having made\nat least one judgment with a false content. Or it might be\nepistemic: consisting in making at least one epistemically\nunjustified judgment. It could be conceptual, consisting in\njudging in a way that is inconsistent with the meanings of ethical\nwords. Finally, it might be characterized as ethical,\nconsisting in making a judgment in a way that is vicious or ethically\nobjectionable. (Note that the relevant judgment might be mistaken in\nmore than one of these ways.)\n\nBecause ascriptive supervenience theses are about judgments rather\nthan relations between classes of properties, they are quite different\nfrom the ontological supervenience theses we have considered thus far.\nOne way to bring this out is to notice that one could potentially\naccept Ascriptive without thereby having any views about whether there\nare ethical properties. On the other hand, there are interesting\nconnections between certain ascriptive and ontological supervenience\ntheses. For example, anyone who accepts Strong Intuitive seems to be\ncommitted to a version of Ascriptive, with an alethic gloss on\n\u2018mistake\u2019.\n\nThis entry began with the suggestion that it is plausible that the\nethical supervenes. This section has aimed to clarify some of our\noptions for understanding that idea. The various interpretive options\nwe have explored together suggest a dizzying space of possible ethical\nsupervenience theses. This in turn raises a pressing question: which\nof these theses (if any) best articulate the plausibility and\nsignificance that philosophers have often taken ethical supervenience\nto have? One thing that might help to answer this question is to\nconsider the arguments that we can give for supervenience: these\narguments might favor some of these theses over others.\n",
