    "main_text": "Applications || The problem of mental/higher-level causation\n5.2 The problem of mental/higher-level causation\n\nHow can mental goings-on bring about physical effects, as they seem to\ndo, given that the physical realizers of mental goings-on are already\nsufficient to cause these effects? This question gives rise to the\nproblem of mental (more generally, higher-level) causation, encoding\ntwo threats: first, that mental properties, if efficacious,\nproblematically overdetermine their effects; second, that avoiding\noverdetermination requires that mental properties be causally excluded\nby their realizers. Overdetermination and exclusion are avoided if\nmental and physical goings-on are identical, but in that case it seems\nthat mental goings-on are not efficacious qua mental (see\nHorgan 1989); as Yablo puts it: \u201cMental events are effective,\nmaybe, but not by way of their mental properties\u201d (1992: 249).\nMoreover, type identity seems at odds with the multiple realizability\nof mental properties.\n\nSome, including MacDonald and MacDonald (1986), Yablo (1992), Wilson\n(1999), and Shoemaker (2001), have suggested that a better response\nproceeds by taking mental properties to be determinables of their\nphysical\n realizers.[44]\n The appeal to determination reflects various features of determinates\nand determinables, including Causal compatibility. As Yablo\nsays,\n\n\n[W]e know that [determinables and determinates] are not causal rivals.\n[\u2026] Determinables and their determinates, like objects and\ntheir parts, are guaranteed to be on the same team. (1992: 259)\n\n\nMoreover, as per Multiple determinates, determinables are\nmultiply determined, and given that determinables and determinates are\ntype- and perhaps also token-distinct, one can argue\n (see \u00a73.5)\n that determinables are distinctively efficacious. If mental\nproperties are determinables of physical realizers, these features are\ninherited: as causal non-competitors, overdetermination is avoided\nwhile accommodating multiple realizability, compatible with the\ndistinctness and distinctive efficacy of mental properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other higher-level goings-on, in which case\nrealization might be determination, more generally.\n\nA determinable-based approach to realization is subject to two main\nconcerns (besides those generally targeting a powers-based account;\n see \u00a73.5),\n each aiming to show that realization cannot be determination, on\ngrounds that realization lacks some key feature of determination (see\nEhring 1996; Funkhouser 2006, 2014; Walter 2007; Worley 1997). First\nis the argument from mental multiple realizability, according to which\nsuch realizability effectively violates Determination \u2018in\nrespect of\u2019 determinables (entailing that determinates\ndiffer in respect of determinables), since\n\n\nMental properties are said to be multiply realizable precisely because\ndistinct physical realizers can be exactly the same with respect to\nthe mental property they realize (Walter 2007: 219)\n\n\nin which case\n\n\n[T]he physical realizers of the mental will not differ mentally at\nall, as they should if they are determinates of the requisite mental\nstates. (Ehring 1996: 474)\n\n\nSecond is the argument from mental superdeterminates, according to\nwhich a mental property could be maximally specified qua\nmental\u2014as, e.g., a precise state of searing pain (Ehring), or a\nbelief maximally specified along the dimensions of content and\nconfidence (Funkhouser); but if realization is determination, this\nwould falsely imply that mental super-determinates could be further\ndetermined.\n\nOne response to these concerns, offered by Wilson (2009), proceeds by\nanalogical attention to color metamerism, in which colors of the same\nhue, saturation and brightness can differ in respect of color, and are\nmoreover reasonably taken to have physical determination dimensions.\nOne \u2018metameric moral\u2019 is that properties such as\ncolor may have physical determination dimensions; a second is\nthat the determination dimensions had by a given higher-level property\nmay be science-relative. Applying the morals: there is no in-principle\nproblem with mental properties\u2019 having physical determination\n dimensions;[45]\n moreover, which dimensions are associated with mental properties may\nbe science-relative. This allows accommodation of mental multiple\nrealizability: mental properties with diverse physical realizers can\nbe exactly alike, relative to the determination dimensions associated\nwith psychology, compatible with these mental properties being\ndifferent, relative to a lower-level physical science distinguishing\nthese realizers. And given that different sciences may treat a single\ndeterminable as having different determination dimensions, mental\nproperties may be super-determinate relative to a purely psychological\nscience, while being further determined relative to a lower-level\nscience.\n\nA powers-based implementation of the metameric\n morals[46]\n also provides a basis for a response to a third objection, due to\nWorley (1997), according to which the constituents of beliefs are not\nconstituents of their physical realizers, as they would have to be if\n(as per Worley\u2019s constitution-based account;\n see \u00a73.5)\n beliefs were determinables of physical\n determinates.[47]\n Supposing that constituents are associated with sets of powers, the\ncontent of a belief may be a constituent of its physical realizers,\nafter all\u2014not qua content per se, but\nqua the relevant subset of powers.\n",
