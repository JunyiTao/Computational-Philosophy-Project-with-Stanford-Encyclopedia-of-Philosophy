    "main_text": "Immigration\n7. Immigration\n\nThere are many issues debated in the global justice literature\nconcerning migration, whether temporary, permanent, legally sanctioned\nor undocumented. These include: Should states have the right to\ncontrol their borders? Even if they have such a right, should states\nbe more generous in admitting would-be migrants, especially\nconsidering the facts about global disparities in life prospects? When\naffluent developed states refuse to open their borders to the\neconomically disadvantaged, is this equivalent to members of the\naristocracy unjustly protecting their privilege, as was the case in\nfeudal times? What responsibilities are there to refugees? Can\nundocumented immigration be justified under certain contemporary\ncircumstances? What sorts of criteria may affluent developed countries\nuse when selecting migrants from the pool of applicants for\ncitizenship? May they legitimately consider how prospective migrants\nwould fit in with current citizens, favoring certain religious,\nlinguistic, or ethnic affiliations to manage compatibility? When\nmaking migrant selection decisions, should they consider the effects\non those who remain in countries of origin and if so, is this fair to\nthe would-be migrants who would be excluded on grounds of alleged\nnegative impacts for home country citizens? If states admit migrant\nworkers, are there moral constraints on how they should be treated?\nWould admitting temporary workers without simultaneously allowing them\na pathway to citizenship be unjust? What responsibilities do we have\nin relation to human trafficking?\n\nThere are several now classic defenses of state\u2019s rights to\ncontrol borders. David Miller (Miller 2005, 2007), Michael Walzer\n(Walzer 1981) and Christopher Wellman (Wellman and Cole 2011) have\nbeen particularly important. Prominent proponents of the alternative\n\u201cOpen Borders\u201d position include Joseph Carens (Carens\n1987, 2013), Philip Cole (Cole 2000; Wellman and Cole 2011), Chandran\nKukathas (2021) and Alex Sager (2018). While many theorists discuss\nthe responsibilities to refugees and guest workers, Walzer\u2019s\ntreatment is particularly influential, especially in arguing for his\nview that guest worker programs are only justified when they offer\nsuch \u201cguests\u201d a proper pathway to full and equal\ncitizenship (Walzer 1981). See also: Owen 2020 and Miller 2020. Within\nthe global justice literature, there is considerable discussion of the\nethics of recruiting migrants away from poor countries. Whether brain\ndrain issues should be salient for migration decisions has been a\nfocal point for some discussion (Carens 2013; Oberman 2013; Brock and\nBlake 2015; Bertram 2018). More generally, much recent discussion\nconcerns justice in state admission policies and the kinds of factors\nthat may or should be included in deciding who to admit and exclude\n(Wellman and Cole 2011; Lister 2010; Oberman, Fine and Ypi 2016; Blake\n2019; Sager 2018; Song 2018; Brock 2020; Morgan 2020; Wilcox 2021;\nHidalgo 2021; Buckinx 2019; Jaggar 2020; Vasanthakumar 2022). There\nhas been considerable discussion of appropriate treatment for refugees\n(see especially Serena Parekh 2017, 2020 and Brock 2020). And\ndiscussion has also focused on duties for those who leave their\ncountries of origin (Vasanthakumar 2022; Brock and Blake 2015).
