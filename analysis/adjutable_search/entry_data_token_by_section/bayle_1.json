    "main_text": "Society of Atheists\n2. Society of Atheists\n\nThe philosophical work that earned Bayle an international reputation\nis the Various Thoughts on the Occasion of a Comet (1682),\ncompleted shortly before Louis XIV closed the Protestant Academy at\nSedan where Bayle was employed as a Professor. The manuscript of the\nbook accompanied Bayle in exile to Rotterdam and was soon published\nthere. Bayle feared that the strange and complicated plan of the work\nwould cause it to fail, but the opposite happened: the book\u2019s\noriginality and freshness led to a wide readership and an\ninternational reputation for Bayle. It is, nevertheless, a very\nstrange and complicated book.\n\nThe nominal goal of the work is to refute superstitions about comets.\nThe book is written as a series of letters to an unnamed Sorbonne\ntheologian, each of which is dedicated to reasons for or against\ninterpreting comets as signs of divine anger and forthcoming\nvengeance. Bayle offers a quick battery of purely philosophical\narguments against interpreting comets as anything other than natural\nevents, and then turns to his seventh \u201ctheological\u201d\nargument, which is the focus of the bulk of the work. The main thrust\nof the argument is to show that if God sends comets as punishment\nor signs of his anger, then God is responsible for causing the\nmost serious evil, idolatry, which God has said in the Bible in the\nworst of all sins. Since the entire world can see comets, and since\ncomets do not communicate any clear message, each nation will\ninterpret the comet in its own way. As a matter of historical fact,\nmost nations will fall into some divine interpretation of the event,\nwhere \u201cdivine\u201d refers to the local religion\u2019s\nconception of the divine. The result is that if comets are indeed\nintended as divine messages, then their appearance will lead to a\nsurge in global idol worship for which God will be responsible. If, on\nthe other hand, comets are natural events, and it is human folly to\ninterpret comets as divine messages, then God is innocent of any idol\nworship that results from the passing of space rocks.\n\nIn a surprising but logically seamless fashion characteristic of\nBayle, all of this turns into an impassioned defence of the virtues of\natheists and the possibility of founding a purely secular\n(non-religious) society. The Various Thoughts on a Comet is\nindeed about superstition, but it is not really about comets. The\nsuperstitions that Bayle spends the vast majority of the book\ntargeting are, first, that belief in God is necessary to live a moral\nlife, and second, that religion is necessary to keep society peaceful\nand lawful. Just as Bayle refuted superstitions about comets by\ndemonstrating that they are purely natural, predictable events, so\ntoo, Bayle refutes superstitions about atheists by demonstrating that\nmorality and law can and should be treated as purely natural,\npredictable aspects of human behaviour, based largely in education and\ntemperament.\n\nBayle\u2019s refutation of superstitions about atheism relies on a\nmix of historical fact, common sense, and philosophical argument. The\nrelevant historical facts are that there have been, in every age,\natheists noted for their virtue. In antiquity, Bayle points to\nDiagoras, Theodorus, Euhemerus, Nicanor, Hippo, and Epicurus. Closer\nto his own time, Bayle\u2019s favourite example is Lucilio Vanini,\nrenowned for his virtue, but who was tortured and then burned at the\nstake in 1619 for denying the existence of God. This leads to the\nultimate principle of Bayle\u2019s naturalized morality: people do\nnot act on the basis of their principles. Whether these are religious\nprinciples or secular moral principles makes no difference: actions do\nnot spring from belief or faith. Bayle takes this as an empirical fact\nand backs it up with historical examples. The real motives of human\naction are custom, education, and passion, all of which manifest\nthemselves as hard-to-shake habits.\n\n\nThus we see that from the fact that a man has no religion it does not\nfollow necessarily that he will be led to every sort of crime or to\nevery sort of pleasure. It follows only that he will be led to the\nthings to which his temperament and his turn of mind make him\nsensitive. (OD III: 113)\n\n\nAtheists can live just as calmly, wisely, generously, courageously,\nand in general, virtuously as religious believers because all of these\ncharacter traits spring from temperament, education, and custom, not\nfrom principles or judgments or faith. Therefore, a society comprised\nentirely of atheists can be a lawful, well-ordered place, assuming the\natheist citizens are raised and educated properly. In fact, Bayle\nsuggests in the most controversial passages of the Various\nThoughts on a Comet that an atheist society may even be\nmore peaceful than any religious society. That is because\nreligion has a natural tendency to inflame the worst passions in human\nnature:\n\n\nWe know the impression made on people\u2019s minds by the idea that\nthey are fighting for the preservation of their temples and\naltars\u2026; how courageous and bold we become when we fixate on\nthe hope of conquering others by means of God\u2019s protection, and\nwhen we are animated by the natural aversion we have for the enemies\nof our beliefs. (OD III: 84)\n\n\nNobody can deny that religion has been an important motive of war and\nviolence in human history. Since atheists lack religion, they should\nlive quieter lives.\n\nThe Various Thoughts on a Comet has been interpreted as a\ndisinterested refutation of various widespread (then and now)\nsuperstitions about atheism, as a focused attack on the Catholic\npersecution of Calvinists in France (Rex 1965), and as an apology for\natheism (Mori 1999 [2020]). Bayle insisted in his sequels to the work,\nthe Addition to the Various Thoughts (1686; OD III: 161\u2013186),\nand the Continuation of the Various Thoughts (1705; OD III:\n187\u2013417), that the goal of the work was simply to prove that atheism\nis no worse than idolatry, and that religious believers do not have a\nmonopoly on moral behaviour. These were, from Bayle\u2019s point of\nview, obvious historical facts that intellectual integrity requires us\nto admit.\n",
