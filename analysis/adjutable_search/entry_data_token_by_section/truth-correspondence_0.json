    "main_text": "History of the Correspondence Theory\n1. History of the Correspondence Theory\n\n\nThe correspondence theory is often traced back to Aristotle\u2019s\nwell-known definition of truth (Metaphysics 1011b25):\n\u201cTo say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is,\nis false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that\nit is not, is true\u201d\u2014but virtually identical formulations\ncan be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist\n263b). It is noteworthy that this definition does not highlight the\nbasic correspondence intuition. Although it does allude to a relation\n(saying something of something) to reality (what\nis), the relation is not made very explicit, and there is no\nspecification of what on the part of reality is responsible for the\ntruth of a saying. As such, the definition offers a muted, relatively\nminimal version of a correspondence theory. (For this reason it has\nalso been claimed as a precursor of deflationary theories of truth.)\nAristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in\nthe Categories (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of underlying\nthings that make statements true and implies that these things\n(pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts\n(viz., his sitting and his not sitting are said to\nunderlie the statements \u201cHe is sitting\u201d and \u201cHe is\nnot sitting\u201d, respectively). Most influential is\nAristotle\u2019s claim in De Interpretatione (16a3) that\nthoughts are \u201clikenesses\u201d (homoiomata) of\nthings. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a\nthought\u2019s likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a\ndefinition would fit well into his overall philosophy of\nmind. (Cf. Crivelli 2004; Szaif 2006.)\n",
