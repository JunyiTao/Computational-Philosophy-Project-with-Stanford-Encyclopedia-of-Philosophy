Overview of Leibniz's Philosophy\n\n\nUnlike most of the great philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not\nwrite a magnum opus; there is no single work that can be said\nto contain the core of his thought. While he did produce two books, the\nTheodicy (1710) and the New Essays Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (finished in 1704 but not published until 1765), the\nstudent of Leibniz's thought must piece together Leibniz's\nphilosophy from his myriad writings: essays published in scholarly\njournals and in more popular journals; unpublished works left abandoned\nby their author; and his many letters. Moreover, many of\nLeibniz's writings have not yet been published. The authoritative\nscholarly version of Leibniz's works, the Akademie edition, has\nthus far only published his philosophical writings from 1663 to 1690;\nin other words, only half of his writing life has been\ncovered. And the mere act of dating pieces often depends upon careful\nanalysis of the paper Leibniz wrote on and watermarks and so on.\n(Hence, for example, the important short work, Primary Truths,\nwhich, because of its content, was often thought to date to 1686 (as in\nAG), has recently been redated by the Akademie editors to 1689 because\nof a watermark.) Piecing together Leibniz's philosophy into a\nsystematic whole is made more difficult because Leibniz seems to have\nchanged or at least refined his views on a number of issues over the\ncourse of his career and because he was always very aware (some might\nsay too aware) of the audience for any of his writings.\n\n\nAs stated above, Leibniz's intellectual training was squarely\nin the tradition of Scholasticism and Renaissance humanism; his\nbackground, then, was of Aristotelianism, Platonism, and orthodox\nChristianity. Yet, as he became more familiar with the modern\nphilosophy of the seventeenth century, he came to see many of its\nvirtues. Although there is some reason to be skeptical of the details,\nthe spirit of the self-portrait Leibniz paints to Nicolas Remond in\n1714 can be a helpful guide for approaching his work. He writes:\n\n\n\u2026I have tried to uncover and unite the truth buried and\nscattered under the opinions of all the different philosophical sects,\nand I believe I have added something of my own which takes a few steps\nforward. The circumstances under which my studies proceeded from my\nearliest youth have given me some facility in this. I discovered\nAristotle as a lad, and even the Scholastics did not repel me; even now\nI do not regret this. But then Plato too, and Plotinus, gave me some\nsatisfaction, not to mention other ancient thinkers whom I consulted\nlater. After finishing the trivial schools, I fell upon the moderns,\nand I recall walking in a grove on the outskirts of Leipzig called the\nRosental, at the age of fifteen, and deliberating whether to preserve\nsubstantial forms or not. Mechanism finally prevailed and led me to\napply myself to mathematics\u2026. But when I looked for the ultimate\nreasons for mechanism, and even for the laws of motion, I was greatly\nsurprised to see that they could not be found in mathematics but that I\nshould have to return to metaphysics. This led me back to entelechies,\nand from the material to the formal, and at last brought me to\nunderstand, after many corrections and forward steps in my thinking,\nthat monads or simple substances are the only true substances and that\nmaterial things are only phenomena, though well founded and well\nconnected. Of this, Plato, and even the later Academics and the\nskeptics too, had caught some glimpses\u2026 I flatter myself to have\npenetrated into the harmony of these different realms and to have seen\nthat both sides are right provided that they do not clash with each\nother; that everything in nature happens mechanically and at the same\ntime metaphysically but that the source of mechanics is metaphysics. (G\nIII 606/L 654\u201355)\n\n\nAgain, there is some reason to doubt whether Leibniz was really\nfifteen when he made his philosophical perambulations and whether and\nto what extent he had actually read any of the moderns. Nevertheless,\nthis self-portrait does express something that one sees in\nLeibniz's writings: the weaving together of varying strands of\nancient and modern philosophy in a remarkably creative and\nsophisticated manner.\n\n\nThe letter to Remond makes clear that Leibniz had reservations about\ncertain aspects of the modern philosophy, qualms that arose from and\nled him back to this eclectic mix of Aristotle and Christian Platonism.\nIt is probably most helpful, then, to see Leibniz's philosophy as\na reaction to two sets of modern opponents: on the one hand, Descartes\nand his followers; on the other hand, Hobbes and Spinoza.\n\n\nLeibniz's critique of Descartes and his followers was focused\nprincipally on the Cartesian account of body or corporeal substance.\nAccording to Descartes, the essence of body is extension; that is, a\ncorporeal substance is simply a geometric object made concrete, an\nobject that has size and shape and is in motion. This view, indeed, is\nthe cornerstone of the new mechanical philosophy to which Leibniz was\noriginally attracted. Nevertheless, Leibniz came to see two distinct\nproblems with this view. First, in claiming that the essence of body is\nextension, Descartes is endorsing the view that matter is infinitely\ndivisible. But if matter is infinitely divisible, then one can never\narrive at the simple unities that must exist at some ontological ground\nlevel. Second, if matter is simply extension, then there is in its\nnature no source of activity. If this is so, Leibniz thought, then the\nbodily objects of the world cannot count as substances.\n\n\nHobbes and Spinoza, despite their own differences, advanced, or were\nread as advancing, a number of objectionable and deeply troubling\ntheses which Leibniz (and most of his contemporaries) saw as an\nenormous threat: materialism, atheism, and necessitarianism. It is\nLeibniz's response to Hobbesian and Spinozistic necessitarianism\nthat is perhaps of greatest interest, for he sought to develop an\naccount of action and contingency that would preserve divine and human\nfreedom. As will be shown, central to Leibniz's philosophy was\nthe view that God freely chose the best world from an infinite number\nof possible worlds and that a person could be said to act freely when\nthe contrary of that action does not imply a contradiction. (This topic\nwill be addressed principally in the article on Leibniz's Modal\nMetaphysics.)\n",
