    "main_text": "Logic and Philosophy of logic || Good reasons and the triple criterion\n3.1 Good reasons and the triple criterion\n\nSince T. Stcherbatsky\u2019s two volume study and translation of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Ny\u0101yabindu, entitled Buddhist\nLogic (i.e., Stcherbatsky 1930/32), one often sees the Buddhist\ntheory of reasons/indices designated as \u201clogic,\u201d a term\nthat sometimes has the unwanted effect of leading readers to think\nthat good reasons for Buddhists are simply those that are formally\nvalid. In fact, the notion of formal validity (i.e., the conclusion\u2019s\nbeing guaranteed true, provided the premises are true) is not\nitself explicitly discussed by Buddhist\ntheoreticians; it is in any case not distinguished from other, more\ninformal, considerations. Instead of formally valid reasons, Buddhist\ntheoreticians developed the notion of a good reason\n(saddhetu, Tibetan rtags yang dag), i.e., one which\nsatisfies a triple criterion (trair\u016bpya). These three\ncriteria for \u201cgoodness\u201d are given in the following fashion\nfrom Dharmak\u012brti on:\n\npak\u1e63adharmatva (the logical reason\u2019s being a\nproperty of the subject): the subject A is ascertained\n(ni\u015bcita) as having the property C;\nanvayavy\u0101pti (pervasion [that is formulated] as\nco-presence ): C is ascertained as present in only instances\nthat are similar (sapak\u1e63a) to A insofar as\nthey possess B;\nvyatirekavy\u0101pti (pervasion [formulated] as\nco-absence): C is ascertained as wholly absent from instances\ndissimilar (vipak\u1e63a) to A insofar as they do\nnot possess\n B.[50]\n\n\nTrue, in texts like the Hetucakra of Dign\u0101ga (which was\ntaken up in detail by Dharmak\u012brti in\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika IV and\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya III), a version of the\ntriple criterion (trair\u016bpya) for good reasons and the\noperators \u201cpartial presence,\u201d \u201ccomplete\npresence,\u201d and \u201ccomplete absence\u201d were correlated to\nyield a series of nine types of reasons, types that are\nabstracted from content and subject matter. Not inappropriately, the\ngreat historian of logic, Innocentius Boche\u0144ski, in the chapter\non Indian Logic in his History of Formal Logic, stated that\nthe Hetucakra thus suggested an awareness of formal\nconsiderations. R.S.Y. Chi, in his Buddhist Formal Logic (Chi\n1984), went several steps further and attempted to show that the\nHetucakra, taken in its formal aspects, might present a\nnumber of interesting features to a modern logician. That being said,\nthere is certainly much more to \u201cgood reasons\u201d satisfying\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s triple criterion than simple formal validity. The\nterm \u201cascertained\u201d (ni\u015bcita), when unpacked\nby Dharmak\u012brti and his commentators, demands that good reasons\nmust be sound (i.e., the premises must in fact be true and the\nconclusion must follow from them), that their three characteristics\nmust be ascertained, and that the opponent have the appropriate\n\u201cdesire to know\u201d (jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101)\nsomething new that he does not already know. This latter demand leads\nto a host of other requirements: in order to be convinced of something\nnew the opponent must have the requisite doubt, understand the terms\nand accept the subject of debate. In short, good reasons involve\nformal considerations (what follows from what?); factual\nconsiderations (what is so? what is true?); epistemic considerations\n(what needs to be known in order for people to genuinely know\nsomething else? when is doubt possible?); and what can be termed\n\u201crhetorical considerations\u201d (what is newly convincing to\nwhom? when does the debate have a point and when does it fall flat?).\nThe weighting of these aspects in the theory of the \u201ctriple\ncriterion\u201d changes over history in complex fashions. At certain\npoints what were factual matters become epistemic matters, and this\neven leads to interesting reorientations of the triple\n criterion.[51]\n",
