    "main_text": "Testing models || Criteria\n5.2 Scope of Cosmological Theories and Data\n\nFinally, a key issue is what scope do we expect our theories to have.\nEllis (2017) makes a distinction between Cosmology, which is\nthe physically based subject dealt with in the textbooks listed in\nthis article, dealing with the expansion of the universe, galaxies,\nnumber counts, background radiation, and so on, and\nCosmologia, where one takes all that as given but adds in\nconsideration about the meaning this all has for life. Clearly the\nanthropic discussions mentioned above are a middle\n ground.[60]\n However a number of popular science books by major scientists are\nappearing that make major claims about Cosmologia, based purely in\narguments from fundamental physics together with astronomical\nobservations. We will make just one remark about this here. If one is\ngoing to consider Cosmologia seriously, it is incumbent on one to take\nseriously the full range of data appropriate to that enterprise. That\nis, the data needed for the attempted scope of such a theory must\ninclude data to do with the meaning of life as well as data derived\nfrom telescopes, laboratory experiments, and particle colliders. It\nmust thus include data about good and evil, life and death, fear and\nhope, love and pain, writings from the great philosophers and writers\nand artists who have lived in human history and pondered the meaning\nof life on the basis of their life experiences. This is all of great\nmeaning to those who live on Earth (and hence in the Universe). To\nproduce books saying that science proves there is no purpose in the\nuniverse is pure myopia. It just means that one has shut ones eyes to\nall the data that relates to purpose and meaning; and that one\nsupposes that the only science is physics (for psychology and biology\nare full of purpose).\n",
