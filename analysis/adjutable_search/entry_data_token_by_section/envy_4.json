    "main_text": "The Rationality of Envy\n2. The Rationality of Envy\n\nAssessments of the rationality of emotions take various forms. It is\nuseful to distinguish the prudential advisability of emotions (whether they are good for the person who has them) from\ntheir fittingness (roughly, whether the appraisal of circumstances\ninvolved in the emotion is accurate or not). Both of these \nassessments are to be distinguished from various ethical appraisals of\nemotions. Most authors who address the issue seem to agree that envy\nis seldom advisable: insofar as one is able to control or influence\none\u2019s emotions, it is best not to be envious, because envy harms those\nwho feel it. This is sometimes urged simply on the grounds that envy\nis a form of pain, but more often because, in envy, a person\u2019s\nsubjective sense of well-being, self-worth or self-respect is\ndiminished. But if envy involves certain characteristic patterns of\nmotivation, such as a motive to outdo or undo the rival\u2019s advantages,\nthen the advisability of envy may be strongly dependent on the\nadvisability of the actions it motivates. And whether these actions\nare advisable, in turn, depends upon whether they are efficient means\nto the ends at which they aim, and whether those ends are themselves\nin the subject\u2019s interests. Thus an adequate assessment of the\nprudential advisability of envy may well depend on whether the envious\nsubject\u2019s sense that he is worse off because of his rival\u2019s possession\nof the good that he lacks is accurate. If it is accurate, then\nmotivation to change the situation may well be beneficial for the\nSubject. We turn now to issues of accuracy. \n\nIt is commonly supposed that emotions, envy included, involve a way of\ntaking the circumstances\u2014a thought, construal, appraisal, or\nperception of the circumstances\u2014which can then be assessed for\nfittingness (objective rationality) and/or warrant (subjective\n rationality).[11]\n Thus fear can be unfittingly directed at something that isn\u2019t really\ndangerous, or fittingly directed at something that is. And it can be\nunwarrantedly directed at something the subject has good reason to\nbelieve poses no danger, or warrantedly directed at what she has good\nreason to think dangerous\u2014even if that good reason is supplied\nby misleading evidence, so that the object of the emotion is not, in\nfact, dangerous. Similarly, in light of the discussion above, we might\nsay that envy involves thinking that the rival has something good that\nthe subject lacks, and negatively evaluating this difference in\npossession, per se. Each of the various strands in this way of taking\nthe circumstances, then, can be appraised for fittingness and warrant.\nWe will focus on fittingness here, but analogous points can be made in\nterms of warrant. Envy will be unfitting, for instance, if the rival\ndoes not really have the good, or if the \u2018good\u2019 isn\u2019t\nreally good\u2014for instance if the envy is directed at some\npossession that the subject would not really value if he knew its true\nnature. These suggestions are uncontroversial. A more interesting\nquestion concerns the last element in envy\u2019s characteristic appraisal:\nthe negative evaluation of the difference in possession. This too\nmight be thought to be amenable of broadly rational appraisal.\n\nSome philosophers suggest that envy is always or typically irrational,\nand they seem to have in mind the charge that it is\n unfitting.[12]\n Theirs is a restricted version of the Stoic critique of emotions,\naccording to which (roughly) all emotions are unfitting because they\ninvolve taking various worldly things to matter that don\u2019t really\nmatter. Not many contemporary philosophers are attracted to the Stoic\nview of value, which is embedded in an idiosyncratic ancient\ncosmology. But perhaps specific emotions can be convicted of the\nputative mistake, and envy appears to be a likely suspect. If envy\ninvolves taking the difference in possession between subject and rival\nto be bad in itself, then, if such differences are not bad in\nthemselves, envy is systematically unfitting. Developing this charge\ndemands getting clearer about the sense in which envy can be said to\ninvolve taking the difference in possession to be bad in itself.\n\nSuppose that envy includes some desire that the rival not have the\ngood. Then envy may be interpreted so as to involve a preference for\nthe situation in which neither subject nor rival have the good to the\none in which rival has it and subject does\n not.[13]\n Call this the \u201cenvious preference.\u201d The envious\npreference is invoked as a basis for the claim that envy appraises the\nformer situation as better than the latter. But better in what\nrespect? There are a number of possibilities, and we will consider\njust two. First, it might be held to be better, from the point of view\nof the universe (\u201cimpersonally better\u201d for short).\nSecondly, it might be held to be better for the subject.\n\nIf envy holds that the situation in which neither has the good is\nbetter, impersonally, than the one in which Rival has it, this can be\ncriticized as an axiological\n mistake.[14]\n Surely the world is a better place, ceteris paribus, if\nsomeone possesses a given good than if no one does. But this is too\nquick. First, consider cases in which rival has acquired the good by\nwrongdoing. Arguably the world is not a better place when the fortunes\nof some are wrongfully improved. Secondly, an extreme egalitarian may\nhold that inequalities themselves are prima facie bad, because they\nare unjust. On that view, it may sometimes be better that neither\npossesses a given good than that one does. Either of these\nconsiderations might then be invoked as a defense of fittingness of\nenvy. Thus, if envy is interpreted as making a claim about impersonal\nvalue, it will be difficult to prevent moral considerations from\nguiding verdicts about its\n fittingness.[15]\n While this does not completely collapse the distinction between envy\nand resentment, it renders it considerably murkier.\n\nAlternatively, envy can be held to present the difference in\npossession between subject and rival as bad specifically for Subject.\nThis interpretation of envy\u2019s characteristic appraisal is more\nplausible, and it jibes better with the doctrine that envy is not a\nmoral feeling. Envy can nonetheless be criticized as irrational, on\nthis interpretation, for taking something to be bad for Subject that\nis not in fact bad for him. What matters to how well things are going\nfor Subject is a function of what goods Subject has, not what goods\nhis rival has, the critic will suggest. Hence, while the present state\nof affairs is worse for Subject than a situation in which he has the\ngood and Rival lacks it, it is not worse than a situation in which\nneither has the good. So there is no self-interested reason for\nSubject to have the envious preference. Envy is therefore\nsystematically unfitting because it takes something to be bad for the\nsubject that is not in fact bad for him.\n\nThe cogency of this argument for the irrationality of envy depends, of\ncourse, on the plausibility of its claims about well-being. If people\ndo in fact systematically care about the possessions of others, and\nregard themselves as worse or better off accordingly as they stack up\nagainst their selected comparison class, some subjectivist accounts\nwill license taking this concern as itself a part of these subjects\u2019\nwell-being\u2014in which case, some envy will be fitting. Whereas\nmost objective accounts of well-being either treat it as a measure of\nprimary goods, or supply content restrictions on the desires whose\nsatisfaction contributes to well-being which would exclude desires\nlike the envious preference. One recent defense of the claim that envy\nis sometimes fitting relies on the idea that being excellent in\nvarious domains of human achievement contributes to well-being and yet\nis essentially a comparative matter (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson, 2005). If\nsuch excellences, or other positional goods, are granted to contribute\nin themselves to well-being, then it appears that envy will be fitting\nwhenever a rival\u2019s diminution with respect to the relevant positional\ngood improves the Subject\u2019s position.\n",
