    "main_text": "Is Every Physical System Computational? || Limited Pancomputationalism\n3.3 Limited Pancomputationalism\n\nLimited pancomputationalism is much weaker than its unlimited cousin.\nIt holds that every physical system performs one (or relatively few)\ncomputations. Which computations are performed by a given system is\ndeemed to depend on objective properties of that system. In fact,\nseveral authors who have mounted detailed responses to unlimited\npancomputationalism explicitly endorse limited pancomputationalism\n(Chalmers 1996, 331, Scheutz 1999, 191).\n\nUnlike unlimited pancomputationalism, limited pancomputationalism does\nnot turn the claim that something is computational into a vacuous one.\nDifferent systems generally have different objective properties; thus,\naccording to limited pancomputationalism, different systems generally\nperform different computations. Nevertheless, it may seem that limited\npancomputationalism still trivializes the claim that a system is\ncomputational. For according to limited pancomputationalism, digital\ncomputers perform computations in the same sense in which rocks,\nhurricanes, and planetary systems do. This seems at odds with computer\nscience and engineering, as well as the computational theory of\ncognition. If every physical process is a computation, computer\nscience would have to include every physical process in its domain of\ninquiry, and the computational theory of cognition\u2014which was\nmotivated in part by the idea that cognition is distinctively\nexplained by computation\u2014loses much of its explanatory\nforce.\n\nAnother objection to limited pancomputationalism begins with the\nobservation that any moderately complex system satisfies indefinitely\nmany objective computational descriptions (Piccinini 2010). This may\nbe seen by considering computational modeling. A computational model\nof a system may be constructed at higher or lower resolutions. For\nexample, cellular automata models of the dynamics of a galaxy or a\nbrain may be described using different state transition rules,\ndifferent time steps, different numbers of states-per-cell that\nrepresent spatial regions of different sizes, etc. Furthermore, an\nindefinite number of other formalisms, such as TMs, can be used to\ncompute the same functions computed by cellular automata. It appears\nthat limited pancomputationalists are committed to the claim that\ngalaxies or brains perform all these computations at once. But that\ndoes not appear to be the sense in which computers (or brains) perform\ncomputations.\n\nIn the face of these objections, limited pancomputationalists are\nlikely to maintain that the explanatory force of computational\nexplanations does not come from the claim that a system is\ncomputational simpliciter. Rather, explanatory force comes from the\nspecific computations that a system is said to perform. Thus,\nwhile a rock and a digital computer both perform computations, the\nfact that they perform radically different computations explains the\ndifference between them. As to the objection that there are still too\nmany computations performed by each system, limited\npancomputationalists have two main options: either to bite the bullet\nand accept that every system implements indefinitely many\ncomputations, or to find a way to single out, among the many\ncomputational descriptions satisfied by each system, the one that is\nontologically privileged\u2014the one that captures the\ncomputation performed by the system. One way to do this is to\npostulate a fundamental physical level, whose most accurate\ncomputational description identifies the (most fundamental)\ncomputation performed by the system. This response is built into the\nview that the physical world is fundamentally computational (explored\nin the next section).\n\nThose who desire to avoid limited pancomputationalism shift to more\nrestrictive accounts of computation, analogously to how the desire to\navoid unlimited pancomputationalism motivates the shift from the\nsimple mapping account to more restrictive accounts of computation,\nsuch as the causal account. The semantic account may be able to\nrestrict genuine computational descriptions to fewer systems than the\ncausal account, provided that representations\u2014which are needed\nfor computation according to the semantic account\u2014are hard to\ncome by. Mutatis mutandis, the same is true of the syntactic and\nmechanistic accounts.\n",
