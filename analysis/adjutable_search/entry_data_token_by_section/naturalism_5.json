    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Conscious Properties and Closure Arguments\n1.6 Conscious Properties and Closure Arguments\nSome philosophers take there to be compelling arguments against the\nview that conscious states are metaphysically constituted by\nphysical states. This rejection of physicalism about conscious properties certainly\nhas the backing of intuition. (Don\u2019t zombies\u2014beings who\nare physically exactly like humans but have no conscious\nlife\u2014intuitively seem metaphysically possible?) However,\nwhether this intuition can be parlayed into a sound argument is a\nhighly controversial issue, and one that lies beyond the scope of\nthis entry.  A majority of contemporary philosophers probably hold\nthat physicalism can resist these\narguments.[8]\nBut a significant minority take the other side.\nThis minority has a number of options. One is to hold that conscious properties are \"epiphenomenal\" and do not exert any influence on brain processes or subsequent behaviour (Jackson 1982, 1986; Chalmers\n1996).[9] Another is to embrace the \"overdeterminationist\" view that the physical results of conscious causes are always strongly overdetermined , both by their normal physical antecedents and by the metaphysically independent conscious causes (Mellor 1995, Kroedel 2015). Still, neither of these positions is attractive. They require us to posit odd causal structures, either involving a species of effects that are never themselves causes, or a species of effects that are always strongly overdetermined. Given that nature displays no other examples of such causal structures, general principles of theory choice would seem to argue against both epiphenomenalism and overdeterminationism.\nIn consequence, a yet further option has become increasingly popular among those who are persuaded that consciousness must transcend the physical realm. This is the Russellian monist option that locates conscious properties among the basic categorical properties that play the dispositional roles described by physical science. This option has the virtues of separating consciousness from the world described by physics without positing any special causal structures operating in the brain (Alter and Pereboom 2019).\nIt is an interesting question whether Russellian monism is necessarily opposed to physicalism rather than a special case of it (Montero 2015, Brown 2017). In any case, we should note that Russellian monism is designed to conform to the causal (or determinational) closure of the physical realm, as indeed are epiphenomenalism and overdeterminationism. It is striking that nearly all contemporary views of the mind-brain relations are naturalist at least to the extent that they respect this closure thesis. Strongly interactionist views that allow the conscious mind to make an independent difference to the physical world have few defenders nowadays (but see Lowe 2000, 2003; Steward 2015).\n",
