    "main_text": "The Nature of Trust and Trustworthiness || Motives-based theories\n1.1 Motives-based theories\n\nPhilosophers who endorse this type of theory differ in terms of what\nkind of motive they associate with trustworthiness. For some, it is\nself-interest, while for others, it is goodwill or an explicitly moral\nmotive, such as moral integrity or\n virtue.[4]\n\nFor example, Russell Hardin defines trustworthiness in terms of\nself-interest in his \u201cencapsulated interests\u201d account\n(2002). He says that trustworthy people are motivated by their own\ninterest to maintain the relationship they have with the trustor,\nwhich in turn encourages them to encapsulate the interests of that\nperson in their own interests. In addition, trusting people is\nappropriate when we can reasonably expect them to encapsulate our\ninterests in their own, an expectation which is missing with mere\nreliance.\n\nHardin\u2019s theory may be valuable in explaining many different\ntypes of trust relationships, including those between people who can\npredict little about one another\u2019s motives beyond where their\nself-interest lies. Still, his theory is problematic. To see why,\nconsider how it applies to a sexist employer who has an interest in\nmaintaining relationships with women employees, who treats them\nreasonably well as a result, but whose interest stems from a desire to\nkeep them around so that he can daydream about having sex with them.\nThis interest conflicts with an interest the women have in not being\nobjectified by their employer. At the same time, if they were not\naware of his daydreaming\u2014say they are not\u2014then he can\nignore this particular interest of theirs. He can keep his\nrelationships with them going while ignoring this interest and\nencapsulating enough of their other interests in his own. And this\nwould make him trustworthy on Hardin\u2019s account. But is he\ntrustworthy? The answer is \u201cno\u201d or at least the women\nthemselves would say \u201cno\u201d if they knew the main reason for\ntheir employment. The point is that being motivated by a desire to\nmaintain a relationship (the central motivation of a trustworthy\nperson on the encapsulated interests view) may not require one to\nadopt all of the interests of the trustor that would actually make one\ntrustworthy to that person. In the end, the encapsulated interests\nview seems to describe only reliability, not trustworthiness. The\nsexist employer may reliably treat the women well, because of his\ninterest in daydreaming about them, but he is not trustworthy because\nof why he treats them well.\n\nA different type of theory is what Jones calls a\n\u201cwill-based\u201d account, which finds trustworthiness only\nwhere the trustee is motivated by goodwill (Jones 1999: 68). This view\noriginates in the work of Annette Baier and is influential, even\noutside of moral philosophy (e.g., in bioethics and law, especially\nfiduciary law; see, e.g., Pellegrino and Thomasma 1993, O\u2019Neill\n2002, and Fox-Decent 2005). According to it, a trustee who is\ntrustworthy will act out of goodwill toward the trustor, to what or to\nwhom the trustee is entrusted with, or both. While many readers might\nfind the goodwill view problematic\u2014surely we can trust people\nwithout presuming their goodwill!\u2014it is immune to a criticism\nthat applies to Hardin\u2019s theory and also to risk-assessment\ntheories. The criticism is that they fail to require that the\ntrustworthy person care about (i.e., feel goodwill towards) the\ntrustor, or care about what the trustor cares about. As we have seen,\nsuch caring appears to be central to a complete account of\ntrustworthiness.\n\nThe particular reason why care may be central is that it allows us to\ngrasp how trust and reliance differ. The above suggested that they\ndiffer because only trust can be betrayed (or at least let down). But\nwhy is that true? Why can trust be betrayed, while mere reliance can\nonly be disappointed? The answer Baier gives is that betrayal is the\nappropriate response to someone on whom one relied to act out of\ngoodwill, as opposed to ill will, selfishness, or habit bred out of\nindifference (1986: 234\u20135; see also Baier 1991). Those who say\nthat trusting could involve relying on people to act instead on\nmotives like ill will or selfishness will have trouble distinguishing\nbetween trust and mere reliance.\n\nWhile useful in some respects, Baier\u2019s will-based account is not\nperfect. Criticisms have been made that suggest goodwill is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for trustworthiness. It is not necessary\nbecause we can trust other people without presuming that they have\ngoodwill (e.g., O\u2019Neill 2002; Jones 2004), as we arguably do\nwhen we put our trust in strangers.\n\nAs well as being unnecessary, goodwill may not be sufficient for\ntrustworthiness, and that is true for at least three reasons. First,\nsomeone trying to manipulate you\u2014a \u201cconfidence\ntrickster\u201d (Baier 1986)\u2014could \u201crely on your goodwill\nwithout trusting you\u201d, say, to give them money (Holton 1994:\n65). You are not trustworthy for them, despite your goodwill, because\nthey are not trusting you but rather are just trying to trick you.\nSecond, basing trustworthiness on goodwill alone cannot explain\nunwelcome trust. We do not always welcome people\u2019s trust,\nbecause trust can be burdensome or inappropriate. When that happens,\nwe object not to these people\u2019s optimism about our goodwill (who would\nobject to that?), but only to the fact that they are counting on us.\nThird, we can expect people to be reliably benevolent toward us\nwithout trusting them (Jones 1996: 10). We can think that their\nbenevolence is not shaped by the sorts of values that for us are\nessential to\n trustworthiness.[5]\n\nCriticisms about goodwill not being sufficient for trustworthiness\nhave prompted revisions to Baier\u2019s theory and in some cases to\nthe development of new will-based theories. For example, in response\nto the first criticism\u2014about the confidence trickster\u2014Zac\nCogley argues that trust involves the belief not simply that the\ntrustee will display goodwill toward us but that this person owes us\ngoodwill (2012). Since the confidence trickster doesn\u2019t believe\nthat their mark owes them goodwill, they don\u2019t trust this\nperson, and neither is this person trustworthy for them. In response\nto the second criticism\u2014the one about unwelcome\ntrust\u2014Jones claims that optimism about the trustee\u2019s\ngoodwill must be coupled with the expectation that the trustee will be\n\u201cfavorably moved by the thought that [we are] counting on\nher\u201d (1996: 9). Jones does that in her early work on trust where\nshe endorses a will-based theory. Finally, in response to the third\nconcern about goodwill not being informed by the sorts of values that\nwould make people trustworthy for us, some maintain that trust\ninvolves an expectation about some shared values, norms, or interests\n(Lahno 2001, 2020; McLeod 2002, 2020; Mullin 2005; Smith 2008). (To be\nclear, this last expectation tends not to be combined with goodwill to\nyield a new will-based theory.)\n\nOne final criticism of will-based accounts concerns how\n\u201cgoodwill\u201d should be interpreted. In much of the\ndiscussion above, it is narrowly conceived so that it involves\nfriendly feeling or personal liking. Jones urges us in her early work\non trust to understand goodwill more broadly, so that it could amount\nto benevolence, conscientiousness, or the like, or friendly\nfeeling (1996: 7). But then in her later work, she worries that by\ndefining goodwill so broadly we\n\n\nturn it into a meaningless catchall that merely reports the presence\nof some positive motive, and one that may or may not even be directed\ntoward the truster. (2012a: 67)\n\n\nJones abandons her own will-based theory upon rejecting both a narrow\nand a broad construal of goodwill. (The kind of theory she endorses\nnow is a trust responsive one; see below.) If her concerns about\ndefining goodwill are valid, then will-based theories are in serious\ntrouble.\n\nTo recapitulate about encapsulated-interest and will-based theories,\nthey say that a trustworthy person is motivated by self-interest or\ngoodwill, respectively. Encapsulated-interest theories struggle to\nexplain how trustworthiness differs from mere reliability, while\nwill-based theories are faced with the criticism that goodwill is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for trustworthiness. Some\nphilosophers who say that goodwill is insufficient develop alternative\nwill-based theories. An example is Cogley\u2019s theory according to\nwhich trust involves a normative expectation of goodwill (2012).\n\nThe field of motives-based theories is not exhausted by\nencapsulated-interest and will-based theories, however. Other\nmotives-based theories include those that describe the motive of\ntrustworthy people in terms of a moral commitment, moral obligation,\nor virtue. To expand, consider that one could make sense of the\ntrustworthiness of a stranger by presuming that the stranger is\nmotivated not by self-interest or goodwill, but by a commitment to\nstand by their moral values. In that case, I could trust a stranger to\nbe decent by presuming just that she is committed to common decency.\nUltimately, what I am presuming about the stranger is moral integrity,\nwhich some say is the relevant motive for trust relations (those that\nare prototypical; see McLeod 2002). Others identify this motive\nsimilarly as moral obligation, and say it is ascribed to the trustee\nby the very act of trusting them (Nickel 2007; for a similar account,\nsee Cohen and Dienhart 2013). Although compelling in some respects,\nthe worry about these theories is that they moralize trust\ninappropriately by demanding that the trustworthy person have a moral\nmotive (see below and also Mullin 2005; Jones 2017).\n\nYet one might insist that it is appropriate to moralize trust or at\nleast moralize trustworthiness, which we often think of as a virtuous\ncharacter trait. Nancy Nyquist Potter refers to the trait as\n\u201cfull trustworthiness\u201d, and distinguishes it from\n\u201cspecific trustworthiness\u201d, which is trustworthiness that\nis specific to certain relationships (and equivalent to the thin sense\nof trustworthiness I have used throughout; 2002: 25). To be fully\ntrustworthy, one must have a disposition to be trustworthy toward\neveryone, according to Potter. Let us call this the\n\u201cvirtue\u201d account.\n\nIt may sound odd to insist that trustworthiness is a virtue or, in\nother words, a moral disposition to be trustworthy (Potter 2002: 25;\nHardin 2002: 32). What disposition exactly is it meant to be? A\ndisposition normally to honor people\u2019s trust? That would be\nstrange, since trust can be unwanted if the trust is immoral (e.g.,\nbeing trusted to hide a murder) or if it misinterprets the nature of\none\u2019s relationship with the trustee (e.g., being trusted to be\nfriends with a mere acquaintance). Perhaps trustworthiness is instead\na disposition to respond to trust in appropriate ways, given\n\u201cwho one is in relation\u201d to the trustor and given other\nvirtues that one possesses or ought to possess (e.g., justice,\ncompassion) (Potter 2002: 25). This is essentially Potter\u2019s\nview. Modeling trustworthiness on an Aristotelian conception of\nvirtue, she defines a trustworthy person as \u201cone who can be\ncounted on, as a matter of the sort of person he or she is, to take\ncare of those things that others entrust to one and (following the\nDoctrine of the Mean) whose ways of caring are neither excessive nor\ndeficient\u201d (her emphasis;\n 16).[6]\n A similar account of trustworthiness as a virtue\u2014an epistemic\none, specifically\u2014can be found in the literature on testimony\n(see Frost-Arnold 2014; Daukas 2006, 2011).\n\nCriticism of the virtue account comes from Karen Jones (2012a). As she\nexplains, if being trustworthy were a virtue, then being untrustworthy\nwould be a vice, but that can\u2019t be right because we can never be\nrequired to exhibit a vice, yet we can be required to be untrustworthy\n(84). An example occurs when we are counted on by two different people\nto do two incompatible things and being trustworthy to the one demands\nthat we are untrustworthy to the other (83). To defend her virtue\ntheory, Potter would have to insist that in such situations, we are\nrequired either to disappoint someone\u2019s trust rather than be\nuntrustworthy, or to be untrustworthy in a specific not a full\n sense.[7]\n\nRather than cling to a virtue theory, however, why not just accept the\nthin conception of trustworthiness (i.e., \u201cspecific\ntrustworthiness\u201d), according to which X is trustworthy\nfor me just in case I can trust X? Two things can be said.\nFirst, the thick conception\u2014of trustworthiness as a\nvirtue\u2014is not meant to displace the thin one. We can and do\nrefer to some people as being trustworthy in the specific or thin\nsense and to others as being trustworthy in the full or thick sense.\nSecond, one could argue that the thick conception explains better than\nthe thin one why fully trustworthy people are as dependable as they\nare. It is ingrained in their character. They therefore must have an\nongoing commitment to being accountable to others, and better still, a\ncommitment that comes from a source that is compatible with\ntrustworthiness (i.e., virtue as opposed to mere self-interest).\n\nAn account of trustworthiness that includes the idea that\ntrustworthiness is a virtue will seem ideal only if we think that the\ngenesis of the trustworthy person\u2019s commitment matters. If we\nbelieve, like risk-assessment theorists, that it matters only whether,\nnot how, the trustor will be motivated to act, then we could assume\nthat ill will can do the job as well as a moral disposition. Such\ncontroversy explains how and why motives-based and risk-assessment\ntheories diverge from one another.\n",
