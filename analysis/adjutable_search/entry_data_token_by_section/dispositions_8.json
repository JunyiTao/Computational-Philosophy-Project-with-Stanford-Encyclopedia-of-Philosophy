    "main_text": "The Dispositional/Categorical Distinction || Intrinsic Finks\n2.2 Intrinsic Finks\n\nChoi (2005b) imagines a tricky\ntriangle \\(T_t\\) which has the same intrinsic\nproperties as an ordinary triangle except that it has\nan intrinsic property that would cause it to become\nrectangular if someone starts to count its corners. What\nif \\(T_t\\)\u2019s corners were correctly counted under\nstandard conditions? Given that standard conditions are generally\nthought to\ninvolve \\(T_t\\)\u2019s extrinsic properties\nonly, \\(T_t\\) would become rectangular in virtue\nof one of its own intrinsic properties; as a result, it would not\nelicit the result of three but the result of four. It is therefore not\ntrue that if \\(T_t\\rsquo\\text{s}\\) corners were correctly\ncounted under standard conditions the result would be three. But it is\nintuitively evident that \\(T_t\\) is\ntriangular. From this Choi concludes that \u2018\\(x\\) is\ntriangular\u2019 does not even entail the ceteris\nparibus version of Mellor\u2019s conditional.\n\nOne might suspect, however, that Choi\u2019s thought experiment will\nbackfire on the ground that we can envision an analogous case for\ndispositions: an object \\(S_t\\) only differs from a fragile glass in\nthat the first, not the second, has an intrinsic property\nthat would cause it to lose \\(M\\) if it were struck, where \\(M\\) is\nthe type of microstructure \\(S_t\\) has in common with the fragile\nglass. \\(S_t\\) does not satisfy the counterfactual conditional that it\nwould break if struck under the standard conditions. But is \\(S_t\\)\nnot supposed to have almost all intrinsic properties in common with a\nfragile glass, most importantly, the microstructure \\(M\\)? This might\nlead one to think that \\(S_t\\) is fragile, from which it follows that\neven the ascription of fragility does not entail the\ncorresponding counterfactual conditional. In response, though, Choi\n(2005b, pp. 499\u2013502, 2012) urges that \\(S_t\\) is not\nfragile.  He has thus defended (a ceteris paribus version of)\nEntailment from Mellor\u2019s objections by\ninvoking intrinsically finkish properties.\n\nHandfield (2008b) gives an insightful angle to Choi\u2019s thought\nexperiment. Let\u2019s say that a property putatively considered to be\ndispositional is intrinsically finkable or not depending on whether or\nnot an object can co-instantiate it along with\nan intrinsic property that would remove it should\nthe stimulus condition be present. Then Handfield suggests that the\ncore idea of Choi\u2019s thought experiment is that dispositional\nproperties are not intrinsically finkable but categorical properties\nare.\n\nAt least some dispositions\nare extrinsically finkable. Martin\u2019s examples can\nbe understood to show that the dispositional property of being live is\nextrinsically finkable. We can readily get a similar result for\ncategorical properties. Handfield urges, though, that there is a\nglaring contrast between dispositional and categorical properties when\nwe look at intrinsic finks, which is illustrated by Choi\u2019s thought\nexperiment. \\(T_t\\) is triangular but it also\nhas an intrinsic property that would remove its triangularity if its\ncorners were counted. This property serves as an intrinsic fink to\ntriangularity. The case of \\(S_t\\), however, is\nclaimed to show that we cannot devise an analogous case for\ndispositions, which permits the conclusion that fragility is not\nintrinsically finkable\u2014and mutatis\nmutandis for the possibility of intrinsic reverse-finks,\nmaskers, and mimickers. This view has been criticised by Clarke (2008,\n2010), Fara (2008), Everett (2009), Ashwell (2010), Kittle (2015),\nTugby (2016), and Bird (manuscript), though.\n\nChoi (2012, 2017a, 2017b) addresses some of their criticisms. This\nissue is importantly relevant to many other issues such as\nKripke-Wittgenstein rule-following puzzle (Martin & Heil 1998;\nHandfield & Bird 2008; Cheng 2010; Schlosser 2011), the principle\nof alternate possibilities (Cohen & Handfield 2007), the nature of\ndesires (Ashwell 2014, 2017), and so on.\n",
