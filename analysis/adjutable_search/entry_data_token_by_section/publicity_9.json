    "main_text": "Rawls on Public Reason and Public Rules || The Doctrine of Public Rules\n3.2 The Doctrine of Public Rules\nWhereas the doctrine of public reason restricts the reasons to which we may appeal, the doctrine of public rules regulates the character of the requirements that principles of justice may produce.[65] More specifically, it states that we have weighty reasons to prefer principles of justice that can serve as a public standard, in the senses that they are (i) not self-effacing; and yield demands (ii) that are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and (iii) compliance with which is sufficiently verifiable to others (Rawls 1996: 66\u201367; Rawls 1999a: 48\u201349; see also Williams 1998: 233). We explain each of these properties in turn.\nFirst, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they are not self-effacing\u2014that is, only if the success of the principles from which the rules derive does not depend upon some citizens being ignorant of these principles, or upon some citizens being ignorant of others\u2019 knowledge of these principles (see \u00a71.3.1). In other words, the idea of publicity requires mutual knowledge, and not mere general knowledge (see \u00a71.1). In clarifying what he means by a public system of rules, Rawls writes,\n\nI mean then that everyone engaged in it knows what he would know if these rules and his participation in the activity they define were the result of an agreement\u2026 He also knows that the others know this and that they know that he knows this, and so on (1999a: 48).[66]\n\nSecond, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they provide sufficiently determinate and accessible standards of moral permissibility, such that a \u201cperson taking part in an institution knows what the rules demand of him\u201d (Rawls 1999a: 48). This has two components. First, principles pass the test of determinacy only if they are not so vague that they are incapable of producing clear directives.[67] Second, principles pass the test of accessibility not merely when citizens can attain knowledge of how they would be required to act if they were to have the relevant empirical information, but instead only if citizens are in fact able to attain knowledge of that empirical information (Rawls 1996: 182; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008: 41).\nThird, principles of justice provide a public standard only if compliance with their demands is sufficiently verifiable to others. For Rawls, what matters is not only that \u201cthe institutions of the basic structure are just\u201d but also that \u201ceveryone recognizes this\u201d (1996: 66). This test of verifiable compliance therefore requires the possibility of widespread knowledge of the extent to which citizens discharge their duties. This test is most plausibly understood as an aggregative one. For example, the duty not to litter is verifiable to others in virtue of the fact that we can attain knowledge of the extent to which others on aggregate refrain from littering, even though we may not be able to attain knowledge of the extent to which any given citizen refrains from littering.[68]\nRawls appeals to the doctrine of public rules in order to justify several features of his view, including the idea that the principles of justice should govern the distribution of social primary goods rather than the distribution of welfare. Part of what justifies this verdict is that, because it is not feasible accurately to measure welfare, principles that refer to welfare fail the test of accessibility. Accordingly, these principles \u201crun afoul of the [publicity] constraint\u201d, such that \u201cIn political life citizens cannot sensibly apply or follow it\u201d (Rawls 1996: 182 n. 11; Rawls 1999b: 13 n. 3). Because of this, principles of justice that govern the distribution of welfare abrogate their chief purpose, which is \u201cto provide a publicly recognized point of view from which all citizens can examine before one another whether their political and social institutions are just\u201d (Rawls 1996: 9).\nIn the same vein, Andrew Williams writes,\n\n\u2026we have reason to reject conceptions of justice which, given the fact of limited information, are too epistemically demanding to be public and stable. We should, like Rawls, favour conceptions whose scope is restricted to publicly accessible phenomena (1998: 245).\n\nAn implication of the doctrine of public rules, therefore, is that we have reasons to object to highly epistemically demanding principles of justice that fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or verifiable compliance. As an example of this, let us consider G. A. Cohen\u2019s claim that justice requires citizens to internalize an egalitarian ethos that condemns self-serving behaviour and, subject to a personal prerogative and special labour burdens, requires citizens to be guided by a concern for the least advantaged when making occupational choices (2008: part 1). Rejecting this possibility on the grounds that it violates the doctrine of public rules, Williams writes that\n\nit is quite possible that, in typical cases, we will lack a sufficiently precise public standard by which to justify, or criticize, each other\u2019s self-serving behavior (1998: 240).\n\nThis is because, in order to calculate whether a citizen is acting in accordance with the demands with the egalitarian ethos, we would need to know which occupation available to her best serves the interests of the least advantaged, as well as whether her choice to pursue an alternative occupation would be protected by either her personal prerogative or a concern for special labour burdens.\nThe success of Williams\u2019s reply to Cohen depends partly upon the existence of weighty reasons to endorse the doctrine of public rules. For this reason, we shall now turn our attention to the various arguments in defence of this doctrine. In particular, we highlight three distinct justifications, each of which corresponds to an argument in defence of the doctrine of public reason.\nThe Political Autonomy Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules by appeal to its role in protecting political autonomy (Williams 1998: 244). If citizens have no clear sense of what the principles of justice demand of them, then they lack awareness of the moral constraints to which they are subject, and so are prevented from freely identifying with those constraints. A similar threat to political autonomy arises when principles of justice fail the test of verifiable compliance. If citizens are freely to identify with the constraints to which they are subject, it is important that they can recognise these constraints as a product of others\u2019 compliance with principles of justice.\nThe second justification is the Civic Friendship Argument, according to which we should uphold the doctrine of public rules because of the role it plays in realising civic friendship (Williams 1998: 244). According to this view, civic friendship can exist within a society only when citizens are able justifiably to regard themselves and others (and justifiably be regarded by themselves and others) as doing what is necessary to sustain reasonably fair terms of social cooperation. Publicity facilitates each of these ends. Just as members of an orchestra are denied a common good when they cannot hear, or otherwise appreciate, their own or others\u2019 contributions to their joint performance, so too citizens are denied the good of civic friendship when they are denied awareness of their own or others\u2019 compliance with the principles of justice.\nFinally, the Stability Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules on the grounds that its acceptance enhances \u201cthe long-term probability of a society conforming with its conceptions of justice\u201d (Williams 1998: 244). Again, this instrumental argument relies upon the alleged psychological fact that citizens are more likely to support principles and institutions that they perceive as just (Rawls 1996: 140\u20134). This supports the doctrine of public rules insofar as citizens are more likely to perceive principles and institutions as just when the demands of justice are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and compliance with them is sufficiently verifiable to others (for objections: Caney 1995; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008: 45\u201346).\n",
