Of course,\nmany non-Marxist thinkers\u2014including Ricardo, Weber, Durkheim,\nand Bourdieu\u2014also utilise some idea of class, but it is\ntypically conceptualised differently, and allocated a less important\nrole in their social theory. For Marxists, class is standardly defined\nin an \u201cobjective\u201d manner, and designates the social\nposition occupied by individuals within a network of relations of\nproduction. Indeed, an objective account is necessary if certain\nMarxist claims about the ways in which class conditions and shapes\n\u201cconsciousness, culture, or politics\u201d are to be sustained\n(G. Cohen 1978: 73). And class, so understood, typically plays a\ncrucial explanatory part in Marxist accounts of, variously: the\ncharacter of, and development between, historical epochs; the\ninstitutional form, and behaviour, of the state; and many of the\nbeliefs, and actions, of individual and collective agents.\n\nClass is a recurring topic in analytical Marxist writings. Examples\ninclude: Wright\u2019s account of the \u201cmiddle class \u201d;\nPrzeworski\u2019s analysis of the class basis of social democracy\n(1985); Roemer\u2019s discussion of the relationship between class\nposition and exploitation status (1982); and Alan Carling\u2019s game\ntheoretic portrayal of relations between men and women as class\nrelations (1991: 253\u2013299). This section outlines some aspects of\nthe first of those examples.\n\nWright has written at least five books on the subject, changed his\nviews over time, and collaborated in extensive empirical work using\nmodern sample survey methodology and multivariate statistical\ntechniques across countries (Wright 1989). This section only touches\non: the Marxist character of Wright\u2019s view of class structure;\nhis early response to the problem of \u201cthe middle class\u201d;\nand his revised understanding of the relation between exploitation and\nclass.\n\nWright identifies six \u201cconceptual constraints\u201d that\ndiverse Marxist approaches to class\u2014including his\nown\u2014typically respect (1985: 26\u201337). First, that the class\nstructure of a society is the \u201cbasic\u201d determinant (1985:\n28) of the limits of possible variation in class formations, class\nconsciousness, and class struggle. Second, that class structures\nconstitute the central organising principle of societies, shaping the\npossible variations of \u201cthe state, ethnic relations, gender\nrelations, etc.\u201d, and offering the best way of identifying\nhistorical epochs (1985: 31). Third, that the concept of class is a\nrelational one, classes are defined within social relations, and\nespecially by their relation to other classes (to be a feudal serf,\nfor instance, is to stand in a certain relation to a feudal lord).\nFourth, that the social relations which define classes are\nintrinsically antagonistic; that is, classes have conflicting\ninterests, between which compromise or accommodation\u2014but not\nharmony\u2014is possible. Fifth, that the objective basis of those\nantagonistic relations is exploitation (Marxists do not, for instance,\nmerely claim that lords are rich and serfs are poor, but insist rather\nthat the former are rich because they appropriate a surplus produced\nby the latter). Sixth, and finally, that the fundamental basis of\nexploitation is located in the social organisation of production,\nnotwithstanding disagreements about how to locate classes within\nrelations of production (whether, for instance, ideology, property,\ncontrol, or something else, are crucial). The last four of these\nconstraints can be said to elaborate the structural properties of the\nMarxist concept of class.\n\nWright\u2019s best-known early contribution to class\nanalysis\u2014his model of \u201ccontradictory class\nlocations\u201d\u2014is preoccupied with theorising the class\ncharacter of \u201cthe middle class\u201d within a Marxist\nframework. The context here is the seeming tension between modern\nhistorical developments and the classical Marxist idea of capitalist\nsociety as increasingly composed of two hostile camps (capitalists and\nproletarians) with any third class (the\n\u201cpetit-bourgeoisie\u201d) as \u201ctransitional\u201d in\nnature (on its way to being squeezed out by the other two). That claim\nabout a pervasive tendency towards class polarisation would appear to\nconflict with the huge growth of professional, managerial, technical,\nand bureaucratic positions, in both modern corporations and modern states\n(Wright 1985: 7\u20139). The resulting \u201cproblem of the middle\nclass\u201d raises issues, not only about the accuracy of received\nMarxist accounts of class structure, but also about the sociological\nplausibility of their associated accounts of class formation, class\nconsciousness, and class struggle (since these newer groups do not\nobviously share the interests and attitudes of traditional\nproletarians).\n\nWright rejects Marxist responses which either deny the gap between the\npolarisation account and empirical reality, or assimilate these new\nsocial groups to the petit-bourgeoisie. Instead, his own early\napproach abandons the assumption that the class locations of\nindividuals are mapped in a one-to-one relation to the actual class\nstructure of capitalism. Rather than assuming that individuals are\nonly ever capitalist, petit-bourgeois, or proletarian, Wright suggests\nthat some occupy positions that have \u201ca multiple class\ncharacter; they may be in more than one class simultaneously\u201d\n(1985: 43). Those individuals occupy \u201ccontradictory class\nlocations\u201d; or, more precisely, \u201ccontradictory locations\nwithin contradictory class relations\u201d.\n\nWright\u2019s earliest attempts to operationalise this increasingly\ndifferentiated account of the class structure of contemporary\ncapitalism focuses on whether individuals are self-employed, and\nwhether they supervise the labour of others. This resulted in a\nsimplified typology which added \u201cmanagers\u201d to the three\noriginal Marxist classes (capitalists, petit-bourgeoisie, and\nproletariat). His subsequent work further differentiated these new\nsocial groups on the basis of the extent of individual control (full,\npartial, minimal, or none) over money capital, physical capital, and\nlabour within production. The resulting contradictory class locations\nnow included: managers (simultaneously bourgeois and proletarian);\nnon-managerial technical/professional staff (simultaneously\npetty-bourgeois and proletarian); and small employers (simultaneously\nbourgeois and petty-bourgeois). By 1979, Wright had a schematic\ntypology that added five contradictory class locations to the three\noriginal Marxist classes (Wright 1985: 48 figure 2.2).\n\nAfter 1979, Wright\u2019s account evolved significantly in response\nto criticisms, especially from Roemer. Wright now criticised his own\nearlier view for emphasising domination, and downplaying exploitation.\nExploitation is understood here as diagnosing the ways in which income\ninequalities are generated by inequalities in rights and powers over\nproductive resources; that is, the ways in which: \n\n\nexploiters, by virtue of their exclusionary rights and powers over\nresources, are able to appropriate surplus generated by the efforts of\nthe exploited. (Wright 2005b: 17) \n\n\nThis new account resulted in a typology in which ownership and\nnon-ownership of means of production are complicated by effective\ncontrol of \u201corganisation assets\u201d and \u201ccredential\nassets\u201d, both of which can constitute a strategic basis for\ngenerating higher incomes. Some of the resulting class locations are\noccupied by individuals who are both exploited in one dimension\n(because they don\u2019t own or control capital), and exploiters in\nanother (because they can leverage their organisational and credential\nassets in the relevant ways). Wright\u2019s new typology of class\nlocations has twelve categories: three types of owner of means of\nproduction (differentiated by their amount of capital); and nine\nvarieties of wage-earner (differentiated by organisation and\ncredential assets). The latter group contains a wide range of class\nlocations distinct from proletarians proper, including expert\nmanagers, expert non-managers, semi-credentialled supervisors, and\nmore (Wright 1985: 88 table 3.3).\n\nCritics have acknowledged Wright\u2019s theoretical ingenuity, but\nsometimes identified a gradational neo-Weberian account of\nstratification as really doing the work here, only partially concealed\nbehind Marxist rhetoric about exploitation (Mayer 1994: 137). Wright\nconcedes the similarity of appearances here\u2014in particular, the\nshared focus on the ways in which class determines \u201clife\nchances\u201d\u2014but insists on the distinctiveness of the two\ntheoretical frameworks. The Marxist character of his own account is\nsaid to rest on the central role of exploitation\u2014and the\ndistribution of the rights and powers of individuals over productive\nresources\u2014in determining the distribution of income and economic\nactivities (Wright 2005b: 16\u201319).\n\nFinally, Wright also identifies possible continuities with his earlier\nviews. The idea of the \u201cmiddle classes\u201d occupying\n\u201ccontradictory locations\u201d is perhaps preserved in the idea\nof those individuals having interests that conflict with both capital\nand labour (Wright 1985: 87). The relevant groups are like workers in\nthat they are excluded from ownership of the means of production, but\nthey also have interests opposed to workers because of their effective\ncontrol of organisational and credential assets.\n",
