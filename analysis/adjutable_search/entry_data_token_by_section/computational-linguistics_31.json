They may be equipped with large hand-crafted\nscripts (keyword-indexed input-response schemas) that enable them to\nanswer simple inquiries about the company and their products, with some\nability to respond to miscellaneous topics and to exchange greetings\nand pleasantries. A less benign application is the use of chatbots\nposing as visitors to social network sites, or interactive game sites,\nwith the aim of soliciting private information from unwitting human\nparticipants, or recommending websites or products to them. As a\nresult, many social networking sites have joined other bot-targeted\nsites in using CAPTCHAS to foil bot entry.\n\n\nCompanionable dialogue agents (also called relational agents) have\nso far relied rather heavily on chatbot techniques, i.e., authored\ninput patterns and corresponding outputs. But the goal is to transcend\nthese techniques, creating agents (often with talking heads or other\nanimated characters) with personality traits and capable of showing\nemotion and empathy; they should have semantic and episodic memory,\nlearning about the user over the long term and providing services to\nthe user. Those services might include, besides companionship and\nsupport: advice in some areas of life, health and fitness, schedule\nmaintenance, reminders, question answering, tutoring (e.g., in\nlanguages), game playing, and internet services. Yorick Wilks has\nsuggested that ideally such characters would resemble \u201cVictorian\ncompanions\u201d, with such characteristics as politeness, discretion,\nmodesty, cheerfulness, and well-informedness (Wilks 2010).\nHowever, such goals are far from being achieved, as speech\nrecognition, language understanding, reasoning and learning are not\nnearly far enough advanced. As a noteworthy example of the state of\nthe art, we might mention the HWYD (\u201cHow Was Your Day\u201d)\nsystem of Pulman et al.  (2010), which won a best demonstration prize\nat an autonomous agents conference. The natural language processing in\nthis system is relatively sophisticated. Shallow syntactic and\nsemantic processing is used to find instantiations of some 30\n\u201cevent templates\u201d, such as ones for \u201cargument at\nwork between X and Y,\u201d or \u201cmeeting\nwith X about Y\u201d. The interpretation process\nincludes reference and ellipsis resolution, relying on an information\nstate representation maintained by the dialogue manager. Goals\ngenerated by the dialogue manager lead to responses via planning,\nwhich involves instantiation and sequencing of response paradigms. The\nauthors report the system's ability to maintain consistent dialogues\nextending over 20 minutes.\nSystems of a rather different sort, aimed at clinically\nwell-founded health counseling, have been under development as\nwell. For example, the systems described in (Bickmore et\nal. 2011) rely on an extensive, carefully engineered\nformalization of clinically proven counseling strategies and\nknowledge, expressed within a description logic (OWL) and a\ngoal-directed task description language. Such systems have proved to\nperform in a way comparable to human counselors. However, though\ndialogues are plan-driven, they ultimately consist of scripted system\nutterances paired with multiple-choice lists of responses offered to\nthe client.\nThus companionable systems remain very constrained in the dialogue\nthemes they can handle, their understanding of language, and \ntheir ability to bring extensive general knowledge to a conversation,\nlet alone to use such knowledge inferentially.\n",
