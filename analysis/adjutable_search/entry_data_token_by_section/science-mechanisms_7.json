    "main_text": "The Concept of a Mechanism || Philosophical Work to Be Done\n2.6 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nMuch of the early new mechanical philosophy has focused on the\nspecial sciences, such as neuroscience and molecular biology. In the\nyears since, philosophers have extended the mechanistic framework to\nother scientific disciplines, such as cell biology (Bechtel 2006),\ncognitive science (Bechtel 2008; Thagard 2006), neuroeconomics (Craver\nand Alexandrova 2008), organic chemistry (Ramsey 2008), physics\n(Teller 2010), astrophysics (Illari and Williamson 2012), behavior\ngenetics (Tabery 2014a), and phylogenetics (Matthews\nforthcoming). Philosophers continue to test the limits of this\nframework, with the expectation that alternative organizing frameworks\nmight play central roles in other sciences. For example, a debate has\nemerged in the philosophy of biology over whether or not natural\nselection is a mechanism (see, for example, Skipper and Millstein\n2005; Baker 2005; Barros 2008; Illari and Williamson 2012; Havstad\n2011; and Matthewson and Calcott 2011).  Similar debates have emerged\nconcerning mechanistic explanation in cognitive science (Bechtel 2008; Piccinini and Craver 2011; Weiskopf 2011;\nPovich forthcoming).\nOne area that has received particular attention is the effort to\nunderstand computational mechanisms. On some accounts, computational\nmechanisms form a proper subclass of mechanisms that can be defined\nexplicitly in terms of the kinds of entities, properties, and\nactivities involved in mechanisms in that class (Piccinini 2007;\nMilkowski 2013). According to this view, computational mechanisms are\nmechanisms that have the function to manipulate medium independent\nvehicles in accordance with a general rule that applies to all\nvehicles and depends on the inputs for its application (Piccinini and\nScarantino 2011). Digital computers are distinctive in that their\nvehicles are digits (Piccinini 2007). Proponents of this account hope\nto demarcate computing mechanisms from non-computing mechanisms by\nappeal to the distinctive components proprietary to computing\nmechanisms. This view contrasts both with a semantic view, according\nto which computation is essentially a matter of manipulating symbols\nor representations, and with perspectivalist views, according to which\nwhether a mechanism counts as computing is a matter of whether it is\nso described (Churchland 1986; Churchland and Sejnowski 1992; Shagrir\n2010).\nPhilosophers of the social sciences have also emphasized and\ndebated the importance of mechanistic knowledge (e.g., Elster 1989;\nfor a useful review of these connections, see Hedstr\u00f6m and Ylikoski\n2010). In that context, appeals to mechanisms are intended to remedy\nthe relative uninformativeness of social (or macro-level) explanations\nof social phenomena (such as widespread norms, persistent\ninequalities, network and institutional structures) by insisting that\nthese explanations ultimately be grounded in mechanistic details about\nindividual agents and actors, their desires and motivations, and,\nimportantly, their relations to one another. The emphasis on relations\namong actors distances this mechanistic view from methodological\nindividualism (see the entry on \n methodological individualism).\n Mechanists in the social sciences\nhave also tended to shy away from grand, overarching theories and\ntoward more local explanations: scientific knowledge grows by adding\nitems to a toolbox of mechanisms and showing how items from that\ntoolbox can be combined to provide an explanation for a particular\nphenomenon. Frederica Russo (2009) discusses a number of strategies\nfor modeling social mechanisms (see also Little 1991, 1998; Hedstr\u00f6m\n2005; Hedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg 1998).\n",
