    "main_text": "Justification and Beyond || Forgetting\n3.6 Skepticism\n\nMemory fails at times, as we have each experienced. As a result, we\nmight be inclined to inquire into memory\u2019s trustworthiness.\nInquiring may be unnecessary for our having justification. Perhaps\nmemory could provide it as long as there\u2019s no reason to doubt\nits trustworthiness (Moon 2017). Memory is trustworthy, and finding\nthis out is additional evidence in favor of what we believe via\nmemory. But memory still generates or preserves justification prior to\nour inquiry.\n\nOr perhaps if memory is to provide justification for a subject, she\nmust have reason to suppose her memory is trustworthy. It is not\nimmediately obvious what the relevant trustworthiness consists in. It\nmay be a matter of memory functioning in a certain way. And this could\nbe a matter of memory in general being reliable, tending to yield more\ntrue beliefs than false beliefs. A potential reason to suppose memory\nis reliable is that to suggest otherwise is, in a way, self-defeating\n(Locke 1971). To show memory is unreliable, we\u2019d presumably need\nto cite evidence of its failures. But this evidence comes from memory.\nSo if we show memory is unreliable, it is because memory supported\nbelieving something, namely, its own unreliability. So even if it is\nplausible that memory is unreliable, memory supports some\nbelieving.\n\nIt might not matter whether memory in general is reliable.\nPerhaps it just matters whether memory is reliable in the right\ncircumstances or for a certain range of beliefs, or whether a given\nmemory system is reliable, or whether a given memory is likely\ncorrect. An inference to the best explanation argument supports the\nlatter: a given memory, if accurate, can make better sense of why a\nsubject now experiences what that memory predicts she would experience\n(Hasan 2021).\n\nIf memory is to justify certain beliefs it might need to be\ntrustworthy in a different way. It might need to be\nconditionally reliable. Mere reliability is a matter of a\nprocess tending to yield more true beliefs than false beliefs.\nConditional reliability is a process tending to do this when all\nbelief inputs are true. Memory processing could be unreliable, yet\nconditionally reliable. It tends to yield false beliefs, but not when\nthe inputs to it (such as past beliefs) are all true. If, as per one\nsort of preservationism, memory cannot generate justification, it does\nnot seem to matter whether memory is reliable simpliciter. It just\nmatters whether memory is conditionally reliable. Its conditional\nreliability would allow memory to preserve the justification of a past\nbelief, according process reliabilism. Reliability simpliciter does\nnot matter for whether memory preserves justification. Reliability\nsimpliciter does matter for whether memory generates new\njustification, but preservationism (as anti-generativism) denies\nmemory can do this.\n\nInference to the best explanation may also support memory\u2019s\nconditional reliability. That memory is conditionally reliable is part\nof the best explanation of our having doxastic attitudes at all (Frise\n& McCain 2021). Suppose memory functions in a way where it\nsupplies us with doxastic attitudes, such as beliefs. If memory is not\ncreating all these attitudes anew, it is taking some attitudes as\ninputs and later on yielding attitudes as outputs. On the simpler and\nbetter accounts of how memory does this, it minimally changes the\ninput along the way. If there is no or little relevant change, the\nbelief output will have the same truth-value as the input, as it might\neven have the same content. So when all belief inputs to memory are\ntrue, memory tends to yield true beliefs rather than false beliefs. It\nis conditionally reliable.\n\nHowever, even if memory is trustworthy in all ways that matter, the\ntypical person may have an importantly flawed view of how some memory\nsystems work, such that the typical person fails to know via those\nmemory systems (Frise 2022). For instance, our folk understanding of\nepisodic memory fails to appreciate its constructive nature. Leaning\non this folk understanding may imperil knowledge of past events from\nepisodic memory, as it is plausible that a subject cannot know that\np if her justification for believing that p\nessentially depends on a falsehood.\n\nInstead of focusing on memory\u2019s trustworthiness, we might focus\non whether a given belief about the past is correct. Russell (1921)\npoints out that all or nearly all our beliefs about the past could be\nfalse. We might seem to remember various events and facts about what\nhas occurred. But we might have come to exist just five minutes ago.\nThe apparent past is misleading. Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nis similar to skeptical hypotheses concerning other alleged sources of\nknowledge and justification, such as perception. It is no surprise,\nthen, that many responses to Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nparallel responses to skepticism of other sorts (see entry on\n skepticism).\n",
