    "main_text": "\n\nA prominent novelist, Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry (1607\u20131701)\ncomposed a series of dialogues dealing with philosophical issues.\nPrimarily ethical in focus, her dialogues examine the virtues and\nvices proper to the aristocratic society of the period. They also\nexplore questions of moral psychology, in particular the interplay\nbetween temperament and free will. In the area of epistemology,\nScud\u00e9ry analyzes the problem of certitude and self-knowledge.\nTheologically, she defends cosmological arguments demonstrating\nGod\u2019s existence. Her aesthetic theory endorses the mimetic\nthesis concerning art as the imitation of nature but the individuality\nof artistic perception also receives attention. In her philosophical\nspeculation, Scud\u00e9ry stresses questions of gender; the\nrelationship of philosophical theories to the condition of women\nreceives substantial analysis.\n\nLong framed by her critics as a pedantic pr\u00e9cieuse,\nScud\u00e9ry has only recently attracted the interest of\nprofessional philosophers. Critics have dismissed her lengthy novels\nas unreadable, her famous Saturday salon as amateurish, and her\nphilosophical ideas as derivative and confused. In the recent feminist\nexpansion of the canon of humanities, however, another Scud\u00e9ry\nhas appeared. In this reevaluation, the philosophical significance of\nher writings has emerged. Her literary corpus presents a novel version\nof the ancient philosophical method of dialogue; it also expresses\noriginal, sophisticated theories concerning the ethical, aesthetic,\nand theological disputes of early modernity. \n",
