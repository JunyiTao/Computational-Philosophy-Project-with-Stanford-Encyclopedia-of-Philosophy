The small improvement\nargument for the incomparability of the musical career and the legal\ncareer in Raz\u2019s example assumes what Chang calls the\n\u201ctrichotomy thesis.\u201d The trichotomy thesis holds that if\ntwo items can be compared in terms of some value or set of values,\nthen the two items are related by one of the standard trichotomy of\ncomparative relations, \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d or \u201cequally good\u201d (2002b, 660). A number of\nauthors have argued that these three comparative relations do not\nexhaust the space of comparative relations. If they are correct, the\nmusical career and the legal career may, in fact, be comparable.\n\nJames Griffin and Derek Parfit argue that items may in fact be\n\u201croughly equal\u201d and hence comparable (Griffin 1986, 80\u201381,\n96\u201398, and 104; 1997, 38\u201339; 2000, 285\u2013289; Parfit 1987, 431). As an\nillustration, Parfit imagines comparing two poets and a novelist for a\nliterary prize (1987, 431). Neither the First Poet nor the Novelist is\nworse than the other and the Second Poet is slightly better than the\nFirst Poet. If the First Poet and the Novelist were equally good, it\nwould follow that the Second Poet is better than the Novelist. This\njudgment, according to Parfit, need not follow. Instead, the First\nPoet and the Novelist may be roughly equal. The intuition is that even\nthough three items display the respects in virtue of which the\ncomparisons are made, some comparisons are inherently rough so that\neven though two alternatives are not worse than one other, they are\nnot equally good. In turn, the musical and legal careers in\nRaz\u2019s example may be roughly equal. Parfit later referred to\nthis possibility as there being \u201cevaluative imprecision\u201d\n(Parfit 2016, 113).\n\n\u201cRoughly equal,\u201d as used here, is to be distinguished from\ntwo other ways in which the term has been used: (1) to refer to a\nsmall difference in value between two items and (2) to refer to a\nchoice of little significance (Raz 1986, 333). As used here, two items\nA and B are said to be roughly equal if neither is worse than the\nother and C\u2019s being better than B does not imply that C is\nbetter than A when the comparisons are all in virtue of the same set\nof respects.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether \u201croughly equal\u201d is in\nfact a fourth comparative relation to be considered in addition to the\nthree standard relations, \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d and \u201cequally good.\u201d One way to conceive of\n\u201croughly equal\u201d is as a \u201croughed up\u201d version\nof \u201cequally good.\u201d On this interpretation, the trichotomy\nthesis basically holds; there are simply precise and rough versions\n(Chang 2002b, 661, fn. 5). Furthermore, \u201croughly equal\u201d is\na relation that can be defined only in virtue of three items, and as\nsuch, appears to be something distinct from a standard comparative\nrelation. The standard comparative relations are binary; transitivity\nwith respect to them is a separate condition (Hsieh 2005, 195).\n\nA separate proposal for a genuine fourth relationship is Ruth\nChang\u2019s argument for \u201con a par\u201d (Chang 1997; Chang\n2002b). Two items are said to be on a par if neither is better than\nthe other, their differences preclude their being equally good, and\nyet they are comparable. Whereas \u201croughly equal\u201d is\ninvoked to allow for comparability among alternatives that display the\nsame respects (e.g., literary merit), \u201con a par\u201d is\ninvoked to allow for comparability between alternatives that are\ndifferent in the respects that they display. Imagine comparing Mozart\nand Michelangelo in terms of creativity. According to Chang, neither\nMozart nor Michelangelo is less creative than the other. Because the\ntwo artists display creativity in such different fields, however, it\nwould be mistaken to judge them to be equally creative. Nevertheless,\naccording to Chang, they are comparable with respect to creativity.\nSomething can be said about their relative merits with respect to the\nsame consideration. According to Chang, they are on a par.\n\nChang\u2019s argument relies on invoking a continuum that resembles\nBroome\u2019s standard configuration. Chang asks us to imagine a\nsequence of sculptors who are successively worse than Michelangelo\nuntil we arrive at a sculptor who is clearly worse than Mozart in\nterms of creativity. Chang then brings to bear the intuition that\n\u201cbetween two evaluatively very different items, a small\nunidimensional difference cannot trigger incomparability where before\nthere was comparability\u201d (2002b, 673). In the light of this\nintuition, because Mozart is comparable to this bad sculptor, Mozart\nis also comparable to each of the sculptors in the sequence, including\nMichelangelo. The soundness of this so-called Chaining Argument has,\nhowever, been questioned (Boot 2009; Elson 2014a; Andersson\n2016a).\n\nWhether \u201croughly equal\u201d or \u201con a par\u201d imply\ncomparability is a matter of some debate. \u201cRoughly equal\u201d\nand \u201con a par,\u201d for example, are intransitive, so to\nrecognize them as distinct comparative relations would require us to\nreconsider the transitivity of comparative relations (Hsieh 2007).\nSome authors suggest that one of the three standard comparative\nrelations obtains between all items that are claimed to be\nincomparable, roughly equal, or on a par (Regan 1997). In the case of\n\u201con a par,\u201d Joshua Gert and Erik Carlson have argued that\nit can be defined in terms of the three standard comparative relations\n(Gert 2004; 2015; Carlson 2010). Gert\u2019s suggestion is developed\nfurther by Wlodek Rabinowicz who provides a Fitting Attitudes account\nof value relations (Rabinowicz 2008; 2012). The Fitting Attitudes\naccount typically analyzes goodness in terms of a normative component\nand an attitudinal component. By acknowledging that there can be two\nlevels of normativity, requirement and permissibility, the account\nleaves room for both parity and standard value relations. X is\nbetter than Y if and only if it is rationally required to\nprefer X to Y, and X and Y are on a par if\nand only if it is rationally permissible to prefer X to\nY and also rationally permissible to prefer Y to\nX. Interestingly, preferences and the lack of preferences\ntogether with the two levels of normativity can be combined in 15\ndifferent ways. This means that the fitting attitudes analysis\nprovides the conceptual space for 15 possible value relations.\n\nAnother view is that values can be \u201cclumpy,\u201d meaning that\nthe values sort items into clumps. According to this view, once we\nrecognize the way in which the relation \u201cequally good\u201d\nfunctions in the context of clumpy values, items that appear to\nrequire \u201croughly equal\u201d or \u201con a par\u201d can be\njudged equally good (Hsieh 2005).\n",
