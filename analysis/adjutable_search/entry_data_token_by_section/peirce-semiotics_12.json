The Final Account: 1906\u201310\n\nDuring the last part of his life the majority of Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophical output concerned semiotic, and he developed his account\nof signs far beyond the 1903 theory. There seem to be two reasons for\nthis. First, Peirce was geographically and intellectually isolated and\nhis main outlet was correspondence with the English woman, Lady\nVictoria Welby. Welby wrote on various philosophical topics and shared\nPeirce\u2019s interests in signs and meaning. This seems to have given\nPeirce a willing and sympathetic audience for his developing ideas on\nsigns. (See Hardwick 1977 and Borges 2013 for more on the\nPeirce/Welby correspondence). The second reason seems to have\nbeen his growing appreciation of the connections between the semiotic\nprocess and the process of inquiry. Peirce always thought of his\nphilosophy in a systematic and architectonic way. However, around\n1902, an application for funding to the Carnegie Institute saw him\nexpress more clearly the connections between different aspects of his\nphilosophy. The application failed, but Peirce had returned to\nthinking about the place of sign theory in his broader philosophy. As\nnoted above, part of Peirce\u2019s understanding of philosophy in an\narchitectonic system was to treat \u201clogic\u201d as containing\nthree branches \u2013 Speculative Grammar, Critical\nLogic, and Methodeutic. The main impact here was that he\ncame to see sign theory (speculative grammar) as more clearly\nconnected to the logic of scientific discovery (methodeutic) and\nconsequently, as being more central to his account of inquiry. We\nshall not review Peirce\u2019s account of inquiry here, but as an end\ndirected process leading from doubt-prone to doubt-proof beliefs,\nPeirce began to see a similar end-directedness running through the\nsemiotic process. This kind of thinking lead Peirce to reassess his\naccount of signs and sign structure: the connection between the\nprocess of inquiry and sign chains led Peirce to notice subtleties and\nnuances that had previously been transparent to him. In particular, it\nled him to see chains of signs as tending towards a definite but\nidealized end rather than progressing ad infinitum. Since at the\nidealized end of inquiry we have a complete understanding of some\nobject, there need be no further interpretant of that object; our\nunderstanding cannot be developed any further. (See Ransdell 1977\nand Short 2004; 2007 for more on the connections between\nPeirce\u2019s later account and the end-directed process of inquiry.\nIndeed, Short (2007) represents the fullest and best developed account\nof \u2018telic\u2019 interpretations of Peirce\u2019s semiotic to date).\n",
