    "main_text": "The Method in the Rules || Deduction\n2.3 Deduction\n\nDescartes defines deduction as the \n\n\ninference of something as following necessarily from some other\npropositions which are known with certainty [\u2026] provided they\nare inferred from true and known principles through a continuous and\nuninterrupted movement of thought in which each individual proposition\nis clearly intuited. (AT 10: 369, CSM 1: 14\u201315) \n\n\nDescartes provides two useful examples of deduction in Rule 12, where\nhe writes that \u201cwhen we deduce that nothing which lacks\nextension can have a shape\u201d, \n\n\nwe intuit that the conjunction of the one with the other is wholly\nnecessary [\u2026] on the grounds that there is a necessary\nconnection between shape and extension. (AT 10: 424\u2013425, CSM 1:\n48) \n\n\nThis \u201cnecessary conjunction\u201d is one that I directly \u201csee\u201d whenever I intuit a shape in my\nimagination; any shape I imagine will necessarily be extended in\nlength, width, and breadth. Similarly, if \n\n\nSocrates [\u2026] says that he doubts everything, it necessarily\nfollows that he understands at least that he is doubting, and hence\nthat he knows that something can be true or false, etc.; for there is\na necessary connection between these facts and the nature of doubt. (AT\n10: 421, CSM 1: 46) \n\n\nIn both of these examples, intuition defines each step of the\ndeduction, as Descartes requires when he writes that \u201ceach\nindividual proposition\u201d in a deduction must be \u201cclearly\nintuited\u201d. Deductions, then, are composed of a series or\nsequence of intuitions or intuited propositions: \n\n\nHence we are distinguishing mental intuition from certain deduction on\nthe grounds that we are aware of a movement or a sort of sequence in\nthe latter but not in the former. (AT 10: 370, CSM 1: 15) \n\n\nJust as Descartes rejects Aristotelian definitions as objects of\nintuition (Aristotelian definitions like \u201cmotion is the actuality of potential being, insofar as it is potential\u201d render motion more, not less, obscure; see AT 10: 426, CSM 1: 49), so too does he reject Aristotelian syllogisms as forms of\ndeduction or inference (see Gaukroger 1989; Normore 1993; and Cassan\n2015). The validity of an Aristotelian syllogism depends exclusively on\nits form. For example, \u201cAll As are Bs; All Bs are Cs; all As\nare Cs\u201d. Here, no matter what the content, the syllogism remains\nvalid. For Descartes, by contrast, deduction depends exclusively on\nits content. What is intuited in deduction are dependency relations between simple natures. I simply\nsee that shape depends on extension, or that doubt depends on\nknowledge of the difference between truth and falsity, etc. These\ndependencies are immediately revealed in intuition and deduction,\nwithout recourse to syllogistic forms.\n\nAnother important difference between Aristotelian and Cartesian\ndeduction is that Aristotelian deductions do not yield any new\nknowledge. In the syllogism, \u201cAll men are mortal; all Greeks are\nmen; all Greeks are mortal\u201d, the conclusion is already known. We\n\u201clearn nothing new from such forms of reasoning\u201d (AT 10:\n406, CSM 1: 36). For Descartes, the method \u201cshould [\u2026]\nextend to the discovery of truths in any field\nwhatever\u201d (AT 10: 374, CSM 1: 17; my emphasis). Descartes\u2019\nmethod is a method of discovery; it does not \u201cexplain to others\narguments which are already known\u201d.\n",
