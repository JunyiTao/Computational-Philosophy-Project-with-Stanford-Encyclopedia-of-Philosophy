    "main_text": "Requests and Questions || Questions in Debate\n4.1 Questions in Debate\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b cites Aristotle as saying that the primary\naim in debate is to refute proposed views; reaching agreement is a\nsecondary aim ([Debate] 14.7\u20139). Accordingly the rules\nof debate provide that one of the debaters, known as the\n\u201cquestioner\u201d (s\u0101\u2019il), has the role of\nrefuting the views offered by the other debater (the\n\u201cresponder\u201d, muj\u012bb). It\u2019s also the\nquestioner\u2019s task to elicit from the responder commitments to\nstatements. (Committing is called \u201cconceding\u201d or\n\u201csubmitting\u201d, tasl\u012bm.) The questioner must\nthen try to refute these statements and the responder must try to\ndefend them. The questioner elicits a commitment by presenting to the\nresponder a pair of incompatible possibilities, and the responder must\nchoose which possibility to defend. This pair of incompatible\npossibilities is referred to as \u201cwhat was sought after\u201d\n(ma\u1e6dl\u016bb, in Latin quaesitum), or the\n\u201cquestion\u201d (mas\u2019ala). \n\nThe simplest case is where the questioner requires the responder to\ncommit to a view on whether some primary concept is instantiated in\nthe world. For example, \u201cIs there or is there not a\nvacuum?\u201d More complicated, because it combines two concepts, is\na question like \u201cIs the sky spherical or not?\u201d More\nbizarre, \u201cStone and human, which of the two is animal?\u201d\n([Debate] 43.16\u201320) When the responder has made a\ncommitment, the questioner must devise a syllogism whose conclusion\ncontradicts the commitment, and then attempt to get the responder to\ncommit to the premises of this syllogism and to its validity. The\nresponder is allowed to challenge on any of these points, whereupon\nthe two participants swap roles. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b comments that the rules of debate have been\nfound useful for other purposes besides resolving differences of\nopinion. For example, in demonstrative science debate trains the\nparticipants to be nimble and systematic thinkers; it clears out of\nthe way sophistical nonsense, and gives prima facie conclusions that\ncan then be checked by demonstrative methods. In fact it\u2019s not\nhumanly possible to reach philosophical truth without engaging in\ndebate. ([Debate] 29.21\u201338.3.) The relationship between\nquestioner and responder can serve as a template for the relationship\nof teacher to pupil, so far as this is not simply passing information\nfrom teacher to pupil. It can also be a basis for collaborative\nresearch. ([Demonstration] 77.1\u201383.9.)\n",
