Are There Any Normative Facts At All? \u2013 Error Theory\n\nOf course, one of the biggest questions about normativity is whether\nthere are any normative facts at all. Most\nphilosophers \u2013 all that we know of \u2013 grant that we have\nnormative concepts. So, as we said before, we will confine ourselves\nto the worldly question here. Yet many doubt that there are any facts\nof the form [Xing is wrong] or [Y is a virtue]. By\nfar the most prominent concern with the existence of such facts, going\nback at least to J.L. Mackie, is the concern that they would be\nintolerably queer (Mackie 1977: 33). Some, admitting such\nqueerness, have tried to undermine the argument from queerness to the\nconclusion that there are no normative facts, while others have (in\nvarious ways) denied that normative facts are queer in the first\nplace. We\u2019ll explore all this below.\n\nAgain, error theorists agree that our normative thought and talk\ncommit us to the existence of normative facts and properties. They are\nanti-realists because they think there are not actually any normative\nproperties or facts. They think our commitment to the existence of\nsuch things is a mistake.\n\nMackie famously argued for a form of nihilism about\nmorality \u2013 or, in contemporary terms, \u201cmoral error\ntheory\u201d \u2013 in his 1977 book Ethics: Inventing Right and\nWrong. Mackie thought that there are no moral\nfacts \u2013 or, as it will be convenient to talk about things\nhere, that all moral claims are false. Mackie was not the first to\nthink this, or something similar \u2013 see Olson (2014: chs.\n2\u20134) for some of the pre-Mackie history of the view. We focus on\nMackie\u2019s argument just because it has informed so much of the\nlast several decades of thinking about moral (and normative) error\ntheory.\n\nThis error theory thesis has to be massaged a little to be even\nconsistent. After doing some of the needed massaging, we\u2019ll\nexamine Mackie\u2019s argument and the debate it spawned. Many of the\narguments are on their faces specific to the moral domain, but\napplicable to normativity in general on further reflection. Many of\nthe earlier error theorists applied their views only to the moral\n(Mackie 1977; Joyce 2001), while more recently, some have argued for\nan error theory about the normative in general (Streumer 2017). Since\nour concern here is with the normative, we\u2019ll address that\nbroader domain, except where an argument only applies to the moral, or\nwhere we are trying to be accurate to an historical argument (e.g.,\nMackie\u2019s).\n",
