    "main_text": "Some Principal Types of Interpretation || The Strict Monist Interpretation\n3.1 The Strict Monist Interpretation\n\nA good many interpreters have taken the poem\u2019s first major phase\nas an argument for strict monism, or the paradoxical view that there\nexists exactly one thing, and for this lone entity\u2019s being\ntotally unchanging and undifferentiated. On this view, Parmenides\nconsiders the world of our ordinary experience non-existent and our\nnormal beliefs in the existence of change, plurality, and even, it\nseems, our own selves to be entirely deceptive. Although less common\nthan it once was, this type of view still has its adherents and is\nprobably familiar to many who have only a superficial acquaintance\nwith Parmenides.\n\nThe strict monist interpretation is influentially represented in the\nfirst two volumes of W. K. C. Guthrie\u2019s A History of Greek\nPhilosophy, where it is accorded a critical role in the\ndevelopment of early Greek natural philosophy from the purported\nmaterial monism of the early Milesians to the pluralist physical\ntheories of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the early atomists, Leucippus\nand Democritus. On Guthrie\u2019s strict monist reading,\nParmenides\u2019 deduction of the nature of reality led him to\nconclude \u201cthat reality [is], and must be, a unity in the\nstrictest sense and that any change in it [is] impossible\u201d and\ntherefore that \u201cthe world as perceived by the senses is\nunreal\u201d (Guthrie 1965, 4\u20135). Finding reason and sensation\nto yield wildly contradictory views of reality, Parmenides presumed\nreason must be preferred and sensory evidence thereby rejected as\naltogether deceptive. His strict monism, on Guthrie\u2019s view, took\nparticular aim at the monistic material principles of Milesian\ncosmology:\n\n[Parmenides] argues with devastating precision that once one has said\nthat something is, one is debarred from saying that it\nwas or will be, of attributing to it an origin or a\ndissolution in time, or any alteration or motion whatsoever. But this\nwas just what the Milesians had done. They supposed that the world had\nnot always existed in its present cosmic state. They derived it from\none substance, which they asserted to have changed or moved in various\nways\u2014becoming hotter or colder, drier or wetter, rarer or\ndenser\u2014in order to produce the present world-order. (Guthrie\n1965, 15-16)\n\n\nA particular focus of Parmenides\u2019 criticism, on this view, was\nAnaximander\u2019s idea that the opposites are initially latent\nwithin the originative principle he called \u201cthe Boundless\u201d\n(to apeiron) prior to being separated out from it: if these\nopposite characteristics existed prior to being separated out, then\nthe Boundless was not a true unity, but if they did not exist prior to\nbeing separated out, then how could they possibly come into existence?\nIt is thus illegitimate to suppose that everything came into being out\nof one thing (Guthrie 1962, 86\u20137). In addition to thus\ncriticizing the theoretical viability of the monistic material\nprinciples of the early Milesian cosmologists, Parmenides also is\nsupposed to have criticized the Milesian union of the material and\nmoving cause in their principles by arguing that motion and change are\nimpossible and inadmissible conceptions (Guthrie 1965, 5\u20136,\n52).\n\nAs we have seen, Parmenides\u2019 insistence on the point that\nwhatever is, is, and cannot ever not be leads him to be harshly\ncritical of the ordinary run of mortals who rely on their senses in\nsupposing that things are generated and undergo all manner of changes.\nParmenides directs us to judge reality by reason and not to trust the\nsenses. Reason, as deployed in the intricate, multi-staged deduction\nof fragment 8, reveals what attributes whatever is must possess:\nwhatever is must be ungenerated and imperishable; one, continuous and\nindivisible; and motionless and altogether unchanging, such that past\nand future are meaningless for it. This is \u201call that can be said\nabout what truly exists,\u201d and reality is thus revealed as\n\u201csomething utterly different from the world in which each one of\nus supposes himself to live,\u201d a world which is nothing but a\n\u201cdeceitful show\u201d (Guthrie 1965, 51). Parmenides\nnonetheless proceeded in the second part of his poem to present an\nelaborate cosmology along traditional lines, thus presenting readers\nwith the following crux: \u201cWhy should Parmenides take the trouble\nto narrate a detailed cosmogony when he has already proved that\nopposites cannot exist and there can be no cosmogony because plurality\nand change are inadmissible conceptions?\u201d (Guthrie 1965, 5).\nGuthrie suggests that Parmenides is \u201cdoing his best for the\nsensible world\u2026by giving as coherent an account of it as he\ncan,\u201d on the practical ground that our senses continue to\ndeceive us about its existence: \u201cHis account of appearances will\nexcel those of others. To ask \u2018But if it is unreal, what is the\npoint of trying to give an account of it at all?\u2019 is to put a\nquestion that is not likely to have occurred to him\u201d (Guthrie\n1965, 5 and 52).\n",
