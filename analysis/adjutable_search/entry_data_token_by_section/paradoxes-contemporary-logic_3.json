However,\nthere are objects that are not ranges of significance; these are just\natoms (i.e., urelemente or individuals) and they form the\nlowest type. The next type consists of classes or ranges of\nindividuals; then one has classes of classes of objects of the lowest\ntype, and so on (see also the entry on\n type theory)..\n\nNew difficulties still arise if one accepts that propositions form a\ntype (as they are the only objects of which it can be meaningfully\nasserted that they are true or false). First of all, there are\nobviously at least as many propositions as objects (just consider the\nmap associating with \\(x\\) the proposition expressed by \\((x = x)\\);\np. 527). On the other hand, if it is possible to form types of\npropositions, there are more types of propositions than propositions,\nby Cantor\u2019s argument. Then we can inject types of propositions\ninto propositions by means of the notion of logical product.\nLet \\(m\\) be a class of propositions and let \\(\\Pi m\\) be the\nproposition \u201cevery proposition of \\(m\\) is true\u201d (regarded\nas a possibly infinitary conjunction); then, if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are\ndifferent classes, the propositions \\(\\Pi m\\) and \\(\\Pi n\\) are\ndifferent, i.e., the map associating to \\(m\\) its product \\(\\Pi m\\) is\ninjective. Therefore, if we consider the class \n\n\\[ \\{p \\mid \\exists m(\\Pi m = p \\amp p \\not\\in m)\\} = R, \\]\n\n\nwe have, by injectivity, a contradiction.\n\nOf course, if one were to adopt the extensional point of view, and\nhence identify equivalent propositions, the contradiction above could\nnot be derived. Russell, however, sticks to an intensional point of\nview, stressing that equivalent propositions often can be quite\ndifferent. So one is apparently forced to reject the assumption that\npropositions form one type, and hence to require that they\nought to have various types, while logical products ought to\nhave propositions of only one type as factors.\n\nThis was eventually the basis of the ramified theory of types, but in\n1903 Russell still regarded the suggestion as harsh and artificial. As\nthe footnote on p. 527 shows, he believed that the set of all\npropositions is a counterexample to Cantor\u2019s theorem.\n",
