    "main_text": "Idealist Ethics || Self-Consciousness and Practical Responsibility\n3.1 Self-Consciousness and Practical Responsibility\n\nIn Book II Green picks up the theme from Book I about the role of\nself-consciousness in epistemic responsibility and explicitly makes\nthe parallel argument about the role of self-consciousness in\npractical and moral personality. Responsibility neither is threatened\nby determinism nor requires indeterminism; it requires\nself-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a787, 90, 106,\n109\u2013110). Moral responsibility requires capacities for practical\ndeliberation, and practical deliberation requires self-consciousness.\nNon-responsible agents, such as brutes and small children, appear to\nact on their strongest desires or, if they deliberate, to deliberate\nonly about the instrumental means to the satisfaction of their desires\n(PE \u00a7\u00a786, 92, 96, 122, 125). By contrast,\nresponsible agents must be able to distinguish between the\nintensity and authority of their desires, to\ndeliberate about the appropriateness of their desires and aims, and to\nregulate their actions in accord with these deliberations (PE\n\u00a7\u00a785\u201386, 92, 96, 103, 107, 220). Responsibility\nrequires moral personality. Here, Green shows the influence\nof Butler, Reid, and Kant (see, e.g., Irwin 1984).\n\nGreen considers the apparent threat to responsibility resulting from\nthe claim that agents necessarily act on their strongest desires\n(PE \u00a7\u00a7103\u2013106, 139\u201342). He thinks that\nthe threat is specious, because it rests on an ambiguity. Some desires\nare stronger because more intense, but desires can also be stronger\nwhen they are endorsed after deliberation. The action of non-rational\nanimals is just the vector sum of the intensity of their desires; they\ndo act on their strongest desires, in this first sense. But\nresponsible agents\u2014who have moral personality and can\ndistinguish between the strength and authority of desire and act on\nthese judgments\u2014need not act on their strongest desire in this\nfirst sense. Instead, they can be moved by the strongest desire after\ndeliberation. It\u2019s only by failing to distinguish these two\ndifferent kinds of strength, Green thinks, that one could see a threat\nto responsibility here.\n\nGreen makes clear that the sort of moral personality that is required\nby responsibility is a capacity to recognize and be guided by\nreasons. This is clear from his defense of Kant\u2019s conception of\nfreedom against criticisms. As we have seen, Green does not think that\nfreedom and responsibility require Kant\u2019s doctrine of\ntranscendental freedom. But Green is sympathetic with Kant\u2019s\nclaims about positive freedom and autonomy in the Groundwork.\nThere, Kant identifies positive freedom or autonomy with a will\ndetermined by practical reason and the moral law (4: 447). Sidgwick\ncriticizes this conception of freedom in his essay \u201cThe Kantian\nConception of Free-Will,\u201d reprinted in the Appendix to The\nMethods of Ethics, for being unable to show how someone might be\nfree and responsible for making the wrong choices, as well as the\nright ones (Methods 511\u201316). The possibility of freely\nchosen wrongdoing shows that Kant\u2019s conception of positive\nfreedom, as conformity with practical reason, cannot be freedom of the\nkind required by moral responsibility. In his lectures on Kant\u2019s\nethics, Green recognizes the same problem for Kantian freedom that\nSidgwick does (Works II\n 107).[5]\n But Green thinks that this is a case where the essentials of the\nKantian view can be defended, even if this requires amending Kant.\nKant\u2019s considered view, Green thinks, contrasts two kinds of\npositive freedom\u2014(a) the capacity to conform to\npractical reason and (b) the exercise of this capacity.\nFreedom as responsibility requires (a), not (b) (Works II\n136). On this capacitarian reading of moral personality and\nresponsibility, the person who has the capacity to conform to\npractical reason and the moral law but fails to exercise it is just as\nresponsible as the person who has the capacity and does exercise it\n(Works II 107\u201308, 119,\n 136).[6]\n\nGreen thinks that the process of forming and acting on a conception of\nwhat it is best for me on the whole to do is for me to form and act\nfrom a conception of my own overall good (PE\n\u00a7\u00a791\u201392, 96, 128).\n\n\nA man, we will suppose, is acted on at once by an impulse to revenge\nan affront, by a bodily want, by a call of duty, and by fear of\ncertain results incidental to his avenging the affront or obeying the\ncall of duty. We will suppose further that each passion \u2026\nsuggests a different line of action. So long as he is undecided how to\nact, all are, in a way, external to him. He presents them to himself\nas influences by which he is consciously affected but which are not\nhe, and with none of which he yet identifies himself \u2026. So long\nas this state of things continues, no moral effect ensues. It ensues\nwhen the man\u2019s relation to these influences is altered by his\nidentifying himself with one of them, by his taking the object of one\nof the tendencies as for the time his good. This is to will,\nand is in itself moral action \u2026. (PE \u00a7146)\n\n\nTo identify reflectively with a desire is to will it and to\nact from motive and character, rather than mere\ndesire (PE \u00a7153).\n\nHowever, we might wonder why Green assumes that in acting on some\nconception of an overall good I am thereby acting on a conception of\nmy own good.\n\n\nIt is superfluous to add, good to himself, for anything\nconceived of as good in such a way that the agent acts for the sake of\nit, must be conceived as his own good, though he may conceive\nit as his own good only on account of his interest in others, and in\nspite of any suffering on his own part incidental to its attainment.\n(PE \u00a792)\n\n\nThis may seem to confuse the ownership of the conception of\nthe good (whose conception it is) with its content (whether\nit is a conception of my good or simply of what is good). I may act on\nmy conception of the good, but that does not make it a conception of\nmy own good.\n\nHowever, Green may think that the transition from ownership to content\nis legitimate. He may think that when one adopts an end as good and\nstructures one\u2019s plans, emotions, and desires around it that one\nthereby makes that end one\u2019s own and makes it part of\none\u2019s personal good such that the value of the end and\none\u2019s success in achieving it determine in part the quality of\none\u2019s life. If I choose to become a parent, then the\nconstitutive aims of being a good parent, including the success of my\nchildren, become part of my good such that the well-being of my\nchildren directly affects my own happiness or personal good.\n",
