    "main_text": "The Combination Question: How Do Thick Concepts Relate Evaluation and Description? || Inseparabilist Views\n3.2 Inseparabilist Views\n\nAccording to Inseparabilists, thick terms and concepts are irreducibly\nthick: their meanings involve both evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription without this being a matter of combining constituent\nevaluative and non-evaluative contents. For instance, cruel\nexpresses a sui generis evaluative concept which isn\u2019t\na combination of pro tanto bad or bad in way\nW with some non-evaluative content. How then is the idea\nthat thick terms are both descriptive and evaluative to be understood,\nif not in terms of combining evaluative and descriptive components? It\ncannot be that their meanings are both wholly evaluative and wholly\nnon-evaluative (which is how we are understanding the descriptive);\nthat would be contradictory.\n\nThe challenge to Inseparabilists is to pin down more precisely how\nthick terms are both evaluative and descriptive in ways that are\ncontinuous with, respectively, thin evaluative concepts and\nnon-evaluative concepts. Simply stipulating new technical notions\nwould leave their claims about the distinctive philosophical\nsignificance of thick concepts unsatisfactory. Not just any conceptual\nentailment of a term seems constitutive of its meaning; while\n\u201cx is a horse\u201d entails that x is a mammal,\nit also entails that x isn\u2019t a wombat (or a mountain, or\na beer bottle), but not being a wombat (etc.) isn\u2019t part of the\nmeaning of horse (Dancy 2013: 49). But some entailments are\nsuch that competence with the term requires grasping them, and thick\nconcepts and descriptive concepts are similar in having non-evaluative\nentailments of this sort. It is a matter of meaning that lewd acts\ninvolve overt sexual display, selfish acts involve the agent giving\npriority to herself over others, and so on. There is also a\nmethodological rationale for focusing on entailments: linguists study\nword meanings by considering patterns in competent speakers\u2019\nentailment and contradiction judgments, synonymy judgments, and\njudgments about truth-conditions because these reflect relations among\nthe sorts of entities that semantic theories assign to linguistic\nexpressions as their meanings (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 2000: ch.\n1). (A complication is that the meanings of words may not map\none-to-one onto the concepts those words may be used to express.\nWriters on thick concepts often don\u2019t say what they take\nconcepts and their relation to word meanings to be.)\n\nWhat should Inseparabilists say about the common way in which thick\nand thin concepts are evaluative? Several views have been proposed,\nbut a simple proposal will hopefully suffice to give a feel for the\nissue. Thick and thin concepts might be thought similar in that both\nhave intrinsic practical relevance (Dancy 2013: 56\u20137). Whereas\nthe relevance of a non-evaluative concept such as water\nto your actions needs to be explained by\nciting other considerations, such as your desire to quench thirst or\nthe fact that you are stranded in the desert, no further explanation\nis needed for the practical relevance of thin concepts like ought\nor thick concepts such as courage.\nIt is \u201cto be expected\u201d that\ncourageousness makes a practical difference: it is normally, even if\nnot always, something to aspire to and admire. Whereas competence with\nnon-evaluative concepts requires only the ability to determine whether\nthe concept applies, competence with an evaluative concept requires\nalso grasping its general evaluative point\u2014the sorts of\npractical difference its instantiation can make in a particular case.\nFor thick concepts, the sort of difference may vary from case to case:\nrudeness is usually inappropriate, but sometimes neutral and sometimes\npositively called for. One problem with this view is that its\nmetaethical commitments are too controversial for a general\ndistinction between evaluative and non-evaluative concepts. For\nexample, under the \u201cinternalist\u201d view of normative\nreasons, according to which there is a reason for an agent to perform\na particular action only if the action is suitably related to the\nagent\u2019s motivations, courageous and\nmorally good have no more intrinsic practical\nrelevance than water and wombat\n(Williams 1981). Whether their application\nmakes a difference to your reasons will depend on your motivations. It\nis also controversial that \u201cobjectionable\u201d thick concepts\nhave intrinsic practical relevance. Why then should other thick\nconcepts?\n\nFor a summary of other Inseparabilist views on how thick and thin\nconcepts are evaluative, see\n section 2\n of the supplementary document\n \u201cAdditional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance\u201d.\n\nDebates about Separability and Inseparability frequently lead to two\nfurther issues. The first is that Inseparability requires that thick\nterms and concepts are inherently evaluative in meaning and that most\nSeparabilists also take evaluation and non-evaluative description to\nbe combined within the meanings of thick terms and concepts, not\nmerely their use. The second issue is that if thick terms and concepts\nare inherently evaluative, it isn\u2019t enough to specify the shared\nsense in which both thick and thin concepts are evaluative. To\npreserve a distinction, we must also ask specify how they differ. (And\nif thick terms and concepts aren\u2019t inherently evaluative, we\nmust instead say how they differ from other non-evaluative descriptive\nconcepts.) The next two sections address these issues in turn.\n",
