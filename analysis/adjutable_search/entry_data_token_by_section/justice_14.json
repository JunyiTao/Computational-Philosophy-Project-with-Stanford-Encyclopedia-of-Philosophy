    "main_text": "The Scope of Justice || Recognition vs. Redistribution\n3.4 Recognition vs. Redistribution\n\nRecent philosophical writing on justice has drawn attention to forms\nof injustice that do not involve the material treatment that people\nreceive, either from other persons or from institutions, but the harms\nthey suffer through failures of recognition. They are impacted by\nsocial norms and social practices that diminish their sense of agency\nand induce them to see themselves as of lesser value than others. Here\nthen justice is understood as being adequately and appropriately\nrecognized, and injustice as involving failures of recognition, or in\nsome cases \u2018misrecognition\u2019, when a person is placed in a\ncategory or assigned an identity that is not their own. In one\ninfluential formulation of this idea, \u2018it is unjust that some\nindividuals and groups are denied the status of full partners in\nsocial interaction simply as a consequence of institutionalized\npatterns of cultural value in whose construction they have not equally\nparticipated and which disparage their distinctive characteristics or\nthe distinctive characteristics assigned to them\u2019 (Fraser in\nFraser and Honneth 2003, p. 29).\n\nWhat, then, does it mean to be recognized? In general it means to be\nviewed and treated by others in the way that is appropriate to the\nfeatures that you possess, but most philosophers regard recognition as\nmultidimensional. In particular, they distinguish between being\nrecognized as an equal, where a person is accorded the kind of\nstanding that gives them an equal status with other members of the\nrelevant group, and being recognized for having characteristics,\nachievements or an identity that may be uniquely their own.\nRecognition in this second sense may involve the unequal granting of\nsocial esteem. Justice as recognition, therefore, is internally\ncomplex. At the social level, Axel Honneth distinguishes \u2018three\nforms of social recognition, based in the sphere-specific principles\nof love, equal legal treatment, and social esteem\u2019 (Fraser and\nHonneth 2003 p. 180)\n\nThe question that arises is how best to understand the relationship\nbetween justice of this kind and distributive justice, involving the\nallocation of material resources and so forth. For Honneth, justice as\nrecognition is understood expansively so that it can also capture\nissues of economic justice, the thought being that the harm inflicted\nwhen, say, labour is not adequately rewarded can be understood as a\nfailure to offer adequate recognition of the worker\u2019s social\ncontribution. For Nancy Fraser, by contrast, recognition and\nredistribution are seen as two mutually irreducible but jointly\nnecessary conditions for social justice. Failures of recognition can\nbe experienced by some among the economically privileged \u2013 such\nas \u2018the African-American Wall Street banker who cannot get a\ntaxi to pick him up\u2019 (Fraser and Honneth 2003, p. 34). Justice\nas recognition requires cultural shifts in the way that different\nforms of identity and different types of achievement are valued that\nare independent of the institutional changes required to achieve\ndistributive justice.\n\nA particular form of recognitional injustice is epistemic\ninjustice as diagnosed by Miranda Fricker (Fricker 2007). This occurs\nwhen someone is wronged in their capacity as a source of knowledge,\nand it takes two main forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutic\ninjustice. As Fricker explains \u2018testimonial injustice occurs\nwhen prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility\nto a speaker\u2019s word; hermeneutical injustice occurs at a prior\nstage when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone as\nat an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their\nsocial experiences\u2019 (Fricker 2007, p. 1). She argues that\ntestimonial injustice matters for two reasons. First, the person who\nsuffers from it is less able to protect or advance their interests\n\u2013 for example they are less likely to be believed when having to\ndefend themselves in court. Second, since others are unwilling to\nregard them as competent sources of knowledge, they may lose trust in\ntheir own capacity to know, leading in some cases to \u2018prolonged\nself-doubt and loss of intellectual confidence\u2019.\n\nHermeneutical injustice arises in the context of unequal relationships\nin which the subordinated party lacks the concept or concepts needed\nto make sense of their experience (and thereby to challenge their\nsubordination). Fricker uses the example of a woman who suffered\nsexual harassment at the time before feminists had developed that\nconcept, and so had no adequate word to describe what she was\nexperiencing. Hermeneutical injustice matters most when it is\nsystematic, brought about by power inequalities that leave certain\ngroups \u2018hermeneutically marginalised\u2019. However she treats\nepistemic justice as a virtue that individual hearers can develop, in\ncontrast to recognition theorists like Fraser and Honneth for whom\nachieving recognitional justice requires collective action to change\nsocial and cultural norms on the part of misrecognized groups.\n",
