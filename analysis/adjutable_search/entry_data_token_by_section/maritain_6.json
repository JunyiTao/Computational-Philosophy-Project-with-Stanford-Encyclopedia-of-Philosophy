Maritain\nheld, however, that Aristotelian ethics, by itself, was inadequate\nbecause it lacked knowledge of humanity\u2019s ultimate end. The\nThomistic view\u2014that there is a law in human nature that is\nderivative of (though knowable separately from) a divine or eternal\nlaw, and that humanity\u2019s \u2018end\u2019 goes beyond anything\nattainable in this life\u2014was, Maritain thought, a significant\nadvance on what Aristotle had provided. \n\nFollowing Aquinas, Maritain maintained that there is a natural law\nthat is \u201cunwritten\u201d but immanent in nature. Specifically,\ngiven that nature has a teleological character, one can know what a\nthing should do or how it should be used by examining its\n\u201cend\u201d and the \u201cnormality of its functioning\u201d.\nMaritain therefore defines \u2018natural law\u2019 as \n\n\nan order or a disposition that the human reason may discover and\naccording to which the human will must act to accord itself with the\nnecessary ends of the human being. (La loi naturelle, 1986:\n21, my translation; see Man and the\nState, 1951: 86) \n\n\nThis law \u201cprescribes our most fundamental duties\u201d (Man\nand the State, 1951: 95) and is coextensive with morality.\n\nThere is, Maritain holds, a single natural law governing all beings\nwith a human nature. The first principles of this law are known\nconnaturally, not rationally or through concepts, by an\nactivity that Maritain, following Aquinas, called synderesis.\nThus, natural law is \u2018natural\u2019 because it not only\nreflects human nature, but is known naturally. Maritain acknowledges,\nhowever, that knowledge of the natural law varies throughout humanity\nand according to individuals\u2019 capacities and abilities, and he\nspeaks of growth in an individual\u2019s or a collectivity\u2019s\nmoral awareness. This allows him to reply to the challenge that there\ncannot be a universal, natural law because no such law is known or\nrespected universally. Again, though this law is progressively known,\nit is never known completely, and so the natural law is never\nexhausted in any particular articulation of it (La loi\nnaturelle, see Sweet 1998). This recognition of the historical\nelement in human consciousness did not, however, prevent Maritain from\nholding that this law is objective and binding. (Critics have argued,\nhowever, that to speak of \u2018connatural knowledge\u2019 is\nobscure; it is quite unlike what we ordinarily call\n\u2018knowledge\u2019 and is, therefore, inadequate as a basis for\nknowledge of law. [see, for example, Nielsen 1959 [1991].)\n\nA key notion in Maritain\u2019s moral philosophy is that of human\nfreedom. He says that the \u2018end\u2019 of humanity is to be free\nbut, by \u2018freedom\u2019, he does not mean license or pure\nrational autonomy, but the realisation of the human person in accord\nwith his or her nature\u2014specifically, the achievement of moral\nand spiritual perfection. Maritain\u2019s moral philosophy, then,\ncannot be considered independently of his analysis of human nature.\nMaritain distinguishes between the human being as an individual and as\na person. Human beings are \u2018individuals\u2019 who are related\nto a common, social order of which they are parts. But they are also\npersons. The person is a \u2018whole\u2019, is an object of dignity,\n\u201cmust be treated as an end\u201d (Les droits de\nl\u2019homme, 1942 [1943: 84]), and has a transcendent destiny.\nIn both the material and the spiritual order, however, human beings\nparticipate in a common good (see D\u2019Souza 2011). One is an\nindividual in virtue of being a material being; one is a person so far\nas one is capable of intellectual activity and freedom. Still, while\ndistinct, both elements are equally necessary to being a human being.\nIt is in virtue of their individuality that human beings have\nobligations to the social order, but it is in virtue of their\npersonality that they cannot be subordinated to that order. Moreover,\nit is through free choice and action that a person defines himself\n(see Toromczak 2008). Maritain\u2019s emphasis on the value of the\nhuman person has been described as a form of personalism,\nwhich he saw as a via media between individualism and\nsocialism.\n\nThough some critics have challenged Maritain\u2019s distinction\nbetween the person and the individual as, for example, lacking\nmetaphysical rigour (Floucat 1996), many Maritain scholars regard it\nas a useful way of founding a liberal, but non-individualist political\nphilosophy (D\u2019Souza 2008) or grounding an applied ethics\n(Acevedo 2012). \n\nMaritain\u2019s moral philosophy is clearly related to his political\nphilosophy and his philosophy of law. The personalist position that he\ndefended had antecedents in the nineteenth century, but it was perhaps\nthe first to be part of an account of a new model of civilization (De\nTavernier 2009). In one of his earliest political works, Maritain\ndescribed his view as \u201cintegral Christian\nHumanism\u201d\u2014\u2018integral\u2019, because it considers the\nhuman being, an entity that has both material and spiritual\ndimensions, as a unified whole and because it sees human beings in\nsociety as participants in a common good. The object of\nMaritain\u2019s political philosophy was to outline the conditions\nnecessary to making the individual fully human. His integral humanism,\nthen, seeks to bring the different dimensions of the human person\ntogether, without ignoring or diminishing the value of either, and it\nhas been regarded by some as superior to Charles Taylor\u2019s\n\u201cexclusive humanism\u201d (Klassen 2011) or, at least, as a\ncompletion of it (Doyle 2009). While one\u2019s private good as an\nindividual is subordinate to the (temporal) common good of the\ncommunity, as a person with a supernatural end, one\u2019s\n\u2018spiritual good\u2019 is superior to society\u2014and this is\nsomething that Maritain believed all political communities should\nrecognize.\n\nFor Maritain, the best political order is one which recognizes the\nsovereignty of God. He rejects, therefore, not only fascism and\ncommunism, but all secular humanisms. Maritain objects that such\nviews\u2014particularly fascism and communism\u2014are not only\nsecular religions, but dehumanizing (Kinsella 2012) and, while he was\na defender of American-style democracy, he is clearly not interested\nin combining his attachment to Christianity with capitalism. A\ntheocentric humanism, Maritain would argue, has its philosophical\nfoundation in the recognition of the nature of the human person as a\nspiritual and material being\u2014a being that has a relation to\nGod\u2014and social and political institutions must therefore reflect\nthis.\n\nMaritain envisages a political society under the rule of law\u2014and\nhe distinguishes four types of law: the eternal, the natural, the\n\u2018common law of civilisation\u2019 (droit des gens or\njus gentium), and the positive (droit positif).\n\nThe natural law is \u201cuniversal and invariable\u201d and deals\nwith \u201cthe rights and duties which follow [necessarily] from the\nfirst principle\u201d (see La loi naturelle; Man and the\nState, 1951: 97\u201398) or precept of law\u2014that good is to\nbe done and evil avoided. Nevertheless, while the natural law is\n\u201cself-evident\u201d (see Man and the State, 1951: 90)\nand consistent with and confirmed by experience\u2014something which\nmany critics have challenged\u2014Maritain holds that it is not\nfounded on human nature. It is rooted in divine reason and in a\ntranscendent order (i.e., in the eternal law), and is \u2018written\ninto\u2019 human nature by God. At times, Maritain appears to hold\nthat natural law acquires its obligatory character only because of its\nrelation to the eternal law; he writes that \u201cnatural law is law\nonly because it is participation in Eternal Law\u201d (see Man\nand the State, 1951: 96). (Some have concluded\u2014perhaps too\nhastily\u2014that a theory that refers to an Eternal Law must be\nultimately theological and cannot be purely philosophical.)\n\nThe droit des gens or \u2018common law of\ncivilisation\u2019 is an extension of the natural law to the\ncircumstances of life in society, and thus it is concerned with human\nbeings as social beings (e.g., as citizens or as members of families).\nThe \u2018positive law\u2019 is the system of rules and regulations\ninvolved in assuring general order within a particular society. It\nvaries according to the stage of social or economic development within\nthat community and according to the specific activities of individuals\nwithin it. Neither the positive law nor the droit des gens\nis, however, deducible from the natural law alone. Neither is known\nconnaturally and, therefore, is not part of the natural law.\nNevertheless, it is in virtue of their relation to natural law that\nthey \u201chave the force of law and impose themselves on\nconscience\u201d (Les droits de l\u2019homme, 1942 [1943:\n90\u20131]). When a positive law acts against the natural law, it is,\nstrictly speaking, not a law. Thus, Maritain clearly rejects legal\npositivism.\n\nThe term \u2018natural law\u2019 and its relations both to\n\u2018eternal law\u2019 and to positive law have, however, been the\nfocus of much controversy. Maritain\u2019s account of natural law\nboth presupposes a metaphysical view of the nature of human beings and\na realistic epistemology, and critics have argued that there are a\nnumber of tensions or inconsistencies internal to it. Some of the\nprincipal criticisms of this account are i) that it is inconsistent\nbecause it sets forth a naturalistic theory of what is good and bad\nand yet claims that only a supernatural sanction will serve to explain\nmoral obligation, ii) that connatural knowledge is not only inadequate\nfor what we normally count as knowledge, but it is, in fact, also\nincapable of establishing that something is a natural moral law, iii)\nthat the first principle of moral law is vacuous, and iv) that\nMaritain glosses over the fact/value distinction.\n\nMaritain held that natural law theory entailed an account of human\nrights. Since the natural end of each person is to achieve moral and\nspiritual perfection, it is necessary to have the means to do so,\ni.e., to have rights which, since they serve to realise his or her\nnature, are called \u2018natural\u2019. This respects the\nAristotelian-Thomistic principle of justice, that we should distribute\nto each \u2018what is truly his or hers\u2019. Maritain replies to\nthe criticism that there are no such rights, since they are not\nuniversally recognised, by reminding his readers that, just as the\nnatural law comes to be recognised gradually and over time, so also is\nthere a gradual recognition of rights. Indeed, Maritain held that\ncertain basic natural rights can be recognised by all, without there\nhaving to be agreement on their foundation and, as an illustration of\nthis, he pointed to the general agreement on those rights found in the\n1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nNevertheless, he did insist that an adequate account of human rights\nrequired a foundation in natural law (see Man and the State,\n1951: Ch. IV)\u2014a position rejected by many authors in the\nAnglo-American tradition, such as Rawls (Clark 2012).\n\nMaritain held that natural rights are fundamental and inalienable, and\nantecedent in nature, and superior, to society. Still, they should not\nbe understood as \u2018antecedent\u2019 in a temporal sense and do\nnot form the basis of the state or of the civil law. Rights are\ngrounded in the natural law, and specifically in relation to the\ncommon good. It is this good, and not individual rights, that is the\nbasis of the state, and it is because of this that Maritain held that\nthere can be a hierarchical ordering of these rights (Man and the\nState, 1951: 106\u20137).\n\nOne consequence of his natural law and natural rights theory is that\nMaritain favoured a democratic and liberal view of the state, and\nargued for a political society that is both personalist, pluralist,\nand Christianly-inspired. He held that the authority to rule derives\nfrom the people\u2014for people have a natural right to govern\nthemselves. Still, this is consistent with a commitment to\nChristianity, Maritain thought, because the ideals of democracy are\nthemselves inspired by a belief in God\u2019s rule, and that the\nprimary source of all authority is God (Man and the State,\n1951: 127).\n\nMaritain also favoured a number of liberal ideals, and the list of\nrights that he recognises extends significantly beyond that found in\nmany liberal theories, and includes the rights of workers as well as\nthose of the human and the civic person. He was, in particular, a\ndefender of freedom of conscience\u2014and not simply freedom of\nreligion or freedom of worship\u2014which he saw as fundamental to\nthe full development of human personality and to the common good of\nsociety (Sweet 2006, Coulter 2012).\n\nFurthermore, the ideal of freedom or liberty to be found in the state\nis close to that which is now generally called positive\nfreedom\u2014i.e., one that reflects a view of the person as sharing\nin a common good. As a polity that attempts to provide the conditions\nfor the realisation of the human person as an individual who is,\nthereby, a member of a temporal community, it recognises that the use\nof goods by individuals must serve the good of all (Integral\nHumanism, 1936 [1968: 184]), and that individuals can be required\nto serve the community. Moreover, in such a state, political leaders\nwould be more than just spokespersons for the people (Man and the\nState, 1951: 140), and Maritain recognises that they can\nrepresent the \u2018hidden will\u2019 of the people. Their\naim\u2014and the aim of the state as a whole\u2014is, however,\nalways the common good. Since minorities may themselves reflect this\n\u2018hidden will\u2019, Maritain also recognised the important role\nto be played by dissenting minorities.\n\n(Maritain does not discuss in any detail how his model\n\u2018Christian\u2019 polity might be realised, but suggests that it\nis the only one that takes account of each person\u2019s spiritual\nworth and that recognises the importance of providing the means to\nfoster one\u2019s growth as a person. It recognises differences of\nreligious conscience and is, in this way, fundamentally pluralistic.\nSuch a polity, Maritain believed, would exhibit not just tolerance,\nbut friendship and fellowship [see D\u2019Souza 2011, Zunic 2005],\nand would thereby have social cohesion. Whether it would indeed be\nable to accommodate plurality while remaining a unified community has,\nhowever, been a subject of some debate [Armour 2005].)\n\nIn such an ideal polity, Maritain imagines that a leadership role\nwould be played by a multiplicity of \u2018civic fraternities\u2019,\nfounded on freedom, inspired by the virtues of Christianity,\nreflecting a moral and spiritual discipline, and which are\nfundamentally democratic. While such groups would not necessarily\nexercise political power, the society as a whole would reflect\nChristian values\u2014not just because these values are part of a\nprivileged religion or faith (a matter that Maritain would be wary\nof), but because these are necessary to the temporal community. In\nsuch a polity one would, of course, find a church and a state, though\nMaritain would see them as cooperative entities, with the state\noccupying itself with those matters that, while focusing on temporal\nconcerns, addressed the needs of the whole of the human person, and\nwith the church focussing on spiritual matters.\n\nIt is, perhaps, evident that such a polity could not survive within a\nsingle nation state that existed among a plurality of states with\ndifferent ideals, and so Maritain supported the ideal of a world\nfederation of political societies (see Goedert 2010). While the\nrealisation of such an ideal was something that lay in a distant\nfuture, Maritain nevertheless thought that such a federation was\npossible, providing that the individual states retained a fair degree\nof autonomy and that persons could be found from each state who would\nvoluntarily distance themselves from the particular interests of their\nhome country.\n\nMaritain had a significant influence in the development of and\nadvocacy for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and his\npolitical philosophy had a substantial impact on \u2018Christian\nDemocratic\u2019 parties in Western Europe, Chile, and Argentina\n(Saranyana, 1999\u20132002: 205), as well as on constitutional\nthinking in Latin America and, later, in Canada. His defence of\nnatural rights, developed beginning in the late 1930s and provided in\ndetail in Les droits de l\u2019homme et la loi naturelle\n(1942), was arguably present in the articulation of the American\nDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (adopted by the Ninth\nInternational Conference of American States, in Bogot\u00e1,\nColombia, in 1948) that, in turn, influenced several of the members of\nthe Drafting Committee of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Moreover,\nnot only were some of Maritain\u2019s key writings read in advance by\nthe Drafting Committee, but one of its key members, Charles Malik,\nfollowed Maritain\u2019s political thought closely in several\nrespects. It is not surprising, then, that the Declaration has close\nparallels with the rights enumerated earlier in the Les droits de\nl\u2019homme et la loi naturelle, and Maritain was a major\nadvocate for such a text within UNESCO, in 1947\u201348, before its\nadoption by the UN General Assembly, and also in its later\nadvancement.\n",
