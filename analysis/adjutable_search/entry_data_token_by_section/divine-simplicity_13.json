Dolezal, for\nexample, holds that God must be both simple and libertarianly free to\nbe absolute despite the apparent contradiction. How God can be both\nsimple and free must remain a mystery. William Hasker balks:\n\u201cThis won\u2019t do, of course\u201d (2016, 19). His \u201cof\ncourse\u201d is of course a bit of bluster, but one feels his pain.\n\u201cThe argument Dolezal has given quite straightforwardly entails\nthat the doctrine of divine simplicity is false \u2026\u201d (2016,\n19). This is not an unreasonable thing to say, but is it compelling?\nDoes it force a rational person to abandon DDS? Is it so compelling\nthat DDS can be dismissed as a mistake, a correctable error\nin reasoning that one falls into due, perhaps, to inattention to\ncertain obvious truths? Not quite.\n\nHasker takes the apparent contradiction to be real. But can he exclude\nthe possibility that the contradiction is merely apparent? His view\ncomports well with the notion that God is a being among beings. But\nfor those who hold that the divine transcendence requires that God\ntranscend beings in his mode of existence, his mode of\nproperty-possession, his mode of necessity, and his mode of\nuniqueness, it may seem more likely that the apparent contradictions\nthat arise when we think about God reflect our structural inability to\nthink of him as anything other than a very special being among\nbeings.\n\nFor Stump, God is esse and God is also id quod est.\nThese claims, though apparently contradictory, must both be affirmed.\nThe apparent contradiction arises because of a \u201cdeficiency in\nour mode of speaking\u201d (Stump 2016, 207). She presumably means\nthat this deficiency is in this life irremediable and ineluctable. In\nreality, however, there is no contradiction; the laws of logic apply\nto God, \u201cand not just anything can be correctly affirmed of\nGod\u201d (2016, 207).\n\nHasker is unimpressed:\n\n\u2026 we do not, strictly speaking, have here a coherent view of\nGod\u2019s nature \u2026 . What we have, rather, is a set of\nmutually incompatible propositions, each of which has something to be\nsaid in its favor, but at least one of which must be false. (Hasker\n2016, 23, fn 52)\n\n\nStump could agree with Hasker that she does not present us with\n\u201ca coherent view of God\u2019s nature,\u201d but then that is\nprecisely what her position implies cannot be had. Our mode of\nspeaking about God is necessarily defective and inaccurate. If we\ncould speak accurately, then \u2026\n\n\u2026 we would know the true nature of God. We would know the\nquid est of God. But this is precisely what we do not know.\nSo although, on Aquinas\u2019s view, we can have considerable\npositive knowledge of God, the modes of speaking about God retain\ntheir inaccuracy in anything having to do with the quiddity of God.\n(Stump 2016, 207)\n\n\nThe issue that divides Hasker and Stump and the parties they represent\nis perhaps impossible to resolve. Hasker demands a \u201ccoherent\nview of God\u2019s nature,\u201d one that satisfies and can be\nseen to satisfy the exigencies of the discursive intellect.\nHasker demands that God fit within the discursive framework, which\nimplies that he have properties the way creatures do, exist the way\ncreatures do, and so on. Stump could reasonably claim that Hasker is\nmaking an inappropriate demand, one that does not respect the divine\ntranscendence.\n",
