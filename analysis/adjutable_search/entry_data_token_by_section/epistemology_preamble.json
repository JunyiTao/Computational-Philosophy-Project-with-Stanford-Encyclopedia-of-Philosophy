    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cepistemology\u201d comes from the Greek words\n\u201cepisteme\u201d and \u201clogos\u201d. \u201cEpisteme\u201d\ncan be translated as \u201cknowledge\u201d or\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d or \u201cacquaintance\u201d, while\n\u201clogos\u201d can be translated as \u201caccount\u201d or\n\u201cargument\u201d or \u201creason\u201d. Just as each of these\ndifferent translations captures some facet of the meaning of these\nGreek terms, so too does each translation capture a different facet of\nepistemology itself. Although the term \u201cepistemology\u201d is\nno more than a couple of centuries old, the field of epistemology is\nat least as old as any in\n  philosophy.[1]\n  In different parts of its extensive history, different facets of\nepistemology have attracted attention.  Plato\u2019s epistemology was\nan attempt to understand what it was to know, and how knowledge\n(unlike mere true opinion) is good for the knower. Locke\u2019s\nepistemology was an attempt to understand the operations of human\nunderstanding, Kant\u2019s epistemology was an attempt to understand\nthe conditions of the possibility of human understanding, and\nRussell\u2019s epistemology was an attempt to understand how modern\nscience could be justified by appeal to sensory experience. Much\nrecent work in formal epistemology is an attempt to understand how our\ndegrees of confidence are rationally constrained by our evidence, and\nmuch recent work in feminist epistemology is an attempt to understand\nthe ways in which interests affect our evidence, and affect our\nrational constraints more generally. In all these cases, epistemology\nseeks to understand one or another kind of\ncognitive success (or, correspondingly, cognitive\nfailure). This entry surveys the varieties of cognitive\nsuccess, and some recent efforts to understand some of those\nvarieties.\n",
