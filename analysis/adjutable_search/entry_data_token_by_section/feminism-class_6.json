Ethical Theories of Women\u2019s Caring Work\n\nSeveral authors have explored the ethical implications of the sexual\ndivision of labor in which it is primarily women who do caring labor.\nNancy Fraser (1997) and Susan Moller Okin (1989) formulate ethical\narguments to maintain that a just model of society would have to\nre-structure work relations so that the unpaid and underpaid caring\nlabor now done primarily by women would be given a status equivalent\nto (other) wage labor by various means. In her council socialist\nvision, Ferguson (1989, 1991) argues that an ideal society would\nrequire both women and men to do the hitherto private unpaid work of\ncaring or \u201csex/affective labor.\u201d For example, such work\nwould be shared by men, either in the family and/or provided by the\nstate where appropriate (as for elders and children\u2019s\nchildcare), and compensated fairly by family allowances (for those,\nwomen or men, doing the major share of housework), and by higher pay\nfor caring wage work (such as daycare workers, nurses, and\nteachers).\n\nCarol Gilligan (1982) claims that women and girls tend to use a\ndifferent form of ethical reasoning \u2014 she terms this the\n\u201cethics of care\u201d \u2014 than men and boys who use an\nethics of justice. Some have argued that this different ethical\napproach is due to women\u2019s caring sensibilities that have been\ndeveloped by the sexual division of labor (Ruddick 1989).\nInterestingly, the debate between feminist theorists of justice, e.g.,\nFraser and Okin, and ethics of care feminists such as Gilligan and\nRuddick, is less about substance than a meta-ethical dispute as to\nwhether ethics should concern principles or judgments in particular\ncases. All of these theorists seem to have ideal visions of society\nwhich dovetail: all would support the elimination of the sexual\ndivision of labor so that both men and women could become equally\nsensitized to particular others through caring work.\n\nAsha Bhandary (2020) proposes an integrative approach, enlargening the\nRawlsian distributive justice theory with liberal dependency care.\nTaking into account Eva Feder Kittay\u2019s (2019, 1998) emphasis on\nhuman dependency, Bhandary argues that Rawls\u2019s framework must be\nexpanded to include caring considerations as part of the basic\nstructure of society. To address feminist critiques, she adds that\nboys must be taught the value of care work and voluntary participation\nin it. Bhandary develops an arrow of care map to account for\ndistributive inequalities (race, class, etc.) within countries and\ncross-culturally. In Meaningful Work, Andrea Veltman (2016)\nalso provides a liberal normative account of care, endorsing Paul\nGomberg\u2019s (2007) concept of contributive justice, where each\ncommunity and family member pulls together voluntarily using a system\nof job rotation, rather than relying on state provisions of goods.\n\nBy contrast, the authors of the Care Manifesto (Chatzidakis\net al., 2020) build on political theorists who call for a\ncentering of care and a decentering of economics (Tronto 2013; 1993)\nand a universal care giver model (Fraser, 2013) in democratic\nsocieties. Caring work is not only important at the level of\ninterpersonal care but also at the macroscopic level of \u201ctheorising\ncaring infrastructures and the nature of an overarching politics of\ncare\u201d grounded in \u201cfeminist, queer, anti-racist and eco-socialist\nperspective\u201d (Chatzidakis et al., p. 22). Such perspective\nalso critiques the exploitative nature of transnational care chains\nwhere Global North upper class women exploit the labor of women and\ngirls from the Global South (Anderson, 2000). Reproductive labor has\nalso become transactional and exploitative in another sense: surrogacy\narrangements in the global biomarkets, where Indian women carry babies\nand are contractually required to give up the newborn on terms dictated\nby Global North couples, which may include selective abortion during\npregnancy (Saravanah, 2018). By centering care in the commons, these\ntheorists call attention to a politics of interdependence.\n",
