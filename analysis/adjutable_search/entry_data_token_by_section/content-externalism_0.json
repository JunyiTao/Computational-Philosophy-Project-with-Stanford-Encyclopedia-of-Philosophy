    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, externalism is the view that what\nis going on inside an individual\u2019s body does not always, on its\nown, fix what is going on inside that individual\u2019s mind. The\nmind, in this sense, simply denotes the totality of mental\noccurrences undergone by an individual at any given time. The\nbody, in this sense, delineates the biological boundaries of\nthe individual which, in creatures such as us, coincide with the\nindividual\u2019s skin and, of course, includes the brain,\ntraditionally taken as the crucial determinant of an\nindividual\u2019s mental life. Thus, externalism is the view that an\nindividual\u2019s bodily (including neural) events, states,\nprocesses, etc. do not always, on their own, determine the mental,\nstates, processes had or undergone by that individual. The qualifier\nnot always permits there to be cases\u2014perhaps\nmany\u2014in which mental occurrences are fixed by bodily\noccurrences. Externalism, generically at least, is merely committed to\nthe claim that this does not always happen. The qualifier\non its own is intended to convey that even if an\nindividual\u2019s bodily occurrences do not completely\ndetermine which mental occurrences are had or undergone by that\nindividual, the former will at least partially determine the\nlatter and, indeed, can play an important role in such determination.\n\n\nExternalism appears in two major forms. Content externalism\nis externalism about mental content\u2014the content of\nmental states. It claims that the contents of at least some mental\nstates are not solely determined by occurrences falling within the\nbiological boundaries of that individual that has them. Since mental\nstates that have content are typically individuated by that content,\nthis entails that which mental states an individual has is not\ncompletely determined by occurrences falling within the biological\nboundaries of that individual. Vehicle externalism, more commonly known as the thesis of the extended mind, is externalism about the vehicles of mental content. According to the thesis of extended mind, the vehicles of mental content\u2014roughly, the physical or computational bearers of this content\u2014are not always determined or exhausted by things occurring inside the\nbiological boundaries of the individual. Content externalism and extended mind are logically independent views, and it is not uncommon to find adherents of one view denying the other. These two forms of externalism diverge sharply not simply because they are externalism about different things\u2014contents and vehicles,\nrespectively\u2014but also because they have different\nconceptions of this failure of determination. If mental contents are not determined solely by what is occurring inside the biological boundaries of an individual, this is quite different from the way in which the vehicles of content are not determined solely by what is occurring inside these boundaries. In other words, each form of\nexternalism differs not only in what it claims to be external, but\nalso in what it means by \u201cexternal\u201d.\n",
