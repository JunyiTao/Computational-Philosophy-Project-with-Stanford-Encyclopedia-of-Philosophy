    "main_text": "Leibniz on matter\n2. Leibniz on matter\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s views on the nature of matter are subtle and layered. From \nthe time of his youthful conversion in the Rosental, he remained \nbroadly sympathetic to the explanatory project of the new mechanical \nphilosophy and its ambition to explain natural phenomena in terms of \nmatter and motion rather than in terms of a wide range of irreducible\nformal natures. In spite of this general sympathy, however, he was \nalso one of the most penetrating critics of the dominant conceptions \nof matter in the mechanistic tradition. This section looks first at \nLeibniz\u2019s critiques of the two most important of those conceptions \nbefore turning to his own positive account of the passive powers of \nbodies. \n",
