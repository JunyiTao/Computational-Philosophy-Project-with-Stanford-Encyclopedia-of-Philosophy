    "main_text": "Empathy as the Unique Method of the Human Sciences || The Critique of Empathy in the Context of a Hermeneutic Conception of the Human Sciences\n3.1 The Critique of Empathy in the Context of a Hermeneutic Conception of the Human Sciences\n\nPhilosophers arguing for a hermeneutic conception of the human and\nsocial sciences insist on a strict methodological division between the\nhuman and the natural\n sciences.[3]\n Yet they nowadays favor the concept of understanding (Verstehen) and\nreject the earlier identification of understanding and empathy for two\nspecific reasons. First, empathy is no longer seen as the unique\nmethod of the human sciences because facts of significance, which a\nhistorian or an interpreter of literary and non-literary texts are\ninterested in, do not solely depend on facts within the individual\nmind. A historian, for example, is not bound by the agent\u2019s\nperspective in telling the story of a particular historical time\nperiod(Danto 1965). Similarly, philosophers such as Hans Georg\nGadamer, have argued that the significance of a text is not tied to\nthe author\u2019s intentions in writing the text. In reading a text\nby Shakespeare or Plato we are not primarily interested in finding out\nwhat Plato or Shakespeare said but what these texts themselves\nsay.(Gadamer 1989; for a critical discussion see Skinner (in Tully\n1988); \u201cIntroduction\u201d in K\u00f6gler and Stueber 2000; and\nStueber 2002).\n\nThe above considerations, however, do not justify the claim that\nempathy has no role to play within the context of the human sciences.\nIt justifies merely the claim that empathy cannot be their only\nmethod, at least as long as one admits that recognizing the thoughts\nof individual agents has to play some role in the interpretive project\nof the human sciences. Accordingly, a second reason against empathy is\nalso emphasized. Conceiving of understanding other agents as being\nbased on empathy is seen as an epistemically extremely na\u00efve\nconception of the interpretation of individual agents, since it seems\nto conceive of understanding as a mysterious meeting of two individual\nminds outside of any cultural context. Individual agents are always\nsocially and culturally embedded creatures. Understanding other agents\nthus presupposes an understanding of the cultural context within which\nan agent functions. Moreover, in the interpretive situation of the\nhuman sciences, the cultural background of the interpreter and the\nperson, who has to be interpreted, can be very different. In that\ncase, I can not very easily put myself in the shoes of the other\nperson and imitate his thoughts in my mind. If understanding medieval\nknights, to use an example of Winch (1958), requires me to think\nexactly as the medieval knight did, then it is not clear how such a\ntask can be accomplished from an interpretive perspective constituted\nby very different cultural presuppositions. Making sense of other\nminds has, therefore, to be seen as an activity that is a culturally\nmediated one; a fact that empathy theorists according to this line of\ncritique do not sufficiently take into account when they conceive of\nunderstanding other agents as a direct meeting of minds that is\nindependent of and unaided by information about how these agents are\nembedded in a broader social environment. (See Stueber 2006, chap.6,\nZahavi 2001, 2005; for the later Dilthey see Makreel 2000. For a\ncritical discussion of whether the concept of understanding without\nrecourse to empathy is useful for marking an epistemic distinction\nbetween the human and natural sciences consult also Stueber 2012b.\nWithin the context of anthropology, Hollan and Throop argue that\nempathy is best understood as a dynamic, culturally situated,\ntemporally extended, and dialogical process actively involving not\nonly the interpreter but also his or her interpretee. See Hollan\n20012; Hollan and Throop 2008, 2001; Throop 2010).).\n",
