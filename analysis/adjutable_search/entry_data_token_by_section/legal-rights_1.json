    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Methodology\n2. What Rights Are: Methodology\n\nA (valid) legal norm is a legal right if and only if it exhibits the\nform\n (Section 3)\n and function\n (Section 4)\n of the more general category of a \u201cright\u201d. Accordingly, a\nlegal norm labeled a \u201cright\u201d not exhibiting these features\nis arguably mislabeled. Theories identifying the form (the normative\nstructure) and \u201cfunction\u201d (i.e., what rights are for) of\nrights oscillate between and at times combine two approaches. One is\ndescriptive, distilling and systematizing primary features permeating\nthe common understanding and the core of \u201crights\u201d\ndiscourse (be it legal, moral, or social). Second, rights theories are\nalso purificatory and even prescriptive, injecting rationality,\ncoherence, and value into their account of what a right is, even if\npartially revisionary and to the exclusion of some of the discourse.\nFor reflections on the methodology of rights theory see Hart (1982:\n188\u2013193), Raz (1986: 165\u2013168); Kramer (1998: 22\u201335);\nWenar (2008: 251\u2013267); and, Van Duffel (2017: 187\u2013202).\n\n",
