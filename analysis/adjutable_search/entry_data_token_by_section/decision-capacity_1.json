    "main_text": "Terminology || Descriptive vs. Prescriptive\n1.2 Descriptive vs. Prescriptive\n\nWhatever term one settles on, it is also important to be aware that\nthese terms can be, and often are used in both descriptive as well as\nprescriptive or normative senses. As one commentator explains: \n\n\na psychiatrist may give expert testimony, in his capacity as a trained\nobserver, about a person\u2019s competence seen as a factual matter,\nand the judge may or may not give this testimony practical effect in\ndeciding how we ought to treat that person. (Freedman 1981: 55) \n\n\nIn this example, the first claim addresses the issue whether the\nindividual is decisionally capable. The second claim\naddresses the issue whether the individual should be\nconsidered decisionally capable, i.e., whether she ought to be allowed\nto make her own decisions and have these honored. In many contexts, if\na person is thought to have capacity (to factually possess certain\nrelevant mental abilities) the normative implications simply follow as\na matter of course. But as the example above reminds us, this is not\nalways the case. In some contexts, for example in courts, the person\nwho determines the facts about ability may not be the same person who\nissues the normative conclusion.\n\nThe distinction is particularly important to keep in mind in light of\nthe fact that there are ongoing debates about what capacity\nis\u2014debates that occur at various theoretical levels. At the\nfirst and most abstract level, we may be interested in clarifying our\nconcept or theory of decision-making capacity. To do\nthis we may ask what exactly it is that we are trying to do when we\nsort people into competent and incompetent. Asking such foundational\nquestions may help us get clearer about the work we need a concept or\ntheory of capacity to do. Closely related to debates about\nconcept/theory are debates about standards. At this level we\nask: what sorts of things should someone who has capacity in our\ndefined sense be able to do? What specific abilities are the right\nones to consider in light of the work the concept does? The most\ncommonly accepted standards are outlined in\n \u00a74\n below. As we will see, some theorists believe that this list of\nstandards is incomplete, in the sense that someone could satisfy these\nstandards and yet fail to satisfy our basic concept of capacity.\nFinally, there are specific tests or instruments developed to\ndetermine whether or not (and to what extent) a particular individual\nsatisfies the standards (Buchanan & Brock 1989). Confusion enters\nin because both empirical and normative claims can and do occur at all\nof these levels. Suppose, for example, that you examine A using\na particular instrument, and then declare on that basis that A\nhas the capacity to make decision X. And suppose I reject your\nclaim, i.e., I refuse to give normative force to your descriptive\nclaim. There may be several different reasons for this. I may doubt\nthat you used the instrument properly. Or I may doubt that the\ninstrument, even when used properly, is a good measure of whether\nsomeone meets the appropriate standards. Finally, I may simply think\nthat the operative theory or concept underlying the standards is\nincomplete\u2014that to truly determine capacity in a way that would\nlicense the normative conclusions, we need to consider more than just\nthe articulated standards.\n",
