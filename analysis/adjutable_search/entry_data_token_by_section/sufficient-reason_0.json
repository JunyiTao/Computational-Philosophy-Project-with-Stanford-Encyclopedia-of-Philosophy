    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nSuppose you enter a farmers\u2019 market, pick out a few cucumbers\nand ask the merchant for the price. \u201cFive dollars a\npound\u201d. A bit expensive, you may think, but you pay. Before you\nleave the stand two other people approach the seller with the very\nsame question (\u201cHow much are the cucumbers?\u201d). \u201cA\ndollar a pound\u201d, she says to the one; \u201cTen dollars a\npound\u201d, she tells the other. At least two of you are likely to\nattack the merchant with a simple question: Why the price discrepancy?\nOf course, you may simply leave the place if you have a simple\nexplanation for the discrepancy (for example, that both you and the\nperson who was asked to pay ten dollars a pound belong to commonly\ndiscriminated minorities). You may also conclude that the seller is\njust out of her mind (or that she is just conducting a psychological\nexperiment). In all of these cases you will be entertaining an\nexplanation or reason for a fact that appears odd.\nBut what kinds of facts demand an explanation? Do all\nfacts\u2014including the most ordinary ones\u2014demand an\nexplanation? If you accept an unrestricted form of the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason (= PSR), you will require an explanation for\nany fact, or in other words, you will reject the possibility\nof any brute, or unexplainable, facts.\n\nA simple formulation of the principle is as follows:\n\n(1)\nFor every fact \\(F\\), there must be a sufficient reason why\n\\(F\\) is the case.\n\n\nThe term \u201cfact\u201d in the above formulation is not intended\nto express any commitment to an ontology of facts. Still, if one\nwishes to avoid such connotations, the principle can be formulated\nmore schematically:\n\n(2)\nFor every \\(x\\), there is a \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\)\nis the sufficient reason for \\(x\\) (formally:\n\\(\\forall x\\exists y\\, Ryx\\) [where\n\u201c\\(Ryx\\)\u201d denotes the binary relation of providing a\nsufficient reason]).\n\n\nThe PSR is, in fact, a family of principles which are\ngenerated by various restrictions of (2), and by ascriptions of\ndifferent degrees of modal strength to (2). To begin with, variants of\nthe PSR may differ according to how they restrict the kinds of\nthings that require a reason (the explananda). Thus, one might\nrestrict the PSR to only actual entities, or include possibilia as\nwell. Alternatively, one might formulate the PSR as requiring a\nsufficient reason for every (true) proposition or as pertaining to\nentities and their properties. A variant of the PSR restricted to\nentities might require an explanation for the existence and\nnon-existence of entities, or it might be further restricted by\nrequiring a reason only for the existence (or only for the\nnon-existence) of entities. A version of the PSR that is restricted to\npropositions might range over both contingent and necessary\npropositions, or it might be further restricted to only one of these\nsub-domains.\n\nSimilarly, different versions of the PSR issue from various ways of\nrestricting the kinds of things that count as providing a\nreason (the explanantia). It is likely (though not necessary)\nthat one\u2019s decision about the kinds of explananda that fall\nunder the range of the PSR will determine the kinds of things counted\nas explanantia.\n\nVariants of the PSR may be generated not only by placing restrictions\non the relata at stake (both the explananda and the explanantia), but\nalso on the notion of the relation at stake. Frequently, the relation\nof providing a reason is conceived as irreflexive, antisymmetric and\ntransitive, though each of these characteristics may be, and indeed\nhave been, challenged. The relation of providing a reason can be\nconceived as an ontological relation (as in contemporary discussions\nof ground), or as a purely epistemological relation.\n\nA modally strong version of the PSR will take the Principle as\nnecessary and obtaining in all possible worlds, while a weak modal\nversion will present the Principle as merely contingently true.\nAnother distinction can be drawn between a factive, as\nopposed to merely regulative, version of the Principle. A\nregulative version of the PSR would consider it as a condition for\nintelligibility (on a par with the Law of Non-Contradiction) and\nthus as guiding our studying of nature. The factive version simply\nstates that the Principle is true in actuality (or even in all\npossible worlds). The regulative and the factive versions differ in\nterms of allowing for the falsification of the principle. The factive\nversion could be easily refuted by a single counter-example. A\nproponent of the regulative variant of the PSR would argue that an\nempirical falsification of the PSR makes as little sense as an\nempirical falsification of the Law of Non-Contradiction. Encountering\na fact which seems to have no explanation, the proponent of\nthe regulative variant would respond by insisting that we must keep\nsearching for an explanation.\n\nA proponent of the unrestricted version of the PSR could argue that\none\u2019s choice of a specific variant of the PSR cannot be\narbitrary, on pain of inconsistency (i.e., one must provide a reason\nwhy to prefer one variant over others). Relying on this last point,\nshe may further contend that in the absence of compelling reasons to\nthe contrary, the unrestricted version of the Principle should be\nconsidered as default.\n\nOne of the most interesting questions regarding the PSR is why accept\nit at all. Insofar as the PSR stipulates that all things must be\nexplainable, it seems that the PSR itself demands an explanation.\nSeveral modern philosophers attempted to provide a proof for the PSR,\nthough so far these attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Another\nimportant question related to the PSR is the possibility of\nself-explanatory facts and self-caused entities; particularly, one\nmight wonder how these are distinguished from unexplainable, brute\nfacts and uncaused entities. One might also wonder whether the PSR\nallows for any primitive concepts that cannot be further\nexplained.\n\nA third crucial problem for proponents of the PSR is how to address\nthe Agrippan Trilemma between the apparently exhaustive three horns\nof: (i) acceptance of brute facts, (ii) acceptance of an infinite\nregress of explanation (or grounding), or (iii) acceptance of\nself-explanatory facts. Prima facie, each horn in the\ntrilemma undermines the position of the proponent of the PSR.\n\nFinally, the proponent of the PSR faces intriguing problems in\naddressing perfectly symmetrical states. We have seen that some\nvariants of the PSR require an explanation for the existence of\nthings (thus, assuming nonexistence as a \u201cdefault\u201d\nstate requiring no explanation), while other variants require an\nexplanation for both the existence and nonexistence of\nthings. Let us look quickly at the latter\n(\u201cdefault\u201d-free) variant. Specifically, we might wonder\nhow a proponent of the \u201cdefault\u201d-free variant of the PSR\nwould respond to a situation in which we have neither a reason for the\nexistence of \\(x\\), nor have a reason for the non-existence of\n\\(x\\)? A proponent of the PSR might indeed respond by denying the\npossibility of such a scenario (given the PSR and bivalence). A\nsimilar dilemma might be raised with regard to issues of identity:\ngiven the absence of a reason for the identity of \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\), as well as for their non-identity, should we assume either\nidentity or non-identity as a default\n position?[1]\n\nWith these general considerations in place, let us examine the\nhistorical role that the Principle has played. The term\n\u201cPrinciple of Sufficient Reason [principe de raison\nsuffisante/principium reddendae rationis]\u201d was coined by\nLeibniz, though Spinoza is thought by many scholars to have preceded\nLeibniz in appreciating the importance of the Principle and placing it\nat the center of his philosophical\n system.[2]\n The Principle seems at first sight to have a strong intuitive\nappeal\u2014we always ask for explanations\u2014yet it is taken by\nmany to be too bold and expensive due to the radical implications it\nseems to yield. Among the alleged consequences of the Principle are:\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles, necessitarianism, the relativity of\nspace and time, the existence of a self-necessitated Being (i.e.,\nGod), and the Principle of Plenitude.\n\nThough there are several important precursors who, as we will see,\nseem to advocate variants of the PSR before the modern period, we will\nbegin our discussion with the two main expositors of the Principle:\nSpinoza and Leibniz.\n",
