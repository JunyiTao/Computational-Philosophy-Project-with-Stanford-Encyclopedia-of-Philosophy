    "main_text": "Dingle\u2019s Denoument || The Counterattack\n6.5 The Counterattack\n\nBut Milne, Eddington, and Dirac had their supporters as well. N.R.\nCampbell, whose theory of science was already well-known, makes an\nuncontroversial interpretation of the affair. \u201cScience\u201d he\nbegins, \u201c(or at least physics) has long consisted of two\ndistinct but complementary activities\u201d, one of which is\nexperimental and empirical; \u201cits procedure is induction.\u201d\nThe other activity attempts to provide explanations of scientific\nlaws, which explanations have the \u201cpecularity\u201d that\n\u201cthey often (not always) predict new laws in addition to\nexplaining old ones.\u201d Campbell cannot resist ending on an ad\nhominem of his own: \u201cIf he [Dingle] does not deem it\nimportant to observe the distinction between what is and what is not\ndemonstrable experiment, surely he should welcome a movement to\namalgamate the Royal with the Aristotelian Society.\u201d Indeed.\n\nG.J. Whitrow, then a young lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford, returns\nto the mathematical theme. Dingle, he argues, \u201cnot only attacks\nthe particular methods adopted by contemporary mathematical\ninvestigators in relativistic cosmology, but even refuses to admit\nthat this subject is worthy of scientific investigation as it is based\nnot only on experience but also on reason.\u201d Hypotheses, by this\nlight, may originate rationalistically as well as any other way,\ncertainly there is no problem with this.\n",
