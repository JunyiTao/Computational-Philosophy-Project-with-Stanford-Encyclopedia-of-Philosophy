    "main_text": "Forcing\n8. Forcing\n\nIn 1963, twenty-five years after G\u00f6del\u2019s proof of the\nconsistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF,\nPaul Cohen (1966) proved the consistency of the negation of the CH,\nand also of the negation of the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF.\nThus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is undecidable in ZFC, and the\nAC is undecidable in ZF. To achieve this, Cohen devised a new and\nextremely powerful technique, called forcing, for expanding\ncountable transitive models of ZF, or of ZFC.\n\nSince the axiom \\(V=L\\) implies the AC and the CH, any model of the\nnegation of the AC or the CH must violate \\(V=L\\). So, let\u2019s\nillustrate the idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the\nnegation of \\(V=L\\). We start with a transitive model \\(M\\) of ZFC,\nwhich we may assume, without loss of generality, to be a model of\n\\(V=L\\). To violate \\(V=L\\) we need to expand \\(M\\) by adding a new\nset \\(r\\) so that, in the expanded model, \\(r\\) will be\nnon-constructible. Since all hereditarily-finite sets are\nconstructible, we aim to add an infinite set of natural numbers. The\nfirst problem we face is that \\(M\\) may contain already all subsets of\n\\(\\omega\\). Fortunately, by the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem for\nfirst-order logic, \\(M\\) has an elementary submodel which is\nisomorphic to a countable transitive model \\(N\\). So, since we are\nonly interested in the statements that hold in \\(M\\), and not in \\(M\\)\nitself, we may as well work with \\(N\\) instead of \\(M\\), and so we may\nassume that \\(M\\) itself is countable. Then, since\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)\\) is uncountable, there are plenty of subsets of\n\\(\\omega\\) that do not belong to \\(M\\). But, unfortunately, we cannot\njust pick any infinite subset \\(r\\) of \\(\\omega\\) that does not belong\nto \\(M\\) and add it to \\(M\\). The reason is that \\(r\\) may encode a\nlot of information, so that when added to \\(M\\), \\(M\\) is no longer a\nmodel of ZF, or it is still a model of \\(V=L\\). To avoid this, one\nneeds to pick \\(r\\) with great care. The idea is to pick \\(r\\)\ngeneric over \\(M\\), meaning that \\(r\\) is built from its\nfinite approximations in such a way that it does not have any property\nthat is definable in \\(M\\) and can be avoided. For example, by viewing\n\\(r\\) as an infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing\norder, the property of \\(r\\) containing only finitely-many even\nnumbers can be avoided, because given any finite approximation to\n\\(r\\)\u2014i.e., any finite increasing sequence of natural\nnumbers\u2014one can always extend it by adding more even numbers, so\nthat at the end of the construction \\(r\\) will contain infinitely-many\neven numbers; while the property of containing the number 7 cannot be\navoided, because when a finite approximation to \\(r\\) contains the\nnumber 7, then it stays there no matter how the construction of \\(r\\)\nproceeds. Since \\(M\\) is countable, there are such generic \\(r\\). Then\nthe expanded model \\(M[r]\\), which includes \\(M\\) and contains the new\nset \\(r\\), is called a generic extension of \\(M\\). Since we\nassumed \\(M\\) is a transitive model of \\(V=L\\), the model \\(M[r]\\) is\njust \\(L_\\alpha (r)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the supremum of the\nordinals of \\(M\\). Then one can show, using the forcing\nrelation between finite approximations to \\(r\\) and formulas in the\nlanguage of set theory expanded with so-called names for sets\nin the generic extension, that \\(M[r]\\) is a model of ZFC and \\(r\\) is\nnot constructible in \\(M[r]\\), hence the axiom of constructibility\n\\(V=L\\) fails.\n\nIn general, a forcing extension of a model \\(M\\) is obtained by adding\nto \\(M\\) a generic subset \\(G\\) of some partially ordered set\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) that belongs to \\(M\\). In the above example,\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) would be the set of all finite increasing sequences of\nnatural numbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite\nsequence \\(r\\), ordered by \\(\\subseteq\\); and \\(G\\) would be the set\nof all finite initial segments of \\(r\\).\n\nIn the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one\nstarts from a model \\(M\\) of ZFC, as before, and adds \\(\\aleph_2\\) new\nsubsets of \\(\\omega\\), so that in the generic extension the CH fails.\nIn this case one needs to use an appropriate partial ordering\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) so that the \\(\\aleph_2\\) of \\(M\\) is not\ncollapsed, i.e., it is the same as the \\(\\aleph_2\\) of the\ngeneric extension, and thus the generic extension \\(M[G]\\) will\nsatisfy the sentence that says that there are \\(\\aleph_2\\) real\nnumbers.\n",
