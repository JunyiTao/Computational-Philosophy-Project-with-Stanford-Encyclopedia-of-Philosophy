    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Objectivity\n2.2 Objectivity\n\nA second objection to fictionalism is based on the idea that\nfictionalists cannot account for the objectivity of\nmathematics. It is an obvious fact about mathematical practice that\nthere\u2019s some sort of objectivity at work in that practice.\nThere\u2019s an important difference in mathematics between sentences\nlike \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 and \u20183 is prime\u2019 on the one\nhand and \u20182 + 2 = 5\u2019 and \u20183 is composite\u2019 on\nthe other. There\u2019s obviously some sense in which the\nfirst two sentences, but not the second two, are\n\u201ccorrect\u201d, or \u201cright\u201d, or \u201cgood\u201d,\nor some such thing. The most obvious thing to say here is that the\nfirst two sentence are true whereas the latter two are\nfalse. But fictionalists cannot say this; they\u2019re\ncommitted to saying that all four of these sentences are untrue. Thus,\nthe question arises whether fictionalists have any adequate account of\nthe objectivity of mathematics\u2014i.e., of the differences between\nthese two kinds of sentences.\n\nOnce again, there are two different responses that fictionalists have\ngiven to this problem. These two responses give us versions of\nfictionalism that, for lack of a better pair of terms, can be called\nformalistic fictionalism and non-formalistic\nfictionalism.\n\nThe formalistic view has been developed by Field (1980, 1989, 1998).\nOn his view, the difference between \u20183 is prime\u2019 and\n\u20183 is composite\u2019 is analogous to the difference between,\nsay, \u2018Santa Claus wears a red suit\u2019 and \u2018Santa Claus\nwears a green suit\u2019. More specifically, Field\u2019s idea is\nthat the difference between sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019\nand \u20183 is composite\u2019 is that the former (but not the\nlatter) are part of a certain well-known \u201cstory\u201d, namely,\nthe story of mathematics. Field puts this point by saying that while\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 and \u20183 is composite\u2019 are both\nstrictly untrue, the former is true in the story of\nmathematics, whereas the latter is not. Now, most of\nField\u2019s view here is consistent with both formalistic\nfictionalism and non-formalistic fictionalism. The difference between\nthese two views has to do with what fictionalists take the story of\nmathematics to consist in. For Field, the story of mathematics\nconsists essentially in a bunch of formal systems, namely, the ones\nthat we currently accept. More precisely, he says (1998, p. 391) that\na mathematical sentence is fictionalistically correct if and only if\nit is \u201ca consequence of accepted axioms [in\na]\u2026sense of consequence that goes a bit beyond first-order\nconsequence in including the logic of the quantifier \u2018only\nfinitely many\u2019\u201d. So on this view, the difference between\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 and \u20183 is\ncomposite\u2019\u2014the reason the former are \u201ccorrect\u201d\nand the latter are not\u2014is that the former follow from accepted\nmathematical axioms. (This view has also been endorsed by Leng (2010);\nshe says that mathematical acceptability comes down to following from\naccepted axioms.)\n\nBalaguer (2001, 2009) argues that Field\u2019s formalistic view\ncan\u2019t be right, and he develops a non-formalistic alternative to\nit. His argument against the formalistic view is that it cannot\naccount for all of the objectivity that we find in mathematics. Most\nimportantly, the formalistic view entails (incorrectly) that there can\nbe no objectively correct answers to questions that ask about the\ntruth values of mathematical sentences that are undecidable in\ncurrently accepted mathematical theories. The most famous example here\nis probably the continuum hypothesis (CH), which is undecidable in\ncurrently accepted set theories, e.g., Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\n(ZF). (In other words, ZF is consistent with both CH and ~CH; i.e.,\nZF+CH and ZF+~CH are both consistent set theories.) Given this, it\nfollows from Field\u2019s view that neither CH nor ~CH is part of the\nstory of mathematics and, hence, that there is no objectively correct\nanswer to the CH question. This, however, seems unacceptable, because\nit could turn out that mathematicians are going to discover\nan objectively correct answer to the CH question. For instance,\nsuppose that some mathematician came up with a new axiom candidate AX\nsuch that (i) all mathematicians agreed that AX was an intuitively\nobvious claim about sets, and (ii) ZF+AX entailed CH. If this\nhappened, then mathematicians would say that they had proven\nCH, and that they had discovered that CH was correct, and so\non. Field\u2019s view would force us to say that if we endorsed AX,\nthen CH would become true in the story of mathematics. But\nthis seems to get things wrong. Given the intuitive obviousness of AX,\nit seems very natural to say that, in this scenario, mathematicians\ndiscovered that CH had been true (or \u201ccorrect\u201d, or true in\nthe story of mathematics, or whatever we want to call it) all\nalong\u2014i.e., that we didn\u2019t just make this up by\nendorsing a new theory. And, again, it seems that this is what\nmathematicians would say. So, Balaguer argues, Field\u2019s\nformalistic view of the objectivity of mathematics is\nunacceptable.\n\nBalaguer\u2019s non-formalistic version of fictionalism retains\nField\u2019s thesis that mathematical \u201ccorrectness\u201d has\nto do with being true in the story of mathematics, but it abandons the\nFieldian view that the story of mathematics consists in currently\naccepted axioms. According to Balaguer, the so-called \u201cstory of\nmathematics\u201d consists in the thesis that there actually exist\nabstract mathematical objects of the kinds that platonists have in\nmind, i.e., the kinds that our mathematical theories purport to be\nabout. Thus, on this view, a mathematical sentence is\nfictionalistically correct if and only if it would have been true if\nthere had actually existed abstract mathematical objects of the kinds\nthat platonists have in mind. Balaguer argues that if fictionalists\nadopt this view, they can avoid the above problem with Field\u2019s\nview and, more generally, they can completely solve the problem of\nobjectivity because they can mimic everything platonists say about\nobjectivity. \n",
