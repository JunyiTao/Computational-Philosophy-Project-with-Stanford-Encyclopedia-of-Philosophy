    "main_text": "Kinds of Judgments || Kinds of logical form\n2.1 Kinds of logical form\n\nThe modern conception of logical form\u2014as found, e.g., in the\nsymbolic and mathematical logic of Gottlob Frege\u2019s\nBegriffsschrift (\u201cConceptual Notation\u201d) (Frege\n1972), Bertrand Russell and A.N. Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1962), and Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n(Wittgenstein 1922)\u2014owes much to Kant\u2019s conception of\nlogical form, if not so very much to his particular conception of\nlogic, which from a contemporary point of view can seem\n\u201cterrifyingly narrow-minded and mathematically trivial,\u201d\nas Allen Hazen has drily put it (Hazen 1999). On the other hand,\nhowever, it is clearly true that Kant\u2019s conception of\nmathematical form, which is found in his theory of pure or\nformal intuition, substantially influenced Wittgenstein\u2019s view\nof logical form in the Tractatus (Wittgenstein 1922, props.\n2.013, 5.552, 5.61, and 6.13). There is an ongoing scholarly debate\nabout whether Kant\u2019s conception of mathematical form is a direct\nexpression of the narrow-mindedness of his logical theory, or instead\na direct expression of the striking originality of his philosophy of\nmathematics (Parsons 1983, Friedman 1992, Shabel 2003, Hanna 2006b,\nch. 6, Shabel 2006). But even more importantly, Kant\u2019s deep idea\nthat logic and logical form can exist only in the context of the\njudging activities and judging capacities of rational human\nanimals, has heavily influenced some heavily influential\nphilosophers of logic, linguists, philosophers of language, and\ncognitive scientists from Boole and Wilhelm von Humboldt (Von Humboldt\n1988), to Frege, the later Wittgenstein, and Noam Chomsky\n(Wittgenstein 1953, para. 241\u2013242, Chomsky 1975, Bell 1979, Bell\n1987).\n2.1.1 Pure general logic and the table of judgments\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n every judgment for Kant has an intrinsic logical form. These logical\nforms correspond one-to-one to the pure concepts of the understanding\nor categories, a claim which is argued-for in what Kant calls the\nmetaphysical deduction of the categories\n(A76\u201383/B102\u2013109, B159). On the basis of this, it is\npossible to argue that all concepts, whether pure or empirical, have a\nlogical ground (Newton 2015). In any case, the total set of such\nlogical forms/pure concepts is the \u201ctable of judgments,\u201d\nwhich Kant also describes as \u201cthe functions of unity in\njudgments\u201d (A69/B94, emphasis added). He does this in order\nto draw special attention to the fact that for him the very idea of a\nlogical form/pure concept is essentially judgment-based: logical form\nis nothing but the intrinsic logico-syntactic and logico-semantic form\nof and in a proposition. So for Kant the\npropositional content of a judgment is more explanatorily basic than\nits logical form or pure-conceptual structure.\n\nThe table of judgments, in turn, captures a fundamental part of the\nscience of pure general logic: pure, because it is a priori,\nnecessary, hence strictly universally true, and also without any\nassociated sensory content; general, because it is strictly\nunderdetermined by all objectively valid representational contents and\nalso abstracts away from all specific or particular differences\nbetween represented objects (cf. MacFarlane 2002), and thereby\n\u201chas to do with nothing but the mere form of thinking\u201d\n(A54/B78); and logic because, in addition to the table of\njudgments, it also systematically provides categorically normative\nconditio sine qua non rules for the truth of judgments (i.e.,\nthe law of non-contradiction or logical consistency) and for valid\ninference (i.e., the law of logical consequence)\n(A52\u201355/B76\u201379) (9: 11\u201316).\n\nIn this connection, there are two crucial points to note about\nKant\u2019s pure general logic.\n\nFirst, pure general logic is sharply distinct from\ntranscendental logic, in that, although both logics are pure\nand a priori, whereas pure general logic is \u201cgeneral\u201d in\nthat it is strictly underdetermined by all objectively valid\nrepresentational contents and also abstracts away from all specific or\nparticular differences between represented objects, hence is\nontically unrestricted, nevertheless transcendental logic is\n\u201cspecial\u201d in that it is ontically restricted,\ni.e., objectually-committed, and thereby presupposes the existence of\ncertain specific categories or kinds (including natural kinds) of\nobjects (A55\u201357/B79\u201382). In this way, transcendental logic\npresupposes pure general logic, and is synthetic a priori, not\nanalytic. Some recent Kant-commentators, however, have argued that on\nthe contrary, pure general logic presupposes transcendental logic\n(see, e.g., R\u00f6dl 2008, Tolley 2012), on the grounds that for\nKant, thought by its very nature is object-directed. But the\ngenerality and inherently formal character of pure general logic is\nfully consistent with its being objectively valid: hence the fact that\nthought by its very nature is object-directed does not by\nitself imply that the logic governing thought is ontically\nrestricted or objectually-committed.\n\nSecond, pure general logic is absolutely binding on any rational human\nthinker and provides an unconditional logical ought: the laws\nof logic are the categorically normative laws of thought for all\nactual and possible rational animals. Thus pure general logic is both\na formal science and also a moral science, but not a\nnatural science. As such, pure general logic fully heeds the\nlesson of the Naturalistic Fallacy, that is, the irreducibility of the\nought to the is. Correspondingly, just like the\nunconditional moral ought, as expressed by the Categorical\nImperative, the logical ought, as expressed by, e.g., the law\nof non-contradiction, is rarely correctly obeyed in the real world by\nfinite flawed thinkers like us, who commit logical fallacies and moral\nsins with comparable frequency: sadly, ought does not entail\nis. Still, as non-naturalistic, Kant\u2019s pure general\nlogic is irreducible to all contingent facts and especially to all\nempirical psychological facts; hence his logic is thoroughly\nanti-psychologistic, which exploits the flip-side of unconditional\nobligation, whether logical or moral: happily, is does not\nentail ought.\n\nKant\u2019s table of judgments lays out a (putatively) exhaustive\nlist of the different possible logical forms of propositions under\nfour major headings, each major heading containing three sub-kinds, as\nfollows.\n\nTable of Judgments\n\nQuantity of Judgments: Universal, Particular, Singular.\nQuality: Affirmative, Negative, Infinite\nRelation: Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive\nModality: Problematic, Assertoric, Apodictic (A70/B95)\n\n\n\nConsistently with Kant\u2019s \u201cprivileging of\npredication,\u201d it is arguable that his logical forms are all\neither modifications or else truth-functional compounds of simple\nmonadic (i.e.,1-place) categorical (i.e., subject-predicate)\npropositions of the general form \u201cFs are\nGs.\u201d\n\nIn this way, e.g., the three kinds of quantity of judgments\nare supposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which the\ncomprehensions of the two constituent concepts of a simple monadic\ncategorical proposition are logically combined and separated. So Kant\nsays that universal judgments are of the form \u201cAll Fs\nare Gs\u201d; that particular judgments are of the form\n\u201cSome Fs are Gs\u201d; and that singular\njudgments are of the form \u201cThis F is G\u201d\nor \u201cThe F is G.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the three kinds of quality of judgments are\nsupposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which the\nconstituent concepts of a simple monadic categorical judgment can be\neither existentially posited or gesetzt, or else\nexistentially cancelled or aufhebe, by respectively assigning\nnon-empty actual extensions to concepts, or null actual extensions to\nconcepts (A594\u2013595/622\u2013623). So Kant says that affirmative\njudgments are of the form \u201cit is the case that Fs are\nGs\u201d (or more simply: \u201cFs are\nGs\u201d), negative judgments are of the form \u201cno\nFs are Gs\u201d; and infinite judgments are of the\nform \u201cFs are non-Gs.\u201d\n\nBy contrast again, the three kinds of relation of judgments\nare supposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which simple\n1-place subject-predicate propositions can be either atomic\n(elementary) or molecular (compound) in respect of their truth-values.\nSo Kant says that categorical judgments repeat the simple atomic\n1-place subject-predicate form \u201cFs are\nGs\u201d; molecular hypothetical judgments are of the form\n\u201cIf Fs are Gs, then Hs are\nIs\u201d (or: \u201cIf P then Q\u201d);\nand molecular disjunctive judgments are of the form \u201cFs\nare either Gs or Hs or \u2026\u201d (where each\npartition of the total domain is mutually exclusive and the total set\nof partitions is exhaustive).\n\nBy contrast yet again and finally, the three kinds of\nmodality of a judgment are supposed by Kant to capture the\nthree basic ways in which the copula of a simple 1-place\nsubject-predicate proposition \u201ccontributes nothing to the\ncontent of the judgment \u2026 but rather concerns only the value of\nthe copula in relation to thinking in general\u201d\n(A74/B99\u2013100). This doctrine might seem to confuse the three\npropositional attitudes of \u201copining\u201d (Meinen),\nepistemic belief, and certainty (A820\u2013823/B848\u2013851), as\ndiscussed in the supplementary document\n Judging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing,\n with the alethic modal notions of possibility, actuality, and\nnecessity. Or even worse, it might seem to psychologize modality.\n\nAnd this in turn raises in a pointed way a general difficulty in the\ncommon interpretation of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment: the tendency\nto hold that his logic and theory of judgment are at bottom\nepistemological or empirical psychological theories. But this common\ninterpretation, as specifically applied to Kant\u2019s view of the\nmodality of judgments, should be rejected for four reasons. First, he\nexplicitly isolates and discusses propositional attitudes in the\ncontext of his epistemology of judgment and his ethics of belief, so\nit is obvious that he does not confuse logical modality with\npropositional attitudes. Second, he firmly rejects logical\npsychologism, as we have already seen. Third, the notion of\n\u201cvalue\u201d (Wert) here clearly means the\ntruth-value of a whole proposition, not its propositional\ncontent specifically, which explains why a modal predicate\n\u201ccontributes nothing to the content of a judgment,\u201d i.e.,\nit contributes nothing to the specific content of a judgment\nover and above its truth-value. Fourth and most importantly, the\nnotion of \u201cthinking in general\u201d for Kant is the conceptual\nequivalent of Leibnizian logically possible worlds (Bxvii n.,\nA573/B601). Thus the three kinds of modality of a judgment for Kant\nare, at bottom, the three basic ways in which truth can be assigned to\nsimple 1-place subject-predicate propositions, or to non-categorical\nsentential propositions, across logically possible\nworlds\u2014whether to some worlds (possibility), to this world alone\n(actuality, as essentially indexically determined by human sensory\nintuition/non-conceptual cognition), or to all worlds (necessity). So\nKant says that problematic judgments are of the form \u201cPossibly,\nFs are Gs\u201d (or: \u201cPossibly\nP\u201d); assertoric judgments are of the form\n\u201cActually, Fs are Gs\u201d (or:\n\u201cActually P\u201d); and apodictic judgments are of the\nform \u201cNecessarily, Fs are Gs\u201d (or:\n\u201cNecessarily P\u201d).\n\nSee the supplementary document:\n\nDo the Apparent Limitations and Confusions of Kant\u2019s Logic Undermine his Theory of Judgment?\n\n",
