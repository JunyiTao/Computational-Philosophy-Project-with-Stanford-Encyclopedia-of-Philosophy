    "main_text": "Early Writings || Evolutionary Ethics\n2.2 Evolutionary Ethics\n\nAlexander\u2019s first monograph, Moral Order and\nProgress (1889), defends evolutionary ethics, the\nnaturalist thesis that human morality is a product of biological\nevolution. The monograph is based on a dissertation written by\nAlexander at Oxford, for which he won the 1887 T. H. Green Moral\nPhilosophy Prize. In the preface, Alexander writes,\n\n\nI am proud to have my work connected, however indirectly, with the\nname of T. H. Green; and I feel this all the more because, though, as\nwill be obvious, my obligations to him are very great, I have not\nscrupled to express my present dissent from his fundamental\nprinciples. (vii)\n\n\nThe preface also reveals the strong idealist backdrop against which\nAlexander\u2019s work is set: the monograph is dedicated to A. C.\nBradley, and in the preface Alexander personally thanks D. G. Ritchie,\nWilliam Wallace, R. L. Nettleship, and J. S. Haldane. Alexander adds\nthat he owes a special debt of gratitude to F. H. Bradley, who went\nthrough the essay with him (Alexander 1889: ix). Alexander continued\nto exchange philosophic ideas with many of these idealists throughout\ntheir lives.\n\nAlexander opens the monograph by stating that the proper business of\nethics is the study of moral judgements, such as \u201cIt is wrong to\nlie\u201d. Alexander sets out to discover the nature of morality,\nasking what these judgements actually express (Alexander 1889:\n1\u20133). He does so by examining a selection of \u201cworking\nconceptions\u201d in ethics\u2014including right, wrong, and\nduty\u2014and asking what they correspond to. In the same way that\nthe working conceptions of physics\u2014including energy, matter and\nmotion\u2014are ordered according to a \u201cnatural\ncoherence\u201d, Alexander aims to order ethical conceptions.\nAlexander concludes that these working conceptions correspond to ways\nof maintaining equilibrium in society. For example, ideas of good or\nright imply nothing more than \u201can adjustment of parts in an\norderly whole\u201d: the equilibrium of different persons in\nsociety.\n\n\n[T]he predicate \u2018good\u2019 applied to an action\u2026 means\nthat the act is one by which the agent seeks to perform the function\nrequired of him by his position in society. (Alexander 1889: 113)\n\n\nAlexander takes this thesis to be the common ground of at least two\ncurrent rival ethical theories:\n\n\nNow nothing is more striking at the present time than the convergence\nof the main opposing ethical theories, at any rate, in our own\ncountry\u2014on the one hand, the traditional English mode of\nthought, which advancing through utilitarianism has ended in the\nso-called evolutionary ethics; and on the other, the idealistic\nmovement which is associated with the German philosophy derived from\nKant\u2026 Both these views recognise that kind of proportion\nbetween the individual and his society, or between him and the law,\nwhich is expressed under the phrase, organic connection. (Alexander\n1889: 5\u20136)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s perception of progress in ethical theory, towards\nthis correct end point, is Hegelian in style.\n\nAlexander\u2019s ethical system is a kind of evolutionary ethics,\nakin to that of Leslie Stephen. By applying evolution to\nethics, Alexander explains that one can mean either the mere\nintegration of the biological into the ethical sphere, or treating\nmorals as one part of a comprehensive view of the universe, in which a\nsteady development from the lower to the higher can be observed, a\ndevelopment which follows the law of the survival of the fittest\n(Alexander 1889: 14). Alexander, of course, means both. He emphasises\nthat while his ethical system, based on the organic nature of society,\nis due in part to the influence of the biological sciences, it would\nbe an \u201centire misapprehension\u201d to think that it were\nentirely due to this influence; his views are also the result of\nprogress in ethics and politics (Alexander 1889: 7\u20138).\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite the spectre of Hegelian idealism\nhovering in the background of this work, Alexander firmly resists\nidealism\u2019s tendency towards monism, the view that the universe is\nin some sense One:\n\n\n[T]he conception of a common good is apt to suggest an absolute\nidentity of good\u2026 in greater or less degree all forms of\nso-called Monism, which hold that in the good act the individual is at\none with others, and with the Universal Being, are victims of the\nmisconception. (Alexander 1889: 174)\n\n\nIn other words, Alexander is arguing that just because he is putting\nforward one conception of goodness\u2014organic connection within\nsociety\u2014we should not accept that individuals within society are\nnot individuals.\n",
