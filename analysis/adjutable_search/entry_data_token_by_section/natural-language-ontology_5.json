Theoretical linguistics has grown enormously over the last 70\nyears providing a wealth of semantic and syntactic generalizations and\ntheories, which permits a more systematic and accurate use of natural\nlanguage for metaphysical purposes. When pursued within the context of\ntheoretical linguistics, natural language ontology will also set its\nown ambitions regarding universals, the alignment of ontology with\nsyntax, the relation of ontology to lexical semantics, and the\nconnections of the ontology reflected in natural language to that\nreflected in cognition.\n\nAs regards\n [ii],\n there are specific reasons for a philosopher to pursue natural\nlanguage ontology. First of all, natural language ontology has an\nimportant contribution to make to descriptive metaphysics\n (\u00a72.1),\n as it deals with linguistic manifestations of intuitions bearing on\nmetaphysical issues. In fact, natural language ontology can be\nregarded a linguistically informed development of descriptive\nmetaphysics. \n\nSecond, various topics in metaphysics have evolved historically around\nlinguistic facts, generally used as manifestations of shared\nintuitions or of reality itself\n (\u00a71.2).\n By making full use of empirical and theoretical research in\nlinguistics, natural language ontology can shed a significant light on\nthose topics. For example, linguistic facts have played an important\nrole in the debate surrounding universals since the middle ages, where\nquestions were pursued such as whether wisdom is a term that\npicks out an abstract universal or just its various instances. Natural\nlanguage examples play a significant role also in contemporary\ndiscussions of abstract objects (Zalta 1983; Boolos 1998), properties\n(Chierchia & Turner 1988; Bealer 1993), and types (Wetzel 2009).\nThose discussions generally presuppose the view that natural language\nallows reference to a wide range of abstract objects, though that view\nhas been challenged on the basis of other linguistic generalizations\nand analyses\n (\u00a74.1).\n \n\nLinguistic facts, at least since Frege (1918/9), have also played a\ncentral role in motivating abstract propositions as truth bearers:\nthat-clauses appear to act as singular terms standing for\nabstract propositions, truth bearers that are both meanings of\nsentences and objects or contents of thought. Using a different range\nof linguistic data from Polish, German, and French (in three versions\nof the same article), Twardowski (1911) argued for non-enduring\nproducts of acts (\u201cclaims\u201d, \u201cjudgments\u201d,\n\u201cassumptions\u201d) being truth bearers rather than\npropositions, proposing a novel cognitively realistic yet not\npsychologistic account of the content of attitudes as well as the\nsubject matter of logic.\n\nFinally, linguistic facts play an important role in the debate about\nthe existence and nature of numbers. Frege\u2019s (1884) theory of\nnumbers as abstract objects was motivated by sentences such as the\nnumber of planets is eight, an apparent identity statement\ncontaining two apparent number-referring terms. More recent\nlinguistically oriented research has put into question whether\neight in that sentence really refers to a number rather than\nkeeping its \u201cadjectival\u201d meaning (as a quantifier or\nplural property) and moreover whether the number of planets\nin that sentence is really a number-referring term rather than acting\nas a \u201cconcealed question\u201d, standing for the question about\nhow many planets there are (Romero 2005; Hofweber 2016).\n\nSuch philosophical debates show that when metaphysical arguments rely\non linguistic data, those data need to be subject to serious\nlinguistic examination, in the recognition that natural language\nontology is also part of linguistics.\n",
