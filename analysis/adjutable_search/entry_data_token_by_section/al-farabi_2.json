    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nNext to the study of language, al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee considers\nlogic. For a long time the possibility of a serious study of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s logic remained somewhat elusive.\nEditions and translations of his logical works, except for his\n[\u2018Long\u2019] Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nInterpretatione (Zimmerman 1981), were scattered in\nvarious journals and collective works often difficult to access. Many\nof these texts were more critically edited and gathered\nin al-mantiq \u2018inda al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, ed. by\nRaf\u00eeq al-\u2018Ajam and Majid Fakhry in 4\nvol. (1985\u201387). In 1987\u201389 Muhammad Taq\u00ee\nD\u00e2nishpazuh published in Qumm a more complete collection of\nlogical texts, including a newly discovered part of a long commentary\non the Prior Analytics.  Soon afterwards, two books on Farabian logic followed: Shukri\nB. Abed, Aristotelian Logic and the Arabic Language in\nAlf\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (1991) and Joep\nLameer, Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee & Aristotelian\nSyllogistics: Greek Theory & Islamic Practice (1994). In 2006 Mauro Zonta published fragments of a long commentary\non the Categories in Hebrew, Arabic, and English translation. John\nWatt (2008) assessed the influence of the Syriac organon on\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee and Kamran Karimullah (2014) dedicated a\nlengthy article to al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s views on\nconditionals. Translations now are coming out: Alfarabi\u2019s Book of Dialectic (Kitab al-Jadal) (David M. Di Pasquale, 2019), and Al-Farabi, Syllogism (Wilfird Hodges & Saloua Chatti, forthcoming), as well as further studies of al-Farabi\u2019s logic by Saloua Chatti (2019) and papers by Terrence J. Kleven (2013)  and Riccardo Strobino (2019).\n\nSome issues dealt with in logic are also relevant to ethics and\nmetaphysics. Al-Farabi sees logic as the path to happiness (Germann, 2015). He also discusses the issue of future contingents. If the truth\nvalue of statements on future contingents is immediately determined,\ni.e., before the event happens, then everything is predetermined and\nfreewill is an illusion. Aristotle treats of this issue in On\nInterpretation, 9. Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee discusses more\ncomplex aspects of this issue as he adds a consideration of\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge and defends human freewill against some\ntheologians (see Peter Adamson (2006), \u201cThe Arabic Sea Battle:\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the Problem of future\nContingents\u201d).\n\nAs Deborah L. Black (1990) showed, following the Alexandrian\ntradition, philosophers in Islamic lands consider Rhetoric\nand Poetics as integral to logic proper and so parts of\nAristotle\u2019s Organon. Lahcen E. Ezzaher (2008:\n347\u201391) translated the short commentary on the Rhetoric.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Woerther (2018) & Maroun Aouad are preparing a\nnew edition of some of al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s texts on\nrhetoric. St\u00e9phane Diebler in Philosopher \u00e0 Bagdad\nau Xe si\u00e8cle (2007) [in fact a very useful collection of\ntranslations of short Farabian works] gave a French translation of the\nthree very brief treatises al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee dedicated to\nPoetics. Geert Jan van Gelder & Marl\u00e9 Hammond (2008:\n15\u201323) translated one of these treatises, The Book of\nPoetics, into English, as well as a brief relevant passage in the\nfirst part of The Great Book of Music. Terrence J. Kleven (2019) studies The Canons of Poetry.  Scholars interested in\npolitical philosophy have highlighted the distinctions\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee makes between (1) demonstrative discourse,\nreflecting Aristotle\u2019s positions in the Posterior\nAnalytics (in Arabic this text is known as The Book of\nDemonstration), and which alone is philosophical stricto\nsensu, (2) dialectical discourse, typical of the\n\u201cmutakallim\u00fbn\u201d or theologians and linked to\nAristotle\u2019s Topics, and (3) rhetorical and poetical\ndiscourse, used in the Qur\u2019\u00e2n or Jewish and Christian\nScriptures in order to address ordinary people. \n\nGreat respect for Aristotle\u2019s theory of demonstration led\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to attempt to fit any theoretical\ndiscipline in its framework, though some of them, such as music, do\nnot exclusively rest on necessary and universal primary principles, as\nthey also include principles derived from empirical observations\n(Miriam Galston, 2019). As music is dear to\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, it is in the first part of his Great\nBook on Music that we find the most extensive consideration of\nprimary empirical principles and their derivation from careful\nexamination of practice, i.e., in this case of musical\nperformances.\n",
