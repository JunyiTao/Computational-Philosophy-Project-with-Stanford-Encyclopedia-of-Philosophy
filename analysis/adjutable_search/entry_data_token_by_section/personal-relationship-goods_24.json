    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || Duty Bearers?\n5.6 Duty Bearers?\n\nSome believe that the duty to provide personal relationship goods is\nprimarily a responsibility of individuals, not of institutions,\nbecause\n\n\n[i]f no one will take on the job of associating with a given person,\nthen that person\u2019s social needs go unmet despite the presence of\nappropriate institutions. (Brownlee 2016a: 69)\n\n\nIt is not obvious that this argument succeeds. We all have an obvious\nand powerful interest in many personal relationship\ngoods\u2014especially in those that are necessary for survival,\nhealth and autonomy\u2014any yet it is often unclear who is under the\nduty to satisfy the interest. So, the question is whether the\nexistence of a right requires a priorly specified duty and\nduty-bearer. Some (Cowden 2012a, b) assume a positive answer, while\nothers (Brighouse & Swift 2014; Brownlee 2013) believe this is not\nnecessary on an interest theory of rights. If rights are grounded in\npowerful interests that can be satisfied without imposing\ndisproportionate burdens on others, it is possible to identify them\nprior to having in place a system that allocates correlative duties to\nparticular individuals.\n\nAnother question is whether there can be any direct duties to offer\ncompany, affection or even love, or whether duties with respect to\nproviding these goods are in fact merely duties to create the\nconditions in which personal relationships can thrive. One of the\narguments discussed above with respect to a possible right to parental\nlove may generalize to all types of love\u2014romantic, erotic,\nfriendship\u2014and even to lesser kinds of affection. It is possible\nthat one of the psychological needs met by close relationships is that\nothers want us to be part of their lives for self-interested reasons.\nWhen some people want our company for their own sake, this is a\nconfirmation that we are important for their well-being (in some cases\nin a non-fungible way). This kind of validation is possible only if\nthe love, or affection, is not entirely given out of duty. Therefore,\nit seems that a duty to provide this particular personal relationship\ngood\u2014the recognition that one is important for another\nperson\u2019s wellbeing\u2014would be self-defeating, because it\nwould be incompatible with some personal relationship goods having the\nfull the intrinsic value they have when given out of inclination.\nTherefore, it is possible that the reasons for offering love,\nfriendship, and even company may bear on the value of what is offered\nin a way in which the reasons for offering other kinds of goods do\nnot. It is possible that only love, friendship and company given out\nof certain reasons\u2014having to do with the appreciation of the\nindividuality of the one to whom they are offered\u2014will (fully)\ndo. (In contrast, the satisfaction of one\u2019s interests in, say,\nnutrition, shelter or health care, are indifferent to the reasons why\nothers are providing these goods.) Perhaps the best solution to this\nworry is to admit that perfect distributive justice can only be\nrealized indirectly, when people go above and beyond their duty in\nproviding personal relationship goods (Gheaus 2017).\n\nBoth considerations above suggest that, when people\u2019s powerful\ninterests in certain relationship goods generate duties, these are, in\nthe first instance, collective duties to provide the conditions in\nwhich the kinds of relationships that generate these duties can\nflourish. As the next section shows, there are many policies and\ninstitutions that, individually or together, can achieve this\ngoal.\n",
