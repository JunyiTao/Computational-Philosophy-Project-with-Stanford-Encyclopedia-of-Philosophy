    "main_text": "Mathematics and Hypothetical Necessity\n11. Mathematics and Hypothetical Necessity\n\n\nIt is often supposed, for Aristotle, mathematical explanation plays no\nrole in the study of nature, especially in biology. This conception is,\nmost of all, a product of anti-scholastics of the late Renaissance, who\nsought to draw the greatest chasm between their own mechanism and\nscholasticism. Mathematics plays a vital role in both. The principal\nway in which mathematics enters into biological explanation is through\nhypothetical necessity: \nIf X is to have feature Y (which is good\nfor X), then it is a feature of its matter that Z be\nthe case.\n\nZ may be a constraint determined by a mathematical fact.\nFor example, animals by nature do not have an odd number of feet. For\nif one had an odd number of feet, it would walk awkardly or the feet\nwould have to be of different lengths (De incessuanimalium 9).\nTo see this, imagine an isosceles triangle with a altitude drawn.\n",
