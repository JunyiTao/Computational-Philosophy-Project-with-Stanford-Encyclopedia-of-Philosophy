It is, moreover, an issue that theater studies\nand performance theory have focused a fair amount of attention upon.\nJonas Barish identified its roots in the dispute, referred to in the\nIntroduction to this entry, between Plato and Aristotle over the\nnotion of mimesis and the value of theatrical practices\nwithin the good city (Barish 1966, 1981). Two later periods of\nphilosophical reflection on human practices stand out as concerned\nnearly exclusively with the morality of theatrical practices\nthemselves: during the period of the early Latin Church fathers, and\nduring the eighteenth century (Tertullian and Jean Jacques Rousseau\nare good examples). The degree to which the distrust of theater in\nthese periods was grounded in the earlier differences between the ways\nPlato and Aristotle had understood mimesis is still much\ndebated (Puchner 2013). The interest in and estimations of the social\nand moral effects of theatrical practices, on which the alleged\n\u201cprejudice\u201d has been grounded, staged a resurgence in the\nliterary and artistic period known as Romanticism (Friedrich Nietzsche\nand John S. Mill are good examples). And this worry about, or even a\ndistrust of, theatricality has continued into the present, but\ninterestingly enough, now among theater practitioners and theorists\nthemselves (Schechner 1992, and both Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett\nprovide good examples, see also Puchner 2001).\n\nHowever, this viewpoint is often grounded in metaphysical and\nepistemic questions about what a theatrical performance is and how a\nspectator understands a theatrical performance of some kind (for\nexample, as a literary performance or one that is actual and\nphysical). This viewpoint is also often motivated by moral and social\nviews, not just about performances but also about performers. But it\nis often not clear what relationship this viewpoint has to the actual\npractices of the art form (Puchner 2013: 548). So even if the\nmotivations for the view can and should be criticized, the viewpoint\noften seems to be less \u201ca prejudice\u201d than a considered\njudgment resting on prior argued-for epistemic, metaphysical, or moral\npositions. And this leads one to wonder if there is anything special,\nor especially troubling, about the general social or moral problems\nassociated with theater in these periods at all. In short, it is\ndifficult to determine whether and when this animus is actually\naberrant\u2014and genuinely prejudicial\u2014or if it is of\na piece with standard examinations of social and moral effects of\ntheatrical practices. That said, it is worth noting that suspicion of\ntheatrical practices seems to be a persistently recurring and\ncharacteristic attitude within Western European philosophical, social,\nand political traditions.\n",
