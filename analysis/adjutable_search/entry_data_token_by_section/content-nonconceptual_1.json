    "main_text": "Nonconceptual content: An initial characterization\n2. Nonconceptual content: An initial characterization\n\nThe notion of nonconceptual content is fundamentally contrastive. In\nelucidating it we need to start with the notion of conceptual content.\nThe paradigm case of a state with conceptual content is a\npropositional attitude such as a belief or desire. Having a\npropositional attitude involves standing in a certain relation to a\ncontent (a thought or a proposition). The content is\nwhat it is that is believed, desired, hoped for etc. Although\npropositional attitudes are ultimately directed at certain objects,\nproperties and/or relations (which yield their\ntruth-condition, and in terms of which their\ntruth-value is to be determined), it is clear that only\ncertain ways of characterizing those objects/properties/relations can\nserve to specify the content of the relevant propositional attitude.\nIt would be incorrect, for example, to characterize the content of my\ncurrent belief that my car is parked in the driveway by using the\nconcepts of particle physics to describe the state of affairs that\nwould make it true. This would be incorrect because it completely\nfails to capture how I think about the state of affairs of my car\nbeing in the driveway. The obvious question to ask, once this\npreliminary point is in play, is \u2018What constraints are imposed\nupon specifications of the content of propositional attitudes by the\nrequirement to respect the way the subject thinks about the\ntruth-condition of the relevant attitude?\u2019\n\nDifferent theories of content will respond to this question in\ndifferent ways, but the following is widely held to impose a minimal\nconstraint upon any such response.\n\nThe conceptual constraint:\n\nSpecifications of the content of a sentence or propositional attitude\nshould only employ concepts possessed by the utterer or thinker.\n\n\nCertain theories of content and concepts directly entail the\nconceptual constraint. Within a broadly Fregean tradition, for\nexample, the contents of propositional attitudes (and the meanings of\nsentences) are taken to consist of concepts\u2014and it is hard to\nsee how one can have a propositional attitude whose content is a\ncomplex of concepts without possessing each of\n them.[1]\n\nBut the conceptual constraint does not depend upon adopting any\nparticular theory of content. Its plausibility stems, rather, from the\nconjunction of two thoughts.\n\nIn specifying what a thinker believes, what a perceiver perceives\nor what a speaker is saying by uttering a certain sentence in a\nparticular context one has to be as faithful as possible to how that\nthinker, perceiver or speaker apprehends the world.\nHow a thinker, perceiver or speaker apprehends the world in having\nbeliefs about it, perceiving it or speaking about it is a function of\nthe concepts he possesses.\n\n\nThis way of motivating the conceptual constraint has been explicitly\nput forward by several authors who argue forcibly for the second\nthesis (see, for example, Peacocke 1983, McDowell 1994a, Brewer 1999,\nand No\u00eb 1999). Theorists of nonconceptual content, in contrast,\naccept the first constraint without the second. They hold that\nspecifications of content must respect the way a thinker, perceiver or\nspeaker apprehends the world and because of this they cannot\nbe circumscribed by the concepts possessed by the thinker, perceiver\nor speaker. Theorists of nonconceptual content postulate the existence\nof ways of representing the world (and hence the existence of a type\nof content) that outstrip the concepts possessed by the thinker.\n\nThe conceptual constraint can be lifted in two different ways. It can\nbe lifted globally by simply denying that any content specifications\nneed confine themselves to the concepts possessed by the\nutterer/thinker. The currently popular identification of propositions\nwith functions from possible worlds to truth values involves a\nglobal lifting of the conceptual constraint. Possible world\nsemantics is intended to apply to all propositional attitudes and it\nis obvious that few believers who are not also professional\nphilosophers will have any grip at all on the central theoretical\nconcepts of possible worlds semantics. All content comes out as\nnonconceptual content in this sense (Stalnaker\n 1998).[2]\n In terms of the two motivations identified earlier for the conceptual\nconstraint, this approach to specifying content appears to repudiate\nthe first. It holds that specifications of content need not be\nsensitive to how the speaker or thinker apprehends the world, at least\nif one thinks that such sensitivity requires a degree of aspectuality\nthat possible worlds semantics explicitly\n rejects.[3]\n\nIt is more interesting to think about what might happen if we retain\nthe first motivation, but question the second, looking for ways in\nwhich thinkers/perceivers/speakers represent the world that are not a\nfunction of the concepts they possess. There are three different\nrepresentational domains for which such a local lifting of\nthe conceptual constraint may be plausible:\n\nPerceptual states (see further\n 4.1\n below)\nRepresentational states at the subpersonal or subdoxastic level\n(see further\n 4.2\n below)\nRepresentational states of non-human animals and human infants who\ndo not seem to be concept possessors (see further\n 4.3\n below)\n\n\nOf course, the plausibility of a local lifting of the conceptual\nconstraint will be a function of how concepts are understood. In the\nfollowing we make two assumptions about concepts. These assumptions do\nnot fix a single notion of concept, but they do however determine the\nlogical space within which accounts can be developed of the\ncorrelative notions of conceptual and nonconceptual content.\n\nThe first assumption is that concepts are semantic entities rather\nthan psychological entities. Concepts are constituents of contents.\nAttitudes towards contents are psychological occurrences, but the\ncontents themselves are not psychological entities. They, and the\nconcepts they contain, are abstract\n entities.[4]\n The second assumption is that, although concepts are abstract\nentities, mastering a concept is a psychological achievement. We need\na cognitive account of what it is to master a concept, even though\nconcepts are not psychological entities.\n",
