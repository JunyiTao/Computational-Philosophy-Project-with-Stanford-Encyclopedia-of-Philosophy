    "main_text": "Medical Theories || Disease\n6.2 Disease\n\nThe Anonymus Londinensis then tells us that Philolaus\nexplained disease in terms of three factors: bile, blood and phlegm.\nIt is surprising that no mention is made of the basic constituent of\nthe body, the hot, since Philolaus is presented as one of the thinkers\nwho explains disease in terms of the constituents of the body (see 6.1\nabove). It may well be, however, that bile, blood and phlegm were all\nregarded as hot, since blood and bile were typically regarded as hot,\nand we are explicitly told that Philolaus argued that phlegm was hot,\nalthough it was typically regarded as cold (Lloyd 1963, 120).\nMoreover, excesses and deficiencies of heat, cold and nutriment are\nalso said to be causes of disease. It would appear then that health\ndepends on appropriate cooling of the natural heat of the body and\nthat bile, blood and phlegm cause disease insofar as they are not\nconstituted properly by the balance of heating and cooling, the\nbalance of which can also be upset by improper nutrition. There are a number of puzzling features in\nPhilolaus\u2019 presentation of the three humours: blood, bile and phlegm\n(Gourevitch 1989, Manetti 1990). Phlegm is said to be constituted from\nombroi, which usually means \u201crain storms,\u201d but\nprobably here means just liquids (Manetti 1990). However, Manetti\u2019s\nsuggestion (1990) that phlegm does not refer to the humour but rather\nmeans \u201cinflammation\u201d is not very likely, since phlegm is\nnot said to be caused by the liquids, which is what we would expect if\nit meant \u201cinflammation\u201d but rather constituted of them.\nPhilolaus\u2019 account of disease may be distorted by the intervention of\nthe author of the Anonymus Londinensis (Manetti 1990). \n",
