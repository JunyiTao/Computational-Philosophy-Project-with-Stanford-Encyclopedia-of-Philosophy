    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Propositions Versus Sentences\n4.2 Propositions Versus Sentences\n\nWe noted earlier that deflationism can be presented in either a\nsententialist version or a propositionalist version. Some philosophers\nhave suggested, however, that the choice between these two versions\nconstitutes a dilemma for deflationism (Jackson, Oppy, and Smith\n1994). The objection is that if deflationism is construed in\naccordance with propositionalism, then it is trivial, but if it is\nconstrued in accordance with sententialism, it is false. To illustrate\nthe dilemma, consider the following claim:\n\n(12)\nSnow is white is true if and only if snow is white.\n\n\nNow, does \u2018snow is white\u2019 in (12) refer to a\nsentence or a proposition? If, on the one hand, we take (12) to be\nabout a sentence, then, assuming (12) can be interpreted as making a\nnecessary claim, it is false. On the face of it, after all, it takes a\nlot more than snow\u2019s being white for it to be the case that\n\u2018snow is white\u2019 is true. In order for \u2018snow is\nwhite\u2019 to be true, it must be the case not only that snow is\nwhite, it must, in addition, be the case that \u2018snow is\nwhite\u2019 means that snow is white. But this is a fact\nabout language that (12) ignores. On the other hand, suppose we take\n\u2018snow is white\u2019 in (12) to denote the proposition\nthat snow is white. Then the approach looks to be trivial, since the\nproposition that snow is white is defined as being the one that is\ntrue just in case snow is white. Thus, deflationism faces the dilemma\nof being false or trivial.\n\nOne response for the deflationist is to remain with the\npropositionalist version of their doctrine and accept its triviality.\nA trivial doctrine, after all, at least has the advantage of being\ntrue.\n\nA second response is to resist the suggestion that propositionist\ndeflationism is trivial. For one thing, the triviality here does not\nhave its source in the concept of truth, but rather in the concept of\na proposition. Moreover, even if we agree that the proposition that\nsnow is white is defined as the one that is true if and only if snow\nis white, this still leaves open whether truth is a substantive\nproperty of that proposition; as such it leaves open whether\ndeflationism or inflationism is correct.\n\nA third response to this dilemma is to accept that deflationism\napplies inter alia to sentences, but to argue (following\nField 1994a) that the sentences to which it applies must be\ninterpreted sentences, i.e., sentences which already have\nmeaning attached to them. While it takes more than snow being white to\nmake the sentence \u2018snow is white\u2019 true, when we think of\nit as divorced from its meaning, that is not so clear when we treat it\nas having the meaning it in fact has.\n",
