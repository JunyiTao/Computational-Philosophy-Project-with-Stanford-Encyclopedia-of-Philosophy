    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Trust\n2. The Epistemology of Trust\n\nWritings on this topic obviously bear on the issue of when trust is\nwarranted (i.e., justified). The central epistemological question\nabout trust is, \u201cOught I to trust or not?\u201d That is, given\nthe way things seem to me, is it reasonable for me to trust? People\ntend to ask this sort of question only in situations where they\ncan\u2019t take trustworthiness for granted\u2014that is, where they\nare conscious of the fact that trusting could get them into trouble.\nExamples are situations similar to those in which they have been\nbetrayed in the past or unlike any they have ever been in before. The\nquestion, \u201cOught I to trust?\u201d is therefore particularly\npertinent to a somewhat odd mix of people that includes victims of\nabuse or the like, as well as immigrants and travelers.\n\nThe question \u201cOught I to distrust?\u201d has received\ncomparatively little attention in philosophy despite it arguably being\nas important as the question of when to trust. People can get into\nserious trouble by distrusting when they ought not to, rather than\njust by trusting when they ought not to. The harms of misplaced\ndistrust are both moral and epistemic and include dishonoring people,\nbeing out of harmony with them, and being deprived of knowledge via\ntestimony (D\u2019Cruz 2019; M. Fricker 2007). Presumably because\nthey believe that the harms of misplaced trust are greater\n(D\u2019Cruz 2019), philosophers\u2014and consequently I, in this\nentry\u2014focus more on the rationality of trusting, as opposed to\ndistrusting.\n\nPhilosophical work that is relevant to the issue of how to trust well\nappears either under the general heading of the epistemology or\nrationality of trust (e.g., Baker 1987; Webb 1992; Wanderer and\nTownsend 2013) or under the specific heading of testimony\u2014that\nis, of putting one\u2019s trust in the testimony of others. This\nsection focuses on the epistemology of trust generally rather than on\ntrust in testimony specifically. There is a large literature on\ntestimony (see the entry in this encyclopedia) and on the related\ntopic of epistemic injustice, both of which I discuss only insofar as\nthey overlap with the epistemology of trust.\n\nPhilosophers sometimes ask whether it could ever be rational to trust\nother people. This question arises for two reasons. First, it appears\nthat trust and rational reflection (e.g., on whether one should be\ntrusting) are in tension with one another. Since trust inherently\ninvolves risk, any attempt to eliminate that risk through rational\nreflection could eliminate one\u2019s trust by turning one\u2019s\nstance into mere reliance. Second, trust tends to give us blinkered\nvision: it makes us resistant to evidence that may contradict our\noptimism about the trustee (Baker 1987; Jones 1996 and 2019). For\nexample, if I trust my brother not to harm anyone, I will resist the\ntruth of any evidence to the contrary. Here, trust and rationality\nseem to come apart.\n\nEven if some of our trust could be rational, one might insist that not\nall of it could be rational for various reasons. First, if Baier is\nright that trust is ubiquitous (1986: 234), then we could not possibly\nsubject all of it to rational reflection. We certainly could not\nreflect on every bit of knowledge we\u2019ve acquired through the\ntestimony of others, such as that the earth is round or Antarctica\nexists (Webb 1993; E. Fricker 1995; Coady 1992). Second, bioethicists\npoint out that some trust is unavoidable and occurs in the absence of\nrational reflection (e.g., trust in emergency room nurses and\nphysicians; see Zaner 1991). Lastly, some trust\u2014namely the\ntherapeutic variety\u2014purposefully leaps beyond any evidence of\ntrustworthiness in an effort to engender trustworthiness in the\ntrustee. Is this sort of trust rational? Perhaps not, given that there\nisn\u2019t sufficient evidence for it.\n\nMany philosophers respond to the skepticism about the rationality of\ntrust by saying that rationality, when applied to trust, needs to be\nunderstood differently than it is in each of the skeptical points\nabove. There, \u201crationality\u201d means something like this: it\nis rational to believe in something only if one has verified that it\nwill happen or done as much as possible to verify it. For example, it\nis rational for me to believe that my brother has not harmed anyone\nonly if the evidence points in that direction and I have discovered\nthat to be the case. As we\u2019ve seen, problems exist with applying\nthis view of rationality to trust, yet it is not the only option; this\nview is both \u201ctruth-directed\u201d and\n\u201cinternalist\u201d, while the rationality of trust could\ninstead be \u201cend-directed\u201d or \u201cexternalist\u201d. Or\nit could be internalist without requiring that we have done the\nevidence gathering just discussed. Let me expand on these\npossibilities, starting with those that concern truth- or end-directed\nrationality.\n",
