    "main_text": "Thomas Aquinas\n5. Thomas Aquinas\n\n\nThomas Aquinas is often thought of as the figure most responsible for\nputting an end to the theory of divine illumination. Although there is\nsome truth to this view, as we will see, it seems more accurate to\nregard Aquinas as one of the last defenders of the theory, as a\nproponent of innate Aristotelian illumination. \n\n\nA vivid example of the way Aquinas moves from an Augustinian to an\nAristotelian framework occurs in his Treatise on Human Nature\n(Summa theologiae 1a 75\u201389), where he considers the\nAugustinian claim that \u201cpure truth should not be looked for from the\nsenses of the body\u201d (84.6 obj. 1). In reply, Aquinas invokes the\nAristotelian agent intellect:\nFrom those words of Augustine we are given to understand\nthat truth is not entirely to be looked for from the senses.\nFor we require the light of agent intellect, through which we\nunchangeably cognize the truth in changeable things, and we distinguish\nthe things themselves from the likenesses of things (ad\n1).\n\n\nIt is not at all clear, here or elsewhere, how the agent intellect\ncarries out the two tasks he describes. (If Aquinas had given us a\nsatisfactory account of this, he would have thereby solved two of the leading\nproblems of epistemology.) But for present purposes it is enough to\nnotice how Aquinas seems to replace Augustinian illumination with the\nAristotelian agent intellect. Thus the traditional verdict has been\nthat Aquinas replaced Augustine with Aristotle, and exchanged\nillumination for abstraction. \n\n\nThere is more to the story. In the immediately preceding article,\nAquinas explicitly discusses Augustinian divine illumination, and\nreaches the affirmative conclusion that \u201cthe intellective soul does\ncognize all true things in the eternal reasons\u201d (84.5sc). Often this\naffirmative conclusion gets treated as little more than lip service to\nthe authority of Augustine, and the article as a whole gets taken as a\nbackhanded repudiation of illumination theory: affirming the theory in\nform but denying it in substance. This is a misreading. Aquinas sees\nsomething important in Augustine\u2019s theory, something worth\npreserving.\n\n\nAquinas does reject certain conceptions of divine illumination. He\ndenies that human beings in this life have the divine ideas as an\nobject of cognition. And he denies that divine illumination is\nsufficient on its own, without the senses. Neither of these claims was\ncontroversial. What Aquinas further denies, and what was controversial,\nwas the claim that there is a special ongoing divine influence,\nconstantly required for the intellect\u2019s operation. Aquinas instead\nargues that human beings possess a sufficient capacity for thought on\ntheir own, without the need for any \u201cnew illumination added onto their\nnatural illumination\u201d (Summa theol. 1a2ae 109.1c). From one\nperspective this makes for an important difference between Aquinas and\nhis Franciscan contemporaries. But from another perspective the\ndifference seems slight, because Aquinas is by no means removing God\nfrom the picture. Here is how he expresses his endorsement of\nillumination theory:\nIt is necessary to say that the human soul cognizes all\nthings in the eternal reasons, through participating in which we\ncognize all things. For the intellectual light that is in us is nothing\nother than a certain likeness of the uncreated light, obtained through\nparticipation, in which the eternal reasons are contained. Thus it is\nsaid in Psalm 4, Many say, Who shows us good things? To this\nquestion the Psalmist replies, saying The light of your face, Lord,\nis imprinted upon us. This is as if to say, through that seal of\nthe divine light on us, all things are shown to us (Summa\ntheol. 1a 84.5c).\n\n\nThere is some temptation to take all of this simply as an expression of\nAquinas\u2019s more general view that God is the first cause of all things.\nHe writes, for instance, \nAll active created powers operate in virtue of\nbeing directed and moved by the Creator. So it is, then, that in all\ncognition of the truth, the human mind needs the divine operation. But\nin the case of things cognized naturally it does not need any new\nlight, but only divine movement and direction (In de trinitate\npro. 1.1c).\n\n\nHere there seems to be nothing special about the intellect\u2019s need for\nillumination. The intellect, like all of nature, needs God as its first\nmover. If you like, think of this as divine illumination. But viewed\nunder this aspect, it is no wonder the theory was controversial. While\nhis Franciscan contemporaries were insisting on a special role for God\nin human cognition, Aquinas seems to move as far in the opposite\ndirection as his theism would permit. \n\n\nBut passages of this last kind are misleading, because Aquinas does\nsee something especially mysterious about human cognition, and he\nappeals to God as a way of solving this mystery. The agent intellect,\non Aquinas\u2019s view, accounts for our capacity to grasp self-evident\ntruths. We have an immediate and direct grasp of the truth of first\nprinciples, such as the principle of noncontradiction (see, e.g.,\nSumma contra Gentiles II.83.1678). We do not infer the truth\nof this principle, we do not discover that it is true through any kind\nof induction. Instead we simply see its truth, as soon as we are\nconfronted with an instance where it applies. This is not innate\nknowledge; we are not born knowing these principles. What we are born\nwith is the capacity to recognize their truth as soon as we are\nconfronted with instances of them. These first natural conceptions are\n\u201cthe seeds of all the things that are subsequently cognized\u201d (De\nveritate 11.1 ad 5). In this sense, Aquinas is even willing to\nspeak of the soul\u2019s having a prior knowledge of everything that it\nknows:\nThe soul forms in itself likenesses of things inasmuch as,\nthrough the light of agent intellect, forms abstracted from sensible\nobjects are made actually intelligible, so as to be received in the\npossible intellect. And so, in a way, all knowledge is imparted to\nus at the start, in the light of agent intellect, mediated by the\nuniversal concepts that are cognized at once by the light of agent\nintellect. Through these concepts, as through universal principles, we\nmake judgments about other things, and in these universal concepts we\nhave a prior cognition of those others. In this connection there is\ntruth in the view that the things we learn, we already had knowledge of\n(De veritate 10.6c).\n\n\nBecause all of what we know can be traced back to these fundamental\nprinciples, there is a sense in which everything we learn, we already\nknew. An innate grasp of certain basic truths, recognized by the light\nof agent intellect, plays a crucial, foundational role.\n\n\nThe light of agent intellect is of course given to us from God \u2014 \u201ca\ncertain likeness of the uncreated light, obtained through\nparticipation\u201d (1a 84.5c). Without appealing to God, Aquinas sees no\nway of explaining how we recognize the truth of first principles.\nNeither deductive nor inductive reasoning can account for the way in\nwhich we immediately see that such principles are true. This\ninsight, then, is simply something we are given:\nThe light of this kind of reason, by which principles of\nthis kind are known to us, is imparted to us from God. It is like a\nlikeness of the uncreated truth reflecting in us. So, since no human\nteaching can be effective except in virtue of that light, it is clear\nthat it is God alone who internally and principally teaches us (De\nveritate 11.1c).\n\n\nThe light of agent intellect, a likeness of the divine ideas, is the\nessential starting point for all knowledge. \n\n\nAquinas agrees with his Franciscan contemporaries that intellective\ncognition is incomplete without some sort of supernaturally infused\ninsight. The only difference is that Aquinas wants that insight to be\ngiven all at once, from the start \u2014 bottled up within agent intellect,\nas we might think of it. His opponents, in contrast, think of\nillumination as an ongoing process, as necessary as the air we breathe.\nIt is easy to see how, at the time, this difference might have seemed\nimportant. But from our present perspective the differences seem rather\nslight: they seem to be arguing simply over the means of transmission.\nAquinas conceives of illumination as a deep well within us, whereas the\nFranciscans conceived of it as raining down in drops.
