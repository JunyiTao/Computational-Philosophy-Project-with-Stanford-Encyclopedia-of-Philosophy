    "main_text": "Responses to the Paradox || The Epistemic Theory\n3.2 The Epistemic Theory\n\nMost theorists of vagueness conceive of vagueness as a semantic\nphenomenon, as somehow rooted in the meanings of words like\n\u2018tall\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019. As we shall see, semantic\ntheories typically introduce special nonclassical logics and/or\nsemantics in order to resolve the paradox (and accommodate the\nphenomenon of borderline cases). In contrast, epistemicists think that\nvagueness is just a form of ignorance: vague terms have sharp\nboundaries whose locations are hidden from us. In fact, heaps are\nsharply divided from non-heaps, and tall heights are sharply divided\nfrom average ones, but we cannot discover where those divisions lie\n(e.g., Sorensen 1988, 2001; Williamson 1994a,b, 2000; Graff 2000, Fara 2008;\nRescher 2009). On this view, the sorites paradox is dispatched\nimmediately: the major premise, or one of the conditional premises, is\nsimply false. And bivalence is preserved: any application of a vague\nterm either is true or is false, though we cannot always know\nwhich.\n\nWhat facts about the world or natural language or competent speakers\ncould serve to fix sharp boundaries for vague words? According to\nWilliamson (e.g., 1994b: 184), meaning supervenes on use; in other\nwords, the locations of the sharp boundaries of a vague term are a\nfunction of speakers\u2019 dispositions to use it as they do.\n(Insofar as the use of a vague term varies across time, its boundaries\nmay be unstable.) Of course, we cannot know the totality of those\ndispositions, and we do not know the relevant function; and our\nignorance of these factors blocks one path to knowledge of the\nlocations of the term\u2019s boundaries. \n\nAnother possible route to knowledge of the boundary locations is\nblocked by the fact that our knowledge of the application of a vague\nterm is inexact. Inexact knowledge is governed by margin\nfor error principles, viz., principles of the form\n\u2018If x and y differ incrementally on a decisive\ndimension and x is known to be \\(\\Phi\\) (old, blue, etc.), then\ny is\n \\(\\Phi\\)\u2019.[2]\n For example, where knowledge is inexact, we can know of a blue object\nthat it is blue only if objects whose colors are incrementally\ndifferent are blue as well\u2014hence, only in clear cases. In\ncontrast, in the borderline or \u201cpenumbral\u201d region of a\nsorites series for \u2018blue\u2019, where the boundary lives, some\nshade of blue is only incrementally different from, indeed may look\nthe same as, a shade that is not blue; and we cannot know where this\ndifference lies. Consequently, if we classify the former shade as\nblue, that classification is correct by luck, and so does not\nconstitute knowledge. (On the plausible assumption that seeing\nthat something x is blue is sufficient for knowing that x is\nblue, it follows that some blue things are such that we cannot\nsee that they are blue, even under ideal viewing\nconditions.)\n\nThe virtues and the appeal of the epistemic theory are significant,\nand it has earned its share of supporters. At the same time, the view\nmay be hard to accept. Even its proponents grant that epistemicism is\nintuitively implausible; and it seems to multiply mysteries. As a\nfirst approximation, the epistemicist says that\n\n\nvague terms have unknowable sharp boundaries that are fixed by an\nunknown function of their unknowable (i.e., not fully knowable)\npatterns of use. \n\n\nHowever, it seems that the function too must be unknowable, not just\nunknown; for how could we recognize it if we came across it? How could\nwe tell whether we\u2019d gotten hold of the right function but by\ndetermining whether it yields the correct boundaries as its values? If\nthat\u2019s right, then the epistemicist\u2019s thesis must actually\nbe that\n\n\nvague terms have unknowable sharp boundaries that are fixed by an\nunknowable function of their unknowable patterns of use.\n\n\n(Raffman 2014: 10) To be sure, explanations are provided for our\nirremediable ignorance in these cases: for example, we can\u2019t\nknow where the sharp boundaries lie because our knowledge is inexact,\nand we can\u2019t know the total pattern of the term\u2019s use\nbecause \u201cthe data are infinite\u201d (Williamson 1994b:\n184\u2013185), and so on. Nevertheless, epistemicism may have the\nfeel of a \u201cjust so\u201d\n story.[3]\n (See \u00a75.1 for further discussion of Williamson.)\n\nGraff Fara defends a different strain of epistemicism (Graff 2000, Fara 2008). \u00c5kerman\nand Greenough (2010) observe that her account\n\n\nis a form of epistemicism in that vague predicates draw sharp,\nbivalent,\n boundaries.[4]\n Unlike the epistemicism of Sorensen (1988) and Williamson (1994a,b),\nhowever, it is constitutive of vagueness that the boundary can shift\nas a function of changes in [speakers\u2019\n interests].[5]\n (2010: 277)\n\n\nSuch a sharp boundary is unknowable because (among other things) it is\nconstantly moving around in a sorites series, changing location with\nthe speaker\u2019s interests in such a way that he never encounters it\n(Fara 2008: 328). As Stanley puts it, \n\n\nwhen we look for [a] boundary of the extension of [a vague term] in\nits penumbra, our very looking has the effect of changing the\n[extension] of the vague expression so that the boundary is not where\nwe are looking. (2003: 269) \n\n\nThus we can never discover where the boundary lies, and each\nconditional premise seems true so long as we are considering it. (The\nrole of interest-relativity in Graff Fara\u2019s account is discussed\nfurther in\n \u00a73.3.4.)\n \n\nRetention of classical logic and bivalence is supposed to be a chief\nadvantage of the epistemic approach over other views (e.g., Williamson\n1992: 162). Indeed, because bivalence is widely supposed to entail\nsharp boundaries, many theorists of vagueness believe that, for all\nintents and purposes, epistemicism is the only theory that can employ\na bivalent semantics (e.g., Rosenkranz 2003, Keefe\n 2000).[6]\n In particular, they believe that no semantic theory of vagueness can\nbe classical. Subsequent developments cast doubt on this view, however;\nsee\n \u00a73.3.5.\n \n",
