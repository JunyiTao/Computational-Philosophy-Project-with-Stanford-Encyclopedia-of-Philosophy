    "main_text": "Respect for Persons || Some important issues\n2.1 Some important issues\n\nIt is controversial, however, whether we do indeed have a moral\nobligation to respect all persons regardless of merit, and if so, why.\nThere are disagreements, for example, about the scope of the claim,\nthe grounds of respect, and the justification for the obligation.\nThere is also a divergence of views about the kinds of treatment that\nare respectful of persons.\n\nOne source of controversy concerns the scope of the concept of a\nperson. Although in everyday discourse the word \u201cperson\u201d\nis synonymous with \u201chuman being,\u201d some philosophical\ndiscussions treat it as a technical term whose range of application\nmight not be coextensive with the class of human beings (just as, for\nlegal purposes, business corporations are regarded as persons). This\nis because some of the reasons that have been given for respecting\npersons entail both that some non-human things warrant the same\nrespect on the very same grounds as humans and that not all humans do.\nConsequently, one question an account of respect for persons has to\naddress is: Who or what are persons that are owed respect? Different\nanswers have been offered, including all human beings; all and only\nthose humans who are themselves capable of respecting persons; all\nbeings capable of rational activity, or of sympathy and empathy, or of\nvaluing, whether human or not; all beings capable of functioning as\nmoral agents, whether human or not; all beings capable of\nparticipating in certain kinds of social relations, whether human or\nnot. The second, third, and fourth answers would seem to exclude\ndeceased humans and humans who lack sufficient mental capacity, such\nas the profoundly mentally disabled, the severely mentally ill and\nsenile, those in persistent vegetative states, the pre-born, and\nperhaps very young children. The third, fourth, and fifth answers\nmight include humans with diminished capacities, artificial beings\n(androids, sophisticated robots), spiritual beings (gods, angels),\nextraterrestrial beings, and certain animals (apes, dolphins).\n\nIn trying to clarify who or what we are obligated to respect, we are\nnaturally led to a question about the ground or basis of respect: What\nis it about persons that makes them matter morally in such a way as to\nmake them worthy of respect? One common way of answer this question is\nto look for some morally valuable natural qualities or capacities that\nare common to all beings that are noncontroversially owed respect (for\nexample, all normal adult humans). Even regarding humans, there is a\nquestion of scope: Are all humans owed respect? If respect is\nsomething to which all human beings have an equal claim, then, it has\nbeen argued, the basis has to be something that all humans possess\nequally or in virtue of which humans are naturally equal, or a\nthreshold quality that all humans possess, with variations above the\nthreshold ignored. Some philosophers have argued that certain\ncapacities fit the bill; others argue that there is no quality\nactually possessed by all humans that could be a plausible ground for\na moral obligation of equal respect. Some draw from this the\nconclusion that respect is owed not to all but only to some human\nbeings, for example, only morally good persons (Dean 2014). Another\nview is that the search for valuable qualities possessed by all humans\nthat could ground universally owed moral recognition respect gets\nthings backwards: rather than being grounded in some fact about\nhumans, respect confers moral standing and worth on them (Sensen 2017;\nBird forthcoming). But the last view still leaves the questions: why\nshould this morally powerful standing and worth be conferred on\nhumans? And is it conferred on all humans? Yet another question of\nscope is: Must persons always be respected? One view is that\nindividuals forfeit their claim to respect by, for example, committing\nheinous crimes of disrespect against other persons, such as murder in\nthe course of terrorism or genocide. Another view is that there are no\ncircumstances under which it is morally justifiable to not respect a\nperson, and that even torturers and child-rapists, though they may\ndeserve the most severe condemnation and punishment and may have\nforfeited their rights to freedom and perhaps to life, still remain\npersons to whom we have obligations of respect, since the grounds of\nrespect are independent of moral merit or demerit (Hill 2000b).\n\nThere is a further question of justification to be addressed, for it\nis one thing to say that persons have a certain valuable quality, but\nquite another thing to say that there is a moral obligation to respect\npersons (Hill 1997). So, we must ask: What reasons do we have for\nbelieving that the fact that persons possess quality X entails that we\nare morally obligated to respect persons by, for example, treating\nthem in certain ways? Another way of asking a justification question\nseeks not a normative connection between qualities of persons and\nmoral obligation, but an explanation for our belief that humans (and\nperhaps other beings) are owed respect, for example: What in our\nexperience of other humans or in our evolutionary history explains the\ndevelopment and power of this belief? On some accounts, our actual\nfelt experiences of reverential respect play a significant role (Buss\n1999b). In other accounts, what justifies accepting our experience of\nrespect for humans (or other beings) as grounds for an obligation is\nits coherence with our other moral beliefs (Hill 2000b; Margalit 1996;\nGibbard 1990).\n\nOther questions concern what respecting persons requires of us. Some\nphilosophers argue that the obligation to respect person functions as\na negative constraint: respect involves refraining from regarding or\ntreating persons in certain ways. For example, we ought not to treat\nthem as if they were worthless or had value only insofar as we find\nthem useful or interesting, or as if they were mere objects or\nspecimens, or as if they were vermin or dirt; we ought not to violate\ntheir basic moral rights, or interfere with their efforts to make\ntheir own decisions and govern their own conduct, or humiliate them,\nor treat them in ways that flout their nature and worth as persons.\nOther theorists maintain that we also have positive duties of respect:\nwe ought, for example, to try to see each of them and the world from\ntheir own points of view, or help them to promote their morally\nacceptable ends, or protect them from their own self-harming\ndecisions. And some philosophers note that it may be more respectful\nto judge someone\u2019s actions or character negatively or to punish\nsomeone for wrongdoing than to treat them as if they were not\nresponsible for what they did, although requirements of respect would\nimpose limits on how such judgments may be expressed and how persons\nmay be punished. Another question concerns equality of respect. While\nmost theorists agree that moral recognition respect is owed equally to\nall persons and that it requires treating persons as equals (as all\nhaving the same basic moral worth and status), there is disagreement\nabout whether respect requires that persons be treated equally\n(whatever is done or not done for or to one person must be done or not\ndone for or to everyone). One view is that equal treatment would fail\nto respect important differences between individuals (Frankfurt\n1999). Perhaps, however, as regards respect as a negative\nconstraint, it is appropriate to treat all persons the same: no one\nshould be treated like worthless garbage (just as no U.S. citizen\nshould be compelled to incriminate themselves), while as regards\nrespect as a positive duty, it may be more respectful of each person\nto treat individuals with different needs, aims, and circumstances\ndifferently (as a loving parent might allow her older children but not\nthe younger ones to have social media accounts).\n",
