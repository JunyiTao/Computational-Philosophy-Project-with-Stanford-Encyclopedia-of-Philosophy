    "main_text": "\n\n\nFirst-order model theory, also known as classical model theory, is a\nbranch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between\ndescriptions in first-order languages and the structures that satisfy\nthese descriptions. From one point of view, this is a vibrant area of\nmathematical research that brings logical methods (in particular the\ntheory of definition) to bear on deep problems of classical\nmathematics. From another point of view, first-order model theory is\nthe paradigm for the rest of\n model theory;\n it is the area in which many of the broader ideas of model\ntheory were first worked out. \n\n",
