    "main_text": "Natural Kind Status\n7. Natural Kind Status\n\nPhilosophers of science have explored whether all or some mental\nillnesses might be classified as natural kinds, the claim made about\nparticular diagnostic categories or symptom clusters (depression,\nschizophrenic disorder, and autism, for example), as well as about\nseparate symptoms (Cooper 2007; Samuels 2009; Tsou 2021). With\nrecognition that even the category of biological species would not\nmeet an essentialist criterion for natural kind status, a\n\u201chomeostatic property cluster\u201d account of natural kinds\nhas been proposed (Ellis 2001; Cooper 2007; Murphy 2012; Samuels\n2009). (See entry on Species.) A natural kind must be able to ground\nexplanations and inductive inferences, and enable effective human\nintervention. Linked by shared causal properties such as genes, on\nthis view, their homeostatic aspect ensures that property clusters\nmaking up separate disorders (or symptoms) will remain stable enough\nto behave the same way in response to the same conditions, due to a\nsimilarity-generating mechanism explaining their co-occurrence. (See\nessays in Kincaid and Sullivan 2014.)\n\nPsychological categories may resemble biological species in some\nrespects. But differences here have often been seen as profound, as\nthree examples will demonstrate. (i) Some have taken psychological\ncategories to represent a different order of being, as we saw in\n Section 5,\n with its own distinctive forms of causal explanations (Jaspers 1913\n[1963]; Bolton 2008; Wiggins & Schwartz 2011; Kusters 2016). (ii)\nOthers point out that psychological categories can alter, and\neventually even be altered by, the persons they classify, forming\n\u201cinteractive\u201d kinds through such looping effects. Indeed,\nmental disorders have been denied the status of natural kinds because\ninstability in their properties results when they have been classified\nand labeled (Hacking 1995). And (iii), some have tried to show that\nthe relation between mental illnesses and biological kinds differs\naccording to the role played by values in establishing the taxa of\nmental illness (Wakefield 1992; this claim is discussed in\n \u00a78).\n None of these differences has gone un-criticized. A thoroughgoing\nmind to brain reductionism would reject (i). About (ii), it has been\npointed out that the classification of biological species is also\nsubject to the instability wrought by looping effects (Khalidi 2010).\nAnd similarly, it has been argued in response to (iii) both that\nvalues also enter into the classification of biological species, and\nthat once we reach the categories of interest in this analysis,\nnon-evaluative traits form the observable taxa of such species (Cooper\n2007).\n\nAlthough the diverse ends to which disorder taxonomies can be put\nargue against finding a single answer about the kind status of mental\ndisorders, focus on the purposes served by disorder language and\ncategories has proven fruitful, here. (i) Mental disorders have been\nassigned to a category of \u201cpractical kinds\u201d, where\nmembership in this class depends on some external criterion that is\npragmatically relevant in the clinical context, such as a certain\ndegree of functional impairment, and remains unrelated to the\nunderlying structure of the kind (Zachar 2014). Moreover, they may be\nfurther classified according to their status as dimensional, discrete,\nand fuzzy kinds, and there is little reason to suppose that each and\nall conform to any one of these (Haslam 2002, 2014). (ii) Whether or\nnot they exhibit the stability required of classifications into true\nnatural kinds, these disorders do possess the properties relevant, and\nsufficiently stable, to guide clinical treatment, \u015eerife Tekin\nillustrates, using the lack of illness awareness\n(\u201cinsight\u201d) common in patients with some diagnoses (Tekin\n2016).\n",
