    "main_text": "A Neoplatonism of His Own\n4. Contribution to Political Ideas\n\nNicholas of Cusa has attracted frequent notice in the history of\npolitical ideas because of his early work, The Catholic\nConcordance/De Concordantia Catholica (1433\u201334). This\nlengthy work in three books is aimed first of all at an ecclesiatical\naudience at the Council of Basel and only secondarily, in Book 3, at\nthe Holy Roman Empire and its electors of the emperor. Nicholas\u2019\nideas stand squarely in the conciliarist tradition following proposals\nfrom the Council of Constance (1414\u201318), and thus privilege the\ncouncil\u2019s authority above the pope\u2019s. In Book 1 he\nexpounds a hierarchical view of creation and of the church, following\nDionysius the Areopagite. Then he uses both canon law and historical\ndocuments from and about the early church councils to undergird his\nview of council and papacy. Yet he never denies the importance of the\npositions of pope and emperor. Throughout Nicholas works to harmonize\n(=concordantia) the many different strands in church law and\npolitical theory.\n\nOver the last century scholars of political history have singled out\nchapters, particularly in Book 2, where Nicholas discusses consent as\na prerequisite for legitimate law and government. Going beyond\ntradition and canon law, he argues on the basis of people\u2019s\nnatural freedom (\u201cmen are by nature equal in power and equally\nfree\u201d) that all governance comes from the consent of the\nsubjects. This argument to explicitly institutionalize consent is\nNicholas\u2019 original contribution. He follows it with proposals on\nrepresentation that move from representation as virtual impersonation\nto representation as delegation based on those represented selecting\ntheir representatives. This is one of the first explicit statements in\nthe West of the institutional limits to be placed on rulers and of the\nidea that people must consent to their representative\ninstitutions.\n\nEven after he changed allegiance to the side of papal supremacy,\nNicholas used his ideas to argue in later brief writings that Basel\nwas not truly representative and that consent was embodied in the\ncollege of cardinals. In the following centuries, secular parliaments\nreturned to ideas of consent and representation (though not directly\nto Nicholas\u2019 book) in attempting to restrict the power of\nmonarchs. In the church itself, tradition continued to outweigh\ninnovation, and the idea of conciliar superiority to the pope seemed\ndead for centuries. Some twentieth-century thinking in the Roman\nCatholic Church has returned to and enlivened ideas about council and\npapacy propounded by Nicholas of Cusa.\n",
