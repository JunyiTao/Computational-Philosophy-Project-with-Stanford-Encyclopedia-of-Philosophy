Duhem himself,\njustly, traced it back to his contemporary Henri Poincar\u00e9. He\nnoted with approval that Poincar\u00e9 \u201cfelt a sort of\nrevolt\u201d against the proposition that \u201ctheoretical physics\nis a mere collection of recipes\u201d and he \u201cloudly proclaimed\nthat a physical theory gives us something else than the mere knowledge\nof the facts, that it makes us discover the real relations among\nthings ([1906] 2007: 446; improved translation from the French\noriginal by Marie Guegeun and the author).\n\nIn his address to the 1900 International Congress of Physics in Paris,\nPoincar\u00e9 made a definitive intervention in the\nbankruptcy-of-science debate and its history-fed pessimism. He\ndescribed the challenge thus:\n\n\nThe people of world [les gens du monde] are struck to see how\nephemeral scientific theories are. After some years of prosperity,\nthey see them successively abandoned; they see ruins accumulated on\nruins; they predict that the theories in fashion today will quickly\nsuccumb in their turn, and they conclude that they are absolutely\nfutile. This is what they call the bankruptcy of science\n(1900: 14, author\u2019s translation).\n\n\nThe view of \u2018the people of the world\u2019 is not right:\n\n\nTheir scepticism is superficial; they understand none of the aim and\nthe role of scientific theories; otherwise they would understand that\nruins can still be good for something.\n\n\nBut unlike the positivist trend around him, Poincar\u00e9 took it\nthat scientific theories offer knowledge of the relational structure\nof the world behind the phenomena. In the Introduction to La\nScience et l\u2019Hypoth\u00e9se in 1902, he made clear what\nhe took to be the right answer to the historical challenge:\n\n\nWithout doubt, at first, the theories seem to us fragile, and the\nhistory of science proves to us how ephemeral they are; yet they do\nnot entirely perish, and of each of them something remains. It is this\nsomething we must seek to unravel, since there and there alone is the\ntrue reality. (1902: 26, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argued that what survives in theory-change are\nrelations among physical magnitudes, expressed by mathematical\nequations within theories. His prime example was the reproduction of\nFresnel\u2019s laws concerning the relations of amplitudes of\nreflected rays vis-\u00e0-vis the amplitude of incident rays in the\ninterface of two media within Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism, although in this transition, the interpretation of\nthese laws changed dramatically, from an ether-based account to an\nelectromagnetic-field-based account. For Poincar\u00e9\n\n\nThese equations express relations, and if the equations remain true it\nis because these relations preserve their reality. They teach us,\nbefore and after, that there is such and such a relation between some\nthing and some other thing; only this something we used to call\nmotion, we now call it electric current. But these\nnames were only images substituted for the real objects which nature\nwill eternally hide from us. The true relations between these real\nobjects are the only reality we can attain to, and the only condition\nis that the same relations exist between these objects as between the\nimages by which we are forced to replace them. If these relations are\nknown, what does it matter if we deem it convenient to replace one\nimage by another? (1900: 15, author\u2019s translation.\n\n\nIn recent literature, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s line of thought has come\nto be known as structural realism, though it may be best if\nwe describe it as \u2018relationism\u2019. In the Introduction to\nLa Science et l\u2019Hypoth\u00e9se, he noted that\n\n\nthe things themselves are not what it [science] can reach, as the\nnaive dogmatists think, but only the relations between things. Apart\nfrom these relations there is no knowable reality. (1902: 25,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nIt should be stressed that Poincar\u00e9 does not deny that there is\nreality outside relations; but he does deny that this reality is\nknowable. Note also that Poincar\u00e9 does not use the\nexpression \u2018things in themselves\u2019 (choses en soi)\nbut the expression \u2018things themselves\u2019 (chose\nelles-memes). Elsewhere he talks about the \u201cnature of\nthings\u201d or \u201creal objects\u201d. It is quite clear that he\nwanted to draw a distinction between how things are\u2014what their\nnature is\u2014and how they are related to each other (and\nto us qua knowers). A plausible way to draw this distinction\nis to differentiate between the intrinsic and perhaps fully\nqualitative properties of things\u2014what he plausibly calls\n\u2018nature\u2019 of things\u2014and their relations. The former\nare unknowable, whereas the latter are\n knowable.[3]\n\nSo, Poincar\u00e9 and Duhem initiated a strategy for dealing with\ntheory-change in science which pointed to substantial continuities\namong successive theories. For them, the continuity is, by and large,\nrelational (and in this sense mathematical). Hence,\nmathematically-convergent scientific theories reveal the relational\nstructure of the world.\n",
