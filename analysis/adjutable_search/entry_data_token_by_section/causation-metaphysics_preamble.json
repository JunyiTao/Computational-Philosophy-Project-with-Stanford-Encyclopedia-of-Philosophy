    "main_text": "\n\nConsider the following claims:\n\nThe drought caused the famine.\nDrowsy driving causes crashes.\nHow much I water my plant influences how tall it\ngrows.\nHow much novocaine a patient receives affects how much\npain they will feel during dental surgery.\n\n\nThe metaphysics of causation asks questions about what it takes for\nclaims like these to be true\u2014what kind of relation the claims\nare about, and in virtue of what these relations obtain.\n\nAlthough both 1 and 2 are broadly causal claims, some think that they\nare not claims about the same kind of causal relation. These\ncausal relations may be differentiated by their relata. Claim 1\nrelates tokens. It talks about a particular drought\nand famine, not droughts and famines in general. On the other\nhand, claim 2 relates types\u2014it is not talking about any\nparticular instance of drowsy driving, but rather drowsy driving\nin general. A prominent view is that there are different\nkinds of causal relation corresponding to these different kinds of\nrelata. (See, for instance, Sober 1985 and Eells 1991.)\n\nContrast 1 and 2 with claims like 3 and 4. In claim 3, the causal verb\n\u201cinfluences\u201d is not flanked by token happenings, nor types\nof happenings. Instead, it is flanked by what we can call variable\nexpressions. Variable expressions are interrogative clauses like\n\u201chow much I weigh\u201d, \u201cwhat the scale reads\u201d,\n\u201cwhen the game ends\u201d, and \u201cwhether I catch the\nbus\u201d. We can call the denotation of variable expressions\nvariables. Just as we distinguish between token happenings\nand types of happenings, we may distinguish between token variables\nand type variables. For instance, how much I weigh is a token\nvariable whose value depends upon my weight. How much Barack Obama\nweighs is a different token variable whose value depends upon\nObama\u2019s weight. We may say that how much I exercise affects how\nmuch I weigh. And we may say that how much Obama exercises affects how\nmuch Obama weighs. These are two different claims are about causal\nrelations between token variables. Alternatively, we could claim that\nhow much one exercises affects how much one weighs. On its face, this\nis not a claim about any particular variable. Instead, it is talking\nabout how exercise affects weight in general. It asserts a\nrelationship between two types of variables. Likewise, 4\ndoesn\u2019t make a claim about the relationship between any\nparticular individual\u2019s novocaine and sensation. Instead, it\nsays something about how novocaine affects sensation in\ngeneral.\n\nWe will be careful to distinguish these four different kinds of causal\nclaims. Unfortunately, there is no standard terminology to mark the\ndistinction between causal claims likes like 1 & 2 and causal\nclaims like 3 & 4. So let us introduce new conventions. To mark\ntheir contrast with variables, call causal relata like droughts,\nfamines, and car crashes (whether type or token)\n\u201cconstants\u201d. Then, let us call the relation which holds\nbetween constants causation. A causal claim that relates\ntoken constants will be called a claim about token causation.\n(This is sometimes called singular causation, or actual\ncausation.) A causal claim that relates types of constants will\nbe called a claim about type causation. (This is sometimes\ncalled general causation.) On the other hand, the relation\nwhich holds between variables (whether type or token) will be called\ninfluence. A causal claim that relates token variables will\nbe called a claim about token influence. (Hitchcock 2007a,\nuses token causal structure for a network of relations of\ntoken influence.) A causal claim that relates types of variables will\nbe called a claim about type influence.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTokens\nTypes  \n\n\nConstants\nToken Causation\nType Causation \n\nVariables\nToken Influence\nType Influence  \n\n\nFor each of these putative causal relations, we can raise metaphysical\nquestions: What are their relata? What is their arity? In virtue of\nwhat do those relata stand in the relevant causal relation? And how\ndoes this kind of causal relation relate to the others? Of course,\nthere is disagreement about whether each\u2014or any\u2014of these\nrelations exists. Russell (1912: 1) famously denied that there are any\ncausal relations at all, quipping that causation is \u201ca relic of\na bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is\nerroneously supposed to do no harm\u201d (see also Norton 2003).\nOthers may deny that there is a relation of general causation or\ninfluence at all, contending that claims like 2 and 3 are simply\ngeneralizations about token causal relations (see\n \u00a72.1\n below). There will also be disagreement about whether these relations\nare reducible, and, if so, what they can be reduced\n to\u2014probabilities,\n regularities,\n counterfactuals,\n processes,\n dispositions,\n mechanisms,\n agency,\n or what-have-you. This entry will not attempt to survey the range of\npotential answers to these questions. Instead, it will focus on more\ngeneral questions about the causal relata, the arity of the causal\nrelation, prominent or controversial instances of these\ncausal relations, how the different relations are themselves related,\nand so on.\n",
