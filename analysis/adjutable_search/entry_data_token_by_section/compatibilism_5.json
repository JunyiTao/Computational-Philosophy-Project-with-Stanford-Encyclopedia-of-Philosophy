    "main_text": "Classical Compatibilism || Freedom According to Classical Compatibilism\n2.1 Freedom According to Classical Compatibilism\n\nAccording to one strand within classical compatibilism, freedom is\nnothing more than an agent\u2019s ability to do what she wishes in\nthe absence of impediments that would otherwise stand in her way. For\ninstance, Hobbes offers an exemplary expression of classical\ncompatibilism when he claims that a person\u2019s freedom consists in\nhis finding \u201cno stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or\ninclination to doe [sic]\u201d (Leviathan, p.108). On\nthis view, freedom involves two components, a positive and a negative\none. The positive component (doing what one wills, desires, or\ninclines to do) consists in nothing more than what is involved in the\npower of agency. The negative component (finding \u201cno\nstop\u201d) consists in acting unencumbered or unimpeded. Typically,\nthe classical compatibilists\u2019 benchmark of impeded or encumbered\naction is compelled action. Compelled action arises when one is forced\nby some external source to act contrary to one\u2019s will.\n\nFor the classical compatibilist, then, free will is an ability to do\nwhat one wants. It is therefore plausible to conclude that the truth\nof determinism does not entail that agents lack free will since it\ndoes not entail that agents never do what they wish to do, nor that\nagents are necessarily encumbered in acting. Compatibilism is thus\nvindicated.\n\nBut how convincing is the classical compatibilist account of free\nwill? As it stands, it cries out for refinement. To cite just one\nshortcoming, various mental illnesses can cause a person to act as she\nwants and do so unencumbered; yet, intuitively, it would seem that she\ndoes not act of her own free will. For example, imagine a person\nsuffering from a form of psychosis that causes full-fledged\nhallucinations. While hallucinating, she might \u201cact as she wants\nunencumbered,\u201d but she could hardly be said to be acting of her\nown free will. Consequently, the classical compatibilist owes us more.\nTo see how it might be supplemented, we turn to a distinctively\nincompatibilist way of undermining classical compatibilism\n",
