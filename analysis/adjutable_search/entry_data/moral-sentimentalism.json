    "preamble": "\n\nFor moral sentimentalists, our emotions and desires play a leading\nrole in the anatomy of morality. Some believe moral thoughts are\nfundamentally sentimental, others that moral facts are related to our\nsentimental responses, or that emotions are the primary source of\nmoral knowledge. Some believe all these things. The two main\nattractions of sentimentalism are making sense of the practical\naspects of morality, on the one hand, and finding a place for morality\nwithin a naturalistic worldview, on the other. The corresponding\nchallenges are accounting for the apparent objectivity and normativity\nof morality. Recent psychological theories emphasizing the centrality\nof emotion in moral thinking have prompted renewed interest in\nsentimentalist ethics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Many Moral Sentimentalisms\n\nConsider the following story related by Frans de Waal:\n\n\nJ. lives in a small seaside town in France, where he is known as the\nhandyman he is. He can build an entire house with his own hands, as he\nis skilled in carpentry, plumbing, masonry, roof work, and so on.\n[\u2026] Being extremely nice, J. usually dispenses advice or lends\na helping hand. One neighbor, whom he barely knew, kept asking about\nhow to put a skylight in his roof. [\u2026]\n\nJ. spent from morning until late evening with the neighbor, basically\ndoing the job on his own (as the neighbor could barely hold a hammer,\nhe said), during which time the neighbor\u2019s wife came, cooked,\nand ate lunch (the main meal in France) with her husband without\noffering J. anything. By the end of the day, he had successfully put\nthe skylight in, having provided expert labor that normally would have\ncost more than six hundred euros. J. asked for nothing, but when the\nsame neighbor a few days later talked about a scuba diving course, and\nhow it would be fun to do together, he felt this opened a perfect\noccasion for a return gift, since the course cost about 150 euros. So\nJ. said he\u2019d love to go, but unfortunately didn\u2019t have the\nmoney in his budget. By now you can guess: The man went alone. (de\nWaal 2009: 174\u2013175)\n\n\nIf we assume the story is true and leaves nothing of importance out,\nwe\u2019re likely to have two kinds of response to it: we have a\nnegative feeling of some sort towards the neighbour, and we think that\nthe neighbour acted wrongly towards poor J. Roughly speaking,\nsentimentalists think that these two responses are intimately related,\nwith the feeling in the driving seat. Since different theories in the\nsentimentalist family make use of different responses, this entry will\nadopt a liberal definition of a \u2018sentiment\u2019 that includes\nnon-cognitive attitudes and states of all kinds \u2013 emotions,\nfeelings, affects, desires, plans, and dispositions to have them.\n\nThis core idea gives rise to many questions. One is explanatory: Why\ndo we think that the neighbour did something wrong? Explanatory\nsentimentalists believe that moral thoughts are fundamentally\nexplained by sentiments or emotions. The second kind of question is\nconstitutive: What does our thought that the neighbour did something\nwrong consist in? That is, what kind of thought is it? Is it more like\nbelieving that Pluto is a planet or like wanting to hit an\nuncooperative computer? Judgment sentimentalists believe that\nmoral judgments are constituted by emotional or non-cognitive\nresponses, at least in part, or alternatively are judgments\nabout emotional responses or the tendency of something to\ngive rise to them. Some judgment sentimentalists are also\nexpressivists, who believe that the meanings of moral terms\nmust be accounted for in terms of associated non-cognitive states.\n\nThird, assuming that we\u2019ve got it right, what kind of fact if\nany makes our thought that the neighbour acted wrongly true? Is the\nwrongness of the action a projection of our sentiments? If it is a\nfact, is it like the fact that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum\nof the squares of the other two sides of a right triangle, or like the\nfact that water is H2O, or perhaps more like the fact that\nrotten food is disgusting? For metaphysical sentimentalists,\nmoral facts have to do with our sentimental responses, or moral and\nevaluative concepts are concepts of properties of causing or\nwarranting sentimental responses. Finally, we\u2019re pretty\nconfident of our judgment. But even if we assume we know all the\npertinent empirical facts, how do we know that what the neighbour did\nis wrong? What if someone disagrees? How can we justify our verdict?\nEpistemic sentimentalists believe that sentimental responses\nof a suitable kind play a central role in moral justification or\nunderstanding.\n\nThese sentimentalist views are logically independent of each other.\nOne indication of this is that they contrast with different views.\nEpistemic and possibly explanatory sentimentalist views contrast with\nrationalist and intuitionist views, according to\nwhich we can acquire moral knowledge by reasoning or intuition,\nrespectively, rather than via emotion. Some, though not all, judgment\nsentimentalist views contrast with cognitivist accounts\nof moral judgment. Metaphysical sentimentalist views, in turn,\ncontrast with error theory and mind-independent moral\nrealism in naturalist and non-naturalist variants.\n2. Explanatory Sentimentalism\n\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary philosophers to see sentimentalism\nas a theory of moral judgment or facts. But classical sentimentalists\nconsidered the primary question to be a moral psychological\none: What feature of human nature \u2013 reason, sentiment, or\nintellectual intuition \u2013 explains why we approve of something or\nblame someone? (See David Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human\nNature (T), 456 and Adam Smith\u2019s The Theory of Moral\nSentiments (TMS), 312\u2013313.) Some of their main arguments\nwere introduced in the context of this explanatory question, which\nlies on the border between philosophy and what is now the empirical\nscience of psychology.\n2.1 Moral Sense Theories\n\nWhile the importance of emotion in ethical thought has been recognized\nby philosophers at least since Aristotle and Mencius, the roots of the\nmodern sentimentalist tradition in ethics go back to early\n18th century debates in Britain. Anthony Ashley Cooper,\nbetter known by his title as the Earl of Shaftesbury, introduced the\nnotion of a moral sense in his Inquiry Concerning\nVirtue, or Merit. According to Shaftesbury, the primary\nobject of moral evaluation is the \u201caffection\u201d or motive\nbehind the action. Such affections can, by reflection, become the\nobject of a second-order affection:\n\n\nIn a Creature capable of forming general Notions of Things, not only\nthe outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the\nObjects of the Affection; but the very Actions themselves, and the\nAffections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their Contrarys, being\nbrought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects. So that, by means\nof this reflected Sense, there arises another kind of Affection\ntowards those very Affections themselves, which have been already\nfelt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or Dislike.\n(Shaftesbury 1699\u20131714: 16)\n\n\nMoral approval is explained by (and perhaps consists in) this sort of\nsecond-order liking, which Shaftesbury usually designates the\n\u2018Sense of Right or Wrong\u2019. This sense is innate or\nnatural, and can be displaced only by \u201ccontrary habit and\ncustom\u201d (1699\u20131714: 25), although it may on occasion be\novercome by \u201crage, lust, or any other counterworking\npassion\u201d (1699\u20131714: 35). On Shaftesbury\u2019s view,\nwhat it approves of are natural or public affections, which are the\nbeautiful and harmonious motives tending towards the good of the whole\nsystem of rational creatures. To be virtuous, a creature must not only\ndo the right things, but exercise its moral sense and act for the very\nreason that something is worthy and honest (1699\u20131714: 18).\nThat\u2019s why even the kindest dog can\u2019t be virtuous, as long\nas it lacks the ability to reflect on its affections and act on the\nresulting affect.\n\nFrances Hutcheson fills in Shaftesbury\u2019s sketch to some extent.\nHis argument for the existence of a moral sense draws on his rejection\nof rationalism and intuitionism (see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments).\n Since we don\u2019t approve of actions because of self-interest or\nself-evidence, something else must explain our convictions. According\nto him, a sense is a \u201cdetermination of the mind, to\nreceive any idea from the presence of an object which occurs to us,\nindependent of our will\u201d (1725: 90). There are many more such\nsenses than traditionally acknowledged. Since moral ideas arise\nspontaneously, Hutcheson concludes we have a moral sense,\n\n\na determination of our minds to receive amiable or disagreeable ideas\nof Actions, when they occur to observation, antecedent to any opinions\nof advantage or loss to redound to ourselves from them. (1725:\n100)\n\n\nThe moral sense, though not moral ideas, is innate, as can be seen\nfrom the sentiments of small children when they begin to respond to\nactions (1725: 145\u2013146).\n\nOn Hutcheson\u2019s early (and best known) view, what the moral sense\napproves of is above all \u201cthe general calm desire of the\nhappiness of others\u201d, in distinction from particular benevolent\npassions like love and compassion (1728: 175). On this picture, in\ncontrast to Shaftesbury, the motive of morally praiseworthy actions is\nbenevolence and not the thought that the action is obligatory\nor that it would be approved of by the moral sense itself. In\nHutcheson\u2019s terminology, moral sense is the source of justifying\nreasons, but not exciting reasons. (For the development of\nHutcheson\u2019s views, see Bishop 1996).\n\nSome key features of these early sentimentalist theories are shared by\nthe psychologist Jonathan Haidt\u2019s (2012) contemporary model.\nHaidt\u2019s starting point is an increasingly common distinction in\npsychology between two kinds of cognitive process. Type I or intuitive\nprocesses are automatic, effortless, fast, often associative,\nparallel, affective, and often modular (that is, making use of only\ndomain-specific information). We are only conscious of their outputs,\nnot the processes themselves. (They are thus parallel to\nHutcheson\u2019s \u2018senses\u2019.) Type II\n\u2018reflective\u2019 or \u2018reasoning\u2019 processes are, in\ncontrast, conscious, effortful, slow, memory-taxing, sometimes\ninferential, rational, and linear processes. As is common in\npsychology, Haidt uses the term \u2018intuition\u2019 for beliefs\nthat result from the intuitive processes.\n\nHaidt\u2019s empirical claim is that moral judgments are for the most\npart intuitions proximally caused by gut reactions, quick and\nautomatic flashes of affect. In support of this, manipulating affect\nhas been shown to make a difference to people\u2019s judgments\n(Wheatley and Haidt 2005), and areas of the brain associated with such\naffective responses found active when people make judgments (e.g.,\nGreene and Haidt 2002; Moll, de Oliveira-Souza, and Eslinger 2003).\nFurther, in some studies, people are easily dumbfounded when\nchallenged on their moral views: they cannot (Haidt claims) give\nreasons for why they disapprove of harmless sibling incest, for\nexample (Haidt 2001). On Haidt\u2019s somewhat pessimistic picture,\nthe role of reason is for the most part lawyerly rationalization of\nthe pre-existing gut reactions, in particular in a social context. In\nthe same vein, Joshua Greene (2008) claims on the basis of brain\nimaging and reaction-time data (Greene et al. 2001), among others,\nthat it is in particular deontological judgments, such as the\nthought that it is wrong to kill one person as a means to save five,\nthat are driven by affective gut reactions, which philosophers like\nKant subsequently try to rationalize. Greene holds that\nutilitarian judgments, in contrast, result from conscious\nreasoning. However, Guy Kahane (2012) argues persuasively that once we\nlook at broader data, we see that the difference between Type I and\nType II processes corresponds to the difference between intuitive and\ncounterintuitive judgments rather than deontological and utilitarian\ncontent.\n\nWhere the early sentimentalists gesture towards divine providence when\nit comes to explaining why we have a moral sense and why it approves\nof things like benevolence, Haidt\u2019s story appeals to evolution.\nHe believes we are pre-programmed to respond to suffering with\ncompassion, the arrogance of subordinates with contempt, cheating with\nanger, and impurity with disgust, for example. These culturally\nfine-tuned affective responses are in turn distally explained by\nhaving been evolutionary \u201cadaptations to long-standing threats\nand opportunities in social life\u201d of our ancestors (Haidt\n2012).\n\nOne challenge for Haidt\u2019s view is that unlike classical\nsentimentalist views, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between moral and\nnon-moral evaluations. When talking about intuitions in his sense, he\nsays that\n\n\nthe brain has a kind of gauge (sometimes called a\n\u201clike-ometer\u201d) that is constantly moving back and forth,\nand these movements, these quick judgments, influence whatever comes\nnext. (Haidt and Bj\u00f6rklund 2008: 186\u2013187)\n\n\nBut we don\u2019t regard everything we dislike, or even everything\nthat makes us angry, as morally wrong. The story is at least\nincomplete. Further, as a psychologist, Haidt naturally offers no\na priori arguments against the possibility of reason yielding\nmoral verdicts. All he can claim is that people don\u2019t\nusually engage in reasoning first. Even if that is true, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that people\u2019s judgments are not shaped by\nreasoning or that they are insensitive to reasons. Indeed, Daniel\nJacobson (2012) points out that the evidence that people lack reasons\nfor their judgments is in fact very thin. In Haidt\u2019s most famous\nexample, even harmless sibling incest involves a significant\nrisk of suffering emotional repercussions (Railton 2014:\n849). The vibe at your sister\u2019s wedding three years later might\nnot be quite the same. People might not be able to immediately\narticulate such reasons, but that doesn\u2019t show that they were\nnot responding to them. Rather than being mere rationalization,\npost hoc reasoning might then be a process of trying to\narticulate the considerations one\u2019s intuitive judgments were\nresponsive to.\n\nRecently, Joshua May (2018) has challenged the primacy of affect in\nmoral thought on empirical grounds. He argues that the best evidence\nwe have supports only a more modest role for emotions as facilitating\n(or hindering) information processing. May notes that manipulating\nincidental emotions \u2013 that is, emotions that are not directed\ntowards or aroused by the object of moral judgment, such as disgust\ncaused by foul odors (Schnall et al. 2008) \u2013 has only been found\nto have minor effects. He rightly points out that such scarce and\nminor effects don\u2019t support any claims about a leading or\nessential role for affect in moral judgment. Following Heidi Maibom\n(2005), he also argues that problems in the moral judgment of\npsychopaths are better explained by rational rather than emotional\ndeficits.\n\nMay holds that instead of mere feeling, moral judgments are typically\nexplained by reasoning, albeit often reasoning of an automatic and\nunconscious Type I variety. He supports this claim by appeal to many\nstudies that suggest that moral judgments are sensitive to features\nlike intentionality (see Young and Tsoi 2013 for an overview) and the\nuse of personal force (see Greene et al. 2009), and more generally the\nextent of attributed agential involvement. As May summarizes the view,\n\u201cWe often rapidly infer the moral status of an action in part by\nrelying on general principles that identify as morally relevant\nvarious features of agents, actions, and outcomes\u2026. This is a\nmatter of reasoning or inference, whether implicit, explicit, or some\ncombination of the two across time\u201d (2018: 70).\n\nWhile May\u2019s data and arguments are a healthy corrective for some\nexaggerated forms of explanatory sentimentalism, such as\nHaidt\u2019s, it is unclear how much sentimentalists should worry\nabout them. After all, the key evidence for explanatory sentimentalism\nis not meant to come from incidental emotions, but from the\nfact that we, say, disapprove of the sort of things that independently\narouse negative emotion. The sentimentalist can relatively easily\nexplain the targets of our condemnation by appealing to independent\nemotional reactions, while for the rationalist, it is merely a\ncoincidence that apes get mad about the very same sort of things that\nour reason tells us to disapprove of. And it is compatible with\nexplanatory sentimentalism that people first reason\n(consciously or not) about non-moral facts and then respond with\nemotion, which is still needed to cross the gap between non-moral and\nmoral judgment. As Hume has it, although sentiment renders the final\nverdict, \u201cin order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and\ngive a proper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we\nfind, that much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be\nmade, just conclusions drawn\u201d (1751: 15).\n2.2 Sympathy/Empathy-Based Theories\n\nWhat is distinctive of David Hume and Adam Smith is that although they\noccasionally use the term \u2018moral sense\u2019, they do not take\nit to be a primitive, innate capacity, but rather aim to explain its\nworkings in terms of more basic mechanisms, in particular what they\ncall \u2018sympathy\u2019. In contemporary use, the term is often\nused for a kind of concern for another. But Hume, Smith, and Sophie de\nGrouchy (1798), in different ways, used it for sharing what another\nfeels. The contemporary term for this kind of mechanism is\nempathy (for the distinction between sympathy and empathy,\nsee Darwall 1998; Sober and Wilson 1998; Fleischacker 2019). This\nsection will nevertheless use the older term, since what the classical\nsentimentalists talk about isn\u2019t always quite\n\u2018empathy\u2019 either.\n\nFollowing Hutcheson, Hume rejects reason or reasoning as the source of\nmoral distinctions (judgments or facts). Briefly, he believes that\nreason alone cannot motivate us in the way that morality does\n(motivation scepticism), and that reasoning alone cannot tell\nus what\u2019s right or wrong (content scepticism). For\ndiscussion, see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments.\n\nOn Hume\u2019s positive account, moral approval is caused, if not\nconstituted, by pleasure of a special kind, or a form of love towards\nthe agent when considering their character impartially:\n\n\n\u2019Tis only when a character is considered in general, without\nreference to our particular interest, that it causes such a feeling or\nsentiment, as denominates it morally good or evil. (T 472)\n\n\nBut why does contemplation of a character without reference to our own\ninterest give us pleasure in the first place? Not because we\u2019re\nsimply equipped with an innate moral sense, but because of the\noperation of sympathy, which offers a more parsimonious and systematic\nexplanation of the phenomena. For Hume, its mechanism is a kind of\nanalogical association from the effects of a passion to their cause or\nvice versa, which generates the same passion in the observer (T 576).\nGrouchy observed that the importance of memory in this process has\npolitical implications: the privileged who skip the \u201cschool of\npain and adversity\u201d will be lacking in compassion (1798: 62). On\nHume\u2019s account, once the pleasures and pains of others are\ncommunicated to us, we are ourselves pleased in a special way when\ncontemplating those durable character traits that reliably please\nothers. This special kind of pleasure \u2018denominates\u2019 the\ntrait as virtuous or vicious:\n\n\nWhen any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind,\nwe are pleased with it, and approve of it; because it presents the\nlively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is\nitself a kind of pleasure. (T 580)\n\n\nHume notes two ways in which our moral approval diverges from what\ncauses sympathetic pleasure, however. First, what comes naturally to\nus is taking on the feelings of the near and the dear, those who are\nclose to or similar to us and those we care about. (This observation\nof bias inherent in empathy has recently been rediscovered by Prinz\n2011 and Bloom 2017.) Yet we can also approve of the virtues of\ndistant strangers, even enemies. Second, we sometimes approve of\n\u201cvirtue in rags\u201d: an honest and generous person, who is\n(say) imprisoned and thus in no position to benefit others, is not\nconsidered morally worse than someone with the same traits who\nactually does please those around her.\n\nHume\u2019s answer to these challenges is that we correct\nour initial responses for bias and the influence of moral luck, as\nwell as our present disposition \u2013 not because we aim for some\nstandard that is independent of our responses, but because of\n\u201cmany contradictions to our sentiments in society and\nconversation\u201d (T 583) that result from relying on\n\u201cmomentary appearances\u201d (T 582). After all, when someone\nuses moral language and calls someone \u201cvicious\u201d,\n\u201codious\u201d, or \u201cdepraved\u201d, she \u201cexpresses\nsentiments, in which, he expects, all his audience are to concur with\nhim\u201d (Hume 1751: 75). It is this expectation of concurrence\ncharacteristic of moral sentiments that pushes us towards a\n\u201ccommon point of view\u201d (ibid.) in moral judging, a point\nof view that abstracts from our particular interests, current\ndisposition, and relation to the agent, and focuses on the effects of\nthe person\u2019s character traits on people around them (T\n602\u20133) (see Sayre-McCord 1994).\n\nAdam Smith presents a different theory about the nature and mechanisms\nof sympathy and consequently moral and evaluative approval. For Smith,\nthe key mechanism of sympathy is imaginatively projecting oneself in\nanother\u2019s position, or what would now be called\nsimulation (Gordon 1995), rather than mere emotional\ncontagion, association, or inference. In Smith\u2019s official\ndefinition, sympathy consists in concord between what one takes the\nother to actually feel and what one feels oneself as a result of\nputting oneself in the other\u2019s shoes. Approbation is the\npleasant feeling that results from perceiving this rough coincidence\n(TMS 56 note a), perhaps because it simultaneously confirms our common\nhumanity and the distinctness of our perspectives (Fleischacker 2019,\n28\u201331). Although this account of \u2018sense of\npropriety\u2019 is sometimes described as Smith\u2019s theory of\nmoral judgment, he regards it as a perfectly general account of\nevaluation, encompassing belief, sense of humour, or business\ndecisions. When it comes to judgments of moral merit or demerit, or\nthe qualities of deserving praise or blame, what counts is our\nsympathy with the gratitude and resentment of those\naffected by the action, on the one hand, and with the agent\u2019s\nmotives, on the other. Like Hume, Smith recognizes that moral approval\nrequires departing from one\u2019s personal point of view:\n\n\nBut [resentment and gratitude], as well as all the other passions of\nhuman nature, seem proper and are approved of, when the heart of every\nimpartial spectator entirely sympathizes with them, when every\nindifferent by-stander entirely enters into, and goes along with them.\n(TMS 81)\n\n\nThe figure of an impartial spectator also plays a key role in\nSmith\u2019s account of self-directed moral judgment or conscience.\nBecause we want others to sympathize with us (and thus approve of us),\nwe strive to bring our passions to a level that an imagined informed\nand impartial spectator could sympathize with (Kopajtic 2020). Antti\nKauppinen (2010: 236\u2013239; 2014a) argues that this can be seen in\ncontemporary psychological terms as a form of emotion regulation by\nmeans of refocusing attention and reappraising the meaning of the\naction.\n\nMichael Slote\u2019s recent sentimentalist account picks up the\nthread of empathy/sympathy-based theories, along with\nHutcheson\u2019s emphasis on benevolence. Slote\u2019s claim is that\nmoral approval is constituted and explained by empathizing with an\nagent\u2019s motives:\n\n\n[I]f agents\u2019 actions reflect empathic concern for (the well\nbeing or wishes of) others, empathic beings will feel warmly or\ntenderly toward them, and such warmth and tenderness empathically\nreflect the empathic warmth or tenderness of the agents. \u2026\n[S]uch empathy with empathy \u2026 also constitutes moral approval,\nand possibly admiration as well, for agents and/or their actions.\n(Slote 2010: 34\u201335)\n\n\nSome people\u2019s actions exhibit empathy toward others. This\nempathy is a warm feeling. When we empathize with the agent, we come\nto share this warm feeling. And this empathic warm feeling constitutes\nmoral approval. In contrast, unempathetic actions manifest a coldness\ntowards others. Since moral approval and disapproval \u201center into\nthe making of moral judgments\u201d, Slote believes empathy can\nexplain our intuitions and judgments.\n\nSlote\u2019s account has been criticized from within the\nsentimentalist camp. Jesse Prinz (2011) notes that the view has\ndifficulty with disapproval: failure to empathize is not the same\nthing as disapprobation, nor does it have the same kind of\nmotivational effect. Julia Driver (2011) points out that people with\nempathy deficits can nevertheless morally approve or disapprove of\nthings. Slote\u2019s view also faces challenges of both necessity and\nsufficiency, in that it seems possible that we approve of un-empathic\nactions (such as doing something out of a sense of duty, or doing the\nright thing for the wrong reason), and that there are empathetic\nactions we don\u2019t approve of (such as empathy-motivated helping\nof one victim at the expense of many others who are less close or\nsimilar to the agent).\n\nEmpathic feelings may enter into the explanation of moral judgment\nmore indirectly, however. Shaun Nichols\u2019s (2004) version of\nsentimentalism shares the Humean ambition of explaining moral thought\nwithout assuming an innate moral capacity or sense. Instead, Nichols\nassumes that normal people have a generic capacity to be guided by\nnorms or rules of various kinds, and certain non-moral emotional\ndispositions, such as the disposition to have an aversive response to\nsuffering in others. His hypothesis is that we regard a rule-violation\nas moral (and thus wrong independently of what anyone tells us to do)\nrather than conventional (something that owes its status to being\nprohibited by some local de facto authority) when the rule in\nquestion is affect-backed, that is, when it prohibits actions\nof a type that we independently have a negative emotional reaction\ntowards (Nichols 2004: 62).\n\nOne important source of support for this claim is that people who lack\nthe relevant affective response, such as psychopaths, appear to fail\nat distinguishing between moral and conventional rules, even if their\nrational capacities are intact (cf. Aaltola 2014). At the same time,\nNichols holds that particular moral judgments can be simply\napplications of affect-backed rules, and don\u2019t require on-line\naffective response. This indirect explanatory sentimentalism was\nanticipated by some earlier sentimentalists. Adam Smith noted that we\nmake the \u201cgreater part of\u201d our moral judgments on the\nbasis of general rules, which are for him based on induction from\nemotional responses to particular cases (TMS 377). Similarly, Grouchy\nholds that reflection generates abstract and general moral sentiments,\nwhich we obey \u201cwithout thinking back to the way in which they\nwere first formed and all that justified them\u201d (1798: 112).\nEdward Westermarck held that many judgments are \u201capplications of\nsome accepted general rule\u201d, whose acceptance is ultimately\nexplained by the existence of an \u201cemotional sanction\u201d in\nthe judge\u2019s mind (Westermarck 1906: 6).\n\nNichols believes that his sentimental rules account also offers an\nexplanation of universality of certain norms. We do not have to assume\nthat people have an innate tendency to regard causing harm to\ninnocents as morally wrong. Instead, it is plausible that of the\nvarious norms that different societies have come up with, those that\nresonate with our non-moral emotional dispositions enjoy a higher\n\u2018cultural fitness\u2019 (Nichols 2004: 127) and thus become\nmore prevalent over time. Since we can account for (nearly)\npan-cultural moral rules as well as moral judgment without appeal to\ndedicated innate mechanisms, Nichols (2005) concludes that morality is\nan evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation.\n3. Judgment Sentimentalism\n\nSentimentalism is commonly understood as a thesis about moral\njudgments or concepts. Moral thought\ninvolves or refers to our sentiments, and moral language\nsomehow or other expresses or refers to sentiments. Judgment\nsentimentalism comes both in non-cognitivist and cognitivist\nvarieties.\n3.1 Non-Cognitivist Sentimentalism\n\nOn pure non-cognitivist views, moral thoughts are constituted by\nsentiments. To think that X is wrong is, at least in part, to\nhave a negative sentiment towards X, or perhaps to have a\nhigher-order positive attitude towards a negative sentiment towards\nX. Here is the most famous argument in favour of\nnon-cognitivism:\n\nThe Argument from Internalism\n\nMoral judgments are intrinsically at least defeasibly motivating.\n(Weak Internalism)\nOnly\n non-cognitive psychological states with a world-to-mind direction of\nfit are intrinsically motivating; beliefs, which have a mind-to-world\ndirection of fit, do not alone motivate (The Humean Theory of\nMotivation).\nSo, moral judgments are (at least in part) constituted by\nnon-cognitive psychological states.\n\n\nThe argument is clearly related to arguments from practicality against\nrationalism (see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement).\n The first premise postulates an internal connection between moral\njudgment and motivation. Weak Internalists believe, roughly, that\njudging that I morally ought to stop downloading movies entails that I\nhave at least some motivation to stop downloading movies. Otherwise I\ndon\u2019t genuinely regard the action as morally wrong. My moral\nconvictions are manifest in my motivational tendencies, if not always\nin action. Why? Basically, because the point of thinking in moral\nterms isn\u2019t to discover some facts about the universe, but to\nget ourselves to act in ways that allow us to live together and reap\nthe benefits of cooperation. Simon Blackburn (1988) and Allan Gibbard\n(1990) point out that any evolutionary benefits moral thought might\nhave depend on its practicality. (See also Lenman (1999) and the entry\non\n Moral Motivation.)\n\nThe second premise of the argument is a thesis in the philosophy of\nmind. Some mental states, like descriptive beliefs, represent how\nthings are, and have a mind-to-world direction of\nfit. Other mental states are not descriptive, though\nthey may have the same propositional content as beliefs. If you want\nyour car to work and notice that it refuses to start, your desire does\nnot tend to go out of existence, unlike your belief that your car is\nworking (Smith 1987). Rather, it moves you to do something you believe\nwould make the car work, such as call a mechanic. It has a\nworld-to-mind direction of fit. Although particular ways of\ndrawing the distinction remain controversial (see e.g. Sobel and Copp\n2001; Frost 2014), the key idea that descriptive beliefs themselves\nare motivationally inert is widely accepted.\n\nFinally, the conclusion comes in different strengths. Traditional\nnon-cognitivists believe that moral judgments simply are non-cognitive\nstates. But what kind of states? They are clearly not mere desires,\nsince we can desire things we don\u2019t regard as desirable. Early\nnon-cognitivists talked about a special \u2018ethical feeling\u2019\n(Ayer 1936), identified in phenomenological terms. But there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any common phenomenological character to all\nthe various moral thoughts we have. So contemporary non-cognitivists\nappeal to the functional role of moral attitudes instead, to\ntheir distinctive part in our overall psychology. Blackburn\u2019s\n(1998) idea is that moral thoughts involve higher-order attitudes\ntowards desires and preferences. When I morally disapprove of\npolluting the environment, I don\u2019t just desire not to pollute --\nI also applaud others who are averse to it and dislike those who fail\nto share my desire (Blackburn 2002: 125). When I morally disapprove of\nsomething, I also have these higher-order attitudes towards my own\nattitudes: I prefer not to prefer what I disapprove of, which explains\na defeasible link to motivation.\n\nGibbard (1990), in turn, identifies narrowly moral judgments with\njudgments about the rationality of guilt and resentment. To think that\nstealing is wrong, for example, is to think it rational to feel guilt\nfor stealing and resent others for stealing (in the absence of\nconditions like ignorance or force that excuse the agent). To think\nthat something is rational or makes sense, in turn, is to accept norms\nthat permit it. On Gibbard\u2019s original account, norm-acceptance\nis a basic kind of non-cognitive state, an evolutionary adaptation for\nlinguistically achieved coordination that is not analyzable in terms\nof other attitudes (1990: ch. 4). It is non-cognitive, because it is\nessentially a motivational tendency to act or feel in ways that we are\nprepared to avow in discussion about what to do. In later work, he\nconsiders normative thoughts as contingency plans that settle\nwhat to do in actual and non-actual situations (Gibbard 2003). These\nthoughts are defeasibly motivating, just as the Argument from\nInternalism requires.\n3.2 Expressivism\n\nThe above argument concerns moral judgment as a psychological state, a\nkind of thought. But the term \u2018judgment\u2019 is sometimes also\nused for linguistic utterances. Likewise, the term\n\u2018non-cognitivism\u2019 is also used for a thesis about moral\nlanguage. To minimize confusion, this entry will talk about moral\nterms, utterances, and sentences when it comes to linguistic entities,\nand reserve the term \u2018expressivism\u2019 for the linguistic\nthesis. Bearing these terminological stipulations in mind, any\nargument for non-cognitivism can be extended to an argument for\nexpressivism with the addition of some deceptively simple\npremises:\n\nThe meaning of a sentence is determined by the mental state it\nexpresses. (Metasemantic Psychologism)\nMoral sentences express moral judgments.\nSo, moral sentences express (at least in part) non-cognitive\npsychological states.\nSo, the meaning of moral sentences is determined (at least in\npart) by non-cognitive psychological states.\n\n\nPremise 4 is the key addition. It is not the only way to arrive at a\nbroadly expressivist theory in ethics \u2013 earlier forms, such as\nemotivism (Ayer 1936; Stevenson 1944) and universal prescriptivism\n(Hare 1952) relied on the problematic assumption that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be understood on the basis of the effects it is used to\nachieve or the speech act it is used to perform. Metasemantic\nPsychologism doesn\u2019t make this assumption, but simply derives\nthe meaning of linguistic expressions from the thoughts that they\nexpress, rather than their truth-conditions or the possible worlds\nthey rule out, as standard semantics does (Gibbard 1990: 92)\n\nIt is essential to understanding expressivism that expressing\na thought is not the same thing as reporting a thought\n\u2013 when I say \u201cThe sun is shining\u201d, I\nexpress my belief that the sun is shining, rather than\nreporting it, for which I\u2019d have to say \u201cI\nbelieve that the sun is shining.\u201d Mark Schroeder (2010) has\nrecently emphasized that the core expressivist claim is that the\nsentence \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d is related to disapproval of\nmurder in just the same way as the sentence \u201cThe sun is\nshining\u201d is related to the belief that the sun is shining,\nwhatever that is. The only difference is that the expressed state is\nnon-descriptive. This has significant semantic consequences, to be\nsure. Famously, since non-descriptive states lack truth-conditions,\n(pure) expressivists cannot explain the inferential relations among\nthem in the usual way, but rather in terms of agreement or\ndisagreement in attitudes (Stevenson 1937, Gibbard 2003). Attempts to\ndo so have proven controversial, to say the least. For discussion, see\nthe entry on\n Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism.\n\nAlthough it is definitive of expressivism that the meanings of moral\nsentences are explained without appealing to their truth-conditions,\nit is important to note that contemporary expressivists do not deny\nthat it makes sense to talk about moral truth or even moral facts. But\nfor them, doing so is just a different way of expressing first-order\nethical views. As Blackburn puts it:\n\n\nTo say that an ethical view is true is just to reaffirm it, and so it\nis if we add the weighty words \u2018really\u2019,\n\u2018true\u2019, \u2018fact\u2019, and so on. To say that it is\nobjectively true is to affirm that its truth does not vary with what\nwe happen to think about it, and once more this is an internal,\nfirst-order ethical position. (Blackburn 1998: 296)\n\n\nMaking sense of the action-guiding character of moral language is not,\nof course, the only motivation for expressivism. Another important\npart of the case for it is the Argument from Moral Supervenience,\noriginally made by Blackburn (1971; 1985), which claims, roughly, that\nexpressivists can best explain why it is a conceptual truth that\ndescriptively identical worlds must be morally identical. For more,\nsee the entry on\n Supervenience in Ethics.\n3.3 Cognitivist Sentimentalism: Subjectivism and Ideal Dispositionalism\n\nSentimentalists need not think that moral judgments just are\nsentiments or attitudes of some sort. Cognitivist sentimentalists\nthink they are descriptive beliefs about sentiments or the\ndisposition to cause sentiments. (I\u2019ll explore further varieties\nbelow.) The related semantic view is that moral sentences are about\nthe speaker\u2019s (or someone else\u2019s) sentiments or\ndispositions to cause sentiments.\n\nThe simplest semantic account along these lines is Speaker\nSubjectivism, according to which the truth condition of an\nutterance of \u201cStealing is wrong\u201d is that the speaker\ndisapproves of stealing. This disapproval need not consist simply in a\nnegative sentiment towards stealing, but may also be thought of as\nendorsement of a moral standard or norm that prohibits stealing. In\nother words, the speaker reports the same attitude that\nexpressivists say the sentence expresses. This view is\nsuggested by some things that Hume says, in particular the\nfollowing:\n\n\n[W]hen you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean\nnothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a\nfeeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. (T\n469)\n\n\nFor Speaker Subjectivism, there is a non-cognitive element to moral\njudgment, but moral sentences can nevertheless be given standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Its attraction is thus making sense of\njudgment internalism without the need for non-standard semantics or\nmetasemantics. A generalized version of Speaker Subjectivism is\nMetaethical Contextualism, according to which the standard\nrelative to which something is said to be right or wrong need not be\nthe speaker\u2019s own, but is instead determined by the context of\nutterance, in something like the way that the context fixes the\ncontent of a tacitly indexical sentence like \u201cZheng is\ntall\u201d (Dreier 1990; Bj\u00f6rnsson and Finlay 2010). So just\nlike in uttering \u201cZheng is tall\u201d, we might say that Zheng\nis tall for a child, in uttering \u201cStealing is\nwrong\u201d we might say that stealing is wrong by the standards\nyou and I accept, for example.\n\nA basic objection to these views is the Missing Disagreement Problem\n(Moore 1912). Suppose that Ann says \u201cEating people is\nwrong\u201d and Beth, a committed cannibal, replies \u201cNo, eating\npeople is not wrong.\u201d According to simple Speaker Subjectivism,\nwhat Ann said is true if and only if Ann disapproves of eating people,\nand what Beth said is true if and only if Beth doesn\u2019t\ndisapprove of eating people. It can obviously be simultaneously true\nthat Ann disapproves of eating people and Beth doesn\u2019t, so their\nutterances don\u2019t contradict each other. Indeed, since what Ann\nsays is true on this picture, it looks like it should be possible for\nBeth to say \u201cWhat Ann says is true, but eating people is not\nwrong\u201d. So it seems they don\u2019t disagree any more than if\nAnn had said \u201cMy name begins with an A\u201d and Beth had said\n\u201cNo, my name begins with a B\u201d. Yet they do, so Speaker\nSubjectivism has a problem.\n\nContemporary subjectivists and contextualists are well aware of this\nproblem and offer various suggestions to solve it. For example,\nGilbert Harman\u2019s pragmatist response holds that when we say that\nsomething is wrong, we presuppose that the hearer shares our\nmoral standards (Harman 2000: 36). Our conversation is about what\nfollows from our standard, which is something something about which we\ncan genuinely disagree.\n\nWhatever we otherwise make of Harman\u2019s suggestion, the pragmatic\nstrategy appears to unduly restrict the scope of possible\ndisagreement, since it is possible to disagree with people who are not\npart of the conversation (Bj\u00f6rnsson and Finlay 2010). In\nresponse, subjectivists and contextualists sometimes give up the\nnotion that disagreement consists of contradictory beliefs, and\naccount for it in terms of the originally non-cognitivist notion of\ndisagreement in attitude (e.g. Finlay 2017). Assume, for\nsimplicity, that disapproval involves desire to have the agent\npunished, and approval a desire not to have the agent punished. Then,\neven if Ann\u2019s and Beth\u2019s utterances don\u2019t contradict\none another, they disagree in the sense that it is not possible to\nsimultaneously satisfy the desires entailed by the truth of their\nsincere utterances when they issue a verdict on cannibalism. If Ann\ngets her way, Beth doesn\u2019t, and vice versa.\n\nAnother question for Speaker Subjectivism is that the subject matter\nof the moral thought is not distinctively evaluative: if Ellen is a\nPresbyterian and thinks that stealing is wrong, the content of\nEllen\u2019s thought might be just that stealing is such as to arouse\ndisapproval in Presbyterians. Someone else could have a thought with\nthe same content without thereby making a moral evaluation of stealing\n(Egan 2012: 566). The evaluative aspect is external to the\nbelief, and consists rather in something like identifying as a\nPresbyterian, which involves a desire-like attitude towards avoiding\nthings that don\u2019t fit the Presbyterian moral code. Consequently,\nthere is no commitment to a distinct kind of evaluative fact. In Jamie\nDreier\u2019s (2009) view, this is an advantage rather than a problem\nfor the account.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views evade problems with Speaker\nSubjectivism with two moves. The first is idealization: the beliefs\nand sentences refer not to the speaker\u2019s views, but to those of\na suitably idealized subject (perhaps an idealized version of\nthe speaker). At the level of logical form, ought claims may have a\ntacit argument place for a standard, just as for contextualists\n\u2013 but the standard is context-invariant. The second is\ndispositionalization: the reference is not to anyone\u2019s actual\nsentiments, but to sentiments they would have in suitable\ncircumstances. Suggestions of this type of view can be found in Hume\nand Smith \u2013 recall their talk of correcting our\nsentiments by reference to the common point of view or the impartial\nspectator\u2019s response. Roderick Firth\u2019s (1952) Ideal\nObserver Theory is a more contemporary variant of this kind of\nview. In general form, it is as follows:\n\n\nTo judge that X has a moral property is to believe that any\nideal observer would have an ethically significant reaction to\nX in conditions ideal for doing so.\n\n\nBy an \u2018ethically significant reaction\u2019 Firth means\n\n\nthe kind of moral experience which we take to be evidence, under ideal\nconditions, for the truth of our ethical judgments. (Firth 1952:\n326)\n\n\nHe leaves it open whether the reaction is sentimental, so there are\npossible variants of Ideal Observer Theory that are not\nsentimentalist. In specifying the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver, Firth uses a \u2018pragmatic methodology\u2019 of\n\n\nexamining the procedures which we actually regard, implicitly or\nexplicitly, as the rational ones for deciding ethical questions.\n(ibid. 332)\n\n\nIf we actually disqualify someone\u2019s ethical verdicts because of\nignorance of non-moral facts, failure to vividly imagine what\nsomething would actually be like, partiality, non-moral emotions, and\ninconsistency, this shows that we implicitly regard moral judgements\nas valid only when made by an omniscient, omnipercipient, impartial,\ndispassionate, consistent, but otherwise normal judge (ibid.\n333\u2013345). These are then the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views avoid the Missing Disagreement Problem.\nFor example, if Ann believes that any informed impartial spectator\nwould disapprove of X and Beth believes it\u2019s not the\ncase that any informed impartial spectator would not disapprove of\nX, their beliefs contradict each other and they\nstraightforwardly disagree.\n\nHowever, this victory for idealized views is achieved by detachment\nfrom people\u2019s own actual attitudes, which leads to the Missing\nMotivation Problem. The attraction that simple subjectivism,\ncontextualism, and non-cognitivism share is that if moral thoughts\nconsist in attitudes or beliefs about standards one endorses, their\nputative non-contingent connection to motivation is unproblematic. But\nhow could beliefs about dispositions to cause sentimental\nresponses in ideal subjects necessarily motivate ordinary thinkers,\ngiven the Humean Theory of Motivation (Mackie 1980: 69)? Some might\nhave the desire to do what an impartial spectator would approve of,\nbut what about those who don\u2019t? As Richard Joyce (2013) has put\nit, it appears that one may be just as unmoved by such thoughts as by\nthe belief that drunken Vikings would mock the performance of an\naction, and quite rationally so.\n\nMichael Smith (1994; 1997) offers a distinctively rationalist\nresponse to this challenge by appealing to the idea that an agent is\nmore rational in the sense of coherence if she is motivated to do what\nshe believes her ideally rational and informed advisor would want her\nto do. It merits further exploration whether a sentimentalist view\ncould make a similar move. For example, an Adam Smithian suggestion\nwould be that an agent who believes that any impartial spectator would\ndesire her to do A and fails to desire to A is less\ncoherent than one who combines the belief with a desire to A.\nThis assumes that our beliefs about an ideal spectator\u2019s\nattitudes are inherently authoritative for us (and hence unlike\nbeliefs about Vikings), as Smith indeed thinks.\n3.4 Cognitivist Sentimentalism: Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n\nThe cognitivist sentimentalist views discussed in the previous section\nappealed to beliefs about dispositions to cause sentimental\nresponses in certain kind of subjects. The other main type of\ncognitivist view, sensibility theory, regards judgments as\nbeliefs about merited responses (Wiggins 1987; McDowell\n1998). Sensibility theory begins with an analogy with secondary\nquality concepts, such as colour concepts. These concepts, according\nto many, are concepts of mind-dependent qualities. Sensibility\ntheorists believe they are partially analogous with value concepts,\nthe difference being that value is\n\n\nconceived to be not merely such as to elicit the appropriate\n\u2018attitude\u2019 \u2026 but rather such as to merit\nit. (McDowell 1985: 143)\n\n\nWhen we conceive of value in this way, we perceive there to be a\nreason for, say, admiring or emulating someone (McDowell\n1979).\n\nThis state of perceiving or conceiving of there being a reason is a\nbelief of a unique and controversial sort. According to John McDowell\n(1978), it can explain a virtuous person\u2019s action without the\nhelp of a related desire playing a causal role (although we can\nrightly attribute a desire to a person as a consequence of\ntheir being motivated by the perception of a reason). McDowell thus\nrejects the Humean Theory of Motivation\n (premise 2\n in the Argument from Internalism). His arguments are inspired by his\nreading of Aristotle rather than the Early Modern sentimentalist\ntradition. Roughly, a virtuous person sees situations in a distinctive\nway (McDowell 1979: 73), so that certain features, like\nsomeone\u2019s need to know something, are salient to her,\nwhile other concerns are silenced, and thus do not stand out\nas calling for action. This \u2018moral vision\u2019 (Murdoch 1970)\nthen suffices to explain what the agent does.\n\nA familiar objection is that it is possible for someone to share the\nvirtuous person\u2019s belief or \u201cconception of the\nsituation\u201d but nevertheless lack the motivation. McDowell denies\nthis:\n\n\n[T]he relevant conceptions are not so much as possessed except by\nthose whose wills are influenced appropriately. (McDowell 1978:\n87)\n\n\nOne argument in favour of this is that there is a difference between\nbeing virtuous and being continent. Both kinds of agents do the right\nthing \u2013 for example, both remain faithful to their partner. But\nthe continent agent has to struggle with competing desires that cloud\ntheir attention on the noble and the fine. She has to muster willpower\nto keep from temptation. The difference between her and the virtuous\nperson, on this picture, is not in the first instance a conative one,\nbut a difference in what is salient, which is simultaneously a\ncognitive and affective difference. In David McNaughton\u2019s terms,\n\u201ca way of seeing a situation may itself be a way of caring or\nfeeling\u201d (McNaughton 1988: 113). A consequence of this view is\nthat the process of coming to appreciate practical reasons will\ninvolve shaping the agent\u2019s motivational sensitivities and may\nitself be akin to a non-rational conversion rather than to rational\ndeliberation from existing motives (McDowell 1995: 100\u2013101).\n\nSensibility theories belong in the category Justin D\u2019Arms and\nDaniel Jacobson (2000a) have labelled neo-sentimentalism. It\nis, officially, the view that evaluative concepts are\nconcepts of appropriateness of sentimental responses. (As will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.3,\n neo-sentimentalists often make related metaphysical claims about\nevaluative properties.) That is, to think that something is\nshameful is to think that shame is appropriate or that there is\nsufficient reason for it. A key motivation for neo-sentimentalism is\nthat making a judgment about desirability or shamefulness is distinct\nfrom desiring or being ashamed. The point of using and introducing\nnormative concepts is to guide our attitudes rather than just\nexpress or report them. (See the entry on\n Fitting Attitude Theories of Value.)\n3.5 Hybrid and Pluralist Approaches\n\nHybrid theories solve the problem of fitting together the\nrepresentational and practical aspects of moral judgment by arguing\nthat both cognitive and non-cognitive states are in play somehow:\nmoral judgments have both a sentimental and a non-sentimental aspect.\nSeveral options have been explored recently, including hybrid\nexpressivism, hybrid state theories, and moral thought pluralism,\nwhich will be discussed below.\n\nHybrid expressivism comes in many varieties. Perhaps the\nbest-known is Michael Ridge\u2019s \u2018ecumenical\nexpressivism\u2019 (Ridge 2006). Take the judgment that I must tell\nthe truth to the judge. As a first approximation, such judgment\nconsists in approval of actions of a certain kind, and the belief that\ntelling the truth to the judge is an action of that kind (cf. Barker\n2000). Maybe I approve of actions that maximize utility, and believe\nthat telling the truth to the judge maximizes utility. For Ridge\n(2014), the non-cognitive element is embracing a normative perspective\nthat admits a set of standards as authoritative for practical\nreasoning (in this case, a utilitarian one), and the cognitive one an\nordinary belief to the effect that those standards require telling the\ntruth.\n\nRidge argues that this type of view accounts for the attractions of\nnon-cognitivism, chiefly avoiding problematic ontological commitment\nto non-deflationary moral facts and explaining practicality. When they\nhave a normative perspective that involves a desire-like attitude\ntowards what they believe to be required by certain standards,\npractically rational agents form an instrumental desire to perform\nsuch actions. The cognitive element of the judgment, in turn, serves\nto explain the compositionality and inferential features of moral\nlanguage in the familiar truth-conditional fashion. For other versions\nof expressivism that involve expressing suitably related desire-like\nstates and beliefs, see especially Boisvert (2008), Toppinen (2013),\nand Schroeder (2013), and Fletcher and Ridge (eds.) (2014).\n\nJesse Prinz\u2019s (2007) account of moral judgment can be classified\nas a hybrid state theory. The key to his view is his theory\nof emotions (Prinz 2004), according to which they are perceptions of\npatterns of bodily changes that represent what they are \u201cset up\nto be set off by\u201d \u2013 what it is their function to detect\n\u2013 just the same way as any other psychological states do on\nteleological theories of representation. For Prinz, a moral\nsentiment is a disposition to respond to certain actions with\na range of self- and other-directed blame- or praise-constituting\nemotions, such as guilt, contempt, anger, and gratitude. A moral\njudgment consists in the emotion that results from activating\na sentiment, such as anger at stealing or shame for fleeing. The anger\nrepresents stealing as being such as to cause disapprobation in the\njudge \u2013 that is, as morally wrong, according to Prinz\u2019s\nrelativist moral metaphysics\n (see Section 4.1).\n This means the judgment can be true or false (relative to a judge).\nIt also motivates punishing the agent. Other emotions, and hence\njudgments, have different motivational effects \u2013 disgust may\nmotivate to avoid the agent instead. An evident challenge to this view\nis thus the seeming possibility of our making non-emotional moral\njudgments, as well as having non-judgmental moral emotions.\n\nFinally, moral thought pluralism, according to which\ndifferent moral thoughts are constituted by different kinds of\npsychological state, is a very new approach, although Elizabeth\nRadcliffe (2006) argues that already Hume distinguished between two\nkinds of moral thought. Linda Zagzebski (2003) and Uriah Kriegel\n(2012) argue in different ways that there are two kinds of moral\njudgment, one of which contains an affective element. Kriegel\u2019s\nsuggestion is that moral judgments that result from automatic,\nnon-conscious Type I processes consist in what Tamar Gendler (2008)\nlabeled \u201caliefs\u201d, cognitive states that affect our\nbehavior even if they go against our conscious judgments. Moral\njudgments that result from conscious, effortful Type II thought are\nfor Kriegel ordinary beliefs with an objectivist phenomenology. Since\nKriegel accepts that ordinary beliefs don\u2019t motivate on their\nown, on his view internalism is true only of moral aliefs. (For\nskepticism about aliefs, see Sinhababu 2017: 129\u2013134.)\n\nIn a similar vein, Kauppinen (2013; 2015) distinguishes between moral\nintuitions or appearances, which are constituted by\n(typically emotional) manifestations of sentiments we expect others to\nshare, and moral judgments, which are (implicitly) beliefs\nabout what would be permitted, required, or recommended by standards\nan ideal subject would endorse. As with other appearances, the\nexistence of moral thoughts that are not judgments is clearest in\ncases in which they clash with judgment, such as when it appears to\nHuck Finn that it is wrong to reveal where Jim is, though he believes\nhe ought to do so. Kauppinen maintains that moral seemings have a\ndistinctive and diverse phenomenological and motivational character\n(in contrast to, say, mathematical intuitions), which is best\nexplained by their being sentimental in nature. Motivational\ninternalism is thus true of moral appearances, as Kriegel holds for\nmoral alief.\n\nOne important contrast with Kriegel is that for Kauppinen, moral\nappearances are not themselves judgments, but explain and potentially\njustify moral beliefs. Moral appearances are thus taken to be in this\nrespect parallel to perceptual appearances \u2013 non-doxastic states\nthat attract assent to their propositional contents\n (see Section 5.1).\n (Graham Oddie (2005) defends a view according to which\ndesires constitute appearances of value, and play a similar\nepistemic role.) Since appearances often cause moral beliefs, the two\nkinds of thought often co-occur. But moral beliefs can be arrived at\nand held independently of moral appearances. This accounts for the\nforce of motivational externalist objections and the possibility of\namoralism (though on Kauppinen\u2019s view, fully competent moral\nagents are motivationally and deliberatively sensitive to beliefs with\nsuch contents). Since the beliefs expressed by moral judgments are\nordinary descriptive ones, there is no need for a separate moral\nsemantics. Pluralist views thus split the difference between\nnon-cognitivist and cognitivist sentimentalism: each is, broadly\nspeaking, true of one important kind of moral thought (in contrast to\nhybrid views, according to which each thought has both\nnon-cognitive and cognitive elements).\n4. Metaphysical Sentimentalism\n\nIt is an appealing thought that moral (and other evaluative) facts and\nproperties are not just brutely out there independently of human\nthought and sensibility. Take the evaluative property of being funny.\nHow could something be funny, if no human being was ever amused by it?\nHow could something be outrageous if it failed to generate any outrage\nwhen known about, even in those who care about the victim? For\nsentimentalists, value, including moral value, is\nanthropocentric (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2006).\n\nSentimentalists agree with error theorists that sui generis,\nnon-natural moral facts would be queer, and that mind-independent\nnatural facts are unfit for the role of moral facts. Non-cognitivist\njudgment sentimentalists treat moral facts as projections of\nmoral attitudes. Although there is excellent reason to think Hume\nwasn\u2019t a projectivist, he gave one of the classic formulations\nin saying that taste\n\n\nhas a productive faculty, and gilding and staining all natural\nobjects, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises in a manner a new\ncreation. (1751: 88)\n\n\nWe take a sentimental response in ourselves, say envy, and attribute\nto the worldly object a feature it doesn\u2019t really have, such as\nbeing enviable.\n\nError theorists treat this projection as much the same as the\nattribution of agency to planets in some cultures: a predictable false\nbelief. Contemporary expressivists, in contrast, believe that\nattribution of moral facts and properties serves a purpose. It enables\nus to express our commitments in a way that provides a focal point for\ndisagreement and debate. As discussed above, on deflationary views of\ntruth and facts, it is a first-order question whether some attribution\nis in error or not (Blackburn 1998).\n\nMost interestingly for moral metaphysics, many cognitivist judgment\nsentimentalists think that moral judgments refer to moral and\nevaluative facts that are metaphysically determined by some sort of\nsentimental responses. According to such views, moral properties are\nresponse-dependent in one way or another. For more, see the\n Response-Dependence Supplement.\n4.1 Subjectivism and Relativism\n\nThe simplest way to link moral properties with our emotional or\nconative responses would be to say that what makes something wrong is\nthat it is disapproved of, or bad that it is not desired. No one holds\na view this elementary, since it entails that an undetected murder\nisn\u2019t morally wrong, for example. It also leaves undetermined\nwhose disapproval is at issue \u2013 what if one person disapproves\nof an action but someone else approves? What I\u2019ll call Simple\nDispositionalist Subjectivism improves on it by indexing moral\nproperties to subjects and referring to dispositions to cause\nresponses rather than actual responses. What makes something\nwrong-for-Mary, for example, is that Mary would disapprove of it, were\nshe aware of it. A related relativist proposal is that something is\nwrong-for-Mary if and only if Mary accepts a normative standard or\nframework that prohibits it (Harman 1975).\n\nThus, according to Jesse Prinz,\n\n\nAn action has the property of being morally wrong (right) just in case\nthere is an observer who has a sentiment of disapprobation\n(approbation) toward it. (Prinz 2007: 92)\n\n\n(Recall that for Prinz a sentiment is a disposition to feel\nvarious emotions, so wrongness doesn\u2019t hang on someone actually\nhaving a negative reaction to something.) But this claim is highly\nimplausible, given that wrongness is unindexed. It is true of almost\nanything that someone will disapprove of it, and someone else will\napprove of it. Thus, female genital cutting, for example, is\nsimultaneously both (absolutely) right and wrong. This is a\nsteep theoretical cost.\n\nSimple Dispositionalist Subjectivism seems to entail that if we were\nto begin to approve of slavery, slavery would come to be morally right\n\u2013 it would be true that we would respond to it positively when\nencountering it, say. But surely the correct description of such a\nscenario would not be that slavery has become right, but that we have\nbecome worse people (Broad 1944/5: 151). I call this the Missing\nRigidity Problem. The Missing Fallibility Problem, in\nturn, is that a simple subjectivist view seems to leave insufficient\nroom for mistakes about value. If what\u2019s right is\ndetermined by what I approve, I can only be mistaken about\nwhat\u2019s right if I\u2019m mistaken about what I in fact approve.\nBut it is very implausible that the remedy for moral mistakes is\nbetter introspection.\n4.2 Ideal Dispositionalism\n\nParalleling the case of moral judgment, problems with Simple\nSubjectivism motivate a move to Ideal Dispositionalism. According to\nthis type of view, the extension of moral or evaluative properties is\ndetermined by the sentimental responses of idealized subjects of some\nsort, or responses under idealized conditions. Consequently, the\nMissing Fallibility Problem is handily skirted: we can no doubt be\nmistaken about what an ideal observer would approve.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views also avoid the Missing Rigidity Problem.\nDepending on the details, it may suffice to idealize the subject of\nthe sentiments: maybe no impartial spectator would approve of slavery,\neven if the majority of people were to have a pro-slavery sensibility.\nIn case the idealization process is path-dependent (so that the\noutcome depends on the unidealized initial sentiments of the subject),\nIdeal Dispositionalists may make a rigidification move (Wiggins 1987:\n206). They can say that the starting point for idealization is\nconstituted by actually normal sentiments, which include a\nstrong desire not to be at the mercy of the good will of others, among\nothers. Thus, rigidified ideal observers would disapprove of slavery,\neven if it became statistically normal to approve of it. Peter Railton\n(2003) objects to rigidification, because for him what is\nintrinsically good or bad for someone is relational,\ndependent on the match between their responses and their objects, much\nas sweetness and bitterness are. Changes in people\u2019s\nsensibilities would change what\u2019s good (or sweet) for\nthem. Still, something like cruelty wouldn\u2019t become right even\nif it were generally approved of, since for Railton, its wrongness\nhangs on badness of its consequences rather than our disapproval of\nit, and pain that people are averse to would still be bad for\nthem.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalism comes in several varieties, which often\ncorrespond to views about the content of moral judgment (Firth 1952;\nLewis 1989; Smith 1994). Even if they avoid problems with fallibility\nand rigidity, there are a number of further challenges. Four will be\ndiscussed here.\n\nFirst, the Euthyphro Dilemma derives its name from the Platonic\ndialogue in which Socrates argues against a version of Divine Command\ntheory. Applied to ideal dispositionalism, it can be presented as\nfollows:\n\nA subjectivist theory defines the subject whose responses\ndetermine the extension of evaluative properties either in evaluative\nterms, whose application presupposes mind-independent evaluative\ntruths, or in non-evaluative terms.\nIf the subject is defined in evaluative terms, the theory\ncollapses into mind-independent realism: it presupposes the existence\nof at least some mind-independent evaluative truths.\nIf the subject is defined in non-evaluative terms, her responses\nwill be morally arbitrary and lacking in authority to determine the\nextension of evaluative properties.\nSo, a subjectivist theory is either self-defeating (because of\ncollapse into realism) or false (because of yielding arbitrary\nextensions for moral properties).\n\n\nIt is clear that subjectivist accounts with any kind of reductive\nambition cannot embrace the first horn of the dilemma (see below for\nnon-reductivist accounts). So it is the second horn that they must\nface. What exactly is the problem with it? According to Russ\nShafer-Landau, it is that\n\n\nit may be impossible to craft a set of [non-evaluative] constraints on\nattitude formation such that the emerging attitudes yield\nprescriptions that match up with our views about what constitutes\nparadigmatically moral and immoral behaviour (Shafer-Landau 2003:\n41)\n\n\nThe challenge is that ideal observers, when defined in non-evaluative\nterms, might approve of bad things, like ethnic cleansing, which would\ncounterintuitively entail that ethnic cleansing would be morally\nright. However, Shafer-Landau admits that there is no knock-down\nargument to the effect that any idealization in non-evaluative terms\nwill yield counterintuitive results.\n\nPerhaps the real challenge that the Euthyphro poses concerns the\nnormative authority of the responses of any kind of\nsubject defined in non-evaluative terms. One way to develop this\nchallenge may be called the Missing Normativity Problem. Many\nbelieve that moral rightness or wrongness are categorically\nreason-giving features of actions. Everyone, regardless of their\ninterests and desires, has a reason to refrain from morally wrong\nbehaviour. Suppose, then, that to be wrong is to be such as to be\ndisapproved of by any ideal observer. On a reductivist view, this is a\nnatural property of the action, specified in non-normative terms. The\nchallenge is: why would such a natural property be categorically\nreason-giving? Why should people care about doing only things that\nwould not be disapproved of by a hypothetical spectator?\n\nAs Mark Johnston puts it,\n\n\nTo say that something would be valued under condition K is\nnot thereby to commend it, but only to make a descriptive remark about\nits relation to certain psychological conditions. (Johnston 1989: 157;\ncf. Blackburn 1993: 274)\n\n\nThese challenges may be ways of spelling out the force of G. E.\nMoore\u2019s (1903) famous Open Question Argument: since it makes\nsense to grant that some X would be disapproved of by any\nimpartial, informed, but otherwise normal observer, but nevertheless\ndeny that X is morally wrong, there is reason to think that\nbeing disapproved of by an ideal observer is not the same thing as\nbeing morally wrong. To be sure, the Open Question Argument is\ncontentious, and there are a number of standard responses: perhaps the\nidentity of the properties is a posteriori, like that of\nwater and H2O (Brink 1989), or perhaps it is an unobvious\nconceptual truth that we can read off the platitudes surrounding our\nconcepts (Smith 1994). (See the entry on\n moral naturalism.)\n\nThe third issue is the Indeterminacy Problem. Given a characterisation\nof an ideal observer, is there really such a thing as an action that\nwould be approved of by any ideal observer, given divergence\nin pre-idealization attitudes? (Brandt 1955: 408) If ideal observers\ndisagree, there is, according to the theory, no fact of the matter.\nThis problem derives from an essential feature of idealized\ndispositional theories: the idealization begins from what people are\nactually like, and the process may not guarantee convergence in the\nrelevant respects.\n\nFinally, the Unmotivated Idealization Problem is that it is not\nobvious that the move from actual responses or dispositions to ideal\ndispositions has a rationale that is consistent with the core ideas of\nresponse-dependence theory. David Enoch (2005) has recently made a\nforceful case for this problem. He notes that if there are\nresponse-independent facts, it makes good sense to privilege responses\nof certain kind of subjects in certain conditions, because such\nfeatures of subjects and conditions are conducive to tracking the\nresponse-independent facts. But that option is obviously closed for\nthe ideal dispositionalist.\n\nEnoch claims that there is no real alternative rationale that is not\nad hoc or that doesn\u2019t tacitly rely on response-independent\nrealism. For example, appealing to our actual justificatory practice,\nin which we may privilege responses under full imaginative\nacquaintance, for example, is not an option, since that practice is\nitself best explained by the underlying assumption that there are\nmind-independent moral facts (Enoch 2005: 774). However, Hume might\nobject that the rationale for stepping back from our actual\nsentimental responses is avoiding \u201ccontinual contradictions in\nsociety and conversation\u201d and other practical problems\n (see Section 2.2).\n If this is right, our actual justificatory practice and the\nprivileged place it gives to reflectively corrected responses thus has\nan explanation and rationale that do not presuppose mind-independent\nevaluative facts. In this vein, Kauppinen (2014b, 580) holds that\n\u201cAn evaluative perspective is ideal or optimal when adopting it\nmost reliably avoids the practical problems caused by the uncorrected\nattitudes\u201d. (See also Sobel 2009.)\n4.3 Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n\nFor sensibility theories, an evaluative property is not a disposition\nto cause responses in us, but the property of\nmeriting a response from us. A sensibility theory version of\nthe response-dependence equation looks like this:\n\n\nX is M if and only if X merits\nR / any virtuous subject S would respond to\nX with R in ideal circumstances\n\n\nIt is an obvious and familiar complaint against views of this type\nthat the analysis is uninformative. After all, normative\nterms occur on both sides of the equation: the right-hand side refers\nto meriting and virtuous subjects. There is no\nattempt to reduce evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones.\nNeither responses nor properties have metaphysical priority, but are\ninstead \u201csiblings\u201d (McDowell 1987). One argument in favour\nof this is the claim that the relevant response cannot be identified\nindependently of the (concept of the) property (Wiggins 1987: 195).\nSensibility theorists nevertheless claim that the non-reductive\nelucidation offers an advantage over primary quality views, according\nto which moral properties have no essential relation to us (see Cuneo\n2001 for a response).\n\nSensibility theories are a species of what is often called a Fitting\nAttitudes (FA) Analysis of value (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). The general form of an FA analysis is\nthe following:\n\n\nX is E if and only if, and because, R is an\nappropriate or fitting response to X /\nthere is sufficient reason to respond to X with\nR.\n\n\nThe \u2018because\u2019 indicates that the direction of metaphysical\nexplanation is from fittingness of attitudes to the property, and not\nthe other way: something is good because it is fitting to desire it,\nand not fitting to desire because it is good. This rules out views on\nwhich value and fitting attitudes go together, but claim that it is\nvalue that makes the attitude fitting and not vice versa. Some\nidentify FA analyses with neo-sentimentalism, but this is a\ntheoretically unhelpful classification, since many forms of FA\nanalysis regard the appropriateness or fittingness of attitudes itself\nas either a mind-independent normative fact that can be intellectually\nintuited (such as Ewing 1948) or as a truth determined by what would\nbe rationally or reasonably accepted (such as Scanlon 1998). These FA\nviews thus significantly depart from the key motivations for\nsentimentalism, and are better classified as FA variants of\nnon-naturalism and constructivism.\n\nThe specific features of sentimentalist FA analyses come out most\nnotably in the responses that sentimentalists can give to the\nmetaphysical echo of the Conflation Problem, namely the Wrong Kind of\nReasons problem. This is the problem that what makes a response\nappropriate or gives sufficient reason for it may be something that\nhas nothing to do with the relevant value. If an evil demon threatens\nto smite you unless you admire it for its threat, you may have\nsufficient reason to admire the demon (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). But that doesn\u2019t mean the demon\nis admirable \u2013 quite the contrary. In the jargon, admiration is\nnot a fitting response to the demon, since it is appropriate\nfor the wrong kind of reason.\n\nThere are various proposals to distinguish between right and wrong\nkinds of reasons for attitudes, not all of which are sentimentalist\n(e.g., Parfit 2011). Justin D\u2019Arms and Daniel Jacobson (2000b)\npresent a distinctively sentimentalist alternative. Their piecemeal\nsolution appeals to alethic standards of correctness derived\nfrom the content of the attitude in question. Assuming that an emotion\nhas a cognitive component that presents or construes things as being\nin a certain way\n (see Section 5.1),\n it can be either accurate or inaccurate, depending on whether things\nare that way. The right kind of reasons for or against the attitude\nare those that bear on its accuracy. As they put it,\n\n\nAn emotional episode presents its object as having certain evaluative\nfeatures; it is unfitting \u2026 when its object lacks those\nfeatures. (2000b: 73)\n\n\nThe example D\u2019Arms and Jacobson use is envy. According to them,\nit (broadly speaking) presents a rival in a negative light in virtue\nof having a desirable possession. The right kind of reasons bearing on\nwhether a rival is enviable are thus those that have to do with what\nshe possesses and its desirability relative to what you have. If a\ncolleague gets a promotion you wanted, envy may be fitting in this\nsense, and consequently, given a fitting attitudes account of\nevaluative properties, the colleague will be enviable. This is the\ncase even if envy is morally or prudentially inappropriate \u2013 the\nlatter kind of reasons do not bear on the fittingness of envy.\n\nAn alternative development of the same sort of idea can be found in\nChristine Tappolet\u2019s (2016) recent work. Tappolet holds that\ninstead of formulating fittingness in terms of reasons or normative\nrequirements of any kind, neo-sentimentalists can simply hold that,\nsay, Pierre is admirable, if and only if admiration is\ncorrect in response to Pierre when contemplating him (2016:\n87). Here correctness is a non-normative notion akin to truth:\nemotions present things as being in a certain way, and they are\ncorrect when things are indeed that way (see Section 5 for more\ndiscussion). Tappolet contrasts this kind of representational\nneo-sentimentalism with standard normative neo-sentimentalism.\nThe former, as such, has no reductive ambitions \u2013 it relates\nvalue properties to correct responses, but doesn\u2019t claim that\nPierre is admirable because it is correct to admire him. If\nanything, it is the other way around, which is why Tappolet thinks\nthat representational neo-sentimentalism is naturally paired with\nrealism about value (see also Oddie 2016). While normative\nneo-sentimentalists take reasons for valuing to be provided by the\nnon-evaluative properties of the target (which leaves open the\npossibility of reducing value to fitting attitudes), for Tappolet the\nreasons for evaluative attitudes are provided by values themselves.\nThe outstanding question for the standard neo-sentimentalist strategy\nis accounting for fittingness or reasons without assuming\nresponse-independent values. Representational neo-sentimentalism, on\nthe other hand, leaves emotions in a primarily epistemic role \u2013\nas Tappolet has it, part of what it is to possess evaluative concepts\nis to realize that they are canonically applied and justified on the\nbasis of emotional responses (2016: 99) (see again the discussion in\nthe next section).\n\nInterestingly, Adam Smith can be seen to offer a kind of naturalistic\nand sentimentalist account of fittingness in criticizing the\nintuitionist FA analyses of his time:\n\n\n[T]here are some modern systems, according to which virtue consists in\npropriety; or in the suitableness of the affection from which we act,\nto the cause or object which excites it \u2026 None of those systems\neither give, or even pretend to give, any precise or distinct measure\nby which this fitness or propriety of affection can be ascertained or\njudged of. That precise and distinct measure can be found nowhere but\nin the sympathetic feelings of the impartial and well-informed\nspectator. (TMS 346)\n\n\nA natural take on this is that Smith accepts the FA analysis that an\naction is wrong if and only if it is fitting to resent the agent for\nit, for example. But he then gives a distinctively sentimentalist cast\nto what it is for something to be fitting. This normative fact\nconsists in the response being endorsed by an impartial and\nwell-informed spectator (Kauppinen 2014b).\n5. Epistemic Sentimentalism\n\nEpistemic sentimentalists hold that (some) emotions are sources of\nmoral knowledge or at least justification. Many of them believe the\nstronger claim that emotional experiences are necessary for\ncoming to know basic moral truths, either because they are sources of\nfoundational justification or because justified moral beliefs must\ncohere with certain emotional experiences. They thus reject both\nintuitionist views, on which adequate understanding of self-evident\nmoral propositions suffices for justified belief (Audi 2013), and\nrationalist accounts according to which pure practical reason can\nyield moral knowledge. In the background are metaphysical and\nexplanatory arguments to the effect that moral truths aren\u2019t the\nsort of relations or facts that reasoning can discover (see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement).\n Note that this is not to deny that we can reason from basic\nmoral truths to derivative ones, or that non-moral reasoning\ncan\u2019t play a role in moral knowledge. Nor need sentimentalists\nclaim that knowledge of formal moral truths, like the transitivity of\nbetterness, is grounded in emotions.\n\nWhile epistemic sentimentalism has recently gained popularity,\nit\u2019s good to bear in mind that its main claim is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. It is a common thought that emotions can lead us\nastray in moral and prudential matters. We often come to realize\nretrospectively that we misconceived of a situation as a result of\nviewing it through the lens of jealousy, fear, or anger. It\u2019s\nnot just that emotions can lead us to act against our better judgment,\nbut they can result in false and unjustified evaluative beliefs.\n\nPhilosophers, too, have often seen emotions as epistemically\nproblematic. A very old thought that makes an appearance at least from\nPlato onwards is that they are disruptive in preventing and\nperverting rational consideration. To have this kind of effect,\nemotions need not have any cognitive content \u2013 they could just\nbe mental or bodily disturbances.\n\nMore interesting criticisms of emotion do grant that they have\ncognitive content, but maintain that they are nevertheless apt to\nmislead us. Within the Western tradition, it is the Stoics\nwho are perhaps the most famous for condemning ordinary emotions for\nthis reason. In the background was their value theory, according to\nwhich only virtue is good (and only vice bad), while worldly things\nlike illness or social success are indifferent (Long and Sedley 1987).\nSince for them, our ordinary emotions from sadness to anger and love\nare or involve judgments about the badness or goodness of worldly\nthings that are really indifferent, they are false evaluative\njudgments, or impressions to assent to false judgments. A\nstructurally similar picture is offered by Buddhists, who see\nespecially negative emotions as arising from desires for and\nattachments to things that are not of genuine worth (Flanagan\n2016).\n\nGiven these concerns with disruption and misleading, it is fair to say\nthat epistemic sentimentalists have a presumption to overcome. The\nnext sections examine some attempts to do so. The third subsection\ndiscusses the potential role of sentiments in epistemic contexts other\nthan basic justification, in particular in cases of moral\nunderstanding and the possibility of acquiring moral knowledge by\ntestimony.\n5.1 The Perceptual Model\n\nTalk of a moral sense suggests an epistemic picture according to which\nmoral knowledge is similar to knowledge acquired by other senses. We\nsimply attend to something real or imagined, and immediately, without\nany kind of reasoning, just know whether it\u2019s right or wrong,\njust as we come to know the colour or shape of a car just by looking\nat it. And it is no doubt often the case that belief in the presence\nof the wrong-making natural properties (such as intentionally causing\nexcruciating pain to a whimpering dog) triggers an emotional reaction\nin us. It is plausible, and supported by empirical data\n (see Section 2.1),\n that the emotional response often precedes and perhaps causes the\nmoral judgment. But is it a perception or something analogous?\n\nIn the case of ordinary perceptual experience, an object instantiates\nan observable property, such as being red, and this causes us (in the\nright way) to have a corresponding phenomenal representation of the\nobject, such as a visual experience of a red object in front of us\n(Audi 2013). Many believe that this experience is not itself a belief:\nI can believe that a stick in the water is straight while it\nnevertheless perceptually appears to me that it is not straight.\nHowever, ordinarily having a perceptual experience provides\njustification for a corresponding belief, either because it presents\nor represents things as being in a particular way (as epistemological\ninternalists think) or because it reliably informs us of them being\nthat way (as epistemological externalists think), or a combination of\nthese. Epistemologists debate whether justification requires only the\nabsence of defeaters or also some type of warrant to rule out\nskeptical scenarios, and what needs to be added for a true belief to\namount to knowledge.\n\nSo is there such a thing as emotional moral perception? The answer\ndepends, in part, on the nature of emotions. On Hume\u2019s view, a\npassion is \u201can original existence\u201d which \u201ccontains\nnot any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other\nexistence\u201d (T 415). If this is the case, then emotional\nexperience cannot justify belief the same way contentful perceptual\nexperience does. However, most contemporary epistemic sentimentalists\nreject Hume\u2019s theory of emotions. Instead, they subscribe to\nsome variety of a representational theory of emotions, motivated by\nthe thought that emotions can be assessed as appropriate or fitting or\neven rational (de Sousa 1987). This suggests that emotions are\nabout something \u2013 that they have intentional\ncontent.\n\nOne representational theory holds that emotions involve or consist in\na judgment that the target of the emotion (such as flying on\nan airplane) has the property that is the formal object of\nthe emotion (such as being fearsome or dangerous in the case of fear)\n(Kenny 1963; Lyons 1980). Sabine Roeser (2011) defends this type of\naccount in the moral case. According to her, moral emotions are\n\u201cat the same time both value judgments and affective\nstates\u201d (Roeser 2011: 149). On her view, they constitute\nintuitions just in the same sense as traditional intuitionists claim:\nthey are direct apprehensions of non-natural states of affairs. (This\nis a clear case in which epistemic and metaphysical variants of\nsentimentalism come apart.) Any view of this type faces the challenge\nof explaining why our emotions would reliably track such non-natural\nfacts. The other worry is that value judgments in general are not\nself-justifying, so it is not clear why judgments embedded in emotion\nwould justify further belief.\n\nIn any case, it is a well-known problem with judgmental theories of\nemotion that emotions can be recalcitrant, that is, come\napart from our judgments. We can be worried in spite of judging that\neverything is alright. Moreover, many think that children or animals\ncan have emotions without possessing evaluative concepts, and thus\nwithout being capable of making evaluative judgments. Such\nconsiderations lead many to regard emotions as being or containing or\nbeing analogous to perceptual experiences (de Sousa 1987;\nTappolet 2000, 2011; Helm 2001; Prinz 2004, 2007; Zagzebski 2003;\nGoldie 2007; D\u00f6ring 2007; Wisnewski 2015). On this type of view,\nemotions and perceptual experiences have many common features: they\nare spontaneous (not under direct volitional control), informationally\nencapsulated (that is, relatively independent from the subject\u2019s\nbeliefs and desires), have a characteristic phenomenology, and have\nconceptual (and/or non-conceptual) content, thus representing or\nconstruing the world as being in a certain way without involving\njudgment or belief.\n\nOn perceptualist views, emotions are the closest thing we have to\nacquaintance with value \u2013 for example, as Adam Pelser puts it,\n\u201cto experience something as funny just is to be amused by\nit\u201d (2014: 112). Just as colour-blind people may know on the\nbasis of testimony that an object is red without being acquainted with\nits redness, a person who is incapable of awe may learn from others\nthat something is sublime while lacking an acquaintance with or direct\naccess to its sublimity (ibid.). Analogous claims have also been\ndefended about the nature of desire, which is held by many to\nbe a non-doxastic appearance of the good (Stampe 1987; Oddie 2005;\nTenenbaum 2007; Sinhababu 2017). Perceptualists tend to hold that the\ndistinctive feature of emotional perception is that the content is\nevaluative, which in turn is often thought to explain the special\nphenomenology. However, Julien Deonna and Fabrice Teroni (2015) have\nrecently argued that the evaluative character of emotions should be\nunderstood in terms of bodily attitudes rather than\nevaluative content (for criticism, see Mitchell forthcoming). (For\nmore on debates about the nature of emotion, see the\n entry on emotion.)\n\nGiven the perceptualist metaphysical claim about emotions, many have\nargued for the following kind of epistemic thesis:\n\n\nEpistemic Emotional Perceptualism (EEP): Emotions are sources of\nimmediate (non-inferential) prima facie (or defeasible) justification\nfor evaluative propositions. (cf. Carter 2019)\n\n\nIf Epistemic Emotional Perceptualism is true, emotions can play a\nfoundational role in moral epistemology - they (or their contents) can\npotentially justify belief in moral propositions independently of the\ncontents of one\u2019s other beliefs, just as my perceptual\nexperience as of a black dog in front of me can potentially justify\nbelief in the corresponding proposition, regardless of what I believed\nbefore (see e.g. D\u00f6ring 2007, Pelser 2014). To be sure, it is\npossible to hold a compromise position, according to which the\njustification provided by emotions is sufficient to justify belief\nonly if it also coheres with one\u2019s other beliefs, as van Roojen\n(2014) notes.\n\nHowever, as Robert Cowan (2016) emphasizes, EEP isn\u2019t entailed\nby perceptualism about emotion, since the metaphysical differences\nbetween emotions and paradigm perceptual experiences might make for an\nepistemic difference, as indeed many have argued. So it is worth\nasking just why emotions would be sources of justification, even if\nthey are analogous to, or a distinct species of, perceptual\nexperience. Christine Tappolet argues that since prima facie\njustification is such a minimal epistemic status, it is easy to\nattain: \u201cIf you are afraid of a dog, it is surely something that\nmakes your belief that the dog is fearsome prima facie\njustified.\u201d (Tappolet 2016: 40) However, if we are to be\njustified in believing on the basis of emotional experience, whatever\njustification they offer must be strong enough to suffice for belief.\nSome principled explanation for this is needed. The simplest way would\nbe to hold that any appearance of things being in a certain way can\nyield sufficient, if defeasible justification, as Michael\nHuemer\u2019s (2001) epistemic liberalism has it. Insofar as\nfear, for example, presents its target as being fearsome (or\ndangerous), it would justify the corresponding evaluative belief in\nthe absence of defeaters (see Tucker (ed.) 2013).\n\nWhile there is thus a plausible (if controversial) epistemic framework\nthat would account for EEP, there are a number of serious challenges\nto it. After all, even proponents of the perceptualist account of\nemotion grant that there are a number of notable differences between\nemotions and sensory perceptual experiences (Tappolet 2016). Some of\nthese differences may be epistemically relevant. To begin with, there\nseems to be an obvious difference in our everyday epistemic practice:\nwe don\u2019t typically ask for reasons for perceptual experiences,\nbut we do ask for reasons for emotions (Brady 2013). For example, if\nyou say you see a dog outside, I\u2019m unlikely to ask\n\u201cWhy?\u201d, while if you say you\u2019re afraid of the dog,\nit makes perfect sense to ask the question. Conversely, if I ask you\nwhy you think the bridge is dangerous, you\u2019re unlikely to say\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid of it\u201d, while you might well\nappealing to having seen the dog outside to justify your belief that\nit is there. As Michael Brady puts it, unlike sensory perceptions,\nemotions raise rather than silence justificatory demands (2013: 110).\nWhat\u2019s more, he maintains, if an emotion like fear justified\nbelief about dangerousness, it would be objectionably self-justifying,\nsince danger merits fear, and \u201cThe very fact that I am afraid of\nthe dog cannot, by itself, be evidence that it is fitting or\nappropriate to be afraid of the dog\u201d (Brady 2010, 123).\n\nHow might epistemic perceptualists respond? One possibility is to\nemphasize a salient difference between emotions and sense perceptions:\nemotions have cognitive bases in the subject\u2019s\nperceptions or beliefs (Deonna and Teroni 2012: 24\u201325). For\nexample, I\u2019m not afraid of the dog in front of me unless I think\nthere\u2019s a dog in front of me, and believe that it may well hurt\nme. My fear is grounded in part in those beliefs or perceptions. One\nconsequence is that the emotion itself is justified only if the\ncognitive bases are justified (even if not necessarily true)\n(Greenspan 1988). If so, emotional justification is dependent\n(Pelser 2014, Cowan 2018). Initially, this might look like bad news\nfor EEP, since it appears to conflict with the thesis that emotions\nprovide immediate justification for evaluative propositions. But note\nthat while emotional justification may presuppose justification for\nbelief in non-evaluative propositions (such as those\nconcerning a dog\u2019s proneness to attack), there is a gap between\nthese inputs and the evaluative proposition that is the\ncontent of the emotional experience itself according to perceptualism\n(see Etcheverri 2019). I might be angry with you because I believe you\ntold somebody about my peculiar hobby, but the anger itself\ndoesn\u2019t present you as having talked about my hobby, but rather\nyour having wronged me. Even if it is as a matter of fact the case\nthat my being wronged in this situation consists in your having\nrevealed an embarrassing fact about me, it doesn\u2019t follow that\nwhat justifies belief in the factual proposition suffices to justify\nthe belief in the moral proposition. For all that\u2019s been said\nabout epistemic dependence on cognitive bases, my anger might provide\nadditional, immediate justification for belief in the\nwrongness of your act. As Robert Cowan puts it, \u201cwhen the\ncognitive base of an emotion is justified then emotions can justify\nbeliefs with evaluative content, independently of having further\njustification for believing supporting evaluative propositions\u201d\n(2018: 229).\n\nThe upside of epistemic dependence, then, is that it allows epistemic\nperceptualists to give a natural answer to the why-question\nchallenges. If you ask me why I think the wolf is dangerous or why I\nthink my friend\u2019s act was wrong, I\u2019ll cite the salient\nnon-evaluative feature that makes the situation dangerous or the act\nwrong and thus justifies my emotion (as I see things), rather than the\nfact that I respond to it with an emotion. Through the lens of my\nemotion, so to speak, I regard this non-evaluative feature as\ngrounding an evaluative truth concerning the target \u2013 it will\nseem so obvious to me that it\u2019s not worth mentioning that, say,\na dog\u2019s being poised to attack merits fear.\n\nHow about the self-justification challenge? Jonathan Mitchell (2017)\npoints out that in non-pathological cases, fear, for example, does\npresent its target as calling for fear \u2013 otherwise the emotion\nisn\u2019t intelligible to the subject herself. Plausibly, Brady is\nright that the evidence for dangerousness (meriting fear) isn\u2019t\nthe fact that I\u2019m afraid, but the dog\u2019s posing a threat to\nmy interests. Nevertheless, my fear might make this fact\u2019s\nreason-giving status available to me in the good case. The\nfear still wouldn\u2019t be self-justifying, since the dog might not\nin fact pose a threat.\n\nThe problems for perceptualism don\u2019t end with dependence on\ncognitive basis, however. There is reason to believe that emotions\nalso depend on our desires or concerns (Roberts 2003).\nI\u2019m only sad when you break an old vase if I wanted to keep it,\nor afraid of the growling wolf if I don\u2019t want to be eaten. When\nit comes to belief or indeed perceptual experience, it\u2019s a\nstrike against justificatory standing if the state is influenced by a\ndesire \u2013 as Markie (2005) observes in criticizing epistemic\nliberalism, if a rock seems like a gold nugget to you just because you\nreally want it to be a gold nugget, this seeming doesn\u2019t justify\nbelief in its being a gold nugget. So why isn\u2019t this sort of\ncognitive penetrability a problem for EEP? A natural way to get around\nthe problem is to say that the desires or concerns underlying the\nemotional appearance must themselves be correct or justified. The\nproblem with this suggestion is that one then needs a story of how\ndesires are correct or justified that doesn\u2019t itself appeal to\nemotional experience, which doesn\u2019t seem compatible with\nemotions playing a foundational epistemic role (see Helm 2001 for a\ncoherentist take).\n\nFinally, while EEP tends to have an epistemological internalist\nflavor, perceptual experience in general is of course linked to the\nexternal world. In the case of sensory perception, causal links to the\nobjects of perception play a role in explaining the reliability, and\narguably the justificatory status, of perceptual experiences. Emotions\ndon\u2019t seem to be caused by the evaluative properties they\nrepresent, however \u2013 though if we consider how we go from\nproximal sensory stimulus to perception of objects, the difference\nbetween ordinary perceptual experiences and emotions may not be so\nlarge (Milona and Naar 2020). Causal relations may also explain why\nperceptual experiences have the contents they do.\n\nAn alternative line is to say that what causes the emotion isn\u2019t\nan evaluative feature of the object \u2013 rather, what we literally\nperceive is the property that grounds the wrongness of the action,\nsuch as the shooting of a peaceful demonstrator by a police officer,\nand then respond to it with an emotional reaction, which construes the\naction as wrong. Imagination would work as well. If so, perhaps it is\nbetter to think of emotions as quasi-perceptual appearances that\nconstitute moral intuitions rather than perceptions (Kauppinen 2013).\nThis goes naturally with a view on which emotions (re)present their\ntargets as having certain evaluative properties in virtue of their\nphenomenal character rather than etiology. The way an emotion feels is\nnot irrelevant to how it construes its object (cf. Goldie 2000 on\n\u2018feelings towards\u2019 an object). The feelings involved in\nanger, for example, aren\u2019t directionless sensations, but have a\nqualitative character in virtue of which anger presents its object as\noffensive (Kriegel 2014).\n\nWhat about reliability? Again, many believe that ordinary perceptual\nexperience justifies belief in part because it is generally reliable,\neven if its phenomenal features are also relevant to justification. In\nany case, moral knowledge requires more than justification\nand truth \u2013 as it is common to say these days, a belief must be\nsafe (such that it could not easily have been the case that\nthe person would have formed a false belief using the same method) to\namount to knowledge (Sosa 1999, Williamson 2000). As noted earlier,\nsome epistemic sentimentalists, such as Tappolet (2011), are not\nmetaphysical sentimentalists, but rather realists about value. Those\nwho hold a view of this type may argue, as Adam Carter (2019) does,\nthat for emotional experiences to justify belief they must issue from\na competence or skill, roughly a disposition to get it right\nwhen properly situated. Other epistemic perceptualists, such as Prinz\n(2007) subscribe to sentimentalist metaphysics. It is open to them to\noffer a constitutive explanation of the reliability of\nemotions: since the evaluative facts are constitutively linked to\nemotional responses, there is good reason to think emotional responses\ntrack them, at least in suitable conditions.\n\nTo be sure, even if moral perception (or sentimental intuition) is\nepistemically as good as sense perception, we know that in some\ncircumstances our senses are not reliable. But how do we know which\ncircumstances? This calibration challenge was already noted\nby Hutcheson:\n\n\nBut may there not be a right or wrong state of our moral sense, as\nthere is in our other senses, according as they represent their\nobjects to be as they really are, or represent them otherwise? So may\nnot our moral sense approve that which is vicious, and disapprove\nvirtue, as a sickly palate may dislike grateful food, or a vitiated\nsight misrepresent colours or dimensions? Must we not know therefore\nantecedently what is morally good or evil by our reason, before we can\nknow that our moral sense is right? (Hutcheson 1728: 177)\n\n\nHutcheson\u2019s response was to point out that even if moral sense\ncan mislead, it doesn\u2019t follow that reason is needed to\nprovide a standard for it, or that it\u2019s capable of doing so.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not by reasoning that we fundamentally correct\nmistakes of colour perception. Rather, we try to ascertain which\ncircumstances are conducive to properly functioning perception\n(perhaps by way of an a priori inquiry) and then try to place\nourselves in such circumstances and look again. What the suitable\ncircumstances in the moral case are like depends on the nature of\nmoral facts. For relativists like Prinz (2007), the only thing that\nmatters is that our reactions genuinely reflect our sentiments towards\nthe action. For ideal dispositionalists, David Lewis offers a basic\nrecipe:\n\n\nTo find out whether we would be disposed, under ideal conditions, to\nvalue it, put yourself in ideal conditions, if you can, making sure\nyou can tell when you have succeeded in doing so. Then find out\nwhether you value the thing in question, i.e., whether you desire to\ndesire it. If you do, that confirms that it is a value. (Lewis 1989:\n117)\n\n\nFor Lewis himself, the ideal conditions for valuing are those of full\nimaginative acquaintance with the object. For Hume and Smith, the\nideal conditions of moral judging involve occupying the \u2018common\npoint of view\u2019 or the perspective of an impartial and\nwell-informed spectator. As discussed in\n Section 2.2,\n they both believe that achieving this requires sympathizing (or\nempathizing) with the feelings or reactive attitudes of those\nimmediately affected while controlling for predictable distortions.\nUnless they are felt from the common point of view, our emotional\nresponses will not reliably track the response-dependent moral\nfacts.\n5.2 Tracking Theories\n\nNot all epistemic sentimentalists subscribe to the perceptualist\nmodel. One alternative is provided by John Allman and Jim Woodward\n(2008), who argue that moral intuitions (in the sense of immediate\njudgments resulting from what psychologists call System 1) involving\nemotional processing can reliably track moral facts after a suitable\nkind of implicit learning. They draw on empirical work on the\ndevelopment of expertise. In implicit learning, the learner,\nsuch as a novice nurse, is repeatedly exposed to certain cues, (such\nas babies manifesting different symptoms), makes certain decisions to\nact (giving certain kind of treatment to the baby), and then receives\nclear, independent feedback on whether the decisions were correct (the\nsymptoms either go away or get worse) (Kahneman and Klein 2009). As a\nresult, the learner may become an expert, who is able to respond\nimmediately and appropriately to situations without necessarily being\nable to articulate why. Allman and Woodward\u2019s suggestion is that\na similar kind of training of our emotional responses is possible in\nthe moral case.\n\nMore recently, Peter Railton has also highlighted conceptions of the\naffective system as \u201ca flexible, experience-based\ninformation-processing system quite capable of tracking statistical\ndependencies and of guiding behavioral selection via the balancing of\ncosts, benefits, and risks\u201d (2014, 833) Just as laboratory rats\nhave been found to develop action-guiding forward models that\nimplicitly represent expected values of their options, our feelings\ncan be attuned to possible rewards and punishments, and can be\nexpected to color our evaluative perception.\n\nThe core challenge for this type of view is that there is a difference\nbetween training emotions to be responsive to potentially morally\nrelevant information, such as\n\n\nmental states of others and their likely behavior in interactive\nsituations, as well as the likely consequences of such behaviour\n(Allman and Woodward 2008: 173),\n\n\nand training them to be responsive to moral facts themselves.\nIt is not clear whether there is any analogue to the unambiguous and\nindependent negative feedback that a nurse receives after giving the\nwrong treatment in the case of making a mistaken moral judgment.\nRailton suggests that empathy might play such a role, noting that\nhaving a capacity to empathize and activating it in situ\n\u201cappear [\u2026] to be important predictors of moral\nsensitivity and behavior\u201d (2014: 844), for example by inhibiting\nviolence. But while empathy can certainly give feedback about the\n(anticipated) responses of others, it is one thing to learn that\nothers as a matter of fact, say, suffer because of or\ndisapprove of what I did, and quite another to learn that such\ndisapproval is merited. To attune affective responses to\nmoral facts, it seems that it is the latter kind of feedback we would\nneed.\n5.3 Moral Understanding and Testimony\n\nWhether or not emotions are a source of evaluative justification or\nknowledge, they might play a role in a different epistemic good,\nnamely moral understanding, and, perhaps relatedly, help\nexplain why our moral epistemic practices are different from many\nothers. To begin with the latter, consider the following cases of\ntestimony (based on Callahan 2018):\n\n\nNina wants to know whether the law permits deducting expenses incurred\nfor charitable work when filing taxes. She asks a specialist, who\ntells her it\u2019s okay. Nina thus comes to believe the law permits\ndeducting the expenses.\n\nAleksi wants to know whether it is, as a rule, morally wrong to\nmislead others by omitting unfavorable details. He asks a wise friend,\nwho says it is. Aleksi thus comes to believe that it is as a rule\nmorally wrong to lie by omission.\n\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that both Nina and Aleksi come to know what they\nwanted by testimony. (Set aside any general worries about testimonial\nknowledge, and assume that in both cases they have sufficient reason\nto trust the word of the person they\u2019re asking.) It seems to\nmany that while what Nina does is entirely unproblematic, there is\nsomething off, if not outright wrong, with Aleksi\u2019s moral\ndeference. More generally, one commonly accepted qualification is\nthat moral deference is problematic when one forms a moral belief\nsolely on the basis of testimony, instead of, for example, reflecting\non the matter as a result of another\u2019s expressing an opinion.\nAnother common qualification is that problematic testimony concerns\npure moral content whose truth doesn\u2019t hang on empirical\nassumptions. It is not problematic to change one\u2019s opinion about\nan impure moral matter on the basis of testimony that concerns a\nmorally relevant empirical fact, as when someone comes to believe it\nis wrong to eat fish on the basis of being informed that fish feel\npain (Fletcher 2016). In brief, it seems that you shouldn\u2019t\nchange your mind on a purely moral matter just because someone tells\nyou (even if you have no particular reason to doubt them).\n\nBut what, if anything, is wrong with moral deference? Guy Fletcher\nargues that the link between sentiments and morality explains the\nunease. First, he holds that \u201cMoral sentiments are at least\ndifficult to form on the basis of pure, direct, testimony\u201d\n(Fletcher 2016: 60). This parallels other cases: I can\u2019t feel\nadmiration for a painting just because you tell me it\u2019s worth\nadmiring, for example. Second, as discussed in Section 2, there are\nmany metaethical views on which moral judgments either (partially or\nwholly) consist in sentiments or link up with sentiments. If so,\ntestimony-based judgments are either impossible or defective. However,\nLaura Frances Callahan (2018) points out that if one did form\nmoral sentiments purely on the basis of testimony, our sense that\nsomething fishy is going on wouldn\u2019t go away. In fact, it would\nbe even more alarming if someone came to be passionate about some\nmoral matter just because somebody else said it was wrong!\n\nA very different popular explanation of the problematic nature of\nmoral deference appeals to the notion of moral understanding: while we\ncan acquire moral knowledge by testimony, we will not (easily\nor at all) acquire moral understanding that way, and moral\nunderstanding is important for moral worth, or deserving credit for\none\u2019s action (Hills 2009). For Alison Hills (2016), moral\nunderstanding is a form of \u201ccognitive control\u201d, roughly\nthe ability to grasp and articulate why certain features make an\naction (say) wrong, and consequently what would need to be different\nfor it to be right. Callahan (2018) argues that having the kind of\ncognitive abilities that Hills highlights doesn\u2019t suffice for\nmoral worth, since possessing them is consistent with being motivated\nby features that are not reasons for acting. On her alternative\nsentimentalist account, moral understanding itself requires also\nhaving fitting affective and motivational responses towards the\nunderstood propositions and the relevant explanatory relationships\n(Callahan 2018: 451\u2013452). For example, understanding that a\npractice is wrong because it\u2019s racist involves a disposition to\nbe angry or sad about it because it\u2019s racist (or about the\nfeatures that make it racist), and a willingness to abstain from or\nintervene in the practice. The problem with deference, then, is that\nit disincentivizes the sort of reflection and inquiry that would give\nrise to such responses in addition to the relevant cognitive abilities\n(Callahan 2018: 454\u2013456; for a very different sentimentalist\ntake, see Howard 2018).\n\nFinally, even those who don\u2019t believe that sentiments are\nconstitutive of moral understanding may believe that they help bring\nit about. Thus, Brady (2013) argues that the positive epistemic role\nof emotions in morality consists largely in their role in\nmotivating us to find out why some things are right or\nwrong.\n6. The Many Moral Sentimentalisms (Reprise)\n\nIt was noted at the beginning that there are many things one can be a\nsentimentalist about. We are now in a position to make some\nobservations about relationships among them. First, explanatory\nsentimentalism is clearly independent of the rest. It is\nperfectly possible that emotions play some significant role in\nexplaining moral judgment, whatever such judgments or moral facts\nconsist in, and whether or not they\u2019re sources of moral\nknowledge. To be sure, if some simple form of judgment sentimentalism\nis true, emotions offer a kind of constitutive explanation of moral\njudgments \u2013 if I\u2019m angry with you, this explains why I\nmorally judge you\u2019ve wronged me, because it constitutes my\njudgment. And explanatory sentimentalism clearly has epistemic\nimplications. If emotions both explain our beliefs and justify them,\nour moral verdicts are vindicated. If, in contrast, emotions explain\nour beliefs but do not justify them \u2013 if explanatory\nsentimentalism is true but epistemic sentimentalism is false \u2013\nwe end up with a skeptical view.\n\nSecond, judgment sentimentalism has an evident kinship with\nmetaphysical sentimentalism. This is so especially for those\ncognitivist versions according to which our judgments attribute\nresponse-dependent properties, which are metaphysically linked to our\nsentimental responses. But there are also contextualists for whom\nmoral judgments describe ordinary natural properties, and fitting\nattitude theorists, for whom moral judgments are about the fittingness\nof attitudes, where facts about fittingness may themselves be\nnon-natural truths.\n\nFinally, epistemic sentimentalism is again in principle\nindependent of other varieties: we\u2019ve seen that one can be a\nmind-independent realist about moral properties while thinking that\nsome suitable emotions provide access to moral truths. But if moral\nfacts are constitutively related to our reactions and our judgments\nare about such facts, we will have a good a priori reason to\nthink that beliefs based on suitable emotions would not easily mislead\nus and may thus amount to knowledge. While different forms of\nsentimentalism are separable from each other, they are thus mutually\nsupportive, if held together.\n",
