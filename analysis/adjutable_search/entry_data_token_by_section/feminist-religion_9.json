(Jantzen 1999, 2004). She argues that questions\nabout truth and the justification of religious belief can be dismissed\nas categories of the masculine symbolic. Going beyond Luce Irigaray,\nJantzen\u2019s body of work at the time of her death in 2006 proposed\nnothing less than a new imaginary of religion, a feminist symbolic of\n\u201cnatality and flourishing\u201d as an alternative to the\ncategory of mortality, verging on necrophilia/necrophobia, with which\nthe western tradition has been saturated. Influenced by Hannah\nArendt\u2019s work on natality and Adriana Cavarero\u2019s feminist reading of\nPlato, Jantzen believed that a preoccupation with death and violence\nsubtends the masculinist imaginary. If feminist philosophy of religion\nis ever to transform the symbolic order which inscribes this\nimaginary, it is necessary to change the imaginary. For this purpose,\na model of transformative change drawn from psychoanalysis and\nContinental philosophy of religion is more useful than a model drawn\nfrom Anglo-American adversarial modes of argumentation (Jantzen 1999:\n78).\n\nTo demonstrate the extent to which the Western symbolic is saturated\nwith violence and death, epitomized in the crucified Christ, Jantzen\nsituated her philosophy of religion in relation to the psychoanalytic\ntheory of both Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray. Their account offers\na theory of one of the most important features of any religion:\nsacrifice. Sacrificial codes involve a forgetting/erasure of the\ncomplex role of the maternal, amounting to a \u201cmatricide\u201d\n(Kristeva) at the foundation of religious practice. According to\nIrigaray in \u201cBelief Itself\u201d, the central figure of the\nwestern cultural imaginary is the unmourned and unacknowledged\nsacrifice of the (m)other\u2019s body that Christianity masks under the\nEucharistic sacrifice of the son. According to Kristeva (1977 [1987])\nin \u201cStabat Mater\u201d, the real symbolic association is not\nbetween women and birth, but between women and death, setting up men\nas cultural masters over and above mortality and its intimations in\nthe bodies of women.\n\nJantzen corrected the matricidal assertion of Kristevan theory; she\nargued against thinking that the child\u2019s need to separate from the\nmother in order to become an individual is what initiates a logic of\nsacrifice and violence in the western symbolic. There is no imperative\nto sacrifice the mother in order to commence formation of the self in\nthe cultural realm. However important separation and individuation are\nin subject formation, they are not proportional to death and violence.\nIf we were to attend to natality instead, Jantzen wrote, we would be\nbetter able to create a new imaginary based on birth, life, and\npotentiality (Jantzen 2003). Feminist philosophy of religion should\ntry to follow the path of desire to/for the divine, and forego the\npreoccupation with the rational justification of beliefs and the\nevaluation of truth-claims. Feminist philosophy of religion can attend\nbetter to the symbolic impact of birth rather than death as a strategy\nfor creating a new imaginary construct that emphasizes flourishing of\nlife rather than sacrifice of it. The norms of moral or political\nadequacy replace those of epistemic adequacy (Jantzen 2004).\n\nIf one asks what the ontological status of the divine is for Jantzen,\none could say that it is pantheistic (see Jantzen 1999, chap. 11). As\nthe horizon of human becoming, the divine is transcendent in the sense\nof the other of the world, non-reducible to statements about the\nworld\u2019s physical characteristics. As immanent, the divine is\nthis world; there is no other. What previously had been seen\nas a set of polarities now opens out into a play of diversities,\nbringing the divine to life through us.\n\nFoundations of Violence, Jantzen\u2019s final publication,\nsynthesizes her analysis of the psychoanalytic, religious, and\nphilosophical dimensions of death and violence in Western culture,\nculminating in a constructive alternative (a feminine symbolic) that\ncelebrates beauty, desire, and the creative impulse.\nThanatos, a death drive, far from being a universal of human\nnature, as Freud believed, is a gendered construction of Western\nmodernity, according to Jantzen, with precursors in Christendom and\nclassical antiquity. Homer, Sophocles, Plato and Aristotle provide the\ngenealogy of violence in Western thought that Jantzen critiques here,\nwhile Plotinus stands in for all those other-worldly seekers who\ngesture toward release in another world. What was to be a six-volumed\nstudy on Death and the Displacement of Beauty in the western\ntradition can be comprehended in incipient form in Jantzen 1999.\n\nPushing with and against Lacanian and Freudian theories, Jantzen\n(2002), Armour (2002), and Hollywood (2002, 2004) offer three\nimportant readings of Irigaray\u2019s essay \u201cBelief Itself\u201d\n(1980 [1993b]). These feminist readings rely on critical\nappropriations of psychoanalysis and Derridean reading practices to\nre-assess a topic that stands at the center of much modern philosophy\nof religion. Belief and its formation, they show, is implicated in the\nformation of the subject and sexual difference, as well as related\nissues of embodiment and presence and absence. The argument is not\nonly the familiar feminist one that the object of belief is\nmale-defined, but the more radical claim that the structure and\ndiscourse of belief itself is masculinist and in need of\ndeconstruction. That is to say that the constitution of the normative\n(Western, bourgeois) subject of religion and philosophy depends on the\nassociation of the body with the mother and femininity and an always\nincomplete and ambivalent mastering, concealment, or denial of the\nmother\u2019s body. Freud\u2019s own account of the fort/da game\n(\u201cgone\u201d-\u201cthere\u201d) played by his grandson,\nErnst, exposes the relationship between belief and the little boy\u2019s\nmastery of the mother\u2019s presence and absence, concealedness and\nunconcealedness. Despite her apparent absence, she is there, the boy\ncomes to believe, and in so believing he experiences his own power.\nFor Irigaray (1993b), God, as the Father and the source of meaning,\nemerges as the object of a belief first articulated in the (male\nchild\u2019s) attempt to master the mother\u2019s absence; the dismantling of\nthe subject as master, then, implies a concomitant deconstruction of\nthe object of belief. For Armour (2002), the implications of this\nreading on the other side of ontotheology entail a challenge to any\nnarrow definition of ontotheology or too-easy hope that it might swing\nfree of logocentrism and phallocentrism. The wound at the heart of\nnormative masculine subjectivity, evident in Derrida\u2019s display of his\ndying mother\u2019s body in his essay \u201cCircumfession\u201d, is an\neffect of the current sacrificial economy on the mother/son\nrelationship. As Armour suggests, \n\n\nworking from the recognition of a primordial maternal sacrifice\n(rather than belief in a transcendent Father God) requires\nconfrontation with pain and loss, not compensation for them. (Armour\n2002: 223) \n\n\nFor Hollywood, a further implication concerns the renewed attention to\nthe place of ritual and practice in religion. Not only do religious\nrituals, bodily practices, and discursive performatives construct\ngender but they also construct the very objects of religious belief.\nHer proposal that, as constituted, gender and the objects of religious\nbelief have a similar ontological status re-opens a crucial question\nthat many feminist philosophers of religion have finessed. The\nontological status of objects of belief, especially deliberately\nprojected ones, cannot be fully understood without bringing back into\nthe picture the body, emotion, and desire as shaped by ritual\npractices (Hollywood, 2004).\n",
