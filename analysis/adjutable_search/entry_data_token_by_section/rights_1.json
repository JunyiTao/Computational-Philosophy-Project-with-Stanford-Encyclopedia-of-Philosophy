To understand\nthe exact meaning of any assertion of a right, we need to understand\nmore precisely how rights are constructed and what they do.\n\nAn analysis of rights has two parts: a description of the internal\nstructure of rights (their form), and a description of what rights do\nfor those who hold them (their function). The Hohfeldian system for\ndescribing the form of rights is widely accepted, although there are\nscholarly quarrels about its details. Which theory gives the best\naccount of the function of rights has been much more contentious; we\nturn to that debate in section 3.\n",
