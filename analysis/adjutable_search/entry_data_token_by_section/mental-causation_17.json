    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || The Exclusion Problem\n6.2 The Exclusion Problem\n\nNow, however, we are again confronted with the threat of\nepiphenomenalism. If mental properties are not physical, how\ncould they make a causal difference? Whenever any mental\n(functional) property M is instantiated, it will be realized\nby some particular physical property P. This physical\nproperty is unproblematically relevant to producing various behavioral\neffects. But then what causal work is left for M to do? It\nseems to be causally idle, \u201cexcluded\u201d by the work of\nP.\n\nThis version of the problem of mental causation has appeared in\nvarious guises. Much of the contemporary literature is inspired by\nMalcolm 1968, especially as refined in Kim 1989, 1993c, 1998, 2005.\nWhatever its precise formulation (cp. Shapiro and Sober 2007;\nO\u2019Connor and Churchill 2010; historical perspective is in\nPatterson 2005), the Exclusion Problem has clear affinities with the\nother problems we\u2019ve looked at so far. Consider our claim that\nthe realizing property P must play a role in producing a\nparticular behavioral effect. This would seem to be justified either\nby an appeal to Completeness (\u00a72.4) or to\nDavidson\u2019s doctrine (\u00a75.1) that causal relations must fall\nunder strict (and so physical) laws. Moreover, the argument\u2019s\ndepiction of P and M as competing for causal\nrelevance\u2014one must exclude the other\u2014would seem to require\na principle such as No Overdetermination (\u00a72.4). And the\nfundamental worry that P might exclude M looks\nexactly like the freeloader problem that badgers mainstream attempts\nto save anomalous monism (\u00a7\u00a75.3\u20134).\n\nIn spite of these similarities, the Exclusion Problem is in one\nimportant respect unique: unlike the problems we\u2019ve looked at so\nfar, exclusion worries generalize to a wide range of phenomena outside\nof the mental. Any properties, mental or otherwise, that are multiply\nrealizable in physical systems are threatened with causal irrelevance.\n(For discussion of this and related issues, see Kim 1998, pp.\n77\u201387; Noordhof 1999; Bontly 2001; Gillett and Rives 2001; Block\n2003; Walter 2008.)\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Fodor 1989; Baker 1993; Shapiro 2010) take\nthis general nature of the problem to be an encouraging sign.\nWe happily accept biological, or meteorological, or geological\nproperties as causally significant despite their being distinct from\ntheir physical realizers. Why then imagine that exclusion threatens\nthe efficacy of mental properties? Others turn this argument around,\ninsisting that the alleged efficacy of biological and other\n\u201cspecial science\u201d properties is by no means sacrosanct\n(Antony 1995). Causal powers we attribute to them must respect what\nour best metaphysics tells us. And in any case, the central issue is\nnot so much whether mental properties (and the rest) are\ncausally relevant to the production of physical effects, but\nhow they could be (Kim 1998, pp. 61\u20132,\n78\u20139; Antony and Levine 1997, p. 96; McLaughlin 2006). Even if\nthe Exclusion Problem, because it generalizes, does not tempt us to\nembrace epiphenomenalism, it presses on us a responsibility to explain\nhow mental properties could play a causal role given that they appear\nto be screened off by their physical realizers.\n\nThe Exclusion Problem is the subject of a large and still-growing\nliterature. In the next few sub-sections, we look at some of the main\nlines of response, dividing them into three broad categories.\n",
