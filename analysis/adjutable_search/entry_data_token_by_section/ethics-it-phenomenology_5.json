    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches to Technology || A Fundamental Critique of the Technological Attitude\n2.1 A Fundamental Critique of the Technological Attitude\n\nProbably the most famous phenomenological analysis of\ntechnology\u2014or rather the technological attitude that gives rise\nto artifacts\u2014is Martin Heidegger\u2019s (1977) essay The\nQuestion Concerning Technology. This essay is important as a\nreference point because it illustrates forcefully the most important\nand distinctive claim of phenomenology vis-\u00e0-vis technology.\nTechnology is not merely an artifact or our relationship with this or\nthat artifact; rather, the artifact\u2014and our relationship with\nit\u2014is already an outcome of a particular\n\u2018technological\u2019 way of seeing and conducting ourselves in\nand towards the world. Heidegger (1977) famously claimed that\n\u201cthe essence of technology is nothing technological\u201d\n(p.4).\n\nFor Heidegger the essence of technology is the way of being of modern\nhumans\u2014a way of conducting themselves towards the\nworld\u2014that sees the world as something to be ordered and shaped\nin line with projects, intentions and desires\u2014a \u2018will to\npower\u2019 that manifest itself as a \u2018will to\ntechnology.\u2019 It is in this technological mood that\nproblems show up as already requiring technical solutions. The term\n\u2018mood\u2019 here is used to refer to a collectively held\n\u2018sense\u2019 (or way of grasping) of an event or a situation;\nwe often use it when we refer to the \u2018mood of the meeting\u2019\nor the \u2018mood of our times.\u2019 He calls this technological\nmood enframing (Gestell in German). With this term\nhe wants to denote that the modern mood takes or approaches the world\nas always and already framed, i.e., enframed. Heidegger claims that\nfor us, living in the technological age, the world is already framed\nas a resource available for us, to be made, to be shaped for our\nongoing possibilities to express our particular projects, to be\nwhatever we are, as business people, engineers, consultants,\nacademics, teenagers, etc. In short: technology makes sense because we\nalready live in the technological age or mood where the world (and we\nas beings that are never \u2018out\u2019 of the world) are already\nframed in this way\u2014as available resources for the ongoing\nchallenging and ordering of the world by us. For him the essence of\ntechnology is not the particular artifacts but the technological mood\nthat make this or that particular artifacts show up as meaningful and\nnecessary.\n\nHeidegger claims that there were other times in human history, a\npre-modern time, where humans did not orient themselves towards the\nworld in a technological way\u2014simply as resources for our\npurposes. He suggests that in ancient Greek culture humans\u2019\nrelationship with the world was one of \u2018letting be\u2019; a\nworld approached in an attitude or mood of reciprocal\n\u2018care.\u2019 This must not be taken as some sort of romantic\nvision of the past in which everybody in ancient Greece\n\u2018cared\u2019 for the world in contrast to the modern\ntechnological mood where everybody takes the world as something to be\nchallenged and ordered. It is rather saying that the mood, the\nhorizon, in which we conduct ourselves tends to dispose us in\nparticular ways. Obviously there were also artifacts in ancient times.\nHowever, according to Heidegger this \u2018pre-technological\u2019\nage (or mood) is one where humans\u2019 relation with the world and\nartifacts, their way of being disposed, was poetic and aesthetic\nrather than technological (enframing). The act of making and shaping\nthe artifact was directed by a different attitude or mood. Since the\nworld was not taken as \u2018available for ordering\u2019 a certain\nreciprocal care and intimacy was possible (and cultivated) in which\nthe world was \u2018let to be\u2019\u2014to let the world show\nitself in its own terms. He claims that the pre-modern craftsman makes\n\u201cthe old wooden bridge\u201d that \u201clets the river run its\ncourse.\u201d However, in the horizon of the technological mood this\nsame river is disclosed as a possibility for a \u201chydroelectric\nplant\u201d that turns the river into a reservoir, a resource on\nstandby for our projects, challenged and framed as available.\n\nThere are many who disagree with Heidegger\u2019s account of the\nmodern technological attitude as the \u2018enframing\u2019 of the\nworld (Feenberg 1999, Pitt 2000). For example Andrew Feenberg (1999)\nargues that Heidegger\u2019s account of modern technology is not\nborne out in contemporary everyday encounters with technology. When we\nlook more carefully we see many individual situations in which the\ntechnological attitude does not hold sway, where people have intimate\nrelationships with artifacts that cannot merely be dismissed as\ninstances of enframing. Others, such as Hubert Dreyfus and Albert\nBorgmann, have extended Heidegger\u2019s work into more specific\ncritiques of particular technologies and particular contemporary ways\nof being.\n",
