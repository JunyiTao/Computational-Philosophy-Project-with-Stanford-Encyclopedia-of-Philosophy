Development of Analytic Philosophy in Latin America\n\nThis section describes the emergence and consolidation of communities\nof analytic philosophers in various Latin American countries. For the\ncurrent purposes, an academic community is a group of people whose\nmembers investigate common topics by following similar approaches and\nengaging in dialogue with one another (Hurtado\n 2007).[3]\n In Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, there have been consolidated\nanalytic communities since the early 1990s. Colombia started late and\nat a slow pace. However, it has seen a fast development over the last\nfew years and currently has a community that displays several features\nof a consolidated community. Chile and Peru have taken important\nmeasures to foster work in the analytic tradition that might lead to\nthe creation of strong analytic communities. In other countries, there\nare either scattered efforts to promote analytic philosophy (Costa\nRica, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Venezuela) or no clear signs of its\npresence.\n",
