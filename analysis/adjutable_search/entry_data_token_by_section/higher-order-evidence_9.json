    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views || Dilemmas\n4.1 Dilemmas\n\nChristensen takes the puzzles surrounding higher-order evidence to\nshow that the requirements of rationality sometimes conflict with one\nanother, putting agents like Aisha in an epistemic bind. This proposal\ndiffers from the two-norm views discussed below, in that there is just\none notion of epistemic rationality at work. According to the dilemma\nview, in some circumstances, it is impossible to satisfy all the\nrational requirements at once.(see Christensen 2007a, 2010a, 2013,\n2016b, and 2021c). In his more recent work (see Christensen 2021c),\nChristensen sees the norms in conflict, in Aisha\u2019s case, as one\nrequiring us to believe what our evidence entails, and another\nrequiring us to revise in light of higher-order evidence. (An\nalternative possibility, which Christensen suggests in earlier work\n[see his 2013], is that the second norm is explicitly an anti-akratic\nnorm.)\n\nAn important feature of Christensen\u2019s view is that, although\nAisha is subject to conflicting requirements, there is still a\nbest epistemic response in her situation. (Christensen holds\nthat the best response is to reduce confidence.) This raises a\nquestion: what determines which response is best? See Leonard 2020 for\narguments against the dilemma view; Leonard defends a nearby view\naccording to which there are conflicting norms, but it\u2019s\nindeterminate (among a restricted set of possibilities) what\nAisha should believe. Knoks (2021) defends a view along similar lines,\narguing that Aisha\u2019s situation is permissive (again, among a\nsimilarly-restricted set of possibilities). The possibility of\ndilemmas in epistemology raises several questions: how can epistemic\nrequirements relate (or not) to notions of epistemic blame, and how\ncan they guide our beliefs? See Hughes 2019 and 2021, e.g., for\nfurther discussion of these issues (though mostly focused on a\ndifferent putative source of conflicting requirements); Hughes defends\nthe position that we should accept epistemic dilemmas.\n",
