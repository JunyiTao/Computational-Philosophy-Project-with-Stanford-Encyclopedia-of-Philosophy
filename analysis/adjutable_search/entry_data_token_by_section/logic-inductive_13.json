    "main_text": "The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem || Likelihood Ratio Convergence when Falsifying Outcomes are Possible\n4.3 Likelihood Ratio Convergence when Falsifying Outcomes are Possible\n\nThe Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem comes in two parts.\nThe first part applies only to those experiments or observations\n\\(c_k\\) within the total evidence stream \\(c^n\\) for which some of the\npossible outcomes have 0 likelihood of occurring according to\nhypothesis \\(h_j\\) but have non-0 likelihood of occurring according to\n\\(h_i\\). Such outcomes are highly desirable. If they occur, the\nlikelihood ratio comparing \\(h_j\\) to \\(h_i\\) will become 0, and\n\\(h_j\\) will be falsified. So-called crucial\nexperiments are a special case of this, where for at least one\npossible outcome \\(o_{ku}\\), \\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}]\n= 1\\) and \\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 0\\). In the more\ngeneral case \\(h_i\\) together with b says that one of the\noutcomes of \\(c_k\\) is at least minimally probable, whereas \\(h_j\\)\nsays that this outcome is impossible\u2014i.e., \\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid\nh_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] \\gt 0\\) and \\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot\nb\\cdot c_{k}] = 0\\). It will be convenient to define a term for this\nsituation.\n\n\nDefinition: Full Outcome Compatibility. Let\u2019s\ncall \\(h_j\\) fully outcome-compatible with \\(h_i\\) on\nexperiment or observation \\(c_k\\) just when, for each of its\npossible outcomes \\(e_k\\), if \\(P[e_k \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}]\n\\gt 0\\), then \\(P[e_k \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] \\gt 0\\).\nEquivalently, \\(h_j\\) is fails to be fully outcome-compatible\nwith \\(h_i\\) on experiment or observation \\(c_k\\) just when,\nfor at least one of its possible outcomes \\(e_k\\), \\(P[e_k \\pmid\nh_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] \\gt 0\\) but \\(P[e_k \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot\nc_{k}] = 0\\). \n\n\nThe first part of the Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem\napplies to that part of the total stream of evidence (i.e., that\nsubsequence of the total evidence stream) on which hypothesis \\(h_j\\)\nfails to be fully outcome-compatible with hypothesis \\(h_i\\);\nthe second part of the theorem applies to the remaining part of the\ntotal stream of evidence, that subsequence of the total evidence\nstream on which \\(h_j\\) is fully outcome-compatible with\n\\(h_i\\). It turns out that these two kinds of cases must be treated\ndifferently. (This is due to the way in which the expected\ninformation content for empirically distinguishing between the\ntwo hypotheses will be measured for experiments and observations that\nare fully outcome compatible; this measure of information\ncontent blows up (becomes infinite) for experiments and observations\nthat fail to be fully outcome compatible). Thus, the\nfollowing part of the convergence theorem applies to just that part of\nthe total stream of evidence that consists of experiments and\nobservations that fail to be fully outcome compatible for the\npair of hypotheses involved. Here, then, is the first part of the\nconvergence theorem.\n\n\nLikelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem 1\u2014The Falsification\nTheorem:\n\nSuppose that the total stream of evidence \\(c^n\\) contains precisely\nm experiments or observations on which \\(h_j\\) fails to be\nfully outcome-compatible with \\(h_i\\). And suppose that the\nIndependent Evidence Conditions hold for evidence stream\n\\(c^n\\) with respect to each of these two hypotheses. Furthermore,\nsuppose there is a lower bound \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that for each\n\\(c_k\\) on which \\(h_j\\) fails to be fully outcome-compatible\nwith \\(h_i\\),  \n\n\\[P[\\vee \\{ o_{ku} : P[o_{ku} \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 0\\} \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}]  \\ge \\delta\\]\n\n\n\u2014i.e., \\(h_i\\) together with \\(b\\cdot c_k\\) says, with\nlikelihood at least as large as \\(\\delta\\), that one of the outcomes\nwill occur that \\(h_j\\) says cannot occur. Then, \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP \\left[\\vee \\left\\{ e^n : \\frac{P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^n]}{P[e^n \\pmid  h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]} = 0\\right\\} \\pmid   h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}\\right]\\\\[2ex]\n = P\\left[\\vee \\left\\{ e^n : P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] = 0\\right\\} \\pmid   h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}\\right]\\\\\n \\ge 1 - (1-\\delta)^m,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nwhich approaches 1 for large m. (For proof see\n Proof of the Falsification Theorem.)\n \n\n\nIn other words, we only suppose that for each of m\nobservations, \\(c_k, h_i\\) says observation \\(c_k\\) has at\nleast a small likelihood \\(\\delta\\) of producing one of the outcomes\n\\(o_{ku}\\) that \\(h_j\\) says is impossible. If the number\nm of such experiments or observations is large enough (or if\nthe lower bound \\(\\delta\\) on the likelihoods of getting such outcomes\nis large enough), and if \\(h_i\\) (together with \\(b\\cdot c^n)\\) is\ntrue, then it is highly likely that one of the outcomes held to be\nimpossible by \\(h_j\\) will actually occur. If one of these outcomes\ndoes occur, then the likelihood ratio for \\(h_j\\) as compared to over\n\\(h_i\\) will become 0. According to Bayes\u2019 Theorem, when this\nhappen, \\(h_j\\) is absolutely refuted by the evidence\u2014its\nposterior probability becomes 0.\n\nThe Falsification Theorem is quite commonsensical. First, notice that\nif there is a crucial experiment in the evidence stream, the\ntheorem is completely obvious. That is, suppose for the specific\nexperiment \\(c_k\\) (in evidence stream \\(c^n)\\) there are two\nincompatible possible outcomes \\(o_{kv}\\) and \\(o_{ku}\\) such that\n\\(P[o_{kv} \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 1\\) and \\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid\nh_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 1\\). Then, clearly, \\(P[\\vee \\{ o_{ku}:\nP[o_{ku} \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 0\\} \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot\nc_{k}] = 1\\), since \\(o_{ku}\\) is one of the \\(o_{ku}\\) such that\n\\(P[o_{ku} \\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{k}] = 0\\). So, where a crucial\nexperiment is available, the theorem applies with \\(m = 1\\) and\n\\(\\delta = 1\\).\n\nThe theorem is equally commonsensical for cases where no crucial\nexperiment is available. To see what it says in such cases, consider\nan example. Let \\(h_i\\) be some theory that implies a specific rate of\nproton decay, but a rate so low that there is only a very small\nprobability that any particular proton will decay in a given year.\nConsider an alternative theory \\(h_j\\) that implies that protons\nnever decay. If \\(h_i\\) is true, then for a persistent enough\nsequence of observations (i.e., if proper detectors can keep trillions\nof protons under observation for long enough), eventually a proton\ndecay will almost surely be detected. When this happens, the\nlikelihood ratio becomes 0. Thus, the posterior probability of \\(h_j\\)\nbecomes 0.\n\nIt is instructive to plug some specific values into the formula given\nby the Falsification Theorem, to see what the convergence rate might\nlook like. For example, the theorem tells us that if we compare any\npair of hypotheses \\(h_i\\) and \\(h_j\\) on an evidence stream \\(c^n\\)\nthat contains at least \\(m = 19\\) observations or experiments, where\neach has a likelihood \\(\\delta \\ge .10\\) of yielding a falsifying\noutcome, then the likelihood (on \\(h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n})\\) of\nobtaining an outcome sequence \\(e^n\\) that yields likelihood-ratio\n\n \\[\\frac{P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] }{P[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]} = 0,\\]\n\n\nwill be at least as large as \\((1 - (1-.1)^{19}) = .865\\). (The reader\nis invited to try other values of \\(\\delta\\) and m.)\n\nA comment about the need for and usefulness of such\nconvergence theorems is in order, now that we\u2019ve seen one. Given\nsome specific pair of scientific hypotheses \\(h_i\\) and \\(h_j\\) one\nmay directly compute the likelihood, given \\((h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot\nc^{n})\\), that a proposed sequence of experiments or observations\n\\(c^n\\) will result in one of the sequences of outcomes that would\nyield low likelihood ratios. So, given a specific pair of hypotheses\nand a proposed sequence of experiments, we don\u2019t need a general\nConvergence Theorem to tell us the likelihood of obtaining\nrefuting evidence. The specific hypotheses \\(h_i\\) and \\(h_j\\) tell us\nthis themselves. They tell us the likelihood of obtaining\neach specific outcome stream, including those that either refute the\ncompetitor or produce a very small likelihood ratio for it.\nFurthermore, after we\u2019ve actually performed an experiment and\nrecorded its outcome, all that matters is the actual ratio of\nlikelihoods for that outcome. Convergence theorems become moot.\n\nThe point of the Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem (both the\nFalsification Theorem and the part of the theorem still to come) is to\nassure us in advance of considering any specific pair of\nhypotheses that if the possible evidence streams that test\nhypotheses have certain characteristics which reflect the empirical\ndistinctness of the two hypotheses, then it is highly likely that one\nof the sequences of outcomes will occur that yields a very small\nlikelihood ratio. These theorems provide finite lower bounds on how\nquickly such convergence is likely to be. Thus, they show that the\n CoA\n is satisfied in advance of our using the logic to test specific pairs\nof hypotheses against one another.\n",
