    "main_text": "\n\nConsider the following claim: the truck drivers are engaged in a labor\nstrike in virtue of picketing. What sort of claim is this? Well, it\nseems clear what sort of claim it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t an\nidentity claim. For example, the property of striking isn\u2019t\nidentical to the property of picketing, as there are different ways of\nstriking, such as carefully following all safety regulations so as to\nimpede productivity. It isn\u2019t a causal claim either, at least if\nby causation we mean what we normally mean when we use the\nterm. The causes of the strike concern not the picketing of the\ntruckers but, instead, antecedent events such as how their employer\nhas allotted payroll deductions and benefits. Finally, the claim\nisn\u2019t purely modal in character either\u2014it isn\u2019t\nmerely the claim that there is a necessary connection between\npicketing and striking. Perhaps this behavior together with the\nsatisfaction of other conditions suffices for there to be a labor\nstrike, but the former suffices for any number of things, such as the\nfact that \\(2+2=4\\).\n\nWhat sort of claim is it, then? Some suggest that this and similar\nclaims are grounding claims, where grounding is understood to\nbe a form of constitutive (as opposed to causal or probabilistic)\ndetermination or explanation. The point of departure for theorizing\nabout grounding is that there are a variety of claims\u2014claims we\nmake in ordinary life as well as ones we make in the context of doing\nphilosophy\u2014that are best interpreted as being claims about what\ngrounds what. As for metaphysics in particular, some claim that\ngrounding plays a central role in the enterprise properly conceived.\nSchaffer, for example, writes that \u201cmetaphysics as I understand\nit is about what grounds what\u201d rather than what exists (2009:\n379). And, according to Fine, questions about what grounds what are\ncentral to what he calls realist metaphysics, which concerns\nnot just the nature of things but whether they are real;\n\u201cIndeed\u201d, Fine writes, \u201cif considerations of ground\nwere abolished, then very little of the subject would remain\u201d\n(2012a: 41).\n\nWe begin by addressing some preliminary issues, including how best to\nformulate grounding claims. Then we address the following general\nquestions: What is the nature of grounding? Why think that there is\ngrounding in the first place? And how does grounding interact with\nother notions of philosophical interest, such as necessity?\n",
