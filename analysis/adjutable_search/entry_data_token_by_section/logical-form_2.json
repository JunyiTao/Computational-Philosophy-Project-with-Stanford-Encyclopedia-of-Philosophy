    "main_text": "Motivations for Revision\n3. Motivations for Revision\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century, Kant could say (without\nmuch exaggeration) that logic had followed a single path since its\ninception, and that \u201csince Aristotle it has not had to retrace a\nsingle step.\u201d He also said that syllogistic logic was \u201cto\nall appearance complete and perfect.\u201d But this was exuberance.\nThe successes also highlighted problems that had been recognized.\n\nSome valid schemata are reducible to others, in that any inference of\nthe reducible form can be revealed as valid (with a little work) given\nother schemata. Consider (9).\n\n(9)\nIf Al ran then either Al did not run or Bob did not\nswim, and Al ran; so Bob did not swim.\n\n\nAssume that \u2018Al did not run\u2019 negates \u2018Al ran\u2019,\nwhile \u2018Bob did not swim\u2019 negates \u2018Bob swam\u2019.\nThen (9) is an instance of the following valid form: if\nA then either not-A or\nnot-B, and A; so\nnot-B. But we can treat this as a derived form, by\nshowing that any instance of this form is valid given two (intuitively\nmore basic) Stoic inference forms: if the first then\nthe second, and the first, so\nthe second; either not the first or\nnot the second, and the first; so\nnot the second. For suppose we are given the\nfollowing premises: A; and if A,\nthen either not-A or not-B. We can\nsafely infer that either not-A or\nnot-B; and since we were given A, we\ncan safely infer not-B. Similarly, the syllogistic\nschema (10) can be treated as a derived form.\n\n(10)\nSome S is not P, and every\nD is P; so not every S is D.\n\n\nIf some S is not P, and every D is\nP, then it isn\u2019t true that every S is\nD. For if every S is D, and every\nD is P, then every S is P. But\nif some S is not P, then as we saw above,\nnot every S is P. So given the premises of (10),\nadding \u2018every S is D\u2019 would lead to\ncontradiction: every S is P, and not every\nS is P. So the premises imply the negation of\n\u2018every S is D\u2019. This reasoning shows how\n(10) can be reduced to inferential patterns that seem more\nbasic\u2014raising the question of how much reduction is possible.\nEuclid\u2019s geometry had provided a model for how to present a body\nof knowledge as a network of propositions that follow from a few basic\naxioms. Aristotle himself indicated how to reduce all the valid\nsyllogistic schemata to four basic patterns, given a few principles\nthat govern how the basic patterns can be used to derive others; see\nParsons (2014) for discussion. And further reduction is possible given\ninsights from the medieval period.\n\nConsider the following pair of valid inferences: Fido is a brown dog,\nso Fido is a dog; Fido is not a dog, so Fido is not a brown dog. As\nillustrated with the first example, replacing a predicate (or general\nterm) like \u2018brown dog\u2019 with a less restrictive\npredicate like \u2018dog\u2019 is often valid. But\nsometimes\u2014paradigmatically, in cases involving\nnegation\u2014replacing a predicate like \u2018dog\u2019 with a\nmore restrictive predicate like \u2018brown dog\u2019 is\nvalid. Plausibly, the first pattern reflects the default direction of\nvalid replacement: removing a restriction preserves truth, except in\nspecial cases like those involving negation. Suppose we take it as\ngiven that poodles are dogs of a particular sort, and hence that every\npoodle is a dog. Then replacing\u2018poodle\u2019 with\n\u2018dog\u2019 in \u2018Fido is P\u2019 is valid,\nregardless of what \u2018Fido\u2019 names. This can be viewed as a\nspecial case of \u2018n is P, and every P\nis D; so n is D\u2019. But the validity of\nthis inference form can also be viewed as symptom of a basic principle\nthat came be called dictum de omni: whatever is true of every\nP is true of any P. Or as Aristotle might have put\nit, if the property of being a dog belongs to every poodle, then it\nbelongs to any poodle. In which case, Fido is a dog if Fido is a\npoodle. And since the property of being a dog surely belongs to every\nbrown dog, any brown dog is a dog. The flip side of this point is that\nnegation inverts the default direction of inference. Anything that\nisn\u2019t a dog isn\u2019t a brown dog; and similarly, if Fido\nisn\u2019t a dog, then Fido isn\u2019t a poodle. So in special\ncases, adding a restriction to a general term like \u2018dog\u2019\ncan preserve truth.\n\nFrom this perspective, the Aristotelian quantifier \u2018Some\u2019\nis a default-style quantifier that validates removing\nrestrictions. If some brown dog is a clever mutt, it follows that some\ndog is a clever mutt, and hence that some dog is a mutt. By contrast,\n\u2018No\u2019 is an inverted-style quantifier that validates\nadding restrictions. If no dog is a mutt, it follows that no\ndog is a clever mutt, and hence that no brown dog is a clever mutt.\nThe corresponding principle, dictum de nullo, encodes this\npattern: whatever is true of no P is not true of any\nP; so if the property of being a mutt belongs to no dog, it\nbelongs to no poodle. (And as Aristotle noted, instances of \u2018No\nS is P\u2019 can be analyzed as the propositional\nnegations of corresponding instances of \u2018Some S\nisn\u2019t P\u2019.)\n\nInterestingly, \u2018Every\u2019 is like \u2018No\u2019 in one\nrespect, and like \u2018Some\u2019 in another respect. If every dog\nis clever, it follows that every brown dog is clever; but if every dog\nis a clever mutt, it follows that every dog is a mutt. So when the\nuniversal quantifier combines with a general term S to form a\nsubject, S is governed by the inverted rule of\nreplacement. But when a universally quantified subject combines with a\nsecond general term to form a proposition, this second term is\ngoverned by the default rule of replacement. Given that\n\u2018Every\u2019 has this mixed logical character, the valid\nsyllogisms can be derived from two basic patterns (noted above), both\nof which reflect dictum de omni: whatever is true of every\nP is true of any P.\n\n\nEvery S is P, and every P is D; so\nevery S is D.\n\nEvery S is P, and some D is S; so\nsome D is P.\n\n\nThe first principle reflects the sense in which universal\nquantification is transitive. The second principle captures the idea\nthat the universal premise can license replacement of\n\u2018S\u2019 with \u2018P\u2019 in a\nproposition about some individual. In this sense, classical logic\nexhibits a striking unity and simplicity, at least with regard to\ninferences involving the Aristotelian quantifiers and predication. For\nfurther discussion, see Sommers (1984), van Bentham (1986), Sanchez\n(1991, 1994), and Ludlow (2005).\n\nAlas, matters become more complicated once we consider relations.\n\nSentences like \u2018Juliet kissed Romeo\u2019 do not seem to have\nSubject-copula-Predicate form. One might suggest \u2018Juliet was a\nkisser of Romeo\u2019 as a paraphrase. But \u2018kisser of\nRomeo\u2019 differs, in ways that matter to inference, from general\nterms like \u2018politician\u2019. If Juliet (or anyone) was a\nkisser of Romeo, it follows that someone was kissed; whereas if Juliet\nwas a politician, there is no corresponding logical consequence to the\neffect that someone was __-ed. Put another way, the proposition that\nJuliet kissed someone exhibits interesting logical structure, even if\nwe can express this proposition via the sentence \u2018Juliet was a\nkisser of someone\u2019. A quantifier can be part of a complex\npredicate. But classical logic did not capture the validity of\ninferences involving predicates that have quantificational\nconstituents. Consider (11).\n\n(11)\nSome patient respects every doctor, and some doctor\nis a liar; so some patient respects some liar.\n\n\nIf \u2018respects every doctor\u2019 and \u2018respects some\nliar\u2019 indicate nonrelational proposition-parts, much like\n\u2018is sick\u2019 or \u2018is happy\u2019, then inference (11)\nhas the following form \u2018Some P is S, and some\nD is L; so some P is H\u2019. But\nthis schema, which fails to reflect the quantificational structure\nwithin the predicates is not valid. Its instances include bad\ninferences like the following: some patient is sick, and some doctor\nis a liar; so some patient is happy. This dramatizes the point that\n\u2018respects every doctor\u2019 and \u2018respects some\nliar\u2019 are\u2014unlike \u2018is sick\u2019 and \u2018is\ntall\u2019\u2014logically related in a way that matters given the\nsecond premise of (11).\n\nOne can adopt the view that many propositions have relational parts,\nintroducing a variable \u2018R\u2019 intended to range over\nrelations; see the entries on\n medieval relations,\n and\n medieval terms.\n One can also formulate the following schema: some P R\nevery D, and some D is L; so some\nP R some L. But the problem remains.\nQuantifiers can appear in complex predicates that figure in valid\ninferences like (12).\n\n(12)\nEvery patient who respects every doctor is sick,\nand\n\nsome patient who saw every lawyer respects every doctor; so\n\nsome patient who saw every lawyer is sick.\n\n\nBut if \u2018patient who respects every doctor\u2019 and\n\u2018patient who saw every lawyer\u2019 are nonrelational, much\nlike \u2018old patient\u2019 or \u2018young patient\u2019, then\n(12) has the following form: every O is S, and some\nY R every D; so some Y is\nS. And many inferences of this form are invalid. For example:\nevery otter is sick, and some yak respects every doctor; so some yak\nis sick. Again, one can abstract a valid schema that covers (12),\nletting parentheses indicate a relative clause that restricts the\nadjacent predicate.\n\nEvery P(R1 every D) is S, and some\nP(R2 every L) R1 every D; so\nsome P(R2 every L) is S.\n\n\nBut no matter how complex the schema, the relevant predicates can\nexhibit further quantificational structure. (Consider the proposition\nthat every patient who met some doctor who saw no lawyer\nrespects some lawyer who saw no patient who met every\ndoctor.) Moreover, schemata like the one above are poor\ncandidates for basic inference patterns.\n\nAs medieval logicians knew, propositions expressed with relative\nclauses also pose other difficulties; see the entry on\n medieval syllogism.\n If every doctor is healthy, it follows that every young doctor is\nhealthy. By itself, this is expected, since a universally quantified\nsubject licenses replacement of \u2018doctor\u2019 with the more\nrestrictive predicate \u2018young doctor\u2019. But consider (13)\nand (14).\n\n(13)\nNo patient who saw every young doctor is\nhealthy.\n(14)\nNo patient who saw every doctor is healthy.\n\n\nHere, the direction of valid inference is from \u2018young\ndoctor\u2019 to \u2018doctor\u2019, as if the inference is governed\nby the (default) inference rule that licenses replacement of\n\u2018young doctor\u2019 with the less restrictive predicate\n\u2018doctor\u2019. One can say that the default direction of\nimplication, from more restrictive to less restrictive predicates, has\nbeen inverted twice\u2014once by \u2018No\u2019, and once by\n\u2018every\u2019. But one wants a systematic account of\npropositional structure that explains the net effect; see Ludlow\n(2002) for further discussion. Sommers (1982) offers a strategy for\nrecoding and extending classical logic, in part by exploiting an idea\nsuggested by\n Leibniz\n (and arguably P\u0101\u1e47ini): a relational sentence like\n\u2018Juliet loved Romeo\u2019 somehow combines an active-voice\nsentence with a passive-voice sentence, perhaps along the lines of\n\u2018Juliet loved, and thereby Romeo was loved\u2019; cp.\n section nine.\n But one way or another, quantifiers need to be characterized in a way\nthat captures their general logical role\u2014and not just their role\nas potential subjects of Aristotelian propositions\u2014if\nimpeccability is to be revealed as a matter of form. Quantifiers are\nnot simply devices for creating schemata like \u2018Every S\nis P\u2019, into which general terms like\n\u2018politician\u2019 and \u2018deceitful\u2019 can be inserted.\nInstances of \u2018S\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019 can\nthemselves have quantificational structure and relational\nconstituents.\n",
