The Objectivity of Thought and the Concept of Certainty\n\n\nRosmini sets out to establish the nature of thought and certainty in\nhis A New Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas. Faced by the\ncritical philosophy of Kant on the one hand, and by British empiricism\non the other, Rosmini reaches back to the pre-Socratics, to Plato and\nAristotle, to Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, in an\nendeavour to establish the nature of thought and the basis of certainty\nin human existence. As his guiding principles he takes the following\nrules:\nIn explaining facts connected with the human spirit, we\nmust not make fewer assumptions than are required to explain them...\n[nor must we] make more assumptions than are needed to explain the\nfacts (NE, vol. 1, 26\u20137).\n\n\nWith this as his methodological foundation, he places Locke,\nCondillac, Reid and Dugald Stewart among those whose explanation of the\nfact of thought is deficient; Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz and Kant are\nlisted amongst those whose explanation is in many ways excessive. In\nother words, he distinguishes between sensationalists who, according to\nhim, cannot explain the origin of ideas, and idealists who posit in\ntheir explanation more ideas or forms than are necessary. For him,\nhowever, human thought must depend upon the innate idea of being,\nwithout which nothing is intelligible. We cannot think of what is not.\nAt the same time, nothing more is needed than the single idea of being,\nand its possible determinations, brought about through sensation, to\nexplain all intellectual principles and the ramifications of\nthought.\n3.1 Objectivity\n\n\nAfter observing the fact of thought, Rosmini concludes that its\nabsolute basis, without which nothing is thought and thought is\nnothing, must be the knowledge of being. Reflection can remove\neverything from thought, and still leave it embryonically sound\nprovided the mind is granted the idea of being as its governing light.\nThis idea, which possesses the divine attributes of universality,\ninfinity, necessity and possibility, is not God himself but merely the\npossibility of things. Moreover, it acts in the mind, but without\nbecoming a subjective part of the mind. As intellectual light, it\nilluminates, but from outside the mind. And it illuminates without\nrevealing its source, as natural light can be seen without our looking\nat the sun. It is, as Dante would say, \u2018the light connecting\nintellect and truth\u2019 (Purgatorio 6: 45) and, as such, is\nthe quasi-form of the intellect and the image of truth. Determinations\nof this idea, all of which possess in some way the characteristics of\nbeing, especially its objectivity, are provided through sensations\nexperienced in the animal part of human existence and illuminated,\nbeing-wise, through the innate idea in which they are seen. Of\nthemselves, sensations do not constitute knowledge but, when felt in\nthe human subject, provide the matter of knowledge which determines the\nidea of being, that is, the form of knowledge. Knowledge consists first\nin the intuition of being, the universal, and then in a subsequent\nseries of judgments, or direct perceptions, through which knowing\nsubjects affirm the actual existence of what they have experienced\nsensationally. These direct perceptions cannot err, although reflection\nupon them, and a subsequent series of judgments, may be the source of\nerror. In a word, Rosmini holds that basic knowledge, consisting of the\nidea of being and its immediate determinations, provides all that is\nneeded for objective thought. Against idealists, he reduces the formal\nrequirements of thought to the intuition of being; against\nsensationalists, he maintains the per se inadequacy of the\nsenses to provide more than the matter of thought.\n3.2 Certainty\n\n\nObjectivity, therefore, is essentially a characteristic of what is\nknown. Certainty, in Rosmini\u2019s view, is a characteristic of the person\nwho knows, and can be defined as \u2018a firm and reasonable persuasion\nthat conforms to the truth\u2019 (NE, vol. 3, 1044). In other\nwords, we can be certain only of knowledge, not of error, and this\nbecause, according to Rosmini, to know and to know the truth is the\nsame thing. The person who does not know the truth, does not know.\nThere is no doubt, of course, that it is possible to be persuaded, and\nfirmly persuaded, of error. But rational persuasion of error arrived at\nthrough one\u2019s own reasoning is not possible. In this case, either the\npremiss is wrong, or the argument is erroneous. On the other hand, the\npersuasion must be firm. Certainty is not achieved without energy\ndirected into persuasion. Certainty requires that we know something to\nbe true, to be what it is, that we are persuaded that it is what we\nknow it to be, and that we have an adequate reason for our persuasion.\nAnd precisely because error attempts to alter the being of things,\nformal error will not be found rooted in the intellect nor in the\nsenses nor in involuntary reflection. It begins with the will, the only\nhuman faculty capable of drawing the reason to invent what it does not\nsee, or to deny what it sees. Under pressure from the will, reason will\nfalsely affirm that being is not, or deny that being is.\n",
