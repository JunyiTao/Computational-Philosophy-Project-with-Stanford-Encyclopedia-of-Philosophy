Three possible answers to this question are:\nwelfare; capabilities; and resources.\n\nThe first position suggests that what we should be aiming for in\nenacting a social minimum is a minimum of welfare for all.\n\u201cWelfare\u201d here is understood in one of two ways. In\nclassical Utilitarian thinking, pioneered by Jeremy Bentham, welfare\nrefers to happiness which, in turn, is understood as the net balance\nof pleasure over pain that the individual experiences (Bentham 1789).\nOn this view, in assessing how well off someone is in life, we should\nlook at how happy they are, that is, at the net balance of pleasure\nover pain in their life. In more recent economic writings, welfare is\nidentified with desire-satisfaction; people have more or less welfare,\nand so have better or worse lives in a fundamental sense, depending on\nhow far they satisfy their desires.\n\nWelfarism has been subject to compelling criticism. While we do not\nhave the space here to review the critique of welfarism in depth, two\napparent problems may be noted. One is the problem of adaptive\npreferences. If people are born into deprived circumstances, then they\nmight adjust their expectations so that they are satisfied with their\nlot. Even though they are poor, they are happy, or don\u2019t suffer\nfrom much frustration of desire, because they have adapted to life in\nwhich they have few resources at their command. But, as Amartya Sen\nasks of a person in this situation,\n\n\nCan we possibly believe that he is doing well just because he is happy\nand satisfied? Can the living standard of a person be high if the life\nthat he or she leads is full of deprivation? (Sen 1987a: 8)\n\n\nAnother problem, according to the critics, is that it is wrong to\nthink that all that has fundamental value in a human life is how much\nhappiness or desire-satisfaction this life contains. Being happy is a\nvaluable achievement, to be sure; but critics argue that it is hardly\nthe only thing that matters, in a fundamental way, for how well our\nlives are going (Sen 1987b, 1992, 1999, 2009: chapters\n11\u201314).\n\nThese two thoughts have inspired a second position on how we should\nconceive of the ultimate focus of distributional concern. Pioneered by\nthe economist, Amartya Sen, this is known as the capability\napproach. Sen\u2019s analysis starts with a definition of a person\u2019s\nwell-being as constituted by the \u201cfunctionings\u201d that they\nachieve:\n\n\n\u2026 beings and doings [which]\u2026can vary from such\nelementary things as being adequately nourished, being in good health,\navoiding escapable morbidity and premature mortality, etc., to more\ncomplex achievements such as being happy, having self-respect, taking\npart in the life of the community, and so on. (Sen 1992: 39)\n\n\nNote that \u201cfunctionings\u201d here include welfarist concerns,\nsuch as \u201cbeing happy\u201d, but are not confined to such\nconcerns. A person\u2019s capability is then defined by Sen as\ntheir power to achieve functionings: \u201ca set of vectors of\nfunctionings, reflecting the person\u2019s freedom to lead one type of life\nor another\u201d (Sen 1992: 40). On Sen\u2019s view, then, we should\nassess how well off a person is by looking at how far they possess a\nrange of important capabilities. These might include a capability for\nwelfare in either or both senses defined above, but will not be\nrestricted to this one capability. A social minimum is understood as\nthe bundle of resources necessary to endow people with a decent basic\nrange and level of capabilities in this sense.\n\nThe challenge for advocates of the capabilities approach, however, is\nthen to explain which functionings and capabilities matter in\na fundamental way. What capabilities ought to feature on our list when\nwe come to make assessments of how well off people are? The worry is\nthat any list we draw up will reflect one rather specific, perhaps\nsectarian understanding of what gives value and meaning to life, an\nunderstanding that other people might reasonably reject. In short, the\nworry is that the capabilities approach will either be too abstract to\nbe of any use, or else will be insufficiently neutral as\nbetween different reasonable ethical conceptions (conceptions, that\nis, of what gives value and meaning to life).\n\nThis concern, combined with the aforementioned concerns about\nwelfarism, motivates a third view about how to conceive what is of\nultimate concern in assessing economic distributions:\nresourcism. Resourcism reflects the concern to try to find an\nappropriately neutral way of assessing the respective advantage in\nlife enjoyed by different people. The idea is that although reasonable\npeople disagree about what gives life fundamental value and meaning,\nthey can nevertheless agree that it is important to hold certain\n\u201call-purpose means\u201d for the pursuit of whatever plans of\nlife they have (see, for example, Rawls 1993: 187\u2013190). In the\nsimplest imaginable version of resourcism, we might focus solely on\nthe level of income and/or wealth someone has in making a judgment\nabout how well off they are in a fundamental sense.\n\nThe problem with resourcism, however, is that it looks potentially\n\u201cfetishistic\u201d (Sen 1992): it asks us, in its simplest\nform, to focus on resource holdings\u2014income/wealth\u2014without\nconsidering what different people can do or be in virtue of these\nholdings. Individuals\u2019 needs differ, e.g., due to differences in\nhealth conditions. Resourcism, at least in its most straightforward\nform, seems not to take account of this variability. Sen and others\nargue that it is a merit of the capability approach that it is\nsensitive to these differences \u2013 the approach advises that individuals\nmight require different amounts of resources to achieve a given level\nof capability. Ronald Dworkin\u2019s theory of \u2018equality of resources\u2019 can\nbe seen as trying to address this problem by, in effect, regarding\ndifferences in needs as a kind of difference in \u2018resources\u2019 (for\nexample, a person who needs more income to achieve something due to a\nhealth condition is said to have fewer \u2018resources\u2019 by virtue of this\nhealth condition and therefore as a candidate for getting additional\nincome). However, and putting aside other objections to this theory,\none can ask whether it is ultimately just using the language of\n\u2018resources\u2019 to try to talk about what Sen calls capabilities. It seems\nbetter to talk explicitly in terms of capabilities (see also\nOosterlaken 2020 for a discussion of the resourcist-capability\ntheorist debate). \n",
