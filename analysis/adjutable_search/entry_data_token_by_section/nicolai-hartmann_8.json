It is not just the theory of\ncategories, but the theory of strata (\u201clevels of reality\u201d)\nthat distinguishes Hartmann\u2019s ontology. Like everything else,\nstrata of reality are characterized by their categories. By\ndefinition, the categories characterizing strata of reality are not\ngeneral, in the sense that they do not pertain to reality in its\nentirety, but only to specific domains of real being. On the other\nhand, fundamental categories are the most general and simple\ncategories, and for this reason they are contained in the special\ncategories of all of the strata (A21b). Strata are the true\nstructuring framework of the real world. While the latter has unity,\nits unity is the unity of neither a principle nor a center. The unity\nof the real world is instead provided by the structure and order of\nthe strata (A52a).\n\nFour main strata of reality are distinguished by Hartmann: the\ninanimate, the biological, the psychological or mental, and the\nspiritual. This last includes all historical realities (history,\nlanguage, customs, law, art, etc.). The underlying observation is that\nthe structure and the laws of history and other spiritual processes\nare different from the structure and laws of, say, inanimate beings,\nbut the former are not in any way less real than the latter (A20a).\nThe same applies to the other strata as well: biological and\npsychological processes are as real as any other process, and they\nhave their own specific groups of categories. Ontology must be\npluralistic.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Hartmann\u2019s theory of\nstrata is the question of what kinds of relation connect the strata to\neach other. Two general relations seem to govern strata relations, and\nthese are further specified by the \u201ccategorial laws.\u201d The\ntwo basic relations between strata are termed relations of\nsuperformation (\u00dcberformung) and superposition\n(\u00dcberbauung) (A51f). Consider the superformation between\nmolecules and cells, i.e., between the physical and the biological\nlevels of reality. It accounts for the fact that even if organisms are\nunquestionably more complex than mechanisms, the behavior of organisms\nis in conformity with laws of mechanics (A51b). At the same time,\nmechanical regularities are superformed by being incorporated into\norganic ones. The relation between the psychological and spiritual\nlevels is different, because they are characterized by an interruption\nin the categorial series and by the onset of a new categorial\ncoherence. The relations between the biological and the psychological\nstratum, on the one hand, and the relation between the psychological\nand the spiritual stratum, on the other, are both relations of\nsuperposition. The group of categories embedded in psychological\nentities is different from the group of categories embedded in\nbiological entities. Similarly, the group of categories embedded in\nspiritual entities is different from the group of categories embedded\nin psychological entities.\n\nHartmann specifies analytically the laws that govern the various\nlevels of reality and their connection (for a short introduction see\nNW; for a summary of the laws, see Poli 2011a and Peterson 2012). The\nlaws of validity concern the scope of the validity of\ncategorial principles (A43a), and the laws of coherence\nconcern the holistic character of each stratum (A45b). If we take a\nsimple organism as object of inquiry, for example, biological\ncategories rather than physical or mental ones are primarily valid,\nand these saturate the organism with specifically organological forms\nof determination, no more (such as teleology) and no less (such as\nphysical causality). Moreover, if we claim that metabolism belongs to\na proper understanding of the organism, then aspects of every other\ncategory of organic life are entailed in it as well, codetermining and\ningredient in it. With these two sets of principles, he has covered\nthe internal coherence and determination within a stratum. These laws\ntogether imply a degree of incommensurability of categorial domains to\none another, but given the all-pervasiveness of the fundamental\ncategories, this substantive incommensurability is never total.\nRelations between different strata are captured in the last two sets\nof structural laws.\n\nThe laws of stratification can be summed up in four key\nterms: recurrence, modification, novelty, and distance. Some lower\ncategories recur in higher strata as partial aspects of higher\ncategories, and every recurring category is modified in its\nrecurrence. Whenever a lower element is taken into the higher it is\naffected by its new place in relation to others in the new stratum.\nThese two principles constitute a vertical interconnectedness of the\nstrata. While the categories of causality and substance, for example,\nappear to us initially in discussion of physical things, they recur\nmodified in the domain of the organic. Because categories are not\nsimples but complexes of factors, some of those factors may remain\nstable while others are modified, constituting the recurrence of the\nsame but non-identical category. These recurrences have to be shown in\neach case, and one of the tasks of categorial analysis is tracing the\nmodifications of a single category throughout the strata. Next, every\nstratum contains is own unique and novel categories that are not\npresent in the lower stratum, nor are they a sum of them. Finally,\nrecurrence, modification, and novelty imply that there is not a\ncontinuous series of levels, but gaps or incisions between them. The\nlast two laws of novelty and distance are what give the impression of\nthe ontological irreducibility of the strata (A50b). For instance,\nwhile the category of metabolism in the organic may necessarily\nincorporate some aspects of linear causal process, it is itself a\ndistinctive kind of process that is irreducible to them. Thus,\nrecurrence and novelty respectively reflect the aspects of continuity\nand discontinuity among the strata. Categorial novelty inserts an\nincision or cut into the apparent continuum of categories, creating a\ndistance or gap between strata. The laws of dependence can\nalso be summed up in four terms: strength, indifference, matter, and\nfreedom. The \u201cfundamental categorial law\u201d of strength says\nthat the lower categories on which higher strata depend are conditions\nor fundaments, while the higher are weaker. The lower are indifferent\nto whether anything higher builds on them or not, since their vocation\nis not to serve the higher. As \u201cmatter,\u201d the lower\ncategories, if incorporated into higher levels, constrain what the\nhigher may do with them but do not determine it. Lastly, the higher\nalways has leeway despite its weakness and dependence on the lower\n(A55d). Laws of dependence help to characterize superposition\nrelations. They organize the order of the strata, so that the\nspiritual level is founded on the psychological level, which in its\nturn is founded on the biological one. Conversely, the biological\nlevel is the bearer of the psychological level and the latter is the\nbearer of the spiritual level.\n",
