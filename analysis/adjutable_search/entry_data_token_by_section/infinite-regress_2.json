Sometimes, the\ntheoretical vice in question will be a global one: a feature that is a\nreason to reject any theory that has it. Yielding a contradiction is,\nrelatively\n uncontroversially[3],\n such a vice. Other times, the feature in question might be a local\nvice: a feature that might be an unobjectionable feature of certain\ntheories, but a reason to reject a particular theory \\(T\\) because of\nthe particular theoretical ambitions of \\(T\\) or as a result of other\nthings we know about \\(T\\)\u2019s subject matter.\n\nFor example, a theory might result in an infinite regress of entities\nand so entail that there are infinitely many things. This in itself\nis, arguably, not objectionable. But it might be a local vice to a\ntheory if we have independent reason to think that we are dealing with\na finite domain. (See Nolan 2001, 531\u2013532, and Nolan 2019.)\n(Some philosophers object to the very idea of reality containing\ninfinities. Aristotle, e.g., famously allowed that there could be\npotential infinite series, but not completed\ninfinite series. (See Mendel 2017.)) But we will ignore such general\nanti-infinitism in this entry, for it is infinity itself that such\ntheorists take to be objectionable, not infinite regresses per\nse.)\n\nPeano\u2019s axioms for arithmetic, e.g., yield an infinite regress.\nWe are told that zero is a natural number, that every natural number\nhas a natural number as a successor, that zero is not the successor of\nany natural number, and that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are natural numbers\nwith the same successor, then \\(x = y\\). This yields an infinite\nregress. Zero has a successor. It cannot be zero, since zero is not\nany natural number\u2019s successor, so it must be a new natural\nnumber: one. One must have a successor. It cannot be zero, as before,\nnor can it be one itself, since then zero and one would have the same\nsuccessor and hence be identical, and we have already said they must\nbe distinct. So there must be a new natural number that is the\nsuccessor of one: two. Two must have a successor: three. And so on\n\u2026 And this infinite regress entails that there are infinitely\nmany things of a certain kind: natural numbers. But few have found\nthis worrying. After all, there is no independent reason to think that\nthe domain of natural numbers is finite\u2014quite the opposite.\n\nBy contrast, consider the following two principles: (i) Every event is\npreceded by another event that is its cause; (ii) The relation \\(x\\)\nprecedes \\(y\\) is irreflexive (nothing precedes itself),\nasymmetric (if \\(a\\) precedes \\(b\\) then \\(b\\) does not precede \\(a\\))\nand transitive (if \\(a\\) precedes \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) precedes \\(c\\) then\n\\(a\\) precedes \\(c\\)).\n\nThis yields an infinite regress, at least from the assumption that\nthere is at least one event. If there is an event, \\(E_1\\), then it is\npreceded by its cause. That cause cannot be \\(E_1\\), as nothing\nprecedes itself and causes precede what they cause. So the cause of\n\\(E_1\\) must be a new event, \\(E_2\\). This event is preceded by its\ncause. This cannot be \\(E_2\\) for the same reasons as before, and it\ncannot be \\(E_1\\) because then each of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) would\nprecede the other in violation of asymmetry. So the cause of \\(E_2\\)\nmust be a new event, \\(E_3\\). \\(E_3\\) is preceded by its cause. It\ncannot be \\(E_3\\) or \\(E_2\\) for reasons similar to before. And it\ncannot be \\(E_1\\), for then \\(E_1\\) would precede \\(E_3\\), but since\n\\(E_3\\) precedes \\(E_2\\) which precedes \\(E_1\\), transitivity entails\nthat \\(E_3\\) precedes \\(E_1\\), and so \\(E_1\\) cannot precede \\(E_3\\)\ndue to asymmetry. So the cause of \\(E_3\\) must be a new event,\n\\(E_4\\). And so on \u2026\n\nThis regress of events is very similar to the regress of natural\nnumbers. In each case we start from the claim that there is a thing of\na certain kind (a number or an event), and we have a principle that\ntells us that for each thing of that kind, there is another thing of\nthat very kind that bears a certain relation to the previous one (it\nis its successor, or it is its preceding cause). We then have\nsupplementary principles that rule out the other thing of that kind\nbeing any of the things on our list so far, thus forcing us to\nintroduce a new thing of that kind, thus inviting the application of\nthe principles to this new thing, and so on ad infinitum. But\nwhile the regress and resulting infinity of natural numbers is\narguably unobjectionable, the regress of events seems problematic,\nbecause we have good empirical reasons to deny that there are\ninfinitely many events, each preceded by another. For either that\ninfinite sequence of events takes place in a finite amount of time or\nan infinite one. We have good empirical reason to rule out the latter\noption, since we have good empirical reason to think that there has\nonly been a finite amount of past time: that time started a finite\ntime ago with the Big Bang. And we have good empirical reason to rule\nout the former option, since the only way of fitting an infinite\nseries of events, each preceded by another, into a finite stretch of\ntime is by having the time between them become arbitrarily small. So\nfor example, \\(A_2\\) might be a minute before \\(A_1\\), and \\(A_3\\)\nhalf a minute before \\(A_2\\), and \\(A_4\\) a quarter of a minute before\n\\(A_3\\), etc. If the time between events \\(A_n\\) and \\(A_{n + 1}\\) is\nalways half the time between events \\(A_{n - 1}\\) and \\(A_n\\), we can\nfit infinitely many events into a two minute time-period. But this\nrequires the time between events to become arbitrarily small, and\nthere is some reason to think that time is quantized, such that there\nis a minimum length of time during which a change can occur, thus\nproviding a lower limit on the amount of time that can separate two\ntemporally distant events. (See Nolan 2008b for relevant discussion\nand further references.)\n\nSo while the numbers regress and the events regress are structurally\nanalogous, we might find the principles that yield the regress\nobjectionable in one case but not the other, because while each\nregress entails that there are infinitely many things of kind \\(K\\),\nwhether that is a vice may depend on what kind \\(K\\) is, and whether\nwe have independent reason to think that the domain of \\(K\\)s is a\nfinite one. Yielding infinitely many things of kind \\(K\\) might be a\nlocal vice when the kind in question is events separated in time, but\nnot when the kind in question is natural numbers structured by the\nsuccessor relation.\n",
