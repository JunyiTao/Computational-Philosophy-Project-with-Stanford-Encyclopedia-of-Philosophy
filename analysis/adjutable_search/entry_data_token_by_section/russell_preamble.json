    "main_text": "\n\nBertrand Arthur William Russell (1872\u20131970) was a British\nphilosopher, logician, essayist and social critic best known for his\nwork in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. His most\ninfluential contributions include his championing of logicism (the\nview that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic),\nhis refining of\n Gottlob Frege\u2019s\n predicate calculus (which still forms the basis of most contemporary\nsystems of logic), his defense of\n neutral monism\n (the view that the world consists of just one type of substance which\nis neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical), and his\ntheories of\n definite descriptions,\n logical atomism and\n logical types.\n \n\nTogether with\n G.E. Moore,\n Russell is generally recognized as one of the founders of modern\nanalytic philosophy. His famous\n paradox,\n theory of types and work with\n A.N. Whitehead\n on\n Principia Mathematica\n invigorated the study of logic throughout the twentieth century\n(Schilpp 1944, xiii; Wilczek 2010, 74). In the public mind, he was \nfamous as much for his evangelical atheism as for his contributions to\ntechnical philosophy.\n\nOver the course of a long career, Russell also made important\ncontributions to a broad range of other subjects, including\n ethics,\n politics, educational theory and religious\nstudies, cheerfully ignoring Hooke\u2019s admonition to the Royal\nSociety against \u201cmeddling with Divinity, Metaphysics, Moralls,\nPoliticks, Grammar, Rhetorick, or Logick\u201d (Kreisel 1973, 24). Generations of general readers have also benefited from his \npopular writings on a wide variety of topics in both the humanities\nand the natural sciences. Like\n Voltaire,\n to whom he has been compared (Times of London 1970, 12), he wrote\nwith style and wit and had enormous influence.\n\nAfter a life marked by controversy \u2013 including dismissals from\nboth Trinity College, Cambridge, and City College, New York \u2013\nRussell was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature in 1950. Noted also for his many spirited anti-nuclear\nprotests and for his campaign against western involvement in the\nVietnam War, Russell remained a prominent public figure until his\ndeath at the age of 97.\n\nInterested readers may listen to\n two sound clips of Russell speaking. \n",
