    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It\n2. Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It\n\n\nThe major works so far as Kant\u2019s views on the mind are concerned are\nthe monumental Critique of Pure Reason (CPR) and his little,\nlate Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, first\npublished in 1798 only six years before his death. Since the\nAnthropology was worked up from notes for popular lectures, it\nis often superficial compared to CPR. Kant\u2019s view of the mind\narose from his\n general philosophical project\n in CPR the following way. Kant aimed among other things\nto,\n\nJustify our conviction that physics, like mathematics, is a body of\nnecessary and universal truth.\nInsulate religion, including belief in immortality, and free will\nfrom the corrosive effects of this very same science.\n\n\n Kant accepted without reservation that \u201cGod, freedom and\nimmortality\u201d (1781/7, Bxxx) exist but feared that, if science\nwere relevant to their existence at all, it would provide reasons to\ndoubt that they exist. As he saw it and very fortunately, science\ncannot touch these questions. \u201cI have found it necessary to deny\nknowledge, \u2026 in order to make room for\nfaith.\u201d (Bxxx, his italics).\n\n\nLaying the foundation for pursuit of the first aim, which as he saw it\nwas no less than the aim of showing why physics is a science, was what\nled Kant to his views about how the mind works. He approached the\ngrounding of physics by asking: What are the necessary conditions of\nexperience (A96)? Put simply, he held that for our experience, and\ntherefore our minds, to be as they are, the way that our experience is\ntied together must reflect the way that, according to physics, says objects in\nthe world must be tied together. Seeing this connection also tells us\na lot about what our minds must be like.\n\n\nIn pursuit of the second aim, Kant criticized some arguments of his predecessors\n that entailed if sound that we can know more about the mind\u2019s consciousness of\nitself than Kant could allow. Mounting these criticisms led him to some extraordinarily\npenetrating ideas about our consciousness of ourselves.\n\n\nIn CPR, Kant discussed the mind only in connection with his\nmain projects, never in its own right, so his treatment is remarkably\nscattered and sketchy. As he put it, \u201cEnquiry \u2026 [into] the\npure understanding itself, its possibility and the cognitive faculties\nupon which it rests \u2026 is of great importance for my chief\npurpose, \u2026 [but] does not form an essential part of it\u201d\n(Axvii). Indeed, Kant offers no sustained, focussed discussion of the\nmind anywhere in his work except the popular Anthropology,\nwhich, as we just said, is quite superficial.\n\n\nIn addition, the two chapters of CPR in which most of\nKant\u2019s remarks on the mind occur, the chapter on the Transcendental\nDeduction (TD) and the chapter on what he called Paralogisms (faulty\narguments about the mind mounted by his predecessors) were the two\nchapters that gave him the greatest difficulty. (They contain some of\nthe most impenetrable prose ever written.) Kant completely rewrote the\nmain body of both chapters for the second edition (though not the\nintroductions, interestingly).\n\n\nIn the two editions of CPR, there are seven main\ndiscussions of the mind. The first is in the Transcendental Aesthetic,\nthe second is in what is usually called the Metaphysical Deduction (for\nthis term, see below). Then there are two discussions of it in the\nfirst-edition TD, in parts 1 to 3 of Section 2 (A98 up to A110) and in\nthe whole of Section 3\n (A115-A127)[2]\n and two more in the second-edition TD, from B129 to B140 and from\nB153 to B159, the latter seemingly added as a kind of supplement. The\nseventh and last is found in the first edition version of Kant\u2019s\nattack on the Paralogisms, in the course of which he says things of\nthe utmost interest about consciousness of and reference to\nself. (What little was retained of these remarks in the second edition\nwas moved to the completely rewritten TD.) For understanding Kant on\nthe mind and self-knowledge, the first edition of CPR is far\nmore valuable than the second edition. Kant\u2019s discussion proceeds\nthrough the following stages.\n",
