    "main_text": "Politica\n3. Politica\n\nLipsius\u2019s Politicorum sive Civilis doctrinae libri sex\n(\u201cSix Books on Politics or Civil Doctrine\u201d, 1589),\ndedicated to Count Maurice of Nassau, can be considered a sequel to\nDe constantia: \u201cjust as in On Constancy we\ninstructed citizens how to endure and obey, so here [we instruct]\nthose who rule how to govern,\u201d Lipsius stated in \u201cThe\nLetter to the Reader.\u201d In the same way that the citizen had to\nfollow reason (ratio), the ruler had to apply reason and\npolitical virtue to government, but first of all to his own life,\nsince if \u201che desires to subject all things to himself, he should\nsubject himself to reason first.\u201d\n\nDrawing on a wide range of classical sources, above all Tacitus,\nLipsius\u2019s subject in the treatise was specifically how to rule\nprincipalities. While political thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle and\nmany others had already written on this topic, they had dealt with it\nmore generally, not in relation to principalities. The one important\nexception was Machiavelli, who \u201cled his prince along the right\nway to the temple of virtue and honor,\u201d but \u201cwhile\npursuing the path of utility, he wandered from the royal road.\u201d\nThe humanist Lipsius intended to be practical but to avoid any\nconcrete and contemporary applications of the general principles he\nset out.\n\nLipsius constructed his book from quotations of ancient writers\n\u2014 in itself a humanist tour de force, enabling him to\nshow off his vast knowledge of classical literature. Montaigne\ndescribed it as \u201ca learned and carefully woven fabric.\u201d\nYet, although the treatise has been characterized as not much more\nthan a compendium of quotations, Lipsius himself emphasized that the\nPolitica was not a mere compilation. Since he had imposed\norder on the quotations, he expressed his own thought, following the\nstrict rules of Ramist logic, through the authority of the ancients.\nMoreover, in addition to classical writers, Lipsius drew on medieval\nand Renaissance political philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas, the\nSpanish scholastics, Jean Bodin and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\n\nThe Politica, divided into six books, was concerned with the\nconstruction of civil life and the state in an ethical context. The\nfirst book was devoted to an analysis of two necessary conditions:\nvirtue (virtus), which requires piety and goodness; and\nprudence (prudentia) which is dependent on use and historical\nmemory. The second book deals with the virtues of the prince as well\nas the purpose of government and its various forms. Civil concord, a\ncentral issue for Lipsius, requires everyone to submit to the will of\nthe prince, who himself must have both virtue and prudence in order to\nachieve this concord. In the third book Lipsius, in line with medieval\nand humanist mirrors of princes, focused on the distinctive virtue of\nthe prince: political prudence (prudentia civilis), for which\nhe depends both on himself and the advice of others (officials,\ncouncilors, military commanders). A prudent prince must be surrounded\nby prudent advisors. In the fourth and by far the longest book, the\nprince\u2019s own prudence (both civil and military), which must be\ncarefully developed in the light of experience, is discussed. Two\ntypes of civil prudence \u2014 the first concerned with divine\nmatters and the second with human affairs \u2014 are set out in the\nrest of Book IV. Lipsius\u2019s controversial chapters on the\ndifficult relationship of the state to the church and on religious\ntoleration \u2014 in his view, peace and unity could only be achieved\nif just one religion was allowed in any particular political community\n\u2014 provoked sharp attacks both from Protestants, especially Dirk\nVolckertsz. Coornhert, and from the Roman Inquisition, which in 1590\nplaced the Politica on the Index of Prohibited Books.\nAccording to Lipsius, the prince should not intervene in the internal\naffairs of the church, much less meddle with doctrinal issues: he had\nno \u201crights in sacred matters\u201d (ius in sacra;\nPolitica, IV.2). It was, however, his right and, indeed, duty\nto secure the unity of the church, since religious discord inevitably\nled to civil disruption and war. Those religious dissidents who were\nresponsible for the strife that was tearing Europe apart deserved no\nmercy: \u201cBurn, cut \u2014 for the whole body [of the state] is\nof greater value than some of its limbs\u201d (Lipsius took this\nprovocative medical metaphor from Cicero). On the other hand,\ndissidents who practiced their faith quietly and peacefully were to be\ntreated with toleration. In Books V and VI of the Politica,\nwhich dealt with military prudence, Lipsius explored issues concerning\ndefense, the just war (bellum iustum), discipline and civil\nconflicts.\n\nLipsius\u2019s Politica, written in the heated atmosphere of\ncivil wars and radical attempts at religious reform, can be seen as an\nattempt to produce a synthesis between the traditional mirror of\nprinces, a popular genre among humanists, and Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrince. Lipsius was a self-proclaimed supporter of monarchy\nand a moderate form of absolutism, at least when based on Stoic\nvirtues. The way to prevent a monarch from abusing his power was not\nto threaten him with revolt or tyrannicide, but rather to educate him\nthoroughly in Stoic ethics. Lipsius\u2019s ideal monarchy was not\nbased on amoral despotism or Machiavellian power. Its foundation was\ninstead Neostoic moral philosophy, whose precepts and doctrines would\nensure that unruly emotions were governed by reason.\n\nLipsius\u2019s own traumatic experiences in the bloody civil wars of\nhis day surely explain, at least in part, his obsessive concern for\nunity in both state and religion, the secular authority\n(auctoritas) of the prince and the disciplined obedience of\nthe citizenry. Decades before Thomas Hobbes, Lipsius placed order and\npeace, which alone could guarantee political stability, far above\ncivil liberties and personal freedom. That is why Lipsius, writing in\nCalvinist Leiden, argued in favor of a more powerful central authority\nin order to control revolutionary forces in an efficient way. The\nprince\u2019s authority must be as strong as possible, reinforcing\nhis subjects\u2019 opinion of him. He has at his disposal three\ninstruments of power (praecipua vis imperii) to achieve this:\nhis commands, his actual power (depending on wealth, army, advisors,\nalliances and God\u2019s will) and, finally, his moral standards.\nVoluntary obedience and common consent, together with the peace and\nunity which they produce, are secured by the efficient operation of\nthese three instruments (Politica IV.9).\n\nAlthough the claim that Lipsius\u2019s Politica\n\u201claunched the anti-Machiavellian tradition of the\nCounter-Reformation\u201d (Birely, 99) is no doubt exaggerated, it is\ncertainly true that the treatise found a wide audience and met with\nimmense success. More than Jean Bodin in his Six Books of the\nRepublic (1576) or Johannes Althusius in his\nPolitics Methodically Set Forth (1603), Lipsius dealt with\nthe issues which genuinely agitated his contemporaries. Even before\nthe Politica came off the presses in Leiden, Lipsius was\npreparing himself for the criticism which he expected to encounter. In\na second edition, which appeared in 1590, he included some Breves\nnotae (\u201cBrief Notes\u201d) on the first three books; and a\nyear later he published Liber de una religione (\u201cBook\non One Religion\u201d), written in response to Coornhert\u2019s\nobjections to his views on toleration. After returning to the Catholic\nSouthern Low Countries, Lipsius rewrote the Politica. This\n\u201cCatholic\u201d version, published in Antwerp in 1596 and\nsupplied with additional notes, was an attempt to meet the criticisms\nof the Roman Church. Although both versions circulated throughout\nEurope, crossing confessional boundaries, the Politica was\nmost enthusiastically received in France, Germany and Spain. During\nthe reign of Henri IV alone, the Politica was published ten\ntimes in French translation. The treatise exerted a notable influence\non Pierre Charron, author of De la sagesse (On\nWisdom, 1601), Cardinal Richelieu, Duke Maximilian of Bavaria and\nthe Count-Duke Olivares, among many others.\n",
