    "main_text": "Unitarianism and Evolutionism\n7. Implications for Economic and Social Policy\n\n\nBlack (1995) recognizes that, after 1867, Jevons'\n\u201cincreasing faith in the validity of Spencer\u2019s theory of\nevolution was combined with decreasing faith in the validity of\nlaissez-faire as a guide for economic policy\u201d. Unitarians\nstruggled with the \u2018contradiction\u2019 between the need for\nindividual self-improvement on the one hand, and active interventionism\non the other hand. This \u2018contradiction\u2019 can also be\ndepicted as a tension existing between a belief in scientific\nprinciples on the one hand \u2014 the laws of economics \u2014 and\nthe recognition that moral and intellectual self-improvement is\nimpossible as long as the first necessaries of life are still out of\nreach. Unitarians concluded that a rational mode of living had to\nbe imposed on the poor before they could benefit from education. \nJevons tried to resolve this paradox by restricting the scientific\nanalysis to what can be accounted for in terms of the accumulation of\nwealth, and by suggesting that a \u2018higher\u2019 calculus of\npleasures and pains is needed when \u2018higher\u2019 motives\ninterfere. Interventionism could then be justified by pointing\nout those \u2018higher\u2019 motives. The scientific basis of\nJevons' economics is utilitarianism and the mechanics of utility\nand self-interest; like many Unitarians this scientific belief is\ncombined with an emphasis on active interventionism directed towards\nmore possibilities for self-improvement; and evolutionary theory does\nnot only show that there should be development towards the\n\u2018good\u2019 and the \u2018happy\u2019, but also that there\nwill be such a development (at least in Jevons'\ninterpretation). \n\n\nMaterial nature does not contain goodness; it can only be found in\nthe human mind. Nature is depicted as a mechanical machine and\nshould be studied by the natural sciences. Abstract economic\ntheory is the mechanical analogy of these natural sciences: it is\nrestricted to an investigation of the social world as a mechanical\nmachine, and no ethical or religious considerations are taken into\naccount. Jevons refutes the claims of some \u201csentimental\nwriters\u201d who regard economics as a \u201cdismal science\u201d,\nbecause its scope is restricted to wealth. These authors depict\neconomics as a mechanical and miserable body of theories, whereas they\nhold true that a moral science should be concerned with sympathies,\nfeelings and duties. Jevons uses an analogy from the natural\nsciences to refute this opinion: division of labour implies that some\npeople investigate the mechanical aspects of iron, while other\nresearchers devote their time to the study of its electrical or\nmagnetic aspects. A physician may conclude that the health of a\nparticular person will be fostered if he goes to the sea, but this\nperson may decide otherwise by taking other considerations into\naccount. This is the position of economics: charity for\nhumanitarian reasons remains possible, but abstract economic theory\nshows that this may endanger future accumulation of wealth (Black\n1977d, pp. 7\u20138).\n\n\nEarlier we discussed Jevons' use of \u2018representative\nindividuals\u2019 and the notion of \u2018character\u2019. It\nis also the case that Unitarians believe that the formation of an\nimproved character is essential, since otherwise no religious warmth\ncan emerge. It is unclear to what extent improvement of people\nwith presumed inferior character (due to class, race or gender) can be\ndone. In Jevons we encounter a mixture of enlightened belief in\neducation and prejudiced opinions against certain parts of the\npopulation, which is certainly not unusual for the 19th\ncentury. Nevertheless, Jevons does believe that policies to\nameliorate working class conditions and attitudes are possible,\ndesirable and required.\n",
