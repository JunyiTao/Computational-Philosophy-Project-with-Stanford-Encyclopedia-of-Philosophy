    "main_text": "Historical Background || Turing\u2019s Paper Machine\n2.2 Turing\u2019s Paper Machine\n\nA second antecedent to the Chinese Room argument is the idea of a\npaper machine, a computer implemented by a human. This idea is found\nin the work of Alan Turing, for example in \u201cIntelligent\nMachinery\u201d (1948). Turing writes there that he wrote a program\nfor a \u201cpaper machine\u201d to play chess. A paper machine is a\nkind of program, a series of simple steps like a computer program, but\nwritten in natural language (e.g., English), and implemented by a\nhuman. The human operator of the paper chess-playing machine need not\n(otherwise) know how to play chess. All the operator does is follow\nthe instructions for generating moves on the chess board. In fact, the\noperator need not even know that he or she is involved in playing\nchess \u2013 the input and output strings, such as\n\u201cN\u2013QB7\u201d need mean nothing to the operator of the\npaper machine.\n\nAs part of the WWII project to decipher German military encryption,\nTuring had written English-language programs for human\n\u201ccomputers\u201d, as these specialized workers were then known,\nand these human computers did not need to know what the programs that\nthey implemented were doing.\n\nOne reason the idea of a human-plus-paper machine is important is that\nit already raises questions about agency and understanding similar to\nthose in the CRA. Suppose I am alone in a closed room and follow an\ninstruction book for manipulating strings of symbols. I thereby\nimplement a paper machine that generates symbol strings such as\n\u201cN-KB3\u201d that I write on pieces of paper and slip under the\ndoor to someone ouside the room. Suppose further that prior to going\ninto the room I don\u2019t know how to play chess, or even that there\nis such a game. However, unbeknownst to me, in the room I am running\nTuring\u2019s chess program and the symbol strings I generate are\nchess notation and are taken as chess moves by those outside the room.\nThey reply by sliding the symbols for their own moves back under the\ndoor into the room. If all you see is the resulting sequence of moves\ndisplayed on a chess board outside the room, you might think that\nsomeone in the room knows how to play chess very well. Do I now know\nhow to play chess? Or is it the system (consisting of me, the manuals,\nand the paper on which I manipulate strings of symbols) that is\nplaying chess? If I memorize the program and do the symbol\nmanipulations inside my head, do I then know how to play chess, albeit\nwith an odd phenomenology? Does someone\u2019s conscious states\nmatter for whether or not they know how to play chess? If a digital\ncomputer implements the same program, does the computer then play\nchess, or merely simulate this? \n\nBy mid-century Turing was optimistic that the newly developed\nelectronic computers themselves would soon be able to exhibit\napparently intelligent behavior, answering questions posed in English\nand carrying on conversations. Turing (1950) proposed what is now\nknown as the Turing Test: if a computer could pass for human in\non-line chat, it should be counted as intelligent. \n\nA third antecedent of Searle\u2019s argument was the work of\nSearle\u2019s colleague at Berkeley, Hubert Dreyfus. Dreyfus was an\nearly critic of the optimistic claims made by AI researchers. In 1965,\nwhen Dreyfus was at MIT, he published a circa hundred page report\ntitled \u201cAlchemy and Artificial Intelligence\u201d. Dreyfus\nargued that key features of human mental life could not be captured by\nformal rules for manipulating symbols. Dreyfus moved to Berkeley in\n1968 and in 1972 published his extended critique, \u201cWhat\nComputers Can\u2019t Do\u201d. Dreyfus\u2019 primary research\ninterests were in Continental philosophy, with its focus on\nconsciousness, intentionality, and the role of intuition and the\ninarticulated background in shaping our understandings. Dreyfus\nidentified several problematic assumptions in AI, including the view\nthat brains are like digital computers, and, again, the assumption\nthat understanding can be codified as explicit rules. \n\nHowever by the late 1970s, as computers became faster and less\nexpensive, some in the burgeoning AI community started to claim that\ntheir programs could understand English sentences, using a database of\nbackground information. The work of one of these, Yale researcher\nRoger Schank (Schank & Abelson 1977) came to Searle\u2019s\nattention.Schank developed a technique called \u201cconceptual\nrepresentation\u201d that used \u201cscripts\u201d to represent\nconceptual relations (related to Conceptual Role Semantics).\nSearle\u2019s argument was originally presented as a response to the\nclaim that AI programs such as Schank\u2019s literally understand the\nsentences that they respond to.\n",
