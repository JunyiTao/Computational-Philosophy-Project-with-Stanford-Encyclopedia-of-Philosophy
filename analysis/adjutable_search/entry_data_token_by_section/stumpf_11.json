Over the past fifteen years, in addition to\nthe publication of numerous translations and reprints of\nStumpf\u2019s writings, several articles and books have been devoted\nto examining and evaluating the different aspects of his work. The\nrecent reception of Stumpf\u2019s work is very diversified and it\nreflects the interdisciplinary nature of his research and his many\naccomplishments at an academic as well as an institutional level. (G.\nFr\u00e9chette, 2010; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2011; D. Fisette\n2015a)\n\nAt the very end of his autobiography, Stumpf confesses that he never\nsought to establish a school and that he is grateful to those of his\nstudents who pursued their research based on their own plans in the\nsame scientific spirit. Stumpf\u2019s words are confirmed by the\ntestimonies of many of his students who all shared this scientific\nspirit and described Stumpf as a model of precision and clarity in\nthought and observation, with a keen sense for analysis and a critical\nattitude towards his own philosophical thought. If indeed he did not\nestablish a school, he is however responsible for the formation of\noutstanding researchers and philosophers, and he has contributed\ndirectly to the development of two of the most important movements in\nGermany at the beginning of the twentieth century: Gestalt psychology\nand phenomenology. But Stumpf also counts as one of the harshest\ncritics of these two movements as evidenced in his\nErkenntnislehre, a posthumous work in which he presents the\nessential elements of his Weltanschauung and, in a sense, his\nphilosophical testament. Let us remember that this book is dedicated\nto Brentano and can therefore be considered a contribution, the last\nin importance in the school of Brentano, to the philosophical program\nof his mentor. It is not surprising, therefore, that the criticism he\naddressed to his own students in this work was mainly motivated by\nthis program.\n\nIn this work, he offers a remarkably penetrating analysis of the\nphilosophical project that guided Husserl in the first book of\nIdeas. From Stumpf\u2019s perspective, the originality of\nthis new version of phenomenology in Ideas I lies less in the\naspects in which he criticizes the doctrine of the Logical\nInvestigations whereby phenomenology is defined as descriptive\npsychology than in the features by which Husserl opens up new\nperspectives with respect to descriptive psychology and phenomenology\nin Stumpf\u2019s sense. This is the case of phenomenology understood\nas a doctrine of essences, whose aim is to ground the empirical\nsciences on the so-called regional ontologies. This endeavor belongs\nto the more general project of a general theory of science which\nHusserl worked out in this work. Stumpf understands this project as a\nwidening of Brentano\u2019s and Lotze\u2019s initial program which,\naccording to him, is nothing other than a regional phenomenology or\nontology in the sense of Husserl. However, he does not see any\nprogress in the idea of a \u201cpure\u201d or transcendental\nphenomenology nor in the postulate of a pure ego to which something\nlike a \u201crein Ichblick\u201d is purported to give\naccess. For if this purity is acquired on the basis of the method of\nthe reduction, more precisely the eidetic reduction, than by\nbracketing the existence of objects, it rules out eo ipso any\npossible contribution on the part of the empirical sciences. Stumpf\nalso questions the status of sense perception and the domain of\nphenomena in this perspective given that Husserl\u2019s\nWesensschau can only be applied to what Stumpf calls mere\npresentations or second-order phenomena. In his remarks on Stumpf in\nSection 86 of Ideas I, Husserl pointed out that the study of\nphenomena belongs to what he calls in the introduction to this work\n\u201ceidetic psychology.\u201d But as a science of facts and of\nrealities, this psychology falls under the reduction and does not seem\nto contribute significantly to the version of transcendental\nphenomenology put forth in Ideas I. Stumpf concludes that\nthis version of phenomenology is a phenomenology without phenomena due\nboth to Husserl\u2019s account of phenomena and to his peculiar\nconception of (transcendental) phenomenology. (R. Rollinger, 1999,\n2008c; D. Fisette, 2015b)\n\nAs we said, in 1900, Stumpf established the Institute of psychology in\nBerlin which was at the origin of the original movement in psychology\ncalled Gestalt psychology. With the exception of Max Wertheimer, who\ndid his dissertation in 1904 under the direction of K\u00fclpe in\nW\u00fcrzburg, the other psychologists of the Institute of Berlin,\nWolfgang K\u00f6hler, Kurt Koffka, Kurt Lewin, Egon Brunswik and\nAdhemar Gelb undertook their apprenticeship in psychology and\nphilosophy under Stumpf\u2019s supervision. This is also the case of\nRobert Musil and C. von Allesch. However, although the Gestaltists in\nBerlin had initially adopted Stumpf\u2019s phenomenological\nstandpoint, they departed significantly from Stumpf\u2019s conception\nof the mind. (M. Ash, 2000\u20132001, 1998; F. Toccafondi, 2009).\nDespite Stumpf\u2019s significant contribution to the debate on the\nnature of Gestalt and psychology in general, he was targeted by\nK\u00f6hler (1913) in his classical paper on the constancy hypothesis,\nand which is sometimes considered to be the very beginning of Gestalt\npsychology. Stumpf replied to this objection in his posthumous book by\nsaying that K\u00f6hler was wrong in eliminating founding contents in\nfavour of the constancy hypothesis. The following excerpt from his\nbook Erkenntnislehre summarizes the main issues in this\ndispute:\n\nIn the presentations of the Gestalt psychology, it is as if there were\nabsolutely no sound and no color, nothing absolute in our sense\nperceptions, but only Gestalts. Gestalts alone seem to be the only\noriginal data while sounds, colors and everything that we call\nphenomena would only come apart by means of abstraction. (Stumpf,\n1939, p. 242)\n\n\nIn summary, Stumpf claims that, in this conception of Gestalt,\n\u201cthe forest hides the trees.\u201d For Stumpf maintains that\nthe whole is prior to its parts and that each part, in virtue of its\nnature, is conditioned by the whole. However, he cannot allow the idea\nthat one may perceive a Gestalt without presupposing a founding\ncontent or what he also calls first-order phenomena such as, for\ninstance, color or sound. Stumpf\u2019s conception of Gestalt is\ncloser to that of B\u00fchler (D. Fisette, 2015c) in that it consists\nin a \u201ccomplex of structural relations.\u201d (Stumpf, 1939, p.\n246) Another quote from his posthumous work summarizes perfectly the\ntheoretical issues at stake in Stumpf\u2019s criticism of his\nstudents:\n\nThe conception of the perception of Gestalts which is advocated here\npresupposes: 1. The possibility of perceiving relations; 2. The\npossibility of unnoticed content in consciousness; 3. The distinction\nbetween phenomena and mental functions as heterogeneous contents of\nconsciousness. If one admits these three theses, then our theory is\nfounded. If one challenges it, then one will be led to the native\nGestalt psychology, but also to all the difficulties that come with\nit. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 254)\n\n\nAccording to Stumpf, the cost for adhering to the native theory is\nnothing less than to abandon the very principles of descriptive\npsychology and phenomenology. Moreover, besides the difficulties\nmentioned by Stumpf in this passage, Gestalt psychology conveys\nphilosophical presuppositions which are at the heart of the dispute.\nThe first is a form of sensual naturalism that Stumpf rejects. The\nsecond assumption concerns the metaphysical question of psychophysical\nrelations in K\u00f6hler\u2019s work and the attempt to introduce the\nconcept of Gestalt in the field of physics. Stumpf believes that\nK\u00f6hler\u2019s isomorphism thesis, which postulates the existence\nof an identity relation between the structural laws of the psychical\nworld and that of the physical world, presupposes the theory of\npsychophysical parallelism, which Stumpf rejects as well.\n",
