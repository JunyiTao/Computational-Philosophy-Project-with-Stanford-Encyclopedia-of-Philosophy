    "main_text": "Conceptions of Authenticity || Sartre and de Beauvoir\n3.2 Sartre and de Beauvoir\n\nPublished in 1943, Sartre\u2019s opus magnum, Being and\nNothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, had a\nsignificant influence on philosophical thought and intellectual life\nin the second half of the twentieth century. His principal goal in\nthis book is to \u201crepudiate the spirit of\nseriousness\u201d of traditional philosophy as well as of\nbourgeois culture (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 796). The spirit of\nseriousness assumes (1) that there are transcendent values that exist\nantecedently to humans, and (2) that the value of a thing is part of\nthe actual being of the valued thing. Sartre\u2019s view, in\ncontrast, is that all values are generated by human interactions in\nsituations, so that value is a human construct with no extra-human\nexistence in things.\n\nTo address the question of human existence, Sartre scrutinizes our\neveryday lives, focusing on two particular aspects. He notes that\nhuman beings, like other entities in the world, have certain concrete\ncharacteristics that make up what he calls their\n\u201cfacticity\u201d or what they are \u201cin themselves\u201d\n(en soi). Facticity makes up the element of\n\u201cgivenness\u201d we must work with: I find myself with a past,\na body and a social situation that constrains me in what I can do.\nThis \u201cjust being there\u201d is above all contingent: there is\nno prior justification or reason for the existence of my being. On\nSartre\u2019s view, the \u201cin itself\u201d does not even have\nany determinate characteristics, since every determination (every\n\u201cthis, not that\u201d) is first introduced into the\ntotality of being by our specific interpretations of things.\n\nWhile human beings share their \u201cfacticity\u201d with other\nentities in the world, they are unique among the totality of entities\ninsofar as they are capable of distancing themselves from what is\n\u201cin itself\u201d through reflection and self-awareness. Rather\nthan being an item in the world with relatively fixed attributes, what\nis distinctive about me as a human being is that I am capable of\nputting my own being in question by asking myself, for example,\nwhether I want to be a person of a particular sort. This capacity for\ngaining distance inserts a \u201cnot\u201d or a\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d into the totality of what is, which allows me\nto organize what surrounds me into a meaningfully differentiated\nwhole. In addition, human consciousness is the source of the\n\u201cnot\u201d because it is itself a \u201cnothingness\u201d. In\nother words, a human being is not just an \u201cin itself\u201d but\nalso a \u201cfor itself (pour soi), thus characterized by\nwhat Sartre calls \u201ctranscendence\u201d. As transcendence, I am\nalways more than I am as facticity because, as surpassing my brute\nbeing, I stand before an open range of possibilities for\nself-definition in the future.\n\nSartre\u2019s notion of transcendence is closely linked with the idea\nof freedom. Humans are free in the sense that they have the\nability to choose how they are going to interpret things, and in these\ninterpretations they are deciding how things are to count or matter.\nWe constitute the world through our freedom to the extent that our\nways of taking things determine how reality will be sorted out and\nmatter to us. At the same time, we constitute ourselves\nthrough our own choices: though the facticity of my situation creates\nsome constraints on my possible self-interpretations, it is always up\nto me to decide the meaning of those constraints, and this means that\nwhat I take to be limitations are in fact produced by my own\ninterpretations or meaning-giving activities. Such limitations are\ngrasped in light of antecedent commitments, on the background of which\nsituations becomes intelligible, as affording certain actions and/or\nmodes of evaluation. It is our antecedent commitments that shape our\nworld, making situations and objects intelligible as threatening or\nfavorable, easy or full of obstacles, or more generally, as affording\ncertain actions (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 489). Our engagements provide a\nhermeneutic structure within which our situations and motives become\ncomprehensible and reveal themselves in the way situations appear to\nus\u2014as significant, requiring our attention, etc. (1992a [1943]:\n485).\n\nIt is important to note that Sartre\u2019s notion of freedom is\nradical. Freedom is absolute to the extent that each person decides\nthe significance of the constraints in his or her facticity: \u201cI\nfind an absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity\n\u2026 is directly inapprehensible\u201d, because supposed\n\u201cfacts\u201d about me are never brute facts, \u201cbut always\nappear across a projective reconstruction of my for-itself\u201d\n(Sartre 1992a [1943]: 710). For Sartre, only our choices and their\nprojected ends define our situations as meaningful, as threatening or\nfavorable, as affording certain actions etc. The resistances and\nobstacles that one encounters in a situation acquire meaning only in\nand through the free choice. Thus, individuals are responsible not\nonly for their identities, but for the way the world presents itself\nin their experiences. Even others are just\n\u201copportunities and chances\u201d for my free\ncreative activity. According to this early formulation, it is up to us\nto interpret how other people are to matter to us relative to\nsituations in which we find ourselves engaged (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n711).\n\nBut human beings are not merely characterized by facticity and\ntranscendence; they are also seen as embodying a deep and\nirreconcilable tension between facticity and transcendence. This\ntension comes to the fore in Sartre\u2019s account of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d. Bad faith, a kind of self-deception, involves believing\nor taking oneself to be an X while all along one is (and knows\noneself to be) actually a Y. The most familiar form of bad\nfaith is acting as if one were a mere thing\u2014solely\nfacticity\u2014and thereby denying one\u2019s own freedom to make\noneself into something very different. Thus, the person who thinks she\nis a coward \u201cjust as a matter of fact\u201d is excluding from\nview the ability to transform her existence through changed ways of\nbehaving. Such bad faith is a denial of transcendence or freedom.\n\nAt first, it might seem that one could escape bad faith by making a\nsincere, deep commitment to something and abiding by that\ncommitment\u2014for example, a total, resolute engagement of the self\ncomparable to Kierkegaard\u2019s notion of an \u201cinfinite\npassion\u201d. In this regard, Sartre considers a person who tries to\nwholeheartedly believe that his friend really likes him. \u201cI\nbelieve it\u201d, he says, \u201cI decide to believe in it\nand maintain myself in this decision\u2026\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 114). My belief will be steady and solid, like something\n\u201cin itself\u201d that informs my being and cuts through all the\ntenuousness and unsteadiness of my subjective life. I know I\nbelieve it, I will say. If I could make myself believe\nsomething in this way, then to achieve this might be what we could\ncall \u201cgood faith:\u201d to actually be something,\nwithout the questionability of the \u201cnot\u201d creeping in.\nHowever, Sartre doubts that such an absolute, being-determining\ncommitment is possible. In fact, Sartre claims that any such sort of\n\u201cgood faith\u201d would actually amount to little more than\nanother form of self-deception. For if my decision to believe is in\nfact a decision, it must always be something that to some extent\ndistances me from what is decided. That is why we use the word\n\u2018believe\u2019 to imply some degree of uncertainty, as when we\nsay, \u201cIs he my friend? Well, I believe he is\u201d.\nLucid self-awareness shows us that in making a choice, we can never\nattain the condition of the \u201cin itself\u201d, because what we\nare is always in question for us. This is what Sartre means when he\nsays human being is always \u201cpreviously corrupted\u201d and that\n\u201cbad faith [always] reapprehends good faith\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 116). Thus, the project of being in good faith seems\nimpossible, as we are always necessarily in bad faith.\n\nThe inescapable nature of bad faith seems to leave no room for the\npossibility of authenticity. This might be why the word translated as\n\u201cauthentic\u201d only appears twice in this vast tome. On one\noccasion, Sartre attacks Heidegger for introducing the idea of\nauthenticity as a way of providing something foundational in an\notherwise totally contingent world. The concept of authenticity\n\u201cshows all too clearly [Heidegger\u2019s] anxiety to establish\nan ontological foundation for an Ethics\u2026\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 128). A second and more obscure appearance of the word comes\nat the end of the discussion of bad faith early in the book. Here\nSartre acknowledges that his account of bad faith seems to have the\nconsequence that there can be no such thing as good faith, so that\n\u201cit is indifferent whether one is in good faith or in bad\nfaith\u201d, and that in turn seems to imply that \u201cwe can never\nradically escape bad faith\u201d. Nevertheless, he goes on, there may\nbe a \u201cself-recovery of being which has been previously\ncorrupted\u201d, a recovery \u201cwe shall call authenticity, the\ndescription of which has no place here\u201d (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n116n).\n\nOne might thus conclude that there is no way to be true to what one\nis, because there is nothing that one is. However, such a negative\nconclusion would be reached only by someone who embraced from the\noutset the \u201cspirit of seriousness\u201d Sartre sets out to\nattack. Seriousness would lead us to think that there is simply a fact\nof the matter about a person: the person is either a believer or he is\nnot. But, as Linda A. Bell (1989: 45) has noted, there is another\npossibility. If one rejects the spirit of seriousness, one might\nlucidly acknowledge that, as transcendence, one\u2019s\nbelief is always in question and so not really a secure belief. Yet,\nat the same time, one might also recognize that, as\nfacticity, one genuinely holds a belief, and that the belief is\ncentral to one\u2019s being as an engaged agent in this situation. In\nSartre\u2019s convoluted style of formulation, \u201che would be\nright if he recognized himself as a being that is what it is not and\nis not what it is\u201d (Bell 1989: 45). On this account, I believe,\nbut I also acknowledge my ability to retract the belief, since nothing\nis ever fixed in stone.\n\nWhat is suggested here is that a correlate of authenticity can be\nfound in the idea of being true to the inescapable tension at the core\nof the human self. This would be attained if one clear-sightedly\nacknowledged the fundamental ambiguity of the human\ncondition. Authenticity would then be what Sartre calls a\n\u201cself-recovery of being which was previously corrupted\u201d\n(1992a [1943]: 116). In a sense, humans can never really be\nanything in the way brute objects can be things with determinate\nattributes. In Bell\u2019s words, authenticity would be \u201cthe\nawareness and acceptance of\u2014this basic ambiguity\u201d (1989:\n46). This conclusion is supported by Sartre\u2019s later work,\nAnti-Semite and Jew where he writes,\n\n\nAuthenticity, it is almost needless to say, consists in having a true\nand lucid consciousness of the situation, in assuming the\nresponsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it \u2026\nsometimes in horror and hate. (1948: 90)\n\n\nLucid recognition of the ambiguity of the human condition is the\nleading idea behind Beauvoir\u2019s The Ethics of Ambiguity.\nBeauvoir takes over Sartre\u2019s characterization of the human\ncondition and expands on ideas only hinted at in Sartre\u2019s famous\nlecture, \u201cThe Humanism of Existentialism\u201d (1946), in\ndeveloping a conception of authenticity. According to Beauvoir,\nSartre\u2019s conception of the human being as \u201cengaged\nfreedom\u201d implies not just that each individual finds his or her\n\u201creason for being\u201d in concrete realizations of freedom,\nbut that willing one\u2019s own freedom necessarily involves willing\nthe freedom of all humans. In achieving one\u2019s own freedom, she\nwrites, freedom must also will \u201can open future, by seeking to\nextend itself by means of the freedom of others\u201d (1948: 60). The\npoint here is that a dedication to freedom, when clearly grasped in\nits full implications, will be seen to call for a future in which an\nunrestricted range of possibilities is open to all.\n\nBeauvoir also builds on Sartre\u2019s notion of engagement\nto extend the idea of authenticity. Following Sartre, we are always\nalready engaged in the affairs of the world, whether we realize it or\nnot. To be human is to be already caught up in the midst of social and\nconcrete situations that call for commitments of certain sorts on our\npart. Sartre takes this ground-level fact of engagement as the basis\nfor exhorting us to be engaged in a deeper sense, where this implies\nthat we decisively and wholeheartedly involve ourselves in what the\ncurrent situation demands. Of course, once we have abandoned the\nspirit of seriousness, we will recognize that there are no\nantecedently given principles or values that dictate the proper course\nfor our existential engagement, so that any commitment will be tenuous\nand groundless. But the authentic individual will be the one who takes\nup the terrifying freedom of being the ultimate source of values,\nembraces it, and acts with a clarity and firmness suitable to his or\nher best understanding of what is right in this context. In this way,\nthe conception of authenticity is continuous with the ideal of being\ntrue to ourselves: we are called upon to become, in our concrete\nlives, what we already are in the ontological structure of our\nbeing.\n\nThis is in agreement with the manner in which Sartre describes the\nconsequences of acting against one\u2019s deepest commitments.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that I could have done otherwise, but that is not\nthe problem. It ought to be formulated like this: could I have done\notherwise without perceptibly modifying the organic totality of the\nprojects that make up who I am?\n\n\nSartre goes on to say that the character of the act may be such\nthat\n\n\ninstead of remaining a purely local and accidental modification of my\nbehavior, it could be effected only by means of a radical\ntransformation of my being-in-the-world\u2026 In other words: I\ncould have acted otherwise. Agreed. But at what price? (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 454)\n\n\nThus, acting otherwise or, more precisely, failing to act on\none\u2019s fundamental commitments, comes at the price of\ntransforming who one is. This change effectively precludes one from\ncarrying on with an unchanged self-conception.\n",
