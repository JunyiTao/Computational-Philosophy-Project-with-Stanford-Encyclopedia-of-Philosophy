Moral Caution: What Follows from Incapacity?\n\nAlthough the topic of this entry is primarily the nature of\ndecision-making capacity, it is worth pausing briefly to comment on\nwhat morally follows from a declaration of incapacity. If a patient is\ndeemed incapable of making a particular decision, then someone else\n(usually a family member) will be designated to make it for her. If\nthe patient was refusing what others take to be beneficial treatment,\nthen a finding of incompetence means that the treatment could\nbe forced on the patient if a surrogate deems this best. However,\nwhile it is true that when a person is incompetent to make a decision,\nthis means that the final authority for decisions will lie elsewhere,\nthis doesn\u2019t automatically mean that the patient\u2019s current\nwishes, values, preferences etc. are of no importance or that they\nneed not be considered in making decisions for the patient. Many\nincompetent patients clearly have strong desires that should be\naccommodated, at least when doing so will not otherwise cause\nproblems. Given the strong link between well-being and what a person\ncares about, it is imperative for caretakers to at least consider what\nthe patient currently wants.\n\nSecond, although it is possible to force treatment on a patient if she\nis deemed to lack capacity, this does not mean that it is always\nadvisable to do so. There are many downsides to coercive treatment\nthat need to be considered. Treatment might not be effective if the\npatient is uncooperative. It may also be important in the case of\nchronic mental illnesses to maintain trust with a patient who will\nlikely need care again in the future. It may be that once these facts\nare taken into account, a treatment that seemed clearly beneficial\nwill not be so.\n\nA slightly different point concerns globally incompetent patients.\nDespite the emphasis in the field on treating DMC as\ndecision-relative, there are, of course, some patients who because of\nmore extreme impairments are unable to make all or almost all of their\nown medical decisions. In the case of globally incompetent patients\nwho once were competent and who wrote advance directives, it is\nusually assumed that the directive comes into force once the patient\nreaches this state (Appelbaum 2007; Krohm & Summers 2002).\nHowever, this simple assumption has been powerfully challenged. For\nexample, Jaworska (1999) has argued that many patients with mid-stage\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia retain the capacity to value (they remain,\nin her words, \u201cvaluers\u201d), even though increasing confusion\nand forgetfulness about facts may mean that they no longer count as\ncompetent to make their own treatment decisions (because they fail\nunderstanding and reasoning). Jaworska argues that although such\npatients lack decision-making capacity, they are not yet at the point\nwhere their advance directives have the greatest authority. Their\ncurrently held values are still much more relevant to decisions made\nfor them. In short, Jaworska draws attention to the fact that\nvarious significant capacities of persons can come\napart. We usually value decision-making capacities like\nunderstanding and reasoning because these enable us to pursue\nour valued ends. But Jaworska underscores the fact that a person may\ncontinue to have currently valued ends even when she has lost the\nabilities needed for pursuing them effectively. In these cases, rather\nthan revert to an advanced directive, Jaworska thinks we should\n(within reason) aim to help such patients pursue the ends they are no\nlonger able to pursue on their own.\n",
