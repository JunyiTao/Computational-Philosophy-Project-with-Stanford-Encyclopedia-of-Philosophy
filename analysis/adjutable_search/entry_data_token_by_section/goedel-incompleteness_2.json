    "main_text": "Introduction || The Relevance of the Church-Turing Thesis\n1.3 The Relevance of the Church-Turing Thesis\n\nG\u00f6del originally only established the incompleteness of a\nparticular though very comprehensive formalized theory\nP, a variant of Russell\u2019s type-theoretical\nsystem PM (for Principia Mathematica, see the\nsections on Paradoxes and Russell\u2019s Type Theories in the entries\non\n type theory\n and\n Principia Mathematica),\n and all extension of P with the same language, whose\nset of axioms is primitive recursive. He also suggested, though did\nnot demonstrate, that the proof could be adapted to apply also to the\nstandard axiom systems of set theory such as ZFC.\nThough it turns out that G\u00f6del in fact already had a very general\nresult, it was, at the time, unclear just how general this really was\n(see also\n Section 5).\n\nWhat was still missing was an analysis of the intuitive notion of\ndecidability, needed in the characterization of the notion of an\narbitrary formal system. Recall that the set of axioms and the proof\nrelation of a formalized system are required to be decidable.\nMathematicians and logicians have implicitly used the intuitive notion\nof a decision method since antiquity, and as long as one asked for a\npositive solution, it was sufficient that one presented a concrete\nmethod that intuitively striked everyone as a mechanical method. For\nthe general limitative results, such as the general incompleteness\ntheorems, or the undecidability results (see\n 4.2),\n however, a precise mathematical explication of the notion would be\nneeded. Instead of decidable sets or properties, one often considers\neffective or computable functions or operations, but in fact these are\njust two sides of the same coin\u2014talk of one can be easily\ntranscribed to talk of another.\n\nG\u00f6del (1934), Alonzo Church (1936a, b) and Alan Turing\n(1936\u20137) came up independently with different proposals for an\nexact mathematical definition of computable functions, and\nconsequently, of decidable sets (of numbers). These proposals, though,\nall turned out to be equivalent. Turing\u2019s careful conceptual\nanalysis which used fictional and abstract computing machines\n(nowadays conventionally called \u201cTuring machines\u201d; see the\nentry on\n Turing machines)\n was particularly important, as G\u00f6del himself emphasized (see,\ne.g., G\u00f6del 1963). The equation of the intuitive notion and some\nof these mathematical explications is often called \u201cThe\nChurch-Turing-thesis\u201d. The label \u201crecursive\nfunction\u201d has, for historical reasons, been dominant in the\nlogical literature. Consequently, decidable sets are often called\n\u201crecursive sets\u201d. (See the entries on\n computability,\n recursive functions and\n the Church-Turing thesis.)\n\nFor a proper understanding of the incompleteness and undecidability\nresults, it is vital to understand the difference between the two key\nnotions regarding sets. First, there may be a mechanical method which\ndecides whether any given number belongs to the set at issue or not\n(in which case the set is called \u201cdecidable\u201d or\n\u201crecursive\u201d), and, second, there may be a mechanical\nmethod which generates or lists the elements of the set, number by\nnumber. In the latter case, the set is called \u201crecursively\nenumerable\u201d (r.e.), that is to say, it can be effectively\ngenerated, or it is \u201csemi-decidable.\u201d It is a fundamental\nresult of the theory of computability (or \u201cthe theory of\nrecursive functions\u201d) that there are semi-decidable sets, sets\nwhich can be effectively generated (i.e., are recursively enumerable),\nbut are not decidable (i.e., not recursive). In fact, this is,\nin the very abstract level, the essence of the first incompleteness\ntheorem. However, if both a set and its complement are recursively\nenumerable, the set is recursive, i.e., decidable.\n",
