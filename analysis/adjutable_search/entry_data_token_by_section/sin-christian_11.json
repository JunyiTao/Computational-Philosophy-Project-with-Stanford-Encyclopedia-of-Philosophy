    "main_text": "Noetic Effects of Sin\n5. Noetic Effects of Sin\n\nThe depravity brought about by sin is held to affect all parts of\nhuman nature. In addition to sin as act, disposition, and fallen\nstate, Christian philosophers have also done significant work on the\nnoetic effects of sin, including but not limited specifically to its\nepistemic effects. The Reformed tradition in particular emphasizes the\neffects of sin not just on the will but on the human intellect. Alvin\nPlantinga, for instance, states that \u201cOriginal sin involves both\nintellect and will; it is both cognitive and affective\u201d\n(Plantinga 2000: 207). On Plantinga\u2019s view, the affective\ndimension of sin\u2014particularly the skewing of affections toward\nthe sin of pride\u2014is perhaps \u201cthe deepest root of the condition\nof sin\u201d, but a full accounting of sin must also include its\nimpact on our epistemic faculties:\n\n\nOne the one hand, [sin] carries with it a sort of blindness,\na sort of imperceptiveness, dullness, stupidity. This is a cognitive\nlimitation that first of all prevents its victim from proper knowledge\nof God and his beauty, glory, and love; it also prevents him from\nseeing what is worth loving and what worth hating, what should be\nsought and what eschewed. It therefore comprises both knowledge of\nfact and knowledge of value. (Plantinga 2000: 207)\n\n\nPlantinga develops an influential view of warrant which he calls the\nextended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model. Though an account of warrant in\ngeneral, it was developed specifically to show how religious beliefs\ncould be justified (both internally and externally); rational; and, if\nthese beliefs are true, could have warrant.\n\n\nThe central feature of this model is the stipulation that God has\ncreated us human beings with a belief-producing process or source of\nbelief, the sensus divinitatis; this source works under\nvarious conditions to produce beliefs about God, including, of course,\nbeliefs that immediately entail his existence. (Plantinga 2000:\n199)\n\n\nFor Plantinga, religious belief can be immediate and basic; a\nreligious belief can be warranted even if it is not held on the basis\nof argument, so long as it is reliably produced by the sensus\ndivinitatis. The A/C model is explicitly constructed to be able\nto account for the noetic effects of sin:\n\n\nOur fall into sin has had cataclysmic consequences, both affective and\ncognitive. As to affective consequences, our affections are skewed and\nour hearts now harbor deep and radical evil: we love ourselves above\nall, rather than God. There were also ruinous cognitive\nconsequences. Our original knowledge of God and of his marvelous\nbeauty, glory, and loveliness has been severely compromised; in this\nway the narrow image of God in us was destroyed and the broad image\ndamaged, distorted. In particular, the sensus divinitatis has\nbeen damaged and deformed; because of the fall, we no longer know God\nin the same natural and unproblematic way in which we know each other\nand the world around us. Still further, sin induces in us a\nresistance to the deliverances of the sensus\ndivinitatis, muted as they are by the first factor; we\ndon\u2019t want to pay attention to its deliverances. We are\nunable by our own efforts to extricate ourselves from this quagmire.\n(Plantinga 2000: 205)\n\n\nPlantinga thinks that \u201cthe most serious noetic effects of\nsin\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 214) are the deleterious effects sin has\non our knowledge of God:\n\n\nOur original knowledge of God and his glory is muffled and impaired;\nit has been replaced (by virtue of sin) by stupidity, dullness,\nblindness, inability to perceive God or to perceive him in his\nhandiwork. Our knowledge of his character and his love toward us can\nbe smothered: it can even be transformed into a resentful thought that\nGod is to be feared and mistrusted; we may see him as indifferent or\neven malignant.\u2026 The most important cognitive consequence of\nsin, therefore, is failure to know God. And this failure can have\nfurther cognitive consequences\u2026. If we don\u2019t know there\nis such a person as God, we don\u2019t know the first thing (the most\nimportant thing) about ourselves, each other, and the world.\n(Plantinga 2000: 215 and 217)\n\n\nThe noetic effects of sin aren\u2019t limited simply to knowledge of\nGod, however. They extend to our knowledge of the moral demands on our\nlives given our relationship with God, our emotions, imagination and\neven non-epistemic mental functions (see McMartin 2016).\n\nDespite sin\u2019s epistemic effects, Plantinga thinks that knowledge\nof God is still possible in two ways. First, knowledge of God is\npossible via natural theology (see Walls & Dougherty 2018).\nSecond, knowledge of God is possible despite the noetic effects of sin\ngiven the role of the Holy Spirit in bringing about faith. Faith, for\nPlantinga, has both affective and cognitive elements. Central to the\ncognitive dimension of faith is \u201ca firm and certain knowledge of\nGod\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 206; see also Diller 2014) and knowledge\nof other central aspects of Christian belief. The sensus\ndivinitatis is repaired by the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\u201cWithout some special activity on the part of the Lord, we\nwouldn\u2019t believe\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 269). While sin has\ndamaged the sensus divinitatis, the Holy Spirit can\nregenerates it, allowing it to again function properly and remove\ndefeaters from warranted religion belief.\n\nMerold Westphal is another contemporary Christian philosopher who\nexplores sin\u2019s noetic effects. Westphal claims that to take St.\nPaul seriously is to take seriously the universality of sin (Westphal\n1990; see also Westphal 1993), including sin\u2019s effects on how we\nthink about God. Westphal worries that much philosophical theology is\ntoo optimistic about human reason, ignoring the impact of sin on our\nepistemic capacities and functioning. By \u201csin\u201d, Westphal\nhas in mind both sinful acts and the general disposition to commit\nsinful acts, and he maintains that both acts and dispositions can be\nindividual and communal. Following Augustine, Westphal also sees sin\nas best described in terms of pride,\n\n\nthe self-assertion which usurps a role in life not proper to me,\ndepriving God and neighbor of their rightful places as, respectively,\nmy absolute superior and my equal. (Westphal 1990: 200)\n\n\nUltimately, sin isn\u2019t weakness but rather idolatry.\nWestphal\u2019s \u201cLaw of Inverse Rationality\u201d holds\nthat\n\n\nthe ability of human thought to be undistorted by sinful desire is\ninversely proportional to the existential import of the subject\nmatter. (Westphal 1990: 205; see also Timpe 2014b)\n\n\nThis worry about the noetic effects of sin is one of the major\nmotivations for Westphal\u2019s criticism of Reformed epistemology,\nfor we can\u2019t be sure that our epistemic faculties, including the\nsensus divinitatis, are functioning properly if they\u2019re\ndistorted by sin.\n\nWilliam Abraham suggest that Westphal\u2019s approach insufficiently\nappreciates the role grace places as a remedy to sin:\n\n\nIf the sensus divinitatis is damaged all the way down without\nrepair, it is hard to see how we would even know anything that really\ncounted about God or about ourselves. Merold Westphal runs this risk\nis his very insightful essay. We need to remember that epistemically\nas well as spiritually, where sin abounds, grace amounts all the more.\n(Abraham 2006: 111 n. 17)\n\n\nAbraham suggests a\n\n\nmore robust vision of [human] cognitive capacities and practices, like\nintuition, percept, reason, memory, testimony, and the like\n\n\non the basis of the recognition that these capacities and practices,\neven while affected by sin, are \u201cunderwritten by the power and\ngoodness of God\u201d (Abraham 2006: 121).\n\nDiscussions of the noetic effects of sin aren\u2019t limited to the\nones mentioned here, nor to these topics. For a discussion of the\ncompatibility of the noetic effects of sin with evolutionary\nepistemology, for instance, particularly with an eye toward the\ncognitive science of religion, see De Cruz and Smedt 2013 and Barrett\n2009. Peter Harrison also argues that sin\u2019s noetic effects\nhelped shape the experimental method in science (Harrison 2007).\n",
