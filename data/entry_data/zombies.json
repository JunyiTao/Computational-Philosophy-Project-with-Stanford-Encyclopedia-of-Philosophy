    "main_text": "\n1. The idea of zombies\n\nDescartes held that non-human animals are automata: their behavior is\nwholly explicable in terms of physical mechanisms. But human behavior\n(he argued) could not be explained like that. Exploring the idea of a\nmachine that would look and behave like a human being, he thought two\nthings would unmask it: it could not use language creatively, and it\ncould not produce appropriate non-verbal behavior in arbitrarily\nvarious situations (Discourse V). For him, therefore, no\nmachine could behave like a human being. Knowing only seventeenth\ncentury technology, he concluded that to explain distinctively human\nbehavior required something beyond the physical: an immaterial mind,\ninteracting with processes in the brain and the rest of the body.\n(Importantly, he also had a priori arguments for the same\nconclusion, one of which anticipates the \u2018conceivability\nargument\u2019 discussed in Section 3 below.) If he is right, there\ncould not be a world physically like the actual world but lacking such\nminds: human bodies would not work properly. If we suddenly lost our\nminds our bodies might continue to run on for a while: our hearts\nmight continue to beat, we might breathe while asleep and digest food;\nwe might even walk or sing in a mindless sort of way (so he implies in\nhis Reply to Objections IV). But without the contribution\nmade by minds, behavior could not show characteristically human\nfeatures. So although Descartes did everything short of spelling out\nthe idea of zombies, the question of their possibility did not arise\nfor him. The nearest thing was automata whose behavior was easily\nrecognizable as not fully human.\n\nIn the nineteenth century scientists began to think that physics was\ncapable of explaining all physical events that were explicable at all.\nIt seemed that every physical effect has a physical cause: that the\nphysical world is \u2018closed under causation\u2019. The developing\nscience of neurophysiology was set to extend such explanations to\nhuman behavior. But if human behavior is explicable physically, how\ndoes consciousness fit into the story? One response \u2014\nphysicalism (or materialism) \u2014 is to insist that consciousness\ntoo involves only physical processes. However, the phenomena of\nconsciousness are hard to account for in those terms, and some\nthinkers concluded with Descartes that something nonphysical must be\ninvolved. Given they accepted the causal closure of the physical, they\nwere forced to conclude that consciousness has no effects on the\nphysical world. On this view human beings are \u2018conscious\nautomata\u2019, as T. H. Huxley put it: all physical events, human\nbehavior included, are explicable in terms of physical processes; and\nthe phenomena of consciousness are causally inert by-products \u2014\nepiphenomena (see James 1890, Chapter 5). It eventually became clear\nthat this view entailed there could be purely physical organisms\nexactly like us except for lacking consciousness. G. F. Stout argued\nthat if epiphenomenalism (the more familiar name for the\n\u2018conscious automaton\u2019 theory) is true,\n\nit ought to be quite credible that the constitution and course of\nnature would be otherwise just the same as it is if there were not and\nnever had been any experiencing individuals. Human bodies would still\nhave gone through the motions of making and using bridges, telephones\nand telegraphs, of writing and reading books, of speaking in\nParliament, of arguing about materialism, and so on. There can be no\ndoubt that this is prima facie incredible to Common Sense\n(Stout 1931: 138f.).\n\n\nWhat Stout describes here and finds prima facie incredible is\na zombie world: an entire world whose physical processes are closed\nunder causation (as the epiphenomenalists he was attacking held) and\nexactly duplicate those in the actual world, but where there are no\nconscious experiences.\n\nSimilar ideas were current in discussions of physicalism in the 1970s.\nAs a counterexample to the psychophysical identity theory there was an\n\u2018imitation man\u2019, whose \u2018brain-states exactly\nparalleled ours in their physico-chemical properties\u2019 but who\nfelt no pains and saw no colors (Campbell 1970). Zombies were put\nforward as a counterexample to physicalism in general, and arguments\ndevised to back up the intuition that they are possible (Kirk 1974a,\n1974b). However, these arguments fell short of their target because\nthey depended on much the same cluster of intuitions as the original\nidea.\n\nOther kinds of systems were envisaged which behaved like normal human\nbeings, or were even functionally like human beings, but lacked the\n\u2018qualia\u2019 we have (Block 1980a, 1980b, 1981; Shoemaker\n1975, 1981). (Roughly, qualia are the properties by which we classify\nexperiences according to \u2018what they are like\u2019: what it is\nlike to smell roasting coffee beans, for example. Even physicalists\ncan use this expression, although unlike dualists they take qualia to\nbe physical.) The most systematic use of the zombie idea against\nphysicalism is by David Chalmers 1996, whose important contributions\nto the debate will be considered shortly.\n\nIf zombies are to be counterexamples to physicalism, it is not enough\nfor them to be behaviorally and functionally like normal human beings:\nplenty of physicalists accept that merely behavioral or functional\nduplicates of ourselves might lack qualia. Zombies must be like normal\nhuman beings in all physical respects, and they must have the\nphysical properties that physicalists suppose we have. This requires\nthem to be subject to the causal closure of the physical, which is why\ntheir supposed lack of consciousness is a challenge to physicalism. If\ninstead they were to be conceived of as creatures whose behavior could\nnot be explained physically, physicalists would have no reason to\nbother with the idea: there is plenty of evidence that, as\nepiphenomenalists hold, our movements actually are explicable in\nphysical terms (see e.g. Papineau 2002).\n\nThe usual assumption is that none of us is actually a zombie, and that\nzombies cannot exist in our world. The central question, however, is\nnot whether zombies can exist in our world, but whether they, or a\nwhole zombie world (which is sometimes a more appropriate idea to work\nwith), are possible in some broader sense.\n2. Zombies and physicalism\n\nA metaphor of Saul Kripke\u2019s helps to show how the zombie idea\nthreatens physicalism (Kripke 1972/80, 153f.). Imagine God creating\nthe world and deciding to bring into existence the whole of the purely\nphysical universe. Having created this physical universe, did he have\nto do any more work to provide for consciousness? Answering yes to\nthis question implies there is more to consciousness than the physical\nfacts alone can supply. If nothing else, it implies that consciousness\ndepends at least partly on nonphysical properties, ones that would not\nexist in a purely physical world; it would be a zombie world.\nPhysicalists, on the other hand, are committed to answering no. They\nhave to say that by fixing the purely physical facts, God did\neverything necessary to fix the mental facts about the organisms\nthereby created, including their thoughts, feelings, emotions, and\nexperiences. In other words, it seems that physicalists must say that\nin some sense the purely physical truths entail the mental truths\n(Kirk 1974a, 1974b argued that physicalism requires an\n\u2018Entailment Thesis\u2019 to that effect). If indeed fixing the\nphysical facts alone is enough to fix the mental facts, then a zombie\nworld is impossible. \n\nNot everyone agrees that physicalism entails the impossibility of\nzombies. One suggestion is that physicalists can concede there are\npossible worlds which are exact duplicates of our world in all purely\nphysical respects, but where the physical properties which give rise\nto consciousness in our world are prevented from doing so by\nnonphysical items which block consciousness. That would let\nphysicalists consistently allow the possibility of zombie worlds\n(Leuenberger 2008. On such \u2018blockers\u2019 see Hawthorne 2002b;\nChalmers 2010, 163\u2013165). This approach, however, is inconsistent\nwith maintaining that actual conscious states are either identical\nwith or constituted by physical or functional states. If my conscious\nstate is the same as or constituted by a physical state, then there is\nno possible world where the latter exists without the former. It is\ntherefore not clear that physicalists can consistently allow the\npossibility of consciousness-blockers. Lei Zhong 2021 takes a very\ndifferent approach, challenging the widely held view that physicalism\ncommits one to the supervenience of the mental on the physical. \n\nBut what kind of impossibility is relevant here? Physicalists cannot\njust say zombies are ruled out by the laws of nature, since even\ndualists can agree they are impossible in that sense: that it is by\nnomological necessity that the physical facts about us bring\nconsciousness with them. Physicalism therefore needs something\nstronger. \n\nTwo further kinds of necessity are usually considered: logical and\nmetaphysical. Now, many philosophers (largely influenced by the zombie\nidea) believe the connection from physical facts to consciousness\ncannot be logical even in a broad sense. And certainly the conceptual\nscheme of physics does not appear to leave room for logical\nlinks from physical to phenomenal (see e.g. Kriegel 2011; Stoljar\n2006). However, some argue that nevertheless zombies are not really\nconceivable at all (Kirk 2005, 2008, 2013; Tye 2006); Kirk 2013 also\nmaintains that although the physical facts do not entail the truth\nabout conscious experience a priori, they nevertheless entail\nit by logical necessity. \n\nStill, many physicalists hold that what guarantees the impossibility\nof zombies is \u2018metaphysical\u2019 necessity. Typically they\nmaintain that states of phenomenal consciousness are identical with\nphysical states, and that these identities are necessary a posteriori\nas argued by Kripke (see e.g. McLaughlin 2005, and for criticism,\nStoljar 2000). But the vocabulary of possibility and necessity is\nslippery. For example there is disagreement over whether logical and\nmetaphysical possibility are different (section 3.1 below); when\nKripke (1972/80) writes of \u2018logical\u2019 and\n\u2018metaphysical\u2019 possibility he seems to use those words\ninterchangeably (Yablo 1999: 457n.), and some use\n\u2018logical\u2019 where others prefer \u2018conceptual\u2019\n(Chalmers 1999: 477); compare Latham 2000, 72f.).\n\nMany think that if the physical facts entail consciousness by\nmetaphysical necessity, then physicalists can maintain that even\nthough zombies are metaphysically impossible, they are still\nconceivable (Balog 2012; Loar 1990/97; McLaughlin 2005;\nSections 5.1, 5.2 below). To the contrary, Chalmers argues that\nconceivability actually entails metaphysical possibility. If he is\nright, then that popular brand of physicalism is mistaken. The\nso-called \u2018conceivability argument\u2019 for the possibility of\nzombies will provide a focus for discussing some of the main problems\nraised by the zombie idea.\n3. The conceivability argument for the possibility of zombies\n\nThe simplest version of this argument goes:\n\nZombies are conceivable.\nWhatever is conceivable is possible.\nTherefore zombies are possible.\n\n\n(Kripke used a similar argument in his 1972/80. For versions of it see\nChalmers 1996, 93\u2013171; 2010, 141\u2013205; Levine 2001; Nagel\n1974; Stoljar 2001. Michael Pelczar (2021) argues for the same\nconclusion without appealing to conceivability.) Clearly the\nconceivability argument is valid. However, both its premisses are\nproblematic. They are unclear as stated, and controversial even when\nclarified. A key question is how we should understand\n\u2018conceivable\u2019 in this context.\n\nMany philosophers are willing to concede that zombies are conceivable\nin some sense (e.g. Hill 1997; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Loar 1999;\nYablo 1999). However, that sense is sometimes quite broad. For\nexample, a claim that \u2018there are no substantive a priori ties\nbetween the concept of pain and the concept of C-fiber\nstimulation\u2019 has been backed up by the point that \u2018it is\nin principle possible to master either of these concepts fully without\nhaving mastered the other\u2019 (Hill 1997, 76). By that standard,\nthough, it would be conceivable that the ratio of a circle\u2019s\ncircumference to its diameter is a rational number, when it\nisn\u2019t. If conceivability in that sense entailed possibility, it\nwould be both possible and impossible for the ratio to be rational;\nwhich would make such conceivability useless for the purposes of the\nconceivability argument. So understood, premiss (1) would be easy to\nswallow; but (2) would have to be rejected. Evidently, the lower the\nthreshold for conceivability, the easier it is to accept (1) \u2014\nbut the harder it is to accept (2). So the kind of conceivability\ninvoked in premisses (1) and (2) needs to be strongly constrained. A\ncommon and useful definition, which will be followed here, is:\nsomething is conceivable if and only if it cannot be ruled out a\npriori. (For sophistication of these and related ideas see\nChalmers 1999, 477; 2002; 2007; 2010; and 5.1 below.) \n\nJoseph Levine discusses a version of the conceivability argument,\nseeing the conceivability of zombies as \u2018the principal\nmanifestation of the explanatory gap\u2019 (2001: 79). In his view,\nwhat creates this gap is the epistemological problem of\nexplaining how the phenomenal is related to the physical. He sees no\nway to solve this problem, and thinks it remains even if zombies are\nimpossible.\n\nCampbell, Copeland and Deng 2017 argue that, quite generally, for any\nconceivability argument there is a corresponding \u2018mirror\nargument\u2019 which can be rejected only at the cost of undermining\nthe main argument, and conclude that all conceivability arguments are\n\u2018logically bankrupt\u2019. \n\nWe now face two key questions: Are zombies conceivable in the sense\nexplained? If they are conceivable, does it follow that they are\npossible? Only if the answer to both questions is yes will the\nconceivability argument succeed. We can take them in that order.\n4. Are zombies conceivable?\n\nThose who exploited the zombie idea in the 1970s typically assumed\nwithout argument that zombies are not just conceivable but possible\n(e. g. Campbell 1970, Nagel 1970). When Chalmers reactivated the idea\nhe found the conceivability of zombies \u2018obvious\u2019,\nremarking that \u2018it certainly seems that a coherent situation is\ndescribed; I can discern no contradiction in the description\u2019\n(1996, p. 96). However, he also recognized that this intuition cannot\nbe relied on. The nature of conscious experience is after all hard to\nunderstand: what strikes some people as obviously possible could still\nturn out to harbour hidden contradictions (Nagel 1998; Stoljar 2001).\nClearly, those who maintain that zombies are conceivable must provide\njustification, recognizing that, being an epistemic claim dependent on\nour cognitive abilities, it is defeasible.\n4.1 Arguments for the conceivability of zombies\n\nChalmers (1996) set out five arguments against the view that there is\nan a priori entailment from physical facts to mental facts\n\u2014 and so for the view that zombies are conceivable.\nEach argument would directly or indirectly reinforce the intuitive\nappeal of the zombie idea. The first will be considered shortly; the\nother four appeal respectively to the alleged possibility of\n\u2018inverted spectrum\u2019 without physical difference; the\nalleged impossibility of learning about conscious experience on the\nbasis of purely physical information; Jackson\u2019s (1982)\n\u2018knowledge argument\u2019 (related to the last); and what\nChalmers calls \u2018the absence of analysis\u2019: the point being\nthat his opponents \u2018will have to give us some idea of\nhow the existence of consciousness might be entailed by the\nphysical facts\u2019, when (assuming the other arguments work)\n\u2018any attempt to demonstrate such an entailment is doomed to\nfailure\u2019 (1996, p. 104). \n\nHis first argument goes roughly as follows. Suppose a population of\ntiny people disable your brain and replicate its functions themselves,\nwhile keeping the rest of your body in working order (see Block\n1980a); each homunculus uses a cell phone to perform the\nsignal-receiving and -transmitting functions of an individual neuron.\nWould such a system be conscious? Intuitively one may be inclined to\nsay not. Some, notably functionalists, bite the bullet and answer yes.\nHowever, the argument does not depend on assuming that the\nhomunculus-head would not be conscious. It depends only on the\nassumption that its not being conscious is conceivable\n\u2014 which many people find reasonable. In Chalmers\u2019s words,\nall that matters here is that when we say the system might lack\nconsciousness, \u2018a meaningful possibility is being expressed, and\nit is an open question whether consciousness arises or not\u2019\n(1996, p. 97). If he is right, then conceivably the system is not\nconscious. In that case it is already very much like a zombie, the\nonly difference being that it has little people where a zombie has\nneurons. And why should that make a difference to whether the\nsituation is conceivable? Why should switching from homunculi to\nneurons necessarily switch on the light of consciousness? (For doubts\nabout the assumption that it is conceivable that the homunculus-head\nlacks consciousness, see e.g. Loar 1990/1997, pp. 613f.)\n\nOther considerations favoring the conceivability of zombies can be\nfound in Block 1995, 2002; Levine 2001; Searle 1992. Chalmers 2010\ndevelops his defense further. Brian Cutter 2020 offers an\nanti-materialist modal argument which does not rely on the assumption\nthat the physical truths are compatible with the absence of\nconsciousness.\n4.2 Arguments against the conceivability of zombies\n\nAlthough in the past it was quite widely accepted that zombies are\nconceivable, skepticism has grown. Before considering direct attacks\non the idea, let us briefly recall three views which once appeared to\nsupport the claim that we can know a priori that dualism is\nfalse \u2014 hence, on reasonable assumptions, that zombies are not\nconceivable. \n\nThe first is verificationism, according to which a (declarative)\nsentence is meaningful just in case its truth or falsity can be\nverified. This entails that unverifiable sentences are literally\nmeaningless, so that no metaphysical claim according to which\nunobservable nonphysical items exist can be true. However, since our\nability to think and talk about our experiences is itself a problem\nfor verificationism, to presuppose this view when attacking the zombie\nidea would beg the question. The second view appeals to\nWittgenstein\u2019s private language argument. Although not crudely\nverificationistic, it depends on the assumption that in order for\nwords to be meaningful, their use must be open to public checking. But\nsince this checkability assumption, if sound, would prove that we\ncannot talk about qualia in the ways defenders of the zombie\npossibility think we can, it too seems question-begging in the present\ncontext. According to the third view, behaviorism, there is no more to\nhaving mental states than being disposed to behave in certain ways. As\na possible basis for attacking the zombie idea, behaviorism is in a\nsimilar situation to verificationism and the private language\nargument. Zombies would satisfy all behavioral conditions for full\nconsciousness, so that if we could know a priori that behaviorism was\ncorrect, zombie worlds would be inconceivable for that reason. It\nseems unlikely, though, that behaviorism can be shown to be correct.\n(Dennett 1991 defends a position with strong affinities to\nbehaviorism, though it might be better classified as a variety of\nfunctionalism). \n\nFunctionalism is a much more widely supported approach to the mental.\nAccording to it, mental states are not just a matter of behavior and\ndispositions, but of causal or other functional relations among\nsensory inputs, internal states, and behavioral outputs. (It is\nimportant to take account of internal functions not necessarily\nreflected in behavioral dispositions, otherwise functionalism falls to\nthe usual objections to behaviorism, such as the\n\u2018homunculus-head\u2019 described in the last section (Kirk\n2005, 2013, 2017).) Now, since zombies would satisfy all the\nfunctional conditions for full consciousness, functionalism entails\nthat zombies are impossible \u2014 though it would obviously be\nquestion-begging to presuppose it when attacking the zombie idea.\nIncreasingly sophisticated versions of functionalism are being\ndeveloped, however, and any arguments for it are a fortiori arguments\nagainst the possibility of zombies. (For defenses of functionalism\nagainst zombies see Dennett 1991; 1995; 1999; Kirk 2017; Shoemaker\n1999; Tye 2006; 2008; for doubts about functionalism\u2019s capacity\nto deal with zombies see for example Harnad 1995.)\n\nApart from broad-front functionalist theories of the mental, there are\nmore narrowly focused attacks on the conceivability of zombies, some\nof which are noted below. \n\nCan we really imagine zombies? Daniel Dennett thinks those\nwho accept the conceivability of zombies have failed to imagine them\nthoroughly enough: \u2018they invariably underestimate the task of\nconception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that\nviolates their own definition\u2019 (1995, p. 322. Marcus 2004 makes\na related point). Given his broadly functionalist model of\nconsciousness, he argues, we can see why the \u2018putative contrast\nbetween zombies and conscious beings is illusory\u2019 (325. See also\nhis 1991; 1999). Consciousness is \u2018not a single wonderful\nseparable thing \u2026 but a huge complex of many different\ninformational capacities\u2019 (1995, 324. Cottrell 1999 supports\nthis approach).\n\nThe \u2018epistemic approach\u2019. Stoljar (2006, 2020)\nemphasizes that the conceivability argument presupposes we have a\ncomplete knowledge of the relevant physical facts, when it is likely\nthat we don\u2019t. If that is right, we cannot properly conceive of\nthe possibilities in question, in which case premiss (1) of the\nconceivability argument is false. A bonus of this view is that it\nleaves us free to suppose there is a reductive explanation of\nconsciousness \u2014 that the physical facts are such that there is\nconsciousness in all possible worlds where those facts obtain \u2014\neven when we don\u2019t know what those facts are.\n\nZombies\u2019 utterances. Suppose I smell roasting coffee\nbeans and say, \u2018Mm! I love that smell!\u2019. Everyone would\nrightly assume I was talking about my experience. But now suppose my\nzombie twin produces the same utterance. He too seems to be talking\nabout an experience, but in fact he isn\u2019t because he\u2019s\njust a zombie. Is he mistaken? Is he lying? Could his utterance\nsomehow be interpreted as true, or is it totally without truth value?\nNigel Thomas (1996) argues that \u2018any line that zombiphiles take\non these questions will get them into serious trouble\u2019.\n\nKnowing about and referring to qualia. Recall that by\ndefinition a zombie world is just like our world as physicalists\nsuppose it to be, but without consciousness. Since this implies that\nconsciousness depends on something nonphysical, it follows that\nzombies (assuming they are possible in the first place) could be made\nconscious by the addition of something nonphysical, which might as\nwell be qualia. And given that a zombie world would be causally\nclosed, these qualia would have to be causally inert: perhaps still\ncaused by the correlated physical processes, perhaps just parallel to\nthem. It therefore seems that if a zombie world is conceivable, so is\nepiphenomenalism. (Of course this does not require epiphenomenalism to\nbe actually true as well as conceivable.) If that is correct,\nobjections to the conceivability of epiphenomenalism are also\nobjections to the conceivability of zombies, the most obvious of these\nbeing simply that experiences have effects on behavior. A less obvious\nobjection starts from the fact that we refer to and know\nabout our conscious experiences \u2014 which can hardly be\ndenied, since otherwise we could not be discussing these ideas in the\nfirst place. The objection appeals to the widely held view that\nwhatever we can know about or refer to must have effects on us, if\nonly indirectly (Kripke 1972/80). On that basis our counterparts in\nepiphenomenalistic worlds could not know about or refer to their\nqualia, with the consequence that (given the above reasoning) neither\nepiphenomenalistic worlds nor zombie worlds are conceivable.\n\nTo this attack Chalmers replies that the crucial consideration is that\nwe are \u2018acquainted\u2019 with our experiences. This\n\u2018intimate epistemic relation\u2019 both ensures that we can\nrefer to experiences and also justifies our claims to know about them.\nSince, in contrast, our zombie twins have no experiences, what appear\nto be their judgments about experience are unjustified. Chalmers\nsuggests that even if qualia have no causal influence on our\njudgments, their mere presence in the appropriate physical context\nensures that our thoughts are about those qualia. He thinks it also\nconstitutes justification for our knowledge claims even if experiences\nare not explanatorily relevant to making the judgments in question\n(Chalmers 1996, 172\u2014209; 1999, 493f; see also his 2003,\n2010).\n\nThe problem of epistemic contact. Just now it seemed that if\nzombies are conceivable, then epiphenomenalist and parallelist worlds\nare also conceivable. In that case the friends of zombies must explain\nhow the epiphenomenal qualia in such worlds could possibly be objects\nof acquaintance, or indeed make any sort of intimate contribution to\npeople\u2019s lives; and here Kirk (2005; 2008) suggests the zombie\nidea faces a further difficulty. This emerges when we consider such\nthings as attending to, thinking about, comparing and \u2014\nespecially \u2014 remembering our experiences. These activities bring\nus into \u2018epistemic contact\u2019 with them and involve\ncognitive processing, which in turn involves changes causing other\nchanges. Being causally inert, the epiphenomenal qualia themselves\ncould not do that processing; so if they actually constitute our\nexperiences (as epiphenomenalism and parallelism imply) then the\nnecessary processing must be purely physical. The trouble is that the\nzombie story appears to make it impossible for such processing to put\nus into epistemic contact with epiphenomenal qualia. This is because\nthe only resources it can appeal to for that purpose are the assumed\ncausation of qualia by neural processes and their isomorphism with\nthem: factors which cannot do the necessary cognitive work (Kirk 2005;\n2008). If that is right, the notions of epiphenomenal qualia and\nzombies lead to a contradiction. They imply a conception of\nconsciousness which requires people to be in epistemic contact with\ntheir qualia, while at the same time ruling out the possibility of\nsuch contact.\n\n\u2018Powerful qualities\u2019. Another interesting\nobjection to the zombie idea is based on the (controversial) idea of\n\u2018powerful qualities\u2019: the view that all properties are\nboth dispositional and qualitative, and indeed that a thing\u2019s\ndispositions are identical with its qualities. Alexander Carruth\n(2016), for example, argues that the conceivability argument\npresupposes that while physical properties are dispositional,\nphenomenal ones are qualitative. On that basis a zombie duplicate of\nour world would instantiate our world\u2019s dispositional properties\nbut not its phenomenal ones. The powerful qualities view rules that\nout a priori, making it not even conceivable. For if a\nthing\u2019s dispositions are identical with its qualities, nothing\ncan instantiate certain dispositional properties without also\ninstantiating all qualities supposedly identical with them. Countering\nthis line of argument, Henry Taylor (2017) claims it depends on an\nimplausible account of the distinction between the physical and the\nphenomenal, arguing in particular that the physical cannot be confined\nto the dispositional. \n\nFor other attacks on the conceivability of zombies see Balog 1999;\nCottrell 1999; Harnad 1995; Kirk 2005, 2008, 2013; Marcus 2004;\nShoemaker 1999; Stoljar 2001; Tye 2006. \n5. Does conceivability entail possibility?\n\nPremise (2) of the conceivability argument is: Whatever is conceivable\nis possible. It has been attacked from several angles, as follows.\n\n5.1 Objections based on a posteriori necessity\n\nA number of philosophers argue that Kripke\u2019s ideas about a\nposteriori necessary truth facilitate the defense of physicalism. They\nurge that even if a zombie world is conceivable, that does not\nestablish it is possible in the way that matters. Conceivability is an\nepistemic notion, they say, while possibility is a metaphysical one:\n\u2018It is false that if one can in principle conceive that P, then\nit is logically possible that P; \u2026 Given psychophysical\nidentities, it is an \u2018a posteriori\u2019 fact that any physical\nduplicate of our world is exactly like ours in respect of positive\nfacts about sensory states\u2019 (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, 446. See\nalso Hill 1997; Loar 1990/1997; 1999; McLaughlin 2005; Webster 2006).\nSome philosophers reject even the assumption that conceivability is a\nguide to possibility, challenging the view that the burden of\nproof is on those who deny the zombie possibility (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Yablo 1993).\n\nChalmers has responded in several places (1996, 131\u2013134; 1999,\n476\u20137; 2010, 141\u2013205). His most detailed version of the\nconceivability argument (2010) uses the framework of two-dimensional\nsemantics. This enables him to distinguish two kinds of possibility\nand two corresponding kinds of conceivability. In the\n\u2018primary\u2019 sense conceivability entails possibility; for\nexample it is conceivable that water should have been a substance\nchemically different from H2O. In the other, \u2018secondary\u2019\nsense, it is neither conceivable nor possible that water should have\nbeen chemically different. The difficulty for the conceivability\nargument can be expressed by saying that even if zombie worlds are\nprimarily conceivable and therefore primarily possible, it does not\nfollow that they are also secondarily possible. And a posteriori\nphysicalists will typically deny that it follows, on the ground that\nonly the secondary possibility of zombie worlds would entail the\nfalsity of physicalism. At this point Chalmers in effect presents his\nopponents with a dilemma, which is (crudely summarizing his\nconclusions) that either the primary conceivability of zombies does\nafter all entail their secondary possibility, in which case the\nconceivability argument works and materialism is false; or else\n\u2018Russellian monism\u2019, briefly considered at Section 5.3\nbelow, is true. (See also Jackson 1998; and for discussions, Brueckner\n2002; Loar 1999; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Piccinini 2017;\nSebasti\u00e1n 2017; Shoemaker 1999; Soames 2005; Yablo\n1999.) \n5.2 The phenomenal concept strategy\n\nMany physicalists hold that both the zombie idea and Frank\nJackson\u2019s knowledge argument can be dealt with through a proper\nunderstanding of the nature of phenomenal concepts (roughly, the\nconcepts we use when conveying the character of our experiences: for\nexample \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018the way I see blue\u2019).\nExponents of the conceivability argument hold that the supposed\n\u2018explanatory gap\u2019 between the physical and the phenomenal\n\u2014 which is expressed in the idea that zombies are conceivable\n\u2014 brings with it an ontological gap. According to the\n\u2018phenomenal concept strategy\u2019 (Stoljar 2005) there is\nreally only a conceptual gap: phenomenal concepts have features which\nmislead us into supposing there is an ontological gap in addition to\nan epistemic one, when there isn\u2019t.\n\nThus it is argued that even if a zombie world is conceivable, it does\nnot follow that there are nonphysical properties in our world. If that\nis right, physicalists can concede the conceivability of zombies while\ninsisting that the properties we pick out in terms of phenomenal\nconcepts are physical. \u2018Given that properties are constituted by\nthe world and not by our concepts\u2019, Brian Loar comments,\n\u2018it is fair of the physicalist to request a justification of the\nassumption that conceptually distinct concepts must express\nmetaphysically distinct properties\u2019 (Loar 1999, 467; see also\nhis 1997). He also argues that phenomenal concepts are\n\u2018recognitional\u2019, in contrast to physical concepts, which\nare \u2018theoretical\u2019. Phenomenal concepts, Loar says,\n\u2018express the very properties they pick out, as Kripke observed\nin the case of \u2018pain\u2019\u2019 (1999, 468). He thinks these\npoints explain the conceivability of a zombie world, while maintaining\nthat there is no possible world in which the relevant physical\nproperties are distinct from consciousness. Chalmers objects that\nLoar\u2019s account does not justify the view that physical concepts\nrefer to phenomenal properties (1999, 488). He argues further (2007)\nthat exponents of this approach face a dilemma. Let C be whichever\npsychological \u2018key features\u2019 we have but zombies lack.\nThen if it is conceivable that the purely physical facts about us\nshould have held without C, then C is not physicalistically\nexplicable. On the other hand, if that is not conceivable, then in his\nview C cannot explain our epistemic situation as contrasted with that\nof zombies. So either C is not physicalistically explicable, or it\ncannot explain our epistemic situation. (For discussions see Ball\n2009; Balog 2012; Carruthers 2005; Chalmers 1999; 2007; 2010; Crane\n2005; Loar 1990/97; Papineau 2002; Pereboom 2011; Stoljar 2000; Tye\n2008.) \n5.3 Russellian monism \n\nFollowing Russell (1927), some philosophers suggest that physics tells\nus only about the \u2018structural\u2019 properties of things\n\u2014 such as their dispositions and nomic relations \u2014 rather\nthan the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 properties which supposedly underlie\nand account for those structural properties. Thus Daniel Stoljar\n(2001) argues that there are two distinct notions of the physical and\ncorrespondingly of physicalism, depending on whether one appeals only\nto what is provided for by physics or also to the intrinsic properties\nof physical objects. He suggests that even if one of the corresponding\ntwo versions of the conceivability argument is sound, the other is not\n\u2014 because (roughly) physicalists can always object that, since\nwe do not know enough about the physical world (in particular, about\nits intrinsic properties), we cannot \u2018strongly\u2019 conceive\nof the possibility of zombies.\n\nThese ideas are exploited in what Chalmers calls \u2018Russellian\nmonism\u2019 (a variety of neutral monism). In our world, he\nsuggests, the underlying intrinsic properties might be\n\u2018phenomenal properties, or they might be protophenomenal\nproperties: properties that collectively constitute phenomenal\nproperties when organized in the appropriate way\u2019 (2010: p.\n151); while in some other worlds the corresponding intrinsic physical\nproperties did not provide for consciousness. If the intrinsic\nproperties which supposedly provide for our consciousness are\nnevertheless classified as physical, exponents can deny the\npossibility of zombies if these are understood to be our\n\u2018full\u2019 physical duplicates. At the same time they can\nconcede the possibility of zombies which duplicate us only in their\nstructural properties. As he points out, this view is \u2018a highly\ndistinctive form of physicalism that has much in common with property\ndualism and that many physicalists will want to reject\u2019\n(Chalmers 2010, p. 152; see also Pereboom 2011). One obstacle to\ncounting it as physicalism is that it seems unable to explain why the\nspecial intrinsic properties in our world should provide for\nconsciousness, while those which perform the same functions in those\nother worlds do not: this has to be accepted as a brute fact. \n\nPhilip Goff (2010; see also his 2017) suggests that this loophole for\nRussellian versions of physicalism weakens the zombie argument. He\nrecommends instead an argument from ghosts: pure subjects of\nexperience without any physical nature. He argues that such ghosts are\nconceivable and possible, and that they provide an argument against\nphysicalism which leaves no loophole for Russellian monism.\n(Physicalists are likely to object that arguments against the\nconceivability of zombies can also be mobilized against ghosts.) \n5.4 Other objections \n\nSpecial factors. It has been suggested that there are special\nfactors at work in the psychophysical case which have a strong\ntendency to mislead us. For example it is claimed that what enables us\nto imagine or conceive of states of consciousness is a different\ncognitive faculty from what enables us to conceive of physical facts:\n\u2018there are significant differences between the cognitive factors\nresponsible for Cartesian intuitions [such as those about zombies] and\nthose responsible for modal intuitions of a wide variety of other\nkinds\u2019 (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, p. 449. See also Hill 1997).\nThe suggestion is that these differences help to explain the ease with\nwhich we seem able to conceive of zombies, and the difficulty we have\nin understanding the claim that they are nevertheless impossible.\n\nConditional analysis. Another line of objection rests on\nconditional analyses of the concept of qualia. Roughly, the idea is\nthat if there actually are certain nonphysical properties\nwhich fit our conception of qualia, then that is what qualia are, in\nwhich case zombies are conceivable; but if there are no such\nnonphysical properties, then qualia are whichever physical properties\nperform the appropriate functions, and zombies are not conceivable. It\nis argued that this approach enables physicalists to accept that the\npossibility of zombies is conceivable, while denying that zombies are\nconceivable (Hawthorne 2002a; Braddon-Mitchell 2003. For criticism see\nAlter 2007; Chalmers 2010, pp. 159\u201359).\n\nCausal essentialism. According to the theory of causal\nessentialism, the causal properties of physical properties are\nessential to them. Brian Garrett (2009) exploits this theory to argue\nthat the zombie argument against physicalism depends on broadly Humean\nassumptions about the laws of nature and property identity which\npresuppose the falsity of causal essentialism. If we reject those\nassumptions and accept that some physical properties have essentially\nthe capacity to produce consciousness, then \u2018we cannot accept\nthe genuine possibility of zombie worlds\u2019 even if such worlds\nare conceivable (see also Aranyosi 2010).\n\nMore on zombies\u2019 utterances. Consider a zombie world\nthat is an exact physical duplicate of our world and contains zombie\ntwins of all philosophers, including some who appeal to the\nconceivability argument. Katalin Balog (1999) argues that while their\nutterances would be meaningful, their sentences would not always mean\nwhat they do in our mouths. She further argues \u2014 to oversimplify\n\u2014 that if the conceivability argument were sound in actual\nphilosophers\u2019 mouths, then it would be sound in the mouths of\nzombie philosophers too. But since by hypothesis physicalism is true\nin their world, their argument is not sound. Therefore the\nconceivability argument used by actual philosophers is not sound\neither. If this argument works, it has the piquant feature that\n\u2018the zombies that antiphysicalists think possible in the end\nundermine the arguments that allege to establish their\npossibility\u2019 (502. Chalmers offers brief replies in his 2003;\n2010, pp. 159\u201360).\n\nThe anti-zombie argument for physicalism. The conceivability\nargument \u2014 which assumes physicalism entails that zombies are\nimpossible \u2014 purports to refute it by showing they are possible.\nAs we saw, the simplest version of this argument goes: (1) zombies are\nconceivable; (2) whatever is conceivable is possible; (3) therefore\nzombies are possible. However, \u2018anti-zombies\u2019 \u2014\nduplicates of ourselves made conscious by the purely physical facts\n(Frankish 2007) \u2014 also seem conceivable. So we have a parallel\nargument: (1*) anti-zombies are conceivable; (2) whatever is\nconceivable is possible; (3*) therefore anti-zombies are possible. But\n(3) and (3*) cannot both be true, since if the purely physical facts\nabout anti-zombies make them conscious, then the exactly similar\nphysical facts about zombies make them conscious too, and they are not\nzombies after all (Frankish 2007; Marton 1998; Piccinini 2017;\nSturgeon 2000, pp. 114\u2013116). One moral is that we should reject\nthe inference from conceivability to possibility. (Brown 2010 argues\nthat if anti-zombies are conceivable, then zombies are inconceivable.)\nThe most promising reply for exponents of the conceivability argument\nseems to be to deny that anti-zombies are conceivable (Chalmers 2010,\n180).\n6. Other issues\n\nThe list of \u2018Related Entries\u2019 below indicates the range\nand depth of the issues raised by the zombie idea, only some of which\nhave been touched on in this entry. If zombies are really possible,\nthen not only is physicalism problematic, so are widely held views on\nother topics. Here are three striking examples.\n6.1 Mental causation\n\nDescartes accepted the common assumption that not only do physical\nevents have mental effects, but mental events have physical effects\n(for example, thinking about the political situation makes me write a\nletter). The difficulty for his dualism, it was thought, was to\nunderstand how the nonphysical could have effects on the physical. But\nif zombies are possible \u2014 which requires the physical world to\nbe causally closed \u2014 there is no work for nonphysical qualia to\ndo. In that case the difficulty is to understand how, in spite of\nappearances, the nonphysical could fail to have effects on\nthe physical. Still supposing zombies are possible, it then becomes\nhard to see any alternative to parallelism or epiphenomenalism, with\nthe radical revision of common assumptions about mental causation that\nthose views entail. True, the friends of zombies do not seem compelled\nto be epiphenomenalists or parallelists about the actual\nworld. They may be interactionists, holding that our world is not\nphysically closed, and that as a matter of actual fact nonphysical\nproperties do have physical effects. Or they may adopt some variety of\npanpsychism, according to which what is metaphysically fundamental is\nnot physical properties, but phenomenal or perhaps\n\u2018protophenomenal\u2019 ones (Chalmers 1991, 297\u2014299;\n1999, 492; Goff 2017; Strawson 2008) \u2014 a view arguably\ncompatible with the causal closure of the physical. But neither of\nthose options is easy. Abandoning causal closure appears to conflict\nwith empirical evidence; while the idea that phenomenal or\nquasi-phenomenal properties are fundamental remains obscure.\n6.2 The function of consciousness\n\nThe apparent possibility of zombies also seems to pose a problem for\nevolutionary theory. Why did creatures with qualia survive rather than\nthose creatures\u2019 zombie counterparts? If zombies could have\nsurvived, what\u2019s the use of consciousness? Owen Flanagan and\nThomas Polger have used the apparent possibility of zombies to support\nthe claim that \u2018There are as yet no credible stories about why\nsubjects of experience emerged, why they might have won \u2014 or\nshould have been expected to win \u2014 an evolutionary battle\nagainst very intelligent zombie-like information-sensitive\norganisms\u2019 (1995, 321): a problem not faced by those who reject\nthe possibility of zombies. One response on behalf of those who do\naccept it is to suggest that there might be fundamental laws linking\nthe phenomenal to the physical. Such laws would not depend on whether\nconscious creatures ever happened to evolve, in which case, arguably,\nevolution raises no special problem (Chalmers 1996, 171) \u2014\nalthough the existence of such laws would pose its own problems.\n6.3 Other minds\n\nIf qualia have no physical effects, then nothing will enable anyone to\nestablish for certain that anyone else actually has qualia.\nPhilosophers who believe they have a solid response to skepticism\nabout other minds may therefore conclude that this consequence of the\nzombie idea is enough to condemn it. Others may draw the opposite\nconclusion and take the skeptical consequence as \u2018a\nconfirmation\u2019, on the ground that we really are ignorant of\nothers\u2019 minds (Campbell 1970, 120). (Of course not all responses\nto other minds skepticism imply that zombies are inconceivable.)\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe intuitive appeal of the zombie idea can be overwhelming. But that\nwas true once of the idea that the earth stands still, and is true now\nof the idea that science can explain events without appealing to\nanything nonphysical. Some anti-physicalists believe their\nopponents\u2019 commitment makes them turn a blind eye to the\ndifficulties:\n\nSome may be led to deny the possibility [of zombies] in order to make\nsome theory come out right, but the justification of such theories\nshould ride on the question of possibility, rather than the other way\nround (Chalmers 1996, 96).\n\n\nOn the other hand, some physicalists believe the zombie idea exerts an\nirrational grip on anti-physicalist thinking, so that\n\nit is tempting to regard anti-physicalist arguments as\nrationalizations of an intuition whose independent force masks their\ntendentiousness (Loar 1990/1997, 598).\n\n\nIn spite of the fact that the arguments on both sides have become\nincreasingly sophisticated \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014\nthey have not become more persuasive. The pull in each direction\nremains strong.\n",
