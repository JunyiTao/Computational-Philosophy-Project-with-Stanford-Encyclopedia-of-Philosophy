    "main_text": "Demonstrations and Demonstrative Sciences || Knowledge of First Principles: Nous\n6.4 Knowledge of First Principles: Nous\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of knowledge of the indemonstrable first\npremises of sciences is found in Posterior Analytics II.19,\nlong regarded as a difficult text to interpret. Briefly, what he says\nthere is that it is another cognitive state, nous (translated\nvariously as \u201cinsight\u201d, \u201cintuition\u201d,\n\u201cintelligence\u201d), which knows them. There is wide\ndisagreement among commentators about the interpretation of his\naccount of how this state is reached; I will offer one possible\ninterpretation. First, Aristotle identifies his problem as explaining\nhow the principles can \u201cbecome familiar to us\u201d, using the\nsame term \u201cfamiliar\u201d (gn\u00f4rimos) that he\nused in presenting the regress problem. What he is presenting, then,\nis not a method of discovery but a process of becoming wise. Second,\nhe says that in order for knowledge of immediate premises to be\npossible, we must have a kind of knowledge of them without having\nlearned it, but this knowledge must not be as \u201cprecise\u201d as\nthe knowledge that a possessor of science must have. The kind of\nknowledge in question turns out to be a capacity or power\n(dunamis) which Aristotle compares to the capacity for\nsense-perception: since our senses are innate, i.e., develop\nnaturally, it is in a way correct to say that we know what e.g. all\nthe colors look like before we have seen them: we have the capacity to\nsee them by nature, and when we first see a color we exercise this\ncapacity without having to learn how to do so first. Likewise,\nAristotle holds, our minds have by nature the capacity to recognize\nthe starting points of the sciences.\n\nIn the case of sensation, the capacity for perception in the sense\norgan is actualized by the operation on it of the perceptible object.\nSimilarly, Aristotle holds that coming to know first premises is a\nmatter of a potentiality in the mind being actualized by experience of\nits proper objects: \u201cThe soul is of such a nature as to be\ncapable of undergoing this\u201d. So, although we cannot come to know\nthe first premises without the necessary experience, just as we cannot\nsee colors without the presence of colored objects, our minds are\nalready so constituted as to be able to recognize the right objects,\njust as our eyes are already so constituted as to be able to perceive\nthe colors that exist.\n\nIt is considerably less clear what these objects are and how it is\nthat experience actualizes the relevant potentialities in the soul.\nAristotle describes a series of stages of cognition. First is what is\ncommon to all animals: perception of what is present. Next is memory,\nwhich he regards as a retention of a sensation: only some animals have\nthis capacity. Even fewer have the next capacity, the capacity to form\na single experience (empeiria) from many repetitions of the\nsame memory. Finally, many experiences repeated give rise to knowledge\nof a single universal (katholou). This last capacity is\npresent only in humans.\n\nSee Section 7 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology\n for more on his views about mind.\n",
