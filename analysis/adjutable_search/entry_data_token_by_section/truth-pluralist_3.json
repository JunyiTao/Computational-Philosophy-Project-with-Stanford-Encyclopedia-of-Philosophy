    "main_text": "Motivating pluralism: the scope problem\n2. Motivating pluralism: the scope problem\n\n\nPluralists\u2019 rejection of (8) typically begins by rendering it as a\nclaim about the invariant nature of truth across all regions of\ndiscourse (Acton 1935; Wright 1992, 1996; Lynch 2000, 2001; for more\non domains see Edwards 2018b; Kim & Pedersen 2018, Wyatt 2013; Yu\n2017). Thus rendered, the claim appears to be at odds with the\nfollowing observation:\n\n(9) the plausibility of each inflationist\u2019s candidate for the\nproperty \\(F\\) differs across different regions of discourse.\n\n\n\nFor example, some theories\u2014such as correspondence\ntheories\u2014seem intuitively plausible when applied to truths about\nladders, ladles, and other ordinary objects. However, those theories\nseem much less convincing when applied to truths about comedy, fashion,\nethical mores, numbers, jurisprudential dictates, etc. Conversely,\ntheories that seem intuitively plausible when applied to legal, comic,\nor mathematical truths\u2014such as those suggesting that the nature\nof truth is coherence\u2014seem less convincing when applied to truths\nabout the empirical world.\n\n\nPluralists typically take traditional inflationary theories of truth\nto be correct in analyzing truth in terms of some substantive property\n\\(F\\). Yet, the problem with their monistic suppositions lies with\ngeneralization: a given property \\(F\\) might be necessary and\nsufficient for explaining why sentences about a certain subject matter\nare true, but no single property is necessary and sufficient for\nexplaining why \\(p\\) is true for all sentences \\(p\\), whatever its subject\nmatter. Subsequently, those theories\u2019 inability to generalize\ntheir explanatory scope beyond the select few regions of discourse for\nwhich they are intuitively plausible casts aspersion on their candidate\nfor \\(F\\). This problem has gone by various names, but has come to\nbe known as \u2018the scope problem\u2019 (Lynch 2004b, 2009; cf. Sher\n1998).\n\n\nPluralists respond to the scope problem by first rejecting (8) and\nreplacing it with:\n\n(10) truth consists in several properties \\(F_1 ,\n\\ldots ,F_n\\).\n\n\n\nWith (10), pluralists contend that the nature of truth is not a\nsingle property \\(F\\) that is invariant across all regions of\ndiscourse; rather the true sentences in different regions of discourse\nmay consist in different properties among the plurality\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) that\nconstitute truth\u2019s nature.\n\n\nThe idea that truth is grounded in various properties\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) might be\nfurther introduced by way of analogy. Consider water. We ordinarily\nthink and talk about something\u2019s being water as if it were just\none thing\u2014able to exist in different states, but nevertheless\nconsisting in just one property (H\\(_2\\)O). But it would be a\nmistake to legislate in advance that we should be monists about water,\nsince the nature of water is now known to vary more than our intuitions\nwould initially have it. The isotopic distribution of water allows for\ndifferent molecular structures, to include hydroxonium\n(H\\(_3\\)O), deuterium oxide (D\\(_2\\)O), and so-called\n\u2018semi-heavy water\u2019 (HDO). Or again, consider sugar, the\nnature of which includes glucose, fructose, lactose, cellulose, and\nsimilar other such carbohydrates. For the pluralist, so too might truth\nbe grounded as a plurality of more basic properties.\n\n\nOne reason to take pluralism about truth seriously, then, is that it\nprovides a solution to the scope problem. In rejecting the\n\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach to truth, pluralists formulate\na theory whose generality is guaranteed by accommodating the various\nproperties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) by\nwhich true sentences come to be true in different regions of discourse.\nA second and related reason is that the view promises to be\nexplanatory. Variance in the nature of truth in turn explains why\ntheories of truth perform unequally across various regions of\ndiscourse\u2014i.e., why they are descriptively adequate and\nappropriate in certain regions of discourse, but not others. For\npluralists, the existence of different kinds of truths is symptomatic\nof the non-uniform nature of truth itself. Subsequently, taxonomical\ndifferences among truths might be better understood by formulating\ndescriptive models about how the nature of truth might vary between\nthose taxa.\n",
