    "main_text": "Value and Justification of Friendship || Social Value\n2.2 Social Value\n\nAnother way to construe the question of the value of friendship is in\nmore social terms: what is the good to society of having its members\nengaged in relationships of friendship? Telfer (1970\u201371, 238)\nanswers that friendship promotes the general good \u201cby providing\na degree and kind of consideration for others\u2019 welfare which\ncannot exist outside it.\u201d Blum (1980) concurs, arguing that\nfriendship is an important source of moral excellence precisely\nbecause it essentially involves acting for the sake of your friend, a\nkind of action that can have considerable moral worth. (For similar\nclaims, see Annis 1987.)\n\nCocking & Kennett (2000) argue against this view that friendly\nacts per se are morally good, claiming that \u201cI might be\na perfectly good friend. I might just not be a perfectly moral\none\u201d (287). They support this conclusion, within their account\nof friendship as involving being directed and interpreted by\none\u2019s friend, by claiming that \u201cI am just as likely to be\ndirected by your interest in gambling at the casino as by your\ninterest in ballet\u201d (286). However, Cocking & Kennett seem\nto be insufficiently sensitive to the idea, which they accept (cf.\n284), that friends care about promoting each other\u2019s well-being.\nFor if I am concerned with your well-being and find you to be about to\nembark on an immoral course of action, I ought not, contrary to what\nCocking & Kennett suggest, blindly allow you to draw me into\njoining you; rather, I ought to try to stop you or at least get you to\nquestion whether you are doing the right thing\u2014as a matter of my\ndirecting and interpreting you. In this context, Koltonski (2016)\nargues that one ought to ensure that one\u2019s friend is properly\nengaging in moral deliberation, but then defer to one\u2019s\nfriend\u2019s judgment about what to do, even when one disagrees with\nthe moral conclusion, for such deference is a matter of properly\nrespecting the friend\u2019s moral agency.\n\nThese answers to the social value of friendship seem to apply equally\nwell to love: insofar as love essentially involves both a concern for\nyour beloved for his sake and, consequently, action on his behalf for\nhis sake, love will exhibit the same social value. Friedman (1989),\nhowever, argues that friendship itself is socially valuable in a way\nthat love is not. Understanding the intimacy of friendship in terms of\nthe sharing of values, Friedman notes that friendship can involve the\nmutual support of, in particular, unconventional values, which can be\nan important stimulus to moral progress within a community. For\n\u201cour commitments to particular persons are, in practice,\nnecessary counterbalances to our commitments to abstract\nmoral guidelines, and may, at times, take precedence over them\u201d\n(6). Consequently, the institution of friendship is valuable not just\nto the individuals but also to the community as a whole.\u00a0On the\nother hand, however, we might worry that friendship can have negative\nconsequences for society as a whole. As Thomas (1999) and Lintott\n(2015) argue, we tend to privilege in our loves and friendships\n\u201cpeople like us\u201d, which can give rise to biases in favor\nof certain social identities like race, class, and sexual orientation\nthat can perpetuate inequalities among these groups, reinforce\nepistemic injustices, and limit our moral development.\n",
