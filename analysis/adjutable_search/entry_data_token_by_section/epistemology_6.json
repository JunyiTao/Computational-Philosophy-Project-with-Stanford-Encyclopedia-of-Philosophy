    "main_text": "What is Knowledge?\n2. What is Knowledge?\n\nKnowledge is among the many kinds of cognitive success that\nepistemology is interested in understanding. Because it has attracted\nvastly more attention in recent epistemology than any other variety\nof cognitive success, we devote the present section to considering it\nin some detail. But the English word \u201cknowledge\u201d lumps\ntogether various states that are distinguished in other languages: for\ninstance, the verb \u201cto know\u201d can be translated into French\neither as \u201cconnaitre\u201d or as\n\u201csavoir\u201d, and the noun \u201cknowledge\u201d\ncan be translated into Latin as either \u201ccognitio\u201d\nor as \u201cscientia\u201d. Exactly how to individuate the\nvarious kinds of cognitive success is not something that can be\ndetermined solely by appeal to the lexicon of any particular natural\nlanguage. The present section provides a brief survey of some of the\nkinds of cognitive success that are indicated by the use of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d in English, but this is not intended to signal\nthat these kinds of cognitive success are all species of some common\ngenus. Neither, however, is it intended to signal that these kinds of\ncognitive success are not all species of some common genus: at least\nsome philosophers have taken there to be a genus, awareness, of which\nthe various kinds of knowledge are all species, and with respect to\nwhich these various kinds may all be explained (see Silva 2019 for a\ndefense of \u201cawareness first\u201d epistemology).\n",
