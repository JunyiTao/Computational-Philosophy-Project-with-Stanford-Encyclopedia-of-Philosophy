Aristotle\u2019s Method and the \u201cSchools\u201d\n\nLef\u00e8vre saw his concordist and source-based approach to\nphilosophy as a way to steer clear of the late medieval philosophical\n\u201cschools\u201d, which modern scholarship has often divided\nbetween realists (Thomists and Scotists) and nominalists (Ockham and\nothers). But, as Hoenen (2003) observes, late medieval scholars often\nsaw themselves as occupying a place in a given tradition, following\nThomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, or other leading philosophers; yet\nthis does not mean that a Scotist was a \u201crealist\u201d in all\nfields of study, and a philosopher\u2019s view on universals does not\nsystematically predict his views on other doctrines. Rather, a school\nof thought is identified by a processus or method, of which\nparticular figures such as Albert the Great or Duns Scotus were\nhistorical exemplars.\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s central claim was that Aristotle himself should\nbe the exemplar of method, not any \u201cAristotelians\u201d. He\nexhorted students to read Aristotle\u2019s own works, rather than to\nmake a career out of studying commentaries on them. His first\ncontribution to logic was a short epitome of the major logical\noperations found in Peter of Spain\u2019s Summule logicales,\nwhich he prefaced by entreating students not to get caught up in\nexponabilia, insolubilia, and sophismata,\nwhich \u201cshould be rejected from philosophy\u201d, but instead to\npass through them quickly, as if scouting in a barbarian land (1496b:\na1v; Rice 1972: 39). In his 1503 edition of Aristotle\u2019s logical\nworks, Lef\u00e8vre presented an emended text of the standard Latin\ntranslations of Boethius, with a brief commentary. The textual work\nwas necessary, he said, because previous generations, \n\n\nalthough they dealt with logic, did not actually make use of logic,\nbut of certain factious and extraneous matters, which should be\ncondemned rather than refuted. (1503a: a1v; Rice 1972: 88)\n\n\nThe result was that books of logic had become full of errors,\n\u201cnovelties\u201d (novitia), and \u201clifeless\nmatters, like so much hay\u201d (ibid.). In contrast, the commentary\nin his corrected edition would be brief and would explain\nAristotle\u2019s meaning, instead of that of his commentators.\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s textbooks were designed to help students gain\naccess to Aristotle by quickly familiarizing them with the elementary\ndefinitions of each discipline and setting these in a larger schematic\nframework. In a comment on Aristotle\u2019s Politics, he\nstressed that the integrity of different disciplines requires\nidentifying the components proper to each\u2014for example, the point\nin geometry, the monad in arithmetic, or the letters which make up\nwords in grammar (1506: a2v). This respected Aristotle\u2019s own\nmethodical admonition not to make the mistaken assumption that\nconclusions from one discipline could be applied to another\u2014his\nprohibition of metabasis. Similarly, from his earliest\nwritings, Lef\u00e8vre insisted that each discipline should follow a\ndistinctive kind of reasoning: thus\n\n\nlogic should be left to deal with logical matters, mathematics with\nmathematical matters, and divine discipline with metaphysical matters.\n(Lef\u00e8vre 1492: b4v; Rice 1970: 12)\n\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s textbooks often divided disciplines into their\nconstituent parts, sometimes visually simplified in synoptic tables;\nthe goal of such tables was to provide students with swift access to\nthe individual elements, as well as to the more general headings, of a\ngiven discipline\u2014a vision of methodical philosophy popularized\nby Peter Ramus later in the sixteenth century (Ong 1958; for an\noverview of recent literature, see Hotson 2007: 16\u201337).\n\nThe fact that each discipline had its own form of reasoning did not\nmean they could not be compared or did not point to an ultimate unity.\nAccording to Lef\u00e8vre, Aristotle also taught that disciplines\nbore an analogical relationship to one another\u2014the distinctive\nmethod of each discipline was the starting-point to this higher\nknowledge. Frequently he (and his students after him) alerted readers\nto what they believed were \u201ctraces\u201d (vestigia) or\n\u201canalogies\u201d (analogiae) which could help them to\nfind the deeper unity beneath apparently diverse phenomena. In his\nearliest introduction to natural philosophy, Lef\u00e8vre claimed\nthat there was a\n\n\nkind of secret analogy lying hidden and underneath the whole of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy, without which philosophy is inanimate\nand lifeless, like a body without the sense of touch. (1492: b2r; Rice\n1970: 6)\n\n\nThough he regularly draws attention to analogies, Lef\u00e8vre does\nnot systematically describe this \u201csecret analogy\u201d.\nInstead, he often uses analogy to compare the constituent parts of\ndifferent disciplines (Oosterhoff 2018: 77\u201385). More\ncircumstantial evidence suggests that members of his circle at least\ntoyed with the idea that analogy could be a more universal science. A\nstudent of his, Beatus Rhenanus, included in his course notes several\ntheses concerning how \u201canalogy is the science of\nsciences\u201d, that \u201cAristotle claims he finds the secrets of\nthe sciences by analogy\u201d, and \u201cwhat is known by analogy is\nknown more firmly than by demonstration\u201d (Beatus\nRhenanus\u2019s Cahier d\u2019\u00e9tudiant,\nBiblioth\u00e8que humaniste de S\u00e9lestat, MS 50, 253r). This\nfascination with analogies may explain why Lef\u00e8vre appreciated\nmathematics so much, since ancient number theory focused on the ratios\n(proportiones in Latin, analogia in Greek) between\nnumbers. For him, analogia sometimes had the ancient Greek\nmeaning of a proportion or ratio between two mathematical objects; at\nother times, it reflected analogies between the subjects of lower and\nhigher disciplines, as when he argued that mathematical reasoning\nprovided\n\n\ncertain steps, \u2026 especially if one knows the method\n(modus) of analogies and uplifting exercises\n[assurrectiones]. (Lef\u00e8vre 1517a: a2v; Rice 1972:\n380)\n\n\nHe then praised mathematics as a model for such a method:\n\n\nWhat, I ask, can give quicker, more abstract, purer analogies for\nrising to divine matters \u2026 than mathematical learning?\n(ibid.)\n\n\nIn other cases, he based analogies on structural similarities between\nthe elementary parts of an area of study (e.g., Lef\u00e8vre 1497\na3r, where he discusses the analogies of elementary parts of\ndisciplines). \n\nA method in the sixteenth century was a way of approaching a\ngiven discipline\u2014according to the Paduan school, for example,\none properly approached natural philosophy through the logical method\nof regressus. But Lef\u00e8vre believed that this kind of\nprioritizing of logic over other disciplines undermined the\ndistinctive modes of reasoning proper to each discipline. In the\nsixteenth century, one of the many uses of the word methodus\nwas to indicate a short cut, perhaps a compendious textbook, by which\na student might approach a discipline (Gilbert 1960: 59\u201360).\nIndeed, there is some evidence of this usage in Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s\nown circle. Guillaume Gontier, his student and amanuensis, explicitly\nreferred to Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s collection of introductions on\nlogic as a \u201cmethod\u201d, telling readers that\n\n\nby this extremely brief method [you] will swiftly land at the port of\nthe disciplines. (hac methodo etiam quam brevissima ad\ndisciplinarum portus ocissime appelere, 1496b: d6r\u2013v)\n\n\nIn 1502, Bruno Amerbach informed Johannes Amerbach in Basel that he\nwas attending the \u201ccursus Fabri\u201d. He assured his\nworried father, who preferred him to study with the Scotists, that the\nbare text of the Fabrists, \u201cwithout commentary\u201d (nihil\ncomentarii), would profit him in examinations (Hartmann 1942:\n146; Renaudet 1953: 404\u2013406). Among Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s\nstudents, his manuals with their epitomes, paraphrases, and short\ndescriptive notes defined philosophical study at the Coll\u00e8ge du\nCardinal Lemoine, and he began to be treated as an exemplar of\nmethod.\n\nAlthough Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s introductions were intended to\nfacilitate direct access to Aristotle and other authorities, bypassing\nthe \u201cschools\u201d, they were themselves reproduced, studied,\nand commented on, becoming, in effect, an alternative to the\n\u201cschools\u201d. The most commonly reproduced version of\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s Paraphases philosophiae naturalis\nincluded, for example, Josse Clichtove\u2019s extensive commentary;\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s introductions to logical and mathematical works\nwere likewise accompanied by similar super-commentaries. The circle of\n\u201cFabrists\u201d might be seen, in this sense, as an unwitting\nhumanist via on the Renaissance philosophical roadmap.\n",
