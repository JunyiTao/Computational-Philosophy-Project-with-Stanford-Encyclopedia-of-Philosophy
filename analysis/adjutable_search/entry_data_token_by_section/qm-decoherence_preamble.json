    "main_text": "\n\nInterference phenomena are a well-known and crucial aspect of\n quantum mechanics,\n famously exemplified by the two-slit experiment. There are many\nsituations, however, in which interference effects are artificially or\nspontaneously suppressed. The theory of decoherence is\nprecisely the study of such situations. It is is relevant (or is\nclaimed to be relevant) to a variety of questions ranging from the\nmeasurement problem to the arrow of time, and in particular to the\nquestion of whether and how the \u2018classical world\u2019 may\nemerge from quantum mechanics. (See also the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.)\n\nIn\n Section 1\n we discuss the concept of suppression of interference and give a\nsimplified survey of the theory, emphasising features that will be\nrelevant later. In fact, the term decoherence refers to two largely\noverlapping areas of research. The characteristic feature of the first\n(often called \u2018environmental\u2019 or \u2018dynamical\u2019\ndecoherence) is the study of concrete models of (spontaneous)\ninteractions between a system and its environment that lead to\nsuppression of interference effects. The second (the theory of\n\u2018decoherent histories\u2019 or \u2018consistent\nhistories\u2019) is an abstract and more general formalism capturing\nessential features of decoherence. The two are obviously closely\nrelated, and will be reviewed in turn.\n Section 2\n then criticises the claim that decoherence solves the measurement\nproblem of quantum mechanics, and discusses the exacerbation of the\nproblem through the inclusion of environmental interactions. It is\nthus important to consider not decoherence by itself, but the\ninterplay between decoherence and the various approaches to the\nfoundations of quantum mechanics that provide possible solutions to\nthe measurement problem and related puzzles.\n Section 3\n deals with the role of decoherence in relation to a number of such\napproaches, including mainstream foundational approaches such as\nEverett, Bohm and GRW, traditional approaches such as those by von\nNeumann, Heisenberg and Bohr, and a few more. Finally, in\n Section 4\n we describe the overall picture of the emergent structures that\nresult from this use of decoherence, as well as a few more speculative\n applications.[1]\n\nSuppression of interference has featured in many papers since the\nbeginning of quantum mechanics, such as Mott\u2019s (1929) analysis\nof \\(\\alpha\\)-particle tracks. The modern foundation of decoherence as a\nsubject in its own right was laid by H.-D. Zeh in the early 1970s (Zeh\n1970, 1973). Equally influential were the papers by W. Zurek from the\nearly 1980s (Zurek 1981, 1982). Some of these earlier examples of\ndecoherence (e.g., suppression of interference between left-handed and\nright-handed states of a molecule) are mathematically more accessible\nthan more recent ones. A concise and readable introduction to the\ntheory is provided by Zurek in Physics Today (1991). This\narticle was followed by publication of several letters with\nZurek\u2019s replies (1993), which highlight controversial issues.\nMore recent surveys are given in Zeh (2003a), Zurek (2003), and in the\nbooks by Giulini et al. (1996, second edition Joos et\nal. 2003), and by Schlosshauer (2007).\n",
