    "main_text": "The translations of Hunayn ibn Ishaq, his son Ishaq and their associates: the complete Aristotelian corpus and Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019s universe\n5. The translations of Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus, Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi and the Baghdad Aristotelians: the \u201cHumanism\u201d of the Buyid Age\n\nTowards the middle of the 10th century, another set of translations\ninto Arabic was produced by the Nestorian Christian Abu Bishr Matta\nibn Yunus (d. 940) (Endress 1991a, Martini Bonadeo 2011a) and his\npupils. Abu Bishr Matta received his Aristotelian education at the\nmonastery of Mar Mari and came to Baghdad, where in the first decades\nof the 10th century he had al-Farabi, a Muslim, and Yahya ibn\n\u02bfAdi, a Jacobite Christian, among his\n pupils.[91]\n He did not know Greek and his translations were made on the basis of\nthe Syriac translations already\n extant.[92]\n\n\nPlato. Another translation of the Laws is\nattributed to Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi by the ancient\n sources.[93]\n\n\nAristotle. Abu Bishr Matta translated into Arabic the\nSyriac version of the Posterior Analytics made by Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn[94]\n and the Syriac translation of the\n Poetics.[95]\n Even though he did not know Greek, the ancient sources mention also a\ntranslation by him into Syriac (hence, from Greek) of the\nSophistici\n Elenchi.[96]\n The sources mention also a partial translation of the De\nCaelo by\n him,[97]\n as well as a translation of the De Generatione et\n corruptione.[98]\n Abu Bishr Matta also translated the De Sensu et\n sensato[99]\n and Book Lambda of the Metaphysics, together with\nAlexander of Aphrodisias\u2019\n commentary.[100]\n To his pupil Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi\u2014who was also a Christian\ntheologian and the author of philosophical\n treatises[101]\u2014is\n attributed the Arabic version of the Syriac translation of the\nTopics made in the previous century by Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn.[102]\n Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi is credited also with the Arabic translation of\nthe Sophistici Elenchi from the Syriac version of Theophilus\nof\n Edessa,[103]\n as well as with that of the\n Poetics.[104]\n One of the Christian pupils of Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi, Abu \u02bfAli ibn\nal-Samh, was the \u201ceditor\u201d of the ancient translation of\nthe Rhetoric: it is this text which has come down to\n us.[105]\n Abu \u02bfAli ibn Zur\u02bfa, another Christian of this milieu, might\nhave translated an Alexandrian compendium of the Nicomachean\nEthics known as Ikhtisar al-Iskandaraniyyin (Summa\nAlexandrinorum) (Dunlop 1982; Zonta 2003, 197). The 10th century\nBaghdad Aristotelian Abu l-Faraj ibn\n al-Tayyib[106]\n translated the pseudo-Aristotelian De Virtutibus et vitiis\nand Divisiones (ed. Kellermann-Rost 1965; see also Ferrari\n2006, 30), and might be also the translator of the pseudo-Aristotelian\nEconomics (Zonta 2003, 549).\n\nTheophrastus. Ibn al-Nadim, whose information about\nYahya ibn \u02bfAdi is first hand, maintains that the latter\ntranslated Theophrastus\u2019 Metaphysics; however, in light\nof Ishaq\u2019s authorship mentioned above, this claim has been\ninterpreted as a revision of or an editorial work on Ishaq\u2019s\n translation.[107]\n\n\nNicolaus of Damascus. Abu \u02bfAli ibn Zur\u02bfa, a\nChristian philosopher of the circle of Yahya ibn \u02bfAdi, translated\ninto Arabic (in all likelihood from the Syriac version made in the\nprevious century by Hunayn ibn\n Ishaq[108])\n the Compendium of Aristotle\u2019s\n Philosophy.[109]\n The same Abu \u02bfAli ibn Zur\u02bfa began to translate\nNicolaus\u2019 compendium of the De\n Animalibus.[110]\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries. Abu Bishr\nMatta translated Alexander\u2019s commentary on the De\nGeneratione et corruptione, lost in Greek but partially preserved\nin\n Arabic,[111]\n as well as the commentary on the\n Meteorologica.[112]\n He also made a partial translation of the commentary on the De\n Caelo.[113]\n (ii) Personal works. Abu Bishr Matta translated Alexander\u2019s\ntreatise On\n Providence[114]\n (which was also known to the circle of al-Kindi [Fazzo-Wiesner\n1993]).\n\nThemistius. Themistius\u2019 paraphrasis of the\n Physics[115]\n was known in the circle of Abu Bishr Matta (Endress 1977, 35) and\nsome notes which trace back to it are reproduced in the Leiden\nmanuscript mentioned above, which contains the text of the\nPhysics as it was studied in the Baghdad\n school.[116]\n In this milieu his paraphrasis of the De Caelo, lost in\nGreek, was also translated (by Abu Bishr Matta) and revised (by Yahya\nibn\n \u02bfAdi).[117]\n Abu Bishr Matta translated from Syriac into Arabic three other works:\nthe paraphrasis of the Posterior Analytics, that of Book\nLambda of the Metaphysics, and a writing connected\nwith the\n Topics.[118]\n\nProclus. Two works by him were known to Yahya ibn\n\u02bfAdi: the De Decem dubitationibus circa providentiam\n(Endress 1973, 30 and Endress 2012, 1668\u20139) and the\nElementatio Physica (Endress 1973, 27\u201328 and Endress\n2012, 1661).\n\nSimplicius. The commentary on the Categories\nis mentioned in the bio-bibliographical\n sources[119]\n and was known to Ibn Suwar, the \u201ceditor\u201d of the so-called\n\u201cOrganon of Baghdad\u201d (see Hugonnard-Roche 1993).\n\nOlympiodorus. Abu Bishr Matta translated into Arabic\nhis commentary on the Meteorologica, in all likelihood from\nthe Syriac version made by Hunayn ibn\n Ishaq.[120]\n The commentary on the De Gen. corr., translated also by\nUstath at the beginning of the translation movement, was translated by\nAbu Bishr Matta and revised by Yahya ibn\n \u02bfAdi.[121]\n A commentary of his on the De Anima, unknown in Greek, is\nalso mentioned as extant in\n Syriac.[122]\n Finally, an otherwise unknown \u201cAllinus\u201d who wrote a\ncommentary on the\n Categories[123]\n might be Elias, the pupil of Olympiodorus; however, other names have\nbeen advanced; a \u201cbook by Allinus\u201d was translated by Ibn\nSuwar (Elamrani Jamal 1989, 151\u20132; Martini Bonadeo 2011c).\n\nTypical of this period was the detailed exegesis of Aristotle\u2019s\nipsissima verba made possible by the translations into Arabic\nof the old versions (often Syriac), as well as of the commentaries.\nFar away from Baghdad, Avicenna will argue time and again against the\ninterpretations of Aristotle advanced within the context of the\nBaghdad school of philosophy (Pines 1952; Gutas 2000). Nevertheless,\nhe will continue to rely on the corpus of the Greek sources made\navailable in the previous centuries, not only in the trivial sense of\nthe access they provided to the Greek thought for an Arabic\nreadership, but also in the less evident sense of the philosophical\nagenda set by the thinkers who assimilated the Greek heritage.\nTogether with the meticulous exegesis of the text of Aristotle, the\nideal of carrying on the search for the lore and science of the\nAncients, taken as a whole, is a prominent feature of the\nphilosophical circles of this era, apparent both in the production of\ncollections like the Siwan al-hikma (The Repository of\n Wisdom)[124]\n and in the ideal of the attainment of happiness through\nphilosophy.\n\nThe overriding objective of the Islamic humanists was to revive the\nancient philosophic legacy as formative of mind and character.\n(\u2026) The philosophers considered the ultimate aim of man to be\nhappiness (eudaimonia/sa\u02bfada). Happiness, they\nthought, is achieved through the perfection of virtue, preeminently by\nthe exercise of reason. Attainment of this happiness, or perfection,\nwas said to be something divine, as Aristotle had stated in the\nNicomachean Ethics. They depicted this attainment in noetic\nterms, as the conjoining of man\u2019s (particular) intellect with\nthe divine (universal) intellect. The end of man was conceived as\nbeing his self-realization as a god-like being\u2014we may say his\n\u2018deification\u2019. By rising above the perturbations of sense\nand the disquiet of the emotions to the serene realm of the intellect\nand the divine, the philosophical man escapes worldly anxiety\n(qalaq) and reaches tranquillity (sakina). (Kraemer\n1992, 6 and 19)\n\n\nThe attitude to the search for happiness in the intellectual life (see\nEndress 2014) and the endeavour to rely on the heritage of the\nAncients as a guidance in search of the \u201cscience of the things\nin their truth (\u02bfilm al-ashya\u02bfi\nbi-haqa\u2019iqiha)\u201d and personal achievement bridges the\ngap between the beginnings of falsafa in the age of al-Kindi\nand the developments of the Muslim West, when Averroes would conceive\nhis project of commenting upon the Aristotelian corpus (Endress 1998;\n2004).\n",
