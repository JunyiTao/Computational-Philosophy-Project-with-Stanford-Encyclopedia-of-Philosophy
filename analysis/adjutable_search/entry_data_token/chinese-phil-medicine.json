Introduction: Shared Intellectual Contexts\n\n\nBefore addressing connections between Chinese philosophy and Chinese\nmedicine it is necessary to make two clarifications on the meaning of\nthe term Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine could in principle\nrefer to: (1) the full range of medical systems used in contemporary\nChina, including Western biomedicine; (2) the traditional indigenous\nChinese medicine that is conventionally referred to as Traditional\nChinese Medicine (TCM); and (3) other indigenous medical systems,\ndistinct from but TCM, practiced by non-Chinese or minorities who live\nin areas that historically were part of China or are now part of the\nPeoples Republic of China, for example, Korean and Tibetan\nmedicine. For purposes of this essay I use the term Chinese\nmedicine only to refer to TCM, but including issues of the integration\nof TCM and Western medicine. Second, Chinese medicine, in the\nsense of TCM just discussed, includes a wider range of practices than\ndoes Western medicine. In particular it includes: (1)\n\u201cmedicine\u201d in its conventional sense of practices that cure\nor prevent disease, treat disease and injury and assist in childbirth,\netc.; (2) a range of practice to prevent disease in the broadest sense\nby maintaining health, including practices associated with the martial\narts such as Taijiquan (also known as T\u2019ai chi); and (3) a range of\npractices that extend health by seeking longevity. In particular,\na clear account of Chinese medicine cannot confine itself to the first\nof these only.\n\n\nWithin a Chinese historical context, medicine (yi \u91ab)\nwas one of several qualitative sciences. It included\n\u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang sheng \u990a\u751f), a\nbroad category that comprised a wide range of self-cultivation\ntechniques. In later periods, medicine also included materia\nmedica (bencao \u672c\u8349) and internal (nei\ndan \u5167\u4e39) and external (wai dan\n\u5916\u4e39) alchemy. The early Chinese qualitative and\nquantitative sciences were specific, with no unified notion of science\n(Sivin 1982 and 1990).\n\n\nSecondly, medical works, like other scientific works, were classified\nas technical specialties, distinct from generalist works, including\nthe \u201cMasters\u201d texts associated with Chinese philosophy\n(Raphals 2008\u20132009, forthcoming). Medicine and its related disciplines\nappear in the last section of the Bibliographic Treatise (chapter 30)\nof the Standard History of the Han Dynasty (Han shu). This\nTreatise consists of six sections. The first two (\u201cSix\nClassics\u201d and \u201cMasters\u201d) contain philosophical\nworks. The last two are technical: \u201cNumbers and\nTechniques\u201d (Shu shu \u6578\u8853), and\n\u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang ji \u65b9\u6280).\nThe latter includes works on medicine and longevity, including the\ncategories of medical classics (yi jing \u91ab\u7d93),\nclassical recipes (jing fang \u7d93\u65b9), sexual arts\n(fang zhong \u623f\u4e2d, also referred to as \u201carts\nof the bedchamber\u201d), and immortality practices (shen\nxian \u795e\u4ed9). These chapters reflect the concerns and\nexpertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated\nwith the \u201cRecipe Masters\u201d (fang shi\n\u65b9\u58eb) associated with the Han court. But their concerns\nalso appear in early philosophical texts to such an extent that any\nseparation of their philosophical from their religious and technical\ncontent is arbitrary and artificial (Harper 1998 and 1999; Kalinowski\n2004).\n\n\nNonetheless, Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine shared important\nintellectual contexts in their early development. The origins of\nscience in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas from both\nphilosophers and technical specialists, including physicians.\nAccording to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese sciences were\nestablished some time between the first century BCE and the first\ncentury CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru\n(\u201cConfucian\u201d) ideas and ideas from technical specialists,\nespecially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing)\n\u4e94\u884c, henceforward wuxing and technical expertise\ntraditions associated with \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d\n(Shu shu) and \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang\nji, mentioned above).\n\n\nKey to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but\ndeployed in very different ways. Early medical \u2013 and\ncosmological \u2013 thinking depicts a cosmos ultimately composed of\nqi \u6c23 (the energy that constitutes and organizes matter\nand causes growth and change) in processes of constant change, based on\nthe interactions of yin and yang \u9670\u967d and\nthe \u201cFive Agents\u201d or \u201cFive Powers\u201d\n(wuxing. \nSee Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013).\n\n\nPhilosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of\nthe Book of Changes or Yi jing, (2) theories of\ncorrelative correspondence between heaven, earth and humanity as a\nshared representation of cosmic order, and (3) the idea of a\n\u201cclassic\u201d or \u201ccanon\u201d as the founding text of a\ntextual lineage. The authors of the first medical classic, the\nYellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di\nneijing), also deployed these concepts, in particular in models of\nthe human body as a yin-yang and Five Agent microcosm of the\ncosmos.\n\n\nFinally, physicians and philosophers created textual lineages and\naccounts of textual authority. The most important medical works\nof this kind are the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal\nMedicine  and the Materia Medica of Shen\nNong (Shen Nong bencao), ascribed to the \u201cDivine\nHusbandmen\u201d Shen Nong, who, according to legend, tested hundred\nof herbs and plants to ascertain their curative properties. By\ncontrast, the evidence of recently excavated texts indicates that the\nHuang Di neijing derived from prior textual traditions that\nwere subsequently lost (Harper 1998) and that the extant version is a\ncomposite of several earlier texts (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003,\nUnschuld and Tessenow 2011, Yamada 1979).\n1.1 Yin-yang, Qi and Wuxing\n\n\nTheories of qi and yin and yang also are\nimportantly pursued in early philosophical works. Several Warring\nStates texts contain references to the nature of qi,\nyin and yang, and their relation to health and\nlongevity. The Zhuangzi clearly identifies qi as the\nbasis of the physical constitution of the body: \u201cHuman birth is\ncaused by the gathering together of qi\u201d (22, 733,\nmisleadingly translated by Watson (2013, 180) as \u201cpurity\u201d).\nThe Zhuangzi also describes harmonizing or taking charge of\nthe six qi.\n\n\nThe qi of heaven is not in harmony, the qi of\nearth is tangled and snarled. The six qi are maladjusted, the\nfour seasons are disordered. Now I want to harmonize the essences\nof the six qi in order to nurture life (Zhuangzi 11, 386, emphasis\nadded, cf. Watson 2013, 80).\n\n\nSimilarly, the Springs and Autumns of Master L\u00fc\n(L\u00fcshi chunqiu) describes sages as making their numinous\nessences (jing shen \u7cbe\u795e) tranquil, and preserving\nand increasing their longevity (3.2, pp. 3b-4a, trans. Knoblock and\nRiegel 2000, 3/2.1, 99).\n\n\nIn all these texts a sage or numinous person achieves that status\nthrough both meta-physical and physical means. This is the focus of\nDaoist \u201cNurturing Life\u201d techniques (discussed in section\n2).\n\n\nWe find a different account of these concepts in technical\nworks. The apocryphal \u201cfounder\u201d of scientific thought\nin China was Zou Yan \u9112\u884d (305\u2013240 BCE), who is credited\nwith combining and systematizing yin-yang and wuxing\ntheory. No works attributed to him survive. Sima Qian\u2019s\nbiography in Shi ji 76 describes him as a member of the Jixia\n\u7a37\u4e0b Academy, originally from the state of Qi in present\nday Shandong (Needham 1956: 231\u201334). By contrast, the Han\nshu describes him as a Recipe Master (fang shi). \nThis is important because of the connection between fang shi\nand medicine.\n\nFang shi practiced medicine and divination and claimed to\npossess secret texts and formulae. They gained great influence during\nthe earlier part of the Han dynasty, though their influence waned by\nthe later Han. The fang shi used yin-yang and Five Agents cosmology.\nThey seem to have originated from the Shandong peninsula, and were\nparticularly associated with the mantic arts, including the use of the\nsexagenary cycle of stems and branches, the Yi jing, and\ndivination by stars, dreams, physiognomy, the winds, and by the use of\npitch pipes (Ngo 1976).\n1.2 Body, State and Cosmos\n\n\nIt is almost impossible to separate Chinese ideas of body, state,\ncosmos from concepts of \u201cnature,\u201d though, as Nathan Sivin\npoints out, there is no indigenous Chinese term for\n\u201cnature\u201d before the nineteenth century. Over the course of\nthe last three centuries BCE, Chinese understandings of the physical\nworld developed to reflect, and mirror, political consolidation (Sivin\n1995, 2007). These new ideas of cosmic order\u2014correspondence\nbetween microcosm (the body) and macrocosm (the cosmos)\u2014appeared\nin new representations of the body, the state, and the cosmos that were\nbased on systematic applications and correlations of the ideas of\nyin-yang and wuxing. They are prominent in Warring\nStates politico-philosophical writings such as the Springs and\nAutumns of Master L\u00fc (L\u00fc Shi chunqiu) of\nL\u00fc Buwei (291?-235 BCE) and the Luxuriant Dew of the Springs\nand Autumns (Chunqiu fanl\u00fc), attributed to Dong\nZhongshu (179\u2013104 BCE).\n\n\nTheories of qi, yin-yang and wuxing also\ninform medical works. New systematic medical theories based on\nthese ideas were systematized in a cosmological framework in the\nHuang Di neijing, a complex and multi-layered text, probably\ncompiled in the first century BCE (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003, Yamada\n1979). It presents a systematic cosmology that analogizes the\nbody, the state, and the cosmos in systems of \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d (Graham 1986b, Sivin 1995, Lloyd and Sivin 2002). It\ndescribes relations and analogies between the body (including the\nemotions), the state and the cosmos in terms of yin-yang and\nwuxing. For example, the Huang Di neijing describes\ncorrespondence between the articulations of the body and the cosmos,\nspecifically between heaven and earth and the upper and lower parts of\nthe body:\n\nHeaven is round, earth is square; people\u2019s heads are round,\ntheir feet are square and thereby correspond to them. Heaven has the\nsun and moon, people have two eyes; Earth has nine regions, people have\nnine orifices. Heaven has wind and rain, people have joy and anger;\nHeaven has thunder and lightning, people have the notes and sounds.\nHeaven has four seasons, people have four limbs. Heaven has five tones,\npeople have the five depots; Heaven has six pitches, people have six\npalaces. Heaven has winter and summer, people have cold and hot\n[ailments]. Heaven has ten days, people have the hands\u2019 ten\nfingers \u2026 Heaven has yin and yang; people have man and wife. The\nyear has 365 days; the body has 360 joints (Huang Di neijing ling\nshu 71.2, 446, cf. Wong Ming 1987, 336\u2013338 (French). There\nis no good English translation of this text.).\n\n\nTheories of yin-yang, qi and wuxing also inform\nWarring States and Han astrocalendrics, observational astronomy and the\nstudy of astronomical portents, and in the so-called \u201ccorrelative\ncosmologies\u201d of many Han dynasty texts.\n2. Nurturing Life (yang sheng)\n\n\nSeveral Warring States texts express the need to preserve\none\u2019s person, self, or essential nature:\n\n\nTherefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first, Treats\nit as extraneous and it is preserved. (Daode jing, chap.\n7)\n\n\nOne way to do this was to maintain health by nurturing life\n(yang sheng), an area of common ground for speculative\nthinkers and practitioners of traditional medical arts. The term\nyang sheng first appears in the Zhuangzi and\nthen throughout a range of second (BCE) century medical literature.\n\n\nThe third chapter of the Zhuangzi is titled \u201cThe Lord\nof Nurturing Life\u201d (Yang sheng zhu\n\u990a\u751f\u4e3b). In it, the expert butcher Pao Ding\ninstructs Duke Hui of Liang. Pao Ding describes the process of\nmastering his skill. His method is initially analytic; he begins by\nstudying oxen as wholes, next as parts, and finally with faculties\nbeyond ordinary vision. This discourse is presented as an instruction\nto the Lord Wenhui, who ends by saying that: \u201cPao Ding has taught\nme how to nurture life\u201d (yang sheng, Zhuangzi\n3, 124, cf. Watson 2013, 20).\n\n\nAnother passage in the Outer Chapters refers to some of these\nexercises. It contrasts \u201creal sages\u201d who follow the way of\nheaven and earth with (among others) practitioners of \u201cnurturing\nlife\u201d traditions who:\n\n\nblow out, breathe in, old out, new in, dormant like the bear,\nneck-stretched like the bird, their only care for longevity; these are\nthe practitioners of \u201cguide-and-pull\u201d [dao yin\n\u5c0e\u5f15] and \u201cnourishing the body\u201d [yang\nxing \u990a\u5f62] who desire the longevity of Pengzu\n(Zhuangzi 15, 535, cf. Watson 2013, 119).\n\n\nThe passage continues. Real sages:\n\n\ncultivate [their persons] without benevolence and righteousness,\ngovern without merit or fame, are at ease without needing rivers and\nseas, attain longevity without \u201cguiding and pulling,\u201d\nforget everything but lack for nothing, placid without limit, things of\nvalue follow upon them (ch. 15, 537, cf. Graham 1986a, 265;\nWatson 2013, 119).\n\n\nSince the whole point of the Zhuangzi passage is to oppose\n\u201cguiding and pulling\u201d and other longevity techniques to\ntrue sagehood, it does not dwell on their details. We can get a better\nidea of what he might have been talking about from other sources. Some\nof these ideas are elaborated in a chapter of the Guanzi\ntitled \u201cInner Cultivation\u201d (Nei ye), which\ndescribes the cultivation of qi, as well as vital essence\n(jing), and spirit (shen). It describes Dao as\nliterally pervading the body or the person of a sage:\n\n\nSo long as the wellspring is not exhausted, \nThe passages of the nine apertures will remain clear.\nThus it is possible to explore the limits of Heaven and Earth, and\ncover the four seas. (Guanzi 16.3a8\u20133b1; trans. Rickett\n1998, 48).\n\n\nThe Zhuangzi and other texts refer to the figure of the\nspirit person or shen ren \u795e\u4eba as someone who has\neffectively transformed the physical body and the qi that\nconstitutes it. The Zhuangzi describes spirit person of Guye,\nwho concentrates his spirit (shen), avoids the five grains,\nrides the clouds, and, through the concentration of his shen\nprotects others against sicknesses and epidemics and makes the harvest\nripen (Zhuangzi 1, 28; cf. Graham, 1986a, 46). This passage\nsuggests that a sage can have a nurturing effect on the world by acting\nat a distance, possibly as an unintended by-product of self-cultivation\npractices.\n\n\nOther passages in the Zhuangzi extol the abilities of\nspecialized craftsmen who possess highly technical skills. These\nstories liken mastery of the Way to mastery of a craft. They also\nemphasize the technical skills of commoners. Commoners, rather than\nrulers, are presented as sage-like figures. These technical experts\ninclude arrow makers, bell-stand carvers, boatmen, butchers, cicada\ncatchers, potters, sword makers, and wheelwrights (Raphals 2005). It is\ncurious that these passages never include physicians. \n\n\nIn the Han dynasty, \u201cnurturing life\u201d techniques became a\nmajor concern of the Recipe Masters (fang shi) of the Han\ncourt (Ngo 1976). Texts on nurturing life include methods for absorbing\nand circulating qi in the body\u2014for example, breathing and\nmeditation exercises, diet, drugs and sexual techniques.\n\n\nMedical and mantic texts excavated from tombs make it clear that a\nwide range of longevity techniques had been developed before the Han\ndynasty (Harper 1998, 33). Most important is a corpus of medical\nmanuscripts excavated from Mawangdui \u99ac\u738b\u5806\n(Changsha, Hubei), dated to 169 BCE. This tomb is best known for its\ntwo versions of the Daode jing, but it is meaningful to locate\nthose texts among other texts of a scientific provenance found in the\ntomb (Harper 1998 and 2000, Ma Jixing 1992, Zhou Yimou 1994, Zhou \nYimou and Xiao Zuotai 1987).\n\n\nSix of the medical manuscripts are concerned with nurturing life in\nvarious ways. \u201cHarmonizing Yin and Yang\u201d (He yin\nyang \u5408\u9670\u967d) and \u201cDiscussion of the\nRealized Way of All Under Heaven\u201d (Tianxia zhi dao tan\n\u5929\u4e0b\u81f3\u9053\u8ac7) are concerned with sexual\ncultivation. They refer to the movements and postures of animals as\nwhole-body metaphors for sexual techniques. An example is the\ndescription of ten postures in \u201cHarmonizing Yin and\nYang\u201d:\n\n\nThe ten postures: the first is \u201ctiger roving\u201d; the second\nis \u201ccicada clinging\u201d; the third is \u201cmeasuring\nworm\u201d; the fourth is \u201criver deer butting\u201d; the fifth\nis \u201clocust splayed\u201d; the sixth is \u201cgibbon\ngrabbing\u201d; the seventh is \u201ctoad\u201d; the eighth is\n\u201crabbit bolting\u201d; the ninth is \u201cdragonfly\u201d;\nthe tenth is \u201cfish gobbling.\u201d (Harper 1998,\n418)\n\n\nThese texts emphasize that sexual activity is a natural process, but\none that must be regulated. As the \u201cRealized Way of All Under\nHeaven\u201d puts it, people know by nature how to breathe and how to\neat, but everything else is a matter of learning and habit. \u201cWhat\nassists life is eating; what injures life is lust. Therefore the sage\nwhen conjoining male and female invariably possesses a model\u201d\n(Zhou and Xiao 1989, 431; Harper 1998, 432).\n\n\n\u201cRecipes for Nurturing Life\u201d (Yang sheng fang\n\u990a\u751f\u65b9) consists of eighty-seven recipes, including\nfood, drugs, and beverages, along with several sexual cultivation\nexercises. \u201cEliminating Grain and Eating Vapor\u201d (Que gu\nshi qi \u537b\u6996\u98df\u6c23) specifies diet and\nbreathing exercises to be performed in the morning and evening, and a\nseasonal regimen of breath cultivation through consuming six qi and\navoiding another five (Harper 1998, 25\u201330). Another text, the\n\u201cTen Questions\u201d (Shi wen \u5341\u554f) gives\nadvice on techniques for nurturing life (Harper 1998, 22\u201330), for\nexample:\n\n\nYao asked Shun: \u201cIn Under-heaven what is most\nvaluable?\u201d\n\nShun replied: \u201cLife is most valuable.\u201d\n\nYao said: \u201cHow can life be cultivated?\u201d Shun said:\n\u201cInvestigate yin and yang.\u201d (Zhou Yimou and Xiao Zuotao\n1989, 379; Harper 1998, 399)\n\n\n\nFinally, the \u201cDrawings of Guiding and Pulling\u201d\n(Daoyin tu \u5c0e\u5f15\u5716) is a series of forty-four\ndrawings of human figures performing exercises, some with captions.\nSome are described in another excavated text from tomb no. 247,\nZhangjiashan \u5f35\u5bb6\u5c71 (Jiangling, Hubei). The\n\u201cPulling Book\u201d (Yin shu \u5f15\u66f8) from\nZhangjiashan describes exercises that refer to or are named after\nanimals, including inchworms, snakes, mantises, wild ducks, owls,\ntigers, chickens, bears, frogs, deer, and dragons. Both exemplify a\ntradition of exercise for both therapy and health known as\ndaoyin (pulling and guiding).\n\n\nThe \u201cyang sheng culture\u201d of these texts\nemphasized control over physiological and mental processes, both\nunderstood as self-cultivation, through the transformation of qi.\n\u201cSelf-cultivation\u201d in this context included moral\nexcellence, health, and longevity (V. Lo 2001).\n\n\nWe can get a broader notion of what these techniques were like if we\nturn to the list of titles from the \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d\nsection of the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise, mentioned\nabove. One of the few extant texts it lists is the Huang Di\nneijing, along with the titles of lost medical works on nurturing\nlife, health, and longevity. The \u201cClassical Recipes\u201d\n(jing fang) section includes titles such as \u201cRecipes for\nMarried Women and Infants\u201d (Furen ying er fang\n\u5a66\u4eba\u5b30\u5152\u65b9) and \u201cFood Prohibitions\nof Shen Nong and Huang Di\u201d (Shen Nong Huang Di shi jin\n\u795e\u8fb2\u9ec3\u5e1d\u98df\u7981). The sexual arts\nsection includes \u201cRecipes of Huang Di and the Three Sage-Kings\nfor Nurturing Yang\u201d (Huang Di san wang yang yang fang\n\u9ec3\u5e1d\u4e09\u738b\u990a\u967d\u65b9) and\n\u201cInner Chamber Recipes of the Three Schools for Having\nChildren\u201d (San jia nei ju you zi fang\n\u4e09\u5bb6\u5167\u623f\u6709\u5b50\u65b9). Other\nsections describe physical exercises and therapeutic techniques, such\nas the \u201cStepping and Pulling Book of Huang Di and Other Masters\u201d\n(Huang Di za zi bu yin\n\u9ec3\u5e1d\u96dc\u5b50\u6b65\u5f15 (Han shu 30,\n1778\u201379).\n\n\nAnother medical text from Mawangdui is a recipe (fang\n\u65b9) manual titled Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\n(Wushier bing fang \u4e94\u5341\u4e8c\u75c5\u65b9,\ntranslated and discussed in Harper 1998). Recipe texts also have been\nexcavated from Zhangjiashan (Li Ling 1993 and 2000). In addition, the\nMawangdui tombs also contained hexagram divination texts and charts and\ndiagrams on cloud divination and physiognomy, including the oldest\nknown representation of a comet (Li Ling 1993).\n\n\nIn summary, most of these texts can be described as part of a\nyang sheng culture, which offered and emphasized control over\nphysiological processes of the body and mind that were understood as\ntransformations of qi. What is the relation of these detailed\ntechnical texts to philosophy? These technical arts form a continuum\nwith philosophy because their transformations were understood as\nself-cultivation in the coterminous senses of moral excellence, health,\nand longevity (rather than medical pathology), and physiological\ntransformation through the manipulation of qi (V. Lo\n2001).\n\n\nMark Csikszentmihalyi (2004) describes them as part of an\n\u201cembodied virtue\u201d tradition of self-cultivation practices.\nThey structured much of early Daoist philosophy and medical theory, and\nalso had profound effects on early Chinese ethics and metaphysics (V.\nLo 2005). Such \u201cmaterial virtue\u201d traditions held that the\nbody-mind was constructed of qi and that embodied\nself-cultivation practices could transform qi. These views\ninformed Warring States accounts of dietary practices, exercise\nregimens, breath meditation, sexual cultivation techniques, and other\ntechnical traditions associated with fang shi. Material virtue\ntraditions also had important links with Daoist texts, southern\nschools, and the \u201cmoralization\u201d of health in traditions\nthat culminated in the Huang Di neijing. Accounts of these\npractices appear in passing in the texts of the received tradition.\nMany more come from texts excavated from tombs.\n3. Daoist Medical Traditions and Physicians\n3.1 Ge Hong\n\n\nGe Hong \u845b\u6d2a (283\u2013343 or 363 CE, a physician and Daoist\nfrom of the Eastern Jin (317\u2013420 CE), was the first of several\nexplicitly Daoist physicians to write about the practice of\nalchemy. He was the author of the Teachings of the Master Who\nEmbraces Simplicity (Baopuzi\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50). The Baopuzi consists of\nseventy chapters (pian \u7bc7): twenty \u201cInner\nChapters\u201d (Baopuzi neipian\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50\u5185\u7bc7) and fifty \u201cOuter\nChapters\u201d (Baopuzi waipian\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50\u5916\u7bc7). The two were\neffectively different books that were not combined under one title\nuntil a thousand years after Ge Hong\u2019s time (Sivin1969, 389. For\na partial translation of the waipian see Sailey 1978). Ge Hong\nwas also the author of the Collected Life Stories of Immortals\n(Shen xian zhuan \u795e\u4ed9\u50b3, trans. Campany\n2002) and Biographies of Recluses (Yin yi zhuan\n\u96b1\u9038\u50b3). \n\n\nAccording to his autobiography (Baopuzi waipian, ch. 50;\nSailey 1978, 242\u2013272; Ware (1966, 6\u201321), in his youth he studied the\nConfucian classics, but at the same time, became interested in\nquasi-medical techniques for nourishing the body with the goal of\nachieving immortality. He became a student of the alchemical\nmaster Zheng Yin \u912d\u96b1 (c.215-c.302 CE), and remained his\ndisciple for some fifteen years. After brief success, he abandoned a\nmilitary career to go to the capital at Luoyang to search for books on\nimmortals. After difficulties during the political unrest in the south,\nGe Hong entirely gave up political life and devoted himself to\nimmortality practices. In 316 he returned to the north and was\nnamed a marquis by the Eastern Jin court and took up an administrative\npost. On learning that cinnabar had been discovered in the south\n(in present day North Vietnam), he secured a position as magistrate in\nthe south in Guangxi, where he settled at Mt. Luofu\n\u7f85\u6d6e and began the study of alchemy, remaining there until\nhis death (Sailey 1978, 277\u201378; Ware 1981; Wells 2003).\n\n\nGe Hong was the first to systematically describe the history and\ntheory of Daoist immortality techniques such as \u201cpreserving\nunity\u201d (shou yi \u5b88\u4e00), circulating energy\n(xing qi \u884c\u6c23), \u201cguiding and pulling\u201d\n(dao yin), and sexual longevity techniques (fang\nzhong\u623f\u4e2d, Baopuzi neipian, ch. 2; Lai\nChi-tim 1998, 203-204). But his accounts of these techniques clearly\nreflect an interest in self-cultivation according to broadly Confucian\nprinciples. For example, he considered moral self-cultivation a\nprecondition for the search for immortality; self-cultivation included\nsuch Confucian virtues as benevolence (ren), trustworthiness\n(xin), loyalty (zhong) and filiality (xiao).\nGe Hong criticized Daoist \u201cpure conversation\u201d (qing\ntan) and emphasized the importance of both moral virtue and Daoist\nstudy. His specifically Daoist writings emphasize the importance\nof both \u201cmystery\u201d (xuan \u7384) and\nemptiness (xu \u865b), and all-embracing unity, which the\nDaoist must actively preserve by meditation practices, techniques of\n\u201cpreserving the essence\u201d (bao jing\n\u4fdd\u7cbe) and consuming medicinal herbs (fu yao\n\u670d\u85e5).\n\n\nAs an alchemist, Ge Hong experimented with drugs and minerals. The\n\u201cGold Elixir\u201d (Jin dan \u91d1\u4e39) and\n\u201cYellow and White\u201d (Huang bai \u9ec4\u767d)\nchapters of the Baopuzi neipian survey the\nhistory of alchemy and describe in detail a method for \u201calloying\ncinnabar,\u201d quoting from ancient recipes and \u201ccinnabar\nmethods.\u201d The \u201cImmortal Herbs\u201d (Xian yao\n\u4ed9\u85e5) chapter gives information on medical herbs (Gao 1996,\nQing 1994, Theobald 2013).\n\n\nAlthough Robinet (1997) insists that Ge Hong was only interested in\npharmacology as an adjunct to alchemy, the Baopuzi also\nincludes important material on medicine and pharmacology. Other\npharmacological treatises attributed to him are no longer extant:\nPrescriptions for Rescuing the Dying after the Pulse-taking\n(Zhou hou jiu zu Fang\n\u8098\u5f8c\u6551\u5352\u65b9), Prescriptions from the\nJade Box (\u7389\u51fd\u65b9 Yu han fang), Herbal\nRecipes from the Gold Cabinet (Jin gui yaofang\n\u91d1\u5331\u85e5\u65b9), and Prescriptions for Emergencies\nafter Taking the Pulses (Zhou hou bei ji fang\n\u8098\u540e\u5099\u6025\u65b9), which is said to be the\nfirst Chinese text to mention smallpox (tian hua bing\n\u5929\u82b1\u75c5). Thirteen texts attributed to Ge Hong are\npreserved in the Daoist Canon (Dao zang \u9053\u85cf), but\nmost are probably later works (Robinet 1997, 78\u2013113, Theobald\n2013).\n\n\nIn summary, Ge Hong\u2019s writings combine interests in Confucian\nethics, Daoist self-cultivation and alchemical techniques, and the\ndetails of medicine and pharmacology. \n3.2 Tao Hongjing\n\n\nTao Hongjing\u9676\u5f18\u666f (456\u2013536) was the effective\nfounder of Shangqing \u4e0a\u6e05 (Highest Clarity) Daoism. He held\nseveral court positions under the Liu Song and Qi dynasties. In\n492 he retired to Mount Mao (Maoshan \u8305\u5c71), where he became\ninterested in the so-called Shangqing revelations to Yang Xi a\ncentury before his time. He set himself to collect and edit\nthe original manuscripts connected with these revelations. The\nresult was the Declarations of the Perfected (Zhen\ngao \u771f\u8aa5). When the Liang dynasty came to power\nin 502, he joined the court of Emperor Wu (r. 502\u2013549), on whom he had\nconsiderable influence.\n\n\nTao was educated in Daoist traditions associated with the Daode\njing, Zhuangzi, and the works of Ge Hong; and was initiated in the\nLinbao school at the age of thirty. He was also actively engaged\nin mostly unsuccessful attempts to produce alchemical elixirs\n(Strickman 1979, 152). \n\n\nTao\u2019s father and grandfather were experts in medicinal drugs, and he\nshared their interests in materia medica and medicine. Shortly\nafter compiling the Zhen gao he wrote a major work of\npharmacology: the Collected Commentaries to the Canonical\nPharmacopoeia (Bencao jing jizhu\n\u672c\u8349\u7d93\u96c6\u6ce8), a commentary and re-edition\nof the Shen Nong bencao, a Han work of pharmacology attributed\nto Shen Nong, the legendary inventor of materia medica. Tao\ndoubled the account of 365 drugs in the original and also rearranged\nthe material (502\u2013557), (Predagio 2013, 968\u201371; Robinet 1993;\nStrickman 1979).\n\n\nTao Hongjing is thus another clear case of overlapping interests\nbetween philosophy and medicine. His interests clearly included\nDaoist philosophy and practice, medicine, pharmacology and alchemy.\n3.3 Sun Simiao\n\n\nSun Simiao \u5b6b\u601d\u9088 (581\u2013682) was the author\nof two major works on medical practice and a work on Daoist\nlongevity prescriptions. He has been worshiped as the\n\u201cMedicine Buddha,\u201d and as the \u201cKing of Medicine\u201d (yao\nwang). Sun is said to have taken up medicine to strengthen\nhis own health after childhood illnesses. He also treated\nrelatives and neighbors, and practiced medicine near the Tang capital\nof Chang\u2019an. He also traveled widely to learn new prescription recipes.\nAfter completing his first book, he lived in seclusion on Mt. Wubai\n(Wubai shan, later known, after him, as Yao wang Shan), where\nhe followed Daoist principles. He refused several official positions at\nthe Sui and Tang courts, preferring to treat ordinary people in the\ncountryside.\n\n\nHis biography (in both of the two Standard Histories of the Tang\nDynasty, trans. Sivin 1968, 81\u2013144) emphasizes his interests in\nphilosophy, noting his particular study of the Yi jing,\nDaode jing, works concerned with yin-yang theory, and shu\nshu numerical calculations. His work reflected these\ninterests in yin-yang and wuxing theory and\nmacrocosm-microcosm correspondences between the body and cosmos. \nHe is also the first Chinese physician to write extensively on medical\nethics.\n\n\nSun Simiao is the author of two major medical works.\nPrescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold (Qian jin fang\n\u5343\u91d1\u65b9, printed in 652 CE) was a comprehensive\ntreatise on the practice of medicine in thirty chapters. It contained\nherbal remedies and reviewed the history of medicine since the Han\nDynasty, starting with the Huang Di neijing.\n\n\nThe introduction to the Qianjin fang (ch. 1) describes the\ncharacteristics of a great physician and describes inappropriate\nconduct, especially the desire for wealth or reputation. \nAccording to Sun, a great physician should not pay attention to status,\nwealth or age; he should not care whether a person is attractive, a\nfriend or enemy, or whether the person is (Han) Chinese or educated. He\nshould meet everyone on equal grounds and should always act as if he\nwere thinking of a\nclose\nrelative\n(ch.1. For translation see Unschuld 1979, 29\u201333).\n\n\nThe Qian jin fang also includes chapters on diet (ch. 26),\nnurturing life (yang xing, ch. 27), pulse diagnosis (ch. 28),\nacumoxa (chs. 29\u201330, the combination of acupuncture and moxibustion),\nmassage, and exercise. His interests also included the treatment\nof women (ch. 2\u20134) and children (ch. 5). May chapters are concerned\nwith herbal recipes. Sun Simiao emphasized that the effectiveness\nof herbal recipes depended on correct identification and preparation,\nincluding gathering herbs at the right time and drying them\ncorrectly. His formulas came from both famous physicians of the\npast and his own contemporaries, including minorities and foreigners.\nHe also edited formulas to eliminate non-essential\ningredients. \n\n\nThe second book is a supplement to the first. The supplement\n(Qian jin yi fang \u5343\u91d1\u7ffc\u65b9,\nprinted in 682) records some thirty years of Sun\u2019s own experience with\nspecial attention to folk remedies. It adds some eight hundred\nrecipes, with details on collection and preparation for two\nhundred. Some are new herbs, including herbs from India. It also\nrefers to many mystical and magical practices, including exorcisms,\ntalismans, incantations and descriptions of acumoxa points effective\nagainst demons.\n\n\nSun was also the author of several works on Daoist alchemy, which he\nis believed to have practiced (he died at the age of 101). These\ninclude the Essential Instructions from the Scripture of the Elixirs of\nGreat Clarity (Taiqing Danjing Yaojue, ca. 640), an anthology\nof some thirty selected methods (Sivin 1968, 262\u2013264). His\n\u201cEssay on Preserving and Nourishing Life\u201d (Sheyang\nlun \u651d\u990a\u8ad6) gives monthly advice on food,\nsleeping habits and action of good and ill auspice (Predagio 2013,928).\n\n\nIn summary, Sun Simiao, like Ge Hong and Tao Honjing combines\nexplicit interests in Daoist philosophy, medicine, materia medica and\nalchemy. These physicians were informed by the yin-yang\ntheory and cosmology of the Yi jing and the philosophical\nconcepts of the Zhuangzi and Daode jing.  But,\ndespite their strong philosophical interests, the major contributions\nof their writings lie in the areas of medicine, pharmacology and\nalchemy.\n4. Zhang Xichun on Chinese Philosophy and Chinese Medicine\n\n\nThe views of the physician Zhang Xichun (1860\u20131933) provide an\nimportant testimony to the complex relations between Chinese medicine\nand Chinese philosophy. Zhang\u2019s life coincided with the\ntransition of China from the Qing dynasty to the modern era, a period\nin which major Chinese intellectuals were preoccupied by questions of\nthe relative merits of indigenous philosophical and scientific\ntraditions as compared to foreign knowledge, especially of science and\nmedicine.\n\n\nThe medical context for these debates was the differences between\nChinese and Western medicine, and the best role for traditional Chinese\nmedicine in modern times. Zhang was a major contributor to these\ndebates. Zhang Xichun was trained by his father in traditional\nmedicine from youth, but he was also educated in the classics of\nChinese philosophy. He became a leading proponent of the\n\u201cschool of converging and connecting\u201d Chinese and Western\nmedicine (hui tong xue pai\n\u532f\u8855\u5b78\u6d3e. For the life of Zhang Xichun\nsee Scheid 1995, 5\u20136).\n\n\nZhang\u2019s book contains an essay explicitly titled \u201cConcerning\nThe Relation of Philosophy and Medicine.\u201d It is so central\nto the topic of this essay that it is worth quoting at length. \nZhang begins by remarking that recent (Chinese) medical journals accuse\ntraditional Chinese philosophy of holding back the progress of\nmedicine. He responds: \u201ctheir authors do not understand the\nuse of philosophy, nor do they understand that philosophy is actually\nthe basis of medicine.\u201d He quotes a passage from the Book\nof Songs (Shi jing) says: \u201che is intelligent and wise, and\nprotects his own person\u201d (Shi jing, \u201cZheng\nmin\u201d \u70dd\u6c11, Mao 260). The passage refers to a\ncertain Zhong Shanfu \u4ef2\u5c71\u752b, a virtuous minister of\nKing Xuan of Zhou (r. 827\u2013782 BCE). The point is that\n\u201cprotecting one\u2019s person means not only protecting oneself from\nattach by thieves or robbers but also protecting one\u2019s person from\nbeing beset by disease and illness. But, Zhang continues, the\npoint of the quotation is that people must possess an inherent aptitude\nfor intelligence and wisdom. They must also make a systematic\nstudy of wisdom and virtue, and only then can we protect our\npersons. \n\n\nHe next identifies the combination of inherent aptitude and\nsystematic study behind \u201dbeing intelligent and wise and\nprotecting one\u2019s own person\u201c with what the recluse-hermits of\nantiquity called \u201dthe dao of nurturing life (yang sheng zhi\ndao \u990a\u751f\u4e4b\u9053). In his view, the\nnurturing life (yang sheng) practices of antiquity are what we\nnow call philosophy.\n\n\nHe goes on to argue that those who had the benevolent disposition of\na junzi and themselves understood nurturing life practices wanted to\nenable others to be able to nurture their own lives. \nHowever, for people who do not use understanding and wisdom to protect\ntheir persons, the way of nurturing life was not sufficient, and they\nthemselves could not help falling ill: \u201ctherefore they\npromulgated the principles of philosophy and originated the disciplines\nof medicine and pharmacology (materia medica) in order to offer\nassistance to those who themselves were unable to engage in nurturing\nlife practices.\u201d \n\n\nHe then goes on to identify specific physicians with this derivation\nof medicine from philosophy, including Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun\nSimiao. All these great physicians, he argues, were really\nphilosophers who wrote important philosophical works.\n\n\nHe then turns to the Huang Di neijing, which begins with a\nchapter titled \u201cDiscourse on the True [Qi Endowed by] Heaven in\nHigh Antiquity\u201d (Shang Gu Tian Zhen Lun). It says:\n\u201cIn highest antiquity there were true men (zhen ren) who\nupheld [the patterns of] heaven and earth and grasped yin and yang,\nexhaled and inhaled essence qi (jing qi), stood alone\nand guarded their spirit (shen), and their muscles and flesh\nwere like one, and thus they were able to achieve longevity in\ncorrespondence with heaven and earth\u201d (Huang Di neijing\n1, trans. after Unschuld 2011, 42).\n\n\nZhang argues that, according to the neijing, these realized\npersons were able to use these techniques to transform their\ntemperament and disposition and to achieved achieve an infinite life\nexpectancy. He thus identifies a clear link from the realized\npersons of high antiquity to the great schools of Chinese philosophy\nthrough the methods and theories attributed to the Yellow Emperor.\n\n\nHis point is that, although the neijing is an exposition of\nmedicine: \u201cit necessarily begins with philosophy and takes\nphilosophy as the study of how to safeguard one\u2019s person. People\nmust first be able themselves to protect their own persons; only then\ncan they represent to others how to protect their persons. Taking\nphilosophy as the way to protect one\u2019s person, it is by means of the\nprinciples of philosophy that we are able to preserve our bodies by\ntransforming our qi. Taking medicine is the way to\nprotect other people\u2019s bodies, it is by first completely\nunderstanding the transformation of qi in one\u2019s own person that [the\nphysician] is able to represent to others how to adjust the\ntransformation of qi in their own bodies.\u201d He concludes:\n\u201cfrom this we understand that philosophy is the true source of\nmedicine, or rather that medicine is the natural outcome of philosophy.\nThis is why the Neijing states explicitly that the study of medicine\nmust start from philosophy.\u201d How, he concludes, could\nphilosophy obstruct medicine? (Zhang Xichun 1918\u20131934, 296\u201398).\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nIn conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the\nconnections between Chinese philosophy and the development of Chinese\nmedicine. Philosophical texts clearly influenced medicine in\nseveral ways. First, both are grounded in theories of qi,\nyin-yang and wuxing and microcosm-macrocosm analogies\nbased on them. However, as in the case of science more generally,\nphilosophical textualists emerged as a distinct social group from the\nfang shi, especially. Nonetheless, we can trace\nphilosophical concerns in several areas of medical interest, especially\nthe ongoing history of \u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang\nsheng) practices, first described in philosophical texts but\nelaborated in great and practical detail by physicians and alchemists\nsuch as Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao. This linkage is\nmade explicit by one of the greatest of China\u2019s twentieth-century\nphysicians and medical reformers, Zhang Xichun, who unequivocally\ndescribes philosophy as the basis of medicine.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["<em>Baopuzi neipian jiao shi</em>\n \u62b1\u6a38\u5b50\u5185\u7bc7\u6821\u91cb (The\nInner Chapters of the Master Who Embraces Simplicity) , Wang Ming\n\u738b\u660e (ed.), Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1996.", "Campany, R., 2002, <em>To Live as Long as Heaven and Earth: A\nTranslation and Study of Ge Hong\u2019s Traditions of Divine\nTranscendents</em>, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California\nPress.", "Csikszentmihalyi, M., 2004, <em>Material Virtue Ethics and the Body in\nEarly China</em>, Leiden: Brill.", "Csikszentmihalyi, M., and M.
