    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes also called retro-causation. A common feature of our world\nseems to be that in all cases of causation, the cause and the effect\nare placed in time so that the cause precedes its effect temporally.\nOur normal understanding of causation assumes this feature to such a\ndegree that we intuitively have great difficulty imagining things\ndifferently. The notion of backward causation, however, stands for the\nidea that the temporal order of cause and effect is a mere contingent\nfeature and that there may be cases where the cause is causally prior\nto its effect but where the temporal order of the cause and effect is\nreversed with respect to normal causation, i.e., there may be cases\nwhere the effect temporally, but not causally, precedes its cause.\n\nThe idea of backward causation should not be confused with that of\ntime travel. These two notions are related to the extent that both\nagree that it is possible to causally affect the past. The difference,\nhowever, is that time travel involves a causal loop whereas backward\ncausation does not. Causal loops for their part can only occur in a\nuniverse in which one has closed time-like curves. In contrast,\nbackward causation may take place in a world where there are no such\nclosed time-like curves. In other words, an ordinary system \\(S\\)\ntaking part in time travel would preserve the temporal order of its\nproper time during its travel, it would keep the same time sense\nduring its entire flight (a watch measuring \\(S\\)\u2019s proper time\nwould keep moving clockwise); but if the same system \\(S\\) were to\nbecome involved in a process of backward causation, the order of its\nproper time would have to reverse in the sense that the time sense of\nthe system would become opposite of what it was before its\nback-in-time travel (the watch will start to move counter-clockwise).\nSo neither backward causation nor time travel logically entails each\nother and time travel is distinct from back-in-time travel.\n",
