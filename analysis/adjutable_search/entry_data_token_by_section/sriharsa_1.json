    "main_text": "Method || The Method of Definition\n1.1 The Method of Definition\n\nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s target is a theory of rational\ninquiry laid down in the Ny\u0101ya system. As defined by the\ncommentator of the Aphorisms on Inquiry\n(Ny\u0101yas\u016btra), V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (5th\ncentury CE), the term \u2018ny\u0101ya\u2019 stands just for\ncritical or rational inquiry. He tells us, \n\n\nNy\u0101ya is the examination of an object using methods of\nknowing, consisting in reasoning based on perceptual and scriptural\nevidence. It is inquiry, where inquiry is just the examination of that\nwhich has been presented by perception or scripture. (Thakur 1967: 3)\n\n\n\nThe opening sentence of the Aphorisms on Inquiry is a list of\nsixteen items that constitute the subject-matter of the Ny\u0101ya\nsystem.\n\n\nThe highest good is achieved through the knowledge of the nature\nof:\n\n methods of knowing and knowable entities;\n uncertainty, purpose, public examples, settled opinion,\nextrapolative demonstration, suppositional reasoning, final\nconclusion;\n truth-directed debate, victory-directed debate, destructive\ndebate, defective reasoning, tricks, checks, defeat situations\n(Ny\u0101yas\u016btra 1.1.1, Thakur 1967: 2).\n\n\n\nIn his commentary, V\u0101tsy\u0101yana explains this text as follows.\nEvery area of learning is concerned with a proprietary highest good,\nand makes available the kind of knowledge that is conducive to\nachieving that good; for instance, the science of the self\n(adhy\u0101tmavidy\u0101) is concerned with the goal of\nliberation, and helps us achieve liberation by leading us to the\nknowledge of the true nature of the self (Thakur 1967: 5). But in\norder to gain the knowledge that any area of learning has to offer,\none must inquire. A properly conducted episode of inquiry begins with\nan initial state of uncertainty regarding the nature of an object\npresumably in the domain of knowable entities, involves the\napplication of various methods of knowing (such as perception,\ninference, testimony, etc.), and terminates in a final conclusion,\nwhich constitutes knowledge of the relevant object's nature. The items\nlisted under (i) and (ii) are components of any such inquiry. When\ninquiry is conducted by several parties aloud in speech, it becomes a\ndebate. The items listed under (iii) describe different styles of\ndebate, and various strategies that one may employ in response to\none's opponent within the arena of debate.\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana helpfully delineates the philosophical method\nthat the Ny\u0101ya system, as laid out in the Aphorisms on\nInquiry, uses in treating its subject matter. It proceeds in\nthree steps (Thakur 1967: 181). The first step consists in\nenumeration (udde\u015ba), which involves mentioning\nthe various items to be treated in the theory, e.g., in the lists (i),\n(ii), and (iii) given above. The second step consists in definition\n(lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which involves laying down a\ndefining property, i.e., a property that distinguishes the\nnature of the definiendum (tattvavyavacchedaka-dharma)\n (Ibid.).[7]\n The third consists in examination\n(par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101), i.e., checking whether or not a\ncertain definition is adequate. The philosopher\u2019s project, on\nthis view, is therefore to define a kind K by articulating\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for being an\ninstance of K, where K may be a method of knowing, a\nkind of knowable entity, a component of rational inquiry, a style of\ndebate, or a dialectical strategy. This project was developed by the\ncommentators and sub-commentators of the Aphorisms on\nInquiry, and was ultimately absorbed into a larger syncretic\ntradition that combined the epistemological commitments of Ny\u0101ya\nwith the ontological scheme of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophy and\ntherefore came to be known as Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nThere are two distinct purposes that Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers ascribe to definitions.\n\n\n\nSpecifying the Definiendum. According to V\u0101caspati\nMi\u015bra (9th century CE), a definition \n\n\nspecifies the definiendum [i.e., the object to be defined] by\ndistinguishing it from things of similar and dissimilar kinds\n(sam\u0101n\u0101sam\u0101naj\u0101t\u012byebhyo vyavacchidya\nlak\u1e63ya\u1e43 vyavasth\u0101payati). (Thakur 1967: 186)\n\n\n\nSuppose\u2014following the early Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers\u2014we define earth as the kind of substance that has\nthe property of having smell. On the basis of this definition, we can\nmake the following inference: \n\n\nThe kind of substance under discussion is distinct from anything that\nisn\u2019t earth; for it has smell. And anything that isn\u2019t\nearth lacks smell, e.g., water. \n\n\nThus, we are able to distinguish earth from non-earth in this\nmanner.\n\n\nEstablishing the Use of the Definiendum Term. In his Row\nof Light-Beams (Kira\u1e47\u0101val\u012b), the later\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher Udayana (10th\ncentury CE) describes a different purpose that a definition may serve:\n\n\n\nalternatively, the purpose of a definition (or a defining property) is\nto establish the use [of the definiendum term, i.e., the\nexpression that picks out the definiendum] (vyavah\u0101rasiddhir\nv\u0101 lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-prayojanam). (Sarvabhouma 1911 [1989:\n194]) \n\n\nTo establish the use of the definiendum term is to specify the range\nof entities to which it is ordinarily applied. At least on one\ninterpretation of Udayana, a definition does this by specifying the\nreason for which the relevant expression is applied\n(prav\u1e5btti-nimitta), i.e., the application-conditions of\nthat expression (Bhattacharyya 1990: 98\u201399; Granoff 1978: n.\n74). Here, the application-conditions of an expression just consist in\na property possessed by all and only referents of that expression.\nTake the definition of earth as that which possesses\nearthhood: this specifies the application-conditions of the\nexpression \u2018earth\u2019 since people commonly apply the\nexpression to things that possess earthhood. Using the definition,\ntherefore, one can make an inference of the following sort, \n\n\nThe kind of substance under discussion is commonly called\n\u2018earth\u2019; for it possesses earthhood. Whatever isn\u2019t\ncommonly called \u2018earth\u2019 doesn\u2019t possess earthhood,\ne.g., wind. \n\n\nThis inference, in turn, specifies the extension of the term\n\u2018earth\u2019 as it is commonly used.\n\n\nBoth these uses of definitions are important for understanding\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s dialectical strategy in The\nSweets of Refutation.\n",
