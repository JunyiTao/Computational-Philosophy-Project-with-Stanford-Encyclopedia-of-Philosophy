    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || Some Criticisms of Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n3.9 Some Criticisms of Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n\n\nKaplan\u2019s theory of indexicals is influential, and so has been\nsubject to much critical scrutiny. A few criticisms will be described\nimmediately below. Others criticisms will emerge later in this\narticle.\n\n\nKaplan sometimes argues for his theory by appealing to intuitions\nabout what is said. For instance, Kaplan claims that if John\nutters \u2018I am hungry\u2019 and Mary utters \u2018I am\nhungry\u2019 then what they say is different, whereas if John\nutters \u2018I am hungry\u2019 and Mary utters \u2018You are\nhungry\u2019 while addressing John, then what they say is the\nsame. David Lewis (1980) says that Kaplan\u2019s appeals to judgments\nabout what is said are unpersuasive. Lewis also maintains that Kaplan\nfails to justify his claim that Kaplanian contents have a distinctive\nrole to play in semantics. Lewis (1980) claims that the primary task of\nsemantics is to describe how semantic values of sentences\ndetermine truth-values at contexts and circumstances of evaluation, the\nlatter of which Lewis calls \u2018indices\u2019. Lewis holds that\nthis can be done in (at least) two equally good ways. First, we can\n(like Kaplan) allow the semantic value of a sentence to vary from\ncontext to context, and design these varying semantic values so that\nthey determine truth-values with respect to indices. Second, we can\ninstead once-and-for-all assign to a sentence a single semantic value\nthat determines a truth-value given both a context and an index. On\nviews of this latter sort, semantic values are functions from pairs of\ncontexts and indices to truth-values. Lewis claims that there is no\ntheoretical reason to prefer one sort of theory over the other.\n\n\nKaplan\u2019s semantics entails that that propositions can vary in\ntruth-value from one time to another. He also assumes that propositions\nare the things that agents assert and believe. But he admits (1989a,\n503, n. 28) that the objects of assertion and belief are traditionally\nthought to be eternal, that is, not to vary in truth-value\nfrom time to time. Salmon (1989) argues that Kaplan\u2019s theory\nneeds to be amended so as to make contents eternal. Salmon argues that\nonce this amendment is made, it becomes evident that to deal adequately\nwith tense, a semantic theory needs both (a) content-like\nmeanings that vary in extension from time to time in the way that\nKaplan\u2019s contents do and (b) content-like meanings that are\neternal. Jeffrey King (2003) also criticizes Kaplan for allowing\ncontents (propositions) to be non-eternal. See Cappelen and Hawthorne\n(2009) for related discussion.\n\n\nBach (2005) says that the only indexicals that have contents with\nrespect to contexts are the pure indexicals, such as \u2018I\u2019\nand \u2018today\u2019. True demonstratives, such as\n\u2018she\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019, have no content in any\ncontext, and so the contents (in contexts) of sentences that contain\nthem are propositional radicals (incomplete structured\npropositions). However, a speaker who utters such a sentence typically\nasserts a full proposition that completes the propositional radical\nthat the sentence semantically expresses. (In this paragraph, and in\nmost of the rest of section 4, we use \u2018belief\u2019 for events\nor states of believing propositions, rather than for propositions that\nare believed. We also use \u2018desire\u2019,\n\u2018intention\u2019, and \u2018attitude\u2019 similarly.) \n\n\nBraun (1995) argues that the functions that Kaplan uses to represent\ncharacters in his formal logic (functions from structures and\ncontexts to contents) misrepresent the more interesting notion of\ncharacter described in the less formal parts of Kaplan\u2019s theory\n(where Kaplan seemingly uses functions from contexts to contents in the intended structure to\nrepresent characters). Richard (2003) and Braun (1994) argue that\nstructured characters, in addition to structured contents, are\nneeded to distinguish between the linguistic meanings of certain pairs\nof expressions.\n\n\nKaplan maintains that \u2018I am here now\u2019 is logically\nvalid, and yet he admits that the sentence \u2018I am not\nhere now\u2019 is commonly used for answering-machine messages (1989a,\n491, n. 12). For discussion of this \u201canswering-machine\npuzzle,\u201d see Predelli 1998a, 1998b; Corazza et al. 2002;\nRomdenh-Romluc 2002; and Cohen 2013.\n\n\nFor further criticisms of Kaplan\u2019s theory (other than those\nthat will emerge below), and for presentations of alternative theories,\nsee Burge 1974, Weinstein 1974, Roberts 2002, and Elbourne 2008.\n",
