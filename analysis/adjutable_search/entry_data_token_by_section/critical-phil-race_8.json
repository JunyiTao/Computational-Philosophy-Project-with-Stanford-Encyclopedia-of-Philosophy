    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || Race and the Self\n3.1 Race and the Self\n\nA central issue in the work of the Critical Philosophy of Race has\nbeen how socially instituted categories of race are related to the\nself. As Charles W. Mills has put it, the assignment of racial identity\n\u201cinfluences the socialization one receives, the life-world in\nwhich one moves, the experiences one has, the worldview one\ndevelops\u2014in short\u2026one\u2019s being and\nconsciousness.\u201d (1998, xv; emphasis in original) Given this,\nabstract notions of the self that pare away particularities of our\nidentities such as race risk producing theories and norms that tacitly\nassume whiteness, especially given the white predominance in the\nphilosophical profession.\n\nHow, then, should we understand the interaction between social\nidentities and the self? Is it deterministic from the top or more\ndialectical? In truth, the meanings of race have been influenced by\nthose victimized by racism who collectively organize for resistance and\nsurvival in racist regimes. Both individuals and social movements have\narticulated new ways to think about what it means to have a racial\nidentity (Marcano 2003; Gooding-Williams 1998; Omi and Winant 1986;\nTaylor 2004, 2016). Any theory of social construction, then, needs to\nunderstand this as a complex process with multiple players.\n",
