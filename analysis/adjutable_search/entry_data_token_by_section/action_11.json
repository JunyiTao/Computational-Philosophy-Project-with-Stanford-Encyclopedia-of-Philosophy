    "main_text": "Practical Knowledge || Weakening the knowledge condition\n4.4 Weakening the knowledge condition\n\nThe knowledge condition remains a controversial thesis in philosophy\nof action; but even those who reject it tend to hold that the\nconnection between intentional action and knowledge is not accidental.\nThus, there is a growing literature that aims to capture an important\nconnection between knowledge and intentional action in weaker terms.\nThese views can be categorized according to the term for which they\nrecommend modification, whether (i) the practical state, (ii) the\nepistemic state, or (iii) the nature of the connection between them.\n(Naturally, since these are all compatible, some scholars recommend\nmore than one revision.)\n\nThough regarded as Anscombe\u2019s central opponent, Davidson himself\nrecommended a version of (i). According to him, although agents need\nnot know what they are doing under every description under which they\nact intentionally, they must know what they are doing under at\nleast one description under which the action is intentional\n(Davidson 1971, 51). The carbon copier, for instance, may not know\nthat he is making 10 carbon copies, but he would have to know that he\nis making carbon copies, or that he is moving his hands, etc.\nArguably, the idea that practical knowledge is restricted to knowledge\nof actions in progress is also a weakening of the thesis,\nsince Anscombe appears to include also knowledge of future actions\n(\u00a7\u00a751\u20132) and of completed actions such as the knowledge that\nI wrote my name on the board (\u00a748) or even of what is\nwritten (\u00a719). Indeed, it has been argued that\nimperfective and perfective knowledge are interdependent (Haase 2018).\nFinally, other weakenings include the view that agents must know what\nthey intend (Fleming 1964), what they are trying to do/that they are\ntrying (Searle 1985; cf. Grice 1971), or what basic actions they are\nperforming (Setiya 2008; 2009; 2012). Since Anscombe\u2019s thesis is\nstrictly stronger than these, it follows that they will avoid certain\nproblems that hers faces. However, it is not clear that such retreats\nhelp avoid the general problem, and restricting the thesis to more\nimmediate occurrences\u2014basic actions, intentions, or\nattempts\u2014risks losing on the aforementioned feature that makes\nAnscombe\u2019s view so interesting: the idea that we might bear the\nsame intimate epistemic connection to something external as we bear to\nparts of our mental lives (Pi\u00f1eros Glasscock 2020b).\n\nViews that fall under (ii) have been influentially defended by several\nauthors (Grice 1971; Harman 198;1997; Setiya 2007; 2008; 2009; 2012;\nVelleman 2001; Tenenbaum 2007; Ross 2009; Clark 2020). A popular\nversion of this view rejects a knowledge condition in favor of a\nbelief condition (Setiya 2007; Velleman 2001; Ross 2009; Clark 2020):\nif the agent \u03c6s intentionally [intends to \u03c6], she believes\nthat she is \u03c6-ing [believes that she will \u03c6]. Such a view is\narguably better supported by some of Anscombe\u2019s own arguments\n(such as the argument in terms of conversation dynamics above); and it\nseems to preserve a special place for actions as occurrences that are\npublic but to which our minds bear a special epistemic relation.\nHowever, it has been argued that such views also suffer from problems,\nand fail to avoid counterexamples with the same structure as\nDavidson\u2019s carbon copier, even though they are explanatorily\nweaker (Bratman 1991; Paul 2009a; 2009b; Levy 2018). Since authors\nlike Setiya see the avoidance of counterexamples as a central payoff\nof the weakenings, it is unclear whether they are worth the costs in\nexplanatory value.\n\nFinally, views that fall under (iii) aim to show that even if there\nisn\u2019t a relation of entailment between action and\npractical knowledge, there might yet be an interesting connection\nbetween them. For instance, some authors have argued that agents\nnormally or generally know what they are doing\n(Peacocke 2003; O\u2019Brien 2007; Gibbons 2010; Schwenkler 2015;\n2019; Pi\u00f1eros Glasscock 2020b); or that the kind of knowledge\nthat agents have of their intentional action has special properties,\nsuch as being first-personal knowledge (Dunn 1998; Moran 2001; 2004;\nO\u2019Brien 2007; Marcus 2012; Schwenkler 2019).\n",
