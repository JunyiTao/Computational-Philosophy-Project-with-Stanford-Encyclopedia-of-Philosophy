    "main_text": "Inadequate Descriptions || Neoliberalism as Libertarianism\n2.3 Neoliberalism as Libertarianism\n\nNeoliberals are much friendlier to the nation-state than libertarians.\nSecond, libertarians often argue for institutional structures directly\nfrom a moral theory and a theory of justice, an approach taken by\nRobert Nozick (1974). In contrast, neoliberals seldom appeal to\nfleshed out theories of justice, such as a theory of natural rights,\neven if they appeal to the language of justice at various point. To\nfocus on the case of natural rights theories of justice, Buchanan does\nnot believe in them. He begins his treatise on political philosophy,\nThe Limits of Liberty, with the insistence that there is no\nmorality beyond what we agree to (Buchanan 1975: 1). Hayek barely\ncomments on natural rights, and Friedman discusses them primarily\nrhetorically. This is not to say that neoliberals reject deontic\nconstraints on the use of state power. Hayek and Buchanan\u2019s\ncontractarianisms forbid pursuing liberty and prosperity in ways that\nall cannot agree to. Neoliberals instead focus on the\nconsequence-based arguments for liberalism without adopting\nconsequentialism. They simply rationalize liberalism in part based on\nthe claim that liberalism has good consequences.\n\nOne is on better ground arguing that neoliberalism is a twentieth\ncentury revival of classical liberal ideas in response to certain\nunique twentieth century challenges. Neoliberalism arose in the late\n1940s as a response to three twentieth century ideologies that\nadvocated large states: communism (as the most prominent form of\nsocialism), fascism, and social democracy. Neoliberals sought to\nconfine state power to a range of functions much more limited than\nthat undertaken by extensive states of these three varieties.\nHayek\u2019s work on informational systems was a response to\ncommunist central planning. Friedman\u2019s monetarism was a response\nto Keynesian macroeconomic policy. And Buchanan\u2019s public-choice\nresearch program was a response to the economics of general\nequilibrium and market failure economics.\n",
