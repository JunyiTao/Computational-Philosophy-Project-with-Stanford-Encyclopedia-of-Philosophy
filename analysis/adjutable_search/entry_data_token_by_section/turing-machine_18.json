    "main_text": "Impact of Turing Machines on Computer Science || Impact on Theoretical Computer Science\n5.1 Impact on Theoretical Computer Science\n\nToday, the Turing machine and its theory are part of the theoretical\nfoundations of computer science. It is a standard reference in\nresearch on foundational questions such as:\n\nWhat is an algorithm?\nWhat is a computation?\nWhat is a physical computation?\nWhat is an efficient computation?\netc.\n\n\nIt is also one of the main models for research into a broad range of\nsubdisciplines in theoretical computer science such as: variant and\nminimal models of computability, higher-order computability,\n computational complexity theory,\n algorithmic information theory, etc. This significance of the Turing\nmachine model for theoretical computer science has at least two\nhistorical roots.\n\nFirst of all, there is the continuation of the work in mathematical\nlogic from the 1920s and 1930s by people like Martin Davis\u2014who\nis a student of Post and Church\u2014and Kleene. Within that\ntradition, Turing\u2019s work was of course well-known and the Turing\nmachine was considered as the best model of computability given. Both\nDavis and Kleene published a book in the 1950s on these topics (Kleene\n1952; Davis 1958) which soon became standard references not just for\nearly computability theory but also for more theoretical reflections\nin the late 1950s and 1960s on computing.\n\nSecondly, one sees that in the 1950s there is a need for theoretical\nmodels to reflect on the new computing machines, their abilities and\nlimitations and this in a more systematic manner. It is in that\ncontext that the theoretical work already done was picked up. One\nimportant development is automata theory in which one can situate,\namongst others, the development of other machine models like the\nregister machine model or the Wang B machine model which are,\nultimately, rooted in Turing\u2019s and Post\u2019s machines; there\nare the minimal machine designs discussed in\n Section 5.2;\n and there is the use of Turing machines in the context of what would\nbecome the origins of formal language theory, viz the study of\ndifferent classes of machines with respect to the different\n\u201clanguages\u201d they can recognize and so also their\nlimitations and strengths. It are these more theoretical developments\nthat contributed to the establishment of\n computational complexity theory\n in the 1960s. Of course, besides Turing machines, other models also\nplayed and play an important role in these developments. Still, within\ntheoretical computer science it is mostly the Turing machine which\nremains the model, even today. Indeed, when in 1965 one of the\nfounding papers of computational complexity theory (Hartmanis &\nStearns 1965) is published, it is the multitape Turing machine which\nis introduced as the standard model for the computer.\n",
