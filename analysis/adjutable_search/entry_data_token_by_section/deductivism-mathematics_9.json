    "main_text": "Unaxiomatic Mathematics\n6. Unaxiomatic Mathematics\n\nA second objection to deductivism is that deductivism cannot account\nfor unaxiomatic\n mathematics.[13]\n This includes pre-axiomatic mathematics such as, say, \u201cOld\nBabylonian\u201d mathematics of the early second millennium BC, in\nwhich first principles are never stated explicitly (Robson 2008:\n 90).[14]\n But it also includes non-deductive mathematics; for example, we might\nwish to credit the eighteenth-century Swiss mathematician Euler with\nknowledge of results obtained through analogical reasoning, extensive\nverification of cases, and the like.\n\nIt seems right to attribute mathematical knowledge to Babylonian\nmathematicians who, among other things, were able to solve specific\nquadratic equations. Still, the challenge may not be that worrying.\nThat first principles were not explicit does not mean that they were\nnot implicit. Presumably, any mathematical principle that Babylonian\nmathematicians were willing to accept without argument should count as\na first principle or axiom. Independently of this point, deductivists\nshould also point out that unaxiomatic methods can yield knowledge if\nthey track what a proof would yield. Babylonian mathematicians used\nmethods that reliably produced solutions to specific quadratic\nequations, even if they could not formulate, still less solve, the\ngeneral quadratic equation. Euler\u2019s methods reliably tracked the\nexistence of proofs for his results; if they had not, he would not\nhave been right as often as he was. This deals with the vast majority\nof such cases. Moreover\u2014thinking about the residual\ncases\u2014there is some reason to think that non-deductive reasoning\ncan yield knowledge of mathematical truth even in the absence of proof\n(Paseau 2015).\n",
