Specialized Domains in Cell Biology\n\nWe have focused on core domains of cell biology, concerned with\nexplaining the basic activities of cells. There are, though, many\nspecialized fields concerned with cells. Some of these have become\nactive areas for philosophical inquiry in their own right. Here we\nmerely identify some of these and point readers to relevant work by\nphilosophers, including in several cases entries in the SEP. One such\ndomain is microbiology, concerned with single-cell organisms, whether\nprokaryotic (lacking a nucleus and other organelles) or eukaryotic.\nO\u2019Malley (2014) has identified distinctive features of\nmicroorganisms (e.g., lateral gene transfer) and explores how features\nof microorganismal life challenge major assumptions about living\norganisms that have resulted from focusing predominantly on\nmulti-cellular organisms. In other work (O\u2019Malley 2010), she has\nexamined from a philosophical perspective the competing hypotheses\nabout the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. Much of\ncell biology has focused on mature cells of specific types and has\nattended less to the processes by which cells in multi-cellular\norganisms differentiate from a common cell, known as a stem\ncell. Fagan (2013) has pioneered the philosophical examination of\nstem-cell research, including the advent of techniques to revert\nmature cells to stem cells. Cells are not only transformed in\ndevelopmental processes in multi-cell organisms, but also in diseases\nsuch as cancer in which cells not only proliferate in uncontrolled\nways but also defeat many normally operating cellular mechanisms that\nnormally prevent proliferation. Plutynski (2018) has identified many\nof the philosophical challenges arising in the efforts to explain\ncancer (see the entry on cancer). An important\ncapability of many multicell organisms is the ability to detect\npathogens, viruses, and other threats and defend against them. Such\nimmune responses require, among other things, the capacity to\ndistinguish cells that belong to the organism itself from others (see\nthe entry on\n philosophy of immunology).\n A fundamental issue that arises in many of these contexts as well as\ntopics raised above is whether and how one should conceptualize cells\nas individuals or agents (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n\nIn addition to approaching cells as objects of scientific study,\ncontemporary researchers often adopt an engineering approach to cells.\nOne context is in the domain of synthetic biology in which researchers\nengineer cells, sometimes for research ends but other times to\ngenerate products society finds useful (see the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n The recent development of gene editing tools such as CRISPR opens up\nboth epistemic and ethical issues (for the ethical issues, see the\nentry on\n neuroethics).\n One context in which attempts to synthesize cells has played a\ncentral role is in the attempt to understand the origins of life. Much\nof the research on origins of life involves the development of\nprotocells\u2014self-organized, spherical systems composed of lipids\n(Rasmussen et al. 2009). This has become a prominent topic of inquiry\nfor both theoretically minded biologists and philosophers of biology\n(see the entry on\n life;\n Bedau 2012; Moreno 2016; Dun\u00e9r, Malaterre, and Geppert\n2016).\n",
