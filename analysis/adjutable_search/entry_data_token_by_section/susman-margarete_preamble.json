    "main_text": "\n\nMargarete Susman stands out as a distinct voice among the first\ngeneration of German women in philosophy in the 20th century. In her\ncapacity as a philosopher, cultural critic, and essayist, she was a\nregular member of the circle of Georg Simmel, which included Martin\nBuber, Ernst Bloch, and Georg Lukacs, among others. Jewish thought and\nthe question of the status and role of women in modern society are the\ntwo central foci of Susman\u2019s critical interest. They guide her\nwork, which examines the challenges modernity poses to culture and\nsociety as it tracks the profound and radical upheavals that define\nthe times of Susman\u2019s life: the Wilhelmine Empire, World War I,\nthe social and political revolutions of Weimar Germany, the rise of\nthe Nazis to power, the Shoah, and the emergence of the new world\nduring the postwar period.\n\nHer pioneering essays on Franz Rosenzweig and Franz Kafka helped\nestablish Susman as a leading thinker of modern Jewish thought. Often\nher work assumes the form of studies of other thinkers or intellectual\nor social movements. These studies are not merely exegetical and\ninterpretative, however, but articulate Susman\u2019s own response to\nthe question of how to deal with the historical constellations of past\nphilosophical thought in the face of the unprecedented exigencies of\nthe present. In them, Susman stakes out a dialogical space for her own\ncritical concerns. She does so by maintaining a reflective receptivity\nwhose explorative openness opposes the tendency to closure informing\nthe style of academic, disciplinary discourse.\n\nAfter authoring two volumes of poetry (an additional early volume had\nappeared as a private edition), Susman went on to produce her first\nmonograph, Das Wesen der modernen deutschen Lyrik (The\nCharacter of Modern German Poetry, 1910), which introduced the\nconcept of the \u201clyrical I\u201d as the key feature in modern\npoetry. Her first philosophical book, Vom Sinn der Liebe\n(Of the Meaning of Love, 1912), is an engaging study of sex,\ngender, and love whose approach to difference and alterity continues\nto command attention. The publication of the book led to a lasting\nfriendship with Gustav Landauer, who wrote an enthusiastic review and\nwhose political ideas Susman shared.\n\nA sample of characteristic essays written over three decades, from the\nearly 1920s to the late 1940s, was published in Gestalten und\nKreise (Figures and Circles, 1954, hereafter GK). The\nessay collection conveys the themes Susman was principally preoccupied\nwith as well as her approach to essay writing. Susman\u2019s Das\nBuch Hiob und das Schicksal des j\u00fcdischen Volkes (The\nBook of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People, 1946) was one\nof the earliest attempts at responding to the catastrophic events of\nthe Shoah and the challenge they posed to the very meaning of being\nJewish after the genocidal annihilation of European Jewry. In this\nbook, Susman argues that, like the Book of Job had suggested, the\nquestion of meaning was ultimately not to be answered by any\nrationalization of human loss and suffering through the invocation of\na grander scheme but was instead to be approached by acknowledging the\nimpossibility of grasping the unfathomable and comprehending meaning\nas the continuous project of human existence whose temporality comes\ninto focus only from the viewpoint of a future yet to be realized.\n",
