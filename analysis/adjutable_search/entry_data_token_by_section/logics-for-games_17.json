    "main_text": "The Nature of Players\n3. The Nature of Players\n\nGame forms may be seen as spaces where players can operate. A game,\nhowever, is not fully determined by its game form alone. Rather, the\nplayers involved may import additional features relevant for game\nplay. Players can, for instance, be limited in their powers of\nobservation, either by aspects of the game structure or through\ncognitive limitations. The most striking added feature, however, is\nthat players have preferences. Agents not only observe the world or\nact in it. While these describe mere kinematics of a game, agents also\nevaluate current state and various possible futures. Being driven by\npreferences, it is such evaluations that are the moving force behind\nplayer\u2019s choices. Preference, hence, take a prominent\nexplanatory role for true game dynamics.\n\nThis section places its focus on the preferential and epistemic\ndimensions of players. Such factors are essential to notions of\nrationality where information, action, and preference are often\nentangled. In game theory, a harmony between these is often sought in\nnotions of equilibrium for strategy profiles.\n",
