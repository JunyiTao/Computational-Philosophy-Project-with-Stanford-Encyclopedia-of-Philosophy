    "main_text": "Critical Responses || Predicting Behavior\n5.3 Predicting Behavior\n\n\nSeveral meta-analyses have found that, according to standard\nconventions, the correlation between implicit measures and behavior is\nsmall to medium. Average correlations have ranged from approximately\n.14 to .37\n(Cameron et al. 2012; Greenwald et al. 2009; Oswald et al. 2013; Kurdi et al. 2019).\nThis variety is due\nto several factors, including the type of measures, type of attitudes\nmeasured (e.g., attitudes in general vs. intergroup attitudes in\nparticular), inclusion criteria for meta-analyses, and statistical\nmeta-analytic techniques. From these data, critics have concluded that\nimplicit measures are poor predictors of behavior. Oswald and\ncolleagues write, \u201cthe IAT provides little insight into who will\ndiscriminate against whom, and provides no more insight than explicit\nmeasures of bias\u201d (2013, 18). Focusing on implicit bias research\nmore broadly, Buckwalter suggests that a review of the evidence\n\u201ccasts doubt on the claim that implicit attitudes will be found\nto be significant causes of behavior\u201d (2018, 11).\n\n\nSeveral background questions must be considered in order to assess\nthese claims. Should implicit measures be expected to have small,\nmedium, or large unconditional (or \u201czero-order\u201d)\ncorrelations with behavior? Zero-order correlations are those that\nobtain between two variables when no additional variable has been\ncontrolled for. Since the 1970s, research on self-reported attitudes\nhas largely focused on when\u2014under what\nconditions\u2014attitudes predict behavior, not whether\nattitudes predict behavior just as such. For example, attitudes better\npredict behavior when there is clear correspondence between the\nattitude object and the behavior in question\n(Ajzen\n& Fishbein 1977). While generic attitudes\ntoward the environment do not predict recycling behavior very well, for\ninstance, specific attitudes toward recycling do\n(Oskamp\net al. 1991). In the 1970s and 1980s, a\nconsensus emerged that attitude-behavior relations depend in general on\nthe particular behavior being measured (e.g., political judgments vs.\nracial judgments), the conditions under which the behavior is performed\n(e.g., under time pressure or not), and the person who is performing\nthe behavior (e.g., personality;\nZanna\n&\nFazio 1982). A wealth of theoretical models of attitude-behavior\nrelations take these facts into account to make principled predictions\nabout when attitudes do and do not predict behavior (e.g.,\nFazio 1990).\nSimilar work is underway focusing on\nimplicit social cognition (for review see Gawronski & Hahn 2019 and\nBrownstein et al. ms).\n\n\nIn a related vein, it is also important to keep in mind that large\nzero-order correlations are rarely found in social science, let alone\nin attitude research. Large zero-order correlations should not be\nexpected to be found in implicit bias research, either\n(Gawronski, forthcoming).\nIndeed, the zero-order\ncorrelations between other familiar constructs and outcome measures is\ncomparable to what has been found in meta-analyses of implicit\nmeasures: beliefs and stereotypes about outgroups and behavior\n(r = .12;\nTalaska\net al. 2008); IQ\nand income (r = .2\u2013.3; Strenze 2007); SAT scores and freshman\ngrades in college (r = .24; Wolfe and Johnson 1995);\nparents\u2019 and their children\u2019s socioeconomic status\n(r = .2\u2013.3; Strenze 2007). The fact that no meta-analysis of\nimplicit measures has reported nonsignificant correlations close to\nzero or negative correlations with behavior further supports the\nconclusion that the relationship between implicit bias and behavior\nfalls within the \u201czone\u201d of the relationship between these\nmore familiar constructs and relevant kinds of behavior. Whether this\ncommon pattern of findings in social science\u2014of weak to moderate\nunconditional relations with behavior\u2014is succor for supporters of\nimplicit bias research or cause for concern about the social sciences\nin general is an important and open question (see, e.g., Greenwald et\nal. 2015; Oswald et al. 2015; Jost 2019;\nGawronski\n forthcoming).[22]\nBut note that\nthe consistent finding of meta-analyses of implicit measures\ndistinguishes this body of research from those that have been\nswept up in the social sciences\u2019 ongoing \u201creplication\ncrisis.\u201d That people, on average, display biases on implicit\nmeasures is one of the most stable and replicated findings in recent\npsychological\n science.[23]\nThe\ndebate described in this section pertains to interpreting the\nsignificance of this finding.\n",
