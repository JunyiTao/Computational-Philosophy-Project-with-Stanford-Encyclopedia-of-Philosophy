    "main_text": "\n\nIn philosophy, \u201cself-knowledge\u201d standardly refers to\nknowledge of one\u2019s own mental states\u2014that is, of what one\nis feeling or thinking, or what one believes or desires. At least\nsince Descartes, most philosophers have believed that self-knowledge\ndiffers markedly from our knowledge of the external world (where this\nincludes our knowledge of others\u2019 mental states). But there is\nlittle agreement about what precisely distinguishes self-knowledge\nfrom knowledge in other realms. Partly because of this disagreement,\nphilosophers have endorsed competing accounts of how we achieve\nself-knowledge and of its epistemic status. These accounts have\nimportant consequences for a broad range of issues in epistemology,\nthe philosophy of mind, and moral psychology.\n\nThis entry focuses on knowledge of one\u2019s own mental states. A\nseparate topic sometimes referred to as \u201cself-knowledge\u201d\nis knowledge about a persisting self. This topic is addressed in a\nsupplement:\n Knowledge of the Self.\n",
