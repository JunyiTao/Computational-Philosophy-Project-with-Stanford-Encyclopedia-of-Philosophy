    "main_text": "Special Relativity and Temporal Parts\n7. Special Relativity and Temporal Parts\n\nDidn\u2019t Einstein show that space and time are basically the same\nthing? It\u2019s true that Einstein\u2019s two theories of\nrelativity radically altered our scientific picture of space and time,\nalthough it is more controversial what consequences the theories have\nfor metaphysics. (See section 3 of the separate entry on\n being and becoming in modern physics\n for more detail on this issue.) It is the Special Theory of\nRelativity (STR) which has had most impact on the debate about\ntemporal parts: three quite different arguments have been proposed,\neach of which purports to show that STR lends support to the\nperdurantist claim that things have temporal parts.\n\nFor our purposes, the key feature of STR is its claim that, for many\npairs of events, there is no absolute fact of the matter as to which\nevent, if either, happened first, or whether both occurred at the same\ntime. The question of precedence has different answers according to\ndifferent frames of reference, and there are no grounds for selecting\nany single frame of reference as the one which gives the\n\u2018real\u2019 answer. This means that, for many events, there is\nno absolute fact of the matter as to whether they are occurring in the\npresent, in the past or in the future. (If they were occurring now,\nthey\u2019d be occurring simultaneously with your reading this\nsentence, but there\u2019s no absolute fact of the matter about this\nsimultaneity issue.)\n\nA first argument from STR to perdurantism goes as follows: STR shows\nspace to be much like time, objects extend in space by having spatial\nparts, so objects persist through time by having temporal parts.\u00a0\nBut this argument is weak: although STR does show space to be like\ntime in some respects, the theory does still differentiate between\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Even if it did not, we would need\nsome further reason to believe that persistence must be just like\nspatial extension.\n\nA second argument from STR to perdurantism proceeds via the debate\nabout time (see\n section 6).\n According to STR, for many events there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter as to whether those events are simultaneous with now.\nThat\u2019s to say, at any moment, there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter as to which events are present. This makes life difficult for\npresentists, who claim that only present events exist. If STR thereby\nrules out presentism, and if endurantism requires presentism in order\nto explain change (see\n section 3),\n then STR rules out endurantism: things have temporal parts. But not\nall endurantists agree that they must be presentists, and not all\npresentists agree that their view is undermined by STR.\n\nA third argument from STR to perdurantism does not rely on the claim\nthat STR is out-and-out incompatible with endurantism. Instead, the\nclaim is that STR highlights a phenomenon which can better be\nexplained by perdurantists than by endurantists. To understand the\nphenomenon, imagine a three-dimensional cylindrical chocolate cake\nwhich you want to cut up into two-dimensional pieces (you\u2019ve got\na lot of friends). If you cut only at right angles to the length of\nthe cake, then each piece will be circular. But if you cut at a\ndifferent angle, then each piece will be oval. The cylindrical shape\nof the cake explains the shapes of the various pieces produced by\ncutting at various angles.\n\nNow imagine a four-dimensional object, cut into three-dimensional\ntimeslices. In a non-relativistic world, there\u2019s only one way to\ndo this, because there\u2019s only one way to divide up events into\ngroups of simultaneous events: it\u2019s like cutting the cake at\nright-angles. But, by relativising simultaneity to reference frames,\nSTR gives us lots of different ways to cut the four-dimensional object\ninto three-dimensional slices, just as there are lots of different\nangles at which to cut the cake. The shape of the three-dimensional\nslices you get by cutting in different ways, from the perspective of\ndifferent reference frames, can all be explained by the shape of the\nfour-dimensional object you\u2019re cutting up.\n\nEndurantists don\u2019t think there is any four-dimensional object to\ndo this explaining job. There are only the three-dimensional slices,\nwhich are just the single, persisting three-dimensional object (each\nslice is that object, at a different time). STR tells us that the\npersisting thing has different three-dimensional shapes with respect\nto different reference frames. The different shapes in different\nreference frames are correlated, but according to the endurance\ntheorist there is no \u2018underlying\u2019 four-dimensional object\nto explain these correlations. Endurantists may respond by questioning\nthe need for explanation here.\n\nIn short, while the general ambience of modern physics may seem more\nfriendly to perdurance than to endurance theory, it is remarkably\ndifficult to devise any conclusive argument from physics to temporal\nparts.\n\nMore recent concerns have focused on how the various theories of\npersistence can be formulated within a relativistic framework: can we\nsustain a distinction between temporal and spatial parts, or should we\nthink in terms of spatiotemporal parts? \n\nSuggested Reading: Balashov (2011) is an advanced\noverview of these issues, Hawley (2009) is much more introductory, and\nGilmore (2008) is a very useful middle ground; Balashov (2008) is a\nmore technical paper which attempts precise definitions of the rival\ntheories of persistence against a relativistic backdrop. Broad (1927,\nchapter 2) is an early discussion of the links between perdurantism\nand STR; see also Quine (1960, p. 172); Rea (1998b, section 1.1)\nresponds. Mellor (1981) argues that STR is compatible with\nendurantism, while Mellor (1980) argues that the General Theory of\nRelativity is also compatible with endurantism, contrary to Nerlich\n(1979). Balashov (1999; 2000a) argues that perdurantism can better\nexplain relativistic phenomena. Balashov (2002) argues that STR\nfavours perdurantism over stage theory; Balashov (2000b) raises\nfurther problems for endurantism, while Gilmore (2002) responds,\nfollowed by Balashov (2005a); Gilmore (2006) develops a relativistic\nversion of endurance theory. Hales and Johnson (2003) weigh in against\nendurance theory; see also Hales and Johnson (2007), and Schmidt\n(2015). Further installments include Balashov (2009), Sattig (2006),\nMiller (2004), Harrington (2005), Gibson and Pooley (2006). See also\nHudson (2005) and Balashov (2010) for book-length treatments of this\nand related topics. McCall and Lowe (2003) argue for an STR-friendly\nnotion of the flow of time. Davidson (2013). Balashov (2014), and\nCalosi (2015) exchange arguments about four-dimensional shapes in\nrelativistic contexts. Pashby (2013) argues that quantum objects lack\ntemporal parts, see also Pashby (2016); Gomori and Szabo (2019)\ndiscuss the persistence of the electromagnetic field .\n",
