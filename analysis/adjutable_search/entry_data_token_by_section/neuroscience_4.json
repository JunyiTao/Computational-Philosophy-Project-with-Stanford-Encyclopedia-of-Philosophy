Locating Cognitive Functions: From Lesion Studies to Functional Neuroimaging\n\nOne of the first issues to arise in neurology, as far back as the\nnineteenth century, concerned the localization of specific cognitive\nfunctions to specific brain regions. Although the\n\u201clocalization\u201d approach had dubious origins in the\nphrenology of Gall and Spurzheim, and had been challenged strenuously\nby Flourens throughout the early nineteenth century, it re-emerged\nlate in the nineteenth century in the study of aphasia by Bouillaud,\nAuburtin, Broca, and Wernicke. These neurologists made careful studies\n(when possible) of linguistic deficits in their aphasic patients,\nfollowed by brain autopsies post\n mortem.[13]\n Broca\u2019s initial study of twenty-two patients in the\nmid-nineteenth century confirmed that damage to the left cortical\nhemisphere was predominant, and that damage to the second and third\nfrontal convolutions was necessary to produce speech production\ndeficits. Although the anatomical coordinates Broca postulated for the\n\u201cspeech production center\u201d do not correlate exactly with\ndamage producing production deficits, both this area of frontal cortex\nand speech production deficits still bear his name\n(\u201cBroca\u2019s area\u201d and \u201cBroca\u2019s\naphasia\u201d). Less than two decades later Carl Wernicke published\nevidence for a second language center. This area is anatomically\ndistinct from Broca\u2019s area, and damage to it produced a very\ndifferent set of aphasic symptoms. The cortical area that still bears\nhis name (\u201cWernicke\u2019s area\u201d) is located around the\nfirst and second convolutions in temporal cortex, and the aphasia that\nbears his name (\u201cWernicke\u2019s aphasia\u201d) involves\ndeficits in language comprehension. Wernicke\u2019s method, like\nBroca\u2019s, was based on lesion studies produced by natural trauma:\na careful evaluation of the behavioral deficits, followed by post\nmortem autopsies to find the sites of tissue damage and atrophy. More\nrecent and more careful lesion studies suggest more precise\nlocalization of specific linguistic functions, and remain a\ncornerstone to this day in aphasia research.\n\nLesion studies have also produced evidence for the localization of\nother cognitive functions: for example, sensory processing and certain\ntypes of learning and memory. However, localization arguments for\nthese other functions invariably include studies using animal models.\nWith an animal model, one can perform careful behavioral measures in\nhighly controlled settings, then ablate specific areas of neural\ntissue (or use a variety of other techniques to block or enhance\nactivity in these areas) and re-measure performance on the same\nbehavioral tests. Since we lack widely accepted animal models for\nhuman language production and comprehension, this additional evidence\nisn\u2019t available to the neurologist or neurolinguists. This\nlimitation makes the neurological study of language a paradigm case\nfor evaluating the logic of the lesion/deficit method of inferring\nfunctional localization. Barbara Von Eckardt (Von Eckardt Klein 1978)\nattempted to make explicit the steps of reasoning involved in this\ncommon and historically important method. Her analysis begins with\nRobert Cummins\u2019 well-known analysis of functional explanation,\nbut she extends it into a notion of structurally adequate\nfunctional analysis. These analyses break down a complex capacity C\ninto its constituent capacities c1,\nc2,\u2026, cn,\nwhere the constituent capacities are consistent with the underlying\nstructural details of the system. For example, human speech production\n(complex capacity C) results from formulating a speech intention, then\nselecting appropriate linguistic representations to capture the\ncontent of the speech intention, then formulating the motor commands\nto produce the appropriate sounds, then communicating these motor\ncommands to the appropriate motor pathways (all together, the\nconstituent capacitiesc1,\nc2,\u2026, cn). A\nfunctional-localization hypothesis has the form: brain structure S in\norganism (type) O has constituent capacity\nci, where ci\nis a function of some part of O. An example might be: Broca\u2019s\narea (S) in humans (O) formulates motor commands to produce the\nappropriate sounds (one of the constituent capacities\nci). Such hypotheses specify aspects of\nthe structural realization of a functional-component model. They are\npart of the theory of the neural realization of the functional\nmodel.\n\nArmed with these characterizations, Von Eckardt Klein argues that inference\nto a functional-localization hypothesis proceeds in two steps. First,\na functional deficit in a patient is hypothesized based on the\nabnormal behavior the patient exhibits. Second, localization of\nfunction in normal brains is inferred on the basis of the functional\ndeficit hypothesis plus the evidence about the site of brain damage.\nThe structurally-adequate functional analysis of the capacity connects\nthe pathological behavior to the hypothesized functional deficit. This\nconnection suggests four adequacy conditions on a functional deficit\nhypothesis. First, the pathological behavior P (e.g., the speech\ndeficits characteristic of Broca\u2019s aphasia) must result from\nfailing to exercise some complex capacity C (human speech production).\nSecond, there must be a structurally-adequate functional analysis of\nhow people exercise capacity C that involves some constituent capacity\nci (formulating motor commands to produce\nthe appropriate sounds). Third, the operation of the steps described\nby the structurally-adequate functional analysis minus the operation\nof the component performing ci\n(Broca\u2019s area) must result in pathological behavior P. Fourth,\nthere must not be a better available explanation for why the patient\ndoes P. Arguments to a functional deficit hypothesis on the basis of\npathological behavior is thus an instance of argument to the best\navailable explanation. When postulating a deficit in a normal\nfunctional component provides the best available explanation of the\npathological data, we are justified in drawing the inference.\n\nVon Eckardt Klein applies this analysis to a neurological case study\ninvolving a controversial reinterpretation of\n agnosia.[14]\n Her philosophical explication of this important neurological method\nreveals that most challenges to localization arguments either argue\nonly against the localization of a particular type of functional\ncapacity or against generalizing from localization of function in one\nindividual to all normal individuals. (She presents examples of each\nfrom the neurological literature.) Such challenges do not impugn the\nvalidity of standard arguments for functional localization from\ndeficits. It does not follow that such arguments are unproblematic.\nBut they face difficult factual and methodological problems, not\nlogical ones. Furthermore, the analysis of these arguments as\ninvolving a type of functional analysis and inference to the best\navailable explanation carries an important implication for the\nbiological study of cognitive function. Functional analyses require\nfunctional theories, and structurally adequate functional analyses\nrequire checks imposed by the lower level sciences investigating the\nunderlying physical mechanisms. Arguments to best available\nexplanation are often hampered by a lack of theoretical imagination:\nthe available alternative explanations are often severely limited. We\nmust seek theoretical inspiration from any level of investigation or\nexplanation. Hence making explicit the \u201clogic\u201d of this\ncommon and historically important form of neurological explanation\nreveals the necessity of joint participation from all scientific\nlevels, from cognitive psychology down to molecular neuroscience. Von\nEckardt Klein (1978) thus anticipated what came to be heralded as the\n\u201cco-evolutionary research methodology\u201d, which remains a\ncenterpiece of neurophilosophy to the present day (see\n section 6).\n\nOver the last three decades, new evidence for localizations of\ncognitive functions has come increasingly from a new source, the\ndevelopment and refinement of neuroimaging techniques. However, the\nlogical form of localization-of-function arguments appears not to have\nchanged from those employing lesion studies, as analyzed by Von\nEckardt Klein. Instead, these new neuroimaging technologies resolve some of\nthe methodological problems that plagued lesion studies. For example,\nresearchers do not need to wait until the patient dies, and in the\nmeantime probably acquires additional brain damage, to find the lesion\nsites. Two functional imaging techniques have been prominent in\nphilosophical discussions: positron emission tomography, or PET, and\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. Although these measure\ndifferent biological markers of functional activity, PET approved for\nhuman use now has spatial resolution down to the single mm range,\nwhile fMRI has resolution down to less than\n 1mm.[15]\n As these techniques increased spatial and temporal resolution of\nfunctional markers, and continued to be used with sophisticated\nbehavioral methodologies, arguments for localizing specific\npsychological functions to increasingly specific neural regions\ncontinued to grow. Stufflebeam and Bechtel provided an early and\nphilosophically useful discussion of PET. Bechtel and Richardson\n(1993) provided a general framework for \u201clocalization and\ndecomposition\u201d arguments, which anticipated in many ways the\ncoming \u201cnew mechanistic\u201d perspective in philosophy of\nscience and philosophy of neuroscience (see\n sections 7 and 8 below).\n Bechtel and Mundale (1999) further refined philosophical arguments\nfor localization of function specific to neuroscience.\n\nMore recent philosophical discussion of these functional imaging\ntechniques has tended to urge more caution resting localization claims\non their results. Roskies (2007), for example, points out the tendency\nto think of the evidential force of functional neuroimages (especially\nfMRI) on an analogy of that of photographs. Drawing on work in\naesthetics and the visual arts, Roskies argues that many of the\nfeatures that give photographs their evidential force are not present\nin functional neuroimages. So while neuroimages do serve as evidence\nfor claims about neurofunctions, and even for localization hypotheses,\ndetails of their proper interpretation are far more complicated than\nphilosophers sometimes assume. More critically, Klein (2010) argues\nthat images of \u201cbrain activity\u201d resulting from functional\nneuroimaging, especially fMRI are poor evidence for functional\nhypotheses. For these images present the results of null hypothesis\nsignificance testing on fMRI data, and such testing alone cannot\nprovide evidence about the functional structure of a causally dense\nsystem, which the human brain is. Instead, functional neuroimages are\nproperly interpreted as indicating regions where further data and\nanalysis are warranted. But these data will typically require more\nthan simple significance testing, so skepticism about the evidential\nforce of neuroimages does not warrant skepticism more generally about\nfMRI. \n\nLocalization of function remains to this day a central topic of\ndiscussion in philosophy of neuroscience. We will cover more recent\nwork in later sections.\n",
