    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nPhilosophers of science have traditionally recognized a special role\nfor observations in the epistemology of science. Observations are the\nconduit through which the \u2018tribunal of experience\u2019\ndelivers its verdicts on scientific hypotheses and theories. The\nevidential value of an observation has been assumed to depend on how\nsensitive it is to whatever it is used to study. But this in turn\ndepends on the adequacy of any theoretical claims its sensitivity may\ndepend on. For example, we can challenge the use of a particular\nthermometer reading to support a prediction of a patient\u2019s\ntemperature by challenging theoretical claims having to do with\nwhether a reading from a thermometer like this one, applied in the\nsame way under similar conditions, should indicate the patient\u2019s\ntemperature well enough to count in favor of or against the\nprediction. At least some of those theoretical claims will be such\nthat regardless of whether an investigator explicitly endorses, or is\neven aware of them, her use of the thermometer reading would be\nundermined by their falsity. All observations and uses of\nobservational evidence are theory laden in this sense (cf. Chang 2005,\nAzzouni 2004). As the example of the thermometer illustrates,\nanalogues of Norwood Hanson\u2019s claim that seeing is a theory\nladen undertaking apply just as well to equipment generated\nobservations (Hanson 1958, 19). But if all observations and empirical\ndata are theory laden, how can they provide reality-based, objective\nepistemic constraints on scientific reasoning?\n\nRecent scholarship has turned this question on its head. Why think\nthat theory ladenness of empirical results would be problematic in the\nfirst place? If the theoretical assumptions with which the results are\nimbued are correct, what is the harm of it? After all, it is in virtue\nof those assumptions that the fruits of empirical investigation can be\n\u2018put in touch\u2019 with theorizing at all. A number scribbled\nin a lab notebook can do a scientist little epistemic good unless she\ncan recruit the relevant background assumptions to even recognize it\nas a reading of the patient\u2019s temperature. But philosophers have\nembraced an entangled picture of the theoretical and empirical that\ngoes much deeper than this. Lloyd (2012) advocates for what she calls\n\u201ccomplex empiricism\u201d in which there is \u201cno pristine\nseparation of model and data\u201d (397). Bogen (2016) points out\nthat \u201cimpure empirical evidence\u201d (i.e. evidence that\nincorporates the judgements of scientists) \u201coften tells us more\nabout the world that it could have if it were pure\u201d (784).\nIndeed, Longino (2020) has urged that \u201c[t]he na\u00efve fantasy\nthat data have an immediate relation to phenomena of the world, that\nthey are \u2018objective\u2019 in some strong, ontological sense of\nthat term, that they are the facts of the world directly speaking to\nus, should be finally laid to rest\u201d and that \u201ceven the\nprimary, original, state of data is not free from researchers\u2019\nvalue- and theory-laden selection and organization\u201d (391).\n\nThere is not widespread agreement among philosophers of science about\nhow to characterize the nature of scientific theories. What is a\ntheory? According to the traditional syntactic view, theories are\nconsidered to be collections of sentences couched in logical language,\nwhich must then be supplemented with correspondence rules in order to\nbe interpreted. Construed in this way, theories include maximally\ngeneral explanatory and predictive laws (Coulomb\u2019s law of\nelectrical attraction and repulsion, and Maxwellian electromagnetism\nequations for example), along with lesser generalizations that\ndescribe more limited natural and experimental phenomena (e.g., the\nideal gas equations describing relations between temperatures and\npressures of enclosed gasses, and general descriptions of positional\nastronomical regularities). In contrast, the semantic view casts\ntheories as the space of states possible according to the theory, or\nthe set of mathematical models permissible according to the theory\n(see Suppe 1977). However, there are also significantly more\necumenical interpretations of what it means to be a scientific theory,\nwhich include elements of diverse kinds. To take just one illustrative\nexample, Borrelli (2012) characterizes the Standard Model of particle\nphysics as a theoretical framework involving what she calls\n\u201ctheoretical cores\u201d that are composed of mathematical\nstructures, verbal stories, and analogies with empirical references\nmixed together (196). This entry aims to accommodate all of these\nviews about the nature of scientific theories.\n\nIn this entry, we trace the contours of traditional philosophical\nengagement with questions surrounding theory and observation in\nscience that attempted to segregate the theoretical from the\nobservational, and to cleanly delineate between the observable and the\nunobservable. We also discuss the more recent scholarship that\nsupplants the primacy of observation by human sensory perception with\nan instrument-inclusive conception of data production and that\nembraces the intertwining of theoretical and empirical in the\nproduction of useful scientific results. Although theory testing\ndominates much of the standard philosophical literature on\nobservation, much of what this entry says about the role of\nobservation in theory testing applies also to its role in inventing,\nand modifying theories, and applying them to tasks in engineering,\nmedicine, and other practical enterprises.\n",
