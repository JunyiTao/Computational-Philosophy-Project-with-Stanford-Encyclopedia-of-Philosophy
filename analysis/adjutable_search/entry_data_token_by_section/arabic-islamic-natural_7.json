    "main_text": "Falsafa: Neoplatonized Aristotelianism in the Islamic World || Place and Void\n2.4 Place and Void\n\nAristotle in his Physics (IV 4, 212a2\u20136) had argued\nthat place is the first motionless limit of a containing body. His\naccount, however, came under heavy criticism from the late Greek\nNeoplatonic thinker John Philoponus. Philoponus asserted that place is\na (finite) three-dimensional extension that though never devoid of\nbody on its own, nonetheless, considered in itself is self-subsistent,\nand so in theory could exist independently of a body. One of the ways\nthat Philoponus defended this thesis was to argue that Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of place was inconsistent with other features of his\nphilosophical system. Aristotle seemed committed to the following\nthree claims: one, if something has a place, then given his definition\nof \u2018place\u2019 there must be something else beyond that thing\nthat contains it; two, once approximately every twenty-four hours the\noutermost celestial sphere makes a complete westward rotation; and\nthree, there are only three generic types of motion: motion with\nrespect to (1) place, (2) quantity and (3) quality. Given these\nbeliefs, Philoponus posed the following dilemma. Either the universe\nas a whole has a place or it does not. If it has a place, then\nAristotle\u2019s definition of place is wrong since there is nothing beyond\nthe universe itself that contains it. If the universe as a whole does\nnot have a place, then Philoponus asks, \u201cIn what respect does\nthe outermost celestial sphere move during the course of its diurnal\nmotion?\u201d Again the motion either could be (1) with respect to\nthe category of place (as when something undergoes locomotion), (2)\nwith respect to the category of quantity (as when something grows or\nshrinks) or (3) with respect to the category of quality (as when\nsomething changes color or temperature and the like). Clearly the\nuniverse\u2019s diurnal motion is not with respect to either of the\ncategories of quantity or quality, and thus it must be with respect to\nplace; however, in this horn of the dilemma it was assumed that the\nuniverse has no place, and so there is a contradiction. Although\nPhiloponus had other arguments for his belief that place is the space\noccupied by a body, this dilemma is the one that most exercised\nsubsequent Arabic-speaking natural philosophers.\n\nVirtually all Arabic-speaking philosophers adopted Aristotle\u2019s account\nof place as the limit of a containing body, and so the challenge was\nto explain whether the universe as a whole has a place and in what\nsense it can be said to move. There were two approaches to this issue:\none was to deny that the universe had a place and then explain in what\nsense it could be said to move, while the other was to assert that the\nuniverse has a place and then show how its having a place is\nconsistent with Aristotle\u2019s definition of place. Avicenna) represents\nthe first approach, whereas Ibn B\u0101jja and Averroes (and it would also\nseem al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b) took the second approach.\n\nSo for instance, Avicenna denied that the universe has a place, but he\nlikewise further denied that the list of the types of motion exploited\nby Philoponus in his dilemma is exhaustive: one must further add to\nthat list, maintained Avicenna, motion with respect to the category of\nposition (Avicenna 1983, II.3, 103\u2013105.13; McGinnis 2006b).\nAccording to Avicenna, then, all cases of rectilinear motion, that is,\nmotion from some spatial point x to a distinct spatial point\ny, are cases of motion with respect to the category of place,\nwhereas all cases of spinning or rotating, where the moving object\ndoes not depart from a given spatial location, are cases of motion\nwith respect to the category of position. Since the universe during\nits daily rotation does not depart from one spatial location to\nanother it does not need a place and yet it can still move albeit with\nrespect to the category of position, concluded Avicenna.\n\nA contrasting approach is that of Ibn B\u0101jja, who, we are told, followed\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b; this position would also be the one that Averroes in\ngeneral would adopt, albeit with certain reservations and\nmodifications (Lettinck 1984, 297\u2013302; Averroes 1962,\n141E\u2013144I). Ibn B\u0101jja begins by slightly modifying Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of place; instead of being the first containing\nlimit, place is now identified with \u2018the proximate\nsurrounding surface.\u2019 The shift in language is slight,\nbut it allows Ibn B\u0101jja the opportunity to distinguish between two\nsenses of \u2018surrounding surface.\u2019 Things can either be\nsurrounded by a concave or convex surface, maintained Ibn B\u0101jja. A\nRectilinear body, that is, a body that undergoes rectilinear motion,\nhas as its place a concave surface that is outside of it, whereas a\ntruly spherical body, that is, a body that undergoes circular motion\nor rotation, has as its place a convex surface, which is inside of the\nrotating body and is in fact the surface of the center around which\nthe body rotates. Since the universe rotates around the earth, at\nleast according to ancient and medieval cosmology, the universe is\n\u2018surrounded\u2019 by the earth at the earth\u2019s convex surface,\nand thus the universe as a whole has a place, namely, the surface of\nthe earth. Averroes\u2019 modifications make the surface of the earth only\nthe accidental place of the universe rather than the essential place,\nbut since Aristotle had spoken of the universe\u2019s having a place only\naccidentally, the Commentator was satisfied.\n\nNatural philosophers writing in Islamic lands did not necessarily\ndefend Aristotle\u2019s account of place against Philoponus\u2019 critique out\nof a slavish adherence to Aristotle, but because Philoponus\u2019\nalternative account of place entailed that there could be a void\nspace, and most Arabic-speaking philosophers thought that the\nexistence of the void was both physically impossible as well as\nconceptually incoherent. Aristotle himself had presented numerous\nphysical impossibilities associated with a void, whereas\nArabic-speaking philosophers explored the conceptually incoherent\naspect of the notion of a void in order to show that its existence is\nimpossible. For example, in On First Philosophy al-Kind\u012b\nobserved that the meaning of \u2018void\u2019 is a place in which\nnothing is placed; however, he continued, place and being something\nplaced are correlative terms neither of which proceeds the other, and\nso if there is a place, there must be something placed, and if there\nis something placed, there must be a place. Consequently there cannot\nbe a place without something placed in it. Again, however, a place\nwithout something placed in it is precisely what is meant by\n\u2018void.\u2019 Therefore, concluded al-Kind\u012b, it is impossible\nthat an absolute void exists (al-Kind\u012b 1950, 109).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b in a small treatise on the void took a similar approach, but\nnow from the direction of what is meant by \u2018body\u2019\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b 1951). He begins by considering an experiment that might\nlead one to conclude that a void exists. The experiment involves\nsucking air out of a vial and then placing one\u2019s finger on the mouth\nof the vial. One next inverts the vial into a bowl of water and then\nremoves the finger from the mouth of the vial. A certain amount of\nwater will be attracted into the vial, and so one might conclude that\na void space proportional to the amount of water drawn into the vial\nwas present while one\u2019s finger was over the mouth of the vial. The\nconclusion does not follow, argued al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b; for he believed that one\nmust concede that the purported void space in the vial has a certain\nvolume, but since volume just is a body possessing length, breadth and\ndepth, there must be a body in the purported void\n space.[8]\n In this respect al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b was simply following the standard\ndefinition of \u2018body\u2019 as whatever possesses three\ndimensions; however, he also suggested that there is something\nincoherent about considering void as some sort of absolute nothingness\npossessing three dimensions, since there is no coherent sense in which\nnothingness could be the subject for the accidental qualities of\nlength, breadth and\n depth.[9]\n Given these considerations against the void, continued al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, one\nshould conclude from the above experiment that the volume of air\nexpanded, and consequently a smaller amount of air now occupies the\nsame amount of space. In other words, the particular volume that a\nbody possesses, and particularly in the case or air, is not essential\nto that body, and so given the right causal factors or conditions a\nbody\u2019s volume can expand or decrease. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s suggestion here was\nto become the standard among Arabic-speaking natural philosophers when\ndealing with purportedly artificially manufactured voids.\n",
