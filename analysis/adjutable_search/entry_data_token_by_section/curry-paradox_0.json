    "main_text": "Introduction: Two Guises of the Paradox || An Informal Argument\n1.1 An Informal Argument\n\n\nSuppose that your friend tells you: \u201cIf what I\u2019m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then time is infinite\u201d. It\nturns out that there is a short and seemingly compelling argument for\nthe following conclusion:\n\n(P)\nThe mere\nexistence of your friend\u2019s assertion entails (or has as a\nconsequence) that time is infinite.\n\n\n\nMany hold that (P) is beyond belief (and, in that sense, paradoxical),\neven if time is indeed infinite. Or, if that isn\u2019t bad enough,\nconsider another version, this time involving a claim known to be\nfalse. Let your friend say instead: \u201cIf what I\u2019m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then all numbers are prime\u201d.\nNow, mutatis mutandis, the same short and seemingly\ncompelling argument yields (Q):\n\n(Q)\nThe mere\nexistence of your friend\u2019s assertion entails (or has as a\nconsequence) that all numbers are prime.\n\n\n\nHere is the argument for\n (P).\n Let \\(k\\) be the self-referential sentence your friend uttered,\nsimplified somewhat so that it reads \u201cIf \\(k\\) is true then time\nis infinite\u201d. In view of what \\(k\\) says, we know this much:\n\n(1)\nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, it is the case\n    that if \\(k\\) is true then time is\n    infinite.\n\nBut, of course, we also have\n\n(2)\nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, it is the case that\n    \\(k\\) is true.\n\nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, we have thus derived a\nconditional together with its antecedent. Using modus ponens\nwithin the scope of the supposition, we now derive the\nconditional\u2019s consequent under that same supposition:\n\n(3)\nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, it is the case\n    that time is infinite.\n\nThe rule of conditional proof now entitles us to affirm a conditional\nwith our supposition as antecedent:\n\n(4)\nIf \\(k\\) is true then time is infinite.\n\nBut, since (4) just is \\(k\\) itself, we thus have\n\n(5)\n\\(k\\) is true.\n\nFinally, putting (4) and (5) together by modus ponens, we\nget\n\n(6)\nTime is infinite.\n\nWe seem to have established that time is infinite using no assumptions\nbeyond the existence of the self-referential sentence \\(k\\), along with\nthe seemingly obvious principles about truth that took us to (1) and\n also from (4) to (5). And the same goes for\n (Q),\n since we could have used the same form of argument to reach the false\nconclusion that all numbers are prime.\n",
