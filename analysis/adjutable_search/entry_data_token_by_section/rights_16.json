    "main_text": "Critiques of Rights || Critiques of Rights Doctrine\n7.1 Critiques of Rights Doctrine\n\nMarx attacked the substance of the revolutionary eighteenth century\nAmerican and French political documents that proclaimed the\nfundamental \u201crights of man\u201d: liberty, equality, security,\nproperty, and the free exercise of religion. Marx objected that these\nalleged rights derive from a false conception of the human individual\nas unrelated to others, as having interests can be defined without\nreference to others, and as always potentially in conflict with\nothers. The rights-bearing individual is an \u201cisolated\nmonad\u2026 withdrawn behind his private interests and whims and\nseparated from the community\u201d (Marx 1844, 146).\n\nThe right of property, Marx asserted, exemplifies the isolating and\nanti-social character of these alleged rights of man. On the one hand,\nthe right of property is the right to keep others at a distance: the\nlegal equivalent of a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, the right\nof property allows an owner to transfer his resources at his own\npleasure and for his own gain, without regard even for the desperate\nneed for those resources elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, Marx held that the much-celebrated individual right to\nliberty reinforces selfishness. Those who are ascribed the right to do\nwhat they wish so long as they do not hurt others will perpetuate a\nculture of egoistic obsession. As for equality, the achievement of\nequal rights in a liberal state merely distracts people from noticing\nthat their equality is purely formal: a society with formally equal\nrights will continue to be divided by huge inequalities in economic\nand political power. Finally, these so-called \u201cnatural\u201d\nrights are in fact not natural to humans at all. They are simply the\ndefining elements of the rules of the modern mode of production,\nperfectly suited to fit each individual into the capitalist\nmachine.\n\nCommunitarians (Taylor, Walzer, MacIntyre, Sandel) sound several of\nthe same themes in their criticisms of contemporary liberal and\nlibertarian theories. The communitarians object that humans are not,\nas such theories assume, \u201cantecedently individuated.\u201d\nNozick\u2019s \u201cstate of nature\u201d theorizing, for example,\nerrs in presuming that individuals outside of a stable, state-governed\nsocial order will develop the autonomous capacities that make them\ndeserving of rights. Nor should we attempt, as in Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position, to base an argument for rights on what individuals\nwould choose in abstraction from their particular identities and\ncommunity attachments. There is no way to establish a substantive\npolitical theory on what all rational agents want in the abstract.\nRather, theorists should look at the particular social contexts in\nwhich real people live their lives, and to the meanings that specific\ngoods carry within different cultures. This communitarian critique\ncontinues by accusing liberal and libertarian theories of being\nfalsely universalistic, in insisting that all societies should bend\nthemselves to fit within a standard-sized grid of rights. Insofar as\nwe should admit rights into our understanding of the world at all,\ncommunitarians say, we should see them as part of ongoing practices of\nsocial self-interpretation and negotiation\u2014 and so as rules that\ncan vary significantly between cultures.\n\nThese kinds of criticisms have been discussed in detail (e.g., Gutmann\n1985, Waldron 1987b, Mulhall and Swift 1992). Their validity turns on\nweighty issues in moral and political theory. What can be said here is\nthat a common theme in most of these criticisms\u2014that prominent\nrights doctrines are in some way excessively individualistic or\n\u201catomistic\u201d\u2014need not cut against any theory merely\nbecause it uses the language of rights. Ignatieff (2003, 67)\nerrs, for example, when he charges that \u201crights language cannot\nbe parsed or translated into a nonindividualistic, communitarian\nframework. It presumes moral individualism and is nonsensical outside\nthat assumption.\u201d\n\nAs we saw above, the language of rights is able to accommodate\nrightholders who are individuals as such, but also individuals\nconsidered as members of groups, as well as groups themselves, states,\npeoples, and so on. Indeed the non-individualistic potential of\nrights-language is more than a formal possibility. The doctrine of\ninternational human rights\u2014the modern cousin of eighteenth\ncentury natural rights theory\u2014ascribes several significant\nrights to groups. The international Convention against Genocide, for\nexample, forbids actions intending to destroy any national, ethnic,\nracial or religious group; and both of the human rights Covenants\nascribe to peoples the right to self-determination. Such examples show\nthat the language of rights is not individualistic in its essence.\n",
