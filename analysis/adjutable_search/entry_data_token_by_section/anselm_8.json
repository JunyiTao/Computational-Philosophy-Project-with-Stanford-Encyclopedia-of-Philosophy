    "main_text": "Freedom, Sin, and Redemption || Freedom and sin\n4.3 Grace and redemption\n\nLike the fallen angels, the first human beings willed happiness in\npreference to justice. By doing so they abandoned the will for justice\nand became unable to will justice for its own sake. Apart from divine\ngrace, then, fallen human beings cannot help but sin. Anselm claims\nthat we are still free, because we continue to be such that if we had\nrectitude of will, we could preserve it for its own sake; but we\ncannot exercise our freedom, since we no longer have the\nrectitude of will to preserve. (Whether fallen human beings also\nretain the power for self-initiated action apart from divine grace is\na tricky question, and one I do not propose to answer here.)\n\nSo the restoration of human beings to the justice they were intended\nto enjoy requires divine grace. But even more is needed than\nGod\u2019s restoration of the will for justice. In Cur Deus\nHomo (Why God Became A Human Being, or Why the\nGod-Man?) Anselm famously attempts to show on purely rational\ngrounds that the debt incurred by human sin could be suitably\ndischarged, and the affront to God\u2019s infinite dignity could be\nsuitably rectified, only if one who was both fully divine and fully\nhuman took it upon himself to offer his own life on our behalf.\n",
