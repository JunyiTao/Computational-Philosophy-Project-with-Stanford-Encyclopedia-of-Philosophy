    "main_text": "Reading the contemporary\u2014structure || Transforming schools and movements\n6.2 Transforming schools and movements\n\nA second broad category of activity in contemporary Africana\nphilosophy involves something like the improvisational approach\ndiscussed above. Here we find scholars creatively reinventing\nmainstream philosophical traditions, schools, and methods using\nresources from Africana thought. For reasons of space, I can only\nmention a few examples here, and must do so swiftly, on the way to\ncovering this category with nowhere near the depth or breadth it\ndeserves.\n\nThe clearest examples of this transformative tendency often carry the\nsame misleadingly simple adjectival labels as Cedric Robinson\u2019s\nBlack Marxism. Consider Gordon\u2019s pioneering efforts, in\nExistentia Africana (2000) and elsewhere, to define an\nAfricana and decolonial mode of existential phenomenology, and to\nbuild what has become a globe-spanning intellectual community around\nit. Or consider what Gordon calls \u201cAfrican-American\npragmatism,\u201d which has continued to grow and develop in the wake\nof the germinal interventions by West and Harris (Gordon 2008,\n93\u201399). Eddie Glaude (2007) in particular makes clear that this\nwork is not simply about Black people appropriating canonical\nphilosophic resources (or, less kindly, about canonical theory\n\u201cin blackface,\u201d as it were). Very much in the spirit of\nRobinson\u2019s intervention, it is about the way Africana\nintellectual traditions sometimes anticipate and improve upon the\nmoves that define our artificially circumscribed mainstream\ntraditions, and about contemporary scholars putting these traditions\ninto mutually enriching conversation.\n\nWhat Gordon calls \u201cAfrican American analytical philosophy\u201d\n(2008, 110) deserves special mention here, as it brings tools from the\ndominant philosophical paradigm in the Anglophone world to bear on\nAfricana thought\u2019s distinctive themes, issues, and figures.\nMills and Shelby, who join Gordon in the top tier of Africana\nphilosophy\u2019s most visible and influential figures, work squarely\nand creatively in the ethico-political wing of this tradition,\nbuilding on the work of founders like Boxill and Appiah with results\nthat will receive further consideration below. Similar inroads are\nbecoming apparent in aesthetics (Taylor 2016), epistemology (Dotson\n2017), philosophy of language (Anderson 2015), and other fields.\n",
