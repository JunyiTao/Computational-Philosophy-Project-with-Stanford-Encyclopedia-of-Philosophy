    "main_text": "History of the Term and the Concept of Information\n2. History of the Term and the Concept of Information\n\nThe detailed history of both the term \u201cinformation\u201d and\nthe various concepts that come with it is complex and for the larger\npart still has to be written (Seiffert 1968; Schnelle 1976; Capurro\n1978, 2009; Capurro & Hj\u00f8rland 2003). The exact meaning of\nthe term \u201cinformation\u201d varies in different philosophical\ntraditions and its colloquial use varies geographically and over\ndifferent pragmatic contexts. Although an analysis of the notion of\ninformation has been a theme in Western philosophy from its early\ninception, the explicit analysis of information as a philosophical\nconcept is recent, and dates back to the second half of the twentieth\ncentury. At this moment it is clear that information is a pivotal\nconcept in the sciences and humanities and in our every day life.\nEverything we know about the world is based on information we received\nor gathered and every science in principle deals with information.\nThere is a network of related concepts of information, with roots in\nvarious disciplines like physics, mathematics, logic, biology, economy\nand epistemology. \n\nUntil the second half of the twentieth century almost no modern\nphilosopher considered \u201cinformation\u201d to be an important\nphilosophical concept. The term has no lemma in the well-known\nencyclopedia of Edwards (1967) and is not mentioned in Windelband\n(1903). In this context the interest in \u201cPhilosophy of\nInformation\u201d is a recent development. Yet, with hindsight from\nthe perspective of a history of ideas, reflection on the notion of\n\u201cinformation\u201d has been a predominant theme in the history\nof philosophy. The reconstruction of this history is relevant for the\nstudy of information.\n\nA problem with any \u201chistory of ideas\u201d approach is the\nvalidation of the underlying assumption that the concept one is\nstudying has indeed continuity over the history of philosophy. In the\ncase of the historical analysis of information one might ask whether\nthe concept of \u201cinformatio\u201d discussed by\nAugustine has any connection to Shannon information, other than a\nresemblance of the terms. At the same time one might ask whether\nLocke\u2019s \u201chistorical, plain method\u201d is an important\ncontribution to the emergence of the modern concept of information\nalthough in his writings Locke hardly uses the term\n\u201cinformation\u201d in a technical sense. As is shown below,\nthere is a conglomerate of ideas involving a notion of information\nthat has developed from antiquity till recent times, but further study\nof the history of the concept of information is necessary. \n\nAn important recurring theme in the early philosophical analysis of\nknowledge is the paradigm of manipulating a piece of wax: either by\nsimply deforming it, by imprinting a signet ring in it or by writing\ncharacters on it. The fact that wax can take different shapes and\nsecondary qualities (temperature, smell, touch) while the volume\n(extension) stays the same, make it a rich source of analogies,\nnatural to Greek, Roman and medieval culture, where wax was used both\nfor sculpture, writing (wax tablets) and encaustic painting. One finds\nthis topic in writings of such diverse authors as Democritus, Plato,\nAristotle, Theophrastus, Cicero, Augustine, Avicenna, Duns Scotus,\nAquinas, Descartes and Locke.\n",
