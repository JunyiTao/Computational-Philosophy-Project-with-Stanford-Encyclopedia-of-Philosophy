In particular, the\nempiricist seeks to characterize the psychological states that guide\nindividuals\u2019 application of an expression to particular cases,\nand to explain how linguistic coordination within a linguistic\ncommunity is achieved.\n\nClearly individual speakers must have some implicit assumptions about\nthe reference of a word that guide their verdicts about whether it\napplies to particular cases (Jackson 1998a, 29\u201342). Your\njudgments about whether a particular Gettier case counts as knowledge,\nfor instance, are guided by your prior understanding of the term\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, and your answer is only justified insofar as\nit reflects that prior understanding. An empiricist seeks to explain\nthese facts by positing a stable internal psychological\nstate\u2014something like an internal reference-fixing\ntemplate\u2014that guides your verdicts no matter what the\nactual world turns out to be like.\n\nIt\u2019s equally clear that members of the same linguistic community\ngenerally manage to use words to reliably coordinate their beliefs and\nactions (Jackson 1998b, 2004). When I ask you to pass the salt, you\nknow roughly which white granular substance I\u2019m asking\nfor\u2014you know, for instance, that it would be inappropriate to\npass the sugar bowl or the pepper grinder. This sort of everyday\ncoordination requires speakers to have similar dispositions to\nclassify things as falling into the extension of words, and it\nrequires that these similarities in classificatory dispositions be\nmutually obvious to all concerned: for it to make sense for me to say\n\u2018please pass the salt\u2019 in order to get salt, it must be\ncommon knowledge between us that we\u2019re inclined to classify\nroughly the same things as \u2018salt\u2019. An empiricist explains\nthis common knowledge by positing implicit conventions that\nrequire everyone to associate the very same reference-fixing template\nwith a given word (Jackson 1998b; Lewis 1969).\n\nAn empiricist use of the 2D framework is intended to show that this\ncore explanatory project is not undermined by the intuitions about\nnames and natural kind terms highlighted by semantic externalists\n(Jackson 1998a;\n 1998b).[11]\n2.2.2 The role of the 2D framework\n\nExternalists argue that ordinary speakers are often ignorant or\nmistaken about the precise nature (modal profile) of the objects,\nkinds or properties their words pick out. But linguistic conventions\ndon\u2019t always fix the reference by specifying the nature of the\nreference. Perhaps the conventions governing names and natural kind\nterms are structured in a similar way to indexicals. For instance, we\nmight have an implicit semantic rule requiring us to take\n\u2018water\u2019 to pick out whatever chemical kind\nactually explains a certain suite of superficial observable\nproperties: e.g., being a clear, potable, odorless liquid that fills\nlakes and streams around here (Jackson 1998a, 1998b). On this\nanalysis, \u2018water\u2019 just is an implicitly indexical\nexpression, picking out different chemical kinds depending on which\nworld is actual. If this rule is what one must accept to count as\ncompetent with the meaning of the expression type \u2018water\u2019,\nthen it is no surprise that competent speakers often fail to realize\nthat water = H2O.\n\nOf course, it is an empirical question whether names and natural kind\nterms are in fact governed by indirect reference-fixing rules of this\nsort. But according to Jackson, you can test whether your implicit\nunderstanding of \u2018water\u2019 is structured in this way by\nconsidering possible situations in two different roles: as your\nactual environment or as a mere counterfactual\npossibility (Jackson 1998a, ch. 2). Consider two different\npossible worlds based on Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought experiment\n(Putnam 1972). In the first world, Earth, the clear potable stuff that\nfills lakes and streams and is habitually called \u2018water\u2019\nby English speakers is H2O. The second world, Twin Earth,\nis exactly the same except that the stuff that has these properties is\nthe complex chemical kind, XYZ. If your commonsense understanding of\n\u2018water\u2019 is governed by the proposed reference-fixing\nconvention, it would lead you to identify different chemical\nsubstances as water depending on what your actual environment is like:\nif your actual environment is Earth, then water is H2O; but\nif your actual environment is Twin Earth, then water is XYZ. If you\nassume that water is actually H2O, moreover, you\nwill judge that water is essentially H2O in all\ncounterfactual circumstances. And if you assume water is\nactually XYZ, then you\u2019ll judge water is\nessentially XYZ.\n\nThis pattern of dispositions to apply the term \u2018water\u2019 can\nbe depicted on a 2D matrix as follows:\n\nEmpiricist 2D matrix for \u2018water\u2019:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nEarth\nTwin Earth \n\n\\(\\langle\\)Earth, \\(a, t\\rangle\\)\nH2O\nH2O \n\n\\(\\langle\\)Twin Earth, \\(a, t\\rangle\\)\nXYZ\nXYZ  \n\n\n\nAlong the vertical axis are ranged centered possible worlds (a\npossible world, with a designated agent a and time\nt within that world) representing different ways\nyour actual environment could be like; and the same worlds are ranged\nalong the horizontal axis representing different counterfactual\ncircumstances of evaluation. This matrix reflects your commonsense\ndispositions to apply the term \u2018water\u2019 to different\nchemical kinds on the basis of whether it actually plays certain\nsuperficial roles described in other commonsense terms\n(\u2018clear\u2019, \u2018potable\u2019, \u2018liquid\u2019,\n etc).[12]\n\nSemantic externalists take these sorts of judgments about Twin Earth\nto militate against a traditional account of meaning\u2014for they\nsuggest that your understanding does not fully determine the nature of\nthe reference. But according to Jackson, the only conclusion that is\nwarranted is that the meaning of your term is more complex than the\ntradition suggests: your verdicts about possible worlds considered as\nactual reflect your na\u00efve reference-fixing criterion,\nand your verdicts about possible worlds considered as counterfactual\nreflect the theoretical criterion you would accept after you\nlearned all the relevant empirical facts about your actual\nenvironment. These two types of criterion can be modeled in possible\nworld semantics as intensions: an A-intension (for\n\u2018Actual\u2019) is a function from worlds considered as actual\nto extensions, while a C-intension (for \u2018Counterfactual\u2019)\nis a function from worlds considered as counterfactual to extensions\n(Jackson 1998a, ch.2). The diagonal of our matrix corresponds to the\nA-intension you associate with \u2018water\u2019; and the first\nhorizontal row corresponds to the C-intension of your term\n\u2018water\u2019 (assuming that \\(\\langle\\)Earth, \\(a, t\\rangle\\)\nrepresents your real-world environment).\n\nSemantic externalists acknowledge only the C-intension as modeling an\nexpression\u2019s semantic content, but 2D empiricists insist that\nboth A- and C-intensions reflect important aspects of a competent\nEnglish speaker\u2019s understanding of a word like\n\u2018water\u2019. In particular, they take A-intensions to reflect\nwhat is understood and communicated by minimally competent English\nspeakers and what guides their everyday classifications. The\nsuggestion, then, is that A-intensions capture the shared,\nconventionally entrenched understanding of reference-fixing conditions\nposited by the empiricist approach to meaning.\n\nBy itself, this 2D framework offers no guarantee that the hypothetical\njudgments recorded by an A-intension are produced by a stable\nreference-fixing criterion. Nor does it guarantee that the very same\nA-intension will be generated for all competent speakers in your\nlinguistic community. However, according to Jackson, we have solid\nempirical reasons to think these conditions are satisfied in the case\nof names and natural kind terms. First, the widespread acceptance of\nthe externalist thought experiments demonstrates that we do in fact\nshare similar reference-fixing criteria for terms like\n\u2018water\u2019 and \u2018G\u00f6del\u2019 (Jackson 1998a,\n38\u201339). Second, the empiricist model of meaning provides the\nbest psychological explanation of how such linguistic coordination is\nachieved (Jackson\n 1998b).[13]\n2.2.3 Apriori conceptual analysis\n\nIn addition to clarifying the structure of our semantic understanding,\nthe 2D framework can help justify specific conceptual analyses. The\ncriteria that implicitly guide our everyday use of a term are often\nembodied in recognitional or inferential dispositions rather than in\nconsciously accessible rules. Indeed, Jackson likens grasp of\nreference-fixing criteria for particular expressions to our ability to\nrecognize the grammaticality of sentences in one\u2019s own language\n(2000). Just as linguists can construct a grammar for your language on\nthe basis of your judgments about the acceptability of particular\nsentences, you can construct an analysis of the meaning you associate\nwith an expression on the basis of your application of a term to\nhypothetical cases. The correct analysis must capture the full range\nof your confident judgments involving the target expression, while\nabstracting away from performance errors and other interfering factors\n(Jackson 1998a, 31\u201337).\n\nThis psychological model helps explain how you can come to know the\ncorrect analysis of your term \u2018water\u2019 by noting which\nproperties you treat as \u201cobvious and central\u201d when filling\nin a 2D matrix like the one above (Jackson 1998a, 31). The 2D\nframework prompts you to consider possible cases in two different\nways\u2013as actual or as counterfactual. This allows you to know\nwhether the content of your term varies depending on what your actual\nenvironment is like (e.g. \u2018water\u2019) or whether it is stable\n(e.g. \u2018bachelor\u2019). Moreover, careful attention to your\nreactions to these suppositions will allow you to make explicit which\nsuperficial properties implicitly guide your application of the term.\nFor instance, you may discover that your implicit criterion for\napplying \u2018water\u2019 is that water \\(=_{df}\\) the actual\nchemical kind in your environment that is a clear, potable, odorless\nliquid that falls as rain and fills lakes and streams. Alternatively,\nyour use of the term \u2018water\u2019 may be guided by the types of\ncausal relations invoked in causal theories of reference: water\n\\(=_{df}\\) the actual natural kind that has been the dominant cause of\nyour community\u2019s past use of the term \u2018water\u2019.\nIndeed, Jackson suggests that standard causal theories of reference\nare based on this method of conceptual analysis (1998a, 37\u201341).\n[See the entry on\n causal theories of mental content.]\n\nThe conceptual analyses produced by this method count as apriori,\naccording to the 2D empiricist, because you can know them to be\ncorrect \u201cindependently of knowing what the actual world is\nlike\u201d (Jackson 1998a, 51). The evidence that supports such\nanalyses consists in purely hypothetical judgments: judgments about\nhow to classify cases on the supposition that your\nenvironment is like X, or like Y.\nSince such hypothetical judgments don\u2019t\nrequire you to determine what your real environment is like,\nyour justification for accepting an analysis is not based on empirical\nknowledge. And to change your judgment about a purely hypothetical\ncase would be to change the meaning of your term (Jackson 1998a,\n44\u201346).\n2.2.4 The role of conceptual analysis in metaphysics\n\nJackson claims that apriori conceptual analysis plays a crucial role\nin metaphysics (Jackson 1994; 1998a). Metaphysical reductions provide\na constitutive account of some target domain (e.g., beliefs, free\nwill, water, moral rightness) in terms of more basic features of the\nworld (e.g., the properties postulated by an idealized physics, ideas\nin the mind of God, the mosaic of sense data). A physicalist about\nmental states, for instance, is committed to there being specific\nfacts about the microphysical structure of the world that suffice for\nthe existence of beliefs, desires and sensory experiences. The\nphysicalist is thus committed to metaphysically necessary\n\u201centailments\u201d connecting claims about the two domains:\nit\u2019s metaphysically necessary that if such-and-such physical\nfacts obtain, then such-and-such mental facts obtain. This\nmetaphysical entailment relation can arguably be cashed out in terms\nof global supervenience (Jackson 1998a, 6\u201314). [See the entry on\n supervenience.]\n\nThe role of conceptual analysis is to show that a putative reduction\nrespects the original meaning of the target expression (Jackson 1998a,\n28). A physicalist won\u2019t succeed in accounting for free will if\nshe identifies free will with having a temperature of 37.4\u00ba C\n\u2013 such a \u201creduction\u201d would simply change the subject\nunder discussion. A successful reduction must be answerable to our\noriginal shared understanding of the target expression\u2014and\nelucidating this original understanding just is what conceptual\nanalysis does. So if conceptual analyses are knowable apriori, it\nfollows that metaphysical reductions must always be backed by apriori\nentailments between the base-level claim (such as a physical\ndescription of the world) and the target claim (such as the claim that\nhumans have free will).\n\nOn this empiricist account, conceptual analysis plays a modest\nmetaphysical role. Conceptual analysis captures apriori entailment\nrelations among your ideas; but it cannot tell you whether there\nare any objects, kinds, or properties that satisfy your\ncurrent reference-fixing assumptions (Jackson 1998a, 42\u20134).\nMoreover, the meaning you currently associate with a term may be\npragmatically deficient: e.g., it may not be determinate enough to\nsettle certain hard cases or it may not allow you to draw useful\ndistinctions in your actual environment. In such cases, you would have\ngood pragmatic reasons to change the meaning of your term (Jackson\n1998a, 44\u20136, 53\u20134). What the empiricist denies is that\nchanging your current criteria for applying a term can ever get you\ncloser to the truth about what you meant all along.\n2.3 The rationalist project\n2.3.1 Connecting meaning, apriority, and possibility\n\nFor an empiricist, an expression\u2019s meaning reflects the causal\nmechanisms guiding everyday classification and communication. For a\nrationalist, in contrast, an expression\u2019s meaning reflects what\nis apriori accessible to the speaker on the basis of ideal reflection.\nThe empiricist is primarily concerned with causal explanation of\nlinguistic facts, while the rationalist is primarily concerned with\nidealized apriori rationality and insights into objective possibility.\nThis difference in emphasis can have significant ramifications for\nG2D.\n\nDavid Chalmers has developed a detailed and influential rationalist\ninterpretation of the 2D framework. This semantic project is situated\nwithin a broadly rationalist tradition that posits a \u201cgolden\ntriangle\u201d of necessary constitutive relations between meaning,\napriority, and possibility (2004; 2006a; 2012).\n\nFollowing Frege (1892), Chalmers is interested in capturing a notion\nof meaning that is finer-grained than reference. Frege pointed out\nthat sentences containing co-referential expressions like\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 can differ in\ncognitive significance: someone who is competent with these\ntwo names may not realize they are co-referential and may therefore\nuse them differently in making and justifying claims. Frege took\nsameness of cognitive significance to be the mark of sameness of\nmeaning. According to a 2D rationalist, sameness of cognitive\nsignificance can in most cases be elucidated in terms of apriori\nequivalence: two expressions are associated with the same meaning\niff one can know that they pick out the very same things on the basis\nof apriori reflection alone (Chalmers\n 2002b).[14]\n This constitutive link between meaning and apriority constitutes the\nfirst side of the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d.\n\nThe second side of the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d connects meaning\nwith possibility. Following Carnap (1947), Chalmers suggests that we\ncan use possible worlds semantics to individuate particular meanings\nin terms of their representational properties. In standard possible\nworld semantics, the meaning of \u2018doctor\u2019 is identified\nwith an intension that maps possible worlds to extensions. An\nexpression\u2019s intension reflects the modal profile of the object,\nkind, or property picked out. Identifying meanings with intensions\ntherefore establishes an important constitutive connection between\nmeanings and modal claims. If \u2018doctor\u2019 and\n\u2018physician\u2019 are associated with the same meaning, then\nit\u2019s true in all possible worlds that all doctors are\nphysicians and all physicians are doctors. And conversely if two\nexpressions are co-extensive in all possible worlds, then\nthey have the same meaning.\n\nThe third side of the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d connects\npossibility with apriority. Following Kant (1787), a rationalist about\nmodality holds that what is necessary is always knowable apriori and\nwhat is knowable apriori is always necessary. Thus ideal apriori\nreflection can be trusted to reveal the space of possibility.\n\nThis \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of constitutive relations generates\na distinctive rationalist account of meaning. To be competent with an\nexpression\u2019s meaning is to be in an internal cognitive state\nthat puts one in a position to identify its extension in any possible\nworld on the basis of apriori reflection alone. Apriori reflection\nwill also suffice to determine whether two expressions are associated\nwith the same or different meanings. This rationalist approach to\nmeaning contrasts with the empiricist one: whereas the empiricist uses\ncausally efficacious cognitive mechanisms to isolate the\nreference-fixing criteria currently associated with an expression, the\nrationalist uses the subject\u2019s ideally rational\njudgments to isolate the complex cognitive states that would\nground those reflective judgments. As a consequence, the aspect of\nunderstanding that corresponds to a rationalist meaning may turn out\nto be more heterogeneous and less stable than the shared, causally\nefficacious \u2018templates\u2019 postulated by the empiricist. The\n\u201cgolden triangle\u201d also involves a distinctive rationalist\naccount of modal epistemology, according to which ideal apriori\nconceivability is a fail-safe guide to metaphysical possibility. This\nmodal rationalism affords a simple and attractive account of our\naccess to modal facts (Chalmers 1996, 136\u20138; 1999, 488\u201391;\n 2002a).[15]\n\nThis simple rationalist picture of meaning and modality, however, was\nundermined by externalist thought experiments. Kripke\u2019s (1980)\nobservation that certain necessary truths, like \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019, are only knowable aposteriori threatens both the\nidea that linguistic competence affords apriori access to the truth-\nand applicability-conditions of one\u2019s words and the idea that\nnecessary truths are always apriori knowable. The guiding idea behind\n2D rationalism is that a rationalist can accommodate Kripke\u2019s\nexamples by moving to a 2D semantic framework. In particular, the 2D\nframework can be used to isolate an aspect of meaning that satisfies\nthe \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of constitutive relations among\nmeaning, apriority and modality.\n\nRoughly, the idea is that \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is\naposteriori because we associate distinct reference-fixing criteria\nwith the two names: e.g., being the brightest star visible in the\nevening and the brightest star visible the morning. According to the\n2D rationalist, these reference-fixing criteria are (i) an aspect of\nmeaning, (ii) which can be known apriori via conceptual analysis, and\n(iii) which suffices to fix the applicability conditions for every\npossible world considered as one\u2019s actual environment. If the 2D\nframework can be used to isolate such an aspect of meaning for all\nexpressions, we will have vindicated the rationalist\u2019s\n\u201cgolden triangle\u201d connecting meaning, apriority and\npossibility.\n\nVindicating this \u201cgolden triangle\u201d constitutes a primary\ntheoretical constraint for a rationalist interpretation of 2D\nsemantics. A 2D semantics that meets this constraint would play a\nwide-ranging role in philosophy. It would account for core semantic\nroles associated with the Fregean notion of sense (Chalmers 2002b) and\nthe traditional notion of a proposition (Chalmers 2011a). In addition,\nrationalist 2D semantics promises to define a versatile notion of\nnarrow thought content suited to playing key explanatory and\nevaluative roles in commonsense psychology (Chalmers 2002c).\nFurthermore, the rationalist approach to meaning and modality\nunderwrites a distinctive form of apriori reasoning about the nature\nof the actual world:\n\nThere is a long tradition in philosophy of using apriori methods to\ndraw conclusions about what is possible and what is necessary, and\noften in turn to draw conclusions about matters of substantive\nmetaphysics. Arguments like this typically have three steps: first an\nepistemic claim (about what can be known or conceived), from there to\na modal claim (about what is possible or necessary), and from there to\na metaphysical claim (about the nature of things in the world).\n(Chalmers 2002a, 145)\n\n\nChalmers has developed an influential anti-physicalist argument\nalong these lines, which relies on a rationalist 2D semantic framework\nto establish that facts about phenomenal consciousness cannot be\nreduced to physical or functional facts about the brain (1996; 2009).\nSee the supplementary document:\n\nThe 2D argument against materialism.\n\n2.3.2 The epistemic interpretation of the 2D framework\n\nAny interpretation of the 2D framework must answer the following two\nquestions:\n\nWhat is the nature of the worlds to be considered as actual?\nWhat is the principle for determining an expression\u2019s\nextension relative to worlds considered as actual?\n\n\nBut the rationalist project imposes specific constraints on how these\nquestions are answered. To vindicate the \u201cgolden\ntriangle\u201d, the rationalist must identify a way of mapping an\nindividual speaker\u2019s understanding of particular expressions\nonto possible worlds that affords apriori access to the entire space\nof possibility. This is not a trivial requirement: standard ways of\ninterpreting the 2D framework cannot vindicate the rationalist\nproject. However Chalmers has developed a distinctive\n\u201cepistemic\u201d interpretation of the 2D framework that he\nbelieves can establish the relevant constitutive links between\nmeaning, apriority and possibility (2004, 2006a).\n\nA rationalist 2D semantics must vindicate the following principle:\n\nCore Thesis: For any sentence \\(S,\\) \\(S\\) is apriori iff \\(S\\)\nhas a necessary 1-intension. (Chalmers 2004, 165)\n\n\nA sentence\u2019s 1-intension is an intension that corresponds to the\ndiagonal of a 2D matrix. So the Core Thesis affirms that a token\nsentence is apriori (for a subject at a particular time) just in case\nthere is no possible way the world might be that, if it actually\nobtained, would make S false. In effect, the Core\nThesis sums up the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of constitutive\nconnections the rationalist hopes to establish between meaning,\napriority, and possibility: (i) it postulates a possible way the world\ncould be for every apriori coherent hypothesis, and vice versa; and\n(ii) this tight connection between apriority and possibility is\nreflected in an aspect of linguistic meaning, the\n 1-intension.[16]\n\nThe major obstacle to vindicating the Core Thesis for standard\ninterpretations of the 2D framework is the assignment\nprinciple\u2014the way 2D theories assign extensions relative to\n\u201cworlds considered as actual\u201d. A natural way of\nunderstanding the injunction to consider a possible world as actual is\nto simply imagine a possible world, locate a person in it at a time,\nand then rely on ordinary interpretive methods to decide what exactly\nthat person in those empirical circumstances is referring to when\nusing a given expression. Chalmers calls this strategy for assigning\n1-intensions to expressions a \u201ccontextualist\u201d\ninterpretation of the 2D framework. What\u2019s distinctive of a\ncontextualist approach is (i) that a token of the target expression\nmust be located within the world considered as actual, and (ii) that\nthe expression is assigned an extension on the basis of how it\u2019s\nused in that world. On this approach, a 1-intension will be\nundefined for possible worlds that do not contain a token of\nthe target expression: no extension can be assigned for such worlds,\nnot even an empty extension.\n\nThis contextualist approach to assigning 1-intensions is incompatible\nwith the Core Thesis (Chalmers 2004, 167\u00ad\u2013176). Consider\nsentences like \u2018Language exists\u2019 or \u2018A sentient\nbeing exists\u2019: the meaning of these sentences seems to guarantee\nthat they will be true in every possible context in which they are\nused. So on the contextualist approach, these sentences should be\nassigned necessary 1-intensions, mapping every possible context of use\nto the truth-value True. But contrary to the Core Thesis, these\nsentences are not apriori truths knowable independently of\nany empirical evidence. There\u2019s no contradiction in the very\nidea of a world without language or thought and we can easily imagine\nwhat such a world would be like; it\u2019s just that our everyday\nexperience allows us to immediately rule out the possibility that our\nactual environment is like that. The problem is that contextualist\n1-intensions are undefined for worlds without thought or language,\neven though they are both apriori coherent and metaphysically\npossible. So a necessary contextual 1-intension does not track\napriority or metaphysical necessity. Contextualist 1-intensions,\ntherefore, cannot satisfy the rationalist\u2019s Core\n Thesis.[17]\n\nThis difficulty can be avoided, Chalmers argues, if we rely on a\nnotion of epistemic possibility\u2014what seems\npossible after ideal rational reflection\u2014to interpret the 2D\nframework. More specifically, he focuses on the notion of apriori\ncoherence: claims that could be true for all one can tell on the basis\nof idealized apriori\n reasoning.[18]\n This notion of apriori coherence is used to answer the two\ninterpretive questions highlighted above: (i) apriori coherence is\nused to characterize the possibilities relative to which 1-intensions\nare defined, and (ii) apriori coherence is invoked to assign\n1-intensions to a speaker\u2019s expressions.\n\nFirst consider the possibilities that define 1-intensions. On the\nepistemic interpretation, the possibilities are not metaphysically\npossible contexts of use, but epistemically possible\n\u201cscenarios\u201d: maximally specific hypotheses about what\none\u2019s actual environment might be like that cannot be ruled out\nthrough apriori reasoning alone. Scenarios provide a complete\ncharacterization of the entire history of a universe, down to the last\nmicrophysical detail. They also provide perspectival\ninformation\u2014a notional \u201ccenter\u201d\u2014that indicates\nthe location from which the hypothetical universe is to be considered.\nThe crucial point is that scenarios are defined by their epistemic\nrole: they represent ways we can conceive of the actual world, within\nwhich we can try to identify familiar objects, kinds or\n properties.[19]\n\nThe second distinctive element of the epistemic interpretation of 2D\nsemantics is the procedure for assigning 1-intensions to a\nspeaker\u2019s expressions. On the epistemic approach, 1-intensions\nreflect relations of apriori coherence between descriptions of\npossible scenarios and ordinary language sentences:\n\nThe epistemic 1-intension for a sentence S is True\nat a scenario W iff \\((W\\) & not\\(-S)\\) is\napriori incoherent. (Chalmers 2004, 180\u20134)\n\n\nThis principle for assigning 1-intensions relies on the\nspeaker\u2019s ordinary ability to engage in object-level reasoning\nabout combinations of hypotheses: given the assumption that the\nscenario description W is true, you\u2019re asked\nto decide whether S must be true as well. If\nit\u2019s incoherent to accept \\((W\\) & not\\(-S)\\), your\nepistemic intension for S maps W\nto True, otherwise W is mapped to False. This\nepistemic assignment principle contrasts sharply with the\ncontextualist principle. The contextualist approach requires us to\nengage in explicit meta-linguistic reasoning to interpret the\nexpression \u2018S\u2019 as it\u2019s\nused within the possible world W. On the\nepistemic approach, in contrast, an extension is assigned to\n\u2018S\u2019 on the basis of the subject\u2019s\nown object-level reasoning using the expressions \u2018W\u2019\nand \u2018S\u2019.\n\nUnlike the contextualist approach, therefore, the epistemic assignment\nprinciple does not explicitly require that a scenario contain a token\nof the relevant expression type in order to assign an extension\nrelative to that scenario. As a consequence, sentences like\n\u2018Language exists\u2019 seem to pose no special problem for\nsatisfying the Core Thesis. The sentence \u2018Language exists\u2019\nwill have a contingent epistemic 1-intension, because there are\npossible scenarios that are apriori consistent with both the truth and\nfalsity of that sentence. For instance, consider a scenario in which\nthe only object is a giant lump of salt. To test whether your sentence\n\u2018Language exists\u2019 is true at this scenario considered as\nactual, you ask whether there is any incoherence in combining the\nclaim \u2018The only object that exists is a lump of salt\u2019 with\nthe claim \u2018It\u2019s not the case that language exists\u2019.\nIntuitively, this combination is coherent: there is no language in the\nsalt world. So the epistemic 1-intension for your sentence\n\u2018Language exists\u2019 yields the value False for that\nscenario. Since there are other scenarios relative to which the\nsentence \u2018Language exists\u2019 will have the value True, your\nsentence will have a contingent epistemic 1-intension. This contingent\nepistemic intension for your sentence \u2018Language exists\u2019\nreflects the fact that it\u2019s not apriori true that language\nexists. So it seems the epistemic assignment principle will allow\napriority and necessity of the 1-intension to go hand in hand, as\nrequired by the Core Thesis.\n2.3.3 Defining the E2D framework\n\nThere is further work to do in spelling out Chalmers\u2019 E2D\nframework in such a way as to vindicate his rationalist project. One\nway to think about the rationalist project is as a combination of the\nfollowing theses:\n\nSemantic foundationalism holds that there is a canonical level of\ndescription that affords transparent epistemic access to an objective\nspace of apriori possibilities \u2013 i.e. ways the world might be\nfor all that can be known independently of all experience.\nMeaning rationalism holds that implicit conceptual competence puts\none in a position to conclusively know the applicability conditions of\none\u2019s words relative to every such scenario considered as\nactual.\nModal rationalism holds that the space of apriori epistemic\npossibility is a failsafe guide to the space of metaphysical\npossibility: there are no modal illusions when scenarios or worlds are\ndescribed in canonical terms\n\n\nTogether, 1 and 2 constitute a sort of semantic reductionism: the\nmeaning of any ordinary language expression is reduced to the meanings\nof the base vocabulary via the epistemic exercise of considering\nscenarios as actual and worlds as counterfactual. And 3 ensures that\nthis epistemic exercise is an accurate guide to metaphysical\npossibility. Chalmers\u2019 Core Thesis is meant to capture this\ntight relationship between grasp of meaning, apriori reflection, and\nmetaphysical possibility.\n\nHowever, simply rejecting C2D in favor of E2D does not yet provide any\npositive account of what it is to entertain an epistemic scenario W,\nand how we should update our beliefs in the light of the supposition\nthat W is actual. Without these details, it\u2019s impossible to\ndetermine whether the Core Thesis is true. Perhaps it\u2019s\nimpossible to consider a scenario as actual without presupposing\none\u2019s own existence, or perhaps our best epistemic methods for\nupdating our beliefs presupposes the existence of those very beliefs;\nor perhaps there is no way of thinking about the world that\ndoesn\u2019t rely on some further empirical assumptions about the\nworld.\n\nChalmers has entered into these interpretive questions in considerable\ndetail over many publications. The starting point for his approach is\noutlined in (Chalmers and Jackson 2001), where he suggests that\nscenarios can be understood as PQTI sentences: where P states\nmicrophysical truths, Q states phenomenal truths, T is a\n\u2018that\u2019s all\u2019 clause indicating that P and Q provide\na complete description of a possible universe, and I indicates the\nsubject\u2019s notional location within that universe. P and Q employ\na canonical vocabulary that fully specifies the essential nature of\nthe fundamental properties upon which all other properties in a\npossible world supervene. Thus, PQTI sentences provide an\nepistemically transparent access to the space of epistemic and\nmetaphysical possibility (simply removing the self-locating\ninformation from a PQTI sentence yields a complete description of a\ncorresponding possible world, PQT). The 1-intensions of one\u2019s\nordinary language expressions are then determined by the individual\nsubject\u2019s ideally reflective dispositions to judge sentences\ntrue, assuming the truth of different PQTI-sentences. And 2-intensions\nare fixed by one\u2019s reasoning about PQT sentences considered as\ncounterfactual (given assumptions about PQTI). (Chalmers 2006, 2011b)\nfurther articulates how the space of epistemic possibility can be\nunderstood, how scenarios are related to possible worlds, and how 1-\nand 2-intensions are assigned to token representations.\n\nMore recently, in Constructing the World (2012), Chalmers has focused\nsquarely on the epistemic \u2018scrutability\u2019 relation that\nconnects our understanding of ordinary language expressions to\nbase-level descriptions of scenarios.\n\nApriori Scrutability: There is a compact class of basic truths D such\nthat for any truth S, one can conclusively know \u2018D \\(\\supset\\)\nS\u2019 apriori.\n\nChalmers still takes PQTI sentences to be a promising candidate for\nspecifying a scrutability base D, but he is open to the possibility\nthat the descriptive vocabulary in PQTI may need to be supplemented in\norder to capture some truths, such as truths about causal relations or\nquiddities. But while he can afford to be flexible about the exact\nnature of the scrutability base, Chalmers\u2019 rationalist program\ndepends on vindicating Apriori Scrutability for any sentence that is\nevaluable as possibly true or false (169\u201371). A good deal thus\nhangs on whether he is right that ideal epistemic procedures allow for\napriori justification, given an exhaustive base-level description of a\nscenario. Chalmers offers arguments to support the plausibility of\nthis view in (2012, ch. 4.).\n\nAccording to the \u2018frontloading\u2019 argument, we can have\nconclusive apriori knowledge of material conditionals of the form\n(PQTI  \\(\\supset\\)\nS). Chalmers argues that all empirical information relevant to\njustifying a verdict about S can be \u2018frontloaded\u2019 into the\nantecedent of the conditional, so information about one\u2019s\nreal-world environment, E, cannot play any essential role in\njustifying verdicts about the conditional. If E is itself apriori\nentailed by PQTI, it is not needed to justify a verdict about the\nconditional. And if E is not apriori entailed by PQTI, E will be\nirrelevant to justifying a verdict about the conditional. So our\njustification for the application conditionals that ground\n1-intensions is wholly apriori, and immune to empirical\n defeat.[20]\n2.3.4 Rationalist semantic values\n\nEpistemic 2D semantics differs in important respects from traditional\naccounts of meaning. Semantic theories normally describe general\nsemantic rules governing expression types, whereas epistemic\n2D semantics is based on a single individual\u2019s current\nunderstanding of a token expression. Kaplan and Jackson, for\ninstance, use the 2D framework to characterize the implicit\nconventions governing syntactically individuated expressions like\n\u2018I\u2019 or \u2018water\u2019 in our linguistic community. In\ncontrast, Chalmers uses the 2D framework to characterize your\npotentially idiosyncratic understanding of a particular use of an\nexpression on a given occasion\u2014e.g., the way you understood Al\nGore\u2019s fifth use of \u2018water\u2019 during a speech on\nclimate change. Moreover, on this account 2D semantic values depend on\nthe upshot of ideal rational reflection about apriori coherence\nrelations. Just what is involved in ideal rational reflection is an\nopen question. But it\u2019s plausible that it may depend on\nsubstantive constructive theorizing about the empirical scenario in\nquestion and on various non-obvious and idiosyncratic aspects of the\nsubject\u2019s initial cognitive state. In that case, identifying the\nprecise epistemic 1-intension associated with your understanding of\n\u2018water\u2019 will be a highly non-trivial matter, and it may be\nfar from obvious when your understanding of the term shifts so that\ntwo tokens no longer share the same epistemic 1-intension. This is\nwhy, in contrast with 2D empiricists like Jackson, a rationalist like\nChalmers denies that epistemic 1-intensions reflect the\nsubject\u2019s \u201cimplicit knowledge\u201d of a reference-fixing\ncriterion (e.g., Chalmers 2002a, 185; 2006b, \u00a75).\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that some epistemic intensions will\nreflect stable reference-fixing rules that are entrenched by implicit\nlinguistic conventions. But it\u2019s also possible that some\nepistemic intensions will reflect highly abstract, heterogeneous,\nunstable, and idiosyncratic aspects of a speaker\u2019s understanding\nat a given time. As a consequence, epistemic intensions are not\nguaranteed to line up with conventional linguistic meanings (Chalmers\n2002b). Given this divergence from standard semantic theories, one may\nwonder whether epistemic intensions deserve to be considered a kind of\nmeaning.\n\nHowever, according to the 2D rationalist, epistemic intensions play\nthe core semantic roles associated with Fregean senses (Chalmers\n2002b). Like Fregean senses, epistemic 1-intensions lend themselves to\na compositional semantic theory: the epistemic intension of a sentence\nis determined by the epistemic intensions of the component\nexpressions. Moreover, epistemic 1-intensions, like Fregean senses,\nreflect the speaker\u2019s own rational perspective on what her words\nrepresent. Two token names \u2018A\u2019 and\n\u2018B\u2019 have the same Fregean senses iff\nthe identity \u2018A = B\u2019 would strike the speaker as\ntrivially true. Similarly, a subject associates two token\nexpressions with the same epistemic intension iff they are apriori\n equivalent.[21]\n Finally, epistemic intensions may play a role similar to that of\nFregean senses in the semantics of attitude reports (Chalmers 2011a).\nOverall, then, epistemic intensions seem to provide an attractive\ntheoretical refinement of the Fregean notion of sense.\n\nIn addition, epistemic intensions arguably carve out a well-defined\nnotion of narrow content suited to playing key roles in commonsense\npsychology (Chalmers 2002c). Epistemic intensions reflect rational\nrelations among token mental states. Epistemic intensions can then be\nused to specify representational state types that are relevant to\nassessing a person\u2019s rationality and to explaining rational\nthought processes.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that epistemic 1-intensions are intended\nto explain only one aspect of meaning. The 2D semantic\nframework also posits 2-intensions (\u201ccounterfactual\u201d or\n\u201csubjunctive\u201d intensions), which reflect the modal profile\nof the object, kind or property picked out by an expression. But\nChalmers emphasizes that his E2D does not exclude positing further\naspects of meaning:\n\nTwo-dimensionalism is naturally combined with a semantic\npluralism, according to which expressions and utterances can be\nassociated with many different semantic (or quasi-semantic) values, by\nmany different semantic (or quasi-semantic) relations. On this view\nthere should be no question about whether the primary intension or the\nsecondary intension is the content of an utterance. Both can\nbe systematically associated with utterances, and both can play some\nof the roles that we want contents to play. Furthermore, there will\ncertainly be explanatory roles that neither of them play, so\ntwo-dimensionalism should not be seen as offering an exhaustive\naccount of the content of an utterance. Rather it is characterizing\nsome aspects of utterance content, aspects that can play a useful role\nin the epistemic and modal domains. (Chalmers 2006a, \u00a73.5)\n\n\nIn sum, Chalmers\u2019 highly idealized E2D framework is intended to\nearn its semantic keep by defining a kind of meaning capable of\nforging traditional rationalist connections between meaning,\nrationality and possibility. But he is happy to allow that there may\nbe other types of semantic values or structures that are needed to\nplay other semantic roles. [See entry on\n propositions,\n and\n structured propositions.]\n2.4 Objections to generalized 2D semantics\n\nThe G2D framework has attracted a wide variety of criticisms,\ntargeting its commitment to apriori conceptual analysis, its claim\nthat 1-intentions capture a type of meaning, and its internalist\napproach to assigning contents. The specific rationalist and\nempiricist applications of the G2D framework have also been\ncriticized. For a survey of these lines of criticism: see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nObjections to generalized 2D semantics\n\n3. The Metasemantic Interpretation\n3.1 2D semantics for externalists\n\nGeneralized 2D semantics seeks to vindicate a traditional internalist\nconception of meaning: it posits an extra aspect of meaning for all\nexpressions (the intension corresponding to the diagonal of a 2D\nmatrix) that is fully determined by a subject\u2019s internal states,\nand which in turn determines objective truth-conditions for their\nsentences. By enriching compositional semantics in this way, G2D\npromises a straightforward explanation of a variety of epistemic\nproperties of sentences: e.g., why a necessary sentence like\n\u2018Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 is not apriori knowable, what the\nsubject learns by accepting the sentence, or how the subject uses the\nsentence in reasoning.\n\nBut using the 2D framework to characterize the subject\u2019s\nepistemic perspective is not beholden to this internalist project.\nSemantic externalists reject the traditional view that our purely\ninternal states afford apriori access to reference-fixing conditions\nfor our words and thoughts. According to externalists, the basic\nassignments in a compositional semantics relate the subject\u2019s\nwords and thoughts to objective features of her\nenvironment\u2014objects, kinds and properties whose nature is\ncaptured by standard (1D) possible world semantics. Even externalists,\nhowever, can define 2D matrices that reflect the subject\u2019s\nepistemic perspective on the reference of her words and thoughts. For\nthe externalist, however, these 2D matrices will not represent\nmeanings\u2014a specific aspect of understanding that is\nrequired for linguistic or conceptual competence and which figures in\na compositional semantic theory that determines truth-conditions for\nsentences. On an externalist interpretation, 2D matrices merely\nreflect one aspect of a subject\u2019s partial semantic\nunderstanding of what her words and thoughts represent. Because\nexternalist 2D matrices don\u2019t represent meanings, moreover, the\nexternalist is free to use the 2D framework strategically to focus on\ndifferent aspects of the subject\u2019s understanding for different\nexplanatory purposes.\n\nRobert Stalnaker has articulated such an externalist interpretation of\nthe 2D framework in a series of influential papers spanning some\nthirty years. He was the first to introduce 2D matrices to specify\nwhat is communicated in situations where conversational partners are\npartly ignorant or mistaken about the nature of the objects, kinds or\nproperties their words pick out (1978), and he later extended his 2D\nframework to characterize the content of certain thoughts and attitude\nattributions (1981; 1987; 1988). In both cases, the 2D framework is\nused to define \u201cdiagonal\u201d intensions that reflect the\nsubject\u2019s partial understanding of which objects, kinds or\nproperties her words and thoughts represent. These diagonal intensions\nare not meanings or semantic values, since they do not figure in a\ncompositional semantic theory and they do not reflect conditions for\nconceptual or linguistic competence. The only meaning of an expression\non this account is its ordinary \u201chorizontal\u201d intension. In\neffect, Stalnaker\u2019s 2D matrices represent different meanings\nthat an expression could have had if it had occurred in\ndifferent empirical circumstances. This \u201cmetasemantic\u201d\ninterpretation of the 2D framework contrasts sharply the\n\u201csemantic\u201d interpretations favored by G2D theorists like\nJackson and Chalmers (Stalnaker 2001, 2004).\n\nProponents of G2D were influenced by Stalnaker\u2019s early papers\ndeveloping the 2D framework, and their views are often presented as\ncontinuous in motivation and form. But there are important theoretical\nconsequences that flow from the choice between 2D metasemantics and\ngeneralized 2D semantics. Indeed, Stalnaker himself is a vocal critic\nof generalized 2D semantics, rejecting its commitment to the semantic\nstatus of 2D matrices, its commitment to apriori conceptual analysis,\nand its internalist approach to reference determination.\n3.2 A 2D account of assertoric content\n\nThe metasemantic interpretation of the 2D framework was originally\ndeveloped as a way of explaining how the propositions conveyed by the\nassertion of a sentence can vary depending on the conversational\ncontext (Stalnaker 1978). In this seminal paper, Stalnaker proposes an\nattractive theoretical account of the role of assertion in a\nconversation, which is then used to explain how the assertoric use of\na necessary sentence like \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019, can\nconvey a specific empirical proposition within a given conversation.\nIn particular, Stalnaker argues that our commitment to construing such\nsentences as making felicitous and informative assertions will lead us\nto reinterpret their content in ways that can be modeled\nusing the 2D framework.\n\nThe guiding idea is that in making an assertion the speaker is trying\nto get the audience to rule out certain possibilities. In asserting\n\u2018It\u2019s cold today\u2019, for instance, I may be trying to\nget you to rule out possibilities in which today\u2019s temperature\nin Melbourne is over 10\u00b0 C. We can model what my assertion\nconveys, then, as a function that maps possible worlds in which\ntoday\u2019s temperature is under 10\u00b0 C to True and all other\nworlds to False. However, the precise truth-conditions communicated by\nan assertoric use of a sentence depend in part on the conversational\ncontext in which it takes place. Just which temperatures count as\ncold, for instance, depends on shared background assumptions in a\nparticular conversational context: what\u2019s cold in Melbourne is\nmild in Manitoba.\n\nA second guiding idea is that the proposition actually conveyed by the\nassertion of a particular sentence depends on presuppositions\nshared by the participants in the conversation\u2014including\npresuppositions about what particular words represent and\npresuppositions about actual empirical circumstances. If you\u2019re\na Chinese speaker who doesn\u2019t understand anything at all about\nwhat the term \u2018cold\u2019 represents in English, then I cannot\nuse \u2018It\u2019s cold today\u2018 to convey facts about\nMelbourne\u2019s weather. And if you\u2019re a Canadian who\ndoesn\u2019t understand anything about Australian weather conditions,\nyou won\u2019t understand precisely what I am saying to my fellow\nMelburnians when I assert that sentence. Stalnaker calls the set of\npresuppositions that conversational partners treat as common knowledge\nthat they can rely on to get their point across the \u201ccontext\nset\u201d\u2014which he models as the set of possible worlds that\nsatisfy all of these mutual presuppositions. The context set will\nencode shared assumptions about the meaning of words, about general\nempirical facts, about the what\u2019s happened so far in the\nconversation, and so on.\n\nThe goal of assertion, Stalnaker suggests, is to shrink the context\nset. In making an assertion, the speaker tries to get the audience to\naccept a new proposition as one of their shared presuppositions,\nthereby shrinking the set of possible worlds that are considered live\noptions. For instance, in asserting \u2018It\u2019ll be very cold\ntoday\u2019 to a group of Melburnians, I exploit background knowledge\nof local weather conditions in June to get my audience to accept that\nthe temperature outside is somewhere between 5\u201310\u00b0 C, ruling\nout live possibilities that it might be in the 15\u201320\u00b0 C\nrange. If all goes well, further planning will proceed on the basis of\na smaller and more accurate range of possibilities. In contrast, if I\nwere to assert \u2018It\u2019s cold\u2019 to the monolingual\nChinese speaker or to the parochial Canadian, my assertion would be\ndefective, since my audience wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out\nwhich temperatures are ruled out by my assertion.\n\nIdentity claims, however, do not seem to fit this simple model of\nassertion. As Kripke (1980) argued, identities are either necessarily\ntrue or necessarily false. So accepting an identity will either leave\nthe context set unchanged or it will eliminate it altogether. Either\nway, asserting an identity would be pointless. But clearly it is not.\nAsserting an identity such as \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019\ncan be genuinely informative, ruling out empirical possibilities\npreviously taken to be live options. According to the metasemantic\naccount, (i) the goal of assertion can explain why the assertion of a\nnecessary sentence will lead to a reinterpretation of the content of\nthe asserted sentence, and (ii) the 2D framework helps to specify just\nwhich proposition will be conveyed by the sentence within a given\nconversation.\n\nIn general, an identity claim is appropriate when one of the parties\nto a conversation is (partially) ignorant about which object is picked\nout by a name like \u2018Lloyd\u2019. For an externalist like\nStalnaker, this is a case of semantic ignorance. If\nO\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know that \u2018Lloyd\u2019 is\nco-referential with \u2018I.L. Humberstone\u2019, then he does not\nfully understand the semantic rules governing these names: i.e., that\nboth names are associated with a constant function from any possible\nworld to a specific individual. But O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t utterly\nincompetent with the meaning of these terms: he implicitly understands\nboth names as rigid designators, and he has some substantive\nunderstanding of the object each name picks out. For instance, he may\nunderstand that \u2018Lloyd\u2019 refers to the person to whom\nhe\u2019s just been introduced and that \u2018I.L.\nHumberstone\u2019 refers to the author of \u2018Direction of\nFit\u2019. O\u2019Leary\u2019s semantic deficiency\u2014his\nfailure to fully understand the meaning of these names in a\ncontextually appropriate way\u2014is grounded in his ignorance of the\nordinary empirical fact that the man to whom he has been introduced is\nthe author of \u2018Direction of Fit\u2019.\n\n2D matrices can be used to represent this sort of partial semantic\nunderstanding. O\u2019Leary knows that \\(if\\) the man in front of him\nis the author of the famous article, then \u2018Lloyd = I.L.\nHumberstone\u2019 expresses a necessary truth; and he knows that\n\\(if\\) the man in front of him isn\u2019t the author, the sentence\nexpresses a necessary falsehood. What O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know\nis which of these two possibilities corresponds to his actual\nsituation. Call the first possibility i and the\nsecond j. O\u2019Leary\u2019s epistemic situation\ncan then be summed up in a 2D matrix:\n\nO\u2019Leary: \u2018Lloyd = I.L. Humberstone\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\ni\nj \n\ni\nT\nT \n\nj\nF\nF  \n\n\n\nThe matrix is defined only with respect to a specific set of relevant\nalternative possibilities, i and j,\nchosen in such a way as to reflect the\nsubjects\u2019 semantic understanding and our own explanatory\ninterests. The vertical axis represents these possible worlds in their\nrole as contexts of use, which determine the literal semantic\ncontent of the expressions used in them. The horizontal axis\nrepresents those same possible worlds as circumstances of\nevaluation, relative to which we evaluate the truth or falsity of\nthe proposition expressed. Each row of the matrix thus represents a\ndifferent proposition that might be literally expressed by the\nsentence. Stalnaker calls such matrices propositional\nconcepts, since they reflect the subject\u2019s current\nimperfect conception of the meaning of the\n sentence.[22]\n This particular matrix reflects the fact that O\u2019Leary\u2019s\ncurrent epistemic state is compatible with the identity sentence\nexpressing either a necessary truth or a necessary falsehood,\ndepending on empirical facts about the actual context of use.\n\nWhat does O\u2019Leary learn when he comes to accept Daniels\u2019\nassertion of \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019? Since the actual\nworld is like i, the literal semantic content of\nthe asserted sentence is a necessary truth. But necessary truths rule\nout no empirical possibilities whatsoever, so this cannot be the\ninformative proposition that is conveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion.\nMoreover, O\u2019Leary is not in a position to recognize that this is\nthe literal semantic content of the sentence, since he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether the actual world is like i or j.\nThe natural suggestion is that the information\nconveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion is that the real world is like\ni and not j. When O\u2019Leary\naccepts \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019, he will no longer\ntreat the possibility that the man in front of him is not the\nauthor of the famous article as a live option: this empirical\npossibility will be eliminated from his context set. Thus, the\nproposition that seems to be conveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion\ncorresponds to the diagonal intension determined by our 2D matrix for\nthat assertion. Moreover, this observation generalizes: when subjects\nare partially ignorant of the semantic values of their words, the\ndiagonal proposition determined by the propositional concept can\ncapture the empirical information conveyed by the assertion.\n\nBut why is this so? To explain why assertions sometimes express the\ndiagonal proposition, the metasemantic account appeals to rational\nmaxims governing conversational cooperation. The following maxim seems\nto govern the practice of assertion:\n\nThe very same proposition should be expressed relative to every\npossible world in the context set. (Stalnaker 1978, 88)\n\n\nSpeakers should conform to this maxim, because assertion involves an\nintention to get one\u2019s audience to eliminate worlds from the\ncontext set in accordance with the proposition expressed\u2014and in\norder for this intention to succeed the audience must be in a position\nto figure out just which worlds they are being asked to eliminate.\nWhen this sort of rational maxim governing the communication of\ninformation is flouted, the audience will look for a non-standard\ninterpretation of the utterance that would bring it back into\nconformity with the maxims (Grice 1989). [See the entries on\n pragmatics\n and on\n implicature.]\n\nAccording to Stalnaker, this is precisely what is going on in the case\nof identity claims like the one we have been considering.\nDaniels\u2019 assertion of \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019\nclearly flouts the proposed maxim. We can assume that Daniels is aware\nthat O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know whether he is in a world like\ni, where the man to whom he\u2019s been introduced\nis the famous author, or a world like j where they are distinct. Yet\nDaniels utters a sentence that expresses a different proposition\ndepending on whether the actual world is like i or\nlike j. In such circumstances, the audience should\nlook for an alternative interpretation of the assertion.\nDaniels\u2019 assertion can be brought back into conformity with the\nmaxim by re-interpreting it as conveying the proposition expressed by\nthe diagonal of the matrix. At a rough intuitive level, we can say\nthat Daniels is trying to get O\u2019Leary to accept that the\nsentence \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019 expresses a truth.\nBut the 2D framework also allows us to specify more precisely just\nwhat empirical information is conveyed within a given conversational\ncontext. Given O\u2019Leary\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 common\npresuppositions about what the two names represent, Daniels\u2019\nassertion also expresses the proposition that the man to whom\nO\u2019Leary has just been introduced is the author of\n\u2018Direction of Fit\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing, however, that the very same sentence\nasserted in a different conversational context could express an\nentirely different empirical proposition: just which proposition is\nexpressed, on this metasemantic account, depends on what the\nindividual parties to the conversation are currently presupposing\nabout the meanings of the expressions used.\n\nIn recent work, Stalnaker has enriched his notion of a context. In\naddition to a sets of possible worlds, he introduces (i) multiple\ncenters within those worlds representing the participants in a\nconversation, and (ii) accessibility relations among the centers\nrepresenting interlocutors\u2019 ways of identifying each other\n(Stalnaker 2008, 2014). This added structure is intended to capture\nself-locating presuppositions that can help explain what\u2019s\ncommunicated by indexical expressions like \u2018I\u2019,\n\u2018you\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019. For a helpful overview of the\nmotivation for such an approach, see (Ninan 2010a) and for further\ndevelopment of multi-centered accounts of propositional content see\n(Torre 2010, Ninan 2013).\n3.3 Propositional attitudes\n\nThe metasemantic 2D framework was originally developed to explain\ncommunication, but the framework can also be used to specify the\ncontent of certain beliefs and the content of assertions that\nattribute beliefs.\n\nStalnaker (1984) defends a coarse-grained account of belief contents,\nwhich individuates particular belief states in terms of a set of\npossible worlds that would make them true. If this project is to\nsucceed, it must be possible to fully specify beliefs without invoking\nanything like Fregean senses or conceptual structure. But there is an\nimportant class of beliefs that seem to pose insuperable problems for\na simple possible worlds account of their content: beliefs in\nnecessary truths. The problem for a standard possible worlds analysis\nis that all necessary truths have precisely the same content (the\nfunction mapping every world to True). So the belief that Hesperus\n= Phosphorus will have exactly the same content as a belief\nthat Hesperus = Hesperus & Fermat\u2019s last theorem is\ntrue. But these are clearly distinct belief states. Beliefs in\nidentities have been particularly important in motivating theories of\nfiner-grained thought contents.\n\nBut fine-grained Fregean senses or conceptual structures are not\nstrictly required to distinguish beliefs in identities. Stalnaker\n(1981; 1987) argues that the metasemantic 2D framework he developed to\nexplain what is communicated by an assertion of an identity\nsentence can also explain the content of the belief states\nattributed using an identity sentence to specify its content. If\nO\u2019Leary were to notice the pole star and think to himself\nthat\u2019s Mars, for instance, the truth-conditions of his\nthought can be captured by a judiciously defined diagonal proposition\n(Stalnaker 1987, 125). In this case, the worlds we include in the\ncontext set may involve facts about which object is the target of\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s visual attention and facts about salient\nempirical properties he associates with the name \u2018Mars\u2019.\nOn the metasemantic approach, then, the proposition we attribute in\nsaying O\u2019Leary believes that that is Mars is the\nproposition that the visually salient object is the object that has\nthose Martian properties.\n\nA further complication arises in specifying the content of attitude\nattributions. On the metasemantic account of assertion, the content\nconveyed by a sentence depends on the shared presuppositions of the\nspeaker and audience. But sometimes the parties to a discussion are\nbetter informed than the person they are describing. In philosophical\ndiscussions, for instance, it is standardly presupposed that\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 are\nco-referential. So the diagonal intension associated with the sentence\n\u2018Hesperus \\(\\ne\\) Phosphorus\u2019 will be necessarily\nfalse when it\u2019s asserted in philosophical contexts (i.e.,\nit will be false when uttered in any situation compatible with what is\nbeing presupposed in the philosophical conversation). And yet when a\nphilosopher says that O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know that Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, she still manages to communicate that O\u2019Leary\nfails to grasp some contingent empirical proposition. On the face of\nit, the metasemantic account of assertion cannot explain how this is\npossible, since every cell of the metasemantic matrix for the identity\nclaim in this philosophical conversation will be assigned the value\nTrue.\n\nStalnaker\u2019s response to this problem is to suggest that the\ncontext set for a belief report must be expanded so as to include\nworlds that correspond to the way that the believer himself (i.e.\nO\u2019Leary) takes things to be. The diagonal proposition of the\nphilosopher\u2019s sentence is thus determined by considering what\nshe would be saying if her sentence were asserted in contexts\ncompatible with O\u2019Leary\u2019s beliefs (1987; 1988). However,\nthere is no general rule for choosing which worlds are the relevant\nones:\n\nThe procedure I am proposing for extending propositional concepts so\nthat the diagonalization strategy can be applied to problematic belief\nattributions takes examples case by case. It is not, as yet, very\nsatisfactory if we are looking for a systematic way to explain why the\ncomplements of belief attributions denote the propositions that they\nseem to denote. But if, using this procedure, we can find a possible\nworlds proposition that is a plausible candidate to be the object of\nbelief being attributed in the various problematic examples, then\n[\u2026] it will not be completely mysterious how these propositions\ncan be expressed by the sentences that seem to express them.\n(Stalnaker 1987, 129)\n\n\nThus, the metasemantic 2D framework provides adequate descriptive\nresources for characterizing mental states and our discourse about\nthem, without invoking fine-grained Fregean senses, concepts, or\nsyntactic structures. However, the metasemantic theory used to\nconstruct the relevant 2D matrices relies on unsystematic norms of\ncharitable interpretation to identify the precise contents of\nparticular attitudes and attitude reports (Stalnaker 1999b,\n 18\u201319).[23]\n3.4 Metasemantic vs. semantic\n\nThe semantic vs. metasemantic distinction was first drawn by Kaplan\n(1989b, 573\u20136). A semantic theory for a language assigns\nsemantic values (meanings) to particular expressions in the language.\nIn contrast, a metasemantic theory explains why expressions\nhave those semantic values: i.e., what facts about an expression make\nit the case that it has a certain meaning. A semantic theory, for\ninstance, might tell us that the semantic value for \u2018Barack\nObama\u2019 is a 1D intension that maps any possible world to a\nspecific individual, while the semantic value for \u2018I\u2019 is a\n2D intension that maps contexts of use (centered worlds) to a constant\nfunction from any possible world to the individual who is the speaker\nin the context. A metasemantic theory will tell us what makes it the\ncase that these are the correct interpretations of their meaning:\ne.g., the metasemantic theory might appeal to the speaker\u2019s\ndispositions and history, how she is causally connected to her social\nor physical context, the linguistic conventions of the local\nlinguistic community, details about the conversational context, and so\non.\n\nA semantic interpretation of the 2D framework takes the 2D\nframework to specify a semantic value of an expression. Kaplan\u2019s\ntheory of indexicals is a semantic interpretation of the framework, as\nare Jackson\u2019s and Chalmers\u2019 generalized 2D semantics.\nStalnaker calls his own interpretation of the 2D framework a\nmetasemantic one because his 2D matrices reflect general\nprinciples for assigning semantic values (horizontal intensions) to\nexpressions on the basis of empirical facts about their use.\nStalnaker\u2019s 2D matrices thus reflect metasemantic facts about\ninterpretation, not semantic facts about the meanings of specific\nexpressions.\n\nThe metasemantic interpretation of the 2D framework is structurally\ndifferent from semantic interpretations like Jackson\u2019s and\nChalmers\u2019 in a number of important respects. First, on the\nmetasemantic approach, 2D matrices are defined in terms of a\nrestricted set of possible worlds. Metasemantic 2D matrices are\ndefined only with respect to those worlds that are consistent with\nsome relevant set of the subject\u2019s background assumptions. On a\nsemantic interpretation, in contrast, 2D matrices are defined on the\nset of all centered possible worlds.\n\nSecond, just which set of possible worlds is used to construct a\nmetasemantic 2D matrix depends in part on the\ntheorist\u2019s contingent explanatory interests. For\ninstance, Daniels\u2019 current internal state of understanding the\nexpression \u2018Mars\u2019 may be associated with different 2D\nmatrices, depending on whether we are interested in characterizing his\nconversation with O\u2019Leary or in characterizing his thought\nidentifying a speck visible in the night sky as Mars. In many\ncontexts, moreover, we can characterize the content associated with\nDaniels\u2019 internal state without resorting to the 2D apparatus at\nall: e.g., when Daniels asserts \u2018Mars is a planet\u2019 we can\nusually model what he says and thinks in terms of a simple horizontal\nintension. Semantic interpretations of the 2D framework treat the\nintension corresponding to the diagonal of a 2D matrix as fully\ndetermined by the subject\u2019s internal states, whereas on a\nmetasemantic approach which diagonal intension is assigned\u2014or\nwhether a diagonal intension is invoked at all\u2014depends on the\nexplanatory interests of an\n interpreter.[24]\n\nThird, the assignment principle used to fill in a metasemantic 2D\nmatrix for a subject\u2019s words is not beholden to an internalist\naccount of reference-fixing. On a semantic interpretation, 2D matrices\nare filled in on the basis of the subject\u2019s idealized judgments\nabout hypothetical scenarios. But the metasemantic approach is not\ncommitted to relying on the subject\u2019s epistemic judgments to\nfill in 2D matrices: it\u2019s the theorist who must be able\nto assign horizontal intensions to a subject\u2019s words and\nthoughts on the basis of the totality of empirical facts about that\nsubject. Nor should we think of reference-fixing as somehow determined\nby the internal states of the theorist, since even theorists are prone\nto mistakes on externalist accounts of reference-fixing.\n\nFourth, on the metasemantic approach, the basic semantic assignments\nare always horizontal intensions, which reflect the nature of the\nobjects, kinds and properties the subject is thinking and talking\nabout. On a metasemantic account, diagonal intensions represent ad\nhoc reinterpretations that we resort to when the normal\nhorizontal intension for a subject\u2019s sentences or thoughts is\nnecessarily true or necessarily false, and hence makes no substantive\nclaim about the empirical world. Such diagonal intensions, moreover,\nare theoretical abstractions derived from a set of horizontal\nintensions that are compatible with the subject\u2019s partial\nignorance about nature of the objects, kinds, and properties she is\nrepresenting (i.e., her partial ignorance of the horizontal intensions\nfor her words and thoughts). Semantic interpretations of the 2D\nframework, in contrast, treat the intensions picked out by the\ndiagonal of a 2D matrix as basic semantic values in their own\nright.\n\nAs a consequence of these structural features of the metasemantic\ninterpretation, metasemantic diagonal intensions play none of the\nbasic explanatory roles attributed to 1-intensions by proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics. In particular, (i) diagonal intensions do\nnot figure in a compositional semantic theory, (ii) they do not\nreflect stable aspects of linguistic or conceptual competence, and\n(iii) they do not represent apriori accessible reference-fixing\nconditions for the subject\u2019s words or thoughts (Stalnaker 1999b,\n2004 , 2007).\n\nThe metasemantic interpretation use of the 2D framework has come in\nfor criticism on a number of fronts.
