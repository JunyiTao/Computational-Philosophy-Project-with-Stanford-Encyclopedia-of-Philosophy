    "main_text": "Varieties of Perceptual Learning || Differentiation\n2.1 Differentiation\n\nWhen most people reflect on perceptual learning, the cases that tend\nto come to mind are cases of differentiation. In\ndifferentiation, a person comes to perceive the difference between two\nproperties, where they could not perceive this difference before. It\nis helpful to think of William James\u2019 case of a person learning\nto distinguish between the upper and lower half of a particular kind\nof wine. Prior to learning, one cannot perceive the difference between\nthe upper and lower half. However, through practice one becomes able\nto distinguish between the upper and lower half. This is a paradigm\ncase of differentiation.\n\nPsychologists have studied differentiation in lab environments. In one\nsuch study, experimenters took six native Japanese speakers who had\nlived in the United States from between six months and three years\n(Logan, Lively, & Pisoni 1991). The subjects were not native English speakers. The\nexperimenters found that they were able to train these subjects to\nbetter distinguish between the phonemes /r/ and /l/. This is a case of\nimproved differentiation, where the subjects became better at\nperceiving the difference between two properties, which they had more\ntrouble telling apart before.\n",
