    "main_text": "The Reduction Thesis and Brentano\u2019s Logic Reform\n5. The Theory of Double Judgements\n\nWhen one reads the first edition of Brentano\u2019s\nPsychology, the reduction thesis appears to be the backbone\nof Brentano\u2019s theory of judgement. But that is in fact not so.\nIn the second edition (1911) Brentano added several appendices, one of\nwhich is entitled \u201cOn genuine and fictitious objects\u201d (PES\nappendix ix). Here Brentano recapitulates his theory of judgement and\nturns his back on the reduction thesis. Neither is it true, Brentano\nnow says, that all categorical propositions can be transformed without\nchange of meaning into existential propositions. Nor is it true that\nall judgements are of existential form.\n\nIt takes a careful reading to fully appreciate the significance of\nBrentano\u2019s change of mind. While the change is dramatic, it does\nnot undermine Brentano\u2019s theory completely. On the contrary. All\nof the following claims still remain in place: in perception we make\nsimple existential judgements by affirming or rejecting an object that\nwe perceive (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1,\n 413]);[24]\n categorical propositions can be equivalent with existential\npropositions (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]; existential propositions\ncan express concepts with a complex subject matter (ibid.). While\nthese claims all remain unchanged, what Brentano gives up is the idea\nof uniformity in the realm of judgement. That is what Brentano\u2019s\nanti-reduction turn comes to:\n\nAnti-reduction\nIt is false that all judgements can be given a uniform\npsychological treatment.\n\n\nWhy did Brentano turn away from a unified theory of judgement?\nConsider first a line of reasoning that Brentano may have used in one\nof his\n lectures:[25]\n\n\n[\u2026] since Aristotle, the categorical form has been considered\nas the basic form of judgement, while the other doctrine that the\nbasic form of judgement is the existential form emerged only in recent\ntimes. Yet there can be no doubt that the absolute majority of our\njudgements take the form \u201cA is B\u201d, not the existential\nform, and that the Aristotelian logic made the right decision to\nground its logical developments on that form [of judgement]. This\napparent contradiction we must try to resolve. (LRU 113f., author\ntranslation)\n\n\nWhether it was Hillebrand or Brentano who made the point, it is a very\ngood question: Why should one bother to reduce categorical to\nexistential judgements, if most of our judgements are expressed in\ncategorical form? That is to say: Why not take such propositions at\nface value instead of claiming that language disguises the nature of\nour judgements?\n\nHowever, there is also a good answer to this question. We usually do\nnot make simple judgements, but what Brentano now calls \u201cdouble\njudgements\u201d, and in order to express such judgements we make use\nof the categorical form. In a double-judgement one affirms the\nexistence of some object and then adds a second judgement that\npresupposes that the first judgement has been made.\n\nThe novel idea here is that judgements become more complex when they\nare built up in three steps: First one presents an object\nS and acknowledges its existence. Then one presents a\nproperty P and identifies P with the object\nS in thought that one has acknowledged, and finally one\nacknowledges S with the addition of [mit der Zugabe]\nP. (see PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413]\n\nWhat is it to identify P with S in thought? Brentano\ntells us that identification is not a kind of judgement and that the\nresult of an identification is a presentation (PES 317, [II\n 206]).[26]\n A natural way to understand Brentano is to think of identification as\na way of forming complex presentations. Brentano seems mainly to have\nconjunction in mind. We can conjoin the presentation of [warm] and\n[round] to the presentation of [something warm & round].\nConjunction is here a primitive operation on presentations that is\nindependent of\n judgement.[27]\n\nBut what is the point of this complication? Why does Brentano not\nstick with the simpler two-step procedure that we are already familiar\nwith: first, one combines S and P in an act of\npresentation, prior to making any judgement, and then one acknowledges\n\u201cS-that-is-P\u201d as a complex object? Is\nthere a special way of identifying S and P which\npresupposes that the object S has to be acknowledged before\nsuch an identification can be\n made?[28]\n\nDemonstrative judgements are a good case to support Brentano\u2019s\nnew idea:\n\n\nA sentence of the form \u201cThat thing is P\u201d\nexpresses a double judgement consisting of (i) an acknowledgement of\nthe object picked out by the demonstrative \u201cthat thing\u201d\nand (ii) the conjoining of the idea [That] and [P] (read as\n\u201cthe thing which is that and P\u201d and (iii) an\nacknowledgement of the thing which is that and P.\n\n\nThe formulation of the second judgement must be chosen with care. One\nwould miss Brentano\u2019s point, if one took the second judgement to\nhave as content \u201cthat the thing just acknowledged is\nP\u201d. Acknowledging an object and judging that one\nacknowledges it are not the same thing. Therefore, one could make the\nlatter judgement without actually making the first affirmation. That\nis ruled out if one describes the second judgement as affirming of\nthat thing that has been acknowledged, that it is P.\nOnly thus one capture\u2019s Brentano idea that in a double-judgement\nthe second judgement is inseparable from the first: one can affirm\nsomething of an object only after one has actually affirmed its\nexistence (see PES 296 [II 165; SVS 1,\n 414]).[29]\n\nAnother possible misunderstanding is worth mentioning at this point.\nWe have earlier seen that Brentano, like Frege, distinguishes\npredication from judgement. Now it may seem that Brentano backtracks\non this agreement. On his new theory it seems that predication occurs\nwhen one affirms P of S, which means when one judges\nof S that it is P. But Brentano does not backtrack\non this point. He still holds that predication occurs prior to and\nindependently of judging. That is what the three-step process in a\ndouble-judgement guarantees: after acknowledging S, one must\nfirst identify P with S, i.e., predicate P\nof S, before one can judge that S is P,\ni.e., acknowledge S in conjunction with P.\n\nLet us now turn to a second line of reasoning with which Brentano\nmotivates his new theory. This line involves a thorough\nreconsideration of the categorical propositions of traditional logic.\nFollowing the model of singular propositions just elaborated, Brentano\nsuggests that propositions of the I-form and the O-form also express\ndouble-judgements:\n\n\nLooked at more closely [\u2026a judgement of the form \u201cSome\nS is P\u201d] signifies a double judgement\n(Doppelurteil), one part of which acknowledges the\nsubject, and, after the predicate has been identified in presentation\nwith the subject, the other part acknowledges the subject which had\nbeen acknowledged all by itself by the first part, but with this\naddition\u2014which is to say it ascribes to it the predicate\nP. (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413], translation amended)\n\n\nLikewise, the O-form \u201cSome S is not\nP\u201d:\n\n\nconsists of the acknowledgement of S, and this is the basic\nconstituent of the double judgements. The second part relates to it\nand presupposes it in such a way as to be inseparable from it. And\nthis second part is negative: it does not [\u2026] ascribe an\nattribute to the S, [\u2026] but rather denies one of it.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nWhat is the rationale behind these claims? It is obviously no\ncoincidence that Brentano makes them in the context of discussing the\ndistinction between genuine and fictitious objects. This distinction\nbecomes important for him because judgements are intentional mental\nacts, and as such they can be both about real things or about\ninventions of our own minds. These invented or\n\u201cfictitious\u201d objects can be of various kinds. We may\ninvent something in hallucination or by imagining it in our dreams,\nlike a magical island, or we may read about a mythological figure\ndescribed in a story, like Pegasus, or we may invent non-existing\nobjects by our way of speaking or as part of a metaphysical\ntheory.\n\nIn the present context, Brentano is concerned particularly with\nfictitious objects invented by language or metaphysics: he calls them\n\u201cnegatives\u201d, since they are denoted by negative terms\nwhich may occur either in the subject-position or the\npredicate-position of a categorical proposition. Such terms are\nregularly used in common language when one speaks of an\n\u201cunintelligent man\u201d, or an \u201cunattractive\nthing\u201d (PES 298 [II 169; SVS 1,\n 417].[30]\n Or they may be introduced by artificial terms like \u201ca non-white\nthing\u201d or a \u201cnon-human\u201d. Brentano denies that such\nterms actually have a denotative function and denote something that\ncould be made an object of judgement. The following consideration may\nbe taken as supporting Brentano\u2019s point: When we count the\nproperties of an object, only genuine properties should count. The\nproperties of a flower may include being red and being a rose; but in\naddition to that the rose does not also have the further properties of\nbeing not-black and being not a daisy. It is of course correct to\nsay that the flower is neither black nor a daisy, but in\nsaying this one does not ascribe negative properties to it. One simply\ndenies that it has the properties of being black and being a daisy.\nThat is why Brentano insists that negation belongs to the mode of\njudgement, not to its content (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n\nBrentano requires from a theory of judgement that it stays away from\npostulating fictitious entities of any kind. In this respect his\nearlier analysis of propositions of the O-form and the A-form turns\nout to be deficient. His claim about the O-form was that in judging\nthat S is not P, one affirms the existence of an\nS-that-is-not-P. That conflicts with his restriction\nagainst negative properties because when one affirms a complex like\nS-that-is-not-P, one affirms all of its parts (see\nPES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]). Thus, in affirming an\nS-that-is-not-P, one would affirm not only the\nentire complex, but also both of its \u201cparts\u201d: S\nand not-P. Note that the problem cannot be solved by joining\nthe negation with the copula \u201cis\u201d, because the copula\nindicates the quality of the judgement and propositions of the O-form\nexpress positive judgements according to Brentano.\n\nThe way out of this problem is provided by Brentano\u2019s theory of\ndouble-judgement. On the new analysis, judgements of the O-form are\npartially positive and partially negative. They affirm the existence\nof the subject S, and then deny the predicate P of\nthat subject. Now the negation belongs to the mode of judgement, not\nto its subject matter.\n\nBrentano considers this new analysis to provide a further insight into\nthe way how language disguises the nature of\n judgement.[31]\n Obviously, we cannot read off from the linguistic expression whether\na given proposition expresses a simple or a double-judgement. It takes\nthe scalpel of a philosopher to figure this out. In some cases,\nhowever, no decision may be reached. Then Brentano advises us to\nconsider the proposition to be homonymous. This seems to be the proper\nverdict with propositions of the I-form. They can be interpreted\neither as expressing a simple judgement (\u201can SP exists\u201d)\nor a double-judgement (\u201can S exists and that S\nis P\u201d) (see LRU 114, and Hillebrand 1891: 98).\n\nA further ambiguity of this kind arises in the case of propositions of\nthe E-form (\u201cNo S is P\u201d). Their explicit\nnegative quality speaks against an interpretation that takes them to\nexpress a double-judgement like propositions of the\n O-form.[32]\n Brentano therefore ventures another idea what these propositions\nexpress: judgements of higher-order or\n\u201cmeta-judgements\u201d:\n\n\nAnyone who says, \u201cNo S is P\u201d is thinking\nof someone judging that \u201cAn S is P\u201d, and\ndeclaring that in thinking of him in this way he is thinking of\nsomeone who judges incorrectly. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416])\n\n\nBrentano here exploits the principle that judgements of the E-form\ncontradict judgements of the I-form. Denying that someone judges\ncorrectly that S is P, therefore means to judge that\nno S is P. Likewise, Brentano exploits the principle\nthat A-judgements contradict O-judgements when he says that\npropositions of the A-form also express meta-judgements:\n\n\nIf the O-form means the double-judgement \u201cThere is an S\nand it is not P\u201d, then the proposition \u201cEvery\nS is P,\u201d says that anyone who makes both of\nthose judgements is judging falsely. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1,\n416])\n\n\nIn this way, Brentano again manages to satisfy the restriction on\nnegative properties. His earlier theory takes propositions of the\nA-form to express simple existential judgement. Brentano now considers\nthat to be a mistake because it introduces the complex\nS-that-is-not-P, which includes the negative part\n\u201cnot-P\u201d. Again, the \u201cnot\u201d here cannot be taken\nas an indicator of the quality of the judgement, since one would then\ndeny the existence of an S-that-is P. With\npropositions of the E-form this problem does not arise. In this case,\ntwo interpretations are admissible, which makes \u201cNo S\nis P\u201d an ambiguous proposition: it either expresses the\nsimple negative existential judgement that no\nS-that-is-P exists, or the higher-order judgement\nthat someone who accepts an S-that-is-P judges\nincorrectly.\n\nIn sum, Brentano\u2019s theory of double-judgement shows why a\nreduction of all categorical propositions to existential judgements is\n impossible.[33]\n On the other hand, there is no way for Brentano of reducing\nexistential propositions to propositions expressing double-judgements.\nBrentano is therefore forced to abandon the project of giving a\nuniform treatment of all judgements within the constraints of his\n theory.[34]\n",
