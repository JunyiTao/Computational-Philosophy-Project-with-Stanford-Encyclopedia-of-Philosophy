    "main_text": "The Theistic Proofs || The arguments of the Monologion\n2.2 The arguments of the Monologion\n\nHaving clarified what Anselm takes himself to be doing in his theistic\nproofs, we can now examine the proofs themselves. In the first chapter\nof the Monologion Anselm argues that there must be some one\nthing that is supremely good, through which all good things have their\ngoodness. For whenever we say that different things are F in\ndifferent degrees, we must understand them as being F through\nF-ness; F-ness itself is the same in each of them.\nThus, for example, all more or less just things \u201cmust be more or\nless just through justice, which is not different in diverse\nthings\u201d (M 1). Now we speak of things as being\ngood in different degrees. So by the principle just stated,\nthese things must be good through some one thing. Clearly that thing\nis itself a great good, since it is the source of the goodness of all\nother things. Moreover, that thing is good through itself;\nafter all, if all good things are good through that thing, it follows\ntrivially that that thing, being good, is good through itself. Things\nthat are good through another (i.e., things whose goodness derives\nfrom something other than themselves) cannot be equal to or greater\nthan the good thing that is good through itself, and so that which is\ngood through itself is supremely good. Anselm concludes,\n\u201cNow that which is supremely good is also supremely great. There\nis, therefore, some one thing that is supremely good and supremely\ngreat \u2013 in other words, supreme among all existing things\u201d\n(M 1). In chapter 2 he applies the principle of chapter 1 in\norder to derive (again) the conclusion that there is something\nsupremely great.\n\nIn chapter 3 Anselm argues that all existing things exist through some\none thing. Every existing thing, he begins, exists either through\nsomething or through nothing. But of course nothing exists through\nnothing, so every existing thing exists through something. There is,\nthen, either some one thing through which all existing things exist,\nor there is more than one such thing. If there is more than one,\neither (i) they all exist through some one thing, or (ii) each of them\nexists through itself, or (iii) they exist through each other. (iii)\nmakes no sense. If (ii) is true, then \u201cthere is surely some one\npower or nature of self-existing that they have in order to exist\nthrough themselves\u201d (M 3); in that case, \u201call\nthings exist more truly through that one thing than through the\nseveral things that cannot exist without that one thing\u201d\n(M 3). So (ii) collapses into (i), and there is some one\nthing through which all things exist. That one thing, of course,\nexists through itself, and so it is greater than all the other things.\nIt is therefore \u201cbest and greatest and supreme among all\nexisting things\u201d (M 3).\n\nIn chapter 4 Anselm begins with the premise that things \u201care not\nall of equal dignity; rather, some of them are on different and\nunequal levels\u201d (M 4). For example, a horse is better\nthan wood, and a human being is more excellent than a horse. Now it is\nabsurd to think that there is no limit to how high these levels can\ngo, \u201cso that there is no level so high that an even higher level\ncannot be found\u201d (M 4). The only question is how many\nbeings occupy that highest level of all. Is there just one, or are\nthere more than one? Suppose there are more than one. By hypothesis,\nthey must all be equals. If they are equals, they are equals through\nthe same thing. That thing is either identical with them or distinct\nfrom them. If it is identical with them, then they are not in fact\nmany, but one, since they are all identical with some one thing. On\nthe other hand, if that thing is distinct from them, then they do not\noccupy the highest level after all. Instead, that thing is greater\nthan they are. Either way, there can be only one being occupying the\nhighest level of all.\n\nAnselm concludes the first four chapters by summarizing his\nresults:\n\nTherefore, there is a certain nature or substance or essence who\nthrough himself is good and great and through himself is what he is;\nthrough whom exists whatever truly is good or great or anything at\nall; and who is the supreme good, the supreme great thing, the supreme\nbeing or subsistent, that is, supreme among all existing things.\n(M 4)\n\n\nHe then goes on (in chapters 5\u201365) to derive the attributes that\nmust belong to the being who fits this description. But before we look\nat Anselm\u2019s understanding of the divine attributes, we should\nturn to the famous proof in the Proslogion.\n",
