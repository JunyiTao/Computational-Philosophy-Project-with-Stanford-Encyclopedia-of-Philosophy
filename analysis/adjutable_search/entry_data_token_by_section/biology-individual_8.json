From Physiological to Evolutionary Individuals: Life, Reproduction, and Agency\n\nSection 3\n indicated that John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry drew\nexplicitly on the concept of living organisms in\ncharacterizing the chief theme of their influential work on the major\ntransitions in the history of life. However, reflection on organisms\nas living agents generally has been backgrounded in work concentrating\non evolutionary individuals. This is perhaps for the obvious reason\nthat many evolutionary individuals\u2014including genes, lineages,\nand clades\u2014are not themselves living things. Yet physiological\nindividuals are paradigms of living agents and a more complete sense\nof the conceptual space that biological individuals occupy calls for\nsome discussion of life, including the roles that an appeal to life\ncycles and agency play in characterizing physiological individuals.\n\n",
