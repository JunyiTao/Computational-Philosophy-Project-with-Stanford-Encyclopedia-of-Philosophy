Late Nineteenth-Century Debates: Weismann and Hertwig\n\nIn 1899, American biologist William Morton Wheeler suggested that\nthere are just two different kinds of thinkers. Some see change and\nprocess, while others see stability. Heraclitus, Aristotle,\nphysiology, and epigenesis characterize one way of looking at the\nworld, while Parmenides, Plato, morphology, and preformationism\ncharacterizes another. These are, Wheeler felt, stable and persistent\nclasses, with just the nature and details of their differences\nchanging over time. Yet by the end of the nineteenth century, he\nargued, neither a strict preformationist nor a strict epigeneticist\nshould prevail. Rather he called for a middle ground, for:\n\n\nThe pronounced \u201cepigenecist\u201d of to-day who postulates\nlittle or no pre-determination in the germ must gird himself to\nperform Herculean labors in explaining how the complex heterogeneity\nof the adult organism can arise from chemical enzymes, while the\npronounced \u201cpreformationist\u201d of to-day is bound to\nelucidate the elaborate morphological structure which he insists must\nbe present in the germ.\n\n\nFurthermore, it is not to philosophy but to science that we must look\nto resolve the relative contributions of each, for \u201cBoth\ntendencies will find their correctives in investigation\u201d\n(Wheeler 1899: 284).\n\nWheeler was stimulated by recent late nineteenth-century debates,\nthemselves provoked by a flood of new discoveries. August Weismann and\nOscar Hertwig provided particularly strong and contrasting positions.\nWeismann had begun from an epigenetic viewpoint and initially rejected\nthe idea that individual form emerges through the unfolding, or\nevolution, of pre-existent form in the inherited germ. But by the time\nhis Das Keimplasm appeared in 1892 (translated into English\nin 1893), Weismann had changed his mind. As Weismann wrote:\n\n\nMy doubts as to the validity of Darwin\u2019s theory were for a long\ntime not confined to this point alone: the assumption of the existence\nof preformed constituents of all parts of the body seemed to me far\ntoo easy a solution of the difficult, besides entailing an\nimpossibility in the shape of an absolutely inconceivable aggregation\nof primary constituents. I therefore endeavoured to see if it were not\npossible to imagine that the germ-plasm, though of complex structure,\nwas not composed of such an immense number of particles, and that its\nfurther complication arose subsequently in the course of development.\nIn other words, what I sought was a substance from which the whole\norganism might arise by epigenesis, and not by evolution. After\nrepeated attempts in which I more than once imagined myself\nsuccessful, but all of which broke down when further tested by facts.\nI finally became convinced that an epigenetic development is an\nimpossibility. Moreover, I found an actual proof of the reality of\nevolution, which \u2026 is so simple that I can scarcely understand\nhow it was possible that it should have escaped my notice so long.\n(Weismann 1892 [1893: xiii\u2013xiv])\n\n\nHis \u201cproof\u201d provided an account of how, within the context\nof cell theory and given that the entire body begins in one fertilized\ncell, all the diverse body parts can become so diversely\ndifferentiated. The key is in the special material of the germ cells,\nWeismann decided. Within these cells lies all the determinants\nnecessary to direct development. Inheritance, that is, causes\ndevelopment and differentiation.\n\nWeismann\u2019s theory postulated the existence of several levels of\nhypothetical units. By the 1890s, it was agreed that individuals begin\nas cells, those cells contain nuclei, and that nuclei contain\nchromosomes. The chromosomes are the material of heredity, Weismann\npostulated, and they consist of a string of determinants, correlated\nwith characters in the organism. Each determinant consisted of a\nnumber of material particles called biophores, inherited from both\nparents. These biophores compete with each other and some prevail,\nwhich then determines the character of the determinant, which in turn\ndetermines the character of the organism. During each cell division,\nthe original whole chromosomal material is divided up, so that the\neffect is like a mosaic. Each cell becomes the right type just because\nof the action of the determinants distributed to it. As Weismann put\nit,\n\n\nOntogeny, or the development of the individual, depends therefore on a\nseries of gradual qualitative changes in the nuclear substance of the\negg-cell.\n\n\nCells are self-differentiating\n\n\nthat is to say, the fate of the cells is determined by forces situated\nwithin them, and not by external influences. (Weismann 1892 [1893: 32,\n134])\n\n\nConditions external to the cell itself cannot guide development, but\nrather the causes lie within. And cell differentiations that make up\ncomplex organisms are predetermined. Frederick Churchill\u2019s\nmagnificent biography of Weismann discusses these ideas in depth\n(Churchill 2015).\n\nOscar Hertwig disagreed. He felt that Weismann made too many\nassumptions and actually provided no real explanation of development\nand differentiation at all. In his work of 1894, Pr\u00e4formation\noder Epigenese, Hertwig complained that Weismann\u2019s\ntheory:\n\n\nmerely transfers to an invisible region the solution of a problem that\nwe are trying to solve, at least partially, by investigation of\nvisible characters; and in the invisible region it is impossible to\napply the methods of science. So, by its very nature, it is barren to\ninvestigation, as there is no means by which investigation may be put\nto the proof. In this respect it is like its predecessor, the theory\nof preformation of the eighteenth century. (Hertwig 1894 [1900:\n140])\n\n\nIn contrast to Weismann\u2019s preformationism, Hertwig pointed to\nthe interactions of cells and to the differences among cells for the\nsource of differentiation. Complexity is not built in from the\nbeginning, but emerges over time, dynamically, and interactively. A\ncytologist himself, Hertwig saw the intricate structures already part\nof the unfertilized egg, and the changes that occur with\nfertilization. The egg is not a completely unstructured blob, but\nrather a complex of different materials that can respond to influences\nboth within the egg and from the external environment. Cells behave\nlike small organisms, and it is the interactions of these separate\norganisms that makes the whole. As Hertwig put it:\n\n\nI shall explain the gradual, progressive organization of the whole\norganism as due to the influences upon each other of these numerous\nelementary organisms in each stage of the development. I cannot regard\nthe development of any creature as a mosaic work. I hold that all the\nparts develop in connection with each other, the development of each\npart always being dependent upon the development of the whole.\n\n\nFurthermore,\n\n\nduring the course of development, there are forces external to the\ncells that bid them assume the individual characters appropriate to\ntheir individual relations to the whole; the determining forces are\nnot within the cells, as the doctrine of determinants supposed.\n(Hertwig 1894 [1900: 105\u2013106, 138])\n\n\nHertwig and Weismann continued to argue, as did others, both about the\nmetaphysical nature of the organism as well as about the\nepistemological demands for gaining knowledge about it, with no\ngenerally accepted way to resolve the issues. Given the information at\nhand, it seemed that Wheeler was right. There were just two different\ntypes of people, drawing on two different sets of values and emphases.\nBoth relied on assumptions, and only new evidence could move the\ndiscussion forward.\n",
