    "main_text": "Evil-Skepticism Versus Evil-Revivalism || Arguments in Favor of the Concept of Evil\n1.4 Arguments in Favor of the Concept of Evil\n\nSome people believe that we should not abandon the concept of evil\nbecause only the concept of evil can capture the moral significance of\nacts, characters, and events such as sadistic torture, serial killers,\nHitler, and the Holocaust. As Daniel Haybron puts it \u201cPrefix\nyour adjectives [such as \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019]\nwith as many \u2018very\u2019s as you like; you still fall short.\nOnly \u2018evil\u2019, it seems, will do\u201d (Haybron 2002b,\n260). According to this line of argument, it is hard to deny that evil\nexists; and if evil exists, we need a concept to capture this immoral\nextreme. Eve Garrard and David McNaughton argue similarly that the\nconcept of evil captures a distinct part of our moral phenomenology,\nspecifically, \u201ccollect[ing] together those wrongful actions to\nwhich we have ... a response of moral horror\u201d (Garrard and\nMcNaughton 2012, 13\u201317).\n\nA second argument in favour of the concept of evil is that it is only\nby facing evil, i.e., by becoming clear about its nature and origins,\nthat we can hope to prevent future evils from occurring and live good\nlives (Kekes 1990, Card 2010).\n\nA third reason to keep the concept of evil is that categorizing\nactions and practices as evil helps to focus our limited energy and\nresources. If evils are the worst sorts of moral wrongs, we should\nprioritize the reduction of evil over the reduction of other wrongs\nsuch as unjust inequalities. For instance, Card believes that it is\nmore important to prevent the evils of domestic violence than it is to\nensure that women and men are paid equal wages for equal work (Card\n2002, 96\u2013117).\n\nA fourth reason not to abandon the concept of evil is that by\ncategorizing actions and practices as evil we are better able to set\nlimits to legitimate responses to evil. By having a greater\nunderstanding of the nature of evil we are better able to guard\nagainst responding to evil with further evils (Card 2010,\n7\u20138).\n",
