    "main_text": "\n\nAgent-based models (ABMs) are computational models that simulate\nbehavior of individual agents in order to study emergent phenomena at\nthe level of the community. Depending on the application, agents may\nrepresent humans, institutions, microorganisms, and so forth. The\nagents\u2019 actions are based on autonomous decision-making and\nother behavioral traits, implemented through formal rules. By\nsimulating decentralized local interactions among agents, as well as\ninteractions between agents and their environment, ABMs enable us to\nobserve complex population-level phenomena in a controlled and gradual\nmanner.\n\nThis entry focuses on the applications of agent-based modeling in the\nphilosophy of science, specifically within the realm of formal social\nepistemology of science. The questions examined through these models\nare typically of direct relevance to philosophical discussions\nconcerning social aspects of scientific inquiry. Yet, many of these\nquestions are not easily addressed using other methods since they\nconcern complex dynamics of social phenomena. After providing a brief\nbackground on the origins of agent-based modeling in philosophy of\nscience\n (Section 1),\n the entry introduces the method and its applications as follows. We\nbegin by surveying the central research questions that have been\nexplored using ABMs, aiming to show why this method has been\nof interest in philosophy of science\n (Section 2).\n Since each research question can be approached through various\nmodeling frameworks, we next delve into some of the common frameworks\nutilized in philosophy of science to show how ABMs tackle\nphilosophical problems\n (Section 3).\n Subsequently, we revisit the previously surveyed questions and\nexamine the insights gained through ABMs, addressing what has\nbeen found to answer each question\n (Section 4).\n Finally, we turn to the epistemology of agent-based modeling and the\nunderlying epistemic function of ABMs\n (Section 5).\n Given the often highly idealized nature of ABMs, we examine which\nepistemic roles support the models\u2019 capacity to engage with\nphilosophical issues, whether for exploratory or explanatory goals.\nThe entry concludes by offering an outlook on future research\ndirections in the field\n (Section 6).\n\nSince the literature on agent-based modeling of science is vast and\ngrowing, it is impossible to give an exhaustive survey of models\ndeveloped on this topic. Instead, this entry aims to provide a\nsystematic overview by focusing on paradigmatic examples of ABMs\ndeveloped in philosophy of science, with an eye to their relevance\nbeyond the confines of formal social epistemology.\n",
