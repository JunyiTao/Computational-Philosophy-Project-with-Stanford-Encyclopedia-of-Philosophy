    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Units of Evolutionary Transition\n3.5 Units of Evolutionary Transition\n\nIn our preceding discussions of units of selection, we have restricted\nourselves to situations in which the various units were\npre-established entities. Our approach has been synchronic, one in\nwhich the relevant units, be they genes, organisms, or populations,\nare the same both before and after a given evolutionary process.\nHowever, not all evolutionary processes may be able to be captured\nunder such a perspective. In particular, recent discussions regarding\nso-called \u201cevolutionary transitions\u201d present a unique\ncomplication to the debates over units and levels of selection.\n\nEvolutionary transition is \u201cthe process that creates\nnew levels of biological organization\u201d (Griesemer 2000c:\n69), such as the origins of chromosomes,\nmulticellularity, eukaryotes, and social groups (Maynard-Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995: 6\u20137). These transitions all share a\ncommon feature, namely that \u201centities that were capable of\nindependent replication before the transition can replicate only as\npart of a larger whole after it\u201d (Maynard-Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995: 6).\n\nEvolutionary transitions create new potential levels and units of\nselection by creating new kinds of entities that can have variances in\nfitness. Thus, it is the \u201cproject of a theory of evolutionary\ntransition to explain the evolutionary origin of entities with such\ncapacities\u201d (Griesemer 2000c: 70). However, since such cases involve the evolutionary\norigin of a given level of selection, traditional synchronic\napproaches to units and levels of selection, which assume the\npre-existence of a \u201chierarchy of entities that are\npotential candidates for units of selection\u201d, may be\ninsufficient, since it is the evolution of those very properties that\nallow entities to serve as, for example, interactors or replicators\nthat is being addressed (Griesemer 2000c: 70). Such a task requires a\ndiachronic perspective, one under which the properties of our\ncurrently extant units of selection cannot be presupposed. \n\n\n\u2026[A]s long as evolutionary theory concerns the function of\ncontemporary units at fixed levels of the biological\nhierarchy\u2026, the functionalist approach may be adequate to its\nintended task. However, if a philosophy of units is to address\nproblems going beyond this scope\u2014for example to problems of\nevolutionary transition,\u2026 then a different approach is\nneeded. (Griesemer 2003: 174)\n\n\nThe \u201creproducer\u201d concept (discussed in\n section 2.2),\n which incorporates the notion of development into the treatment of\nunits and levels of selection, is a step toward meeting the goal of\naddressing such evolutionary transitions, and \n\n\nthe dependency of formerly independent replicators on the\n\u201creplication\u201d of the wholes\u2014the basis for the\ndefinition of evolutionary transition \u2026 is a\ndevelopmental dependency that should be incorporated into the\nanalysis of units. (2000c: 75) \n\n\nThose adopting the reproducer concept argue that thinking in broader\nterms of reproducers avoids the presupposition of evolved coding\nmechanisms implicit to the concept of replicators. In the case of\nevolutionary transitions, this allows us to separate the basic\ndevelopment involved in the origin of a new biological level from the\nlater evolution of sophisticated developmental mechanisms for the\n\u201cstabilization and maintenance of a new level of\nreproduction\u201d (Griesemer 2000c: 77).\n\nExplaining evolutionary transitions in Darwinian terms poses a\nparticular challenge: \u201cWhy was it advantageous for the\nlower-level units to sacrifice their individuality and form themselves\ninto a corporate body?\u201d (Okasha 2006: 218). On one analysis,\nthree stages of such a transition, each defined in terms of the\nconnection between fitness at the level of the collective and the\nindividual fitness of its component particles, are identified (Okasha\n2006: 238). Initially, collective fitness is simply defined as average\nparticle fitness. As fitness at the two levels begins to be decoupled,\ncollective fitness remains proportional to average particle fitness,\nbut is not defined by it; at such a stage, \u201cthe emerging\ncollective lacks \u2018individuality\u2019, and has no\ncollective-level functions of its own\u201d (Okasha 2006: 237).\nFinally, collective fitness \u201cstarts to depend on the\nfunctionality of the collective itself\u201d (Okasha 2006:\n237\u20138; see Okasha 2015 for a representation of this in terms of\ncausal graphs).\n\nOn this analysis, the different stages of an evolutionary transition\ninvolve different conceptions of multi-level selection (Okasha 2006,\n2015). Using the distinction defended by Lorraine Heisler and John\nDamuth (Heisler & Damuth 1987; Damuth & Heisler 1988) in their\n\u201ccontextual analysis\u201d of units of selection, this analysis\nclaims that early on in the process of an evolutionary transition,\nmulti-level selection 1 (MLS1), in which the particles themselves are\nthe \u201c\u2018focal\u2019 units\u201d upon which selection\ndirectly acts, applies. However, by the end of the transition, both\nthe collectives and the particles are focal units of selection\nprocesses, with independent fitnesses, a case of Damuth and\nHeisler\u2019s multi-level selection 2 (MLS2) (Okasha 2006: 4). An\neasy way to capture this distinction is that, under MLS1, the lower\nlevel particles are the interactors as well as the replicators, while\nin MLS2, both the upper level collectives as well as the particles are\ninteractors. Thus, the issues surrounding evolutionary transitions\ninvolve both the interactor question and the replicator question.\nUnderstanding evolutionary transitions hence provides additional\nsignificance to Damuth and Heisler\u2019s distinction: \n\n\nRather than simply describing selection processes of different sorts,\nwhich should be kept separate in the interests of conceptual clarity,\nMLS1 and MLS2 represent different temporal stages of an\nevolutionary transition. (Okasha 2006: 239)\n\n\nOn a different approach, evolutionary transitions are seen as the\nappearance of a \u201cnew kind of Darwinian population\u201d, of\n\u201cnew entities that can enter into Darwinian processes in their\nown right\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 122). These transitions involve\na \u201cde-Darwinizing\u201d of the lower-level entities such that\n\n\n\nan initial collective has come to engage in definite high-level\nreproduction, and this has involved the curtailing of independent\nevolution at the lower level. (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124) \n\n\nThis can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as through the\nbottleneck caused by the production of new collectives from single\nindividuals, coupled with germ-line segregation (as in the transitions\nto multicellularity), or by a single member of the collective\npreventing all other members from reproducing (for example, among\neusocial insects), or by single member having primary but not total\ncontrol over the other constituents (as in the evolution of\neukaryotes) (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 123\u2013124).\n\nThese processes all involve restrictions on the ability of the\nlower-level entities to function as interactors and replicators, and\nthe emergence of upper-level collectives as both interactors and\nreplicators. The degree to which lower-level entities are thus\nrestricted can vary. For example, somatic cells are still capable of\nbearing individual fitness, of outcompeting neighboring cells, and of\nproducing more progeny. Thus, they are not yet\n\u201cpost-populational\u201d; they \u201cretain crucial Darwinian\nfeatures in their own right\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 126). However,\nthey are dependent on the germ-line cells for the propagation of new\ncollectives, and thus their ability to act as replicators is\nnecessarily curtailed. Thus, in order to prevent subversion and\nencourage cooperation, such a transition requires both the\n\u201cgeneration of benefit\u201d and the\n\u201calignment of reproductive interests\u201d\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124, with terminology from Calcott 2008; see\nBooth\u2019s 2014 analysis of heterokaryotic Fungi using\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s approach). For example, in the case of\nmulticellularity, the latter can be accomplished by \u201cclose\nkinship within the collective\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124).\n\nIn a useful analysis of the volvocine algae, other hierarchical\nselectionists use optimality modeling at the group level to search for\na group level adaptation, in aid of modeling evolutionary transitions\n(Shelton & Michod 2014b). They look for selection and adaptation\nat the higher level in their model of transition, which contrasts\nother views that look only for selection at the higher level, but not\nfor engineering adaptations. The emphasis is on the distinction\nbetween fortuitous group benefit and real group adaptation. In places,\nhowever, they seem to embrace the product-of-selection definition of\ngroup adaptation, even though they are committed to denying its\napplicability (2014b: 454). Their point is to decompose levels of\nselection and adaptation using a model organism to get evolutionary\nemergence of levels, i.e., evolutionary transition.\n\nThus, there are a variety of philosophical approaches to analyzing\nevolutionary transition on offer, whether in terms of reproducers,\nmultilevel selection, or Darwinian populations. The essential\ndiachronic nature of the problem poses a unique challenge, and\ninvolves not just the interactor and replicator (or reproducer)\nquestions, but also the questions of who is the beneficiary of the\nselection process, and how that new level emerges.\n",
