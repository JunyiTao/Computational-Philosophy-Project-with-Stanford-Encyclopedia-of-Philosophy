Universals\n\nIn metaphysics too, Cook Wilson had first to cope with idealism, thus\nwith the looming threat of Bradley\u2019s regress about relations\n(Bradley 1897, chaps. II\u2013III). Given a relation R between\na and b, a regress arises when one asks what relates\nthe relation to its relata, e.g., what relates a to R\n(and R to b), and one assumes as an answer that\na further relation, say, R*, is needed to tie a and\nR, a bit like a string that ties two objects together that\nneeds a further string to both of its ends to tie it to the objects.\nSince a need to explain the tie between a and R*\narises by the same token, one needs to introduce yet another relation\nR**, and so forth. In a brief chapter (SI, 692\u2013695),\nCook Wilson argued that the first move here\u2014supposing that\nR* is needed to tie a to R\u2014is simply\n\u2018unreal\u2019, because there could not be a new\nrelation that relates a relation to one of its terms. Thus, the\nregress would not be generated. One problem with Cook Wilson\u2019s\nobjections is that they admittedly aim at the regress concerning\n\u2018external relations\u2019 (SI, 692), but they are not fully\ndeveloped against \u2018internal relations\u2019 that Bradley also\nentertains (Bradley 1897, 17\u201318). Cook Wilson may not have a\nfull and appropriate answer to Bradley, but he thought he was thus\nfree to entertain the relation of a subject to its attributes.\n\nAlthough this is rarely noted, Cook Wilson is one of the forerunners\nof what we now call \u2018trope theories\u2019. What Edmund Husserl\ncalled \u2018moments\u2019 and later on G. F. Stout called\n\u2018characters\u2019 and D. C. Williams \u2018tropes\u2019, Cook\nWilson called instead \u2018particularization of the universal\u2019\n(SI, 336) or \u2018particularized qualities\u2019 (SI (713),\nMulligan et al. (1984, 293 n.13)). Among his contemporaries, Cook\nWilson\u2019s ideas stand indeed closest to both Stout\u2019s and\nHusserl\u2019s. He seems not to have known about the latter, but one\nnoticeable common feature concerns \u2018dependence\u2019 (Mulligan\net al. 1984, 294). Cook Wilson suggested towards the end of his life\nthat \u2018things\u2019 taken in themselves should be called\n\u2018existences\u2019 (SI, 713) and, keeping close to the language\nof Aristotle (\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9, \u2018a\nthis\u2019), he defined an \u2018existence\u2019 as \u2018a this\nsuch and such\u2019 (SI, 713). Starting with the subject-attribute\ndistinction, in the case of an existence where the subject is said to\nbe a \u2018substance\u2019, he argued that the \u201cordinary\nconception\u201d of its \u2018attribute-element\u2019 is that it is\n\u201calways a dependent reality\u201d (SI, 157), with these\n\u201cdependent existences\u201d having in turn further existences\ndependent on them (SI, 153).\n\nUnder his conception \u2018existences\u2019 are, one might say,\n\u2018bundles\u2019 of particularized qualities. But he did not\nconsider \u2018substance\u2019 as a sort of substrate in which\nuniversals are particularized, as many defenders of tropes do: the\n\u2018thing\u2019 is according to him a mere \u2018unity\u2019 of\nelements, \u201cnot something over and above them. which has them,\nbut their unified existence\u201d (SI, 155). He also expressed this\nby saying that the universal \u201ccovers the whole nature of the\nsubstance\u201d (SI, 349), as \u201cthe particular does not have the\nuniversal in it and something also besides the\nuniversal to make it particular\u201d (SI, 336, see also Joseph\n(1916a, 23)). It contains nothing besides the particularization of the\nuniversal: \u201cthe particular is not something that has the\nquality, it is the particularized quality. This animal is\nparticularized animality\u201d (SI, 713). Likewise, \u201cthe\ndifferentia cannot be separated from the genus as something added on\nto it\u201d (SI, 359), the species are just the forms that the\nuniversal, as genus, takes (SI, 335). Stout, citing Cook Wilson with\napproval, put it thus: \u201csquare shape is not squareness plus\nshape; squareness itself is a special way of being a shape\u201d\n(Stout 1930, 398). (The view harks back to Aristotle, Met. I\n8 1058a21\u201326, see also on this point Joseph (1916a,\n85\u201386), Wisdom (1934, 29), Prior (1949, 5\u20136) and Butcharov\n(1966, 147\u2013153)).\n\nTrope theories usually explain the fact that two things\n\u2018share\u2019, say, a particular shade of yellow with help of a\nresemblance class. Here, Cook Wilson parts company, claiming that the\nuniversal is \u201csomething identical in the particulars, which\nidentity cannot be done away by substituting the term similar\nfor same\u201d (SI, 344 & 347). Although the universal\nis, according to Cook Wilson, nothing outside its particularizations,\nit is claimed to be a \u201cunity and identity in particulars\u201d\nor a \u201creal unity in objects\u201d (SI, 344). It is meant to\npossess an \u2018intrinsic character\u2019 (SI, 342n. & 351),\nfor which Cook Wilson reluctantly introduced a technical term:\n\u201cthe characteristic being of the universal\u201d (SI, 342). But\nhe introduced no equivalent to Stout\u2019s fundamentum\nrelationis or \u2018distributive unity of a class\u2019 (Stout\n1930, 388), because he did not define the universal in terms of\nmembership of a class. Although he recognized that universals have an\nextension, i.e., the \u201ctotal being of the universal\u201d\ncomposed of the \u201cwhole of the particulars as the\nparticularization of this unity\u201d, he did not identify the\nuniversal with it (SI, 338).\n\nFor this reason and in virtue of the realist epistemology which he\ntied to this conception (immediately below), Cook Wilson is often read\nas having held a form of \u2018immanent realism\u2019, as opposed to\nthe moderate forms of nominalism more typical of trope theories\n(Armstrong (1978, 85) or Moreland (2001, 165 n. 16)). One objection\nagainst this stance is that there is not much point having both\nuniversals and tropes. As David Armstrong put it, one of the two is\nbound to be redundant: \u201cEither get rid of universals, embrace a\ntrope version of Resemblance Nominalism or else cut out the middlemen,\nnamely, the tropes\u201d (Armstrong 1989, 17 & 132). This reading\ncannot be the last word, though, since Cook Wilson also appears only\nto have admitted one sort of entities, the tropes or\n\u2018particularizations of the universal\u2019. Thus, there seems\nto be a tension, at best unresolved, in Cook Wilson\u2019s stance,\nwhich could explain why it has found few supporters, one exception\nbeing J. R. Jones (1949, 1950 & 1951).\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s \u2018particularizations of the universal\u2019\nare thus \u201cstrictly objective\u201d and \u201cnot a mere\nthought of ours\u201d (SI, 335\u2013336); they thus cannot be\nphenomenal entities. His thinking here is of apiece with his\nanti-idealist views on \u2018apprehension\u2019. He had argued\nagainst T. H. Green\u2019s neo-Kantian stance, that apprehension has\nno \u2018synthetic\u2019 character: any synthesis apprehended is\nattributed to the object and not the result of an activity of the\n\u2018apprehending mind\u2019. As he put it, \u201cin the judgement\nof knowledge and the act of knowledge in general we do not combine our\napprehensions, but apprehend a combination\u201d (SI, 279), and it is\n\u201cthe nature of the elements themselves\u201d which\n\u201cdetermines which unity they have or can have\u201d; the\n\u2018apprehending mind\u2019 has \u201cno power whatever to\nmake a complex idea out of simple ones\u201d (SI, 524). This\nview implies that universals and connections between them, as\nparticularized, are in rebus and to be apprehended as such\n(Price 1947, 336). The view is, therefore, that there is no possible\napprehension of the universal except as particularized:\n\n\nJust as the universal cannot be, except as particularized, so we\ncannot apprehend it except in the apprehension of a particular. (SI,\n336)\n\n\nCook Wilson further reasoned that, when one states that\n\u2018a is a triangle\u2019, one is predicating of\na the universal \u2018triangularity\u2019 and that,\nanalogously, in stating that \u2018triangularity is a\nuniversal\u2019 one would then put the universal\n\u2018triangularity\u2019 in the subject position\u2014the\n\u2018nominative case to the verb\u2019 as he quaintly puts it (SI,\n349)\u2014and treat it as if it were a particular, while putting\n\u2018universal\u2019 in the predicate position. But to talk about\nthe universal in this way would require per impossibile that\none apprehends the universal in abstraction from any of its\nparticularizations. Cook Wilson held his conception as being, if not\npopular among philosophers, at least in accordance with ordinary\nlanguage and common sense (SI, 344\u2013345).\n\nIt is thus the particularization of a given \u2018characteristic\nbeing\u2019 which we are said to apprehend, but \u201cneither as\nuniversal nor as particularized\u201d (SI, 343). There is no\nsuggestion in Cook Wilson\u2019s writings of something akin to\nHusserl\u2019s act of \u2018categorial intuition\u2019 or\n\u2018ideational abstraction\u2019, in virtue of which the universal\nwould be \u201cbrought to consciousness and [\u2026] actual\ngivenness\u201d (Husserl 2001, 292). He believed instead that the\n\u2018intrinsic character\u2019 of any universal is inexplicable,\nbecause the relation between particular and universal, although\nfundamental and thus presupposed by any explanation (SI, 335 &\n345), is sui generis, therefore not explainable in terms of\nsomething else:\n\n\nI seem to have discovered that the true source of our metaphysical\ndifficulties lies in the attempt, a mistaken attempt too frequent in\nphilosophy, to explain the nature of the universal in terms of\nsomething other than itself. In fact the relation of the universal to\nthe particular is something sui generis, presupposed in any\nexplanation of anything. The nature of the universal therefore\nnecessarily and perpetually eludes any attempt to explain itself. The\nrecognition of this enable one to elucidate the whole puzzle of the\nParmenides of Plato. (SI, 348, see also SI, 361)\n\n\nCook Wilson thus believed to have found an answer to the notorious set\nof regress arguments known as the \u2018third man\u2019 in\nParm. 132a-143e. (Ryle argued later on that Cook\nWilson\u2019s answer would not do, developing his own regress\nargument against the notion of \u2018being an instance of\u2019,\nthat Ryle read Cook Wilson as presupposing, while merely claiming that\nit is sui generis (Ryle 1971, vol. I, 9\u201310).)\n",
