    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nBorn in 121 CE and educated extensively in rhetoric and philosophy,\nMarcus Aurelius succeeded his adoptive father Antoninus Pius as Emperor of Rome in 161 CE and reigned until his own death in 180. His reign was troubled by attacks from Germany, rebellions in\nnorthern Italy and Egypt, and an outburst of the plague; at least part\nof the work for which he is famous, the Meditations, was\nwritten during the last years of his military campaigns. Aside from the Meditations Marcus\u2019 extant works include\nsome edicts, official letters, and some private correspondence,\nincluding a lengthy correspondence with his rhetoric teacher and\nlifelong friend, Fronto.[1] The private correspondence began before\nMarcus was twenty and continued into his imperial years. It includes\nwhat seem to be rhetorical exercises (for example, pieces in praise of sleep, and \nsmoke and dust) written when Marcus was still in his\n20s, an exchange about the value or disvalue of rhetoric to\nphilosophy written soon after Marcus became Emperor, and throughout,\npersonal information, frequently concerning illnesses, births, and\ndeaths in his own family.\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 chief philosophical influence was Stoic: in Book\nI of the Meditations, he records his gratitude to his Stoic teacher and\nfriend Rusticus for giving him Epictetus to read, and in a letter to\nFronto written between 145 and 147, he reports reading the 3rd c. BCE Greek Stoic Aristo of Chios\nand finding intense joy in his teachings, growing ashamed of his own\nshortcomings, and realizing that he can never again argue opposite\nsides of the same question, as required by rhetorical practice.\nThe Stoic influence, however, does not prevent Marcus from approvingly\nquoting Epicurus on ethical matters (as Seneca also had); in addition to\nEpictetus and Epicurus, Marcus quotes liberally from such figures as\nAntisthenes, Chrysippus, Democritus, Euripides, Heraclitus, Homer, and\nPlato. From Book I of the Meditations we also learn that\nMarcus\u2019 political heroes included republican opponents of\nkingship: he thanks his adoptive brother Severus not only for\nexemplifying the love of justice and the vision of a constitution based\non equality before the law, but also for the knowledge of Brutus\n(assassin of Julius Caesar), Cato, Dion (probably of Prusa), (Publius) Thrasea, and Helvidius (i.14). Consonant\nwith this, he warns himself to see to it that he does not become\n\u2018Caesarified\u2019 (that is, act like a dictator, vi.30).\n1.1 The Character of the Meditations\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 Meditations reads very differently from other ancient Greek and Roman \nphilosophical texts. Outside of Book I, which acknowledges various relatives and teachers for benefiting\nMarcus by being exemplars of some virtue or bearers of some useful\nlesson (and concludes by acknowledging the gods for providing him with such exemplars and with other circumstances conducive to his moral development), it is difficult even to tell how the work is organized, for\ninstance whether the order of the books and chapters is evidence of the order of events in Marcus\u2019 life or follows some logical or topical order,\nor whether the chapter divisions reflect breaks in Marcus\u2019\nthought. Marcus returns insistently to issues that must have arisen\nfrom his experiences, such as the imminence of death and his\nirritation with his associates\u2019 faults. Our own perennial concern with\nthese topics, Marcus\u2019 gift for vivid imagery, and the apparent\nextractability of individual sentences from the text given its lack of\nclear structure, have all contributed to making Marcus among the most\nquotable of philosophers. But the reader who wants to understand\nMarcus\u2019 thought as a whole is bound to be frustrated; sometimes\nreading Marcus feels like reading the sententiae-spoofing lines given to Hamlet\u2019s\nPolonius. Philosophical treatments of Marcus have to bring their own\nstructure to the work. \n\nWe may begin with the work\u2019s genre.  The first clear mention of Marcus Aurelius\u2019 Meditations in antiquity is by\nThemistius in the 4th c. CE, who calls it Marcus\u2019\n\u2018precepts\u2019 (parangelmata); in 900,\nSuidas\u2019 dictionary calls it a leading or directing\n(ag\u00f4g\u00ea) and the 10th-century bishop Arethas calls it \u2018the\n[writings] to himself\u2019 (ta eis\nheauton).[2]\nScholars now generally agree (following\nBrunt 1974) that Marcus wrote for his own moral improvement, to remind\nhimself of and render concrete the Stoic doctrines he wanted to live\nby, such as that the world is governed by Providence; that happiness\nlies in virtue, which is wholly in one\u2019s own power; and that one\nshould not be angry at one\u2019s associates but regard them as\nsiblings, offspring of the same God. While we do not have other\nexamples of this kind of private writing from antiquity, we do have\nEpictetus\u2019 advice to write down (as well as to rehearse) daily\nthe sorts of responses one ought to have to situations one encounters,\nso that one might have them ready at hand (procheiron) when\ncircumstances demand (Epictetus Discourses i.1.21\u201325, iv.1.111; cf.\niii.5.11, iii.26.39 on moral improvement being the appropriate aim of\nreading and writing). And Marcus describes his own writings as\nsupports (parast\u00eamata, iii.11), records\n(parap\u00eagmata, ix.3.2) and rules (kanones, v.22,\nx.2).\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 purpose of mentally equipping himself to deal with\nwhat comes his way explains the Meditations\u2019\noften aphoristic and sloganeering style (e.g. \u2018Erase\nimpressions!\u2019; \u2018Do nothing at random!\u2019;\n\u2018Those who now bury will soon be buried!\u2019): as Marcus\nsays, for the one who has been bitten by true doctrines even the\nbriefest saying suffices as a reminder (hupomn\u00easis) of\nfreedom from pain and fear (x.34). In i.7, Marcus speaks of\nreading Epictetus\u2019 \u2018hupomn\u00eamata\u2019; Arrian,\nwho wrote down Epictetus\u2019 teachings, named them \nhupomn\u00eamata,  apparently in reference to\nXenophon\u2019s Memorabilia (whose Greek title was \u2018hupomn\u00eamata\u2019) of Socrates. Marcus\u2019 purpose also explains why\nwhen Marcus refers to events in his life, he does not specify them in a\nway that would allow anyone else to identify them, and why he uses\ntechnical Stoic terminology without\n explanation.[3]\nMarcus\u2019 purpose also makes sense of his collecting sayings of philosophers without much scruple\nas to whether the philosophical system from which the sayings come is consistent\nwith Stoicism. Finally, this purpose suggests that the reader should look for the personal\nfaults that Marcus is trying to combat, or the correct\nattitude he is trying to inculcate, when he brings up some doctrine or\nargument, whether Stoic or not. So for example, xi.18, which\nbegins by saying that human beings came into the world for the sake of\neach other and that the metaphysical alternatives are atoms or Nature\n(see below, 4.1), is a list of ten prescriptions against anger, a particularly consequential failing in those with power (cf.\nix.42). Again, ix.28 invokes the Stoic doctrine of eternal\nrecurrence to bring to mind the insignificance of mortal things.\nThis suggests that despite the quotability of individual assertions in\nthe Meditations, we should approach them by studying their\n\u2018therapeutic\u2019 context, that is, by asking: what moral and\npsychological effects is Marcus trying to achieve by saying\nthis? When Marcus says \u2018p\u2019, he is not always simply\nexpressing his belief that p.\nBuilding on this point about the genre of the Meditations and seeking to establish its particular philosophical content, Hadot 1998 organizes Marcus\u2019 thoughts around the Epictetan disciplines of\n(i) desire, (ii) impulse and (iii) assent; according to Hadot, these\nappear in Marcus as the rules of (i) being contented with whatever\nhappens, (ii) conducting oneself justly towards others, and (iii)\nexercising discernment in one\u2019s judgments\n(35\u201336).[4] \nBy contrast Gill 2013 identifies four recurring \u2018strands\u2019\nin Marcus: (i) aspiration to an ethical ideal conceived in Stoic terms\nas the understanding that only virtue is good and that all human\nbeings are akin, which involves (ii) acceptance of death and\ntransience as features of our existence that are not up to us; both\n(i) and (ii) are enabled by (iii) our rationality and (iv) our\nsociality, two aspects of human nature that make us a special part of\nthe whole cosmos; according to Gill, Marcus assumes the Stoic theory\nof the ethical development of (iii) and (iv) by appropriation\n(oikei\u00f4sis) and focuses on its last stage, which is the\nbringing about of (i) by self-cultivation.\n\nThe approach taken in this article follows Hadot\u2019s (1998, 5) idea that\nfor the ancients philosophy was a way of life, and that Marcus\u2019\nMeditations show us what it was like for an individual to try to live a\nStoic life. However, rather than trying to cover all the themes\nin Marcus in this light\u2014in addition to the topics discussed\nbelow, he talks about time, fate, death, the cycles of change in the\ncosmos\u2014I focus on one basic question for Marcus\u2019 project of\nliving Stoically: what does a Stoic use to guide his own conduct?\nAddressing this basic question leads into discussion of the two virtues\nMarcus has the most to say about: justice and piety.\n2. Living Stoically\n\n\nAlthough he acknowledges that he struggles to live as a philosopher,\nMarcus urges himself to that life, spelling out what it involves in\nStoic terms:\n\u2026you are no longer able to have lived your whole\nlife as a philosopher since youth; and it is clear to many others and\nto you yourself that you are far from philosophy. So you are confused:\nthe result is that obtaining the reputation of a philosopher is no\nlonger easy for you \u2026 If you have seen truly where the matter\nlies, then leave behind your reputation and be content even if you\nlive the remainder of life, however long [it may be], as your nature\nwills. Consider what it wills, and let nothing else distract you. For\nyour experience tells you how much you have strayed: nowhere in\nso-called reasonings, wealth, reputation, enjoyment, nowhere do you\nfind living well. So where is it? In doing those things which\nhuman nature seeks. And how will one do these things? If one has\ndoctrines from which [flow] one\u2019s impulses and actions. Which\ndoctrines?  Those concerning goods and evils: that nothing is good for\na human being which does not make them just, temperate, courageous,\nfree; that nothing is bad, which does not make them the contraries of\nthe aforementioned. (viii.1, emphasis mine)\n In saying that living well lies in doing what his human nature seeks,\nMarcus is echoing generations of Stoic philosophers.  Cleanthes says\nthe goal (telos) is \u2018living in agreement with nature\u2019; Chrysippus,\n\u2018living according to the experience of what happens by\nnature\u2019; Diogenes, \u2018being reasonable in the selection and\nrejection of what is according to nature\u2019; Archedemus,\n\u2018living completing all appropriate actions\u2019; Antipater,\n\u2018living continually selecting what is according to nature and\nrejecting what is contrary to nature\u2019 (Arius Didymus 6a). These\nformulae indicate that the goal is to act in accordance with nature,\nand to be in a certain cognitive state in relation to one\u2019s acts\naccording to nature: in agreement, on the basis of experience, being\nreasonable, continually (dienek\u00f4s, i.e. consistently, stably?), all of which\nimply understanding. \n\n\nBut how is a Stoic to put this into practice?  What is it to do what one\u2019s human nature seeks, in the particular circumstances in which one finds oneself?  Surely it does not mean doing whatever is one\u2019s strongest desire to do in the moment.\n\n\nIn the passage quoted, Marcus explains how one might do what is in\none\u2019s nature by saying that one must modify one\u2019s beliefs about good\nand bad, as these inform one\u2019s impulses and actions.  He says, for\nexample, that if we believe that pleasure is good and pain evil, then\nwe will be resentful of the pleasures enjoyed by the vicious and the\npains suffered by the virtuous. And if we are resentful of what\nhappens, we will be finding fault with Nature and will be impious\n(ix.3). But while false beliefs about good and bad hinder us from\nfollowing nature and acting virtuously, how can their removal by\nitself enable us to follow nature and act virtuously? Once I know that\npleasure and pain are neither good nor evil but are indifferent for my happiness, I still need to know how I should respond to\nthis pleasure and that pain, in order to be following nature. The\nfirst century Stoic philosopher Seneca argues in his Letters to Lucilius for the\nusefulness of concrete advice for certain types of situations\n(praecepta) on the grounds that having eliminated vice and\nfalse opinion, one will not yet know what to do and how to do it\n(94.23), for inexperience, not only passion, prevents us from knowing\nwhat to do in each situation (94.32); Seneca also says that nature\ndoes not teach us what the appropriate action is in every case\n(94.19). Perhaps Marcus thinks that there is, in every choice\nsituation, something one can do that is productive of virtue (he says,\n\u2018nothing is good for a human being which does not make\nhim just, temperate, courageous, free\u2019; on the other hand,\n\u2018make\u2019 may have the sense of constituting rather than\nproducing, in which case the reference to the virtues in the passage\nisn\u2019t action-guiding at all). Alternatively, he may think that what produces virtue is not the content of one\u2019s action, but the thoughts\nthat go along with it. But what thoughts are these? Surely, if virtue\nis to have any content, thinking \u2018only virtue is good\u2019 is\nnot going to be sufficient.\n2.1 The Deliberative Content Problem: The Good, The Bad, and the Indifferent\n\n\nTo appreciate Marcus\u2019s distinctive contribution to the question of how\nto live as a Stoic, it will be useful to begin with a background in\nearly Stoic ethics.  Stoicism teaches that virtue is the only good for oneself,\nthat vice is the only evil, and that everything else is\nindifferent so far as one\u2019s happiness is concerned. That is to say, only virtue can contribute to our\nhappiness; only vice can contribute to our unhappiness. Poverty,\nill-repute, and ill-health are not bad, for their possession does not \nmake us unhappy; wealth, fame and good are not good because their\npossession does not make us happy. If one asks, \u2018how shall I act? On\nwhat can I base my choices between health and sickness, wealth and\npoverty, so that my choices are rational and not arbitrary?\u2019, then the textbook\nStoic answer is that among indifferents some are to be preferred as\nbeing in accordance with nature (Diogenes Laertius vii.101\u20135;\nArius Didymus 7a\u2013b, Epictetus ii.6.9 [for these passages see\nLong and Sedley 1987, section 58]). So whereas it is absolutely\nindifferent how many hairs one has on one\u2019s head or whether the number\nof stars in the sky is even or odd, we do, and in most cases should,\nprefer and select wealth, fame and good health over poverty,\nill-repute and sickness, because these are (in most cases) in\naccordance with nature.  Cicero gives one reason why there must be\nvalue-differences among indifferents: if everything aside from virtue\nand vice were absolutely indifferent, the perfected rationality of the\nStoic wise person would have no function to carry out (On\nEnds iii.50). Wisdom\u2019s exercise would consist in flipping coins\nto select one indifferent over another.\n  \n\nWhen we select things that are according to nature and reject things that are contrary to nature, our actions are\nappropriate (kath\u00eakonta; for Marcus\u2019 use of this term,\nsee i.2, iii.1.2, iii.16.2, vi.22, vi.26.3), and an appropriate action\nis an action for which there is a reasonable (eulogon)\njustification. An appropriate action counts as a morally perfect or\nvirtuous action (katorth\u00f4ma) when it is done from\nunderstanding, i.e., from the wise and stable cognitive state possessed only by\nthe fully virtuous person (Arius Didymus 8).  Although the talk of the\nappropriate action having a reasonable justification might suggest\nthat more than one action could be appropriate for a situation, or\nthat what is appropriate could be relativized to the ordinary person\u2019s\ngrasp of the situation (as some utilitarians consider that action\nright which maximizes expected rather than actual utility), so that\n\u2018reasonable justification\u2019 would be like the law\u2019s\n\u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 or \u2018reasonable person\u2019, the\nStoics\u2019 use of \u2018reasonable\u2019 in other contexts, such as the\ndefinition of the good emotions (eupatheiai) (Diogenes\nLaertius vii.116), the end (Arius Didymus 6a), and the virtues of\nreasoning and rhetoric (SVF iii.264, 268; 291, 294), clearly takes the\nstandard of reasonableness to be the right reason of the fully\nvirtuous person.  This points to there being only one appropriate\naction per situation, a conclusion which is confirmed by Chrysippus\u2019\nclaim that the fully virtuous person performs all appropriate actions\nand leaves no appropriate action unperformed (iii.510). (This\ndiscussion of the \u2018reasonable\u2019 and appropriate action\nfollows Brennan 1996, 326\u201329.) \n  \n\nThe appropriate action, for which there is a reasonable justification,\nis not in all cases the one that obtains or pursues the preferred\nindifferents for the agent.  According to our evidence, while it is\nour nature to preserve our bodily constitution (Diogenes Laertius\nvii.85\u201386), there are situations in which we ought to give up\nour lives (Cicero On Duties iii.89\u2013115, On\nEnds iii.60), for example, to save our country (for discussion of\nthis issue, see Barney 2003 and Brennan 2005).  Further, Chrysippus\nseems to have said that if he knew he was fated to be ill, then he\nwould have an impulse towards illness, but lacking this knowledge he should\nselect the things that are well-adapted (t\u00f4n\neuphuester\u00f4n) to obtaining what is in accordance with\nnature (Epictetus Discourses ii.6.9). This seems to suggest\nthat in the absence of knowledge that one is fated to be ill, one\nshould select health, but either this selection is not guaranteed to\nbe in accordance with nature or to result in an appropriate action, or\na selection (e.g. the selection of health) can be in accordance with\nnature even though what it aims at (e.g. obtaining or enjoying\nhealth), is not.  So perhaps knowing the preferred indifferents guides\nactions only in the way that Ross\u2019s identification of prima\nfacie duties is supposed to help with moral decision-making,\nnamely, by making certain considerations salient to deliberation (for\nthis picture, see Vogt 2008, 173\u2013178), but the account is silent about\nhow to weigh indifferents against each other in a particular\nsituation. Alternatively, it may be that something\u2019s being according\nto nature gives the agent only epistemic reasons for selection rather\nthan practical reasons responsive to some intrinsic value of the\nindifferents (for this view see Klein 2015).  \n\n\nWe might wonder why anything should be called according to nature, or\npreferred, if there are circumstances in which it is not.  Why not\nreserve the label \u2018according to nature\u2019 for what is fated?\nThe heterodox Stoic Aristo of Chios denied that any indifferents were to be\npreferred by nature, pointing out that the same thing could be\npreferred in one circumstance and dispreferred in another (Sextus\nEmpiricus, Against the Professors 11.64\u20137).  However,\nthe orthodox Stoics seem to insist that preferability, and being in\naccordance with nature, is an intrinsic character of some things, and\nDiogenes Laertius reports a distinction between appropriate actions\nthat do not depend on circumstances, such as looking after one\u2019s\nhealth and sense-organs, and appropriate actions that are appropriate\nonly in certain circumstances, such as mutilating oneself (Diogenes\nLaertius vii.108\u20139).  So it is not true of all, but only some,\nappropriate actions that their appropriateness is\ncircumstantial. Perhaps the idea is that while it is only true for the\nmost part that health (or strength or well functioning sense organs)\nis in accordance with nature, this does not mean that the naturalness\nof health (strength, well functioning sense organs) depends on the\ncircumstances.  On this view, what health is for a species is defined by the\nspecies\u2019 nature, and that is unconditionally according to its\nnature.\n\nThe fact that our sources understand what is according to nature both\nin terms of cosmic nature or what is fated and in terms of the\nindividual natures out of which the nature of the cosmos is built up\nraises the question of conflict, for instance when my health, which is\nin accordance with my nature, is not fated, or in accordance with\ncosmic nature.  Such conflict can be avoided for human beings by\nappeal to our rational nature, on the one hand, and providential\ncosmic nature, on the other: our rationality enables us to appreciate\nand will what is according to cosmic nature because the latter is best\nfor the whole.  On the specific question of why we ought to prefer, as\nin accordance with nature, the interest of the community to our own,\nBrennan 2005 appeals to the Stoic doctrine of\noikei\u00f4sis: we have a natural tendency to care for\nothers, at first our family and friends and ultimately our\nfellow-citizens and fellow-humans (154\u201359). We may wonder how\nthis impulse could be strong enough to overcome self-interest;\nhowever, Brennan observes that the Stoic\u2019s realization that\nindifferents do not contribute to happiness weakens one barrier to\nimpartial deliberation: if indifferents were good, the Stoic would\nwant them for herself; since they are not good, she deliberates about\nhow to distribute them as justice demands (164\u201365). Since\nconsiderations of virtue cannot (on pain of circularity) enter into\nher deliberations, what gives \u2018justice\u2019s demands\u2019 content\n(at least in Cicero, and Cicero attributes similar views to\nChrysippus) are considerations of the community\u2019s utility and respect\nfor property-rights (206\u201326). These indifferents are to be\npreferred as more in accordance with nature than, for example, one\u2019s\nindividual utility.\n\n\nAs we shall see, Marcus\u2019 way of addressing the deliberative content\nproblem is in one respect like Cicero\u2019s: the characterization of right\nconduct comes from ideas about what justice demands, and the content\nof justice comes from outside Stoic ethics proper. In Marcus\u2019 case, it\ncomes from the idea that the cosmos is a city and that all rational\nbeings are fellow-citizens of this city. The role of citizen brings\nwith it certain conventional expectations of conduct which Marcus\ntransfers to citizenship of the cosmopolis.\n3. Justice: Acting for the Sake of the Cosmopolis\n\n\nMarcus says that one should be concerned with two things only: acting\njustly and loving what is allotted one (x.11, cf. xii.1). He fleshes\nout \u2018acting justly\u2019 in terms of acting communally (ix.31),\nand adds that wherever one lives, one should live as a citizen of the\ncosmic city (x.15). Appeal to the idea that the cosmos is a city\nallows him to say that we should do well for all humanity (viii.23),\nfor we each have a citizen\u2019s duty to contribute to the welfare of the\nwhole cosmopolis, i.e., to the welfare of all humans as our fellow-citizens.  Conversely, anyone who does not contribute to the\ncommunal goal (to koin\u00f4nikon telos) is acting\nseditiously (ix.23); one may not hate even one man, for this rends the\ncommunity (xi.8).\n\n\nStrikingly, Marcus seems to specify this communal goal in terms of\nindifferents rather than virtue, with the result that one should aim\nto bring about preferred indifferents for the whole of which one is a\npart. When he explains that that whatever happens to a part benefits\nthe whole, and that what is advantageous (to sumpheron) to\none person does not conflict with what is advantageous to another,\nMarcus writes that by \u2018interest\u2019 he means intermediate\nthings (t\u00f4n mes\u00f4n) (vi.45; perhaps he\ntakes this to follow from the coincidence of what is in accordance\nwith nature for the whole and the part). Even though food is not a\ngood and hunger not an evil, a Stoic will respond to a hungry person\nwith food, rather than (only) a lecture that food is not a good and\nhunger not an evil. \n\nOf course, one\u2019s efforts to give food to the hungry, or to benefit the\nhungry by giving them food, may fail, so Marcus recommends pursuing\nsuch ends with reservation (hupexairesis), making one\u2019s impulses\nconditional on what is fated to happen (iv.1, v.20, vi.50).\n\nPresumably this response is grounded in our natural concern\n(oikei\u00f4sis), which at its most fundamental is responsible\nfor parents\u2019 caring for their children (Diogenes Laertius\nvii.85), and Marcus tells himself to regard other human beings as most\nhis own (oikeiotaton) when thinking how to benefit them and\nhow not to obstruct their plans (v.20).\n\n\nMarcus says that the rational nature does well when it directs\nimpulses (hormai) to communal action (viii.7). We must do\nwhat follows from our constitution, and the communal faculty (to\nkoin\u00f4nikon) plays the leading part in the human\nconstitution (vii.55). After the communal faculty comes the rational\nfaculty (vii.55), but again, the rational faculty is perfected in\njustice (ix.22). As a human being, one is able to contribute to the perfectionn\n(sumpl\u00ear\u00f4tikos) of the whole political organization;\nMarcus urges himself to make his every action perfective of political\nlife (ix.23). Sometimes Marcus goes so far as to identify the good\n(agathon) of a rational creature with community (v.16).\n\n\nFinally, Marcus simply denies that there is ever any conflict between\nthe good of the individual and the good of the whole community of\nwhich that individual is a part. He says, on the one side, that the\nperfection, well-being, and stability of the whole depends on what\nhappens to each part (v.8).  And on the other side, he says that what\nthe nature of the whole brings about is good (agathon) for\neach part (ii.3), and that what is not hurtful to the city can\u2019t be\nhurtful to its citizen (v.22).  He compares the relationship between\nseparate rational individuals and the community to limbs and body,\nwhich are so constituted as to work together (vii.13). The comparison\nbetween the citizen-city relationship and the limb-body relationship\ngoes back to Plato\u2019s Republic (462b\u2013d), according to which in\nthe ideal city, harm to one citizen or part of the city is felt as\nharm to the rest of the citizens or the city as a whole. While Plato\nuses the limb-body analogy to emphasize the unity of feeling the ideal\ncity achieves, Marcus uses it to emphasize that the citizen is a\nfunctional part of the whole city: just as this material making up a limb would not be a\nlimb at all without the body of which it is a part, so too, this human\nindividual would not be what they are without a city of which they are a\npart (Marcus must mean the cosmic city).  One might object that there\nis more to being a human being than being a citizen (Striker 1996,\n259), but perhaps Marcus is not merely saying that the cosmos is like a city\nand we are like its citizens; perhaps he is saying that the cosmos actually is\na city and human beings actually are its citizens, so that what it is to be\nhuman is exhausted by citizenship of the cosmos.\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 claims about the harmony between the welfare or\nadvantage of wholes and parts are also central to his conception of\npiety.\n4. Piety: Welcoming What Happens as Part of the Whole\n\n\nMarcus writes,\n\n\nEvery nature is satisfied with itself when it goes along its way well, and the\nrational nature goes along its way well when it assents to nothing false or unclear\namong its impressions, when it directs impulses to communal actions,\nwhen it generates desires and inclinations for only those things that\nare in our power, and when it welcomes everything apportioned to it by\ncommon nature. (viii.7)\n\n\nThe last of these four behaviors is productive of piety. The\nkey idea in piety is that the cosmos as a whole is providentially\ndesigned, and so is as good as it can be, and so its parts are as good\nas they can be, and so our attitude towards every part ought to be\nacceptance\u2014or as he sometimes puts it more strongly, love.\nAccording to Hadot (1998, 128), Marcus follows Epictetus in\ndistinguishing impulse (horm\u00ea) from desire\n(orexis), and innovates by restricting impulse to the sphere\nof our activity. Desire, parallel to impulse, is restricted to\nthe sphere of our passivity; thus, we should desire whatever befalls\nus. Hadot is mistaken here, for according to the Stoics, our\nreactions to what befalls us are also impulses, and desire is a species\nof impulse. Marcus says either to restrict desire to what is up\nto us (ix.7) or to quench (sb\u00easai) it. Epictetus\ntells us to refrain from desire for the time being (iii.24.23, 24,\n85). The reason to quench desire is the danger of desiring the\nwrong thing: to desire something is to believe it to be good, and\nto have a runaway impulse towards it. This also gives\nus an argument against desiring the things that befall one. We\nmight note that Marcus, in the passage above, recommends not desiring\nbut welcoming (aspazomen\u00ea) whatever befalls one.\nPerhaps we should associate desire (orexis) with pursuing, and\nwelcoming with contentment upon receiving.\n\n\nWe can use our understanding of piety as appreciation of providence\nto illuminate two slogans frequently found in Marcus:\n\u2018providence or atoms?\u2019 and \u2018erase\nimpressions\u2019.\n4.1 Providence or Atoms?\n\n\nNine times in the Meditations, Marcus lays out the\nalternatives: providence, nature, reason, on the one hand, or atoms,\non the other (iv.3, vi.24, vii.32, vii.50, viii.17, ix.28, xi.39, x.6,\nxi.18). (On these passages, see Cooper 2004.[5]) Although he does not\nexplain, the reference is clear enough: either the world and what\nhappens is the design of a providential God, as believed by the Stoics\n(and Platonists), or the outcome of atoms colliding randomly in the\nvoid, as believed by the Epicureans. What is not obvious is why Marcus\nis laying out these alternatives. Is it because his grasp of Stoic\nphysics is so tenuous that he must be open to the possibility that\nEpicurean physics is true (Rist 1982, 43, Annas 2004, 116)? Marcus\ndoes at one point express despair about his own grasp of physics\n(vii.67). Or is his point that whether one\u2019s physics is Epicurean or\nStoic, one must live as the Stoics enjoin (Annas, 108\u2013114,\nHadot, 148), that is to say, rationally, with a single purpose, rising\nabove conventional goods and evils (ix.28)?  Does the convergence of\nEpicureans and Stoics on such ethical points, in view of the two\nschools\u2019 very different physical opinions, strengthen his confidence\nin the ethics (Annas, 109)?\n\n\nIn one passage of the Meditations, Marcus gives the\n\u2018providence or atoms\u2019 alternatives when he is clearly\ninterested in the convergence of ethical opinion among all the\nwise\u2014not only Stoics and Epicureans, for he also cites\nDemocritus, Plato and Antisthenes\u2014on the insignificance of\nmatters which ordinary people value most (life and death, pain,\nreputation) and the far greater importance of virtue (vii.32\nff.). In this context, Marcus puts Epicurus\u2019 view that at\ndeath our soul-atoms are dispersed and we cease to exist on all fours\nwith the Stoic view that Nature either extinguishes or transforms us at\ndeath. Here Marcus also quotes Epicurus on pain with\napproval: pain is either bearable (if long-lasting) or short (if\nintense). His point seems to be that whatever one\u2019s\nparticular philosophical allegiance, allegiance to philosophy involves\nrising above pain, death, and reputation\u2014and also, it turns out,\ninvolves not grumbling: for if the way things are is due to\nprovidence, then they could not be better and one is wrong to grumble,\nbut if the way things are is due to chance, then it is pointless to\ngrumble (viii.17, ix.39).\n\n\nStill, Marcus is not really open to the possibility of Epicurean\nphysics. He asserts repeatedly, after laying out the\n\u2018providence or atoms\u2019 options, that the world is in fact\ngoverned by an intelligent nature of which he is a functional part,\nlike a citizen of a state (iv.3, x.6). So we should not make too\nmuch of Marcus\u2019 diffidence about his mastery of physics (vii.67),\nfor he may only mean that his own technical grasp of Stoic physics is\ninadequate, rather than that he lacks confidence in its superiority\nover Epicurean physics. Elsewhere he insists that he has a\nsufficient conception (ennoia) of a life according to nature\nso as to live it (i.9, 17).\n\n\nWe also see Marcus\u2019 reliance on Stoic physics in his\ninnovative derivation of the Stoic doctrine of the indifference of\neverything except virtue and vice from providence.  Since wealth,\nreputation, and health are distributed among the virtuous and the\nvicious indiscriminately, he reasons, they cannot be good, for that\nwould be contrary to providence (ii.11).  This does not mean Marcus is\ngenerally grounding ethics in physics,\n however.[6]\n According to the\nStoics, the beliefs of anyone other than a wise and fully virtuous\nperson are weak and unstable (since not anchored in an understanding\nof the whole), and so we should expect a non-wise Stoic like Marcus to\nseek out all kinds of reasons to shore up his ethical beliefs. Marcus\ncan consistently regard these \u2018back-up\u2019 arguments for a\nmoment of weakness as weaker and less plausible than the Stoic\narguments and at the same time as important to have at hand\u2014as,\nif you\u2019re trying to quit smoking, you might hang on to \u2018it gives\nyou wrinkles\u2019 for the moments in which \u2018it gives you\ncancer\u2019 isn\u2019t doing the trick.\n\n\nFinally, Marcus uses \u2018providence or atoms\u2019 in the\nMeditations to drive out an impious attitude:\n\n\nAre you discontented with the part you have been assigned in the\nwhole? Recall the alternatives: providence or atoms, and\nhow many are the demonstrations, that the cosmos is a city.\n(iv.3.2)\n\n\nTo understand what the thought, \u2018providence or atoms\u2019,\nis doing here we have to connect it with the discontent that is the\ntopic of the passage. Marcus is admonishing himself for his\ndiscontent with things as they stand, saying to himself, \u2018if you\nare finding fault with things as they are, then you must think that\nthey are not due to providence. But if they\u2019re not due to\nprovidence, then they\u2019re the result of random\ncauses.\u2019 In this passage, \u2018atoms\u2019 functions as\nthe implicit commitment of one who finds fault with things as they\nare. The reasoning works to raise the stakes for someone who is\ngrumbling at the way things are. It brings out that there is a\ncontradiction between believing, as a Stoic must, that the world is\nprovidentially run, and being discontented with anything that\nhappens. Once the contradiction is brought out, it becomes clear\nwhich of the two alternatives a Stoic must plump for, and what follows\nabout the attitudes he must consequently adopt towards the world and\nevery part of it. Sometimes Marcus spells out these steps:\n\u2018But look at the evidence in favour of providence\u2014the whole\ncosmos is organised like a city, that is to say, each part is so\norganized as to serve the good of the whole\u2019. For example,\nat iv.27, Marcus appears to be starting to consider the twin\npossibilities that the world is a cosmos or a chaotic mixture\n(kuke\u00f4n, referring perhaps to Heraclitus fr. 125), but\nthen he immediately asserts that it is a cosmos. Often, however,\nMarcus does not have to spell this out. In any event, what\n\u2018atoms\u2019 stands for, in this context, is impiety. So\nMarcus is telling his grumbling self: your grumbling is evidence\nof impiety, evidence of your being like an Epicurean\u2014except that\nactual Epicureans are more philosophical and do not grumble about an\nirrational cosmos bringing them bad luck, but rather, try themselves to\nlive rationally.\n\n\nThis last use of \u2018providence or atoms\u2019 shows that since\nMarcus is writing to effect certain psychological attitudes in\nhimself, we have to look to context to determine what the desired\nattitude is, and then determine how the things he tells himself are\nsupposed to effect the attitude. Perhaps bringing about the desired attitude calls\nfor making hyperbolic statements in order to correct for some natural\ntendency he thinks he has. If we do not keep this in mind as we read\nMarcus, we will only find contradictions, tensions, and ambivalences\nand we will conclude that Marcus is an eclectic and imprecise\nthinker.\n\n4.2 Erase Impressions\n\n\nMarcus often tells himself, \u2018erase (exaleipsai) your\nimpressions (phantasiai)\u2019 (v.2, vii.29, viii.29, ix.7,\ncf. ii.5, iii.16, v.36). According to Stoic epistemology, things in\nthe world impress images of themselves on human and animal souls, as\nshapes can impress themselves on a wax tablet. Human beings may also\nassent to or withhold assent from these impressions; judgments are the\nresult of our assenting to impressions, or more precisely to the\npropositional articulations of our impressions. While assent is\nvoluntary, impressions are not (cf. Epictetus fr. 9). So clearly we\ncan\u2019t erase our impressions in the sense of simply wiping them out,\nbut then what is Marcus telling himself to do? In exchanges with\nAcademic skeptics, the Stoics say that the wise person does not assent\nexcept to impressions that represent accurately the thing in the world\nthat is their cause (\u2018kataleptic\u2019 impressions); how does\nMarcus\u2019 injunction to \u2018erase\u2019 impressions relate to this\nstandard?\n\n\nAccording to Hadot (103\u20134), by \u2018erase impressions\u2019\nMarcus means \u2018assent only to objective and physical descriptions\nof externals\u2019. What Marcus is telling himself to erase,\nHadot says, is value-judgments about everything external to his\ncharacter. Hadot thinks Marcus is simply confused in using the\nterm phantasia for these judgments (the correct term, which he\nsometimes uses [cf. iv.39, v.26, viii.4], and which he sometimes\ndistinguishes from phantasia [cf. viii.47\u201349], is\nhupol\u00eapsis or \u2018assumption\u2019).\n\n\nYet the distinction between objective physical facts and subjective\nvalue judgments seems more existentialist than Stoic\u2014for the Stoics\nvalue is objective, and indeed Marcus repeatedly exults in the beauty\nand goodness of the cosmos as a whole. (We should not assume that\nthe evaluations are all added by us, the subjects, to the impression,\nfor the Stoics think that there are evaluative impressions, cf.\nEpictetus fr. 9.) Nevertheless, it is right that Marcus,\nfollowing Epictetus, recommends refraining from judging\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 since those describe only\nvirtue and vice and none but the fully virtuous person really knows\nthose (see, e.g., Encheiridion 45). And it is also right that\nMarcus often deals with things that are conventionally accorded high\nvalue in reductive material terms. So, for example, he\nwrites,\n\n\nTake for instance the impression in the case of relishes and such\nedibles, that this one is the corpse of a fish, and that one of a bird or\na pig. And again that this Phalernian [wine] is the little juice of\na bunch of grapes, and the purple-edged robe is sheep\u2019s wool dyed\nby the blood of a shellfish; and in the case of things having to do\nwith sexual union [that it is] friction of the genitals with the\nexcretion of mucus in spasms. Such are the impressions that get\nat things and go right into them, so that one sees how each thing\nreally is. (vi.13, cf. viii.21, 24)\n\n\nIndeed, Marcus himself describes what he is doing here as defining\nwhat each thing is stripped naked, and enumerating the components into\nwhich it disintegrates (iii.11); elsewhere he adds that this technique\nleads one to despise the thing so analyzed (xi.2).\n\n\nHowever, this is only one of two complementary ways Marcus deals\nwith his impressions. The other is to consider things that are\nconventionally disvalued in their larger context, so as to show what\ngood they serve. Indeed, the passage recommending the examination\nof each thing stripped naked continues,\n\n\n\u2026 nothing is so productive of greatness of mind as to be able to\nexamine, systematically and in truth, each of the things that befall us\nin life, and to look always at it so as to consider what sort of use\n(chreia) it provides for what sort of cosmos and what value\n(axia) it has for the whole, and what in relation to the human\nbeing, they being a citizen of the highest city, of which other cities\nare like households (iii.11, cf. viii.11, iv.23, iii.2, vi.36, vii.13,\nx.20, 25)\n\n\nHere Marcus is recommending, for the purpose of correct appreciation\nof the value of things, the reintegration of each thing into its cosmic\ncontext. So contrary to first appearances, the goal is not to\nregard things in the world as stripped of value, but rather, to see\neach thing\u2019s true value, which is determined by considering its\ncontribution to the whole cosmos. The physical description of\neach thing is not a description of its naked physical appearance when\nisolated from everything else, but its reintegration into the beautiful\nand intelligent design of the cosmos. So Marcus writes,\n\n\nFor example, when some parts of baking bread crack open, these\ncracks too, even though in a way they are contrary to the baker\u2019s\norders, are somehow fitting and in their own way rouse eagerness for\nfood. Again, figs, when they are ripest, gape open \u2026 and\nmany other things, if one were to look at them individually, would be\nfar from beautiful of appearance, but nevertheless, on account of their\nfollowing things that come to be by nature, are well-ordered and educate\nour soul. (iii.2)\n\n\nInsight into what is in accordance with nature is gained by\ndetermining, for each thing that obtains, its contribution to, or\nfunctional role in, the cosmos (rather than by looking at what\nregularly happens, or what happens with healthy specimens, etc.).\nAnd once one understands this functional contribution, one is able to\nsee the value of each thing, how beautifully it contributes to a\nwell-designed whole.\n\n\nNow that we have a sense of what erased impressions are to be\nreplaced with, we can return to the questions of what is to be erased,\nand what it is to be erased. Marcus does seem to speak\nindifferently about judgments and impressions: he tells himself\nto erase his impressions, and he tells himself to remove opinion (iv.7,\nviii.40); he tells himself he can bear what his opinion renders\nbearable and do what his impressions deem advantageous or appropriate\n(x.3). But this need not be because Marcus is confused about the\ndifference between an impression and a judgment; he may just be using\nthe term \u2018impression\u2019 more loosely, as his predecessors,\nStoic as well as non-Stoic, do. For the predecessors:\nMarcus\u2019 Stoic role-model, Epictetus, says the Iliad is nothing\nbut impressions and the use of impressions (i.28.13). Marcus\nhimself uses the term \u2018impression\u2019 for a recognition (of\nhis own need to be straightened out, i.7), the conception of a standard\n(of a constitution observing equality before the law) (i.14), the\nimpression a person makes on others (i.15), and an appearance\u2014the\nway a thing strikes someone (i.16). These are all accepted uses\nof the term. So it\u2019s more fruitful to ask: what kind\nof impression are we supposed to erase?\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras, which greatly influenced the Stoics, can\nhelp us here. This text contrasts the power of phantasia\n(often translated \u2018appearance\u2019) with an art of measurement,\nthe former often going wrong because comparative or perspectival (A\nlooks tall because she\u2019s beside the very short B; B looks taller\nthan A because she\u2019s closer to me), and standing in need of\ncorrection by an unchanging standard (a meter ruler, for example)\n(356b\u201357a). That Marcus may find the same defects of perspective in impressions is suggested indirectly by the\ncorrections he prescribes: inspect your impressions (ii.7, iii.6,\nv.22, viii.13, viii.26); test them by \u2018physicizing, ethicizing,\ndialecticizing\u2019 (viii.13), that is to say, by seeing how they\nfare when tested against your physical, ethical, and dialectical\nunderstanding\u2014all of which are informed by a picture of the\nwhole. In xii.18, he tells himself:\n\n\nAlways look at the whole: what that thing is that gives you such an\nimpression, and undo it, distinguishing it into its cause, its matter,\nits point, the time within which it must come to a stop.\n\n\n\nTo the extent that impressions are involuntary, Marcus\u2019\n\u2018erase\u2019 may mean \u2018override\u2019. He may be\nsaying: for the purposes of action and response, wipe out the\ninfluence of such-and-such impressions (Plato\u2019s Protagoras,\nsimilarly, speaks of rendering the power of appearance unauthoritative\n[356e]); focus instead on your understanding of the whole, which will\ngive you a different impression. However, the Stoics\u2019 image of the mind as a\nwax tablet being impressed by different shapes gives a particular point to talk\nof \u2018erasing.\u2019 The work Marcus is doing is to replace\nan inadequate impression with another impression, this one better grounded in a\ncomprehension of reality. Perhaps making the second mark requires\nerasing the first\u2014or perhaps making the second mark is a means of\nerasing the first, for it may be that the withholding of assent from\ncompelling impressions requires countering them with others.\n\n\nAt v.16, Marcus says that one\u2019s mind will be of the same\ncharacter as the impressions it has. This seems unfair, if\nimpressions are entirely involuntary. Marcus may think that while\ninvoluntary in the moment, impressions are subject to control in the\nlong run. Perhaps if I keep refusing to assent to my present\nimpression that wealth is good, wealth will eventually cease to appear\nto me as good. It is also not implausible that one\u2019s\ncharacter and opinion would influence one\u2019s impressions,\nespecially in the case of evaluative impressions (such as that x is\ngood or to-be-preferred) and impressions that requires some expertise to\nhave (such as that y is the treadle for a foot loom).\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nAs mentioned above (1.1), Marcus\u2019 Meditations touch on many more\ntopics than the ones addressed here, but we get further in\nunderstanding Marcus if we focus on a topic and see how his remarks on\nthat topic are related to his overall project of reminding himself how\na Stoic should live. It would be worth working this out for others of\nhis frequent remarks, such as that we are tiny and temporary fragments\nin the cosmos, that death takes us all in the end, that we ought to\nlive purposively rather than like mechanical toys.\n",
