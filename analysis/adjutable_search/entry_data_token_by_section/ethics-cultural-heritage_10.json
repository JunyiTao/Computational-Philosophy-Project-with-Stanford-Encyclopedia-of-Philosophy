    "main_text": "Cultural Property || Intangible Cultural Property\n2.5 Intangible Cultural Property\n\nWhile the cultural property discourse began with a focus on material\nheritage (buildings, artifacts, etc.), it has expanded, particularly\nin response to increasing recognition of diverse indigenous cultures,\nto include discussion of stories, songs, styles, motifs, practices,\nand traditional knowledge (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009: 1097).\nThese additional elements, typically referred to as \u201cintangible\nheritage\u201d, present a further set of puzzles and questions for\nthe concept of cultural property (Brown 2005).\n\nCentrally, while we have a straightforward grasp on what it means to\nown an artwork or artifact, the idea of owning a story or style can\nseem relatively obscure, at least in a broadly Western context. Just\nas intellectual property law has developed to better account for\nownership of intangibles, the introduction of intangible heritage into\ndiscussion of cultural property has seemed to require appeal to the\ncategory of intellectual property to account for the ownership of\ncultural heritage that takes the form of such entities as songs or\nstyles (Nicholas & Bannister 2004; entry on\n intellectual property).\n However, the application of an intellectual property framework to\nintangible cultural property has also generated objections. First, one\nmight object that the intellectual property framework functions to\ncommodify intangible cultural heritage, which can have a\n\u201ctendency to freeze social life in time\u201d, and thus offer\nan artificial and inappropriate approach to traditions and practices\nthat are constantly changing (Brown 2005: 45). Second, general\nobjections to the suitability of legal property protections for\ncultural heritage, whether tangible or intangible (discussed in\n 2.3),\n will carry over to the use of an intellectual property framework for\ndealing with intangible heritage, either based on the idea that\n\u201cculture\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d are inherently in\ntension with one another (Mezey 2007), or because the category of\nproperty (focused primarily on rights) is inadequate to capturing the\nbreadth of cultural heritage and our duties with respect to it (Prott\n& O\u2019Keefe 1992). Third, the pull towards thinking of\ncultural heritage as universally valuable (discussed in\n 2.2)\n is arguably stronger in the case of intangible heritage than in the\ncase of material heritage. For example, if knowledge aspires to be\nfree to all, then is it acceptable to restrict its flow, even for the\nsake of guarding against the exploitation of vulnerable indigenous\ncommunities (Brown 2005)? As discussed in\n section 2.3,\n one might again counter that indigenous claims are more often for\nparticipation than outright control or rights of excludability, and\nthus such tensions are resolved if one adopts an alternative model of\nproperty that does not rely on possession of all the rights that\ncomprise the \u201cbundle\u201d of classic property rights\n(Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009: 1111\u20131112). Indeed, many\nobjections to the use of intangible heritage move beyond the discourse\nof cultural property altogether, as discussed in\n section 4\n on cultural appropriation.\n\nA further puzzle is that it can be less clear what counts as a\nparticular group\u2019s intangible cultural property than it is in\nthe case of material heritage. For instance, when a museum displays\nthe cultural artifacts of a particular group, the cultural origins of\nthe artifacts are often not controversial (though they of course can\nbe): rather, controversy might surround ownership of the artifact\npredicated on a clear understanding of the culture of origin. In\ncontrast, it can be relatively harder to trace the lineages of\npractices and stories, and superficial similarities in cultural\ntraditions may lead to claims of intangible cultural property that are\nmore difficult to justify (Brown 2005: 51).\n",
