This function of education is critically important as a\nmatter of justice. Education aimed at preparing individuals for\nemployment has become especially pressing in view of the income\ninequalities that leading economists have highlighted (Piketty 2014;\nSaez & Zucman 2014). And since education for employment is a\nhighly positional good given a competitive labor market, it matters\nall the more how educational opportunity in this arena is\ndistributed.\n\nAlthough there is a clear correlation between educational attainment,\nincome, and employment rates (see 2022 U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics,\n Other Internet Resources),\n the link between academic achievement as measured on tests and labor\nmarket outcomes has been found to be more attenuated (Bowles, Gintis,\n& Osborne 2001). Research has shown that \u201csoft skills\u201d\n(e.g., personality traits like tenacity; individual\u2019s goals and\npreferences) may be more predictive of success than cognitive\nabilities measured by test scores (Heckman & Kautz 2012).\nMoreover, schooling that is most directly targeted at\nemployment\u2014vocational education\u2014has a history in the U.S.\nof entrenching race and class-based inequalities (e.g., Oakes 1985).\nAlthough the relationship between traditional academic skills and\nlabor market success may be less significant than previously thought,\nand despite the checkered history of vocational education, formal\nschooling still has a critical role to play toward equipping\nindividuals for labor market success on several fronts.\n\nFirst, students do acquire soft skills in formal school settings. One\nstudy found that student achievement on tests accounts for just 20% of\nthe effects of educational attainment on earnings (Bowles, Gintis,\n& Osborne 2001), which indicates that schools are cultivating\nnon-cognitive skills that tests do not measure, and that are\nconsequential in the labor market (Levin 2012). Second, educational\nattainment has long been seen to have a signaling function in the\nlabor market (Spence 1973), whereby employers rely upon job\ncandidates\u2019 educational credentials as a proxy for future\nproductivity. Educational attainment itself, then, apart from\napplicants\u2019 demonstration of particular skills, is central to\nscreening and differentiating candidates. Finally, a college diploma\nhas become especially consequential in recent years as the income gap\nbetween those with and without one has grown; individuals with a\nbachelors degree earn 84% more over their lifetime than those with\njust a high school diploma (see Carnevale, Rose & Cheah 2011).\nLesley Jacobs\u2019 notion of stakes fairness (2004) underscores the\nimportance of equality of educational opportunity when it comes to\npreparation for the labor market. Ideally, the stakes attached to\neducation for labor market success would not be nearly as high as they\nare now, whereby a winner-takes-all competition for a job can\ndetermine an individual\u2019s access to social goods like\nhealthcare, leisure time, and discretionary income. When the\n(non-ideal) stakes are this high, equality of educational opportunity\nmatters all the more (Jacobs 2010).\n",
