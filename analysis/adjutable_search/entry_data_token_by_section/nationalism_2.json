    "main_text": "Varieties of Nationalism || Concepts of Nationalism: Classical and Liberal\n2.1 Concepts of Nationalism: Classical and Liberal\n\nWe pointed out at the very beginning of the entry that nationalism\nfocuses upon (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when\nthey care about their national identity, and (2) the actions that the\nmembers of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) some\nform of political sovereignty. The politically central point is (2):\nthe actions enjoined by the nationalist. To these we now turn,\nbeginning with sovereignty and territory, the usual foci of a national\nstruggle for independence. They raise an important issue:\n\n(2a)\nDoes political sovereignty within or over a territory require\nstatehood or something weaker?\n\n\nThe classical answer is that a state is required. A more liberal\nanswer is that some form of political autonomy suffices. Once this has\nbeen discussed, we can turn to the related normative issues:\n\n(2b)\nWhat actions are morally permitted to achieve sovereignty and to\nmaintain it?\n(2c)\nUnder what conditions is it morally permitted to take actions of\nthis kind?\n\n\nConsider first the classical nationalist answer to\n (2a).\n Political sovereignty requires a state \u201crightfully owned\u201d\nby the ethno-nation (Oldenquist 1997). Developments of this line of\nthought often state or imply specific answers to\n (2b),\n and\n (2c),\n i.e., that in a national independence struggle the use of force\nagainst the threatening central power is almost always a legitimate\nmeans for bringing about sovereignty. However, classical nationalism\nis not only concerned with the creation of a state but also with its\nmaintenance and strengthening.\n\nClassical nationalism is the political program that sees the\ncreation and maintenance of a fully sovereign state owned by a given\nethno-national group (\u201cpeople\u201d or \u201cnation\u201d) as\na primary duty of each member of the group. Starting from the\nassumption that the appropriate (or \u201cnatural\u201d) unit of\nculture is an ethno-nation, it claims that a primary duty of each\nmember is to abide by one\u2019s recognizably ethno-national culture\nin all cultural matters.\n\nClassical nationalists are usually vigilant about the kind of culture\nthey protect and promote and about the kind of attitude people have to\ntheir nation-state. This watchful attitude carries some potential\ndangers: many elements of a given culture that are universal or simply\nnot recognizably national may fall prey to such nationalist\nenthusiasms. Classical nationalism in everyday life puts various\nadditional demands on individuals, from buying more expensive\nhome-produced goods in preference to cheaper imported ones to\nprocreating as many future members of the nation as one can manage\n(see Yuval-Davies 1997, and Yack 2012).\n\nBesides classical nationalism (and its more radical extremist\ncousins), various moderate views are also now classified as\nnationalist. Indeed, the philosophical discussion has shifted to these\nmoderate or even ultra-moderate forms, and most philosophers who\ndescribe themselves as nationalists propose very moderate nationalist\nprograms.\n\nNationalism in this wider sense is any complex of attitudes,\nclaims, and directives for action ascribing a fundamental political,\nmoral, and cultural value to nation and nationality and deriving\nobligations (for individual members of the nation, and for any\ninvolved third parties, individual or collective) from this ascribed\nvalue. The main representative of this group of views is liberal\nnationalism, proposed by authors like Miller, Tamir, and Gans\n(see below).\n\nNationalisms in this wider sense can vary somewhat in their\nconceptions of the nation (which are often left implicit in their\ndiscourse), in the grounds for and degree of its value, and in the\nscope of their prescribed obligations. Moderate nationalism is less\ndemanding than classical nationalism and sometimes goes under the name\nof \u201cpatriotism.\u201d (A different usage, again, reserves\n\u201cpatriotism\u201d for valuing civic community and loyalty to\nstate, in contrast to nationalism, centered on ethnic-cultural\ncommunities).\n\nLet us now turn to liberal nationalism, the most discussed kind of\nmoderate nationalism.\n\nLiberal nationalists see liberal-democratic principles and\npro-national attitudes as belonging together. One of the main\nproponents of the view, Yael Tamir, started the debate in her 1993\nbook and in her recent book talks about the nation-state as \u201can\nideal meeting point between the two\u201d (2019: 6). Of course, some\nthings have to be sacrificed: we must acknowledge that either the\nmeaningfulness of a community or its openness must be sacrificed to\nsome extent as we cannot have them both. (2019: 57). How much of each\nis to give way is left open, and of course, various liberal\nnationalists take different views of what precisely the right answer\nis.\n\nTamir\u2019s version of liberal nationalism is a kind of social\nliberalism, in this respect similar to the views of David Miller who\ntalks about \u201csolidaristic communities\u201d in his 1999 book\nPrinciples of Social Justice and also takes stance in his\n1995 and 2008 books. They both see the feeling of national identity as\na feeling that promotes solidarity, and solidarity as means for\nincreased social justice (Tamir 2019, in particular ch.20; compare\nWalzer 1983, Kymlicka 1995a, 2001, and Gans 2003, 2008).\n\nLiberal nationalists diverge about the value of multiculturalism.\nKymlicka takes it as basic for his picture of liberalism while Tamir\ndismisses it without much ado: multicultural, multiethnic democracies\nhave a very poor track record, she claims (2019: 62). Tamir\u2019s\ndiagnosis of the present day political crisis, with politicians like\nTrump and Le Pen coming to the forefront, is that \u201cliberal\ndemocrats were paralyzed by their assumed victory\u201d whereas\n\u201cnationalists felt defeated and obsolete\u201d (2019: 7).\n\nTamir lists two kinds of reasons that guarantee special political\nstatus to nations. First kind, that no other political entity\n\u201cis more able than the state to promote ideas in the public\nsphere\u201d (2019: 52), and the second kind that nation needs\ncontinuous creative effort to make it functional and attractive.\n\nThe historical development of liberalism turned it into a\nuniversalistic, anti-communitarian principle; this has been a fatal\nmistake that can be and should be corrected by the liberal nationalist\nsynthesis. Can we revive the unifying narratives of our nationality\nwithout sacrificing the liberal inheritance of freedom and rights?\nLiberal nationalism answers in the affirmative. From its standpoint,\nnational particularism has primacy: \u201cThe love of humanity is a\nnoble ideal, but real love is always particular\u2026\u201d (2019:\n68).\n\nInterestingly, Tamir combines this high regard of nation with an\nextreme constructivist view of its nature: nations are mental\nstructures that exist in the minds of their members (2019: 58).\n\nIs liberal nationalism implemented anywhere in the present world, or\nis it more of an ideal, probably end-state theory, that proposes a\npicture of a desirable society? Judging by the writings of liberal\nnationalists, it is the latter, although presented as a relatively\neasily reachable ideal, combining two traditions that are already well\nimplemented in political reality.\n\nThe variations of nationalism most relevant for philosophy are those\nthat influence the moral standing of claims and of recommended\nnationalist practices. The elaborate philosophical views put forward\nin favor of nationalism will be referred to as \u201ctheoretical\nnationalism\u201d, the adjective serving to distinguish such views\nfrom less sophisticated and more practical nationalist discourse. The\ncentral theoretical nationalist evaluative claims can be charted on\nthe map of possible positions within political theory in the following\nuseful but somewhat simplified and schematic way.\n\nNationalist claims featuring the nation as central to political action\nmust answer two crucial general questions. First, is there one kind of\nlarge social group that is of special moral importance? The\nnationalist answer is that there certainly is one, namely, the nation.\nMoreover, when an ultimate choice is to be made, say between ties of\nfamily, or friendship, and the nation, the latter has priority.\nLiberal nationalists prefer a more moderate stance, which ascribes\nvalue to national belonging, but don\u2019t make it central in this\nway. Second, what are the grounds for an individual\u2019s\nobligations to the morally central group? Are they based on voluntary\nor involuntary membership in the group? The typical contemporary\nnationalist thinker opts for the latter, while admitting that\nvoluntary endorsement of one\u2019s national identity is a morally\nimportant achievement. On the philosophical map, pro-nationalist\nnormative tastes fit nicely with the communitarian stance in general:\nmost pro-nationalist philosophers are communitarians who choose the\nnation as the preferred community (in contrast to those of their\nfellow communitarians who prefer more far-ranging communities, such as\nthose defined by global religious\n traditions).[13]\n\nBefore proceeding to moral claims, let us briefly sketch the issues\nand viewpoints connected to territory and territorial rights that are\nessential for nationalist political \n programs.[14] \n Why is territory\nimportant for ethno-national groups, and what are the extent and\ngrounds of territorial rights? Its primary importance resides in\nsovereignty and all the associated possibilities for internal control\nand external exclusion. Add to this the Rousseauian view that\npolitical attachments are essentially bounded and that love \u2014or,\nto put it more mildly, republican civil friendship\u2014for\none\u2019s group requires exclusion of some \u201cother\u201d, and\nthe importance becomes quite obvious. What about the grounds for the\ndemand for territorial rights? Nationalist and pro-nationalist views\nmostly rely on the attachment that members of a nation have to\nnational territory and to the formative value of territory for a\nnation to justify territorial claims (see Miller 2000 and Meisels\n2009). This is similar in some respects to the rationale given by\nproponents of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights (Tully 2004, but see\nalso Hendrix 2008) and in other respects to Kolers\u2019 2009\nethno-geographical non-nationalist theory, but differs in preferring\nethno-national groups as the sole carriers of the right. These\nattachment views stand in stark contrast to more pragmatic views about\nterritorial rights as means for conflict resolution (e.g., Levy 2000).\nAnother quite popular alternative is the family of individualistic\nviews grounding territorial rights in rights and interests of\nindividuals.[15]\n On the extreme end of anti-nationalist views\nstands the idea of Pogge) that there are no specific territorial\nproblems for political philosophy\u2014the \u201cdissolution\napproach\u201d, as Kolers calls it.\n",
