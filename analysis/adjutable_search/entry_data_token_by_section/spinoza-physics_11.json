Spinoza and the experimental and mathematical sciences\n\nAttempts to find anticipations of contemporary scientific physics in\nSpinoza's thinking about the physical face a number of challenges\nbeyond simple anachronism. Contemporary physics is both resolutely\nexperimental and resolutely mathematical. However, there is reason to\nsuppose that Spinoza had dim views of both experimental method in\n science[14]\n and the prospects for an insightful mathematical description of\nnature.\n",
