    "main_text": "Atomism in Nineteenth-Century Physics || The Status of the Kinetic Theory\n5.2 The Status of the Kinetic Theory\n\n\nThe kinetic theory explained known experimental laws and predicted new\nones. That empirical success could not be accommodated by some\ntruncated version of the theory that avoided a commitment to atomism\nin the way that use of chemical formulae could for chemistry. Insofar\nas the kinetic theory explained anything at all, it did so by\nattributing the behaviour of gases to the motions and collisions of\nmolecules. On the other hand, it did face apparent empirical\nrefutations as we have seen. Those wishing to assert the truth of the\nkinetic theory, and hence of an atomic theory, had a case but also\nfaced problems.\n\n\nFor those inclined to judge theories by the extent to which they\nfruitfully guide experiment and lead to the discovery of experimental\nlaws, we get a more qualified appraisal. For two decades or more the\nmature kinetic theory proved to be a fruitful guide as far as the\nexplanation and prediction of experimental laws is concerned. But, in\nthe view of a number of scientists involved at the time, the kinetic\ntheory had ceased to bear fruit for the remainder of the century, as\nClarke (1976, 88\u20139) has stressed.\n It might appear that the success of the kinetic theory marked a\nsuccessful instantiation of the kind of atomism aspired to by the\nmechanical or Newtonian atomists, since macroscopic phenomena are\nexplained in terms of atoms with just a few specified mechanical\nproperties. There are reasons to resist such a view. Firstly, neither\nthe molecules of the kinetic theory nor the atoms composing them were\nultimate particles. As we have noted, it was well appreciated that\nthey needed an inner structure to accommodate spectra. Secondly, it\nwas well apparent that the mechanical properties attributed to\nmolecules by the kinetic theory could not constitute an exhaustive\nlist of those properties. Further properties were required to explain\ncohesion and chemical interaction for instance. Thirdly, and perhaps\nmost fundamentally, the kinetic theory was not an attempt to give an\natomic account of the ultimate structure of matter. Maxwell, for one,\nwas quite clear of the distinction between an atomism that made claims\nabout the ultimate structure of matter for some very general\nmetaphysical reasons, on the one hand, and a specific scientific\ntheory postulating atoms on the other (Niven, 1965, Vol. 2,\n361\u20134). The kinetic theory was an example of the latter insofar\nas it was proposed, not as an ultimate theory, nor as a theory of\nmatter in general, but as a theory designed to explain a specified\nrange of phenomena, in this case the macroscopic behaviour of gases\nand, to a less detailed extent, of liquids and gases too. As such, it\nwas to be judged by the extent it was able to fulfil that task and\nrejected or modified to the extent that it could not. A case for the\nexistence of atoms or molecules and for the properties to be\nattributed to them was to be sought in experimental science rather\nthan philosophy.\n",
