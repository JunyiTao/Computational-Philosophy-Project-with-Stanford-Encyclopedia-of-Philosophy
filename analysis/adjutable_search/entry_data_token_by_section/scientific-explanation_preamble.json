    "main_text": "\n\nIssues concerning scientific explanation have been a focus of\nphilosophical attention from Pre-Socratic times through the modern\nperiod. However, modern discussion really begins with the development\nof the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model. This model has had\nmany advocates (including Popper 1959, Braithwaite 1953, Gardiner,\n1959, Nagel 1961) but unquestionably the most detailed and influential\nstatement is due to Carl Hempel (1942, 1965a, and Hempel & Oppenheim 1948).\nThese papers and the reaction to them have structured subsequent\ndiscussion concerning scientific explanation to an extraordinary\ndegree. After some general remarks by way of background and\norientation\n (Section 1),\n this entry describes the DN model and its extensions, and\nthen turns to some well-known objections\n (Section 2).\n It next describes a variety of subsequent attempts to develop\nalternative models of explanation, including Wesley Salmon\u2019s\nStatistical Relevance\n (Section 3)\n and Causal Mechanical\n (Section 4)\n models, Unificationist models due to Michael Friedman and\nPhilip Kitcher\n (Section 5),\n and Pragmatic theories found in the work of van Fraassen\n (Section 6).\n Section 7 provides a summary and discusses directions for future\nwork. This article thus discusses treatments of scientific explanation\nup to the end of the twentieth century. \n",
