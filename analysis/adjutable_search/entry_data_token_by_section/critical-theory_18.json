    "main_text": "Critical Theories Today\n4. Critical Theories Today\n\nMarx defined critical theory as the \u201cself-clarification of the\nstruggles and wishes of the age\u201d (Marx 1843). The vitality of\nthis approach to critical theory depends on continually taking up this\ntask in new social contexts, as the first generation of the Frankfurt\nSchool did. Contemporary critical theorists continue this legacy by\nengaging with and theorizing in relation to contemporary struggles,\ncrises, and practices. This has meant engaging a much wider range of\nemancipatory social movements than earlier generations of the\nFrankfurt School, who focused more on class struggle and capitalism\n(and the ways these were entangled with antisemitism and fascism)\nwhile largely neglecting issues like colonialism, racism, and the\nsubordination of women. Contemporary critical theorists have expanded\nand enriched the Frankfurt School tradition by engaging with, and in\nsome cases making contributions to, feminist theory, critical race\ntheory, and postcolonial and decolonial theory (4.1), enlarging their\nanalyses of crises beyond capitalism and its contradictions (4.2), and\nexploring a variety of critical practices ranging from civil\ndisobedience to prefigurative, abolitionist, and revolutionary\npractices (4.3).\n",
