    "main_text": "Objections to the MWI || The Wave Function is not Enough\n6.3 The Wave Function is not Enough\n\nAs mentioned above, the gap between the mathematical formalism of the\nMWI, namely the wave function of the Universe, and our experience is\nlarger than in other interpretations. This is the reason why many\nthought that the ontology of the wave function is not enough. Bell\n1987 (p.201) felt that either the wave function is not everything, or\nit is not right. He was looking for a theory with local\n\u201cbeables\u201d. Many followed Bell in search of a\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d in 3+1 space-time, see Allori et\nal. 2014.\n\nA particular reason why the wave function of the Universe cannot be\nthe whole ontology lies in the argument, led by Maudlin 2010, that\nthis is the wrong type of object. The wave function of the Universe\n(considered to have N particles) is defined in 3N dimensional\nconfiguration space, while we need an entity in 3+1 space-time (like\nthe primitive ontology), see discussion by Albert 1996, Lewis 2004,\nMonton 2006, Ney 2021. Addition of \u201cprimitive ontology\u201d to\nthe wave function of the Universe helps us understand our experience,\nbut complicates the mathematical part of the theory. In the framework\nof the MWI, it is not necessary. The expectation values of the density\nof each particle in space-time, which is the concept derived from the\nwave functions corresponding to different worlds, can play the role of\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d. Since interactions between particles\nare local in space, this is what is needed for finding causal\nconnections ending at our experience. The density of particles is\ngauge independent and also properly transforms between different\nLorentz observers such that they all agree upon their experiences. In\nparticular, the explanation of our experience is unaffected by the\n\u201cnarratability failure\u201d problem of Albert 2013: the wave\nfunction description might be different for different Lorentz frames,\nbut the description in terms of densities of particles is the same.\nNote also an alternative approach based on 3+1 space-time by Wallace\nand Timpson 2010 who, being dissatisfied with the wave function\nontology, introduced the formulation of  Spacetime State\nRealism. Recently more works appeared on this subject: Ney and\nAlbert 2013, Myrvold 2015, Gao 2017, Lombardi et al. 2019,\nMaudlin 2019, Chen 2019, Carroll and Singh 2019. These works show\nsignificant difficulties in obtaining our world as emergent from the\nUniversal wave function. This explains the skeptical tone of\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics.\n But, as discussed in Sec.3, the success of the\n\u201cemergence\u201d program is not crucial: it is enough to find\nthe counterpart of the world we experience in the Universal wave\nfunction.\n",
