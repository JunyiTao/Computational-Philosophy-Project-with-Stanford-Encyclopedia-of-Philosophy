    "main_text": "Nature\n3. Nature\n\nThus far we have asked two questions of object: (i) what, if\nany, is its contrast? (ii) what things, if any, are in its extension?\nThese questions might also be phrased as the questions of what\nnon-objects there are and of what objects there are. We turn now to\nour final question: (iii) supposing there are objects, what are they\nlike? What is their nature?\n\nOne way to specify the nature of a category is to note the theoretical\nrole it plays or the role played by items within it. This is to say\nwhat items within the category do. Another is to give a real\ndefinition of the category (or the items within it), where a real\ndefinition attempts to identify the real essence of the members of the\ncategory. This is to say what items of within category are\n(see entries on\n theoretical terms in science\n and\n Locke on real essence\n and the section on real and nominal definitions in the entry on\n definitions).\n\nIn this section, we will consider attempts to state the nature of\nobjects. As with our treatment of the Contrast Question, our\ndiscussion will elide some terminological details. Instead of treating\nonly theories of the nature of objects phrased in precisely those\nterms, we will canvas several attempts to state the nature of nearby\ncategories as well\u2014most notably substance and\nparticular\u2014treating them as giving a theory of the\nnature of objects.\n",
