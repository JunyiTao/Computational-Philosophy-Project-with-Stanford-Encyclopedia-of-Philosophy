    "main_text": "The Emergence of Procedural Rationality\n2. The Emergence of Procedural Rationality\n\nSimon thought the shift in focus from reasoning behavior to choice\nbehavior was a mistake. Since, in the 1950s, little was known about\nthe processes involved in making judgments or reaching decisions, we\nwere not in the position to freely abstract away all of those features\nfrom our mathematical models. Yet, this ignorance of the psychology of\ndecision-making also raised the question of how to proceed. The answer\nwas to attend to the costs in effort from operating a procedure for\nmaking decisions and comparing those costs to the resources available\nto the organism using the procedure and, conversely, to compare how\nwell an organism performs in terms of accuracy\n(section 8.2) with its limited\ncognitive resources in order to investigate models with comparable\nlevels of accuracy within those resource bounds.  Effectively managing\nthe trade-off between the costs and quality of a decision involves\nanother type of rationality, which Simon later called procedural\nrationality (Simon 1976: 69).\n\nIn this section we highlight early, key contributions to modeling\nprocedures for boundedly rational judgment and decision-making,\nincluding the origins of the accuracy-effort trade-off,\nSimon\u2019s satisficing strategy, improper linear\nmodels, and the earliest effort to systematize several features\nof high-level, cognitive judgment and decision-making: cumulative\nprospect theory.\n",
