    "main_text": "Protagoras on the Gods\n4. Protagoras on the Gods\n\nProtagoras\u2019 penchant for sensational statements, capable of\nseizing the public\u2019s attention, is further confirmed by the\nopening of the On the Gods: \n\n\nAbout the gods I am able to know neither that they exist nor that they\ndo not exist nor of what kind they are in form: for many things\nprevent me for knowing this, its obscurity and the brevity of\nman\u2019s life. (80B4 DK; on the text, see Benedetto 2001 and\nCorradi 2017: 445\u2013448) \n\n\nAccording to some ancient sources, this statement had a\ndisproportionate effect: his books were burned in public, while he was\nconvicted in Athens on a charge of atheism and sentenced to death; he\nthen escaped and lost his life in a shipwreck. As already remarked,\nall these anecdotes are probably fictitious, but it is true that the\nsophist was made the object of unanimous and enduring condemnation, to\nthe point of bringing together traditionally antithetical schools of\nthought, such as the Christians and the Epicureans, both concord in\ncondemning his thesis as atheistic (see Diogenes of Oenoanda, 80A23\nDK, and Epiphanius, Against Heresies III 16). As a matter of\nfact, there is no reason to assume a profession of atheism on his\npart, because these hostile sources conflate a confession of ignorance\n(\u201cI do not know that P\u201d) with a profession of\nknowledge (\u201cI know that not-P\u201d). \u201cTo the\nbeliever, agnostics may be as bad as atheists; but to the atheists\nagnostics are not much better than believers\u201d (Barnes 1979:\n449\u2013450). Protagoras is the first thinker to take an agnostic\nstance, which can hardly be understood as an expression of atheism; at\nstake, in the fragment, is not so much an ontological thesis (on the\nexistence of the gods) but an epistemological one (on our knowledge of\nthem; Drozdek 2005: 41). Like in the case of MM, also in this fragment\nthe emphasis seems to fall on the absence of a universal and\nincontrovertible truth.\n\nWhile it is evident that Protagoras\u2019 statement is not a\nprofession of atheism, its overall meaning is less clear. Some\ninterpreters have denied that Protagoras is doubting the existence of\nthe gods in this passage on the ground of a parallel with the use of\nhos in this statement and in the MM: in the latter case, as\nwe have seen, the preposition clearly has a modal meaning; if we\nassume that it was used in the same sense in the former passage, we\nmust conclude that, according to this line of interpretation,\nProtagoras was chiefly interested in the way in which the gods are and\npresent themselves, rather than in their presumed existence or\nnon-existence. Protagoras would thus be claiming that we do not know\n\u201chow\u201d the gods are or are not, and the words that follow\n(\u201cnor of what kind they are in form\u201d) would have an almost\nepexegetic function (or would more concretely refer to the problem of\ntheir visible appearance: see Kerferd 1981a: 165\u2013168). This\nwould imply, then, that Protagoras never raised any doubts as to the\nexistence of the gods (and a different translation of the first clause\nwould follow: \u201cI am able to know neither how they exist nor how\nthey do not exist\u201d). The merit of this reading is that it\nexplains the otherwise inappropriate order of the two clauses: since\nthe first statement argues for agnosticism, it makes no sense to\ndiscuss the problem of the gods\u2019 form. Against it, however, it\nmust be noted that all the ancient sources, from Plato onwards (see\nTheaetetus, 162d), unanimously present Protagoras\u2019\nthesis as though it concerned the existence of the gods. As there are\nno reasons to go against such a solid tradition, it is better to\ninterpret the text as discussing both the existence of the gods\n(\u201cneither that they exist nor that they do not exist\u201d) and\ntheir form (\u201cnor of what kind they are in form\u201d). As for\nthe order of the two clauses, the most reasonable explanation is that,\nlike in the MM fragment, these opening statements, whose primary aim\nwas to attract the attention of the audience, were not meant to be too\nrigorous. To be sure, to begin by professing one\u2019s own ignorance\nis an unconventional choice. Incidentally, it is worth noting that the\nstatement possibly presents the first recorded use of the verb\n\u201cto be\u201d in an existential sense (Kahn 1973: 302).\n\nThe reasons which Protagoras reportedly adduced in support of his\nthesis\u2014the obscurity of the problem and the brevity of human\nlife\u2014have been regarded as too banal, or at any rate not\nparticularly relevant. However, they acquire greater significance when\nviewed in relation to a concept the importance of which has already\nbeen stressed in relation to the MM, namely personal experience: this\nis the only legitimate criterion to verify our knowledge (Mansfeld\n1981). Therefore it seems that also in this case by highlighting the\nlimits of human experience, Protagoras was engaging in a polemic with\nthose Presocratic thinkers, such as Parmenides and Heraclitus, who had\nrepeatedly claimed to be able to transcend the limits of human\nknowledge, as well as the poets, who had based their authority on a\nprivileged contact with the divine world. In this respect, some\ninteresting similarities are to be found between Protagoras and\nXenophanes of Elea (21B34 DK), who also reportedly criticised human\nclaims to know the truth about the gods (significantly, for Xenophanes\ntoo, obscurity is an obstacle to knowledge). The analogies with\nXenophanes become even more striking when we consider the second\nsegment of the first statement, concerning the presumed appearance of\nthe gods. In raising this problem, Protagoras was in all likelihood\nreferring to the anthropomorphic conception, which Xenophanes had\nalready repeatedly censured (see also Herodotus Histories II\n53,1; Sassi 2013).\n\nOne intriguing problem for scholars has been to reconstruct the\nfollow-up to this text. It is difficult to imagine that, after a\nstatement of this sort, Protagoras continued to speak at length about\nthe gods. The structure of the sentence (and in particular the\npresence of the particle men, which implies a contrasting\nde) suggests that the author shifted his attention onto man:\nfor the Greeks, the notions of god and man were mutually defining. It\nis likely, therefore, that in the continuation of the text, Protagoras\ndiscussed not the problem of the gods in itself, but rather the issue\nof what they represent for man, thereby inaugurating an\nanthropological and sociological approach that considers religion in\nterms of its function for human civilisation and society (Jaeger 1947:\n176). This hypothesis is no doubt more persuasive than the alternative\nhypothesis that the text was then devoted to a critique of religious\nbeliefs or, on the contrary, that the acknowledgement of human\nweakness was intended to pave the way to an expression of piety and\nreverence for the unknowable nature of the gods. What is less\nconvincing is the way in which this hypothesis has been developed.\nFrom Jaeger onwards, scholars have believed that, while leaving the\nproblem of the actual existence of the gods open, Protagoras\ncelebrated their importance for human civilisation in the sense that\nreligious beliefs and sentiments played a decisive role in the\ndevelopment of human civilisation. Given the silence of this fragment,\nthis hypothesis is based on the myth that Protagoras relates in the\ndialogue named after him, where mention is made of these beliefs. Yet\nwhat may be inferred from the myth is rather the very opposite (see\n \u00a75,\n for a detailed analysis of this testimony). In the myth, Protagoras\nacknowledges the importance of belief in the gods as something\nspecifically and universally human; but the very moment he\nacknowledges the presence of the religious dimension, he de\nfacto limits its importance by implying that this belief (or\nfear) is not enough to provide a foundation for human society. What\nensures that men can live together in cities is rather politics.\nProtagoras\u2019 agnosticism is therefore instrumental towards his\nradical humanism, which is also attested in the MM fragment and in the\nmyth of Prometheus.\n",
