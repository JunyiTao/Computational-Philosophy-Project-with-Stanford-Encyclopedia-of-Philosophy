Some kinds of truth definition on the 1933 pattern\n\nIn his 1933 paper Tarski went on to show that many fully interpreted\nformal languages do have a truth definition that satisfies his\nconditions. He gave four examples in that paper. One was a trivial\ndefinition for a finite language; it simply listed the finitely many\ntrue sentences. One was a definition by quantifier elimination; see\nSection 2.2 below. The remaining two, for different classes of\nlanguage, were examples of what people today think of as the standard\nTarski truth definition; they are forerunners of the 1956\nmodel-theoretic definition.\n",
