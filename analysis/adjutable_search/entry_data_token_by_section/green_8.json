    "main_text": "Idealist Ethics || Self-Realization and Normative Perfectionism\n3.2 Self-Realization and Normative Perfectionism\n\nGreen develops his ideas about the personal good in Book III of the\nProlegomena. There he criticizes hedonism and develops his\nown perfectionist claims. Hedonism can be a psychological doctrine or\nan evaluative doctrine about the personal good. Green\u2019s\ndiscussion of hedonism focuses on the utilitarian tradition,\nespecially the views of Mill and Sidgwick. Green thinks that Mill\ncombines psychological and evaluative hedonism, though that is\ndisputable (Brink 2013: chs. 2\u20133). Sidgwick clearly\ndistinguishes the two forms of hedonism, rejecting psychological\nhedonism and defending evaluative hedonism. Since Sidgwick explicitly\naccepts evaluative hedonism while rejecting psychological hedonism,\nGreen must argue differently against Sidgwick.\n\nGreen agrees with Butler that psychological egoism (hedonism) is\nimplausible but thinks that people mistakenly accept it because they\nmistake the pleasure that can be expected to attend the satisfaction\nof desires for the object of desire. Because the pleasure is\nconsequential on the satisfaction of desire, the object of desire\ncannot be that pleasure. This point is relevant, Green thinks, to\nMill\u2019s alleged evaluative hedonism (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7162\u201369). Green notes that in Mill\u2019s higher\npleasures doctrine and in the proof that Mill seems to assign\nintrinsic value to objective pleasures, that is, to activities and\npursuits that exercise our higher capacities. Green thinks that these\nclaims about the superior value of such activities are\nanti-hedonistic, but he thinks that Mill fails to see this only\nbecause he focuses on the (subjective) pleasure that is expected from\nengaging in such activities. But this confuses, Green thinks, what we\nvalue and a by-product of what we value.\n\nGreen focuses on Mill\u2019s explanation of the preferences of\ncompetent judges for modes of existence that employ their higher\nfaculties. Higher pleasures are those things (e.g., activities) that a\ncompetent judge would prefer, even if they produced less pleasure in\nher than the lower pleasures would (Mill Utilitarianism II 5\nin Works X 211). But why should competent judges\nprefer activities that they often find less pleasurable unless they\nbelieve that these activities are more valuable? Mill explains the\nfact that competent judges prefer activities that exercise their\nrational capacities by appeal to their sense of dignity\n(Utilitarianism II 5 in Works X 212). Green thinks\nthat the dignity passage undermines hedonism (PE\n\u00a7164\u201366, 171). In claiming that it is the dignity of a life\nin which the higher capacities are exercised and the competent\njudge\u2019s sense of her own dignity that explains her preference\nfor those activities, Mill implies that her preferences reflect\njudgments about the value that these activities have independently of\ntheir being the object of desire or the source of pleasure. We take\npleasure in these activities because we recognize their value; they\nare not valuable, because they are pleasurable.\n\nGreen not only criticizes the evaluative hedonism he finds in Mill; he\nalso rejects evaluative hedonism outright. One argument he makes is\nthat evaluative hedonism is actually inconsistent with psychological\nhedonism. Evaluative hedonism says that our ultimate aim ought to be\nto maximize net pleasure or to seek the largest sum of pleasures,\nwhereas psychological hedonism claims that pleasurable experience is\nthe ultimate object of desire. But a sum of pleasures is not itself a\npleasure, and so, according to psychological hedonism, we could not\nact on the requirements of evaluative hedonism (PE\n\u00a7221). This may be a problem for someone who combines both\nevaluative and psychological hedonisms. However, this is not a problem\nfor an evaluative hedonist such as Sidgwick who eschews psychological\nhedonism (PE \u00a7\u00a7222, 334, 351). Green must offer\nsome other argument against the person who thinks a self-conscious\nagent would identify his personal good with pleasure. Green\u2019s\nreal disagreement with Sidgwick concerns whether the only things\nreflectively desirable for an agent are her own states of\nconsciousness. Green recognizes \u201cideal goods\u201d for an agent\nthat involve her own activities and her relations to other members of\nher community (PE \u00a7\u00a7159\u201361, 357; cf.\nMethods 113\u201315).\n\nGreen argues not only against hedonism but also for self-realization.\nHe suggests that it is the very capacities that make moral\nresponsibility possible in the first place that determine the proper\nend of deliberation (PE \u00a7176). Responsible action\ninvolves self-consciousness and is expressive of the self. The self is\nnot to be identified with any desire or any series or set of desires;\nmoral personality consists in the ability to subject appetites and\ndesires to a process of deliberative endorsement and to form new\ndesires as the result of such deliberations. So the self essentially\nincludes deliberative capacities, and if responsible action expresses\nthe self, it must exercise these deliberative capacities. This\nexplains why Green thinks that the proper aim of deliberation is a\nlife of activities that embody rational or deliberative control of\nthought and action (PE \u00a7\u00a7175, 180, 199, 234,\n238\u201339, 247, 283).\n\nOne can ask about any conception of the good why one should care about\nthe good, so conceived. Why should the good, so conceived, be\nnormative? Green\u2019s defense of self-realization makes the content\nof the good consist in the exercise of the very same capacities that\nmake one a rational agent, subject to reasons for action, in the first\nplace. This promises to explain why a rational agent should care about\nthe good conceived in terms of self-realization.\n\nThis justification of self-realization also explains why Green treats\nthe imperative of self-realization as a categorical imperative. Like\nKant, Green seeks an account of the agent\u2019s duties that is\ngrounded in her agency and does not depend upon contingent and\nvariable inclinations. The goal of self-realization, Green thinks,\nmeets this demand.\n\n\nAt the same time, because it [self-realization] is the fulfilment of\nhimself, of that which he has in him to be, it will excite an interest\nin him like no other interest, different in kind from any of his\ndesires and aversions except such as are derived from it. It will be\nan interest as in an object conceived to be of unconditional value;\none of which the value does not depend on any desire that the\nindividual may at any time feel for it or for anything else, or on any\npleasure that \u2026 he may experience\u2026.[T]he desire for the\nobject will be founded on a conception of its desirableness as a\nfulfilment of the capabilities of which a man is conscious in being\nconscious of himself. \u2026 [Self-realization] will express itself\nin [the] imposition \u2026 of rules requiring something to be done\nirrespectively of any inclination to do it, irrespectively of any\ndesired end to which it is a means, other than this end, which is\ndesired because conceived as absolutely desirable. (PE\n\u00a7193)\n\n\nBecause the demands of self-realization depend only on those very\ndeliberative capacities that make one a responsible agent, they are\ncategorical imperatives.\n\nGreen recognizes that his conception of the good in terms of\nself-realization and perfection is abstract and perhaps vague in\ncomparison with the apparent definiteness of the hedonist\u2019s\nconception of the good (PE \u00a7193). Nonetheless, his\nconception of the good in terms of self-realization or the exercise of\ndeliberative capacities is not empty.\n",
