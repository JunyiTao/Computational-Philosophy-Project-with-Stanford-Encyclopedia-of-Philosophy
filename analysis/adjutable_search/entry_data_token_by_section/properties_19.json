Properties in the Metaphysics of Science\n\nWhen it comes to the metaphysical underpinnings of scientific\ntheories, properties play a prominent role: it appears that science\ncan hardly be done without appealing to them. This adds up to the case\nfor realism about properties and to our understanding of them. We\nshall illustrate this here first by dwelling on some miscellaneous\ntopics and then by focusing on a debate regarding the very nature of\nthe properties invoked in science, namely whether or not they are\nessentially dispositional. Roughly, an object exemplifies a\ndispositional property, such as soluble or\nfragile, by having a power or disposition to act or being\nacted upon in a certain way in certain conditions. For example, a\nglass\u2019 disposition of being fragile consists in its\npossibly shattering in certain conditions (e.g., if struck with a\ncertain force). In contrast, something exemplifies a\ncategorical property, e.g., made of salt or\nspherical, by merely being in a certain way (see entry on\n dispositions).\n",
