    "main_text": "Selected Existence Questions || Two-Dimensional Isotopes of Boolean Connectives (Longer Example 7)\n4.7 Two-Dimensional Isotopes of Boolean Connectives (Longer Example 7) \n\nCould there exist a connective #\u2032 which, when appearing outside\nof the scope of some specified range of operators \u2013 typically,\nnon-Boolean connectives \u2013 behaves just like a given Boolean\nconnective #, while behaving differently from # when occurring within\nthe scope of one of the operators in the range in question?\nUnderstanding all of this as happening under the aegis of some\nparticular consequence relation, on which more will be said in the\nfollowing paragraph, the situation envisaged would be like this. A\n#\u2032-compound would be equivalent to a #-compound of the same\ncomponents, each compound having the other as a consequence by the\nrelevant consequence relation, without being synonymous with that\ncompound (synonymy as explained in Section\n 1).\n The remainder of this example assumes some familiarity with the basic\nmodal logic of \u201cactually\u201d. The semantics of this logic can\nbe presented, as in the first two pages of Davies and Humberstone\n(1980), using models with a distinguished point (or world), with a\nformula A\u03c6 evaluated as true at any point in the model\njust in case \u03c6 is true at the distinguished point. The\ngenerally valid formulas are then those true every point in\nall such models, and the generally valid sequents are those for which\ntruth is preserved from left to right at each point in all such\nmodels. The real-world valid formulas (sequents) are those\nwhich are true (resp. truth-preserving) at the distinguished point in\nall models.\n\nAlternatively, the semantics can be reformulated so that the models\nfeature no such privileged point and truth (in a model) is relativized\nto a pair of points, one of which plays the \u2018real world\u2019\nrole formerly played by the distinguished element, the other playing\nthe role of the world of at which the formula is being locally\nevaluated, as in notes 4 and 16 of Davies and Humberstone (1980).\nGeneral validity is a matter of truth or its preservation relative to\narbitrary such pairs in all models, and diagonal validity (as\nreal-world validity is often suggestively called in this setting)\nattends instead only to pairs whose first and second coordinates\ncoincide. On either style of presentation, the formulation in terms of\nsequents gives a consequence relation in the obvious way, and for\npresent purposes the following terminology will be convenient.\nFormulas will be said to be diagonally equivalent when each\nis a consequence of the other by the consequence relation capturing\ndiagonal (or \u2018real-world\u2019) validity and to be\nunrestrictedly equivalent when this holds instead for the\ngeneral consequence relation. (We avoid the phrase \u201cgenerally\nequivalent\u201d, since it is hard not to hear this as meaning\n\u201cequivalent, for the most part\u201d; this terminology is\nadapted from the reference to general consequence on p.\u00a015 of\nFusco 2015 as unrestricted consequence.) The current distinction\nbetween diagonal and unrestricted equivalence provides a useful formal\nmodeling of Dummett\u2019s well-known distinction between sameness of\nassertive (or assertoric) content, on the one hand, and sameness of\ningredient sense on the\n other.[50]\n The idea of applying such a contrast to the case of specific pairs of\nconnectives \u2013 as with the #, #\u2032 pairs from the start of\nthe preceding paragraph \u2013 appears, however, to be new with Fusco\n(2015), to which we turn presently. The consequence relation in play\nin the #, #\u2032 discussion above is taken as the diagonal\nconsequence relation (with the associated relation of weak\nequivalence), according to which these connectives are\nnon-congruential, providing for mutual consequence without synonymy,\nrather than the finer-grained general consequence relation (associated\nwith unrestricted equivalence). The latter consequence relation is\ncongruential, but at the cost of not directly reflecting the felt\na priori equivalence of A\u03c6 with \u03c6.\n\nThe aspect of Fusco (2015) of present concern is the treatment of\ndisjunction, with special reference to the problems with which it is\nassociated in deontic logic \u2013 such as Ross\u2019s Paradox, and\nthe representation of Free Choice permission. The issue is discussed\nfurther in Section 3 of Fusco (2019). (For general background,\nincluding these problems, see McNamara 2019; more detail on the\nspecifically disjunction-related issues arising is provided in Aloni\n2016.) Fusco (2015) argues, on grounds we do not go into here (since\nthey involve several parts of an elaborate theory of deontic notions),\nthat these problems of deontically embedded \u201cor\u201d in\nEnglish (and corresponding vocabulary in other natural languages) are\nbest treated rendering it formally by means of \u201c or\n\u201d, with \u03c6 or\n\u03c8 defined as:\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2192 \u03c6) \u2227\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 \u03c8) \u2227\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nThis is a suggested definition, at least for \u03c6, \u03c8, constructed\nusing just Boolean connectives, from a planned sequel to Fusco (2015)\nand (2019), spelling out in the object language a semantic\ncharacterization supplied in the first of those papers. An\nunrestrictedly equivalent definition (or more accurately, definiens)\nwhich some readers may prefer is the following:\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2227 \u03c8) \u2228\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nBy contrast, instances of the following schema, giving the treatment\nof \u201cwhether \u03c6 or \u03c8 \u201d in Lewis (1982) for Boolean\n\u03c6, \u03c8 (though not in general, as explained in the last\nparagraph of note 51 below), would only be diagonally equivalent to the\ncorresponding instances of the above pair:\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228 (A\u03c8 \u2227\n\u03c8).\n\n\nSo as to have concrete formulas to discuss, consider the instances of\nthese three schemata with distinct sentence letters p and\nq taken as \u03c6 and \u03c8, respectively, and we will now use\n(1)\u2013(3) to refer to these concrete instances. The first pair are\nunrestrictedly equivalent and all three are diagonally equivalent,\nwith (3) having (1) and (2) as general consequences though not\n conversely.[51]\n All are diagonally equivalent to the Boolean disjunction p\n\u2228 q, which we may put by saying that all are\ntwo-dimensional isotopes of the one-dimensional, i.e.\nA-free, formula p \u2228 q, or, more\nusefully, that their respective equivalence classes w.r.t. the\nrelation of unrestricted equivalence, stand in this\n\u2018isotope\u2019 relation. Similarly, we can speak of the (in the\nabove presentation, derived) connective or\nas a two-dimensional isotope of the Boolean \u2228,\nthinking of the formula (2) as a context of the variables p,\nq. (On the other hand, what is referred to in note 51  as Groenendijk\u2013Stokhof\u2019s \u201cor\u201d\nis not a two-dimensional isotope of\nBoolean disjunction, p\u00a0or\u00a0q,\nso understood, being diagonally\nequivalent to a Boolean tautology, rather than to\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q.)\n\nWhat is the point of considering such two-dimensional isotopes of\nBoolean disjunction? Fusco\u2019s idea is the following. Arguably,\npeople have thought that the correct treatment of inclusive\n\u201cor\u201d in English is given by (Boolean) \u201c\u2228\u201d,\nonce they have learned to diagnose as pragmatic distraction any\napparent anomalies, because this simple connective with its\ntruth-functional semantics captures the way \u201cor\u201d behaves\nwhen it appears unembedded (or only \u2018Booleanly\u2019 embedded).\nThe presumption has then been that any residual anomalies arising from\nproblematic embeddings will be eventually also then be explained away\npragmatically. But what if we had on our hands a two-dimensional\nisotope of \u2228 that was specially hand-crafted to deal with these\nanomalies, such as Fusco\u2019s or? The\nunembedded behaviour of \u2228 and or, in view\nof the diagonal equivalence of compounds formed using the two\ndisjunctions, would be the same, so or-disjunction\nwould have all the benefits of\nBoolean disjunction without the drawback of not faring very\nsatisfactorily when appearing in the scope of certain intensional\noperators. On this matter of agreement in logical behaviour when\nunembedded, consider, for example, the introduction and elimination\nrules in a natural deduction system. What they introduce or eliminate\nis the main connective of a formula, so they would not differ in their\nintuitive acceptability in the case of \u201cor\u201d whether this\nwas rendered as Boolean disjunction \u2228 or as Fusco\u2019s\ntwo-dimensional or\n connective.[52]\n More generally, the conditions defining \u2228-classicality (indeed\n#-classicality for any #) of consequence relations or generalized\nconsequence relations pertain only to unembedded occurrences of \u2228\n(or more generally of #). In the case of Fusco (2015), the obligation\noperator O is interpreted by universal quantification over\nsuitably accessible points with the relata of this relation being the\nworlds of local evaluation rather than the world taken as the actual\nworld, which remains the same, so while p\u00a0or\u00a0q\nis a diagonal (though not a\ngeneral) consequence of p, O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis not a diagonal consequence of\n Op.[53]\n Putting it very informally, this is because from the perspective of\nsome world of evaluation, w, with w itself\nconsidered as actual (since we are working the diagonal case), every\nworld deontically accessible to w, qua world of evaluation,\nmay be a p-world, whereas at w if what is true is\nq but not p, then what is required for the truth at\nw of O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis that all the accessible\nworlds be q-worlds, since in moving out to the\nw-accessible worlds we are not changing the status of\nw as the world playing the actual world role. (We are in the\n\u2018middle disjunct\u2019 case of (2) with this example.) This\nillustrates how Fusco has arranged matters so that\np\u00a0or\u00a0q and\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q end up exhibiting the same\nbehaviour when unembedded but differing behaviour when embedded\n\u2013 in the present instance, in the scope of the obligation\noperator. The story with the permissibility operator, written as may\nor M in Fusco (2015), and not there\ntreated as dual to O, is more complicated, so the interested\nreader is referred to that discussion for the details as well as the\nmotivation behind the choice of or in this\nsetting. For present purposes, the main point to stress is the general\nstrategy of using the two-dimensional semantics to model differences\nin ingredient sense compatible with a given assertoric content.\n\nOne may wonder how much room for manoeuvre is made available by this\ngeneral strategy, which, since are concentrating on connectives here,\namounts to asking how many two-dimensional isotopes a given Boolean\nconnective has. A simpler case than that of the binary connectives\nwith which we have been preoccupied is that of the one-place\nconnectives. A \u2018unarized\u2019 version of the whether\nfeaturing in (3) above arises by choosing the case in which \u03c8 is\n\u00ac\u03c6. This can be written more simply as\nA\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6, used (in effect) as the\ndefinition of what was written as O\u03c6 on p. 119 of\nHumberstone (2002). (There is no intention, in using\n\u201cO\u201d here, to evoke any deontic associations.) If\nwe took O as primitive, we could instead define A by\ntaking A\u03c6 to abbreviate\nO\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6 if we wanted. Either way, if an\nepistemic operator K is treated in the same way semantically\nas the deontic obligation operator above (though with its own\naccessibility relation, of course, or even just using neighbourhood\nsemantics here, as in Lewis 1982, p.\u00a0202), then for purely\nBoolean \u03c6, KO\u03c6, alias\nK(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6) ends up\nunrestrictedly equivalent to\n(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u03c6)\u00a0\u2228\u00a0(A\u00ac\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u00ac\u03c6)\nand thus not a bad approximation to something saying that our\ncognitive subject knows whether (or not)\n \u03c6.[54]\n\nOur main concern here, though, is with formulas constructed just using\nA and the Boolean connectives, and in particular, since we\nare considering the 1-place case, with such formulas as can be\nconstructed with the aid of these devices and a single sentence\nletter, p, say. To see how many two-dimensional isotopes a\ngiven 1-ary Boolean connective (equivalently, Boolean formula in just\none variable) might have, since there are only four such connectives\n(or formulas), to within equivalence \u2013 and for these formulas\nthere is of course no contrast between diagonal and unrestricted\nequivalence \u2013 we should ask how many equivalence classes w.r.t.\nthe relation of unrestricted equivalence there are of the one-variable\n\u2018two-dimensional formulas\u2019 (i.e., here, just\nBoolean-with-A formulas). This question is easy to answer if\nwe bear the following things in mind: first, that every formula is\nunrestrictedly equivalent to one in which A occurs, if at\nall, then just immediately before a sentence letter, and secondly,\nthat w.r.t. the general consequence relation, the formulas p\nand Ap are completely independent (by contrast with the\ndiagonal consequence relation, w.r.t. which they are equivalent). Thus\nthe (unrestricted) equivalence-classes of one-variable formulas\ncollectively manifest the same Boolean algebraic structure as do the\nequivalence classes of purely Boolean two-variable formulas. So you\ncan take your favourite Hasse diagram of this 16-element Boolean\nalgebra[55]\n and, leaving all occurrences\nof p intact, replace every occurrence of q with\nAp, and you now have a picture of all the two-dimensional\none-variable formulas (to within unrestricted equivalence) and the\nlogical relations among them. Each of these 16 equivalence classes (or\nany of the formulas in such a class) is a two-dimensional isotope of\nthe Boolean equivalence class (or any of its elements) we get by\nerasing all occurrences of A in the formulas it contains.\nThus the two-dimensional formulas p, Ap, and\nOp most recently encountered, including the first as a\ndegenerate case of a two-dimensional formula for a streamlined\naccount, are two-dimensional isotopes of p, p, and\np\u00a0\u2194\u00a0p (or \u22a4), respectively. You\nwill find that each element of the 4-element Boolean algebra has four\ndistinct elements of the 16-element algebra mapped to it by this\nerasure-of-A mapping. (This would usually be put by speaking\nof the principal congruence generated by identifying\np\u2019s equivalence class with Ap\u2019s \u2013\nalias q\u2019s \u2013 equivalence class: the smallest\ncongruence relation w.r.t. which these two elements of the algebra are\ncongruent.) For example, p (or its equivalence class) has, to\nwithin unrestricted equivalence, the four two-dimensional isotopes\np\u00a0\u2227\u00a0Ap, the logically strongest\nisotope w.r.t. general consequence (lowest in the 16-element algebra)\nand p\u00a0\u2228\u00a0Ap, the weakest isotope\n(highest in the 16-element algebra), and between these two (and\nmutually incomparable), p and Ap. \n\nReturning to the case of binary connectives or two-variable\ntwo-dimensional formulas, we could reason similarly. (The interested\nreader is left to work the general n-variable case.)\n216 = 65,536 is the number of equivalence classes of\n4-variable formulas, the exponent 16 here being chosen as\n24, the number of equivalence classes of 2-variable\nformulas. So if the variables are p, q, r,\ns, when we collapse the former Boolean algebra into the\nlatter by identifying r with p (thinking of\nr as Ap) and s with q (thinking of\ns as Aq) we are moving from 65,536 elements to 16,\nand a similarly equitable distribution renders each element of the\n16-element algebra as the image of 65,536/16 elements of the larger\nalgebra, which equals 4096 (= 212 = 216/\n24). There is a simpler route to this conclusion, and that\nis by consideration of such Stalnaker-inspired matrices as feature in\nFusco\u2019s discussion (see note 51). This is a 4-by-4 matrix since\nwe have to take into account the local (\u2018world of\nevaluation\u2019) truth-value and the actual truth-value of the first\ncomponent (four possible combinations) of a binary compound and\nsimilarly for the second component, and reading down the diagonal\ngives the truth-table for the Boolean connective of which the original\nis a two-dimensional isotope. Thus in Fusco\u2019s case, this\ndescending diagonal reads \u201cT, T, T, F\u201d, just like the\ndescending vertical column of a familiar truth-table as conventionally\ndisplayed. The latter feature is retained however we label with Ts and\nFs (or 1s and 0s if preferred) the non-diagonal cells, of which there\nare 12 (16 minus the four on the diagonal). Since each of these cells\ncan be filled with either a T or an F, so we are back calculating\n212 and getting the answer 4096, whichever binary\ntruth-function our original diagonal had displayed, including of\ncourse that associated with \u2228. Thus, if you like Fusco\u2019s\ngeneral strategy for responding to difficulties like those faced by\nwhat seemed to be Boolean disjunction behaving badly when deontically\nembedded, there is plenty of room to tweak the details of her proposed\nsolution. \n",
