Finite Iteration\n\nMany of the situations that are alleged to have the structure of the\nPD, like defense appropriations of military rivals or price setting\nfor duopolistic firms, are better modeled by an iterated version of\nthe game in which players play the PD repeatedly, retaining access at\neach round to the results of all previous rounds. In these iterated\nPDs (hence forth IPDs) players who defect in one round can be\n\u201cpunished\u201d by defections in subsequent rounds and those\nwho cooperate can be rewarded by cooperation. Thus the appropriate\nstrategy for rationally self-interested players is no longer obvious.\nThe theoretical answer to this question, it turns out, depends\nstrongly on the definition of IPD employed and the knowledge\nattributed to rational players.\n\nAn IPD can be represented in extensive form by a tree diagram like the\none for the farmer's dilemma above.\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nHere we have an IPD of length two. The end of each of the two rounds\nof the game is marked by a dotted vertical line. The payoffs to each\nof the two players (obtained by adding their payoffs for the two\nrounds) are listed at the end of each path through the tree. The\nrepresentation differs from the previous one in that the two nodes on\neach branch within the same division mark simultaneous choices by the\ntwo players. Since neither player knows the move of the other at the\nsame round, the IPD does not qualify as one of the game theorist's\nstandard \u201cgames of perfect information.\u201d If the players\nmove in succession rather than simultaneously (which we might indicate\nby removing the dotted vertical lines), the resulting game is an\niterated farmer's dilemma, which does meet the game theorist's\ndefinition and which shares many of the features that make the IPD\ninteresting.\n\nLike the farmer's dilemma, an IPD can, in theory, be represented in\nnormal form by taking the players' moves to be strategies\ntelling them how to move if they should reach any node at the end of a\nround of the game tree. The number of strategies increases very\nrapidly with the length of the game so that it is impossible in\npractice to write out the normal form for all but the shortest IPD's.\nEvery pair of strategies determines a \u201cplay\u201d of the game,\ni.e., a path through the extensive-form tree.\n\nIn a game like this, the notion of nash equilibrium loses some of its\nprivileged status. Recall that a pair of moves is a nash equilibrium\nif each is a best reply to the other. Let us extend the notation used\nin the discussion of the asynchronous PD and let \\(\\bDu\\) be the\nstrategy that calls for defection at every node of an IPD. It is easy\nto see that \\(\\bDu\\) and \\(\\bDu\\) form a nash equilibrium. But against\n\\(\\bDu\\), a strategy that calls for defection unless the other player\ncooperated at, say, the fifteenth node, would determine the same play\n(and therefore the same payoffs) as \\(\\bDu\\) itself does. The\ncomponents that call for cooperation never come into play, because the\nother player does not cooperate on the fifteenth (or any other) move.\nSimilarly, a strategy calling for cooperation only after the second\ncooperation by itself does equally well. Thus these strategies and\nmany others form nash equilibria with \\(\\bDu\\). There is a sense in\nwhich these strategies are clearly not equally rational. Although they\nyield the same payoffs at the nodes along the path representing the\nactual play, they would not yield the same payoffs if other nodes had\nbeen reached. If Player One had cooperated in the past, that\nwould still provide no good reason for him to cooperate now. A nash\nequilibrium requires only that the two strategies are best replies to\neach other as the game actually develops. A stronger solution concept\nfor extensive-form games requires that the two strategies would still\nbe best replies to each other no matter what node on the game tree\nwere reached. This notion of subgame-perfect equilibrium is\ndefined and defended in Selten 1975. It can be expressed by saying\nthat the strategy-pair is a nash equilibrium for every subgame of the\noriginal game, where a subgame is the result of taking a node of the\noriginal game tree as the root, pruning away everything that does not\ndescend from it.\n\nGiven this new, stronger solution concept, we can ask about the\nsolutions to the IPD. There is a significant theoretical difference on\nthis matter between IPDs of fixed, finite length, like the one\npictured above, and those of infinite or indefinitely finite length.\nIn games of the first kind, one can prove by an argument known as\nbackward induction that \\(\\bDu\\), \\(\\bDu\\) is the only\nsubgame perfect equilibrium. Suppose the players know the game will\nlast exactly \\(n\\) rounds. Then, no matter what node have been\nreached, at round \\(n-1\\) the players face an ordinary\n(\u201cone-shot\u201d) PD, and they will defect. At round \\(n-2\\)\nthe players know that, whatever they do now, they will both defect at\nthe next round. Thus it is rational for them to defect now as well. By\nrepeating this argument sufficiently many times, the rational players\ndeduce that they should defect at every node on the tree. Indeed,\nsince at every node defection is a best response to any move, there\ncan be no other subgame-perfect equilibria.\n\nIn practice, there is not a great difference between how people behave\nin long fixed-length IPDs (except in the final few rounds) and those\nof indeterminate length. This suggests that some of the rationality\nand common knowledge assumptions used in the backward induction\nargument (and elsewhere in game theory) are unrealistic. There is a\nconsiderable literature attempting to formulate the argument\ncarefully, examine its assumptions, and to see how relaxing\nunrealistic assumptions might change the rationally acceptable\nstrategies in the PD and other games of fixed length. (For a small\nsample, see Bovens, Kreps and Wilson, Pettit and Sugden, Sobel 1993\nand Binmore 1997).\n\nPlayer One's belief that there is a slight chance that Two might\npursue an \u201cirrational\u201d strategy other than continual\ndefection could make it rational for her to cooperate frequently\nherself. Indeed, even if One were certain of Two's rationality, One's\nbelief that there was some chance that Two believed she harbored such\ndoubts could have the same effect. Thus the argument for continual\ndefection in the IPD of fixed length depends on complex iterated\nclaims of certain knowledge of rationality. An even more unrealistic\nassumption, noted by Rabinowicz and others, is that each player\ncontinue to believe that the other will choose rationally on the next\nmove even after evidence of irrational play on previous moves. For\nexample, it is assumed that, at the node reached after a long series\nof moves (\\(\\bC\\), \\(\\bC\\)), \u2026,(\\(\\bC\\), \\(\\bC\\)), Player One\nwill choose \\(\\bD\\) despite never having done so before.\n\nSome have used these kinds of observation to argue that the backward\ninduction argument shows that standard assumptions about rationality\n(with other plausible assumptions) are inconsistent or self-defeating.\nFor (with plausible assumptions) one way to ensure that a rational\nplayer will doubt one's own rationality is to behave irrationally. In\nthe fixed-length IPD, for example, Player One may be able to deduce\nthat, if she were to follow an appropriate \u201cirrational\u201d\nstrategy, Player Two would rationally react so that they can achieve\nmutual cooperation in almost all rounds. So our assumptions seem to\nimply both that Player One should continually defect and that she\nwould do better if she didn't. (See Skyrms 1990, pp. 125\u2013139 and\nBicchieri 1989.)\n",
