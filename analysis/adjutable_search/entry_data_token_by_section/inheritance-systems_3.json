    "main_text": "Introduction || Variation, Hereditary Variation, and Inheritance Systems\n1.4 Variation, Hereditary Variation, and Inheritance Systems\n\nA fundamental requirement for evolutionary change via natural\nselection is the existence of variation in the population.\nHowever, for variations to have evolutionary effect they need to be\n(at least partly) hereditary or heritable (see entry on\n heritability;\n I will here focus on hereditary variations and hereditary\ntransmissibility as defined above, and will not discuss the notion of\nheritability which is a population term). It is hereditary\nvariations that fuel evolution through natural selection\n(Lewontin 1970, 1985). Thus, if we aim to give a general account of\npossible evolutionary change we may start by examining and classifying\nhereditary variations (Jablonka & Lamb 2005). Hereditary\nvariation, in turn, may be accounted for in terms of inheritance\nmechanisms, hence by accounts of inheritance systems. As a\nstarting point we can understand the notion of inheritance system as\nreferring to mechanisms, processes, and participating factors, that\nare involved in transmission between parents and offspring leading to\nhereditary relations. Several influential accounts of inheritance\nsystems that are of philosophical interest are discussed in\n section 3.\n",
