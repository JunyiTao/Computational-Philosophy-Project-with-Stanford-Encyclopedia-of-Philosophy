    "main_text": "The Main Interpretations\n3. The Main Interpretations\n\nBroadly speaking, there are arguably three main concepts of\nprobability:\n\nAn epistemological concept, which is meant to measure objective\nevidential support relations. For example, \u201cin light of the\nrelevant seismological and geological data, California will\nprobably experience a major earthquake this\ndecade\u201d.\nThe concept of an agent\u2019s degree of confidence, a graded\nbelief. For example, \u201cI am not sure that it will rain in\nCanberra this week, but it probably will.\u201d\nA physical concept that applies to various systems in the world,\nindependently of what anyone thinks. For example, \u201ca particular\nradium atom will probably decay within 10,000\nyears\u201d.\n\n\nSome philosophers will insist that not all of these concepts are\nintelligible; some will insist that one of them is basic, and that the\nothers are reducible to it. Moreover, the boundaries between these\nconcepts are somewhat permeable. After all, \u2018degree of\nconfidence\u2019 is itself an epistemological concept, and as we will\nsee, it is thought to be rationally constrained both by evidential\nsupport relations and by attitudes to physical probabilities in the\nworld. And there are intramural disputes within the camps supporting\neach of these concepts, as we will also see. Be that as it may, it\nwill be useful to keep these concepts in mind. Sections 3.1 and 3.2\ndiscuss analyses of concept (1), classical and\nlogical/evidential probability; 3.3 discusses analyses of\nconcept (2), subjective probability; 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6\ndiscuss three analyses of concept (3), frequentist,\npropensity, and best-system interpretations.\n",
