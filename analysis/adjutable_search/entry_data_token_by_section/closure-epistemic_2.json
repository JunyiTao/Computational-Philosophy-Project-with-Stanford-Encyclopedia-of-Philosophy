    "main_text": "The Argument From the Analysis of Knowledge || Closure Fails on a Relevant Alternatives Approach\n2.2 Closure Fails on a Relevant Alternatives Approach\n\nThe second version of the argument from the analysis of knowledge has\nit that any relevant alternatives view, not just tracking accounts, is\nin tension with K. An analysis is a relevant alternatives\naccount when it meets two conditions. First, it yields an appropriate\nunderstanding of \u2018relevant alternative.\u2019 Dretske\u2019s\napproach qualifies since it allows us to say that an alternative\nA to p is relevant if and only if:\n\n(CRA)\nwere p false, A might hold.\n\n\nAccording to the second condition, the analysis must say that knowing\np requires ruling out all relevant alternatives to\np but not all alternatives to p. Dretske\u2019s\napproach qualifies once again. It says an alternative A is\nruled out on the basis of R if and only if the following\ncondition is met:\n\n(CRR)\nwere A to hold R would not hold.\n\n\nAnd, on Dretske\u2019s approach, an alternative A must be ruled\nout if and only if A meets CRA.\n\nSo the tracking account is a relevant alternatives approach. But why\nsay that relevant alternatives accounts of knowledge are in tension\nwith K? We will say this if, like Dretske, we accept the\nfollowing crucial tenet: the negation of a proposition p is\nautomatically a relevant alternative to p (no matter how\nbizarre or remote not-p might be) but often not a\nrelevant alternative to things that imply p. For a relevant\nalternatives theorist, this tenet suggests that we can know something\np only if we can rule out not-p but we can know\nthings that entail p even if we cannot rule out\nnot-p, which opens up the possibility that there are cases\nthat violate K. For while our inability to rule out\nnot-p stops us from knowing p it does not stop us\nfrom knowing things that entail p. And an example is ready to\nhand: the zebra case. Perhaps you cannot rule out mule; but\nthat stops you from knowing not-mule without stopping you\nfrom knowing zeb. These points can be restated in terms of\nthe conclusive reasons account. For Dretske, the negation of a\nproposition p is automatically a relevant alternative since\ncondition CRA is automatically met; that is, it is vacuously\ntrue that:\n\nwere p false, not-p might hold.\n\nTherefore mule is a relevant alternative to\nnot-mule. Furthermore, you fail to know not-mule\nsince you cannot rule out mule: you believe not-mule\non the basis of your zebra-in-the-cage percepts, but you would still\nhave these if mule held, contrary to CRR. Yet you know\nzeb in spite of your inability to rule out mule, for\nwere zeb false you would not have your zebra-in-the-cage\npercepts.\n\nAccording to the second version of the argument from the analysis of\nknowledge any relevant alternatives view is in tension with K.\nHow compelling is this argument? As Dretske acknowledged (2003), it is\nactually a weak challenge to K since some relevant alternatives\naccounts are fully consistent with K. For an example, we have\nonly to adapt the safe indication view so as to make it clear that it\nis a relevant alternatives account (Luper 1984, 1987c, 2006).\n\nThe safe indication view can be adapted in two steps. First, we say\nthat an alternative to p, A, is relevant if and only\nif the following condition is met:\n\n(SRA)\nIn S\u2019s circumstances, A might hold.\n\n\nThus any possibility that is remote is automatically irrelevant,\nfailing SRA. Second, we say that A is ruled out on the\nbasis of R if and only if the following condition is met:\n\n(SIR)\nwere R to hold A would not hold.\n\n\nThis way of understanding relevant alternatives upholds K. The\nkey point is that if S knows p on the basis of\nR, and is thus able to rule out p\u2019s relevant\nalternatives, then S can also rule out q\u2019s relevant\nalternatives, where q is anything p implies. If\nR were to hold, q\u2019s alternatives would not.\n\nApparently, the relevant alternatives account can be construed in a\nway that supports K as well as a way that does not. Hence\nDretske is not well positioned to claim that the relevant alternatives\nview leads \u201cnaturally\u201d to closure failure.\n",
