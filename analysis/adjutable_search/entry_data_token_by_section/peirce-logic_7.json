    "main_text": "From Bivalent to Triadic Logic\n3. From Bivalent to Triadic Logic\n\nFisch and Turquette (1966) discovered three crucial pages out of\nPeirce\u2019s Logic Notebook (1865\u20131909, Ms\n 339).[40]\n This shows that Peirce\u2019s invention of three-valued sentential\nlogic predates by at least a decade Jan Lukasiewicz\u2019s and Emil\nPost\u2019s achievements on the same topic. The three pages contain\nthe essential elements of triadic logic and an intriguing passage\nabout Peirce\u2019s motivation behind triadic logic. If we put\nPeirce\u2019s development of triadic logic in contemporary terms,\nPeirce seemed to be branching out to non-standard logic. If so, this\nadventure would be qualitatively different from the other two we have\njust discussed in the previous sections.\n\nWhen Peirce developed relational logic, the territory of formalization\nwas vastly expanded. New vocabulary, hence, new syntactic rules and\nsemantic rules, were added. Naturally we welcome the territory of\nformalization and, hence, theoretical justification is not needed.\nFrom sentential to relational logic\u2014this is an extension in a\nliteral sense: We do not discard the previous results\u2014hence they\nare preserved\u2014but all we do is to expand them.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of extension to non-symbolic languages,\nthe logic itself stays the same, without addition or subtraction, but\na new form of representation is introduced. That is, what to represent\nis not extended, but how to represent is. Some might not see the need\nfor various forms of representation, and might not be convinced of the\nnecessity of graphical systems. Nonetheless, at a theoretical level,\nPeirce\u2019s EG does not demand lengthy theoretical justification.\nIn some sense, the proof is in the pudding: Can this new graphical\nsystem carry out the same task as existing symbolic systems do? If so,\nwhich system is easier to use? Which system is more efficient? We\nmight not arrive at a clean consensus, but the discussions are more or\nless predictable.\n\nHowever, when one more semantic value is added to T (true) and\nF (false), logic is not preserved any more. When semantics is\nextended or changed, the new logic is neither a monotonic expansion of\nthe territory of logic nor an alternative syntactic form of\nrepresentation to existing symbolic systems. Triadic logic, by\nintroducing one more semantic value, departs from the standard logic\nwhich is based on bivalence. Here, the status of the principle of\nexcluded middle (\u201cQ or not-Q\u201d) is shaken. So\nis the law of contradiction. It is the burden of any non-standard\nlogic to justify its being non-standard: Why the third value? What is\nthe third value? Unknown? If so, is it an epistemological issue?\nIndeterminate? If so, does this require a metaphysical\nexplanation?\n\nThe first subsection summarizes Peirce\u2019s calculus of triadic\nlogic and the second briefly discusses Peirce\u2019s own motive for\ntriadic logic.\n",
