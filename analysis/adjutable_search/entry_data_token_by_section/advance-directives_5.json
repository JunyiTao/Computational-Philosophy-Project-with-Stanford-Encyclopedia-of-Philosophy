On such\napproaches, conflicts between earlier interests grounded in autonomy\nand later interests no longer so grounded become impossible, and the\nclaim of authority of the earlier autonomous self over the current\nnon-autonomous self loses its bite: the threshold of autonomy is so\nlow as to cease to mark any contestable difference in authority. Seana\nShiffrin's response to Dworkin can be interpreted as a view of this\nsort (Shiffrin 2004). Shiffrin sees a key point of autonomy in the\nability to exercise one's own will: the ability to control one's\nexperiences through the enactment of one's own choice. Shiffrin\nemphasizes that so long as an individual has this ability, its\nexercise calls for protection, and this is a crucial part of what we\nprotect when we respect autonomy. On this picture, so long as an\nindividual is able to make choices, have preferences, exhibit a will,\netc., there is a rationale for catering to his current interests, and\nso his current interests have authority to override interests espoused\nin the past.\n\n\nThe proponent of the threshold view may, in response, acknowledge\nthe importance of the ability to control one's experience through acts\nof will, but still insist that a more robust capacity for autonomy \u2014\nfor example, a capacity that involves expression of values and not just\nmere preferences \u2014 has moral importance of an altogether different\norder. This difference can then support the position that, in cases of\nconflicts between an earlier self capable of such robust autonomy and a\ncurrent self merely capable of exercises of will, the earlier self\nretains authority and her interests ought to be heeded.\n",
