    "main_text": "Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self\n4. Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self\n\n\nMany commentators hold that consciousness of self is central to the\nCritical philosophy. There is reason to question this: unified\nconsciousness is central, but consciousness of self? That is not so\nclear. Whatever, the topic is intrinsically interesting and Kant\nachieved some remarkable insights into it. Strangely, none of his\nimmediate successors took them up after his death and they next\nappeared at the earliest in Wittgenstein (1934\u20135) and perhaps not until\nShoemaker (1968). Kant never discussed consciousness of self in its own\nright, only in the context of pursuing other objectives, and his\nremarks on the topic are extremely scattered. When we pull his various\nremarks together, we can see that Kant advanced at least seven major\ntheses about consciousness of and\n knowledge of self.\n We will consider them one-by-one.\n",
