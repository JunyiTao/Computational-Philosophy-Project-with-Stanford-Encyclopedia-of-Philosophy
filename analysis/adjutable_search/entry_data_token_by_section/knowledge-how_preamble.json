    "main_text": "\n\nIn introductory classes to epistemology, we are taught to distinguish\nbetween three different kinds of knowledge. The first kind is\nacquaintance knowledge: we know our mothers, our friends, our\npets, etc., by being acquainted with them. The second kind is\nknowledge of facts, propositional knowledge, or\nknowledge-that: this is the sort of knowledge we acquire when\nwe learn that, say, Ithaca is in New York State or that Turin is\nlocated in Italy. It is customary to add to the list a third\nkind of knowledge that is supposed to be distinct both from\nacquaintance knowledge and from propositional knowledge. One possesses\nthis knowledge when one can be truly described as knowing how\nto do something: play the piano, make a pie, walk, speak, create,\nbuild, and so on.\n\nThe distinction between knowledge-how and knowledge-that was brought\nto scrutiny in analytic philosophy by Ryle in his seminal The\nConcept of Mind (1949), where he raised some of the now classical\nobjections to the so-called \u201cintellectualist legend\u201d: the\nview that knowledge-how amounts to knowledge-that. Ryle instead\nadvocated an \u201canti-intellectualist\u201d view of knowledge-how\naccording to which knowledge-how and knowledge-that are distinct kinds\nof knowledge, and manifestations of knowledge-how are not necessarily\nmanifestations of knowledge-that. This anti-intellectualism has been\nthe received view among philosophers for a long time. Even\npsychologists and neuroscientists have explicitly appealed to\nRyle\u2019s classical distinction when discussing their empirical\nfindings (e.g., Cohen & Squire 1980; Anderson 1983). Nevertheless,\nin the last twenty years, a renewed interest by epistemologists in the\nnature of knowledge-how has brought new life to the debate, where new\nversions of intellectualism and anti-intellectualism have been\ndeveloped and argued for. The debate is partly epistemological: is\nknowledge-how an altogether distinct kind of knowledge, different from\nknowledge-that? But it is also about a psychological question: what\nkind of psychological state is knowledge-how? The goal of this entry\nis to overview the debate between intellectualists and\nanti-intellectualists, while highlighting the implications of this\ndebate for related questions concerning intelligence, cognition,\nlanguage, and skills. \n\nThis entry starts by looking at some classical arguments against\nintellectualism about knowledge-how: the regress argument (section 1),\nthe insufficiency argument (section 2), and the gradability argument\n(section 3). Then two motivating arguments for intellectualism are\nconsidered: the linguistic argument (section 4) and the action theory\nargument (section 5). Section 6 overviews the recent epistemological\ndebate on whether knowledge-how and propositional knowledge have the\nsame epistemic profile. Section 7 discusses the cognitive science\nargument against intellectualism. Section 8 surveys what forms\nanti-intellectualism about knowledge-how has taken in the recent\nliterature. Section 9 looks at the relation between knowledge-how and\nskills. Section 10 discusses knowledge-how and other related\ntopics.\n",
