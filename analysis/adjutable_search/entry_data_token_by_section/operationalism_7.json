    "main_text": "Critiques of operationalism || What are operations?\n2.3 What are operations?\n\nApart from the questions of whether operational definitions are\nsufficient or necessary, it is actually unclear what types of things\noperations are, and how they should be specified. This\nproblem was noted and discussed quite early on (see, for example,\nHearnshaw 1941). The surface-level intuition is simple: the operations\nthat matter are measurement operations involving physical instruments.\nBut from the start Bridgman (1927, 5) also stated that the operations\nwhich fixed meaning were mental if the concepts in question were\nmental (e.g., in mathematics). And he knew that measurement operations\ninvolved more than physical manipulations of instruments; at least\nthere are recordings and computations involved in the processing and\nanalysis of data, and there are mental acts linking various parts of\nthat complex procedure, too. To take the simplest example, the\noperation of counting is a mental operation, but it is an integral\npart of many \u201cphysical\u201d procedures. He called such crucial\nnon-physical operations \u201cpaper-and-pencil\u201d operations.\nBridgman lamented that it was the \u201cmost wide spread\nmisconception with regard to the operational technique\u201d to think\nthat it demanded that all concepts in physics must find their meaning\nonly in terms of physical operations in the laboratory (Bridgman 1938,\n122\u2013124; also Bridgman 1959b, 522). Later he gave a rough\nclassification of operations into the instrumental, mental/verbal, and\npaper-and-pencil varieties (Bridgman 1959a, 3).\n\nThis issue becomes sharper when we ask the question of purpose: what\nare the aims of operational analysis, and which operations are\nsuitable for achieving those aims? Having distinguished various types\nof operations, Bridgman also had to deal with the question of whether\nthe different types had different epistemic values, going beyond his\ninitial intuitive fondness for instrumental operations. For example,\nif the point of operationalizing a concept was to make its meaning\nclear and precise, which meant using \u201coperations which can be\nunequivocally performed\u201d (Bridgman 1938, 119), then why were\npaper-and-pencil operations such as the construction of Euclidean\ngeometric figures not just as good as instrumental operations? In the\nend he was willing to dispense with any ultimate privileging of\ninstrumental operations. But he still maintained a preference for them\nwhen possible, without giving a convincing reason for that preference\n(Bridgman 1938, 127).\n\nThus Bridgman\u2019s position on the nature and function of\noperations was uneasy from start to finish. Various critics rightly\nzeroed in on this point. The most important point of contention was\nwhether and why physical or instrumental operations had any special\nepistemic advantage. The Yale physicist Henry Margenau put the point\nsuccinctly:\n\nOperationalism is an attitude that emphasizes the need of recourse,\nwherever feasible, to instrumental procedures when meanings are to be\nestablished. Bridgman disavows its status as a philosophy, and wisely\nso, for as a general view \u2026. it cannot define the meaning of\n\u201cinstrumental procedure\u201d in a manner that saves the view\nfrom being either trivial (which would be true if\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d were construed to include symbolic, mental\nand paper-and-pencil operations) or too restrictive (if all operations\nare to be laboratory procedures). (Margenau in Frank 1956, 45)\n\n\nAs one can imagine, this dilemma also hampered attempts to use\noperational analysis in psychology. Operations in psychological\nresearch inevitably involved verbal instructions, reports and\nreactions. It was difficult to argue that these mental or verbal\noperations were superior in reliability or meaningfulness to the\nintrospective reporting of mental states, which operationists tried so\nhard to exclude from scientific psychology.\n\nBridgman himself was troubled by the question regarding the nature of\noperations and admitted late in his life that he had not really\nprovided \u201can analysis of what it is that makes an operation\nsuitable\u201d, or \u201cin what terms can operations be\nspecified\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 77). An even deeper\npessimism was expressed in Bridgman\u2019s 30-year retrospective on\nThe Logic of Modern Physics, commissioned for\nDaedalus by Holton: \u201cTo me now it seems\nincomprehensible that I should ever have thought it within my powers\n\u2026 to analyze so thoroughly the functioning of our thinking\napparatus that I could confidently expect to exhaust the subject and\neliminate the possibility of a bright new idea against which I would\nbe defenseless\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 520).\n",
