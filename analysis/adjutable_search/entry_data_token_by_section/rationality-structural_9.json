    "main_text": "Requirements of Structural Rationality || Skepticism about and Alternatives to Requirements of Structural Rationality\n2.4 Skepticism about and Alternatives to Requirements of Structural Rationality\n\nA number of authors have raised skepticism about structural\nrequirements of rationality. We will distinguish three varieties of\nsuch skepticism.\n\nThe first variety, which we call \u201cimpossibilist\nskepticism\u201d, is based on the view that once one specifies\nsufficient conditions for structural irrationality, it turns out to be\nimpossible to violate these conditions. The idea that it is impossible\nto violate at least some putative structural requirements has a long\nhistory: the Socrates of Plato\u2019s Protagoras denies the\npossibility of akrasia (see also Davidson 1969 and the entry on\n weakness of will),\n while other authors have denied the possibility of epistemic\nakrasia specifically (Hurley 1989; Adler 2002), irrational\nself-contradiction (Price 2008), and instrumental irrationality\n(Finlay 2009; Timmermann 2022). Impossibilist skeptics combine the\npremise that the putative structural requirements are inviolable with\nthe further premise (argued for by Korsgaard 1997, among others) that\nany genuine requirement of rationality must leave room for violation,\nto yield the conclusion that the putative structural requirements are\nnot genuine rational requirements after all (Finlay 2009; Lee\n2022).\n\nImpossibilist skepticism entails not only that there are no structural\nrequirements of rationality, but also that there is no such\nthing as a property of structural rationality (understood as a\nproperty that people can fail to have). By contrast, a second kind of\nskepticism, which we call \u201cparticularist skepticism\u201d, does\nnot necessarily take issue with this property; it merely denies that\nthe occurrence of structural irrationality can be explained in terms\nof general structural requirements. Proponents of this view\nhold that all general structural requirements prohibiting\nattitude-combinations are subject to counterexamples, for example in\ncases of luminosity failure (i.e. failure to be in a position to know\none\u2019s own attitudes) and cases in which subjects have\nhigher-order beliefs or evidence that conflict with the putative\nrequirement (Fogal 2020; Lasonen-Aarnio 2021).\n\nIn place of the requirements-based approach, particularist skeptics\noffer alternative models. For example, Fogal (2020) suggests a\n\u201cpressure-based\u201d model, on which attitudes exert a\ngradable rational pressure (analogous to the normative pressure of\npro tanto reasons) and the structural rationality or\nirrationality of an attitude depends on the greatest positive or\nnegative rational pressure overall. By contrast, Lasonen-Aarnio (2021)\nproposes to explain the irrationality of incoherence in terms of the\nmanifestation of certain bad dispositions \u2013 dispositions that\nconflict with being a competent follower of substantive norms (for a\nsimilar view, see also Raz 2005). Both views avoid a commitment to\ngeneralizable truths to the effect that certain sets of attitudes are\nby themselves sufficient for irrationality.\n\nA third kind of skepticism, which we call \u201csubstantivist\nskepticism\u201d, holds that even if extensionally adequate\nformulations of general structural requirements are available, the\nassumption that there are such requirements is dispensable since\nstructural irrationality can be explained in terms of requirements of\nsubstantive rationality\n alone.[7]\n (We mentioned this reductive view already in \u00a71.3.) Proponents\nof substantivist skepticism often hold that we should dispense with\nstructural requirements if we can because they are problematic. For\nexample, some hold that such requirements cannot be normative (see\n\u00a73) but would have to be normative in order to exist at all\n(Price 2008; Kiesewetter 2017: Ch. 2, and Ch. 6 for some additional\nundesirable implications of structural requirements).\n",
