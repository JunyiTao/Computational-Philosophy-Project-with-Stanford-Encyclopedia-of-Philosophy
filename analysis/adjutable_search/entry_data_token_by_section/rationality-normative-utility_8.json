As it became apparent that\nexpected utility theory did not accurately predict the behaviors of\nreal people, its proponents instead advanced the view that it might\nserve instead as a theory of how rational people should respond to\nuncertainty (see Herfeld 2017).\n\n\nExpected utility theory has a variety of applications in public\npolicy. In welfare economics, Harsanyi (1953) reasons from expected\nutility theory to the claim that the most socially just arrangement is\nthe one that maximizes total welfare distributed across a society\nsociety.  The theory of expected utility also has more direct\napplications.  Howard (1980) introduces the concept of\na micromort, or a one-in-a-million chance of death, and uses\nexpected utility calculations to gauge which mortality risks are\nacceptable.  In health policy, quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs,\nare measures of the expected utilities of different health\ninterventions used to guide health policy (see Weinstein et al\n2009). McAskill (2015) uses expected utility theory to address the\ncentral question of effective altruism: \u201cHow can I do\nthe most good?\u201d (Utilties in these applications are most\nnaturally interpreted as measuring something like happiness or\nwellbeing, rather than subjective preference satisfaction for an\nindividual agent.)\n\n\nAnother area where expected utility theory finds applications is in\ninsurance sales. Like casinos, insurance companies take on\ncalculated risks with the aim of long-term financial gain, and must\ntake into account the chance of going broke in the short run.\n",
