In the Two Treatises of\nGovernment, he defended the claim that men are by nature free and\nequal against claims that God had made all people naturally subject to\na monarch. He argued that people have rights, such as the right to\nlife, liberty, and property, that have a foundation independent of the\nlaws of any particular society. Locke used the claim that men are\nnaturally free and equal as part of the justification for\nunderstanding legitimate political government as the result of a\nsocial contract where people in the state of nature conditionally\ntransfer some of their rights to the government in order to better\nensure the stable, comfortable enjoyment of their lives, liberty, and\nproperty. Since governments exist by the consent of the people in\norder to protect the rights of the people and promote the public good,\ngovernments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced with new\ngovernments. Locke is thus also important for his defense of the right\nof revolution. Locke also defends the principle of majority rule and\nthe separation of legislative and executive powers. In the Letter\nConcerning Toleration, Locke denied that coercion should be used\nto bring people to (what the ruler believes is) the true religion and\nalso denied that churches should have any coercive power over their\nmembers. Locke elaborated on these themes in his later political\nwritings, such as the Second Letter on Toleration and\nThird Letter on Toleration.\n\nFor a more general introduction to Locke\u2019s history and\nbackground, the argument of the Two Treatises, and the\nLetter Concerning Toleration, see\n Section 1,\n Section 4, and\n Section 5,\n respectively, of the main entry on\n John Locke\n in this encyclopedia.

Natural Law and Natural Rights\n\nPerhaps the most central concept in Locke\u2019s political philosophy\nis his theory of natural law and natural rights. The natural law\nconcept existed long before Locke as a way of expressing the idea that\nthere were certain moral truths that applied to all people, regardless\nof the particular place where they lived or the agreements they had\nmade. The most important early contrast was between laws that were by\nnature, and thus generally applicable, and those that were\nconventional and operated only in those places where the particular\nconvention had been established. This distinction is sometimes\nformulated as the difference between natural law and positive law.\n\nNatural law is also distinct from divine law in that the latter, in\nthe Christian tradition, normally referred to those laws that God had\ndirectly revealed through prophets and other inspired writers. Natural\nlaw can be discovered by reason alone and applies to all people, while\ndivine law can be discovered only through God\u2019s special\nrevelation and applies only to those to whom it is revealed and whom\nGod specifically indicates are to be bound. Thus some\nseventeenth-century commentators, Locke included, held that not all of\nthe 10 commandments, much less the rest of the Old Testament law, were\nbinding on all people. The 10 commandments begin \u201cHear O\nIsrael\u201d and thus are only binding on the people to whom they\nwere addressed (Works 6:37). (Spelling and formatting are\nmodernized in quotations from Locke in this entry). As we will see\nbelow, even though Locke thought natural law could be known apart from\nspecial revelation, he saw no contradiction in God playing a part in\nthe argument, so long as the relevant aspects of God\u2019s character\ncould be discovered by reason alone. In Locke\u2019s theory, divine\nlaw and natural law are consistent and can overlap in content, but\nthey are not coextensive. Thus there is no problem for Locke if the\nBible commands a moral code that is stricter than the one that can be\nderived from natural law, but there is a real problem if the Bible\nteaches what is contrary to natural law. In practice, Locke avoided\nthis problem because consistency with natural law was one of the\ncriteria he used when deciding the proper interpretation of Biblical\npassages.\n\nThe language of natural rights also gained prominence through the\nwritings of thinkers in the generation before Locke, such as Grotius\nand Hobbes, and of his contemporary Pufendorf. Whereas natural law\nemphasized duties, natural rights normally emphasized privileges or\nclaims to which an individual was entitled. There is considerable\ndisagreement as to how these factors are to be understood in relation\nto each other in Locke\u2019s theory. Leo Strauss (1953), and many of\nhis followers, take rights to be paramount, going so far as to portray\nLocke\u2019s position as essentially similar to that of Hobbes. They\npoint out that Locke defended a hedonist theory of human motivation\n(Essay 2.20) and claim that he must agree with Hobbes about\nthe essentially self-interested nature of human beings. Locke, they\nclaim, recognizes natural law obligations only in those situations\nwhere our own preservation is not in conflict, further emphasizing\nthat our right to preserve ourselves trumps any duties we may\nhave.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, more scholars have adopted the view\nof Dunn (1969), Tully (1980), and Ashcraft (1986) that it is natural\nlaw, not natural rights, that is primary. They hold that when Locke\nemphasized the right to life, liberty, and property he was primarily\nmaking a point about the duties we have toward other people: duties\nnot to kill, enslave, or steal. Most scholars also argue that Locke\nrecognized a general duty to assist with the preservation of mankind,\nincluding a duty of charity to those who have no other way to procure\ntheir subsistence (Two Treatises 1.42). These scholars regard\nduties as primary in Locke because rights exist to ensure that we are\nable to fulfill our duties. Simmons (1992) takes a position similar to\nthe latter group, but claims that rights are not just the flip side of\nduties in Locke, nor merely a means to performing our duties. Instead,\nrights and duties are equally fundamental because Locke believes in a\n\u201crobust zone of indifference\u201d in which rights protect our\nability to make choices. While these choices cannot violate natural\nlaw, they are not a mere means to fulfilling natural law either. Brian\nTierney (2014) questions whether one needs to prioritize natural law\nor natural right since both typically function as corollaries. He\nargues that modern natural rights theories are a development from\nmedieval conceptions of natural law that included permissions to act\nor not act in certain ways. \n\nThere have been some attempts to find a compromise between these\npositions. Michael Zuckert\u2019s (1994) version of the Straussian\nposition acknowledges more differences between Hobbes and Locke.\nZuckert still questions the sincerity of Locke\u2019s theism, but\nthinks that Locke does develop a position that grounds property rights\nin the fact that human beings own themselves, something Hobbes denied.\nAdam Seagrave (2014) has gone a step further. He argues that the\ncontradiction between Locke\u2019s claim that human beings are owned\nby God and that human beings own themselves is only apparent. He bases\nthis argument on passages from Locke\u2019s other writings\n(especially the Essay Concerning Human Understanding). In the\npassages about divine ownership, Locke is speaking about humanity as a\nwhole, while in the passages about self-ownership he is talking about\nindividual human beings with the capacity for property ownership. God\ncreated human beings who are capable of having property rights with\nrespect to one another on the basis of owning their labor. Both of\nthem emphasize differences between Locke\u2019s use of natural rights\nand the earlier tradition of natural law. \n\nAnother point of contestation has to do with the extent to which Locke\nthought natural law could, in fact, be known by reason. Both Strauss\n(1953) and Peter Laslett (Introduction to Locke\u2019s Two\nTreatises), though very different in their interpretations of\nLocke generally, see Locke\u2019s theory of natural law as filled\nwith contradictions. In the Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, Locke defends a theory of moral knowledge that\nnegates the possibility of innate ideas (Essay Book 1) and\nclaims that morality is capable of demonstration in the same way that\nMathematics is (Essay 3.11.16, 4.3.18\u201320). Yet nowhere\nin any of his works does Locke make a full deduction of natural law\nfrom first premises. More than that, Locke at times seems to appeal to\ninnate ideas in the Second Treatise (2.11), and in The\nReasonableness of Christianity (Works 7:139) he admits\nthat no one has ever worked out all of natural law from reason alone.\nStrauss infers from this that the contradictions exist to show the\nattentive reader that Locke does not really believe in natural law at\nall. Laslett, more conservatively, simply says that Locke the\nphilosopher and Locke the political writer should be kept very\nseparate.\n\nMany scholars reject this position. Yolton (1958), Colman (1883),\nAshcraft (1987), Grant (1987), Simmons (1992), Tuckness (1999),\nIsraelson (2013), Rossiter (2016), Connolly (2019), and others all\nargue that there is nothing strictly inconsistent in Locke\u2019s\nadmission in The Reasonableness of Christianity. That no one\nhas deduced all of natural law from first principles does not mean\nthat none of it has been deduced. The supposedly contradictory\npassages in the Two Treatises are far from decisive. While it\nis true that Locke does not provide a deduction in the Essay,\nit is not clear that he was trying to. Section 4.10.1\u201319 of that\nwork seems more concerned to show how reasoning with moral terms is\npossible, not to actually provide a full account of natural law.\nNonetheless, it must be admitted that Locke did not treat the topic of\nnatural law as systematically as one might like. Attempts to work out\nhis theory in more detail with respect to its ground and its content\nmust try to reconstruct it from scattered passages in many different\ntexts.\n\nTo understand Locke\u2019s position on the ground of natural law it\nmust be situated within a larger debate in natural law theory that\npredates Locke, the so-called\n\u201cvoluntarism-intellectualism,\u201d or\n\u201cvoluntarist-rationalist\u201d debate. At its simplest, the\nvoluntarist declares that right and wrong are determined by\nGod\u2019s will and that we are obliged to obey the will of God\nsimply because it is the will of God. Unless these positions are\nmaintained, the voluntarist argues, God becomes superfluous to\nmorality since both the content and the binding force of morality can\nbe explained without reference to God. The intellectualist replies\nthat this understanding makes morality arbitrary and fails to explain\nwhy we have an obligation to obey God. Graedon Zorzi (2019) has argued\nthat \u201cperson\u201d is a relational term for Locke, indicating\nthat we will be held accountable by God for whether we have followed\nthe law.\n\nWith respect to the grounds and content of natural law, Locke is not\ncompletely clear. On the one hand, there are many instances where he\nmakes statements that sound voluntarist to the effect that law\nrequires a legislator with authority (Essay 1.3.6, 4.10.7).\nLocke also repeatedly insists in the Essays on the Law of\nNature that created beings have an obligation to obey their\ncreator (Political Essays 116\u2013120). On the other hand\nthere are statements that seem to imply an external moral standard to\nwhich God must conform (Two Treatises 2.195; Works\n7:6). Locke clearly wants to avoid the implication that the content of\nnatural law is arbitrary. Several solutions have been proposed. One\nsolution suggested by Herzog (1985) makes Locke an intellectualist by\ngrounding our obligation to obey God on a prior duty of gratitude that\nexists independent of God. A second option, suggested by Simmons\n(1992), is simply to take Locke as a voluntarist since that is where\nthe preponderance of his statements point. A third option, suggested\nby Tuckness (1999) (and implied by Grant 1987 and affirmed by\nIsraelson 2013), is to treat the question of voluntarism as having two\ndifferent parts, grounds and content. On this view, Locke was indeed a\nvoluntarist with respect to the question \u201cwhy should we obey the\nlaw of nature?\u201d Locke thought that reason, apart from the will\nof a superior, could only be advisory. With respect to content, divine\nreason and human reason must be sufficiently analogous that human\nbeings can reason about what God likely wills. Locke takes it for\ngranted that since God created us with reason in order to follow\nGod\u2019s will, human reason and divine reason are sufficiently\nsimilar that natural law will not seem arbitrary to us.\n\nThose interested in the contemporary relevance of Locke\u2019s\npolitical theory must confront its theological aspects. Straussians\nmake Locke\u2019s theory relevant by claiming that the theological\ndimensions of his thought are primarily rhetorical; they were\n\u201ccover\u201d to keep him from being persecuted by the religious\nauthorities of his day. Others, such as Dunn (1969) and Stanton\n(2018), take Locke to be of only limited relevance to contemporary\npolitics precisely because so many of his arguments depend on\nreligious assumptions that are no longer widely shared. Some authors,\nsuch as Simmons (1992) and Vernon (1997), have tried to separate the\nfoundations of Locke\u2019s argument from other aspects of it.\nSimmons, for example, argues that Locke\u2019s thought is\nover-determined, containing both religious and secular arguments. He\nclaims that for Locke the fundamental law of nature is that \u201cas\nmuch as possible mankind is to be preserved\u201d (Two\nTreatises 2.135). At times, he claims, Locke presents this\nprinciple in rule-consequentialist terms: it is the principle we use\nto determine the more specific rights and duties that all have. At\nother times, Locke hints at a more Kantian justification that\nemphasizes the impropriety of treating our equals as if they were mere\nmeans to our ends. Waldron (2002) explores the opposite claim: that\nLocke\u2019s theology actually provides a more solid basis for his\npremise of political equality than do contemporary secular approaches\nthat tend to simply assert equality.\n\nWith respect to the specific content of natural law, Locke never\nprovides a comprehensive statement of what it requires. In the Two\nTreatises, Locke frequently states that the fundamental law of\nnature is that as much as possible mankind is to be preserved. Simmons\n(1992) argues that in Two Treatises 2.6 Locke presents (1) a\nduty to preserve one\u2019s self, (2) a duty to preserve others when\nself-preservation does not conflict, (3) a duty not to take away the\nlife of another, and (4) a duty not to act in a way that \u201ctends\nto destroy\u201d others. Libertarian interpreters of Locke tend to\ndownplay duties of type 1 and 2. Locke presents a more extensive list\nin his earlier, and unpublished in his lifetime, Essays on the Law\nof Nature. Interestingly, Locke here includes praise and honor of\nthe deity as required by natural law as well as what we might call\ngood character qualities.\n2. State of Nature\n\nLocke\u2019s concept of the state of nature has been interpreted by\ncommentators in a variety of ways. At first glance it seems quite\nsimple. Locke writes \u201cwant [lack] of a common judge, with\nauthority, puts all men in a state of nature\u201d and again,\n\u201cMen living together according to reason, without a common\nsuperior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly\nthe state of nature.\u201d (Two Treatises 2.19) Many\ncommentators have taken this as Locke\u2019s definition, concluding\nthat the state of nature exists wherever there is no legitimate\npolitical authority able to judge disputes and where people live\naccording to the law of reason. On this account the state of nature is\ndistinct from political society, where a legitimate government exists,\nand from a state of war where men fail to abide by the law of\nreason.\n\nSimmons (1993) presents an important challenge to this view. Simmons\npoints out that the above statement is worded as a sufficient rather\nthan necessary condition. Two individuals might be able, in the state\nof nature, to authorize a third to settle disputes between them\nwithout leaving the state of nature, since the third party would not\nhave, for example, the power to legislate for the public good. Simmons\nalso claims that other interpretations often fail to account for the\nfact that there are some people who live in states with legitimate\ngovernments who are nonetheless in the state of nature: visiting\naliens (Two Treatises 2.9), children below the age of\nmajority (2.15, 118), and those with a \u201cdefect\u201d of reason\n(2.60). He claims that the state of nature is a relational concept\ndescribing a particular set of moral relations that exist between\nparticular people, rather than a description of a particular\ngeographical territory where there is no government with effective\ncontrol. The state of nature is just the way of describing the moral\nrights and responsibilities that exist between people who have not\nconsented to the adjudication of their disputes by the same legitimate\ngovernment. The groups just mentioned either have not or cannot give\nconsent, so they remain in the state of nature. Thus A may be in the\nstate of nature with respect to B, but not with C.\n\nSimmons\u2019 account stands in sharp contrast to that of Strauss\n(1953). According to Strauss, Locke presents the state of nature as a\nfactual description of what the earliest society is like, an account\nthat when read closely reveals Locke\u2019s departure from Christian\nteachings. State of nature theories, he and his followers argue, are\ncontrary to the Biblical account in Genesis and evidence that\nLocke\u2019s teaching is similar to that of Hobbes. As noted above,\non the Straussian account Locke\u2019s apparently Christian\nstatements are only a fa\u00e7ade designed to conceal his\nessentially anti-Christian views. According to Simmons, since the\nstate of nature is a moral account, it is compatible with a wide\nvariety of social accounts without contradiction. If we know only that\na group of people are in a state of nature, we know only the rights\nand responsibilities they have toward one another; we know nothing\nabout whether they are rich or poor, peaceful or warlike.\n\nA complementary interpretation is made by John Dunn (1969) with\nrespect to the relationship between Locke\u2019s state of nature and\nhis Christian beliefs. Dunn claimed that Locke\u2019s state of nature\nis less an exercise in historical anthropology than a theological\nreflection on the condition of man. On Dunn\u2019s interpretation,\nLocke\u2019s state of nature thinking is an expression of his\ntheological position, that man exists in a world created by God for\nGod\u2019s purposes but that governments are created by men in order\nto further those purposes.\n\nLocke\u2019s theory of the state of nature will thus be tied closely\nto his theory of natural law, since the latter defines the rights of\npersons and their status as free and equal persons. The stronger the\ngrounds for accepting Locke\u2019s characterization of people as\nfree, equal, and independent, the more helpful the state of nature\nbecomes as a device for representing people. Still, it is important to\nremember that none of these interpretations claims that Locke\u2019s\nstate of nature is only a thought experiment, in the way Kant\nand Rawls are normally thought to use the concept. Locke did not\nrespond to the argument \u201cwhere have there ever been people in\nsuch a state\u201d by saying it did not matter since it was only a\nthought experiment. Instead, he argued that there are and have been\npeople in the state of nature (Two Treatises 2.14). It seems\nimportant to him that at least some governments have actually been\nformed in the way he suggests. How much it matters whether they have\nbeen or not will be discussed below under the topic of consent, since\nthe central question is whether a good government can be legitimate\neven if it does not have the actual consent of the people who live\nunder it; hypothetical contract and actual contract theories will tend\nto answer this question differently.\n3. Property\n\nLocke\u2019s treatment of property is generally thought to be among\nhis most important contributions in political thought, but it is also\none of the aspects of his thought that has been most heavily\ncriticized. There are important debates over what exactly Locke was\ntrying to accomplish with his theory. One interpretation, advanced by\nC.B. Macpherson (1962), sees Locke as a defender of unrestricted\ncapitalist accumulation. On Macpherson\u2019s interpretation, Locke\nis thought to have set three restrictions on the accumulation of\nproperty in the state of nature: (1) one may only appropriate as much\nas one can use before it spoils (Two Treatises 2.31), (2) one\nmust leave \u201cenough and as good\u201d for others (the\nsufficiency restriction) (2.27), and (3) one may (supposedly) only\nappropriate property through one\u2019s own labor (2.27). Macpherson\nclaims that as the argument progresses, each of these restrictions is\ntranscended. The spoilage restriction ceases to be a meaningful\nrestriction with the invention of money because value can be stored in\na medium that does not decay (2.46\u201347). The sufficiency\nrestriction is transcended because the creation of private property so\nincreases productivity that even those who no longer have the\nopportunity to acquire land will have more opportunity to acquire what\nis necessary for life (2.37). According to Macpherson\u2019s view,\nthe \u201cenough and as good\u201d requirement is itself merely a\nderivative of a prior principle guaranteeing the opportunity to\nacquire, through labor, the necessities of life. The third\nrestriction, Macpherson argues, was not one Locke actually held at\nall. Though Locke appears to suggest that one can only have property\nin what one has personally labored on when he makes labor the source\nof property rights, Locke clearly recognized that even in the state of\nnature, \u201cthe Turfs my Servant has cut\u201d (2.28) can become\nmy property. Locke, according to Macpherson, thus clearly recognized\nthat labor can be alienated. As one would guess, Macpherson is\ncritical of the \u201cpossessive individualism\u201d that\nLocke\u2019s theory of property represents. He argues that its\ncoherence depends upon the assumption of differential rationality\nbetween capitalists and wage-laborers and on the division of society\ninto distinct classes. Because Locke was bound by these constraints,\nwe are to understand him as including only property owners as voting\nmembers of society.\n\nMacpherson\u2019s understanding of Locke has been criticized from\nseveral different directions. Alan Ryan (1965) argued that since\nproperty for Locke includes life and liberty as well as estate\n(Two Treatises 2.87), even those without land could still be\nmembers of political society. The dispute between the two would then\nturn on whether Locke was using \u201cproperty\u201d in the more\nexpansive sense in some of the crucial passages. James Tully (1980)\nattacked Macpherson\u2019s interpretation by pointing out that the\nFirst Treatise specifically includes a duty of charity toward\nthose who have no other means of subsistence (1.42). While this duty\nis consistent with requiring the poor to work for low wages, it does\nundermine the claim that those who have wealth have no social\nduties to others.\n\nTully also argued for a fundamental reinterpretation of Locke\u2019s\ntheory. Previous accounts had focused on the claim that since persons\nown their own labor, when they mix their labor with that which is\nunowned it becomes their property. Robert Nozick (1974) criticized\nthis argument with his famous example of mixing tomato juice one\nrightfully owns with the sea. When we mix what we own with what we do\nnot, why should we think we gain property instead of losing it? On\nTully\u2019s account, focus on the mixing metaphor misses\nLocke\u2019s emphasis on what he calls the \u201cworkmanship\nmodel.\u201d Locke believed that makers have property rights with\nrespect to what they make just as God has property rights with respect\nto human beings because he is their maker. Human beings are created in\nthe image of God and share with God, though to a much lesser extent,\nthe ability to shape and mold the physical environment in accordance\nwith a rational pattern or plan. Waldron (1988) has criticized this\ninterpretation on the grounds that it would make the rights of human\nmakers absolute in the same way that God\u2019s right over his\ncreation is absolute. Sreenivasan (1995) has defended Tully\u2019s\nargument against Waldron\u2019s response by claiming a distinction\nbetween creating and making. Only creating generates an absolute\nproperty right, and only God can create, but making is analogous to\ncreating and creates an analogous, though weaker, right.\n\nAnother controversial aspect of Tully\u2019s interpretation of Locke\nis his interpretation of the sufficiency condition and its\nimplications. On his analysis, the sufficiency argument is crucial for\nLocke\u2019s argument to be plausible. Since Locke begins with the\nassumption that the world is owned by all, individual property is only\njustified if it can be shown that no one is made worse off by the\nappropriation. In conditions where the good taken is not scarce, where\nthere is much water or land available, an individual\u2019s taking\nsome portion of it does no harm to others. Where this condition is not\nmet, those who are denied access to the good do have a legitimate\nobjection to appropriation. According to Tully, Locke realized that as\nsoon as land became scarce, previous rights acquired by labor no\nlonger held since \u201cenough and as good\u201d was no longer\navailable for others. Once land became scarce, property could only be\nlegitimated by the creation of political society.\n\nWaldron (1988) claims that, contrary to Macpherson (1962), Tully\n(1980), and others, Locke did not recognize a sufficiency condition at\nall. He notes that, strictly speaking, Locke makes sufficiency a\nsufficient rather than necessary condition when he says that labor\ngenerates a title to property \u201cat least where there is enough,\nand as good left in common for others\u201d (Two Treatises\n2.27). Waldron takes Locke to be making a descriptive statement, not a\nnormative one, about the conditions that initially existed. Waldron\nalso argues that in the text \u201cenough and as good\u201d is not\npresented as a restriction and is not grouped with other restrictions.\nWaldron thinks that the condition would lead Locke to the absurd\nconclusion that in circumstances of scarcity everyone must starve to\ndeath since no one would be able to obtain universal consent and any\nappropriation would make others worse off.\n\nOne of the strongest defenses of Tully\u2019s position is presented\nby Sreenivasan (1995). He argues that Locke\u2019s repetitious use of\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d indicates that the phrase is doing\nsome real work in the argument. In particular, it is the only way\nLocke can be thought to have provided some solution to the fact that\nthe consent of all is needed to justify appropriation in the state of\nnature. If others are not harmed, they have no grounds to object and\ncan be thought to consent, whereas if they are harmed, it is\nimplausible to think of them as consenting. Sreenivasan does depart\nfrom Tully in some important respects. He takes \u201cenough and as\ngood\u201d to mean \u201cenough and as good opportunity for securing\none\u2019s preservation,\u201d not \u201cenough and as good of the\nsame commodity (such as land).\u201d This has the advantage of making\nLocke\u2019s account of property less radical since it does not claim\nthat Locke thought the point of his theory was to show that all\noriginal property rights were invalid at the point where political\ncommunities were created. The disadvantage of this interpretation, as\nSreenivasan admits, is that it saddles Locke with a flawed argument.\nThose who merely have the opportunity to labor for others at\nsubsistence wages no longer have the liberty that individuals had\nbefore scarcity to benefit from the full surplus of value they create.\nMoreover, poor laborers no longer enjoy equality of access to the\nmaterials from which products can be made. Sreenivasan thinks that\nLocke\u2019s theory is thus unable to solve the problem of how\nindividuals can obtain individual property rights in what is initially\nowned by all people without consent.\n\nSimmons (1992) presents a still different synthesis. He sides with\nWaldron (1988) and against Tully (1980) and Sreenivasan (1995) in\nrejecting the workmanship model. He claims that the references to\n\u201cmaking\u201d in chapter five of the Two Treatises are\nnot making in the right sense of the word for the workmanship model to\nbe correct. Locke thinks we have property in our own persons even\nthough we do not make or create ourselves. Simmons claims that while\nLocke did believe that God had rights as creator, human beings have a\ndifferent limited right as trustees, not as makers. Simmons\nbases this in part on his reading of two distinct arguments he takes\nLocke to make: the first justifies property based on God\u2019s will\nand basic human needs, the second based on \u201cmixing\u201d labor.\nAccording to the former argument, at least some property rights can be\njustified by showing that a scheme allowing appropriation of property\nwithout consent has beneficial consequences for the preservation of\nmankind. This argument is overdetermined, according to Simmons, in\nthat it can be interpreted either theologically or as a simple\nrule-consequentialist argument. With respect to the latter argument,\nSimmons takes labor not to be a substance that is literally\n\u201cmixed\u201d but rather as a purposive activity aimed at\nsatisfying needs and conveniences of life. Like Sreenivasan, Simmons\nsees this as flowing from a prior right of people to secure their\nsubsistence, but Simmons also adds a prior right to self-government.\nLabor can generate claims to private property because private property\nmakes individuals more independent and able to direct their own\nactions. Simmons thinks Locke\u2019s argument is ultimately flawed\nbecause he underestimated the extent to which wage labor would make\nthe poor dependent on the rich, undermining self-government. He also\njoins the chorus of those who find Locke\u2019s appeal to consent to\nthe introduction of money inadequate to justify the very unequal\nproperty holdings that now exist.\n\nSome authors have suggested that Locke may have had an additional\nconcern in mind in writing the chapter on property. Tully (1993) and\nBarbara Arneil (1996) point out that Locke was interested in and\ninvolved in the affairs of the American colonies and that\nLocke\u2019s theory of labor led to the convenient conclusion that\nthe labor of Native Americans generated property rights only over the\nanimals they caught, not the land on which they hunted which Locke\nregarded as vacant and available for the taking. David Armitage (2004)\neven argues that there is evidence that Locke was actively involved in\nrevising the  Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina  at the\nsame time he was drafting the chapter on property for the Second\nTreatise. Mark Goldie (1983), however, cautions that we should\nnot miss the fact that political events in England were still\nLocke\u2019s primary focus in writing the the Second\nTreatise. \n\nA final question concerns the status of those property rights acquired\nin the state of nature after civil society has come into being. It\nseems clear that at the very least Locke allows taxation to take place\nby the consent of the majority rather than requiring unanimous consent\n(2.140). Nozick (1974) takes Locke to be a libertarian, with the\ngovernment having no right to take property to use for the common good\nwithout the consent of the property owner. On his interpretation, the\nmajority may only tax at the rate needed to allow the government to\nsuccessfully protect property rights. At the other extreme, Tully\n(1980) thinks that, by the time government is formed, land is already\nscarce and so the initial holdings of the state of nature are no\nlonger valid and thus are no constraint on governmental action.\nWaldron\u2019s (1988) view is in between these, acknowledging that\nproperty rights are among the rights from the state of nature that\ncontinue to constrain the government, but seeing the legislature as\nhaving the power to interpret what natural law requires in this matter\nin a fairly substantial way.\n4. Consent, Political Obligation, and the Ends of Government\n\nThe most direct reading of Locke\u2019s political philosophy finds\nthe concept of consent playing a central role. His analysis begins\nwith individuals in a state of nature where they are not subject to a\ncommon legitimate authority with the power to legislate or adjudicate\ndisputes. From this natural state of freedom and independence, Locke\nstresses individual consent as the mechanism by which political\nsocieties are created and individuals join those societies. While\nthere are of course some general obligations and rights that all\npeople have from the law of nature, special obligations come about\nonly when we voluntarily undertake them. Locke clearly states that one\ncan only become a full member of society by an act of express consent\n(Two Treatises 2.122). The literature on Locke\u2019s theory\nof consent tends to focus on how Locke does or does not successfully\nanswer the following objection: few people have actually consented to\ntheir governments so no, or almost no, governments are actually\nlegitimate. This conclusion is problematic since it is clearly\ncontrary to Locke\u2019s intention.\n\nLocke\u2019s most obvious solution to this problem is his doctrine of\ntacit consent. Simply by walking along the highways of a country a\nperson gives tacit consent to the government and agrees to obey it\nwhile living in its territory. This, Locke thinks, explains why\nresident aliens have an obligation to obey the laws of the state where\nthey reside, though only while they live there. Inheriting property\ncreates an even stronger bond, since the original owner of the\nproperty permanently put the property under the jurisdiction of the\ncommonwealth. Children, when they accept the property of their\nparents, consent to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth over that\nproperty (Two Treatises 2.120). There is debate over whether\nthe inheritance of property should be regarded as tacit or express\nconsent. On one interpretation, by accepting the property, Locke\nthinks a person becomes a full member of society, which implies that\nhe must regard this as an act of express consent. Grant (1987)\nsuggests that Locke\u2019s ideal would have been an explicit\nmechanism of society whereupon adults would give express consent and\nthis would be a precondition of inheriting property. On the other\ninterpretation, Locke recognized that people inheriting property did\nnot in the process of doing so make any explicit declaration about\ntheir political obligation.\n\nHowever this debate is resolved, there will be in any current or\npreviously existing society many people who have never given express\nconsent, and thus some version of tacit consent seems needed to\nexplain how governments could still be legitimate. Simmons finds it\ndifficult to see how merely walking on a street or inheriting land can\nbe thought of as an example of a \u201cdeliberate, voluntary\nalienating of rights\u201d (Simmons 1993, 69). It is one thing, he\nargues, for a person to consent by actions rather than words; it is\nquite another to claim a person has consented without being aware that\nthey have done so. To require a person to leave behind all of their\nproperty and emigrate in order to avoid giving tacit consent is to\ncreate a situation where continued residence is not a free and\nvoluntary choice. Simmons\u2019 approach is to agree with Locke that\nreal consent is necessary for political obligation but disagree about\nwhether most people in fact have given that kind of consent. Simmons\nclaims that Locke\u2019s arguments push toward \u201cphilosophical\nanarchism,\u201d the position that most people do not have a moral\nobligation to obey the government, even though Locke himself would not\nhave made this claim.\n\nHannah Pitkin (1965) takes a very different approach. She claims that\nthe logic of Locke\u2019s argument makes consent far less important\nin practice than it might appear. Tacit consent is indeed a watering\ndown of the concept of consent, but Locke can do this because the\nbasic content of what governments are to be like is set by natural law\nand not by consent. If consent were truly foundational in\nLocke\u2019s scheme, we would discover the legitimate powers of any\ngiven government by finding out what contract the original founders\nsigned. Pitkin, however, thinks that for Locke the form and powers of\ngovernment are determined by natural law. What really matters,\ntherefore, is not previous acts of consent but the quality of the\npresent government, whether it corresponds to what natural law\nrequires. Locke does not think, for example, that walking the streets\nor inheriting property in a tyrannical regime means we have consented\nto that regime. It is thus the quality of the government, not acts of\nactual consent, that determine whether a government is legitimate.\nSimmons objects to this interpretation, saying that it fails to\naccount for the many places where Locke does indeed say a person\nacquires political obligations only by his own consent.\n\nJohn Dunn (1967) takes a still different approach. He claims that it\nis anachronistic to read into Locke a modern conception of what counts\nas \u201cconsent.\u201d While modern theories do insist that consent\nis truly consent only if it is deliberate and voluntary, Locke\u2019s\nconcept of consent was far broader. For Locke, it was enough that\npeople be \u201cnot unwilling.\u201d Voluntary acquiescence, on\nDunn\u2019s interpretation, is all that is needed. As evidence Dunn\ncan point to the fact that many of the instances of consent Locke\nuses, such as \u201cconsenting\u201d to the use of money, make more\nsense on this broad interpretation. Simmons objects that this ignores\nthe instances where Locke does talk about consent as a deliberate\nchoice and that, in any case, it would only make Locke consistent at\nthe price of making him unconvincing.\n\nRecent scholarship has continued to probe these issues. Davis (2014)\nclosely examines Locke\u2019s terminology and argues that we must\ndistinguish between political society and legitimate government. Only\nthose who have expressly consented are members of political society,\nwhile the government exercises legitimate authority over various types\nof people who have not so consented. The government is supreme in some\nrespects, but there is no sovereign. He also argues (2017) that one\ncould give actual consent in Locke\u2019s day by declaring\none\u2019s intent to cast a vote, rather than by voting for a\nparticular candidate. The former is more plausibly interpreted as an\nact of affirmative consent to be a member of a political society.\nRegistering to vote, as opposed to actually voting, would be a\ncontemporary analogue. Van der Vossen (2015) makes a related argument,\nclaiming that the initial consent of property owners is not the\nmechanism by which governments come to rule over a particular\nterritory. Rather, Locke thinks that people (probably fathers\ninitially) simply begin exercising political authority and people\ntacitly consent. This tacit consent is sufficient to justify a\nrudimentary state that rules over the consenters. Treaties between\nthese governments would then fix the territorial borders. Hoff (2015)\ngoes still further, arguing that we need not even think of specific\nacts of tacit consent (such as deciding not to emigrate) as necessary\nfor generating political obligation. Instead, consent is implied if\nthe government itself functions in ways that show it is answerable to\nthe people.\n\nA related question has to do with the extent of our obligation once\nconsent has been given. The interpretive school influenced by Strauss\nemphasizes the primacy of preservation. Since the duties of natural\nlaw apply only when our preservation is not threatened (Two\nTreatises 2.6), then our obligations cease in cases where our\npreservation is directly threatened. This has important implications\nif we consider a soldier who is being sent on a mission where death is\nextremely likely. Grant (1987) points out that Locke believes a\nsoldier who deserts from such a mission (2.139) is justly sentenced to\ndeath. Grant takes Locke to be claiming not only that desertion laws\nare legitimate in the sense that they can be blamelessly enforced\n(something Hobbes would grant) but that they also imply a moral\nobligation on the part of the soldier to give up his life for the\ncommon good (something Hobbes would deny). According to Grant, Locke\nthinks that our acts of consent can, in fact, extend to cases where\nliving up to our commitments will risk our lives. The decision to\nenter political society is a permanent one for precisely this reason:\nthe society will have to be defended and if people can revoke their\nconsent to help protect it when attacked, the act of consent made when\nentering political society would be pointless since the political\ncommunity would fail at the very point where it is most needed. People\nmake a calculated decision when they enter society, and the risk of\ndying in combat is part of that calculation. Grant also thinks Locke\nrecognizes a duty based on reciprocity since others risk their lives\nas well.\n\nMost of these approaches focus on Locke\u2019s doctrine of consent as\na solution to the problem of political obligation. A different\napproach asks what role consent plays in determining, here and now,\nthe legitimate ends that governments can pursue. One part of this\ndebate is captured by the debate between Seliger (1968) and Kendall\n(1959), the former viewing Locke as a constitutionalist and the latter\nviewing him as giving almost unlimited power to majorities. On the\nformer interpretation, a constitution is created by the consent of the\npeople as part of the creation of the commonwealth. On the latter\ninterpretation, the people create a legislature which rules by\nmajority vote. A third view, advanced by Tuckness (2002a), holds that\nLocke was flexible at this point and gave people considerable\nflexibility in constitutional drafting.\n\nA second part of the debate focuses on ends rather than institutions.\nLocke states in the Two Treatises that the power of the\nGovernment is limited to the public good. It is a power \u201cthat\nhath no other end but preservation\u201d and therefore cannot justify\nkilling, enslaving, or plundering the citizens (2.135). Libertarians\nlike Nozick (1974) read this as stating that governments exist only to\nprotect people from infringements on their rights. An alternate\ninterpretation, advanced by Tuckness (2002b, 2008a), draws attention\nto the fact that in the following sentences the formulation of natural\nlaw that Locke focuses on is a positive one, that \u201cas much as\npossible\u201d mankind is to be preserved. On this second reading,\ngovernment is limited to fulfilling the purposes of natural law, but\nthese include positive goals as well as negative rights. On this view,\nthe power to promote the common good extends to actions designed to\nincrease population, improve the military, strengthen the economy and\ninfrastructure, and so on, provided these steps are indirectly useful\nto the goal of preserving the society. This would explain why Locke,\nin the Letter, describes government promotion of \u201carms,\nriches, and multitude of citizens\u201d as the proper remedy for the\ndanger of foreign attack (Works 6: 42).\n5. Locke and Punishment\n\nJohn Locke defined political power as \u201ca right of making laws\nwith penalties of death, and consequently all less Penalties\u201d\n(Two Treatises 2.3). Locke\u2019s theory of punishment is\nthus central to his view of politics and part of what he considered\ninnovative about his political philosophy. But he also referred to his\naccount of punishment as a \u201cvery strange doctrine\u201d (2.9),\npresumably because it ran against the assumption that only political\nsovereigns could punish. Locke believed that punishment requires that\nthere be a law, and since the state of nature has the law of nature to\ngovern it, it is permissible to describe one individual as\n\u201cpunishing\u201d another in that state. Locke\u2019s rationale\nis that since the fundamental law of nature is that mankind be\npreserved and since that law would \u201cbe in vain\u201d with no\nhuman power to enforce it (Two Treatises 2.7), it must,\ntherefore, be legitimate for individuals to punish each other even\nbefore government exists. In arguing this, Locke was disagreeing with\nSamuel Pufendorf (1934). Samuel Pufendorf had argued strongly that the\nconcept of punishment made no sense apart from an established positive\nlegal structure.\n\nLocke realized that the crucial objection to allowing people to act as\njudges with power to punish in the state of nature was that such\npeople would end up being judges in their own cases. Locke readily\nadmitted that this was a serious inconvenience and a primary reason\nfor leaving the state of nature (Two Treatises 2.13). Locke\ninsisted on this point because it helped explain the transition into\ncivil society. Locke thought that in the state of nature men had a\nliberty to engage in \u201cinnocent delights\u201d (actions that are\nnot a violation of any applicable laws), to seek their own\npreservation within the limits of natural law, and to punish\nviolations of natural law. The power to seek one\u2019s preservation\nis limited in civil society by the law, and the power to punish is\ntransferred to the government (Two Treatises\n2.128\u2013130). The power to punish in the state of nature is thus\nthe foundation for the right of governments to use coercive force.\n\nThe situation becomes more complex, however, if we look at the\nprinciples which are to guide punishment. Rationales for punishment\nare often divided into those that are forward-looking and\nbackward-looking. Forward-looking rationales include deterring crime,\nprotecting society from dangerous persons, and rehabilitation of\ncriminals. Backward-looking rationales normally focus on retribution,\ninflicting on the criminal harm comparable to the crime. Locke may\nseem to conflate these two rationales in passages like the\nfollowing:\n\nAnd thus in the state of nature, one Man comes by a power over\nanother, but yet no absolute or arbitrary Power, to use a criminal\nwhen he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats,\nor boundless extravagancy of his own will, but only to retribute to\nhim, so far as calm reason and conscience dictates, what is\nproportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for\nreparation and restraint. For these two are the only reasons, why one\nman may lawfully do harm to another, which is that [which] we call\npunishment. (Two Treatises 2.8)\n\n\nLocke talks both of retribution and of punishing only for reparation\nand restraint. Simmons argues that this is evidence that Locke is\ncombining both rationales for punishment in his theory. A survey of\nother seventeenth-century natural rights justifications for\npunishment, however, indicates that it was common to use words like\n\u201cretribute\u201d in theories that reject what we would today\ncall retributive punishment (Tuckness 2010a). In the passage quoted\nabove, Locke is saying that the proper amount of punishment is the\namount that will provide restitution to injured parties, protect the\npublic, and deter future crime. Locke\u2019s attitude toward\npunishment in his other writings on toleration, education, and\nreligion consistently follows this path toward justifying punishment\non grounds other than retribution. Tuckness claims that Locke\u2019s\nemphasis on restitution is interesting because restitution is backward\nlooking in a sense (it seeks to restore an earlier state of affairs)\nbut also forward looking in that it provides tangible benefits to\nthose who receive the restitution. There is a link here between\nLocke\u2019s understanding of natural punishment and his\nunderstanding of legitimate state punishment. Even in the state of\nnature, a primary justification for punishment is that it helps\nfurther the positive goal of preserving human life and human property.\nThe emphasis on deterrence, public safety, and restitution in\npunishments administered by the government mirrors this emphasis.\n\nA second puzzle regarding punishment is the permissibility of\npunishing internationally. Locke describes international relations as\na state of nature, and so in principle, states should have the same\npower to punish breaches of the natural law in the international\ncommunity that individuals have in the state of nature. This would\nlegitimize, for example, punishment of individuals for war crimes or\ncrimes against humanity even in cases where neither the laws of the\nparticular state nor international law authorize punishment. Thus in\nWorld War II, even if \u201ccrimes of aggression\u201d was not at\nthe time recognized as a crime for which individual punishment was\njustified, if the actions violated the natural law principle that one\nshould not deprive another of life, liberty, or property, the guilty\nparties could still be liable to criminal punishment. The most common\ninterpretation has thus been that the power to punish internationally\nis symmetrical with the power to punish in the state of nature.\n\nTuckness (2008a), however, has argued that there is an asymmetry\nbetween the two cases because Locke also talks about states being\nlimited in the goals that they can pursue. Locke often says that the\npower of the government is to be used for the protection of the rights\nof its own citizens, not for the rights of all people everywhere\n(Two Treatises 1.92, 2.88, 2.95, 2.131, 2.147). Locke argues\nthat in the state of nature a person is to use the power to punish to\npreserve his society, which is mankind as a whole. After states are\nformed, however, the power to punish is to be used for the benefit of\nhis own particular society. In the state of nature, a person is not\nrequired to risk his life for another (Two Treatises 2.6),\nand this presumably would also mean a person is not required to punish\nin the state of nature when attempting to punish would risk the life\nof the punisher. Locke may therefore be objecting to the idea that\nsoldiers can be compelled to risk their lives for altruistic reasons.\nIn the state of nature, a person could refuse to attempt to punish\nothers if doing so would risk his life and so Locke reasons that\nindividuals may not have consented to allow the state to risk their\nlives for altruistic punishment of international crimes.\n6. Separation of Powers and the Dissolution of Government\n\nLocke claims that legitimate government is based on the idea of\nseparation of powers. First and foremost of these is the legislative\npower. Locke describes the legislative power as supreme (Two\nTreatises 2.149) in having ultimate authority over \u201chow the\nforce for the commonwealth shall be employed\u201d (2.143). The\nlegislature is still bound by the law of nature and much of what it\ndoes is set down laws that further the goals of natural law and\nspecify appropriate punishments for them (2.135). The executive power\nis then charged with enforcing the law as it is applied in specific\ncases. Interestingly, Locke\u2019s third power is called the\n\u201cfederative power\u201d and it consists of the right to act\ninternationally according to the law of nature. Since countries are\nstill in the state of nature with respect to each other, they must\nfollow the dictates of natural law and can punish one another for\nviolations of that law in order to protect the rights of their\ncitizens.\n\nThe fact that Locke does not mention the judicial power as a separate\npower becomes clearer if we distinguish powers from institutions.\nPowers relate to functions. To have a power means that there is a\nfunction (such as making the laws or enforcing the laws) that one may\nlegitimately perform. When Locke says that the legislative is supreme\nover the executive, he is not saying that parliament is supreme over\nthe king. Locke is simply affirming that \u201cwhat can give laws to\nanother, must needs be superior to him\u201d (Two Treatises\n2.150). Moreover, Locke thinks that it is possible for multiple\ninstitutions to share the same power; for example, the legislative\npower in his day was shared by the House of Commons, the House of\nLords, and the King. Since all three needed to agree for something to\nbecome law, all three are part of the legislative power (1.151). He\nalso thinks that the federative power and the executive power are\nnormally placed in the hands of the executive, so it is possible for\nthe same person to exercise more than one power (or function). There\nis, therefore, no one-to-one correspondence between powers and\ninstitutions (Tuckness 2002a).\n\nLocke is not opposed to having distinct institutions called courts,\nbut he does not see interpretation as a distinct function or power.\nFor Locke, legislation is primarily about announcing a general rule\nstipulating what types of actions should receive what types of\npunishments. The executive power is the power to make the judgments\nnecessary to apply those rules to specific cases and administer force\nas directed by the rule (Two Treatises 2.88\u201389). Both\nof these actions involve interpretation. Locke states that positive\nlaws \u201care only so far right, as they are founded on the law of\nnature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted\u201d\n(2.12). In other words, the executive must interpret the laws in light\nof its understanding of natural law. Similarly, legislation involves\nmaking the laws of nature more specific and determining how to apply\nthem to particular circumstances (2.135) which also calls for\ninterpreting natural law. Locke did not think of interpreting law as a\ndistinct function because he thought it was a part of both the\nlegislative and executive functions (Tuckness 2002a).\n\nIf we compare Locke\u2019s formulation of separation of powers to the\nlater ideas of Montesquieu (1989), we see that they are not so\ndifferent as they may initially appear. Although Montesquieu gives the\nmore well known division of legislative, executive, and judicial, as\nhe explains what he means by these terms he reaffirms the superiority\nof the legislative power and describes the executive power as having\nto do with international affairs (Locke\u2019s federative power) and\nthe judicial power as concerned with the domestic execution of the\nlaws (Locke\u2019s executive power). It is more the terminology than\nthe concepts that have changed. Locke considered arresting a person,\ntrying a person, and punishing a person as all part of the function of\nexecuting the law rather than as a distinct function (Tuckness\n2002a).\n\nLocke believed that it was important that the legislative power\ncontain an assembly of elected representatives, but as we have seen\nthe legislative power could contain monarchical and aristocratic\nelements as well. Locke believed the people had the freedom to create\n\u201cmixed\u201d constitutions that utilize all of these. For that\nreason, Locke\u2019s theory of separation of powers does not dictate\none particular type of constitution and does not preclude unelected\nofficials from having part of the legislative power. Locke was more\nconcerned that the people have representatives with sufficient power\nto block attacks on their liberty and attempts to tax them without\njustification. This is important because Locke also affirms that the\ncommunity remains the real supreme power throughout. The people retain\nthe right to \u201cremove or alter\u201d the legislative power\n(Two Treatises 2.149). This can happen for a variety of\nreasons. The entire society can be dissolved by a successful foreign\ninvasion (2.211), but Locke is more interested in describing the\noccasions when the people take power back from the government to which\nthey have entrusted it. If the rule of law is ignored, if the\nrepresentatives of the people are prevented from assembling, if the\nmechanisms of election are altered without popular consent, or if the\npeople are handed over to a foreign power, then they can take back\ntheir original authority and overthrow the government\n(2.212\u201317). They can also rebel if the government attempts to\ntake away their rights (2.222). Locke thinks this is justifiable since\noppressed people will likely rebel anyway, and those who are not\noppressed will be unlikely to rebel. Moreover, the threat of possible\nrebellion makes tyranny less likely to start with (2.224\u20136). For\nall these reasons, while there are a variety of legitimate\nconstitutional forms, the delegation of power under any constitution\nis understood to be conditional.\n\nLocke\u2019s understanding of separation of powers is complicated by\nthe doctrine of prerogative. Prerogative is the right of the executive\nto act without explicit authorization for a law, or even contrary to\nthe law, in order to better fulfill the laws that seek the\npreservation of human life. A king might, for example, order that a\nhouse be torn down in order to stop a fire from spreading throughout a\ncity (Two Treatises 2.159). Locke defines it more broadly as\n\u201cthe power of doing public good without a rule\u201d (2.166).\nThis poses a challenge to Locke\u2019s doctrine of legislative\nsupremacy. Locke handles this by explaining that the rationale for\nthis power is that general rules cannot cover all possible cases and\nthat inflexible adherence to the rules would be detrimental to the\npublic good and that the legislature is not always in session to\nrender a judgment (2.160). The relationship between the executive and\nthe legislature depends on the specific constitution. If the chief\nexecutive has no part in the supreme legislative power, then the\nlegislature could overrule the executive\u2019s decisions based on\nprerogative when it reconvenes. If, however, the chief executive has a\nveto, the result would be a stalemate between them. Locke describes a\nsimilar stalemate in the case where the chief executive has the power\nto call parliament and can thus prevent it from meeting by refusing to\ncall it into session. In such a case, Locke says, there is no judge on\nearth between them as to whether the executive has misused prerogative\nand both sides have the right to \u201cappeal to heaven\u201d in the\nsame way that the people can appeal to heaven against a tyrannical\ngovernment (2.168).\n\nThe concept of an \u201cappeal to heaven\u201d is an important\nconcept in Locke\u2019s thought. Locke assumes that people, when they\nleave the state of nature, create a government with some sort of\nconstitution that specifies which entities are entitled to exercise\nwhich powers. Locke also assumes that these powers will be used to\nprotect the rights of the people and to promote the public good. In\ncases where there is a dispute between the people and the government\nabout whether the government is fulfilling its obligations, there is\nno higher human authority to which one can appeal. The only appeal\nleft, for Locke, is the appeal to God. The \u201cappeal to\nheaven,\u201d therefore, involves taking up arms against your\nopponent and letting God judge who is in the right.\n7. Toleration\n\nIn Locke\u2019s Letter Concerning Toleration, he develops\nseveral lines of argument that are intended to establish the proper\nspheres for religion and politics. His central claims are that\ngovernment should not use force to try to bring people to the true\nreligion and that religious societies are voluntary organizations that\nhave no right to use coercive power over their own members or those\noutside their group. One recurring line of argument that Locke uses is\nexplicitly religious. Locke argues that neither the example of Jesus\nnor the teaching of the New Testament gives any indication that force\nis a proper way to bring people to salvation. He also frequently\npoints out what he takes to be clear evidence of hypocrisy, namely\nthat those who are so quick to persecute others for small differences\nin worship or doctrine are relatively unconcerned with much more\nobvious moral sins that pose an even greater threat to their eternal\nstate.\n\nIn addition to these and similar religious arguments, Locke gives\nthree reasons that are more philosophical in nature for barring\ngovernments from using force to encourage people to adopt religious\nbeliefs (Works 6:10\u201312). First, he argues that the care\nof men\u2019s souls has not been committed to the magistrate by\neither God or the consent of men. This argument resonates with the\nstructure of argument used so often in the Two Treatises to\nestablish the natural freedom and equality of mankind. There is no\ncommand in the Bible telling magistrates to bring people to the true\nfaith, and people could not consent to such a goal for government\nbecause it is not possible for people, at will, to believe what the\nmagistrate tells them to believe. Their beliefs are a function of what\nthey think is true, not what they will. Locke\u2019s second argument\nis that since the power of the government is only force, while true\nreligion consists of genuine inward persuasion of the mind, force is\nincapable of bringing people to the true religion. Locke\u2019s third\nargument is that even if the magistrate could change people\u2019s\nminds, a situation where everyone accepted the magistrate\u2019s\nreligion would not bring more people to the true religion. Many of the\nmagistrates of the world believe religions that are false.\n\nLocke\u2019s contemporary, Jonas Proast (1999a), responded by saying\nthat Locke\u2019s three arguments really amount to just two, that\ntrue faith cannot be forced and that we have no more reason to think\nthat we are right than anyone else has. Proast argued that force can\nbe helpful in bringing people to the truth \u201cindirectly, and at a\ndistance.\u201d His idea was that although force cannot directly\nbring about a change of mind or heart, it can cause people to consider\narguments that they would otherwise ignore or prevent them from\nhearing or reading things that would lead them astray. If force is\nindirectly useful in bringing people to the true faith, then Locke has\nnot provided a persuasive argument. As for Locke\u2019s argument\nabout the harm of a magistrate whose religion is false using force to\npromote it, Proast claimed that this was irrelevant since there is a\nmorally relevant difference between affirming that the magistrate may\npromote the religion he thinks true and affirming that he may promote\nthe religion that actually is true. Proast thought that unless one was\na complete skeptic, one must believe that the reasons for one\u2019s\nown position are objectively better than those for other\npositions.\n\nJeremy Waldron (1993) restated the substance of Proast\u2019s\nobjection for a contemporary audience. He argued that, leaving aside\nLocke\u2019s Christian arguments, his main position was that it was\ninstrumentally irrational, from the perspective of the persecutor, to\nuse force in matters of religion because force acts only on the will,\nand belief is not something that we change at will. Waldron pointed\nout that this argument blocks only one particular reason for\npersecution, not all reasons. Thus it would not stop someone who used\nreligious persecution for some end other than religious conversion,\nsuch as preserving the peace. Even in cases where persecution does\nhave a religious goal, Waldron agrees with Proast that force may be\nindirectly effective in changing people\u2019s beliefs. Some of the\ncurrent discussion about Locke\u2019s contribution to contemporary\npolitical philosophy in the area of toleration centers on whether\nLocke has a good reply to these objections from Proast and Waldron.\nTuckness (2008b) and Tate (2016) argue that Locke deemphasized the\nrationality argument in his later writings. \n\nSome contemporary commentators try to rescue Locke\u2019s argument by\nredefining the religious goal that the magistrate is presumed to seek.\nSusan Mendus (1989), for example, notes that successful brainwashing\nmight cause a person to sincerely utter a set of beliefs, but that\nthose beliefs might still not count as genuine. Beliefs induced by\ncoercion might be similarly problematic. Paul Bou Habib (2003) argues\nthat what Locke is really after is sincere inquiry and that Locke\nthinks inquiry undertaken only because of duress is necessarily\ninsincere. These approaches thus try to save Locke\u2019s argument by\nshowing that force really is incapable of bringing about the desired\nreligious goal.\n\nOther commentators focus on Locke\u2019s first argument about proper\nauthority, and particularly on the idea that authorization must be by\nconsent. David Wootton (1993) argues that even if force occasionally\nworks at changing a person\u2019s belief, it does not work often\nenough to make it rational for persons to consent to the government\nexercising that power. A person who has good reason to think he will\nnot change his beliefs even when persecuted has good reason to prevent\nthe persecution scenario from ever happening. Richard Vernon (1997)\nargues that we want not only to hold right beliefs, but also to hold\nthem for the right reasons. Since the balance of reasons rather than\nthe balance of force should determine our beliefs, we would not\nconsent to a system in which irrelevant reasons for belief might\ninfluence us. Richard Tate (2016) argues that the strongest argument\nof Locke for toleration is rooted in the fact that we do not consent\nto giving government authority in this area, only the promotion of our\nsecular interests, interests that Locke thought a policy of toleration\nwould further. \n\nStill other commentators focus on the third argument, that the\nmagistrate might be wrong. Here the question is whether Locke\u2019s\nargument is question-begging or not. The two most promising lines of\nargument are the following. Wootton (1993) argues that there are very\ngood reasons, from the standpoint of a given individual, for thinking\nthat governments will be wrong about which religion is true.\nGovernments are motivated by the quest for power, not truth, and are\nunlikely to be good guides in religious matters. Since there are so\nmany different religions held by rulers, if only one is true then\nlikely my own ruler\u2019s views are not true. Wootton thus takes\nLocke to be showing that it is irrational, from the perspective of the\nindividual, to consent to government promotion of religion. A\ndifferent interpretation of the third argument is presented by\nTuckness. He argues that the likelihood that the magistrate may be\nwrong generates a principle of toleration based on what is rational\nfrom the perspective of a legislator, not the perspective of an\nindividual citizen or ruler. Drawing on Locke\u2019s later writings\non toleration, he argues that Locke\u2019s theory of natural law\nassumes that God, as author of natural law, takes into account the\nfallibility of those magistrates who will carry out the commands of\nnatural law. If \u201cuse force to promote the true religion\u201d\nwere a command of natural law addressed to all magistrates, it would\nnot promote the true religion in practice because so many magistrates\nwrongly believe that their religion is the true one. Tuckness claims\nthat in Locke\u2019s later writings on toleration he moved away from\narguments based on what it is instrumentally rational for an\nindividual to consent to. Instead, he emphasized human fallibility and\nthe need for universal principles.\n8. Education and Politics\n\nLocke\u2019s epistemological positions in the Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding lead him to take education to be extremely\nimportant for his political philosophy. His attack on innate ideas\nincreases the importance of giving children the right sort of\neducation to help them get the right sorts of ideas. He also notes in\nthe Essay that human beings govern themselves by a variety of\ndifferent laws, the most practically efficacious of which is the\n\u201cLaw of Opinion or Reputation.\u201d (Essay\n2.28.10) Since people are often highly motivated to be well thought of\nby others, the moral standards that are operative within a society for\nallocating praise and blame are powerful and important. Ideally, these\nsocial norms will reinforce natural law and thus help stabilize\npolitical society. Locke\u2019s educational writings suggest how\nchildren might be raised in such a way that they will be the sorts of\ncitizens who function well in a liberal society (Tarcov 1984). Some\nthink that Locke\u2019s approach to education, which centers\neducation within the family, gives the state too little influence over\nthe formation of future citizens (Gutmann 1999), while others think\nLocke actually gives the state considerable power to regulate\neducation (Tuckness 2010b).\n\nLocke\u2019s main educational writing is Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation, and it is based on letters of advice that Locke wrote\nto his friend Edward Clarke. This context means that the book assumes\na person of relative wealth who will be overseeing the education of\nhis son. The book was extremely popular and went through numerous\neditions in the century after its publication. One of the striking\nfeatures of the book is the way parents are encouraged to develop and\naugment the child\u2019s love for praise and esteem (Some\nThoughts, 56\u201362). Cultivating this desire helps the child\nlearn to hold in check other harmful desires, such as the desire for\ndominion, and to learn to control impulses by not acting on them until\nafter reflecting on them.\n\nSome contemporary critics of Locke, inspired by Foucault, argue that\nLocke\u2019s education is not a recipe for liberty but for forming\nchildren who will be compliant subjects of liberal regimes (Baltes\n2016, Carrig 2001, Metha 1992). Locke encourages parents to tightly\nregulate the social environments of children to avoid children being\ncorrupted by the wrong ideas and influences. Locke hopes for children\nwho have internalized strong powers of self-denial and a work ethic\nthat will make them compliant in an emerging modern economy. If\nparents are tightly controlling the child\u2019s educational\nenvironment with the goal of producing a particular sort of child, and\nif in reality people are primarily guided by the repetitional norms\nthat govern praise and blame, critics claim that this reveals the\nautonomous liberal subject to be, in reality, a guise for imposed\nconformity.\n\nDefenders of Locke argue that this critique underestimates the\norientation of Locke\u2019s education toward meaningful freedom.\nThere are reasons for thinking that, under normal circumstances, the\nlaw of nature and the law of reputation will coincide with each other,\nminimizing the potential harms that come from people following the law\nof reputation (Stuart-Buttle 2017). Locke\u2019s education is\ndesigned to increase compliance with natural law (Brady 2013). Much\ndepends on whether one thinks conformity with natural law decreases or\nincreases freedom. While it is true that Locke recognizes the social\nnature of the Lockean subject, Locke does not think habituation and\nautonomy are necessarily opposed (Koganzon 2016, Nazar 2017). Because\nhuman beings naturally conform to the prevailing norms in their\nsociety, in the absence of a Lockean education people would not be\nmore free because they would simply conform to those norms.\nLocke\u2019s education is designed to give children the ability, when\nthey are older, to evaluate critically, and possibly reject,\nprevailing norms. Locke also assumes that the isolation of early\nchildhood will end and that adolescent children will normally think\ndifferently from their parents (Koganzon 2016). In fact, Locke may\neven use custom to help people rationally evaluate their customary\nprejudices (Grant 2012).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Select Primary Sources", "Select Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Select Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Filmer, Robert, 1991, <em>Sir Robert Filmer: Patriarcha and Other\nWritings</em>, Johann P.
