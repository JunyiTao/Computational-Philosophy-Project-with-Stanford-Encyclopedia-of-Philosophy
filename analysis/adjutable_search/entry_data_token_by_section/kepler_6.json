    "main_text": "Epistemology and philosophy of sciences || Philosophy of mathematics\n4.3 Philosophy of mathematics\n\nBeyond his own original talent, it is clear that Kepler was trained in\nmathematics from his earliest studies at T\u00fcbingen. At least\nofficially, his positions at Graz, Prague, Linz, Ulm and Sagan can be\ncharacterized as the typical professional occupations of a\nmathematician in the broadest sense, i.e., including astrology and\nastronomy, theoretical mechanics and pneumatics, metrology, and every\ntopic that could in some way be related to mathematics. Besides the\nfield of astronomy and optics, where mathematics is ordinarily applied\nin different ways, Kepler produced original contributions to the\ntheory of logarithms and above all within his favorite field, geometry\n(especially with his stereometrical investigations. For the medieval\nproportions theory as a background for Kepler's logarithms, see\nRommevaux-Tani, 2018). Thus, on account of his natural predilection\nand talent and the importance of mathematics, particularly of\ngeometry, for his thought, it is not surprising to find many different\npassages in his works where he articulated his philosophy of\nmathematics. However, Kepler\u2019s principal exposition on this\ntopic is to be found in his HM, a work in which the first two books\nare purely mathematical in content. As he himself declares, in HM he\nplayed the role \u201cnot of a geometer in philosophy but of a\nphilosopher in this part of geometry\u201d (KGW 6, p. 20, Engl.\ntrans., p. 14).\n\nWhile in philosophical questions related to mathematics, Proclus and\nPlato were Kepler\u2019s most important inspirational sources, he did\nnot always see Plato and Aristotle as completely opposed, for the\nlatter\u2014in Kepler\u2019s interpretation\u2014also accepted\n\u201ca certain existence of the mathematical entities\u201d (KGW\n14, let. N\u00b0 226, p. 265; see Peters, p. 130). To a great extent\nKepler understood his mathematical investigations of HM as a\ncontinuation of Euclid\u2019s Elements, especially of the\nanalysis of irrationalities in Book 10. The central notion that he\nworks out here is that of \u201cconstructability\u201d. According to\nKepler, each branch of knowledge must, in principle, be reducible to\ngeometry if it is to be accepted as knowledge in the strong sense\n(although, in the case of the physics, this condition is, as the AN\nemphasizes, only a necessary and not a sufficient condition). Thus,\nthe new principles he was elaborating over the years in astrology were\ngeometrical ones. A similar case occurs with the basic notions of\nharmony, which, after Kepler, could be reduced to geometry. Of course,\nnot every geometrical statement is equally relevant and equally\nfundamental. For Kepler, the geometrical entities, principles and\npropositions which are especially fundamental are those that can be\nconstructed in the classical sense, i.e., using only ruler (without\nmeasurement units) and compass. On this are based further notions\naccording to different degrees of \u201cknowability\u201d\n(scibilitas), which begins with the circle and its diameter.\nOnce again, Kepler understood this within the framework of his\ncosmological and theological philosophy: geometry, and especially\ngeometrically constructible entities, have a higher meaning than other\nkinds of knowledge because God has used them to delineate and to\ncreate this perfect harmonic world. From this point of view, it is\nclear that Kepler defends a Platonist conception of mathematics, that\nhe cannot assume the Aristotelian theory of abstraction and that he is\nnot able to accept algebra, at least in the way he understood it. So,\nfor instance, there are figures that cannot be constructed\n\u201cgeometrically\u201d, although they are often assumed as safe\ngeometrical knowledge. The best example of this is perhaps the\nheptagon. This figure cannot be described outside of the circle, and\nin the circle its sides have, of course, a determinate magnitude, but\nthis is not knowable. Kepler himself says that this is important\nbecause here he finds the explanation for why God did not use such\nfigures to structure the world. Consequently, he devotes many pages to\ndiscussing the issue (KGW 6, Prop. 45, pp. 47\u201356, see also KGW\n9, p. 147). Certainly for a geometer like Kepler, approximations\nconstitute \u2013 as mathematical theory\u2014a painful and\nprecarious way to progress. The philosophical background for his\nrejection of algebra seems to be, at least partially, Aristotelian in\nsome of its basic suppositions: geometrical quantities are continuous\nquantities which therefore cannot be treated with numbers that are, in\nthe inverse, discrete quantities. But the difference from the\nAristotelian ideal of science remains an important one: for Aristotle,\na crossover between arithmetic and geometry is allowed only in the\ncase of the \u201cmiddle sciences\u201d, while for Kepler all\nknowledge must be reduced to its geometrical foundations. Recent\nresearch has tried to show that Kepler has followed the criteria of a\n\u201cPythagorean methodology\u201d when studying the phenomena of\nlight refraction. This would be evident in Kepler\u2019s application\nof the principle of \u201csameness is knowable by sameness\u201d\nand, additionally, in his tendency to avoid the infinite or, rather,\nto set limits to infinite magnitudes (Cardona Su\u00e1rez 2016).\n",
