    "main_text": "al-Ghazali\n6. al-Ghazali\n\nRemarkably, there are clues that even the main representative of\nArab-Islamic Sunnite theology, al-Ghazali (1058-1111), exerted an\nimportant \u2018influence\u2019 over some aspects of Medieval Jewish\nphilosophy and thought. This fact has not yet been systematically\nstudied and explained by scholars, but it cannot be easily neglected.\nMoreover, in the 14th century there was apparently a sort\nof \u201cJewish Ghazalism\u201d, based upon al-Ghazali\u2019s works\n(both philosophical and theological ones), so that many aspects of his\nthought as a typical Islamic thinker were curiously employed for\ndefending some similar aspects of Jewish religious tradition.\n\nThe first sure traces of an influence of al-Ghazali on Judaic thought\nappeared rather early, around 1160, when Abraham Ibn Daud employed his\nmajor philosophical work, The Intentions of the Philosophers,\nas one of the main unavowed sources of his Exalted Faith (see\nEran 1998, 27). Significantly enough, al-Ghazali\u2019s work\ninfluenced not only the contents of book one of the Exalted\nFaith, about some aspects of Aristotelian philosophy (logic,\nphysics, and metaphysics), but also book two of it, about theology\n(God\u2019s incorporeity, unity, attributes, as well as divine\ncreation, prophecy, and providence). Possibly, al-Ghazali might have\nexerted a similar influence over Maimonides too, and over his\nphilosophical thought in particular. As a matter of fact, there are no\ndirect and explicit mentions of al-Ghazali either in the Guide of\nthe Perplexed or in Maimonides\u2019 above mentioned letter to\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon; but some traces of Avicennian doctrines in some of\nMaimonides\u2019 works (both in the Guide and in other ones)\ncould also be explained as the results of an influence of Avicenna by\nmeans of al-Ghazali, and of the latter\u2019s Intentions of the\nPhilosophers in particular, as pointed out by Herbert Davidson\nand other scholars (Davidson 2005, 104; see also Pines 1971, 958; for\na particular case-study, see Eran 2001). Davidson, in particular,\naffirms that \u201cvirtually every of a metaphysical character\nattributed by Maimonides to Aristotle but actually deriving from\nAvicenna was available to him through Ghazali\u201d: according to\nhim, there are striking similarities, even in some points of the\nphraseology, between Maimonides and al-Ghazali, about these points\n(Davidson 2004, 732; see also Davidson 2005, 115).\n\nDirect and explicit proofs of the influence of al-Ghazali on Medieval\nJewish philosophy appeared in Spain and Provence from 1270 onwards.\nThe first case is found in Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera\u2019s Book of\nDegrees, two passages of which were surely taken from the\nIntentions of the Philosophers (Chiesa 1986, 86). The second\nand more important case is that of Isaac Albalag, a Catalan or\nProven\u00e7al Jewish philosopher who first translated the work into\nHebrew, and then commented on it in his work Correction of the\nOpinions (of the Philosophers) (Tiqqun ha-de\u2018ot),\nwritten at the end of the 13th century. As shown by Vajda,\nwho published a critical edition of Albalag\u2019s commentary and\nstudied its philosophical contents in detail (Vajda 1960, Yishaq\nAlbalag 1973), he did not employ al-Ghazali for defending him, but for\ncriticizing him instead: contrary to al-Ghazali, Albalag even seems to\nhave adopted the doctrine of the existence of two truths, the\nphilosophical one (reserved for wise and experienced philosophers) and\nthe religious one (reserved for common people). After Albalag, in the\nfirst half of the 14th century al-Ghazali\u2019s\nIntentions were translated into Hebrew in Provence twice: by\nJudah Natan, who allegedly wrote this translation for refuting the\narguments of the \u201cphilosophists\u201d (in Hebrew,\nmitfalsefim), i.e. the Averroists (see above, 5); and by an\nanonymous translator, possibly identical to, or working for, Moses\nNarboni. As a matter of fact, Narboni commented on the\nIntentions in a totally different, substantially Averroist\nway (see Steinschneider 1893, 311\u2013319). Other evident proofs of\nthe direct influence of al-Ghazali\u2019s philosophical work on\n14th-century Judaic thought are found in some Spanish\nauthors, active after 1350, for example in Moses ben Judah\u2019s\nphilosophical encyclopedia, The Love of (Intellectual)\nPleasures (Ahavah ba-ta\u2018anugim), written in 1354\n(Eisenmann 2000). In 15th-century Spain and even later,\nmany commentaries, mostly on the metaphysical section of the\nIntentions, were written by some philosophers (Isaac Ibn Shem\nTov, Eli Habillo, Moses Almosnino, and some anonymous authors): they\nwere identified by Steinschneider (Steinschneider 1893, 320\u2013325)\nbut are still in need of a deeper study. This wide employment of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s work as a philosophical source might be explained\nas an easier way to the knowledge of the general contents of\nAristotelian logic, physics, and metaphysics (see Harvey 2001).\n\nHowever, al-Ghazali\u2019s Intentions was not his only work\nknown and employed as a source by Late Medieval Jewish authors. They\nwere surely influenced by other two philosophical works by him about\nlogic: The Balance of Knowledge (Mi\u2018yar\nal-\u2018ilm) and The Touchstone of Intellect\n(Mihakk al-nazar). Both were explicitly quoted by Todros\nTodrosi in his philosophical anthology, and the first of them,\npossibly translated into Hebrew before the end of the 15th\ncentury, was surely employed as a source by two Jewish philosophers,\nZerahyah Hen (active in Rome, 1277\u20131290) and Moses Narboni. Some\nof these authors, mostly living in the Northern Spanish area, knew and\nemployed some of al-Ghazali\u2019s ethical and even theological works\n(see Steinschneider 1893, 328\u2013330, 342\u2013347): the\nBalance of Actions (Mizan al-a\u2018mal) was\ntranslated into Hebrew by Abraham Ibn Hasdai of Barcelona around\n1210\u20131230; the Lamps of Lights (Mishkat\nal-anwar) was twice translated in the 14th century;\nthe Incoherence of Philosophy (Tahafut al-falasifa)\nwas translated before 1411 by Zerahyah ha-Levi Saladin \u2013\nprobably, a member of the Catalan circle of Hasdai Crescas, who might\nhave employed al-Ghazali\u2019s work as one of the undeclared sources\nof his famous Light of the Lord (Or Adonai), a deep\ncritique of some key points of Aristotelian philosophy. (However, this\nhypothesis has been criticized by Harry A. Wolfson: see Wolfson 1929a,\n11\u201316.)\n",
