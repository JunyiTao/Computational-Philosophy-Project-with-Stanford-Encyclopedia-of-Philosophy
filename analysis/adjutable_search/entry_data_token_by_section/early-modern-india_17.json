    "main_text": "Causation and the Causal Theory of Knowledge || The Three Types of Cause\n6.2 The Three Types of Cause\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas traditionally held that, within\nthe total collection (s\u0101magr\u012b) of causal factors\nleading to an event, there are three distinguishable types of cause,\nnamely \u2018substrate\u2019 or \u2018inherence\u2019 causes\n(samavayi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a), \u2018non-substrate\u2019 or\n\u2018non-inherence\u2019 causes\n(a-samavayi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a), and\n\u2018instrumental\u2019 causes\n(nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a). This classification is repeated\nby The Manual of Reason (TS 43). A substrate cause is a\nsubstance in which the effect inheres. The substrate cause of a pot\nwould be the pot-halves; of a cloth, the threads. This is because the\nNy\u0101ya say that a whole inheres in its parts, and, so, if the\neffect (e.g. the pot) is a whole, its substrate causes are the parts\nin which it inheres. If the effect is an object\u2019s coming to have\na new property (e.g. the tree\u2019s being felled), the substrate\ncause is the object (the tree). Note that, in spite of a certain\nsimilarity, the notion of a substrate cause is not the same as\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cmaterial\u201d cause, for (i) the parts of\nan object are not necessarily identical with the material from which\nit is composed, and (ii) even an immaterial substance can be a\nsubstrate cause, for example the soul, which is the substrate cause of\nepistemic events.\n\nAll other causal factors are either \u2018non-substrate\u2019 causes\nor \u2018instrumental\u2019 causes. A non-substrate cause is one\nwhich inheres in the substrate cause. Thus, though not being the\nsubstrate, it is closely connected with it. The conjunction of threads\nis said to be a non-substrate cause of a piece of cloth. Another\nexample is often cited. The non-substrate cause of the colour of a\npiece of cloth is the colour of the threads (which colour inheres in\nthe threads, in which inheres the effect, the colour of the cloth).\nAny other causal factor is called an instrumental cause, for example,\nthe weaver\u2019s shuttle or the weaver herself. Why did the\nNaiy\u0101yikas distinguish between non-substrate causes and the\nremainder? Perhaps it was an attempt to differentiate between those\ncauses which must continue to exist for the effect to exist, and those\nwhich need not. If the threads were to lose their colour, then the\ncloth would lose its, and if the threads were to become disjoint, the\ncloth would cease to exist altogether. If, however, the weaver dies,\nhaving already woven the cloth, or if the shuttle is subsequently\ndestroyed, it will not affect the continued existence of the\neffect.\n\nIt does not follow from these definitions that anything which inheres\nin the substrate is a non-substrate cause, or that anything which does\nnot is an instrumental cause. In other words, we still need to define\n\u201cbeing a cause\u201d. First, however, two more types of causal\nfactor are distinguished by the Ny\u0101ya. These are the\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause (kara\u1e47a) and\nthe \u2018operating condition\u2019 (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) We\noften speak of the cause of an effect, and in doing so pick\nout one factor from the total collection of causal factors as being\nparticularly salient or important in bringing about the effect.\nIntuitively, the idea is that, even if we have the substrate cause\n(the pot-halves), the non-substrate cause (the contact between the\nhalves), and even some of the instrumental causes (the potter, etc.),\nwe will not get the effect (the pot) unless the potter acts or\n\u2018operates\u2019 to bring it about. In a sense, then, it is the\npotter\u2019s actually using his stick which is the cause of\nthe pot. The Naiy\u0101yikas try to capture this idea by saying that\none of the instrumental causes is the \u2018special\u2019\n(as\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a) cause of the effect, and they\ncall it the \u2018kara\u1e47a\u2019. This notion is\nparticularly important to the Ny\u0101ya epistemology (see below).\nWhat constitutes the \u2018special\u2019 nature of this cause? The\nNavya-ny\u0101ya (cf. TS 54) answer is as follows. They introduce\nfirst the notion of an \u2018operative condition\u2019\n(vy\u0101p\u0101ra), defined as that cause which immediately\nprecedes the effect. For example, the operative condition for a pot is\nthe conjunction of the pot-halves; for the felling of a tree, it is\nthe final contact between axe and tree before the tree falls. The\n\u2018special\u2019 cause is defined as that factor which\n\u2018brings about\u2019 this operative condition. In other words,\nit is the factor whose operation directly brings about the effect. In\nthe examples, it would be the axe or the potter\u2019s stick. These\nobjects are, for the Ny\u0101ya, the true instruments by means of\nwhich the effect is produced.\n",
