    "main_text": "Accounts of the Infelicity of Category Mistakes || Pragmatic Approach\n3.3 Pragmatic Approach\n\n\nA third approach to accounting for the infelicity of category mistakes\nis to maintain that they are syntactically well-formed, meaningful,\nand truth-valued but pragmatically inappropriate.\n\n\nThe most natural way to develop a pragmatic account of category\nmistakes is to appeal to Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation.\nAccording to Grice\u2019s maxim of quality, one ought not to assert\nwhat one believes to be false. Since atomic category mistakes are\n arguably trivially\n false[24],\n it seems obvious to participants in the conversation that the speaker is\nuttering something that they do not believe, violating the maxim. Thus\nunless the speaker is interpreted as attempting to communicate\nsomething other than the literal content of the sentence (e.g. a\nmetaphorical meaning), the utterance would be infelicitous.\n\n\nOne problem for this approach is that while trivially false sentences\nsuch as \\(2 + 2 = 5\\) are conversationally inappropriate at some\nlevel, they don\u2019t seem to suffer from the kind of severe\ninfelicity that we see with category mistakes. (Indeed, an indication\nof this difference is that, unlike the case of category mistakes,\nthere is no temptation to classify \u2018\\(2 + 2 = 5\\)\u2019 as\nmeaningless or even truth-valueless.) Another difficulty for the\naccount as we sketched it is that not all category mistakes are\ntrivially false. Consider the following:\n\n(24)\nThe number two isn\u2019t green.\n\n\n\nThis sentence seems just as infelicitous as its non-negated\ncounterpart, and yet it is not trivially false (if anything, it seems\ntrivially true). This is not yet a serious problem for the Gricean account\nof category mistakes. The account can be easily extended to address\nthis example as well: according to Grice\u2019s maxim of quantity,\none should make their contribution as informative as required. But\ntrivially true sentences (such as, it is claimed, (24)) are clearly\nnot informative, thus violating the maxim of quantity. There are\ntrickier cases, however, ones of category mistakes that are neither\ntrivially true nor trivially false. Consider for example the\nfollowing:\n\n(25)\nEither the temperature in London is green, or the temperature in London is zero degrees.\n\n\n\nThis sentence is arguably also infelicitous in the way which is\ntypical of category mistakes, but (assuming category mistakes are\ntruth-valued, as per the pragmatic approach) whether (25) is true or\nfalse depends entirely on the truth value of the second\ndisjunct\u2014which is itself neither trivially true nor trivially\nfalse.\n\n\nIn the next section (\u00a73.4) we will see a different pragmatic (or\nat least semi-pragmatic) approach.\n",
