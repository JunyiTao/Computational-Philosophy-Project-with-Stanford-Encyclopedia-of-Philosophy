    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nHerbert Feigl was born on December 14, 1902, in the then Austrian town\nof Reichenberg (nowadays Liberec, Czech Republic). Feigl\u2019s\nparents were Jewish, but not religious. His father, a trained weaver,\nwas said to be an ardent atheist; he was a skillful and highly\ningenious textile designer and became later in his career one of the\nmost influential leaders in the Austrian textile industry.\nFeigl\u2019s mother, who had a lifelong interest in the arts, filled\nhim with enthusiasm for classical music, particularly for the\nsymphonies of Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler. In 1921, Feigl began\nto study mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of\nMunich. Because of the anti-Semitic climate in Germany (and in\nparticular in Munich) he moved, in 1922, to the University of Vienna\nwhere he studied under Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, Hans Thirring, and\nKarl B\u00fchler. In the very same year, he wrote an essay on the\nphilosophical significance of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity\nfor which he obtained a prize in a competition (with Schlick, Ernst\nvon Aster and Max von Laue as referees). In 1924, Feigl became one of\nthe co-founders of the Vienna Circle. In 1927, he finished his\ndoctoral dissertation in philosophy on the relationship between chance\nand law in the natural sciences. Inspired by discussions with Karl\nPopper and Hans Reichenbach, Feigl, in 1929, published the monograph\nTheorie und Erfahrung in der Physik. In the same year, he\ngave a series of lectures at the Bauhaus in Dessau, between which and\nthe Vienna Circle there were interesting parallels in both\nintellectual outlook and political approach (see Galison 1990). In\n1930 Feigl married Maria Kasper, a fellow student at the University of\nVienna, and had a son (Eric Feigl).\n\nFor reasons of anti-Semitism and occupational hopelessness, Feigl, in\n1930, decided to emigrate to the United States. Funded by a\nRockefeller Research Fellowship, he first stayed for eight months at\nHarvard University. Together with Albert E. Blumberg he wrote the\nprogrammatic article \u201cLogical Positivism: A New Movement in\nEuropean Philosophy\u201d (published in the spring of 1931 in the\nJournal of Philosophy).\u00a0Feigl\u2019s emigration plans\nthen became manifest. \u00a0Retrospectively, he reports:\n\nDuring the spring of 1931 [\u2026] it became clear to me that my\nchances for a teaching position in an Austrian or German University\nwere extremely slim. True, the ever so optimistic and kindly Schlick\nwas convinced that I would obtain a Privatdozentur (position as a\nlecturer) at the University of Vienna. But though I was Austrian by\nbirth, I had become a Czechoslovakian citizen after the revolution in\n1918. My home was then Reichenberg (Liberec), in the Sudetenland,\nwhere I was born and grew up, and had attended primary and secondary\nschools. My parents, though thoroughly \u2018assimilated\u2019, were\nof Jewish decent. More realistic than Schlick, I abandoned the idea of\na teaching career in Europe, and began applying in a number of\nAmerican universities.\u00a0(Feigl 1981, pp. 73\u20134)\n\nIn advance of applying to American universities, Feigl received\nletters of recommendation from Albert Einstein, Percy W. Bridgman, C.\nI. Lewis, and Alfred North Whitehead. Lewis wrote in his letter of\nApril 14, 1931: \u201cDr. Feigl is one of the group \u2013 with\nCarnap, Reichenbach, and Schlick \u2013 who represents the newly\nformulated \u2018neo-positivism,\u2019 which represents what we in\nAmerica are sure to regard as the most promising of present movements\nin Continental philosophy.\u201d (Quoted in Limbeck-Lilienau 2010, p.\n102) Feigl himself looking back:\n\nThree universities, Rutgers, New York University, and the State\nUniversity of Iowa, were the only ones that wanted to \u2018look me\nover\u2019, and toward the end of May 1931 I visited all three\nplaces. The late Dean George Kay [of the University of Iowa]\ntelephoned Professor Lewis long distance. As Lewis related to me, Dean\nKay asked him in detail about my qualification, character, and\npersonality. At the end of that (about twenty minutes!) telephone\nconversation, Kay finally asked: \u2018Is he a Jew?\u2019 To this,\nLewis, the noble New Englander, gave the \u2013 to me unforgettable\n\u2013 reply: \u2018I am sure I don\u2019t know, but if he is,\nthere is nothing disturbing about it\u2019.\u00a0(Feigl 1981, p.\n74)\n\nFrom 1931 to 1937 Feigl taught as a lecturer and assistant professor\nat the University of Iowa. In 1937, he was granted US citizenship.\nFrom 1938 to 1940 he served as an associate professor at the\nUniversity of Iowa. Eventually, in 1940, Feigl received a full\nprofessorship at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. There he\nfounded in 1953 the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science\nwhich was the first center of that kind in the United States and which\nis still one of the leading institutions for research in the history\nand philosophy of science (further details in Neuber 2018a).\n\nApart from guest professorships in Berkeley (1946 and 1953), at\nColumbia University (1950) and at the University of Hawai\u2019i\n(1958), Feigl had research stays in Mexico, Australia, and Austria. He\nwas president of the American Philosophical Association and vice\npresident of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nAmong the major works during his time in the United States are\nwritings on methodology, on the scientific realism debate and a couple\nof contributions to the mind-body problem, the most well-known of\nwhich is the essay \u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the\n\u2018Physical\u2019\u201d (1958). After his retirement in 1971,\nFeigl was still active as an organizer of philosophical discussions at\nhis private home. He died of cancer on June 1, 1988, in\nMinneapolis.\n",
