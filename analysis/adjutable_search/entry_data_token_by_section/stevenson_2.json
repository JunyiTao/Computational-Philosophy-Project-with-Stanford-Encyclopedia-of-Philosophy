A moral problem is\ninterpersonal when there is disagreement among two or more people and\npersonal when an individual is uncertain about a moral issue. But what\nis the nature of this disagreement or uncertainty? These are\nthe questions around which Stevenson organizes all of his work in\nmetaethics and with which he begins both Ethics and Language\n(1944) and Facts and Values (1963a).\n\nInterpersonal disagreement is of two broad kinds: disagreement in\nbelief and disagreement in attitude. Very roughly, the\nidea is to distinguish between disagreement that involves opposed or\nincompatible beliefs and disagreement that involves opposed or\nincompatible attitudes: \u201cthe former is concerned with how\nmatters are truthfully to be described and explained; the latter is\nconcerned with how they are to be favored or disfavored, and hence\nwith how they are to be shaped by human efforts\u201d (1944, 4).\nStevenson\u2019s discussion of disagreement in attitude has been highly\ninfluential as a starting point for attempts to find an account of\ndisagreement that would suit non-cognitivist, expressivist, or\ncontextualist views in metaethics (see, e.g., Blackburn 1998, 69;\nGibbard 2003, 65\u201371; Dreier 2009; Ridge 2013; Toppinen 2013,\n272\u2013280; Finlay 2017).\n\nDisagreement in belief occurs when two people have beliefs that cannot\nboth be true and \u201cneither is content to let the belief of the\nother remain unchallenged\u201d (1948b, 1). If Smith believes that\ntheir and Jones\u2019s anniversary is in June, while Jones believes their\nanniversary is in July, their respective beliefs are incompatible,\nsince they cannot both be true; but Smith and Jones only disagree in\nthe sense that Stevenson mostly focuses on when they desire, need, or\nattempt to coordinate their beliefs, perhaps because they\nwould like to celebrate their anniversary as close to their wedding\ndate as possible. Their disagreement is resolved when they modify\ntheir beliefs in ways that make them compatible, or when both cease to\ncare about coordinating their incompatible beliefs.\n\nAnalogously, disagreement in attitude occurs when two or more people\nhave attitudes\u2014e.g., desires, plans, or intentions, or other\nstates whose general nature is that of being for or being\nagainst something (1948b, 2)\u2014that cannot all be jointly\nsatisfied (had, felt, etc.) and there is a desire, need, or attempt to\ncoordinate those attitudes. Importantly, disagreement in\nattitude is to be distinguished from disagreement about\nattitudes, which is a kind of disagreement in belief (1948b, 3;\nsee also 1944, 9\u201310). If Smith and Jones desire to dine\ntogether, but Smith desires to dine at a restaurant where there is\nmusic, while Jones desires to dine at a quiet restaurant, they\ndisagree, in a quite ordinary sense of the term, about where to dine\n(1944, 3). This kind of disagreement, as Stevenson notes,\n\u201csprings more from divergent preferences than from divergent\nbeliefs, and will end when they both wish to go the same place\u201d\n(1944, 3). For Stevenson, disagreement in attitude is a very common\nphenomenon:\n\n\nFurther examples are easily found. Mrs. A has social aspirations, and\nwants to move with the elite. Mr. A is easy-going, and loyal to his\nold friends. They accordingly disagree about what guests they will\ninvite to their party. The curator of the museum wants to buy pictures\nby contemporary artists; some of his advisors prefer the purchase of\nold masters. They disagree. John\u2019s mother is concerned about the\ndangers of playing football, and doesn\u2019t want him to play. John, even\nthough he agrees (in belief) about the dangers, wants to play anyhow.\nAgain, they disagree. (1944, 3)\n\n\nAgreement, Stevenson notes, may be dealt with \u201cmainly by\nimplication\u201d (1944, 2\u20135). The accounts of disagreement and\nagreement differ in that while two persons only disagree when they\nhave opposing beliefs or attitudes and when, moreover, at\nleast one party to the dispute \u201chas a motive for altering or\ncalling into question\u201d the belief or the attitude of the other,\ntheir agreement seems to be secured, on Stevenson\u2019s view, simply in\nvirtue of their having converging beliefs or attitudes (1944,\n4\u20135). People may \u201cneither agree nor disagree\u2014as will\nhappen when they are in a state of mutual indecision or\nirresolution,\u201d or when they simply differ,\n\u201chaving divergent beliefs or attitudes without a sufficient\nmotive for making them alike\u201d (1944, 4\u20135)\n\nRidge (2013, 41\u201345) contrasts Stevenson\u2019s account of\ndisagreement with what he calls a Stevensonian view. The\nformer demands that in order for two persons to disagree at least one\nmust be motivated to coordinate the relevant beliefs or attitudes,\nwhereas the latter only demands that the two persons have, roughly,\nbeliefs that cannot be jointly true or attitudes that cannot be\njointly satisfied. The former account of disagreement may seem\nimplausible. It seems that two persons may disagree, both in belief\nand in attitude, without even being aware of the existence of each\nother (Ridge 2013, 45\u201349). The latter option, the Stevensonian\nview\u2014which has been the more influential one in later\ndiscussions of the idea of a disagreement in attitude\u2014avoids\nthis problem (Ridge 2013, 41\u201343). However, Stevenson\u2019s view\nplausibly was the Stevensonian one. We may distinguish between\ndisagreement as a kind of activity\u2014having a\ndisagreement\u2014and disagreement as a state (Cappelen\n& Hawthorne 2009, 60\u201361). While two people who are not aware\nof the existence of each other may be in a state of disagreement, they\nwon\u2019t be engaged in having a disagreement. Plausibly, Stevenson is\noperating with a distinction along these lines, and simply wishes to\nfocus on disagreement in the sense of a kind of activity. This is\nunderstandable, given his focus on moral problems and on the\nways of dealing with such problems. So, when Stevenson contrasts\nmerely differing with having a disagreement (1944,\n4\u20135 and 111) the contrast is plausibly meant to capture the\ncontrast between merely being in a state of disagreement and having a\ndisagreement. He writes, for instance:\n\n\nThere are times, of course, when people differ in their attitudes\nwithout having a sufficient motive for resolving the difference. They\nmay feel that the difference will lead to no clash; they may be too\ntimid, too aloof, or too economical of their time to make an issue of\nthe matter; they may consider certain men too fixed in their ways to\nbe changed, and others capable of leading their own lives. (Stevenson\n1944, 111)\n\n\nClearly, in these sorts of cases, Stevenson sees the relevant people\nas disagreeing in an important sense, despite the fact that they see\nno point in engaging or in arguing with each other. Indeed,\nhe then goes on to point out that in certain kind of circumstances\n(e.g., when concerted social action is needed) the motives for\narguing in a way that \u201cmay change disagreement in\nattitude to agreement\u201d become manifold\u2014thus implicitly\napplying the notion of a disagreement in attitude also to a mere\nconflict of attitudes (1944, 112).\n\nStevenson does not assume that interpersonal disagreement always\nsignals that one is intending to get another to change their beliefs\nor attitudes, to win the argument as it were. It may, and often is,\nthe case that one is open to having their own beliefs or attitudes\nchanged in the course of open-minded discussion or deliberation. Thus\nneither disagreement in belief nor disagreement in attitude need be an\n\u201coccasion for forensic rivalry; it may be an occasion for an\ninterchange of aims, with a reciprocal influence that both parties\nfind to be beneficial\u201d (1944, 4\u20135).\n\nUncertainty in attitude occurs when an individual is\nuncertain about how to feel or about what to do. For example, Smith\nmay have conflicting attitudes about some particular legislation\nproposal (being in disagreement with themselves, so to speak).\nAlternatively, they may, while currently having no attitudes regarding\nthe proposal, wish to determine whether to be for or against it, so\nthat they can vote responsibly (1963b, 191\u2013199; 1950a,\n55\u201360). Stevenson doesn\u2019t say much about uncertainty in\nbelief, but it is, presumably, a matter of being disposed both to\nbelieve and to disbelieve some proposition, or of wanting to settle on\na belief regarding some issue.\n\nEspecially in Ethics and Language, Stevenson\u2019s focus is\nprimarily on interpersonal disagreement rather than on personal\nuncertainty, but this is not because he would have deemed the latter\nless important. Rather, he is supposing that personal uncertainty may\nbe usefully understood in terms of a person being in disagreement with\nthemselves (1944, 131). However, Stevenson later came to have some\nregrets over the lack of emphasis on personal deliberation and\nuncertainty, which, he thought, also contributed to a somewhat\nmisleading picture of interpersonal moral problems. In particular, he\ncame to worry that this emphasis made it easy to think of his theory\nas downplaying the difficulty of moral questions and the preparedness\nof people to revise their moral views, and contributed to the\nimpression that there would be \u201csomething more to ethics\u201d\nthan what Stevenson had been able to find (1963b, 186\u2013194).\n\nHow, then, is the crucial distinction between beliefs and attitudes to\nbe understood? Stevenson adopts a dispositional theory, according to\nwhich these states are distinguishable by their respective complex\ncausal relations (1944, 7\u20138; 1950a). (More will be said about\nStevenson\u2019s view of dispositions in\n Section 3.2.)\n While he concedes that the complexity of the relevant dispositions\nmakes them difficult to specify, he does think that beliefs and\nattitudes are easily distinguishable in our daily experience. Consider\nan onlooker who witnesses a chess expert open weakly against a novice\nand wonders:\n\n\nDoes he make the move because he believes that it is a strong\none, or because out of charity to his opponent, he doesn\u2019t\nwant to make a strong one? The distinction here between a\nbelief and a want (attitude) is certainly beyond any practical\nobjection. One can imagine the expert, with constant beliefs about the\nopening, using it or not in accordance with his changing desires to\nwin; or one can imagine him, with constant desires to win, using it or\nnot in accordance with his changing beliefs.
