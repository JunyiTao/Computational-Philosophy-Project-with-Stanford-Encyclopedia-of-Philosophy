    "main_text": "Intellect\n10. Intellect\n\n\nSo intellect in its similitude to divine creation possesses an\nemanative activity. But in its unlikeness to God and its dependence\nupon him it is a confined or restricted emanation. Dietrich calls this\nemanatio simplex and he claims that it constitutes an analogy\nto the creative emanation of God. Intellect is obviously a crucial\naspect of Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics. It would be well then to say\nsomething about his view of intellect in general before turning\nspecifically to an analysis of his De intellectu.\n\n\nIn the realm of intellects, Dietrich tells us, we discover a fourfold\norder in which intellectual reality stands: at the top of this order\nis found what Dietrich calls intellects existing through their\nessence, followed by intelligent spiritual substances that are called\nangels, and then species and finally the individual realities included\nin species that are known to mind. There are three kinds of intellects\nthat exist through their essence: the separated intelligences,\ncelestial bodies, and human intellects.\n\n\nIntellects possess unique attributes according to Dietrich. We have\nalready remarked on one of these: their likeness to God and to the\nuniverse of beings\u2014a property shared by no other creatures. We have\nseen that intellect is like God in that it is what we have called\nsemi-creative or conceptional. In what way, however, can intellect be\nthe likeness of the universe of beings, and to such a degree that it\nbecomes identified with it so that we can say that the intellect is\nthe universe of beings in the order of ens conceptionale? One\ncould answer of course by saying that the intellect is this likeness\nby its very act of knowing the universe of beings. But there is a\ndifficulty here\u2014one that Dietrich is well aware of from studying\nAristotle. For the question how the intellect knows the universe of\nbeings is like the question how the eye can see colors. If the eye\nwere any one particular color, then it would see only that\ncolor. Aristotle, who raises this question, replies that the eye must\nbe colorless so it can see every color. Likewise for the mind or\nintellect. Thus it is wrong to say that the intellect is the likeness\nof the universe of beings by its very act of knowing the universe of\nbeings because the very reverse is true. The intellect is no one of\nthe beings it knows.  It is truly the universe of beings, but in the\nconceptional order. Thus it can be like the universe of beings in the\nso-called real order. Its nature then must be general and\nuniversal. Noting its object provides evidence for this:\n\n\nThe intellect is a general and universal nature in accord with the\nproperty of its intellectual essence, which is not determined to\nunderstand only this or that thing. This is clear from its object,\nwhich is not this or that quiddity, but universally any quiddity and\nbeing as being, that is, whatever possesses the character of\nbeing.\n\n\n\n\nOne should notice that Dietrich does not raise a question which may\nappear obvious: if the intellect is not identified with any one being,\nis it proper to call it a being at all? Nor does he formally consider\nthe hypothesis that Meister Eckhart advanced in his Quaestiones\nparisienses, namely that intellect might belong to a different\norder than being. But, of course, this is just where the answer lies.\nThe intellect belongs to a different order of reality than being. In\neffect, Dietrich\u2019s categories of ens reale and ens\nconceptionale imply as much. In fact, the way Dietrich uses the\nnotion of ens conceptionale as a superior mode of reality is\nexactly the position Eckhart takes.\n",
