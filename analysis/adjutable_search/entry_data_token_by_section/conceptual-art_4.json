In conceptual art, the representation at work can generally be\nseen as semantic rather than illustrative. That is\nto say, it sets out to have and convey a specific meaning rather than\nto depict a scene, person or event. Even in cases where a work makes\nuse of illustrative representation, conceptual art is still putting\nthat representation to a distinctively semantic use, in the sense of\nthere being an intention to represent something one cannot see with\nthe naked eye. Accordingly, the conceptual artist\u2019s task is to\ncontemplate and formulate this meaning \u2013 to be a\n\u2018meaning-maker\u2019.\n",
