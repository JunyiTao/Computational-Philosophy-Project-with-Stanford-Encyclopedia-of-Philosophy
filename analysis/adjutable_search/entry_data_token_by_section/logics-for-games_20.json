    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Backward Induction in Extensive Form Games\n3.3 Backward Induction in Extensive Form Games\n\nHere is a high-level description of Backward Induction. In extensive\ngame forms, the aim is to introduce a new preference-based relation\n\\(\\best_i\\), denoting that some move is the best a player can do at\nsome given state. Thus, \\(\\best_i\\) is a subset of player\ni\u2019s total move relation, to be defined in a suitable\nmanner.\n\nFor final moves, standard decision theory suggests that a choice is\nbest for the active player if no other move leads to a better outcome.\nWhen extending the analysis to earlier positions of the game, things\ndepend crucially on players\u2019 expectations about their\nopponents\u2019 future behavior. Several possible policies exist,\ndepending on the types of player involved. A widespread assumption in\nepistemic game theory is common belief in rationality, i.e., that all\nplayers involved are rational, believe their opponents to be rational,\nbelieve their opponents to believe that opponents are rational, and so\non. In line with this assumption, the following algorithm extends the\n\\(\\best_i\\) relation recursively to non-terminal nodes:\n\n\nWhenever player i is to move at state s, possible\nchoices are assessed by comparing what would happen if, after that\nmove, everybody followed their \\(\\best\\) relation. A possible move at\ns is included in i\u2019s \\(\\best\\) relation if the\nbest outcome of this move followed by repeated \\(\\best\\) moves by all\nplayers is at least as good as every other move i could make at\ns, followed by \\(\\best\\) moves by all players.\n\n\nHere is how this bottom-up procedure works in practice.\n\nExample Backward Induction.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nThis procedure is a qualitative version of classic game theory\u2019s\nBackward Induction, which is based on utility values rather than\npreference relations (Leyton-Brown & Shoham\n2008).\n\nBackward Induction and the resulting \\(\\best\\) relation is a prime\nexample for the complex entanglement of preferences, information and\naction. A key modal axiom governing this relation was identified by\nvan Benthem, van Otterloo, and Roy\n(2006). \\(\\best^*\\) denotes here the transitive closure of the\nunion of all \\(\\best_i\\) relations. \n\\[\n(\\turn_i\\land\\langle \\best\\rangle[ \\best^*](\\operatorname{end}\\rightarrow p))\\rightarrow[\\move_i]\\langle  \\best^*\\rangle(\\operatorname{end}\\land\\langle \\preceq_i\\rangle p)\n\\]\n\n\nDescribing the limit of a dynamic process with a static property, this\nequivalence exemplifies a family of characterization theorems\nthat play a crucial role within the logical analysis of games. Other\ndynamic perspectives can be analyzed in a similar logical style (Liu\n2011).\n\n\n",
