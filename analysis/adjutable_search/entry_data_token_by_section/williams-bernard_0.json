    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nBernard Williams was born in Essex in 1929, and educated at Chigwell\nSchool and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Greats, the uniquely\nOxonian degree that begins with Homer and Vergil and concludes with\nThucydides, Tacitus, and (surprisingly perhaps) the latest in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both Williams\u2019 subject of study and his\ntutors, especially Richard Hare, remained as influences throughout his\nlife: the Greeks\u2019 sort of approach to philosophy never ceased to\nattract him, Hare\u2019s sort of approach never ceased to have the\nopposite effect. (Williams\u2019 contemporaries at Balliol, John\nLucas for example, still report their mischievous use of\n\u201ccombined tactics\u201d in philosophy tutorials with Hare; or\nperhaps the relevant preposition is \u201cagainst\u201d.)\n\nEarly in his career, Williams sat on a number of British government\ncommittees and commissions, most famously chairing the Committee on\nObscenity and Censorship of 1979, which applied Mill\u2019s\n\u201charm principle\u201d to the topic, concluding that\nrestrictions were out of place where no harm could reasonably be\nthought to be done, and that by and large society has other problems\nwhich are more worth worrying about. At this time, he also began to\npublish books. His first book, Morality: an introduction to\nethics (1972), already announced many of the themes that were to\nbe central to his work. Already evident, in particular, were his\nquestioning attitude to the whole enterprise of moral theory, his\ncaution about the notion of absolute truth in ethics, and his\nhostility to utilitarianism and other moral theories that seek to\nsystematise moral life and experience on the basis of such an\nabsolute; as he later put it, \u201cThere cannot be any very\ninteresting, tidy or self-contained theory of what morality is\u2026\nnor\u2026 can there be an ethical theory, in the sense of a\nphilosophical structure which, together with some degree of empirical\nfact, will yield a decision procedure for moral reasoning\u201d\n(1981: ix-x). His second book, Problems of the Self (= PS;\n1973), was a collection of his philosophical papers from 1956 to 1972;\nhis further collections of essays (Moral Luck, 1981, and\nMaking Sense of Humanity, 1998) were as much landmarks in the\nliterature as this first collection. (Posthumously three further\ncollections appeared: In the Beginning was the Deed (ed.\nGeoffrey Hawthorn), 2005, A Sense of the Past, 2005, and\nPhilosophy as a Humanistic Discipline (2006); at least the\nsecond and third of these three collections are already having a\nconsiderable impact on philosophy, partly because they include essays\nthat were already well-known and widely discussed in their original\nplaces of appearance.) In 1973 Williams also brought out a co-authored\nvolume, Utilitarianism: For and Against, with J.J.C.Smart (=\nUFA); his contribution to this (the Against bit) being, in\nthe present writer\u2019s view, a tour de force of\nphilosophical demolition. Then in 1978 Williams produced\nDescartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry. This study could be\ndescribed as his most substantial work outside ethics, but for the\nfact that the key theme of the book is the impossibility of\nDescartes\u2019 ambition to give a foundation, in the first-personal\nperspective, to the \u201cabsolute conception\u201d of the world, a\nrepresentation of the world \u201cas it is anyway\u201d that\nincludes, explains, and rationally interrelates all other possible\nrepresentations of the world (Williams 1968: 65)\u2014a theme that is\nin an important sense not outside ethics at all.\n\n\nWilliams worked in Britain until 1987, when he left \n\nfor Berkeley in protest at the impact of the Thatcher\ngovernment\u2019s policies on British universities. In 1985, he\npublished the book that offers the most unified and sustained\npresentation of what Williams had to say about ethics and human life:\nEthics and the Limits of Philosophy. On his return to Britain\nin 1990 (incidentally the year of Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s resignation)\nhe succeeded his old tutor Richard Hare as White\u2019s Professor of\nMoral Philosophy at Oxford. While in the Oxford chair he produced\nShame and Necessity (1993), a major study of Greek ethics\nwhich aims to distinguish what we think about ethics \u201cfrom what\nwe think that we think\u201d (1993: 91): Williams\u2019 thesis is\nthat our deepest convictions are often more like classical Greek\nethical thought, and less like the post-Enlightenment \u201cmorality\nsystem\u201d, as Williams came to call it, than most of us have yet\nrealised. (More about the morality system in sections 2 and 3.)\n\nIn 1999 he published an introductory book on Plato\n(Routledge). After 1999\u2014when he was knighted\u2014he began to\nbe affected by the cancer which eventually killed him, but was still\nable to bring out Truth and Truthfulness in 2002. In this\nWilliams argues, against such deniers of the possibility or importance\nof objective truth as the pragmatist Richard Rorty and the\ndeconstructionist Jacques Derrida, that it is indispensable to any\nhuman society to accept both truth and truthfulness as values, and\nsincerity and accuracy as corresponding virtues. Nor need such beliefs\nimply anything disreputably \u201cmetaphysical\u201d, in the\nNietzschean sense that they lead us into a covert worship of what\nWilliams takes to be the will o\u2019 the wisps of theism or\nPlatonism. On the contrary, Williams argues, Nietzsche is on his side,\nnot the deniers\u2019, because Nietzsche himself believes that, while\na vindicatory history of the notions of truth and truthfulness\ncertainly has to be a naturalistic one, that is not to say that such a\nhistory is impossible. We can write this history if we can supply a\n\u201cpotential explanation\u201d, to use Robert Nozick\u2019s term\n(Nozick 1974: 7\u20139), of how these notions could have arisen.\nWilliams himself attempts to provide such a potential explanation,\nwhich if plausible will\u2014given the impossibility of recovering\nthe actual history\u2014provide us with as much insight as we can\nreasonably hope for into how the notions of truth and truthfulness did\nin fact arise. Such an understanding of truth and truthfulness,\nWilliams concludes, cannot lead us back into the pre-modern\nphilosophical Edens where truth and truthfulness are taken to have\ntheir origin in something entirely transcendent, such as Plato\u2019s\nForms, or God, or the cognitive powers of the Kantian subject; but it\ncan lead us to the less elevated and more realistic hope that truth,\nas a human institution, will continue to sustain the virtues of truth\n\u201cin something like the more courageous, intransigent, and\nsocially effective forms that they have acquired over their\nhistory\u2026 and that the ways in which future people will come to\nmake sense of things will enable them to see the truth and not be\nbroken by it\u201d (2002: 269). However, it should be noted that\nWilliams, perhaps confusingly, claims to have vindicated the idea that\ntruthfulness is an intrinsic value, \nwhile at the same time admitting that his genealogical explanation for\nthe emergence of truthfulness only makes reference to what\ntruthfulness effects or accomplishes. Difficult questions remain about\nhis use of the Platonic category of \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 here\n(see Rorty 2002, Queloz 2018).\n\nSome of Williams\u2019 critics have complained that his work is\nlargely \u201cdestructive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d. Part of\nWilliams\u2019 reply is that his nuanced and particularistic approach\nto ethics\u2014via the detail of ethical questions\u2014is\nnegative only from the point of view of those operating under a\ncompletely undefended assumption. This is the assumption that, if\nthere is to be serious ethical thought, then it must inevitably take\nthe form of moral theory. The impression that any other approach could\nnot be more than \u201cnegative\u201d is itself part of the mindset\nthat he is attacking.\n\nWilliams often also meets the charge of negativity with a\ncounter-offensive, which can be summarised as the retort that\nthere\u2019s plenty to be negative about (1995: 217). \u201cOften,\nsome theory has been under criticism, and the more particular material\n[e.g. Williams\u2019 famous examples (UFA: 93\u2013100) of George\nand Jim: see section 4 below] has come in to remind one of the\nunreality and, worse, distorting quality of the theory. The\nmaterial\u2026 is itself extremely schematic, but\u2026 it at\nleast brings out the basic point that\u2026 the theory is frivolous,\nin not allowing for anyone\u2019s experience, including the\nauthor\u2019s own. Alternatively, the theory does represent\nexperience, but an impoverished experience, which it holds up as the\nrational norm\u2014that is to say, the theory is stupid.\u201d\n\nBut Williams did publish positive and constructive philosophy, most\nnotably in Truth and Truthfulness itself. Moreover, this\nconception of Williams as a negative thinker is contestible. Miranda\nFricker argues that Williams work represents an affirmation of what\nshe calls \u201cethical freedom\u201d, which follows from the\nrecognition that rationality itself significantly underdetermines how\nwe should live (Fricker 2020). If the Platonic dream is that objective\nreason can always give us sufficient practical guidance, then Williams\nnegative position is that this ambitious form of rationalism must\nfail. The correlative positive idea is that each agent has a certain\nkind of subjective freedom to shape their own conceptions of\nsuccessful action and of the good life, conceptions which are not\nsubject to censure or approval by some kind of universal rationality.\nIt is important to notice that this only appears to be a negative\nthesis because we are assuming that a positive contribution to moral\nphilosophy consists in establishing universal limits or boundaries on\njustified action. But from the perspective of the deciding agent,\nWilliams\u2019 thesis is anything but negative; rather, it is\npositively liberating, freeing agents to shape their own projects in\naccordance with their own character.\n\nSince one of Williams\u2019 main objectives is to demonstrate the\nfrivolity and/ or stupidity of too much contemporary moral theory, it\nis natural to structure our more detailed examination of his\ncontributions to philosophy by beginning with its critical side. The\nfirst two of the three themes from Williams that we pick for closer\nattention are both campaigns of argument against positions:\nrespectively, against the \u201cmorality system\u201d (sections 2\nand 3), and against utilitarianism (section 4). The aptness of this\narrangement comes out in the fact that, as we shall see, most of the\nconstructive positions that Williams adopts can be seen as the\n\u201cmorals\u201d of these essentially destructive stories. Even\nwhat we take to be Williams\u2019 single most important positive\nthesis, a view about the nature of motivation and reasons for action,\nemerges from his critique of other people\u2019s views about reasons\nfor action; more about that, his famous \u201cinternal reasons\u201d\nargument, in section 5.\n",
