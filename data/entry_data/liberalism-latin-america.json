    "preamble": "\n\nLiberal political discourse was dominant in Latin America during most\nof the nineteenth century. Initially, in the first half of the\ncentury, it was a discourse of liberation from colonial rule in\nHispanic America. Liberal ideas provided the political language to\narticulate the urgently needed new kind of legitimacy for the emerging\nrepublics. Later, in the second half, liberalism was firmly\nestablished as an ideology of nation building in most of the region.\nHowever, by the mid twentieth century, liberalism had mostly vanished\nfrom the political scene, except in Colombia where the liberal party\ncontinued to be a live political option until the end of the century.\nDespite the fact that it became the dominant political discourse in\nthe nineteenth century, there is no such thing as Latin American or\nHispanic American \u201cliberalism\u201d, if by the latter we mean\nsomething like a unified and internally coherent body of political\ndoctrine (\u201cHispanic American\u201d refers to Spanish-speaking\nAmerica as opposed to Portuguese speaking, i.e., Brazil). Instead,\nwhat emerged in the nineteenth century were various political\nmovements that can appropriately be called \u201cliberal\u201d to\nthe extent that political actors either espoused liberal ideas or\nidentified themselves as \u201cliberals\u201d, or both. Though such\npolitical movements began to take shape in the aftermath of the wars\nof independence from Spain and Portugal, self-identification as a\nmember of a liberal group became possible around the mid-century when\nthe liberal position became more definite in relation to usually\n\u201cconservative\u201d adversaries.\n\nA central feature of Hispanic American liberalism (the case of Brazil\nis considered below) is that its multiple variants developed directly\nin response to the political challenges posed by the need to construct\nnew states after the disintegration of the Spanish empire. Liberal\npolitical actors were primarily concerned with addressing\ninstitutional issues and also with pressing for specific political\nends but not with systematic theorizing. Liberal intellectuals were\npublic figures who usually held official positions and were mainly\nconcerned with the practical tasks of constitutional design and\ninstitutional reform. Thus, the various liberal positions principally\nemerged in political and legal practice, not in theoretical works.\nLiberal intellectuals expressed and developed their views in the\nnumerous constitutions that they produced, in legal commentary, and in\nthe public debates that took place in pamphlets and newspapers. For\nthis reason, it is crucial to understand the political challenges that\nthey were forced to confront in the design of the new institutional\nstructures. The various liberal positions that they developed can only\nbe fully grasped as responses to the questions and problems that the\nsocial and political situations forced upon them. This is not to deny\nthat some liberal Latin American intellectuals did produce theoretical\nworks that are worth examining in their own right, such as those by\nJuan Bautista Alberdi in Argentina and Jos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria\nin Chile.\n\nDespite important differences in the social and political conditions\nacross the region, liberal Hispanic American intellectuals shared some\ncommon themes and concerns. Chief among them was their commitment to\ncarry out a radical break with the past that required the profound\ntransformation of their own societies. Central to this enterprise was\nthe replacement of the religiously grounded monarchical form of\ngovernment with secular republics based on popular sovereignty. In\nlight of this commitment, liberal political actors debated how best to\ncarry out this transformation in political structures and social\npractices: whether constitutional design could be sufficient to\nproduce the desired republican order (i.e., non-monarchical) with full\nprotection of individual liberties and a market economy; or whether it\nwas also necessary to engage in social and economic reform with the\npower of a strong centralized State that was still in the making. They\nasked what was to be done with inherited colonial institutions that\nfiercely resisted the new liberal order (especially the Catholic\nChurch); and how to transform ex-colonial subjects with little if any\nexperience in political representation and participation in a market\neconomy into industrious citizens of the republic. A central\nconcern was how to maintain social and political stability in the\nprocess of a deep transformation premised on the rejection of long\nestablished colonial institutional structures and social practices.\nNot surprisingly, liberal political actors disagreed deeply among\nthemselves about how best to answer questions such as these and what\nexactly liberalism entailed. They disagreed on matters of\nconstitutional design, the extent of individual liberties, the proper\nfunctions of the State, who was entitled to full active citizenship,\nhow to deal with the Catholic Church, among other issues. For all\ntheir disagreements, they took for granted that the\n\u201cIndians\u201d and mestizos, who were in the majority, had to\nbe transformed into industrious citizens, by force if\nnecessary.\n\nWhile the reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American\nliberalism has been dominated by historians, it is also of\nphilosophical interest for at least two reasons. First, the most\nprominent liberal intellectuals, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi in\nArgentina, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora in Mexico, and\nJos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria in Chile, did develop distinctive\nliberal positions. As already mentioned, Alberdi and Lastarria also\nproduced theoretical works in which they systematized their own\npolitical views. Second, the consideration of nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberalism can contribute to enrich our understanding of\nliberalism as a far more internally heterogeneous ideology than is\nusually assumed since what was meant by \u201cliberalism\u201d turns\nout to be sometimes surprising from contemporary perspectives. For\nnineteenth century Latin American liberals the liberal State could be\nthe main agent promoting economic growth, the principal provider of\nformal schooling, and the champion of political and social\nsecularization in constant confrontation with the Catholic Church.\n\nDespite their lofty ambitions, the struggles of political actors to\ntransform Latin American societies in light of liberal ideas and\nvalues have almost unanimously been met with a harsh judgement. Since\nearly on in the nineteenth century, there emerged the concern that\nliberal ideas were \u201cimported\u201d and inadequate for Latin\nAmerican societies (Bol\u00edvar 1815). Later, in the early\ntwentieth, the discourse that liberalism had been a failure in the\nregion enjoyed ample support given the oligarchical nature of the\nliberal regimes, the establishment of authoritarian\n\u201cliberal\u201d governments, and the inability of the liberal\nestablishments to properly channel social demands for political\nparticipation and the inclusion of the large impoverished majorities\nin the benefits of economic growth. Since then, scholars have debated\non the alleged inadequacy of Latin American societies for liberal\ninstitutions, the ways in which the \u201cadaptation\u201d of\nliberalism in Latin American allegedly \u201cdeviated\u201d from the\n\u201coriginal\u201d European and North American liberal\n\u201cmodels\u201d, and the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of the\nlatter.\n\nHowever, in recent decades there has taken place a renewed scholarly\ninterest in nineteenth century Latin American liberalism and local\npolitical history more broadly. Novel theoretical approaches have\ncalled into question well-established assumptions. Some authors have\nshifted attention from diagnosing the failures of liberalism in the\nregion to offering more sympathetic and accurate reconstructions (Hale\n1968 & 1989, J\u00e1ksic and Posada Carb\u00f3 2011). This\ndevelopment has opened a number of conceptual debates in an evolving\nfield. Scholars now disagree as to what is to count as\n\u201cliberalism\u201d in carrying out this reconstruction. While\nsome maintain that such a reconstruction necessarily presupposes a\nprior theoretical \u201cdefinition\u201d of liberalism in order to\nproperly identify its subject matter (Aguilar 2000 & 2010,\nGargarella 2010 & 2013), others reject all attempts at definition\naltogether (Palti 2005 & 2007). The question then arises whether\nany position that political actors called \u201cliberal\u201d is to\ncount as such for scholarly purposes. For instance, Is the fusion of\nlate nineteenth century liberalism with Comtean positivism that took\nplace in some regions to be considered a genuine liberal development?\nOr should it be considered the demise of liberalism despite the fact\nthat some of those who embraced positivism continued to call\nthemselves \u201cliberals\u201d? What should be the subject matter\nin this reconstruction: the uses of the term \u201cliberal\u201d\n(Rivera-Castro 2021), the concept of \u201cliberalism\u201d\nregardless of the terminology that political actors and movements in\nfact employed (Fern\u00e1ndez Sebasti\u00e1n 2009 & 2012), or\nthe political languages in which they articulated their own views\n(Palti 2005 & 2007)? These debates have brought to the fore that\nthe reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American liberalism\nposes conceptual and methodologiacl questions regarding what we are to\nunderstand by \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cliberalism\u201d both\nat the early stage around the time of independence and at the time of\nthe liberll triumph in the closing decades of the century. The\nquestion even arises whether the attribution of a liberal ideology to\npolitical actors at the early stage before the formation of political\ngroups that self-identified as \u201cliberal\u201d is appropriate or\nonly a retrospective reconstruction.\n\nIn light of the variety and complexity of Latin American liberal\nviews, this entry provides only a brief and general introduction to\nthe topic that is far from being the whole story. Since the heyday of\nLatin American liberalism took place in the nineteenth century, this\nentry privileges this historical period, though the last section\nfocuses on the decline of liberalism in the twentieth century, its\nmodest revival in recent decades, and current scholarly debates on how\nbest to carry out its reconstruction. In order to adequately present\nthe liberal political movements, it has been indispensable to provide\nthe highlights of the social and political context that motivated the\ninitial enthusiastic appropriation of liberal ideas as well as their\nfurther development. This entry also provides closer though brief\napproximations to the views developed by the most prominent liberal\nintellectuals mentioned earlier, namely, Alberdi, Mora, and Lastarria.\nSince they articulated their positions in quite different political\ncontexts, their respective liberal views differ greatly from each\nother. Though the entry is organized thematically, it also roughly\nfollows a chronological order. The first section offers a brief\noverview. The second section presents the influence of Spanish\nliberalism in the initial reception of liberal ideas around the time\nof the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. The third\nsection presents early Hispanic American liberalism as an emancipatory\nideology that commanded wide acceptance among the elites. The fourth\nsection considers the transition from the initial constitutional\noptimism to the search for alternative ways for bringing about the\nmuch desired social and political change. The fifth section focuses on\nthe ideological conflict between liberals and conservatives around the\nmid-nineteenth century. It was in the midst of this conflict that the\ncontours of a liberal political identity came more clearly into view.\nThe sixth section presents the liberal anticlerical response to the\nreligious problem. The seventh section considers the influence of\npositivism and the triumph of liberalism as an ideology of nation\nbuilding. The final eighth section briefly considers the decline of\nliberalism in the early decades of the twentieth century, the debates\non the alleged failure of liberalism in Latin America, and the related\ndiscussions regarding the adequate conceptual framework for carrying\nout its reconstruction.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. An Overview\n\nLiberal ideas first became widespread in Latin American with the\ninfluence of the liberal C\u00e1diz constitution of 1812 which\nwas in force in the Spanish empire for two years until the\nreestablishment of absolute rule. At the beginning of the century,\n\u201cliberalism\u201d in this context primarily meant what Spanish\nliberals meant by it in the debates that took place in the\nC\u00e1diz Courts, which met as a sovereign national assembly in\nresponse to the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808.\nIt was in this setting that the term \u201cliberal\u201d was for the\nfirst time employed in a political sense to refer to a political group\n(Bre\u00f1a 2012). Since the C\u00e1diz constitution was, in turn,\nheavily influenced by the political ideas of the French Revolution,\nthe first liberal ideas in Latin America had likewise primarily this\norigin. Ideas such as popular sovereignty, civil equality, individual\nrepresentation, the conventional nature of political authority,\nfreedom of thought and of the press, and a division of powers that\nprivileges the legislative became central to early Latin American\nliberalism. The latter was by no means identical to Spanish liberalism\nor to the political ideas of the French revolution, but these two are\nits main initial sources.\n\nThe crisis of the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies upon the\nNapoleonic invasion set off the process of independence in most of\nLatin America and opened the way for the free circulation, for the\nfirst time, of modern political ideas in the region (the Spanish and\nPortuguese inquisitions had prohibited freedom of thought and of the\npress). Though the C\u00e1diz constitution was influential in both\nHispanic (i.e., Spanish-speaking) and Portuguese Americas, liberalism\ndeveloped in quite different directions in these two regions because\nof the two quite different ways in which the Spanish and Portuguese\nmonarchies responded to the French invasion. While the flight of the\nSpanish king tossed the empire into a political crisis, the Portuguese\nwere able to maintain political stability by transferring the capital\nof the empire to Brazil. Thus, questions about the source of\nlegitimate political authority became pressing in Hispanic America,\nbut were not as critical in Brazil. Although the initial answers that\nHispanic Americans offered were framed in terms of traditional\nscholastic political thinking, they soon began to appeal to the\npolitical ideas of the French revolution, specifically to the notion\nof popular sovereignty. According to the scholastic traditional view,\nsovereign authority rested on a pact between the king and its people,\nand in the absence of the king, sovereignty returned to the people. On\nthis traditional view, the sovereign authority of the king was limited\nby natural, divine, and teleological (i.e., common good)\nconsiderations. The transition to the modern conception of unlimited\nand indivisible popular sovereignty marked a radical break in the\npolitical thinking in the Spanish colonies. Similarly new and\nrevolutionary was the related conception of individual representation\nin a constituent assembly, as opposed to the traditional corporate\nrepresentation before the king, to which the American subjects were\nnever entitled.\n\nThe end result of this political process was the independence of all\nHispanic America (with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico) within\ntwo decades of the Napoleonic invasion through armed revolt. Brazil,\nby contrast, obtained independence in the same period without\nbloodshed when the Portuguese prince-regent proclaimed it. This\ndifference in the sequence of political events accounts for the fact\nthat the liberal ideology in Hispanic America was deeply committed to\ncarrying out a radical break with the colonial past while a salient\nfeature of Brazilian liberalism is the continuity of monarchical rule.\nWhile liberals in Hispanic American uniformly rejected monarchism and\nembraced a republican form of government (i.e., non-monarchical)\ngrounded on popular sovereignty, Brazilian liberalism remained\nmonarchical until the closing decades of the century. The\negalitarianism implicit in republicanism favored the abolition of\nslavery and of noble titles in the new republics. By mid-century\nslavery had been formally abolished in all of them, though practices\nof slave/serf-like labor continued in some regions, such as\nMexico. In Brazil, slavery was finally abolished in 1888 after\ndecades of contestation and gradual decline.\n\nAfter having embraced the doctrine of popular sovereignty and the\nnatural rights language of the French revolution, most liberals\nfollowed Benjamin Constant in his critique of the doctrine of popular\nsovereignty and his defense of a limited government. His writings on\nconstitutionalism were closely followed in the design of Latin\nAmerican constitutions, both liberal and conservative. Though French\nliberalism exerted the greatest influence overall, some Latin American\nliberals were also much influenced by British parliamentarism. Most of\nthem also admired the North American republican experience.\nMontesquieu and Jeremy Bentham were, along with Constant, among the\nmost cited European authors in the first half of the century (Safford\n1987: 68). From Montesquieu, liberals took the idea of separation of\npowers and his critique of despotism. Though they did not adopt an\nexplicitly utilitarian language, they admired and followed\nBentham\u2019s rationalistic approach to legislation (Jaramillo 2001:\n120). In the mid-century, the political problem that came into focus\nand that gave liberals an identity against the conservative opposition\nwas the religious one. The question was how to deal with a powerful\nChurch that, in some regions, posed the most powerful internal\nchallenge to the authority of the newly established republics, given\nthe Catholic uncompromising rejection of liberalism. The Catholic\nChurch had condemned liberalism, secularism, freedom of thought and\ntoleration, among other \u201cevils\u201d in Pope Pius IX\u2019s\nSyllabus of Errors published in 1864. Liberals demanded freedom of\nreligious worship and, in some cases, the separation of church and\nstate. At this point in time, they had for the most part distanced\nthemselves from the natural rights discourse and from contractualism\nin light of the criticisms by the British utilitarians (especially\nBentham) and French liberals (especially Constant). They turned their\nattention to the German historical school of law (Friedrich Karl von\nSavigny and his French follower Eug\u00e8ne Lerminier) and, above\nall, to Auguste Comte\u2019s positivism, which became the most\ninfluential philosophical doctrine (Hale 1984) along with Herbert\nSpencer\u2019s evolutionism. After decades of civil unrest, a\ndoctrine that emphasized the maintenance of order in combination with\nprogress appeared highly attractive. Liberalism had ceased to be an\nideology in combat against an enemy, either foreign (Spain) or\ninternal (the conservative political faction), and had become the\ntriumphant ideology of national building (Hale 1984). In the closing\ndecades of the century, positivism displaced liberalism in Brazil,\nwhile some Hispanic American liberals carried out a synthesis of\nliberal ideas and positivism that has often been considered the\ndecline of liberalism.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Latin American liberalism became the\nsubject of strong criticisms. Critics argued that Latin American\nsocieties had not been successfully transformed according to liberal\nideas because the former provided a hostile ground for the latter. On\nthis view, liberalism was a foreign ideology that was not adequate for\nHispanic American realities. This is a criticism against nineteenth\ncentury liberalism that has remained forceful to this date. By\nmid-twentieth century liberalism had been displaced by the emergence\nof alternative political movements and ideologies:\ncorporativisms of various sorts as well as socialist,\nMarxist, indigenous, agrarian, and populist. In the late twentieth and\nearly twenty-first centuries, liberalism has experienced a modest\nrevival in political discourse in Latin America. This is manifest in\nthe discourse that affirms the pluralism of forms of life and the\ndemands for protection of the rights of minorities. In the sphere of\nacademia, the works by English speaking liberal scholars, such as John\nRawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Joseph Raz, have received much attention\nand have been amply discussed in academic publications. However, Latin\nAmerican scholars have so far not related their current endorsement of\nrecent Anglo-American liberalism to the nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberal discourse. For the most part there is a sharp divide\nbetween current work by historians on nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberalism, on the one hand, and systematic reflection by\nphilosophers and political theorists on recent Anglo-American\nliberalism, on the other.\n2. The Influence of Spanish Liberalism\n\nIn response to the French invasion in 1808, Spanish liberalism\ndeveloped as an ideology of liberation against a foreign invader. This\nwas the first powerful liberal movement in the Spanish empire and the\nvery first serious questioning of absolute rule. In a society that had\nalmost no experience in political representation, liberals sought to\nend despotic rule by replacing it with a parliamentary monarchy. They\ndenied sovereign authority to the King and declared it to lie in the\nnation, which, in turn, was conceived of as having the faculty to make\nand remake its own fundamental laws. Traditionally, representation in\nthe Courts had been corporate (nobility, clergy and the\nmunicipalities), while liberals stood for individualistic\nrepresentation. Against despotism, liberals also favored a division of\npowers and an independent judiciary. Spanish liberalism was a\nrevolutionary ideology that marked a radical break with the\nmonarchical status quo. Liberals sought to end a corporate society and\nto create an individualistic one by abolishing corporate privileges\nand immunities and by replacing them with legal equality and economic\nfreedom. The liberal position was expressed in the\nC\u00e1diz constitution of 1812.\n\nThe most important philosophical influence that shaped the liberal\nposition was the political ideas of the French Revolution and, more\nspecifically, the 1791 Constitution (Varela Suanzes 1995). The\nC\u00e1diz constitution exhibited the influence of\nEnlightenment rationalism, the rationalist natural rights discourse,\nand the political ideas of Montesquieu and Rousseau, to name the most\nsalient referred to authors (Varela Suanzes1987). The liberal deputies\nembraced the idea of individual rights that were natural and\ninalienable. They also affirmed the natural equality of all men and\nthe doctrine of national sovereignty. Following the French model, the\nC\u00e1diz constitution established a division of powers that\nprivileged the legislative as the power that represented the nation.\nThe constitution established a unicameral legislature in which there\nwere no special provisions for the traditional preeminence of the\nclergy and the nobility. While the monarch, as the executive, was\nsubordinate to the legislative, the judiciary was held to be\nindependent, echoing Locke and Montesquieu (Varela Suanzes1983).\n\nHowever, there are two crucial features that notably distinguish the\nC\u00e1diz constitution from the French model. The former, by\ncontrast with the latter, was grounded in an appeal to history and it\nexhibited the weight of Catholicism. As regards the first feature, the\nC\u00e1diz constitution presented itself in its preamble as in\ncontinuity with fundamental old Spanish legislation that had allegedly\nbeen subverted by despotism. According to the traditional view, the\nauthority of the monarch rested on a pact with its people from which\npact followed the fundamental laws of the monarchy that the king had\nto observe. The liberal appeal to historical legitimacy was clearly at\nodds with the doctrine of national sovereignty according to which\nsovereign authority is unlimited\u2014the ultimate source of\nauthority. In fact, liberals introduced a conventional conception of\npolitical power that subverted the traditional scholastic one\naccording to which political power was natural and historical.\nNevertheless, the presentation of the Constitution as in continuity\nwith fundamental legislation tempered the break with the past (Varela\nSuanzes1987).\n\nAs regards the second feature, the C\u00e1diz constitution continued\nthe imperial protection of the Catholic religion to the exclusion of\nall others despite the fact that it also ended some privileges and\nimmunities that the Catholic Church had traditionally enjoyed. It has\nbeen argued, however, that religious intolerance was not a feature of\nSpanish liberalism, but a concession that liberals had to make to\ntraditionalist political forces in the C\u00e1diz Courts (Varela\nSuanzes1987). Nevertheless, the religious language that pervades the\nconstitutional text reveals the influence of Spanish scholasticism\naccording to which there are exterior limits to sovereignty (natural,\ndivine, historical, and teleological). This influence was even\nstronger in Spanish America since the intellectual elite around the\ntime of independence had been educated in Spanish scholasticism.\nReligious toleration was a matter of bitter disputes even among Latin\nAmerican liberals themselves and the religious language continued to\nbe present in legal documents throughout the nineteenth century.\n\nEarly Latin American liberalism must be seen through the influence of\nthe Spanish liberalism that developed in this political context,\nalthough the former\u2019s two strands developed in different\ndirections. While the Hispanic American strand (i.e., the strand in\nSpanish-speaking America) was firmly committed to a radical break with\nthe colonial past, the Brazilian one was marked by crucial points of\ncontinuity. Let us consider the Hispanic strand first. The mark of the\nC\u00e1diz constitution was evident in most Hispanic American\nconstitutions in the first half of the century (Safford 1987: 62). All\nof them claimed sovereign authority to lie in the people or the nation\nand protected some basic individual rights (such as freedom of thought\nand of the press) that were considered natural. They all maintained\nprotection of the Catholic religion as the official one as well as\nmost of the corporate privileges of the Catholic Church. They also\nestablished a separation of powers and departed from the Spanish model\nby creating bicameral systems. However, there are at least two\nimportant points of contrast between Spanish and Hispanic American\nliberals. The first one is that Hispanic American liberals could not\nbuttress their constitutionalism with appeals to historical\nlegitimacy. They could not present the constitutions that they\nproduced in continuity with the fundamental medieval laws of the\nSpanish monarchy. Independence from Spain pushed, after three\ncenturies of colonialism, to conceive of the liberal institutions as\nsomething completely new that lacked any historical precedent. By\ncontrast with Spanish liberals who looked both to the future and to\nthe past, the Hispanic American ones made a break with the past and\nlooked to the future only where emancipation and progress were\nsupposed to lie. Liberal constitutions held the promise of a society\nfully transformed away from the colonial structures and in accordance\nwith the protection of individual freedoms and legal equality. When\nHispanic American liberalism became the ideology of a political group\nin the mid-century, its identity was importantly centered in this\nforward looking attitude. Liberal political actors often referred to\nthemselves as \u201cthe party of progress.\u201d\n\nThe second point of contrast is that Hispanic American liberalism was\nmore radically egalitarian. Hispanic American liberals rejected a\nmonarchical option and very early abolished slavery and noble titles.\nBy mid-century slavery had been formally abolished in all independent\ncountries. Hispanic American liberalism became synonymous with\nrepublican government, which meant a commitment to legal equality,\npolitical representation, and the rejection of monarchism. After three\ncenturies of despotic monarchical rule, Hispanic Americans associated\nmonarchism with despotism. They feared that one-person rule, even when\nlimited by a parliament, would inevitably become despotic\u2014as it\nin fact happened in the short lived monarchy in Mexico right after\nindependence. This egalitarianism, however, did not translate into the\nestablishment of a rule of law that guaranteed equal legal treatment\nto all citizens. Nor did the egalitarian discourse translate into the\ndemocratic inclusion of all citizens in the exercise of political\nrights. Most Hispanic American liberals firmly believed in the need of\nproperty or literacy qualifications for voting and for running for\npublic office. They were consistently skeptical about extending\npolitical rights to a population that they regarded as incapable for\nrepublican citizenship.\n\nWhile early Hispanic American liberalism defined itself by its\nrejection of the colonial heritage, Brazilian liberalism, by contrast,\nacquired its identity in the confrontation with the advocates of\nmonarchical absolutism. Brazilian liberals did not challenge\nmonarchism. Instead, they sought to establish parliamentary limits to\nmonarchical authority (Cyril 2012), thus favoring a representative\nmonarchy. Though absolutists and liberals agreed on the need for a\nwritten constitution, the protection of some fundamental liberties\n(such as freedom of the press), and a legislative body that\nrepresented the nation, the differences between them turned on the\nextent and limits of the executive authority. Liberals sought to\nsubordinate the king to the legislative authority, while absolutists\npushed for the opposite balance of forces. Brazilian liberalism became\nstrongly identified with economic freedom, whereas absolutists favored\ngovernmental intervention in the economy along the lines of the late\neighteenth century reformist absolutism. While Brazilian liberals\nwished to emulate North American federalism, absolutists were firmly\ncommitted to political centralism and, hence, to the political control\nof the entire nation by the monarch. In the second half of the\ncentury, Brazilian liberals defined themselves by opposition to\n\u201cconservatives\u201d who favored political centralization, the\nperpetuation of oligarchical privilege, and resisted the emancipation\nof slaves, among other issues. However, it has been maintained that\nthe differences between the two political groups \u201cwere\nessentially rethorical\u201d (Viotti da Costa 1986).\n3. Early Hispanic American Liberalism\n\nThe liberal discourse received from the French Revolution via the\nCadiz constitution provided the language in which political actors\ndemanded emancipation from colonial rule in the early nineteenth\ncentury. This is why liberalism, though a diffuse ideology with no\nclear contours, commanded the assent of many who favored the cause of\nindependence. The discourse of liberation appealed to the notion of\npopular sovereignty in order to justify emancipation from colonial\nrule (Palti 2007: ch. 2). Representation and legal equality were\nheartfelt demands in a region that had had little if no experience in\npolitical representation while a colony, except for the brief interval\nwhen the Cadiz constitution was in force from 1812 through 1814 (Palti\n2007: ch. 4). The natural rights to freedom of thought and of the\npress were considered fundamental after centuries of tight control by\nthe Catholic inquisition, which had curtailed the free circulation of\nideas. A republican form of government with a division of powers was\nconsidered an antidote against one-person despotic rule and a clear\nsign of emancipation from monarchical absolutism. Some of those who\nwere later considered \u201cconservatives\u201d, such as Lucas\nAlam\u00e1n in Mexico, or \u201crepublicans\u201d, such as\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in Venezuela, shared in this early liberal\nconsensus. Both of them affirmed, at least initially, the core ideas\nof popular sovereignty, some natural rights, and a republican form of\ngovernment with a division of powers. Conservative constitutions, such\nas the Chilean one from 1833, affirmed these core ideas as well.\nLiberal ideas thus provided a shared perspective in relation to which\nthe various political positions that were to develop later defined\nthemselves.\n\nThe philosophical sources of this early liberalism are quite diverse\nsince public intellectuals referred to all sorts of authorities that\ncould support their own positions. Though the list is long, the most\nwidely referred to authors were Rousseau, Montesquieu, Constant, and\nBentham (Safford 1987: 68). From Montesquieu they took the defense of\na division of powers and the critique of despotism; from Rousseau the\nidea of popular sovereignty, the social contract, and the natural\nequality of men; from Constant the critique of popular sovereignty and\nthe defense of a limited government; from Bentham the rationalistic\napproach to legislation. It should be noted, however, that the\ninfluence of these authorities was not limited to those who\nconsistently subscribed to liberal views. Such an influence also\nextended across a political spectrum that acquired more definite\ncontours in later decades. The echoes of Rousseau are apparent among\nthose who advocated an egalitarian strand of liberalism that demanded\nequal political rights for all males, as in the 1814 Apatzing\u00e1n\nConstitution in Mexico, which was never in force. This constitution\nmentions the need for a virtuous citizenry, who, when in disagreement\nwith specific laws, must submit to them as a \u201csacrifice of\nparticular intelligence to the general will\u201d. But Rousseau was\nalso highly influential among those who defended clearly authoritarian\nforms of governance, such as Bol\u00edvar, who established a\nlifetime executive in the 1826 Bolivian Constitution. The same holds\nfor Constant, who was an authority for liberal intellectuals, such as\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora in Mexico, but also for some of\nthose who designed \u201cconservative\u201d constitutions, such as\nthe Mexican constitution of 1836. Constant\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cmoderating power\u201d was also picked up by the Brazilian\nmonarchy. This indicates that intellectuals often drew from the same\nphilosophical sources in order to develop political positions that\nwere, in fact, quite different from each other.\n\nIt is a matter of debate among scholars whether the notion of early\nHispanic American liberalism is only a retrospective reconstruction or\nwhether it is apt to refer to the initial usage of some liberal ideas\nfor political and legal purposes as a sort of\n\u201cliberalism\u201d. As mentioned, at this early state in the\nfirst half of the nineteenth century there were no political groups\nthat self-identified as \u201cliberal\u201d. The political\nusage of the term was not yet well established in the region. The term\n\u201cliberal\u201d still carried with it its original moral meaning\nassociated with noble qualities of generosity and magnanimity, which,\nin the Hispanic-Portuguese Catholic tradition, were virtues that the\nmonarch had to have (Fern\u00e1ndez Sebasti\u00e1n 2009:\n703\u20134). In this moral sense, \u201cliberal\u201d was opposed\nto tyranny and despotism. From the perspective afforded by this\nwidespread moral usage of the term, it became difficult for Hispanic\nAmericans political actors to identify themselves as\n\u201cliberals\u201d along the lines of Spanish liberalism. Although\nthis may seem paradoxical, the reason is that the liberal Spanish\nCourts came to be seen as \u201cilliberal\u201d since they had\ngrudgingly granted representation rights to as few American deputies\nas possible in the C\u00e1diz constitution. Early Spanish liberalism\nproved not to be incompatible with empire. This led some Hispanic\nAmerican liberals to claim distance from Spanish liberalism despite\nthe fact that the greatest impulse for the spread of liberal ideas in\nLatin America was the Cadiz constitution. According to their own\nself-perception, for instance, Colombian liberals owed nothing to the\nlatter. It was only in the twentieth century that historians have\ndemonstrated the inaccuracy of this self-conception (Mart\u00ednez\nGarnica 2006).\n\nThe moral meaning of the term \u201cliberal\u201d provided a\nperspective from which Hispanic American liberals construed their\nvision of the Spanish monarchy as a paradigm of tyranny and despotism.\nFrom the point of view of liberal ideas, more broadly, they came to\nsee the colonial past as an age of obscurantism, ignorance, and\nbackwardness (Lastarria 1844; Samper 1861; for discussion see Collier\n1967: ch. 5). This negative conception of the Spanish heritage became\na constant feature of the Hispanic American liberal frame of mind. In\nlight of their abhorrence of the colonial past, liberals insisted on\nthe need to construe completely new political institutions and to\ninstill a new political mentality in the population. They were also\nprone to blame the colonial heritage for the great difficulties that\nthey faced in carrying out these purposes. To be sure, this dismissive\nattitude towards the colonial past was not exclusive of liberals since\nit was Bol\u00edvar who famously blamed the ills of Hispanic America\non the colonial past. In his Jamaica Letter he claimed that,\nas a consequence of the colonial heritage, \u201cinstitutions which\nare wholly representative are not suited to our character, customs,\nand present knowledge\u201d (Bol\u00edvar 1815). As some\nconservatives often complained, the repudiation of the Spanish\nheritage prevented liberals from positively valuing aspects of their\nsociety that could help build stable political institutions, such as\nthe unifying force of Catholicism.\n\nIn light of this view of the character and customs inherited from the\ncolonial times, the liberal faith in the capacity of written\nconstitutions to fully transform their societies away from the\ncolonial structures and in the direction of progress went hand in hand\nwith strong a pessimism about the capacity of the majority of the\npeople to live up to the demands of such institutions. Since the\nmajority of the population shared the moral values of the colonial\nsociety and lacked even the basic skills of reading and writing, the\nelite judged them to be backward and ignorant. Most liberals indeed\ndeemed the majority of the people to be unfit for republican\ncitizenship. To be sure, the latter was a widely shared view among\nEuropean liberals who also advocated a limited franchise. Most\nHispanic American liberals endorsed the French doctrinaire\u2019s\nargument that most of the population lacked the needed independence of\njudgment to exercise political rights either because of lack of\ninstruction or because of their subservience to masters, or both,\nwhich was usually the case. A notable exception to this dominant view\nwas the short lived liberal Colombian constitution of 1853 which\ngranted universal male suffrage following the French example after the\n1848 revolution (Bushnell 1993: 108). The same year, a local\nlegislature in Colombia also granted women the right to vote for the\nfirst time in the Americas though the measure was turned down by the\nsupreme court (Bushnell 1993: 163). By contrast with their European\ncounterparts, however, the Hispanic American liberals\u2019\nconviction about the political incapacity of the masses was compounded\nby their belief that the cultural practices inherited from colonial\ntimes were a formidable obstacle for the realization of liberal\npolitical ideas. This perception motivated the disenchanted conclusion\nthat liberal institutions were not suitable for Hispanic American\nsocieties, as Bol\u00edvar put it, and as many other conservatives\nrepeatedly complained against partisans of liberalism.\n4. From Constitutional Optimism to Alternatives for Social Change\n\nIn the aftermath of independence, most Hispanic American nations\nproduced written constitutions as early as 1811 in Venezuela, New\nGranada (subsequently Colombia), and Chile. At the time, political\nactors shared the belief that a written code of law had the power to\ntransform their societies in the direction of liberal ideas. They\nbelieved that good legislation was the way to promote individual\nliberties and economic progress. According to this, former subjects of\na colonial regime would come to see themselves as the bearers of\nindividual rights and liberties as soon as the latter were\nconstitutionally protected. Likewise, on this optimistic view,\neconomic progress would naturally develop as soon as individuals were\ngranted the economic freedoms to work, to contract, and to accumulate\nwealth. This initial constitutionalism did indeed bring great changes\nwith it: the constitutional protection of freedom of thought and of\nthe press ended the traditional limits on the free circulation of\nprinted materials and allowed for an explosion in the number of\nperiodical publications in which people for the first time openly\ndiscussed political issues. Nevertheless, the liberal legislation also\nfaced strong opposition by established social powers (such as the\nCatholic Church), the new republics were marked by great political\ninstability (regimes were often overthrown), and economic progress did\nnot materialize. By mid-century this initial constitutional optimism\nhad waned and political actors looked for alternative solutions. The\ntwo most salient liberal proposed alternatives went beyond\nconstitutionalism though in different ways. According to the first\none, it was necessary to transform social practices first in order to\nprepare society for republican institutions. According to the second\nproposal, by contrast, it was necessary to engage the State in the\ntask of social and economic reform. While the former alternative seeks\nto produce social transformation from below (in civil society), the\nlatter deepens the strategy of producing social change from above (by\nthe State). Juan Bautista Alberdi advocated the first kind of strategy\nas suitable for the specific situation of Argentina. In Mexico,\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora affirmed the second alternative\n(section 6).\n\nJuan Bautista Alberdi (1810\u20131884) was a public intellectual, a\nlegal theorist, and a diplomat. He laid the theoretical foundations\nfor the Argentinian constitution of 1853, which is the most long\nlasting liberal constitution of the period (still current albeit with\nimportant reforms). His proposal for constitutional reform in\nBases and starting points for the political organization of the\nArgentine republic (Bases y puntos de partida para la\norganizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la Rep\u00fablica\nArgentina, 1852) turns on two central ideas. The first one is\nthat the South American republics should lower their aspirations:\ninstead of a \u201ctrue\u201d democratic republic, they should aim\nfor a \u201cpossible\u201d one that would pave the way towards the\nformer. The second idea is that for a true democratic republic to have\nany chance of success, society must be ready for it. On his view, the\ntransformation of civil society must take place before granting\npolitical rights to the totality of the male adult population. Alberdi\nclaimed that the much needed social transformation could take place\nthrough the interaction of the local population with northern European\nimmigrants who would bring with them the habits of order, discipline,\nand industry that were necessary for economic progress and republican\ncitizenship. Strongly influenced by the effects of massive immigration\nin California, Alberdi maintained that South America could become\ncivilized through the transplantation of Northern European culture in\nAmerican soil. Thus, his proposed solution was to promote massive\nimmigration from northern Europe in a nation that was for the most\npart sparsely inhabited. Hence his famous claim that \u201cto govern\nis to populate\u201d.\n\nAlberdi\u2019s thinking was importantly influenced by the German\nhistorical school of law (Friedrich Karl von Savigny and his French\nfollower Eug\u00e8ne Lerminier) that repudiated both natural law and\nthe widely held idea that a society could be transformed on the basis\nof legislation that did not reflect its own state of civilization\n(Alberdi 1837). His distinction between a \u201cpossible\u201d and a\n\u201ctrue\u201d republic is based on the idea that political\norganization must not be oriented by high and utopian ideals, but must\nbe grounded in historical reality. On his view, law has to be adequate\nto the society that receives it. Since he also held that an\nexamination of the situation of the South American republicans shows\nthat they are not civilized enough to govern themselves through\ndemocratic institutions, he maintained that a possible republic should\nnot grant equal political rights to all citizens. He favored a sort of\ngovernment that was republican in form, but highly authoritarian in\npractice. This, he thought, was apt in light of what he considered the\nhistorical reality of Hispanic America. He famously referred\napprovingly to Bol\u00edvar\u2019s dictum that \u201cThe new\nstates of formerly Spanish America need kings with the name of\npresident\u201d (Alberdi 1852: 415). In the end, he favored a\ncombination of federalism with political centralism: a certain degree\nof autonomy to the provinces combined with a strong executive, since,\non his view, both federalism and centralism had important historical\nroots in South America.\n\nAccording to Alberdi, the goals that should guide the political\norganization of a possible South American Republic must be responsive\nto the latter\u2019s history and state of civilization (i.e., level\nof material and political progress), which establish the limits of\npolitical possibility. On his view, the most important goal of a\npossible republic is to educate the population for representative\ndemocracy. By \u201ceducation\u201d he meant the improvement of the\nlocal population\u2019s level of civilization up to the level\nrequired for a true republic. He advocated two main means of\ncivilization: the promotion of commerce and industry, on the one hand,\nand massive European immigration, on the other. Alberdi opposed the\nidea that the population could be made fit for democracy through\nformal schooling, as many other liberals indeed maintained. Domingo\nSarmiento, the other dominant intellectual and political figure in\nArgentina at the time, favored formal schooling as the main means of\ncivilization (Sarmiento 1849; Botana 1997). By contrast with\nSarmiento, however, Alberdi held that the best means of moralization\nwere industrious work and the constant interaction with people who\nalready had the habits of order, discipline, and industry. In passages\nthat evince the influence of Adam Smith, he maintained that social\nprosperity was not the work of governments, but a spontaneous result.\nHe was completely skeptical about the possibility of civilizing the\nlocal population without the interaction with people who were already\ncivilized. He summarily remarked that \u201cwhatever is not European\nin America is barbaric.\u201d\n\nAlberdi\u2019s diagnosis about the best means for preparing the\npopulation for a true republic guides his recommendations for\nlegislation. At the heart of his liberalism is his strong defense of\nfree trade and industry. Such a defense was grounded on both economic\nand moral considerations: he regarded freedom of trade and industry as\ninstrumental for material progress and for the improvement of the\nmorals of the local population. Crucially, freedom of trade and\nindustry was also indispensable in order to attract the desired sort\nof European immigrants. The protection of civil rights and liberties\nto everyone was part of his conception of a possible republic but also\ninstrumental for promoting immigration. Though he favored religious\ntoleration in order to attract non-Catholic Europeans, he also\nmaintained that Catholicism should remain the official religion. On\nthis point, he differed from most Hispanic American liberals who not\nonly advocated the end of the official recognition of Catholicism but\nalso, in some cases, the separation between Church and state. Again,\nAlberdi\u2019s views were grounded on the realities of the\nArgentinian nation where the Catholic Church was relatively weak and\ndid not pose a political threat to the republic in the making. In this\nrespect, the situation in Mexico and Colombia was completely\ndifferent.\n5. Liberals, Conservatives, and the Religious Problem\n\nWhat gave Latin American liberals and liberalism a clear identity\naround the mid-nineteenth century was their opposition to an\nadversary. In most of Hispanic America there emerged a\n\u201cconservative\u201d reaction against the dominant liberal tide\nas well as the political and social instability that\ncharacterized the initial constitutional experiments. A salient\nexception to this general trend is Argentina where liberals faced no\nsuch strong opposition and the liberal identity was for this reason\nless clearly defined (Halper\u00edn Donghi 1988). Though liberals\nand conservatives shared some political ground, the latter were\nusually the champions of order and stability, favoring gradual social\nchange and the preservation of traditional hierarchies and privileges\n\u2013 including those historically enjoyed by the Catholic Church.\nLiberals, by contrast, favored a faster pace of change, the full\nprotection of individual liberties, and the dismantling of the\nChurch\u2019s privileges and immunities. In Hispanic America,\nliberals and conservatives agreed on the need for a written\nconstitution, the conventional nature of political authority,\nindividual representation, and the separation of powers, among other\nideas. In Brazil, the two political groups agreed on monarchical rule,\nthough conservatives favored political centralism, the maintenance of\noligarchical privilege, limited political participation, and also\nopposed the emancipation of slaves. By contrast, Brazilian liberals\nfavored more provincial autonomy, political participation, religious\nfreedom, secularization, and the end of slavery and of oligarchical\nprivilege (Viotti da Costa 1986). Radical Brazilian liberals founded a\nrepublican party that called for the end of the monarchical system and\nthe abolition of nobility titles.\n\nIn Hispanic America, what in particular was meant by\n\u201cconservatism\u201d varied across the region depending on what\nwas politically at stake. In Chile, where the conservatives had been\nsuccessful in maintaining order and economic prosperity (1831\u20131861),\n\u201cconservatism\u201d primarily meant authoritarian and\ncentralized rule. Correspondingly, liberals pressed for the full\nprotection of individual freedoms, parliamentary limits to executive\npower, and wider political participation. The 1833 Chilean\nconservative Constitution, which established a strong presidency,\nofficial religious intolerance, and a highly centralist system,\nremained in force for almost a full century and was often praised as a\nmodel for neighboring republics. Though Chilean liberals were\nanti-clerical while conservatives were not, the religious issue was\nnot as divisive in view of the relative weakness of the Catholic\nChurch. By contrast, in Colombia, where the Catholic Church had deeper\nroots, conservatism also meant, in addition to authoritarian and\ncentralist rule, a strong pro-clericalism that advocated a central\nplace for Catholicism and the Catholic Church in the republican order.\nThus, the identity of Colombian liberals correspondingly centered on a\ncombination of profound anti-clericalism with a defense of individual\nliberties and federalism. The Colombian 1853 liberal constitution\nabolished slavery and established religious freedom and the right to\ndivorce. The more radical Rionegro constitution of 1863 confiscated\nChurch property, established absolute freedom of the press, took\nfederalism to the extreme (more so than any other constitution in the\nAmericas; Bushnell 1993: 181), and limited the presidency to a two\nyear term without the possibility of immediate reelection. Chilean\nliberals took control of government in 1870 and were able to deepen\nthe process of secularization. By contrast, Colombian conservatives\nwon out in 1885 and remained in power until 1930. The 1886\nconservative Colombian constitution remained in force until 1991 with\nits strong centralism and privileging of the Catholic Church.\n\nWhile all conservatives in Hispanic America favored a strong and\ncentralized rule that could maintain peace and political stability,\nand also opposed the full protection of individual freedoms, they did\nnot look back in nostalgia to the destroyed colonial and Catholic\norder, arguably with the exception of Lucas Alam\u00e1n in Mexico\nwho also favored a return to monarchism (Collier 2003: 123), Nor did\nthey confer the Catholic church a central place in the new republican\norder, again with the exception of Alam\u00e1n but also of Miguel\nAntonio Caro in Colombia, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno in Ecuador.\nWhile the liberal forces of secularization had won out in most of the\nregion by the end of the century, the confrontation between liberals\nand conservatives played out in Colombia until the end of the\ntwentieth (Del Par 2010). Though the difference between liberals and\nconservatives was sometimes not clear cut, it has been maintained that\nthe only issue that consistently placed them at opposite sides in\nHispanic America was the religious one (Bushnell 1996, 288\u2013289).\n\nThe religious problem in Hispanic America was, in some regions,\nprimarily about religious toleration and individual rights, where the\nliberal position regarding religion centered on the demand for freedom\nof religious worship. This was the case in Argentina where the local\nCatholic Church was relatively weak. By contrast, in some other\nregions, such as Mexico or Colombia, where the church was much\nstronger, the religious problem was more complex and not merely a\nmatter of individual rights insofar as the church was powerful enough\nto destabilize the new republican governments and to challenge their\nlegitimacy. Where it had the power to do so, the church sought to\nmobilize the moral religious sensibilities of the majority of the\npopulation against the attempted liberal reforms. The church opposed\ncivil equality in order to protect its own legal privileges and\nimmunities, rejected the freedoms of thought and of the press as\nthreats to religious morality and clerical authority, fought against\neconomic reforms that endangered its position as the largest landowner\nand wealthiest corporation, favored a form of government that mirrored\nits own hierarchical structure (i.e., absolute monarchism), and sought\nto maintain official recognition and support by the state. The\nchallenge posed by the church to the new liberal republics combined\nclaims to political and economic power with the defense of morality\nand religion. In sum, the church opposed all aspects of liberal\nideology in the name of the religion of the vast majority. By contrast\nwith France at the time, liberal Catholicism did not develop in the\nAmericas.\n\nThough liberals and conservatives could agree on the need to protect\nfreedom of religious worship, as sometimes they did, they held\nopposing views regarding the sorts of institutional supports, if any,\nthat the State ought to provide to the dominant Catholic Church.\nLiberals favored the abolition of the church\u2019s privileges and\nimmunities in the name of legal equality, various degrees of exclusion\nof the church from official schooling, the establishment of a civil\nregistry and civil matrimony, the possibility of divorce, and the\nsecularization of hospitals and cemeteries. In the name of economic\nprogress and freedom, liberals sometimes advocated the confiscation of\nchurch property not directly related to religious worship in order to\nmake it available for in the market. In places where the conflict with\nthe church was most profound liberals pushed for the complete\nseparation between church and state as well as the\n\u201cneutrality\u201d of the state in religious matters. The latter\nmeant that the state should not explicitly favor or disfavor religion\nas such. This liberal position, though clearly anti-clerical, did not\nnecessarily entail hostility to religion. Though some liberals\nundoubtedly held anti-Catholic sentiments, the attack against the\nchurch was political insofar as it aimed to place the latter under the\nauthority of the state. Conservatives, in turn, defended the\nprivileges traditionally enjoyed by the church, which included\nestablishment and the church\u2019s alleged duty to spread religious\nmorality through official schooling. They also opposed the\nconfiscation of church property. Though some conservatives favored the\nchurch from authentic conviction (such as Miguel Antonio Caro in New\nGranada, the most prominent conservative intellectual there), many of\nthem did so from instrumental considerations. Conservative\npoliticians did not wish to antagonize what could be a useful\nally in the maintenance of order. This pragmatic view was Diego\nPortales\u2019, the architect of Chilean political stability (Collier\n2003), and apparently also Lucas Alam\u00e1n\u2019s, who famously\nreferred to Catholicism as \u201cthe only link that binds all\nMexicans when all others have been broken\u201d (Safford 1987: 100).\nIn the long run, those regimes that contemporized with the church\nindeed proved to be more stable than the liberal ones that antagonized\nit.\n6. Liberal Anti-Clericalism\n\nThe region where the confrontation between liberals and conservatives\nover the religious problem was most violent was Mexico, where the\ncolonial church had been the most powerful. The first confrontation\nwith the church took place in 1833, but the decisive blow to the\nchurch came with the \u201cReform Laws\u201d in 1855\u20131863,\nwhich, among other measures, nationalized most of its property and\nestablished a separation between church and State. The political\nchallenge that the church posed to the liberal regimes pushed some\nMexican liberals to move beyond their constitutionalism and to press\nfor social and economic reform. This was the case of Jos\u00e9\nMar\u00eda Luis Mora (1794\u20131850), the most prominent Mexican\nliberal and whose liberal identity came to be centered on his\nanti-clericalism. He was a historian, politician, legislator, and a\npriest. His liberalism was strongly influenced by his admiration of\nthe C\u00e1diz constitution of 1812, the writings of\nMontesquieu and Constant, and by the course of political events that\nled him to assume anticlerical views. Mora began his career as a\nliberal intellectual as a partisan of constitutionalism. A constant\ntheme in his writings is the defense of the \u201cabsolute\u201d\nliberty of opinion and the criticism of any limits to freedom of the\npress. He argued that it is impossible to limit the freedom to think\nand to have opinions since men cannot divest themselves from their\nopinions through external force. Thus, he claimed, it is neither just\nnor convenient to prevent them from expressing their thoughts. The\ncrucial point for public order, in his view, is that men observe the\nlaw regardless of the opinions that they may hold. He maintained that\nno principle of justice can ground the prohibition of doctrines\nconsidered false since men are fallible and the best or only means for\narriving at knowledge of the truth is to subject doctrines to\nexamination in a free discussion. The amendment of wrong opinions\ncannot be attained through prohibition but through the free\ncirculation of ideas (Mora 1837: 491\u20135). Following Montesquieu,\nMora placed great emphasis on the security of the person and affirmed\nthe conception of civil freedom as the faculty of doing everything\nthat the law does not expressly prohibit (Mora 1837: 504\u20136).\n\nAs an admirer of the Cadiz constitution, Mora espoused the idea of\npopular sovereignty but, following Constant, claimed that the latter\nwas not unlimited. In his engagement with Rousseau, Constant had\naffirmed the notion of the general will as the source of legitimate\npolitical authority, but had denied the unlimited authority of society\nover the individual. According to Constant, individual rights are the\nlimits that the political authority must not trespass. Mora warned\nthat any unlimited authority was essentially tyrannical and, following\nMontesquieu, characterized despotism as the lawless, absolute, and\nunlimited use of political power regardless of the hands in which it\nfalls and the particular form of government that it takes (Mora 1837:\n475). According to Mora, individual rights and liberties limit the\nexercise of political power lest it become despotic. As was\nconventional wisdom in nineteenth century French liberalism, Mora\nargued for a franchise limited to proprietors who, in his view, were\nthe only members of society capable of exerting an independent\njudgment, of displaying true civic virtues, and of caring for the\npublic good (Mora 1837: 633\u20134). At the same time, however, he\nstrove for the improvement of \u201cthe moral condition of popular\nclasses\u201d through various forms of education. However, Mora\ndeparted from the conventional wisdom of nineteenth century French\nliberalism in various ways. First, he rejected monarchism, continued\nto regard individual rights as natural, and subscribed to the doctrine\nof the social contract. He held that men\u2019s purpose in\nestablishing society is the preservation of their \u201cliberty,\nsecurity, equality and properties\u201d (Mora 1837: 475). Second,\nMora explicitly rejected Constant\u2019s defense of a\n\u201cconservative power\u201d, which was one of the latter\u2019s\nmost popular conceptions in Latin America, though not among liberals\n(Mora 1837: 681). Constant had conceived of the constitutional monarch\nas a neutral power that could moderate conflicts among the executive,\nthe legislative, and the judicial branches. As already mentioned, this\nnotion was adopted by the Brazilian monarchy.\n\nThe third way in which Mora departed from French liberalism was his\nanticlericalism, which was motivated by local political events.\nDespite his admiration for the C\u00e1diz constitution, Mora\ncriticized the fact that it did not abolish the special privileges\nenjoyed by the military and the church. With respect to the latter in\nparticular, Mora reacted against the church\u2019s opposition to the\nestablishment of republican values and came to regard it as a power\ncapable of destabilizing the republic, to subvert its laws, and to\nturn the mass of the population against it (Mora 1837: 66). He\nregarded the church as having a esprit des corps that was\nopposed to both the national spirit and the representative system\ninsofar as the church sought to maintain special privileges and\nimmunities that were contrary to civil equality. He emphasized the\nchurch\u2019s refusal to submit to civil and criminal law, its\nopposition to freedom of worship as well as to freedom of thought and\nof the press. On his view, the church opposed these freedoms because\ntheir exercise threatened the former\u2019s rule over consciences. In\nthe same vein, Mora regarded the church as an obstacle to public\neducation insofar as education was instrumental to the masses\u2019\nemancipation from priestly power (Mora 1837: 63). He also considered\nthe church as an obstacle to colonization of scarcely populated\nterritories in virtue of its opposition to freedom of worship. He even\ncriticized the clergy\u2019s celibacy, which, on his view, isolates\nits members from society insofar as family ties are the \u201cprimary\nlink that binds men to society\u201d (Mora 1837: 61). Mora advocated\nthe confiscation of the church\u2019s property on the grounds that\nthe clergy was not a productive class and lacked an inclination to\nindustrious work. In Mexico, the church was indeed the wealthiest\nfinancial agent and the largest single proprietor in the nineteenth\ncentury until most of its property was nationalized in 1859.\n\nDespite his multifaceted condemnation of the church, Mora\u2019s\nanticlericalism did not entail hostility to religion. He held that the\nchurch should be free to devote itself to its spiritual mission since\n\u201creligious beliefs and principles of conscience are man\u2019s\nmost sacred property considered as an individual\u201d (Mora 1837:\n74). His concern was to argue for the separation between the religious\nand the political \u201cprinciples.\u201d He maintained that the\nchurch should have no share in the exercise of political power, nor\nshould it have any power to coerce citizens either in the form of\nforced economic contributions or punishments that are not solely\nspiritual. He warned that the religious principle degenerates when it\nis not kept separate from the political one. By contrast with the\nArgentinian Alberdi, who did not have to deal with a similarly\npowerful Catholic Church, Mora advocated a strong reformist state\ncapable of curbing the opposition to liberal values by established\nsocial powers. According to Mora, a reformist state had to create the\nconditions for citizen\u2019s freedom and equality. This was a\nposition that was contrary to Alberdi\u2019s commitment to more\nlaissez faire liberalism.\n\nIndeed, those countries in which liberalism became the dominant\nideology in the late nineteenth century implemented secularizing\nreform laws that emancipated official institutions from control by the\nCatholic Church. Such reform laws created a civil registry,\nestablished civil matrimony and, in some cases, the possibility of\ndivorce. Church property was often confiscated, convents and\nmonasteries closed, and the Catholic Church\u2019s legal immunities\nabolished. Central among such reforms was the secularization of\nofficial schooling, which became \u201claicist\u201d. This process\nof secularization, along the lines suggested by Mora, took place\ncomparatively early in Mexico (beginning in the 1850\u2019s\n\u2013after a failed attempt in the 1830\u2019s) and Colombia\n(1850\u2019s and 60\u2019s). In both countries the process turned\nbitter and violent since the Church was powerful and was able to\noppose resistance. The \u201claicist\u201d State was consolidated in\nMexico with the total defeat of the conservative pro-clerical\nadversaries, while in Colombia the secularizing reforms were almost\nfully reverted with the triumph of pro-clerical conservative\n\u201cRegeneraci\u00f3n\u201d (1885\u20131904). During the 1870\u2019s\nand 80\u2019s similar processes of secularization took place in\nVenezuela and the Central American republics. Much less\nconfrontational and violent were comparable changes in Chile,\nArgentina, and Uruguay in the 1880\u2019s, and in later years in\nEcuador, Bolivia, and Per\u00fa (where religious freedom was\nestablished only in 1915). The process in Brazil was rather different\nsince the monarchy had maintained control over the Church through the\npatronage system (priests received State salaries and the monarch\nappointed clerical authorities, among other measures). The\nestablishment of the republic in the late 1880\u2019s, strongly\ninfluenced by positivism, brought with it full religious freedom and\nthe separation of Church and State. With the exception Colombia, the\nliberal forces of secularization won out during this period displacing\nthe Catholic Church from its traditional participation in the ruling\nof society through official political institutions.\n7. The Influence of Positivism\n\nIn the closing decades of the nineteenth century, there took place a\nfusion of liberalism with positivism in some parts of Latin America.\n\u201cPositivism\u201d was the name for a scientific approach to the\nsolution of social and political problems that was based on experience\nand observation. As developed by Auguste Comte in his Course of\nPositive Philosophy, positivism claimed that it was possible to\nuncover the laws of social phenomena and to organize society according\nto them. Comte\u2019s thesis that it was possible to combine liberty\nwith order and progress exerted great influence in Latin America along\nwith Herbert Spencer\u2019s evolutionism. While some liberals, such\nas Victorino Lastarria in Chile, sought to reconcile individual\nfreedom with positivist philosophy, some others, such as Justo Sierra\nin Mexico, frankly subordinated individual liberty to the maintenance\nof social order. Comtean philosophy was most influential in the field\nof higher education, where social reformers introduced new curricula\nthat privileged the study of the empirical sciences. Such innovations\nwere intended for the education of the elites. Educators believed,\nfollowing Comte, that the key to ending social disorder was mental\norder: education was instrumental to ending mental anarchy by\nemancipating individuals from prejudice and introducing them to\n\u201ca common reservoir of truths\u201d (Zea 1968: 125). However,\nHispanic American educators inspired by Comte did not embrace his\nreligion of humanity. The latter had the greatest impact in Brazil,\nwhere positivism displaced liberalism.\n\nJos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria (1817\u20131888) was the most prominent\nChilean liberal intellectual in the nineteenth century. He was a\nlawyer, a public intellectual, a central literary figure, and a\npolitician who held official positions. His thinking was importantly\ninfluenced by John Stuart Mill\u2019s rendering of positivist\nphilosophy in his Auguste Comte and Positivism, and by\n\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9, who popularized Comte\u2019s positivism.\nAlong with Federico Errazuriz, Lastarria wrote the \u201cBasis for\nReform\u201d (1850), which is a liberal manifesto containing the much\ndesired reforms to the conservative Chilean constitution of 1833.\nAbove all, they demanded the protection of individual liberties and\nlimits to the executive power but did not call for universal male\nsuffrage. Instead, this liberal program endorsed literacy requirements\nfor voting. When liberals came to power in 1861 they took the path of\nconstitutional reform instead of drafting a new constitution. As has\nbeen noted, Chilean liberals privileged the way of reform, as opposed\nto revolution, to press for their own political ends (Jaksic and\nSerrano 2011, Jocelyn-Holt 1998).\n\nLastarria\u2019s most important theoretical work is Lessons in\nPositivist Politics (Lecciones de pol\u00edtica\npositiva) published in 1875. The influence of positivism is\nmanifest in this work. By contrast with Comte, however, Lastarria was\na thorough individualist who extolled the perfection of the individual\nand the value of individual liberty. He refused to subordinate\nindividual liberty to social order and maintained throughout his\npolitical writings that society should protect the full exercise of\nindividual liberty. The central idea that Lastarria took from Comte is\nthe thesis that modern societies need to be guided by experience and\nscientific observation. According to this, politics must be an\nexperimental science based on experience and observation, which are\nthe only solid basis for social organization. Following Comte,\nLastarria maintained that it is possible to comprehend society\u2019s\nprogressive movement by uncovering the laws that govern social\nphenomena. On his view, in order to examine a particular form of\nsocial organization, it is necessary first to determine the laws that\ngovern humanity\u2019s progress. The most fundamental law that\nLastarria identifies and that, according to him, impulses humanity\nforward, is \u201cmoral liberty\u201d: the tendency to augment and\ndevelop all of our faculties (Lecciones, 3rd\nLesson). Social progress, on his view, is a product of this\ndevelopment. This is a perfectionist conception of the human person\naccording to which perfection is not only an individual end but also\nthe most important social end.\n\nLastarria conceived of his own epoch as one of painful transition\ntowards the triumph of liberty. Following Comte, he subscribed to the\nview that society progresses through three stages: theological,\nmetaphysical, and positive. At the theological stage, society is\nsubject to the authority of spiritual dogmas and is governed by force.\nAccording to him, this is the most vicious state because it is\ncontrary to man\u2019s moral nature and stops social development. He\nassociates the metaphysical stage with the French spirit and\ncriticizes it for its anarchy and confusion. In particular, Lastarria\ncriticizes the revolutionary conception of liberty as popular\nsovereignty which he regards as an absolute power incompatible with\nthe rights of man, properly understood. The attack against the old\ntheological order and the anarchy in the ideas characterize the epoch\nof transition towards a third, positive, stage. He identifies the\nlatter as \u201cliberal\u201d insofar as it is founded on human\nliberty, which, on his view, is ideally exercised in what he calls\n\u201csemecracia\u201d (self-government). By the latter he not only\nmeans individual self-government but also government of the people by\nthe people, which he saw realized in the North American republic that\nhe greatly admired.\n\nLastarria maintained that liberty consists in the exercise of various\nrights: the right to make decisions about one\u2019s own person\n(personal liberty), the right to exercise one\u2019s own intelligence\nand to examine received beliefs, the right to work and to acquire\nproperty, the right to associate with others, and the right to demand\nequality before the law (Lecciones, 5th Lesson).\nHe was particularly concerned with freedom of religious worship. He\nheld religion to be a fundamental idea in society but also an intimate\nand private one. Following the example of North America, he advocated\nthe separation of church and State both in order to maintain the\nindependence of the church in the carrying out of its spiritual\nmission and the neutrality of the State with respect to religious\ndogma. As many other Hispanic American liberals, Lastarria established\na connection between freedom of thought and freedom of teaching: on\nhis view, just as the State should abstain from favoring any religious\ndoctrine in particular, the State should also refrain from imposing\nany political doctrine through official schooling. Though this view\npushes towards the disappearance of official schooling, he granted\nthat the State had a duty to finance basic schooling but should leave\nall other instruction in private hands.\n\nLastarria\u2019s individualism was an exception among those Hispanic\nAmerican liberals who subscribed to positivist philosophy. The latter\ncame to see society as an organism, of which the individual is a part,\nsubject to fixed laws that determine its development. In their defense\nof a scientific approach to social problems that was based on\nobservation and experience, they claimed that law had to be adjusted\nto social reality, not the other way around. They thus rejected the\n\u201cutopias\u201d of earlier liberals and came to regard the\n\u201cold\u201d defense of natural rights and popular sovereignty as\nmetaphysical abstractions that were out of touch with reality. In the\nextreme, positivist liberals sided with the defense of authoritarian\ngovernments in the name of order and progress. In Mexico, positivist\nphilosophy became the official creed of the governing elite, the so\ncalled \u201cscientists\u201d, who did not repudiate their liberal\ncredentials. Their positivist version of liberalism, which they called\n\u201cconservative\u201d liberalism, served as the ideological\nframework for the justification of dictatorial rule. In Brazil, by\ncontrast, positivism displaced liberalism as the ideology of the\nruling elite with the fall of the monarchy and the advent of the\nrepublic in 1889 through a military coup. As has been maintained,\nBrazilian republicans, in their attacks to the oligarchy and distrust\nof the masses, were attracted to the positivist idea that\nscientifically grounded social reform had to be carried out by a\ntechnocratic elite (Krebs 2002: 269).\n8. The Decline of Liberalism, its alleged failure, and contemporary conceptual debates\n\nAfter having been the triumphant ideology of nation building in most\nof Latin America in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth,\nliberalism entered a phase of decline. In most of the region the\nliberal political and economic order was made unstable by social\nmovements that contested the oligarchical nature of the regimes and\npressed for both democratization and the inclusion of the masses in\nthe benefits of economic growth. For reasons having to do with each\nparticular national context, critics objected that the sought after\ntransformation of Latin American societies in light of liberal ideas\nand values had been a failure. Where the liberal order had led to\nauthoritarian regimes, as in Venezuela and Mexico, critics maintained\nthat liberalism had proved inadequate for these societies. In Mexico,\nthis skepticism emerged from within the liberal establishment itself\n(Rabasa 1912). In Venezuela, the positivist sociologist Laureano\nVallenilla famously argued that authoritarian forms of governance were\nmore suitable for Hispanic American societies (Vallenilla 1919). In\nChile, the liberal parliamentarian regime that had successfully\nlimited executive power in the 1870\u2019s and 80\u2019s was\ngradually eroded and finally displaced by a new presidentialism in the\n1920\u2019s. Chilean liberal parliamentarism proved unable to manage\nsocial unrest and criticism (Correa Sutil 2004 & 2008). There\nbegan a new conservative narrative that glorified the authoritarian\nregimes of the 1830\u2019s and served to legitimize authoritarian\nrule (Edwards 1928). In Argentina, the liberal oligarchical regime was\ndisplaced in elections in which universal male suffrage was mandatory\nfor the first time. The Brazilian republic, which had been established\nthrough a military coup, was in turn overthrown by another military\ncoup and replaced with a dictatorship in the 1930s. By midcentury,\ncorporativisms of various sorts as well as socialist,\nMarxist, indigenous, agrarian, and populist political movements and\nideologies had become dominant and displaced liberalism in the\nregion.\n\nThe idea view that liberal reformers had failed because liberal ideas\nwere \u201cimported\u201d and not adequate for Latin American\nsocieties has not ceased to occupy interpreters ever since (a\ndiscussion is in Hale 1984). A notable exception to this dominant view\nis the reconstruction, by an official ideologue, of Mexican liberalism\nas the official and triumphant ideology of the political regimes\nemanated from the 1910 revolution (Reyes Heroles 1957). However, there\nis currently a growing tendency to abandon the \u201cfailure\u201d\nview of liberalism and to focus on the reconstruction of what\nnineteenth century liberals aimed and accomplished, as a recent\ncollection of essays shows (Jaksic and Posada Carb\u00f3 2011b).\nScholars have engaged in conceptual debates regarding the adequate\nframework for a more sympathetic and accurate reconstruction of\nintellectual political history. The starting point has been the\ncriticism of the \u201ctraditional history of ideas\u201d that\nallegedly presumed political ideas to have a definite content subject\nto little, if any, historical change (Detailed discussions are in\nPalti 2005 & 2007, Linares Londo\u00f1o 2021). On this\n\u201ctraditional\u201d view, which is usually attributed to\nintellectual historian Leopoldo Zea, liberalism was some sort of\npolitical \u201cmodel\u201d originated in Europe and Anglo North\nAmerica that was transplanted and adapted to Latin American societies,\nwhich were, the view goes, unsuitable (Escalante 1992, Montalvo Ortega\n1995). Whatever resulted in this \u201cadaptation\u201d, this\ntraditional view continues, was a \u201cdeviation\u201d from the\noriginal model. As a commentator puts it in a recent work when\npresenting this view: \u201cthe importance of studying Latin American\nideas does not lie in their contribution to western thought but in the\n\u2018mistakes\u2019 that the former contain in relation to the\nlatter, that is, in the refractions or deviations that Latin American\nnational circumstances impressed on the original ideas\u201d (Linares\nLondo\u00f1o 2021: 47). The traditional history of ideas, thus\nunderstood, would make at least three mistaken assumptions: First,\nthat the meaning of liberalism can be established conceptually, apart\nfrom the historically changing conditions in which the notion has been\ndeployed; second, that liberal Latin American political actors sought\nto \u201capply\u201d this already complete model of liberalism to\ntheir own societies; and third, that to understand Latin American\nliberalism is primarily to trace its intellectual sources or\n\u201cinfluences\u201d in European and Anglo North American liberal\nauthors and political movements.\n\nScholars who have sought to distance themselves from the traditional\nhistory of ideas thus understood have been motivated by various\ntheoretical concerns. Some political theorists have attempted to\nshow that Latin American liberals were not mere\n\u201cimitators\u201d engaged in the application of foreign models\nbut also did produce \u201coriginal\u201d ideas that are relevant to\n\u201cwestern thought\u201d (Aguilar 2000 & 2010). Intellectual\nhistorians, on the other hand, have been motivated to avoid\nanachronisms that inevitable arise when current definitions are\nassumed in the reconstruction of past political thought and movements\n(Palti 2005 & 2007). They have also been reluctant to impose\npreconceived theoretical dichotomies in carrying out this\nreconstruction, such as tradition/modernity and\norganicism/individualism, and to avoid teleological approaches that\nregard history as pointing towards the triumph of liberalism. Instead,\nintellectual historians have attempted to offer sympathetic\nreconstructions that seek to capture what intellectuals and political\nactors meant (explicitly or implicitly) when they advocated or\ncriticized liberal ideas and institutions. There has been a growing\ninterest to seek to understand what nineteenth century liberal\npolitical actors and intellectuals meant when they affirmed a liberal\nview or other in the particular circumstances in which they did so.\nSome authors have purported to engage in professional history\ndistancing themselves from national ideologies and political\nmythologies (Hale 1968 & 1989). Others have engaged in\nconstitutional history for the sake of comparative analysis\n(Gargarella 2010 & 2013). Intellectual historians have engaged in\ndebates regarding what should be the subject matter in this\nreconstruction, whether the uses of the term \u201cliberal\u201d,\nthe concept of \u201cliberalism\u201d regardless of the terminology\nthat political actors and movements in fact employed (Fern\u00e1ndez\nSebasti\u00e1n 2009), or the political languages in which they\narticulated their own views (Palti 2007 & 2007).\n\nThese multiple approaches have called into question the historical\nstability of what we mean by \u201cliberalism\u201d and have raised\nthe issue whether anything that political actors and intellectuals\ncalled \u201cliberal\u201d can rightfully be considered as such for\nscholarly purposes. Some have resisted this conclusion and insisted on\nthe need for a prior definition of liberalism in order to properly\nidentify the subject matter of reconstruction (Aguilar 2000 &\n2010, Gargarella 2010 & 2013). On approaches of this sort,\ndefinitions of \u201cliberalism\u201d are taken from twentieth or\ntwenty-first century authors and applied retrospectively to discern\nwhat can rightfully be considered \u201cliberal\u201d and what not\nin nineteenth century Latin America. From this perspective, whatever\ndoes not fit the preferred definitions readily falls out of view, such\nas liberal social and economic reformism. Unsurprisingly, the failure\nview has to a great extent been nurtured by this kind of approach\n(Escalante 1992). In general, historians have been more willing than\npolitical theorists and philosophers to take as bona fide\n\u201cliberal\u201d positions whatever political actors and\nintellectuals claimed to be so. Some historians have assumed rather\nwide understandings of liberalism (Collier 2003), and have called to\nfree the discipline from the grip of the failure view (Hale 1989).\n\nThe late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have seen a modest\nrevival of a liberal political discourse that is partly due to the\ndecline of socialist and Marxist political movements and ideologies.\nTwo salient instances of this revival in political discourse are the\nrecognition of the pluralism of forms of life and the demands for\nprotection of the rights of minorities. In the sphere of academia,\nmany scholars have enthusiastically welcomed the influence of\nAnglo-American contemporary liberalism. The works by John Rawls,\nRonald Dworkin, Joseph Raz, and many others have received much\nattention and have been amply discussed in academic publications. It\nis interesting to notice, however, that there is a sharp separation\nbetween the reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American\nliberalism, which largely continues to be the province of historians,\non the one hand, and systematic reflection on liberal ideas and values\nby professional philosophers and political theorists, on the other.\nLittle effort has been made to relate current work on liberal ideas\nand values inspired by Anglo-American authors to the nineteenth\ncentury Latin American tradition.\n",
