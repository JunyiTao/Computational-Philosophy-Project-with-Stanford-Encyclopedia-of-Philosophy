Regularity Theories of Causation\n\nThe core idea of regularity theories of causation is that causes are\nregularly followed by their effects. A genuine cause and its effect\nstand in a pattern of invariable succession: whenever the cause\noccurs, so does its effect. This regular association is to be\nunderstood by contrast to a relation of causal power or efficacy. On a\nregularity theory, a cause and its effect only instantiate a\nregularity. No causal powers are posited in virtue of which a cause\nbrings about its effect. Moreover, no metaphysical entities or\nconnections are posited which would ground the regularities in the\nworld. Causation is not conceived of as a metaphysically thick\nrelation of production, but rather as simple instantiation of\nregularity.\n1.1 Humean Regularity Theory\n\nThe most influential regularity theory is due to Hume. He defines a\ncause to be\n\n\n[a]n object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the\nobjects resembling the former are plac\u2019d in like relations of\npriority and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter.\n(Hume 1739: book I, part III, section XIV [1978: 169])\n\n\nThis definition contains three conditions for a cause. First, a cause\ntemporally precedes its effect. Second, a cause is contiguous to its\neffect. That is, a cause is in spatiotemporal vicinity to its effect.\nThird, all objects similar to the cause are in a \u201clike\nrelation\u201d to objects similar to the effect. This third\nresemblance condition says that cause and effect instantiate a\nregularity. To see this, note the presupposition of the resemblance\ncondition: causes and effects can be sorted into types. The objects\nwhich are like the cause are of a certain type and so are the objects\nwhich are like the effect. The third condition thus says that all\nobjects of a certain type are followed by an effect of a certain\ntype.\n\nA Humean Regularity Theory (HRT), which may or may not coincide with\nHume\u2019s genuine analysis of causation, can be summarized as\nfollows: where \\(c\\) and \\(e\\) denote token events of the types \\(C\\)\nand \\(E\\), respectively,\n\n\\(c\\) is a cause of \\(e\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(c\\) is spatiotemporally contiguous to \\(e\\),\n(ii)\n\\(c\\) precedes \\(e\\) in time, and\n(iii)\nall events of type \\(C\\) are followed by an event of type\n\\(E\\).\n\n\nCausation is thus analysed in terms of spatiotemporal contiguity,\ntemporal precedence, and regular connection. The causal relation is\nreduced to non-causal entities: the two particular facts about\nspatiotemporal contiguity and temporal precedence, and the general\nregularity. There is nothing more to causation according to HRT. In\nparticular, causation does not involve a necessary connection, a\nproductive relation, causal powers, or the like\u2014not even to\nground the regularities. This stance against metaphysically thick\nconceptions of causation is characteristic for the regularity theory\n(see, e.g., Dowe 2000: Ch. 2; Psillos 2009).\n\nLet us explain some of the corollaries of HRT. The spatiotemporal\ncontiguity of cause and effect excludes causation at a distance: a\ncause is proximate to its effect, either directly or via a chain of\ncontiguous events (Hume 1739: book 1, part III, section II [1978:\n75]). The temporal precedence of the cause and the direction of time\nimply that causation is asymmetric: if \\(c\\) causes \\(e\\), then it is\nnot the case that \\(e\\) causes \\(c\\). Temporal precedence thus\nexplains the asymmetry of causation, and how we can distinguish\nbetween cause and effect. However, it also rules out the possibility\nof simultaneous and backwards-in-time causation; and it dampens the\nprospects of a non-circular theory of time defined in terms of\ncausation.\n\nCondition (iii) relates a particular instance of causation, \\(c\\) is a\ncause of \\(e\\), to the class of all like cases, the types of \\(c\\) and\n\\(e\\). Hume takes causation to be primarily a relation between\nparticular matters of fact. Yet the causal relation between these\nactual particulars holds in virtue of a certain regularity. Any causal\nrelation thus supervenes on a regularity in the sense that there can\nbe no change in the causal relation without a change in the\nregularity. Any regularity, in turn, supervenes on particular matters\nof fact: there can be no change in the regularity without a change of\nparticular matters of fact. Whether a regularity is true is thus\ndetermined by which particular matters of fact obtain. Likewise,\nwhether a causal relation obtains is determined by which regularity\nobtains. In the end, only the particular matters of fact determine\nwhether or not a causal relation obtains, since the relation of\nsupervenience is transitive. (For details, see the entries on\n supervenience\n and\n David Lewis, section on Humean supervenience.)\n\nAccording to condition (iii), a cause is a sufficient\ncondition for its effect in this sense: all \\(c\\)-like events\noccurring in the actual world are in fact followed by an \\(e\\), where\nthe actual world is understood as the collection of all particular\nspatiotemporal matters of facts. The sufficiency of the cause for the\neffect is not to be understood in a modally stronger sense (Dowe 2000:\n20). In particular, Hume denies that a cause necessitates its effect.\nIn the world, there is\u2014to use Hume\u2019s phrase\u2014just a\n\u201cconstant conjunction\u201d between cause and effect.\n\nOn HRT, every effect has a sufficient cause. This does not imply that\nany event has a sufficient cause, but it says that, if there is a\ncausal relation, it is deterministic. Probabilistic causation is thus\nnot covered by HRT. And while the theory is compatible with a\nprobabilistic analog of causation, we follow Hume in restricting\nourselves to deterministic causation in this entry. (See the entry on\n probabilistic causation\n for an overview of theories of causation, where the underlying\nprocesses may be indeterministic.)\n\nHRT allows us to discover causal relations. We may observe\nspatiotemporal contiguity, temporal precedence, and that a certain\ntype of event is generally followed by another type of event. Upon\nrepeated observation of an invariable pattern of succession, we begin\nto expect that this particular event of a certain type is followed by\nthat particular event of a certain type. We develop an inferential\nhabit due to the experienced constant conjunction of types. Or as Hume\nputs it:\n\n\nA cause is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and\nso united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to\nform the idea of the other. (Hume 1739: book 1, part III, section XIV\n[1978: 170])\n\n\nOur mind forms a habit to expect or to infer the effect from a cause\nupon repeatedly experiencing events which occur in sequence. Thereby,\nwe produce a connection between objects or events that goes\n\u201cbeyond what is immediately present to the senses\u201d (1739:\nbook I, part III, section II [1978: 73]). Our senses and our memory\nprovide us only with finitely many instances of objects or events\nwhich occur jointly, and from which our minds form inferential habits.\nStill these inferential habits apply also to future, as of yet\nunobserved instances of the regularity. In Hume\u2019s words,\n\n\nafter the discovery of the constant conjunction of any objects, we\nalways draw an inference from one object to another, [\u2026].\nPerhaps \u2019twill appear in the end, that the necessary connexion\ndepends on the inference, instead of the inference\u2019s depending\non the necessary connexion. (Hume 1739: book 1, part III, section VI\n[1978: 88])\n\n\nAnd indeed, Hume says that \u201c[n]ecessity is something that exists\nin the minds, not in objects\u201d (1739: book I, part III, section\nXIV [1978: 165]). So there is no necessary connection in the\nworld which would go beyond regular association. However, the\ninferential habits we develop based on the perceived regularities\nmakes us feel that the connection between cause and effect is stronger\nthan mere invariable succession. The necessary connection exists\nin our minds but not in the objects (see section in\nthe entry on\n Hume on Necessary Connection: Constructive Phase).\n\nAccording to the standard interpretation, the regularities themselves\nare real. There really are jointly and repeatedly occurring events of\ncertain types that are spatially contiguous and some temporally\nprecede others. And the regularities are mind-independent: even if\nthere were no minds around, the regularities would exist as patterns\nin the Humean mosaic of particular facts.\n\nIs causation in the world, as expressed by HRT, extensionally\nequivalent to causation in the mind? The difference between the two\ndefinitions seems to be that condition (iii) of HRT is replaced by the\nfollowing condition: \\(c\\) of type \\(C\\) makes us infer \\(e\\) of type\n\\(E\\). While HRT does not require the presence of an epistemic agent,\nthe other definition seems to require such an agent and is thus\nmind-dependent. And an epistemic agent may infer an event from another\nevent, even though there is no regularity connecting the two events.\nHaving said that the two definitions are not extensionally equivalent,\nthe definitions can be read in ways which make them coextensive. The\nepistemic agent of the second definition, for example, can be seen as\na hypothetical omniscient observer who always and only infers in\naccordance with all and only true regularities (for details, see\nGarrett 1997: Ch. 5).\n\nWhat is Hume\u2019s view on causation? We will not enter this\nexegetical debate here. Suffice it to say that the interpretations of\nHume are manifold. Psillos (2009: 132) says that HRT \u201cwas\nHume\u2019s view, too, give or take a bit\u201d and argues for it in\nPsillos (2002: Ch. 1). But there are many deviating interpretations\n(Beebee 2006; Garrett 2009; Strawson 1989; J. Wright 1983). The\nrelation between causation in the world and causation in the mind, in\nparticular, has remained a matter of debate among Hume scholars (see\ne.g., Garrett 1993).\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the Humean Regularity Theory. HRT enjoys two\nbenefits. As we have observed, no substantive metaphysics is needed to\nexplain causation. No entities like causal powers or a necessary\nconnection between cause and effect need to be posited. Causation is\nrather reduced to spatiotemporal contiguity, temporal precedence, and\nregular association. Second, Hume\u2019s regularity theory explains\nhow we can figure out what causes what. A cause is simply the event\nwhich temporally precedes and is spatiotemporally contiguous to\nanother event such that the former and latter event instantiate a\nregularity. Since temporal precedence and spatiotemporal precedence\ncan be observed, the problem of identifying causes reduces to the\nproblem of identifying regularities.\n\nHowever, HRT also faces serious problems. Recall that it presupposes\nthat causes and effects can be sorted into types which are connected\nby a regularity. But it is unclear how the sorting can be achieved.\nWhat makes an event \u201clike\u201d another? Which aspects of the\nobjects or events are relevant for the sorting? Many contemporary\nphilosophers explicate the relevant notion of resemblance or\nsimilarity in terms of laws of nature. If there is a law of the form\n\\(\\forall x (A(x) \\rightarrow B(x))\\), then events similar to a token\nevent \\(a\\) are simply events of the same type\u2014other\ninstantiations of \\(A\\)\u2014and events similar to \\(b\\) are also\njust token events of the same type. However, it is a non-trivial task\nto give a satisfying account of what a law of nature is\u2014to say\nthe least.\n\nA second problem runs as follows. Assume, plausibly, that a giant\nmeteor caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For the meteor to be a\ncause on HRT, there must be a regularity saying that events like giant\nmeteors hitting the Earth are followed by events like the extinction\nof the dinosaurs. But it seems as if such a regularity does not exist:\nthe next giant meteor hitting the Earth will not cause the dinosaurs\nto go extinct. The dinosaurs are already extinct. The problem is that\nthe meteor is only a cause of the extinction on a single occasion. But\naccording to HRT this one meteor hitting the Earth is only a cause if\nsome other meteors hitting the Earth also satisfy the regularity. But\nwhy would events far away in space and time determine whether or not\nthis giant meteor caused the extinction of the dinosaurs on this\noccasion? It seems as if we can have causation without regularity on a\nsingle occasion. We will refer to this problem as the problem of\nsingular causal relations.\n\nA third problem is that there can be regularity without causation. The\ncry of the cock precedes the rise of the sun and the two events are\nregularly associated. And yet the cry of the cock is not a cause of\nthe sunrise. A special case of this problem arises from joint effects\nof a common cause. Suppose an instantiation \\(c\\) of \\(C\\) is a common\ncause of the instantiations \\(a\\) of \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) of \\(B\\), where\nthe token event \\(a\\) precedes the token event \\(b\\) in time (see\n Figure 1).\n Further suppose \\(C\\) is instantiated whenever \\(A\\) is. That is,\nwhenever a token event of type \\(A\\) occurs, a token event of type\n\\(C\\) occurs. Then there is a regular connection between \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), which we normally do not count as a causal relation. This\nproblem remains a central challenge for regularity theories to\ndate.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nSetting aside the possibilities of remote and backwards causation for\nnow, a regularity theory of causation is only tenable when the three\nproblems can be answered. The next section focuses on how laws of\nnature may help overcome the problem of sorting events into\nappropriate types and how they may exclude the cry of the cock as a\ncause of the sunrise.\n1.2 Regularities and Laws\n\nMill (1843) refined the Humean Regularity Theory of causation. An\neffect usually occurs only due to several instantiated factors, that\nis, instantiated event types. He distinguishes between positive and\nnegative factors. Let \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) be a set of\npositive factors and \\(\\overline{D}_1,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\overline{D}_m\\) a set of negative factors which are together\nsufficient for an effect \\(E\\). Mill says that the totality of present\npositive and absent negative factors sufficient for an effect to occur\nis the cause of this effect. In symbols, the totality of the token\nevents \\(c_1,\\) \\(c_2,\\) \u2026, \\(c_n\\) and the absence of any\ntoken events of the types \\(D_1,\\) \\(D_2,\\) \u2026, \\(D_m\\) is a\ncause of an occurring event \\(e\\) iff \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(C_n,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_1,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\overline{D}_m\\) is sufficient for \\(E\\).\n\nFurthermore, Mill claims that causation requires lawlike regularities.\nMere regular association is not enough. The cry of a cock (as part of\na totality of conditions) precedes the rise of the sun and the former\nis invariably followed by the latter, and yet the cry of a cock does\nnot count as a cause of the sunrise. For the regularity is not a law\nof nature, it is a mere accidental regularity.\n\nThe Millian Regularity Theory (MRT) can be summarized as follows:\n\nThe totality of present positive factors \\(\\{ C_{1-n} \\}\\) and absent\nnegative factors \\(\\{ \\overline{D}_{1-m} \\}\\) is a cause of an event\n\\(e\\) of type \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\n\nthere are events of type \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) which are\nspatiotemporally contiguous to \\(e\\) and there are no such events of\ntype \\(D_1,\\) \\(D_2,\\) \u2026, \\(D_m\\), \n(ii)\n\n\nthe events of type \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) precede \\(e\\)\nin time, and \n(iii)\n\n\nit is a law of nature that an instantiation of all positive\nfactors \\(\\{ C_{1-n} \\}\\) is followed by an instantiation of factor\n\\(E\\) when none of the negative factors \\(\\{ D_{1-m} \\}\\) is\ninstantiated. \n\n\nWhat are laws of nature? Well, on a regularity theory of causation, a\nlaw is a regularity understood as a stable pattern of\nevents\u2014nothing more, nothing less. And yet, laws are still\nspecial regularities. According to Mill (1843), regularities which\nsubsume other true regularities are more general than the subsumed\nones. The laws of nature are those regularities which are the most\ngeneral. They thus organise our knowledge of the world in an ideal\ndeductive system which strikes the best balance between simplicity and\nstrength (see, e.g., 1843: Book III, Ch. XII). This best system\naccount of laws has been further developed by Ramsey and Lewis. Ramsey\nputs it as follows,\n\n\neven if we knew everything, we should still want to systematize our\nknowledge as a deductive system, and the general axioms in that system\nwould be the fundamental laws of nature. The choice of axioms is bound\nto some extent to be arbitrary, but what is less likely to be\narbitrary if any simplicity is to be preserved is a body of\nfundamental generalizations, some to be taken as axioms and others\ndeduced. (1928 [1978: 131])\n\n\nEverything else being equal, a system with fewer axioms is simpler.\nSimplicity thus demands the pruning of inessential elements from the\nsystem of laws. A deductive system is stronger when it entails more\ntruths. Strength demands that the deductive system of laws should be\nas informative as possible. Note that simplicity and strength compete.\nA system consisting of only one uncomplicated axiom is simple but not\nvery informative. A system which has one axiom for any truth is very\nstrong but far from simple. To avoid a deductive system that is too\nsimple to be informative and one that is too complicated, we need to\nbalance simplicity and strength. The proper balance between simplicity\nand strength makes the deductive system best.\n\nThere is no guarantee that there is a unique best deductive system. If\nthere is none, the laws of nature are those axioms and theorems that\nare common to all deductive systems that tie with respect to\nsimplicity and strength (or are at least good enough). D. Lewis thus\nsays that\n\n\na contingent generalization is a law of nature if and only if\nit appears as a theorem (or axiom) in each of the true deductive\nsystems that achieves a best combination of simplicity and strength.\n(1973: 73)\n\n\nAs a consequence, laws are simple and yet highly informative as a part\nof each best deductive system. The regularity about the cry of the\ncock and the sunrise is not part of a best deductive system. And\nwhichever regularity is not part of any best system is accidental: it\nis not a law of nature. The dividing line between laws and accidental\nregularities is determined by being a part of any best system. Note\nthat no regularity can be regarded as a law of nature in absence of a\nfull system.\n\nThere is a worry that the best system account of laws is infected by\nepistemic considerations. Of course, what truths a best system entails\nis an objective matter, it does not depend on our knowledge of it.\nWhether a truth is objectively implied by a best system, however,\ndepends on the way this system is organized. And there may be\nconsiderable leeway in choosing the axioms to obtain a simple system.\nThe worry is that the notion of simplicity is not fully objective, and\neven if it were, striking a balance between simplicity and strength is\nnot. Hence, which regularities are laws depends on epistemic criteria,\nour desiderata to organize our knowledge as simple as possible in a\ndeductive system. This is not to say that the lawlike regularities are\nmind-dependent. Laws and regularities are still patterns in the world\nindependent of our knowledge of them. What makes some of the\nregularities laws and some others not, however, is not only determined\nby the world. The law-making feature, striking a proper balance\nbetween simplicity and strength, seems to have an epistemic component.\nThis is presumably the cost for being free of substantive metaphysical\ncommitments. (For details on the best system account of laws, see\nthe entry on\n laws of nature.)\n\nWhat does the epistemic component mean for causation as lawlike\nregularity? The regularity is determined solely by the world, but the\nlawlikeness of a regularity rests, in part, on epistemic criteria. So,\nwhile causation is not arbitrary\u2014there must still be a\nregularity for causation\u2014there is an epistemic element in\nchoosing which regularities constitute causation. In brief, the\nregularities are mind-independent, what causes what is not.\n\nThe Humean regularity theory, where causation is instantiation of\nregularity, presupposes that events can be sorted into types. A type\nis a class of resembling events. Based on the best systems account, we\nmay now appeal to laws of nature in order to determine which events\nare similar and which are dissimilar. Suppose it is a law that all\nevents \\(a\\) of type \\(A\\) are followed by events \\(b\\) of type \\(B\\).\nThen the events or objects similar to \\(a\\) are just the other\ninstantiations of type \\(A\\), and likewise for type \\(B\\). But the\nlaw-making feature depends on epistemic considerations, and so the\ntypes determined by those laws depend on epistemic considerations.\nHence, falling back to a Humean regularity theory does not solve the\nissue. We still need a way to sort events into types. But which events\nresemble each other comes in degrees and depends on the respects of\ncomparison. The degrees of similarity and respects of comparison are\nnot fixed by the world understood as the collection of all particular\nspatiotemporal matters of fact. The degrees and respects are rather\nepistemic components which depend on the categories and classification\nschemes we use. A related problem are gerrymandered categories or\nproperties like \u201cgrue\u201d, as studied by Goodman (1955) in\nhis new riddle of induction.\n\nSome defenders of the regularity theory see the dependence on\nepistemic components as a problem. To solve it, one may want to posit\nthat there are natural properties which carve nature at its joints.\nThe idea is that those natural properties provide a fully objective\nclassification. Those natural properties would ensure that the lawlike\nregularities are free of epistemic components. However, what is\nnatural is notoriously difficult to define. Natural properties, which\nare objectively similar and dissimilar to each other, are thus often\nsimply posited as primitives which are not analysed further, as Lewis\n(1986: 60\u20132) does for example.\n1.3 INUS Conditions\n\nOn the Millian Regularity Theory, a cause is nomologically sufficient\nfor its effect: there is a law of nature such that the occurrence of a\ncause suffices for the occurrence of its effect. A cause is taken to\nbe a totality of positive and negative factors which is sufficient and\nnecessary for the effect. However, one and the same effect can have\nmany causes understood as sufficient and necessary totalities\n(as has already been observed by Venn 1889). Each of these distinct\ntotalities, or clusters of factors, is sufficient to bring about the\neffect, but no single one is necessary if another cluster is\nactual.\n\nMackie (1974: 63) conceives of each cluster of factors as a\nconjunction, for example \\(C \\land \\neg A\\), where \\(C\\) is a type of\nevent and \\(\\neg A\\) is the absence of any event of type \\(A\\).\nConsider, for instance, a house which burns to the ground. There is a\nvariety of distinct clusters which can cause the burning of the house.\nOne cluster includes a short-circuit, the presence of oxygen, the\nabsence of a sprinkler system, and so on. Another cluster includes an\narsonist, the use of petrol, again the presence of oxygen, and so on.\nYet another cluster includes a burning tree falling on the house, and\nso on. Each cluster is a conjunction of single factors. The\ndisjunction of all clusters represents then the plurality of causes\n(see Mackie 1965: 245 and 1974: 37\u201338 for details).\n\nThe disjunction of all clusters for an effect is relative to a\ncausal field. A causal field is \u201ca background against\nwhich the causing goes on\u201d (1974: 63). Roughly, a causal field\ncaptures the circumstances which are kept fixed and so cannot even be\nconsidered as (part of) a cause. Or, as Mackie puts it, what is caused\nis\n\n\nnot just an event, but an event-in-a-certain-field, and some\nconditions can be set aside as not causing this-event-in-this-field\nsimply because they are part of the chosen field. (1974: 35)\n\n\nSuppose a causal field includes that a certain person was born and\nalive for a while. Being born thus cannot be a cause of the\nperson\u2019s death relative to this causal field. However, with\nenough ingenuity, the person being born is a cause of the\nperson\u2019s death relative to a causal field which does not include\nthat the person was born and alive for a while as a part of the fixed\nbackground (see 1974: 37).\n\nThis suggests that the regularity for an effect is a disjunction of\nconjunctions which is necessary and sufficient for the effect relative\nto a causal field. Relative to this field, each cluster is sufficient\nfor the burning of the house, but no single one is necessary; for\nanother cluster can be sufficient for the burning. (\\(C\\) is\nsufficient for \\(E\\) means that, whenever an event of type \\(C\\)\noccurs, so does an event of type \\(E\\). \\(C\\) is necessary for \\(E\\)\nmeans that an event of type \\(E\\) only occurs if an event of type\n\\(C\\) occurs.) For simplicity, suppose the complex regularity\n(relative to a particular causal field) has the form: \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nOn the one hand, any cluster, for example \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\), is\nminimally sufficient for \\(E\\) (and so is the\n\u201ccluster\u201d \\(D_1\\)). \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) is minimally\nsufficient for \\(E\\) means that the cluster is sufficient for \\(E\\)\nand each conjunct of the cluster is necessary for its sufficiency. So\nno conjunct of any cluster is redundant for bringing about the effect.\nOn the other hand, neither cluster is necessary for the effect \\(E\\).\n\\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) is minimally sufficient but not necessary for \\(E\\).\n\\(E\\) occurs if \\(D_1\\) does. Now, focus on \\(C_1\\) which is on its\nown insufficient to bring about \\(E\\). \\(C_1\\) is a single factor of\nthe cluster \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) which is a sufficient but unnecessary\ncondition for \\(E\\). Hence, \\(C_1\\) is an insufficient but\nnon-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition for\n\\(E\\) (relative to a causal field). Or simply, \\(C_1\\) is an INUS\ncondition for \\(E\\).\n\nIn general, a complex regularity has the form: \n\n\\[(C_{1,1} \\land \\ldots \\land C_{1, n}) \\lor \\ldots \\lor (C_{k, 1} \\land \\ldots \\land C_{k, m}) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nEach single factor \\(C_{i, j}\\) of a cluster is a potential cause.\nHence, a cause is at least an INUS condition (relative to a particular\ncausal field). \u201cAt least\u201d because there are limiting\ncases:\n\n(i)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\lor C_{2} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(E\\);\n(ii)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\land C_{2} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a necessary condition for \\(E\\); and\n(iii)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a necessary and sufficient condition for \\(E\\).\n\n\nOn Mackie\u2019s theory, a factor \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff \\(C\\)\nis at least an INUS condition of \\(E\\), and each factor of the cluster\nthat contains \\(C\\) and is sufficient for \\(E\\) is instantiated.\n\nHow does Mackie\u2019s theory of causation go beyond the regularity\ntheories by Hume and Mill? Unlike HRT, Mackie\u2019s theory captures\ncausal scenarios where several different events are necessary to bring\nabout a certain effect, and so qualify as a cause of the latter. Take\nthe regularity \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nSuppose \\(C_1, C_2,\\) and \\(D_1\\) occur independently of one another.\nThere is neither a strict positive nor a strict negative correlation\namong these events. There are cases where \\(C_1\\) does not occur but\n\\(D_1\\) does, and so \\(E\\) will occur. There are also cases where\n\\(C_1\\) occurs but \\(C_2\\) and \\(D_1\\) do not, and so \\(E\\) will not\noccur. And there will be cases where \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) occur\ntogether so that an instance of \\(C_1\\) qualifies as a cause of an\ninstance of \\(E\\). An event of type \\(C_1\\) may therefore be a cause\nof an event of type \\(E\\), without there being a strict regular\nsuccession between \\(C_1\\)-events and \\(E\\)-events. This being said,\nHume (1739: book I, part III, section XV) considers causation without\nstrict regular succession. There, he seems to propose a regularity\ntheory that goes beyond HRT and may cover causation based on\nnon-strict succession.\n\nThe advantages of Mackie\u2019s theory over Mill\u2019s are less\nobvious. Recall that for Mill, a cause is a totality of positive and\nnegative factors such that, in the respective causal scenario, this\ntotality is sufficient for \\(E\\). On this theory, events of type \\(C\\)\nmay be members of a cause for an effect of type \\(E\\), without there\nbeing a strict regular succession between \\(C\\)-events and\n\\(E\\)-events. Moreover, the notion of a totality of factors is\nconsistent with there being several totalities that are sufficient to\nbring about an event of type \\(E\\). In other words, several totalities\nmay serve as instances of some cluster in one and the same\nMackie-style regularity. These totalities may be represented by\nconjunctions and joined by disjunctions. If we amend the Millian\nregularity theory by a requirement of minimal sufficiency, it seems as\nif we can go back and forth between a Mill-style and a Mackie-style\nrepresentation of causes, with the qualification that causes in the\nsense of Mackie are mere factors of a cause in the sense of Mill. In\nthis sense, the two theories seem to be intertranslatable. It should\nbe pointed out, however, that Mackie\u2019s theory gives us a more\nexplicit and concise representation of the several totalities, or\nclusters, which are minimally sufficient to bring about a certain type\nof effect. The complex regularities and their elegant logical\nrepresentation have not been in the conceptual repertoire of Mill.\n\nAnother merit of Mackie\u2019s theory is that it provides an\nexplanation for causal inference. If we know that an effect of type\n\\(E\\) occurred, and that \\(D_1\\) was not present, we may infer that\nthe cluster \\((C_1 \\land C_2)\\) occurred. In particular, we may infer\nthat \\(C_1\\) caused \\(E\\).\n\nMackie\u2019s regularity theory of causation still fails to\ndistinguish between genuine causes and mere joint effects of a common\ncause. To see this, consider an example adapted from Russell (1921\n[1961: 289]): the sounding of factory hooters in Manchester is\nregularly followed by London workers leaving their work. And yet the\nformer is not a cause of the latter. However, as Mackie (1974:\n81\u201384) himself points out, the sounding of the hooters in\nManchester counts as a cause for the workers going home in London:\n\n\nIn more concrete terms, the sounding of the Manchester factory\nhooters, plus the absence of whatever conditions would make them sound\nwhen it wasn\u2019t five o\u2019clock, plus the presence of whatever\nconditions are, along with its being five o\u2019clock, jointly\nsufficient for the Londoners to stop work a moment\nlater\u2014including, say, automatic devices for setting off the\nLondon hooters at five o\u2019clock, is a conjunction of features\nwhich is unconditionally followed by the Londoners stopping work.\n(1974: 84)\n\n\nThe structure of the example can be given as follows. There are two\ninstantiated effects \\(E_1\\) (the sounding of the hooters in\nManchester) and \\(E_2\\) (the workers going home in London) such that\n\\(C_1\\) (knocking-off time at five o\u2019clock) is an instantiated\ncommon INUS condition: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} (C_1 \\land C_2) & \\lor D \\leftrightarrow E_1, \\text{ and}\\\\ (C_1 \\land C_3) & \\lor B \\leftrightarrow E_2. \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say that \\(C_2\\) and \\(C_3\\) are instantiated\non this particular occasion. Well then, \\(C_1\\) counts as a common\ncause of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) on Mackie\u2019s theory.\n\nIn the presence of the complex regularities, the cluster\n\n\\[E_1 \\land \\neg D \\land C_3\\]\n\n\nis sufficient for \\(E_2\\). Indeed, the cluster of the sounding of the\nhooters in Manchester (\\(E_1\\)), the absence of any conditions that\nwould make the Manchester hooters sound when it was not five\no\u2019clock (\\(\\neg D\\)), and the presence of all conditions\n(\\(C_3\\)) that are together with it being five o\u2019clock (\\(C_1\\))\njointly sufficient for the workers going home in London\n(\\(E_2\\))\u2014this cluster is sufficient for the workers going home\nin London. Hence, \\(E_1\\) is at least an INUS condition of \\(E_2\\). If\n\\(D\\) is not instantiated, but \\(C_2,\\) \\(C_3,\\) \\(E_1,\\) and \\(E_2\\)\nare, then the instantiation of \\(E_1\\) counts as a cause of the one of\n\\(E_2\\). More generally, an effect of a cause \\(C_1\\) may be part of\nan instantiated cluster sufficient for another effect of \\(C_1\\). This\nshows that, on Mackie\u2019s theory, an effect of a common cause may\nfalsely count as a cause for another effect of said common cause.\n\nFor Mackie (1974: 85\u201386), this type of problem indicates that\nhis regularity theory is at best incomplete. And he tells us what is\nmissing: a genuine cause-effect relation is marked by causal priority.\nAs an approximation, a token event \\(c\\) was causally prior to another\ntoken event \\(e\\) if an agent could have\u2014in\nprinciple\u2014prevented \\(e\\) by \u201c(directly or indirectly)\npreventing, or failing to bring about or to do \\(c\\)\u201d (1974:\n190). To prevent the sounding of the Manchester hooters does not\nprevent the workers from going home in London. Hence, the instance of\n\\(E_1\\) was not causally prior to the associated instance of \\(E_2\\)\n(though it is temporally prior). By contrast, preventing the sounding\nof the London hooters does prevent the workers from going home in\nLondon.\n\nThe approximate relation of causal priority is interventionist. Causes\nare seen as devices for an (ideal) agent to manipulate an effect.\nHowever, Mackie did not propose an interventionist theory of\ncausation. His final notion of causal priority is independent of a\nnotion of agency. \\(c\\) was causally prior to \\(e\\) if there was a\ntime at which \\(c\\) was fixed while \\(e\\) was unfixed (see 1974:\n180-183 and 189-192). It should be noted, however, that Mackie himself\ndoes not think that his analysis of causal priority succeeds (1974:\nxiv).\n\nAnother problem for Mackie\u2019s regularity theory is that the\ncomplex regularities seem to be symmetric. This symmetry blurs the\nasymmetry between cause and effect, and leads to the problem of the\ndirection of causation. Like Hume, one could stipulate that causes\nprecede their effects in time. The direction of causation is thus\nsimply the direction of time. However, this stipulation excludes both\nthe possibility of (a) backwards causation and (b) an analysis of\n\u201ctime\u2019s arrow\u201d in terms of causation. Since\u2014to\nthe best of our knowledge\u2014there is no account of causation which\nhas fully solved the problem of the causal direction, the objections\n(a) and (b) do not speak decisively against the regularity theory.\n1.4 Contemporary Regularity Theories\n\nMackie\u2019s theory of causation continues to be influential.\nRichard Wright (1985, 2011) proposed a similar account for identifying\ncauses which can be, and indeed is, used in legal contexts. Building\non Hart and Honor\u00e9 (1985), he defined a cause as follows: a\ncondition \\(c\\) was a cause of \\(e\\) iff \\(c\\) was necessary for the\ncausal sufficiency of a set of existing conditions that was jointly\nsufficient for the occurrence of \\(e\\). Causal sufficiency is here\ndifferent from lawful sufficiency: the set of conditions must\ninstantiate the antecedent of a causal law whose consequent is then\ninstantiated by the effect. Wright\u2019s account requires that we\nhave causal laws\u2014as opposed to laws\u2014at our disposal and so\nit is only reductive if we have a reduction of the causal laws.\nNevertheless, the idea that a cause is a necessary element of a\nsufficient set for an effect has been applied in legal cases to\ndetermine which event has caused another. In fact, this NESS test for\ncausation has itself become influential in legal theory (see the entry on\n causation in the law).\n\nStrevens (2007) develops Mackie\u2019s theory further. On the way, he\nlikewise gives up its reductive character by replacing sufficiency\nwith causal sufficiency. The latter is to be understood in terms of\ncausal entailment, which in turn is supposed to represent a causal\nprocess. (We explain Strevens\u2019s theory of causation in greater\ndetail in\n \u00a72.4.)\n Notably, Strevens (2007) argues that Mackie\u2019s original theory\nalready solves not only the causal scenario known as\noverdetermination\u2014as everyone agrees\u2014but also (early and\nlate) preemption. (For an overview of problematic causal scenarios,\nsee Paul & Hall 2013).\n\nBaumgartner (2008, 2013) developed Mackie\u2019s theory further while\nkeeping its reductive character. He observes that complex regularities\nlike \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E\\]\n\n\nare not symmetric in the following sense: an instantiation of a\ncluster is sufficient for \\(E\\), but an instantiation of \\(E\\) is\ngenerally not sufficient to determine which cluster is instantiated.\nAn instantiation of \\(E\\) does not determine whether \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\)\nor \\(D_1\\) is instantiated. An instantiation of \\(E\\) only determines\nthe whole disjunction of minimally sufficient clusters. This\nnon-symmetry may be exploited to establish a notion of causal priority\nor the direction of causation.\n\nThere is, of course, a problem when a single cluster is necessary and\nsufficient for an effect: \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nHere the instantiation of \\(E\\) is sufficient to determine the\ninstantiation of the cluster. Baumgartner\u2019s suggestion requires\nan effect to have at least two alternative sufficient clusters in\norder to establish the direction of causation. And even then, it seems\nthat the problem of joint effects of a common cause is still unsolved.\nConsider\n Figure 2,\n where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the joint effects of a common cause \\(C\\),\nand \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are alternative causes for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nrespectively.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nWhenever \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is actual, so is \\(C\\)\u2014for no effect\noccurs without any of its causes. Furthermore, whenever \\(C\\) occurs,\nso does \\(B\\). Hence, \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is minimally sufficient for\n\\(C\\), and thus for \\(B\\). And \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is a minimally\nsufficient cluster in a necessary condition for \\(B\\):\n\\[\\tag{1} (A \\land \\neg D) \\lor C \\lor E \\leftrightarrow B.\\]\n\nBut \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) should not count as a cause of \\(B\\). After\nall, the causes of \\(B\\) are only \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) in this causal\nscenario.\n\nBaumgartner proposes a solution. The complex regularity for an effect\nmust be necessary for that effect in a minimal way. \\(B\\) is\ninstantiated only if \\(C\\) or \\(E\\) is instantiated. Hence, \\(C \\lor\nE\\) is necessary for \\(B\\). And the left side of the complex\nregularity\n (1)\n contains no other disjunction\u2014obtained by removing one\ndisjunct\u2014which is necessary for \\(B\\). There are only two\ncandidates. \\((A \\land \\neg D) \\lor C\\) is not necessary because \\(B\\)\ncan be instantiated along with \\(E, \\neg C\\), and \\(A \\land D\\).\nSimilarly, \\((A \\land \\neg D) \\lor E\\) is not necessary because \\(B\\)\ncan be instantiated along with \\(C,\\) \\(\\neg E\\) and \\(A \\land D\\).\nHence, \\(B \\rightarrow C \\lor E\\) and no disjunct can be removed from\n\\(C \\lor E\\) such that the implication still holds. In this sense, \\(C\n\\lor E\\) is a minimally necessary disjunction of minimally\nsufficient clusters for \\(B\\).\n\nThe notion of a minimally necessary disjunction can also be\ncharacterized in terms of more formal concepts. Suppose \\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\nis a set of clusters, where each cluster is given by a conjunction of\nfactors. \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a minimally necessary condition for \\(E\\)\niff\n\n(i)\n\\(\\bigvee \\mathbf{C} \\leftrightarrow E\\) is true in the actual\nworld, and\n(ii)\nthere is no \\(\\mathbf{C}'\\subset \\mathbf{C}\\) such that \\(\\bigvee\n\\mathbf{C}' \\leftrightarrow E\\) is also true in the actual world.\n\n\n(\\(\\bigvee \\mathbf{C}\\) designates some disjunction of the members of\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\).)\n\nThe underlying reason why \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) can be pruned from the\nleft side of\n (1)\n is that \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is sufficient for \\(C \\lor E\\), while the\nlatter is not sufficient for the former in the given scenario. Now, an\ninstantiation of \\(C \\lor E\\) makes a difference as to whether or not\n\\(B\\) is instantiated\u2014independently of \\(A \\land \\neg D\\). The\nconverse is not true: an instantiation of \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) makes a\ndifference as to whether or not \\(B\\) is instantiated, but not\nindependently of \\(C \\lor E\\) (see Baumgartner 2008: 340\u2013346 and\n2013: 90\u201396). This suggests the following requirement: a complex\nregularity for an effect must be a minimally necessary disjunction of\nminimally sufficient clusters for said effect. Indeed, given that each\neffect has at least two alternative causes, this seems to solve the\nproblem of joint effects of a common cause.\n\nBaumgartner (2013: 95) defines a cause on the type level as follows.\nRelative to a factor set containing \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), \\(C\\) is a\ntype-level cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is a factor of a minimally necessary disjunction of\nminimally sufficient clusters for \\(E\\), and\n(ii)\n\\(C\\) remains such a factor for any suitable expansion of the\nfactor set.\n\n\nA type-level cause is thus permanently non-redundant for its effect.\nHe then goes on to define a cause on the token level (for details, see\nBaumgartner 2013: 98). Relative to a factor set containing \\(C\\) and\n\\(E\\), an instance \\(c\\) of \\(C\\) is an actual cause of an instance\n\\(e\\) of \\(E\\) iff \\(C\\) is a type-level cause of \\(E\\), and, for all\nsuitable expansions of the factor set including the original factor\nset, \\(C\\) is on an active causal route to \\(E\\). An active causal\nroute is roughly a sequence of factors \\(\\langle Z_1, \\ldots , Z_n\n\\rangle\\), where each element \\(Z_i\\) is a factor of a minimally\nnecessary disjunction of minimally sufficient clusters for its\nsuccessor element \\(Z_{i+1}\\), and each \\(Z_i\\) is co-instantiated\nwith a set of factors \\(X_i\\) such that \\(Z_i \\land X_i\\) form a\nminimally sufficient cluster for \\(Z_{i+1}\\). This amounts to a quite\npowerful analysis of actual causation. It solves many scenarios which\nare troublesome for counterfactual accounts, including\noverdetermination, early and late preemption, and scenarios known as\n\u201cswitches\u201c, and \u201cshort-circuits\u201c. For a\ndetailed study of these scenarios and an explanation why they are\ntrouble for the counterfactual approach to causation, see Paul and\nHall (2013). Finally, it should be noted that Baumgartner\u2019s\nregularity theory faces a problem relating to what Baumgartner and\nFalk (forthcoming) call structural redundancies. The latter explain\nthis problem and offer a solution based on a causal uniqueness\nassumption.\n2. Inferential Theories of Causation\n\nInferential theories of causation are driven by the idea that causal\nrelations can be characterized by inferential relations. In essence,\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are actual events, and\n(ii)\n\\(E\\) can be inferred from \\(C\\) in the context of a suitable\nbackground theory using a suitable logic.\n\n\nInferential theories may be seen as refinements and generalizations of\nregularity theories. For example, one can explain INUS conditions in\nterms of relatively simple inferences between the presumed cause and\nthe putative effect. In this explanation, the distinctive feature of\nMackie\u2019s theory is explained by the logical form of the\nbackground theory. In a propositional setting, this background theory\nhas the logical form of a biconditional \n\n\\[(C_{1,1} \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge C_{1,n}) \\vee \\ldots \\vee (C_{k,1} \\wedge C_{k,m}) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nEach \\(C_{i,j}\\) that co-occurs with all conjuncts of one conjunction\non the left-hand side of this biconditional is at least an INUS\ncondition for the effect \\(E\\). Obviously, we can infer \\(E\\) from\nsuch a \\(C_{i,j}\\) in the context of the biconditional and the other\nconjuncts that form, together with \\(C_{i,j}\\), a sufficient condition\nfor \\(E\\). However, the exposition of the INUS account in Mackie\n(1965, 1974) is not explicitly inferential. Likewise, Hume\u2019s\noriginal regularity theory can be interpreted inferentially, but it is\nnot an explicitly logical or inferential account.\n\nWe understand the notion of an inference relation in a broad way. In\nessence, an inference relation maps sets of sentences to sets of\nsentences such that this mapping is guided by some idea of truth\npreservation: if all members of a given set of premises are true, then\nall sentences inferable from this set must be true as well. Moreover,\nthere are inference relations that are guided by a weaker requirement:\nif all members of a given set of premises are believed, then it is\nrational to believe a certain set of conclusions. Nonmononotonic\nlogics and formal theories of belief revision define inference\nrelations in this sense. We shall say more about such inference\nsystems in\n Section 2.2.\n Suffice it to say for now that an inference relation understood in\nour broad way may be defined syntactically in terms of relations of\nderivability, or semantically in terms of possible worlds and\nmodel-theoretic interpretations, or both ways.\n\nInferential theories seek to improve on regularity theories. Recall\nfrom\n Section 1.1\n that virtually all regularity theories face two problems of\nextension. First, in the case of singular causal relations, we have a\ncausal relation without regularity. Second, in the case of spurious\ncausation, we have a regularity that is not considered to be causal. A\nsophisticated inferential theory may allow us to infer singular\nevents, such as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima and the extinction\nof the dinosaurs, from a rich background theory and certain further\nhypotheses about presumed causes and the context of the presumed\ncausal process. At least some inferential theories hold the promise to\ndistinguish between spurious and genuine causal relations. The idea is\nthat genuine causal relations may be characterized by distinctive\ninferential relations, and so be distinguished from spurious causal\nrelations.\n2.1 Deductive Nomological Approaches\n\nInherent in the philosophy of logical empiricism, broadly construed,\nis a strong opposition to traditional metaphysics. Not surprisingly,\nmany of the logical empiricists were guided by Humean empiricist\nprinciples. Even some concepts of scientific language were suspected\nto be metaphysical in nature. Wittgenstein (1922: 5.136) held that\nbelief in a general law of causality is superstition. He also denied\nthat laws of nature could explain natural phenomena (6.371n). Frank\n(1932: Ch. V, IX) pointed out several difficulties in giving a precise\nformulation of a general law of causality. Russell (1913) argued that\nthe notion of cause is beset with confusion, and should better be\nexcluded from philosophical vocabulary.\n\nRamsey (1931) was less sceptical than Russell (1913) and Wittgenstein\n(1922) about the prospect of an analysis of causation. His account of\ncausation seems to be the logical empiricist analysis that comes\nclosest to Hume\u2019s original analysis. It is centred on the notion\nof a variable hypothetical. Such a hypothetical is a\nuniversally quantified implication that has instances whose truth or\nfalsity we are unable to verify for now. A case in point is the\nsentence saying that all humans are mortal. This sentence goes beyond\nour finite experience. For there is no way to conclusively establish\nthat all men\u2014past, present and future\u2014are mortal.\n\nTo believe a universal hypothetical consists in \u201ca general\nenunciation\u201d and \u201ca habit of singular belief\u201d\n(Ramsey 1931: 241). That is, we are willing to believe instances of\nthe universal sentence, even though we are not able to verify them at\nthe moment. Ramsey builds here Humean ideas about the formation of a\nhabit or custom into an informal semantics of universal sentences.\n\nRamsey\u2019s account, then, amounts to the following analysis. \\(C\\)\nis a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are actual,\n(ii)\nthe implication \\(C \\rightarrow E\\) follows from a variable\nhypothetical \\(\\forall x (\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\) and certain\nfacts \\(F\\),\n(iii)\nthe events described by \\(E\\) are not earlier than the events\ndescribed by \\(C\\) and \\(F\\),\n(iv)\n\\((C \\wedge F) \\rightarrow E\\) is an instance of \\(\\forall x\n(\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\), and\n(v)\n\\(\\forall x (\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\) is believed, or we are\nled to believe it in light of future observations (Ramsey 1931:\n249).\n\n\nCondition (i) remains implicit, but it would be confusing to omit it\nhere. Strictly speaking, condition (ii) is redundant since it follows\nfrom condition (iv).\n\nNote that a regularity by itself need not give rise to a variable\nhypothetical that we believe or are led to believe by future\nobservations. A case in point is the regular connection between the\nsound of the hooters at a factory in Manchester and the workers going\nhome at a factory in London (see\n \u00a71.3).\n Ramsey (1931: 242) literally speaks of trust in order to characterize\nour epistemic attitude towards causal laws. Ramsey\u2019s account of\nsuch laws, which supersedes his earlier best systems analysis, is\nexplicitly epistemic. However, Ramsey\u2019s account does not seem to\nhave the resources to address the problem of singular causal\nrelations. Under which causal law could we subsume the causal\nhypothesis that dinosaurs became extinct by a collision of the Earth\nwith a meteor?\n\nMore work on causation and explanation has been done within the\nlogical empiricist program. The deductive nomological model of\nexplanation by Hempel and Oppenheim (1948)\u2014also referred to as\nthe DN model of explanation\u2014seems to give us an exemplar of a\nconceptual analysis without metaphysics. Let us briefly recall the\nbasic elements of this model. The explanans of an empirical phenomenon\n\\(E\\) consists of two types of statements. First, a set \\(C\\) of\nantecedent conditions \\(C_1, \\ldots, C_k\\). Second, a set \\(L\\) of\nlaws \\(L_1, \\ldots, L_r\\). These two sets form the explanans,\nwhile \\(E\\) is called the explanandum. \\(C\\) and \\(L\\)\nexplain \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(E\\) is a logical consequence of the union of \\(C\\) and\n\\(L\\),\n(ii)\n\\(L\\) is non-empty (while \\(C\\) may be empty),\n(iii)\nthe explanans is testable, and\n(iv)\neach member of \\(C\\) and \\(L\\) is true.\n\n\nThe explanandum must thereby be subsumed under at least one law.\n\nWhile Hempel and Oppenheim were not primarily interested in an\nanalysis of causation, they thought that the DN model may yield such\nan analysis:\n\n\nThe type of explanation which has been considered here so far is often\nreferred to as causal explanation. If \\(E\\) describes a particular\nevent, then the antecedent circumstances described in the sentences\n\\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k\\) may be said jointly to \u201ccause\u201d\nthat event, in the sense that there are certain empirical\nregularities, expressed by the laws \\(L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_r\\), which\nimply that whenever conditions of the kind indicated by \\(C_1, C_2,\n\\ldots, C_k\\) occur, an event of the type described in \\(E\\) will take\nplace. Statements such as \\(L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_r\\), which assert\ngeneral and unexceptional connections between specified\ncharacteristics of events, are customarily called causal, or\ndeterministic, laws. (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948: 139)\n\n\nThis passage nicely indicates how inferential approaches to causation\nparallel regularity approaches. The regular connection between the\npresumed cause and the putative effect is expressed by certain laws.\nThe putative effect must be inferable from the presumed cause using\nthese laws if the former is an actual cause of the latter. Causation\nimplies that there are covering laws, according to which the cause is\nsufficient for its effect (cf. Pap 1952 and Davidson 1967, 1995). At\nthe same time, the above passage reveals logical empiricist scruples\nto talk about causation. Hempel and Oppenheim are hesitant to set\nforth the DN model as an analysis of causation and to say that the\nantecedent conditions of a DN explanation are causes of the\nexplanandum if the latter is a particular event.\n\nMore than a decade later than the first publication of the DN model,\nHempel (1965: 351n) suggested replacing the notion of cause by the\nnotion of antecedent conditions along the lines of the DN model.\nMoreover, he then distinguishes more carefully between laws of\nsuccession and laws of coexistence (1965: 352). Only the\nformer give rise to causal explanations. If a DN explanation is based\non laws of coexistence, this explanation does not qualify as causal. A\ncase in point is the law that connects the length of a pendulum with\nits period: \n\n\\[T=2 \\pi \\sqrt{l/g}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the period of the pendulum, \\(l\\) its length, and \\(g\\)\nthe gravitational acceleration nearby the surface of the Earth.\n\nArguably, even laws of succession do not always give rise to causal\nexplanations. Such laws do not only allow for predictions, but also\nfor retrodictions. That is, we can derive statements about events that\nare prior to events described by the antecedent conditions \\(C_1,\\)\n\\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_k\\) in a DN explanation. Hempel (1965: 353)\nhimself observed that Fermat\u2019s principle may be used in a DN\nexplanation of an event that precedes an event described by an\nantecedent condition.\n\nIn sum, there are at least two problems with a simple DN account of\ncausation. First, DN explanations using laws of coexistence do not\nseem to qualify as causal. Second, in some DN explanations, the\nexplanandum is an event that occurs prior to an event described in the\nantecedent conditions. In neither case, we view the antecedent\nconditions of the DN explanation as cause of the event to be\nexplained.\n\nThese observations anticipate later criticisms of the DN model, which\nare commonly referred to as symmetry problems. In the case of\nthe infamous tower-shadow example, most people have come to view only\nthe derivation of the length of the shadow as properly explanatory,\nbut not the derivation of the height of the tower (Bromberger 1966).\nHempel (1965: 353n) himself admits that causal DN explanations seem\n\u201cmore natural and plausible\u201d than non-causal ones.\nWoodward (2003) goes a step further by expounding a causal account of\nexplanation using causal models.\n\nWe must wonder why Hempel did not define that \\(C\\) is a cause of a\nparticular event \\(E\\) iff there is a DN explanation of \\(E\\) such\nthat \\(E\\) is the explanandum, \\(C\\) is among the antecedent\nconditions, all antecedent conditions precede the occurrence of \\(E\\),\nand all laws are laws of succession. Presumably, his interest in an\nanalysis of causation was limited.\n2.2 Ranking Functions\n\nSpohn (2006, 2012) expounds a broadly Humean analysis of causation.\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) occur,\n(ii)\n\\(C\\) precedes \\(E\\), and\n(iii)\n\\(C\\) \u201craises the metaphysical or epistemic status\u201d of\n\\(E\\), given the circumstances of the causal scenario (Spohn 2006:\n97).\n\n\n(iii) says that \\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\), given the circumstances.\nThis relation is analysed in terms of ranking functions. Spohn views\nthis analysis as an alternative to counterfactual approaches. At the\nend of this section, we will understand why the analysis qualifies as\nan inferential approach to causation.\n\nSpohn develops the ranking-theoretic analysis in two steps. First, he\nexplains what it is for a proposition to be a reason for another\nproposition. Second, causal relations are characterized as specific\ntypes of reason relations. Let us go a bit further into details. As\nregards notation, we follow Spohn (2006). The notation in Spohn (2012)\nis more refined, but slightly more complex as well.\n\nA ranking function represents a belief state. More specifically, a\nranking function \\(\\kappa\\) assigns each possible world a non-negative\nnatural number such that \\(\\kappa(w)=0\\) for at least one possible\nworld \\(w\\). Intuitively, the rank \\(\\kappa(w)\\) of a possible world\n\\(w\\) expresses a degree of disbelief. \\(\\kappa(w)=0\\) means that the\ndegree of disbelief is zero. \\(w\\) is not disbelieved in this case.\nOtherwise, it is disbelieved with rank \\(\\kappa(w)=n > 0\\). A\nranking function thus defines a Grovian system of spheres, used to\nrepresent AGM belief revision operators (Alchourr\u00f3n,\nG\u00e4rdenfors, & Makinson 1985; Grove 1988). A Grovian system of\nspheres is basically a set of nested sets. At the center of the system\nis its smallest member, a non-empty set of worlds. The smallest set is\nsurrounded by its supersets, as shown in\n Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nThe ranks 0, 1, 2, 3,\u2026 are understood as cardinal numbers. For\nexample, if world \\(w_1\\) has rank 5 and world \\(w_2\\) rank 10, then\n\\(w_2\\) is disbelieved to a degree twice as much as \\(w_1\\) is\ndisbelieved. Some ranks may even be empty in the sense that there is\nno world that has a specific rank \\(n\\). For example, ranks 3 and 4\nmay be without any possible worlds, while there are possible worlds at\nranks 0, 1, 2, and 5. The cardinal interpretation of the ranks is\nneeded for certain arithmetical operations, such as lifting the ranks\nby a certain cardinal number, applied to all possible worlds of a\ncertain subset. Because of the possibility of empty ranks, a Grovian\nsystem of spheres does not define a unique ranking function.\n\nAt each possible world, either a proposition or its negation is true.\nWe call a world at which a proposition \\(A\\) is true an \\(A\\)-world,\nand identify the proposition \\(A\\) with the set of \\(A\\)-worlds. The\nrank \\(\\kappa(A)\\) of a proposition \\(A\\) is the rank of those\npossible worlds \\(w\\) whose rank \\(\\kappa(w)\\) is minimal among the\n\\(A\\)-worlds. In\n Figure 3,\n the rank of \\(A\\) is thus \\(0\\) and the rank of \\(\\neg A\\) is \\(1\\).\nA proposition \\(A\\) is believed iff \\(\\kappa(\\neg A)>0\\).\n\nRanking functions cannot only be used to express degrees of disbelief,\nbut also to express degrees of belief. This is accomplished by the\nbelief function \\(\\beta\\). Where \\(A\\) is a proposition,\n\n\\[\\beta(A)= \\kappa(\\neg A) - \\kappa(A).\\]\n\n\nThat is, \\(\\beta(A)\\) is the difference between the minimal rank of\nthe \\(\\neg A\\)-worlds and the minimal rank of the \\(A\\)-worlds. For\nexample, if \\(\\kappa(\\neg A)\\) is rather high, we strongly believe\n\\(A\\). \\(\\beta(A)>0\\) means that \\(A\\) is believed to be true, and\n\\(\\beta(A)<0\\) that \\(A\\) is believed to be false. \\(\\beta(A)=0\\)\nmeans that \\(A\\) is neither believed nor disbelieved. In the latter\ncase, we have both \\(A\\)- and \\(\\neg A\\)-worlds whose rank is\nzero.\n\nWe are almost done with the core of ranking theory. It remains to\nexplain conditionalization. Conditionalization of a ranking\nfunction on a proposition represents the belief change upon coming to\nbelieve the proposition. The conditionalization of \\(\\kappa\\) on \\(A\\)\nis defined as follows: \n\n\\[\\kappa(w\\mid A)= \\kappa(w) - \\kappa(A)\\]\n\n\nfor all worlds \\(w\\) at which \\(A\\) is true, while \\(\\kappa(w\\mid A)=\n\\infty\\) for all worlds \\(w\\) where \\(A\\) is false. In less formal\nterms, if our agent comes to believe \\(A,\\) then the ranks of all\n\\(A\\)-worlds are lowered by the rank of \\(A\\). And the rank of all\n\\(\\neg A\\)-worlds is set to infinity, which means that she definitely\ndisbelieves those worlds. The conditionalization of a belief function\n\\(\\beta\\) is defined analogously: \n\n\\[\\beta(B\\mid A) = \\kappa(\\neg B \\: |\\: A) - \\kappa(B \\: |\\: A).\\]\n\n\nThese ranking-theoretic concepts at hand, Spohn defines what it is for\na proposition to be a reason for another proposition. \\(A\\) is a\nreason for \\(B\\) in the context \\(C\\)\u2014relative to\n\\(\\beta\\)\u2014iff \n\n\\[\\beta(B \\: |\\: A \\cap C) > \\beta(B \\: |\\: \\neg A \\cap C).\\]\n\n\nMoreover, he introduces subtle distinctions between an additional, a\nsufficient, a necessary, and a weak reason. These distinctions give\nrise to the notions of an additional, a sufficient, a necessary, and a\nweak cause. We leave out these subtleties for simplicity.\n\nNow that we know what a ranking-theoretic reason is, it remains to\nexplain which types of reasons are causes. In essence, \\(C\\) is a\ndirect cause of \\(E\\) at the possible world\n\\(w\\)\u2014relative to the belief function \\(\\beta\\)\u2014iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are true at \\(w\\),\n(ii)\nthe event expressed by \\(C\\) precedes the event expressed by\n\\(E\\), and\n(iii)\n\\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the context \\(K\\), which is given\nby the past of \\(E\\), excluding information about \\(C\\).\n\n\nSpohn thinks that we should understand causation relative to small\nworlds such that the context is given in a certain frame\nof possible events, but not by the global past of \\(E\\). Causation is\nthus doubly relative to an epistemic perspective. First, it is\nrelative to a belief function, and second to a frame of possible\nevents.\n\nA final step is needed to also capture non-direct causal relations.\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E,\\) possibly non-direct, iff the ordered pair\n\\((C,E)\\) is in the transitive closure of the relation of direct\ncausation. That is, \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff there is a sequence\n\\(\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E \\rangle\\) \\((n\\geq 0)\\) such that\neach element of the sequence is a direct cause of the successor (if\nthere is one).\n\nMost notably, the ranking-theoretic account of causation is able to\nsolve the problem of spurious causation, arising from common cause\nscenarios. The solution is quite subtle. Suppose \\(C\\) is a common\ncause of \\(E\\) and \\(F,\\) where \\(F\\) precedes \\(E\\). The crucial\nquestion then is whether or not \\(F\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the\ncontext \\(C\\). Spohn (2006: 106) argues that it is not. Recall that\n\\(F\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the context \\(C\\) iff \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F) > \\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F),\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F)=\\kappa(\\neg E\\mid C \\cap F) - \\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap F),\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F)=\\kappa(\\neg E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F) - \\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F).\\]\n\n\nSpohn determines the difference between the ranks \\(\\kappa(\\neg E \\mid\nC \\cap F)\\) and \\(\\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap F)\\) by the difference in the\nnumber of violations of causal regularities between the world where\n\\(\\neg E \\land C \\land F\\) is true and the world where \\(E \\land C\n\\land F\\) is true. In the former world, the causal regularity between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) is violated, while the causal regularity between \\(C\\)\nand \\(F\\) is respected. No causal regularity is violated in the world\nwhere \\(E \\land C \\land F\\) is true. Hence, \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F)=1.\\]\n\n\nAs for the calculation of \\(\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F),\\) we have two\nviolations of a causal regularity in the world of \\(\\neg E \\land C\n\\land \\neg F\\), but only one such violation in the world of \\(E \\land\nC \\land \\neg F\\). Hence, \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F)=1.\\]\n\n\nIt therefore holds that \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F) = \\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F).\\]\n\n\nHence, \\(F\\) is neither a reason nor a cause of \\(E\\). It is easy to\nshow that \\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\), as desired.\n\nSpohn (2006, 2012) considers a number of further causal scenarios, and\nso he offers ranking-theoretic solutions to the problems of\noverdetermination, trumping, and various scenarios of preemption. The\naccount of overdetermination parallels probabilistic accounts of this\ntype of causal scenario. Spohn does not explicitly address singular\ncausal relations that lack a corresponding regularity. But there might\nbe a way to argue that a collision of the Earth with a huge\nmeteor\u2014at the time when dinosaurs were roaming the\nEarth\u2014raises the ranks of those worlds where dinosaurs are\nalive. Such a raise amounts to believing that dinosaurs could have\ndied because of such a collision.\n\nWhy is Spohn\u2019s analysis of causation inferential? Recall that a\nranking function represents the epistemic state of an agent, which\nimplies that it determines which beliefs are held by the agent.\nMoreover, the conditionalization of a ranking function defines how\nsuch a function changes if the agent comes to believe a certain\nproposition. Hence, conditionalization defines an inference relation\nthat maps a set of propositions to a powerset of propositions. The\nintended meaning of this inference relation is that, if we come to\nbelieve a certain proposition, then it is rational to believe a set of\npropositions. In other words, proposition \\(B\\) is inferable from\nproposition \\(A\\) in the context of a ranking function \\(\\kappa\\) iff\n\\(\\beta(B\\mid A)>0\\), where \\(\\kappa\\) is underlying the belief\nfunction \\(\\beta\\). Put into symbolic notation: \n\n\\[A \\infd_\\kappa B \\;\\text{ iff }\\; \\beta(B\\mid A)>0.\\]\n\n\nThis notation is not used by Spohn (2012), but may be helpful to grasp\nthe inferential nature of Spohn\u2019s condition that a cause must be\na reason for its effect. Notice that \\(\\infd_\\kappa\\) is an\nenthymematic inference relation in the sense that certain premises are\nhidden in the background.\n\nThe inferential nature of the condition that a cause must be a\nranking-theoretic reason for its effect can also be seen from the\nfollowing two results. First, the conditionalization of a belief\nfunction \\(\\beta\\) defines a belief revision scheme (Spohn 1988). Such\na scheme tells us how a rational agent should change his or her\nbeliefs in light of new information (G\u00e4rdenfors 1988). Second,\nany belief revision scheme\u2014in the sense of the AGM theory by\nAlchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (1985)\u2014defines\na nonmonotonic and enthymematic inference relation (G\u00e4rdenfors\n1991). This result motivates the above definition of the inference\nrelation \\(A \\infd_\\kappa B\\).\n\nSpohn\u2019s theory of causation is first expounded in terms of\nranking functions which model the epistemic states of some agents.\nHowever, it should be noted that Spohn (2012: Ch. 14) aims to spell\nout the objective counterpart to ranking functions. He seeks to\nobjectify ranking functions by saying what it means that a\nranking function represents objective features of the world. The\nnotion of truth may serve as an introductory example. Given \\(w\\) is\nthe actual world, a ranking function \\(\\kappa\\) is an objective\nrepresentation of this world iff \\(\\beta(A)>0\\) for all\npropositions \\(A\\) such that \\(w\\in A\\). (Proposition \\(A\\) is\nconstrued as a set of possible worlds; \\(\\beta\\) is the belief\nfunction of \\(\\kappa\\), as defined above.) This explanation, however,\ndoes not yet capture modal and causal features of our world. And so\nSpohn goes on to explain how modal and causal properties\u2014defined\nby a given ranking function \\(\\kappa\\)\u2014can be understood as\nobjectives features of the world. The details are intricate and\ncomplex. They are spelled out in (2012: Ch. 15); the basic ideas are\nsummarized in Spohn (2018). Suffice it to say that Spohn\u2019s\nobjectification of ranking functions is not only a promising attempt\nfor an objective account of causation and modality, but also a way to\nresolve the tension between an epistemic and non-epistemic theory of\ncausation.\n2.3 Strengthened Ramsey Test\n\nDrawing on Spohn (2006), Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) analyse\ncausal relations in terms of certain reason relations. This is the\nbasic schema of the analysis: \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is a reason for believing \\(E\\), and\n(ii)\nthe ordered pair \\((C, E)\\) satisfies a few further\nconditions.\n\n\nAndreas and G\u00fcnther specify the first condition by a strengthened\nRamsey Test, which emerges from an analysis of the word\n\u201cbecause\u201d in natural language. Ramsey (1931) proposed to\nevaluate conditionals in terms of belief change. Roughly, you accept\n\u201cif \\(A\\) then \\(C\\)\u201d when you believe \\(C\\) upon\nsupposing \\(A\\). This Ramsey Test has been pointedly expressed by\nStalnaker:\n\n\nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent);\nfinally, consider whether or not the consequent is then true. (1968:\n102)\n\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988) expressed the Ramsey Test in more formal terms.\nWhere \\(K\\) denotes an agent\u2019s set of beliefs and \\(K \\ast A\\)\nthe operation of changing \\(K\\) on the supposition of \\(A,\\) \\(A >\nC \\in K\\) if and only if \\(C \\in K \\ast A.\\) In the wake of work by\nRott (1986), Andreas and G\u00fcnther suggest strengthening the Ramsey\nTest as follows:\n\n\n\\(A \\gg C\\) iff, after suspending judgment about \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), an\nagent can infer \\(C\\) from the supposition of \\(A\\) (in the context of\nfurther beliefs in the background). (2019: 1230)\n\n\nThis conditional is then used to give a simple analysis of the word\n\u201cbecause\u201d in natural language: \n\n\\[\\text{Because } A, C \\text{ (relative to }K)\\;\\;\\;\\text{ iff }\\;\\;\\;A \\gg C \\in K \\;\\;\\; \\text{ and }\\;\\;\\; A, C \\in K\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(K\\) designates the belief set of the agent. This analysis may\nwell be incomplete, but proves useful for analysing causation. The\nnext step toward such an analysis is to impose further constraints on\nthe inferential relations between the antecedent and the consequent.\nFor the expert reader, it may be worth noting that the conditional\n\\(\\gg\\) is defined in terms of finite belief bases rather than\nlogically closed sets. Inferential relations between antecedent and\nconsequent can therefore be defined syntactically in terms of\nderivability.\n\nHow may the conditional \\(\\gg\\) be used to analyse causation? Suppose\nthe antecedent \\(C\\) designates a presumed cause and the consequent\n\\(E\\) a putative effect. It is first required by Andreas and\nG\u00fcnther (2020) that we can infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in a\nforward-directed manner. That is, there is an inferential path between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) such that, for every inferential step, whenever we\ninfer the occurrence of an event, no premise asserts the occurrence of\nan event that is temporally later than the inferred event. This\ncondition is a refined and slightly modified variant of Hume\u2019s\nrequirement according to which a cause always precedes its effect.\n\nSecond, the inferential path between \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) must be such that\nevery intermediate conclusion is consistent with our beliefs about the\nactual world. The idea is that there must be an inferential path\nbetween the presumed cause and the putative effect that tells us how\nthe effect is brought about by the cause. This inferential\nrepresentation of how the effect is produced by the cause must be\nconsistent with what we believe the world is like.\n\nThird, every generalization\u2014used in the inferential path between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\)\u2014must be non-redundant in the following sense: it\nmust not be possible to derive the generalization from other explicit\nbeliefs. (A generalization is simply a universal sentence, which may\nrepresent a strict or non-strict law.) By means of this condition,\nAndreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) try to solve the problem of spurious\ncausation in common cause scenarios. Suppose there is a thunderstorm.\nThen, we have an electrical discharge that causes a flash which is\nfollowed by thunder. The flash precedes the thunder, and there is a\nregular connection between these two types of events. But we would not\nsay that the flash is a cause of the thunder. So, we need to\ndiscriminate between forward-directed inferences with a causal meaning\nand other forward-directed inferences that lack such a meaning. Note\nthat we can derive the event of the flash and the event of the thunder\nfrom the electrical discharge in a forward-directed manner using only\nnon-redundant generalizations, that is, universal sentences that we\nthink are relatively fundamental laws of nature. Among these are the\nlaws of electrodynamics, atomic and acoustic theory, and optics.\nHowever, the only inferential path from the flash to the thunder that\nis forward-directed requires redundant generalizations: universal\nsentences that we can derive from more fundamental laws (see Andreas\n2019 for details). The strategy is that spurious causal relations can\nbe excluded by requiring the generalizations used in the inferential\npath to be non-redundant. This strategy works in the mentioned common\ncause scenario. It remains to be seen whether this strategy works in\nfull generality.\n\nIn sum, \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\)\u2014relative to a belief\nstate\u2014iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are believed to be true,\n(ii)\nthe event of \\(C\\) precedes that of \\(E\\), and\n(iii)\nafter suspending judgement about \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), we can infer\n\\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in a forward-directed manner, without using redundant\ngeneralizations, and without inferring sentences that are inconsistent\nwith our beliefs.\n\n\nObviously, this analysis is epistemic, just as Hume\u2019s analysis\nof causation in the mind as well as Ramsey\u2019s and Spohn\u2019s\nanalyses are. Condition (ii) is needed because this condition is not\nimplied by the requirement that the inferential path between \\(C\\) and\n\\(E\\) is forward-directed. (Such an implication does not hold because,\nstrictly speaking, forward-directedness of the inferential path means\nthat no inferential step is backward-directed.) The problem of\ninstantaneous causation is addressed in Andreas (2019), at least for\nsome causal scenarios. Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) deliver\nrigorous solutions to a number of causal scenarios, including\noverdetermination, early and late preemption, switches, and some\nscenarios of prevention. Singular causal relations without a regular\nconnection among \\(C\\)-type and \\(E\\)-type events are not\naddressed.\n2.4 The Kairetic Account\n\nThe kairetic account by Strevens (2004, 2008) analyses causation in\nterms of causal models. It is driven by the idea that every causal\nclaim is grounded in a causal-explanatory claim. Causation and\nexplanation go hand in hand. Strevens uses the notion of a causal\nmodel to define a relation of entailment with a causal meaning. A set\nof propositions entail an explanandum \\(E\\) in a causal model only if\nthis entailment corresponds to a \u201creal causal process by which\n\\(E\\) is causally produced\u201d (Strevens 2004: 165). Causal models\nare assumed to be founded in physical facts about causal influence,\nand it is assumed that these facts \u201ccan be read off the true\ntheory of everything\u201d (Strevens 2004: 165).\n\nThe kairetic account parallels the DN account of causation in some\nrespects. The logical form of the explanans is basically the same as\nin the DN model. We have laws and propositions about events. A causal\nmodel is here simply a set of causal laws taken together with a set of\npropositions about potential causal factors. Unlike the DN account of\ncausation, the kairetic analysis uses causal notions in the analysans.\nMore specifically, the notion of entailment with a causal meaning is\ntaken as antecedently given. In the previous section, we have\nmentioned Andreas\u2019s (2019) attempt to further specify the\nrelation of logical entailment with a causal meaning using non-modal\nfirst-order logic, belief revision theory, and some further\nnon-logical concepts. This specification may be taken to supplement\nthe kairetic account.\n\nIn Strevens (2004), the kairetic account is essentially motivated by\nthree types of problems. First, causation by conditions that are most\nof the time but not always sufficient to produce a corresponding\neffect. Second, problems of preemption. Third, the problem of how\nfine-grained the description of a cause should be. Consideration of\nthese problems leads to a sophisticated and powerful analysis of\ncausation, which is based on the notion of an explanatory\nkernel for an event. Such a kernel contains laws and propositions\nabout events. Given the veridical causal model \\(M\\), the explanatory\nkernel for an event \\(E\\) is the causal model \\(K\\) such that (i)\n\\(M\\) entails \\(K\\), (ii) \\(K\\) entails \\(E\\), and (iii) \\(K\\)\noptimizes two further properties called generality and\ncohesion. Generality means that \\(K\\) encompasses as many\nphysical systems as can be. Cohesion is a measure for the degree to\nwhich potential causal factors are active in all systems satisfying\n\\(K\\) (Strevens 2004: 171). Eventually, Strevens defines \\(C\\) to be a\ncausal factor for \\(E\\) iff it is a member in some explanatory kernel\nfor \\(E\\). Causes, in the kairetic account, are difference-makers with\nrespect to the effect. If we were to take an actual cause out of an\nexplanatory kernel for \\(E\\), the remainder of the kernel would not\nproduce the putative effect \\(E\\).\n\nLet us try to understand why the description of the cause should be\nmaximally general. There are three reasons for this. First, this\nrequirement allows us to eliminate potential causal factors that do\nnot contribute to the causal production of the effect. A kernel \\(K\\)\nthat does mention such a factor\u2014in addition to the\n\u201cactive\u201d causal factors\u2014is less general than a\nkernel \\(K'\\) that mentions only the \u201cactive\u201d causal\nfactors. Hence, \\(K'\\) should be preferred over \\(K\\), other things\nbeing equal.\n\nPut simply, some elements of a veridical causal model are not involved\nin the production of the effect. Other elements are involved, but\ntheir influence can be neglected, provided the description of the\neffect is not overly fine-grained. For example, the gravitational\nforces of other planets may influence the trajectory of a rock thrown\nnearby the Earth\u2019s surface. But these forces do not make a\ndifference to whether or not the rock hits a fragile object. Hence,\nthe kernel should not contain such forces. More generally, a kernel\nfor \\(E\\) should not contain elements of \\(M\\) that are involved in\nthe production of \\(E\\) without actually making a difference to it.\nThis gives us a second reason for the requirement of generality.\n\nThese two reasons for optimizing generality are motivated by a\nconsideration of difference-making: each member of the kernel should\nmake a difference to the production of the effect. If some member of\nthe kernel is absent, the remainder of the kernel does not suffice to\nbring about the effect. Otherwise, it is not a proper kernel for the\neffect.\n\nThe third reason for optimizing generality of the kernel is a bit more\nintricate. Suppose a brick of four kilograms is thrown against a\nwindow such that the window shatters. Then, for this effect to be\nbrought about, it is often not necessary that the brick has a weight\nof exactly four kilograms. A brick that is slightly lighter and thrown\nwith the same velocity would also do. Nor does it have to be a brick,\nas we know from the rock-throwing examples. So it seems more accurate\nto say that the shattering of the window was caused by the fact or\nevent that a rigid, non-elastic, and sharp object was thrown against\nthe window in such a manner that the object\u2019s impact was within\na certain interval. The latter description is obviously more general\nthan the former in the sense that more physical systems satisfy it. In\nbrief, the kernel for \\(E\\) should not contain aspects of causally\nrelevant factors that do not make a difference to \\(E\\).\n\nThe requirement of cohesion is needed to exclude disjunctions of\ncausal factors from a kernel. Suppose \\(C_1\\) is a potential, but\ninactive causal factor, while \\(C_2\\) is active. That is, \\(C_2\\) is\nactually contributing to the causal production of \\(E\\), and \\(C_1\\)\nis not. Then neither \\(C_1\\) nor \\(C_1 \\vee C_2\\) should be part of\nthe kernel. We have just seen how \\(C_1\\) is excluded from the kernel\nby the requirement to maximize generality. \\(C_1 \\vee C_2\\) is\nexcluded by requiring that the kernel should be maximally cohesive.\nOther things being equal, kernels with \\(\\{C_1 \\vee C_2\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{C_1, C_1 \\vee C_2\\}\\) are less cohesive than the kernel containing\njust \\(\\{C_2\\}\\).\n\nStrevens (2008) is more comprehensive, and addresses a number of\nfurther topics, most of which are primarily concerned with the notion\nof an explanation. Notably, an account is offered for singular causal\nrelations without a corresponding regular connection between the\npresumed cause and the putative effect (Ch. 11).\n2.5 Causal Model Approaches\n\nIn his seminal book on causality, Pearl (2000) expounded a formal\nframework of causal models, which is centred on structural equations.\nA structural equation \n\n\\[v_i=f_i(pa_i, u_i),\\;\\; i=1, \\ldots, n\\]\n\n\ntells us that the values \\(pa_i\\) of certain parent variables\ndetermine the value \\(v_i\\) of a child variable according to a\nfunction \\(f_i\\) in the context of a valuation \\(u_i\\) of background\nvariables. At bottom, a causal model is a set of structural equations.\nEach equation stands for some causal law or mechanism. We can view\nthese equations as representing elementary causal dependencies. The\nnotion of a parent variable relies on causal graphs, which represent\nelementary causal relations by directed edges between nodes. Each node\nstands for a distinct variable of the causal model. Causal models have\nbeen used to study both deterministic and probabilistic causation.\n(For details, see the entry on\n causal models.)\n\nA distinctive feature of the semantics of structural equations is that\nit encodes some notion of asymmetric determination. The values of the\nparent variables determine the value of the child variable, but not\nthe other way around. Together with Halpern, Pearl devised several\ncounterfactual analyses of causation in the framework of causal\nmodels. These analyses incorporate elements of the inferential\napproach to causation. To be more precise, condition AC2(a) of the\noriginal and the updated Halpern-Pearl definition of actual causality\nis counterfactual, while AC2(b) is inferential. The latter condition\nrequires that a given effect must be a consequence of its cause for a\nrange of background conditions. (See Halpern (2016) for details.)\nNotably, the framework of causal models has also been used to develop\ninferential approaches to causation that work without a counterfactual\ncondition along the lines of Lewis (1973). We explain the basic\nconcepts of the accounts by Beckers and Vennekens (2018) and Bochman\n(2018).\n\nBeckers and Vennekens (2018) begin with explaining what it is for the\nvalue of a variable to determine the value of another\nvariable\u2014according to a structural equation\u2014in a context\n\\(L\\). This explanation gives us the notion of \\(C\\) being a direct\npossible contributing cause of \\(E\\). Such a direct possible\ncontributing cause is actual if \\(C\\), \\(E\\), and the context \\(L\\)\nare actual. For \\(C\\) to be an actual contributing cause of \\(E\\),\nthere must be a sequence \n\n\\[\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E\\rangle\\quad (n\\geq 1)\\]\n\n\nsuch that each element of the sequence is a direct actual contributing\ncause of its successor (if there is one). Finally, \\(C\\) is a cause of\n\\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is an actual contributing cause of \\(E\\),\n(ii)\nthe causal path between \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) satisfies a specific\ntemporal constraint, while\n(iii)\nthere would be no such path if \\(\\neg C\\) were realized instead of\n\\(C\\).\n\n\nThe temporal constraint basically requires that the events of the\nsequence \\(\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E\\rangle\\) are temporally\nordered, i.e., no element in the sequence occurs later than its\nsuccessor.\n\nBeckers and Vennekens (2018) deliver rigorous solutions to a number of\ncausal problems, including overdetermination, early and late\npreemption, switches, and some scenarios of prevention. The account is\nnon-reductive since structural equations represent elementary causal\ndependencies. The framework of causal models does not give us a\nfurther analysis of such dependencies. The benefit of this strategy is\nthat the problem of spurious causal relations in common cause\nscenarios does not arise in the first place. The problem of singular\ncausal relations is not explicitly addressed, but it allows for a\ntrivial solution in the framework of causal models. We can build a\ncausal model with a structural equation saying that a collision of the\nEarth with a huge meteor leads to the extinction of dinosaurs. A\nnon-trivial solution is as challenging as in the other inferential\napproaches. It seems very difficult to cite all the different causal\nlaws and background conditions that causally determine dinosaurs to\ndie.\n\nThe analysis by Beckers and Vennekens (2018) is inferential in spirit,\nbut not explicitly inferential in the sense that they define a logical\ninference system with structural equations. Bochman (2018) goes a step\nfurther in this respect. His analysis is centred on what computer\nscientists call a production inference relation. This\ninference relation is characterized by certain metalogical axioms,\nsuch as Strengthening (of the antecedent), Weakening (of the\nconsequent), Cut, and Or. To get some understanding of a production\ninference relation, it suffices to know that it can be reduced to a\nset of rules \n\n\\[A_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_k \\Rightarrow B_1 \\vee \\ldots \\vee B_n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_k\\) and \\(B_1, \\ldots, B_n\\) are propositional\nliterals, i.e., propositional atoms or negations thereof. Such a rule\nrepresents an elementary causal dependency in manner akin to a\nstructural equation. The symbol \\(\\Rightarrow\\) stands for some notion\nof asymmetric determination accordingly. Bochman (2018) shows how\nstructural equations using only binary variables may be translated\ninto a set of rules.\n\nIt seems as if we could now define \\(C\\) to be a cause of \\(E\\) iff we\ncan infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in the context \\(K\\). But things are more\ncomplicated. The challenge is that the inferential path between \\(C\\)\nand \\(E\\) must also represent some active causal path, i.e., a\nsequence of events such that each event actually caused its successor\n(if there is one). In other words, we need some notion of an\ninferential path that corresponds to a causal path in the actual\nsetting of events. Once such a notion is established, Bochman defines\n\\(C\\) to be a cause of \\(E\\) iff (i) we can infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in\nthe context \\(K\\), while (ii) we cannot infer \\(E\\) from the context\n\\(K\\) alone. The details of this inferential account are a bit\nintricate, and so we must refer the reader to Bochman (2018) to get a\nfull understanding. There, we can also find rigorous solutions to a\nnumber of causal problems, including overdetermination, early and late\npreemption, and some scenarios of prevention. It is worth noting,\nfinally, that Bochman presents his analysis as an inferential\nexplication of NESS conditions.\n3. Conclusion\n\nRegularity theories of causation have lost acceptance among\nphilosophers to a considerable extent. One reason is David\nLewis\u2019s (1973) influential attack on the regularity approach\nwhich concludes that its prospects are dark. And indeed, the problem\nof spurious causation\u2014to pick just one\u2014was severe for the\nregularity and inferential theories back then. Mackie\u2019s INUS\naccount and simple deductive-nomological accounts alike cannot\nproperly distinguish genuine from spurious causes, for example in\ncommon cause scenarios. In the meantime, however, regularity and\ninferential theories have been developed that offer at least tentative\nsolutions to the problem of spurious causation, for instance\nBaumgartner (2013), Spohn (2012), and Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020)\n(which are presented in\n \u00a71.4,\n \u00a72.2,\n \u00a72.3,\n respectively).\n\nAnother challenge is the direction of causation. David Lewis (1973,\n1979) thought that counterfactuals themselves yield an account of the\ndirection of causation. This account, however, turned out to be rather\ncontroversial and is rarely adopted (see, e.g., Frisch 2014: 204n). To\ndetermine the direction of causation, regularity and inferential\ntheories tend to rely on broadly Humean constraints on the temporal\norder between cause and effect. This move comes at the cost of\nexcluding backwards-in-time causation. We must wonder how severe this\nproblem is. So far, there is neither a commonly agreed understanding\nof the very idea of backwards causation nor actual empirical evidence\nfor it (cf. the entry on\n backwards causation).\n The direction of causation remains a point of controversy within\nregularity, inferential, and counterfactual approaches.\n\nTo conclude, the contemporary regularity and inferential theories have\nmade some remarkable progress. Valid criticisms have been largely\novercome and many causal scenarios\u2014which continue to be\nchallenging for counterfactual accounts of causation\u2014have been\nsolved. In particular, Baumgartner (2013), Beckers and Vennekens\n(2018), and Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) all solve the set of\nscenarios including overdetermination, early and late preemption, and\nswitches. In light of these recent developments, it should not be\nconsidered evident anymore that counterfactual theories of causation\nhave a clear edge over regularity and inferential theories.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["<li id=\"ref-Alchourron85\">Alchourr\u00f3n, Carlos E., Peter\nG\u00e4rdenfors, and David Makinson, 1985, \u201cOn the Logic of\nTheory Change: Partial Meet Contraction and Revision Functions\u201d,\n<em>Journal of Symbolic Logic</em>, 50(2): 510\u2013530.\ndoi:10.2307/2274239", "<li id=\"ref-Andreas19\">Andreas, Holger, 2019, \u201cExplanatory\nConditionals\u201d, <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 86(5):\n993\u20131004. doi:10.1086/705447", "<li id=\"ref-AG19\">Andreas, Holger and Mario G\u00fcnther, 2019,\n\u201cOn the Ramsey Test Analysis of \u2018Because\u2019\u201d,\n<em>Erkenntnis</em>, 84(6): 1229\u20131262.\ndoi:10.1007/s10670-018-0006-8", "<li id=\"ref-AG20\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020, \u201cCausation in\nTerms of Production\u201d, <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 177(6):\n1565\u20131591. doi:10.1007/s11098-019-01275-3", "<li id=\"ref-Baumgartner2008\">Baumgartner, Michael, 2008,\n\u201cRegularity Theories Reassessed\u201d, <em>Philosophia</em>,\n36(3): 327\u2013354. doi:10.1007/s11406-007-9114-4", "<li id=\"ref-Baumgartner13\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, \u201cA\nRegularity Theoretic Approach to Actual Causation\u201d,\n<em>Erkenntnis</em>, 78(S1): 85\u2013109.\ndoi:10.1007/s10670-013-9438-3", "<li id=\"ref-Baumgartner2019\">Baumgartner, Michael and Christoph Falk,\nforthcoming, \u201cBoolean Difference-Making: A Modern Regularity\nTheory of Causation\u201d, <em>The British Journal for the Philosophy\nof Science</em>, first online: December 2020.\ndoi:10.1093/bjps/axz047", "<li id=\"ref-BeckersVennekens2018\">Beckers, Sander and Joost Vennekens,\n2018, \u201cA Principled Approach to Defining Actual\nCausation\u201d, <em>Synthese</em>, 195(2): 835\u2013862.\ndoi:10.1007/s11229-016-1247-1", "<li id=\"ref-Beebee2006\">Beebee, Helen, 2006, <em>Hume on\nCausation</em>, London: Routledge. doi:10.4324/9780203966600", "Beebee, Helen, Christopher Hitchcock, and Peter Menzies (eds.),\n2009, <em>The Oxford Handbook of Causation</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press. doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279739.001.0001", "<li id=\"ref-Bochman2018\">Bochman, Alexander, 2018, \u201cActual\nCausality in a Logical Setting\u201d, in <em>Proceedings of the\nTwenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial\nIntelligence</em>, Stockholm, Sweden: International Joint Conferences\non Artificial Intelligence Organization, 1730\u20131736.\ndoi:10.24963/ijcai.2018/239", "<li id=\"ref-Bromberger66\">Bromberger, Sylvain, 1966,\n\u201cWhy-Questions\u201d, in <em>Mind and Cosmos: Essays in\nContemporary Science and Philosophy</em>, R.
