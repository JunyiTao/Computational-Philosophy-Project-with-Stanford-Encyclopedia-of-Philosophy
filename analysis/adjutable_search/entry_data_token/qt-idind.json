Introduction\n\n\nIt is typically held that chairs, trees, rocks, people and many of the\nso-called \u2018everyday\u2019 objects we encounter can be regarded\nas individuals. The issue, then, is how this individuality is to be\nunderstood, or what constitutes the \u2018principle\u2019 of\nindividuality. This is an issue which has a very long history in\nphilosophy. A number of approaches to it can be broadly delineated. \n\n\nWe might begin by noting that a tree and rock, say, can be\ndistinguished in terms of their different properties. We might\nthen go further and insist that this also forms the basis for ascribing\nindividuality to them. Even two apparently very similar\nobjects, such as two coins of the same denomination or so-called\nidentical twins, will display some differences in their\nproperties \u2013 a scratch here, a scar there, and so on. On this\naccount such differences are sufficient to both distinguish and\nindividuate the objects. This undergirds the so-called\n\u2018bundle\u2019 view of objects, according to which an object\nis nothing but a bundle of properties. In order to guarantee\nindividuation, no two objects can then be absolutely\nindistinguishable, or indiscernible, in the sense of\npossessing exactly the same set of properties. This last\nclaim has been expressed as the Principle of Identity of\nIndiscernibles and it ensures the individuality of the objects that\nfall under its scope; we shall return to it below.\n\n\nHowever, this approach has been criticised on the grounds (among\nothers) that we can surely conceive of two absolutely\nindistinguishable objects: thinking of Star Trek, we could imagine a\nreplicator device which precisely reproduces an object, such as a coin\nor even a person, giving two such objects exactly the same set of\nproperties. Not quite, one might respond, since these two objects do\nnot and indeed cannot exist at the same place at the same time; that\nis, they do not possess the same spatio-temporal properties. In terms\nof these properties, then, the objects can still be\ndistinguished and hence regarded as different individuals. Clearly,\nthen, this approach to the issue of individuality must be underpinned\nby the assumption that individual objects are\nimpenetrable.\n\n\nA more thorough-going criticism of this property based approach to\nindividuality insists that it conflates epistemological issues\nconcerning how we distinguish objects, with ontological issues\nconcerning the metaphysical basis of individuality. Thus, it is argued,\nto talk of distinguishability requires at least two objects but we can\nimagine a universe in which there exists only one. In such a situation,\nit is claimed, it would be inappropriate to say that the object is\ndistinguishable but not that it is an individual. Although we do not\nactually find ourselves in such situations, of course, still, it is\ninsisted, distinguishability and individuality should be kept\nconceptually distinct.\n\n\nIf this line of argument is accepted, then the principle of\nindividuality must be sought in something over and above the properties\nof an object. One candidate is the notion of substance, in which\nproperties are taken to inhere in some way. Locke famously described\nsubstance as a \u2018something, we know not what\u2019, since to\ndescribe it we would have to talk of its properties, but bare substance,\nby its very nature, has no properties itself.\n\n\nAlternatively, the individuality of an object has been expressed in\nterms of its \u2018haecceity\u2019 or \u2018primitive\nthisness\u2019 (Adams 1979). As the name suggests, this is taken to\nbe the primitive basis of individuality, which cannot be analysed\nfurther.  However, it has also been identified with the notion of\nself-identity, understood as a relational property (Adams\nibid.) and expressed more formally as\n\u2018a=a\u2019. Each individual is understood to\nbe identical to itself. This may seem like a form of the\nproperty-based approach we started with, but self-identity is a rather\npeculiar kind of property. As we\u2019ll see, denying that quantum objects\nare self-identical may be one way of capturing the idea that they are\nnon-individuals. \n\n\nThis is just a sketch of some of the various positions that have\nbeen adopted. There has been considerable debate over which of them\napplies to the everyday objects mentioned above. But at least it is\ngenerally agreed that such objects should be regarded as individuals to\nbegin with. What about the fundamental objects posited by current\nphysical theories, such as electrons, protons, neutrons etc.? Can these\nbe regarded as individuals? One response is that they cannot, since\nthey behave very differently in aggregates from \u2018classical\u2019\nindividuals.\n2. Quantum Non-Individuality\n\n\nThe argument for the above conclusion \u2013 that the fundamental\nobjects of physics cannot be regarded as individuals \u2013 can be\nsummed up as follows: First of all, both \u2018classical\u2019 and\n\u2018quantal\u2019 objects of the same kind (e.g. electrons) can be\nregarded as indistinguishable in the sense of possessing the same\nintrinsic properties, such as rest mass, charge, spin etc. Consider now\nthe distribution of two such indistinguishable particles over two\nboxes, or two states in general: \n\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\nFigure\n\n\n\nIn classical physics, (3) is given a weight of twice that of (1) or\n(2), corresponding to the two ways the former can be achieved by\npermuting the particles. This gives us four combinations or complexions\nin total and hence we can conclude that the probability of finding one\nparticle in each state, for example, is 1/2. (Note that it is assumed\nthat none of the four combinations is regarded as privileged in any\nway, so each is just as likely to occur.) This is an example of the\nwell-known \u2018Maxwell-Boltzmann\u2019 statistics to which, it is\nclaimed, thermodynamics was reduced at the turn of the twentieth century. \n\n\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, however, we have two\n\u2018standard\u2019 forms: one for which there are three possible\narrangements in the above situation (both particles in one box, both\nparticles in the other, and one in each box), giving\n\u2018Bose-Einstein\u2019 statistics; and one for which there is\nonly one arrangement (one particle in each box), giving\n\u2018Fermi-Dirac\u2019 statistics (which underpins the Pauli\nExclusion Principle and all that entails). Setting aside the\ndifferences between these two kinds of quantum statistics, the\nimportant point for the present discussion is that in the quantum\ncase, a permutation of the particles is not regarded as giving rise to\na new arrangement. This result lies at the very heart of quantum\nphysics; putting things slightly more formally, it is expressed by the\nso-called \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019:\nIf a particle permutation P is applied to any\nstate function for an assembly of particles, then there is no way of\ndistinguishing the resulting permuted state function from the original\nunpermuted one by means of any observation at any time.\n\n\n(The state function of quantum mechanics determines the probability of\nmeasurement results. Hence what the Indistinguishability Postulate\nexpresses is that a particle permutation does not lead to any\ndifference in the probabilities for measurement outcomes.) \n\n\nThe argument then continues as follows: that a permutation of the\nparticles is counted as giving a different arrangement in classical\nstatistical mechanics implies that, although they are\nindistinguishable, such particles can be regarded as individuals\n(indeed, Boltzmann himself made this explicit in the first axiom of\nhis \u2018Lectures on Mechanics\u2019, couched in terms of the\nimpenetrability assumption noted above). Since this individuality\nresides in something over and above the intrinsic properties of the\nparticles in terms of which they can be regarded as indistinguishable,\nit has been called \u2018Transcendental Individuality\u2019 by Post\n(1963).  This notion can be cashed out in various well-known ways, as\nindicated in the Introduction above: in terms of some kind of\nunderlying Lockean substance, for example, or in terms\nof primitive thisness. More generally, one might\napproach it in modal fashion, through the doctrine of haecceitism:\nthis asserts that two possible worlds may describe some individual in\nqualitatively the same way (that is, as possessing the same set of\nproperties), yet represent that individual differently by ascribing a\ndifferent haecceity or thisness in each world, or more generally, by\nascribing some non-qualitative aspect to the individual (Lewis 1986;\nHuggett 1999a).\n\n\nConversely, it is argued, if such permutations are not counted in\nquantum statistics, it follows that quantum objects cannot be\nregarded as individuals in any of these senses (Post 1963). In\nother words, they are very different from most everyday\nobjects in that they are \u2018non-individuals\u2019, in some\nsense.\n\n\nThis radical metaphysical conclusion can be traced back to the\nreflections of Born and Heisenberg themselves and was further\nelaborated in the very earliest discussions of the foundations of\nquantum physics. As Weyl put it in his classic text on group theory\nand quantum mechanics:\n\u2026 the possibility that one of the identical twins\nMike and Ike is in the quantum state E1 and the other in the quantum\nstate E2 does not include two differentiable cases which are permuted\non permuting Mike and Ike; it is impossible for either of these\nindividuals to retain his identity so that one of them will always be\nable to say \u2018I\u2019m Mike\u2019 and the other \u2018I\u2019m Ike.\u2019\nEven in principle one cannot demand an alibi of an electron! (Weyl\n1931)\n\n\nRecalling the discussion sketched in the Introduction, if we were to\ncreate a twin using some kind of Star trek replicator, say, then in the\nclassical domain such a twin could insist that \u2018I\u2019m here and\nshe\u2019s there\u2019 or, more generally, \u2018I\u2019m in this state and\nshe\u2019s in that one\u2019 and \u2018swapping us over makes a\ndifference\u2019. In the classical domain each (indistinguishable)\ntwin has a metaphysical \u2018alibi\u2019 grounded in their\nindividuality. Weyl\u2019s point is that in quantum mechanics, they do not. \n3. Quantum Individuality\n\n\nThis conclusion \u2013 that quantal objects are not individuals\n\u2013 is not the whole story, however. First of all, the contrast\nbetween classical and quantum physics with regard to individuality and\nnon-individuality is not as straightforward as it might seem. As\nalready indicated, the above account involving permutations of\nparticles in boxes appears to fit nicely with an understanding of\nindividuality in terms of Lockean substance or primitive thisness.\nHowever, one can give an alternative field-theoretic account in which\nparticles are represented as dichotomic \u2018Yes/No\u2019 fields:\nwith such a field, the field amplitude is simply \u2018Yes\u2019 at\nlocation x if the \u2018particle\u2019 is present at x\nand \u2018No\u2019 if it is not (Redhead 1983). On this account,\nindividuality is conferred via spatio-temporal location together with\nthe assumption of impenetrability mentioned in the Introduction. Thus\nthe above account of particle individuality in terms of either Lockean\nsubstance or primitive thisness is not necessary for classical\nstatistical mechanics. \n\n\nThe particles-and-boxes picture above corresponds to the physicists\u2019\nmultidimensional \u2018phase space\u2019, which describes which\nindividuals have which properties, whereas the field- theoretic\nrepresentation corresponds to \u2018distribution space\u2019, which\nsimply describes which properties are instantiated in what numbers.\nHuggett has pointed out that the former supports haecceitism, whereas\nthe latter does not and, furthermore, that the empirical evidence\nprovides no basis for choosing between these two spaces (Huggett 1999a).\nThus the claim that classical statistical mechanics is wedded to\nhaecceitism also becomes suspect.\n\n\nSecondly, the above argument from permutations can be considered from\na radically different perspective. In the classical case the\nsituations with one particle in each box are given a weight of\n\u20182\u2019 in the counting of possible arrangements. In the case\nof quantum statistics this situation is given a weight of\n\u20181\u2019. With this weighting, there are two possible\nstatistics, as we noted: Bose-Einstein, corresponding to a symmetric\nstate function for the assembly of particles and Fermi-Dirac,\ncorresponding to an anti-symmetric state function. Given the\nIndistinguishability Postulate, it can be shown that symmetric state\nfunctions will always remain symmetric and anti-symmetric always\nanti-symmetric. Thus, if the initial condition is imposed that the\nstate of the system is either symmetric or anti-symmetric, then only\none of the two possibilities \u2013 Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac\n\u2013 is ever available to the system, and this explains why the\nweighting assigned to \u2018one particle in each state\u2019 is half\nthe classical value. This gives us an alternative way of understanding\nthe difference between classical and quantum statistics, not in terms\nof the lack of individuality of the objects, but rather in terms of\nwhich states are accessible to them (French 1989). In other words, the\nimplication of the different \u2018counting\u2019 in quantum\nstatistics can be understood as not that the objects are\nnon-individuals in some sense, but that there are different sets of\nstates available to them, compared to the classical case. On this\nview, the objects can still be regarded as individuals, with the issue remaining as to how that individuality is to be cashed out.\n\n\nBoth of these perspectives raise interesting and distinct metaphysical issues (for\na useful introduction see Castellani 1998b).  Let us consider, first,\nthe objects-as-individuals \u2018package\u2019. How is the relevant\nnotion of individuality to be articulated? One option would be to take\none of the traditional lines and ground it some form of primitive thisness or\nLockean substance. However, this kind of metaphysics is anathema to\nmany of a naturalistic persuasion, not least because it lies beyond\nthe physical pale, as it were. Alternatively, one might take\nindividuality to be primitive but then assuage any naturalistic\ntendencies by tying it to the idea of \u2018countability\u2019\n\u2013 in the sense that we can always count how many quantum objects\nare in a given state \u2013 and take the latter to be both physically\nsignificant and capable of being \u2018read off\u2019 from the\ntheory (Dorato and Morganti 2013). Nevertheless, it may be felt that\nnaturalism is better satisfied by eschewing such primitivist moves and\ntaking the individuality of the objects to be reducible to their\ndiscernibility and ground the latter in their properties, as presented\nby the theory (a feeling that may be further supported by doubts as to\nthe physical plausibility of possible worlds containing only one\nobject, as mentioned above). Of course, for this to work, we need some\nassurance that no two objects are indiscernible (or indistinguishable)\nin the relevant sense. Traditionally this assurance has been provided\nby Leibniz\u2019s famous Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, so\nlet us consider the status of this Principle in the context of modern\nphysics.\n4. Quantum Physics and the Identity of Indiscernibles\n\n\nNow, of course, both quantum and classical objects of the same kind\n\u2013 such as electrons, say \u2013 are indistinguishable in the\nsense that they possess all intrinsic properties \u2013 charge, spin,\nrest mass etc. \u2013 in common. However, quantum objects are\nindistinguishable in a much stronger sense in that it is not just that\ntwo or more electrons possess the same intrinsic properties but that\n\u2013 on the standard understanding \u2013 no measurement\nwhatsoever could in principle determine which one is which. If the\nnon-intrinsic, state-dependent properties are identified with all the\nmonadic or relational properties which can be expressed in terms of\nphysical magnitudes standardly associated with self-adjoint operators\nthat can be defined for the objects, then it can be shown that two\nbosons or two fermions in a joint symmetric or anti-symmetric state\nrespectively have the same monadic properties and the same relational\nproperties one to another (French and Redhead 1988; see also\nButterfield 1993). This has immediate implications for the Principle\nof the Identity of Indiscernibles which, expressed crudely, insists\nthat two things which are indiscernible, must be, in fact,\nidentical. \n\n\nSetting aside the historical issue of Leibniz\u2019s own attitude towards\nhis Principle (see, for example, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2014),\nsupporters of it have tended to retreat from the claim that it is\nnecessary and have adopted the alternative view that it is at least contingently true (in the\nface of apparent counter-examples such as possible worlds containing\njust two indistinguishable spheres).  There is the further issue as to\nhow the Principle should be characterised and, in particular, there is\nthe question of what properties are to be included within the scope of\nthose relevant to judgments of indiscernibility. Excluding the\nproperty of self-identity (which, again, we\u2019ll come back to below),\nthree forms of the Principle can be broadly distinguished according to\nthe properties involved: the weakest form, PII(1), states that it is\nnot possible for two individuals to possess all properties and\nrelations in common; the next strongest, PII(2), excludes\nspatio-temporal properties from this description; and the strongest\nform, PII(3), includes only monadic, non-relational properties. Thus,\nfor example, PII(3) is the claim that no two individuals can possess\nall the same monadic properties (a strong claim indeed, although it is\none way of understanding Leibniz\u2019s own view).\n\n\nIn fact, PII(2) and PII(3) are clearly violated in classical\nphysics, where distinct particles of the same kind are typically\nregarded as indistinguishable in the sense of possessing all intrinsic\nproperties in common and such properties are regarded as non-relational\nin general and non-spatio-temporal in particular. (Of course, Leibniz\nhimself would not have been perturbed by this result, since he took the\nPrinciple of Identity of Indiscernibles to ultimately apply only to\n\u2018monads\u2019, which were the fundamental entities of his\nontology. Physical objects such as particles were regarded by him as\nmerely \u2018well founded phenomena\u2019.) However, PII(1) is not\nviolated classically, since classical statistical mechanics typically\nassumes that such particles are impenetrable, in precisely the sense\nthat their spatio-temporal trajectories cannot overlap. Hence they can\nbe individuated via their spatio-temporal properties, as indicated\nabove.\n\n\nThe situation appears to be very different in quantum mechanics,\nhowever. If the particles are taken to possess both their intrinsic\nand state-dependent properties in common, as suggested above, then\nthere is a sense in which even the weakest form of the Principle,\nPII(1), fails (Cortes 1976; Teller 1983; French and Redhead 1988; for\nan alternative view, see van Fraassen 1985 and 1991). On this\nunderstanding, the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is actually\nfalse. Hence it cannot be used to effectively guarantee individuation\nvia the state-dependent properties by analogy with the classical\ncase. If one wishes to maintain that quantum particles are\nindividuals, then their individuality will have to be taken as\nconferred by Lockean substance, primitive thisness or, in general,\nsome form of non-qualitative haecceistic difference.\n\n\nHowever, this conclusion has been challenged. First of all, it has been\nquestioned whether quantum particles can be said to possess the\nrelevant state-dependent properties in the sense that would be\ndamaging to PII (Massimi 2001; see also Mittelstaedt and Castellani 2000). However, this argument only applies to monadic,\nstate-dependent properties and so the above conclusion still holds for\nPII(2) and PII(3). In effect, what has been shown is that those\nversions of PII which allow relations to individuate are not the\nweakest forms of the Principle, but the only forms which are\napplicable.\n\n\nThis shift to relations as individuating elements has led to the development of a form\nof PII, based on Quine\u2019s suggestions about discernibility, which\nallows objects to be \u2018weakly\u2019 discernible in relational\nterms (Saunders 2003a and 2006; for a useful overview see Bigaj\n2015a). Consider for example, two fermions in a spherically-symmetric\nsinglet state. The fermions are not only indistinguishable in the\nabove sense but also possess exactly the same set of spatio-temporal\nproperties and relations. However, each enters into the symmetric but\nirreflexive relation of \u2018having opposite direction of each\ncomponent of spin to \u2026\u2019 on the basis of which they can be\nsaid to be \u2018weakly discernible\u2019 (for general discussions of different\nkinds of discernibility see Caulton and Butterfield 2012a; Bigaj 2014;\nKetland 2011; Ladyman, Linnebo and Pettigrew 2012). If we extend PII\nto incorporate such relations, the Principle can, it seems, be made\ncompatible with quantum physics and the individuality of the fermions\ncan be grounded in these irreflexive relations, without having to\nappeal to anything like primitive thisness. This result has also been\nextended to bosons (Muller and Saunders 2008; Muller and Seevinck\n2009), although some of the details are contentious, in particular\nwith regard to the interpretation of some of the mathematical features\nthat are appealed to in this account (see Bigaj 2015a and 2015b; Caulton 2013; Huggett and Norton 2014; Norton 2015). In addition to such technical issues, there is the\nfurther philosophical concern that the appeal to irreflexive relations\nin order to ground the individuality of the objects which bear such\nrelations involves a circularity: in order to appeal to such\nrelations, one has had to already individuate the particles which are\nso related and the numerical diversity of the particles has been\npresupposed by the relation which hence cannot account for it (see\nFrench and Krause 2006; Hawley 2006 and 2009). One response to this\nworry would be to question the underlying assumption that relata must\nhave the relevant ontological priority over relations and adopt some\nform of structuralist view of objects according to which the relata\nare eliminable in terms of relations (perhaps \u2018emerging\u2019, in some\nsense as \u2018intersections\u2019 of them) or, more mildly perhaps,\nargue that neither are accorded priority but come as a\n\u2018package\u2019 as it were (for further discussion see French\n2014). It has been suggested, for example, that this whole discussion\nof weak discernibility reveals a category of entity that has received\nlittle attention so far, namely that of \u2018relationals\u2019: objects that\ncan be discerned by means of relations only (Muller 2011, 2015). I\nshall return to the structuralist perspective below (but for an alternative, \u2018coherentist\u2019 account, see Calosi and Morganti 2018). More generally,\nhowever, it has been argued that this whole debate is orthogonal to\nthat over the status of PII since what weak discernibility grounds is\nmerely numerical distinctness, rather than the robust sense of\ndiscernibility that PII was originally concerned with (Ladyman and\nBigaj 2010). The latter involves some sense of difference over and\nabove numerical distinctness but weakly discernible relations such as\n\u2018having opposite direction of each component of spin to\n\u2026\u2019 do not provide this. Hence, it is claimed, PII remains\nviolated by quantum mechanics (although see Friebe 2014 where the principle is defended in the context of a specific understanding of quantum entanglement). \n\n\nThe above considerations are typically presented within the\n\u2018orthodox\u2019 interpretation of quantum mechanics but there\nare a further set of responses which step outside of this. Thus van\nFraassen, for example (van Fraassen 1985 and 1991) has advocated a\nform of \u2018modal\u2019 interpretation, in the context of which\n(standard) PII can be retained. At the core of this approach lies a\ndistinction between two kinds of state: the \u2018value\u2019 state,\nwhich is specified by stating which observables have values and what\nthey are; and the \u2018dynamic\u2019 state, which is specified by\nstating how the system will develop both if isolated and if acted upon\nin some definite fashion. The evolution of the latter is\ndeterministic, in accordance with Schroedinger\u2019s equation, but\nthe value state changes unpredictably, within the limits set by the\ndynamic state (for criticism see some of the papers in Dieks and\nVermaas 1998). Because the actual values of observables do not\nincrease predictive power if added to the relevant dynamic state\ndescription, they are deemed to be \u2018empirically\nsuperfluous\u2019. In the case of fermions, at least, distinct value\nstates can be assigned to each particle and PII saved.\n \n\nHowever concerns have been raised over the objectivity of such value\nstate attributions (Massimi op. cit., p. 318, fn. 11) and one might\nregard the associated \u2018empirically superfluous\u2019 properties\nas merely conceptual. This bears again on the important issue of what kinds\nof properties may be admitted to lie within the scope of the\nPrinciple. Clearly some would appear to be beyond the pale: saving PII\nby regarding the particle labels themselves as intrinsic properties is\nsurely unacceptable. Furthermore, bosons must be treated differently,\nsince they can have the same dynamic and value states. In this case,\nvan Fraassen suggests that each boson is individuated by its history,\nwhere this is again to be understood as \u2018empirically\nsuperfluous\u2019. Of course, it might seem odd that an approach\nwhich originally sought to avoid the grounding of the individuality of\nobjects in something like Lockean substance should find itself having\nto include empirically superfluous factors within the scope of\nPII.\n\n\nAnother \u2018unorthodox\u2019 approach incorporates the Bohmian\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and in particular it has been\nsuggested that it might form the basis of an alternative conception of\nparticle individuality in terms of their spatio-temporal\ntrajectories. As is well known, attributing distinguishing\nspatio-temporal trajectories to quantum objects faces acute\ndifficulties under the orthodox interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. On the Bohm interpretation, however, they are allowed;\nindeed, the only observable admitted is that of position. What this\ninterpretation gives us is a dual ontology of point particles plus\n`pilot\u2019 wave, where the role of the latter is to determine the\ninstantaneous velocities of the former through the so-called\n\u2018guidance equations\u2019. These \u2018complete\u2019 the standard\nformulation of quantum mechanics so that, in addition to the quantum\nstate, whose development is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nthere is also a set of single-particle trajectories, each of which is\ndetermined by the guidance equation, plus the initial positions of the\nparticles (for a review see Cushing et al. 1996). Such an\ninterpretation appears to provide a natural home for the metaphysical\npackage which takes quantum objects to be individuals (see, for\nexample, Brown et al. 1999) and, indeed, a form of PII(1) can\nnow be defended against the above conclusion.\n\n\nNevertheless, things are not quite as straightforward as they might\nseem: it has been argued that intrinsic properties cannot be\nconsidered as possessed solely by the objects but in some sense must\nbe assigned to the pilot wave as well (Brown et al.1994). Thus, again, there is an\nontological cost involved in retaining this view of objects as\nindividuals.\n\n\nWhat if one were to consider the evolution of the system concerned in\nthe multi-dimensional \u2018configuration space\u2019 in terms of which\nthe wave function must be described? Here the implications of\nconsidering particle permutations are encoded in the topology of such\na space by identifying points corresponding to such a permutation and\nthereby constructing what is known as the \u2018reduced configuration\nspace\u2019 formed by the action of the permutation group on the full\nconfiguration space. As in the case of \u2018ordinary\u2019 space-time,\nsome form of \u2018impenetrability assumption\u2019 must be adopted to\nensure that \u2013 in the case of those particles that are not bosons at\nleast \u2013 no two particles occupy the same point of this reduced\nspace.Here Bohmian\nmechanics offers some advantage: it turns out that the guidance equations\nensure the non-coincidence of the relevant particle trajectories\n(Brown et al. 1999). In effect \u2018impenetrability\u2019\nis built into the dynamics and thus the configuration space approach\nand de Broglie-Bohm interpretation fit nicely together.\n\n\nReturning to the core point, one can maintain that quantum objects are\nindividuals, even granted the implications of quantum statistics. And\none can either take that individuality to be ungrounded and\n\u2018primitive\u2019 or ground it in some form of primitive thisness or, more\nplausibly for many, in the associated properties via an updated and\nextended form of PII (criticisms and concerns\nnotwithstanding). However, there is also the alternative, articulated\nduring the throes of the quantum revolution itself, as noted above,\nwhich is to take quantum objects to be non-individuals in some\nsense. Of course, if this alternative metaphysical \u2018package\u2019 is\nadopted then Leibniz\u2019s Principle simply does not apply. But now the\nobvious question arises: what sense can we make of this notion of\n\u2018non-individuality\u2019?\n5. Non-individuality and self-identity\n\n\nLet us recall Weyl\u2019s statement that one can\u2019t ask alibis\nof electrons.  Dalla Chiara and Toraldo di Francia refer to quantum\nphysics as \u2018the land of anonymity\u2019, in the sense that, on\nthis view, the objects cannot be uniquely labelled (1993 and 1995). They ask,\nthen, how can we talk about what happens in such a land? Their\nsuggestion is that quantum objects can be regarded as\n\u2018intensional-like entities\u2019, where the intensions are\nrepresented by conjunctions of intrinsic properties. The extension of\nthe natural kind, \u2018electron\u2019, say, is then given by the\ncollection of indistinguishable elements, or a\n\u2018quaset\u2019. The theory of such quasets then gives the possibility of a\nsemantics for quantum objects without alibis (ibid.).\n\n\nAlternatively, but relatedly, non-individuality can be understood in\nterms of the denial of self-identity. This suggestion can be found most\nprominently in the philosophical reflections of Born,\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Hesse and Post (Born 1943; Schr\u00f6dinger 1952;\nHesse 1963; Post 1963). It is immediately and clearly problematic,\nhowever: how can we have objects that are not identical to themselves? Such\nself-identity seems bound up with the very notion of objecthood in the\nsense that it is an essential part of what it is to be that object (thus it has been suggested that non-individuality might be better understood in terms of the loss of patio-temporal trajectories in quantum physics; see Arenhart, Bueno and Krause 2019). This\nintuition is summed up in the Quinean slogan, \u2018no entity without\nidentity\u2019 (Quine 1969), with all its attendant consequences\nregarding reference etc.\n\n\nHowever, Barcan Marcus has offered an alternative perspective,\ninsisting on \u2018No identity without entity.\u2019 (Marcus 1993)\nand arguing that although \u2018\u2026 all terms may\n\u201crefer\u201d to objects\u2026 not all objects are things,\nwhere a thing is at least that about which it is appropriate to assert\nthe identity relation.\u2019 (ibid., p. 25) Object-reference\nthen becomes a wider notion than thing-reference. Within such a\nframework, we can then begin to get a formal grip on the notion of\nobjects which are not self-identical through so-called\n\u2018Schr\u00f6dinger logics\u2019, introduced by da Costa (da\nCosta and Krause 1994) These are many-sorted logics in which the\nexpression x = y is not a well-formed formula in\ngeneral; it is where x and y are one sort of term, but\nnot for the other sort corresponding to quantum objects. A semantics\nfor such logics can be given in terms of \u2018quasi-sets\u2019 (da\nCosta and Krause 1997). The motivation behind such developments is the\nidea that collections of quantum objects cannot be considered as sets\nin the usual Cantorian sense of \u2018\u2026 collections into a\nwhole of definite, distinct objects of our intuition or of our\nthought.\u2019 (Cantor 1955, p. 85). Quasi-set theory incorporates\ntwo kinds of basic posits or \u2018Urelemente\u2019: m-atoms, whose\nintended interpretation are the quantal objects and M-atoms, which\nstand for the \u2018everyday\u2019 objects, and which fall within\nthe remit of classical set theory with Ur-elements. Quasi-sets are\nthen the collections obtained by applying the usual Zermelo-Fraenkel\nframework plus Ur-element ZFU-like axioms to a basic domain composed\nof m-atoms, M-atoms and aggregates of them (Krause 1992; for a\ncomparison of qua-set theory with quasi-set theory, see Dalla Chiara,\nGiuntini and Krause 1998).\n\n\nThese developments supply the beginnings of a categorial framework for\nquantum \u2018non- individuality\u2019 which, it is claimed, helps\nto articulate this notion and, bluntly, make it philosophically\nrespectable (extensive details are given in French and Krause 2006;\nsee also Arenhart 2012; Domenach and Holik 2007; Domenach, Holik and\nKrause, 2008; Krause 2010). Crucially, within\nthis formal framework, a sense of countability is retained in that\ncollections of quantum entities possess a (kind of) cardinality but\nnot an ordinality, so we can, in effect, say how many objects there\nare, even though we cannot place them in numerical order.  Critical\ndiscussions of both these formal details and of the basis for\nattributing \u2018non-individuality\u2019 to quantum objects can be\nfound in Bueno et. al. 2011 and Sant\u2019 Anna 2019. Much of this criticism has proceeded on\nthe basis of insisting that we do not need to adopt such an apparently\nradical approach. Thus advocates of \u2018weak discernibility\u2019, discussed\nabove, have argued that this notion yields an appropriately naturalist sense\nof individuality, suitable for quantum physics, whereas Dorato and\nMorganti (2013) insist, as already noted, that one can retain\ncountability, and individuality, as primitive notions and that this is\nto be preferred over any shift to non-individuality (for a response to\nthe latter and defence of the above formal framework, see Arenhart and\nKrause 2014). Jantzen on the other hand, has argued that identity and cardinality are tied together as a \u2018matter of meaning\u2019 rather than metaphysics and that, consequently, talk of entities without identity is either meaningless or, in fact, talk about something else altogether (Jantzen 2019). Likewise Bueno has insisted that identity is too fundamental to be given up so readily and suggests that we can infer\nthe non-individuality of quantum particles directly from their\nindistinguishability with identity itself understood as a \u2018useful idealization\u2019 that simplifies our conceptual framework and allows us to predict the behaviour of the relevant objects \u2013 in this case quantal entities (Bueno 2014; for responses see Arenhart 2017a and Krause and Arenhart 2019). \n\nBoth the framework of quasi-set theory and the underlying metaphysics\nhave been extended into the foundations of Quantum Field Theory, where\nit has been argued, one has non-individual \u2018quanta\u2019\n(Teller 1995). A form of quasi-set theory may provide one way of\nformally capturing this notion (French and Krause 2006; for concerns about such a move see Sant\u2019 Anna 2019). It has also\nbeen suggested that this offers a way of understanding the sense in\nwhich quantum objects may be regarded as vague (French and Krause\n2003), although it has been questioned whether vagueness is the\nappropriate notion here (Darby 2010) and also whether quasi-set theory\noffers the most perspicuous way of capturing this sense (Smith\n2008).  Finally, for those who are leery of quasi-sets and their attendant formal apparatus, there is also the option of returning to Weyl\u2019s original insight, which underpins the quote above, and appropriating his idea of an \u2018aggregate\u2019. If this is interpreted non-set-theoretically as an equivalence relation, where the relevant elements are understood as simply objects that have certain properties in common, one can continue to maintain that such objects do not have well-defined identity conditions (Bueno 2019). Indeed, there may be a variety of such frameworks, both formal and metaphysical, in terms of which non-individuality may be understood (Arenhart 2017b). \n6. Metaphysical Underdetermination\n\n\nWe now appear to have an interesting situation. Quantum mechanics is\ncompatible with two distinct metaphysical \u2018packages\u2019, one\nin which the objects are regarded as individuals and one in which they\nare not. Thus, we have a form of \u2018underdetermination\u2019 of\nthe metaphysics by the physics (see van Fraassen 1985 and 1991; French\n1989; Huggett 1997). This has implications for the broader issue of\nrealism within the philosophy of science. If asked to spell out her\nbeliefs, the realist will point to currently accepted fundamental\nphysics, such as quantum mechanics, and insist that the world is, at\nleast approximately, however the physics says it is. Of course, there\nare the well-known problems of ontological change (giving rise to the\nso-called Pessimistic Meta-Induction) and Underdetermination of\nTheories by the Empirical data. However, this underdetermination of\nmetaphysical packages seems to pose an even more fundamental problem,\nas the physics involved is well entrenched and the difference in the\nmetaphysics seemingly as wide as it could be. These packages support\ndramatically different world-views: one in which quantum objects, such\nas electrons, quarks and so forth, are individuals and one in which\nthey are not. The realist must then face the question: which package\ncorresponds to the world? \n One option would be to refuse to answer and insist that all the\nrealist is required to do is to state how the world is, according to\nour best theories; that is, to articulate her realism in terms of\nelectrons, quarks etc. and what physics tells us about them and no\nmore, metaphysically speaking. This might be called a\n\u2018shallow\u2019 form of realism (Magnus 2012) and it raises the\nobvious worry that the content of such shallow realism amounts to no\nmore than a recitation of the relevant physical content of our best\ntheories, with no consideration of whether that content is concerned\nwith objects or not, and whether the former are individuals or\nnot. \n\n\nAt the other extreme, one might be tempted to give up realism\naltogether and adopt an anti-realist stance. Thus the constructive\nempiricist, taking realism to be metaphysically informed, and hence\n\u2018deep\u2019 rather than \u2018shallow\u2019, draws as the\nlesson from this underdetermination, \u2018so much for\nmetaphysics\u2019 and realism along with it. Since on this view, all\nthat theories can tell us is how the world could be, the\ndifferent metaphysical packages of objects-as-individuals and as\nnon-individuals simply amount to different ways of spelling that out\n(van Fraassen 1991). \n\nIn between these extremes are various options for handling the\nunderdetermination, corresponding to different levels of \u2018deep\u2019\nrealism. Thus one might try to argue that the underdetermination can\nbe \u2018broken\u2019 in some way. One might, for\nexample, appeal to some metaphysical factor or other in support of one\npackage over the other, or shift to meta-metaphysical considerations\nin order to argue, for example, that individuality based on weak\ndiscernibility has certain advantages over rival accounts and also\nover non-individuality, with its attendant non-standard formal\nunderpinning. However Arenhart argues that weak discernibility generates further metaphysical underdetermination and hence cannot support a fully naturalistic understanding of quantum mechanics as some of its advocates have claimed (Arenhart 2017b). Alternatively, of course, one could argue the other way\nand insist that the non-individuality package avoids having to choose between different\nmetaphysical accounts of individuality, at least, and that the formal\nshift to quasi-set theory is not as dramatic as might be\nthought. Ultimately, however, its not at all clear what weight should\nbe given to the various factors involved or even if a coherent\nweighting scheme can be applied in the first place.\n\nInstead one might appeal to broadly methodological factors to break\nthe underdetermination. Thus it has been argued that the package of\nobjects-as-non-individuals meshes better with quantum field theory\n(QFT) where, it is claimed, talk of individuals is avoided from the\nword go (Post 1963; Redhead and Teller 1991 and 1992; Teller\n1995). The central argument for this claim focuses on the core\nunderstanding that objects may indeed be regarded as individuals in\nquantum physics but as such are subject to restrictions on the sets of\nstates they may occupy. The states that are inaccessible to the\nparticles of a particular kind, such as electrons say, can be taken as\ncorresponding to just so much \u2018surplus structure\u2019. In\nparticular, if the view of particles as individuals is adopted, then\nit is entirely mysterious as to why a particular sub-set of these\ninaccessible, surplus states, namely those that are non-symmetric, are\nnot actually realised.  Applying the general methodological principle\nthat a theory which does not contain such surplus structure is to be\npreferred over one that does, Redhead and Teller conclude that we have\ngrounds for preferring the non-individuals package and the mystery of\nthe inaccessible states simply does not arise (Redhead and Teller 1991\nand 1992).\n\n\nThis line of argument has been criticised by Huggett on the grounds\nthat the apparent mystery is a mere fabrication: the inaccessible\nnon-symmetric states can be ruled out as simply not physically\npossible (Huggett 1995). The surplus structure, then, is a consequence\nof the representation chosen and has no further metaphysical\nsignificance. However, it has been insisted that a theory should also\ntell us why a particular state of affairs is not possible. So,\nconsider the possible state of affairs in which a cold cup of tea\nspontaneously starts to boil. Statistical mechanics can explain why we\nnever observe such a possibility, whereas the\nquantum-objects-as-individuals view cannot explain why we never\nobserve non-symmetric states and hence it is deficient in this regard\n(Teller 1998).\n\n\nUnfortunately, the analogy is problematic. Statistical mechanics does\nnot say that the above situation never occurs but only that the\nprobability of its occurrence is extremely low. The question then\nreduces to that of \u2018why is this probability so low?\u2019 The\nanswer to that is typically given in terms of the very low number of\nstates corresponding to the tea boiling compared to the vast number of\nstates for which it remains cold. Why, then, this disparity in the\nnumber of accessible states? Or, equivalently, why do we find\nourselves in situations in which entropy increases? One answer takes\nus back to the initial conditions of the Big Bang. A similar line can\nthen be taken in the case of quantum statistics. Why do we never\nobserve non-symmetric states? Because that is the way the universe is\nand we should not expect quantum mechanics alone to have to explain\nwhy certain initial conditions obtain and not others. Here we recall\nthat the symmetry of the Hamiltonian ensures that if a particle is in\na state of a particular symmetry (corresponding to Bose-Einstein\nstatistics, say, or Fermi-Dirac) to begin with, it will remain in\nstates of that symmetry. Hence, if non-symmetric states do not feature\nin the initial conditions which held at the beginning of the universe,\nthey will remain forever inaccessible to the particles. The issue then\nturns on different views of the significance of the above\n\u2018surplus structure\u2019 (see Belousek 2000.)\n\n\nFurthermore, even if we accept the methodological principle of\n\u2018the less surplus structure the better\u2019, it is not clear\nthat QFT understood in terms of non-individual \u2018quanta\u2019\noffers any significant advantage in this respect (although see da Costa and Holik 2015 for an account in these terms of states with undefined particle number, characteristic of QFT). Indeed, it has been\nargued that the formalism of QFT is also compatible with the alternative\npackage of objects as individuals. Van Fraassen has\npressed this claim (1991), drawing on de Muynck\u2019s construction of\nstate spaces for QFT which involve labelled particles\n(1975). Butterfield, however, has argued that the existence of\nstates that are superpositions of particle number, within QFT,\nundermines the equivalence (1993). Nevertheless, Huggett insists, in\nthis case the undermining is empirical, rather than methodological\n(Huggett 1995).  When the number is constant, it is the states for\narbitrary numbers of particles which are so much surplus structure and\nnow, if the methodological argument is applied, it is the individuals\npackage which is to be preferred.\n\nIt is also worth noting, perhaps, that some of this\n\u2018surplus\u2019 structure corresponds to so-called\n\u2018paraparticle\u2019 statistics, or forms of quantum statistics\nthat are neither bosonic nor fermionic. These were acknowledged as\npossible by Dirac as early as the 1930s but were only fully developed\ntheoretically from the late 1950s. For a brief period in the mid-1960s\nit was thought that quarks might be paraparticles, before the same\nstatistical behaviour came to be described in terms of the new\nintrinsic property of \u2018colour\u2019 leading to the development\nof quantum chromodynamics, which effectively pushed paraparticle\ntheory into the theoretical twilight (for a summary of the history see\nFrench and Krause 2006, Ch. 3; for a discussion of paraparticles in\nthe context of issues relating to particle indistinguishability, see\nCaulton and Butterfield 2012b). This suggests that paraparticle\nstatistics can always be re-described in conventional terms \u2013 a\nsuggestion that has been taken up by Baker et. al. in the context of\nalgebraic QFT, thereby eliminating this form of surplus structure at\nleast (Baker, Halvorson and Swanson 2015).\n\nThere remains considerable scope for further exploration of all these\nissues and concerns in the context of quantum field theory (see also\nAuyang 1995) and a collection of relevant historical and philosophical\nreflections can be found in Cao (1999).\n\nA further approach to this underdetermination is to reject both\npackages and seek a third way. Thus Morganti has argued that both of\nthe above metaphysical packages assume that everything qualitative\nabout an object must be encoded in terms of a property that it\npossesses (Morganti 2009). Dropping this assumption allows us to\nconsider quantum statistics as describing \u2018inherent\u2019\nproperties of the assembly as a whole. The (anti-)symmetry of the\nrelevant states is then accounted for in terms of the disposition of\nthe system to give rise to certain correlated outcomes upon\nmeasurement. This is presented as an extension of Teller\u2019s\n\u2018relational holism\u2019 (Teller 1989), and\nrelatedly, the notion of \u2018inherence\u2019 involves the denial\nof the supervenience of the properties of the whole on those of the\nparts.  However, as just indicated, it comes with a cost: that of\nadmitting holistic dispositional properties and the metaphysics of\nthese in the quantum context requires further development, as does the\nsense in which such inherent properties \u2018emerge\u2019 when\nsystems interact. Earlier and along similar metaphysical lines, Lavine\nsuggested that quantum objects can be regarded as the smallest\npossible amounts of \u2018stuff\u2019 and, crucially, that a\nmulti-particle state represents a further amount of stuff such that it\ndoes not contain proper parts (1991; see also Jantzen 2019). Such a view, he claims, avoids\nthe metaphysically problematic aspects of both the individuals and\nnon-individuals packages. Of course, there are then the issues of the\nmetaphysics and logic of \u2018stuff\u2019, but it can be argued\nthat these are familiar and not peculiar to quantum mechanics. One\nsuch issue concerns the nature of \u2018stuff\u2019: is it our\nfamiliar primitive substance?  Substance as a fundamental metaphysical\nprimitive faces well-known difficulties and it has been suggested that\nit should be dropped in favour of some form of \u2018bundle\ntheory\u2019, as mentioned at the very beginning of this article. If\nthe individual objects are understood to be bundles of\n\u2018tropes\u2019, where a trope is an individual instance of a\nproperty or a relation, and if this notion is broadened to include\nindividuals whose existence depends on that of others which are not a\npart of them then, it is claimed, this notion may be flexible enough\nto accommodate quantum physics (Simons 1998; see also Morganti\n2013). Another issue concerns the manner in which \u2018stuff\u2019\ncombines: how do we go from the amounts of stuff represented by two\nindependent photons, to the amount represented by a joint two-photon\nstate? The analogies Lavine gives are well known: drops of water,\nmoney in the bank, bumps on a rope (Teller 1983; Hesse 1963). Of\ncourse, these may also be appropriated by the non-individual objects\nview but, more significantly, they are suggestive of a field-theoretic\napproach in which the \u2018stuff\u2019 in question is the quantum\nfield. \n\n\nHere we return to issues concerning the metaphysics of quantum field\ntheory and it is worth pointing out that underdetermination may arise\nhere too. In classical physics we are faced with a choice between the\nview of the field as a kind of global substance or stuff and an\nalternative conception in terms of field quantities assigned to and\nhence as properties of, the points of space-time. In the case of\nquantum field theory, the field quantities are not well-defined at\nsuch points (because of difficulties in defining exact locational\nstates in quantum field theory) but are instead regarded as\n\u2018smeared\u2019 over space-time regions (see Teller 1999). The\nunderdetermination remains, of course: between an understanding of the\ngiven quantum field in terms of some kind of global substance and the\nalternative conception in terms of the properties of\nspace-time regions. Taking the first option obviously\nrequires a metaphysically articulated form of substantivalism\napplicable to quantum field theory. Many commentators have preferred\nthe second option, but now, of course, attention must be paid to the\nmetaphysical status of the space-time regions over which the field\nproperties are taken to be instantiated. Typically, these will be\ntaken to be composed of points of space-time and conceiving of a field\nin terms of a set of properties meshes comfortably with the approach\nthat takes space-time to be a kind of substance or \u2018stuff\u2019\nitself. But this too faces well known difficulties in the context of\nmodern physics (see, for example, Earman 1989). In particular,\nspace-time substantivalism has been argued to have extremely\nunpalatable consequences (Earman and Norton 1987). Unfortunately, such\na properties-based account of fields is difficult to reconcile with\nthe alternative view of space-time as merely a system of relations\n(such as contiguity) between physical bodies: if the field quantities\nare properties of space-time regions and the latter are understood,\nultimately, to be reducible to relations between physical objects,\nwhere the latter are conceived of in field-theoretic terms, then a\ncircularity arises (see Rovelli 1999). One way forward would be to\ndraw on alternative accounts of the nature of spacetime. Thus Stachel\nhas suggested that we drop the sharp,\nmetaphysical distinction between things and\nrelations between things and adopt a broadly\n\u2018structuralist\u2019 view of spacetime (Stachel 1999; see the\nessays in Rickles, French & Saatsi 2006). Suitably extended, such\na \u2018structuralist\u2019 approach might offer a way around the\nabove incompatibility by regarding both space-time and the quantum\nfield in structural terms, rather than in terms of substances,\nproperties or relations (see Auyang 1995; Cao 2003; French and Ladyman\n2003; Kantorovich 2003; Lyre 2004; Saunders 2003b).\n\nThis takes us to a further possible response to the above metaphysical\nunderdetermination which urges realism to retreat from a metaphysics\nof objects and develop an ontology of structure compatible with the\nphysics (Ladyman 1998 and 2014). An early attempt to do this in the\nquantum context can be seen in the work of Cassirer who noted the\nimplications of the new physics for the standard notion of individual\nobjects and concluded that quantum objects were describable only as\n\u2018\u201cpoints of intersection\u201d of certain\nrelations\u2019 (1937, p. 180) Setting aside the neo-Kantian elements\nin Cassirer\u2019s structuralism, this view of quantum entities has been\ndeveloped in the context of a form of \u2018ontic\u2019 structural realism\n(Ladyman and Ross 2007). Drawing on the views\nof both Weyl and Wigner, quantum objects are here understood as\nontologically constituted, group theoretically, in terms of sets of\ninvariants, such as rest mass, charge, spin, and so on (Castellani\n1998a). From this perspective, both the individuality and\nnon-individuality packages get off on the wrong feet, as it were, by\nassuming that the way the world is, according to physics, is a world\nof objects, which can either be regarded as individuals, whether\nprimitively or via weak discernibility, or as non-individuals, whether\nformally represented through quasi-set theory or not. \n\nHow, then, should we regard the \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019 with which we began this discussion of identity and individuality in the quantum context? Both the above packages rest upon a certain understanding of particle permutations, as encapsulated in that  Postulate, namely that these are to be conceived in terms of swapping the particles  between states, or boxes in our illustrative sketch. However, we can also think of the \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019 as expressing a fundamental symmetry constraint on quantum mechanics, to the effect that the relevant states should be invariant under particle permutations. An alternative way of regarding this \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 that aligns with a widely accepted view of symmetry principles in general is that it expresses a certain representational redundancy in the formalism. Thus, referring to our sketch above, the permuted arrangement of one particle in each box, which is counted in classical statistical mechanics but not in the quantum form, can be considered as \u2018representationally redundant\u2019 in this sense. This casts \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 as one of a number of such symmetry principles that have acquired a fundamental role in modern physics (Huggett 1999b; French and Rickles 2003). Not surprisingly perhaps, such a re-casting may also have metaphysical implications in that when applied to certain systems obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics \u2013 that is, systems of \u2018material\u2019 particles \u2013 the composition of such systems (in the sense that they may be regarded as composed or made up of sub-systems considered as \u2018parts\u2019) violates standard mereological principles (Caulton 2015; for some possible responses see Bigaj 2016). More generally it has been argued that \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 is incompatible with a particle ontology understood even in a metaphysically minimal sense (Jantzen 2011). Given the fundamental significance of the former, it has been suggested that the latter must then be jettisoned. A possible alternative is to adopt a form of space-time substantivalism and take property-bearing regions of space-time to provide the appropriate ontological basis (Jantzen 2011). However that runs into the sorts of problems touched on above.\n\nMore radically, perhaps, dropping the above \u2018object-oriented\u2019\nassumption would undercut the metaphysical underdetermination entirely and open up space for an alternative ontology in terms of which quantum entities are conceived of as nothing more than\nfeatures of \u2018the structure of the world\u2019 (see French and Ladyman 2003). This can then be articulated in terms of the relevant laws and symmetries with the properties of such putative entities understood as the determinate aspects of this structure (see French 2014; for further consideration of such an ontology in the context of \u2018structural realism\u2019, see Ladyman 2014).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, R., 1979, \u201cPrimitive Thisness and Primitive Identity\u201d,\n<em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 76: 5\u201326.", "Arenhart, J.R.B., 2012, \u201cFinite Cardinals in Quasi-Set Theory\u201d,\n<em>Studia Logica</em>, 100: 437\u2013452.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017a, \u201cThe Received View on Quantum Non-Individuality: Formal and Metaphysical Analysis\u201d,\n<em>Synthese</em>, 194: 1323\u20131347.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017b, \u201cDoes Weak Discernibility Determine Metaphysics?\u201d,\n<em>Theoria</em>, 32: 109\u2013125.", "Arenhart, J.R.B. and Krause, D., 2014, \u201cFrom Primitive\nIdentity to the Non-Individuality of Quantum\nObjects\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern\nPhysics</em>, 46: 273\u2013282.", "Arenhart, J.R.B., Bueno, O. and Krause, D., 2019, \u201cMaking\nSense of Nonindividuals in Quantum Mechanics\u201d, in O.
