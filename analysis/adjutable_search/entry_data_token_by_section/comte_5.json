    "main_text": "The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill || The classification of the sciences and philosophy of science\n4.2 The classification of the sciences and philosophy of science\n\nThe second pillar of positive philosophy, the law of the\nclassification of the sciences, has withstood the test of time much\nbetter than the law of the three stages. Of the various\nclassifications that have been proposed, it is Comte\u2019s that is\nstill the most popular today. This classification, too, structures the\nCourse, which examines each of the six fundamental\nsciences\u2014mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology,\nsociology\u2014in turn. It provides a way to do justice to the\ndiversity of the sciences without thereby losing sight of their unity.\nThis classification also makes Comte the founder of the philosophy of\nscience in the modern sense. From Plato to Kant, reflection on science\nhad always occupied a central place in philosophy, but the sciences\nhad to be sufficiently developed for their diversity to manifest\nitself. It was thanks to his education at the \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique that Comte, from 1818, began to develop the concept of a\nphilosophy of science. At about the same time Bolzano wrote his\nWissenschaftslehre (1834) and Mill his System of\nLogic (1843), Comte\u2019s Course presented in sequence\na philosophy of mathematics, of astronomy, of physics, of chemistry,\nof biology, and of sociology. Comte\u2019s classification is meant\nnot to restore a chimerical unity, but to avoid the fragmentation of\nknowledge. Thanks to it, the sciences are related to one another in an\nencyclopedic scale that goes from the general to the particular, and\nfrom the simple to the complex: moving from mathematics to sociology,\ngenerality decreases and complexity increases.\n\nThe law of classification of the sciences also has a historical\naspect: it gives us the order in which the sciences develop. For\nexample, astronomy requires mathematics, and chemistry requires\nphysics. Each science thus rests upon the one that precedes it. As\nComte puts it, the higher depends on the lower, but is not its result.\nThe recognition of an irreducible diversity already contains a\ndisavowal of reductionism (in Comte\u2019s wording:\n\u2018materialism\u2019), which the classification allows one to\nmake explicit. The positivist clearly sees that the tendency towards\nreductionism is fed by the development of scientific knowledge itself,\nwhere each science participates in the evolution of the next; but\nhistory also teaches us that each science, in order to secure its own\nsubject matter, has to fight invasions by the preceding one.\n\u2018Thus it appears that Materialism is a danger inherent in the\nmode in which the scientific studies necessary as a preparation for\nPositivism were pursued. Each science tended to absorb the one next to\nit, on the grounds of having reached the positive stage earlier and\nmore thoroughly.\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 50; E., v. 1, 39)\n\nWhile philosophers of science have always recognized the place of\nComte in the history of their discipline, the philosophy of science\npresented in the Course, and a fortiori the one in\nthe System, have hardly been studied (Laudan 1981, Brenner\n2021). Comte\u2019s philosophy of science is based on a systematic\ndifference between method and doctrine. These are, to use Comtean\nterminology, opposed to one another, as the logical point of view and\nthe scientific point of view. Method is presented as superior to\ndoctrine: scientific doctrines change (that is what\n\u201cprogress\u201d means), but the value of science lies in its\nmethods. At the level of doctrine, mathematics has a status of its\nown, well indicated in the second lesson, where it is presented last,\nand as if to make up for something forgotten. As much as it is itself\na body of knowledge, it is an instrument of discovery in the other\nsciences, an \u2018organon\u2019 in the Aristotelian sense. Among\nthe remaining sciences, leaving sociology aside for the moment, two\noccupy a pre-eminent place:\n\nAstronomy and biology are, by their nature, the two principal branches\nof natural philosophy. They, the complement of each other, include the\ngeneral system of our fundamental conceptions in their rational\nharmony. The solar system and Man are the extremes within which our\nideas will forever be included. The system first, and then Man,\naccording to the course of our speculative reason: and the reverse in\nthe active process: the laws of the system determining those of Man,\nand remaining unaffected by them. (1830 (40), v. 1, 717\u2013718; E.,\nv. 1, 384)\n\n\nThe positive method comes in different forms, according to the science\nwhere it is applied: in astronomy it is observation, in physics\nexperimentation, in biology comparison. The same point of view is also\nbehind the general theory of hypotheses in the 28th lesson, a\ncenterpiece of the positive philosophy of science.\n\nFinally, classification is the key to a theory of technology. The\nreason is that there exists a systematic connection between complexity\nand modifiability: the more complex a phenomenon is, the more\nmodifiable it is. The order of nature is a modifiable order. Human\naction takes place within the limits fixed by nature and consists in\nreplacing the natural order by an artificial one. Comte\u2019s\neducation as an engineer had made him quite aware of the links between\nscience and its applications, which he summarized in an oft-quoted\nslogan: \u2018From science comes prevision, from prevision comes\naction\u2019. Only death prevented him from writing the System of\nPositive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of Humanity on the\nPlanet, announced as early as 1822.\n",
