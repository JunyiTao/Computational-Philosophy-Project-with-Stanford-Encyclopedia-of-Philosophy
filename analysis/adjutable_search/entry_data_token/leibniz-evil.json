This is manifest in the fact that the first and the last\nbook-length works that he authored, the\nPhilosopher's Confession (written at age 26 in 1672) and\nthe Theodicy (written in 1709, seven years before his death)\nwere both devoted to this problem, as well as in the fact that in the\nintervening years Leibniz wrote numerous short pieces on related\nissues\u2013\u2013many of which may be found in Gr and will soon be\navailable in English translations currently being undertaken by\nR. C. Sleigh, Jr.\u2013\u2013 and one full-length work,\nthe Dissertation on Predestination and Grace (DPG), which was\nonly published in 2011.  The fact that the Theodicy was the\nonly book-length treatise that Leibniz published during his lifetime\nprovides further evidence of the significance that he attributed to\nthe topic. It is therefore appropriate that it has now become an\ninterpretive commonplace that Leibniz's concern with the problem of\nevil was central to his overarching philosophical concerns throughout\nhis philosophical career.  [See Rutherford (1995) and Antognazza\n(2009).]  Leibniz's approach to the problem of evil became known to\nmany readers through Voltaire's lampoon in Candide: the link\nthat Voltaire seems to forge between Leibniz and the extravagant\noptimism of Dr. Pangloss continues\u2013\u2013for better or\nworse\u2013\u2013to shape the popular understanding of Leibniz's\napproach to the problem of evil.  In this entry we examine the two\nmain species of the problem of evil that Leibniz addresses. The first,\n\u201cthe underachiever problem,\u201d is raised by a critic who\nwould argue that the existence of evil in our world indicates that God\ncannot be as knowledgeable, powerful, or good as traditional\nmonotheists have claimed. The second, \u201cthe holiness\nproblem,\u201d is raised by the critic who would argue that God's\nintimate causal entanglements with the world make God the cause of\nevil. God is thereby implicated in evil to the detriment of his\nholiness.\n\n", "toc": [{"#Var": "1. Various Versions of the Problem of Evil in Leibniz"}, {"#Und": "2.

Various Versions of the Problem of Evil in Leibniz\n\n\nBefore examining Leibniz's views on the problem of evil, it is\nnecessary to do some stage-setting in order to locate just what sort\nof problem Leibniz thought evil presented. Consideration of any\npresent-day introductory textbook of philosophy reveals that the\nproblem of evil in contemporary philosophy is standardly regarded as\nan argument for atheism. The atheist contends that God and evil are\nincompatible, and given that evil clearly exists, God cannot\nexist. Some philosophers, conceding that the claimed incompatibility\nin the foregoing argument is too strong, contend, nevertheless, that\neven if the existence of God and the existence of evil should prove to\nbe compatible, the existence (or duration, or amount, or\npervasiveness) of evil provides us at the very least with compelling\ncircumstantial evidence that God does not exist.\n\n\nFramed in this way, the \u201catheistic problem of evil\u201d\ninvites certain sorts of responses. In particular, it invites the\ntheist to explain how a being that is omniscient, omnibenevolent, and\nomnipotent can allow evil to exist.  Present-day responses to the\nproblem of evil therefore focus largely on presenting\n\u201ctheodicies,\u201d that is, reasons why a perfect being does or\nmight permit evil of the sort (or duration, or amount, or\ndistribution) that we find in our world to exist.\n\n\nWhen we consider, however, the works of medieval philosophers who\naddress the problem of evil, the \u201catheistic problem\u201d is\nnot to be found. Since these figures believed that the arguments of\nnatural theology demonstrated the existence of God, the problem that\nevil presented for them was different from that engaged by present-day\nphilosophers. In present-day terminology, medieval philosophers did\nnot engage the \u201cevidential\u201d problem of evil: rather, they\nengaged the \u201caporetic\u201d problem of evil, in order to try to\nresolve the apparent logical incompatibility between God's attributes\nand the existence of evil.  [On the distinction between these\nproblems, see Adams and Adams (1990), pp. 1\u20133.]  The problem,\ntherefore, was taken to be that of explaining the compatibility of the\nexistence of evil with divine moral purity or holiness. These\nphilosophers believed that God is the author of everything that\nexists, and given that evil is one of the things that exists, it might\nseem that God is therefore the author of evil. And if an agent is an\n\u201cauthor of evil,\u201d he is therefore implicated in the evil\nand cannot be morally pure or holy. Thus, God cannot be morally pure\nnor holy. Let's call this version of the problem of evil the\n\u201choliness problem.\u201d Before moving on, it should be noted\nthat in light of the fact that Leibniz and his predecessors shared a\ncommitment to God's existence, one might think that their approach to\nthe problem of evil begs the question against the atheistic critic who\ncharges that the existence of evil provides evidence that God does not\nexist.  But this issue simply did not arise for Leibniz and his\npredecessors, given their antecedent belief in God's existence, and\ntherefore it is inappropriate to charge these philosophers with\nbegging the question.\n\n\nTraditional theists held\u2013\u2013and present-day theists still do\nhold\u2013\u2013that God is the \u201cauthor\u201d or cause of\neverything in the cosmos in at least three different respects, so\ndiscussions of the holiness problem often branch off in three\ncorrespondingly different directions. First, God is regarded as the\ncreative cause of everything in the cosmos. Everything that\nexists contingently is brought into existence by means of the creative\nactivity of God. Second, it is held that God is the conserving cause of\neverything that exists. So God not only creates every created being, but every created\nbeing that continues to exist does so in virtue of God's continuously\nmaintaining it in existence. Third, every action caused by a\ncreated being requires direct divine activity as concurrent\ncause.  So every whack of a hammer, every strike of my fingertip\non the keyboard, every tug of a magnet on a piece of iron, requires\nnot only that the created being act, but also that the creator act\nconcurrently with the created being in order to bring about the\nparticular effect of the cause in question.  [For a classic exposition\nof these various modes of divine causal involvement see St. Thomas\nAquinas, Disputationes de Potentia Dei, Q.3, a.7, resp.]\n\n\nGiven that on this traditional account, God is intimately intertwined\nwith the workings of the cosmos, the holiness problem seemed all the\nmore intractable. In light of the intimate connections between God and\nthe created world, the problem is not just that God created a world\nthat happens to include evil, but that God seems to be causally (and\nthus morally) implicated in, for example, every particular act of\nmurder, every earthquake, and every death caused by\nplague. Consequently, responses to the holiness problem sought to\nexplain not only how God could remain holy despite\nhaving created a world such as ours, but also how he could\nremain holy despite conserving the world in existence and\ncausally cooperating with all the events that occur in it.\n\n\nIn light of the fact that Leibniz lived in between these two eras,\neras in which evil was taken to present different problems for the\nmonotheistic philosopher, we are immediately led to wonder what sort\nof problem he sought to address. Leibniz expends a great deal of\neffort attempting to solve the holiness problem, but he also takes up\nsomething akin to the atheistic problem. It would be anachronistic,\nhowever, to claim that Leibniz was engaged with the atheistic problem,\nfor in his time the existence of evil was taken to be an argument for\nan unorthodox form of theism rather than an argument for\natheism. Thus, for example, a group of thinkers collectively known as\nthe \u201cSocinians\u201d held, among other things, that the\nexistence of evil was not incompatible with God's existence,\nbut that it was incompatible with the existence of an\nomniscient God. The Socinians therefore held that God must\nnot be omniscient, and that he must at the very least lack knowledge\nof future contingent events. [For Leibniz's view on the Socinians\nsee Theodicy 364 (H343; G VI 318) et passim. More\ndetails on Socinianism can be found in Jolley, c.2, and\nMaclachlan.]\n\n\nWe might then characterize the problem raised by atheists in our own\ncentury and by the Socinians, to cite just one example from the\nseventeenth century, more broadly as the \u201cunderachiever\nproblem.\u201d According to the underachiever problem, if the sort of\nbeing that traditional monotheism identifies as God were to exist, the\nexistence of this world would represent a vast underachievement on his\npart: therefore there is no such being. Atheists take this conclusion\nto prove that there is no God; the Socinians take it to show that God\nis not the sort of being that the traditional theist supposes him to\nbe.\n\n\nAlthough Leibniz is concerned about the underachiever\nproblem, it is the Socinian, and not the atheistic, version of the\nproblem that he engages. The winds of atheism had\nnot reached the gale force proportions that they would in succeeding\ncenturies. Consequently, this stronger conclusion was not yet taken as a\nserious, or at least the main, threat presented by the existence of evil.\n\n\nIt is important to distinguish between these versions of the problem\nof evil since we cannot understand Leibniz's treatment of evil in a\ngiven text until we know what problem it is that he means to be\naddressing in that text. Having set the stage in this way, we can now\nconsider Leibniz's solutions to the problem of evil: we first consider\nthe underachiever problem, and then turn to the holiness problem.\n2. The Underachiever Problem\n\n\nThe core of Leibniz's solution to the underachiever problem is\nstraightforward. Leibniz argues that God does not underachieve in\ncreating this world because this world is the best of all possible\nworlds. Many thinkers have supposed that commitment to the claim that\nthis world is the best of all possible worlds follows\nstraightforwardly from monotheism. Because God is omnipotent and\nomniscient, nothing can prevent him from creating the best world, and\nhis omnibenevolence obliges him to create the best world. So the\ncreated world is the best world.\n\n\nLeibniz's reasoning to this conclusion does not, however, follow this\nstraightforward path: among other things, this reasoning is not cogent\nas it stands. A number of seventeenth-century figures recognized that\nGod would not be obliged to create the best world if there were no\nsuch thing as the best world. There would be no best world if the\nseries of possible worlds formed a continuum of increasingly good\nworlds ad infinitum. And if there is no best world, God\ncannot be faulted for failing to create the best one since to do so\nwould be as impossible as, say, naming the highest number. There is no\nsuch number of course, and likewise no such world. So while God may be\nobliged to create a world that has at least some measure of goodness,\nhe cannot be obliged, on this view, to create the best. And therefore\nit might be the case that God simply chose arbitrarily to create one\nof infinitely many morally acceptable worlds. [This line of argument\nwas common among certain Jesuit scholastics of the period. For\ndiscussions of this issue, see, for example, Ruiz de\nMontoya, Commentaria ac Disputationes in primam partem Sancti\nThomae. De voluntate Dei et propiis actibus eius, Lyon 1630,\ndisp. 9 and 10, and Diego Granado, Comentarii in primam partem\nSummae Theologicae S. Thomae, Pont-a-Mousson, 1624,\npp.420\u2013433.]\n\n\nLeibniz was aware of this argument denying God's obligation to create\nthe best, but he was firmly committed to rejecting it, in virtue of a\ncentral principle of his philosophical system, the Principle of\nSufficient Reason. According to the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\nfor any state of affairs, there must be a sufficient reason that\nexplains why that state of affairs and not some other state of affairs\nobtains. When it comes to our world, then, there must be some reason\nthat explains why it, and not some other world, obtains. But there can\nbe no such reason if it is the case that the goodness of worlds\nincreases ad infinitum. Leibniz therefore concluded that\nthere can be no infinite continuum of worlds.\n\n\nOne might be tempted to resist Leibniz's argument by saying that even\naccording to the view on which there is an \u201cinfinite continuum\nof good worlds,\u201d there is something that can serve as the\nsufficient reason for existence of this world, namely, God's\ndecree that this world be actual. But such a response, Leibniz\nobserves, would merely push the problem back, because the Principle of\nSufficient Reason applies to free choices just as it applies to any\nother event or state of affairs.  Thus, we would have to provide a\nsufficient reason for God's choice of this world instead of some other\nworld on the continuum of morally acceptable worlds. And it seems that\nsuch a sufficient reason cannot be given on the infinite continuum of\ngood worlds view. Note that the sufficient reason cannot be derived\nfrom some feature or fact about the world that is actually chosen, for\nthis would raise the obvious question: Why did this feature\nin particular serve as the sufficient reason for God's choice? The\nonly possible answers, it appears, would be: (a) Because God\narbitrarily selected that feature as the one he would favor in\ndeciding which world to create; or (b) Because that feature made that\nworld better than all its competitors. But notice that neither of\nthese answers is acceptable. The first is inconsistent with the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason. The second is incompatible with the\nhypothesis at issue, that there is no \u201cbest world.\u201d\n\n\nOne might think that declaring this world to be the best possible\nworld does not constitute a valid response to the underachiever\nproblem. Indeed, such a response might be taken to provide the basis\nfor a new underachiever argument along the following lines:\n\nIf God were all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good,\nthen this world would be the best possible world. \nBut surely this world is not the best possible world.\nThus, God is not all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good.\n\n\n\nLeibniz believes, however, that there was overwhelming evidence that\nthe conclusion of this argument was false. He therefore must take one\nof the two premises in this argument to be false. Given that he\nhimself is committed to the first premise, he must reject the second\npremise. And this is precisely what he does. \n\n\nWhat reason, Leibniz asks, does the critic have for thinking that (2)\nis true? When Leibniz addresses this issue, he usually has the critic\nsay something along the following lines:\nSurely this world is not the best possible world since we\ncan easily conceive of possible worlds that are better. Take some\ntoken instance of suffering: the tragic bombing of the Oklahoma City\nfederal building. Surely a world without that event would be better\nthan the actual world. And there is no reason why God couldn't have\ncreated the world without that event. Thus, this is not the best\npossible world.  [See Theodicy 118\u2013119 (H\n188\u2013191; G VI 168\u2013172).]\n\n\nLeibniz's response to this sort of criticism comes in two stages.\nFirst, Leibniz says that while we can think of certain token features\nof the world that in and of themselves might be better than they are,\nwe do not know whether it is possible to create a better world lacking\nthose features, because we can never be certain of the nature of the\nconnections between the token events in question and other events in\nthe world. If we could improve or eliminate the token event in\nquestion without otherwise changing the world, we might well have a\nbetter world. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing whether such a\nchange to the token event would leave the world otherwise unchanged,\nor might instead make things, on balance,\nworse. [See Theodicy 211\u2013214 (H 260\u20132; G VI\n244\u20137) and Gr, p.64f., for examples of this sort of\nresponse.]\n\n\nSecond, examples such as these are deceptive because they presume that\nGod utilizes standards of world goodness that he may not in fact\nuse. For example, it may presume that a world is good only if each\npart taken in isolation is good (a standard, we have seen, that\nLeibniz rejects), or it might presume that a world is good only if\nhuman beings enjoy happiness in it.\n\n\nLeibniz argues in numerous texts that it is parochial to think that\nhuman happiness is the standard whereby the goodness of worlds is to\nbe judged. A more reasonable standard, according to Leibniz, would be\nthe happiness of all sentient beings. But once we admit this, it may\nturn out that the amount of unhappiness in the created realm is quite\nsmall, given that for all we know, the sentient beings on Earth might\nconstitute a very small percentage of the sentient beings created by\nGod. Here Leibniz includes not only preternatural beings such as\nangels, but also the possibility of extraterrestrial rational beings\n[Theodicy 19 (H 134\u20135; G VI 113\u20134)].\n\n\nThere is disagreement among Leibniz scholars about the basis for\njudging the goodness of worlds. Various scholars have defended one or\nmore of the following:\n\nThe best world is the one that maximizes the happiness\n(i.e., virtue) of rational beings. \nThe best world is the one that maximizes the \u201cquantity of\nessence.\u201d\nThe best world is the one that yields the greatest variety of\nphenomena governed by the simplest set of laws.\n\n\n\nThere is scholarly dispute about whether Leibniz believed that the\nmaximization of the happiness or virtue of rational beings is one of\nthe standards by which God judges the goodness of the world. [For\nsupporters of this claim see Rutherford, c.3; Blumenfeld, Brown; for\ndetractors see Russell, p. 199, Gale.] It is unlikely that Leibniz\nbelieved that (1) alone was the true standard of goodness of the world\nin light of following comment on an argument advanced by Bayle: \nthe author is still presupposing that false maxim \u2026\nstating that the happiness of rational creatures is the sole aim of God.\n[Theodicy 120 (H 192; G VI 172)]\n\n\nIn part, the dispute over this standard hangs on whether or not (1) is\ncompatible with the more metaphysical standards embodied in (2) and (3),\nsince it is these more metaphysical standards that Leibniz seems to\nendorse most consistently. In some cases, Leibniz writes as if the\nstandard of happiness is fully compatible with the more metaphysical\ncriteria. For example, within a single work, the Discourse on\nMetaphysics, Leibniz entitled Section 5 \u201cWhat the rules of the\nperfection of divine conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the\nways is in balance with the richness of effects,\u201d and he entitled Section\n36: \u201cGod is the monarch of the most perfect republic, composed of all\nminds, and the happiness of this city of God is his principal purpose.\u201d\nSo Leibniz seems to advance both standards (1) and (3) in the same work\n[For another example, see R p. 105 (K X pp.9\u201310)]. In other places\nhowever, he writes as if they compete with one another [See Theodicy\n124 (H 197\u20138; G VI 178\u20139).] \n\n\nWhatever position one comes to hold on this matter, Leibniz often\npoints to the more metaphysical standards as the ones God utilizes in\nassessing the goodness of worlds. But there is further controversy\nover exactly which metaphysical standard, (2) or (3), Leibniz\nendorses. In general, Leibniz holds that God creates the world in\norder to share his goodness with created things in the most perfect\nmanner possible [Gr 355\u20136].  In light of the fact that created\nbeings, in virtue of their limitations, can mirror the divine goodness\nonly in limited respects, God creates a variety of things, each of\nwhich has an essence that reflects a different facet of divine\nperfection in its own unique way. Since this is God's purpose in\ncreating the world, it would be reasonable to think that maximizing\nthe mirroring of divine goodness in creation is the goal that God\nseeks to achieve. And this in fact is one of the standards Leibniz\nseems to endorse. We might call this the \u201cmaximization of\nessence\u201d standard. Leibniz seems convinced that the actual world\nmeets this standard and that creatures are to be found that mirror the\ndivine perfections in all the sorts of ways that creatures can do\nthis. Thus, there are creatures with bodies and creatures without,\ncreatures with freedom and intelligence and creatures without,\ncreatures with sentience and creatures without, etc. [See, for\nexample, MP pp. 75\u20136 and 138 (G VII 303\u20134 and 310).]\n\n\nIn some texts, however, Leibniz frames the standard of goodness in\nwhat some have taken to be a third distinct way. In these places he\nargues that the goodness of a world is measured by the ratio between the\nvariety of phenomena that a world contains and the simplicity of the laws\nthat govern that world. Here Leibniz emphasizes the fact that the perfection\nof a world that maximizes the variety of phenomena it contains is\nenhanced by the simplicity of its laws since this displays the\nintelligence of the creator who created it.\n\n\nSome scholars have argued that one or the other of these\ntwo more metaphysical standards represents Leibniz's settled view on\nthe true standard of goodness [Gale, for example]. Other scholars have argued\nthat, in the end, the two standards are not exclusive of each other.\n[See Rutherford, cc.2\u20133 and Rescher, c.1 for two very different ways of\nharmonizing (2) and (3).]\n\n\nRegardless of which of these interpretations is correct, if these are\nthe standards by which God judges the world's goodness, it becomes\nmuch more difficult to defend the claim that this is not the best\npossible world. We can use standard (3) to illustrate. In order, for\nexample, for God to eliminate the Oklahoma City bombing from the\nworld, what would be required in order for him to do so? There are\npresumably a number of ways in which this might be done. The most\nobvious would involve miraculous intervention somewhere in the chain\nof events leading up to the explosion. God might miraculously prevent\nthe explosives from detonating, or he might eliminate the truck and\nits contents from the world. But this sort of miraculous intervention\nwould require that the laws governing the world become more\ncomplex. Consequently, Leibniz, and others who share this view of what\nthe goodness of a world consists in, such as Malebranche, think that\nmiraculous intervention is generally repugnant and would require\nvastly outweighing goods to result from a miraculous intervention in\norder for such an intervention to be\npermissible. [See Theodicy 129 (H 192\u20133; G VI 182).]\n\n\nIn any event, Leibniz holds that we are simply unable to know how\nchanging certain events would change the world's capacity to meet the\nstandards of goodness described in (2) and (3). Thus, according to\nLeibniz, we are not justified in claiming that this world is not as\ngood, all things considered, as some other possible world. According\nto Leibniz, then, the underachiever problem cannot get off the ground\nunless the critic is able to defend the claim that this world is not\nthe best possible world. It should be noted that Leibniz's approach to\nthe underachiever problem thus seems be immune to the line of\ncriticism pressed by Voltaire in Candide, namely, that it is\nobvious that this world is not the best possible world because there\nare so many manifest evils in it.  Leibniz does not believe that each\nindividual event is the best possible event, and he does not think\nthat it is possible for finite minds to demonstrate that every\nindividual event must be a part of the best possible world: rather, he\nbelieves that the world as a whole is the best possible world.  (That\nsaid, it should be noted that there is considerable scholarly\ncontroversy as to whether Voltaire's target in Candide is\nindeed Leibniz: it has been claimed, for example, that the\n\u201coptimism\u201d lampooned in Candide is closer to that\nof Pope (see Rutherford (1995); on the general reception of Leibniz in\nFrance, see Barber (1955)].) In any event, on Leibniz's view, our\ninability to know how changing certain events in the world would\naffect other events and our inability to know how such changes would\naffect the overall goodness of the world make it impossible to defend\nthe claim that the manifest evils in the world constitute evidence\nthat this is not the best possible world.\n3. The Holiness Problem\n\n\nFar less scholarly attention has been devoted to Leibniz's treatment of\nthe holiness problem, if only because this conception of the problem\nhas only recently been recognized by Leibniz scholars. As noted\nabove, the main problem here is that God's character seems to be\nstained by evil because God causally contributes to the\nexistence of everything in the world, and evil is one of those things.\n[For two recent treatments see Sleigh (1996) and Murray (2005)]\n\nThe standard solution adopted by medieval thinkers was to deny an\nassumption of the preceding argument, namely, that evil is\n\u201csomething.\u201d Evil was claimed not to have any positive\nreality, but to be a mere \u201cprivation\u201d or\n\u201clack\u201d of being.  On such a view, evil has no more reality\nthan the hole in the center of a donut. Making a donut does not\nrequire putting together two components, the cake and the hole: the\ncake is all that there is to the donut, and the hole is just the\n\u201cprivation of cake.\u201d It therefore would be silly to say\nthat making the donut requires causing both the cake and the hole to\nexist. Causing the cake to exist causes the hole as a\n\u201cby-product\u201d of causing a particular kind of cake to\nexist.  Thus, we need not assume any additional cause for the hole\nbeyond that assumed for the causing of the cake. \n\n\nThe upshot of our pastry analogy is this: given that evil, like the\nhole, is merely a privation, it requires no cause (or as the\nmedievals, and Leibniz, liked to say, it needs no \u201ccause per\nse\u201d). God does not \u201ccausally contribute to the\nexistence of evil\u201d because evil per se is not a thing\nand therefore requires no cause in order to exist. And since God does\nnot cause the existence of evil, God cannot be causally implicated in\nevil. Thus, the holiness problem evaporates.\n\n\nEarly in his philosophical career, Leibniz, like other\nseventeenth-century philosophers, scoffed at this solution to the\nholiness problem. In a short piece entitled \u201cThe Author of\nSin,\u201d Leibniz explains why he thinks the privation response to\nthe holiness problem fails. Leibniz argues that God is the author of\nall that is real and positive in the world, and that God is therefore\nalso the \u201cauthor\u201d of all of privations in the world.\n\u201cIt is a manifest illusion to hold that God is not the author of\nsin because there is no such thing as an author of a privation, even\nthough he can be called the author of everything which is real and\npositive in the sinful act\u201d [A.6.3.150].\n\n\nLeibniz explains why he takes this response to be a \u201cmanifest\nillusion,\u201d through the consideration of an example. Suppose that\na painter creates two paintings that are identical in every respect,\nexcept that the one is a scaled down version of the other. It would be\nabsurd, Leibniz remarks,\n\u2026 to say that the painter is the author of all that is\nreal in the two paintings, without however being the author of what is\nlacking or the disproportion between the larger and the smaller\npainting\u2026 . In effect, what is lacking is nothing more than a\nsimple result of an infallible consequence of that which is positive,\nwithout any need for a distinct author [of that which is lacking].\n[A.6.3.151]\n\n\nSo even if it is true that evil is a privation, this does not have as\na consequence that God is not the author of sin. Given that what is\npositively willed by God is a sufficient condition for the existence\nof the evil state of affairs, in virtue of willing what is positive in\nsome state of affairs, God is also the author of what is privative in\nthat state of affairs.  [A similar early critique is found at\nA.6.3.544]. \n\n\nLeibniz therefore sought to develop a different strategy in order to\nclear God of the charge of being the author of sin. In\nthe Philosopher's Confession, his most significant treatise\non evil aside from the Theodicy, Leibniz claims that although\nGod wills everything in the world, his will with respect to goods\nis decretory , whereas his will with respect to evils is\nmerely permissive. And Leibniz argues that God's permissive\nwilling of evils is morally permissible if and only if such permission\nof evil is necessary in order for one to meet one's moral\nobligations..\n\n\nIt should be noted that Leibniz does not think that the\npermission of evil is morally justified on the grounds that such permission\nbrings about a greater good that may not otherwise be\nachieved. Such an explanation, according to Leibniz, would make\nit the case that God would violate in the Biblical injunction\n\u201cnot to do evil that good may come\u201d [Causa Dei 36\n(S 121; G VI 444)]. Leibniz therefore claims that the evil that God\npermits is a necessary consequence of God's fulfilling his\nduty (namely, to create the best world).  Leibniz characterizes\n(morally permissible) permission as follows:\nP permits E iff: \n\n\nP fails to will that E\nP fails to will that not-E\nP brings it about that the state of affairs S\nobtains by willing that S obtains\nIf S obtains then E obtains\nP knows that (4)\nP believes that it is P's duty to will S and\nthat the good of performing one's duty outweighs the evil entailed by\nE's obtaining\n\n\n\n[This account is distilled from A.6.3.129\u2013131]\n\n\n\nThis, Leibniz believes, resolves any holiness problem that might arise\nin so far as God is considered as the creator of the\nuniverse. However, after writing the Philosopher's\nConfession, Leibniz became increasingly concerned that a tension\nmight arise in his account when it was applied to the holiness problem\nin the context of concurrence. Recall that traditional\ntheists held that God was not only creator and conserver of all\ncreated things, but that God also was the concurrent cause of all\nactions of created things. \n\n\nThere were heated debates in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nconcerning the nature of divine concurrence.  The dispute centered on\nthe respect in which God concurred with the free acts of\ncreatures. This was an especially pressing problem for the obvious\nreason that positing too close a connection between God and created\nbeings in cases where moral evils are committed runs the risk of\nimplicating God in the evil, thus raising the holiness problem all\nover again. This debate often focused on a certain type of proposition\nand on what made this type of proposition true. The propositions in\nquestion are called \u201cconditional future contingents\u201d,\npropositions of the form:\nIf agent S were in circumstances C and\ntime t, S would freely chose to f.\n\n\nPropositions of this form were particularly important in discussions\nof philosophical theology in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nbecause it was believed that it was necessary that God know\npropositions of this type in order to exercise providential control\nover the free actions of created beings. In order to exercise\nprovidential control over free actions in the created world, God must\nknow precisely how each such being will choose to act in each\ncircumstance in which it will find itself. If God, for example, did\nnot know what Eve would choose to do when confronted by the serpent,\nor what I would choose to do when confronted with a tuna sandwich, God\ncould not know in advance the order of events in the universe he\ndeigns to create. \n\n\nBut how does God know whether or not a token proposition of\nthis type is true? In general, disputants in this period held that\nthere are only two possible answers to this question. God knows that a\ntoken proposition of this type is true either because he wills that\nthat proposition be true, or he knows that proposition to be true\nbecause something independent of his will makes it true, and God, in\nvirtue of his omniscience, therefore knows it to be true. Following\nrecent scholarship, we will call the first view the\n\u201cpostvolitional view\u201d (since the truth of the proposition\nis determined only after God wills it) and the latter view the\n\u201cprevolitional\u201d view (since the truth of the proposition\nis independent of what God wills). In his early writings on the topic,\nLeibniz seemed inclined to postvolitionalism. So take the token\nproposition:\nIf Peter were accused of consorting with Christ during\nChrist's trial, Peter would deny Christ.\n\n\nThe early Leibniz holds that this type of proposition is true because\nGod decrees that it would be true: that is, God decrees that Peter\nwould deny Christ under these circumstances [see C 26\u20137 and Gr\n312\u20133]. Furthermore, those who held this view generally held that it\nwas in virtue of divine concurrence that God makes the proposition\ntrue in the actual world. So, in virtue of causally influencing Peter\nat the moment of his decision, God brings it about that Peter denies\nChrist in these circumstances.\n\n\nThis view obviously faces a number of difficulties. For our\npurposes, the most pressing one is that it seems to undercut Leibniz's\nsolution to the holiness problem based on permission. For if the above\nproposition is true because God wills that it be true, then it would seem that\nGod wills that Peter sin, and if he wills that Peter sin, he cannot\nmerely permit it, in light of condition (1) of the definition of\npermission given above. Consequently, it appears that Leibniz must abandon his\ninitial answer to the question of \u201cwhat makes conditional future\ncontingents true\u201d and adopt the alternative answer.\n\n\nThe alternative answer also raises problems. What does it mean to say\nthat the truth of the proposition is determined independently of God's\nwill? Defenders of this view usually hold that the human will cannot\nbe determined. When an agent chooses freely, nothing can\n\u201cdetermine\u201d or \u201ccause\u201d the choice, for\notherwise the ehoice would not be free. Thus, for those who defended\nthis view, the answer to the question of \u201cwhat makes conditional\nfuture contingents true\u201d ought to be \u201cnothing.\u201d For\nif something made future contingents true, then that\nthing would determine the choice, and the choice would not be\nfree.\n\n\nGiven his commitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, however,\nLeibniz could not endorse such a view. Does Leibniz, then, have an\nanswer to this question that will rescue him from the holiness\nproblem? There is scholarly disagreement about this issue. Some have\nheld that Leibniz is obliged to hold the postvolitional view despite\nthe difficulties that it raises for him. [See Davidson (1996), Sleigh\n(1994).] Others have held that Leibniz tried to forge a third\nalternative in order to avoid this seemingly intractable dilemma. [See\nMurray (2005); for an alternative to Murray (2005), see Cover and\nHawthorne (2000)]. I will close by considering the latter\nsuggestion.\n\n\nAccording to Leibniz, free choice in humans is brought about through\nthe activity of the human intellect and the human will working in\nconcert with each other. The intellect deliberates about alternatives\nand selects the one that it perceives to be the best, all things\nconsidered. The intellect then represents this alternative to the will\nas the best course of action. The will, which Leibniz takes to be an\n \u201cappetite for the good,\u201d, then chooses the\nalternative represented to it as containing the most goodness\n[Theodicy, 311 (H 314; G VI 300\u20131].\n\n\nOn this view, it appears that there are two ways in which I might\nexercise \u201ccontrol\u201d over my acts of will. First, I might be\nable to control what appears to me to be the best course of action,\nall things considered. That is, I might control the process of\ndeliberation. Second, I might be able to control which alternative is\npresented to the will as containing the greatest good.  Leibniz seems\nto accept both of these possibilities. In certain passages, he argues\nthat by engaging in some sort of moral therapy, I can control which\nthings appear to me to be good, and thus control the outcome of my\ndeliberations. In other passages, he seems to say that while the will\ndoes \u201cinfallibly\u201d choose that which the intellect deems to\nbe the best, the will nevertheless retains the power to resist the\nintellect because the intellect does not \u201ccause\u201d the will\nto choose as it does.  [Concerning the first strategy, see, for\nexample, Reflections on Hobbes, 5 (H 396\u20137; G VI 391\u20131). For\nmore on this aspect of Leibniz's view of freedom see Seidler\n(1985). Concerning the second strategy see, for\nexample Theodicy 282 (H 298\u2013300; G VI 284\u20135).]\n\n\nBoth suggestions face difficulties.  Consider the first. How might I\ngo about engaging in \u201cmoral therapy\u201d?  First, I would have\nto choose to do something to begin to bring about a change in how I\nsee things. But of course I can make a choice to do this only if I\nfirst deliberate about it and see that making this change is the best\nthing for me to do. But did I have control over this process of\n\u201ccoming to see that a change is the best thing for me to\ndo\u201d? It seems that I may have control here only if I have\ncontrol over the actions that led me to see things this way in the\nfirst place. But do I have control over those actions? If the answer\nis yes, it is only because I had control over my prior deliberations,\nand it looks as if this will lead us back in the chain of explanation\nto certain very early formative stages of my moral and intellectual\nlife, stages over which it is hard to believe I had any control. It\ntherefore seems that this line of reasoning will be difficult to\nsustain.\n\n\nLet us consider the second alternative then, according to which I have\ncontrol because the will is never \u201ccausally determined\u201d to\nchoose that which the intellect deems to be best in those\ncircumstances.  Leibniz holds that the will is not causally determined\nin the act of choice but merely \u201cmorally necessitated.\u201d\nThere is scholarly disagreement about the interpretation of this\nphrase. Some think it just means \u201ccausally necessitated.\u201d\nBut if this is right, it appears that God, who establishes the laws of\nnature, determines how creatures act, and this leads us back to the\nsuggestion that Leibniz was a postvolitionalist in these matters. As\nwe noted above, this is a troubling position for Leibniz to adopt\nsince it seems to undermine his response to the holiness problem. [For\nvarious positions on the nature of \u201cmoral necessity,\u201d see\nAdams, pp. 21\u20132, Sleigh (2000), Murray (1995), pp. 95\u2013102,\nand (1996), esp. Section IV].\n\n\nOthers have held that moral necessity is a philosophical novelty,\ninvented to explain the unique relationship between intellect and will.\nOn this view, the will infallibly follows the determination of the intellect,\nwithout thereby being causally determined. Leibniz sometimes hints at\nthis reading, as in the following example derived from Pierre\nNicole:\nIt is considered impossible that a wise and serious\nmagistrate, who has not taken leave of his senses, should publicly\ncommit some outrageous action, as it would be, for instance, to run\nabout the streets naked in order to make people laugh [Theodicy 282\n(H299; G VI 284)]\n\n\nHere, the wise magistrate is not causally determined to refrain from\nstreaking to make people laugh. Instead, he just considers streaking\nto be so unseemly that \u201che can't bring himself to do it.\u201d\nSomething about his psychological constitution prevents him from\nseeing this as something that he might actually do, even though there\nis surely some sense in which he nevertheless\ncould do it. \n\n\nIf we allow Leibniz to locate control over actions in a will that is\nonly morally necessitated by the intellect, is there a way for him to\navoid the postvolitional/prevolitional dilemma discussed earlier? The\nanswer is not obvious. One would have to say that the will's\ninfallibly choosing in accordance with the deliverances of the intellect\nis a fact whose truth is independent of God's will, while\nalso saying that the deliverances of the intellect provide a\nsufficient reason for the will's choice. If this can be done,\nLeibniz may have a way of avoiding the difficulty posed by conditional\nfuture contingents.\n\n\nHowever we might think these questions should be resolved, Leibniz\nhimself appears to have thought that the prevolitional route was the\none to take. He does not think that God makes it the case how human\nbeings would act if they were created; rather, Leibniz believes God\n\"discovers\" in the ideas of the possibles how human beings would act\nif they were created [on this topic see Sleigh (1994).] [Leibniz\nspeaks of these truths about how human beings will act as\n\u201climitations\u201d that prevent God from making them, and the\nworld that contains them, more perfect. In the end, it is these\nlimitations, Leibniz argues, that prevent there from being a better\nworld than the actual one. [On the notion of \u201climitations\u201d\nsee AG 60\u20132, 11, Theodicy 20 (H 86\u20137; G VI\n114\u20135), Causa Dei 69\u201371 (S 128\u201330;\n457\u20138).] If this interpretation is correct, then we might think\nthat the permission strategy will work as a solution to the holiness\nproblem both when it comes to defending God as creator and as\nconcurrent cause of all effects in the cosmos.\n\n\nInterestingly, however, Leibniz comes to favor, in later life, the\nscholastic \u201cprivation\u201d view that he rejected in his\nearliest writings on the problem of evil. [See, for\nexample, Theodicy 20, 30, 153 (respectively, H 86\u20137,\n91\u20132, 219\u201320; G VI 114\u20135, 119\u201320, 201.]\nLeibniz's conception of privation in general, and the relation between\nhis earlier and later views on the topic, has recently received a\nsustained and searching examination in Newlands (forthcoming), to\nwhich readers interested in the topic are directed.\n\n\nThe issues that arise in thinking about Leibniz's views on the problem\nof evil have only in the past couple of decades begun to receive the\nsustained scholarly attention that they deserve in virtue of their\nmanifest significance for Leibniz.  In the last few years in\nparticular\u2013\u2013probably not coincidentally, the\nthree-hundredth anniversary of the publication of\nthe Theodicy was celebrated in 2010\u2013\u2013considerable\ninterpretive attention has been devoted to the details of Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil and related topics.  [Rateau (2008)\nis the first book-length treatment of Leibniz's work on the problem of\nevil; the essays in Rateau (2011) and Newlands and Jorgensen\n(forthcoming) are devoted to particular topics related to Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil.]  Given the fact that Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil draws on medieval sources and also\nwas taken as a target by later writers such as Voltaire and Kant,\nrenewed interest in Leibniz's treatment of the problem of evil,\ncombined with the resurgence of interest in contextual history of\nphilosophy, have inspired recent work on the general historical\nsignificance of Leibniz's work on the problem of evil that seeks to\nilluminate later approaches to the problem of evil as well as the\nnature of the problem of evil itself.  [See, inter alia,\nLarrimore (2004), Neiman (2002), and the essays in Rateau (2009).]  In\nlight of the fact that new translations of Leibniz's central texts\ndevoted to the problem of evil have either only relatively recently\nbeen published (CP) or are in process\u2013\u2013a new edition and\nEnglish translation of the Theodicy, by Sean Greenberg and\nR. C. Sleigh, Jr., is well underway and under contract with Oxford\nUniversity Press\u2013and given that other new texts, like DPW, that\nbear on this nest of issues may well be discovered, there is reason to\nexpect that this topic will continue to be an active area of Leibniz\nscholarship, and therefore that any conclusions about Leibniz's views\non the problem of evil must, for now, remain tentative and subject to\nrevision.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": "</h3>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">[<strong>A</strong>]</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><em>S\u00e4mtliche Schriften und Briefe</em> .\nDarmstadt and Berlin: Berlin Academy, 1923-.
