    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || An Argument from Epistemic Modesty\n3.4 An Argument from Epistemic Modesty\n\n\nAccording to Martin, properly understood, disjunctivism offers us an\nepistemological perspective on how we should conceive of debates about\nperceptual experience. Martin suggests that the key to the disjunctive\napproach lies not in its appeal to paraphrasing claims about experience\nin disjunctive form, but rather in its appeal to the epistemic notion\nof indiscriminability in explicating the claims we make about\nperceptual experience. (For detailed discussion of the notion of\ndiscriminability, see Williamson 1990). Martin suggests that what is\ndistinctive of the disjunctive approach is the \u2018modesty\u2019 of\nthe claims it makes about what one can know about one\u2019s\nperceptual experiences. In contrast, the alternatives to the\ndisjunctive approach are \u2018immodest\u2019 in their assumptions\nabout our epistemic powers. The alternatives to the disjunctive\napproach that Martin appears to have in mind here are those versions of\nthe common element view that hold that (a) there are phenomenal\nproperties that are common to perceptions, illusions, and\nhallucinations, and (b) the possession of such properties is both\nnecessary and sufficient for an event to be a conscious perceptual\nexperience.\n\n\nMartin\u2019s argument for the claim that the alternatives to the\ndisjunctive approach incur greater epistemic burdens primarily focuses\non our understanding of the notion of a perfect hallucination.\nSceptical arguments often introduce talk of \u2018perfect\nhallucinations\u2019. On one understanding such talk is taken to\nbe introducing the notion of a conscious mental event that is not a\ngenuine perception but which is introspectively indiscriminible from a\ngenuine perception of the world. An assumption often\nmade is that such an experience would have the same phenomenal\nproperties as some possible genuine perception. But from the fact that\na conscious mental event is introspectively indiscriminible from a\ngenuine perception, does it follow that must have the same\nphenomenal properties as a genuine perception?\n\n\nSuppose we answer that this does not follow\u2014i.e., we accept that\nit may be possible, in principle, for there to occur a conscious\nmental event that is introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception, but which does not have the same phenomenal properties as\na genuine perception. Should we say that such events count as\nperceptual experiences? If one denies that such mental events should\nbe regarded as perceptual experiences, then, Martin suggests, one owes\nsome kind of justification for this denial, for this stance on what is\nrequired for a mental event to be a perceptual experience will seem,\nfrom a common sense perspective, to be too restrictive. On the other\nhand, if one holds that such mental events should be regarded as\nperceptual experiences, then this suggests that our most inclusive\nnotion of what it is for something to be a perceptual experience is an\nepistemic one\u2014that of being introspectively indiscriminible from\na genuine perception\u2014which does not involve the further\nmetaphysical assumption that perceptual experiences which aren\u2019t\ngenuine perceptions must have the same phenomenal properties as\ngenuine perceptions.\n\n\nNow suppose instead that we say that if a conscious mental event is\nintrospectively indiscriminible from a genuine perception it has the\nsame phenomenal properties as a genuine perception. According to Martin\nthis would be to embrace a substantive epistemic principle. For in\nadopting this stance one would be committed to the epistemic claim that\nin the case of any conscious mental event that lacks the phenomenal\nproperties of a genuine perception, the fact that it lacks the relevant\nphenomenal properties will be something that is knowable through\nintrospection. According to such a view, it is not just that the\nphenomenal properties that determine an event as an experience are held\nto be introspectively detectible and recognisible as such when present.\nIt must also be the case that the absence of such properties, when they\nare absent, is equally detectible through introspection.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, given that this approach to perceptual\nexperience needs to rely on this epistemic assumption, it carries more\ntheoretical burdens than does the more \u201cmodest\u201d\ndisjunctivist approach. For when it comes to characterizing the notion\nof perceptual experience in general, the disjunctive approach\nemphasizes the limits of our powers of discrimination, rather\nthan appealing to a substantive condition that an event must meet to be\nan experience, and in addition ascribing to us cognitive powers to\nrecognize the presence of this substantive condition. So, according to Martin, the\nburden is really on the common element theorist, either to show that\nthe extra epistemic commitment is one we should accept, or\nalternatively, to justify the claim that those conscious mental events\nthat are introspectively indiscriminible from genuine perceptions but\nwhich lack the phenomenal properties of genuine perceptions should not\nbe regarded as a perceptual experiences. This argument does not purport\nto show that the common element view is wrong, but rather to show that\nthe default position should be that of the disjunctivist.\n\n\nVarious objections have been raised against Martin\u2019s proposal.\nSome object to Martin\u2019s suggestion that being subjectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception is a sufficient condition\nfor being a perceptual experience. Siegel (2004 and 2008), Hawthorne\nand Kovakovich (2006), Smith (2008), and Byrne and Logue (2008) push\nthis line of objection. In effect, such objectors may be seen as\nattempting to meet one of Martin\u2019s challenges by offering reason\nto think that our notion of perceptual experience is, after all, more\nrestrictive than the epistemically characterised one he proposes.\nSiegel objects that a cognitively unsophisticated creature, such as a\ndog, will be incapable of introspectively discriminating the\nexperiences they have. So we cannot appeal to the notion of subjective\nindiscriminability in our account of what makes it the case that the\ndog has a perceptual experience of an F. Byrne and Logue\n(2008) and Smith (2008) object that even in the case of a cognitively\nsophisticated subject we should not rule out the possibility of the\noccurrence of a conscious mental event that is not a perceptual\nexperience, but which is subjectively indiscriminible from a veridical\nperception. For example, it might be argued that we should deny that\nepisodes of perceptual imagining (e.g., visualising) are perceptual\nexperiences, and we should allow that it may be possible for an\nepisode of visualising to be subjectively indiscriminible from a\nveridical perception. One might think that just such episodes occur\nwhen one is dreaming. (For example, see Ichikawa 2009). Keith Allen\n(2015), on the other hand, argues that hallucinations are degenerate\nkinds of sensory imagination and that the view that hallucination is a\nkind of sensory imagination represents a promising account of\nhallucination from the perspective of a na\u00efve realist theory of\nperception like na\u00efve realism.\n\n\nIf one does allow that conscious mental events of different kinds\n(e.g., perceptual experiences and perceptual imaginings) can be\nintrospectively indiscriminible, then it seems that one\u2019s defence\nof the claim that perfect hallucinations and genuine perceptions are\nevents of the same fundamental kind cannot simply appeal to the fact\nthat they are introspectively indiscriminible. One might, nonetheless,\nthink that there is introspective support for the claim that genuine\nperceptions have phenomenal properties which are such that (i) an\nevent\u2019s possession of them is independent of the conditions of\nperception, and (ii) an event\u2019s possession of them is sufficient\nto account for the fact that the event is introspectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception. One might then simply define\n\u2018perfect hallucinations\u2019 as those experiences that are not\ngenuine perceptions, but which have the same phenomenal properties as\ngenuine perceptions. (See section 3.3 for discussion of Martin\u2019s\npositive argument for Na\u00efve Realism, which can be seen as an\nattempt to challenge such claims.)\n\n\nAccording to another line of objection, Martin is wrong to propose\nthat being introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine perception is\na necessary condition for being a conscious perceptual experience. For\nalthough being introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception may be a condition satisfied by all genuine perceptions and\nperfect hallucinations had by subjects capable of making\nintrospective judgements about their perceptual experiences, it is not\na condition that need be satisfied by other perceptual\nexperiences. For instance, Siegel (2004) argues that experiences as of\nimpossible scenes\u2014e.g., experiences as of certain Escher\nscenes\u2014do not satisfy this condition.\n\n\nSiegel (2004) also suggests that, properly understood, the epistemic\nburden incurred by the common element theorist is not so great after\nall, as it leaves open the possibility that subjects may make all kinds\nof mistakes about the kinds of experiences they are having. One\u2019s\nview on whether or not the epistemic commitment that is being\nattributed to the common element theorist by Martin is excessively\nburdensome may depend, in part, on how one understands the notion of\nintrospective indiscriminability in play in his argument. This may also\naffect how plausible one finds the claim that being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a genuine perception is necessary and sufficient\nfor being a perceptual experience. Martin\u2019s views on these issues\nare discussed further in section 5.1.\n",
