In 1934, he considered an analysis in terms of his\ngeneralized concept of recursion\u2014about a year before Church\nfirst publicly announced his thesis that \u201cthe notion of an\neffectively calculable function of positive integers should be\nidentified with that of a recursive function\u201d (Church 1935a;\nG\u00f6del 1934, fn. 3; Davis 1982).\n\nBut G\u00f6del was doubtful: \u201cI was, at the time \u2026 not at\nall convinced that my concept of recursion comprises all possible\nrecursions\u201d (G\u00f6del 1965b). It was Turing\u2019s analysis,\nG\u00f6del emphasized, that finally enabled him to generalize his\nincompleteness theorems:\n\n\ndue to A. M. Turing\u2019s work, a precise and unquestionably\nadequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be\ngiven. (G\u00f6del 1965a: 71)\n\n\nHe explained:\n\n\nTuring\u2019s work gives an analysis of the concept of\n\u201cmechanical procedure\u201d (alias \u201calgorithm\u201d or\n\u201ccomputation procedure\u201d or \u201cfinite combinatorial\nprocedure\u201d). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of\na \u201cTuring machine\u201d. A formal system can simply be defined\nto be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable\nformulas. (G\u00f6del 1965a: 71\u201372)\n\n\nArmed with this definition, incompleteness can, G\u00f6del said,\n\u201cbe proved rigorously for every consistent formal\nsystem containing a certain amount of finitary number theory\u201d\n(1965a: 71).\n",
