It was typical for many philosophers to\nconstrue experience narrowly, as the private contents of\nconsciousness. These contents might be perceptions (sensing), or\nreflections (calculating, associating, imagining) done by the\nsubjective mind. Some, such as Plato and Descartes, denigrated\nexperience as a flux which confused or diverted rational inquiry.\nOthers, such as Hume and Locke, thought that experience (as atomic\nsensations) provided the mind at least some resources for\nknowing, albeit with reduced ambitions. Both general philosophical\napproaches agreed that percepts and concepts were\ndifferent and in tension; they agreed that sensation was perspectival\nand context-relative; they also agreed that this relativity\nproblematized the assumed mission of philosophy\u2014to know\nwith certainty\u2014and differed only about the degree of the\nproblem.\n\nDewey disputed the shared empiricist conviction that sensations are\ncategorically separable contents of consciousness. This belief, he\nargued, produced a \u201cwhole epistemological industry\u201d\ndevoted to solving the general problem of \u201ccorrespondence\u201d\nand a host of specific puzzles (about the existence of an external\nworld, other minds, free will, etc.) (\u201cPropositions, Warranted\nAssertibility, and Truth\u201d, LW14: 179). This\n\u201cindustry\u201d isolates philosophy from empirically informed\naccounts of experience and from pressing, practical problems.\nRegarding the phenomenon of mental privacy, Dewey argued that while we\nhave episodes of what might be called mental interiority, it is a later\nhuman development. \u201cPersonality, selfhood, subjectivity, are\neventual functions that emerge with complexly organized interactions,\norganic and social\u201d (EN, LW1: 162; see also\n178\u201379). Regarding sensorial atomicity, discussed previously in\nthe section on psychology, Dewey explained sensation as embedded in a\nlarger sensori-motor circuit, a transaction which should not be\nquarantined to any single phase\u2014nor to consciousness. Sensation\nemerges dynamically from the engagements of minds, bodies, and their\nenvironments, where \u201cenvironments\u201d includes human language\nand culture. (Consider, as evidence of how blurry the boundaries\nbetween \u201csensation\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d can be, how\ndifferently food tastes in varying circumstances and cultures.)\n\nDewey levied similar criticisms against traditional accounts of\nreflective thought. Mind is neither static nor a substance which\nstands, somehow, apart from the body\u2014or from history, from\nculture. Reasoning is one function of mind, not the product of a\nseparate \u201cfaculty\u201d, and not \u201cpurified\u201d of\nfeeling. Rather, reasoning is always permeated with both feelings and\npractical exigencies. While it can help to \u201cbracket out\u201d a\nfeeling or exigency scrambling a present calculation, it is\nnevertheless true that reasoning subsists in a wider\n\u201cqualitative world\u201d, one that \u201cforms the field of\ncharacteristic modes of thinking, characteristic in that thought is\ndefinitely regulated by qualitative considerations\u201d\n(\u201cPsychology and Work\u201d, LW5: 243).\n",
