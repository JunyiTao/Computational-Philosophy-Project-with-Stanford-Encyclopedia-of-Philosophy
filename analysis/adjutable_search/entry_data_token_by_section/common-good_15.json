Conclusion: Social Justice and the Common Good\n\nThis article has covered the main points of agreement and disagreement among\ndifferent conceptions of the common good, as well as a few central\ntopics of concern. Let me conclude by saying something about the\nrelation between the common good and social justice.\n\nConsider the case of friendship. Friendship is a social relationship\nthat requires those who stand in the relationship to think and act in\nways that embody a particular form of mutual concern. The relevant\nform of concern incorporates the basic requirements of\nmorality\u2014i.e., what Scanlon (1998) calls \u201cthe morality of\nright and wrong\u201d\u2014as friends must not lie to each other,\nassault each other, or take unfair advantage of each other. But even\nstrangers are required to conform to these basic moral standards. What\ndistinguishes friendship is that the form of mutual concern it\ninvolves goes beyond basic morality and requires friends to maintain\ncertain patterns of conduct on the grounds that these patterns serve certain\ncommon interests.\n\nMembers of a political community stand in a social relationship, and\nthis relationship also requires them to think and act in ways that\nembody a certain form of mutual concern. The common good defines this\nform of concern. The common good incorporates certain basic\nrequirements of social justice, as citizens must provide one another\nwith basic rights and freedoms and they must not exploit each other.\nBut the common good goes beyond the basic requirements of justice\nbecause it requires citizens to maintain certain patterns of conduct\non the grounds that these patterns serve certain common interests.\n\nThe analogy with friendship should make it clear that the common good\nis distinct from, but still closely related to social justice.\nAccording to most of the major traditional views, the facilities and\ninterests that members of a political community have a relational\nobligation to care about are partly defined in terms of social\njustice. For instance, Rousseau (1762b), Hegel (1821) and Rawls (1971)\nall hold that a basic system of private property is both a requirement of\njustice and an element of the common good. Similarly, in Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights, Finnis holds that respect for human\nrights is a requirement of justice and that \u201cthe maintenance of\nhuman rights is a fundamental component of the common good\u201d\n(1980: 218). But the common good goes beyond the requirements of\njustice because (1) it describes a pattern of inner motivation, not\njust a pattern of outer conduct and (2) it may incorporate facilities\nand interests that are not general requirements of justice.\n\nAll of this leaves us with some important questions. Many contemporary\nsocial issues turn on disagreements about when citizens may take up a\nprivatized perspective and when they must reason from the standpoint\nof the common good. Social justice is often silent on these issues\nbecause people could, in principle, act as justice requires, whether\nthey are moved by a scheme of private incentives or by a concern for\ncommon interests. These social issues are best understood as turning\non disagreements about the nature of the political relationship and\nthe form of mutual concern that it requires. Philosophical reflection\nhas an important role to play in shedding light on this relationship\nand what it requires of us beyond what we owe to each other as a\nmatter of justice.\n",
