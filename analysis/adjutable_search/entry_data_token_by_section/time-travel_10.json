Time and Change\nG\u00f6del (1949 [1990a])\u2014in which G\u00f6del presents\nmodels of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity in which there\nexist CTC\u2019s\u2014can well be regarded as initiating the modern\nacademic literature on time travel, in both philosophy and physics. In\na companion paper, G\u00f6del discusses the significance of his\nresults for more general issues in the philosophy of time (G\u00f6del\n1949a [1990b]). For the following half century, the time travel\nliterature focussed predominantly on objections to the possibility (or\nprobability) of time travel. More recently, however, there has been\nrenewed interest in the connections between time travel and more\ngeneral issues in the metaphysics of time and change. We examine some\nof these in the present\n section.[25]\n\n\nThe first thing that we need to do is set up the various metaphysical\npositions whose relationships with time travel will then be\ndiscussed. Consider two metaphysical questions:\n\nAre the past, present and future equally real? \nIs there an objective flow or passage of time, and an objective now?\n\nWe can label some views on the first question as\nfollows. Eternalism is the view that past and future times,\nobjects and events are just as real as the present time and present\nevents and objects. Nowism is the view that only the present\ntime and present events and objects exist. Now-and-then-ism\nis the view that the past and present exist but the future does\nnot. We can also label some views on the second\nquestion. The A-theory answers in the affirmative: the flow\nof time and division of events into past (before now), present (now)\nand future (after now) are objective features of reality (as opposed\nto mere features of our experience). Furthermore, they are linked: the\nobjective flow of time arises from the movement, through time, of the\nobjective now (from the past towards the\nfuture). The B-theory answers in the negative: while we\ncertainly experience now as special, and time as flowing, the B-theory\ndenies that what is going on here is that we are detecting objective\nfeatures of reality in a way that corresponds transparently to how\nthose features are in themselves. The flow of time and the now are not\nobjective features of reality; they are merely features of our\nexperience. By combining answers to our first and second questions we\narrive at positions on the metaphysics of time such\nas:[26]\n\nthe block universe view: eternalism + B-theory \nthe moving spotlight view: eternalism + A-theory \nthe presentist view: nowism + A-theory \nthe growing block view: now-and-then-ism + A-theory.\n\n\n\nSo much for positions on time itself. Now for some views on temporal\nobjects: objects that exist in (and, in general, change over)\ntime. Three-dimensionalism is the view that persons, tables\nand other temporal objects are three-dimensional entities. On this\nview, what you see in the mirror is a whole\nperson.[27]\nTomorrow, when you look again, you will see the whole person again. On\nthis view, persons and other temporal objects are wholly\npresent at every time at which they\nexist. Four-dimensionalism is the view that persons, tables\nand other temporal objects are four-dimensional entities, extending\nthrough three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. On this\nview, what you see in the mirror is not a whole person: it is just a\nthree-dimensional temporal part of a person. Tomorrow, when you look\nagain, you will see a different such temporal part. Say that an\nobject persists through time if it is around at some time and\nstill around at a later time. Three- and four-dimensionalists agree\nthat (some) objects persist, but they differ over how objects\npersist. According to three-dimensionalists, objects persist\nby enduring: an object persists from t1\nto t2 by being wholly present\nat t1 and t2 and every instant in\nbetween. According to four-dimensionalists, objects persist\nby perduring: an object persists from t1\nto t2 by having temporal parts\nat t1 and t2 and every instant in\nbetween. Perduring can be usefully compared with being extended in\nspace: a road extends from Melbourne to Sydney not by being wholly\nlocated at every point in between, but by having a spatial part at\nevery point in between.\n\n\nIt is natural to combine three-dimensionalism with presentism and\nfour-dimensionalism with the block universe view\u2014but other\ncombinations of views are certainly possible.\n",
