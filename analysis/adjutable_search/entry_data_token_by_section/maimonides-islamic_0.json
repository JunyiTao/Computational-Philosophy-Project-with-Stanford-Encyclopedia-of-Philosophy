    "main_text": "Methodological Preamble\n1. Methodological Preamble\n\n\nHighlighting the importance of understanding Maimonides within the\ncontext of his Islamic intellectual milieu, Kraemer begins his\nmagisterial study of Maimonides\u2019 life and works with the following\nquote:\nWe are the children of our landscape. (Lawrence Durrell,\nJustine)\n\ngoing on to note that\n\nOnly when we read Arabic sources can we have a true picture of this\nperiod, identify the actors in this drama, and have reliable knowledge\nof circumstances and events. (Kraemer 2010, 15).\n\n\nIn this spirit, Kraemer\u2019s study draws strongly on Arabic historical,\nliterary, philosophical, and other sources to situate Maimonides\u2019\nthinking. Sensitive to this contextual approach, Pines begins his\nedition and translation of the Guide with a consideration of myriad\nIslamic (and Greek) philosophical sources, and while Hyman notes that\n\u201cit should not\u2026be inferred that medieval Jewish\nphilosophy was a branch of Islamic philosophy,\u201d he goes on to note\nthat \u201cby and large Jewish philosophy was a continuation of the\nphilosophy which flourished in the Islamic world\u201d (Hyman 1996,\n678-679). Sensitive to the impact of the Islamic context, Stroumsa\nreminds us that \u201c\u2026Maimonides was an avid reader, who took\npains to remain abreast of contemporary scholarship in general and\nphilosophical scholarship in particular\u2026 \u201d (Stroumsa\n2009, 173, n. 69), and \u201cthat Maimonides, who only rarely cited\nhis sources, read all he could find, and that he had no qualms about\nperusing the theological or legal works of non-Jews\u2026\u201d (Stroumsa\n2009, xii). Responding to Davidson\u2019s more conservative approach to\nreading sources into the \n text,[2]\n Stroumsa adds, \u201cMaimonides\u2019\nphilosophical erudition was no doubt far broader than would seem to be\nthe case only on the basis of his explicit references. We must\ntherefore be alert to the possibility that Maimonides\u2019 words reflect,\nwhether by way of acceptance or by way of reaction and criticism, his\nknowledge of the works of thinkers whose names are not explicitly\nmentioned\u201d (Stroumsa 2009, 24-5).\n\n",
