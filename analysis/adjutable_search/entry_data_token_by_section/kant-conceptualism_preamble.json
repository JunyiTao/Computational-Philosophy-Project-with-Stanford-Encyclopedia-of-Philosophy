    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the central areas of dispute in the reception of Kant\u2019s\ncritical philosophy concerns his distinction between the cognitive\nfaculties of sensibility (Sinnlichkeit) and intellect\n(Verstand), and their characteristic representational\noutputs\u2014viz. intuition (Anschauung) and concept\n(Begriff). Though the dispute is multi-faceted, it centers on\ndisagreement concerning the interpretation of Kant\u2019s conception\nof the contribution made by the higher cognitive faculties (or the\n\u201cintellect\u201d in the broadest sense of that term) to a\nsubject\u2019s sensory apprehension of the world around it. The\nstatus of Kant\u2019s distinction has been repeatedly questioned. In\nthe immediate reception of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy, major\nworks by figures such as Solomon Maimon (Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, 1790) and G.W.F. Hegel (Faith and Knowledge,\n1802) criticized the coherence of construing sensibility and intellect\nas independent faculties. The issue has also seen significant\ndiscussion in the latter half of the twentieth-century by Anglophone\nphilosophers such as P.F. Strawson, Wilfrid Sellars, and John\nMcDowell. Their work takes up Kant\u2019s distinction between\nintuition and concept as an important vehicle for asking and answering\nquestions regarding the relation between thought and reality. Such\nquestions include both the issue of how thought could be so much as\nabout an objective reality (Strawson 1959: ch. 2; McDowell\n1994a; Ginsborg 2006b), and the issue of how sense experiences caused\nby a subject\u2019s environment could have a normative, rather than\nmerely causal, significance for the subject\u2019s thinking (Sellars\n1968; McDowell 1994b).\n\nHence, the debate over the relation between intuition and concept is\nof significant historical and philosophical interest for at least two\nreasons. First, because it promises to provide answers to central\nquestions in Kant\u2019s conception of experience, such as those\nconcerning the acquisition of the content of thought and the\nwarrant for holding such thoughts as true. Second, because it\nserves as proxy for a related, and perhaps even more fundamental,\ndispute concerning Kant\u2019s conception of the nature of\nrationality and its manifestation in animal life, particularly insofar\nas rationality is conceived as requiring sensitivity to norms or\nreasons as such (McDowell 2009, 2010; Korsgaard 2011: \u00a76).\n\nDespite, and perhaps because of, the foundational nature of the\ninterpretive and philosophical issues involved here, a significant\nnumber of the interpretive issues regarding Kant\u2019s view turn\nsimply on the way in which the dispute is framed. Indeed, much of the\ngood work in the last twenty-five years or so concerning the relation\nbetween intuition and concept has served largely to clarify the terms\nand fundamental points at issue between disputants. To that end, this\nentry surveys both the basic framing assumptions of the dispute\n(\u00a7\u00a71\u20134) and various loci of disagreement within it\n(\u00a75).\n",
