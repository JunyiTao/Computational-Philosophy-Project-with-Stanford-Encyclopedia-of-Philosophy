    "main_text": "Advanced Modal Logic\n12. Advanced Modal Logic\n\nThe applications of modal logic to mathematics and computer science\nhave become increasingly important. Provability logic is only one\nexample of this trend. The term \u201cadvanced modal logic\u201d\nrefers to a tradition in modal logic research that is particularly\nwell represented in departments of mathematics and computer science.\nThis tradition has been woven into the history of modal logic right\nfrom its beginnings (Goldblatt, 2006). Research into relationships\nwith topology and algebras represents some of the very first technical\nwork on modal logic. However the term \u2018advanced modal\nlogic\u2019 generally refers to a second wave of work done since the\nmid 1970s. Some examples of the many interesting topics dealt with\ninclude results on decidability (whether it is possible to compute\nwhether a formula of a given modal logic is a theorem) and complexity\n(the costs in time and memory needed to compute such facts about modal\nlogics). The next two sections describe examples of research in this\ntradition.\n",
