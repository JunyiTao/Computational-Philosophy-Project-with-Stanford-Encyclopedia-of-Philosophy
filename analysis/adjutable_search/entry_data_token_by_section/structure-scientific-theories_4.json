    "main_text": "The Syntactic View || Theory Structure per the Syntactic View\n2.1 Theory Structure per the Syntactic View\n\nSome conceptual taxonomy is required in order to understand the\nlogical framework of the structure of scientific theories for the\nSyntactic View. We shall distinguish terms,\nsentences, and languages (see Table 1). \n2.1.1 Terms\n\nBuilding upwards from the bottom, let us start with the three kinds of\nterms or vocabularies contained in a scientific language: theoretical,\nlogical, and observational. Examples of theoretical terms are\n\u201cmolecule,\u201d \u201catom,\u201d \u201cproton,\u201d and\n\u201cprotein,\u201d and perhaps even macro-level objects and properties\nsuch as \u201cproletariat\u201d and \u201caggregate demand.\u201d\nTheoretical terms or concepts can be classificatory (e.g.,\n\u201ccat\u201d or \u201cproton\u201d), comparative (e.g.,\n\u201cwarmer\u201d), or quantitative (e.g.,\n\u201ctemperature\u201d) (Hempel 1952; Carnap 1966, Chapter 5).\nMoreover, theoretical terms are \u201ctheoretical constructs\u201d\nintroduced \u201cjointly\u201d as a \u201ctheoretical system\u201d\n(Hempel 1952, 32). Logical terms include quantifiers (e.g., \\(\\forall,\n\\exists\\)) and connectives (e.g., \\(\\wedge, \\rightarrow\\)). Predicates\nsuch as \u201chard,\u201d \u201cblue,\u201d and \u201chot,\u201d\nand relations such as \u201cto the left of\u201d and \u201csmoother\nthan,\u201d are observational terms. \n2.1.2 Sentences\n\nTerms can be strung together into three kinds of sentences:\ntheoretical, correspondence, and observational. \\(T_S\\) is the set of\ntheoretical sentences that are the axioms, theorems, and laws of the\ntheory. Theoretical sentences include the laws of Newtonian mechanics\nand of the Kinetic Theory of Gases, all suitably axiomatized (e.g.,\nCarnap 1966; Hempel 1966). Primitive theoretical sentences (e.g.,\naxioms) can be distinguished from derivative theoretical sentences\n(e.g., theorems; see Reichenbach 1969 [1924]; Hempel 1958; Feigl\n1970). \\(C_S\\) is the set of correspondence sentences tying\ntheoretical sentences to observable phenomena or \u201cto a\n\u2018piece of reality\u2019\u201d (Reichenbach 1969 [1924], 8; cf.\nEinstein 1934, 1936 [1936], 351). To simplify, they provide the\ntheoretical syntax with an interpretation and an application, i.e., a\nsemantics. Suitably axiomatized version of the following sentences\nprovide semantics to Boyle\u2019s law, \\(PV = nRT\\): \u201c\\(V\\) in\nBoyle\u2019s law is equivalent to the measurable volume \\(xyz\\) of a\nphysical container such as a glass cube that is \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and\n\\(z\\) centimeters in length, width, and height, and in which the gas\nmeasured is contained\u201d and \u201c\\(T\\) in Boyle\u2019s law is\nequivalent to the temperature indicated on a reliable thermometer or\nother relevant measuring device properly calibrated, attached to the\nphysical system, and read.\u201d Carnap (1987 [1932], 466) presents\ntwo examples of observational sentences, \\(O_S\\): \u201cHere (in a\nlaboratory on the surface of the earth) is a pendulum of such and such\na kind,\u201d and \u201cthe length of the pendulum is 245.3\ncm.\u201d Importantly, theoretical sentences can only contain\ntheoretical and logical terms; correspondence sentences involve all\nthree kinds of terms; and observational sentences comprise only\nlogical and observational terms.\n2.1.3 Languages\n\nThe total domain language of science consists of two languages: the\ntheoretical language, \\(L_T\\), and the observational language, \\(L_O\\)\n(e.g., Hempel 1966, Chapter 6; Carnap 1966, Chapter 23; the index\nentry for \u201cLanguage,\u201d of Feigl, Scriven, and Maxwell 1958,\n548 has three subheadings: \u201cobservation,\u201d\n\u201ctheoretical,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d). The\ntheoretical language includes theoretical vocabulary, while the\nobservational language involves observational terms. Both languages\ncontain logical terms. Finally, the theoretical language includes, and\nis constrained by, the logical calculus, Calc, of the\naxiomatic system adopted (e.g., Hempel 1958, 46; Suppe 1977, 50-53).\nThis calculus specifies sentence grammaticality as well as appropriate\ndeductive and non-ampliative inference rules (e.g., modus ponens)\npertinent to, especially, theoretical sentences. Calc can\nitself be written in theoretical sentences.\n2.1.4 Theory Structure, in General\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Syntactic View\u2019s account of theory\nstructure:\n\nTable 1\n\n\nTheory\nObservation \n\nSentence Type\n\\(T_S\\)\n\\(C_S\\)\n\\(O_S\\) \n\nTerm (or vocabulary)\nTheoretical & logical\nTheoretical, logical & observational\nObservational & logical \n\nLanguage\n\\(L_T\\)\n\\(L_T\\) & \\(L_O\\)\n\\(L_O\\) \n\n\nThe salient divide is between theory and observation. Building on\nTable 1, there are three different levels of scientific knowledge,\naccording to the Syntactic View:\n\n\\(\\{T_S\\} =\\) The uninterpreted syntactic system of the scientific\ntheory.\n\n\\(\\{T_S, C_S\\} =\\) The scientific theory structure of a particular\ndomain (e.g., physics, anthropology).\n\n\\(\\{T_S,C_S,O_S\\} =\\) All of the science of a particular domain. \n\nScientific theory is thus taken to be a syntactically formulated set\nof theoretical sentences (axioms, theorems, and laws) together with\ntheir interpretation via correspondence sentences. As we have seen,\ntheoretical sentences and correspondence sentences are cleanly\ndistinct, even if both are included in the structure of a scientific\ntheory.\n\nOpen questions remain. Is the observation language a sub-language of\nthe theoretical language, or are they both parts of a fuller language\nincluding all the vocabulary? Can the theoretical vocabulary or\nlanguage be eliminated in favor of a purely observational vocabulary\nor language? Are there other ways of carving up kinds of languages?\nFirst, a \u201cdialectical opposition\u201d between \u201clogic and\nexperience,\u201d \u201cform and content,\u201d \u201cconstitutive\nprinciples and empirical laws,\u201d and \u201c\u2018from\nabove\u2019\u2026 [and] \u2018from below\u2019\u201d pervades\nthe work of the syntacticists (Friedman 1999, 34, 63). Whether\nsyntacticists believe that a synthesis or unification of this general\nopposition between the theoretical (i.e., logic, form) and the\nobservational (i.e., experience, content) is desirable remains a topic\nof ongoing discussion. Regarding the second question, Hempel 1958\ndeflates what he calls \u201cthe theoretician\u2019s\ndilemma\u201d\u2014i.e., the putative reduction without remainder of\ntheoretical concepts and sentences to observational concepts and\nsentences. Finally, other language divisions are possible, as Carnap\n1937 argues (see Friedman 1999, Chapter 7). Returning to the main\nthread of this section, the distinction toolkit of theoretical and\nobservational terms, sentences, and languages (Table 1) permit the\nsyntacticists to render theoretical structure sharply, thereby aiming\nat the reconstructive \u201clogic of science\u201d\n(Wissenschafstlogik) that they so desire.\n",
