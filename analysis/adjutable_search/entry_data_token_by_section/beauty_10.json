    "main_text": "The Politics of Beauty || Colonialism and Race\n3.3 Colonialism and Race\n\nEarly in the 20th century, black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey\n(1887\u20131940) described European or white standards of beauty as a\ndeep dimension of oppression, quite similarly to the way Naomi Wolf\ndescribes beauty standards for women. These standards are relentlessly\nreinforced in authoritative images, but they are incompatible with\nblack skin, black bodies, and also traditional African ways of\nunderstanding human beauty. White standards of beauty, Garvey argued,\ndevalue black bodies. The truly oppressive aspects of such norms can\nbe seen in the way they induce self-alienation, as Wolf argues with\nregard to sexualized images of women. \u201cSome of us in America,\nthe West Indies, and Africa believe that the nearer we approach the\nwhite man in color, the greater our social standing and\nprivilege,\u201d he wrote (Garvey 1925 [1986], 56). He condemns skin\nbleaching and hair straightening as ways that black people are taught\nto devalue themselves by white standards of beauty. And he connects\nsuch standards to \u2018colorism\u2019 or prejudice in the\nAfrican-American community toward darker-skinned black people.\n\nSuch observations suggest some of the strengths of cultural relativism\nas opposed to subjectivism or universalism: standards of beauty appear\nin this picture not to be idiosyncratic to individuals, nor to be\nuniversal among all people, but to be tied to group identities and to\noppression and resistance.\n\nIn his autobiography, Malcolm X (1925\u20131965), whose parents were\nactivists in the Garvey movement, describes \u2018conking\u2019 or\nstraightening his hair with lye products as a young man. \u201cThis\nwas my first really big step toward self-degradation,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cwhen I endured all of that pain, literally burning my\nflesh to have it look like a white man\u2019s hair. I had joined that\nmultitude of Negro men and women in America who are brainwashed into\nbelieving that black people are \u2018inferior\u2019 \u2013 and\nwhite people \u2018superior\u2019 \u2013 that they will even\nviolate and mutilate their God-created bodies to try to look\n\u2018pretty\u2019 by white standards\u201d (X 1964,\n56\u20137). For both Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X, a key moment in the\ntransformation of racial oppression would be the affirmation of\nstandards of black beauty that are not parasitic on white standards,\nand hence not directly involved in racial oppression. This was\nsystematically developed after Malcolm\u2019s death in the\n\u201cnatural\u201d hairstyles and African fabrics in the Black\nPower movement. Certainly, people have many motivations for\nstraightening or coloring their hair, for example. But the critical\nexamination of the racial content of beauty norms was a key moment in\nblack liberation movements, many of which, around 1970, coalesced\naround the slogan Black is beautiful. These are critiques of\nspecific standards of beauty; they are also tributes to beauty\u2019s\npower.\n\nImposing standards of beauty on non-Western cultures, and, in\nparticular, misappropriating standards of beauty and beautiful objects\nfrom them, formed one of the most complex strategies of colonialism.\nEdward Said famously termed this dynamic \u201corientalism.\u201d\nNovelists such as Nerval and Kipling and painters such as Delacroix\nand Picasso, he argued, used motifs drawn from Asian and African\ncultures, treating them as \u201cexotic\u201d insertions into\nWestern arts. Such writers and artists might even have understood\nthemselves to be celebrating the cultures they depicted in pictures of\nArabian warriors or African masks. But they used this imagery\nprecisely in relation to Western art history. They distorted what they\nappropriated.\n\n\u201cBeing a White Man, in short,\u201d writes Said, \u201cwas a\nvery concrete manner of being-in-the-world, a way of taking hold of\nreality, language, and thought. It made a specific style\npossible\u201d (Said 1978, 227). This style might be encapsulated in\nthe outfits of colonial governors, and their mansions. But it was also\ntypified by an appropriative \u201cappreciation\u201d of\n\u201csavage\u201d arts and \u201cexotic\u201d beauties, which\nwere of course not savage or exotic in their own context.  Even in\ncases where the beauty of such objects was celebrated, the\nappreciation was mixed with condescension and misapprehension, and\nalso associated with stripping colonial possessions of their most\nbeautiful objects (as Europeans understood beauty)\u2014shipping them\nback to the British Museum, for example.  Now some beautiful objects,\nlooted in colonialism, are being returned to their points of origin\n(see Matthes 2017), but many others remain in dispute.\n",
