    "main_text": "Buddhist Metaphysics in China\n6. Buddhist Metaphysics in China\n\nA radical transformation of metaphysical views in China followed the\nintroduction and incorporation of Buddhist philosophy, a process that\nbegan in the 1st century CE. On the surface, one might\nthink that Buddhism opposes metaphysical speculation. In the famous\nparable of the arrow, the Buddha compares a student insistent on\nmetaphysical speculation to someone who has been shot with a poisoned\narrow but refuses to be treated until he knows who shot the arrow, why\nthey shot it, where the arrow came from, and so on. The point is that\nwe know that the central problem in life is suffering and we know that\nthe cure is the elimination of self-centered desires. Nonetheless,\nBuddhists commonly claim that one can be released from such desires by\nseeing reality as it truly is. The truth to be realized is that there\nis no self as an independent and lasting being. Much of Buddhist\nphilosophy can be read as a sustained attack on any kind of\nsubstance-based metaphysics. The existence of substances (and thus of\nthe self as a real and lasting thing) requires three things:\nontological separation between things (making the self distinct from\nothers), internal unity (so that it is one self), and\nsameness over time (so it remains the same self). Buddhists\nattack all three of these, arguing that things are interconnected,\nlack intrinsic unity, and change endlessly. Their arguments invoke two\nof the main principles of Buddhist metaphysics\u2014impermanence\n(anitya/wuchang \u7121\u5e38) and dependent\nco-arising (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da/yuanqi\n\u7de3\u8d77).\n\nThe process oriented metaphysics of Buddhism fit with the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition, but it brought a level of precision and\ncomplexity honed through a long tradition of intense disputation and\ndialectic. Positions that had been taken for granted in China were\narticulated in detail and defended against alternatives that had never\nbeen a concern (such as the idea of an eternal and unchanging soul).\nNew possibilities were introduced, including the claim that only\nconsciousness is real. Of course, as Buddhism impacted Chinese\nphilosophy, China transformed Buddhism, leading to schools of Buddhism\nthat never existed in India. Buddhist metaphysics in China is complex\nand diverse and I will just focus a few\n examples.[10]\n\nMuch of Buddhist metaphysics involves negotiating a middle ground\nbetween reification and nihilism. The problem appears in relation to\nthe self\u2014it may be true that there is no self, but surely there\nis something which grounds or generates or is the illusion of self.\nOne early school (Abhidharma) argued the self is a label for what is\nreally an aggregate of momentary elements and factors, known as\ndharmas (fa \u6cd5). Apparent wholes like the self\ncan be mereologically reduced to constituent factors, just as a\nchariot can be reduced to its parts. A more radical view extended the\ncritique of the self to any entity that might be taken as\nindependently real or self-defined, in Buddhist terms, anything that\nmight have svabh\u0101va, literally \u201cself-being\u201d\nor \u201cself-nature\u201d (in Chinese, zixing\n\u81ea\u6027). This denial of self-being follows from dependent\nco-arising, which claims that any event depends on and is bound up\nwith others. Lacking an independent essence or ground, all phenomena\nare said to be empty, \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 or kong\n\u7a7a. Emptiness is meant to be a middle ground between affirming\nor denying the existence of things, but such a middle ground is\ndifficult to articulate, and the history of Buddhist philosophy can be\nseen as a dialectic between those proposing some kind of reality\n(accused of reification) and those rejecting it (accused of\nnihilism).\n\nThis dialectic is portrayed differently by different thinkers,\ndepending on what they take to be the final position that encompasses\nall others. As an example, we can consider the progression given by\nZongmi \u5b97\u5bc6 (780\u2013841), a philosopher representative\nof the Huayan \u83ef\u56b4 school but with close links to Chan\n(see Gregory 2002). In his Inquiry into the Origins of\nHumanity (Yuanren lun \u539f\u4eba\u8ad6) Zongmi\nbegins with the view that each person has a soul that is reincarnated\naccording to his or her actions. He critiques this position by\nanalyzing this self in terms of its parts\u2014the self cannot be\nidentified with the totality of parts (since some parts are lost at\ndeath) nor with one part among many (which would make the other parts\nirrelevant and thus not really even parts). This leads into the next\nposition, that\n\n\nbodily form and cognitive mind, because of the force of causes and\nconditions, arise and perish from moment to moment, continuing in a\nseries without cease, like the trickling of water or the flame of a\nlamp. (trans. from Gregory 2009: 143)\n\n\nAccording to Zongmi, this denial of the self cannot account for\ncontinuity, and in particular, the links between actions and\nconsequences (karma). Some medium must hold the various elements\ntogether. That leads into the third position, that all the various\nchanges are appearances of one mind, which is the ultimate reality.\nThis was the position of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra or Consciousness-Only\n(weishi \u552f\u8b58) school of Buddhism.\n\nThe claim that mind is the ultimate reality tends back toward the side\nof reification and so the next step negates it. Zongmi\u2019s\nargument is typical of the Madhyamaka school (commonly known in\nChinese as the \u201cThree Teachings,\u201d Sanlun\n\u4e09\u8ad6). If we identify this one mind with actual thoughts,\nthen either both are illusions or both are real, but if we separate\nthis mind from actual thoughts then we end up with thoughts that exist\non their own and a mind that has no qualities whatsoever. While the\ntarget here is mind as the ultimate reality, a similar argument can be\nused to attack anything claimed to be independent and unchanging. For\nZongmi, this position denies any form of being and so it cannot end\nthe dialectic. He calls the fifth and final position \u201cThe\nTeaching that Reveals the Nature,\u201d reinterpreting a term we have\nalready seen, xing \u6027, which here stands for the\nBuddha-nature (Fo xing \u4f5b\u6027). This ultimate\nreality could also be referred to as the true mind or as the\nTath\u0101gatagarbha (Rulaizang\u5982\u4f86\u81e7),\nwhich literally means the \u201cWomb of the Thus-Come\u201d\n(\u201cThus-Come\u201d being a common name for the Buddha).\n\nWhile the last three positions all had prominent advocates in China,\nthe final position became dominant and was shared by Tiantai\n\u5929\u81fa, Huayan, and Chan Buddhists. One obvious question is\nhow this final position differs from the position of\nConsciousness-Only. Zongmi extends a line of argument common in\nChinese Buddhism, which is to critique any form of dualism. Since\nnothing we experience is truly independent, simple, or unchanging, any\nmetaphysics that posits substances with self-being requires a\nbifurcation between reality and appearances, or more specifically,\nbetween the substance itself and the various qualities or modes by\nwhich it appears. Buddhists argue against the coherence of any such\ndivision. This is the meaning of the common saying: \u201cform is\nemptiness and emptiness is form.\u201d Zongmi pushes this argument\nfurther to argue against any split between reality and illusion or\nbetween enlightenment and non-enlightenment. This leads to the claim\nthat all sentient beings are already enlightened\u2014what is needed\nis not to change reality or gain anything but just to realize that we\nare already where we need to be.\n\nThe relationship between reality and illusion is one of the central\ndebates within Chinese Buddhism (Kantor 2015). The most famous\nexpression of this debate appears in the Platform Sutra of the\nSixth Patriarch, a foundational text for Chan Buddhism. The star\ndisciple (Shen Xiu) first composes this poem:\n\n\nThe body is the tree of insight;\n\nThe mind is like a clear mirror.\n\nAlways clean and polish it;\n\nNever allow dirt or dust!\n\n\nHui Neng (638\u2013713 CE), the central figure of the text, writes\nthis poem in reply:\n\n\nInsight originally has no tree;\n\nThe bright mirror has no stand.\n\nBuddha-nature is always pure and clean;\n\nHow could there ever be dirt or dust? (trans. from Ivanhoe 2009,\n15\u201316)\n\n\nThe contrast between the two poems marks the split between the gradual\nand sudden enlightenment schools of Chan.\n\nHow to discuss the relationship between the realm of experience and\nemptiness or Buddha-nature was another common theme in Chinese\nBuddhist philosophy. One of the more thorough and influential\ndiscussions is the Meditative Approaches to the Huayan\nDharmadh\u0101tu (Huayan Fajie Guan Men\n\u83ef\u56b4\u6cd5\u754c\u89c0\u9580), attributed to\nDushun \u675c\u9806 (557\u2013640) (see Fox 2009). According to\nDushun, the world of experience can be viewed in four different ways.\nThe first is as phenomena or events (shi \u4e8b), which is\nequivalent to the realm of form. The second is as emptiness, referred\nto here with the term li \u7406. The point is that, in one\nsense, reality can be seen as the multitude of phenomena but, in\nanother sense, it can all be seen as empty, which entails a kind of\nequality and interchangeability. The third perspective addresses the\nrelationship between emptiness and phenomena, using the relationship\nbetween water and waves as a metaphor. The two are mutually\nencompassing and mutually dependent, just as there is no water without\nwaves and waves are nothing other than water, yet we can focus solely\non the wave or solely on the water. The point is that designating a\nwave is not the same as designating water, yet these designations do\nnot \u201cobstruct\u201d each other. The very same reality can be\ntaken as the phenomena of everyday experience and as emptiness.\n\nThe fourth perspective brings us to a metaphysical issue that has\nrecurred across the Chinese philosophical tradition\u2014the\ninterconnection of things. It is not just that emptiness and phenomena\nare mutually penetrating but that any phenomenon is penetrated by all\nothers. The claim that any one thing includes all others is clearest\non the level of causality and intelligibility. Consider the cause for\nyour reading this article. It might be for help in a course, or\nbecause you followed a link out of curiosity, or from a desire to\nbetter understand the context of the Laozi. But we could say\nthe cause was the story of how your parents met\u2014had that not\nhappened you would not be reading this article. Or it might be the\nstory of how my parents met, or the creation of the internet, or the\nfounding of Stanford University, or the gravitational pull of the\nearth. If everything is interconnected, then anything could be given\nas a cause for your reading this article. What makes one answer better\nthan another is determined only by the interests of the questioner\n(are they interested in increasing web traffic to the SEP?\nunderstanding digital humanities? writing my biography? writing\nyours?). This shows how any one event implicates and arises with all\nothers. Consider further, though, that all things are empty. They have\nno independent self-nature, so what it is to be that thing is\nexplained entirely by all of the factors that allow it to appear as\nwhat it is. Thus it is not just that things depend on each other but\nthat things include each other. This inclusion applies not just\nbetween any two events but also between any event and the totality of\nother events; the story of the whole universe can be explicated from\nany one point. Brook Ziporyn (2000) calls this \u201comnicentric\nholism\u201dand it has similarities with Leibniz\u2019s claim that\nevery substance (monad) implicitly expresses all others. This\nconclusion serves the soteriological purposes of Buddhist\nphilosophy\u2014if any one thing implies all others, then it is\nimpossible to grasp only one thing. Grasping and attachment become\nincoherent. It is worth comparing this result with the elimination of\nloss through radical impartiality, discussed in Section 4.\n\n",
