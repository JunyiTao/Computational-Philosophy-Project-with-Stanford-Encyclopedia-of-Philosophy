    "main_text": "Logic and Philosophy of logic || Inference-for-others\n3.2 Inference-for-others\n\nLater theoretical elaborations by Dign\u0101ga, Dharmak\u012brti, et\nal. about how to present publicly (i.e., verbally) a good\nreason (saddhetu) to an adversary in a debate prescribe the\nuse of complex verbal forms known as prayoga (formal\nreasonings). Thus, for example, the standard formal reasoning that\nDharmak\u012brti and his Indo-Tibetan successors prescribed\nwas a two-membered form, known as an\n\u201cinference-for-others\u201d\n(par\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na):\n\n\nAll Cs are Bs, like D.\n\nA is C.\n\n\nCommentators make an explicit correlation with the triple criterion\n(trair\u016bpya). Thus the first statement perspicuously\nexpresses the pervasion (i.e., the anvayavy\u0101pti and\nvyatirekavy\u0101pti) and the second expresses the fact of\nthe reason being a property of the subject\n(pak\u1e63adharmatva). The statement of the conclusion,\nA is B, is omitted. Indeed it is explicitly ruled\nout in later prescriptive accounts of how Buddhists should argue.\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s own position on this hardens over time to arrive,\nin the V\u0101dany\u0101ya, at the view that stating the\nconclusion is actually a \u201cpoint of defeat\u201d\n(nigrahasth\u0101na). The irrelevance of the conclusion is\nsupposedly because the only function of an inference-for-others is to\nshow \u201cprovers\u201d (s\u0101dhana), and a conclusion\ncannot prove itself. Although A is B, i.e.,\n\u201cwhat is to be proved\u201d (s\u0101dhya), can be\nunderstood indirectly, it should not be stated. While the\ninference-for-others has often been thought to somehow formally\nresemble a syllogism in Aristotelian logic, it is apparent that the\npresence and absence of conclusions in syllogisms and\ninferences-for-others respectively as well as the idea of what\nconstitutes a \u201cprover\u201d for Buddhists, means that\npar\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na and Aristotelian syllogisms are\naccounted for in terms of considerably different philosophies of logic\n(see Tillemans 1999, 69\u201387).\n",
