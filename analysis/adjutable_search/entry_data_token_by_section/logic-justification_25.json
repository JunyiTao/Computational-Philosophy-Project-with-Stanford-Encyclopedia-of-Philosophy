    "main_text": "Self-referentiality of justifications\n7. Self-referentiality of justifications\n\n\nThe Realization algorithms sometimes produce Constant Specifications \ncontaining self-referential justification assertions \n\\(c : A ( c)\\), that is, assertions in which the \njustification (here \\(c)\\) occurs in the asserted proposition \n(here \\(A ( c))\\).\n\n\nSelf-referentiality of justifications is a new phenomenon which is \nnot present in the conventional modal language. In addition to being \nintriguing epistemic objects, such self-referential assertions \nprovide a special challenge from the semantical viewpoint because of \nthe built-in vicious circle. Indeed, to evaluate \\(c\\) one would\nexpect first to evaluate \\(A\\) and then assign a justification \nobject for \\(A\\) to \\(c\\). However, this cannot be done \nsince \\(A\\) contains \\(c\\) which is yet to be evaluated. \nThe question of whether or not modal logics can be realized without \nusing self-referential justifications was a major open question in \nthis area.\n\n\nThe principal result by Kuznets in (Brezhnev and Kuznets 2006) states\nthat self-referentiality of justifications is unavoidable in \nrealization of \\(\\mathsf{S4}\\) in\n\\(\\mathsf{LP}\\). The current \nstate of things is given by the following theorem due to Kuznets:\n\nTheorem 5: Self-referentiality can be avoided in\nrealizations of modal logics\n \\(\\mathsf{K}\\) and\n \\(\\mathsf{D}\\).\n Self-referentiality cannot be avoided in\nrealizations of modal logics\n \\(\\mathsf{T} , \\mathsf{K4} , \\mathsf{D4}\\)\n and\n \\(\\mathsf{S4}\\).\n\n\n\nThis theorem establishes that a system of justification terms for \n\\(\\mathsf{S4}\\) will necessarily \nbe self-referential. This creates a serious, though not directly \nvisible, constraint on provability semantics. In the G\u00f6delian \ncontext of arithmetical proofs, the problem was coped with by a \ngeneral method of assigning arithmetical semantics to \nself-referential assertions \\(c : A ( c)\\) stating\nthat \\(c\\) is a proof of \\(A ( c)\\). In the Logic of\nProofs \\(\\mathsf{LP}\\) it was \ndealt with by a non-trivial fixed-point construction.\n\n\nSelf-referentiality gives an interesting perspective on Moore\u2019s \nParadox. See Section 6 of the\nsupplementary document\n Some More Technical Matters\n for details.\n\nThe question of the self-referentiality of BHK-semantics for\nintuitionistic logic \\(\\mathsf{IPC}\\) has been answered by Junhua Yu\n(Yu 2014).  Extending Kuznets\u2019 method, he established\n\nTheorem 6: Each \\(\\mathsf{LP}\\) realization of the\nintuitionistic law of double negation \\(\\neg\\neg(\\neg\\neg p\n\\rightarrow p)\\) requires self referential constant\nspecifications.\n\nMore generally, Yu has proved that any double negation of a classical\ntautology (by Glivenko\u2019s Theorem all of them are theorems of\n\\(\\mathsf{IPC}\\)) needs self-referential constant specifications for\nits realization in \\(\\mathsf{LC}\\).  Another example of unavoidable\nself-referentiality was found by Yu in the purely implicational\nfragment of \\(\\mathsf{IPC}\\).  This suggests that the BHK semantics of\nintuitionistic logic (even just of intuitionistic implication) is\nintrinsically self-referential and needs a fixed-point construction to\nconnect it to formal proofs in PA or similar systems.  This might\nexplain, in part, why any attempt to build provability BHK semantics\nin a direct inductive manner without self-referentiality was doomed to\nfailure.\n\n",
