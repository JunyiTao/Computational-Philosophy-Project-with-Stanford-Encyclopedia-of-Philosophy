    "main_text": "De occulta philosophia (early draft)\n2. De occulta philosophia (early draft)\n\nDedicating to Trithemius his first attempt as a reformer of magic,\nAgrippa claimed to share the common desire for the renewal of a\n\u201csublime and sacred science\u201d, perverted by having been\ndetached from its theoretical context and by being practiced with\nanti-natural means and intentions. Corrupted texts and inadequate\ncritical and philosophical awareness had made magic a convoluted\njumble of errors and obscurities, despised by the learned, mistrusted\nby the Church, and used with feckless irresponsibility by\nsuperstitious old witches. Instead, in its original and pure form,\nmagic was a sacred body of knowledge, providing the possibility of\nhuman dominion over all of created nature (elemental, celestial, and\nintellectual).\n\nBasically, the first draft of De occulta philosophia was\nstructured as a survey, which owed much to Marsilio Ficino\u2019s\nDe vita (On Life), Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola\u2019s Oratio (de dignitate hominis,\nOration [on the Dignity of Humankind]), and Johannes\nReuchlin\u2019s De verbo mirifico. These authors had already\nendeavored to restore magic, distinguishing (from different\nperspectives and with different aims) between true and false magic,\nbetween philosophy and pseudo-philosophy, between the sacred and the\nsacrilegious. Agrippa\u2019s program followed a slightly different\npath. For Giovanni Pico, magic was \u201cthe most perfect\naccomplishment of natural philosophy\u201d (Oration, p.\n226). Instead, for Agrippa, it was \u201cthe most perfect\naccomplishment of the noblest philosophy\u201d (totius\nnobilissimae philosophiae absoluta consummatio, I, 2, p. 86).\nThis definition had significant implications. Unlike his predecessors,\nAgrippa conceived of magic as a comprehensive knowledge, gathering\ntogether all the cognitive data collected in the various fields of\nhuman learning, and making explicit their potentials for acting on\nreality. Therefore, according to the three different levels of being,\nthere were three different operative areas to which magic applied,\nmaking it possible to distinguish three \u2018forms\u2019 of magic:\nnatural magic, astrological (and numerological) magic, and\n\u2018religious\u2019 or \u2018ceremonial\u2019 magic, that is,\nthe kabbalistic and theurgic magic. All three forms are true and good,\nif properly practiced in the context of the reformed magic. This\nassessment highlighted that Agrippa had moved away from another of his\nsources. In De verbo mirifico, Johannes Reuchlin had proposed\na similar tripartite division in the \u201cwonder-working art\u201d\n(ars miraculorum), but he had also recognized the intrinsic\nrisks of each \u201cform\u201d. Magic based on physics (natural\nmagic) cannot be checked and is therefore limited in its powers. Magic\nbased on astrology is often false and confused. As far as ceremonial\nmagic is concerned, goetia, which relies on malign demons, is\nclearly superstitious; theurgy, which attempts to establish contact\nwith benign demons, is practicable in theory, but complicated and\ndangerous in practice. Therefore, Reuchlin favored a more reliable and\nefficacious alternative, a fourth way, called the \u201cart of\nsoliloquy\u201d (ars soliloquia), based on the use of the\nholy name of Christ. While sharing Reuchlin\u2019s enthusiasm for\nthis thaumaturgic philosophy, Agrippa\u2019s view was broader, also\nembracing Ficino\u2019s astrological magic, Pico\u2019s natural\nmagic, and Neoplatonic and Hermetic theurgic magic. The\nall-inclusiveness of his \u201crestored\u201d magic also allowed him\nto recover the legacy of the medieval tradition (of Albertus Magnus,\nabove all) and even to pay some attention to popular\nbeliefs\u2014justifying them within a Neoplatonic conceptual\nframework.\n\nIn Book I Agrippa explores the elemental world, reviewing the manifest\nand occult virtues of stones, plants, animals, and human individuals.\nOccult virtues, on which natural magic mainly focuses, are explained\nby the relationship of causal correspondence, connecting the eternal\nexemplars, the ideas, to the sublunary forms through the stars. In his\nNeoplatonic animated cosmos, all things are harmoniously related to\neach other. Magical activity consists chiefly in attracting the\n\u201cspirit of the world\u201d (spiritus mundi). It is\ndiffused everywhere and distributes life to everything, acting as the\nmediator between heavenly souls and earthly bodies, and allowing a\nsympathetic exchange between the different levels of the ontological\nhierarchy.\n\nBook II, dedicated to astrology, opens with the celebrated image of\nthe magus as the go-between who subjects sublunary world to the stars.\nThe knowledge of the laws, governing how the celestial influences flow\ndown to the earth, enables the magus to collaborate actively with\nnature, modifying the phenomenal processes. To describe astrological\nimages, attracting astral virtues, Agrippa pillaged the technical\ndetails described by Ficino in De vita coelitus comparanda\n(On Obtaining Life from the Heavens), but he also went back\nto the medieval tradition.\n\nIn Book III, Agrippa commits the physical and celestial worlds to the\nprotection of religion, which has the task of guaranteeing a\nrigorously non-superstitious magic, immune to demonic deceptions.\nReligion provides the magus with a model of moral improvement,\nallowing him to realize the Hermetic ideal of the perfect philosopher,\nperfect magus, and perfect \u201cpriest\u201d (sacerdos).\nIn describing the human path to Hermetic deification, the first draft\nof Book III makes a clear distinction between faith and science.\nAgrippa draws on Reuchlin to define the link between illumination,\noffered by God to the human mind through faith, and reason, which can\ngain true knowledge only by receiving it from the mind. Reason, after\nattaining the innate contents of the mind, produces a science which is\nlegitimized by its divine origins and is therefore not susceptible to\nthe assault of doubts and errors. This was only an initial (and\nsomewhat vague) approach to a topic which would play an increasingly\ncrucial role in Agrippa\u2019s thought. At this time, the primacy of\nfaith, as expressed by Reuchlin, functioned chiefly as the basis for a\npowerful and reliable operative practice. As far as kabbalistic magic\nwas concerned, Agrippa seemingly played down Reuchlin\u2019s raptures\nabout the Hebrew language, assimilating the sacred Hebrew names,\ninstituted by God as the vehicles of his power, to the so-called\n\u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cforeign words\u201d (barbara\nverba) of ancient theology and Neoplatonic theurgy.\n\nThe early version of De occulta philosophia was, in many\nrespects, an original attempt. Nevertheless, it did not perfectly\nsucceed in organizing Agrippa\u2019s different and varying sources\ninto a coherent structure\u2014especially as regards Book III, which\nplayed a pivotal role in connecting magic to the religious foundation\nof learning. Not without reason, the dedicatee Trithemius noticed\nthese limitations, urging his pupil \u201cnot to imitate bullocks,\nbut to emulate birds\u201d (Epistolae, pp.\n503\u201304)\u2014that is, to turn his mind to the metaphysical\nUnity as a prior requirement for all magic activity.\n",
