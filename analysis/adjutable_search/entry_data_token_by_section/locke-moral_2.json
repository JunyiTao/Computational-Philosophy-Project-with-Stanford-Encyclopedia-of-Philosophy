Locke\u2019s natural law theory: the basis of moral obligation\n\nIn order to get a complete understanding of Locke\u2019s moral theory, it\nis useful to begin with a look at Locke\u2019s natural law view,\narticulated most fully in his Essays on the Law of Nature\n(written as series of lectures he delivered as Censor of Moral\nPhilosophy at Christ Church, Oxford). Two predominant features of\nLocke\u2019s natural law theory are already well-developed in this work:\nthe rationalism and the legalism. According to Locke, reason is the\nprimary avenue by which humans come to understand moral rules, and it\nis via reason we can draw two distinct but related conclusions\nregarding the grounds for our moral obligations: we can appreciate the\ndivine, and thereby righteous, nature of morality and we can\nperceive that morality is the expression of a law-making\nauthority.\n",
