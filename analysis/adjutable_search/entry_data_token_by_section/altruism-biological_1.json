    "main_text": "Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness\n2. Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness\n\n\nThe basic idea of kin selection is simple. Imagine a gene which\ncauses its bearer to behave altruistically towards other organisms,\ne.g. by sharing food with them. Organisms without the gene are \nselfish\u2014they keep all their food for themselves, and sometimes get handouts\nfrom the altruists. Clearly the altruists will be at a fitness\ndisadvantage, so we should expect the altruistic gene to be eliminated\nfrom the population. However, suppose that altruists are discriminating\nin who they share food with. They do not share with just anybody, but\nonly with their relatives. This immediately changes things. For\nrelatives are genetically similar\u2014they share genes with one another.\nSo when an organism carrying the altruistic gene shares his food, there\nis a certain probability that the recipients of the food will also\ncarry copies of that gene. (How probable depends on how closely related\nthey are.) This means that the altruistic gene can in principle spread\nby natural selection. The gene causes an organism to behave in a way\nwhich reduces its own fitness but boosts the fitness of its \nrelatives\u2014who have a greater than average chance of carrying the gene\nthemselves. So the overall effect of the behaviour may be to increase\nthe number of copies of the altruistic gene found in the next\ngeneration, and thus the incidence of the altruistic behaviour\nitself.\n\n\nThough this argument was hinted at by Haldane in the 1930s, and to a\nlesser extent by Darwin in his discussion of sterile insect castes\nin  The Origin of Species, it was first made explicit by\nWilliam Hamilton (1964) in a pair of seminal papers. Hamilton\ndemonstrated rigorously that an altruistic gene will be favoured by\nnatural selection when a certain condition, known as\nHamilton's rule, is satisfied. In its simplest version, the\nrule states that b > c/r, where c is\nthe cost incurred by the altruist (the donor), b is the benefit\nreceived by the recipients of the altruism, and r is\nthe co-efficient of relationship between donor and\nrecipient. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of\nreproductive fitness. The co-efficient of relationship depends on the\ngenealogical relation between donor and recipient\u2014it is\ndefined as the probability that donor and recipient share genes at a\ngiven locus that are \u2018identical by descent\u2019. (Two genes\nare identical by descent if they are copies of a single gene in a\nshared ancestor.) In a sexually reproducing diploid species, the value\nof r for full siblings is \u00bd, for parents and offspring\n\u00bd, for grandparents and grandoffspring \u00bc, for full\ncousins 1/8,\u00a0 and so-on. The higher the value of r, the greater\nthe probability that the recipient of the altruistic behaviour will\nalso possess the gene for altruism. So what Hamilton's rule tells us\nis that a gene for altruism can spread by natural selection, so long\nas the cost incurred by the altruist is offset by a sufficient amount\nof benefit to sufficiently closed related relatives. The proof of\nHamilton's rule relies on certain non-trivial assumptions; see Frank\n1998, Grafen 1985, 2006, Queller 1992a, 1992b, Boyd and McIlreath 2006\nand Birch forthcoming for details.\n\n\nThough Hamilton himself did not use the term, his idea quickly\nbecame known as \u2018kin selection\u2019, for obvious reasons. Kin\nselection theory predicts that animals are more likely to behave\naltruistically towards their relatives than towards unrelated members\nof their species. Moreover, it predicts that the degree of\naltruism will be greater, the closer the relationship. In the years\nsince Hamilton's theory was devised, these predictions have been amply\nconfirmed by empirical work. For example, in various bird species, it\nhas been found that \u2018helper\u2019 birds are much more likely to\nhelp relatives raise their young, than they are to help unrelated\nbreeding pairs. Similarly, studies of Japanese macaques have shown that\naltruistic actions, such as defending others from attack, tend to be\npreferentially directed towards close kin. In most social insect\nspecies, a peculiarity of the genetic system known as\n\u2018haplodiploidy\u2019 means that females on average share more\ngenes with their sisters than with their own offspring. So a female may\nwell be able to get more genes into the next generation by helping the\nqueen reproduce, hence increasing the number of sisters she will have,\nrather than by having offspring of her own. Kin selection theory\ntherefore provides a neat explanation of how sterility in the social\ninsects may have evolved by Darwinian means. (Note, however, that the\nprecise significance of haplodiploidy for the evolution of worker\nsterility is a controversial question; see Maynard Smith and Szathmary\n1995 ch.16, Gardner, Alpedrinha and West 2012.)\n\n\nKin selection theory is often presented as a triumph of the\n\u2018gene's-eye view of evolution\u2019, which sees organic\nevolution as the result of competition among genes for increased\nrepresentation in the gene-pool, and individual organisms as mere\n\u2018vehicles\u2019 that genes have constructed to aid their\npropagation (Dawkins 1976, 1982). The gene's eye-view is certainly\nthe easiest way of understanding kin selection, and was employed by\nHamilton himself in his 1964 papers. Altruism seems anomalous from the\nindividual organism's point of view, but from the gene's point of view\nit makes good sense. A gene wants to maximize the number of copies of\nitself that are found in the next generation; one way of doing that is\nto cause its host organism to behave altruistically towards other\nbearers of the gene, so long as the costs and benefits satisfy the\nHamilton inequality. But interestingly, Hamilton showed that kin\nselection can also be understood from the organism's point of view.\nThough an altruistic behaviour which spreads by kin selection reduces\nthe organism's personal fitness (by definition), it increases what\nHamilton called the organism's inclusive fitness. An\norganism's inclusive fitness is defined as its personal fitness, plus\nthe sum of its weighted effects on the fitness of every other organism\nin the population, the weights determined by the coefficient of\nrelationship r. Given this definition, natural selection will act to\nmaximise the inclusive fitness of individuals in the population (Grafen 2006).\nInstead of thinking in terms of selfish genes trying to maximize their\nfuture representation in the gene-pool, we can think in terms of\norganisms trying to maximize their inclusive fitness. Most people find\nthe \u2018gene's eye\u2019 approach to kin selection heuristically\nsimpler than the inclusive fitness approach, but mathematically they\nare in fact equivalent (Michod 1982, Frank 1998, Boyd and\nMcIlreath 2006, Grafen 2006).\n\n\nContrary to what is sometimes thought, kin selection does not\nrequire that animals must have the ability to discriminate relatives\nfrom non-relatives, less still to calculate coefficients of\nrelationship. Many animals can in fact recognize their kin, often by\nsmell, but kin selection can operate in the absence of such an ability.\nHamilton's inequality can be satisfied so long as an animal behaves\naltruistically towards other animals that are in fact its\nrelatives. The animal might achieve this by having the ability\nto tell relatives from non-relatives, but this is not the only\npossibility. An alternative is to use some proximal indicator of\nkinship. For example, if an animal behaves altruistically towards those\nin its immediate vicinity, then the recipients of the altruism are\nlikely to be relatives, given that relatives tend to live near each\nother. No ability to recognize kin is presupposed. Cuckoos exploit\nprecisely this fact, free-riding on the innate tendency of birds to\ncare for the young in their nests.\n\n\nAnother popular misconception is that kin selection theory is\ncommitted to \u2018genetic determinism\u2019, the idea that genes\nrigidly determine or control behaviour. Though some sociobiologists\nhave made incautious remarks to this effect, evolutionary theories of\nbehaviour, including kin selection, are not committed to it. So long as\nthe behaviours in question have a genetical component, i.e.\nare influenced to some extent by one or more genetic factor, then the\ntheories can apply. When Hamilton (1964) talks about a gene which\n\u2018causes\u2019 altruism, this is really shorthand for a gene\nwhich increases the probability that its bearer will behave\naltruistically, to some degree. This is much weaker than saying that\nthe behaviour is genetically \u2018determined\u2019, and is quite\ncompatible with the existence of strong environmental influences on the\nbehaviour's expression. Kin selection theory does not deny the truism\nthat all traits are affected by both genes and environment. Nor does it\ndeny that many interesting animal behaviours are transmitted through\nnon-genetical means, such as imitation and social learning (Avital and\nJablonka 2000).\n\n\nThe importance of kinship for the evolution of altruism is very widely\naccepted today, on both theoretical and empirical grounds.  However,\nkinship is really only a way of ensuring that altruists and recipients\nboth carry copies of the altruistic gene, which is the fundamental\nrequirement. If altruism is to evolve, it must be the case that the\nrecipients of altruistic actions have a greater than average\nprobability of being altruists themselves. Kin-directed altruism is\nthe most obvious way of satisfying this condition, but there are other\npossibilities too (Hamilton 1975, Sober and Wilson 1998, Bowles and\nGintis 2011, Gardner and West 2011). For example, if the gene that\ncauses altruism also causes animals to favour a particular feeding\nground (for whatever reason), then the required correlation between\ndonor and recipient may be generated. It is this correlation, however\nbrought about, that is necessary for altruism to evolve. This point\nwas noted by Hamilton himself in the 1970s: he stressed that the\ncoefficient of relationship of his 1964 papers should really be\nreplaced with a more general correlation coefficient, which reflects\nthe probability that altruist and recipient share genes, whether\nbecause of kinship or not (Hamilton 1970, 1972, 1975).  This point is\ntheoretically important, and has not always been recognized; but in\npractice, kinship remains the most important source of statistical\nassociations between altruists and recipients (Maynard Smith 1998,\nOkasha 2002, West\net al. 2007).\n",
