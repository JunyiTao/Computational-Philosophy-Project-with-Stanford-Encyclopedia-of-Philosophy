    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || The Long-Run Residence Time Account\n4.7 The Long-Run Residence Time Account\n\nThe long-run residence time account offers a different perspective\nboth on the definition of equilibrium and the approach to it (Werndl\n& Frigg 2015a, 2015b). Rather than first defining equilibrium\nthrough combinatorial considerations (as in\n \u00a74.2)\n and then asking why systems approach equilibrium thus\ndefined (as do the accounts discussed in\n \u00a7\u00a74.4\u20134.6),\n the long-run residence time account defines equilibrium\nthrough thermodynamic behaviour. The account begins by characterising\nthe macro-states in the set \\(\\{ M_{1},\\ldots,M_{n}\\}\\) in purely\nmacroscopic terms, i.e., through thermodynamic variables like pressure\nand temperature, and then identifies the state in which a system\nresides most of the time as the equilibrium state: among the\n\\(M_{i}\\), the equilibrium macro-state is by definition the state in\nwhich a system spends most of its time in the long run (which gives\nthe account its name).\n\nThis definition requires no assumption about the size of the\nequilibrium macro-region, but one can then show that it is a property\nof the equilibrium macro-state that its macro-region is large. This\nresult is fully general in that it does not depend on assumptions like\nparticles being non-interacting (which makes it applicable to all\nsystems including liquids and solids), and it does not depend on\ncombinatorial considerations at the micro-level. The approach to\nequilibrium is built into the definition in the sense that if there is\nno macro-state in which the system spends most of its time, then the\nsystem simply has no equilibrium. This raises the question of the\ncircumstances under which an equilibrium exists. The account answers\nthis question by providing a general existence theorem which furnishes\ncriteria for the existence of an equilibrium state (Werndl & Frigg\nforthcoming-b). Intuitively, the existence theorem\u00a0says that\nthere is an equilibrium just in case the system\u2019s state space is\nsplit up into invariant regions on which the motion is ergodic and the\nequilibrium macro-state is largest in size relative to the other\nmacro-states on each such region.\n\nLike the account previously discussed, the long-run residence time\naccount accommodates Loschmidt\u2019s and Zermelo\u2019s objections\nby rejecting the requirement of strict irreversibility: it insists\nthat being in equilibrium most of the time is as much as one can\nreasonably ask for because actual physical systems show equilibrium\nfluctuations and equilibrium is not the dead and immovable state that\nthermodynamics says it is.\n",
