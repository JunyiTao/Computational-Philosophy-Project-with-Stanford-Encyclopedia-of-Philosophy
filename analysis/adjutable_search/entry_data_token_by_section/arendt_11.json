Faced with the horrors of\nthe extermination camps and what is now termed the Gulag, Arendt\nstrove to understand these phenomena in their own terms, neither\ndeducing them from precedents nor placing them in some overarching\nscheme of historical necessity. This need to come to terms with the\ntraumatic events of the twentieth century, and to understand them in a\nmanner that does not explain them away but faces them in all their\nstarkness and unprecedentedness, is something to which Arendt returns\nagain and again. Our inherited framework for judgment fails us\n\u201cas soon as we try to apply it honestly to the central political\nexperiences of our own time\u201d (UP, 379). Even our ordinary\ncommon-sense judgment is rendered ineffective, since \u201cwe are\nliving in a topsy-turvy world, a world where we cannot find our way by\nabiding by the rules of what once was common sense\u201d (UP,\n383).\n\n\nThe crisis in understanding is therefore coeval with a crisis in\njudgment, insofar as understanding for Arendt is \u201cso closely\nrelated to and interrelated with judging that one must describe both\nas the subsumption of something particular under a universal\nrule\u201d (UP, 383). Once these rules have lost their validity we\nare no longer able to understand and to judge the particulars, that\nis, we are no longer able to subsume them under our accepted\ncategories of moral and political thought. Arendt, however, does not\nbelieve that the loss of these categories has brought to an end our\ncapacity to judge; on the contrary, since human beings are\ndistinguished by their capacity to begin anew, they are able to\nfashion new categories and to formulate new standards of judgment for\nthe events that have come to pass and for those that may emerge in the\nfuture.\n\n\nFor Arendt, therefore, the enormity and unprecedentedness of\ntotalitarianism have not destroyed, strictly speaking, our ability to\njudge; rather, they have destroyed our accepted standards of judgment\nand our conventional categories of interpretation and assessment, be\nthey moral or political. And in this situation the only recourse is to\nappeal to the imagination, which allows us to view things in\ntheir proper perspective and to judge them without the benefit of a\npre-given rule or universal. For Arendt, the imagination enables us to\ncreate the distance which is necessary for an impartial judgment,\nwhile at the same time allowing for the closeness that makes\nunderstanding possible. In this way it makes possible our\nreconciliation with reality, even with the tragic reality of the\ntwentieth century.\n\n\nArendt\u2019s participation at the trial of Eichmann in the early sixties\nmade her once more aware of the need to come to terms with a reality\nthat initially defied human comprehension. How could such an ordinary,\nlaw-abiding, and all-too-human individual have committed such\natrocities? The impact of the trial also forced her to raise another\nproblem concerning judgment, namely, whether we are entitled to\npresuppose \u201can independent human faculty, unsupported by law and\npublic opinion, that judges anew in full spontaneity every deed and\nintent whenever the occasion arises\u201d (PRD, 187).\n",
