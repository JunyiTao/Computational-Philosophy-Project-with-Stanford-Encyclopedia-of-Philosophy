    "main_text": "Presocratic Atomism\n8. Presocratic Atomism\n\nThe pluralism of Anaxagoras and Empedocles maintained the Eleatic\nstrictures on metaphysically acceptable basic entities (things that\nare and must be just what they are) by adopting an irreducible\npluralism of stuffs meeting these standards that could pass on their\nqualities to items constructed from them. Ancient atomism responded\nmore radically: what is real is an infinite number of solid,\nuncuttable (atomon) units of matter. All atoms are made of\nthe same stuff (solid matter, in itself otherwise indeterminate),\ndiffering from one another (according to Aristotle in Metaphysics 985b4-20=DK67A6/LM27D31 and R38) only in shape,\nposition, arrangement. Later sources say that atoms differ in weight;\nsome scholars have argued that, while this is certainly true for\npost-Aristotelian atomism, it is less likely for Presocratic atomism.\nRecent scholarship has questioned this view, and find no reason to\ndeny weight to Presocratic atomism (Augustin 2015). In addition to the\nreality of atoms, the Presocratic atomists, Leucippus and Democritus\n(Democritus was born in about 460 BCE in Abdera in Northern Greece,\nshortly after Socrates was born in Athens), enthusiastically endorsed\nthe reality of the empty (or\n void).[11]\n The void is what separates atoms and allows for the differences noted\nabove (except weight, which could not be accounted for by void, since\nvoid in an atom would make it divisible and, hence, not an atom)\n(Sedley 1982; see also Sedley 2008). \n\nLike Anaxagoras, the atomists consider all phenomenal objects and\ncharacteristics as emerging from the background mixture; in the case\nof atomism, the mix of atoms and void (Wardy 1988). Everything is\nconstructed of atoms and void: the shapes of the atoms and their\narrangement with respect to each other (and the intervening void) give\nphysical objects their apparent characteristics. As Democritus says:\n\u201cBy convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention\nhot, by convention cold, by convention color: in reality atoms and\nvoid\u201d (DK68B125/LM27D14, D13a = DK68B9/LM27D4, D14, D15, D23a,\nR108). For example, Theophrastus says that the flavors differ\naccording to the shapes of the atoms that compose various objects;\nthus \u201cDemocritus makes sweet that which is round and quite\nlarge, astringent that which large, rough, polygonal and not\nrounded\u201d ( Caus. Plant. 6.1.6 = 68A129/LM27D60).\nSimplicius reports that things composed of sharp and very fine atoms\nin similar positions are hot and fiery; those composed of atoms with\nthe opposite character come to be cold and watery (in Phys.\n36.3\u20136 = 67A14). Moreover, Theophrastus reports that the\natomists explain why iron is harder than lead but lighter; it is\nharder because of the uneven arrangements of the atoms that make it\nup, lighter because it contains more void than lead. Lead, on the\nother hand, has less void than iron, but the even arrangement of the\natoms makes lead easier to cut or to bend (de Sens. 61\u201363 =\n68A135/LM27D64, D65, D66, D67, D69, D134, D147, D157, D158, D159a).\n\n\nAdopting a strong distinction between appearance and reality, and\ndenying the accuracy of appearances, as we see him do in the above\nquotation, Democritus was seen by some ancient sources (especially\nSextus Empiricus) as a sort of skeptic, yet the evidence is unclear.\nIt is true that Democritus is quoted as saying, \u201cIn truth we\nknow nothing; for truth is in the depths\u201d (DK68B117/LM27D24). So\nfor him, the truth is not given in the appearances. Yet, even Sextus\nseems to agree that Democritus allows for knowledge:\n\nBut in the Rules [Democritus] says that there are two kinds\nof knowing, one through the senses and the other through the\nunderstanding. The one through the understanding he calls genuine,\nwitnessing to its trustworthiness in deciding truth; the one through\nthe senses he names bastard, denying it steadfastness in the\ndiscernment of what is true. He says in these words, \u201cThere are\ntwo forms of knowing, one genuine and the other bastard. To the\nbastard belong all these: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The\nother, the genuine, has been separated from this\u201d\n[DK68B11/LM27D6, D20, D21, R108]. Then preferring the genuine to the\nbastard, he continues, saying, \u201cWhenever the bastard is no\nlonger able to see more finely nor hear nor smell nor taste nor\nperceive by touch, but something finer\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThus Sextus suggests that the evidence of the senses, when properly\ninterpreted by reason, can be taken as a guide to reality (the claim\nthat \u201cappearances are a sight of the unseen\u201d is attributed\nto Democritus as well as to Anaxagoras). We just need to know how to\nfollow this guide, through proper reasoning, so as to reach the\ntruth\u2014i.e., the theory of atoms and void (Lee 2005).\n\nIn addition to fragments advancing these metaphysical and physical\ndoctrines, there are a number of ethical fragments attributed to\nDemocritus (but the question of authenticity looms large here);\nalthough a passage reported in John Stobaeus seems to link moderation\nand cheerfulness with small measured movements in the soul and says\nthat excess and deficiencies give rise to large movements\n(DK68B191/LMD226), it is unclear whether or how these claims are\nrelated to the metaphysical aspects of atomism (Vlastos 1945 and 1946,\nKahn 1985b). Democritus was identified in antiquity with the idea of\n\u201cgood cheer\u201d (euthumi\u0113) as the proper\nguiding objective in living one\u2019s life. In this, as in other\naspects of his philosophy, he may have had some influence on the\nformation of Epicurus\u2019 philosophy a century later.\n",
