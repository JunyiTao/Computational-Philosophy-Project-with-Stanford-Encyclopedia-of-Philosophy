    "main_text": "\n\nIn contrast to the meaning the word \u2018sophism\u2019 had in\nancient philosophy, \u2018sophisma\u2019 in medieval\nphilosophy is a technical term with no pejorative connotation: a\nsophisma proper is a sentence (proposition) that raises a\ndifficulty for logic or grammar: it is a proposition whose truth value\nis difficult to determine, because it is ambiguous, puzzling or simply\ndifficult to interpret, or a sentence that can be shown to be both\ngrammatically correct and incorrect. Discussions of\nsophismata can be found in treatises of the twelfth century.\nLater they formed an important element of scholarly training in\nuniversities, featuring in different kinds of disputations: on a basic\nlevel the sophismata served to illustrate a theory, but they\nwere also used to test the limits of a theory. The so-called\nsophismata-literature flourished during the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries; evidence of many important developments in logic\nand natural philosophy can be found in texts of this kind, where\nmasters could feel free to investigate problems and develop their own\nviews, much more than they could in more academic and strictly\ncodified literary genres. In the wake of humanists\u2019 opposition\nto the educational practices of traditional universities, the genre of\nsophismata disappeared in the early sixteenth century.\n",
