Life and Works\n\nIsaac\n Polqar[1]\n was a Jewish philosopher who was a member of the Jewish Averroist\nSchool. He lived from the second half of the thirteenth century to the\nfirst half of the fourteenth century in northern\n Spain.[2]\n Little is known about Polqar\u2019s life and family. A short poem,\nwritten in his honor by a contemporary poet, Samuel Ibn Sasson,\nreveals that Polqar was known for his philosophical knowledge as well\nas for his expertise in the study of the Bible and the Mishnah. In\naddition, Sasson indicates that Polqar was also a poet, a physician,\nand a respected figure in his community (Baer 1938: 200).\n\nPolqar wrote several books, most of which are lost. He mentions some\nof these books in his main work \u02bfEzer ha-Dat (In\nSupport of the Law): Peirush le-Sefer Bereshit\n(Commentary on Genesis) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 39];\nPeirush le-Sefer Kohelet (Commentary on\nEcclesiastes) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 121, 123]; Sefer\nPeirush le-Tehillot (Commentary on the Book of Psalms)\n[\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 131]; and Musar ha-Banim\n(Instruction of the Sons) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 158].\nTwo of Polqar\u2019s works\u2014Iggeret ha-Tiqvah\n(Epistle on Hope) and Sefer be-Hak\u1e25ashat\nha-\u02bfi\u1e93tagninot (Refutation of\nAstrology)\u2014are mentioned by Abner of Burgos, the famous\nconvert to Christianity and polemicist against Judaism, in his\nTeshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref (Response to the\n Blasphemer)[3]\n and Min\u1e25at Qenaot (A\n Jealousy-Offering).[4]\n Two of Polqar\u2019s works are extant: Teshuvat Apikoros\n(A Response to the\n Heretic),[5]\n a letter he addressed to\n Abner,[6]\n and his major corpus, \u02bfEzer ha-Dat (In Support of\nthe Law). In addition, Polqar completed Isaac Albalag\u2019s\nwork Tiqqun De\u02bfot ha-Philosophim (Rectifying the\nOpinions of the Philosophers), a free paraphrase of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Maqasid al-Fal\u0101sifa\n(The Opinions of the Philosophers), most of which consists of\nAlbalag\u2019s own ideas and of a critique of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s presentation of philosophical ideas (see\nVajda 1960: 268).\n\nPolqar\u2019s main work \u02bfEzer ha-Dat is comprised of\nfive treatises. In the opening treatise, Polqar argues for the primacy\nof Jewish Law over other existing religious laws. For him, the Torah\nis the best law, and Moses, the lawgiver, is the paramount leader.\nTogether, they provide Jewish believers with the necessary groundwork\nfor attaining their ultimate purpose: the world to come. In this\ntreatise Polqar highlights particular themes, such as the exile and\nits meaning, faith in the messiah\u2019s ultimate arrival, Talmudic\nmethodology and its authority, and how to interpret the words of the\nSages. The choice of these themes seems to have been motivated by the\nChristians having made use of them in order to argue for the\nsuperiority of Christianity over Judaism.\n\nThe second treatise is composed of several different dialogues. The\nmain dialogue depicts a lively debate between two men with disparate\nworldviews: one is an old man who represents a traditional and\nanti-philosophical approach, while the other is a young man who is\nstrongly drawn to philosophy. The debate between these two figures\nreflects a well-known controversy between traditionalist Jews who were\nsuspicious of philosophy and Jewish philosophers who aimed to\nreconcile the study of philosophy with revelation. In this dialogue,\nthe traditionalist, as we shall see below, accuses the philosophers of\nholding heretical views such as denying God\u2019s unity, His\nomnipotence, His omniscience, and so forth, as a result of following\nGreek philosophy. The young philosopher, on the other hand, claims\nthat there is no contradiction between the Jewish faith and\nAristotelian philosophy.\n\nThe third treatise of the book is most likely based on the\ncorrespondence between Polqar and his former teacher Abner regarding\nastrology. The dialogue in this treatise is between a\n philosopher[7]\n (\u1e25aver) and an astrologer (hover). Whereas\nthe latter holds an extreme view of determinism, the former believes\nin man\u2019s free will.\n\nThe fourth treatise of the book presents a typology of four different\ngroups of people, who, according to Polqar, constitute the greatest\nenemies of Judaism and, as a consequence, of philosophy. The first\ngroup consists of those who reject science while claiming to be true\nbelievers. The second includes the Kabbalists, who claim to have\naccess to esoteric knowledge reaching back to the prophets, and who\nreject the philosopher\u2019s methods (such as syllogism) as\nlegitimate tools for evaluating knowledge claims. The third group\ncomprises those who accuse philosophers of holding radical\nnaturalistic views. According to this group, philosophers assert that\neverything is governed by nature and that even God cannot change its\ncourse. For these traditionalists, then, philosophers have turned\nnature into God\u2019s rival, not His intermediary. The fourth group\nincludes people who believe in magic, witchcraft, and the like.\n\nThe fifth treatise ends the book and describes a conversation between\na spirit and a man who lives in the material world. These two figures\ndebate the question of which is preferable: to be alive, when one can\nfully enjoy bodily and intellectual pleasures, or to be dead, when\none\u2019s soul is free from bodily desire. Polqar concludes this\nsection with a revelation: the two interlocutors hear the voice of the\nangel Gabriel, who supports the spirit\u2019s position according to\nwhich the soul\u2019s detachment from the body is preferable.\n2. Polqar and Abner of Burgos: Judaism vs. Christianity\n\nPolqar\u2019s objection to Abner\u2019s decision to abandon the\nfaith of his birth and to accept Christianity stems from his view that\na true religion cannot, under any circumstances, contradict basic\nphilosophical principles. Christianity, for Polqar, does contradict\nthose principles, and so it follows that Christianity is not a true\n religion:[8]\n\n\nThe essential principle and purpose of all knowledge in the view of\nall nations is the knowledge of the existence of God, may He be\nblessed, through whose power the encompassing sphere is moved. This\nwas first explained by our religion in the verse \u201cI am the\nLord\u201d [Exod. 20:2]. The second principle is His unity. This is\nexplained in the verse \u201cyou shall have no other gods before\nme\u201d [Exod. 20:3] and in the verse \u201cHear O Israel! The Lord\nis our God, the Lord is One\u201d [Deut. 6:4]. The third principle is\nthat He has no body, which is also known and revealed in the verse\n\u201cTake therefore good heed to yourself: for you saw no manner of\nform\u201d [Deut. 4:15], and also that He is not a force within a\nbody, in the sense that nothing that happens to dark bodies can be\nverified of Him, which is known and evident from the verse \u201cI\nthe Lord have not changed\u201d [Mal. 3:6]. It is known by every\nintelligent person that these beliefs are explained with firm proofs\nand full demonstration in the books about physics and metaphysics\nwritten by Aristotle, as is obvious to those who make the effort to\nstudy them, so that no one will reject them and deny them unless he is\na denier of the first principle, which the ancient sages considered to\nbe punishable by stoning. (Teshuvat Apikoros: 2b; cf.\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 35\u201336)\n\n\nThe philosophers, Polqar claims, have already demonstrated\n\u201cthese beliefs\u201d, that is, the three philosophical\nprinciples: the existence of God, His Unity, and His being neither a\nbody nor a force in a body, principles that were fully maintained by\nJews. While Christians sought to reconcile these principles with their\ntheological doctrines, their attempts to do so were unsuccessful in\nPolqar\u2019s view.\n\nPolqar\u2019s fundamental objection to Christianity as contradicting\nphilosophical principles is reflected in his disputes with Abner\nregarding (1) monotheism vs. the Trinity, and (2) God\u2019s\nincorporeality vs. the Incarnation.\n\nWhile Christianity, as perceived by Polqar, accepts the existence of\nGod, it rejects the other two principles\u2014God\u2019s unity and\nincorporeality\u2014because of its acceptance of the doctrines of the\nTrinity and the Incarnation. Hence, Christianity cannot be a true\nreligion. Polqar presents his critique chiefly in the second chapter\nof Teshuvat Apikoros and in the second section of treatise\none of \u02bfEzer ha-Dat, where he enumerates the three\nprinciples that should form the foundation of any true religion.\nAlthough he does not explicitly mention Christianity, we can\nconfidently assume, based on Abner\u2019s reference to this chapter\nin his Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, that the object of this\ncritique is the Christian believer.\n2.1 Monotheism vs. the Trinity and God\u2019s Incorporeality vs. the Incarnation\n2.1.1 Monotheism vs. the Trinity\n\nFor Polqar, since the philosophers have already demonstrated that God\nexists and that He is neither a body nor a force in a body, there is\nno need to repeat these arguments. For Abner, on the other hand,\njustifying the Trinity and the Incarnation and showing that these two\ndoctrines are in agreement with philosophical interpretations is the\nbasis upon which he wished to show the validity of Christianity and to\nconvince as many Jews as possible to convert. To achieve this purpose,\nhe quotes biblical verses and midrashim. One particularly interesting\ntext he uses is the midrash on Psalms 50:1, and he writes:\n\n\nThis is what is written in the midrash on the verse which says:\n\u201cGod (El), the Lord [YHVH] God\n(Elohim) spoke and summoned the world\u201d [Psalms 50:1].\nWhy did it mention the Name three times? To teach you that the Holy\nOne, blessed be He, created the world with these three names which\nstand for the three attributes with which He created the world. And\nthese are they: Wisdom [\u1e24okhma], Understanding\n[Tevunah], and Knowledge (Da\u02bfat). Wisdom from\nwhence? Because it is said\n\n\nthe Lord founded the earth by wisdom, etc.\u2026 Understanding?\nBecause it is said \u201cHe established the heavens by\nunderstanding\u201d. Knowledge? Because it is said \u201cby His\nknowledge the depths burst\n apart\u2026\u201d[9]\n\n\nOne must conclude from this passage that the world could not have been\ncreated unless the Creator possessed these three attributes which are\nindicated by His three names, \u201cGod (El), God\n(Elohim), and the Lord (YHVH)\u201d, because they\nare three (parts) of the one divine substance. They are indicated by\nthose three names (\u201cWisdom\u201d (\u1e24okhma),\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d (Tevunah), and\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (Da\u02bfat) because of their\nessential characteristics. For it would not be fitting to say that the\nHoly One, blessed be He, created the world by means of the power of\n\u201cnames\u201d, as the fools think, or by means of any other\nthing other than Himself and His truth. Indeed, He Himself is His\nwisdom, and He Himself is His understanding, and He Himself is His\nknowledge. (Teshuvotla-Me\u1e25aref: 15b\u201316a)\n\n\nGod created the world with three divine attributes: Wisdom\n(\u1e24okhma), denoted by His name YHVH (Lord);\nUnderstanding [Tevunah], denoted by His name\nEl (God); and Knowledge [Da\u02bfat],\ndenoted by His name Elohim (God). Abner identifies\n\u1e24okhma with universal wisdom, which is eternal and\nseparate from matter. Christians call this characteristic the\n\u201cFather\u201d. God\u2019s wisdom, which is \u201cthe cause of\neverything\u201d (sibbat ha-kol), is the primary\n\u201csource\u201d of all created beings. Tevunah is the\nparticular knowledge that is \u201cborn\u201d from the universal\nwisdom and is acknowledged by Christians as the\n \u201cSon\u201d.[10]\nDa\u02bfat is placed between the two attributes: it is the\nintermediary between \u1e24okhma and Tevunah,\nbetween universal and particular wisdom. It has a role similar to the\nsyllogistic middle term, which connects the major term and the minor\nterm; without a middle term, there is no valid syllogism and without\nDa\u02bfat there is no particular knowledge. Abner continues to argue\nthat Da\u02bfat denotes Elohim because of its\ngrammatically plural appearance: exactly\n\n\nSince \u201cknowledge\u201d (Da\u02bfat) is between the two\nnames, God (El) and Lord (YHVH), in the verse,\n\u201cFor the Lord is an all-knowing God\u201d\u2014and since it is\nthe \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d, as has been mentioned, it is fitting\nthat the name \u201cGod\u201d (Elohim) is related to\nknowledge, since it is between the two other names\u2014El\nand YHVH\u2014in the verse \u201cGod (El), God\n(Elohim), and the Lord (YHVH)\u201d. For this\nreason, it is in the plural, like the words \u201cGod\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. It teaches us about itself and the other two,\njust as the relationship teaches us about itself and the two related\nthings altogether. For this reason, the name \u201cGod\u201d\n(Elohim) by itself teaches us about the three attributes together.\n(Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref: 17a)\n\n\nThe plural form Elohim indicates a relation which is derived\nfrom the other two divine names, El and YHVH.\nDa\u02bfat, which denotes God\u2019s name Elohim,\nis what the Christians refer to as the \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d.\nUsing this midrash serves Abner\u2019s goal: demonstrating the\nexistence of the Trinity from rabbinic sources. He argues that the\nSages\u2019 purpose in this midrash is to demonstrate that the names\nof God parallel the existence of three aspects in Him, without\ndamaging His unity. He reinforces this claim by using Aristotelian\nnotions such as the \u201cActive Intellect\u201d and syllogism, thus\nsupporting his argument from a philosophical point of view as well.\nAbner reinforces his claim by suggesting that the justification for\nthe Trinity\u2014intellect (sekhel), the intellectually\ncognizing subject (maskil), and the thing that is\nintellectually cognized (muskal)\u2014is accepted by\nAristotelians and that therefore, the Trinity does not imply\nmultiplicity in God.\n2.1.2 God\u2019s Incorporeality vs. the Incarnation\n\nFor Maimonides and Polqar, the belief in the unity of God is the\nfundamental principle of any true religion. For Abner, on the other\nhand, the Incarnation is the most important doctrine in Christianity:\nthe belief in the Trinity being not an independent doctrine, but\nmerely a prerequisite for believing in the Incarnation:\n\n\nFirst of all, the Christians are not required to maintain the belief\nin the Trinity except that it is necessary for belief in the\nIncarnation of God in human form because of the attribute\n\u201cSon\u201d which creates particulars in the existence, as has\nbeen explained. For without this, neither the immortality of the soul\nafter death nor their receipt of reward and punishment in the world to\ncome could be established. In this way the Torah, which gives\nexistence and permanence to the existence of the human species and\nindividual personalities according to what is possible, is\nestablished. Furthermore, as I proved above, the beliefs which cause\nthe performance of the commandments are (the ones which are) incumbent\nupon us to believe in. (Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref: 21b)\n\n\nThis statement emphasizes two things, the first of which is the\nIncarnation\u2019s key role in the existence of particulars in the\nworld. In other words, if there were no Incarnation, there would be no\ncreated things. Belief in the three substantive attributes is\nessential for existence because it explains the becoming of the world\nand the existence of multiplicity through the \u201cSon\u201d.\nSecondly, Abner stipulates that the fulfillment of two important\ntheological principles\u2014retribution in the form of rewards and\npunishments and the immortality of the soul, two Jewish\nprinciples\u2014is dependent on belief in the Incarnation. God as an\nactive force in the world governs individuals: namely, each person is\nrewarded or punished according to his deeds. Thus, only acceptance of\nthe doctrine of God\u2019s Incarnation in the Son can make it\npossible to believe in the immortality of the soul and the redemption\nof human beings (cf. Hecht 1993: 494).\n2.2 The Authority of the Talmud and the Jewish Sages\n\nIn Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, Abner consistently uses Jewish\nsources in order to prove that the doctrines of the Christian faith\nare true. He aims to show that although the Jews of his own time\nreject Christianity altogether, the Talmudic Sages, upon whom they\nrely, tacitly accepted Christianity\u2019s fundamental beliefs. Once\nagain, this topic is omitted in Teshuvat Apikoros; however,\nPolqar devotes two different chapters in \u02bfEzer ha-Dat to\nillustrating the erroneous use the Christians made of these texts.\n\nIn his Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, Abner discusses rabbinic\ntexts in extensive detail. When it suits his purposes, he cites\nrabbinic texts to show that the Talmudic Sages did, in fact, accept\nChristian doctrines; however, they could not disclose them to the\npeople, who were not ready to accept these beliefs (cf. Teshuvot\nla-Me\u1e25aref: 15b; 16b; 17a; 18ab). In other cases, Abner\naccuses the Jewish Sages of behaving unethically (Ibid: 33b; 34b). In\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat, Polqar does not offer a detailed response\nto Abner\u2019s hermeneutical attacks. Instead, he proposes a general\nsolution that clarifies the role of the Talmud and the significance of\nthe rabbinic texts.\n\nThe closing sections of treatise one in \u02bfEzerha-Dat\nexemplifies Polqar\u2019s threefold method. Firstly, he sets forth\nthe importance of the Oral Law, which is necessary for filling out the\nwritten law. While the Written Torah only sketches out the general\nfeatures of the law, the Oral Law explains in detail how man should\ninterpret and apply that law. Secondly, he narrates the historical\nevents that led Rabina and Rav Ashi, the two Amoraic sages who\ncompiled and revised the Babylonian Talmud, to write down the Oral\nLaw: the exile and the great risk of losing Talmudic foundations,\nrulings, and\n interpretations.[11]\n Thirdly, Polqar proclaims that the Talmud has many layers of meaning;\nsome assertions must be taken at face value, while other must be\nunderstood in an esoteric sense.\n\nIn addition to the Talmud, Polqar lists other texts that were written\nby the Jewish Sages but cannot be considered \u201cTalmud\u201d,\nsince this word refers only to the rabbinic interpretations of the\ncommandments. Because these texts are only of an aggadic and not a\nhalakhic nature, they do not possess any intrinsic authority, but have\nvalue only if they accord with or can be interpreted to accord with\nfundamental philosophical\n principles.[12]\n\nPolqar argues forcefully, in a general fashion, that all of\nAbner\u2019s allegations are, in principle, invalid. Polqar lists two\nmain justifications for his wholesale rejection of Abner\u2019s\nallegations. Firstly, according to Polqar, if rabbinic passages\ncontradict fundamental philosophical principles, then they should be\nviewed as non-halakhic midrashic texts. Insofar as all the quotations\nthat Abner uses in Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref are not\nconsidered \u201cLaw\u201d, we need not accept the conclusions drawn\nfrom them. He writes:\n\n\nMoreover, look at the confusion of your thought in your dependence\nupon a few legends of the Talmud that one cannot explain and take in\nany manner one wishes. Even if they are elucidated and explained\ncorrectly according to your opinion, they are (just) the teachings of\nindividuals, on account of which we will not turn aside or deviate in\nany direction from the belief in the Torah of Moses, may peace be upon\nhim. They do not suffice for Jews, since he [Moses] was the master of\nall the prophets and the Sages, according to the belief of all the\nnations. All the more so (they do not suffice) for negating and\noverturning [the Torah]. (Teshuvat Apikoros: 6b)\n\n\nNot only are we not obliged to accept the sources cited by Abner,\nbut\u2014and this is Polqar\u2019s second reason for dismissing\nAbner\u2019s claims\u2014Abner\u2019s reading of these sources,\naccording to Polqar, is tendentious. Abner deliberately reads these\npassages so that they cohere with his line of thought, without\nconsidering the possibility of other interpretations.\n\nIn the process of invalidating Abner\u2019s use of the Talmudic\npassages, Polqar reveals his view of the hierarchy of Jewish sources.\nNaturally, he ranks the \u201cTorah of Moses\u201d as the highest\nsource. Unlike the Sages of the Talmud, whose legal teachings are\nincumbent only upon Jews, the Torah of Moses offers fundamental\nuniversal truths accepted by both Judaism and Christianity.\n\nPolqar concludes his discussion regarding the Talmudic Sages by\nrejecting the opinions of the heretics (epikursin) who mock\nand deny the veracity of some of the Talmudic stories,\ninterpretations, and rulings [\u02bfEzerha-Dat: 65\u201367].\nThe Talmud is a source of knowledge for two types of students: the\nfirst is intelligent, perceptive, and a quick learner, while the\nsecond has a limited understanding, and therefore depends on\ntraditional knowledge without developing the urge to discover its\nprofound meanings. The Talmudic Sages, Polqar maintains, deliberately\nincluded popular knowledge in their teachings as a pathway for the\nsecond type of student, so that he, too, could have a part in true\nknowledge.\n\nThe Sages\u2019 goal was to provide each student with knowledge that\nsuited his abilities. The perceptive disciple grasps the true meaning\nthat will, eventually, lead him to the ultimate goal: the eternity of\nhis soul. The other disciple remains at a lower level of attaining\nknowledge, and is guided by the Sages for educational purposes\nonly.\n2.3 The Messiah: has he already come?\n\nDetermining whether or not the messiah to whom Hebrew sources refer\nhas already come, as Christians maintain, could not be demonstrated\nthrough philosophical investigation. It could only be demonstrated by\ninterpreting scriptural verses and rabbinic texts well known to both\nAbner and Polqar, and by examining how the picture of the messiah and\nthe messianic era that emerges from that interpretation coheres or\ndoes not cohere with past empirical events. In other words, Polqar\nchose prophetic verses that show that Jesus did not bring about the\nmessianic era described by the prophets. On the other hand, Abner, who\nsought to prove just the opposite, used the same verses, as well as\nothers, to demonstrate that Jesus and the messianic era he inaugurated\ndid in fact correspond precisely to what the prophets had\ndescribed.\n\nOne of the main differences between Judaism and Christianity is rooted\nin each religion\u2019s approach to the messiah. While Christianity\nconsiders the messiah to be both divine and human, Judaism sees in the\nmessiah a human being of extraordinary character. Christian dogma\neducates its believers to live their lives as if the messiah has\nalready come; their way of living is a preparation for the world to\ncome. In Judaism, the messianic era is located in the future, and it\nfeatures the restoration of Jewish sovereignty over the land of Israel\nand a world in which all nations dwell in peace with one another.\nThus, if the Jews accept the view that Jesus is the messiah, it\nfollows that any hope they maintain for that restoration is only folly\nand illusion.\n\nPolqar presents his theory regarding the messiah in the fifth chapter\nof his Teshuvat Apikoros and in the sixth chapter\n(sha\u2019ar) of treatise one of \u02bfEzer ha-Dat.\nThe texts presented in both works are almost identical, and differ in\nonly two places. The first difference is that the first paragraph in\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat contains a reference to Bil\u02bfam that is\nomitted from Teshuvat\n Apikoros,[13]\n while the second difference is that it is only in Teshuvat\nApikoros that Polqar refers to the Muslims\n(Ishma\u02bfelim); this reference is absent from\n\u02bfEzer\n ha-Dat.[14]\n\nRejecting the claim that the messianic era has already begun, Polqar\nfocuses on three prophetic predictions concerning the nature of the\nmessianic era; none of these, Polqar maintains, have come to pass. The\nfirst is Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy that the Israelites will reside in\nthe land of Israel. Ezekiel foresaw that\n\n\nthey [the Israelites] shall remain in the land which I gave to my\nservant Jacob\u2026they and their children and their\nchildren\u2019s children shall dwell there forever, with my servant\nDavid as their prince for all time.\n\n\nReality, however, shows that the Jews do not reside in the land of\nIsrael. On the contrary, they have suffered a long and painful exile,\nwhile foreigners settled in the land.\n\nThe second prediction concerns the war between Gog and Magog. Ezekiel\nprophesized that only after that war \u201cI [LORD] will be zealous\nfor My holy name\u201d [Ezek. 39:25], and \u201cI will never again\nhide my face from them\u201d [Ezek. 39:29]. The Jews\u2019 dreadful\ncondition proves that the war has not yet occurred, and therefore that\nthe messiah cannot have come. Finally, the third prediction concerns\nthe rebuilding of Jerusalem and the holy temple; as Amos states,\n\u201cIn that day I will set up again the fallen booth of\nDavid\u201d [Amos 9:11]. He also predicts the third ingathering of\nthe Jews: \u201cAnd I will plant them upon their soil nevermore to be\nuprooted from the soil I have given them, says the Lord your\nGod\u201d [Amos 9:15]. The first ingathering was connected with the\nbuilding of the First Temple; the second was connected with the Second\nTemple; the third is to occur upon the building of the Third Temple.\nPolqar cites these verses to indicate that Jerusalem and the Temple\nhave not yet been rebuilt; it follows that this third ingathering has\nnot yet occurred.\n\nBefore quoting the relevant verses from the prophetic books, Polqar\nsets forth two principles that must be taken into account when\nexamining the prophecies. Firstly, he declares that any prophecy\nstating that the Jews will never again be exiled cannot be applied to\nthe Second Temple period, especially if the word \u201cforever\u201d\n[le\u02bfolam] appears in it, insofar as the current\nsituation shows that the Second Temple period was followed by exile.\nSecondly, Polqar states that all of the prophecies concerning the\nSecond Temple period which predict the building of Zion and Jerusalem\ncannot be applied to Jesus, for \u201cthose who believe in him\n[Jesus] are further from him than they are from ruling over that\nland\u201d [Teshuvat Apikoros: 4b]. Merging these two\nprinciples with his interpretation of the prophetic message serves\nPolqar\u2019s goal: rejecting Christianity as a true religion. Abner,\nnot surprisingly, applies these very prophecies to the Second Temple\nperiod and to Jesus (cf. Joseph Shalom in Rosenthal 1961: 44).\nAccording to him, the arrival of the messiah was the final stage in\nestablishing the correct beliefs, which is to say the fundamental\nChristian theological doctrines, in the hearts of human beings. The\nTrinity, he states, was originally concealed from the people of Israel\ndue to its complexity and to the risk it posed: if it were\nmisunderstood, it might lead the Jews to worship idols. The final\nIncarnation, namely the Incarnation in Jesus, would guarantee the\npeople\u2019s belief in reward and punishment in this world and the\nnext.\n3. Determinism and Free Will\n\nIt would appear that a religious person, especially one who belongs to\nthe Jewish faith, which stresses praxis, must affirm the position that\nhuman beings have free will; for if free will were denied, it would\nnecessarily follow that the commandments have no meaning. But how can\nthis religious affirmation co-exist with the fundamental religious\naffirmation of God\u2019s omniscience?\n\nAccording to the theory of radical determinism, any action we take\nonly appears to be the result of our choosing that particular action\nover others. In truth, however, our choice is the outcome of various\npredetermined factors that cause it to happen in a certain time and\nplace. Unlike radical determinists, the non-radical determinists, such\nas Polqar rejected the view according to which man\u2019s actions are\ndetermined and only appear to be the result of one\u2019s free\nchoice. The non-radical determinists admit that there is a connection\nbetween the upper-lunar world and the sublunary world, however this\nconnection is restricted merely to natural events; for example, an\noccurrence of an eclipse is determined and therefore can be known and\npredicted, unlike man\u2019s decision to act in a certain way. For\nAbner, determinism is entailed by God\u2019s omniscience, His\nabsolute knowledge of past, present, and future. Any affirmation of\none\u2019s liberty in making decisions and choosing specific actions\nis incompatible with this idea of God\u2019s perfect knowledge. In\nsum, for Abner, ascribing free will to human beings denies God\u2019s\nomniscience. In opposition to Abner, Polqar attempts to reconcile the\nidea of man\u2019s ability to choose with the concept of God\u2019s\nperfect knowledge. Polqar rejects Abner\u2019s view and contends that\nallowing man\u2019s free will alongside God\u2019s omniscience is\nthe only way to defend God\u2019s perfection.\n\nIn his Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Abner raises several arguments\nwhich support his radical determinism. One of these arguments is\ndirectly concerned with the question of man\u2019s free will. He\nwrites:\n\n\nThe third argument, particular to man, is from the aspect of the\nintellectual soul. He [Isaac] said that the intellectual soul is\nseparate and distinct from matter, and that the heavenly bodies,\ninsofar as they are material, lack the power to act upon it through\nanything. And because one could object that a separate power\ncan act upon the intellectual soul by compelling it to act or to\nreceive an action, and to will at times or not to will at times, he\nbolstered his utterances in this third argument by saying that if\nhuman accidents came about through necessitation and decree, then the\npropositions of our Holy Law would be destroyed; and all its\ncommandments and prohibitions would be in vain; and it would not be\nproper for the righteous man to receive reward for his good deeds, nor\nwould it be proper to punish the wicked, since all their actions would\nbe necessitated. Isaac took this support from the statements of Moses\nthe Egyptian and the other early theologians who spoke about this\nmatter. (Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter 2)\n\n\nMaterial objects cannot influence things that are separate from\nmatter. Since the intellectual soul is separate from matter, material\nobjects\u2014and here Abner is referring to the heavenly\nbodies\u2014cannot act upon it. However, Abner responds, while\nPolqar\u2019s argument explains why material bodies cannot act upon\nman\u2019s intellectual soul, it fails to explain why the separate\nintellects cannot act upon it. Abner stated that due to the weakness\nof his argument, Polqar needed to strengthen it from a theological\npoint of view; therefore, he supplemented his original argument with\nthe claim that the Mosaic commandments have no validity unless we\nassume that humans have free choice. Therefore, Abner concludes\nthat:\n\n\nIsaac not only wished to do away with astral decrees, but he also\nwished to do away with God\u2019s knowledge and His decrees\nconcerning all accidental and possible things. Because of this, he\nsaid in his book that we ought not to believe in any way that such\nthings can be known, or observed by any knower, before they exist.\nHence he implied that they cannot be known nor observed by God.\n(Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter 2)\n\n\nTo support his contrary conclusion, Abner quotes verses from the Old\nand New Testaments that in his view clearly show that God, with His\neternal knowledge, governs things in a particular manner. For example,\nJob 34:21\u201322 states: for His eyes are upon a man\u2019s\nways; He observes his every step. Neither darkness nor gloom offers a\nhiding-place for evildoers; and Psalms 33:13\u201315, The\nLord looks down from heaven; He sees all mankind. From His\ndwelling-pace He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth\u2014He\nwho fashions the hearts of the all, who discerns all their\ndoings. Presumably, since Polqar\u2019s last point here is in\nAbner\u2019s view purely theological, it is sufficient for Abner to\nrespond to it by citing biblical proof texts.\n\nPolqar\u2019s response to Abner leans first on Maimonides\u2019\nargument according to which God\u2019s knowledge and human knowledge\nhave nothing in common [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 136\u2013137;\nGuide of the Perplexed 3:20]. Therefore, we cannot even ask\nwhat God knows, or in what way He knows it. After establishing that\nthe knowledge of God is essentially different from that of humans,\nPolqar seems to contradict his own view that God\u2019s knowledge\ndoes not change. According to one passage, God\n\n\ndesires (\u1e25afe\u1e93) possibility as long as [the\npossible] exists, and then He produces things from this absolute\npotentiality and possibility when He so desires\n(ya\u1e25fo\u1e93). (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 137).\n\n\nHow can Polqar claim that God \u201cdesires\u201d something, when\ndesiring something implies an external need? Here it seems as if\nPolqar uses the word \u201cdesire\u201d to indicate the laws of\nnature: natural, accidental, and voluntary causes are within the\nnatural laws. Just as there are natural causes in the natural order,\nsimilarly, Polqar claims, the natural order contains possibility.\nThus, asking why possibility exists is similar to asking why a stone\nfalls down when we throw it: it falls because that is its nature.\n\nAfter establishing that God\u2019s knowledge is essentially different\nfrom human knowledge, Polqar turns to answer the following question:\nif God\u2019s knowledge is eternal, unchangeable, and complete, how\nis it possible to argue that men are free to choose their actions? In\none of his arguments, Polqar claims that men do have the liberty of\nchoosing, but that this ability is restricted to intellectuals. If a\nman does not actualize his intellect, he is no different from an\nanimal which acts on instinct alone:\n\n\nThe second argument is that it has been demonstrated that the\nexistence of something separate and distinct from matter is more\nexcellent and worthy than something material. Similarly, actions that\nare separate from matter are greater and more powerful than material\nactions. Also, the regression of the series of all agents terminates\nat a thing that is utterly separate from matter, so that we truly say\nthat [only] separate things are truly agents, and material things are\nacted upon. Now man\u2019s rational soul, from which desire and volition\nare produced, is separate from matter, and is analogous to the\nsupernal agents. Hence it is impossible for a material body to act\nupon it [man\u2019s rational soul]. This is what the rabbis meant\nwhen they said (Talmud Sab. 156a): \u201cIsrael is not subject to\nfate\u201d and \u201cThe gentiles are intimidated, but Israel is not\nintimidated\u201d, as I explained above [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat:\n124]. Hence those who maintain that the qualities of the soul proceed\nfrom, and are decreed by, the heavenly bodies simply err and are\nmistaken. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 139\u2013140)\n\n\n\u201cIsrael\u201d, Polqar\u2019s term for intellectuals, refers to\nthose people who use their intellectual faculty, the non-material part\nof their soul, in order to know God. According to Polqar, most human\nbeings are like animals, enslaved to their desires, and consequently\nlack freedom of choice; controlled by their desires, they differ from\nthe intellectuals, who live in accordance with the intellectual soul\nand who therefore are capable of choosing proper actions.\nParadoxically, however, if the intellectuals constantly follow their\nrational faculty, they, similar to the separate intellects, are\nprevented from choosing how to act because they are constantly\ndirected by the rational force. It would then follow that living\naccording to the intellect does not guarantee unconditional freedom,\nas intellectuals are still subject to reason. That said, it seems\nlikely that Polqar would agree that following the intellect\nnecessarily leads one to make rational decisions in one\u2019s life,\nwhich is the proper way to live.\n\nAbner alleged that Polqar\n\n\nnot only wished to do away with astral decrees, but also wished to do\naway with God\u2019s knowledge and His decrees concerning all\naccidental and possible things. (Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter\n2)\n\n\nPolqar certainly did away with astral decrees, insofar as he\ndemonstrated that the heavenly bodies do not influence man\u2019s\nintellectual soul, because heavenly bodies are material bodies, and\nmaterial bodies cannot act upon man\u2019s non-material soul.\nAbner\u2019s additional argument, that the separate intellects can\nact upon one\u2019s soul even if we accept that the heavenly bodies\ndo not, is presented by Polqar himself as follows:\n\n\nThe activities of the rational soul are not generated from it by\nvirtue of its being rational. Therefore, I can reply to my critic that\na material agent may act upon it from the aspect of its not being\nrational, a fortiori that an immaterial agent may act upon\nit. Moreover, the human soul is not entirely separate from matter, but\nonly the acquired intellect, which is the agent intellect. Its\nactivity takes place only through the intermediary of the intellect\nthat is acted upon, which Aristotle considered to be subject to\ngeneration and destruction. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nInterestingly, the astrologer\u2019s objection, as presented by\nPolqar, includes activities (pe\u02bfulot ha-Nefesh) which\nclearly belong to the practical part of the soul in the intellectual\npart of the soul (ha-nefesh ha-hoga). In his view,\none\u2019s activities, since they do not derive from the intellectual\nsoul, are subject to being changed by a material agent, here the\nheavenly bodies. These activities are even more subject to an\nimmaterial agent: the separate intellect. The human soul, argues the\nastrologer, is not entirely separate from matter, and therefore the\nclaim that heavenly bodies can act upon it stands.\n\nPolqar, well aware of Abner\u2019s objection in Min\u1e25at\nQenaot, replies to the astrologer as follows:\n\n\nFrom what you have written in your astrology, the activity of wisdom\nin the human soul is decreed from the heavens. Now will you say of\nthis activity that it is not generated and originated in the\nsoul by virtue of the latter\u2019s being rational? As for your\nremark in your answer that \u201ca fortiori an immaterial\nagent can act upon it\u201d, you know well that our only disagreement\nconcerns the activity of the heavenly bodies, and not the activities\nof the separate entities. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nPolqar clearly considers Abner\u2019s objection to be valid, and\ntherefore he narrows his argument. Here he makes it clear that he\nrejects only the idea that the heavenly bodies, or any other\nmaterial body, act upon one\u2019s intellectual soul. In contrast,\nthe Active Intellect acts upon one\u2019s intellectual soul; indeed,\nseparate intellects are the only entities that can act upon\nman\u2019s intellectual soul. The Active Intellect acts upon\none\u2019s soul according to one\u2019s level of study of the\ntheoretical sciences: the more one occupies oneself with studying the\nsciences, the more the Active Intellect acts upon one\u2019s\nintellectual soul. Therefore, Polqar argues, his argument rejecting\nastrology is valid.\nMan\u2019s will vs. Natural will\n\nIn the last argument, the scholar clarifies to the astrologer the main\ndifferences between human will and the will of \u201cnatural\nthings\u201d:\n\n\nThe third argument: It is known that natural things behave in one\nmanner without the possibility of their being able to change their\nfunction and to act in a manner opposite to that to which they are\naccustomed. The soul\u2019s actions [mif\u02bfalei\nha-nafshyyim] are those that occasionally effect one thing and\noccasionally effect its opposite, according to their choice. If the\nacts of the soul were necessitated and compelled and decreed, then\nthey would be similar to natural acts, with absolutely no difference\nbetween them. If this were so, then how could the soul be considered\nto be the perfection of a natural body? For then the perfection of a\nbody would only be through its natural deeds, which would abolish the\nexistence of every soul. All these are sophistries, calumnies, and\nfollies. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nPolqar argues that depriving humans of free choice, as Abner suggests,\nwould entail that natural things and things endowed with souls would\noperate in a similar manner. This would mean that human actions would\nnot only be similar to natural actions, such as the occurrence of an\neclipse or the rising of the sun, but that human actions would also be\nessentially similar to the actions of the separate intellects. In\nother words, there would be no difference between the actions of\nperfect beings, such as the separate intellects, and the actions of\nimperfect beings, such as humans, who are comprised of material and\nnon-material parts. Moreover, if man\u2019s \u201cvoluntary\u201d\nactions were determined in the same way as the actions of natural\nthings, there would be no essential difference between man\u2019s\nperfect part, his soul, and his imperfect part, his body; for if all\nactions of man\u2019s soul, bodily and intellectual, happened\nnecessarily, such a distinction would no longer exist.\n\nIn sum, Polqar\u2019s discussion of God\u2019s foreknowledge and\nman\u2019s free will is a direct reply to the arguments raised by\nAbner in Min\u1e25at Qenaot. Polqar clearly modified his\narguments so as to make them more efficient against Abner\u2019s\nobjections. Polqar concludes the debate between the scholar,\npresumably presenting his own view, and the astrologer, presumably\nrepresenting Abner, as follows: firstly, possible and accidental\nthings are not predestined and cannot be known by any knower\n(including God) before they happen. Secondly, man\u2019s intellectual\nsoul is free from determinism. Finally, natural things are essentially\ndifferent from psychic things: the former act in a necessary way,\nwhile the latter act in a contingent manner.\n4. Conclusions\n\nPolqar\u2019s project is threefold. Firstly, he seeks to defend\nJudaism as a true religion against Christianity. For Polqar, true\nreligion coincides with philosophical principles. His defense of\nJudaism against the Christian convert Abner of Burgos essentially\nconsists of the claim that while Judaism coincides with true\nphilosophy and hence is a true religion, Christianity contains\ndoctrines such as the Trinity and the Incarnation that contradict true\nphilosophy and hence is not a true religion. In addition to his\ncritique of Christianity, Polqar uses hermeneutical arguments to\nreinforce his position that Judaism is a true religion. Secondly,\nPolqar, similarly to his fellow Jewish Averroists, wishes to defend\nthe discipline of philosophy. By philosophy, Polqar means\nAverroes\u2019 interpretation of Aristotle. As a consequence, he\noffers an Averroistic interpretation of Judaism and becomes one of the\nmain representatives of Jewish Averroism. His Averroistic commitments\nalso determine his interpretation of Maimonides: his preference for\nMaimonides\u2019 radical views over his harmonizing views, as well as\nhis occasional deviation from Maimonides. Polqar\u2019s third aim is\nto defend his philosophical interpretation of Judaism. From a social\nand political point of view, Polqar\u2019s unreserved embrace of\nphilosophy raised problems within the Jewish community: he had to\nrefute the Jewish traditionalists\u2019 charge that he was a heretic,\nled astray by philosophy, to avoid weakening a community already under\nconsiderable pressure in its Christian environment through internal\nconflict stemming from views perceived as unorthodox. This explains\nhis use of an \u201cesoteric\u201d writing practice through which he\nconceals some of his more radical views from the non-philosophers\namong his readers. This strategy is explicitly highlighted in the\nintroduction to \u02bfEzer ha-Dat, where he declares that due\nto political and social circumstances he must conceal his genuine\nopinion in order to avoid being accused of heresy by those who are\nincapable of understanding his philosophical approach. Polqar\u2019s\nidentification of Judaism and true philosophy, moreover, requires a\nclarification of the difference between true science and\npseudo-science (for example, astrology and divination), and between\ncorrect and incorrect interpretations of Judaism (among the latter,\nfor example, those of the Kabbalists). The major claim guiding my\ninterpretation is that Polqar advances a systematic naturalistic\ninterpretation of Judaism, which in many cases does not agree with\ntraditional Jewish views.\n\nPolqar\u2019s philosophy should thus be seen as part of the Jewish\nAverroist school and as one of several attempts made by\npost-Maimonidean Jewish thinkers to use Maimonides\u2019 ideas and\nmethods to bring the Aristotelian philosophy taught by Averroes and\nthe principles of the Jewish faith more closely together.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Manuscripts", "Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Manuscripts": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Polqar, Isaac, <em>\u02bfEzer ha-Dat</em> [In Support of the Law],\nBreslau, Juedisch-theologisches Seminar Ms. 57 [F 40014, 46902].\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"PrimSour\">"], "Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Abner of Burgos (Alfonso of Valladolid), <em>Min\u1e25at\nQenaot</em>, Hebrew sections of the book, translated by Isaac Baer, in\n\u201cThe book of Min\u1e25at Qenaot of Abner of Burgos and its\ninfluence on Rabbi Hasdai Crescas\u201d, <em>Tarbiz</em>,\n11(1939\u201340): 188\u2013206.
