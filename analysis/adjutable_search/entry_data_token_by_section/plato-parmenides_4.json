Socrates expresses\nconfidence in the existence of separate forms of justice, beauty,\ngoodness, and every form of that sort, uncertainty about the existence\nof separate forms of humanity, fire, and water, and outright skepticism\nabout the existence of separate forms for hair, mud, and\ndirt.\n\n\nIt is unclear why Socrates finds himself in doubt about the\nexistence of forms for natural kinds (such as humans and water) and\nstuffs or mixtures (such as hair and mud). For some commentators,\nSocrates simply makes \u201ca wrong admission\u201d as a result of\nhis youth and inexperience (Allen 1997, 124; see also Sayre 1996,\n74). After all, Plato alludes to a form of bee at Meno 72b\u2013c,\na form of shuttle at Cratylus 389d, and forms of bed and of\ntable at Republic 596b. Although shuttles, tables, and beds\nare artifacts, and hence perhaps relevantly different from natural\nkinds, such as human beings and water, there seems no reason to think\nthat humans differ from bees in regard to whether they have\ncorresponding forms. However, it is difficult to understand why\nPlato would pen a conversation in which a character who\nembodies his own middle period theory would admit something he has no\ngood reason to admit.\n\n\nOne possibility (see Gill 1996, 22) is that Plato is alluding to the\nmiddle period thesis that only certain types of properties summon the\nunderstanding to think about forms. For example, in the\nRepublic, Socrates claims that whereas \u201cthe\nsoul isn\u2019t compelled to ask the understanding what a finger is,\nsince sight doesn\u2019t suggest to it that a finger is at the same\ntime the opposite of a finger\u201d (523d2\u20136), the soul is compelled\nto ask what the large is and what the small is when sight suggests to\nit that the index finger is both big (relative to the pinky) and small\n(relative to the middle finger). If forms were merely posited to\nexplain the compresence of contrary properties in sensible things, then\nthere would be no need to posit a form corresponding to properties\n(such as water and dirt) that have no contraries. However, this\nis unlikely to be the source of Socrates\u2019 worry here, for the\nRepublic passage does not discuss metaphysical reasons for\npositing the existence of forms, but rather discusses the psychological\nand epistemic question of what prompts the soul to think of forms that\nhave already been posited.\n\n\nAnother option (Rickless 2007, 54\u201355; see also Miller 1986, 46) is that\nPlato means us to recognize a tension between Self-Predication and\nSeparation (or Non-Identity) in the theory of forms. On the one\nhand, the fact that justice is just, beauty beautiful, and goodness\ngood does not suggest that justice, beauty, and goodness are concrete,\nsensible things. That is, Self-Predication gives us no reason to\ndeny that justice, beauty, and goodness are separate forms, numerically\ndistinct from sensible things. By contrast, if there are forms\nfor human and mud, then Self-Predication requires that the human be a\nhuman being and the mud be muddy. It is difficult to see how\nhuman things and muddy things could be non-sensible. So\nSelf-Predication gives us at least some reason to deny that there is a\nform for human and mud that is distinct from every sensible\nthing. This interpretation meshes well with Socrates\u2019\nremark that hair, mud, and dirt \u201care in fact just what we\nsee\u201d and that it is for this reason that \u201cit\u2019s too\noutlandish to think there is a form for them\u201d\n(Parmenides 130d3\u20135).\n",
