    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Experience || Pre-Reflective Self-Consciousness\n3.2 Pre-Reflective Self-Consciousness\n\nIf first-person thought is not grounded in an awareness of the self as\nan object, then some other account is arguably required to account for\nthe capacity to entertain self-conscious thought (O\u2019Brien\n1995a). One suggestion is that subjects possess a form of\n\u201cpre-reflective self-awareness\u201d as a necessary condition\nof consciousness (Sartre 1937, 1943: Introduction; Zahavi 2005, 2007;\nLegrand 2006; cf. Kriegel 2009. For criticism, see Schear 2009; also\nsee the entry on\n phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness).\n On this view, all conscious experience involves an implicit awareness\nof oneself as its subject without explicitly representing the self as\nan object of awareness (cf. Musholt\u2019s distinction between\n\u201cself-representationalist\u201d and\n\u201cnon-self-representationalist\u201d accounts of non-conceptual\nself-consciousness (2015: chs. 3\u20134)). Indeed, it might be argued\nthat the necessity of an active agent\u2019s possessing some form of\nself-awareness follows from the connection between action and\nself-consciousness that many suppose to have been established by\nconsiderations of the essential indexical discussed in\n \u00a72.1\n (cf. Berm\u00fadez 1998).\n\nThese views are closely associated with theories that explain\nconsciousness in terms of self-consciousness\n (\u00a74.3).\n Pre-reflective self-awareness is \u201cpre-reflective\u201d,\naccording to its proponents, in the sense that it does not require one\nto explicitly reflect on one\u2019s own mental states, or to\notherwise take them as objects of attention. Rather, pre-reflective\nself-awareness is manifest even in those situations in which\none\u2019s attention is directed outwards toward worldly objects and\nevents. Pre-reflective self-awareness, then, is implicit in all\nconsciousness, providing one with a continuous awareness of oneself as\nthe subject of one\u2019s stream of experience.\n\nOne way in which such views can be understood is as maintaining that\nexperience involves self-consciousness in the mode, rather than the\ncontent, of conscious experience (Recanati 2007: part 5; 2012;\nO\u2019Brien 2007: ch. 6). This can be fleshed out by analogy with\nthe case of belief: one might claim that the concept of truth figures\nin the mode, but not the explicit content of every belief. That is,\nwhilst every belief is a holding true, it is not the case that every\nbelief has the content that such and such is true. Similarly, whilst\nevery experience is an experience of one\u2019s own, it is not the\ncase that every experience has the content that such and such is\nexperienced by oneself. Rather, the mode of conscious\nexperience (introspection, bodily awareness, etc.) includes an\nimplicit awareness of the self. A related view is that the self can be\nconsidered an \u201cunarticulated constituent\u201d of the\nexperience, just as some claim that \u201chere\u201d is an\nunarticulated constituent of \u201cIt is raining\u201d (Perry 1986;\nRecanati 2007: parts 9 & 10; for scepticism about unarticulated\nconstituents, see Cappelen & Lepore 2007). So, just as the person\nwho believes \u201cIt is raining\u201d is implicitly aware of the\nfact that it is here that it is raining, so the subject of\nself-conscious experience is implicitly aware of the fact that it is\nshe herself who is undergoing that experience.\n\nAccounts of self-consciousness as involving unarticulated\nconstituents, or as implicit in the mode of consciousness, will need\nto explain how the transition is made from such implicit\nself-awareness to the explicit representation of the self in\nfirst-person thought. One option is to appeal to the idea that certain\nsources of information are self-tracking or, in Perry\u2019s (2012)\nwords, \u201cnecessarily self-informative\u201d. A form of\nexperience is self-tracking if it is a way of coming to know of the\ninstantiation of properties of a certain type and, necessarily, a\nsubject can come to know, in that way, of the instantiation of her own\nstates only. For example, if it is true that a subject can only\nremember conscious episodes from her own past, then episodic\nmemory is self-tracking. If so, then the subject may legitimately\nthink the first-person thought \u201cI was F\u201d, on the\nbasis of her episodic memory of being F. This account may also\nbe used to explain IEM, since if a form of experience is\nself-tracking, then it will not be possible for me to know, in that\nway, that a is F but mistakenly think that it is me that\nis F on the grounds that I mistakenly believe myself to be\nidentical to a (Perry 2012; Recanati 2012; cf. Campbell 1999a;\nMartin 1995). Here we have an architectural feature of a given form of\nexperience (that it is necessarily an awareness of oneself) being\nemployed in an explanation of an epistemic feature of self-ascriptions\nbased on such experience (that they are not partly grounded in an\nidentity judgement). If I know, in the relevant way, that a is\nF, then it must be the case that I am a. On this view,\nmaking a first-person judgement grounded in a given form of experience\nis a matter of articulating the unarticulated self. The experience\nitself is not explicitly first-personal, representing the self as\noneself. Nevertheless, it \u201cconcerns\u201d the subject, in\nthat it is necessarily tied to the self (see Musholt 2015: ch. 5 for\nan alternative account).\n",
