    "main_text": "Sources of Knowledge and Justification || Memory\n5.3 Memory\n\nMemory is the capacity to retain knowledge acquired in the past. What\none remembers, though, need not be a past event. It may be a present\nfact, such as one\u2019s telephone number, or a future event, such as\nthe date of the next elections. Memory is, of course, fallible. Not\nevery experience as of remembering that p is an instance of\ncorrectly remembering that p. We should distinguish, therefore,\nbetween remembering that p (which entails the truth of\np) and seeming to remember that p (which does\nnot entail the truth of p).\n\nWhat makes memorial seemings a source of justification? Is it a\nnecessary truth that, if one has a memorial seeming that p, one\nhas thereby prima facie justification for p? Or is memory a\nsource of justification only if, as coherentists might say, one has\nreason to think that one\u2019s memory is reliable? Or is memory a\nsource of justification only if, as externalists would say, it is in\nfact reliable? Also, how can we respond to skepticism about knowledge\nof the past? Memorial seemings of the past do not guarantee that the\npast is what we take it to be. We think that we are older than five\nminutes, but it is logically possible that the world sprang into\nexistence just five minutes ago, complete with our dispositions to\nhave memorial seemings of a more distant past and items such as\napparent fossils that suggest a past going back millions of years. Our\nseeming to remember that the world is older than a mere five minutes\ndoes not entail, therefore, that it really is. Why, then, should we\nthink that memory is a source of knowledge about the\n past?[57]\n",
