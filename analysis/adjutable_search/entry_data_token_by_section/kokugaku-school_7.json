    "main_text": "Popular and Grassroots Kokugaku 1800\u20131868 || Female Kokugakusha\n4.3 Female Kokugakusha\nMatsuo Taseko (1811\u20131894)\n\nShinano province of present-day Nagano prefecture was home to another\nmajor agricultural community of Hirata disciples which totaled over\n630 members. This group featured one of only twenty-nine female\ndisciples who registered with the national academy. Matsuo Taseko\n(1811\u20131894) was a peasant woman of the Ina Valley who worked in\nfarming and sericulture. She was remarkably well educated in the\nJapanese classics and poetic tradition and composed waka\npoetry. Through her travels and interactions with important political\nmen, Taseko participated in significant events of the late Tokugawa\nperiod and Meiji Restoration. Following the arrival of U.S. Commodore\nMatthew C. Perry\u2019s \u201cBlack Ships\u201d and the\n\u201copening\u201d of Japan\u2019s ports to Western vessels,\nTaseko travelled to Edo in 1855 where she interacted with the Daimyo\nof the Takasu domain, Matsudaira Yoshitatsu (1824\u201383), with whom\nshe probably discussed poetry and politics. While in Kyoto for six\nmonths from 1862 to 1863, Taseko conversed with prolific Tsuwano\ndomain nativist Fukuba Bisei (1831\u20131907) and Hirata Kanetane,\nand even played a part in delivering a copy of Atsutane\u2019s\nLectures on Ancient History (Koshiden) to Lord\nSanj\u014d. In her second visit to Kyoto in 1868, Taseko used her\nconnections and influence to help samurai establish\ncredentials as imperial loyal subjects, and she eventually gained a\nposition in the household of court noble and Meiji leader, Lord\nIwakura Tomomi (1825\u201383).\n\nIt was through her waka poetry that Taseko voiced her loyalty\nto the imperial court and the cause of the Imperial Restoration. She\nexpressed her ardent patriotism in verses like the following:\n\n\nEven though I am not worthy to be counted\n Sono michi ni \n\namong the mighty warriors\n idete tsukauru \n\nwho go out to serve\n mononofu no \n\non that way\n kasunarazu tomo \n\ngraced with\n o-nakata no \n\nthe departed souls\n kami no mitama wo \n\nof the imperial ancestors\n tamawarite \n\nI shout bravely \nYamato kokoro wo \n\nto enflame\n furi okoshi \n\ntrue Japanese hearts.\n isami takebite \n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n229)\n\n\nLike many of Taseko\u2019s verses, this poem expresses her reverence\nfor soldiers who served the imperial court, even to the point of\ndeath. She evokes the memory of such figures like the samurai general\nKusunoki Masashige (1294\u20131336) who in loyal support of Emperor\nGo-Daigo led his outnumbered army against the forces of Ashikaga\nTakauji at the Battle of Minatogawa in 1336. There Masashige faced\ndefeat and committed ritual suicide. Taseko joined a growing number of\nimperial loyalists in the late-Tokugawa years including fellow Hirata\ndisciples. In other verses, she lamented the sale of silk to foreign\ncountries, complaining that she would rather reject quick profits from\nforeign trade than sell silk to \u201cbarbarians\u201d.\n\nAs a poet who was well travelled and interacted with important daimyo\nleaders and courtiers, Taseko expressed her admiration for men who\ndevoted themselves to the cause of imperial loyalism, while lamenting\nthat she was held back because she was a woman:\n\n\nHow awful \n Masurao no \n\nto have the ardent heart \n kokorobayare to \n\nof a manly man \n taoyame no \n\nand the useless body \n kai naki mi koso \n\nof a weak woman. \n kanashi kari keri\n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n231)\n\n\nThe Hirata academy was not known for recruiting women or actively\nwelcoming them into the school, and their percentage of female\nfollowers was significantly less than in the schools of Kamo no\nMabuchi and Motoori Norinaga. Regardless, Taseko\u2019s actions\ndemonstrate her role in the events of the Restoration, as well as\nhighlight the opportunities which the Hirata academy provided her to\ninteract with notable political figures and to have her voice heard by\nthem and her fellow Kokugaku students.\n",
