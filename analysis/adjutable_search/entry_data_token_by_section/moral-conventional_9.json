    "main_text": "What Does the Moral/Conventional Task Tell Us About Moral Judgments?\n10. What Does the Moral/Conventional Task Tell Us About Moral Judgments?\n\nA question that has been center stage in several preceding sections\nis: What sorts of transgressions do Turiel\u2019s moral criterion\njudgments, and other related experimental procedures (collectively\ndubbed the \u201cmoral/conventional task\u201d), classify as moral?\nSocial domain theorists claim that the task picks out transgressions\nthat involve harm, justice, and rights (and more recently fairness and\nequality). Haidt, Shweder, and others claim that their versions of the\ntask picks out a wide range of transgressions, and that different\nsorts of transgressions are picked out in different cultures. Nichols\nclaims that his version of the task picks out transgressions of\nsocially learned norms that engender high affect. And Royzman and\ncolleagues argue that for experimental participants who are able to\nthink clearly about counterfactual issues, their version of the task\npicks out harmful transgressions, where harm is construed broadly.\n\nWhy is this question important? Turiel and other social domain\ntheorists maintain that the moral/conventional task enables us to\nidentify genuine moral judgments, and Haidt, Shweder, and Royzman\nagree, though each focuses on a somewhat different version of the\n task.[21]\n If that\u2019s right, then determining the sort of transgressions\nthat the task classifies as moral will enable us to characterize the\ncontent of moral judgments. So, for example, if Royzman and colleagues\nare right, then all moral judgments are about behaviors that are taken\nto be harmful, and normative judgments that are not about behaviors\ntaken to be harmful are not moral\n judgments.[22]\n Moreover, if it\u2019s true that the moral/conventional task picks\nout genuine moral judgments, this fact would be of enormous importance\nfor psychologists and neuroscientists who want to study the processes\nunderlying moral judgments and the factors that can influence them,\nsince it gives these researchers a way of identifying the judgments\nthey want to\n study.[23]\n And, as we\u2019ll see in the following section, a test that enables\nus to identify genuine moral judgments can also be a valuable tool for\nphilosophers, since a number of philosophical arguments turn on the\nclaim that various categories of people\u2014including children and\npsychopaths\u2014can, or can\u2019t, make genuine moral\njudgments.\n\nRoyzman, Landy, and Goodwin rightly note that the moral/conventional\ntask is \u201cone of the most widely used measures of mature moral\njudgment\u201d (2014: 178). But why should we believe that any\nversion of the moral/conventional task really does enable us to pick\nout genuine moral judgments? As we noted in\n Section 2,\n there is a great deal of philosophical work aimed at providing a\ndefinition of morality, and while some philosophers offered accounts\nthat are compatible with features of the moral/conventional task, many\nphilosophers disagreed. So there is no philosophical consensus about\nthe definition of morality that would support the claim that\nTuriel\u2019s moral/conventional task, or anything in that vicinity,\ncan be used to identify moral judgments. One way around this impasse,\nas we saw in\n Section 5,\n is the suggestion that \u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be regarded\nas a natural kind term, and the hypothesis that the features used in\nthe moral/conventional task are the essential features of the natural\nkind the term denotes. For that hypothesis to be plausible, it would\nhave to be the case that the features used in the moral/conventional\ntask form a nomological cluster. But a number of authors, including\nKelly and colleagues (2007); Fessler, Barrett, and colleagues (2015);\nKumar (2015); and Stich (2019) have argued that findings like those we\nhave reviewed in\n Section 5\n challenge the claim that the features used in the moral/conventional\ntask form a nomological\n cluster.[24]\n The study by Fessler, Barrett, and others poses a further challenge\nto versions of the moral/conventional task that include questions\nabout seriousness since it found that harmful transgressions were\njudged to be less bad when they occurred long ago or far away.\nMoreover, in cultures around the world there is a wide range of\nbehaviors that are considered serious transgressions that are far\nremoved from the familiar schoolyard transgressions typically invoked\nby social domain theorists\u2014transgressions like apostasy and\nblasphemy, necrophilia and speaking ill of the dead, marrying a\ncousin, failure to circumcise one\u2019s sons, and many more. Most of\nthese have never been used in moral/conventional task studies. Since\npeople\u2019s judgments about transgressions like these have never\nbeen studied, we simply do not know whether they would evoke the\npattern of judgments that social domain theorists find for schoolyard\ntransgressions. If they don\u2019t, that might provide additional\nevidence against the claim that moral/conventional task judgments form\nnomological clusters. On the other hand, Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin\n(2014) alert us to the possibility that poor reasoning may be\nresponsible for some, perhaps all, cases where the components of the\nmoral/conventional task come unglued. So much more work will be needed\nbefore we can draw a confident conclusion about whether Turiel\u2019s\n\u201ccriterion judgments\u201d version of the moral/conventional\ntask, or any other version, actually enables us to determine which of\na person\u2019s normative judgments are moral judgments.\n",
