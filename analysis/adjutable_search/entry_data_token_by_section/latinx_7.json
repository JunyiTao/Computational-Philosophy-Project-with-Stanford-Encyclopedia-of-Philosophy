    "main_text": "Origins || Latina Feminism\n2.3 Latina Feminism\n\nRichard Bernstein once declared the following:\n\n\nLet me be fully explicit. I am not questioning that there is Hispanic\nphilosophy or Latin American philosophy, or even that some Hispanic\nAmericans in the United States are concerned with their history and\ntraditions. I am questioning whether there now exists\nsomething that we can identify as Hispanic American philosophy. (2001:\n50)\n\n\nAt the time, such skepticism was plausibly the standard view among\nthose who entertained the question of whether Latinx or Hispanic\nAmerican philosophy existed. However, there is a compelling case to be\nmade that such a philosophy already existed when Bernstein wrote those\nwords, albeit pursued under another name. That body of work is Latina\nfeminist philosophy. It constitutes perhaps the best proximal\ncandidate for the formation of a distinctively Latinx philosophy.\nUnlike the philosophical gestures of the Chicano movement, the\ndevelopment of Latina feminist philosophy constituted (and continues\nto constitute) a substantial body of disciplinarily recognizable\nwork\u2014albeit one that has had to fight for its recognition. And,\nunlike Latin American philosophical work, which has a more tenuous\nlink to US Latinxs, Latina feminism is centrally focused on US\nLatinxs.\n\nDiscourse about a specifically Latina feminism extends at least as far\nback as the late 1970s. However, the idea of a self-consciously Latina\ntheorizing by philosophers (and philosophically-minded theorists\nworking outside of philosophy departments), began to emerge in the\nlate\n 1980s.[11]\n If there is a founding text of Latina feminist philosophy, it is\nplausibly Gloria Anzald\u00faa\u2019s Frontera/Borderlands\n (1987).[12]\n Anzald\u00faa was not herself trained as an academic philosopher,\nbut her writing inspired generations of more traditionally trained\nacademic philosophers, many of whom continue to reflect on, revisit,\nand draw from the distinctive phenomenology, vocabulary, concerns, and\nmethodology expressed in her\n work.[13]\n Anzald\u00faa\u2019s work pulled together threads of feminist,\nqueer, and Chicana thought, and situated them the US/Mexico border\ncontext. In doing so, she gave expression to a distinctive range of\nexperiences and concerns that had, until that point, been mostly\ninvisible to academic work in Chicano studies, feminism, and academic\nphilosophy.\n\nOther self-consciously Latina feminist writing by academic\nphilosophers followed. Important work in this vein includes essays by\nLugones (1994, 2003) and Schutte (1998, 2000), and monographs by\nAlcoff (2006) and Ortega (2016). Much of this work emphasizes the\nimportance of lived experience, the significance of the social ties\nand the norms governing them, and the unique ways in which gender\ninteracts with Latina-hood. In recent years, this literature has been\nmarked by a reinvigoration of a broadly phenomenological approach to\nidentity, selfhood, oppression, alienation, and marginalization.\n\nThe case for thinking of Latina feminist philosophy as plausibly the\nmost important origin of Latinx philosophy is straightforward: from\nthe 1980s onward, self-identified Latina feminist philosophers were\nexploring a wide range of philosophical issues concerning agency,\nepistemology, and politics, especially as structured by gender. Within\nthat matrix of issues, a central recurring issue in that literature\nwas (and continues to be) the lived consequences of\nlatinidad, or the property of being Latinx. As such, this\nwork has as much a claim to being Latinx philosophy as any\nphilosophical work that has been produced under the label.\n\nTo be sure, given the focus on gender, Latina feminist philosophy has\nnot always been explicitly concerned about the global status of\nLatinxs qua Latinxs (as opposed to, for example, being\nfocused on Latinas qua Latinas). For example, Lugones\u2019\nobservations about the emergence of different selves in the context of\nworld-traveling (1987) as well as her thoughts about the tacit\nmetaphysics presupposed by the discourse of purity (1994) are intended\nto offer particular insight into the condition of Latinas. However,\nthe central insights in these works plausibly generalizes to Latinxs\nin general, and perhaps beyond. Similarly, Schutte\u2019s (1998)\nreflections about the peculiar dilemma of visibility for\nLatinas\u2014they must either erase their Latinidad or be able to\nshow that their facility with multiple cultures is beneficial in the\nAnglo-American public sphere\u2014is not unfamiliar to many Latinxs\nmore generally, and indeed, to a variety of other social identity\ngroups.\n\nAt this stage, it is difficult to do extensive work within Latinx\nphilosophy without engaging with the work of Latina feminist\nphilosophers. In light of these considerations, and the relatively\ndirect connections in motivations and subjects of theorizing, it is\notiose to resist the idea that Latina feminist philosophy is a main,\nif not the main proximal origin to what we now recognize as\nLatinx philosophy.\n",
