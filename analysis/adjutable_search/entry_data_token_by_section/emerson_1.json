    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Education\n2.1 Education\n\nIn \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d delivered as the Phi Beta Kappa\nAddress in 1837, Emerson maintains that the scholar is educated by\nnature, books, and action. Nature is the first in time (since it is\nalways there) and the first in importance of the three. Nature\u2019s\nvariety conceals underlying laws that are at the same time laws of the\nhuman mind: \u201cthe ancient precept, \u2018Know thyself,\u2019\nand the modern precept, \u2018Study nature,\u2019 become at last one\nmaxim\u201d (CW1: 55). Books, the second component of the\nscholar\u2019s education, offer us the influence of the past. Yet\nmuch of what passes for education is mere idolization of books \u2014\ntransferring the \u201csacredness which applies to the act of\ncreation\u2026to the record.\u201d The proper relation to books is\nnot that of the \u201cbookworm\u201d or \u201cbibliomaniac,\u201d\nbut that of the \u201ccreative\u201d reader (CW1: 58) who uses books\nas a stimulus to attain \u201chis own sight of principles.\u201d\nUsed well, books \u201cinspire\u2026the active soul\u201d (CW1:\n56). Great books are mere records of such inspiration, and their value\nderives only, Emerson holds, from their role in inspiring or recording\nsuch states of the soul. The \u201cend\u201d Emerson finds in nature\nis not a vast collection of books, but, as he puts it in \u201cThe\nPoet,\u201d \u201cthe production of new individuals,\u2026or the\npassage of the soul into higher forms\u201d (CW3:14).\n\nThe third component of the scholar\u2019s education is action.\nWithout it, thought \u201ccan never ripen into truth\u201d (CW1:\n59). Action is the process whereby what is not fully formed passes\ninto expressive consciousness. Life is the scholar\u2019s\n\u201cdictionary\u201d (CW1: 60), the source for what she has to\nsay: \u201cOnly so much do I know as I have lived\u201d (CW1:59).\nThe true scholar speaks from experience, not in imitation of others;\nher words, as Emerson puts it, are \u201care loaded with\nlife\u2026\u201d (CW1: 59). The scholar\u2019s education in\noriginal experience and self-expression is appropriate, according to\nEmerson, not only for a small class of people, but for everyone. Its\ngoal is the creation of a democratic nation. Only when we learn to\n\u201cwalk on our own feet\u201d and to \u201cspeak our own\nminds,\u201d he holds, will a nation \u201cfor the first time\nexist\u201d (CW1: 70).\n\nEmerson returned to the topic of education late in his career in\n\u201cEducation,\u201d an address he gave in various versions at\ngraduation exercises in the 1860s. Self-reliance appears in the essay\nin his discussion of respect. The \u201csecret of Education,\u201d\nhe states, \u201clies in respecting the pupil.\u201d It is not for\nthe teacher to choose what the pupil will know and do, but for the\npupil to discover \u201chis own secret.\u201d The teacher must\ntherefore \u201cwait and see the new product of Nature\u201d (E:\n143), guiding and disciplining when appropriate-not with the aim of\nencouraging repetition or imitation, but with that of finding the new\npower that is each child\u2019s gift to the world. The aim of\neducation is to \u201ckeep\u201d the child\u2019s \u201cnature and\narm it with knowledge in the very direction in which it points\u201d\n(E: 144). This aim is sacrificed in mass education, Emerson warns.\nInstead of educating \u201cmasses,\u201d we must educate\n\u201creverently, one by one,\u201d with the attitude that\n\u201cthe whole world is needed for the tuition of each pupil\u201d\n(E: 154).\n",
