Within activity, there is also an\nimportant difference between the acts of certain organisms and the\nactivities of non-living things like fire: when ants build a nest,\nor a cat stalks a bird, they act in a sense in which the fire\ndoes not. Finally, there is a long-standing tradition in philosophy\ngoing back at least as far as Plato and Aristotle that recognizes an\nimportant distinction between the acts that (non-human) animals in\ngeneral are capable of, and the special sorts of actions that human\nbeings do intentionally, such as going to the store, making phone\ncalls, protesting an injustice, or knitting a sweater. This tradition\nviews the latter group as practical manifestations of our rational\ncapacities.\n\nAlthough this entry largely follows suit in focusing on intentional\nhuman action as a manifestation of reason, we flag from the start that\nthere are other philosophical traditions that call this assumption\ninto question. For example, Japanese (as well as Buddhist)\nphilosophers have discussed the possibility of action without the need\nof a self (Kasulis 2019, section 5.3). And on one reading of the\nDaode Jing, the highest forms of human agency are, in some\nsense, beyond reason. This is one way to understand the notion of\nwuwei, or \u201cnonaction,\u201d which describes an ideal way of\nacting that is neither unconscious or involuntary, nor purposeful or\ngoal-oriented (cf. Hansen 2020, section 9.4 and Wong 2021, section\n4.1). Similarly, the Inner Chapters of the Zhuangzi may\npresent a view of human action as going beyond thought and reason. By\nceasing to think about his action, Butcher Ding, appears to achieve\nsuch a sublime level of harmony with his activity as to obviate the\nneed for effort (3.2). On one reading, Zhuangzi is presenting a\nnon-intellectualist account of skill, not unlike that defended by\nDreyfus and Dreyfus (2004) as the highest form of expertise (Ivanhoe\n1993). On a more radical reading, the Inner Chapters do not present a\nhigher form of skill, but rather a more radical notion, Dao\n(way), opposing skill (Schwitzgebel\n 2019).[1]\n\nThe entry is divided in eight sections. Section 1 discusses the\nquestion \u201cWhat is an action?\u201d. Section 2 examines a\nclassic account of intentional action in terms of causation,\nassociated with Donald Davidson\u2019s work. Section 3 considers the\nchallenge that extended actions\u2014actions that take more than an\ninstant to accomplish\u2014pose for such a theory, as explored\nespecially in Michael Bratman\u2019s work, and different reactions to\nthis challenge. Section 4 considers the notion of practical knowledge,\nas presented by Elizabeth Anscombe, which has served as the basis for\nthe most important rival account to causal theories. Section 5\nexplores foundational questions about the ontology of action. Section\n6 considers the question: does action have a constitutive\naim\u2013something it aims at just by being an intentional action?\nSection 7 considers whether omissions are actions, and, if so, how\nvarious accounts might accommodate this. Finally, Section 8 explores\nwhether animals can act intentionally.\n",
