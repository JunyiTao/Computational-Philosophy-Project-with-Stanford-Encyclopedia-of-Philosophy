    "main_text": "Bauer\u2019s Writings, 1829\u201350\n2. Bauer\u2019s Writings, 1829\u201350\n\nBauer was a prolific writer, publishing a dozen substantial books and\nover 60 articles between 1838 and 1848 alone, but no critical edition\nof these works exists. They included analyses of Hegel, the Bible,\nmodern theologies, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution and\nits aftermath. The interpretation of Bauer\u2019s work is problematic\nfor several reasons. Because of anonymous, pseudonymous, and\ncollaborative publication, some attributions are disputed; and\ndivergences exist between Bauer\u2019s published texts and private\ncorrespondence. In the anonymous Trumpet of the Last\nJudgement (1841) and Hegel\u2019s Doctrine of Religion and\nArt (1842), Bauer spoke not in his own voice, but in the ironic\nguise of a conservative critic of Hegel, attributing to Hegel his own\nrevolutionary views.\n\nThree lines of interpretation of Bauer can be distinguished. These\nfocus on his early work; his later writings have attracted little\ncritical attention. The first sees Bauer as a radical subjectivist,\nwhose social and religious criticism was closer to Enlightenment\nrationalism than to Hegel (Sass, 1978; Brudney, 1998). The second,\nlargely influenced by Marx, insists on Bauer\u2019s abandonment of\nthe Hegelian left after 1843 (Rossi, 1974; Pepperle, 1978). The third\nemphasizes the continuity throughout the Vorm\u00e4rz of Bauer\u2019s\nthought and of his republicanism, based on the Hegelian idea of the\nunity of thought and being (Moggach, 2003, 2006, 2011).\n\nBauer\u2019s prize manuscript of 1829, De pulchri\nprincipiis, presented the unity of concept and objectivity as the\ncentral idea of Hegel\u2019s idealism. It examined this unity as\nexpressed in art, comparing Hegel\u2019s aesthetic theory to\nKant\u2019s Third Critique. The manuscript supplemented the\ncriticisms of Kant from Hegel\u2019s Berlin Aesthetics lectures with\nthe logical analysis of categories provided by the 1827\nEncyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. Bauer argued\nthat while the Critique of Judgement attempted to bridge the\ngap between thought and being, and thus opened the way to Hegel, it\nreproduced the antinomies characteristic of the first two critiques.\nKant\u2019s synthesis failed, since he continued to define the\nconcept as merely subjective, and the object as the unknowable\nthing-in-itself, transcending the cognitive power. Self-consciousness,\nor the subject of the transcendental unity of apperception, was\nlikewise impervious to cognition from the Kantian standpoint. In\nHegel\u2019s syllogisms of the idea, objectivity attained rational\nform, while the concept acquired an explicit, material existence.\nBeauty, life, and idea were moments in the process which constituted\nthe actuality of reason. As the immediate unity of thought and\nobjectivity, art illustrated the inexhaustible fecundity of the\nphilosophical Idea. The manuscript underlined the opposition of faith\nand reason in its critique of the religious conceptions of the unity\nof thought and being. Faith was taken to be inimical to free inquiry,\nwhich is the element of reason.\n\nThroughout the 1830s, however, Bauer sought to reconcile thought and\nbeing through the idea of rational faith. In Zeitschrift f\u00fcr\nspekulative Theologie, which he edited between 1836 and 1838, and\nin Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Kritik, he\noffered a speculative account of Christian doctrines as\nexemplifications of logical categories. In the 1838 Religion of\nthe Old Testament, Bauer depicted religious experience as a\nproduct of self-consciousness. He proposed both a transcendental\naccount, stressing the conditions of possibility of religious\nexperiences, and a phenomenological sequence of their forms: a\nlegalistic subordination to an authoritarian deity in the early books\nof the Old Testament expressed a merely external relation between God\nand man, while the messianic consciousness of later books heralded a\nhigher form, the immanence of the universal in the community; but this\nconsciousness could only point up the inadequacy of the law, not yet\npropose the effective overcoming of estrangement. The texts of the\n1830s located the logical structure which, for Bauer, defined the\nreligious consciousness: the immediate identity between particularity,\nwhether of a subject or a community, and the abstract universal, a\nunity achieved without self-transformation. By 1839, Bauer deduced the\npolitical implications of this view: the religious consciousness\nasserted this immediate identity as a monopolistic, sectarian claim,\nexcluding other particulars from equivalent status. The essence of\nreligion for Bauer was now a hubristic particularism, which also\nconferred a transcendent status on the universal, as a realm divorced\nfrom concrete social relationships. This position received its fullest\nexposition in Bauer\u2019s Christianity Revealed (1843). He\nalready sketched this argument in Herr Dr. Hengstenberg, of\n1839, publicly breaking with orthodox and conservative versions of\nChristianity, and stressing the discontinuity between Christianity and\nJudaism. By 1840\u201341, Bauer would present the emancipated\nphilosophical self-consciousness as opposed to all forms of religious\nrepresentation. His political radicalism and republicanism were\ncemented by his recognition of the structural identity between the\nprivate interests fostered by the Restoration order, and the\nmonopolistic religious consciousness.\n\nBauer\u2019s political and theoretical radicalization is evidenced in\nhis biblical studies. The series is comprised of Critique of the\nGospel of John (1840), and the three-volume Critique of the\nSynoptic Gospels (1840\u2013 42). Together with his 1838 study\nof the Old Testament, these volumes criticized the stages of revealed\nreligion, and forms of self-alienated spirit in history. Bauer\u2019s\ncritique of John\u2019s gospel demonstrated the opposition between\nthe free self-consciousness and the religious spirit. His stated\npurpose was to restore the Christian principle to its source in\ncreative self-consciousness; he did not yet openly oppose the\nprinciple itself, but sought to differentiate it, as a rational idea,\nfrom ecclesiastical dogmatism. The positivity of Christianity derived\nfrom the abstract understanding, rather than from speculative reason,\nwhich led religious experience back to its subjective roots. The\nrational core of Christianity was the identity of God and man, but\ntheology had built an untenable doctrinal system on this foundation.\nSpeculation now undermined dogma; it was not confirmed by it, as\nBauer\u2019s mid-1830s articles had maintained. In his\ncorrespondence, though not in this text itself, Bauer indicated that\nthis restoration of the Christian principle was also its overthrow, as\nthe unity of universal and particular could now be grasped in more\ntangible and earthly forms. Christianity was a necessary but now\ntranscended stage in the development of the human spirit, to be\nsupplanted by new expressions of autonomous self-consciousness.\n\nIn his critique of the Synoptics, Bauer\u2019s object was more openly\nto negate dogmatic Christianity, mobilized in defence of the\nabsolutist order. The incidents described in the gospels were products\nof the religious consciousness, rather than factual reports.\nBauer\u2019s critique of John convinced him that the gospel narrative\nwas a purely literary product, and he now argued that the Synoptics\ntoo contained no historically authentic material. Bauer attempted to\nestablish the historical priority of Mark, and the specific\nelaborations undertaken sequentially by Luke and Matthew. He depicted\nmiracles as fallaciously displaying the immediate causality of the\nuniversal in nature, and criticized the naturalistic explanations\nfavoured by theological rationalism. The third volume of the series\ndenied the historicity of Christ. The Christian idea that God and\nmankind share the same essence appeared as the religious\nrepresentation of a single empirical individual who assumed the\nuniversal power of spirit. Like his contemporaries D.F. Strauss and\nLudwig Feuerbach, Bauer understood this synthesis instead as a project\nimmanent in human history. As Bauer\u2019s political writings from\nthis period show, he proposed that the assumption of universality, and\nthe transcendence of particular interest, were historical tasks,\nundertaken by the state and the republican citizenry. In the Synoptics\ntexts, Bauer explicitly equated Christianity and feudalism, and\ndefended the freedom and equality of self-consciousness. Religion and\nthe absolutist state were mutually sustaining, sharing the essential\nfeatures of alienation and repression. Christianity represented the\ncompletion of the religious consciousness in pure abstraction, and the\ndissolution of all genuine ethical bonds. Bauer contended that Judaism\npresupposed the subordination of nature to religious interests, but\nstill maintained the natural links of kinship and ethnicity.\nChristianity eliminated this limited Sittlichkeit in favour\nof the purely abstract self, thus perfecting alienation and requiring\nits definitive resolution.\n\nThe political application of the doctrine of self-consciousness can be\ntraced through two texts on the state, also dating from 1840\u201341.\nIn The Evangelical State Church of Prussia and Science, Bauer\ndescribed the essence of the state as free development. The state was\nthe dialectical agency of historical progress and of the universality\nof the will, manifesting the capacity to abstract from any given\ncontent and express itself in ever new forms. While signalling\nempirical tendencies which might limit the state\u2019s progressive\nfunction (the prominence of religious interests, and hesitancy before\nthe social question, the emergence of new forms of urban poverty and\nexclusion), Bauer contended that the genuine state, as the expression\nof freedom, was in constant transformation. His surface claim was that\nthe Prussian state is such an institution, though his contemporary\ncorrespondence belied this view. He defended the 1817 union of the\nLutheran and Reformed churches in Prussia as the political overcoming\nof religious oppositions, whose basis had been eroded by the\nEnlightenment. Through its (still abstract) grasp of the universal\nconcept of man, against religious particularity, the Enlightenment had\ntransformed religious consciousness into self-consciousness. (This\nprocess formed one of the major themes of Bauer\u2019s\nChristianity Revealed, along with a critique of French\nmaterialism for its inadequate grasp of freedom). The churches were\nnow impotent to perpetuate their own existence without the support of\nthe state. Countering conservative historians like F.J. Stahl, who\nchampioned the independence of the churches, Bauer\u2019s \u201cThe\nChristian State and Our Times,\u201d of 1841, again identified the\nstate as the focus of ethical life. Stahl\u2019s position implied a\nderogation of the spirituality of the state, presenting it as an\nagency of external constraint, to uphold the orthodox ecclesiastical\nand political order against the flow of history, and to defend a\nsocial order governed by irrational privileges and immunities. Bauer\ndenounced not only the Christian state of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, but\nalso the formal Rechtsstaat, or liberal constitutionalism.\nFor Bauer, both these positions defined freedom as private interest,\nreligious or economic; but as particularity, these attitudes had to be\npurged away in the name of a new political order. Bauer maintained\nthat Hegel\u2019s view of freedom as universality was far in advance\nof liberal views, even if the Philosophy of Right was\ninconsistent or incomplete. This was Bauer\u2019s provocative claim\nat the Welcker banquet of 1841, which occasioned his dismissal from\nthe university. The elimination of egoistic atomism by moral\nself-consciousness was the pre-requisite for the republic, or the free\nstate. Bauer contended that the existing social order could not be\ndeemed to be thoroughly rational, nor the state to be the institution\nof freedom that it ought to be, as long as the social question of\nurban destitution remained unresolved. \n\nThe anonymous Trumpet of the Last Judgement, or\nPosaune (November, 1841), and its sequel, Hegel\u2019s\nDoctrine of Religion and Art (1842), interpreted Hegel as\nsounding a call for revolution, to bring this state into being. Bauer\nclaimed that the consequences of Hegel\u2019s system were the\noverthrow of church and state; and that Hegel\u2019s conservative\ncritics were right to see him as the most dangerous adversary of the\nRestoration. Written ironically as pietistic denunciations,\nBauer\u2019s two texts attributed to Hegel a theory of infinite\nself-consciousness, in which the concept of substance and a\ntranscendent absolute were necessary but self-annulling illusions.\nRecapitulating the issue in his own voice in 1845, Bauer identified a\ntension in Hegel\u2019s thought between Spinoza and Fichte, between\ninert, undifferentiated substance and creative form. The\nPosaune, however, argued that the Spinozist moment, though\nnecessary to Hegel\u2019s dialectic, was fully assimilated to\ninfinite self-consciousness. In absolute spirit, properly understood,\nall religious pretensions dissipated, while the absolute itself\ndissolved into the critical activities of conscious individual\nsubjects. Nothing transcendent remained. Yet, the Posaune\nrecognized, Hegel also stressed the concept of substance. Its role had\nto be accounted for. In its apparent transcendence, substance\ndisciplined the immediate, particular self. This was necessary\nbecause, as Hegel argued, particularity cannot be the criterion of\ntheoretical or practical reason; rather, individuals must first\ninternalize substance, as a principle of universality, as a stage in\nreaching infinite self-consciousness. The undifferentiated, pure\nuniversal of substance subsumed all particularity, including the self.\nThis initial, Spinozist moment created an appearance of pantheism in\nHegel, which misled interpreters like D. F. Strauss. In Bauer\u2019s\ndepiction, however, Hegel proceeded to dissolve substantiality as a\npower independent of consciousness. This dialectical resolution was\nnot equivalent to renouncing objectivity, but meant that substance,\nonce it had demonstrated to the particular consciousness the need to\ntranscend itself, might not claim an immediate validity either.\nDisciplining their own immediate interests, individuals could then\nbecome the organs through which the universal attained conscious form.\nThe dialectical illusion of substance was a necessary stage, because\nin it the unity of concept and objectivity could first be glimpsed;\nbut this illusion had to be overcome in further historical and\ntheoretical development. The subject must appear as potentially\nuniversal, and the objective must show itself as a purposive order,\nresponding to the subject\u2019s striving for rational freedom. This\ndevelopment entailed transforming substance into the record of the\nacts of conscious spirit, an inner relation of self-consciousness to\nitself. Subjectivity thus assimilated the principle of universality,\nwhich it now contained as its own character, not as something alien to\nit. But this relation was not confined to an inward experience, since,\nas Hegel maintained, reason must realize itself in the world. The\nexternalization of reason produced a historical sequence, including\nthe forms of alienated life. The stages in this sequence could be\ngrasped as moments in the unfolding unity of thought and being. Bauer\ndescribed self-consciousness, conceived as an immanent and subjective\nuniversality, as the motive force of history, generating historical\ncontent by taking up and transforming the given. As Bauer\u2019s 1829\nmanuscript had also declared, at stake was not only the subjective\nrealisation of the concept, but the fate of the idea, the unity of\nthought and being; and this required that the objectivity of the\nhistorical process be equally emphasized. This historical and critical\nidealism, which the Posaune attributes to Hegel, was politically\nrevolutionary: it affirmed the rights of free self-consciousness\nagainst any positive institution which could not justify its existence\nbefore rational thinking, against state, religion, and social\nhierarchy.\n\nBauer used his central concept of infinite self-consciousness, a term\ntaken from Hegel\u2019s theory of subjective spirit, to reconfigure\nthe Hegelian absolute, bringing art and philosophy into close\nproximity, and excluding religion as a form of alienated reason, while\nrecognising its past historical necessity. Bauer insisted on the\nimmanence of the universal in history, as the record of struggles for\nliberation, and of alienation, which was necessary to discover the\nmeaning of rational autonomy. Bauer\u2019s ethical idealism resembles\na doctrine that Kant calls perfectionism, or Vollkommenheit,\na form of rational heteronomy, one of whose meanings is that action is\nvalidated by its contribution to historical progress. Bauer equated\nperfectionism and autonomy, as an uncompromising commitment to remodel\npolitical and social relations and institutions. Subjects acquired\nautonomy by freeing themselves from particular interests, and by\nrepudiating transcendent universals, religious and political\ninstitutions which claimed to be underivable from self-consciousness,\nand exempt from history. Bauer denounced the ancien\nr\u00e9gime and its Restoration surrogates as a feudal system\nof tutelage and irrational privileges. Arrogating universality to\nitself, the authoritarian state which arose over these exclusive\nparticulars thwarted the self-activity of its people, and concealed\nthe source of its authority behind a veil of religious sanctification.\nBauer maintained that the state, and not religion, was the principal\nadversary. Against this order of alienated spirit, he insisted that\nthe decisive political question was the source of the state\u2019s\nauthority, whether in tradition and religious sanction, or in the\npopular will. This question was to be resolved without compromise.\nBauer asserted that his objective was not merely political, but social\nemancipation. The social question, the polarizations and crises of\ncivil society to which Hegel had been alert, could be resolved not by\ndirect appeals to the particular interests of one class, but by a\ncommon republican struggle against multiform privilege. The result of\nthis combat would be the attainment of justice in all spheres of\nsocial life.\n\nTwo texts, dating from late 1842 and early 1843, The Jewish\nQuestion, and \u201cThe Capacity of Present-Day Jews and\nChristians to Become Free,\u201d elaborate Bauer\u2019s critique of\nthe religious consciousness and of political reformism. The\nconsequence of their publication, however, was that Bauer forfeited\nhis leading position in the opposition movement, as he challenged one\nof its central demands. The question was whether the explicitly\nChristian state of Prussia could eliminate restrictions on Jewish\nparticipation in civil institutions. While liberals and republicans\nadvocated emancipation, conservative opponents defended the\nstate\u2019s exclusive confessional allegiance. Bauer\u2019s\ninterventions attacked the state for defending privilege, and claimed\nthat it used religion as a mask for its interests in maintaining\nrelations of subordination; but he also criticized Jews and their\nsupporters for claiming freedom on the basis of a particular religious\nidentity. Political and social freedom required the renunciation of\nall particularistic ties with the past; thus, as a precondition of\njuridical equality, Jews must renounce their religious allegiance, as\nmust Christians. Christianity demonstrated a historically higher\ndegree of consciousness, since it cancelled the externality of the\ndeity. But this was not a unilateral progress upon Judaism, because\nChristianity, and especially Protestantism, generalized alienation to\nencompass all aspects of life. The superiority of Christianity\nconsisted in its radical negativity, making requisite a transition to\na new and higher form of ethical life. By exacerbating the\ncontradiction between self-determination and self-abasement, the way\nwas cleared for an epochal resolution. These interventions were\ncensured by Marx, and by leading liberal spokesmen. Bauer remained\nadamant that his position was the correct progressive stance.\n\nIn his studies of the French Revolution and its impact on Germany,\nBauer traced the emergence of mass society, based on conformity and\ninchoate particularism. The dissolution of the feudal estates by the\nRevolution produced a purely atomistic society, characterized by the\nassertion of individual property right. The attachment to private\neconomic interest made impossible a concerted opposition to privilege\nand to the existing order, and had caused the ultimate defeat of the\nrevolutions that had spawned it. The Jacobinism of the French\nRevolution, which Bauer in many ways endorsed, had been directed\nagainst this attitude, but had failed to overcome it; and this\nproprietary particularism now threatened the republican movement of\nthe Vorm\u00e4rz. The masses, encompassing both the proletariat and\nthe bourgeoisie, represented inertia and stagnation, and formed the\nbulwark of the existing order. Their opposition to this order was\nmerely apparent. Liberalism unconsciously expressed this development\nof mass society, defining freedom as acquisition. Bauer criticized\nliberal constitutionalism as a vacillating, compromising attitude\ntoward the feudal regime. Even in its most advanced form, that\nendorsed by Hegel, constitutionalism juxtaposed two diametrically\nopposed principles of sovereignty, popular and princely, and was\nunable to resolve the contention between them. Incipient socialism\nshared the same terrain as liberalism, the defence of private\ninterest, but proposed inconsequent and unacceptable solutions to the\nconditions which liberalism simply affirmed. For Bauer, socialism was\nirredeemably heteronomous. The socialist movement, he claimed, sought\nto organize the workers in their immediate, particular existence, and\nnot to transform them. He saw in the proletariat pure particularity,\nand, unlike Marx, denied that this particularity could transform\nitself into a genuine universal unless it first renounced its own\nsectional interests. Bauer also anticipated the negative effects of a\nsocialist organization of labour. While criticizing capitalism for its\nirrational competitive forms, he defended the principle of competition\nitself as a necessary condition for progress, the independence of\npersons, and the possibility of conscious, free self-determination.\nBauer\u2019s pre-1848 work revived the classical republican themes of\nthe opposition of commerce and virtue, but gave them a new shape,\nconsistent with his Hegelianism. In 1842\u201343, Bauer confidently\npredicted the triumph of republican principles and institutions,\nthough this confidence waned as the political crisis deepened. In his\ntwo electoral addresses of 1848\u201349, he defended popular\nsovereignty and the right of revolution, demanding that the new\nconstitution be promulgated as an act of revolutionary will, and not\nreceived as a concession from the king. He also intensified his\ncritique of socialism for promoting heteronomy and dependency rather\nthan personal initiative and self-determination, and for appealing to\nthe existing, discredited absolutist state for the redress of social\ngrievances, rather than opposing this state with unbending resolution.\n\n",
