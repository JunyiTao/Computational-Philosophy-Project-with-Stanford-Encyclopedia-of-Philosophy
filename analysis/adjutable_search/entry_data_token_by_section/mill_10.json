Just as Mill thinks that there is one fundamental\nprinciple of theoretical reason\u2014the principle of enumerative\ninduction\u2014so too he thinks that there is one fundamental\nprinciple of practical reason. \n\n\nThere are not only first principles of Knowledge, but first principles\nof Conduct. There must be some standard by which to determine the\ngoodness or badness, absolute and comparative, of ends or objects of\ndesire. And whatever that standard is, there can be but one. (Mill,\nSystem, VIII: 951)\n\n\nThat principle, of course, is the principle of utility. \n\n\n[T]he general principle to which all rules of practice ought to\nconform, and the test by which they should be tried, is that of\nconduciveness to the happiness of mankind [\u2026] the promotion of\nhappiness is the ultimate principle of Teleology. (System,\nVIII: 951) \n\n\nThe claim that \u201chappiness is the sole end of human action, and\nthe promotion of it the test by which to judge of all human\nconduct\u201d stands at the center of Mill\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, determining how individuals should act, individually and\ncollectively (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\n\nThe principle of utility is examined in detail in\nUtilitarianism, during which it is both clarified and\ndefended. At the center of the work stands Mill\u2019s\n\u2018proof\u2019 of the principle of utility. The argument takes\nplace by way of three subclaims. Mill argues for:\n\n\ndesirability: that happiness is desirable as an end,\n\nexhaustiveness: that nothing but happiness is desirable as an\nend, and\n\nimpartiality: that each person\u2019s happiness is equally\ndesirable.\n\n\nMill takes the first subclaim\u2014desirability\u2014to be\nreasonably uncontentious. Happiness, most will admit, is at least\none of the things which is desirable (Donner 1991: 31). His\nargument for the claim, however, has become infamous.\n\n\nThe only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is\nthat people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible,\nis that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience.\nIn like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to\nproduce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire\nit. (Utilitarianism, X: 234)\n\n\nMill adds to this the observation that \u201ceach person, so far as\nhe believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). As such, happiness is shown to be\ndesirable as an end.\n\nG.E. Moore famously attacks this argument, suggesting that \u201cthe\nfallacy in this step is so obvious, that is quite wonderful how Mill\nfailed to see it\u201d (Moore 1993: 118). \u2018Desired\u2019 does\nnot bear the same relation to \u2018desirable\u2019 as\n\u2018heard\u2019 does to \u2018audible\u2019\u2014for\ndesirability is the property of being deserving or\nworthy of being desired, whereas audibility is property of\nbeing capable of being heard. Mill\u2019s choice of framing\nthe argument in this way is, admittedly, unfortunate, but the basic\nthrust of the argument is nevertheless strong, if understood in terms\nof its own aims.\n\nThe argument for the desirability of happiness is, like the rest of\nMill\u2019s philosophy, naturalistic in orientation. As was observed\nabove\n (section 2.1),\n Mill\u2019s naturalism leads him to the claim that we cannot have\nany knowledge by intuition. His claim that the \u201csole\nevidence\u201d it is possible to produce for normative claims about\ndesirability are empirical observations about what people \u201cdo\nactually desire\u201d must be seen in the context of this basic\ncommitment\u2014our knowledge of the desirable cannot be anchored by\ndirect a priori insight into the nature of the good, and as\nsuch can only come by way of critical examination of what human beings\ndo actually take as good.\n\n\u201c[P]ractised self-consciousness and self-observation, assisted\nby observation of others\u201d reveals that human beings do, as a\nmatter of fact, desire happiness (Utilitarianism, X: 237). We\ndo so, Mill claims, by virtue of our nature\u2014and that propensity\nstrikes us as reasonable upon inspection. That human beings\nuniversally do desire happiness, and take it to be reasonable to do so\nunder free consideration, is evidence that happiness is desirable.\nSuch evidence, of course, is defeasible\u2014but real nonetheless.\nAnd in the absence of reasons to doubt our universal tendency to\ndesire happiness, we are warranted in taking happiness to be\ndesirable. The argument for the desirability of happiness is, in this\nsense, parallel to Mill\u2019s initiating validation of the principle\nof enumerative induction (see\n \u00a73.2).\n\nHuman beings, of course, desire many things besides\nhappiness\u2014Mill acknowledges this fact as \u201cpalpable\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). Insofar as what we desire\nis taken as evidence of what is desirable, this might seem\nincompatible with Mill\u2019s second subclaim\u2014that happiness is\nexhaustive of the desirable. Mill\u2019s strategy for\nestablishing that happiness is the only desirable thing is to\nshow that although there are other things which are desired by human\nbeings, such things are desired only because of the relation they bear\nto happiness. Many things, of course, are desired merely as means to\nhappiness. Upon inspection, such things do not strike us as\nultimately desirable, but merely as useful mechanisms for\nbringing about that which is ultimately desirable. Mill\nrecognises, however, that not all desiderata besides\nhappiness are desired merely as means. Some people, for instance,\n\u201cdesire virtue for its own sake\u201d\u2014as a matter of\n\u201cpsychological fact\u201d, they desire it\n\u201cdisinterestedly, for itself\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n237, 235). This does not threaten the claim that happiness is the only\nthing ultimately desirable, Mill argues, because for such individuals,\nvirtue is desirable because it forms a part of their\nhappiness.\n\n\nVirtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and\noriginally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so\n[\u2026] There was no original desire of it, or motive to it, save\nits conduciveness to pleasure, and especially to protection from pain.\nBut through the association thus formed, it may be felt a good in\nitself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good.\n(Utilitarianism X: 235\u20136)\n\n\nObjects which are desired initially merely as a means to happiness,\ncan become so central to a person\u2019s conception of what it means\nto be happy as to be seen as a part of their happiness. At\nthis point, they may be desired in themselves\u2014and quite apart\nfrom their results. We shall discuss this claim further below\n (section 4.2).\n But as part of Mill\u2019s general strategy for showing that nothing\nbeyond happiness is desirable, the import of the claim is clear. It\nallows Mill to argue that nothing apart from happiness is\nultimately desired. \u201cWhatever is desired otherwise than as a\nmeans [\u2026] to happiness, is desired as itself a part of\nhappiness\u201d, and as such \u201cthere is in reality nothing\ndesired except happiness\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\n\nMill\u2019s argument for impartiality\u2014that that each\nperson\u2019s happiness is equally desirable\u2014passes quickly,\nand many have found it problematic. Mill claims that \u201ceach\nperson\u2019s happiness is a good to that person, and the general\nhappiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). The argument is, in one sense,\nmerely a reflection of Mill\u2019s individualism (cf.\nSystem, VIII: 879). The underlying thought is that the good\nof a group of people can be no other than the sum of the good\nof its members. But the argument goes deeper than this plausible\nclaim, relying on stronger premises. The supposition that \u201cequal\namounts of happiness are equally desirable, whether felt by the same\nor by different persons\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 258n) is\nin fact contentious. One might well argue, for instance, that to add\nto the happiness of the already content or the undeserving is\nnot to add to the general good at the same level as adding to\nthe happiness of the discontent or deserving: that the value of\nhappiness is in part determined by where it occurs. Mill does not,\nhowever, consider these objections.\n\nBy showing that happiness is desirable, that nothing other than\nhappiness is desirable, and that every person\u2019s happiness is\nequally desirable, Mill holds that \u201cthe principle of utility is\nproved\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 239). It is not, of course,\na proof in the traditional sense of being a logical deduction\nof the principle of utility. Indeed, Mill acknowledges that in a\nstrict sense, \u201cultimate ends are not amenable to direct\nproof\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 207; cf. X: 234). Being\nbased on critical examination of how we do reason, claims\nabout how we ought to reason\u2014whether practically or\ntheoretically\u2014must remain provisional, and open to ongoing\ncorrection by further observations of our reasoning practices.\nNevertheless, Mill holds, the \u2018proof\u2019 presents\n\u201c[c]onsiderations [\u2026] capable of determining the\nintellect\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 208). As such, the\nprinciple of utility\u2014\u201cthe doctrine that all things are\ngood or evil, by virtue solely of the pleasure or the pain which they\nproduce\u201d\u2014is shown to have \u201crational grounds\u201d\n(The Protagoras, XI: 61; Utilitarianism, X:\n208).\n",
