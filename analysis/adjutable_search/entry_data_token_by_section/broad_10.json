    "main_text": "Emergentism || The Concept of Emergence\n5.1 The Concept of Emergence\n\nChapter Two of The Mind and its Place in Nature is devoted to\na thorough discussion of the notion of emergence. In this\nchapter Broad is primarily interested in the notion or concept of\nemergence per se. Thus he is there not so much interested in\nthe actual existence of emergent phenomena.\n\nAn emergent property of an aggregate or a whole is, very\nroughly, a property that is something over and above the properties of\nits parts and the way they are arranged in the aggregate. Broad\nprefers to capture this in epistemic terms: an emergent property of a\nwhole is a property that it is impossible to logically infer from even\nthe most complete knowledge of the properties of the parts of the\nwhole. A property that can be so inferred is a\nreducible property. He captures the contrast between emergent\nand reducible properties in the following passage.\n\nPut in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there\nare certain wholes composed (say) of constituents A,\nB, and C in a relation R to each other;\nthat all wholes composed of constituents of the same kind as\nA, B, and C in relations of the same kind\nas R have certain characteristic properties; that A,\nB, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of\ncomplex where the relation is not of the same kind as R; and\nthat the characteristic properties of the whole R(A,\nB, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the\nmost complete knowledge of the properties of A, B,\nand C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the\nform R(A, B, C). The\nmechanistic theory rejects the last clause of this assertion.\n(1925, p. 61)\n\n\n\u2018The mechanistic theory\u2019 is Broad\u2019s label for the\ntheory that today is termed \u2018physicalism.\u2019\n\nSuppose a certain biological feature, e.g. the capacity for nutrition,\nis an emergent property. This means that the property is not a mere\nresult of an immensely high degree of organisational complexity at the\nchemical level. The property is, to be sure, nomically dependent on\nthe chemical level, but it is not a mere resultant of the properties,\nrelations, and laws operative at that level. If nutrition were a mere\nresultant property it would be a reducible property; it would\nbe a property that theoretically can be inferred from\nfeatures at the chemical level (i.e. the properties, relations and\nlaws which characterise the constituents in isolation or in other\nwholes than the one in question).\n\nBroad\u2019s concept of emergence is weakly epistemic; his\nnotion is at heart metaphysical: the epistemic predicament that we are\nin vis-\u00e0-vis an emergent property reflects an important\nmetaphysical fact about the property in question, viz. that it is\nneither identical with nor constituted by the properties and relations\nof the constituents of the whole in question. Thus Broad\u2019s\nnotion of emergence contrasts with a strongly epistemic\nnotion which, very roughly, says that a property is emergent for a\nfinite epistemic subject when provided with fairly extensive\ninformation about the properties and relations of the constituents the\nsubject is still unable logically to infer that property from the\ninformation in question although the property in fact is\nreducible to the features of the constituents.\n\nHempel and Oppenheim (1948) raise several objections to Emergentism.\nBrief attention to two of their objections will help bring out at\nleast a couple of the many facets of Broad\u2019s subtle account.\nFirstly, to assume that emergent phenomena exist is to assume that\nthere are certain phenomena that have \u201ca mysterious quality of\nabsolute unexplainability\u201d. They confidently assert that\n\u201cemergence [\u2026] is not an ontological trait inherent in\nsome phenomena; rather it is indicative of the scope of our knowledge\nat a given time\u201d (p. 119). This objection in effect implies that\nthe metaphysical notion of emergence is dismissed in favour of a\nstrongly epistemic notion.\n\nBroad stresses that it is an empirical question whether a certain\nbiological or chemical phenomenon is emergent or not. It is always\npossible that what strikes us as an emergent property of a biological\nof chemical phenomenon \u201cis due to our imperfect knowledge of\nmicroscopic structure or to our mathematical incompetence\u201d\n(1925, p. 81). He also emphasises the practical importance of seeking\nto devise reductions for as many properties as possible: that ambition\nis \u201cthe natural and proper ambition of the scientists\u201d\n(1933, p. 268).\n\nIt should perhaps also be added that although emergent properties are\nindeed \u201cunexplainable\u201d in the sense that that they are not\nsusceptible to a reductive explanation, this does not mean\nthat they are \u201cunexplainable\u201d in every sense: the\ninherence of an emergent property in a particular whole does admit of\nan explanation by nomic subsumption. We can explain its\ninherence in terms of the nature of the whole and an emergent law. The\nlaw of course remain a brute fact. But surely, so do some laws on\nany account of the world.\n\nHempel and Oppenheim also object that Emergentists are erroneously\ncommitted to regard the mass or weight of a whole as an emergent\nproperty. (Weight is, of course, a reducible characteristic if there\never was one!) The reason they give for this is that not even the\nweight of a whole can be logically inferred from premises that solely\ncontain propositions about the weight of the parts; in addition a law\nis needed which expresses the weight of the whole as some specific\nmathematical function of the weight of the constituent (1948, p. 119).\nHowever, Broad\u2019s account clearly anticipates the objection. He\nprovides the reason why a property such as weight (or mass) should not\nbe conceived as an emergent property. To \u201cexplain the behaviour\nof any whole in terms of its structure and components we\nalways need two independent kinds of information. (a) We need\nto know how the parts would behave separately. And (b) we need to know\nthe law or laws according to which the behaviour of the separate parts\nis compounded when they are acting together in any proportion and\narrangement\u201d (1925, p. 61; Broad\u2019s italics). So to know\nabout the mass of a whole X we need to know the mass of\nX\u2019s parts and the principle according to which\nthe mass of a whole is determined by the mass of the parts. It is\nthrough experience that we have found that the mass of a whole is the\nmathematical sum of the mass of the parts; and it is through\nexperience we have found that the very same principle (or law of\ncomposition) is applicable to any type of whole. To see this,\nconsider the last clause of Broad\u2019s characterisation of emergent\nproperties above. The clause says that an emergent property of a\ncertain whole cannot, even in theory, be logically inferred from the\nmost complete knowledge of the properties of the parts in\nisolation or in other wholes which are not of the form to be\nfound the whole in question. Is this applicable to the mass of a\ncertain whole? Is it applicable to the mass of X? No,\ncertainly not: we are able to logically infer the mass of any\nwhole, including X, from knowledge of the masses of parts in\nisolation or in wholes other than X.\n",
