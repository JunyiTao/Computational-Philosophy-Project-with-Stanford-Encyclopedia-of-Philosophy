    "main_text": "Teachings || Theology\n3. Influence\n\nThe influence of Marsilius has been considerable, particularly through\nhis logical works and commentaries on Aristotle. This may be gathered\nnot only from the large number of manuscripts that have been\npreserved, but also from several other\n considerations.[36]\n Marsilius\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nanalytics was used in Prague in the 1380s. His logical works,\nincluding the Obligationes and the Consequentiae,\nwere used as textbooks in Vienna in the 1390s. His commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and Physics were read\nin Krakow during the first sixty years of the fifteenth century. At\nthe universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt, Basle, and Freiburg, his works\nwere studied throughout the fifteenth century, in particular as part\nof the university curriculum. In 1499, the doctors and masters of the\nVia Moderna at the University of Heidelberg published a\nvolume that included epigrams on Marsilius by well-known humanists\nsuch as Jacob Wimpfeling, as well as a defense of Nominalism in the\nstyle of Marsilius (Via Marsiliana). Praise in the form of\nepigrams can also be found in the 1501 Strasbourg edition of\nMarsilius\u2019s commentary on the Sentences. The\nObligationes, printed in 1489 under the name of Peter of\nAilly, were used by Thomas Bricot, John Major, and Domingo de Soto.\nThe commentary on the Prior Analytics was quoted by Agostino\nNifo. Jodocus Trutvetter and Bartholomew of Usingen, who consolidated\nnominalism in Erfurt, repeatedly mentioned Marsilius in their works.\nBoth Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei referred to\nMarsilius\u2019s commentary on De Generatione et\nCorruptione.\n\nThe theological views of Marsilius appear to have had some circulation\nas well. His commentary on the Sentences was known in Krakow\nin the first half of the fifteenth century, and was used by Thomas de\nStrampino in his Principia (1441\u20131442). The University\nof Salamanca had a theological chair (C\u00e1tedra de Nominales) for\ncommentary on the works of Marsilius of Inghen and Gabriel Biel. His\ncommentary on the Sentences was quoted by Spanish theologians\nsuch as Francisco de Vitoria, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, and\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, usually in connection with questions about\ndivine foreknowledge and grace.\n\nThere are nine extant manuscripts of Marsilius\u2019s commentary on\nthe Sentences. Among the former owners of these manuscripts\nwere two libraries for preachers (Ansbach and Isny), and two libraries\nof faculties of arts (Erfurt and Leipzig). The education in Erfurt and\nLeipzig included the reading of nominalist authors. In all\nprobability, the artists became interested in Marsilius\u2019s\ntheological work after studying his writings on logic and physics. The\npresence of Marsilius\u2019s commentary on the Sentences in\npreachers\u2019 libraries bears witness to the fact that the impact\nof his work was felt beyond university\n circles.[37]\n",
