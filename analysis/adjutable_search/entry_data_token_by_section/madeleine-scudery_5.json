    "main_text": "Philosophy || Epistemology\n3.3 Epistemology\n\nInfluenced by Montaigne, Scud\u00e9ry often expresses skepticism\nconcerning claims to knowledge. Social custom in particular often\ntempts the noetic agent to mistake prejudice for authentic knowledge.\nThe complex psychology by which human beings experience the world\noften tinges their claims to knowledge with subjectivity.\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s skepticism, however, is a mitigated one.\nEspecially in the religious domain, the noetic agent can acquire\ncertain knowledge and overcome the limits to knowledge tied to the\nfallible senses and social bias.\n\nMany claims to knowledge are so doubtful that one can easily endorse\nskepticism as the proper position concerning knowledge itself. The\nexperience of error and subsequent correction reveals how thin are the\nfoundations of all noetic claims. \n\n\nI think sometimes that everything is so doubtful that one can only\nsupport one position concerning knowledge. If I had to establish one\nsect in this area, I would like to start one where it would be\npermitted to doubt everything. The one exception would be the things\nof religion. [CN, 1: 167] \n\n\nThe exception to the rule of skepticism concerns religious truths. In\nnumerous writings Scud\u00e9ry argues that certain religious\nknowledge involves both philosophical demonstrations of God\u2019s\nexistence and the theological and moral truths unveiled by God in\nsacred revelation.\n\nOf Incertitude explores the psychological sources of this\nwidespread doubt and error. Subjective emotions and social custom\nconstitute major obstacles to the disinterested use of reason in the\nquest for objective knowledge. \n\n\nAs soon as one wants to use one\u2019s reason and tries to examine\ncarefully things in themselves, one realizes that one believes only\nwith great doubt most of those things one thought one knew with the\ngreatest certitude. In the conduct of life, one is carried away by\nsome blind inclination or by some custom one lazily follows without\nknowing why. [MM, 1: 373] \n\n\nLike Montaigne and Descartes, Scud\u00e9ry emphasizes how social\ncustom can easily induce the noetic agent into error. But she also\nstresses how the more interior and elusive powers of temperament and\nemotion can color noetic judgment and block the agent from objective\nperception of the external world.\n\nAnother limit to noetic certitude arises from the experiential nature\nof human knowledge. One can only know an object well through personal\nexperience of it. But personal experience entails an irreducible\nsubjectivity of perception. \n\n\nExperience is good for everything. Without it we would have only the\nmost imperfect knowledge of anything. In my opinion, the only thing we\ncannot actually experience is death, because we can only die once.\nConsequently, we cannot know it very well. [EM, 1: 248] \n\n\nIronically, the very experience requisite for thorough knowledge of an\nobject places the knowledge under a veil of doubt since experience\ninevitably carries the imprint of the noetic agent\u2019s subjective\nhistory, emotions, and desires.\n\nOne particular problem in epistemology concerns self-knowledge. In\nOf the Knowledge of Others and of Oneself, Scud\u00e9ry\nargues that self-knowledge can be attained only if one meets certain\nmoral conditions for self-scrutiny. The virtues of justice, sincerity,\nand courage constitute the prerequisites for authentic self-knowledge.\n\n\n\nOne must begin by the desire to know oneself free of all flattery.\nPrincipally, one must observe oneself concerning four things: if one\nis just; if one is sincere; if one is capable of true friendship; if\none has courage [CDS, 1: 103] \n\n\nUnlike Descartes, who proposes an intellectualist path to attain\nknowledge of the internal cogito, Scud\u00e9ry insists on\nthe moral requirements for authentic disclosure of the self. It is the\nfrank desire for an unvarnished and valid knowledge of oneself, a\nknowledge that may reveal the need for moral conversion, which permits\nthe noetic agent to arrive at authentic knowledge of one\u2019s soul.\nOpposed to the Cartesian path of introspection, Scud\u00e9ry insists\nthat self-knowledge can emerge only through scrutiny of one\u2019s\nsocial interaction under the rubric of virtue and vice. \n",
