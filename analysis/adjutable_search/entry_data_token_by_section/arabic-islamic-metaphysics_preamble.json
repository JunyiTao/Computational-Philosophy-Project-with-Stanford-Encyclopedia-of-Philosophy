    "main_text": "\n\nAmong the philosophical disciplines transmitted to the Arabic and\nIslamic world from the Greeks, metaphysics was of paramount\nimportance, as its pivotal role in the overall history of the\ntransmission of Greek thought into Arabic makes evident. The\nbeginnings of Arabic philosophy coincide with the production of the\nfirst extensive translation of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\nwithin the circle of translators associated with the founder of Arabic\nphilosophy, al-Kind\u012b. The so-called \u201cearly\u201d or\n\u201cclassical\u201d phase of falsafa ends with the\nlargest commentary on the Metaphysics available in Western\nphilosophy, by Ibn Rushd (Averroes). The following\n\u201cgolden\u201d age of Arabic thought continues to be primarily\nconcerned with metaphysics, turning from the effort of interpreting\nthe intricacies of Aristotle\u2019s canonical text towards the\nprocess of assimilating the model of metaphysical science first\noutlined by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and then implemented by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna).\n\nIn the incipit of the Metaphysics according to the\nArabic way of ordering the books of this work (book Alpha Elatton,\nchapter 1), Arabic philosophers could even find the justification of\ntheir Greek pedigree and their raison d\u2019\u00eatre in a\npredominantly religious society: philosophy is said there to be\nconstitutively a \u201csearch\u201d and to be directed towards a\ngoal\u2014truth\u2014that surpasses human individual capacities both\nobjectively, for its extremely wide scope, and subjectively, for the\nweakness of man\u2019s cognitive faculties, thus obliging its\nfollowers to join their efforts with all previous and present\ninvestigators of truth. This explains the large fortune of this\nproemium, and of the similitude accompanying it (the human intellect,\nwith respect to the most knowable things, is like bats\u2019 eyes\nwith respect to daylight), not only in philosophy, but also in\ntheology and literature, to such an extent that its different versions\ncan be taken as specimens of the various understandings of the nature\nand possibilities of falsafa, and of the degree of its\ndependence on Greek thought, in the history of Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy.\n\nThis impression of centrality is confirmed by the large number and\ngreat variety of works pertaining to metaphysics written in\nArabic\u2014translations of the basic Greek texts, different kinds of\ncommentaries on the translated material, original works with various\ndegrees of comprehensiveness and doctrinal depth, etc.\u2014all of\nwhich provide clear evidence of the intellectual vivacity and the\nproductive energy of this philosophical area. Such an intensive\nreflection on metaphysics leads to what represents the specific Arabic\ncontribution to the history of this discipline, namely the progressive\ndevising of a new standard of metaphysics, in which this discipline\nassumes the form of a comprehensive and articulated synthesis of the\nGreek heritage, undergoes a process of epistemological\nrefinement\u2014in terms of definition of scope, coherence of\nstructure, rigorousness of arguments, etc.\u2014and ascends to the\nrole of cornerstone of philosophy. This process brings forth a real\n\u201csecond beginning\u201d of metaphysics in the history of\nphilosophy, whose model eventually prevailed in philosophical circles,\ndespite occasional criticisms motivated by an anachronistic desire to\ndefend the Greek legacy in its uncontaminated form. Non-philosophical\nforms of knowledge\u2014above all revealed theology\u2014also had to\nconfront the challenge posed by metaphysics. The vigorous and\nlong-lasting impact of this metaphysical paradigm in non-Arabic and\nnon-Muslim cultural areas, like the Latin-Christian and the\nHebrew-Jewish, attests to its great doctrinal and epistemological\nattractiveness.\n",
