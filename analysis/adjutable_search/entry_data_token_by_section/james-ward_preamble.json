    "main_text": "\n\n\nBritish idealism was the dominant philosophical movement in the\nclosing decades of the nineteenth century. Its best-known\nrepresentatives\u2014philosophers of the like of Thomas Hill Green and\nFrancis Herbert Bradley\u2014held a version of Absolute idealism, the\ntheory that reality is a single unified consciousness or cosmic\nexperience. The doctrine has its roots in the philosophies of Spinoza,\nKant and Hegel, but the British idealists elaborated it in independent,\noriginal ways. In this, they were motivated by a desire to oppose\nmaterialism and vindicate our instinctive belief that human life has a\nmeaning. As Bradley forcefully put it in his Logic,\n\u201cthat the glory of this world in the end is appearance leaves the\nworld more glorious, if we feel it is a show of some fuller splendor;\nbut the sensuous curtain is a deception and a cheat, if it hides some\ncolourless movement of atoms [\u2026]\u201d (Bradley 1883: 590).\n\n\nIt is easy to see, however, how Absolute idealism threatens those very\nideals it is supposed to defend, since it denies that finite existence\nis truly real and downgrades it to \u2018a show of some fuller\nsplendor.\u2019 If reality is a single unified totality, what is the\nindividual self? If the past, the present and the future are not real\nfor the Absolute, wherein lays our freedom? If reality is eternally\nperfect, what is the point of our moral struggles? The philosophy of\nthe Cambridge Professor James Ward (1843\u20131925)\u2014now a\nlargely forgotten figure but once a very respected thinker\u2014is an\nattempt at overcoming these difficulties by combining the idealistic\nstandpoint with a pluralistic metaphysics.\n",
