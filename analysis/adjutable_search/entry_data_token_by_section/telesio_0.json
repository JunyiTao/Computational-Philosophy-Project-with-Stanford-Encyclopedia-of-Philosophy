    "main_text": "Life, Works and Influence\n1. Life, Works and Influence\n\nBernardino Telesio was born at Cosenza in Calabria in 1509 as the son\nof a noble and quite wealthy family. Having been educated by his uncle\nAntonio Telesio, a humanist of note, he studied in Milan, Rome and the\nfamous university of Padua, which he left in 1535. There is no\nevidence that Telesio gained a doctorate. Instead of undertaking a\nuniversity career, he spent several years in a Benedictine monastery\n(1535\u201344) without taking oaths. Later he lived in the Neapolitan\nhome of Alfonso III Carafa, Duke of Nocera. In 1553 he married and\nsettled in Cosenza, becoming the dominant figure of the Accademia\nCosentina, which came to focus on natural philosophy under his\ntutelage. Telesio never held a salaried position. After the death of\nhis wife in 1561, which marked the beginning of his financial\ndifficulties, he seems to have spent some time in Rome under the\npatronage of Pope Pius IV. He rejected the Archbishopric of Cosenza\noffered by Pius IV in 1565, leaving this position to his brother. From\n1576 on he was moving between Cosenza and Naples; in Naples he lived\nwith the son and heir of Alfonso Carafa, Ferrante, to whom he\ndedicated the final version of his De rerum natura. He died\nin his hometown in 1588.\n\nTelesio dedicated his whole life to establishing a new kind of natural\nphilosophy, which can be described as an early defense of naturalism\nand empiricism bound together with a rigorous criticism of\nAristotelian natural philosophy and Galenic physiology. Telesio blamed\nboth Aristotle and Galen for relying on elaborate reasoning rather\nthan sense perception and empirical research. His fervent attacks\nagainst the greatest authorities of the Western philosophical and\nmedical traditions led Francis Bacon to speak of him as \u201cthe\nfirst of the moderns\u201d (Opera omnia vol. III, 1963, p.\n114). He was perhaps the most strident critic of metaphysics in late\nRenaissance times. It was obviously due to his excellent relationships\nwith popes and clerics that he was not persecuted and was able during\nhis own lifetime to publish his rather heterodox writings, which went\non the index shortly after his death. His principal work is the\naforementioned De rerum natura iuxta propria principia\n(\u201cOn the Nature of Things according to their Own\nPrinciples\u201d), which in the last augmented edition of the\nauthor\u2019s hand appeared in Naples in 1586. The De rerum natura\nis a huge treatise in nine books which deals with cosmology, biology,\nsense perception, reason and ethics. Another treatise of major\nimportance is Quod animal universum ab unica animae substantia\ngubernatur. Contra Galenum, in which Telesio critizised central\nconceptions of Galenic physiology and psychology. This work was never\nprinted, but circulated in manuscript copies (De Franco, 1981, p.\nXXII). Smaller treatises deal with a variety of themes such as\ncolours, dreams, geology and meteorology, some of which were published\nin Rome in 1565 (De iis quae in aere fiunt et de\nterremotibus; De colorum generatione; De mari).\nTelesio\u2019s philosophy was disseminated by friends and students such as\nTommaso Campanella,  whose writings contain long paraphrases of\nTelesian ideas; by Sertorio Quattromani, Telesio\u2019s successor as head\nof the Accademia Cosentina, who published a synthesis of his\npredecessor\u2019s philosophy in 1589; and by Antonio Persio, who gave\nlessons on Telesio\u2019s thought in Venice and published a collection of\nsmaller works, the Varii de naturalibus rebus libelli, in\n1590. Giordano Bruno speaks of the \u201cgiudiciosissimo\nTelesio\u201d in the third dialog of De la causa, whilst\nFrancis Bacon based his own speculative philosophy of nature on a\nblend of Telesian and Paracelsian conceptions (Giachetti Assenza 1980;\nRees 1977; 1984). Thomas Hobbes followed Telesio in the rejection of\nspecies (Schuhmann 1990; Leijenhorst 1998, p. 116ff.) The physiology\nof Ren\u00e9 Descartes in De homine shows close\nsimilarities to Telesio\u2019s physiological theories as they are presented\nin De natura rerum (Hatfield 1992). Telesio also had some\ninfluence on Gassendi and on libertine thinkers (Bianchi 1992).\n",
