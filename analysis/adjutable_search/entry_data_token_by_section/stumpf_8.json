    "main_text": "Further Contributions || Ethics\n9.1 Ethics\n\nIn his second address as rector of the University of Berlin in 1908,\nStumpf (1910c) expressed his opposition to formalism and moral\nskepticism and argued for an ethics based on an objective theory of\nvalues. It will be recalled that values are specific contents of acts\nbelonging to the class of emotional functions or feelings and that\nthey resemble the contents of judgment that belong to the class of\nintellectual functions. Ethics, like aesthetics, is grounded entirely\non the class of feelings. Echoing Lotze\u2019s distinction between\npassive and active feelings, Stumpf argues that emotions are passive\nfeelings as opposed to active feelings which are directed towards a\nduty, a project, or an intention to be achieved through voluntary\nactions. Values or value-feelings, which are essential for an ethics\nworthy of this name, refer to the specific contents of will or\nvoluntary actions. Moral actions, as opposed to instinctive or\nmechanical behavior, presuppose knowledge since this class of acts is\ngrounded on judgments that in turn are at the foundation of\ntheoretical knowledge. Just as true judgment, moral behavior differs\nfrom blind actions by the insight or self-evidence that is to the\ncontent of a feeling (value) what theoretical self-evidence is to a\nstate of affairs. And just as the truth in logic, goodness or what is\nworthy of being wanted or desired is based on intrinsic and objective\nvalues that are immune to any external forces.\n",
