In addition, his penchant for\nhierarchy and systemization led modern commentators in the twentieth\ncentury to draw comparisons with Plato, Aristotle, and even Thomas\nAquinas. Around the mid-twentieth century, Joseph Needham vividly\npresented Zhu\u2019s system in terms of process philosophy as bearing\norganismic patterns of conceptualization and distinct parallels with\nscientific thinking:\n\n\nI am prepared to suggest, in view of the fact that the term\nLi always contained the notion of pattern, and that Chu Hsi\nhimself consciously applied it so as to include the most living and\nvital patterns known to man, that something of the idea of\n\u2018organism\u2019 was what was really at the back of the minds of\nthe Neo-Confucians, and that Chu Hsi was therefore further advanced in\ninsight into the nature of the universe than any of his interpreters\nand translators, whether Chinese or European, have yet given him\ncredit for. (Needham 1956a: 474)\n\n\nSoon thereafter, after undertaking a careful study of Zhu\u2019s\ndialogues (Zhuzi yulei), Hu Shih presented Zhu\u2019s method\nof inquiry, gewu zhizhi (investigate things to attain\nknowledge) as essentially a process of \u201chypothesis and\nverification by evidence\u201d (Chan 1989: 566), consistent in spirit\nwith a scientific approach to inquiry. Needham and Hu effectively cast\nZhu\u2019s thought and method in a new light, as more creative,\nscientific, holistic, and practical than previously thought. Since then, many\nhave discussed Zhu as a process thinker, but little has been written\nto consider the extent to which his system could accommodate a\nscientific worldview, and the extent to which his method of inquiry\nwas consistent with a scientific approach. Yung Sik Kim offers an in-depth inquiry into the\nextent to which Zhu Xi anticipated genuine scientific methods of\nobservation and conceptualization in The Natural Philosophy of Chu\nHsi (2000).\n\nZhu from childhood displayed a genuine interest in natural phenomena\nand in raising speculative questions. Later he tended to rein in this\ninterest, for example by relating features of observed natural\nphenomena to human analogues for didactic purposes and by refraining\nfrom pressing his speculations very far, i.e., beyond the scope of\nverifiable knowledge and applicability. Zhu lived during a tumultuous\nperiod in Chinese history when Neo-Confucian scholars tended to draw\nupon the resources of their own tradition to revitalize the empire, an\neffort in which Zhu\u2019s ouvre constituted a watershed. He\nsought to wed the objective and subjective trends of the earlier\nmovement into a practical synthesis in which objective inquiry played\na key role in subjective cultivation. Subsequently, however, as his\ndisciples refined his thought into a scholastic doctrine, subjective\ncultivation began to prevail over objective inquiry, which was increasingly\nredirected into the narrow limits of reading and interpersonal\nconduct.\n\nA Neo-Confucian master of the Ming dynasty, Wang Shouren (Yangming;\n1472\u20131529), spurned Zhu\u2019s method of inquiry altogether\nafter he made a futile attempt to observe the li (patterning) in the\nbamboo outside his gate. Holding that facts are obvious to a\nperceptive observer and do not require endless further investigation, Wang\nwent on to formulate an idealist pragmatism that became influential.\nIntending to counter the scholasticism and careerism of his day, Wang,\na military man, stressed volitionism and activism and spurned the sort\nof careful objective inquiry Zhu thought necessary to making balanced\njudgments and appropriate responses.\n\nZhu conceptualized nature and natural phenomena in terms of\nli (pattern, patterning) and gewu (the investigation\nof things), qi (primal vapor), yin-yang,\nwuxing (five phases), shu (number, probability,\nratio), xiang (images); figures from the Book of\nChanges), ghosts and spirits (gui-shen), heaven and the\nsage (tian-shengren), stimulus-response (ganying),\nand transformation and change (bianhua). In this context, it\nwas important to treat li matter-of-factly as the intrinsic\npatterning of things and events. While the li involved with\nthe identities of things are those facets of intrinsic patterning that\npertain to their basic interactive propensities and functions, the\nli of a concrete thing form \u201ca gestalt totality\u201d\n(Kim 2000), nearly as complex as the thing itself. Thus, whereas\nscholars tend to take Zhu\u2019s assertion that \u201cfor a certain\n(kind of) thing to exist, there first must be that li\u201d\nor \u201cthere must be this li for there to be that (kind\nof) thing\u201d as indicative of a metaphysical principle of\nsufficient reason, in this context li simply affirm that\nthings of identifiable kinds bear identifying patterns (xing)\nthat make them what they are and interact as they do. Li\nindicate reference points for identities of things that influence\ntheir typical patterns of interaction with other things. Li\nthus conceived do not amount to principles of explanation and are more\ninvolved with definition, so references to the li of\nphenomena do not add anything cognitive or\n scientific.[16]\n At times, Zhu did present the idea of investigating things in chapter\n5 of the Great Learning (Daxue) as involving a\nstep-by-step approach, with an eye to discerning ever higher levels of\ncommonality among the myriad li (patterns), aiming at an\nultimate comprehension of the most basic form of pattern,\ntaiji (supreme polarity). Although this approach lacks the\nrigor of a logical categorical system, when viewed together with\nZhu\u2019s comments on Zhou Dunyi\u2019s Diagram of the Supreme\nPolarity (Taiji tu), it is suggestive for viewing\nphenomena and forms in a developmental, almost evolutionary context.\nAs Needham comments:\n\n\nChu Hsi [Zhu Xi] wrote:\n\n\nIf one peers into the mystery, the thai chi [taiji,\nsupreme polarity] seems a chaotic and disorderly wilderness lacking\nall signs of an arranger\u2026, yet the Li (fundamental\npattern) of motion and rest, and of Yin and Yang, is fully contained\nwithin it.\n\n\nInnumerable smaller organisms were also contained within it, and\nindeed composed it. Some of them more highly organized than others. In\nfact, the world was no more undifferentiated for the Neo-Confucians\nthan for modern organic philosophy; it manifested a series of\nintegrative levels of organization, wholes at one level being parts on\nthe next. A clear statement of this conception appears in the ninth\nparagraph of the Thai chi Thu Shuo [Explanation of the\ndiagram of the supreme polarity], which indicated the inapplicability\nof categories outside the level to which they belong. (Needham 1956a:\n466)\n\n\nFor Zhu, investigating things to attain knowledge involves arriving at\na grasp of their constituent li; \u201cknowing\u201d or\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d such phenomena, thus, is a matter of\ngrasping their li. While Zhu often speaks of knowing or\ncomprehending something in terms of the metaphor of seeing it clearly,\nof having a clear discernment of it, which is nothing like rigid\npropositional knowledge, he does recognize several forms or levels of\nknowing, and regards the basic steps of learning in analytical\npropositional terms and the higher levels in more synthetic insight\nterms. That is, one first learns facts about the building blocks of\nthe world and human life, e.g., what things are, what they mean, how\nthey fit together; then, gradually, one gains insights into the\nbroader patterns of relationship and intercourse that comprise the\nworld and human life and that eventually afford sensitive glimpses of\nthe inner root as well as the larger picture. Zhu\u2019s discourses\nare as full of detailed accounts of phenomena as they are of synthetic\ninsights, which should be expected given that Zhu gives equal status\nand value to the various sorts of qualities that the Western tradition\ndivides into primary (quantitative), secondary (qualitative), and\ntertiary (qualitative effects).\n\nAs noted, Zhu drew on notions of qi, yin-yang, the five\nphases, shu (numbers, probablilities), and images as\nconceptual and categorical resources for classifying, characterizing,\nand understanding the world, especially cycles, processes, and\nparticular things and events. Chinese thinkers, especially during the\nHan dynasty, used such notions to arrange categories of reality and\ncompile lists of qualities for each category. While some of the\nassociated qualities are directly or causally linked, many of them are\narbitrary\u2014perhaps assigned in light of long forgotten events or\ndecrees. These sets of categories were compiled as systematic indices\nfor grasping things and events in terms of categorical associations\nand imputations. Inevitably, these sets of categories bore a strongly\ncultural stamp and bias but were applied equally to natural phenomena,\nas if the natural world were an extension of the human world, not\nvice versa.\n\nZhu often classified a natural phenomenon in terms of these categories\nand associations, and left it at that, unconcerned that the categories\nwere haphazard and the associations arbitrary and inexplicable. Likely\nZhu recognized that these categories and associations often were\narbitrary and not particularly informative regarding physical reality\nbut did not find it necessary or practical to pursue the matter. He presumably\ncontented himself with assigning phenomena to these culturally colored\nsets of categories and associations because in those speech contexts\nthose associations were more significant and interesting than the\nprobing of purely physical categories and explanations would have\nbeen. These sorts of examples reflect the cultural common sense and\nconditions of common speech of his age.\n\nThe question arises whether these sets of categories and associations\nwere more a help or a hindrance to the development of science in\ntraditional China. On the one hand, their loose criteria and arbitrary\ndesign allowed for easy classifications and \u201caccounts\u201d of\nphenomena that would have stymied serious scientific investigation\nwhile, on the other, the associations thus attributed to these\nphenomena sometimes might have yielded expectations or hypotheses of\nsorts, thus stimulating further inquiry. Interestingly, Zhu often\nsidestepped these sets of categories altogether in his serious\nthinking about natural phenomena and judged them by what he took to be\nthe deciding factors in the cases themselves, often in light of\nanalogies. Striking cases of this are Zhu\u2019s discussions on the\nstructure of the cosmos (heaven and earth) and insightful explanations\nof phases of the moon and eclipses of the sun and moon. For example,\nZhu often said that the earth was floating on water; both below the\nearth and surrounding its four sides were water, but he also said that\nqi surrounded the earth. And, he also spoke of vortices,\ncentrifugal forces, and occasionally of the earth\u2019s motion. Zhu\nwas interested in these accounts of the formation of the world, but\nsaw no way to confirm any of them. He perhaps thought it was important\nto present such accounts as representative of an objective approach to\na question that was more amenable to mystical or religious\napproaches.\n\nZhu\u2019s notions of stimulus-response and transformation and change\nare noteworthy, for they are counterparts to the concepts of causation\nand change in Western science. Construing phenomena as resonant and sensitive,\nperhaps perceptive in a rudimentary sense, the notion of\nstimulus-response reinforces the interdependence of things. Assuming a\nresonance among things in terms of parallelisms among their forms, and\naffinities among their qi, this notion presents phenomena on\na biological model and conduces to an ecological rather than a\nmechanical outlook. While providing an interactive way of talking\nabout phenomena, it doesn\u2019t open the way or impel the inquirer\nto uncover the nuts and bolts of causation and change. Also, since the\nidea of stimulus-response was usually tied to the aforementioned sets\nof categories and associations, it was often vague and applied in\narbitrary and superstitious ways. As might be expected, Zhu\u2019s\nnotions of transformation and change also reflected biological and\nhuman-life models, with transformation indicating gradual change, as\nin the growth of a child or the passage of summer, and change\nindicating a sudden transformation, as from a caterpillar to a\nbutterfly or from summer to winter and life to death. From the\nstandpoint of developing science, by making change seem to be\nnatural and inevitable, these notions of transformation and change\ntended to make further inquiry appear to be unwarranted. In contrast,\nWestern ideas of eternal substance and inert matter, for example, made the observed\nchanges on the earth and in the skies problematic and in urgent need\nof further inquiry and explanation. More pragmatic in spirit, the\nChinese were concerned mainly with registering and grasping the\nobserved patterns and sequences of change in and around them so as to\nbe able to adapt their lives to the ever-changing circumstances.\n(The Book of Changes was a guide to making such adaptations.)\n\nZhu Xi posits an ontological and causal continuity between the\ncelestial and terrestrial realms, as well as between the animal and\nplant species and humanity. Indeed, there is no categorical difference\nbetween human beings and other life forms. Against this backdrop, Zhu\ncarefully observed anomalies and sketched explanations based on the\ngeneral ideas available to him. For example, when observing fossils of\nseashells atop a mountain, Zhu noted that the area had once been a\nseabed and hypothesized that the earth formerly was softer and more\nfluid and that, through wave motions, this seabed later rose to become\na mountain top. Meanwhile, the entire earth dried as it grew older.\nWhile this explanation was not rigorous or determinate enough to count\nas a scientific hypothesis; Zhu appealed only to naturalistic concepts\nand principles in his comments. Zhu also made quantitative measurements of\nplant growth. Zhu once heard about a monk\u2019s claim that oould see\nevidence of the nourishing powers of \u201cnight vapor\u201d by\nobserving bamboo sprouts, which grow twice as fast at night as during\nthe day. Later, during a stay at a Buddhist residence on Jade\nMountain, Zhu observed that the bamboo sprouts there displayed the\n\u201csame rate of growth day and night, exactly the opposite of the\nmonk\u2019s claim\u201d. Qian Mu observes that Zhu\u2019s practice\nof gewu (investigating things) was fruitful because he made\nobservations with questions or hypotheses in mind, adding that Wang\nShouren\u2019s observations of bamboo had been fruitless and in vain because he\nhad no question or hypothesis in mind to test. Wang was just undertaking\nbland looking (Qian 1986: 215f, 219).\n\nIn contrast to analytical Western concepts used in studying the\nnatural world, including matter, material quality, motion, and change,\nZhu Xi adopted a holistic approach to understanding the physical world\nand phenomena. He drew upon received notions of li (pattern)\nand qi (cosmic vapor) to describe and account for the\nmaterial, dynamic, and formal features of perceived phenomena.\nLi (pattern) refer to the inner patterns of both interaction\nand identifying form. As noted, li are not general\noverarching principles, but inner patternings implicated in things and\nevents, from the discernible textures\u2014grains in wood, veins in\nleaves\u2014to the postulated identifying forms, xing, of\nthings. In terms of dynamic interaction, li structure the\nprimal yin-yang intercourse as taiji, and the\nintercourse among the five phases as their constitutive identifying\nforms. Zhu thus conceived of the cosmos as emerging from incipient\nyin-yang interaction in the initially formless primal\nqi (yuanqi). Yin-yang interaction and\nfurther permutations give rise to the five phases, which bear the full\nrange of material and perceptual qualities and whose interaction gives\nrise to heaven, earth, and the myriad things, i.e., the cosmos.\n\nThe Chinese system of five phases differs from traditional Western\natomism on several counts. As qi (yin-yang) operates\nin essentially a wave-like manner, the world is manifested as a field\nof interacting qi forces. Change is a function of the\nattunement of forms and resonance of qi, and transformation\nis viewed according to chemical and biological models. That is, not\nonly are the five phases derived from yin-yang interaction;\nthey are divisible and inter-convertible. Moreover, while Western\natoms bear only primary qualities in themselves, each of the five\nphases exhibits a range of perceptual qualities and effects, and the\ntradition attributes a plethora of qualities and associations to\nyin and yang. These flexible and adaptable concepts\ndo not create the sorts of problems, the kinds of conflicts with\nobservation, that prompt rethinking and further, more precise\ninvestigations of phenomena. Because perceptual properties of all sorts\nare propagated from the formation of the five phases, Zhu Xi and\nothers in his tradition did not draw the critical distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities that formed a crucial linchpin in\nphysical analysis in the West from antiquity. To be sure, Zhu spoke of\na threshold between perceptible and imperceptible phenomena in terms\nof the expressions \u201cabove forms\u201d (xing er shang)\nand \u201cwithin forms\u201d (xing er xia). \u201cAbove\nforms\u201d refers not to general principles or primary qualities but\nessentially to the immanental moral underpinnings of nature and\nhumanity, i.e., the inner roots of order and harmony, ecologically\nconceived, primary examples of which are dao and li.\nCharacterizing these fundamental notions as \u201cabove forms\u201d,\nZhu insisted that people needed to comprehend them in light of their\nmanifestations in perceived phenomena \u201cwithin forms\u201d.\nLacking the critical distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities, Zhu treated perceptual qualities, such as color and taste,\nas equally basic, innate, and real in material substances as any\nother, and as such he did not look to underlying principles, causes,\nor mechanisms in terms of which to explain these manifest\nqualities.\n\nZhu Xi didn\u2019t feel the need to formulate a theory of motion as\nsuch either, because the factors were glossed in his commonsense grasp\nof the world and he didn\u2019t see any advantage in explicating\nthem. Importantly, he couldn\u2019t conceive of their theoretical\nramifications or especially of their practical implications, such as\nfor engineering and technology. At the same time, Zhu did have a grasp\nof inertia and the relativity of motion, keys to solving the problems\nof motion, but it was not adequate to the task. The capacity to\nimagine ideal cases and relationships would have been necessary: for\nexample, Galileo had to conceive of the paradigmatic case of motion in\nterms of an object moving in a straight line on a frictionless plane\nat a constant velocity, something that can never occur in nature, for\nany actual object inevitably will be environed and influenced by a\nvariety of forces, such as gravity and friction. Essential, too, was\nthe mathematical plotting of motions in nature that approximate the\nparadigmatic motions, such as Kepler\u2019s plotting of planetary\nmotion and Galileo\u2019s plotting of the trajectories of\nprojectiles, to produce precise representations of near-paradigmatic\nmotions. Necessary, too, was an awareness of the possibility of\nmathematical calculation and precise predictions. Zhu\u2019s\nphilosophy involved viewing all things interactively in relative\ncontext. If he had had a notion of paradigmatic (perpetual) motion, it\nwould have been something like wave motions in the sea or the cyclical\npumping action of the traditional Chinese waterwheel used for\nirrigation with rising full troughs of water complemented by the\nfalling empty troughs (receptacles), which he had used to depict the\nyin-yang operation of taiji. Zhu also lacked the\nnecessary notions of precise mathematicization, measurement, and\ncalculation in terms of which to make the theory of motion bear fruit.\nConsequently, it is hardly to be expected that Zhu or any one else in\nhis intellectual circle should have had occasion to formulate anything\nlike a scientific theory of motion.\n\nSeveral features of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought and his notion of\nobservation discouraged him from forming a genuinely scientific theory\nor making scientific observations. Zhu was loath to investigate the\nsorts of fundamental abstract concepts, such as element, compound,\ninfinity, space, time, void, causality, and law, that were necessary\nfor making breakthroughs in the scientific revolution. Because of the\nConfucian commonsense approach to things, Zhu was disinclined to\npursue or investigate such abstract, intangible, and seemingly\nephemeral notions. He tended to think that focusing on concepts like\nvoid, nothingness, infinity, and space would draw people away from the\nworld of human affairs and ultimately incline them toward pointless\nintrospection. Zhu\u2019s concern with the real world itself stymied\nhis investigations into the very abstract concepts necessary for\nconstructing a better grasp of this so-called real world.\n\nZhu Xi had a \u201cparticularistic\u201d tendency to investigate\neach phenomenon on its own terms, without attempting to relate it to\nmore general explanatory principles, as in his treatment of inertia\nand the relativity of motion. In another case, he discussed the\ndifficulty of boiling rice atop a particular mountain in terms of the\ncharacteristics of the qi (cosmic vapor) of that mountain,\nwithout relating the phenomenon generally to characteristics of\nqi (as air pressure) at high altitudes. Inevitably, this\nignoring of general principles made Zhu less sensitive to the\ncontradictions that arose when he offered more than one explanation of\na single phenomenon.\n\nWhy did Zhu Xi go to the trouble of constructing his elaborate system\nand making and discussing all these observations if they didn\u2019t\ncarry him beyond common sense to a deeper and more accurate perception\nand account of reality, to go beyond the details of particular cases\nto more general principles and truths? Zhu\u2019s ultimate purpose\nwas pragmatic rather than epistemic; that is, he was laying out the\nconcepts, framework, and practices that he deemed most conducive to\nself-cultivation, self-realization, and ethical practice, rather than\nformulating objectively accurate concepts, systems, and methods for\nascertaining objective truths about the world. So, he did not have a\npractical interest in pushing his inquiries in purely scientific\ndirections. But, this way of putting it is not completely right\nbecause Zhu had considered a variety of philosophic positions and did\nthink he had selected the best and most accurate of the concepts and\nsystems at his disposal. And, he did attempt to render his ideas in a\nmanner that was faithful to reality, the devotion to which was one of\nhis core cultivation\n themes.[17]\n Clearly, he did not have the requisite concepts, framework, or style\nof thinking through which to conceive the world under overarching\nscientific principles and abstract generalities.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s working concepts and thought were typified by\nimmanental patterns (li) rather than by transcendental\nprinciples. He regarded reality, the world, not in terms of logical\norder, but as manifesting aesthetic order. Reality for him was not\ncomposed of independent atoms operating under general laws; rather it\nformed a field in which particulars appeared as foci determined in\ncontext. To Zhu, ours is not an absolute, objective universe in which\nparticular individuals are subsumed under generalities and behave\naccording to universal laws; rather, the world unfolds before us in\nlight of our increasing, expanding perception of the arrays of\nparticular phenomena around us. The world we experience is a function\nof, a field manifested as, the tapestry formed through the resonance\namong the foci making up that field. Consequently, the task of\ninvestigating things is a process of unfolding (rather than an\ninductive process), an exhausting of the li constituting\nparticular things and events, from their gestalt forms, such as the\nsymmetrical bilateral forms of most biological entities, to their\nidentifying forms to their functions and typical patterns of\ninteraction. Proceeding in this way, we seek not the most general laws\nor principles governing particular atomic individuals, but rather the\nmost basic or common patterns of interaction and formation among\nparticulars as foci in fields. Consequently, for example, the ultimate\npattern in Zhu\u2019s thought, taiji, the supreme polarity,\nis not an abstract ideal like a platonic form or a law of nature; it\nis an immanental pattern that is realized ubiquitously but\ndistributively, not overarchingly or generally. Zhu was not working\ntoward a scientific conception of the world, of reality, as\nconstituted on general principles and abstract equations; he was\ntraversing an alternative route by eliciting the formations of things\nand events in ecological context in a way that would open one\u2019s\nmind to the intimate resonance and intercourse among particulars as foci in fields. At\nthe same time, by stressing the expression \u201cgewu\nqiongli\u201d (investigate things to exhaust their li),\nZhu maintained a measure of analyticity in his insights to ensure that\nthe knowledge people gleaned was nuanced and textured enough to\ncontribute to life understanding and appropriate conduct.\n",
