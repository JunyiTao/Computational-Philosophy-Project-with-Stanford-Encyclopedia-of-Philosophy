    "preamble": "\n\n\nWilfrid Stalker Sellars (1912\u201389) was a systematic, original,\nand profound American philosopher.  His effort in philosophy was\n\u201cto formulate a scientifically oriented, naturalistic realism\nwhich would \u2018save the appearances\u2019\u2009\u201d (AR: 289).\nBroadly educated in philosophy, the influences on Sellars\u2019s work\nrange from critical realism and logical positivism to German Idealism\nand phenomenology.  Sellars was influential in part through his\neditorial work as a co-founder of the first American journal devoted\nto \u201canalytic\u201d philosophy and co-editor of two seminal\ncollections of essays that defined the canon for generations of\ngraduate students.  More significantly, he is known for his attack on\nthe \u201cmyth of the given\u201d and his development of a\ncoherentist epistemology and functional role/inferentialist semantics,\nfor his distinction between the \u201cmanifest image\u201d and the\n\u201cscientific image\u201d of the world, for his proposal that\npsychological concepts are like theoretical concepts, and for a\ntough-minded scientific realism.  Sellars can claim the first explicit\nformulation of a functionalist treatment of intentional states, an\nearly recognition of the \u201chard problem\u201d of sensory\nconsciousness, and a thoroughgoing nominalism, as well as rich\ninterpretations of historical figures in philosophy. His work has\ninspired a number of contemporary philosophers, although they tend to\nfall into at least two camps, sometimes denominated\n\u201cright-wing\u201d and \u201cleft-wing\u201d Sellarsians.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\nWilfrid Stalker Sellars was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on 20 May\n1912, to Roy Wood and Helen Stalker Sellars.  His father was a\nsignificant philosopher in his own right, a professor at the\nUniversity of Michigan and a founder of American Critical Realism.\nWilfrid\u2019s childhood in Ann Arbor was interrupted for two years\nwhen he was 9: the family spent a year in New England, the summer at\nOxford, and the subsequent year in Paris, where Wilfrid attended the\nLyc\u00e9e Montaigne.  Returning to Ann Arbor, Sellars then attended\nthe high school run by the University\u2019s School of Education,\nwhere he particularly enjoyed mathematics.  Following his graduation\nin 1929, the family returned to Paris. Sellars entered the\nLyc\u00e9e Louis le Grand, where philosophy was in the curriculum\nand Marxism was in the air.  Not having discussed philosophy\npreviously with his father, he began in philosophy as a French\nMarxist, although his father\u2019s influence soon took precedence. (For a partial account of their philosophical connections, see F. Gironi 2017, 2018.)\nHe followed his year at the Lyc\u00e9e with six months in Munich,\npolishing his German.\nIn 1931 Sellars returned to Ann Arbor as an undergraduate\nphilosophy major, studying with his father, DeWitt Parker,\nC.H. Langford and others in Michigan\u2019s excellent department.\nAmong other things, he studied the work of Russell and Moore, modal\nlogic with Langford, and continued the dialogue with his father that\nhad begun in Paris.  At the height of the depression, Sellars was also\ninvolved in left-wing politics, campaigning for the socialist Norman\nThomas.  Because of his Lyc\u00e9e background, Sellars tested out of\na number of requirements, graduating college with his high school cohort in\n1933. He then enrolled at the University of Buffalo for an M.A., where he\nstudied Husserl and Kant with Marvin Farber.  \nSellars was a competitive athlete in college and won a Rhodes\nscholarship, which took him in the fall of 1934 to Oriel College at\nOxford, where he enrolled in the PPE program.  W. G. Maclagan was his\ntutor, and he came under the influence of H. A.  Prichard and\nH. H. Price, and, through them, Cook Wilson.  He took first class\nhonors in 1936 and returned that fall for a D. Phil., attempting a\ndissertation on Kant under T. D.  Weldon.  While at Oxford, he also\nmet his first wife, Mary Sharp, who was born in Yorkshire and to\nwhom he was married in 1938.  Unable to articulate his new\ninterpretation of Kant sufficiently well to complete the degree,\nSellars returned to the U.S. in the fall of 1937, entering the\ngraduate department at Harvard and passing his prelims in the spring\nof 1938. \nNewly married, Sellars was offered a job in 1938 at the University\nof Iowa by Herbert Feigl.  The department there was small, and Sellars\ntook charge of teaching the history of philosophy courses, working out\nthe view of the history of philosophy that informed his work\nthereafter.  But he never finished the dissertation at Harvard and was\nplagued for a number of years by an inability to get his thoughts down\non paper.  World War II interrupted his career; he served in the Navy\nfrom 1943\u201346.  When the war ended, Sellars had no choice\nbut to publish, and began a program of writing up to 10 hours a day,\nhowever much (or little) he produced.  Draft after draft of his first\nattempt slowly evolved into \u201cRealism and the New Way of\nWords.\u201d Once he established a writing process, Sellars began\npublishing steadily. For a thorough interpretation of Sellars\u2019 earliest publications, see P. Olen (2016, 2016).\nIn 1946, Sellars moved to the University of Minnesota, where he\nrejoined Feigl.  Together they published Readings in Philosophical\nAnalysis (1949), a classic early collection of analytical\nphilosophy, and founded Philosophical Studies, a leading\njournal of analytic philosophy.  With his colleague John Hospers,\nSellars published Readings in Ethical Theory (1952), which also\nbecame an industry standard.  Sellars chaired the department at\nMinnesota from 1952\u201359, a time which also saw the flowering of the\nMinnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science.\nIn the 1950s Sellars laid the groundwork for his systematic\napproach to philosophy in such path-breaking essays as \u201cSome\nReflections on Language Games\u201d (1954, expanded in 1963) and\n\u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of Mind,\u201d (1956) which\nTyler Burge (1992: 33) has called \u201cthe most influential paper of\nthe period.\u201d He visited at Yale in 1958, moving there as a\ntenured professor in 1959.  But Yale became factionalized, and Sellars\nthought the internal politics disrupted his ability to do philosophy.\nIn 1963 he moved to the University of Pittsburgh, which was in the\nprocess of reconstructing its philosophy department, becoming\na top-ranked department.  Sellars remained at Pittsburgh until his\ndeath in 1989, though he visited and lectured at a number of other\nuniversities.  He also accrued a number of honors, giving the John\nLocke Lectures in 1965, the Matchette Foundation Lectures in 1971, the\nJohn Dewey Lectures in 1973, and the Carus Lectures in 1977.  Sellars\nwas elected President of the Eastern Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association in 1970.  He published many books and\narticles and also left his mark on the profession by training a large\nnumber of graduate students (this author included).  He was productive\ninto the early 1980s, when a stroke slowed him down; he died 2 July\n1989.  Following a lull in interest in his philosophy in the late\n1980s and early 1990s, his work has garnered steadily increasing attention in the U. S. and abroad.   \n2. The Philosophical Enterprise and the Images of Humanity-in-the-World\nIn \u201cPhilosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\u201d [PSIM],\nSellars lays out his view of philosophy and its current situation.\n\u201cThe aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand\nhow things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in\nthe broadest possible sense of the term\u201d (PSIM, in SPR:1; in\nISR: 369).  \u201cTo achieve success in philosophy would be, to use a\ncontemporary turn of phrase, to \u2018know one\u2019s way\naround\u2019 \u2026, not in that unreflective way in which the\ncentipede of the story knew its way around before it faced the\nquestion, \u2018how do I walk?\u2019, but in that reflective way\nwhich means that no intellectual holds are barred\u201d\n(loc. cit.). Thus, philosophy is a reflectively conducted higher-order\ninquiry that is continuous with but distinguishable from any of the\nspecial disciplines, and the understanding it aims at must\nhave practical force, guiding our activities, both theoretical\nand practical.\nPSIM describes what Sellars sees as the major problem confronting\nphilosophy today.  This is the \u201cclash\u201d between \u201cthe\n\u2018manifest\u2019 image of man-in-the-world\u201d and \u201cthe\nscientific image.\u201d These two \u2018images\u2019 are\nidealizations of distinct conceptual frameworks in terms of which\nhumans conceive of the world and their place in it.  Sellars\ncharacterizes the manifest image as \u201cthe framework in terms of\nwhich man came to be aware of himself as man-in-the-world\u201d\n(PSIM, in SPR: 6; in ISR: 374), but it is, more broadly, the framework\nin terms of which we ordinarily observe and explain our world.  The\nfundamental objects of the manifest image are persons and things, with\nemphasis on persons, which puts normativity and reason at\ncenter stage.  According to the manifest image, people think\nand they do things for reasons, and both of these \u201ccan occur\nonly within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which\n[they] can be criticized, supported, refuted, in short,\nevaluated\u201d (PSIM, in SPR: 6; in ISR: 374).  In the manifest\nimage persons are very different from mere things; things do not act rationally, in accordance with normative rules, but only in accord with laws or perhaps habits. How and why\nnormative concepts and assessments apply to things is an important and contentious\nquestion within the framework. \nThe manifest image is not fixed or static; it can be refined both\nempirically and categorically.  Empirical refinement by\ncorrelational induction results in ever better observation-level\ngeneralizations about the world.  Categorial refinement consists in\nadding, subtracting, or reconceptualizing the basic objects recognized\nin the image, e.g., worrying about whether persons are best thought of\nin hylomorphic or dualistic categories or how things differ from\npersons.  Thus, the manifest image is neither unscientific nor\nanti-scientific.  It is, however, methodologically more promiscuous\nand often less rigorous than institutionalized science. Traditional\nphilosophy, philosophia perennis, endorses the manifest image\nas real and attempts to understand its structure. \nOne kind of categorial change, however, is excluded from the\nmanifest image by stipulation: the addition to the framework of new\nconcepts of basic objects by means of theoretical postulation.  This\nis the move Sellars stipulates to be definitive of the scientific\nimage.  Science, by postulating new kinds of basic entities (e.g.,\nsubatomic particles, fields, collapsing packets of probability waves),\nslowly constructs a new framework that claims to be a\ncomplete description and explanation of the world and its processes.\nThe scientific image grows out of and is methodologically posterior to\nthe manifest image, which provides the initial framework in which\nscience is nurtured, but Sellars claims that \u201cthe scientific\nimage presents itself as a rival image.  From its point of view\nthe manifest image on which it rests is an \u2018inadequate\u2019\nbut pragmatically useful likeness of a reality which first finds its\nadequate (in principle) likeness in the scientific image\u201d (PSIM,\nin SPR: 20; in ISR: 388). \nIs it possible to reconcile these two images?  Could manifest\nobjects reduce to systems of imperceptible scientific objects?\nAre manifest objects ultimately real, scientific objects merely\nabstract constructions valuable for the prediction and control of\nmanifest objects?  Or are manifest objects appearances to human minds\nof a reality constituted by systems of imperceptible particles or something even more basic, such as absolute processes (see FMPP)?\nSellars opts for the third alternative.  The manifest image is, in his\nview, a phenomenal realm \u00e0 la Kant, but science, at its\nPeircean ideal conclusion, reveals things as they are in themselves.\nDespite what Sellars calls \u201cthe primacy of the\nscientific image\u201d (PSIM, in SPR: 32; in ISR: 400), he ultimately\nargues for a \u201csynoptic vision\u201d in which the descriptive\nand explanatory resources of the scientific image are united with the\n\u201clanguage of community and individual intentions,\u201d which\n\u201cprovide[s] the ambience of principles and standards (above all,\nthose which make meaningful discourse and rationality itself possible)\nwithin which we live our own individual lives\u201d (PSIM, in SPR:\n40; in ISR: 408). \nNorms are not reduced away in Sellars\u2019s naturalism; he\naccommodates normativity, not as a basic, ontologically independent\nfeature of the world, but rather as a conceptually irreducible,\nindispensable aspect of distinctively human activity grounded in the\ncollective institution of principles and standards.  We will return to\nthe question of norms later in this article.\nSellars boldly proclaims that \u201cin the dimension of describing\nand explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of\nwhat is that it is, and of what is not that it is not\u201d (EPM\n\u00a741; in SPR: 173; in KMG: 253).  But understood in the context of\nhis system, this is not the proclamation of a harsh, reductive\nscientific realism, for (1) he does not believe that describing and\nexplaining are the only significant dimensions of human activity.  In\nparticular, he recognizes that prescription\nand proscription are (a) different from description and (b)\nindispensable to human activity.  And (2), his conception of ontology\nis object-oriented; the presence of normative truths does not\nbelie his fundamental naturalistic nominalism.  To begin to unpack\nthese claims, we need to look at Sellars\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage and his ontology.\n3. Language and Being\n3.1 Semantics\nSellars takes an unorthodox approach to language, but it is also\ncrucial for his naturalistic metaphysics.  The key to his view is that\nsemantic terms and descriptions provide functional classifications of\nlinguistic tokens.  His analysis of meaning statements such as \n\n\u2018Rot,\u2019 in German, means red\n\n or \n\n\u2018Brother\u2019 means male sibling\n\ntreats them as statements that convey the information that the word\nmentioned on the left-hand side has a relevantly similar usage to the\nphrase on the right-hand side.  These meaning statements, however, do\nnot explicitly say that the two expressions they each contain\nhave the same usage.  Rather, each sentence presupposes that the\nperson it is directed at already understands the background language,\nin this case English, and uses the expression on the right-hand side\nas an illustrating sortal to form an indexical predicate\n(forming a predicate by giving an example bearing the relevant\nproperty), which is then applied to the tokens picked out by\nthe expression on the left-hand side of the sentence.  Sellars\ninvented a device, dot-quotation, to express this formally.  Dot\nquotation forms a common noun (not a name) that applies to every item in any\nlanguage that functions in a relevantly similar way to the quoted\nexpression.  \u2022Red\u2022 is a common noun true of any expression\nthat functions like the English word \u2018red.\u2019 Thus, Sellars\nanalyzes \n\n\u2018Rot,\u2019 in German, means red\n\nas\n\n\u2018Rot\u2019s, in German, are \u2022red\u2022s.\n\n\u201cAccording to this analysis, meaning is not a relation\nfor the very simple reason that \u2018means\u2019 is\na specialized form of the copula\u201d (MFC: 431).  \nReference is also given a functional analysis. Reference, unlike meaning,\nis extensional.  While we can say that\nboth\n\n\u2018Venedig\u2019 (in German) refers to Venice\n\nand\n\n\u2018Venedig\u2019s are German \u2022Venice\u2022s\n\nare true, we can\u2019t say that both\n\n\u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019 (in German) refers to Venice\n\nand\n\n\u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019s are German \u2022Venice\u2022s\n\nare true.  The first member of each pair is true, but \u2018die\nK\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019 has a different sense from\n\u2018Venice,\u2019 because it is a descriptive phrase and has an\ninternal syntactic and semantic complexity that the proper name\n\u2018Venice\u2019 does not.  Sellars guarantees the extensionality\nof reference by introducing a quantifier into his analysis of\n\u2018refers\u2019 statements.  He takes reference statements to\nquantify implicitly over senses, that is, functions of expressions,\nand then defines an extensional relation of material or extensional\nequivalence between senses (see SM III \u00a763: 84).  Our example\nsentences are then analyzed, where \u2018S\u2019 is variable over\nsenses (so that \u2018S\u2019 is a higher-order substitutional variable whose substituends are sortals such as \u2022Venice\u2022), as \n\nFor some S, \u2018Venedig\u2019 (in German) stands for S,\nand S is materially equivalent to \u2022Venice\u2022\n\nand\n\nFor some S, \u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019(in\nGerman) stands for S, and S is materially equivalent to\n\u2022Venice\u2022.\n\nThe idea of a reference relation is the heart of orthodox semantic\ntheory in contemporary logic and the philosophy of language, but\nSellars denies that reference is a relation, just as he denies that\nmeaning is a relation.  The same goes for truth, which classical\ntheories try to understand through some correspondence relation\npurported to hold between sentences and the world.  Sellars endorses\ninstead a pragmatist conception of truth:\n[F]or a proposition to be true is for it to be assertible,\nwhere this means not\ncapable of being asserted \u2026 but correctly\nassertible; assertible, that is, in accordance with the relevant\nsemantical rules, and on the basis of such additional, though\nunspecified, information as these rules may require\u2026 .\n\u2018True\u2019, then, means semantically assertible\n(\u2018S-assertible\u2019) and the varieties of truth correspond to\nthe relevant varieties of semantical rule (SM, IV, \u00a726:\n101).\nThe \u201cvarieties of truth\u201d Sellars speaks of include\nempirical truth (which involves the picturing relation mentioned\nbelow), mathematical truth, legal truth, moral truth, etc. \nThis is a version of a use theory of meaning.  Sellars\ndistinguishes three different generic dimensions of usage:\nlanguage-entry transitions, intralinguistic transitions, and\nlanguage-exit transitions.  Some examples: Contexts of perception and\nobservation are those in which one enters a language in\nresponse to some form of sensory stimulation.  The announcement of a\nresolution followed by an action that attempts to carry it out is a\ncase of exiting a language.  Intralinguistic transitions\ninclude inferences and responses of one kind or another.  In\ncontrast to Quine\u2019s emphasis on occasion sentences, Sellars puts\nparticular emphasis on the importance of intralinguistic connections,\nan aspect of his view that has been further developed in Robert\nBrandom\u2019s inferentialism.  Sellars distinguishes formal\ninferences, which are a matter of the syntactic rules of the language,\nfrom material inferences, which are not a function of syntactic\nstructure alone.  The inference from \u2018This is red\u2019 to\n\u2018This is colored\u2019 is one example of a material inference,\nbut, in Sellars\u2019s view, so is the inference from \u2018It is\nraining\u2019 to \u2018The street will be wet\u2019.  Material\ninferences are not merely enthymemes ultimately to be made good by\nsupplying an explicit principle: the web of material inferences an\nexpression is involved in, especially the subjunctives it sustains,\ndetermines its core meaning.\nSellars has a complex view of what ties language to the world.  In\nthe first instance, language is tied to the world, not by a single\nreference (or \u2018satisfaction\u2019) relation, but by the\nmultitude of relationships \u2014 causal (in both directions),\nspatio-temporal, and normative \u2014 between tokens of linguistic\nexpressions and the world.  Sellars does, however, single out for\nspecial attention a relation he calls picturing.  Though the\nnotion of picturing is inspired by early Wittgenstein, in\nSellars\u2019s version it is a natural, non-semantic relation\nbetween objects, not facts.  The relata are, on the one hand,\nwhat Sellars calls \u2018natural linguistic objects,\u2019 tokens of\nlinguistic expressions, and, on the other hand, objects in the world.\nThe basic idea is that in any empirically meaningful language, the\noccurrences of a certain class of linguistic events (namely,\nfirst-level, atomic, matter-of-factual statements playing roles in\nobservational and volitional contexts) have to constitute a map\nor picture of the surrounding environment in virtue of an\nisomorphism between the properties of worldly objects and counterpart\nproperties of the linguistic events.  Sellars thinks this is a\ncondition on any empirically meaningful language, but he also\nbelieves that one of the tasks of science is to improve the accuracy\nand refine the grain of such an isomorphism.  Sellars\u2019s notion\nof picturing has puzzled many, but we can see an influence on Ruth\nMillikan\u2019s biosemantics, as well as Huw Price\u2019s recent\n(2011, 2013) distinction between e-representation and\ni-representation. \n3.2 Ontology\nSellars often described his realistic naturalism as\n\u2018nominalistic,\u2019 but the point is not so much to deny that\nthere are abstracta as to tell us what language that uses abstract\nsingular terms is doing for us and how differently it functions from\nlanguage using concrete singular terms. If we understand how abstract\nsingular terms function, the claims of the Platonist metaphysician\nseem an elaborate (and perhaps misleading) way to make a simpler, more\npragmatic point.  First, Sellars argues that the then-prevalent\nstandard of ontological commitment \u2014being the value of a\nvariable of quantification\u2014 is mistaken (GE, NAO).  Such a\ncriterion makes the indeterminate reference of quantified variables\nmore primitive than any form of determinate reference. This is\nincompatible with Sellars\u2019s understanding of naturalism, and he\nclaims it also gets the grammar of existence claims wrong.  (Sellars\nconstrues quantification substitutionally; see Lance 1996.)  Sellars\nproposes a different standard: we are committed to the kinds of things\nwe can explicitly name and classify in the ground-level, empirical,\nobject-language statements we take to be true.\nIn ordinary language we often talk about meanings, properties,\npropositions, etc., thus apparently committing ourselves to the\nexistence of such abstracta.  Sellars interprets such talk as material\nmode metalinguistic speech about the functional roles of\nexpression-kinds.  Thus, a sentence such as\n\nEuclidean triangularity entails having angles that sum to two right angles\n\n\nconveys information about the function of the \u2022triangle\u2022,\nnamely, that its use (in Euclidean contexts)entitles one to a\n\u2022has angles summing to two right angles\u2022.  Similarly,\nSellars interprets fact-talk as material mode metalinguistic speech\nabout truths.  The only things to which we are ontologically committed\nby the use of abstract singular terms are linguistic items:\nspecifically, expression-tokens that participate in complex causal\nsystems which involve, inter alia, normatively assessable interactions\nbetween language users and the world.  In Sellars\u2019s\nreconstruction of it, talk of abstract entities does not have\nexplanatory force, but is involved in making explicit certain\nlinguistic norms.\nPlatonic realists are often moved by the belief that the most basic\nlinguistic structure, predication itself, involves a commitment to\nabstracta, for common explications of predication make essential\nmention of properties, relations, and such.  Sellars argues that this\ngets the order of explication exactly wrong: apparently purely\ndescriptive claims about property instantiation are, in fact,\nmisleading ways of communicating norms of linguistic\ncorrectness. Sellars offers a different explication of predication,\naccording to which the focus is not on any relation between an object\nand some abstract entity, but qualifying and arranging names to suit\nthem for certain linguistic purposes. So understood, the Platonist\u2019s\ntreatment of predication seems, again, to be an elaborate and\nmisleading way to make a simpler, more pragmatic point. At the most\nbasic, atomic level, predication is a matter of endowing names\nwith counterpart characteristics of the objects they purport to name,\nenabling some true atomic sentences to \u2018map\u2019 or\n\u2018picture\u2019 objects in the world. Predication thus commits\none only to natural objects potentially correlated with each other.\nNAO, chapter 3, contains the most complete statement of this view. \nSellars gives a unified treatment of the alethic, causal, and\ndeontic modalities as (once again) material mode metalinguistic speech\nexpressing the inferential commitments and priorities embedded in the\nlanguage.  Thus, using modal language in talking about the world and\nour agency in the world does not commit us to recognizing\nindependent, metaphysically real necessary connections or the existence of moral\nfacts independent of moral agents.  It does commit us to prescribing\nand proscribing certain linguistic or conceptual transitions, including\nlanguage-exit transitions that emerge in action.  As Robert Kraut\ndescribes it, \u201cmetaphysical claims that initially appear to\nstate language-world connections\u2014claims about the relation\nbetween predicates and properties, for example\u2014are, on\nSellars\u2019s theory, construed as normative claims about\nappropriate linguistic usage\u201d (Kraut 2010: 601).\n4. Epistemology\nIn his theory of knowledge Sellars attempts to balance competing\ninsights in several different dimensions \u2014\nempiricist-rationalist, foundationalist-coherentist,\nexternalist-internalist, realist-phenomenalist-idealist \u2014 while\nalso keeping an eye on the deep connections between epistemology and\nthe metaphysics of mind.  His attack on the \u2018myth of the\ngiven\u2019 is renowned, so we begin there.  \nAntecedent to epistemology, Sellars\u2019s treatment of semantics\nessentially constitutes a denial of what can be called a semantic\ngiven\u2014the idea that some of our terms or concepts,\nindependently of their occurrence in formal and material inferences,\nderive their meaning directly from confrontation with a particular\n(kind of) object or experience.  Sellars is anti-foundationalist in\nhis theories of concepts, knowledge, and truth.\nTraditional epistemology assumed that knowledge is hierarchically\nstructured.  There must, it was believed, be some cognitive states in\ndirect contact with reality that serve as a firm foundation on which\nthe rest of our knowledge is built by various inferential methods.\nThis foundationalist picture of knowledge imposes two\nrequirements on knowledge: (1) There must be cognitive states that\nare basic in the sense that they possess some positive\nepistemic status independently of their epistemic relations to any\nother cognitive states.  I call this the Epistemic Independence\nRequirement [EIR].  Positive epistemic statuses include being\nknowledge, being justified, or just having some presumption in\nits favor.  (It was popular to claim that basic cognitions must\npossess an unassailable epistemic warrant \u2014 certainty,\nincorrigibility, or even infallibility \u2014 but this is not as\ncommon today.)  Epistemic relations include deductive and inductive\nimplication.  (2) Every nonbasic cognitive state can possess positive\nepistemic status only because of the epistemic relations it bears,\ndirectly or indirectly, to basic cognitive states.  Thus the basic\nstates must provide the ultimate support for the rest of our\nknowledge, which I call the Epistemic Efficacy Requirement [EER].\nSuch basic, independent and efficacious, cognitive states would be\nthe given.  Many philosophers have believed that there has to\nbe such a given, if there is to be any knowledge at all.  \nSome commentators on Sellars take his attack on the given to turn\non rejecting the belief that any cognitive state could\nhave unassailable warrant or certainty.  Although Sellars was a\nfallibilist and believed that any cognitive state could be challenged,\nhis argument against the given does not worry about this issue.  If\nthe foundationalist picture of the structure of knowledge is itself\nwrong, the strength of foundational warrant is irrelevant.\nSellars denies not only that there must be a given, but that\nthere can be a given in the sense defined, for nothing can\nsatisfy both EIR and EER.  To satisfy EER, a basic cognition must be\ncapable of participating in inferential relations with other\ncognitions; it must possess propositional form and be truth-evaluable.\nTo meet EIR, such a propositionally structured cognition must possess\nits epistemic status independently of inferential connections to other\ncognitions.  No cognitive states satisfy both requirements.\nThe standard candidates for basic empirical knowledge either fail\nEER (e.g., knowledge of sense-data), or presuppose other knowledge on\nthe part of the knower, and thus fail EIR (e.g., knowledge of\nappearances).  Such states count as\ncognitive states only because of their epistemic relations\nto other cognitive states.  Because he argues by cases, it is unclear\nwhether some other candidates might satisfy both requirements.  There\nis no exhaustive list of all possible candidates for the given. Thus,\nthe argument is not a conclusive, once-and-for-all refutation of\nfoundationalism, but it is a significant challenge to it, putting the\nburden of proof on the defenders of a given.  If it works, one has to\nabandon any picture of knowledge acquisition as piecemeal and\nincremental.  Sellars\u2019s argument, in combination with arguments\nby Quine and Davidson, among others, has put foundationalism on the\ndefensive since, roughly, the mid-point of the 20th\ncentury.\nA reconstruction of Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s Argument that the given is a myth, from\n\u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\u201d.\n\n\n1.\nA cognitive state is epistemically independent if it\npossesses its epistemic status independently of\nits being inferred or inferrable from some other\ncognitive state.\n[Definition of epistemic independence]\n\n2.\nA cognitive state is epistemically efficacious \u2014 is capable\nof epistemically supporting other cognitive states \u2014 if the\nepistemic status of those other states can be validly inferred\n(formally or materially) from its epistemic status.\n[Definition of epistemic efficacy]\n\n3\nThe doctrine of the given is that any empirical knowledge that\np requires some (or is itself) basic, that is, epistemically\nindependent, knowledge (that g, h, i, \u2026)\nwhich is epistemically efficacious with respect to p.\n[Definition of doctrine of the given]\n\n4.\nInferential relations are always between items with\npropositional form.\n[By the nature of inference]\n\n5.\nTherefore, non-propositional items (such as sense\ndata) are epistemically inefficacious and cannot\nserve as what is given.\n[From 2 and 4]\n\n6.\nNo inferentially acquired, propositionally structured\nmental state is epistemically independent.\n[From 1]\n\n7.\nExamination of multiple candidates for non-inferentially acquired,\npropositionally structured cognitive states indicates that their\nepistemic status presupposes the possession by the knowing subject of\nother empirical knowledge, both of particulars and of general\nempirical truths.\n[From Sellars\u2019s analyses of statements about\nsense-data and appearances in Parts 1\u2013IV of EPM and his analysis of\nepistemic authority in Part VIII]\n\n8.\nPresupposition is an epistemic and therefore an\ninferential relation.\n[Assumed (See PRE)]\n\n9.\nNon-inferentially acquired empirical knowledge that\npresupposes the possession by the knowing\nsubject of other empirical knowledge is not\nepistemically independent.\n[From 1, 7, and 8]\n\n10.\nAny empirical, propositional cognition is acquired\neither inferentially or non-inferentially.\n[Excluded middle]\n\n11.\nTherefore, propositionally structured cognitions,\nwhether inferentially or non-inferentially\nacquired, are never epistemically independent\nand cannot serve as the given. \n[6, 9, 10, constructive dilemma]\n\n12.\nEvery cognition is either propositionally structured\nor not.\n[Excluded middle]\n\n13.\nTherefore, it is reasonable to believe that no item of\nempirical knowledge can serve the function of a\ngiven.\n[5,11, 12, constructive dilemma]\n\nRejecting the myth of the given is not yet a positive epistemology.\nSellars can abandon the myth of the given only if he gives us a\npositive theory of non-inferential knowledge to replace it.  (There\nmust be non-inferential knowledge, that is, knowledge that is\nnot acquired by inference, even if its epistemic status depends\non its inferential connections to other knowledge.)\nThe paradigm cases of non-inferential knowledge are introspection,\nperception, and memory [IPM] beliefs (see MGEC).  According to\nSellars, such beliefs have epistemic status because, given the\nprocesses by which language and beliefs are acquired, they are likely\nto be true. IPM beliefs are reliable indicators, like the temperature\nreadings on a thermometer.  This is a reliablist or externalist\ncondition on such knowledge.  A chain of empirical justification can\nproperly start with IPM beliefs because they are noninferential\nreliable indicators of the truth of their contents.  Thus, their occurrence licenses an\ninference to the likely truth of their contents, and thence to other\nconsequences by formal or material rules of inference.\nBut Sellars is not, in the end, a reliablist.  Thermometers may be\nhighly reliable, but they have no knowledge.  Sellars adds another\ncondition: the subject must know that her IPM belief is\nreliable.  This imposes a reflexivity requirement on knowledge.\n[T]o be fully a master of his language, Jones must know\n[some] facts about what is involved in learning to use perceptual\nsentences in perceptual contexts. Thus, Jones too must know that other\nspecifiable things being equal, the fact that a person says \u2018Lo!\nHere is a red apple\u2019 is a good reason to believe that he is\nindeed in the presence of a red apple. Thus, Jones, too, can reason:\n\nI just thought-out-loud \u2018Lo! Here is a red\napple\u2019 (no countervailing conditions obtain); So,\nthere is good reason to believe that there is a red apple in front of\nme. (SK II \u00a740: 325)\n\n\nThe point is not simply that knowers are capable of metajudgments.\nSellars has a larger condition in mind: \u201cThe essential point is\nthat in characterizing an episode or a state as that\nof knowing, we are not giving an empirical description of that\nepisode or state; we are placing it in the logical space of reasons,\nof justifying and being able to justify what one says\u201d (EPM:\n\u00a736, in SPR: 169; in KMG: 248).  This dictum needs to be combined\nwith another well-known Sellarsian pronouncement: \u201cNow the idea\nthat epistemic facts can be analysed without remainder\u2014even\n\u2018in principle\u2019\u2014into non-epistemic facts, whether\nphenomenal or behavioural, public or private, with no matter how\nlavish a sprinkling of subjunctives and hypotheticals is, I believe, a\nradical mistake\u2014a mistake of a piece with the so-called\n\u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019 in ethics\u201d (EPM: \u00a75, in\nSPR: 131; in KMG: 209). \nIn order to operate within \u201cthe logical space of\nreasons,\u201d one must be at home with normative discourse,\nresponsive to reasons as such, sensitive to standards of correctness\nand appropriateness.  This requirement imposes a\ncoherentist/holist condition that precludes the possibility of\natomistically isolable cognitive states: any cognitive state,\nincluding bottom-level, non-inferential IPM beliefs, can be cognitive\nonly as one element in a complex, reflexively structured system of\nsuch states responsive to epistemic norms and goals.\nSuch a holism of cognitive states raises an obvious problem: how\ncould one start acquiring cognitive states without falling into\ncircularity or regress?  The normativity of the cognitive is crucial\nto Sellars\u2019s answer: we can acquire piecemeal by natural, causal\npathways the individual habits and dispositions that, when present in\nsufficient numbers and appropriately interrelated, warrant the\napplication of the normative language of cognition.\nEven so, Sellars rejects the traditional forms of both\nfoundationalism and coherentism.\nOne seems forced to choose between the picture of an\nelephant which rests on a tortoise (What supports the tortoise?) and\nthe picture of a great Hegelian serpent of knowledge with its tail in\nits mouth (Where does it begin?). Neither will do.  For empirical\nknowledge, like its sophisticated extension, science, is rational, not\nbecause it has a foundation but because it is a self-correcting\nenterprise which can put any claim in jeopardy, though not all at once\n(EPM \u00a738, in SPR: 170; in KMG: 250).\n5. Philosophy of Mind\nSellars\u2019s philosophy of mind is deeply Kantian in the sense\nthat he draws a sharp distinction between thought and sense.  The intentionality-body problem requires a different solution from the sensorium-body\nproblem.  His philosophy of mind\nabandons many of the assumptions taken for granted by the Cartesian\ntradition (e.g., the transparent or self-intimating nature of the\nmental), moving towards a naturalism that respects the normative\ndimension of mind.  His key idea is that psychological concepts are like\ntheoretical concepts in the sciences. Mentalistic concepts\nare thus as compatible with naturalism as any well-grounded scientific\nconcept.\nSellars defends these claims in his classic article, EPM.  The\n\u201cRylean myth\u201d narrated in parts 12\u201316 of EPM is a\nthought experiment aimed to convince us that the Cartesian story is\nnot the only possible story about our knowledge of the mental.  The thought experiment\nhypothesizes a community of proto-humans who lack concepts of inner\npsychological states, although they possess a complex language for\ndescribing and explaining objects and events in the world.  Sellars\ncalls them \u2018Ryleans\u2019 in honor of Gilbert Ryle, the Oxford\nphilosopher whose book, The Concept of Mind, argues eloquently\nfor a version of logical behaviorism.  This community possesses a\nbehaviorist\u2019s ability to explain human behavior as well as\nmetalinguistic abilities to describe and prescribe linguistic\nbehavior.  Thus, the community has semantic concepts at its disposal.\nSellars claims that such a community can reasonably increase its\nexplanatory resources by postulating unobservable states internal to\neach person that modulate that person\u2019s responses to the world.\nMoreover, there is motive to postulate two different kinds of internal\nstates: one kind\u2014thoughts\u2014has properties modeled on the\nsemantic properties of overt linguistic events, while the\nother\u2014sense impressions\u2014has properties modeled on the\nproperties of perceptible objects.  Thoughts are postulated to explain\nhow the members of the community can engage in complex patterns of\nreasonable behavior even when silent.  Sense impressions are\npostulated to explain why members of the community acquire conceptual representations of objects as before them, even, at times, when such objects are not present.  If Sellars\u2019s story\nis coherent, then the traditional view that our concepts and knowledge\nof the mental are simply given is not compulsory, and a\nnaturalistic treatment of the mental is potentially viable.\n5.1 Intentionality\nThe fundamental thought behind Sellars\u2019s treatment of\nintentionality is that our concepts of intentionality and intentional\nstates are derived from concepts pertaining to linguistic behavior.\nNotice, this is not the claim that we always think in language or that\nwe learn to speak before we learn to think, which claims have\nmistakenly been attributed to Sellars.  Sellars is not engaged in\narmchair psychology but with what legitimates our use of psychological\nconcepts. \nThis approach to intentionality mobilizes Sellars\u2019s\nfunctionalist treatment of meaning.  Attributing a thought (hope,\nregret, desire \u2026) that p to someone is a complex affair.\nIn the first instance, such an attribution locates the relevant state\nof the person \u201cin the logical space of reasons.\u201d  This is to place the\nstate-type of the person within a vast network of possible intentional\nstate- and action-types related to each other by normative relations\nof inference, exclusion, relevance, and propriety.  But actual\nintentional state-types must be embodied in physical tokens, so\nattributing an intentional state to someone effectively attributes to\nthat person as well a behavioral control system that is so structured\nthat something analogous to theoretical and practical inference goes\non within it and, in this case, has a \u2022p\u2022 active in\nit in the appropriate way. Being active \u201cin the appropriate\nway\u201d within someone\u2019s behavioral control system will\ninclude participating in patterns of dispositions to infer and be\ninferred from other intentional states that mirror the patterns of\nrelationships in the logical space of reasons, as well being tied to\nsensory input and to output activities in appropriate ways.\nThis approach is incompatible with the traditional view that the\nmeaning of linguistic items is to be explained in terms of the\nthoughts they express.  This issue is the heart of Sellars\u2019s\ncorrespondence with Roderick Chisholm, published as\n\u201cIntentionality and the Mental\u201d [ITM].  Chisholm\nmaintained that reference to mental states is always implicit in\nsemantic statements and in our ability to comprehend the meanings of\nutterances.  Sellars demurs:\nThe argument presumes that the metalinguistic vocabulary\nin which we talk about linguistic episodes can be analysed in terms\nwhich do not presuppose the framework of mental acts; in particular\nthat\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d means p\n\nis not to be analysed as\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d expresses t and t is about\np where t is a thought. (ITM: 522)\nIn Sellars\u2019s view, thought is prior to language in the order\nof being, but language is prior to thought in the order of knowing.\nThat is, linguistic utterances are normally the product of internal\nthinking activity, which they express.  The Ryleans in Sellars\u2019s\nmyth have thoughts that are expressed in their utterances, but\nthey don\u2019t realize that they have such inner states.  They have\nthe notion of a meaningful utterance before generating the\nnotion of a meaningful thought, modeled on the former notion.\nThus, language is prior to thought in the order of knowing.\nIn his early work (see, e.g., EPM \u00a729), Sellars takes a hard\nline equating language possession and the ability to think, thereby denying thought to\ninfralinguals, but in later pieces, most notably SK and MEV, he\nmodifies this position.  He makes room for non-linguistic thought in\nhumans, recognizing that visual perception and imagination are\n\u201cin a sense most difficult to analyze, a thinking in color about\ncolored objects\u201d (SK I \u00a737: 305).  Then, in \u201cMental\nEvents,\u201d Sellars introduces a distinction\nbetween propositional form and\nlogical form that he did not utilize earlier.  \u201cTo have\npropositional form, a basic representational state must represent an\nobject and represent it as of a certain character\u201d (MEV: 336).\nItems in many non-linguistic representational systems such as maps\npossess propositional form by this characterization.  Logical form,\nhowever, is possessed by items that belong to representational systems\nthat include distinct symbols for logical operators.  In this late\nessay, Sellars acknowledges that animals possess representations with\npropositional form and can make, correspondingly, what Sellars calls\n\u201cHumean inferences,\u201d that is, material inferences that\nemploy no explicit generalization or logical principle.  His example\nis the move from \u201cSmoke here\u201d to \u201cFire\nnearby.\u201d Human representational systems possess logical form;\nthey enable us to engage in what he calls \u201cAristotelian\ninferences\u201d in which a general principle is explicitly\nrepresented: \u201cSmoke here.  Wherever there\u2019s smoke,\nthere\u2019s fire.  So, Fire nearby.\u201d This, Sellars claims, is\nthe crucial difference between animal and human: full-fledged thinkers\ncan recognize conditionality and generality as such, because\nthey possess explicit symbols for if\u2026then, all,\nand some.  \nSellars\u2019s treatment of intentionality has implications for\nfirst-person authority and the \u201cproblem of other minds.\u201d\nReports of one\u2019s own mental state cannot\nhave an intrinsic or absolute, apriori warrant, nor can privileged\naccessibility be the defining trait of the mental, as some have\nclaimed.  The extent and strength of first-person warrant rests\nultimately on the empirical reliability of such reports, just as the\nwarrant of observation reports does.  This extends as well to\nobservation reports concerning the mental states of others, for are\nnot we able, upon occasion, to see someone\u2019s joy or\nmisery?  The \u201cproblem of other minds\u201d never really gets\noff the ground in the context of Sellars\u2019s philosophy, for the\n\u201cconcepts pertaining to such inner episodes as thoughts are\nprimarily and essentially inter-subjective, as inter-subjective as the\nconcept of a positron, and ... the reporting role of these concepts\n\u2014 the fact that each of us has a privileged access to his\nthoughts \u2014 constitutes a dimension of the use of these concepts\nwhich is built on and presupposes this intersubjective status\u201d\n(EPM: \u00a759; in SPR: 189; in KMG: 269).\nSellars\u2019s treatment of mentalistic concepts as similar to\ntheoretical concepts has been cited as an inspiration for the\n\u201ctheory-theory\u201d in developmental psychology.  This is the\nnotion that the mechanisms we utilize to detect and attribute thoughts\nin ourselves and others operate via a kind of tacit theory application\nand that there is a developmental stage in children during which they\nacquire a \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and learn to apply it.  (See\nAstington et al. 1988; Gopnik and Wellman, 1994; Wellman, 1990;\nGarfield et al., 2001.)  This creative extension of Sellars\u2019s\nproposal is not something he is committed to; he is not engaged in\nempirical theorizing. \nSellars\u2019s treatment of mentalistic concepts has also inspired\neliminativist philosophies of mind such as that espoused by the\nChurchlands.  The idea is that if folk psychology is like a theory,\nthen, like any theory, it could be superseded and replaced by a better\ntheory as scientific psychology and neuroscience progress.  Sellars\nhimself, however, was unmoved by this idea, because the concepts of\nfolk psychology (of the manifest image) are not focused solely (or\nmaybe even principally) on the description and explanation of\nphenomena.  In the course of science, better descriptions of what is\ngoing on in our heads when we think and sense will be developed, but\nsuch descriptions could have only a part of the function of mentalistic\nlanguage.  The language of agency, to which we will shortly return, is\nindispensable and cannot be replaced by the language of any scientific\ntheory.  \n5.2 The Sensory\nSellars\u2019s treatment of the sensory is particularly complex;\nthis article can only summarize.  The context is, again, the idea that\nour concepts of sensory states are, in some important ways, like\ntheoretical concepts.  Concepts of sensory states, however, are\nintroduced to explain different phenomena from those that concepts of\nintentional states are introduced to explain.  They are originally\nintroduced to explain illusions, hallucinations and such, cases in\nwhich people sincerely report and behave as if perceiving something\nthat is not there.  Once introduced for those purposes, however, such\nconcepts must be applied generally: we cannot think that we have\nsensations only in cases of illusion and hallucination.  A\nphilosophically satisfactory theory of the sensory must account for\nthe complexity and peculiarities of the language of sensory\nexperience, both illusory and veridical.\nIt is therefore crucial to my thesis to emphasize that\nsense impressions or raw feels are common sense theoretical constructs\nintroduced to explain the occurrence not of white rat type\ndiscriminative behavior, but rather of perceptual propositional\nattitudes, and are therefore bound up with the explanation of why\nhuman language contains families of predicates having the logical\nproperties of words for perceptible qualities and relations.  (IAMB in\nPP: 387; in ISR: 366)\nSellars then argues that the language of perceptible qualities and\nrelations cannot be reduced to or replaced by any vocabulary we\ncurrently project to be adequate to the behavior of mere physical\nobjects.\nThe argument for this claim is complex.  There is a\nquasi-historical story about how the conception of the proper and\ncommon sensibles has been transformed over the course of human history\nand an argument that this story is constrained in a particular way\nthat blocks a reductive interpretation of our concepts of the sensory\n(the so-called \u2018grain argument\u2019).  Nonetheless, Sellars\nargues that, in the end, sensory states will turn out to be physical\nstates of a very particular ilk that exist only in the context of\nliving organisms.  They are, in the terminology Sellars developed with\nhis colleague Paul Meehl, physical1 but not\nphysical2, where \nPhysical1: an event or entity\nis physical1 if it belongs in the space-time\nnetwork.\nPhysical2: an event or entity\nis physical2 if it is definable in terms of\ntheoretical primitives adequate to describe completely the actual\nstates though not necessarily the potentialities of the universe\nbefore the appearance of life. (CE: 252)\nSensory states are, thus, historically emergent in the universe,\nbut nonetheless physical: the effort to provide a complete description\nand explanation of the physics of sentient beings will expand the\ntheoretical primitives utilized in that science, relocating the\nlogical space of the proper and common sensibles within physics as a\nprimitive vocabulary.  \nThe quasi-history of our sensory concepts starts with a mythical\nbeginning in which the concepts that we think of as concepts of\nsensible qualities are taken to be concepts of the very substance of\nthings.  \u2018Blue triangle\u2019 is construed as we would now\nconstrue \u2018metal triangle\u2019.  But treating sensibles as\nsubstantive cannot go very far; it does not provide a useful way of\nclassifying, explaining, and predicting the behavior of the things we\nencounter.  The sensibles soon become treated as\noccurrent qualities of substances with complex causal profiles.\nThe view that the sensibles are modifications of substances is then\nsupplemented with the notion that they possess a subsidiary and\nanalogous being-for-mind that explains our ability to apprehend them\ndirectly (unlike causal dispositions) and to be sometimes mistaken\nabout their presence.  In the current manifest image, this is how we\nthink of sensible properties, according to Sellars.  Physical objects\nare colored, odorous, etc., but \u2018color,\u2019\n\u2018odor,\u2019etc. also apply in an analogous way to our sensory\nstates.  The rise of a new, atomistic science has started to push our\nconception of the sensibles in new directions.  First, it encourages a\nreinterpretation of the distinction between the common and the proper\nsensibles.  The common sensibles, those available to more than one\nsense, include such geometric and dynamic properties as shape and\nmotion; these apply to physical objects and their microconstituents,\nbecause physical explanations exploit such properties.  The proper\nsensibles are the qualities available only to specific senses,\nincluding colors, odors, etc., and they do not apply to the\nmicroconstituents of physical objects, because they do no explanatory\nwork in physical laws.  Primary and secondary qualities are distinct\nin kind, and secondary qualities are demoted to second-class,\nsubjective status.  They exist only in the mind, as states of the\nperceiver.  The next move seems clear: the mind itself is subjected to\nscientific investigation and becomes increasingly identified with the\nbrain or central nervous system.  But the proper sensibles can no more\nexist in the brain than in any other kind of matter.  This brings us\nto our current predicament: we are unable to find a place in the world\nfor the proper sensibles, which have been brutually (and\nmetaphysically) severed from the common sensibles, even though color\nand extension, for example, seem intrinsically related.\nThis streamlined historical view is combined with the \u2018grain\nargument\u2019, which encapsulates the reasoning that led to the\ndenial that physical objects are really colored.  This argument poses\na challenge to materialism by purporting to show that the proper\nsensibles cannot be reduced to properties or relations of more basic\nphysical particles that lack these properties. \nBefore considering the grain argument per se, however, we\nneed to look at Sellars\u2019s phenomenology of perceptual and\nimaginative experience.  Sellars carefully distinguishes between\npropositional seeing and objectual seeing, and between seeing an\nobject and what we see of the object.  All perceptual\nexperience, in his view, has conceptual content, which shows up\nin the propositional content of a seeing or in what we see an\nobject as.  But he is also firmly convinced that not everything\nin perception is present as conceptual content, as something thought\nof or believed in.  \u201cWe see not only\nthat the ice cube is pink, and see it as pink, we\nsee the very pinkness of the object; also its very shape\n\u2014 though from a certain point of view\u201d (SSOP \u00a725:\n88). What we see of the ice cube is present to us in a\ndifferent way from that in which the (merely) conceptual content of\nour experience is present to us. What is needed is:\nan analysis of the sense in which we see of the pink ice\ncube its very pinkness.  Here, I believe, sheer phenomenology or\nconceptual analysis takes us part of the way, but finally lets\nus down. How far does it take us? Only to the point of assuring us\nthat\n\nSomething, somehow a cube of pink in physical space\nis present in the perception other than as merely believed in\n(SSOP \u00a726: 89).\nSellars takes it that this claim states a structural feature of the\nmanifest image.  It is, note, incompatible with views that reject the idea that\nthere is a nonconceptual component in perception\u2014which Sellars\nwould think are confused about the place of sensible qualities in the\nmanifest image.  The real challenge is filling in the placeholders in\nthe above claim: what kind of thing that is in what kind of way a cube\nof pink in physical space is present in one\u2019s perception, and\nhow can it be present in a way other than as believed in?  \nThe grain argument is meant to cut off reductive replies to these\nquestions.  Sellars\u2019s commentators have often taken it to be a\nvery complex and obscure argument, but Sellars seems to think it is\nfairly straightforward.  The grain argument works only against\nattempts to reduce sensory phenomena to more basic\natomistic/mechanistic entities.  If the world does not have an\nultimate \u2018grain,\u2019 then the argument won\u2019t apply.\nThe notion of a reduction must also be specified, for it is\nnotoriously multivalent.  Sellars\u2019s notion of reduction is\nfairly straightforward:\nif an object is in a strict sense a system of objects,\nthen every property of the object must consist in the fact that its\nconstituents have such and such qualities and stand in such and such\nrelations or, roughly,\n\nevery property of a system of objects consists of\nproperties of, and relations between, its constituents (PSIM in SPR:\n27).\nBut the proper sensibles are not reducible in this way to the\nproperties and relations of micro-objects.\nPink does not seem to be made up of imperceptible\nqualities in the way in which being a ladder is made up of being\ncylindrical (the rungs), rectangular (the frame), wooden, etc. The\nmanifest ice cube presents itself to us as something which is pink\nthrough and through, as a pink continuum, all the regions of which,\nhowever small, are pink. It presents itself to us as ultimately\nhomogeneous; and an ice cube variegated in colour is, though not\nhomogeneous in its specific colour, \u2018ultimately\nhomogeneous\u2019, in the sense to which I am calling attention, with\nrespect to the generic trait of being coloured (PSIM in SPR:\n26).\nIn a world that science teaches us is a blooming, buzzing confusion\nof unobservable submicroscopic entities, there seems to be no room for\nthe smoothly homogeneous, either \u2018out there\u2019 or \u2018in\nthe head.\u2019 The dense, continuous, homogeneously colored objects\nof the manifest image are appearances of systems of\nimperceptible particles.  Sense impressions are posited to explain how\nsystems of particles appear the way they do; they cannot themselves\nturn out to be another kind of system of particles, or the explanation\nfails.\nIf this argument is right, then the postulation of sense\nimpressions must differ in some important ways from the kind of\ntheoretical postulation that typically results in a belief in new\nmicroentities.  And this is what Sellars argues.\n[T]he theory of sense impressions does\nnot introduce, for example, cubical volumes of pink. It\nreinterprets the categorial status of the cubical volumes of\npink of which we are perceptually aware. Conceived in the manifest\nimage as, in standard cases, constituents of physical objects\nand in abnormal cases, as somehow \u2018unreal\u2019 or\n\u2018illusory\u2019, they are recategorized as sensory\nstates of the perceiver and assigned various explanatory roles in the\ntheory of perception\u2026 .  47. The pinkness of a pink\nsensation is \u2018analogous\u2019 to the pinkness of a manifest\npink ice cube, not by being a different quality which is in\nsome respect analogous to pinkness (as the quality a Martian\nexperiences in certain magnetic fields might be analogous to pink with\nrespect to its place in a quality space), but by being the same\n\u2018content\u2019 in a different categorical \u2018form\u2019\n(FMPP III: 73).\nSellars holds, then, that the logical space of the sensible\nqualities has been successively recategorized in different stages of\nhuman development.  He proposes that this history will take one more\nturn as science develops further: unable to reduce or eliminate the\nsensibles, science will postulate a distinctive set of\nentities, sensa, to be the final embodiment of the sensible\nqualities, physical1 but not physical2.  Sellars\nis a physicalist about color, not because he thinks colors can be\nreduced to more basic properties and relations of physical objects,\nbut because physics will have to expand to accommodate the sensible\nqualities, color included, as primitive entities.  \nThere are still further twists and turns in Sellars\u2019s\ntreatment of the sensory.  (See Rosenberg (1982) and deVries (2005),\nChapter 8, for more exploration of this issue.) \n6. Science and Reality\nSellars was a significant philosopher of science and a staunch\ndefender of scientific realism.  He often couched his discussions in\nthe terms made common by the logical empiricists, but he was in many\nways a subversive philosopher of science, undermining the irenic\ninstrumentalism popular in the 1950s  and \u201860s (e.g., the views defended by Ernest Nagel)in favor of a\nposition that might seem oxymoronic: a pragmatic realism.  \nWe can start with the distinction between observational\nand theoretical vocabularies.  Many empiricists were\nwedded to the myth of the given, assuming that there is a privileged\nobservation vocabulary.  The meanings of observation terms were\ndetermined by their relation to what is given and were thus\nunrevisable or incorrigible.  This vocabulary grounds the meaning of\nall empirical language.  Two kinds of generalizations were recognized:\n(1) empirical generalizations formulated in the observation language\nand justified by straightforward inductive methods, and (2)\nhigher-level generalizations formulated in a more abstract,\ntheoretical idiom including novel theoretical posits.  This\ntheoretical language consists of terms invented in order to better\norganize, generalize, and make connections among the assertions and\ngeneralizations made in the observation language.  The ideal would be\na formal axiomatic structure that would allow a deduction of the\nempirical generalizations which, combined with statements of initial\nconditions, permit a deduction of particular empirical facts (thus\nexplaining their truth). \nThe observational/theoretical vocabulary distinction, thus\nconceived, was taken to have ontological implications.  We are\ncommitted to the existence of the given, for that is what ties thought\nto reality.  Theories, however, are merely tools to enable us to\nexplain observation-level empirical generalizations.  Presumably, some\nempirical generalizations may be first derived with the help of a\ntheory, but they are subject to more direct investigation and\ncorroboration, so the theory is not essential to it.  Thus,\nthere is no ontological commitment to any entities that theories\npostulate; they can be viewed as convenient fictions, devices of\ncalculation. \nSellars thinks that this instrumentalist picture gets almost\neverything wrong.  In his view the observation vocabulary/theoretical\nvocabulary distinction is merely methodological and is, moreover,\nhighly malleable; it therefore possesses no particular ontological\nforce.  There is no given, so it can play no semantic role.  Meanings\nare functional roles in language usage, and nothing in principle\nprevents a term that might originally have arisen as part of a theory\nfrom acquiring a role in observation reports.  The well-trained\nphysicist \u201cjust sees\u201d an alpha-particle track in a cloud\nchamber as directly and non-inferentially as the well-trained child\njust sees a dog.  Furthermore, what is observable depends on the\ntechniques and instruments employed, and these are often loaded with\ntheoretical baggage.  \u201cPure\u201d observation uncontaminated by\ntheory is outside our reach.  A good theory, according to Sellars,\ndoes not just explain the observation-level empirical generalizations,\nit also explains why those empirical generalizations are as good (and\nas wrong) as they are.  The Boyle-Charles ideal gas law works well in\nmost conditions, but does not predict the behavior of gasses under\nextreme temperatures or pressures.  The van der Waals equation,\nexplicitly formulated with the theory of statistical thermodynamics in\nmind, allows us to see why the Boyle-Charles law is as good as it is\nand why it breaks down where it does.  Sellars therefore rejects the\n\u201clayer-cake\u201d view that there are three distinct levels of\nassertion in the empirical sciences: observation level claims of\nparticular fact, empirical generalizations using the observation\nvocabulary, and, finally, claims using a theoretical vocabulary which\nfunction to systematize the empirical generalizations.  In the\n\u201clayer-cake\u201d view, theories are ultimately dispensable in\nfavor of observation-level empirical generalizations; in\nSellars\u2019s view, it is the observation-level empirical\ngeneralizations that are ultimately dispensable in favor of the better\nexplanations made available by theory.  Thus, to have good reason to\naccept a theory is to have good reason to believe in the existence of\nthose entities it postulates.\nThis is the basic reasoning behind Sellars\u2019s scientific\nrealism.  His bold claim, \u201cIn the dimension of describing\nand explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of\nwhat is that it is, and of what is not that it is not\u201d (EPM:\n\u00a741, in SPR: 173; in KMG: 253) needs proper\ninterpretation, as mentioned above.  Sellars does not believe, for instance, that\ndescribing and explaining are the only \u201cdimensions\u201d of\nlinguistic activity.  Prescribing, evaluating, and negotiating are\nequally indispensable dimensions of language use that go beyond the descriptive brief of science.  It is science\u2019s job to limn the structure of\nempirical reality, the causal nexus within which we live, but, as his\nown call for a \u201csynoptic vision\u201d that unites a\nscience-generated picture of empirical reality with \u201cthe\nlanguage of community and individual intentions\u201d indicates,\nSellars would never hold that all our questions are to be settled by\nscientific investigations. \nSellars also has a distinctive treatment of scientific laws.  Laws\nare standardly treated as generalizations; they are distinguished\nfrom accidental generalizations because laws have a modal force\ncapable of supporting counterfactuals.  In Sellars\u2019s view, laws\nare better understood as inference tickets.  Though they have\ndescriptive content, statements of laws serve a different function in\nour language.  As mentioned above, Sellars treats modals uniformly as\nmaterial-mode metalinguistic speech expressing the inferential\ncommitments and priorities embedded in the language.  So, saying that\nit is a law of nature that e.g., the angle of incidence equals the\nangle of reflection, endorses a certain set of inferences using those\nconcepts.  Furthermore, Sellars does not think of language as a fixed\nentity.  Indeed, in his conception, the job of the sciences is to\nmethodically revise and replace the resources available for\ndescription and explanation.  Conceptual change is the very essence of\nscience.  In his view, laws of nature are proposed connections among\nconcepts or terms that, pending possible empirical disconfirmation,\ncan be rationally attached to the concepts.\n[S]cientific terms have, as part of their logic a\n\u2018line of retreat\u2019 as well as a \u2018plan of\nadvance\u2019 \u2014 a fact which makes meaningful the claim that in\nan important sense A and B are the \u2018same\u2019 properties they\nwere \u2018before.\u2019 \u2026 The motto of the age of science\nmight well be: natural philosophers have hitherto sought to understand\n\u2018meanings\u2019; the task is to change them (CDCM:\n288).\nThus, I call his philosophy of science a \u2018pragmatic\nrealism\u2019 because he insists on our commitment to the reality of\nthe objects to be posited by Peircean ideal science, while\nexplicating most of the structural features of science in terms\nof the pragmatic force of their linguistic expression.  \n7.  Practical Reason:  Intentions, Rules, and Normativity\n7.1 The Logic of Intentions\nEpistemology tries to make intelligible the acquisition, growth,\nand change of belief.  It thus tends to focus on the input to and\ninternal interactions of our cognitive states.  Action theory, in\ncontrast, focuses on the output side, accounting for the\nintelligibility of action.  Sellars has a sophisticated and systematic\napproach to action theory, metaethics, and normativity that has not been widely\nappreciated. \nThe central problem is understanding the relation between belief and action.  Normative judgments, e.g., judgments about what\u2019s good or what\u2019s right, are supposed to bridge the apparent gap between what one believes is the case and what one does to transform the world.  Normative judgments thus need to interface smoothly with our beliefs, because we often seem to reason to our normative judgments and use them in reasoning further to our decisions to act. They must also, however, motivate action in a way that mere belief cannot.  In mid-20th century philosophy, cognitivists emphasized practical reasoning, while non-cognitivists focused rather on the practical, that is, the motivational aspect of norms. According to the cognitivists, normative and especially ethical claims are truth-evaluable and participate in the same kinds of logical relations as other truth-evaluable claims.  Cognitivists were thus in a position to attack the problem of how ethical and other normative claims function in our practical reasoning, but they had difficulty saying how normative beliefs are any more deeply connected to action than other beliefs.  Non-cognitivists, in contrast, denied that ethical and normative claims are, in general, truth-evaluable.  Their role, instead, is to motivate, either encouraging or discouraging particular actions.  That role does not require truth-evaluability.  One of Sellars\u2019 teachers was C. L. Stevenson, who proposed that ethical judgments are actually expressions of pro or con attitudes towards actions, a position that came to be known as emotivism.  Sellars also paid close attention to the metaethics of R. M. Hare, who proposed that normative statements be analyzed as imperatives, commanding or forbidding an action. But Sellars believed that there is no logic of imperatives, so Hare\u2019s analysis could not capture the role norms play in our practical reasoning.  \nInstead, Sellars proposes an analysis of norms in which the central role is played by the notion of an intention.  An\nintention is a thought that motivates one to realize its content.\n\u2018I shall eat a light dinner later\u2019 can be a mere\nprediction (suppose, e.g., that I know my cupboards are bare), but it\ncan also express my intention, in which case it has motivational force\nwithin my behavioral control system.  A volition is an intention that\nhas come to fruition: it has an intentional content but also causally affects my behavior: \u2018I shall eat a light\ndinner now\u2019 expresses my volition and is usually\naccompanied by at least the first stirrings of activity. \nExpressing an intention or volition is not the same as\n(self-)ascribing, an intention or volition, nor are such expressions\ndescriptions of intentions or predictions of action.  Expressions of\nintention are always first-personal in form and essentially tied to\nmotivational force.  Sellars reserves \u2018shall\u2019 to serve as\nan operator-like marker of intention expressions, and this convention\nwill be observed here as well.  Sellars recognizes two forms of\n\u2018shall\u2019-statements: \u2018I shall do A\u2019 and\n\u2018It shall be the case that p\u2019.  \u2018Shall\nbe\u2019s\u2019 must ultimately imply \u2018shall\u2019s with\ndirect implications for action, even if they are highly conditioned on\nother circumstances. \nSellars wrote extensively on the logic of intentions, for \u201cAn\nideally rational being would intend the implications of his\nintentions, just as he would believe the implications of his\nbeliefs\u201d (SM VII \u00a716: 183). The major principle governing intentions is \nPLI: \u2018Shall (A)\u2019 implies \u2018Shall\n(B)\u2019 iff \u2018A\u2019 implies\n\u2018B\u2019.\nThis principle, note, is in the metalanguage in which we talk about intentions, not in the object language in which we express intentions. Sellars also stipulates that logical connectives and operators can\noccur inside the scope of a \u2018shall\u2019 operator, but not\noutside it.  This is because \u2018shall\u2019 statements are\nconstrued as expressions of intentions.  \nShall [I will not do A]\nexpresses a negative intention \u2014 the intention to refrain\nfrom doing A.  But there is no expression of the lack of an\nintention to do A, so\nNot shall [I will do A] \nis ruled out as nonsensical, though, of course, one\ncan describe oneself as lacking the intention to do A.  A\ndescription of an intention, however, is different from an expression\nof it. For Sellars, \u201cThe implications pertaining to matters of fact concern only the content of intentions and not their status as intentions\u201d (ORAV \u00b652: 86), so the practical reasoning involving intentions must focus on the content of those intentions.  \nSellars invokes a principle that governs how the facts of the world\nare to be taken up into our practical reasoning.  He calls it\n\u201cSo-be-it\u201d:\nSo-be-it: \u201cShall be [\u03c6]\u201d and\n\u201cp\u201d imply \u201cShall be [\u03c6\nand p]\u201d where \u2018\u03c6\u2019 is a formula which may\nor may not be logically complex (ORAV \u00b666: 88).\nSellars needs a principle like this, since logical connectives (by his stipulation) cannot show up outside the scope of a \u2018shall,\u2019 implications can be drawn only within the scope of a \u2018shall,\u2019 so practical reasoning is viewed in terms of the compounding and simplification of the contents of one\u2019s intentions. \nTo use \u201cSo-be-it\u201d properly, one must be able to\ndistinguish between what is \u201cup to one\u201d, symbolized by \u2018[\u03c6]\u2019, and what is not, captured in the symbolism by \u2018p\u2019.\nA fairly straightforward picture of practical reasoning emerges.\n\n94. Thus C[onjunction] I[ntroduction] together with\nSo-be-it, takes our separate purposes and relevant beliefs and puts\nthem together into encompassing alternatives:\n\nShall be [I do A at t, which means that \u2026]?\nShall be [I do B at t, which means that \u2026]?\nShall be [I do C at t, which means that \u2026]?\n\nThe successive steps are\n\nelaboration by CI and So-be-it, and the drawing of\nimplications\nchoice, e.g. (2), or, continuing indecision\nsimplification. Shall be [I do B at t]\nintention to act. Shall [I do B at t]\n\nwhich, when time t comes (and I do not change my mind), generates\na doing (or an attempt to do) B.\n95. This picture is one according to which practical reasoning is\nessentially the process of elaborating alternative scenarios for a\nchoice (ORAV \u00b694: 91).\n\nClearly, the elaboration of alternatives is a rational process.  Is\nmaking the ultimate choice among these alternatives also a matter of\nreason?  In what sense is the choice among fully elaborated\nalternatives anything other than an arbitrary, personal choice?  For\nanswers, we need to look at Sellars\u2019s views on the nature of\noughts and the normativity they express.\n7.2 Oughts\nSellars\u2019s unified treatment of the modalities as material\nmode expressions of our inferential endorsements and commitments has\nbeen mentioned above.  It applies to the deontic modalities as well:\nthey signal the endorsement of certain practical inferences and\nprinciples.  We can see this clearly in his treatment of hypothetical\noughts.  An important fact about statements of the form\nIf X wants A, he ought to do B\nis that they do not permit what we might call unconditional\ndetachment.  Suppose\nIf Harry wants his inheritance now, he ought to kill his\nfather\nand suppose\nHarry wants his inheritance now.\nWe do not draw the unalloyed conclusion\nHarry ought to kill his father.\nThe reasonableness of killing his father remains strictly relative\nto Harry\u2019s desire and does not achieve the objective status\nsignaled by unconditional detachment. The choices we make are,\neffectively, always of encompassing alternatives, but the\nconsiderations we bring to bear on those choices are always only\npartial.\n\n[A]lthough the \u2018ought\u2019 of\nIf X wants A, he ought to\ndo B\nlooks as though it concerned the propriety of doing B on a\ncertain hypothesis, it actually concerns the logical propriety or\nimpropriety of certain complex valuings.  To offer advice of the\nform\nIf you want A you ought to do B\nis not to offer substantive advice as does\nYou ought to do X\nIt is to give logical advice (OMP: 8).\n\nTo give substantive advice, to be able to detach the\n\u2018ought\u2019 statement, we need to eliminate the subjectivity\nof the condition in the hypothetical; we need at least something that\nwould make a coherent all-things-considered option.  For a\nmoral ought, we would seek a categorically reasonable\nintention, one that would be reasonable for anyone and everyone to\nhave.  \nSellars approaches the search for a categorically reasonable\nintention in several steps.  A hypothetical intention that is at least\nuniversal in content takes an important step towards an\n\u2018ought\u2019 that we can count as objectively moral.  Sellars\nasserts that \u201cthe hypothetical imperative which comes closest to\ncapturing the moral point of view is that of impartial\nbenevolence\u201d (SM VII \u00a7100: 212).  Such an intention\nduplicates the universality of content that he thinks\nfull-fledged moral \u2018oughts\u2019 must have, but it still lacks\nthe universality in form a moral \u2018ought\u2019 needs,\nbecause it depends on the possession of a particular desire (impartial\nbenevolence) on the part of the agents. Intending impartial benevolence lacks universal form to the extent that such an intention remains the subjective possession of separate individuals who may have parallel intentions without yet having a shared intention.  \nIn order to make intelligible such universality in form, Sellars\nintroduces the notion of a we-intention, an intention that is not the merely\nsubjective possession of an individual, but an intention had as a member of\na group that constitutes us.  There can be things I intend, as\none of us, that I do not (or would not) intend, speaking on my\nown behalf.  For instance, I might intend, as a citizen of the U.S.,\nthat the representatives duly elected in the last election take\noffice, even though, speaking for myself, I am horrified at the\nprospect.  Sellars thus suggests that the we-intention\nIt shallwe be the case that our welfare is\nmaximized\nconstitutes a categorically reasonable intention.  This intention\ndoes seem to have an authority which is more than a mere\nmatter of its being generally accepted. It is a conceptual fact that\npeople constitute a community, a we, by virtue of thinking of each\nother as one of us, and by willing the common good not under the\nspecies of benevolence \u2014 but by willing it as one of us, or from\na moral point of view (SM VII \u00a7132: 222).\nThis is Sellars\u2019s reconstruction of the basic logic of moral\njudgments.  What remains is to construct an argument demonstrating the\nreality of the moral community, that there really is an appropriate\n\u2018we\u2019 to invoke.  Sellars thinks this could be done if the\nfollowing claims can be justified (SM VII \u00a7144: 225):\n\nTo think of oneself as rational being is (implicitly)\nto think of oneself as subject to epistemic oughts binding on rational\nbeings generally.\nThe intersubjective intention to promote epistemic welfare\nimplies the intersubjective intention to promote welfare sans\nphrase.\n\nWhile he thinks the first is plausible, Sellars does not claim to\nhave an argument for the second, so the question of the reality of the\nmoral community remains problematic. For further examination of Sellars\u2019 ethics and an argument that the moral community is real enough, see Koons (2019).\n7.3 Rules and Normativity\nWe can see from his reconstruction of moral judgment that Sellars\nthinks that things like normativity and rules exist only in a social\ncontext, for real \u2018oughts\u2019 require a community.  The\nconcept of a rule plays a central role in Sellars\u2019s philosophy,\nfor he thinks of both languages and well-ordered societies as\nrule-governed systems.  Rules, he thinks, are distinctively human.  \nTo say that man is a rational animal, is to say that man\nis a creature not of habits, but of rules. When God\ncreated Adam, he whispered in his ear, \u201cIn all contexts of\naction you will recognize rules, if only the rule to grope for rules\nto recognize.  When you cease to recognize rules, you will walk on\nfour feet.\u201d (LRB \u00a716, in PPPW: 138)\nThe language of individual and community intentions that Sellars\nclaims must be preserved in the Peircean scientific millennium is the\nlanguage that enables us to make sense of rules.  Sellars has\ninteresting things to say about rules, so this overview finishes with\na look at this significant aspect of his work.\nRule-governed behavior exhibits a pattern, but it contrasts with\nhabitual behavior, which also exhibits patterns.  Here Sellars is\nworried particularly about linguistic behavior, but the points apply\ngenerally:\nThe key to the concept of a linguistic rule is its complex\nrelation to pattern-governed linguistic behavior. The general concept\nof pattern governed behavior is a familiar one. Roughly it is the\nconcept of behavior which exhibits a pattern, not because it is\nbrought about by the intention that it exhibit this pattern, but\nbecause the propensity to emit behavior of the pattern has been\nselectively reinforced, and the propensity to emit behavior which does\nnot conform to this pattern selectively extinguished. (MFC:\n423)\nPattern-governed behavior is present wherever there is learning,\nbut that includes learning bad habits.  Some pattern-governed\nbehavior, however, exists because of rules.  \n\n\nIf patterned governed behavior can arise by \u201cnatural\u201d\nselection, it can also arise by purposive selection on the part of\ntrainers. They can be construed as reasoning.\n\nPattern-behavior of such and such a kind ought to be\nexhibited by trainees, hence we, the trainers, ought to do this and\nthat, as likely to bring it about that it is exhibited (MFC:\n423).\n\nSellars distinguishes two different kinds of \n\u2018oughts\u2019 or rules. There are\nought-to-dos, aka rules of action.  The basic form of such a\nrule is a conditional imperative: \u201cIf in circumstances C, do\nA!\u201d This is the kind of rule involved in what I\ncall paradigmatic rule-obeying.  Paradigmatic rule-obedience requires\ncomplex cognitive and conative capacities on the part of the agent:\nknowledge of the rule, recognition of the circumstances as appropriate\nto the application of the rule, and conative structures that motivate\none to apply the rule and act on it.  Sellars denies\nthat all rule-governed behaviors, behaviors that occur because of the\nrules are cases of paradigmatic rule-obedience.  \nSellars\u2019s other \u2018ought\u2019 is\nthe ought-to-be, aka rules of criticism.  For example, it ought\nto be the case that dogs come when their masters call.  Such a rule\nspeaks to no agent in particular, and it is certainly not a rule that\ndogs obey in the paradigmatic sense.  It simply endorses a\nparticular state of affairs without regard for any mode of achieving\nit.  Still, dogs can exhibit a pattern of behavior that accords with\nthe rule, and they can do so because of the rule, if their\nmasters train them to come when called because the masters have\nreasoned along the following lines:\nIt ought to be the case that dogs come when their masters\ncall.  Therefore, it ought to be the case that my dog comes when\nI call.  My dog will come when called only if I train it to do\nso.  Therefore, I ought to train my dog to come when\ncalled.\nThis reasoning moves from an ought-to-be to a relevant ought-to-do\nand comes to full fruition not in a belief about one\u2019s\nobligations, but in a set of actions that result in one\u2019s dog\nlearning to come when called.  Ought-to-be\u2019s imply\nought-to-do\u2019s; and ought-to-do\u2019s typically lead to\naction.\nThis last point is crucial.  According to Sellars, rules of\ncriticism (ought-to-be\u2019s) have no way of being realized in the\nworld (other than merely accidentally) except insofar as there\nare agents who recognize them, infer rules of action from them\nand thereupon undertake the requisite actions.  Unless there are\nagents cognizant of and acting on some rules of action, talk\nof any rules, including the apparently less committal rules of\ncriticism, turns out to be empty.  We are rule-governed creatures\nbecause we conceive of ourselves as rule-governed creatures.  And, as\nlong as we do conceive of ourselves as governed by rules and train\nourselves and our progeny to recognize and live in accordance with\nrules, it is true that we are rule-governed creatures. By taking ourselves to be persons, agents acting for reasons in accordance with rules, we make ourselves persons. \n8. The Stereoscopic Vision\nSellars thinks that science\u2019s aperspectival description of\nthe empirical world is the measure of reality, but he is also\ncommitted to the indispensability of the concepts built into the\nfirst-person perspective that makes agency possible.  If those\nconcepts were not involved in the regulation of our behavior, we would\nnot be persons and could not engage in such activities as moral\nbehavior or scientific research.  This is why Sellars calls for\na stereoscopic vision in which the descriptive resources of the\nsciences are united with the language of individual and community\nintentions and the dualism of the manifest and scientific images is\ntranscended.  \nSellars possessed a broad vision, but did not shy away from detail\nwork.  He was a \u201cphilosopher\u2019s philosopher;\u201d his\nessays are complex and difficult pieces, challenging but rewarding to\nmaster.  Beginning in 1994 with Sellars-inspired publications by his erstwhile colleagues John\nMcDowell and Robert B. Brandom, interest in Sellars\u2019 work has increased steadily, both in the U. S. and abroad.  Publications and conferences focused on or inspired by Sellars are now common.  In\n2015, for instance, significant conferences devoted to Sellars were\nheld in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.  The literature on Sellars has grown appreciably since the last revision of this article.  Sellars\u2019s\nphilosophy is rich enough to provide a framework within which\notherwise distinct philosophical tendencies can find sufficient common\nground to engage each other fruitfully.  Sellars\nstudies has been dominated by a clash between the \u201cright-wing\nSellarsians\u201d (e.g., Patricia and Paul Churchland, Ruth Millikan, Jay\nRosenberg), who emphasize Sellars\u2019s scientific realism and\nnominalism, and the \u201cleft-wing Sellarsians\u201d (e.g., Rorty,\nMcDowell, and Brandom), who emphasize instead Sellars\u2019s\ninsistence on the irreducibility and sociality of rules and norms. Sellars\u2019s expressivism has garnered increasing attention in both camps. Lately, a younger generation has begun constructing a finer-grained story of Sellars\u2019s development.  This will likely enable a better articulation of the structure of Sellars\u2019s philosophy and, perhaps, a new sense of its potential.\n",
