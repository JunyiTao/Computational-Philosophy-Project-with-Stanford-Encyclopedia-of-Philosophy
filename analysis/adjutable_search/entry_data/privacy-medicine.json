As a general rule, they\nstrive to (1) restrict and secure what they deem to be sensitive\nmedical information and biospecimens, (2) respect medically-related\ndecisions by individuals and families and (3) honor community and\nlegal expectations of privacy (Francis 2017; Winslade 2014). For more\nthan fifty years, philosophers and bioethicists have taken a keen\ninterest in privacy issues. They have contributed to an expanding\nliterature, some with practical applications, consisting of diverse\nperspectives on how privacy concepts and values are implicated in\npatient care and biomedical research (Presidential Commission\n2012).\n\nThe scope of this entry is \u201cprivacy\u201d in the several varied\nand popular uses of the term employed in medicine and health research,\nincluding the controversial uses debated by philosophers. Most\ncontemporary discussions of privacy and medicine concern the\ninformational privacy of patients and research subjects, treated in\nSection 1, below. Medical record confidentiality is a frequent focus.\nThis emphasis is neither surprising nor inappropriate given the\nproblems, priorities and preoccupations of the digital age. Not to be\noverlooked, and covered here in Sections 2 and 5, philosophic\ndiscussion has extended beyond informational privacy, engaging the\nprivacy implications of observing, touching and choosing for oneself\nin medical practice. These forms of privacy are sometimes referred to\nas physical and decisional privacy. Associational and proprietary\nconcepts of privacy found in health-related dicussions and recognized\nby some philosophers are also briefly treated in below in Sections 3\nand 4. \n\nThis entry principally deals with the professional work of physicians,\nnurses and other trained and licensed medical caregivers, along with\nhospitals, insurance companies and researchers. Privacy in relation to\nwellness and well-being are beyond the scope of this entry, except to\nthe considerable extent that it prompts encounters with medical\nprofessionals and organizations.  Wellness encounters with spiritual,\nfitness or non-medical beauty professionals are not\ndiscussed. Finally, while the privacy of patients and biomedical\nresearch subjects is the focus of this entry, philosophical questions\nconcerning health professionals\u2019 own privacy-related interests\nimplicated in medical practice are recognized.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Informational Privacy\n\nThis section will highlight philosophical issues relating to\ninformational privacy and medicine. In medical contexts, the\n\u201cprivacy\u201d at issue is very often\n\u201cconfidentiality\u201d (DeCew 2000). Health care professionals\nacknowledge ethical duties to keep medical information private (APA\n2017; AAMFT 2015). Physicians, nurses, hospitals, pharmacists, and\ninsurers are required by law and professional codes to practice\nconfidentiality. Since the 1990s, in policy discussions of health\npolicy and reform, concerns about confidentiality have often been\nprominent (Sharpe 2005; Schwartz 1995). Confidentiality practices\nremain salient in medical settings, even as members of the general\npublic display more relaxed attitudes about voluntarily sharing health\nand medical information. \n\nA few preliminary points about informational privacy and medicine bear\nemphasis at the start\u2014one about public attitudes, a second about\nprofessional responsibility, a third about law and policy, and a\nfourth about the significance of disparities and big data analytics to\nmeaningful medical privacy.\n\nFirst, while information-sharing has grown more common in recent\ndecades\u2014due, inter alia, to social media, big data,\nprecision medicine, and increased infectious disease, new drug\nmarketing and other health surveillance\u2014individuals commonly\nkeep some health concerns to themselves, whether out of personal\npreference, ethical reserve, etiquette, fear or shame (Allen 2016;\nRosenberg 2000; Buss 1980; Westin 1967). When they share what they\nconsider sensitive health concerns with others, most individuals\nemploy culturally appropriate discretion and reserve (Nissenbaum 2009;\nGoffman 1959, 1963). Because of such privacy practices, families,\nfriends, employers, employees, co-workers, doctors, researchers and\ngovernments may not acquire all the medical information they want,\nwhen they want it (Currie 2005; Etzioni 2000). At the same time,\nindividuals who want medical privacy may feel they lack meaningful\ncontrol over what happens to their personal information. The rise of\nsocial media, smart phones, wearable health monitoring devices,\npersonal possession of electronic copies of medical records, consumer\nDNA testing and precision medicine represent diverse opportunities for\nintended and unintended disclosures of health-related images and\ninformation. The practical ability of individuals to control and\nprotect their health privacy is partly a function of effective data\nsecurity, their knowledge of contemporary medical data management\npractices and social-economic privileges (Bridges 2017; Marx 2007).\nChildren, along with adults in active military service, judged\nmentally incompetent, dependent on government entitlement programs or\nincarcerated, lack substantial control over their medical privacy\n(Annas et al. 2013). In the context of medical emergencies, infections\ndiseases and epidemics, competent adult civilians not in custody may\nbe denied the choice to keep their medical information private. \n\nSecond, many medical professionals, hospitals, insurers and other\nentities with access to health information regard maintaining the\nconfidentiality of medical communications and the security of medical\ninformation as paramount professional responsibilities (Daly et al.,\n2015; Presidential Commission 2016). This sensibility extends to\nsocial work, mental health and pharmacy records. Moreover, clinical\nhealth care providers and bio-medical researchers generally seek to\naccommodate patients\u2019 reasonable expectations of privacy and are\nrequired to do so by state and national laws (Allen 2011; Presidential\nCommission 2009). That said, encouraging patients to embrace sharing\nhealth information to improve research, clinical practices and their\nown care is an emergent trend (Juengst et al. 2016).\n\nThird, societies impose major privacy and private choice-related legal\nobligations on their members (Waldman 2018; Allen 2016; Westin 1967).\nLegal obligations of privacy and confidentiality bind persons and also\nbind health care providers, insurers, health-data processors, health\nresearchers, public health officials and government (Mello at al.\n2016; DHHS 2015; GAO 2001). Thus in a number of legal systems,\ndisclosing a private medical fact or breaching medical confidentiality\ncan result in civil liability (Allen and Rotenberg 2016; Solove 2004,\n2008). The law imposes obligations to respect informational privacy\n(e.g., confidentiality, anonymity, secrecy and data security);\nphysical privacy (e.g., modesty and bodily integrity); associational\nprivacy (e.g., intimate sharing of death, illness and recovery);\nproprietary privacy (e.g., self ownership and control over personal\nidentifiers, genetic data, and biospecimens); and decisional privacy\n(e.g., autonomy and choice in medical decision-making) (Allen 2016).\nYet privacy is not everything in the eyes of the law, nor is it a\nsufficient or absolute ethical good (Allen 2003). In the context of\nemergencies and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 global\npandemic, symptom checking, disclosures, surveillance and contact\ntracing that diminish privacy may be encouraged and legally permitted\nor mandated. The desire of health officials and researchers for health\ndata concerning chronic health problems, such as diabetes, hepatitis\nand drug addiction, has prompted them to seek or legally obtain\notherwise confidential health records.\n\nFourth, the traditional emphasis in academic and policy discussions of\nprivacy on informed consent and choice grounded in individual freedom,\ncan neglect the ways in which health disparities and societies\u2019\nstructural injustices contribute to poor health, constrain choice and\nreduce opportunity (Skinner-Thompson, 2021; Obasagie and Darnovsky\n2018; Shepherd and Wilson 2018; Bridges 2017). Moreover, the rise of\nbig data and artificial intelligence in the digital economy have made\nit increasingly difficult for any individual to exercise meaningful\ncontrol over the collection, manipulation and use of medically-related\nand other personal information about them (Kasperbauer 2020; Velez,\n2020; Allen 2016; Cato et al. 2016; van der Sloot 2017).\n1.1 Confidentiality\n\n\u201cPrivacy\u201d in medicine often denotes the confidentiality of\npatient-provider encounters (including the very fact that an encounter\nhas taken place), along with the secrecy and security of information\nmemorialized in physical, digital, electronic and graphic records\ncreated as a consequence of patient-provider encounters (DeCew 2000;\nParent 1983). Confidentiality is defined as restricting information to\npersons belonging to a set of specifically authorized recipients\n(Allen 1997; Kenny 1982). Confidentiality can be achieved through\nprofessional silence and secure data management (Sharpe 2005; Baer et\nal. 2002). Hence Sissela Bok characterized confidentiality as\nreferring \u201cto the boundaries surrounding shared secrets and to\nthe process of guarding these boundaries\u201d (Bok 1982: 119). \n\nPhilosophers have suggested new ways of conceptualizing familiar\nprivacy and confidentiality issues, pushing the topic of privacy and\nmedicine into less traveled directions or novel frames. For example,\nit has been proposed that privacy and confidentiality in medical\npractice eschew the traditional imperative of individual patient\nautonomy in favor of a relational understanding that welcomes families\nand support networks into a confidential circle with patients and\ncaregivers (Mohapatra and Wiley 2020). It has been proposed that\ntraditional physician-patient confidentiality laws should be\nunderstood to impose potentially unwanted secrecy onto physicians, who\nbear burdens of silence they might prefer not to bear but are in\neffect coerced to bear by legal liability to do so (Allen, 2011). \n\nPhilosophers tend to agree that health is a vital component of human\nflourishing (Faden et al. 2013; Moore 2005; R\u00f6ssler 2004;\nRosenberg 2000; Schoeman 1984; Boone 1983). Maimonides maintained that\nbodily health is among the means and ends of a good life (Weiss 1991).\nModern philosophers generally hold that a just society will be\ncommitted to securing the material and political bases of public\nhealth (Powers and Faden 2008). Philosophers of medicine, ethicists\nand bioethicists tend to agree that, with a handful of exceptions,\nrespecting patient confidentiality benefits both individual and public\nhealth (Kamoie and Hodge 2004). They defend the practice of\nconfidentiality by diverse appeals to utility, dignity and virtue\n(Easter et al. 2004).\n\nBuilding on the 5th century BCE Hippocratic tradition of\nmedical caregiver secrecy, western philosophers defend confidentiality\non several utilitarian or other consequentialist grounds (Frey 2000;\nHare 1993; Freedman 1978). They argue that preventive medicine, early\ndiagnosis and treatment save human lives and money. Individuals will\nbe more inclined to get medical attention if they believe they can do\nso privately. Policy experts maintain that the cost of health care and\ninsurance would be considerably higher if people avoided routine\ncheck-ups and prompt medical attention because confidentiality was not\ncredibly promised (Fairchild et al. 2007a). Confidentiality practices\nare believed to promote both seeking care and frank disclosures of\nhealth concerns in the context of care. Symptoms of illness and\ndecline, such as incontinence, memory loss, or hallucinations can be\nembarrassing to talk about, even with sympathetic professional\nclinicians. In addition, promises of confidentiality can make persons\nmore willing to participate in health research (Presidential\nCommission 2012; Easter et al. 2004).\n\nMedical confidentiality promotes the individual\u2019s medical\nautonomy, by sheltering those seeking morally controversial medical\ncare from outside criticism and interference with decisions (Dworkin\net al. 2007; Englehardt 2000a; Feinberg 1983). Patients seeking\ncosmetic, abortion or fertility treatments might not wish others to\nknow their plans. Members of the general public have from time to time\nattempted to influence choices strangers make relating to the care of\ndisabled infants, comatose or brain dead kin, and abortions. Spouses,\npartners, parents and siblings have sought involvement, with arguably\ngreater moral warrant. H.J. McCloskey suggested that loving personal\nrelationships call for mutual accountability (McCloskey 1971). Of\ncourse some health problems\u2014morbid obesity, scoliosis,\npsoriasis, paralysis\u2014simply cannot be concealed from intimates.\nBioethicists, consistent with public health considerations and laws,\ncommonly argue that hidden contagious conditions or exposures should\nnot be concealed from vulnerable associates and in extreme cases could\njustify non-voluntary isolation or public health quarantine\n(Presidential Commission 2015a).\n\nPhilosophers have also offered deontological grounds for protecting\ninformational privacy (Pierce 2018; Benn 1988). Centuries of\nphilosophical thought depict human beings as vulnerable bodies and\nself-aware souls (Lackoff and Johnson 1999). Informational privacy\npromotes respect for human dignity, philosophers have said. Caregivers\ndisplay concern for moral persons with rational interests and feelings\nof their own when they keep information about their health and health\nneeds private (Freedman 1978).\n\nIndividuals concerned about discrimination, shame or stigma have an\ninterest in controlling the flow of information about their health,\nand arguably the moral right to do so. Mental and other behavioral\nhealth care consumers continue to face stigma and discrimination in a\nworld in which getting what they need requires a virtual surrender of\nconfidentiality to a bevy of other people, including family members,\ndoctors, social workers, teachers, hospitals, insurers, and law\nenforcement (APA 2002; AAMFT 2001; Dickson 1998).\n\nNotions of moral fairness play into arguments for confidentiality.\nConfidentiality is arguably required by fair relations with government\nand businesses (Workplace Fairness, 2009,\n Other Internet Resources).\n Since \u201cknowledge is power\u201d, special concerns have been\nraised about the manner in which government collects and manages\npersonal medical information. Pervasive ideals of fair information\npractices require that personal data collected about individuals be\nlimited, accurate, secure and disclosed to third-parties only with\nconsent. Some patients believe they own personal information about\nthemselves, and that is it only fair that they, not others, control\nits release (McGuire 2019). They may believe they own medical\ninformation because they have purchased medical services (Martin 1981:\n624\u201325). Or they may believe they own medical information,\nespecially genetic information, because it reveals information of a\nhighly personal and unique sort (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).\n\nPhilosophers have identified duties of welfare promotion, care,\ndignity and fairness to support the case for privacy and\nconfidentiality (Schoeman 1984). Virtue ethics suggests its own set of\ngrounds for informational privacy in health care (van der Sloot 2017).\nJennifer Radden has argued that the special vulnerability of mental\nhealth patients and the stigma attached to their problems turns\nconfidentiality into a particular brand of excellence for mental\nhealth care practitioners (Radden 2004). She has argued that the\ndemand for confidentiality in psychiatric medicine is inadequately\naccounted for on theories that fail to take into account the virtues\nof trust and reserve that are hallmarks of mental health care. Ari\nEzra Waldman has also defended trust as a critical virtue for\nunderstanding the normative grounds of informational privacies.\n(Waldman 2018)\n\nIn the context of health research, ethics committees and institutional\nreview boards impose ethical obligations on researchers to protect the\nconfidentiality of research subjects and their medical information\n(Fisher 2006; Hiatt 2003; IOM 2000). The obligation of confidentiality\nmay require the use of \u201cidentifiers\u201d rather than names or\n\u201cde-identification\u201d procedures such as data aggregation\n(Presidential Commission 2012). Researchers may need to publish\ngenomic data in ways calculated to obscure the identities of whole\nfamilies. Patient confidentiality can be compromised in the setting of\nmedical lectures and ground rounds, and in the publication and\narchiving of medical lectures, scholarly articles and personal papers.\nThe question of whether there are privacy concerns when only\nstatistical use is made of individuals\u2019 health data has arisen.\nIt has been argued that individuals have an interest in the uses to\nwhich data sets that include their data is put, even if they are not\npersonally identified by researchers (Newcombe 1994).\n\nPrivacy theorists caution that deprivation of privacy can amount to\nsubordination, injustice and inhumanity (Skinner-Thompson 2020; Gandy\n1993). Most privacy theorists focus on the harms that stem from\ninvading the privacy people value. Theorists have begun also to\nconsider the harms that stem from voluntary self-disclosure (Allen\n2011). Individuals freely disclose medical and other sensitive\ninformation about themselves. They do it in published memoirs, in\nsocial media postings and in forums devoted to illnesses, medical\nprocedures, prescription medications, and alternative medicine. Women\nhave webcast childbirth and mastectomy, citing public health education\ngoals (Allen 2000).\n\nPrivacy is not defended as an absolute good (Hixson 1987; Boone 1983;\nLouch 1982; Pennock and Chapman 1971; Negley 1966). Confidentiality,\nfor example, is seldom described as an absolute good in health care\n(Bok 1982). Philosophers justifiably recommend major exceptions to the\npractice of confidentiality. First, all health care providers and\nresponsible adults should be obligated to report evidence of abuse or\nneglect of minor children, such as unexplained fractures and\nmalnutrition, even if the privacy interests of the children and/or\ntheir abusers would seem to suggest otherwise (Dickson 1998). Failure\nof medical workers to promptly disclose can have deadly consequences\nfor vulnerable minors. While confidentiality decisions are left to\nindividuals or their guardians in most instances, minor children are a\ndefensible exception due to their undeveloped cognitive and moral\ncapacities and due to the possibility that their guardians are abusers\nwho would benefit from confidentiality. Second, enshrined in American\nlaw as the Tarasoff Rule, mental health providers have an ethical duty\nto warn police or potential victims of mentally ill patients\u2019\nviolent imminent intentions (Gates and Arons 1999). These two\nexceptions reflect a belief that avoiding physical injury to third\nparties is more important than invariably deferring to patients\u2019\npreferences, sparing their feelings and preserving their trust in\nrelationships. Important philosophical questions arise about the\nextent of \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d duties, whistle-blowing\nobligations and the duty to warn in health care settings. Ascribing\nsuch duties potentially infringes the liberty persons otherwise enjoy\nto act and refrain from acting as they see fit so long as they do not\naffirmatively harm others. Arguably the person who declines to help or\nwarn is not the responsible cause of the abuse and violence that\nbefalls others. Yet beneficence argues for low risk, low cost\ninterventions to prevent serious harm.\n\nThird, there may be situations in which medical confidentiality should\nnot be protected because the public has a right to know. One category\nof information which the public or public health officials are\ncommonly thought to have a right to know is information about\ninstances of highly infectious contagious diseases with high rates of\nmortality and morbidity, such as ebola, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis\nand measles. Another category of information deemed not suitable for\nconfidentiality is information the media has a right to publish as a\nmatter of its newsworthiness. Dramatic medical rescues of automobile\naccident victims are understandably newsworthy events. It has been\nargued that the public has a right to know about public\nofficials\u2019 serious medical problems, perhaps more than\nauthorities have typically disclosed (Robins and Rothschild 1988;\nThompson 1987). In the United States, plaintiffs in personal injury\nlawsuits are asked to submit to medical examination; and lawyers and\ngrand juries have the authority to subpoena medical information for\nuse in legal proceedings and investigations, placing highly sensitive\nmedical information at risk of public disclosure (Wolf and Zandecki\n2006). Like the demands of public health surveillance, legal process\ndemands argue against unqualified rights of medical confidentiality\n(El Emam and Moher 2013).\n1.2 Secrecy\n\nSissela Bok defined secrecy as intentional concealment (Bok 1982).\nPatients and caregivers can promote privacy through secrecy. Secrecy\npractices loom large in health care. Some people do not share the\nknowledge of medical symptoms even with their closest friends and\nfamily members. A person may secretly know he or she is ill before he\nor she admits it to family members or consults a physician. Reluctance\nto share knowledge of medical symptoms with associates or kin and\nmedical professionals may stem from fear of disability or death;\navoidance of discrimination in insurance, employment and education; or\ndread of social stigma, shame, embarrassment or rejection. In the\n1990s, questions arose about the obligations of dentists and other\nhealth care providers to refrain from secrecy and disclose their HIV\npositive status to patients. Fertility patients may want to conceal\nthe use of donated sperm or eggs, due to the social and religious\nconsequences of disclosure (Birenbaum-Carmeli et al. 2008). Few\nmedical conditions or procedures are shrouded in total secrecy\nanymore. Yet, people may prefer to keep secret the fact of, for\nexample, their elective cosmetic procedures, weight loss surgery, sex\nreassignment surgery, abortions, fertility treatments, and\nsterilizations.\n\nPaternalistically withholding medical knowledge from patients as the\nsecrets of doctors, healthy spouses and adult children pits ideals of\nbeneficence in caregiving against the patient\u2019s right to know.\nPaternalistic secrecy is a major feature of medical practice, more\nprevalent in some countries, communities and families than others.\nMoral ideals of autonomy and agency argue for informing patients of\ntheir medical conditions, truthfully and fully. Yet, medical news is\nsometimes deliberately kept from patients. The adult children of a 95\nyear old woman might think it unduly cruel to reveal the diagnosis of\noperable bowel cancer when she would be better able to cope with the\nfib that she has benign diverticulitis. The parents of a young child\nmight think it kind-hearted to conceal his terminal leukemia from him,\non the ground that he is too young to understand death. Some moralists\nwould agree. Yet if deception is categorically wrong, then secrecy\nabout medical adversity would surely be unethical. A related issue is\nhow medical clinicians and researchers should deal with\n\u201cincidental and secondary findings\u201d: disclose to the\nsubject, or keep confidential within the research team? The return of\nincidental findings may create undue worry and increase medical costs\nby prompting unnecessary medical visits and testing, but the\noverriding obligation may be to anticipate incidental and secondary\nfindings and communicate them with care (Presidential Commission\n2013).\n\nThere is no guarantee that patients will believe medical truths or\ndiagnoses squarely placed before them by qualified physicians. Denial\nof unpleasant truths is commonplace. Self-deception about health is a\npowerful phenomenon. Some people sincerely believe refusing to accept\nan unwanted diagnosis by maintaining a positive attitude will shield\nthem from medical catastrophe. Mental disorders can trick one into\nthinking one is well, happy and insightful, rather than the manic,\ndelusional person the psychiatrist may diagnose.\n\nAnother kind of secrecy practiced in medicine is the concealment of\nsurgical wounds and scars. Cosmetic surgeons hide scars inside\nhairlines and in the creases behind the ears. Breast cancer is no\nlonger the cause for secrecy it once was, yet reconstruction surgery\nfollowing mastectomy is a kind of concealment. The lure of minimally\ninvasive laparoscopic surgery is not only that it may both reduce the\nlength of hospital stays and the risk of infection, but also that it\nleaves less prominent and visible scars. Advances in medical\nimagining, such as the X-ray, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound, allow\nproviders to enter the body and capture information without leaving\ntell-tale signs of having done so.\n\nNeuroimaging, brain imagining technologies (BIT) generally, and\nadvanced lie-detection raise critical questions about whether secret\nthoughts should be available for discernment, and if so under what\ncircumstances (Presidential Commission 2014; Farahany 2012). The issue\nis one of coerced self-disclosure and, if someday criminal guilt could\nbe reliably discerned from imaging, self-incrimination.\n1.3 Data Protection and Security\n\nThe moral significance attached to medical privacy is reflected in\ndata protection and security laws adopted by local and national\nauthorities around the world. The point of these laws is to regulate\nthe collection, quality, storing, sharing and retention of health\ndata, including the electronic health record (EHR) (CDT 2009, in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Health privacy statutes limit disclosure in the absence of informed\nconsent; but typical statutes recognize numerous exceptions for\nroutine uses, research, public health reporting, and legal process and\nlaw enforcement. The policy consensus seems to be that, while medical\nprivacy is important, patients\u2019 medical information may be\ndisclosed to third-parties for socially important purposes unrelated\nto their own care. Electronically stored and produced medical\ninformation is by its very nature mobile. Those with access can\ntransmit EHR data across town or across state and national borders.\nPatients today have unprecedented access to their own health\ninformation. Patients may transmit medical data over email, entrust it\nto third party cloud data storage providers, or collect health data\nvia apps and wearable devices with little attention to third part\naccess and use.\n\nSome jurisdictions have special rules for management of certain health\ninformation. Data regarding HIV/AIDS, mental health and genetics are\nafforded special treatment in U.S. law, for example. Philosophers\nponder whether particular conditions merit such exceptionalism. The\nargument for HIV/AIDS exceptionalism recalls the early days of the\nglobal epidemic when knowledge of the illness was poor, treatment was\nineffective, and social stigma attached to affliction. The argument\nfor mental health exceptionalism is that patients do and must\n\u201cbare their souls\u201d to mental and behavioral health\nproviders, making disclosures socially costly (Radden 2004). A U.S.\nfederal statute prohibits basing employment or health insurance\ndecisions on information about a person\u2019s DNA or genetic\npredispositions (GINA 2008). The leading argument for genetic data\nexceptionalism appears to be that genetic data conveys uniquely\ndetailed information about a person and her biological family,\ninformation a person might have a right to know or a right not to know\n(Chadwick et al. 2014). Some genetic information can foretell a\nperson\u2019s health future (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).\n\nThe use of electronic technology has been described as a boon for\nhealth care delivery and administration for decades (Burton 2004;\nNational Research Council 1991). Yet heightened concerns for privacy\nfollowed increased portability of health data mandated by law (HIPAA\n1996) and third-party (\u201ccloud\u201d) data storage. The\nobligation to protect medical data held by the state or private\ncompanies has taken on a new urgency as more and more health data is\nbeing transmitted and stored electronically. It has been argued that\ninformation managers owe it to the public to take stringent measures\nto prevent data breaches and to appropriately respond and remediate\nwhen a breach occurs. A data breach can result from the theft of a\nlaptop; fraudulent or accidental access to data; sabotage by dishonest\nor disgruntled employees; or the loss of data storage devices. Major\nhospitals, health agencies and insurers have experienced highly\npublicized data breaches affecting millions of consumers whose names,\naddresses, health identification numbers and other data were\ncompromised (Seh et al. 2020). A philosophical question raised by data\nbreaches is how to define and morally repair harm. Medical identity\ntheft and public disclosure of private facts are generally regarded as\n\u201charms\u201d (Biegelman 2009). But it has been argued that\nnegligently causing increased risks of identity theft and public\ndisclosure of private facts are harms, too. If risk amplification is\nharm, though, it is unclear what should count as fair compensation or\nmoral repair. \n1.4 Anonymity\n\nAnonymity has value in a variety of public health and medical research\ncontexts. Research publications commonly shield the identities of\nbiomedical research subjects or clinical patients. Special attention\nis paid to genetic information. Although a number of prominent\nscientists and lay people have made their genomes public, genetics\nresearch and scholarly publication standards call for protection of\nthe identities of research subjects and their families. Bioethicists\ndistinguish between identifiable, de-identified and anonymized whole\ngenome sequencing data. (Presidential Commission, 2012) In the US,\nde-identified data is not protected under the laws protecting human\nsubjects known as the Common Rule. Concerns can arise about whether\nparticular methods of de-identification and anonymization adequately\nshield individuals from invasion of privacy and breaches of\nconfidentiality (Yoo et al. 2018). \u201cDifferential privacy\u201d\nis an anonymization approach to personal data sharing favored by some\ncomputer scientists that has potential value to health care data\n(Dwork 2006).\n\nThe use of the anonymously deployed personal diary for learning about\nand assessing health-related behavior is commonplace (Minichiello et\nal. 2000). Research subjects are asked to record contraception use,\ncondom use and other sexual practices in diaries which become research\ntools. Researchers must take care to warn research subjects about the\ndangers of disclosing information which could expose them to social or\nlegal sanctions. \n\nIn the context of COVID-19, North American policy makers were\npresented with members of the public who concealed their infected\nstatus and chose to travel on airplanes, congregate and not wear\nmasks. In the heyday of the HIV/AIDS crisis in North America,\npolicymakers similarly struggled to find ethically sound approaches to\ninfectious disease control in the face of imperfect compliance with\nrecommended best practices. Controversy arose in the 1990s over\nanonymous testing. Anonymous HIV/AIDS testing is now routinely\nperformed but was once controversial among ethicists. Anonymity was\ndefended on the ground that it encouraged testing by individuals\nwishing to control when, whether and to whom to disclose their\nHIV/AIDS status (Fairchild et al. 2007a). On the other hand, it was\nrecognized that behavioral surveillance is a potentially useful\ncomponent of aggressively protecting public health (Fairchild et al.\n2007b; Gallagher et al. 2007; Burr 1999); in some situations,\nanonymous testing could make tracking patterns of infection more\ndifficult. It was suggested that anonymous testing allowed infected\npersons to engage in dangerous, morally irresponsible sexual behavior\nwithout accountability. Proponents of anonymous testing replied that\npolicy-makers and ethicists should not assume that men and women who\nlearn they are HIV positive on the basis of anonymous tests would\negoistically conceal their status from sexual partners. A few\nindividuals will knowingly impose serious risks on others, but newly\ninformed positive test-takers may responsibly notify past and future\npartners, refrain from risky behaviors, and seek medical care. The\nethical issues surrounding HIV/AIDS have changed now that the\ncondition is less stigmatizing and, in developed countries, is a\ntreatable chronic condition rather than a death sentence. \n1.5 Accountability\n\nConfidentiality thrives as a legal duty and institutional practice,\ndespite the emergent trend towards voluntary openness about personal\nmedical information. The specifics of health and medical care have\nbecome acceptable topics of ordinary conversation outside the family\ncircle. In the U.S., public figures have taken the lead, speaking out\nabout their Covid-19, heart attacks, AIDS, erectile dysfunction,\ndementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, melanoma, prostate cancer and\nbreast cancer. Disclosures that would have been considered indelicate\nor stigmatizing thirty years ago are made freely today, whether to\nmake conversation, share a concern, educate the public, or endorse a\nnon-profit or pharmaceutical product.\n\nTo a noteworthy degree, openness is also compelled by morals and law.\nAccountability for personal life is a feature of modern life, and\nmedical accountability is a feature of modern life. Being accountable\nmeans being called upon to share information, explain, adjust behavior\nor submit to sanction. In the wake of COVID-19, SARS, Ebola and AIDS,\nnew levels of information accountability gained public acceptance.\nWorld-wide, people are coming to think of minor and major contagious\nillnesses as conditions giving rise to public accountability. The\naccountability that is called for includes information gathering and\nsharing as a condition of travel between cities and countries or\nentering workplaces and schools. International travelers are asked to\nreport symptoms of illness to officials. International visitors have\ntheir body temperatures scanned for fever automatically as they\nproceed to customs in some airports, workers are asked the same as a\ncondition of enter workplaces. Mandatory testing, reporting, contact\ntracing and the use of prescribed symptom-checking apps, are examples\nof health information accountability. Beyond accountability for health\ninformation, the COVID-19 pandemic has made people accountable for\nmask wearing, hand washing, self-isolation, social gathering and other\nbehaviors once considered purely personal. Decisions whether to\nvaccinate are also subject to moral and legal accountability, whether\nto prevent measles, COVID-19, or flu. \n\nMany people speak openly about health matters with strangers as a\ncondition of receiving and paying for health care. For example, a\nfamily needing the assistance of a regional mental health/mental\nretardation agency unavoidably places reams of sensitive information\nin the hands of government. (Bridges 2017) The same is true of a\nfamily which needs to apply for government benefits for aging or\ndisabled kin. The more disclosures a family must make, the wider the\ncircle of confidentiality and the lesser the medical privacy.\nQuestions of distributive justice are raised by mandatory disclosures\nto government made as a condition of access to care. Poor and disabled\npersons dependent upon medical assistance from government have\nsubstantially less informational privacy vis-\u00e0-vis\ngovernment than wealthy and healthy persons. The risks and burdens of\nstate knowledge of the individual are disproportionately borne by the\nleast well off segments of society.\n1.6 Professional Norms \n\nThe duty of confidentiality is a core consensus norm within health\ncare (Currie 2005). One important manifestation of this consensus in\nthe U.S. has been the development of the \u201ccertificate of\nconfidentiality\u201d whereby researchers declare that\nconfidentiality is of especial interest to their subjects (Wolf and\nZandecki 2006, Wolf et al. 2004). The technological age has given rise\nto the call for health care providers, even those who work alone or in\nsmall groups, to be aggressive in the adoption of responsible\ninformation practices. All would agree that office practices can and\nshould be designed to protect the identity of clients and the privacy\nof conversations. Common understandings are that practitioners should\nbe judicious in the collection of information; they should store\ntreatment notes and records in a secure manner; they should share\ninformation only with consent or as required by law; and they should\nprotect sensitive information in its online and off-line forms using\nlocks, passwords, encryption and other appropriate devices. Sensitive\ninformation that is no longer needed should not be retained\nindefinitely.\n\nHealth Care providers are ascribed ethical obligations to avoid\ncasually discussing confidential patient matters in social media or in\ne-mail that may not be entirely private or secure (Chretien et al.\n2011). They must avoid discussing patient matters on mobile phones in\npublic places, such as in office corridors, hospital lobbies and on\ntrains. Confidentiality can be violated by unauthorized recordings and\ndisclosure of medical photographs. Photography plays a role in medical\nspecializations including dermatology and plastic surgery, giving\nraise to concerns about ethical uses of graphic images of\npatients\u2019 faces and bodies. At a minimum informed consent would\nappear to be required for making and disclosing photographs on whose\nbasis a person could be identified. Ethically imperative consent was\nnot obtained in a notorious U.S. case: it came to light in 2013 that a\nphysician affiliated with Johns Hopkins University Hospital secretly\nvideotaped hundreds of his obstetrics and gynecology patients with\npornographic intent (Allen 2015). Videotaping has come to play a\nroutine role in family therapy and is not considered unethical by\ntypical practitioners (AAMFT 2001). Many clinicians believe the\ntherapeutic and training benefits of videotaping outweigh the risks of\nunauthorized use or disclosure. Even if unauthorized use or disclosure\nwere not a concern, an ethical question would remain. Should\nbehavioral health clients be called upon to create recordings which\ninherently sacrifice the privacy of their homes, communications and\nexpressions of emotions?\n\nPhysicians are debating whether to increase the use of video and\naudio-taping in routine clinical practice, surgery and research, and\nbioethicists are weighing in (Blaauw et al. 2014; Makary 2013). Should\noffice visits be recorded as part of the standard medical record? On\nthe one hand, recordings would address the problem of faulty memory\nand incomplete encounter notes. Recordings could document informed\nconsent procedures and provide evidence to avert or support\nmalpractice suits. On the other hand, recordings could inhibit\npatients and increase their discomfort. Recording practices might\nencourage physicians to be less attentive to the patients in front of\nthem on the theory that they can always \u201cgo back to the\ntape\u201d for details.\n2. Physical Privacy\n\nThere has been relatively little attention paid by philosophers to\nphysical privacy concerns in medicine compared to informational\nconcerns. Yet typical patients bring a bevy of strong expectations of\nmodesty, solitude and bodily integrity to doctors\u2019 offices,\nhospitals, telemedicine visits and other health care encounters. These\nexpectations that they will not be needlessly touched, crowded, gawked\nat or secretly filmed, recorded or imaged relate to the need for\npsychological comfort, dignity and security. The internet has made\ndelivering health care possible across vast distances. (Chepesiuk\n1999). Telemedicine, which grew exponentially during the first year if\nthe COVID-19 crisis, allowed doctors and nurses to evaluate common\nmedical complaints remotely without touching the patient. In the\nmeantime, health care typically involves physical contact with\nothers.\n2.1 Solitude\n\nSolitude is a form of physical privacy of special interest to medical\nethics (Storr 2005; Barbour 2004). The sick do not want to be lonely\nand abandoned, but they may want personal space and time alone.\nSolitude has value as a context for quiet reflection about the\nsignificance of illness and injury. A period of solitude after\nconsultation and self-education is a useful condition in which to make\nup one\u2019s mind about treatment options.\n\nThe sickest patients may both crave and fear solitude. When alone they\ncome face-to-face with the potentially cruel reality of impending\ndeath. Yet in company they may feel patronized or guilty about the\nburdens they impose on family and friends. Whether the suffering is\nthe agony of injury, childbirth, recovering from major surgery or\ndying, persons may feel that they should not have to deal with others\nwhile in such a state or at such a time. Implicit social norms\nvalidate deferring to wishes of the sick or dying for seclusion and\nsolitude (Post 1989; Nissenbaum 2009). These wishes may arise and be\nviolated not only in hospital, hospice or nursing home settings, but\nalso in mental hospitals and prisons, where panoptic policies of\nmonitoring and surveillance prevail (Bozovic 1995; Holmes and Federman\n2006: 16\u201317; Foucault 1977).\n2.2 Bodily Modesty\n\nPhilosophers in the virtue ethics and Christian ethics traditions have\nidentified modesty as a moral virtue (Schueler 1999). Modesty is a\nform of physical privacy of special interest to medical ethics. If\npatients are to receive the best care, they must be willing to expose\ntheir bodies to medical personnel and technicians. Removing\none\u2019s clothing for purposes of examination and testing is\nroutine for most health care consumers. Busy emergency rooms and\nneighborhood clinics may be unable to cloak or seclude patients at\nall. Harried physicians may forget \u201cbedside manners\u201d and\nfail sufficiently to honor patients\u2019 modesty expectations.\nIn-patients in teaching hospitals are expected to adapt to diminished\nphysical privacy, since medical students and researchers accompany\nattending physicians on rounds and participate in care.\n\nYet feelings of modesty and felt obligations of bodily modesty are\ncommonplace. Many individuals understand bodily modesty as a moral\nvirtue, and act accordingly. Under some religious traditions, such as\nthose of Muslims, Orthodox Jews and the Amish, bodily modesty is a\nrequirement of faith. Being asked to disrobe, even for a good reason,\nmay impose the cost of going against principle or desire (Kato and\nMann 1996).\n\nHealth care providers respond to the modesty values of their patients\nin a number of ways. They provide special modesty garments and\nsheeting to minimize nudity. They ask patients to uncover only those\nportions of the body which must be exposed, and then only for the\nperiod of time necessary. While hospitals cannot offer every\nin-patient a private room, shared rooms are generally dividable by\ncurtains that grant patients some degree of physical seclusion (and\nassociational intimacy with visiting family and friends). Male\ngynecologists and obstetricians help patients cope with sex-specific\nmodesty norms and sexual abuse concerns by working with female\nassistants. Some health care providers maintain medical procedures\nstaffing policies sensitive to modesty and harassment concerns.\nIndeed, mammograms on women are generally performed by female\ntechnicians. On the other hand, the radiologists and radiology\ntechnicians who deliver prolonged, intimate radiation services to\nbreast cancer patients are likely to be male. Patients may encounter\nhealth institutions and providers who are unwilling to honor what they\nmay regard as impractical or discriminatory preferences for same-sex\nor same race caregivers, preferences sometimes motivated rightly or\nwrongly by modesty concerns.\n2.3 Bodily Integrity\n\nAnother aspect of physical privacy is bodily integrity. Mandatory\ntesting and health evaluation offend bodily integrity by forcing\npersons to submit their bodies to unwanted touching and visual\ninspection (Allen 2014). Policy makers and the courts have generally\npermitted a great deal of nonconsensual urine testing of school\nchildren and people in jobs tied to public safety, public service and\ncrime control. Drivers can be subjected to alcohol intoxication\nscreening at road blocks or in hospital emergency rooms after\naccidents to promote highway safety. The concerns about neuroimaging\nand lie detection raised earlier in this article under the rubric of\nsecrecy could as easily be raised here in connection with bodily\nintegrity. Nonconsensual uses of imaging and lie-detection to assess\nhonesty or character arguably demeans and disrespects autonomous moral\nagents and assaults bodily integrity. The philosophical issue here is\nwhether there is some limit to the right of government to sidestep\npersons\u2019 preferences about the handling of their bodies, body\nfluids and tissue samples. These issues arise in peace and war, and\nwith respect to the living and the dead. Certainly, law-based\nconstraints exist, but so too do principle-based and other moral\nconstraints (Faden et al. 1986). Western cultures respect the\nintegrity of a deceased\u2019s body; however advances in transplant\nmedicine mean the newly dead are a garden of healthy organs that could\nbe used to save and extend lives. Organ harvesting with or without\nconsent may be defended on utilitarian moral grounds. Of particular\nphilosophical import is the issue of whether the bodily integrity of a\nperson is violated when organs and/or tissue are harvested prior to\nbrain death or prior to cardiac death. A related philosophical\nquestion is whether a legal regime of opting into organ donation or\nopting out of organ donation better serves the demands of justice and\nmorality. Post-mortem sperm donation raises important ethical\nquestions about bodily integrity. Harvesting the sperm of a deceased\nman raises concerns about respect for corpses; using sperm to create\nembryos and ultimately to parent the children of dead men raises\nconcerns about parental autonomy and beneficence toward children.\n3. Associational Privacy\n\nRespect for the intimacy of the experiences of suffering, childbirth,\nrecovery and dying is required by sound ethics. People who are in pain\nor grieving have an interest in including some people and excluding\nothers. People commonly want to reserve sharing the joys of medical\nexperience with friends and family, no less than the agonies. They\nhave what can be thought of as an associational privacy interest in\nselective intimacy.\n\nInjured, suffering, and dying adults may badly desire intimacy, even\nsexual intimacy. A patient may wish to exclude strangers or\ninessential medical personnel at times when the presence of loved ones\nis welcome. Parents of newborns may regard strangers photographing\ntheir babies as violations of family intimacy. A dying man may object\nto being photographed by a physician anxious to take photographs of\nthe man\u2019s surgical wounds for scientific purposes. If\nassociational privacy is important, a bored visitor strolling the\nhalls of a hospital should not maneuver to watch a randomly selected\npatient give birth; and if he does, he merits criticism as a morally\noffensive intruder.\n\nHospitals and hospital patients have clashed over who should be\nallowed visitation and a role in decision-making or hands-on care.\nSome institutions have kept extended family, paramours, gay or lesbian\npartners and children away from in-patients. On the other hand,\nchildren\u2019s hospitals commonly encourage parents to spend as much\ntime as possible with sick minors, and may have sleeping sofas near\nchildren\u2019s beds or sleeping rooms inside the hospital for\nattentive guardians.\n4. Proprietary Privacy\n\nMoral and legal theorists have offered accounts of the relationship\nbetween \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cprivacy\u201d,\n\u201cproperty rights\u201d and \u201cprivacy rights\u201d (May\n1988; Radin 1987; Thomson 1975). Philosophers have debated the\nexistence of a property right in the self, both the physical self and\nthe non-physical self (e.g., the mind or soul) (Lakoff & Johnson\n1999). One philosopher has argued that we own our selves and owe\nourselves a self-love that constrains how we ought to treat our selves\nand allow others to treat us (Annas 1989).\n\nJohn Locke famously characterized the relationship between a person\nand her body as self-ownership. However, other philosophers have held\nthat persons are stewards of their bodies rather than owners (Honore\n1961). In medical contexts, under rubrics of privacy, individuals are\nsometimes ascribed rights of self-ownership and the ownership of parts\nand products of their bodies (Moore 2005). In this vein, a\nphilosophically interesting invasion of privacy argument was advanced\nin the landmark California case Moore v. Regents of the University\nof California (1990). Without his knowledge or consent,\nUniversity of Southern California research physicians developed a\ncommercial cell line from tissue removed from leukemia patient John\nMoore. Moore and an appellate court argued that in taking his\nDNA-laden tissue for unrevealed research and development purposes\nunrelated to Moore\u2019s cancer care, UCLA doctors had appropriated\nMoore\u2019s identity in a manner analogous to advertisers using a\nperson\u2019s photograph without consent for commercial gain.\nMoore\u2019s privacy claim was novel at the time, but the claims of\ncelebrities and others to control the attributes of their personal\nidentities\u2014likenesses, voices, names, monikers, trademarks, and\nSocial Security numbers\u2014are commonly styled as privacy rights\nand have been since the early 20th century. John\nMoore\u2019s privacy claim was not successful in court. The\nCalifornia court held that Moore\u2019s doctors ought to have\nobtained his informed consent; but the court was unwilling to\ncommodify human tissue or DNA as private property (Radin 1987). Nor\ndid the court think Moore\u2019s injury fit the mold of traditional\ninvasions of privacy recognized in the law. In a related case that did\nnot result in tort litigation in her lifetime, cells taken from\nBaltimore resident Henrietta Lacks were the basis of an important\nimmortal cell line, HeLa. Lacks died in 1951, but the cell line\ncreated using her cervical cancer cells without her knowledge or\nconsent lives on. It has been used in the treatment and eradication of\nnumerous conditions and illnesses, including polio, without any\nfinancial reward to her or her heirs.\n\nBut proprietary understandings of privacy continue to find expression\nin health care and health research contexts. Scholars suggest that\nindividuals have privacy interests in their genes, genomes and\nbio-banked tissue specimens. These are sources of health information\nthat reflect what individuals and their biological families are like,\nand what will become of them. Since most people share a DNA profile\nwith no one other than an identical twin, a person\u2019s DNA is\nvirtually a unique personal identifier. The interest individuals have\nin controlling the use of their data and specimens can be reconciled\nwith researchers\u2019 needs for genotypical and phenotypical data,\nwhere principles of informed consent are honored (Presidential\nCommission 2012). Many people are now willing to voluntarily share\ngenetic data without personal gain. The United States National\nInstitutes of Health \u201cAll of Us\u201d project sought to enroll\none million American volunteers of diverse backgrounds into a research\nprogram requiring that they share medical and genetic data to help\naccelerate the search for disease cures and treatments.\n\nInfertility medicine is a growing field, one dependent upon gamete\ndonation and cryopreservation of embryos. Individuals have asserted\nwhat they describe as \u201cprivacy\u201d interests in controlling\nthe fate of gametes, zygotes, and frozen embryos. The privacy\ninterests debated in the context of infertility medicine are twofold:\na decisional privacy interest in the decision to bear a child with the\nhelp of reproductive technologies, and a proprietary privacy interest\nin controlling the fate of the building blocks of human life and the\nearliest beginnings of human life, created as a consequence of\none\u2019s intentions or the use of one\u2019s genetic materials.\nWhile many courts have rejected viewing frozen embryos as property,\nthey have struggled over how to allocate rights over embryos in cases\nof separation, divorce, death, moves and changes of heart.\n\nIn an entirely different vein, government regulators and the general\npublic characterize identity theft as a \u201cprivacy\u201d problem\n(Allen 2011). In recent years identify theft has become a privacy\nproblem in the delivery of health care. Because of the high price of\nhealth care, medical identity theft\u2014receiving medical care using\nothers\u2019 personal data for billing purposes\u2014has become a\nserious problem. Consumers must worry both about the confidentiality\nof their medical records and physician encounters, and about the\npossibility that someone will appropriate their personal identifiers\nand then use them to defraud health care providers and insurers.\n5. Decisional Privacy\n\nIn medical contexts, \u201cprivacy\u201d is commonly used to denote\nautonomy, liberty or choice in health-related decision-making (Allen\n2014; DeCew 1997; Feinberg 1983). Patients\u2019 active participation\nin health-related decisions and control of their bodies\u2014without\nundue interference of government or unauthorized persons\u2014is a\ndecisional variant of the concept of privacy. Women are often ascribed\na \u201cprivacy right\u201d to use medically prescribed birth\ncontrol and to elect medically safe abortions. Men and women are\nascribed a \u201cprivacy right\u201d to utilize in vitro\nfertilization, surrogate gestators, and other reproductive\ntechnologies. Men and women with terminal illnesses or in vegetative\ncomas are ascribed a \u201cprivacy right\u201d to refuse\nlife-sustaining nutrition, respirators, and medical care (Beauchamp\n2000). Decisional privacy was problematically implicated in decisions\nwhether to self-isolate or wear a facial covering to avert the spread\nof COVID-19, and has come up in relation to other health-impacting\nlife-style decisions. \n\nDecisional uses of \u201cprivacy\u201d featured in this section are\ndisfavored by some philosophers. They view the term\n\u201cprivacy\u201d as more clearly and properly suited to\ninformational and physical uses, which they view as central,\nparadigmatic or core. On the other hand, the decisional use of privacy\nhas bona fide conceptual roots in Greek and Roman\nantiquity\u2019s public/private distinction, marking a boundary\nbetween affairs of politics and government (res publicae) and\naffairs of the household (re privatae). \n5.1 Birth Control\n\nBirth control and abortion are common practices the world over. Felt\nby many to be deeply private matters, birth control and abortion were\nonce criminalized on moral and medical grounds, but are safe and\nwidely available today. Laws categorically criminalizing contraception\nand abortion were struck down in the U.S., Canada, most of Europe,\nJapan and Taiwan by the final third of the 20th century. In\nthe United States, in 1965 the Supreme Court struck down laws\ncriminalizing birth control in Griswold v Connecticut, on the\nground that married couples have a \u201cright to privacy\u201d to\nuse birth control provided by physicians, grounded in the Bill of\nRights and the 14 Amendment. Several of the most effective forms of\ncontraception are only available through a medical doctor, including,\nin some countries oral contraceptives, interuterine devices, and\ntransdermal implants. \n\nFeminist philosophers have widely debated the significance of the use\nof the concepts of privacy and a \u201cright to privacy\u201d to win\nwomen the capacity to control their fertility (R\u00f6ssler 2004;\nBoling 1996). The concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d played a role in\nconfining women to traditional roles of daughter, wife and mother\nunder the authority of male heads of households. While Catherine\nMacKinnon argued that ascriptions of rights of privacy are merely\npalliative distractions from a more basic quest for gender equality,\nother feminists have argued that privacy rights play a proper role in\nachieving reproductive autonomy and pave the road to greater education\nand employment equality (Allen 2000; MacKinnon 1984).\n\nOfficial Roman Catholic doctrine opposes all non-natural birth\ncontrol, birth control devices and all intentional abortions (Pope\nPaul VI, 1968, Humanae Vitae). Some regard human sexuality as\nhaving an essentially reproductive purpose and artificial birth\ncontrol as unethically unnatural. Like Roman Catholics, other\nreligious faith communities subscribe to a belief that human life\nbegins \u201cat the moment of conception\u201d when a sperm\nfertilizes an egg, and that forms of birth control that may prevent\nthe development of a fertilized egg to grow into a baby are the moral\nequivalents of intentional \u201cabortion\u201d. Those who oppose\ncontraception on personal moral or religious grounds, sometimes but\nnot always, support a legal \u201cright to privacy\u201d ;\nprotecting access to medically safe birth control and/or abortion.\n5.2 Abortion\n\nWith the possible exception of the privacy of medical records and\ngenetic information since the 1990s, no issues have linked the concept\nof privacy to medicine more than the issue of abortion rights. Because\nof moral and religious disagreement about abortion, the link beween\nprivacy and abortion rights has been politicized in the United States\nfor decades (Jonsen 1998: 294ff). \n\nAvoiding the concept of privacy as such, Judith Thomson employed the\nconcept of a right to control the use of one\u2019s own body in a\nfamous defense of abortion rights (Thomson 1971). The United States\nSupreme Court popularized privacy grounds for abortion rights when it\nheld in Roe v Wade in 1973 that the constitutional right to\nprivacy requires striking down laws criminalizing medically safe\nabortions. Advocates of a decisional privacy right to abortion\nmaintain that government should not take sides in what is irreducibly\na moral debate, and that individuals should be free to make up their\nown minds about the moral status of the unborn (Richards 1986).\n\nStressing that fetus are not self conscious subjects of experience,\nsome philosophers have denied that fetuses are moral persons with\nrights to life that outweigh women\u2019s privacy rights. Those who oppose\nabortion privacy argue that abortion should not be left to private\nchoice because the unborn are in fact equal members of the moral\ncommunity, along with newborn infants. Membership in the moral\ncommunity is conferred by human status or potential personhood, these\nphilosophers argue. Religious ethicists sometimes characterize the\nunborn as acquiring souls in utero. Some moralists maintain that\nwomen\u2019s decisional privacy must yield if science establishes\nthat a totally unique human life comes into being with fertilization\nof an ovum. In support of moral and legal abortion rights, Peter\nSinger has argued that science proves that unique human lives do not\nbegin at conception. Instead, fertilization begins a process of\ninitially pluripotent cell development that may result in several\nhuman lives, due, e.g., to twinning and other divisions, or in no\nhuman life, due, e.g., to defects that result in spontaneous abortion.\nPhilosophers Margaret Little and Rosalind Hursthouse contributed\nnuance to the ethics of abortion debate by arguing that while autonomy\nand privacy concerns are important, sui generis\nconsiderations of obligation and virtue are ethically relevant to\ndecisions about terminating a pregnancy (Little 1999; Hursthouse\n1991).\n\nThe trend in public policy, dating back to the 1970s in the U.S. and\nmost of Europe, seems to be moral compromise (McDonagh 1996; Sher\n1981). The law tends to permit women to obtain abortions freely in the\nfirst trimester and then to limit access to second and third trimester\nabortions. Philosophical differences in how societies think about\nabortion ethics are reflected in the four major models of abortion\nregulation found around the world. The models of abortion regulation\nare (1) the model of prohibition, banning most abortions, even if\nmedically safe; (2) the model of permission, allowing most abortions\nbut based legislated eligibility criteria rather than choice; (3) the\nmodel of prescription, requiring even unwanted abortions for eugenic\nor population control purposes and (4) the model of privacy, freely\nallowing most abortions chosen by women, with minimal restrictions.\nWhile the U.S. under Roe v. Wade (1973) used to be a nation\nin which the model of privacy prevailed, it has taken on features of a\nmodel of permission regime since 1989 when the U.S. Supreme Court\nannounced it would begin allowing restrictions. The Court has upheld\nrestrictions it deems not unduly restrictive of choice, including\nmandatory waiting periods and bans on specific second and third\nsemester abortion (so-called \u201cpartial birth\u201d)\ntechniques.\n5.3 Conscientious Refusal of Medical Services by Professionals\n\nIn most countries, the public relies on licensed physicians and\nhospitals for medical care. The medicines physicians recommend are\navailable only from professionally trained, licensed pharmacists. In\nthe U.S., state and federal laws have been enacted to relieve health\ncare providers of the obligation to perform medical services that\noffend their philosophical, moral, or religious beliefs. Some\npolicy-makers have argued that health care practitioners should be\nfree to decline to provide services for which they are professionally\ntrained if doing so genuinely violates personal conscience (Dresser\n2005). Defenders of what have been called \u201cconscience\nclauses\u201d and \u201crefusal laws\u201d see themselves as\ndefending the \u201cprivacy\u201d of pharmacists and health care\nproviders, privacy akin to liberty of thought and freedom of religion\n(White 1999). But opponents of such laws see themselves as the true\ndefenders of privacy, standing up for the \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d of patients. They stress that the call for refusal laws\nhas been tied to larger \u201cpro life\u201d strategies to limit\naccess to contraceptives, medical abortifacients and surgical\nabortions. They say pharmacists who decline to dispense medication are\nplacing their personal values and autonomy above the values and\nautonomy of patients. Furthermore, pharmacists, like physicians and\nnurses, enjoy the benefits of regulation and have chosen their\nprofessions voluntarily. Private reproductive choices can be exercised\nonly if sufficient numbers of health care professionals are willing to\nperform lawful services.\n\nShould health care workers be required to dispense medications and\nperform procedures that violate their personal scruples? Most\nbioethicists agree that in the context of emergency medicine,\nconscientious refusal has no place. A physician should not refuse to\nterminate an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy threatening the life of the\nmother, for example. There is significant disagreement, however, about\nwhether morally-based refusal is warranted by retail pharmacists. An\nethical code promulgated by a pharmacists association arguably places\npatients\u2019 need and social justice above the personal convictions\nof individual pharmacists (APHA 1994). Whether pharmacists can\nethically refuse may depend upon the proximity of other pharmacists\nwilling to serve in their places. Ethicists also disagree about\nwhether physicians may use their scruples as rationales for refusing\nto answer medical questions or refer patients to abortion providers. A\nfurther, related, question is whether physicians in countries where\nabortion is safe and legal may ethically follow their public or\nprivate employers\u2019 orders to refrain from providing information\nabout abortion services to patients.\n5.4 Assisted Reproductive Technology and Enhancements\n\nSome legal commentators and philosophers have argued that infertile\npersons have a right to procreative privacy that entails a right to\nuse technology and surrogates to bear children. Assisted reproductive\ntechnology services (\u201cART\u201d) include medicines to balance\nhormones, regulate ovulation, and stimulate the production of viable\neggs; and surgery to unblock Fallopian tubes or undo the damage of\nendometriosis, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and pelvic\ninflammatory disease. Reproductive services also include sperm and egg\nharvesting and donation, in vitro fertilization, zygote and\nembryo transplant, reproductive organ transplant, cryopreservation\n(\u201cfreezing\u201d) of pre-embryos, and surrogate\npregnancies.\n\nIt may be argued that the ability to freely choose ART, like the\nability to freely choose sterilization, abortion and birth control, is\ncalled for by the right to privacy. But ART use raises its own moral\nand practical concerns. One concern is the false hopes ART creates in\na world in which the technology is expensive and the success rate low.\nThe availability of affordable treatments can cause conflict within\nfamilies in some societies. Women report feeling pressured by their\nfamilies to undergo repeated painful attempts to get pregnant. It may\nargued that adoption is a more satisfying, affordable and socially\ncommendable option for becoming a parent. The use of reproductive\ntechnology has led to bioethical concerns about the handling of the\nearliest beginnings of human life. Ethical concerns surround exposing\notherwise healthy women to the uncertain health risks of repeated\nrounds of fertility drugs and high-risk multiple pregnancies with\ntwins and triplets. In a few tragic cases children created using ART\nhave been unwanted, raising questions of responsibility and the just\nrole of family law. What should happen if the people who contract with\na surrogate mother to carry a child for them using donated egg and\nsperm change their minds after a child is conceived? Should the\nmind-changers be deemed the parents? Should the gestator be deemed the\nparent; the gamete donors? Should parentage be assigned by a judge\nbased on the best interest of the child?\n\nThe realm of reproductive technology is surprisingly laissez\nfaire in the U.S., more regulated in the United Kingdom. Some\nU.S. constitutional lawyers argue that the right to bear and beget\nchildren enshrined by the Supreme Court in Fourteenth Amendment\njurisprudence is a right to bear and beget by virtually any consensual\nmeans necessary. There is a right to reproduce, they argue, and a\nright to use other people and social resources to help one reproduce.\nSome have even argued that the right to procreative privacy is a\nreason for government or employers to pay for fertility services. In\nIsrael, Germany and Taiwan, government subsidizes ART for infertile\ncouples. Some major private insurers cover fertility treatments in the\nU.S. Great Britain has enacted a statute and created a governing body\nto deal with policy and ethical questions raised by the growing\npopularity of artificial reproductive technologies. The Human\nFertilization and Embryology Act 1990 created the HFEA, an agency\ncharged to license and monitor IVF, donor insemination, human embryo\nresearch, and the storage of gametes and embryos.\n\nIt is now possible to select the sex of one\u2019s offspring. Some\nbioethicists have argued that a \u201cright to privacy\u201d\ncountermands government placing bans on sex selection. Supporters of\nsex selection sometimes argue that choosing a child\u2019s sex is a\nfuture parent\u2019s moral and legal right. Some methods of sex\nselection include: (1) Amniocentesis testing to determine sex,\nfollowed by abortion if the fetus has the undesired sex; (2) Sperm\nsorting to produce X rich or Y rich batches of sperm, followed by\nin vitro fertilization or insemination to increase chances of\nhaving a child of the desired sex; (3) preimplantation genetic\ndiagnosis (\u201cPGD\u201d) to determine the sex of a pre-embryo,\nfollowed by implantation of one or more pre-embryos of the desired\nsex. Amniocentesis and PGD were techniques developed originally to\ndetermine whether a fetus or embryo was affected by a genetic disorder\nsuch as Down\u2019s syndrome or cystic fibrosis. In some\njurisdictions abortion or PGD solely for sex-selection other than to\navoid sex-linked disorders is illegal.\n\nAdults who want children often prefer children of a particular sex, or\na \u201cbalance\u201d of male and female children, perhaps born in a\nparticular order. Medically-assisted high-tech sex selection raises\nlarge ethical issues. PGD involves creating human embryos, some of\nwhich will not be used. Freezing, destroying and giving away human\nembryos can seem inconsistent with respect for human dignity. Sex\nselection is arguably a kind of gender discrimination and could\nheighten problems of pernicious gender discrimination. Sex selection\nplays into gender stereotypes and could someday throw off the\nsocietal, even global balance of males and females. Sex-selection is\ncontroversial as a first step on a slippery slop toward\n\u201cdesigner babies\u201d.\n\nMen and women in developed countries are \u201cdesigning\u201d their\nbabies (Parens and Knowles 2003). In the context of fertility\nmedicine, patients select donated egg and sperm based on criteria such\nas the race, IQ, SAT scores, and detailed physical profiles of the\ndonors. The capacity to select the traits of offspring is likely to\nexpand in the coming years. It has been argued that a \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d countermands government placing bans on trait selection\nthrough genetic selection and manipulation. If women and their\npartners had an unlimited right to reproductive autonomy, it arguably\nwould follow that they have a right to use technologies that enable\nthem to choose the precise traits of their children. Yet the right is\nclearly not unlimited, and using technology to achieve\n\u201cperfect\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d humans may be\nunethical, even if using technology to screen out tragic abnormalities\nand diseases representing extremes of suffering is not (Presidential\nCommission 2015b).\n\nMichael Sandel has argued that the quest for genetic enhancements and\nother god-like mastery over the human body reflects a failure to\nappreciate fully the \u201cgiftedness\u201d of life and the ethical\nvalue of \u201chumility, responsibility, and solidarity\u201d\n(Sandel 2007: 12 and 86). Ronald Green has cautioned against a\nstatus quo bias that leads us to the irrational conclusion\nthat human beings should remain as they are (Green 2008: 9). John\nHarris has moved several steps beyond Ronald Green in building a case\nagainst preserving the status quo. Offering what he calls \u201cthe\nethical case for making people better\u201d, Harris has argued that\nsociety ought to leap on opportunities to create \u201chealthier,\nlonger lived, and altogether \u2018better\u2019 individuals\u201d\n(Harris 2007). In the future, the notion of decisional privacy may\nplay a major role in building a case for allowing individuals and\nfamilies to use or refuse genetic, pharmaceutical and other forms of\nenhancements.\n\nThe issue of biological enhancement is not limited to the context of\nprenatal intervention. Concepts of health privacy may be brought to\nbear on questions surrounding the ethics of electing to utilize\nmedical procedures or drugs to improve the motor and cognitive\ncapacities of people seeking to be \u201cnormal\u201d or\n\u201csuperior\u201d. The privacy-as-autonomy argument for allowing\nlargely unfettered choice has been less controversial where persons\nand clinicians aim to bring someone who is suffering from disease or\ndisability to within normal ranges, than where the aim is to enable\nsomeone to surpass normal levels. Thus, prescribing or taking Ritalin\nto combat ADD/HD may meet with moral approval as a matter of medical\nprivacy, while prescribing or taking Ritalin to achieve a higher SAT\nscore does not (Presidential Commission 2015b).\n5.5 Medically Unhealthy Life-Styles\n\nDoes privacy entail largely unfettered lifestyle choices? Should the\nstate enact health and safety rules designed to save people from poor\nprivate choices such as eating sugary, high fat foods, smoking and\nrefusing to wear motorcycle helmets? Are individuals entitled to\nunfettered enjoyment of drinking alcohol, using drugs recreatioally\nand a medication-free existence? The answer John Stuart Mill gave to\nsuch questions in his famous essay On Liberty (1869) was\n\u201cyes\u201d to the extent that these are self-regarding\nbehaviors that do not harm others. Mill defended liberal tolerance of\nintoxicants and narcotic drugs on the ground that liberty nets society\nbenefits that are lost when government tells us what to do. A\nlibertarian perspective condemns the \u201cnanny state\u201d that\nfails to treat citizens like conscientious adults (Harsanyi 2007:\n41).\n\nA robust regard for liberty prompts adopting an extreme libertarian\nperspective on the law. Yet \u201c[t]he notion of radical\nindividualism focuses on individual health behavior and ignores the\nsocial preconditions of that behavior \u201d(McGee 1999: 211). What,\non the surface, appear to be inviolate personal choices may be\nstraightforward products of social forces as diverse as \u201cmedia,\nadvertising, movies, literature and folklore\u201d (McGee 1999: 212).\nDebates over managed care have stressed that individuals\u2019\nunhealthy choices have externalities, including higher health care\ncosts for fellow citizens. Unhealthy lifestyles can impose substantial\ncosts on others. Smokers impose the costs of illnesses caused by\nexposure to second-hand smoke. Unhealthy diets and the lack of\nexercise can contribute to reduced worker productivity and increase\nhealth care spending. Obesity in pregnancy can adversely impact the\nhealth of developing fetuses and infants. Unhealthy lifestyles divert\nsocietal resources from other areas of public need, such as education\n(McGee 1999).\n5.6 The Patient\u2019s Right to Refuse Life Saving Care\n\nWhether persons with mental conditions are morally required to take\nmedications that make them better able to live normal lives could be\nstyled as a question of the limits of private choice. Some mental\nhealth patients are not competent to make their own treatment\ndecisions, but the vast majority are competent most of the time. Some\npatients are offered medications by their physicians to curb\ndistinctly anti-social impulses such as oppositionality, verbal\naggression and violence. It could be argued that these patients have\nan ethical obligation to medicate themselves, as advised. Competent\npatients with cognitive and emotional problems (such as moderate\ndepression or mild hallucinations) that affect mainly themselves may\nplausibly argue that the benefits of psychotropic medications are not\noutweighed by the risks of lethargy, sexual dysfunction, tremor,\nspeech problems and organ damage. Questions of political philosophy\nare implicated in debates over the extent to which authorities may\ncompel medication use by death row inmates, defendants awaiting trial,\nprisoners and in-patients in state hospitals.\n\nThe flowering of bioethics as an academic discipline and branch of\nphilosophy was fed by religious, moral and ethical concerns raised by\nhigh profile legal cases about the right to die (Beauchamp 2000).\nThese cases seemed to place the power to \u201cplay\nGod\u201d\u2014make life and death decisions\u2014in the hands of\npatients, families and physicians. The field was influenced, for\nexample, by the famous Karen Quinlan decision (In the Matter of\nQuinlan, 1976). This case transported the federal constitutional\nideal of the right to decisional privacy into state law, and\ncharacterized the right of a comatose woman\u2019s family to refuse\nlife-saving treatment on her behalf as a \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d (Jonsen 1998). After the Quinlan decision, hospitals\nbegan setting up ethics committees to help doctors, patients and\nfamilies exercise decisional privacy rights in a lawful and\nresponsible manner. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in the\ncase of Nancy Cruzan a right of patients to refuse medical care such\nas artificial respiration and tube feeding, where the wishes of the\npatient to die could be established by clear and convincing\nevidence.\n\nMoral philosophers have sought a greater role for ethics in shaping\ninterpretations of constitutional law in life and death cases. On\nDecember 6, 1996, six prominent U.S. moral philosophers submitted an\nunprecedented brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases,\nWashington v. Glucksberg (1997) and Vacco v. Quill\n(1997). The philosopher\u2019s were on the losing side. The U.S.\nSupreme Court refused to strike down laws banning assisted suicide,\ninstead upholding state laws in New York and Washington that\ncriminalized physician-assisted suicide. The Court argued that states\nhave an interest in protecting life, protecting the poor and the\ndisabled, and promoting physicians\u2019 ethical integrity.\nPatient\u2019s rights groups had argued that laws banning physician\nassisted suicide violated the privacy and equality rights of people\nwith terminal illnesses.\n\nAccording to what came to be known as \u201cThe Philosophers\u2019\nBrief\u201d, signed by Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick,\nJohn Rawls, Thomas Scanlon, and Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1997 in\nconnection with the United States Supreme Court case, Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997),\n\n\nA person\u2019s interest in following his own convictions at the end\nof life is so central a part of the more general right to make\n\u2018intimate and personal choices\u2019 for himself that a failure\nto protect that particular interest would undermine the general right\naltogether. Death is, for each of us, among the most significant\nevents of life. (Dworkin et al. 1997 [2007] pp.548\u2013561)\n\n\nThe Brief went on to argue that there is little moral difference\nbetween allowing an authorized physician to administer a life-ending\ninjection on behalf of a terminally ill patient and allowing an\nauthorized physician to turn off the respirator or remove the feeding\ntube of a person in a vegetative coma.\n\nThe 2007 Theresa Schiavo case raised the philosophically important\nquestion of when it is ethical to exercise privacy rights. A Florida\ncourt allowed spouse Michael Schiavo to terminate life support on wife\nTerri\u2019s behalf, after the court found that Terri\u2019s\nautonomous choice would have been to refuse life-sustaining care if\nshe were hopelessly comatose. Since the age of twenty-five, Terri had\nsubsisted in a \u201cpersistent vegetative coma\u201d. Autopsy\nestablished that Terri had massive and irreversible brain damage, as\nher husband believed. Terri\u2019s parents had doubted the diagnosis\nof hopeless coma and wanted their daughter alive. Assuming Michael\nSchiavo was justified in ignoring the pleas of strangers who wanted\nhim to keep his wife alive, it is less clear that he was justified in\nturning down the pleas of his wife\u2019s own parents, who urged\nSchiavo to waive his wife\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d and offered to\nassume complete responsibility for her care. What are the obligations\nof kin to honor the care and kinship wishes of fellow family members?\nWhat weight do privacy arguments on behalf of an incompetent spouse\nhave in the face of parental claims?\n6. Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers have identified and debated several meanings of\n\u201cprivacy\u201d deployed in medical contexts. Respect for\nrecognized forms of privacy \u2014informational\n (Section 1),\n physical\n (Section 2),\n associational\n (Section 3),\n proprietary\n (Section 4)\n and decisional\n (Section 5)\u2014is\n an ideal of biomedical ethics for the conduct of clinical research\nand administrative practices relating to physical and behavioral\nhealth. There is wide philosophical consensus about the importance of\nmedical confidentiality, modesty and bodily integrity in all health\nsettings; but substantial philosophical disagreement about the limits\nof personal autonomy or individual choice in fields relating to\ncontagious diseases, human reproduction and genetics. Recently,\nsharing medical information with family friends and the general public\nvoluntarily has supplanted norms of secrecy prompted by shame and\nstigma. Moreover, voluntarily sharing medical data is widely\nencouraged by researchers and officials to promote public health and\nprecision medicine. As digital medical data technologies, mobile\nhealth care apps, telemedicine, public health surveillance, and brain\nimaging technologies expand, the range and complexity of important\nprivacy questions in medicine will also expand. \n",
