In the decades following WW II increasing numbers of women\nentered the labor force. Divorce rates increased dramatically: the\ndivorce rate in the 1980s was almost two and a half times what it had\nbeen in 1940. The development of the birth control pill has made it\neasier for women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and to plan when to have\nchildren. There are a growing number of single parent families, gay\nfamilies, and extended families. By 1989, 25% of children were living\nin single parent households, many of which were poor, prompting a sense\nthat the family was in crisis (Minow 1997). Economic, technological\nand social factors have together made the full time-stay at home\nhousewife and mother with a working husband a statistical minority.\n\n\nLaws governing families have also changed. Modern laws are more\nlikely to view men and women as equals, who can be subjected to the\nauthority of each other only with their own consent. In almost all\ndeveloped nations, legal restrictions on marriage, divorce and abortion\nwere relaxed in a relatively short time, between the mid 1960s and the\nmid-1980s (Glendon 1987). In Loving v Virginia, for example,\nthe US Supreme Court struck down state laws preventing people from\ndifferent races from marrying; Roe v Wade legalized abortion.\nOf course, many of these changes have been contested and there remain\nserious constraints on women's reproductive choices. Nor can gay people\nusually marry, although laws and norms have been evolving in favor of gay marriage (see, most recently: Hollingsworth v. Perry; United States v. Windsor). The family has\nincreasingly evolved from a hierarchical institution based on a fixed\nstatus to a set of relationships between individuals based on contract.\nIndeed, many people now view marriage not as an unalterable condition,\nbut as a contract whose terms can be altered and negotiated by the\nparties involved.\n\n\nHow far should the contract idea of marriage be taken? Some\nfeminists have proposed extending the contract model to allow any and\nall consenting adults to marry and to freely choose the terms of their\nassociation. These feminists would abolish state-defined marriage\naltogether and replace it with individual contracts drawn up by each\ncouple wanting to marry (Fineman 1995, Weitzman 1985). Indeed,\ncontracts would allow not only gay couples to marry but would also\nallow plural marriages, as in the case of polygamy.\n\n\nContract or choice based feminists would allow individuals\nthemselves to determine what kinds of families they want to create.\nThus, they would allow people to make their own agreements about\nprocreation without state restriction. These arrangements could include\nnot only rights to abortion and contraception, but also rights to\ncontract away parental bonds and to sell and buy gametes and\nreproductive labor. Thus, choice feminists would allow gay or infertile\ncouples or single persons to contract for sperm or eggs or gestational\nservices before a child is conceived on terms that they alone\ndecide.\n\n\nOn the contract view, the traditionalist's sense that there is a\n\u201ccrisis\u201d surrounding the family is unwarranted. What is in\ncrisis is the nuclear, heterosexual marital unit. But this unit was\nnever good for women (Coontz 1992). Advocates of contract marriage\nargue that extending the role of choice in reproduction and in the\nfamilies we make will empower women. For example, contracting can help\nspur new forms of family, enabling gay couples and single women and\nmen to have children. Gay families have traditionally been more\negalitarian in the division of domestic labor then heterosexual\nfamilies, and less likely to reproduce mothering along gender\nlines. Others argue that allowing women to sell their reproductive\nservices would empower women and improve their welfare by unleashing a\nnew source of economic power (Shalev 1989).\n\n\nIn contrast to the ideal of families as having an internal nature\nbeyond justice, some feminists have even proposed using a marriage\ncontract to determine the domestic division of labor. They argue that\nby moving marriage from an implicit status based, patriarchal\narrangement to an explicit contract, women's freedom and equality would\nbe enhanced (Weitzman 1985). This proposal has been criticized on\nseveral grounds: as inattentive to the background inequalities would\ngive rise to unequal bargaining power in such a contract (Sen 1989);\nas potentially undermining to intimacy and commitment within marriage\n(Anderson 1993) and as opening the door to illiberal intrusions into\nfamily life, given the need for states to enforce such contracts\n(Elshtain 1990).\n\n\nOther feminist authors have criticized the very idea of choice as\napplied to reproduction and marriage. They argue that practices such\nas prostitution, surrogacy or gendered marriages are based on\nobjectionable views of women \u2014 as bodies, as breeders, or as\ndomestic helpmates \u2014 and that these views in fact underlie\nseemingly freely choices to enter these practices. For example,\nCatherine MacKinnon (1989) argues that such choices can as easily be\nviewed as based on subordination and domination as on free consent.\nAnd Carole Pateman (1983) similarly questions the choices alleged to\nunderlie women's decisions to engage in prostitution.\n\n\nHow deep a challenge do these arguments present to the choice based\nview of marriage? Proponents of the choice view might plausibly claim\nthat if men and women could explicitly define the terms of their\nrelationships, and retain a right of exit when the terms were not\nfulfilled, then at least extreme forms of gender domination would be\nundercut. They might also stress the ways that their view accommodates\na plurality of understandings of human relationship: allowing for\nexperimentation, diversity and exit options. It is true that contracts\nwould allow men and women to contract for traditional gendered\nfamilies, but why should we object to such families if they are freely\nentered into and express the values of the participants? Behind this\ndisagreement is an important division over the extent to which a just\nsociety must accommodate different views of family relation. Where does\nsociety draw the line on toleration of hierarchical views of men and\nwomen's roles? When should a view of family form be ruled out of bounds\nbecause it is too inegalitarian?\n",
