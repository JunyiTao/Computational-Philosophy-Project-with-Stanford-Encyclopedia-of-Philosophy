    "main_text": "Equilibrium selection || Salience\n5.1 Salience\n\n\nFollowing Thomas Schelling (1960), who introduced the notion of a\nfocal point, Lewis argues that agents will select the\nsalient convention. A convention is salient (it is a focal\npoint) if it \u201cstands out\u201d from the other choices. A\ncandidate convention might acquire salience through precedent, explicit\nagreement, or its own intrinsic properties. Schelling conducted a\nfamous experiment to illustrate the concept of salience. He asked\nsubjects to choose a time and place to meet a friend on a given day in\nNew York City, without any possibility of prior communication about\nwhere or when to meet. Most respondents chose noon at Grand Central\nStation. Somehow, then, this choice stands out as the most conspicuous.\nAs Schelling\u2019s example illustrates, salience is a\n\u201csubjective\u201d psychological trait that does not follow in\nany obvious way from the rational structure of the strategic situation.\nHume already anticipated a role for subjective psychological traits,\nnoting that our choice of convention often depends upon \u201cthe\nimagination, or the more frivolous properties of our thought and\nconception\u201d (Treatise, p. 504, note 1).\n\n\nSalience plays two distinct roles in Lewis\u2019s account,\ncorresponding to the following two questions: How do conventions\narise? and Why do people conform to convention? The\nformer question concerns dynamics (i.e., the factors governing how\nconventions originate and evolve over time), while the latter concerns\nstatics (specifically, the rational structure that sustains a\nconvention at a given moment). Lewis\u2019s answer to the first\nquestion is that agents initially select some equilibrium either by\nchance, agreement, or intrinsic salience. The equilibrium gradually\nbecomes more salient through precedent, until eventually it becomes a\nconvention. Lewis\u2019s answer to the second question is that a\npre-existing convention is so overwhelmingly salient that agents expect\none another to abide by it, an expectation which furnishes reason to\nconform.\n\n\nPhilosophers have heavily criticized Lewis\u2019s reliance upon\nsalience, arguing that the notion of salience is obscure, or that there\nis often no salient option among candidate conventions, or that\nprecedence does not confer salience, or that Lewis fails to integrate\nsalience into the formal game-theoretic framework that otherwise shapes\nhis discussion. Margaret Gilbert (1989) argues that salience cannot\nprovide a reason for action: merely observing that some possible\nconvention is salient tells us nothing, because we cannot assume that\nothers will abide by the most salient convention. In a similar vein,\nBrian Skyrms (1996) asks how it comes to be common knowledge that\nothers will choose the salient equilibrium over the alternatives.\n\n\nDespite these criticisms, many authors over the intervening decades,\nsuch as Robert Sugden (1986/2004, 2011) and Ken Binmore and Larry Samuelson\n(2006), have argued that a satisfactory theory of equilibrium selection\nrequires something like Lewis\u2019s notion of salience. Note also\nthat, even if the foregoing criticisms are legitimate, they do not\nimpugn Lewis\u2019s analysis of what conventions are. They\nonly show that Lewis has not offered a complete theory of how\nconventions are chosen, how they evolve, and how they sustain\nthemselves.\n",
