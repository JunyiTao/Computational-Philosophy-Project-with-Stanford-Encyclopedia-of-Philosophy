    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory || Two models of Linguistic Communication\n3.1 Two models of Linguistic Communication\n\nAccording to the coding model, communication consists in a sender and\na receiver sharing a common code or language and a channel, so that\nthe former encodes the message and sends it for the latter to decode\nit. Communication is, following this picture, quite an easy matter. It\njust amounts to knowledge of language and a safe channel \u2014 i.e.,\nwithout too much \u2018noise.\u2019 If sender and receiver share the\nknowledge of the code and the message makes its way through the\nchannel the success of communication is guaranteed.\n\nOne of Grice\u2019s major contributions to the theory of\ncommunication was provision of an alternative to the Locke-Saussure\nmodel of communication as a coding and decoding of thoughts. One can\nthink of the alternative either as a supplement or a replacement for\nthe coding model.\n\nIntentions and their recognition are at the heart of Grice\u2019s\nalternative. Even if the interpreter\u2019s reasoning is guided by\nthe conversational principle or maxims, as Grice suggested,\nintention-recognition is not basically a matter of following\nconventional rules, but ampliative reasoning about what is going on in\nother minds.\n\nBut how do the two models fit together? Is language mainly and\ncentrally a matter of deduction, of coding and decoding according to\nthe conventions of meaning, with a little intention-recognition around\nthe near and far edges to take care of ambiguity and implicature? Or\nis communication mainly a matter of acting in ways that get\none\u2019s intentions recognized, with the conventions of language\nbeing just a helpful resource for accomplishing this?\n\nIn the classical period, near-side pragmatics tended to be ignored,\nand the Gricean model applied only to issues beyond saying; all of\nthis is consistent with the first picture. Many neo-Griceans still\nadopt much of the first picture, and see the core of language as an\nautonomous realm studied by semantics, in which the meanings of parts\ncompositionally determine the meanings of wholes, the fundamental\nconcept of meaning being the truth-conditions of sentences.\nGrice\u2019s work is often used to bolster this picture; Gricean\nconsiderations serve as a sort of shock-absorber, where apparent data\nthat are difficult to handle on the autonomous-semantics picture are\ntreated as merely apparent, resulting from mistaking implicatures for\n\u2018semantic content.\u2019 Recanati calls such theorists\n\u2018minimalists;\u2019 (see 3.4 below) while no one denies that\ncontextual facts and pragmatic reasoning are needed at the near side\nof what is said, according to these theorists, there is\nminimal intrusion of such considerations on autonomous\nsemantics.\n",
