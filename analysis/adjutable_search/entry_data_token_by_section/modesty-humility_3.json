    "main_text": "Modesty and Humility || Normative Status\n1.3 Normative Status\n\n\nIn addition to the descriptive features outlined above, accounts of\nmodesty and humility also aim to explain its normative\nstatus\u2014why does modesty or humility count as a virtue? Most\ncontemporary work assumes that modesty and humility are genuine moral\nvirtues. Of course, not all philosophers have agreed. Aristotle and\nDavid Hume in particular are often singled out as denying that modesty\nor humility really are virtuous.\n\n\nRaterman (2006, 222) and Brennan (2007, 112) both claim that\nAristotle denies that modesty is a virtue, as he thinks that a virtuous\nperson is justified in making claims about their own merit. Some have\nalso had a hard time squaring virtues like modesty and humility with\nAristotle\u2019s ideal of the great-souled man\n(megalopsuchos), who deserves honors and knows it (see\nNicomachean Ethics IV.3). \nThose working in a religious context influenced by Aristotle have to\nbalance these competing ideals; see Foley (2004, 407ff.) and McCloskey\n(2006, 183). Some passages used to support the idea that Aristotle\ndenies modesty is a virtue (Nicomachean Ethics 1108a32 and\n1128b10\u201335) concern the Greek term aid\u014ds, which is\nsometimes translated as \u2018modesty\u2019 but also commonly\nrendered as \u2018shame\u2019. Some modern interpreters have drawn\nfrom Aristotle to support the idea that modesty is a virtue:\nDriver (1989, 380) notes that Aristotle says the truthful person is\ninclined to understate the truth (Nicomachean Ethics\n1127b4\u20138), Winter (2012) draws heavily from Aristotle in\ndefending modesty as a virtue, and Hazlett (2012) defends intellectual\nhumility as an Aristotelian mean state between dogmatism and\ntimidity. Whatever Aristotle\u2019s view of modesty, other Greek\nphilosophers use the term\naid\u014ds to name a virtue. Epictetus, for example, uses it\nto refer to a good quality that involves taking other people\u2019s\n point of view into consideration; see\n Epictetus: Appropriate Other-Concern\n and the discussion in Kamtekar (1998).\n\n\nHume is another historical figure who at least doubted whether modesty\nis a virtue. Hume includes modesty in his list of \u201cmonkish\nvirtues\u201d\u2014various non-virtuous traits associated with\nself-denial that masquerade as virtues. Other examples of monkish\nvirtues given by Hume include celibacy, fasting, silence, and\nsolitude. According to Hume these pseudo-virtues \u201c\u2026\nstupefy the understanding and harden the heart, obscure the fancy and\nsour the temper\u201d (Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nMorals sec. IX). Elsewhere, however, Hume seems more positive\nabout modesty as when he writes:\n\n\nBut its [modesty\u2019s] most usual meaning is when it is opposed to\nimpudence and arrogance, and expresses a diffidence of our own\njudgement, and a due attention and regard for others. In young men\nchiefly, this quality is a sure sign of good sense; and is also the\ncertain means of augmenting that endowment, by preserving their ears\nopen to instruction, and making them still grasp after new\nattainments. But it has a further charm to every spectator; by\nflattering every man\u2019s vanity, and presenting the appearance of\na docile pupil, who receives, with proper attention and respect, every\nword they utter. (Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\nsec. VIII)\n\n\nHume takes virtues to be qualities that are useful or agreeable but\nseems to have had mixed feelings about modesty at least. Davie (1999)\nand Reed (2012) have argued that the so-called monkish virtues may\ncount as virtues even by Hume\u2019s standard.\n\n\nModesty\u2019s status as a virtue has been liminal for other figures\ntoo. Benjamin Franklin initially excluded humility when drawing up a\nlist of virtues he wished to develop. He added it only after a Quaker\nfriend mentioned that Franklin was often overbearing and insolent in\nconversation (1771/1982, 84). His description of humility reads\nsimply: \u201cImitate Jesus and Socrates\u201d (77). This\nanticipates contemporary discussion of intellectual humility and its\nrole as both a moral and epistemic virtue.\n\n\nAgain, the bulk of contemporary work assumes that modesty and humility\nare virtues and sees the main challenge as explaining why. For many it\nwas seen as valuable because of its theological role: Aquinas says\nthat humility is important because it makes one open to God\u2019s\ngrace (see Summa Theologica 2.2 Q.161 and Keys 2003). Others\nhave found it virtuous because of the non-religious good effects it\nproduces, like combating jealousy and making social interactions run\nmore smoothly. Others locate the source of its virtuousness in the\nunderlying attitude it manifests, things like kindness and concern for\nothers. Still others argue that it is virtuous because it is a fitting\nresponse to certain morally relevant features of the world like the\nequal moral status of all people. What modesty is and why it is\nvaluable are related questions and the following sections will give an\noverview of contemporary views on both questions.\n\n\nThe following presentation of the various contemporary views of\nmodesty and humility will focus on presenting only the positive\naccounts and not objections to the various positions. The dialectic of\nthe literature typically takes the form of examples and\ncounter-examples, many of which require a good deal of description to\nbe compelling. So in the interest of space, the descriptions of the\nvarious views will focus on presenting only the positive accounts.\n",
