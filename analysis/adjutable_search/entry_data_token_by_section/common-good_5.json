    "main_text": "Central Features of the Common Good || A Set of Common Facilities\n4.2 A Set of Common Facilities\n\nMost conceptions of the common good identify a set of facilities that\ncitizens have a special obligation to maintain in virtue of the fact\nthat these facilities serve certain common interests. The relevant\nfacilities may be part of the natural environment (e.g., the\natmosphere, a freshwater aquifer, etc.) or human artifacts (e.g.,\nhospitals, schools, etc.). But the most important facilities in the\nliterature are social institutions and practices. For example, a\nscheme of private property exists when members of a community conform\nto rules that assign individuals certain forms of authority over\nexternal objects. Private property, as a social institution, serves a\ncommon interest of citizens in being able to assert private control\nover their physical environment, and so many conceptions include this\ninstitution as part of the common good.\n",
