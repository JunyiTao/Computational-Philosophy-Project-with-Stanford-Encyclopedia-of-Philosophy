In the 1920s Brouwer developed a general\ntechnique for constructing weak counterexamples which also made it\npossible to widen their scope and include principles of analysis. The\ndevelopment began in 1921, when Brouwer gave a weak counterexample to\nthe proposition that every real number has a decimal expansion\n(Brouwer 1921A). The argument proceeded by defining real numbers whose\ndecimal developments are dependent on specific open problems\nconcerning the decimal development of \\(\\pi\\). Brouwer closed by\nobserving that, should these open problems be solved, then other real\nnumbers without decimal expansion can be defined (Brouwer 1921A: 210\n[Mancosu 1998: 34]). The general technique was made explicit in a\nlecture from 1923 (Brouwer 1924N: 3 and footnote 4 [van Heijenoort\n1967: 337 and footnote 5]) and reached its perfection with the\n\u201coscillatory number\u201d method in the first Vienna lecture in\n1928 (Brouwer 1929A: 161 [Mancosu 1998: 51]). The method involves the\nreduction of the validity of a mathematical principle to the\nsolvability of an open problem of the following type: we have a\ndecidable property \\(P\\) (defined on the natural\nnumbers) for which we have as yet shown neither \\(\\exists xP(x)\\) nor\n\\(\\forall x\\neg P(x)\\). This reduction is carried out in such a way\nthat it only uses the fact that \\(P\\) induces an open\nproblem of this type, and does not depend on the exact definition of\n\\(P\\); that is, if the open problem is solved, one can\nsimply replace it by another one of the same type, and exactly the\nsame reduction still works. This uniformity means that, as long as\nthere are open problems of this type at all (and this is practically\ncertain at any time), there is no intuitionistic proof of the general\nmathematical principle in question. In the 1920s, Brouwer constructed\nweak counterexamples to the following general mathematical\npropositions, among others (where \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) stands for the set of\nintuitionistic real numbers, and \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) for the set of\nrationals):\n\nThe continuum is totally ordered (Brouwer 1924N)\nEvery set is either finite or infinite (Brouwer 1924N)\nThe Heine-Borel theorem (Brouwer 1924N)\n\\(\\forall x \\in \\mathbf{R}(x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\vee x \\not\\in\n\\mathbf{Q})\\) (Brouwer 1925E)\nAny two straight lines in the Euclidean plane are either parallel,\nor coincide, or intersect (Brouwer 1929A)\nEvery infinite sequence of positive numbers either converges or\ndiverges (Brouwer 1929A)\n\n",
