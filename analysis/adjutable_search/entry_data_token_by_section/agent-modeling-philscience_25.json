But how seriously should we take each\nof these findings? What exactly do they tell us about science? Given\nthat one of the main cognitive functions of models in science is to\nhelp us to learn about the world (cf. the entry on\n models in science),\n this raises the question: what exactly can we learn with ABMs, and\nwhich methodological steps do we have to follow to acquire such\nknowledge? These issues are a matter of the epistemology of\nagent-based\n modeling.[13]\n\n",
