    "main_text": "The Conservation Biology Framing || Concluding observations\n5.4 Concluding observations\n\nSarkar (2019: 375) claims that \u201cthe term\n\u201dbiodiversity\u201c and the associated concept(s)\u201d arose\nalong with the discipline of conservation biology. This accords with\nthe deflationist and eliminativist perspectives that the\n\u201cbiodiversity story\u201d began around 1985, with conservation\nbiology guiding the conceptual development of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d, including its definition and values. This\nnarrative does not address the earlier conceptual history that had\narticulated normative value of living variation, and so it raises the\nneed for comparisons with that \u201cvariationist\u201d framing.\n\nThe SEP entry\n conservation biology\n provides some basis for comparisons, in exploring the idea that\nconservation biology is all about a still-undefined concept of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d. In the entry\u2019s section\n what is biodiversity?\n there are no citations of the early discussions from the 1970s, and\nso there is perhaps an under-appreciation of the early ideas of\nvariety as a possible guide to resolving questions of definition. This\nrelates to the interesting issues raised in this section about how the\nconcept/definition of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is supposed to cope\nwith the dis-benefits of some individual species. The challenge\nremains to recognise the possible useful distinction between\nbiodiversity/variety and biospecifics (individual elements).\n\nConsideration of the pre-history of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\nsuggests that the conservation biology framing has adopted a\nstory-line that is a disservice to systematics/taxonomy. As noted\nabove, Sarkar (2017, 2019) follows his claim that the\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d term (and concept) were introduced in the\ncontext of the establishment of conservation biology, with the claim\nthat\n\n\nSubsequently, the term and the concept were embraced by other\ndisciplines particularly by taxonomists\u2026. as a conduit for\nfunding that taxonomists wanted to exploit\u2026.\n\n\nThe pre-history, in contrast, reveals how the concept in fact arose\nthrough the work of systematists (e.g., Iltis 1972; Anonymous 1974),\nand was followed by calls by Wilson (1985) and others (see above) for\nmore systematic efforts, in order to fill knowledge gaps (see also\nLean, 2017).\n\nThe conservation biology framing highlights individual elements that\nare valuable, with less emphasis on variety. For example, Sarkar\nargues that conservation logically will focus on \u201cthose aspects\nof biotic variety that should be conserved. That does not necessarily\ninclude all of natural variety\u201d (Sarkar 2019: 17).\nSarkar\u2019s example is revealing:\n\n\nThe human skin hosts thousands of microbial species though\ninterpersonal variability is not as high as in the gut which hosts\nmillions\u2026 Should we feel an imperative to conserve all the\nmicrobial diversity on the human skin or gut?\n\n\nThis sounds like a powerful example\u2014who likes germs? The\nquestion in reality reveals an absence of consideration of the\nestablished benefits and values of variety itself. The gut microbial\ncontext is particularly revealing\u2014over the past decade or so,\nreductions in an individuals\u2019 variety of gut microbes (e.g., as\nmeasured using the PD biodiversity measure) is now associated with\nmore than a dozen different human diseases. This biodiversity possibly\nprovides a kind of insurance benefit in healthy individuals (see the\nlink to \u201cPhylogenetic Diversity and Human Health\u201d, in\n Other Internet Resources;\n for other philosophical issues related to microbial biodiversity, see\nMalaterre 2017).\n\nA related conceptual disconnect is apparent also in Sarkar\u2019s\n(2017) claim,\n\n\nfor a concept of biodiversity that can be used in practice for\ninstance in the selection of conservation areas, richness was shown to\nbe inadequate in the 1980s.\n\n\nIn contrast, variety or \u201crichness\u201d clearly is the\ndesirable property of the set of conservation areas, and we use parts\nof the biodiversity \u201ccalculus\u201d (see above), such as the\ncomplementarity of individual areas, in order to maximise this\nproperty of a nominated set. According to \u201cvariationists\u201d,\nthe concept of biodiversity as variety/richness is exactly what is\nneeded to address the biodiversity crisis (Faith 2017).\n\nAbsence of recognition of the historical link between variety and\nnormativity also suggests contrasts. The idea that\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d is the business of conservation biology,\nand that biodiversity is good, implies that,\n\n\nif there is no adequate normative basis for biodiversity conservation,\nconservation biology becomes a dubious enterprise because its explicit\npurpose is the conservation of biodiversity.\n\n\nThe storyline is that conservation biology is normatively oriented,\nand so we have to find a definition of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d that\nmatches that normativity. In contrast, variationists would suggest the\nopposite: that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is normatively oriented, and\nthen we have to find a \u201cconservation biology\u201d that\naddresses that normativity. Sarkar concludes that\n\n\nhow \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is defined, that is, what the\n\u201cconstituents\u201d of biodiversity are, depends on cultural\nchoices about which natural values to endorse for conservation.\n\n\nAs noted above, the constituents of interest can include things like\nsacred groves, and processes like annual migration of Monarch\nbutterflies (Sarkar 2019). Thus, this framing does not recognise\nbiodiversity-as-variety, and its current benefit and normativity;\ninstead, it looks for the elements that may be conserved with some\nnormativity, and calls that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d.\n\nThere seems to have been a logical development of arguments in the\nconservation framing\u2014conservation biology was regarded as\nnormatively all about \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\u2014a term\ninterpreted as having no clear definition, and so to be defined by\nwhatever conservation might normatively focus on\u2014then arguments\nasserted that conservation focuses in practice on lots of things, and\nthat this was a burden too great for the term. Not yet considered, in\nthe development of philosophical arguments for the conservation\nbiology framing, is the possibility that a miss-step was made right at\nthe beginning\u2014ignoring the preceding long history of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d interpreted as variety, with current\nbenefit to humanity, and normative import.\n\nEliminativists want to get rid of the term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d,\nwith the claim that this would allow for a clearer connection between\nhumanity\u2019s interests in the environment and conservation\npractice. But this is just one of at least three proposed fates for\nthe problematic term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d. Those advocating core\nbiodiversity definitions and values based on variety (call them\n\u201cvariationists\u201d, see also Burch-Brown and Archer 2017),\nmight advocate adoption of this basic definition, with the claim that\nit not only accords best with the extinction crisis and core\nanthropocentric values (including insurance and investment), but also\neffectively allows trade-offs and synergies with humanity\u2019s\nother interests.\n\nA third pathway is discussed in the next section\u2014where the fate\nof the problematic term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is not to be\neliminativism, nor back-to-basics variationism, but is to be a kind of\n\u201cholism\u201d\u2014\u201cbiodiversity\u201d expanded in\nmeaning to cover the whole range of \u201csocio-ecological\u201d or\nhuman-nature links.\n",
