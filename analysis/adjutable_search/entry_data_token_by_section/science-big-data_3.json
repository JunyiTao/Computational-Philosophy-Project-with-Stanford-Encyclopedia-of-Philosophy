    "main_text": "The Nature of (Big) Data\n4. The Nature of (Big) Data\n\nResearch on big data analysis thus sheds light on elements of the\nresearch process that cannot be fully controlled, rationalised or even\nconsidered through recourse to formal tools.\n One such element is the work required to present empirical data in\na machine-readable format that is compatible with the software and\nanalytic tools at hand. Data need to be selected, cleaned and prepared\nto be subjected to statistical and computational analysis. The\nprocesses involved in separating data from noise, clustering data so\nthat it is tractable, and integrating data of different formats turn\nout to be highly sophisticated and theoretically structured, as\ndemonstrated for instance by James McAllister\u2019s (1997, 2007,\n2011) and Uljana Feest\u2019s (2011) work on data patterns, Marcel\nBoumans\u2019s and Leonelli\u2019s comparison of clustering\nprinciples across fields (forthcoming), and James Griesemer\u2019s\n(forthcoming) and Mary Morgan\u2019s (forthcoming) analyses of the\npeculiarities of datasets. Suppes was so concerned by what he called\nthe \u201cbewildering complexity\u201d of data production and\nprocessing activities, that he worried that philosophers would not\nappreciate the ways in which statistics can and does help scientists\nto abstract data away from such complexity. He described the large\ngroup of research components and activities used to prepare data for\nmodelling as \u201cpragmatic aspects\u201d encompassing \u201cevery\nintuitive consideration of experimental design that involved no formal\nstatistics\u201d (Suppes 1962: 258), and positioned them as the\nlowest step of his hierarchy of models\u2014at the opposite end of\nits pinnacle, which are models of theory. Despite recent efforts to\nrehabilitate the methodology of inductive-statistical modelling and\ninference (Mayo & Spanos 2009b), this approach has been shared by\nmany philosophers who regard processes of data production and\nprocessing as so chaotic as to defy systematic analysis. This explains\nwhy data have received so little consideration in philosophy of\nscience when compared to models and theory.\n\nThe question of how data are defined and identified, however, is\ncrucial for understanding the role of big data in scientific research.\nLet us now consider two philosophical views\u2014the\nrepresentational view and the relational\nview\u2014that are both compatible with the emergence of big\ndata, and yet place emphasis on different aspects of that phenomenon,\nwith significant implications for understanding the role of data\nwithin inferential reasoning and, as we shall see in the next section,\nas evidence. The representational view construes data as\nreliable representations of reality which are produced via the\ninteraction between humans and the world. The interactions that\ngenerate data can take place in any social setting regardless of\nresearch purposes. Examples range from a biologist measuring the\ncircumference of a cell in the lab and noting the result in an Excel\nfile, to a teacher counting the number of students in her class and\ntranscribing it in the class register. What counts as data in these\ninteractions are the objects created in the process of description\nand/or measurement of the world. These objects can be digital (the\nExcel file) or physical (the class register) and form a footprint of a\nspecific interaction with the natural world. This\nfootprint\u2014\u201ctrace\u201d or \u201cmark\u201d, in the\nwords of Ian Hacking (1992) and Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger (2011),\nrespectively\u2014constitutes a crucial reference point for analytic\nstudy and for the extraction of new insights. This is the reason why\ndata forms a legitimate foundation to empirical knowledge: the\nproduction of data is equivalent to \u201ccapturing\u201d features\nof the world that can be used for systematic study. According to the\nrepresentative approach, data are objects with fixed and unchangeable\ncontent, whose meaning, in virtue of being representations of reality,\nneeds to be investigated and revealed step-by-step through adequate\ninferential methods. The data documenting cell shape can be modelled\nto test the relevance of shape to the elasticity, permeability and\nresilience of cells, producing an evidence base to understand\ncell-to-cell signalling and development. The data produced counting\nstudents in class can be aggregated with similar data collected in\nother schools, producing an evidence base to evaluate the density of\nstudents in the area and their school attendance frequency.\n\nThis reflects the intuition that data, especially when they come in\nthe form of numerical measurements or images such as photographs,\nsomehow mirror the phenomena that they are created to document, thus\nproviding a snapshot of those phenomena that is amenable to study\nunder the controlled conditions of research. It also reflects the idea\nof data as \u201craw\u201d products of research, which are as close\nas it gets to unmediated knowledge of reality. This makes sense of the\ntruth-value sometimes assigned to data as irrefutable sources of\nevidence\u2014the Popperian idea that if data are found to support a\ngiven claim, then that claim is corroborated as true at least as long\nas no other data are found to disprove it. Data in this view represent\nan objective foundation for the acquisition of knowledge and this very\nobjectivity\u2014the ability to derive knowledge from human\nexperience while transcending it\u2014is what makes knowledge\nempirical. This position is well-aligned with the idea that big data\nis valuable to science because it facilitates the (broadly understood)\ninductive accumulation of knowledge: gathering data collected via\nreliable methods produces a mountain of facts ready to be analysed\nand, the more facts are produced and connected with each other, the\nmore knowledge can be extracted.\n\nPhilosophers have long acknowledged that data do not speak for\nthemselves and different types of data require different tools for\nanalysis and preparation to be interpreted (Bogen 2009 [2013]).\nAccording to the representative view, there are correct and incorrect\nways of interpreting data, which those responsible for data analysis\nneed to uncover. But what is a \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation in\nthe realm of big data, where data are consistently treated as mobile\nentities that can, at least in principle, be reused in countless\ndifferent ways and towards different objectives? Perhaps more than at\nany other time in the history of science, the current mobilisation and\nre-use of big data highlights the degree to which data\ninterpretation\u2014and with it, whatever data is taken to\nrepresent\u2014may differ depending on the conceptual, material and\nsocial conditions of inquiry. The analysis of how big data travels\nacross contexts shows that the expectations and abilities of those\ninvolved determine not only the way data are interpreted, but also\nwhat is regarded as \u201cdata\u201d in the first place (Leonelli\n& Tempini forthcoming). The representative view of data as objects\nwith fixed and contextually independent meaning is at odds with these\nobservations.\n\nAn alternative approach is to embrace these findings and abandon the\nidea of data as fixed representations of reality altogether. Within\nthe relational view, data are objects that are treated as\npotential or actual evidence for scientific claims in ways that can,\nat least in principle, be scrutinised and accounted for (Leonelli\n2016). The meaning\nassigned to data depends on their provenance, their physical features\nand what these features are taken to represent, and the motivations\nand instruments used to visualise them and to defend specific\ninterpretations. The reliability of data thus depends on the\ncredibility and strictness of the processes used to produce and\nanalyse them. The presentation of data; the way they are identified,\nselected, and included (or excluded) in databases; and the information\nprovided to users to re-contextualise them are fundamental to\nproducing knowledge and significantly influence its content. For\ninstance, changes in data format\u2014as most obviously involved in\ndigitisation, data compression or archival procedures\u2014 can have\na significant impact on where, when, and who uses the data as source\nof knowledge.\n\nThis framework acknowledges that any object can be used as a datum, or\nstop being used as such, depending on the circumstances\u2014a\nconsideration familiar to big data analysts used to pick and mix data\ncoming from a vast variety of sources. The relational view also\nexplains how, depending on the research perspective interpreting it,\nthe same dataset may be used to represent different aspects of the\nworld (\u201cphenomena\u201d as famously characterised by James\nBogen and James Woodward, 1988). When considering the full cycle of\nscientific inquiry from the viewpoint of data production and analysis,\nit is at the stage of data modelling that a specific\nrepresentational value is attributed to data (Leonelli 2019b).\n\nThe relational view of data encourages attention to the history of\ndata, highlighting their continual evolution and sometimes radical\nalteration, and the impact of this feature on the power of data to\nconfirm or refute hypotheses. It explains the critical importance of\ndocumenting data management and transformation processes, especially\nwith big data that transit far and wide over digital channels and are\ngrouped and interpreted in different ways and formats. It also\nexplains the increasing recognition of the expertise of those who\nproduce, curate, and analyse data as indispensable to the effective\ninterpretation of big data within and beyond the sciences; and the\ninextricable link between social and ethical concerns around the\npotential impact of data sharing and scientific concerns around the\nquality, validity, and security of data (boyd & Crawford 2012;\nTempini & Leonelli, 2018).\n\nDepending on which view on data one takes, expectations around what\nbig data can do for science will vary dramatically. The\nrepresentational view accommodates the idea of big data as providing\nthe most comprehensive, reliable and generative knowledge base ever\nwitnessed in the history of science, by virtue of its sheer size and\nheterogeneity. The relational view makes no such commitment, focusing\ninstead on what inferences are being drawn from such data at any given\npoint, how and why.\n",
