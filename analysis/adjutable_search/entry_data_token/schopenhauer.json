Often considered to be a thoroughgoing\npessimist, Schopenhauer in fact advocated ways \u2013 via artistic,\nmoral and ascetic forms of awareness \u2013 to overcome a\nfrustration-filled and fundamentally painful human condition.

Life: 1788\u20131860\n\nExactly a month younger than the English Romantic poet, Lord Byron\n(1788\u20131824), who was born on January 22, 1788, Arthur\nSchopenhauer came into the world on February 22, 1788 in Danzig\n[Gdansk, Poland] \u2013 a city that had a long history in\ninternational trade as a member of the Hanseatic League. The\nSchopenhauer family was of Dutch heritage, and the philosopher\u2019s\nfather, Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer (1747\u20131805), was a\nsuccessful merchant and shipowner who groomed his son to assume\ncontrol of the family\u2019s business. A future in the international\nbusiness trade was envisioned from the day Arthur was born, as\nreflected in how Schopenhauer\u2019s father carefully chose his\nson\u2019s first name on account of its identical spelling in German,\nFrench and English. In March 1793, when Schopenhauer was five years\nold, his family moved to the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg after\nthe formerly free city of Danzig was annexed by Prussia.\n\nSchopenhauer toured through Europe several times with his family as a\nyoungster and young teenager, and lived in France (1797\u201399)\n[ages 9\u201311] and England (1803) [age 15], where he learned the\nlanguages of those countries. As he later reported, his experiences in\nFrance were among the happiest of his life. The memories of his stay\nat a strict, Anglican-managed boarding school in Wimbledon were rather\nagonized in contrast, and this set him against the English style of\nChristianity for the rest of his life.\n\nThe professional occupations of a merchant or banker were not\nsufficiently consistent with Schopenhauer\u2019s scholarly\ndisposition, and although for two years after his father\u2019s death\n(in Hamburg, April 20, 1805; possibly by suicide, when Schopenhauer\nwas seventeen) he continued to respect the commercial aspirations his\nfather had had for him, he finally left his Hamburg business\napprenticeship at age 19 to prepare for university studies. In the\nmeantime, his mother, Johanna Henriette Troisiener Schopenhauer\n(1766\u20131838), who was the daughter of a city senator, along with\nSchopenhauer\u2019s sister, Luise Adelaide [Adele] Lavinia\nSchopenhauer (1797\u20131849), left their Hamburg home at Neuer\nWandrahm 92 and moved to Weimar after Heinrich Floris\u2019s death,\nwhere Johanna established a friendship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n(1749\u20131832). In Weimar, Goethe frequently visited\nJohanna\u2019s intellectual salon, and Johanna Schopenhauer became a\nwell-known writer of the period, producing a voluminous assortment of\nessays, travelogues, novels (e.g., Gabriele [1819], Die\nTante [1823], Sidonia [1827], Richard Wood\n[1837]), and biographies, such as her accounts of the German art\ncritic, archaeologist, and close friend, Carl Ludwig Fernow\n(1763\u20131808), and of the Flemish painter, Jan van Eyck\n(c.1390\u20131441), published in 1810 and 1822 respectively. Her\ncomplete works total twenty-four volumes.\n\nIn 1809, Schopenhauer began studies at the University of\nG\u00f6ttingen, where he remained for two years, first majoring in\nmedicine, and then, philosophy. In G\u00f6ttingen, he absorbed the\nviews of the skeptical philosopher, Gottlob Ernst Schulze\n(1761\u20131833), who introduced him to Plato and Kant. Schopenhauer\nnext enrolled at the University of Berlin (1811\u201313), where his\nlecturers included Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762\u20131814) and\nFriedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834). His university studies in\nG\u00f6ttingen and Berlin included courses in physics, psychology,\nastronomy, zoology, archaeology, physiology, history, literature, and\npoetry. At age 25, and ready to write his doctoral dissertation,\nSchopenhauer moved in 1813 to Rudolstadt, a small town located a short\ndistance southwest of Jena, where he lodged for the duration in an inn\nnamed Zum Ritter. Entitling his work The Fourfold Root of\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason (\u00dcber die vierfache\nWurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde), it formed the\ncenterpiece of his later philosophy, articulating arguments he would\nlater use to criticize as charlatans, the prevailing German Idealistic\nphilosophers of the time, namely, his former lecturer, J. G. Fichte,\nalong with F. W. J. Schelling (1775\u20131854) and G. W. F. Hegel\n(1770\u20131831). In that same year, Schopenhauer submitted his\ndissertation to the nearby University of Jena and was awarded a\ndoctorate in philosophy in absentia. \n\nLeaving his mother\u2019s apartment in 1814 where he had been\nresiding briefly, Schopenhauer moved to Dresden, where he lived until\n1818. There he developed ideas from The Fourfold Root into\nhis most famous book, The World as Will and Representation,\nthat was completed in March of 1818 and published in December of that\nsame year (with the date, 1819). In sympathy with Goethe\u2019s\ntheory of color, he also wrote On Vision and Colors (1816)\nduring this time. In Dresden, Schopenhauer developed an acquaintance\nwith the philosopher and freemason, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause\n(1781\u20131832), who had also been one of Fichte\u2019s students in\nBerlin, whose own panentheistic views appear to have been influential.\nPanentheism (i.e., all-in-God), as opposed to pantheism (i.e.,\nall-is-God), is the view that what we can comprehend and imagine to be\nthe universe is an aspect of God, but that the being of God is in\nexcess of this, and is neither identical with, nor exhausted by, the\nuniverse we can imagine and comprehend. As we will see below,\nSchopenhauer sometimes characterized the thing-in-itself in a way\nreminiscent of panentheism.\n\nAfter a year\u2019s vacation in Italy and with The World as Will\nand Representation in hand, Schopenhauer applied for the\nopportunity to lecture at the University of Berlin, the institution at\nwhich he had formerly studied, and where two years earlier (1818),\nHegel had arrived to assume Fichte\u2019s prestigious philosophical\nchair. His experiences in Berlin were less than professionally\nfruitful, however, for in March of 1820, Schopenhauer self-assuredly\nscheduled his class at a time that was simultaneous with Hegel\u2019s\npopular lectures, and few students chose to hear Schopenhauer. Two\nyears later, in 1822, he left his apartment near the University and\ntravelled to Italy for a second time, returning to Munich a year\nlater. He then lived in Mannheim and Dresden in 1824 before tracing\nhis way back to Berlin in 1825. A second attempt to lecture at the\nUniversity of Berlin was unsuccessful, and this disappointment was\ncomplicated by the loss of a lawsuit that had begun several years\nearlier in August, 1821. The dispute issued from an angry\nshoving-match between Schopenhauer and Caroline Luise Marguet (d.\n1852), a 47-year-old seamstress, that occurred in the rooming house\nwhere they were both living. The issue concerned Ms. Marguet\u2019s\nconversing loudly with her associates in the anteroom of\nSchopenhauer\u2019s apartment, making it difficult for him to\nconcentrate on his work. The conversations were apparently a matter of\nroutine that built up Schopenhauer\u2019s animosity, leading to the\nexplosive confrontation.\n\nLeaving Berlin in 1831 in view of a cholera epidemic that was entering\nGermany from Russia, Schopenhauer moved south, first briefly to\nFrankfurt-am-Main, and then to Mannheim. Shortly thereafter, in June\nof 1833, he settled permanently in Frankfurt, where he remained for\nthe next twenty-seven years, residing in an apartment along the river\nMain\u2019s waterfront from 1843 to 1859 at Sch\u00f6ne Aussicht 17,\na few minutes walking distance from Frankfurt\u2019s Judengasse. His\ndaily life, living alone with a succession of pet French poodles, was defined by a deliberate routine:\nSchopenhauer would awake, wash, read and study during the morning\nhours, play his flute, lunch at the Englisher Hof \u2013 a\nfashionable inn at the city center near the Hauptwache\n\u2013 rest afterwards, read, take an afternoon walk, check the world\nevents as reported in The London Times, sometimes attend\nconcerts in the evenings, and frequently read inspirational texts such\nas the Upanishads before going to sleep. \n\nDuring this later phase of his life, Schopenhauer wrote a short work\nin 1836, \u00dcber den Willen in der Natur (On the Will\nin Nature), that aimed to confirm and reiterate his metaphysical\nviews in light of scientific evidence. Featured in this work are\nchapters on animal magnetism and magic, along with Sinology (Chinese\nstudies). The former reveals Schopenhauer\u2019s interest in\nparapsychology; the latter is valuable for its references to the\npreeminent Neo-Confucian scholar, Zhu Xi (1130-1200), as well as to\ninfluential writers on Asian thought from the period such as Robert\nSpence Hardy (1803\u20131868) and Isaac Jacob Schmidt\n(1779\u20131847).\n\nShortly thereafter in 1839, Schopenhauer completed an essay of which\nhe was immensely proud, \u201cOn the Freedom of Human Will\u201d\n(\u00dcber die Freiheit des menschlichen Willens), that was\nawarded first prize in a competition sponsored by the Royal Norwegian\nSociety of Sciences and Letters in Trondheim. A year later, he\ncomplemented this with a second essay, \u201cOn the Basis of\nMorality\u201d (\u00dcber die Grundlage der Moral) that was\nnot honored with an award by The Royal Danish Society of the Sciences\nin Copenhagen, even though it was the sole submission in their essay\ncompetition. The Society claimed that Schopenhauer did not answer the\nassigned question and that he gravely disrespected philosophers with\noutstanding reputations (viz., Fichte and Hegel). In 1841,\nSchopenhauer defiantly published both essays together as Two\nFundamental Problems of Ethics (Die Beiden Grundprobleme der\nEthik). There soon followed an accompanying volume to The\nWorld as Will and Representation, that was published in 1844\nalong with the first volume in a combined second edition. \n\nIn 1851, Schopenhauer published a lengthy and lively set of\nphilosophical reflections entitled Parerga and Paralipomena\n(appendices and omissions, from the Greek), and within a couple of\nyears, he began to receive the philosophical recognition for which he\nhad long hoped. The recognition was stimulated by a favorable review\nof his philosophy (\u201cIconoclasm in German Philosophy,\u201d by John Oxenford) published in 1853 without signature in the influential Westminster Review, which at the time was under the editorial guidance of George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans).  The review acknowledged the centrality of \u201cWill\u201d within Schopenhauer\u2019s outlook and drew insightful parallels between Schopenhauer\u2019s and\nFichte\u2019s more well-known thought. A year after the third edition\nof The World as Will and Representation appeared with further revisions in 1859,\nSchopenhauer died peacefully on September 21, 1860, in his apartment\nin Frankfurt at Sch\u00f6ne Aussicht 16. He was 72. After his death,\nJulius Frauenst\u00e4dt (1813\u20131879) published new editions of\nmost of Schopenhauer\u2019s works, with the first complete edition\n(six volumes) appearing in 1873. In the 20th century, the editorial\nwork on Schopenhauer\u2019s manuscripts was carried forth in\nauthoritative depth by Arthur H\u00fcbscher (1897\u20131985).\n\nSchopenhauer donated his estate to help disabled Prussian soldiers and\nthe families of those soldiers killed, who had participated in the\nsuppression of the 1848 revolution. An assortment of photographs of\nSchopenhauer was taken during his final years, and although they\nreveal to us an old man, we should appreciate that Schopenhauer\ncompleted his main work, The World as Will and\nRepresentation, by the time he had reached the age of thirty.\n2. The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s PhD dissertation of 1813, The Fourfold Root\nof the Principle of Sufficient Reason, examines what many\nphilosophers have recognized as an innate tendency to assume that in\nprinciple, the universe is a thoroughly understandable place. His\ndissertation, in effect, critically examines the disposition to assume\nthat what is real is what is rational. A century earlier, G.W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) had defined the principle of this assumption \u2013\nthe principle of sufficient reason \u2013 in his Monadology\n(1714) as that which requires us to acknowledge that there is no fact\nor truth that lacks a sufficient reason why it should be so, and not\notherwise.\n\nAlthough the principle of sufficient reason might seem to be\nself-evident, it does yield surprising results. For example, we can\nappeal to this principle to argue that there can be no two individuals\nexactly alike, because there would otherwise be no sufficient reason\nwhy one of the individuals was in one place, while the other\nindividual was in another. The principle also supports the argument\nthat the physical world was not created at any point in time, since\nthere is no sufficient reason why it would be created at one point in\ntime rather than another, since all points in time are qualitatively\nthe same. Moreover, if the principle of sufficient reason\u2019s\nscope of applicability is assumed to be limitless, then there is a\ndefinite answer to the question, \u201cWhy is there something, rather\nthan nothing?\u201d Schopenhauer was keen to question the universal\nextension of the principle of sufficient reason, mainly owing to his\nadvocacy of Kant\u2019s view that human rationality lacks the power\nto answer metaphysical questions, since our knowledge is limited by\nour specific and narrowly-circumscribed capacities for organizing our\nfield of sensation.\n\nSchopenhauer observed as an elementary condition, that to employ the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, we must think about something specific\nthat stands in need of explanation. This indicated to him that at the\nroot of our epistemological situation, we must assume the presence of\na subject that thinks about some object to be\nexplained. From this, he concluded that the general root of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason is the distinction between subject and\nobject that must be presupposed as a condition for the very enterprise\nof looking for explanations (The Fourfold Root, Section 16)\nand as a condition for knowledge in general. \n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s claim that the subject-object distinction is the\nmost general condition for human knowledge has its theoretical source\nin Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, for Kant similarly\ngrounded his own theory of knowledge upon a highly-abstracted,\nformalized, and universalized subject-object distinction. Kant\ncharacterized the subjective pole of the distinction as the\ncontentless transcendental unity of self-consciousness and the\nobjective pole as the contentless transcendental object that\ncorresponds to the concept of an object in general (CPR, A\n109). The general root of the principle of sufficient reason, as\nSchopenhauer characterizes it, is at the root of Kant\u2019s\nepistemology as well. \n\nFollowing the demanding conceptions of knowledge typical of his time\nthat had been inspired by Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s\n(1596\u20131650) quest for certainty (see Descartes\u2019s\n\u201cmethod of doubt\u201d and his \u201ccogito\u201d\n[Latin, for \u201cI think\u201d]), Schopenhauer maintained that if\nany explanation is to be genuine, then whatever is explained cannot be\nthought to have arisen by accident, but must be regarded as having\nbeen necessary. Schopenhauer\u2019s investigation into the principle\nof sufficient reason can thus be alternatively characterized as an\ninquiry into the nature of the various kinds of necessary connection\nthat can arise between different kinds of objects.\n\nInspired by Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the four basic kinds of\nexplanatory reason or four [be]causes (Physics, Book II,\nChapter 3), Schopenhauer defines four kinds of necessary connection\nthat arise within the context of seeking explanations, and he\ncorrespondingly identifies four independent kinds of objects in\nreference to which explanations can be given: \n\nmaterial things\nabstract concepts\nmathematical and geometrical constructions\npsychologically-motivating forces\n\n\nCorresponding to these four kinds of objects, Schopenhauer links in\nparallel, four different kinds of reasoning. He associates material\nthings with reasoning in terms of cause and effect; abstract concepts\nwith reasoning in terms of logic; mathematical and geometrical\nconstructions with reasoning in reference to numbers and spaces; and\nmotivating forces with reasoning in reference to intentions, or what\nhe calls moral reasoning. In sum, he identifies the general root of\nthe principle of sufficient reason as the subject-object distinction\nin conjunction with the thought of necessary connection, and the\nfourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason as the\nspecification of four different kinds of objects for which we can seek\nexplanations, in association with the four independent styles of\nnecessary connection along which such explanations can be given,\ndepending upon the different kinds of objects involved.\n\nOne of Schopenhauer\u2019s most significant assertions is that the\nfour different modes of explanation only run in parallel with each\nother, and cannot coherently be intermixed. If we begin by choosing a\ncertain style of explanation, then we immediately choose the kinds of\nobject to which we can refer. Conversely, if we begin by choosing a\ncertain kind of object to explain, we are obliged to use the style of\nreasoning associated with that kind of object. It thus violates the\nrationality of explanation to confuse one kind of explanation with\nanother kind of object. We cannot begin with a style of explanation\nthat involves material objects and their associated cause-and-effect\nrelationships, for example, and then argue to a conclusion that\ninvolves a different kind of object, such as an abstract concept.\nLikewise, we cannot begin with abstract conceptual definitions and\naccordingly employ logical reasoning for the purposes of concluding\nour argumentation with assertions about things that exist.\n\nWith this set of regulations about what counts as a legitimate way to\nconduct explanations, Schopenhauer ruled out the often-cited and\n(especially during his time) philosophically often-relied-upon\ncosmological and ontological arguments for God\u2019s existence, and\nalong with them, all philosophies that ground themselves upon such\narguments. He was adamant that the German Idealist outlooks of Fichte,\nSchelling and Hegel rested upon explanatory errors of this kind, and\nhe regarded those outlooks as fundamentally wrongheaded styles of\nthought, for he saw their philosophies as being specifically grounded\nupon versions of the ontological argument for God\u2019s existence.\nHis frequent condemnation of German Idealism was advanced in light of\nwhat he considered to be sound philosophical reasons, despite his uncompromising ad hominem attacks on Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, who he described repeatedly as \u201chumbugs\u201d and \u201ccharlatans.\u201d\n3. Schopenhauer\u2019s Critique of Kant\n\nSchopenhauer can be called a Kantian in many respects, but he did not\nalways agree with the details of Kant\u2019s arguments. As noted,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s teacher in G\u00f6ttingen was G. E. Schulze, who\nauthored in 1792, a text entitled Aenesidemus, that contains\na criticism of the Kantian philosopher, Karl Leonhard Reinhold\n(1757\u20131823). Reinhold was a defender of Kant, and was known for\nhis Philosophy of the Elements (Elementarphilosophie) that\nwas expressed, along with some earlier writings, in Reinhold\u2019s\n1791 work, The Foundation of Philosophical Knowledge\n(Fundament des philosophischen Wissens).\n\nSchulze\u2019s critique of Kant is essentially the following: it is\nincoherent to posit as a matter of philosophical knowledge \u2013 as\nKant seems to have done \u2013 a mind-independent object that is\nbeyond all human experience, and that serves as the primary cause of\nour sensory experience. Schulze shares this criticism of Kant with F.\nH. Jacobi, who expressed the same objection five years earlier in\nDavid Hume on Faith, or Idealism and Realism, a Dialogue\n[1787] in an appendix entitled \u201cOn Transcendental\nIdealism.\u201d Schulze argues that Kant illegitimately uses the\nconcept of causality to conclude as a matter of strong epistemological\nrequirement, and not merely as a matter of rational speculation, that\nthere is some object \u2013 namely, the thing-in-itself \u2013\noutside of all possible human experience, that is nonetheless the\ncause of our sensations. \n\nSchopenhauer concurs that hypothesizing a thing-in-itself as the cause\nof our sensations amounts to a constitutive application and projection\nof the concept of causality beyond its legitimate scope, for according\nto Kant himself, the concept of causality only supplies knowledge when\nit is applied within the field of possible experience, and not outside\nof it. Schopenhauer therefore denies that our sensations have an\nexternal cause in the sense that we can know there is some\nepistemologically inaccessible object \u2013 the thing-in-itself\n\u2013 that exists independently of our sensations and is the cause\nof them.\n\nThese internal problems with Kant\u2019s argument suggest to\nSchopenhauer that Kant\u2019s reference to the thing-in-itself as a\nmind-independent object (or as an object of any kind) is misconstrued.\nSchopenhauer maintains instead that if we are to refer to the\nthing-in-itself, then we must come to an awareness of it, not by\ninvoking the relationship of causality \u2013 a relationship where\nthe cause and the effect are logically understood to be distinct\nobjects or events (since self-causation is a contradiction in terms)\n\u2013 but through another means altogether. As we will see in the\nnext section, and as we can see immediately in the title of his main\nwork \u2013 The World as Will and Representation \u2013\nSchopenhauer believes that the world has a double-aspect, namely, as\n\u201cWill\u201d (Wille) and as representation\n(Vorstellung). The German word \u201cVorstellung,\u201d can be translated as\n\u201crepresentation,\u201d \u201cpresentation,\u201d\n\u201cidea,\u201d or \u201cmental image.\u201d\n\nSchopenhauer does not believe, then, that Will causes our\nrepresentations. His position is that Will and representations are one\nand the same reality, regarded from different perspectives. They stand\nin relationship to each other in a way that compares to the\nrelationship between a force and its manifestation (e.g., as\nexemplified in the relationship between electricity and a spark, where\nthe spark \u201cis\u201d electricity). This is opposed to saying\nthat the thing-in-itself causes our sensations, as if we were\nreferring to one domino striking another. Schopenhauer\u2019s view is\nthat the relationship between the thing-in-itself and our sensations\nis more like that between two sides of a coin, neither of which causes\nthe other, and both of which are of the same coin and coinage.\n\nAmong his other criticisms of Kant (see the appendix to the first\nvolume of The World as Will and Representation, entitled,\n\u201cCriticism of the Kantian Philosophy\u201d), Schopenhauer\nmaintains that Kant\u2019s twelve categories of the human\nunderstanding \u2013 the various categories through which we\nlogically organize our field of sensations into comprehensible and\ninterrelated individual objects \u2013 are reducible to the single\ncategory of causality, and that this category, along with the forms of\nspace and time, is sufficient to explain the basic format of all human\nexperience, viz., individual objects dispersed throughout space and\ntime, causally related to one another.\n\nSchopenhauer further comprehends these three (and for him,\ninterdependent) principles as expressions of a single principle,\nnamely, the principle of sufficient reason, whose fourfold root he had\nexamined in his doctoral dissertation. In The World as Will and\nRepresentation, Schopenhauer often refers to an aspect of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason as the \u201cprinciple of individuation\u201d\n(principium individuationis), linking the idea of\nindividuation explicitly with space and time, but also implicitly with\nrationality, necessity, systematicity and determinism. He uses the\nprinciple of sufficient reason and the principle of individuation as\nshorthand expressions for what Kant had more complexly referred to as\nspace, time and the twelve categories of the understanding (viz.,\nunity, plurality, totality, reality, negation, limitation, substance,\ncausality, reciprocity, possibility, actuality [Dasein], and\nnecessity).\n4. The World as Will\n\nIt is a perennial philosophical reflection that if one looks deeply\nenough into oneself, one will discover not only one\u2019s own\nessence, but also the essence of the universe. For as one is a part of\nthe universe as is everything else, the basic energies of the universe\nflow through oneself as they flow through everything else. For that\nreason it is thought that one can come into contact with the nature of\nthe universe if one comes into substantial contact with one\u2019s\nultimate inner being.\n\nAmong the most frequently-identified principles that are\nintrospectively brought forth \u2013 and one that was the standard\nfor German Idealist philosophers such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel\nwho were philosophizing within the Cartesian tradition \u2013 is the\nprinciple of self-consciousness. With the belief that acts of\nself-consciousness exemplify a self-creative process akin to divine\ncreation, and developing a logic that reflects the structure of\nself-consciousness, namely, the dialectical logic of position,\nopposition and reconciliation (sometimes described as the logic of\nthesis, antithesis and synthesis), the German Idealists maintained\nthat dialectical logic mirrors the structure not only of human\nproductions, both individual and social, but the structure of reality\nas a whole, conceived of as a thinking substance or\nconceptually-structured-and-constituted being.\n\nAs much as he opposes the traditional German Idealists in their\nmetaphysical elevation of self-consciousness (which he regards as too\nintellectualistic), Schopenhauer philosophizes within the spirit of\nthis tradition, for he believes that the supreme principle of the\nuniverse is likewise apprehensible through introspection, and that we\ncan understand the world as various manifestations of this general\nprinciple. For Schopenhauer, this is not the principle of\nself-consciousness and rationally-infused will, but is rather what he\nsimply calls \u201cWill\u201d \u2013 a mindless, aimless,\nnon-rational impulse at the foundation of our instinctual drives, and\nat the foundational being of everything. Schopenhauer\u2019s\noriginality does not reside in his characterization of the world as\nWill, or as act \u2013 for we encounter this position in\nFichte\u2019s philosophy \u2013 but in the conception of Will as\nbeing devoid of rationality or intellect.\n\nHaving rejected the Kantian position that our sensations are caused by\nan unknowable object that exists independently of us, Schopenhauer\nnotes importantly that our body \u2013 which is just one among the\nmany objects in the world \u2013 is given to us in two different\nways: we perceive our body as a physical object among other physical\nobjects, subject to the natural laws that govern the movements of all\nphysical objects, and we are aware of our body through our immediate\nawareness, as we each consciously inhabit our body, intentionally move\nit, and feel directly our pleasures, pains, and emotional states. We\ncan objectively perceive our hand as an external object, as a surgeon\nmight perceive it during a medical operation, and we can also be\nsubjectively aware of our hand as something we inhabit, as something\nwe move willfully, and of which we can feel its inner muscular\nworkings. \n\nFrom this observation, Schopenhauer asserts that among all the objects\nin the universe, there is only one object, relative to each\nof us \u2013 namely, our physical body \u2013 that is given in two\nentirely different ways. It is given as representation (i.e.,\nobjectively; externally) and as Will (i.e., subjectively; internally).\nOne of his notable conclusions is that when we move our hand, this is\nnot to be comprehended as a motivational act that first happens, and\nthen causes the movement of our hand as an effect. He maintains that\nthe movement of our hand is but a single act \u2013 again, like the\ntwo sides of a coin \u2013 that has a subjective feeling of willing\nas one of its aspects, and the movement of the hand as the other. More\ngenerally, he adds that the action of the body is nothing but the act\nof Will objectified, that is, translated into perception. \n\nAt this point in his argumentation, Schopenhauer has established only\nthat among his many ideas, or representations, only one of them (viz.,\nthe [complex] representation of his body) has this special\ndouble-aspected quality. When he perceives the moon or a mountain, he\ndoes not under ordinary circumstances have any direct access to the\nmetaphysical inside of such objects; they remain as representations\nthat reveal to him only their objective side. Schopenhauer asks,\nthough, how he might understand the world as an integrated whole, or\nhow he might render his entire field of perception the most comprehensible, for as things stand, he can directly experience the\ninside of one of his representations, but of no others. To answer this\nquestion, he uses the double-knowledge of his own body as the key to\nthe inner being of every other natural phenomenon: he regards \u2013\nas if he were trying to make the notion of universal empathy\ntheoretically possible \u2013 every object in the world as being\nmetaphysically double-aspected, and as having an inside or inner\naspect of its own, just as his consciousness is the inner aspect of\nhis own body. This is his rationale for rejecting Descartes\u2019s\ncausal interactionism, where thinking substance is said to cause\nchanges in an independent material substance and vice-versa.\n\nThis precipitates a position that characterizes the inner aspect of\nthings, as far as we can describe it, as Will. Hence, Schopenhauer\nregards the world as a whole as having two sides: the world is Will\nand the world is representation. The world as Will (\u201cfor\nus\u201d, as he sometimes qualifies it) is the world as it is in\nitself, which is a unity, and the world as representation is the world\nof appearances, of our ideas, or of objects, which is a diversity. An\nalternative title for Schopenhauer\u2019s main book, The World as\nWill and Representation, might well have been, The World as\nReality and Appearance. Similarly, his book might have\nbeen entitled, The Inner and Outer Nature of Reality. \n\nAn inspiration for Schopenhauer\u2019s view that ideas are like inert\nobjects is George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), who describes ideas in\nthis deactivated way in his A Treatise Concerning the\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge (1710) [Section 25]. A primary\ninspiration for Schopenhauer\u2019s double-aspect view of the\nuniverse is Baruch (Benedict) de Spinoza (1632\u20131677), who\ndeveloped a similarly-structured metaphysics, and who Schopenhauer had\nstudied in his early years before writing his dissertation. A\nsubsequent, but often highlighted inspiration is from the Upanishads\n(c. 900\u2013600 BCE) which also expresses a double-aspected view of the universe as having objective and subjective aspects, referred to respectively as Brahman and Atman. \n\nOnly a few months after completing his dissertation, Schopenhauer was\nexposed to classical Indian thought in late 1813 by the orientalist\nFriedrich Majer (1771\u20131818), who visited Johanna\nSchopenhauer\u2019s salon in Weimar. Schopenhauer also probably met\nat the time, Julius Klaproth (1783\u20131835), who was the editor of\nDas Asiatische Magazin. As the records of his library book\nwithdrawals indicate, Schopenhauer began reading the Bhagavadgita in\nDecember 1813 or very soon thereafter, and the Upanishads in March\n1814, coincident with the time when Schopenhauer\u2019s thought\nassumed an explicitly atheistic quality. Only a year before this, he\nwas referring to himself explicitly in his notebooks as an\n\u201cilluminated theist,\u201d i.e., a mystic, in an 1812\ndiscussion of Schelling\u2019s philosophy (Manuscript\nRemains, Vol. 2, p. 373).\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s appreciation for Indian thought was augmented in\nDresden during the writing of The World as Will and\nRepresentation by his 1815\u20131817 neighbor Karl Friedrich Christian Krause.  Not only was Krause a metaphysical panentheist (see biographic segment above), he was also\nan enthusiast of South Asian thought. Familiar with the Sanskrit\nlanguage, he introduced Schopenhauer to publications on India in the\nAsiatisches Magazin, and these enhanced Schopenhauer\u2019s\nstudies of the first European-language translation of the Upanishads:\nin 1801, a Persian version of the Upanishads (the Oupnekhat) was\nrendered into Latin by the French Orientalist, Abraham Hyacinthe\nAnquetil-Duperron (1731-1805) \u2013 a scholar who also introduced\ntranslations of Zoroastrian texts into Europe in 1771. \n\nDespite its general precedents within the philosophical family of\ndouble-aspect theories, Schopenhauer\u2019s particular\ncharacterization of the world as Will is nonetheless novel and daring.\nIt is also frightening and pandemonic: he maintains that the world as\nit is in itself (again, sometimes adding \u201cfor us\u201d) is an\nendless striving and blind impulse with no end in view, devoid of\nknowledge, lawless, absolutely free, entirely self-determining and\nalmighty. Within Schopenhauer\u2019s vision of the world as Will,\nthere is no God to be comprehended, and the world is conceived of as\nbeing inherently meaningless. When anthropomorphically considered, the\nworld is represented as being in a condition of eternal frustration,\nas it endlessly strives for nothing in particular, and as it goes\nessentially nowhere. It is a world beyond any ascriptions of good and\nevil.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s denial of meaning to the world differs radically\nfrom the views of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, all of whom sustained a\ndistinct belief that everything is moving towards a harmonious and just\nend. Like these German Idealists, however, Schopenhauer explained how the world that we experience daily is the result of the\nactivity of the central principle of things. Just as the German Idealists accounted for the great chain of being \u2013 the rocks,\ntrees, animals, and human beings \u2013 as the increasingly\ncomplicated and detailed objectifications of self-consciousness,\nSchopenhauer explained the world as\nobjectifications of Will. \n\nFor Schopenhauer, the world we experience is constituted by\nobjectifications of Will that correspond first, to the general root of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, and second, to the more specific\nfourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason. This generates a two-tiered outlook (viz., Will [= reality] vs.\nobjects-in-general [= appearance]), that articulates into a\nthree-tiered outlook (viz., Will [= reality] vs. universal,\nnon-spatio-temporal objects vs. individual, spatio-temporal objects),\nby further distinguishing between universalistic and individualistic\nlevels within the sphere of objects. \n\nThe general philosophical pattern of a single world-essence that\ninitially manifests itself as a multiplicity of abstract essences,\nthat, in turn, manifest themselves as a multiplicity of physical\nindividuals is found throughout the world. It is characteristic of\nNeoplatonism (c. third century, C.E., as represented by Plotinus\n[204\u2013270]), as well as the Buddhist Three Body Doctrine\n[trikaya] of the Buddha\u2019s manifestation, that is\ndeveloped in the Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism as represented\nby Maitreya (270\u2013350), Asanga (375\u2013430) and Vasubandu\n(400\u2013480).\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, corresponding to the level of the universal\nsubject-object distinction, Will is immediately objectified into a set\nof universal objects or Platonic Ideas. These constitute the timeless\npatterns for each of the individual things that we experience in space\nand time. There are different Platonic Ideas, and although this\nmultiplicity of Ideas implies that some measure of individuation is\npresent within this realm, each Idea nonetheless contains no plurality\nwithin itself and is said to be \u201cone.\u201d Since the Platonic\nIdeas are in neither space nor time, they lack the qualities of\nindividuation that would follow from the introduction of spatial and\ntemporal qualifications. In these respects, the Platonic Ideas are\nindependent of the specific fourfold root of the principle of\nsufficient reason, even though it would be misleading to say that\nthere is no individuation whatsoever at this universal level, for\nthere are many different Platonic Ideas. Schopenhauer refers to the Platonic Ideas as the direct\nobjectifications of Will and as the immediate objectivity of\nWill.\n\nWill\u2019s indirect objectifications appear when our minds continue\nto apply the principle of sufficient reason beyond its general root\nsuch as to introduce the forms of time, space and causality, not to\nmention logic, mathematics, geometry and moral reasoning. When Will is\nobjectified at this level of determination, the world of everyday life\nemerges, whose objects are, in effect, kaleidoscopically multiplied\nmanifestations of the Platonic forms, endlessly dispersed throughout\nspace and time. \n\nSince the principle of sufficient reason is \u2013 given\nSchopenhauer\u2019s inspiration from Kant \u2013 the epistemological\nform of the human mind, the spatio-temporal world is the world of our\nown reflection. To that extent, Schopenhauer says that life is like a\ndream. As a condition of our knowledge, Schopenhauer believes that the\nlaws of nature, along with the sets of objects that we experience, we\nourselves create in way that is not unlike the way the constitution of\nour tongues invokes the taste of sugar. As Galileo Galilei\n(1564\u20131642) states in \u201cThe Assayer\u201d (1623), if ears\ntongues and noses were removed from the world, then odors, tastes, and\nsounds would be removed as well.\n\nAt this point, what Schopenhauer has developed philosophically is\nsurely interesting, but we have not yet mentioned its more remarkable\nand memorable aspect. If we combine his claim that the world is Will\nwith his Kantian view that we are responsible for the individuated\nworld of appearances, we arrive at a novel outlook \u2013 an outlook\nthat depends heavily upon Schopenhauer\u2019s characterization of the\nthing-in-itself as Will, understood to be an aimless, blind\nstriving.\n\nBefore the human being comes onto the scene with its principle of\nsufficient reason (or principle of individuation) there are no\nindividuals. It is the human being that, in its very effort to know\nanything, objectifies an appearance for itself that involves the\nfragmentation of Will and its breakup into a comprehensible set of\nindividuals. The result of this fragmentation, given the nature of\nWill, is terrible: it is a world of constant struggle, where each\nindividual thing strives against every other individual thing. The\nresult is a permanent \u201cwar of all against all\u201d akin to\nwhat Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) characterized as the state of\nnature. \n\nKant maintains in the Critique of Pure Reason that we create\nthe laws of nature (CPR, A125). Adding to this, Schopenhauer\nmaintains in The World as Will and Representation that we\ncreate the violent state of nature, for his view is that the\nindividuation we impose upon things, is imposed upon a blind striving\nenergy that, once it becomes individuated and objectified, turns\nagainst itself, consumes itself, and does violence to itself. His\nparadigm image is of the bulldog-ant of Australia, that when cut in\nhalf, struggles in a battle to the death between its head and tail.\nOur very quest for scientific and practical knowledge creates \u2013\nfor Schopenhauer sinfully and repulsively \u2013 a world that feasts\nnightmarishly upon itself.\n\nThis marks the origin of Schopenhauer\u2019s renowned pessimism: he\nclaims that as individuals, we are the anguished products of our own\nepistemological making, and that within the world of appearances that\nwe structure, we are fated to fight with other individuals, and to\nwant more than we can ever have. On Schopenhauer\u2019s view, the\nworld of daily life is essentially violent and frustrating; it is a\nworld that, as long as our consciousness remains at that level where\nthe principle of sufficient reason applies in its fourfold root, will\nnever resolve itself into a condition of greater tranquillity. As he\nexplicitly states, daily life \u201cis suffering\u201d\n(WWR, Section 56) and to express this, he employs images of\nfrustration taken from classical Greek mythology, such as those of\nTantalus and the Danaids, along with the suffering of Ixion on the\never-spinning wheel of fire. The image of Sisyphus expresses the same\nfrustrated spirit.\n5. Transcending the Human Conditions of Conflict\n 5.1 Aesthetic Perception as a Mode of Transcendence\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s violent vision of the daily world sends him on a\nquest for tranquillity, and he pursues this by retracing the path\nthrough which Will objectifies itself. He discovers more peaceful\nstates of mind by directing his everyday, practically-oriented\nconsciousness towards more extraordinary, universal and\nless-individuated states of mind, since he believes that the violence\nthat a person experiences is proportional to the degree to which that\nperson\u2019s consciousness is individuated and objectifying. His\nview is that with less individuation and objectification, there is\nless conflict, less pain and more peace.\n\nOne way to achieve a more tranquil state of consciousness is through\naesthetic perception. This is a special state of perceptual\nconsciousness where we apprehend some spatio-temporal object and\ndiscern through this object, the object\u2019s essence, archetype, or\n\u201cPlatonic Idea\u201d that corresponds to the type of object in\nquestion. In this form of perception, we lose ourselves in the object,\nforget about our individuality, and become the clear mirror of the\nobject. During the aesthetic perception of an individual apple tree,\nfor example, we would perceive shining through the tree, the archetype\nof all apple trees (i.e., the Ur-phenomenon, as Goethe would describe\nit) in an appreciation of every apple tree that was, is, or will be.\nThe kind of perception involved compares, for example, to the\ntraditional portrait artist who discerns the shapes that nature\nintended to realize in a face, but that were not ideally realized. The\npainter consequently removes in the artistic portrait, the little\nhairs, warts, wrinkles and such, to present a more idealized, angelic,\ntimeless, and perfected facial presentation, as we might see in a\nwedding or religious portrait. \n\nSince Schopenhauer assumes that the quality of the subject of\nexperience must correspond to the quality of the object of experience,\nhe infers that in the state of aesthetic perception, where the objects\nare universalistic, the subject of experience must likewise assume a\nuniversalistic quality (WWR, Section 33). Aesthetic\nperception thus transforms an individually-oriented state of\nconsciousness to a universally-oriented state of consciousness, or\nwhat Schopenhauer calls a pure will-less, painless, and timeless\nsubject of knowledge (WWR, Section 34).\n\nFew people supposedly have the capacity to remain in such an aesthetic\nstate of mind for very long, and most are denied the transcendent\ntranquillity of aesthetic perception. Only the artistically-minded\ngenius is naturally disposed to and can supposedly remain at length in\nthe state of pure perception, and it is to these individuals\nSchopenhauer believes we must turn \u2013 as we appreciate their\nworks of art \u2013 to obtain a more concentrated and knowledgeable\nglimpse of the Platonic Ideas (i.e., into the essences of things). The\nartistic genius contemplates these Ideas, creates a work of art that\npresents the Ideas in a manner more clear and accessible than is usual, and\nthereby communicates a universalistic vision to those who lack the\nidealizing power to see through, and to rise above, the ordinary world\nof spatio-temporal objects.\n\nSchopenhauer states that the highest purpose of art is to communicate\nPlatonic Ideas (WWR, Section 50). As constituting art, he has\nin mind the traditional five fine arts minus music, namely,\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, and poetry. These four arts he\ncomprehends in relation to the Platonic Ideas \u2013 those universal\nobjects of aesthetic awareness that are located at the objective pole\nof the universal subject-object distinction at the root of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Schopenhauer\u2019s account of the\nvisual and literary arts corresponds to the world as representation in\nits immediate objectification, namely, the field of Platonic Ideas as\nopposed to the field of spatio-temporal objects.\n\nAs a counterpart to his interpretation of the visual and literary\narts, Schopenhauer develops an account of music that coordinates it\nwith the subjective pole of the universal subject-object distinction.\nSeparate from the other traditional arts, he maintains that music is\nthe most metaphysical art and is on a subjective, feeling-centered\nparallel with the Platonic Ideas themselves. Just as the Platonic Ideas\ncontain the patterns for the types of objects in the daily world,\nmusic formally duplicates the basic structure of the world: the bass\nnotes are analogous to inorganic nature, the harmonies are analogous\nto the animal world, and the melodies are analogous to the human\nworld. The sounding of the bass note produces more subtle sonic\nstructures in its overtones; similarly, inanimate nature produces\nanimate life.\n\nIn the structure of music, Schopenhauer discerns a series of analogies\nto the structure of the physical world that allow him to claim that\nmusic is \u201ca copy of Will itself\u201d (Abbild des Willens selbst [italics in original German]) (WWR, Section 52). His view might seem extravagant upon\nfirst hearing, but it rests on the thought that if one is to discern\nthe truth of the world, it might be advantageous to apprehend the\nworld, not exclusively in scientific, mechanical and causal terms, but\nrather in aesthetic, analogical, expressive and metaphorical terms\nthat require a sense of taste for their discernment. If the form of\nthe world is best reflected in the form of music, then the most\nphilosophical sensibility will be a musical sensibility. This\npartially explains the positive attraction of Schopenhauer\u2019s\ntheory of music to creative spirits such as Richard Wagner and\nFriedrich Nietzsche, both of whom combined musical and philosophical\ninterests in their work.\n\nWith respect to the theme of achieving more peaceful and transcendent\nstates of mind, Schopenhauer believes that music achieves this by\nembodying the abstract forms of feelings, or feelings abstracted from\ntheir particular everyday circumstances. This allows us to perceive\nthe essences of emotional life \u2013 \u201csadness itself,\u201d\n\u201cjoy itself,\u201d etc. \u2013 without the contingent contents\nthat would typically cause suffering. By expressing emotion in this\ndetached way, music allows us to apprehend the nature of the world\nwithout the frustration involved in daily life, and hence, in a mode\nof aesthetic awareness akin to the tranquil philosophical\ncontemplation of the world. Insofar as music provides an abstract and\npainless vision of the world and of inner life, however, it also fails\nto evoke the compassion that issues from identifying tangibly with\nanother person\u2019s suffering. This deficiency motivates a shift\nfrom musical, or aesthetic, awareness to moral awareness.\n5.2 Moral Awareness as a Mode of Transcendence\n\nAs many medieval Christians once assumed, Schopenhauer believed that\nwe should minimize our fleshly desires, since moral awareness arises\nthrough an attitude that transcends our bodily individuality. Indeed,\nhe states explicitly that his views on morality are entirely in the\nspirit of Christianity, as well as being consistent with the doctrines\nand ethical precepts of the sacred books of India (WWR,\nSection 68). Among the precepts he respects are those prescribing that\none treat others as kindly as one treats oneself, that one refrain\nfrom violence and take measures to reduce suffering in the world, that\none avoid egoism and thoughts directed towards revenge, and that one\ncultivate a strong sense of compassion. Such precepts are not unique\nto Christianity; Schopenhauer believes that they constitute most\nreligiously-grounded moral views. Far from being immoralistic, his\nmoral theory is written in the same vein as those of Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804) and John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), that\nadvocate principles that are in general accord with Christian\nprecepts.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s conception of moral awareness coheres with his\nproject of seeking more tranquil, transcendent states of mind. Within\nthe moral realm, this quest for transcendence leads him to maintain\nthat once we recognize each human as being merely an instance and\naspect of the single act of Will that is humanity itself, we will\nappreciate that the difference between the tormentor and the tormented\nis illusory, and that in fact, the very same eye of humanity looks out\nfrom each and every person. According to the true nature of things,\neach person has all the sufferings of the world as his or her own, for\nthe same inner human nature ultimately bears all of the pain and all\nof the guilt. Thus, with the consciousness of humanity in mind, a\nmoral consciousness would realize that it has upon and within itself,\nthe sins of the whole world (WWR, Sections 63 and 64). It\nshould be noted that such a consciousness would also bear all of\nhumanity\u2019s joys, triumphs, and pleasures, but Schopenhauer does\nnot develop this thought. \n\nNot only, then, does the specific application of the principle of\nsufficient reason fragment the world into a set of individuals\ndispersed through space and time for the purposes of attaining\nscientific knowledge, this rationalistic principle generates the\nillusion that when one person does wrong to another, that these two\npeople are essentially separate and private individuals. Just as the\nfragmentation of the world into individuals is necessary to apply the\nrelationship of causality, where A causes B and\nwhere A and B are conceived to be two independent\nobjects, this same cognitive fragmentation leads us to conceive of the\nrelationships between people on a model where some person P\nacts upon person Q, where P and Q are\nconceived as two independent individuals. The conditions for\nscientific knowledge thus have a negative moral impact, because they\nlead us to regard each other as individuals separate and alien to one\nanother.\n\nBy compassionately recognizing at a more universal level that the\ninner nature of another person is of the same metaphysical substance\nas oneself, one arrives at a moral outlook with a more concrete\nphilosophical awareness. This compassionate way of apprehending\nanother person is not merely understanding abstractly the proposition\nthat \u201ceach person is a human being,\u201d or understanding\nabstractly (as would Kant) that, in principle, the same regulations of\nrationality operate equally in each of us and oblige us accordingly as\nequals. It is to feel directly the life of another person in an almost\nmagical way; it is to enter into the life of humanity imaginatively,\nsuch as to coincide with all others as much as one possibly can. It is\nto imagine equally, and in full force, what it is like to be\nboth a cruel tormentor and a tormented victim, and to locate both\nopposing experiences and characters within a single, universal\nconsciousness that is the consciousness of humanity itself. With the\ndevelopment of moral consciousness, one\u2019s awareness expands\ntowards the mixed-up, tension-ridden, bittersweet, tragicomic,\nmulti-aspected and distinctively sublime consciousness of humanity\nitself.\n\nEdmund Burke (1729\u20131797) characterized the sublime as a feeling\nof tranquillity tinged with terror, and Schopenhauer\u2019s moral\nconsciousness fits this description. Just as music embodies the\nemotional tensions within the world in an abstracted and distanced\nmanner, and thus affords a measure of tranquillity by presenting a\nsoftened, sonic image of the daily world of perpetual conflict, a\nmeasure of tranquillity also attends moral consciousness. When\nattaining the universal consciousness of humanity that transcends\nspatial and temporal determinations, the desires that derive their\nsignificance from one\u2019s personal condition as a spatio-temporal\nindividual are seen for what they are, as being grounded upon the\nillusion of fragmentation, and they thereby lose much their compelling\nforce. In this respect, moral consciousness becomes the\n\u201cquieter\u201d of the will, despite its first-person\nrecognition of human torment. Works of art that portray this kind of\nsublime consciousness would include the Laoco\u00f6n (c. 25\nB.C.E.) and Hieronymous Bosch\u2019s painting, Christ Carrying\nthe Cross (c. 1515). \n\nNegatively considered, moral consciousness delivers us from the\nunquenchable thirst that is individuated human life, along with the\nunremitting oscillation between pain and boredom. Positively\nconsidered, moral consciousness generates a measure of wisdom, as\none\u2019s outlook becomes akin to a universal novel that contains\nthe templates for all of the human stories that have been repeating\nthemselves generation after generation \u2013 stories comic and\ntragic, pathetic and triumphant, and trivial and monumental. One\nbecomes like the steadfast tree, whose generations of leaves fall away\nwith each passing season, as does generation after generation of\npeople (Homer, Iliad, Book VI).\n\nSchopenhauer maintains similarly in his \u201cEssay on the Freedom of\nthe Will\u201d (1839) that everything that happens, happens\nnecessarily. Having accepted Kant\u2019s view that cause and effect\nrelationships extend throughout the world of experience, he believes\nthat every individual act is determined by prior causes or motives.\nThis fatalistic realization is a source of comfort and tranquillity\nfor Schopenhauer, for upon becoming aware that nothing can be done to\nalter the course of events, he finds that the struggle to change the\nworld quickly loses its force (see also WWR, Section 56).\n\nSchopenhauer denies the common conception that being free entails\nthat, for any situation in which we acted, we could always have acted\ndifferently. He augments this denial, however, with the claim that\neach of us is free in a more basic sense. Noting that we have\n\u201can unshakeable certainty that we are the doers of our\ndeeds\u201d (\u201cEssay on the Freedom of the Will\u201d,\nConclusion), he maintains that our sense of responsibility reveals an\ninnate character that is self-determining and independent of\nexperience. Just as individual trees and individual flowers are the\nmultifarious expressions of the Platonic Ideas of tree and flower,\neach of our individual actions is the spatio-temporal manifestation of\nour respective innate or intelligible character.\n\nA person\u2019s intelligible character is a timeless act of Will that\nthe person essentially is, and it can be conceived of as the\nsubjective aspect of the Platonic Idea that would objectively define\nthe person\u2019s inner essence (WWR, Section 28), as a\nportrait artist might perceive it. This concept of the intelligible\ncharacter is Kantian (Critique of Pure Reason, A539/B567),\nand in conjunction with Kant\u2019s correlated concept of an\nempirical character (i.e., the intelligible character as it is\nexperientially expressed) Schopenhauer regards it as a means to\nresolve the problem of freedom and determinism, and to be one of the\nmost profound ideas in Kant\u2019s philosophy.\n\nFrom the standpoint of later philosophical influence,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s discussion of the intelligible character\nresonates with Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s injunction to \u201cbecome\nwhat one is\u201d (Ecce Homo, \u201cWhy I am so\nClever\u201d, Section 9). Schopenhauer believes that as we learn more\nabout ourselves, we can manifest our intelligible character more\neffectively, and can play our designated role \u201cartistically and\nmethodically, with firmness and grace.\u201d With self-knowledge, we\ncan transform our lives into works of art, as Nietzsche later\nprescribed.\n\nCharacter development thus involves expanding the knowledge of our\ninnate individual tendencies, and a primary effect of this knowledge\nand self-realization is greater peace of mind (WWR, Section\n55). Moreover, since our intelligible character is both subjective and\nuniversal, its status coordinates with that of music, the highest art.\nThis association with music \u2013 as Nietzsche probably observed\n\u2013 reveals a systematic link between Schopenhauer\u2019s\naesthetics and his moral theory, and it can account for\nSchopenhauer\u2019s reference to the emergence of pleasing aesthetic\nand artistic, if not musical, qualities in connection with the\nexpression of our acquired character.\n5.3 Asceticism and the Denial of the Will-to-Live\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, aesthetic perception offers only a\nshort-lived transcendence from the daily world. Neither is moral\nawareness the ultimate state of mind, despite its comparative tranquillity in contrast to the\ndaily world of violence. Schopenhauer\nbelieves that a person who experiences the truth of human nature from\na moral perspective \u2013 who appreciates how spatial and temporal\nforms of knowledge generate a constant passing away, continual\nsuffering, vain striving and inner tension \u2013 will be so repulsed\nby the human condition and by the pointlessly striving Will of which\nit is a manifestation, that he or she will lose the desire to affirm\nthe objectified human situation in any of its manifestations. The\nresult is an attitude of denial towards our will-to-live that\nSchopenhauer identifies with an ascetic attitude of renunciation,\nresignation, and will-lessness, but also with composure and\ntranquillity. In a manner reminiscent of traditional Buddhism, he\nrecognizes that life is filled with unavoidable frustration and\nacknowledges that the suffering caused by this frustration can itself\nbe reduced by minimizing one\u2019s desires. Moral consciousness and\nvirtue thus give way to the voluntary poverty and chastity of the\nascetic. St. Francis of Assisi (WWR, Section 68) and Jesus\n(WWR, Section 70) subsequently emerge as Schopenhauer\u2019s\nprototypes for the most enlightened lifestyle, in conjunction with the\nascetics from every religious tradition.\n\nThis emphasis upon the ascetic consciousness and its associated\ndetachment and tranquillity introduces some paradox into\nSchopenhauer\u2019s outlook, for he admits that the denial of our\nwill-to-live entails a terrible struggle with instinctual energies, as\nwe avoid the temptations of bodily pleasures and resist the mere\nanimal force to endure, reproduce, and flourish. Before we can enter the\ntranscendent consciousness of heavenly tranquillity, we must pass\nthrough the fires of hell and experience a dark night of the soul, as\nour universal self battles our individuated and physical self, as pure\nknowledge opposes animalistic will, and as freedom struggles\nagainst nature. \n\nOne can maintain superficially that no contradiction is involved in\nthe act of willing to deny the will-to-live,\nbecause one is not saying that Will is somehow destroying itself, but\nonly saying that a more universal manifestation of Will is\noverpowering a less universal manifestation, namely, the natural,\nindividuated, physically-embodied aspect. Within this opposition, it\ndoes remain that Will as a whole is set against itself according to\nthe very model Schopenhauer is trying to transcend, namely, the model\nwherein one manifestation of Will fights against another\nmanifestation, like the divided bulldog ant. This in itself may not be a\nproblem, but the location of the tormented and self-crucifying ascetic\nconsciousness at the penultimate level of enlightenment is\nparadoxical, owing to its high degree of inner ferocity. Even though\nthis ferocity occurs at a reflective and introspective level, we have\nbefore us a spiritualized life-and-death struggle within the ascetic\nconsciousness.\n\nThis peculiarity notwithstanding, the ascetic\u2019s struggle is none\nother than a supreme struggle against human nature. It is a struggle\nagainst the close-to-unavoidable tendency to apply the principle of\nsufficient reason for the purpose of attaining practical knowledge\n\u2013 an application that for Schopenhauer has the repulsive\nside-effect of creating the illusion, or nightmare, of a world\npermeated with endless conflict. From a related angle, the\nascetic\u2019s struggle is against the forces of violence and evil,\nthat, owing to Schopenhauer\u2019s acceptance and interpretation of\nKant\u2019s epistemology, locates these forces significantly within\nhuman nature itself. When the ascetic transcends human nature, the\nascetic resolves the problem of evil: by removing the individuated and\nindividuating human consciousness from the scene, the entire\nspatio-temporal situation within which daily violence occurs is\nremoved. \n\nIn a way, then, the ascetic consciousness can be said symbolically to\nreturn Adam and Eve to Paradise, for it is the very quest for\nknowledge (i.e., the will to apply the principle of individuation to\nexperience) that the ascetic overcomes. This amounts to a\nself-overcoming at the universal level, where not only physical\ndesires are overcome, but where humanly-inherent epistemological\ndispositions are overcome as well.\n6. Schopenhauer\u2019s Later Works\n\nAt the end of the first volume of The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818), Schopenhauer intimates that the ascetic\nexperiences an inscrutable mystical state of consciousness that looks\nlike nothing at all from the standpoint of ordinary, day-to-day,\nindividuated and objectifying consciousness. Conversely, he adds that\nfrom the standpoint of the ascetic\u2019s mystical consciousness,\nwhere only knowledge remains and where \u201cthe will [to live] has\nvanished,\u201d the physical world itself, with all of its suns and\ngalaxies \u201cis \u2013 nothing,\u201d likening this consciousness\nto \u201cthe Prajna-Paramita of the Buddhists\u201d (WWR,\nSection 71) to conclude the book. He also states in the same section\nthat this mystical consciousness has an ocean-like calmness,\ntranquillity, confidence and serenity, adding that if one were to seek\na positive characterization of the mystical state, we could refer\nloosely to words and phrases such as \u201cecstasy,\u201d\n\u201crapture,\u201d \u201cillumination\u201d and \u201cunion\nwith God.\u201d Schopenhauer recognizes a positive content to the\nascetic\u2019s mystical experience, but he regards the experience as\nineffable.\n\nThis advocacy of mystical experience creates a puzzle: if\neverything is Will without qualification, then it is unclear\nwhere to locate the will-less mystical state of mind. According to\nSchopenhauer\u2019s three-tiered philosophical schema, which is now\ncoming into question, it must be located either at the level of Will\nas it is in itself, or at the level of Platonic Ideas, or at the level\nof individual things in space and time. It cannot be the latter,\nbecause individuated consciousness is the everyday consciousness of\ndesire, frustration and suffering. Neither can it be located at the\nlevel of Will as it is in itself, because the Will is a blind\nstriving, without knowledge, and without satisfaction. \n\nThe ascetic consciousness might be most plausibly located at the level\nof the universal subject-object distinction, akin to the music-filled\nconsciousness, but Schopenhauer states that the mystical consciousness\nabolishes not only time and space, but also the fundamental forms of\nsubject and object: \u201cno will: no representation, no world\u201d\n(WWR, Section 71). So in terms of its degree of generality,\nthe mystical state of mind seems to be located at a level of\nuniversality comparable to that of Will as thing-in-itself. Since he\ncharacterizes it as not being a manifestation of Will, however, it\nappears to be keyed into another dimension altogether, in total\ndisconnection from Will as the thing-in-itself. This is to say that if\nthe thing-in-itself is exactly congruent with Will, then it is\ndifficult to accept Schopenhauer\u2019s mystical characterizations of\nthe ascetic consciousness, and at the same time identify a consistent\nplace for it within Schopenhauer\u2019s three-tiered philosophical\nschema of reality.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s position on whether the thing-in-itself is Will\nconsequently presents some interpretive difficulties. In On the\nWill in Nature (1836/1854), he almost always speaks as if the two\nare identical. In the second volume of The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1844), he addresses the above complication, and\nqualifies his claim that the thing-in-itself is Will. He states in the\n1844 work (reciting manuscript notes from 1821 almost verbatim, so\nthis is not an \u201c1844\u201d or \u201clater\u201d view) that it\nis only \u201cto us\u201d that the thing-in-itself appears as Will\nand that it remains possible that the thing-in-itself has other modes\nof being that are incomprehensible in ordinary terms, but that might\nbe accessible to mystical consciousness (WWR, II, Chapter\nXVIII, \u201cOn the Possibility of Knowing the\nThing-in-Itself\u201d). He concludes that mystical experience is only\na relative nothingness, that is, when it is considered from the\nstandpoint of the daily world, but that it is not an absolute\nnothingness, as would be the case if the thing-in-itself were Will in\nan unconditional sense, and not merely Will to us. \n\nIn light of this, Schopenhauer sometimes expresses the view that the\nthing-in-itself is multidimensional, and although the thing-in-itself\nis not wholly identical to the world as Will, it nonetheless includes\nas its manifestations, the world as Will and the world as\nrepresentation. This lends a panentheistic structure to\nSchopenhauer\u2019s view (noted earlier in the views of K.C.F.\nKrause). From a scholarly standpoint, it implies that interpretations\nof Schopenhauer that portray him as a Kantian who believes that\nknowledge of the thing-in-itself is impossible, do not fit with what\nSchopenhauer himself believed. It also implies that interpretations\nthat portray him as a traditional metaphysician who claims that the\nthing-in-itself is straightforwardly, wholly and unconditionally Will,\nalso stand in need of qualification.\n7. Critical Reflections\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s intermittently-encountered claim that Will is the\nthing-in-itself only to us, provides philosophical space for\nhim to assert consistently that mystical experience provides a\npositive insight. It also relativizes to the human condition,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s position that the world is Will. This entails\nthat his outlook on daily life as a cruel and violence-filled world\n\u2013 a world generated by the application of the principle of\nsufficient reason, is based on a human-conditioned intuition, namely,\nthe direct, double-knowledge of one\u2019s body as both subject and\nobject. So along these lines, Schopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic vision\nof the world can itself be seen to be grounded upon the subject-object\ndistinction, i.e., the general root of the principle of sufficient\nreason. As mentioned above, we can see this fundamental reliance upon\nthe subject-object distinction reflected in the very title of his\nbook, The World as Will and Representation, that can be read\nas, in effect, The World as Subjectively and Objectively\nApprehended.\n\nThis observation does not render (within the parameters of his\noutlook) Schopenhauer\u2019s ruthlessly competitive world-scenario\ntypically any less avoidable, but it does lead one to understand\nSchopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic vision of the world-as-Will, as less\nof an outlook derived from an absolute standpoint that transcends\nhuman nature \u2013 although he frequently speaks in this\nabsolutistic way \u2013 and as more of an outlook expressive of human\nnature in its effort to achieve philosophical understanding. Owing to\nits fundamental reliance upon the subject-object distinction,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s classical account of the daily world as the\nobjectification of Will, is understandable not only as a traditional\nmetaphysical theory that purports to describe the unconditional truth.\nIt can be understood alternatively as an expression of the human\nperspective on the world, that, as an embodied individual, we\ntypically cannot avoid. This tempered approach, though, does leave us\nwith the decisive question of why the world would appear to be so\nviolent, if the universe\u2019s core is not thoroughly\n\u201cWill,\u201d but is also something mysterious beyond this. For\nif Will is only one of an untold number of the universe\u2019s\ndimensions, there would be no reason to expect that the individuating\neffects of the principle of sufficient reason would generate a world\nthat feasts on itself in the manner that Schopenhauer describes.\n8. Schopenhauer\u2019s Influence\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s philosophy has been widely influential, partly\nbecause his outlook acknowledges traditional moral values without the\nneed to postulate the existence of God. His view also allows for the\npossibility of absolute knowledge by means of mystical experience.\nSchopenhauer also implicitly challenges the hegemony of science and\nother literalistic modes of expression, substituting in their place,\nmore musical and literary styles of understanding. His recognition\n\u2013 at least with respect to a perspective we typically cannot\navoid \u2013 that the universe appears to be a fundamentally\nirrational place, was also appealing to 20th century\nthinkers who understood instinctual forces as irrational, and yet\nguiding, forces underlying human behavior.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s influence has been strong among literary figures,\nwhich include poets, playwrights, essayists, novelists and historians\nsuch as Charles Baudelaire, Samuel Beckett, Thomas Bernhard, Jorge\nLuis Borges, Jacob Burckhardt, Joseph Conrad, Andr\u00e9 Gide,\nGeorge Gissing, Franz Grillparzer, Thomas Hardy, Gerhardt Hauptmann,\nFriedrich Hebbel, Hugo von Hoffmansthal, Joris Karl Huysmans, Ernst\nJ\u00fcnger, Karl Kraus, D. H. Lawrence, Joaquim Maria Machado de\nAssis, Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, Thomas Mann, Guy de Maupassant,\nHerman Melville, Robert Musil, Edgar Allan Poe, Marcel Proust, Arno\nSchmidt, August Strindberg, Italo Svevo, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev,\nFrank Wedekind, W. B. Yeats, and Emile Zola. In general, these authors\nwere inspired by Schopenhauer\u2019s sense of the world\u2019s\nabsurdity, either regarded in a more nihilistic and gloomy manner, or\nregarded in a more lighthearted, absurdist, and comic manner.\n\nAmong philosophers, one can cite Henri Bergson, Julius Bahnsen, Eduard\nvon Hartmann, Suzanne Langer, Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder, Hans Vaihinger,\nand Friedrich Nietzsche, where each tended to focus on selected\naspects of Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy, such as his views on the\nmeaning of life, his theory of the non-rational will, his theory of\nmusic, or his Kantianism. Insofar as he influenced Nietzsche, who\nsubordinated science to art, Continental philosophy\u2019s\ntwentieth-century challenge to purely literalistic styles of\nphilosophy via Nietzsche is anticipated by Schopenhauer\u2019s view\nthat music expresses metaphysical truth more directly than does\ntraditional philosophy.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s theory of music, along with his emphasis upon\nartistic genius and the world-as-suffering, was also influential among\ncomposers such as Johannes Brahms, Anton\u00edn Dvor\u00e1k,\nGustav Mahler, Hans Pfitzner, Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolay\nRimsky-Korsakoff, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, and Richard Wagner. Insofar\nas he influenced Wagner, who is the father of twentieth-century music\nwritten to accompany and enhance motion pictures, Schopenhauer\u2019s\ntheory of music as the expression of a continual flow of emotion\nstands significantly behind the contemporary experience of music in\nartistic and communicational media.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s 19th century historical profile is\nfrequently obscured by the shadows of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Mill, Darwin\nand Nietzsche, but more than is usually recognized, in his rejection\nof rationalistic conceptions of the world as early as 1818, he\nperceived the shape of things to come. The hollow, nihilistic laughter\nexpressed by the Dada movement at the turn of the century in the midst\nof WWI, reiterates feelings that Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy had\nembodied almost a century earlier. Schopenhauer\u2019s ideas about\nthe importance of instinctual urges at the core of daily life also\nreappeared in Freud\u2019s surrealism-inspiring psychoanalytic\nthought, and his conviction that human history is going nowhere,\nbecame keynotes within 20th century French philosophy,\nafter two World Wars put a damper on the 19th century\nanticipations of continual progress that had captured the hearts of\nthinkers such as Hegel and Marx.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
