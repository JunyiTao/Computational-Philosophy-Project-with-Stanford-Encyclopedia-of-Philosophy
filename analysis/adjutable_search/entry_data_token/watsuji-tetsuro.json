Life and Career\n\nWatsuji Tetsur\u014d (1889\u20131960) was one of a small group of\nphilosophers in Japan during the twentieth century who brought\nJapanese philosophy to the attention of the world. In terms of his\ninfluence, exemplary scholarship, and originality he ranks with\nNishida Kitar\u014d, Tanabe Hajime, and Nishitani Keiji. The latter\nthree were all members of the so-called Kyoto School, and while\nWatsuji is not usually thought of as being a member of this school,\nthe influence and tone of his work clearly shows him to be a\nlike-minded thinker. \n\nThe Kyoto School, of which Nishida was the pioneering founder, is so\nidentified because of its common focus: Nishida\u2019s important\nwork, East/West comparative philosophy, and an on-going attempt to\ngive expression to Japanese ideas and concepts by means of the clarity\nafforded by Western philosophical tools and techniques. Whereas the\ngeneral emphasis of the Kyoto School is on epistemology, metaphysics\nand logic, Watsuji\u2019s primary focus came to be ethics, although\nhis earlier studies of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard ranged\nfar beyond the ethical. And while his impressive output (an original\nnineteen volume collected works has been expanded by Yuasa Yasuo\n(1925\u20132005), his former student who became one of Japan\u2019s\nleading contemporary philosophers, to twenty-seven volumes) includes\nwide-ranging studies in the history of both Eastern and Western\nphilosophy, his focus was not on Nishida and Tanabe, but on\nreconstructing the origins of Japanese culture more or less from the\nground up. Hence, while many of his ideas, e.g. the centrality of the\nconcept of \u2018nothingness\u2019 or \u2018emptiness,\u2019 and\ndialectical contradiction, show the influence of the Kyoto School\nthinkers, his own creative approach led him to formulate them\ndifferently, and to apply them to ethical, political, and cultural\nissues. Nevertheless, given the overlap of concepts, it would be a\nmistake to exclude him from some sort of honorary membership in the\nKyoto School (see the entry on the\n Kyoto School).\n And given that there never was an actual \u2018school\u2019 at all,\nit is enough to say that Watsuji was an active force in Japanese\nphilosophy in the twentieth century, along with Nishida, Tanabe, and\nlater on, Nishitani. \n\nWatsuji was born in 1889, the second son of a physician, in Himeji\nCity, in Hyogo Prefecture. He entered the prestigious First Higher\nSchool in Tokyo (now Tokyo University), in 1906, graduating in 1909.\nLater that same year, he entered Tokyo Imperial University, where his\nspecialization was philosophy, in the Faculty of Literature. He\nmarried Takase Teru in 1912, and a daughter, Ky\u014dko was born to\nthem in 1914. \n\nAs a student at Himeji Middle School, he displayed a passion for\nliterature, especially Western literature, and \u201cis said to have\nbeen fired with the ambition to become a poet like Byron\u201d\n(Furukawai 1961, 217). He wrote stories and plays, and was coeditor of\na literary magazine. When he entered the First Higher School in Tokyo,\neven though he had decided to pursue philosophy seriously, he remained\n\u201cas deeply immersed in Byron as ever and attracted chiefly to\nthings literary and dramatic\u201d (Furukawa 1961, 218). He is said\nto have had several excellent teachers at this school, and his\ninterests were considerably expanded in the arts and in literature.\nThe Headmaster, Nitobe Inaz\u014d, was of particular importance. James\nKodera writes that \u201cNitobe\u2019s book on Bushid\u014d, The\nSoul of Japan, began to awaken Tetsur\u014d not only to the\nEastern heritage but also to the study of ethics\u201d (Kodera 1987,\n6). Still, while this early glimpse into the forgotten depths of his\nown culture may have planted the seeds of later inquiries and\ninsights, Watsuji gained sustenance and insight at this time in his\nacademic career from his reading in Western Romanticism and\nIndividualism. \n\nWithout a doubt, the most important influence in Watsuji\u2019s early\nyears was the brilliant novelist Natsume S\u014dseki, considered a\nforemost interpreter of modern Japan. James Kodera writes that Watsuji\nfound in S\u014dseki \u201ca human being struggling with the human\ncondition in the particularities of early modern Japan, suddenly\nexposed to the West and yet struggling to sustain his own\nidentity\u201d (Kodera 1987, 6). S\u014dseki was beginning to abandon\nhis unqualified admiration of Western individualism, and was embarking\non a critique of both individualism and the modern culture of the\nWestern world. It was not only a move away from the values which he\nhad come to associate with Western culture, but a move back to the\nvalues of his own Japanese cultural tradition. Watsuji never met\nS\u014dseki while at the University of Tokyo, but did meet him in 1913\nand became a member of a study group that met at S\u014dseki\u2019s\nhome. S\u014dseki died three years later, when Watsuji was 27, and\nupon his death, Watsuji began to compose a lengthy reminiscence of\nhim. His reflections were published in 1918 (in his G\u016bzo\nsaik\u014d), and they marked Watsuji\u2019s own transformation\nfrom advocate of Western ways to critic of the West, turning toward a\nreconsideration of Japanese and Eastern cultural resources. It is\nperhaps telling that in a series that S\u014dseki wrote for a popular\nTokyo newspaper during 1912\u20131913, \u201cS\u014dseki depicted\nthe plight of the modern individual as one of painful loneliness and\nhelplessness\u201d (Kodera 1987, 6). He saw egoism as the source of\nthe plight, and has Ichir\u014d, the hero of the serially appearing\nnovel Wayfarer, conclude that \u201cthere is no bridge\nleading from one man to another; loneliness, loneliness, thou [are]\nmine home\u201d (Kodera 1987, 6). A solution to the modern\npredicament of estrangement, loneliness and helplessness came to be\nfound, for Watsuji, in our social interconnections. What modern\nWestern society was losing with great rapidity, was still evident in\nJapanese society, where individuality was tempered with a strong\nsocial consciousness, and this more balanced sense of self could be\nfound in the earliest of Japanese cultural documents.\nS\u014dseki\u2019s proposed solution was to \u201cfollow Heaven,\nforsake the self\u201d (Kodera 1987, 6), but Watsuji\u2019s more\nhumanistic remedy for an egoism which inevitably led to estrangement,\nwas to reinvest in one\u2019s social interconnectedness. We are not\nonly by nature social beings, but we inevitably come into the world\nalready in relationship: with our language and culture, traditions and\nexpectations, parents, caregivers, and teachers. It is a myth of\nabstraction that we come into the world as isolated egos. \n\nWatsuji graduated from Tokyo University in 1912, but not without a\nfrantic effort to write a second thesis in a very short span of time,\nbecause the topic of his first thesis was deemed unacceptable.\nFurukawa Tetsushi notes that \u201cat the time the atmosphere in the\nFaculty of Philosophy was inimical to the study of a poet-philosopher\nlike Nietzsche. Consequently, Watsuji\u2019s \u2018Nietzschean\nStudies\u2019 was rejected as a suitable graduation thesis\u201d\n(Furukawa 1961, 219). In its place he was obliged to substitute a\nsecond thesis on Schopenhauer, which he entitled\n\u201cSchopenhauer\u2019s Pessimism and Theory of Salvation.\u201d\nThis thesis \u201cwas presented only just in time\u201d for him to\ngraduate (Furukawa 1961, 219). Both theses were eventually published.\n\n\nWatsuji enrolled in the graduate school of Tokyo Imperial University\nin 1912, the same year that he completed his undergraduate studies.\nHis studies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in 1912, and of Kierkegaard\nin 1915 provide ample evidence of his interest in and competence in\nWestern philosophy. At the same time, he continued to study the\nRomantic poets, Byron, Shelley, Tennyson and Keats, being torn between\nhis literary and philosophical interests. In any case, perhaps because\nhis literary attempts were \u201ccomplete failures,\u201d he decided\nto give \u201cup literary creation and devoted all his exertions to\nthe writing of critical essays and philosophical treatises\u201d\n(Furukawa 1961, 218). It was not long before he was in demand as a\nteacher, first as a lecturer at T\u014dy\u014d University in 1920, an\ninstructor at H\u014dsei University in 1922, an instructor at\nKei\u014d University in 1922\u201323, and at the Tsuda Eigaku-juku\nfrom 1922\u201324 (Dilworth et al 1998, 221). But his real break came in\n1925, when Nishida Kitar\u014d and Hatano Seiichi offered him the\nposition of lecturer in the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of\nLiterature at Kyoto Imperial University, where he was to take on the\nresponsibility for the courses in ethics. This put him at the center\nof the developing Kyoto School philosophy. As was the custom at the\ntime with promising young scholars, he was sent to Germany in 1927 on\na three-year scholarship. His reflections on that sojourn in Europe\nbecame the substance of his highly successful book,\nF\u016bdo, which has been translated into English as\nClimate and Culture. In fact, Watsuji spent only fourteen\nmonths in Europe, being forced to return to Japan in the summer of\n1928 because of the death of his father. In 1929, he also took on a\npart-time position at Ry\u00fbkoku University, and in 1931, he became\na professor at Kyoto Imperial University. In 1934, he was appointed\nprofessor in the Faculty of Literature at Tokyo Imperial University,\nand he continued to hold this important post until his retirement in\n1949. Perhaps part of the reason that he is so often viewed as someone\non the periphery of the Kyoto School philosophic tradition has to do\nwith his work in Tokyo, geographically removed from the center of\ndiscussion and dialogue in Kyoto. \n\nOne cannot help but be impressed by the extent of his published\noutput, as well as by its remarkable diversity, spanning literature,\nthe arts, philosophy, cultural theory, as well as Japanese, Chinese,\nIndian, and Western traditions. In addition to his studies of\nSchopenhauer (1912), Nietzsche (1913), and Kierkegaard (1915), in\n1919, he published Koji junrei (Pilgrimages to the\nAncient Temples in Nara ), his study of the temples and artistic\ntreasures of Nara, a work that became exceptionally popular. In 1920\ncame Nihon kodai bunka (Ancient Japanese Culture), a\nstudy of Japanese antiquity, including Japan\u2019s most ancient\nwritings, the Kojiki and Nihongi. In 1925, he published the\nfirst volume of Nihon seishinshi kenky\u016b (A Study of\nthe History of the Japanese Spirit), with the second volume\nappearing in 1935. This study contained his investigation of\nD\u014dgen\u2019s work (in Shamon D\u014dgen, [The Monk\nD\u014dgen ]), and it can be said that it was Watsuji who\nsingle-handedly brought D\u014dgen\u2019s work out of nearly total\nobscurity, into the forefront of philosophical discussion. Also, in\n1925, he published Kirisutoky\u014d no bunkashiteki igi\n(The Significance of Primitive Christianity in Cultural\nHistory), followed by Genshi Bukky\u014d no jissen\ntetsugaku (The Practical Philosophy of Primitive\nBuddhism) in 1927. \n\nReturning from Europe in 1928, he continued at Kyoto Imperial\nUniversity until his appointment as professor at Tokyo Imperial\nUniversity in 1934. In 1929, he edited D\u014dgen\u2019s\nSh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d zuimonki. Watsuji received his\ndegree of Doctor of Letters, based on his The Practical Philosophy\nof Primitive Buddhism in 1932. He wrote as well A Critique of\nHomer at about this time, a work that was not published until\n1946. Also in 1932 he wrote Porisuteki ningen no rinrigaku\n(The Ethics of the Man of the Greek Polis), which was not\npublished until 1948. In 1936, he completed his K\u014dshi\n(Confucius). In 1935, he completed the important Ethics as the\nStudy of Man (Ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku), to\nbe followed by his three volume expansion of his views on ethics,\nRinrigaku (Ethics) appearing successively in 1937,\n1942, and 1949. \n\nIn 1938, he published Jinkaku to jinruisei (Personality\nand Humanity), and in 1943, he published his two volume\nSonn\u014d shis\u014d to sono dent\u014d (The Idea of\nReverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Tradition). This\nlatter publication is one of the works for which Watsuji was branded a\nright-wing, reactionary thinker. In 1944, he published a volume of two\nessays, Nihon no shind\u014d (The Way of the Japanese [Loyal]\nSubject; and Amerika no kokominsei (The Character of the\nAmerican People), and in 1948, The Symbol of National Unity\n(Kokumin t\u014dg\u014d no sh\u014dch\u014d). His last\npublications were the best-selling Sakoku\u2014Nihonno\nhigeki (A Closed Country\u2014The Tragedy of Japan) in\n1950, Uzumoreta Nihon (Buried Japan) in 1951,\nNihon rinri shis\u014dshi (History of Japanese Ethical\nThought) in two volumes in 1953, Katsura riky\u00fb: seisaku\nkatei no k\u014dsatsu (The Katsura Imperial Villa:\nReflections on the Process of Its Construction) in 1955, and\nNihon geijutsu kenky\u016b (A Study of Japanese\nArt), also published in 1955. \n\nBy any standard, this is an impressive array of major publications,\nseveral of them extremely influential both with the world of\nscholarship, and among the general public as well. One cannot but be\nimpressed by the breadth of Watsuji\u2019s interests, by the depth of\nhis scholarship, and by his ability as a remarkably clear and graceful\nwriter. Yet his  F\u016bdo (Climate and Culture),\nand his studies in ethics, particularly his Rinrigaku stand\nout as his two most influential publications. \n2. The Philosophy of Watsuji\n\nThe foundations of Watsuji\u2019s thought were the extensive studies\nin Western philosophy that he engaged in during his earlier years, up\nuntil 1917 or 1918, followed by his extensive studies in Japanese and\nFar Eastern philosophy and culture. Upon his return from Europe in\n1928, and as a direct result of being among the very first to read\nMartin Heidegger\u2019s Sein und Zeit, Watsuji began work on\nF\u016bdo (F\u016bdo ningen-gakuteki k\u014dsatsu),\ntranslated into English as Climate and Culture.\n\u2018F\u016bdo\u2019 means \u201cwind and\nearth\u2026the natural environment of a given land\u201d (Watsuji\n1988 [1961], 1). We are all inescapably environed by our land, its\ngeography and topography, its climate and weather patterns,\ntemperature and humidity, soils and oceans, its flora and fauna, and\nso on, in addition to the resultant human styles of living, related\nartifacts, architecture, food choices, and clothing. This is but a\npartial list, but even this sketchy list makes clear that Watsuji is\ncalling attention to the many ways in which our environment, taken in\nthe broad sense, shapes who we are from birth to\ndeath. Heidegger\u2019s emphasis was on time and the individual, and\ntoo little, according to Watsuji, on space and the social dimensions\nof human beings. When we add to our sense of climate as including not\nonly the natural geographic setting of a people and the region\u2019s\nweather patterns, but also the social environment of family,\ncommunity, society at large, lifestyle, and even the technological\napparatus that supports community survival and interaction, then we\nbegin to glimpse what Watsuji had in mind by climate, and how there\nexists a mutuality of influence from human to environment, and\nenvironment to human being which allows for the continued evolution of\nboth. Climate is the entire interconnected network of influences that\ntogether create an entire people\u2019s attitudes and\nvalues. \u201cHistory and nature,\u201d remarks Yuasa Yasuo,\n\u201clike man\u2019s mind and body, are in an inseparable\nrelationship\u201d (Yuasa 1996, 168).  Culture is that mutuality of\ninfluence, recorded over eons of time past, which continues to effect\nthe cultural present of a people. Who we are is not simply what we\nthink, or what we choose as individuals in our aloneness, but is also\nthe result of the climatic space into which we are born, live, love,\nand die. \n\nEven before his travels in Europe (1927\u201328), Watsuji was\nconvinced that one\u2019s environment was central in shaping persons\nand cultures. In Guzo Saiku (Revival of Idols),\npublished in 1918, he had concluded that \u201call inquiries into the\nculture of Japan must in their final reduction go back to the study of\nher nature\u201d (Furukawa 1961, 214). From about 1918 on,\nWatsuji\u2019s focus became the articulation of what it is that\nconstitutes the Japanese spirit. Ancient Japanese Culture,\nwhich he wrote in 1920, is an attempt to revitalize Japan\u2019s\noldest Chronicles (the Kojiki and Nihongi) using\nmodern literary techniques as well as newly available archaeological\nevidence. He treated these collections of ancient stories, legends,\npoems, songs, and myths as literature, rather than as sacred\nscripture. Quoting from the Kojiki the imaginative story of\ncreation, he then glosses this rich account: \u201c\u2018When the\nland was still young and as a piece of floating grease, drifting about\nas does a jellyfish, there came into existence a god, issuing from\nwhat grew up like a reed-bud\u2026\u2019 [is] a superb\u2026image\nof a piece of grease floating about without definite form like a thin,\nmuddy substance far thicker than water, yet not solid, and of the\nimage of a soft jellyfish with a formless form drifting on the water,\nand of the image of exuberant life of a reed-bud sprouting powerfully\nout of the muddy water of a swampy marsh. There is no other\ndescription that I know of that so graphically depicts the state of\nthe world before creation\u201d (Furukawa 1961, 221\u201322). It is\na concrete and graphic depiction of the formlessness out of which all\nthings arose, and is perhaps an early attempt at talk of nothingness,\na central idea of the Kyoto School, and later on for Watsuji as well.\n\n\nNot only can one discern his early interest in the importance of\nnothingness in his thinking, but there is also indication that he was\nsensitive to the non-dual immediacy of experience, which Nishida\ndescribed as pure experience  (see Section 2.1 of the entry\non\n Nishida Kitar\u014d.\n As though discovering the roots of Nishida\u2019s pure experience,\nhe writes that \u201cthe ancient poets, whose feelings still retain a\nvirgin simplicity as a single undivided experience, are not yet\ntroubled by this division of the subjective and the objective\u201d\n(as found in Japan\u2019s oldest collection of poems, the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b) (Furukawa 1961, 224). Natural\nbeauty, for the poet, is as yet an undivided experience, a pure\nexperience which is prior to the subject/object dichotomy, a total\nimmersion in the moment without thought or reflection, in an ecstasy\nof feeling. In his Preface to Revival of Idols he warns that\nhe intends not \u201ca mere \u2018revival of the old,\u2019\u201d\nbut rather what he wished to achieve \u201cis nothing more or nothing\nless than to advance such life as lives in the everlasting New\u201d\n(Furukawa 1961, 227). To revive the old, then, is to cause it to shine\nanew, but in the light of contemporary issues and concerns. It is to\nrevive its meaning for us, here and now, and not merely to show that\nit had meaning in the past. As part of one\u2019s cultural climate,\nthe past inevitably operates still in the present of every Japanese.\nIt was this still active element that Watsuji sought to uncover, and\nto express in such a way as to allow others to share in the present\ninfused with the past in the consciousness of their own lives, rather\nthan in some unconscious and only partially developed way. Similarly,\nhe attempted to reveal the relevance of primitive Christianity,\nprimitive Buddhism, and Confucianism as cultural inheritances which\ncontinue to shape people in various \u2018climates\u2019 around the\nworld. He made explicit what was implicit, and he sought to revitalize\nthe active ingredients of cultural traditions for right\n\u2018now\u2019. \n\nIn the Preface to Climate and Culture, Watsuji states that\nwhen we come to consider both the natural and the human cultural\nclimate in which we find ourselves, we render both nature and culture\nas \u201calready objectified, with the result that we find ourselves\nexamining the relation between object and object, and there is no link\nwith subjective human existence\u201d (Watsuji 1961, v). Watsuji\ndistinguishes his interpretation of f\u016bdo,\n\u201cliterally \u2018Wind and Earth\u2019 in Japanese\u201d\n(Watsuji 1961, 1) from what he maintained was its then conventional\nunderstanding simply as a term used for natural environment \u2014\nsomething that is a resource to be used, or an object separate from or\nmerely alongside our being-in-the-world. The phenomena of climate must\nbe seen \u201cas expressions of subjective human existence and not of\nnatural environment\u201d (Watsuji 1961, v). He explains this using\nthe example of the phenomenon of cold, a single climatic\nfeature. Ordinarily, we think of \u2018us\u2019 and\n\u2018coldness\u2019 as objectively distinct and separate from us.\nPhenomenologically, however, we only come to know that it is cold\nafter we actually feel it as cold. Coldness does not press upon us\nfrom the outside; rather, we are already out in the cold. As Heidegger\nemphasized, we \u2018ex-istere\u2019 outside of ourselves,\nand in this case, in the cold. It is not the cold which is outside of\nus, but we who are already out in the cold. And we feel this cold in\ncommon with other people. We all talk about the weather. To\nexistere, then, means that we experience the cold with other\n\u2018I\u2019s. We experience coldness within ourselves, with\nothers, and \u201cin relation to the soil, the topographic and scenic\nfeatures and so on of a given land\u201d (Watsuji 1961, 5). In a\ntelling, and poetically adept passage, he writes that a cold wind may\nbe experienced as a sharp mountain blast, or a dry wind sweeping\nthrough a city at the end of winter, or \u201cthe spring breeze may\nbe one which blows off cherry blossoms or which caresses the\nwaves\u201d (Watsuji 1961, 5). All weather is as much\n\u2018subjective\u2019 as it is \u2018objective.\u2019 \n\nBecause of the cold, we must decide upon sources of heat for our\nhouses, design and create appropriate clothing (for each of the\nseasons and conditions), seek proper ventilation, defend ourselves and\nour houses against special conditions (floods, monsoon rains,\ntyphoons, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, etc.),\ncounteract excessive humidity in some way, and we must learn how to\ngrow our food and eat in ways compatible with the climatic conditions,\nand our capabilities of farming and gathering. We apprehend ourselves\nin climate, revealing ourselves to ourselves as both social and\nhistorical beings. Here is the crux of Watsuji\u2019s insight, and of\nhis criticism of Heidegger\u2019s Sein und Zeit: to\nemphasize our being in time is \u201cto discover human existence on\nthe level only of individual consciousness\u201d (Watsuji 1961, 9).\nAs temporal beings, we can exist alone, in isolative reflection. On\nthe other hand, if we recognize the \u2018dual character\u2019 of\nhuman beings as existing in both time and space, as both individuals\nand social beings, \u201cthen it is immediately clear that space must\nbe regarded as linked with time\u201d (Watsuji 1961, 9). Space is\ninextricably linked with time, and the individual and social aspects\nof ourselves are inextricably linked as well, and our history and\nculture are linked to our climate. And while change is constant, and\nhence all structures are continuously evolving, this evolution is\ninextricably linked to our history, traditions, and cultural forms of\nexpression. We discover ourselves in climate, and it is because of\nclimate that we have come to express ourselves as we have:\n\u201cclimate\u2026is the agent by which human life is\nobjectivised\u201d (Watsuji 1961, 14). In order to more faithfully\nconvey Watsuji\u2019s notion of f\u016bdo, Augustin Berque\nsuggests \u201cmilieu\u201d as a more preferable translation than\nclimate. Milieu more accurately captures the mutual\nco-constituting at the heart of f\u016bdo. For Watsuji, the\nnotion of f\u016bdo is supposed to suggest that the spatial,\nenvironmental, and collective aspects of human existence are all\nintertwined (Berque, 1994, 498).\n\nClimate, or milieu, serves as the always present background to what\nbecomes the foreground focus for Watsuji, the study of Japanese ethics\nin practice and in theory. Ethics is the study of the ways in which\nmen and women, adults and children, the rulers and those ruled, have\ncome to deal with each other in their specific climatic conditions.\nEthics is the pattern of proper and effective social interaction. \n3. Ethics\n\nWatsuji\u2019s objection to individualistic ethics, which he\nassociated with virtually all Western thinkers to some degree, is that\nit loses touch with the vast network of interconnections that serves\nto make us human. We are individuals inescapably immersed in the\nspace/time world, together with others. Individual persons, if\nconceived of in isolation from their various social contexts, do not\nand cannot exist except as abstractions. Our way of being in the world\nis an expression of countless people and countless actions performed\nin a particular \u2018climate,\u2019 which together have shaped us\nas we are. Indeed a human being is a unified structure of past,\npresent, and future; each of us is an intersection of past and future,\nin the present \u2018now.\u2019 There is no possibility of the\nisolation of the ego, and yet many write as though there were. They\nare able to make a case of it, in part because they ignore the\nspatiality of ningen (human being), focussing on\nningen\u2019s temporality. Watsuji believed that it was far\nmore difficult to consider a human being as strictly an individual,\nwhen thought of as a being in space. Spatially, we move in a common\nfield, and that field is cultural in that it is criss-crossed by roads\nand paths, and even by forms of communication such as messenger\nservices, postal routes, newspapers, flyers, broadcasts over great\ndistances, all in addition to everyday polite conversation. Watsuji\nmakes a point of the legend of the isolated and hopelessly marooned\nRobinson Crusoe, for even Robinson Crusoe continued to be culturally\nconnected, continuing to speak an inherited language, and improvising\nhousing, food, and clothing based on past social experiences, and\ncontinuing to hope for rescue at the hands of unknown others. Watsuji\nrejects all such \u2018desert island\u2019 constructions as mere\nabstractions. Thomas Hobbes imagined a state of nature in which we are\nradically discrete individuals, at a time before significant social\ninterconnections have been established. Watsuji counters that we are\ninescapably born into social relationships, beginning with one\u2019s\nmother, and one\u2019s caregivers. Our very beginnings are etched by\nthe relational interconnections which keep us alive, educate us, and\ninitiate us into the proper ways of social interaction. \n\nAt the center of Watsuji\u2019s study of Japanese ethics is his\nanalysis of the human person, in Japanese, ningen. In his\nRinrigaku, he affirms that ethics is, in the final analysis,\nthe study of human persons. Offering an etymological analysis, as he\ndoes so often, he displays the important complexity in the meaning of\nningen. Ningen is composed of two characters,\nnin, meaning \u2018person\u2019 or \u2018human\nbeing,\u2019 and gen, meaning \u2018space\u2019 or\n\u2018between.\u2019 He cautions that it is imperative to recognize\nthat a human being is not just an individual, but is also a member of\nmany social groupings. We are individuals, and yet we are not just\nindividuals, for we are also social beings; and we are social beings,\nbut we are not just social beings, for we are also individuals. Many\nwho interpret Watsuji forget the importance which he gave to this\nbalanced and dual-nature of a human being. They read the words, but\nthen go on to argue that he really gives priority to the\ncollectivistic or social aspect of what it means to be a human being.\nThat such an imbalance often occurs in Japanese society may be the\nreason for this conclusion. Yet it does not fit Watsuji\u2019s\ntheoretical position, which is that we are, at one and the same time,\nboth individual and social. In A Study of the History of the\nJapanese Spirit (1935) Watsuji cautions that \u201c\u2026the\ncommunion between man and man does not mean their becoming merely one.\nIt is only through the fact that men are unique individuals that a\ncooperation between \u2018man and man\u2019 can be realized\u201d\n(Watsuji 1935, 112). The tension between one\u2019s individual and\none\u2019s social nature must not be slackened, or else the one is\nlikely to overwhelm the other. He makes this point even clearer in\ndiscussing the creation of renga poetry, in the same volume.\nRenga poems are not created by a single individual but by a\ngroup of poets, with each individual verse linked to the next, and\neach verse the creation of a single individual, and yet each must\ncohere with the \u2018poetic sphere\u2019 as a whole. Watsuji\nconcludes, \u201cif there are self-centered persons in the company, a\ncertain \u2018distortion\u2019 will be felt and group spirit itself\nwill not be produced. When there are people, who, lacking\nindividuality, are influenced only by others\u2019 suggestions, a\ncertain \u2018lack of power\u2019 will be felt, and a creative\nenthusiasm will not appear. It is by means of attaining to Nothingness\nwhile each remains individual to the last, or in other words, by means\nof movements based on the great Void by persons each of whom has\nattained his own fulfilment, that the company will be complete and\ninterest for creativity will be roused\u201d (Watsuji 1935, 113).\nIndividuality is not, and must not be lost, else the balance is\ndestroyed, and creativity will not effectively arise. What is required\nis that we become selfless, no longer self-centered, and open to the\ncommunal sense of the whole group or society. It is a sense of\nindividuality that is aware of social, public interconnections. \n\nOne expresses one\u2019s individuality by negating the\nsocial group or by rebelling against various social expectations or\nrequirements. To be an individual demands that one negate the\nsupremacy of the group. On the other hand, to envision oneself as a\nmember of a group is to negate one\u2019s individuality. But is this\nan instance of poor logic? One can remain an individual and as such\njoin as many groups as one wishes. Or one can think of oneself as an\nindividual and yet as a parent, a worker, an artist, a theatre goer,\nand so forth. Watsuji understood this, but his argument is that it is\npossible to think in such ways only if one has already granted logical\npriority to the individual qua individual. Whatever group one\nbelongs to, one belongs to it as an individual, and this individuality\nis not quenchable, except through death, or inauthenticity.\nNevertheless, Watsuji\u2019s conception of what he calls the\n\u2018negation of negation\u2019 has a quite different, and perhaps\ndeeper emphasis. To extricate ourselves from one or another\nsocio-cultural inheritance, perhaps the acceptance of the Shinto\nfaith, one has to rebel against this socio-cultural form by affirming\none\u2019s individuality in such a way as to negate its overt\ninfluence on oneself. This is to negate an aspect of one\u2019s\nhistory by affirming one\u2019s individuality. But the second\nnegation occurs when one becomes a truly ethical human being, and one\nnegates one\u2019s individual separateness by abandoning one\u2019s\nindividual independence from others. What we have now is a forgetting\nof the self, as D\u014dgen urged (\u201cto study the way is to study\nthe self, to study the self is to forget the self, to forget the self\nis to become enlightened by all things\u201d), which yields a\n\u2018selfless\u2019 morality. To be truly human is not the\nasserting of one\u2019s individuality, but an annihilation of\nself-centeredness such that one is now identified with others in a\nnondualistic merging of self and others. Benevolence or compassion\nresults from this selfless identification. This is our authentic\n\u2018home ground,\u2019 and it rekindles our awareness of our true\nand original nature. This home ground he calls\n\u2018nothingness,\u2019 about which more will be said below. \n\nWatsuji\u2019s analysis of gen is of equal interest. He\nmakes much of the notion of \u2018betweenness,\u2019 or\n\u2018relatedness.\u2019 He traces gen (ken) back\nto its earlier form, aida or aidagara, which refers\nto the space or place in which people are located, and in which the\nvarious crossroads of relational interconnection are established.\nWatsuji\u2019s now famous former student, Yuasa Yasuo, observes that\n\u201cthis betweenness consists of the various human relationships of\nour life-world. To put it simply, it is the network which provides\nhumanity with a social meaning, for example, one\u2019s being an\ninhabitant of this or that town or a member of a certain business\nfirm. To live as a person means\u2026to exist in such\nbetweenness\u201d (Yuasa 1987, 37). As individuals, we are private\nbeings, but as social beings we are public beings. We enter the world\nalready within a network of relationships and obligations. Each of us\nis a nexus of pathways and roads, and our betweenness is already\netched by the natural and cultural climate that we inherit and live\nour lives within. With the social aspect of self being more\nforegrounded in Japan than in the West (especially at the time Watsuji\nwas writing), it is imperative, therefore, that one know how to\nnavigate these relational waters successfully, appropriately, and with\nrelative ease and assurance. The study of these relational\nnavigational patterns\u2014between the individual and the family,\nself and society, as well as one\u2019s relationship to the\nmilieu\u2014is the study of ethics. \n\nWatsuji usually writes of ningen sonzai, and sonzai\n(existence) is composed of two characters, son (which means\nto preserve, to sustain over time), and zai (to stay in\nplace, and in this case, to persevere in one\u2019s relationships).\nNingen sonzai, then, refers to human nature as individual yet\nsocial, private as well as public, with our coming together in\nrelationship occurring in the betweenness between us, which\nrelationships we preserve and nourish to the fullest. Ethics has to do\nwith the ways in which we, as human beings, respect, preserve, and\npersevere in the vast complexity of interconnections which etch\nthemselves upon us as individuals, thereby forming our natures as\nsocial selves, and providing the necessary foundation for the creation\nof cooperative and workable societies. \n\nThe Japanese word for ethics is rinri, which is composed of\ntwo characters, rin and ri. Rin means\n\u2018fellows,\u2019 \u2018company,\u2019 and specifically refers\nto a system of relations guiding human association. Ri means\n\u2018reason,\u2019 or \u2018principle,\u2019 the rational\nordering of human relationships. These principles are what make it\npossible for human beings to live in a cooperative community. Watsuji\nrefers to the ancient Confucian patterns of human interaction as\nbetween parent and child, lord and vassal, husband and wife, young and\nold, and friend and friend. Presumably, one also acquires a sense of\nthe appropriate and ethical in all other relationships as one grows to\nmaturity in society. If enacted properly these relationships, which\noccur in the betweenness between us, serve as the oil which lubricates\ninteraction with others in such a way as to minimize abrasive\noccurrences, and to maximize smooth and positive relationships. One\ncan think of the betweenness between each of us as a basho,\nan empty space, in which we can either reach out to the other in order\nto create a relationship of positive value, or to shrink back, or to\nlash out, making a bad situation worse. The space is pure potential,\nand what we do with it depends on the degree to which we can encounter\nthe other in a fruitful and appropriate manner in that betweenness.\nNevertheless, every encounter is already etched with the cultural\ntraditions of genuine encounter; ideally positive expectation, good\nwill, open-heartedness, cheerfulness, sincerity, fellow-feeling, and\navailability. Ethics \u201cconsists of the laws of social\nexistence\u201d writes Watsuji (Watsuji 1996, 11). \n4. Emptiness\n\nThe annihilation of the self, as the negation of negation\n\u201cconstitutes the basis of every selfless morality since ancient\ntimes,\u201d asserts Watsuji (Watsuji 1996, 225). The negating of the\ngroup or society, and the emptying of the individual in\nWatsuji\u2019s sense of the negation of each by the other pole of\nningen, makes evident that both are ultimately\n\u2018empty,\u2019 causing one to reflect upon that which is\nultimate, and at the base of both one\u2019s individuality and the\ngroups with which one associates. The losing of self is a returning to\none\u2019s authenticity, to one\u2019s home ground as that source\nfrom which all things derive, and by which they are sustained. It is\nthe abandonment of the self as independent which paves the way for the\nnondual relation between the self and others that terminates in the\nactivity of benevolence and compassion through a unification of minds.\nThe ethics of benevolence is the development of the capacity to\nembrace others as oneself or, more precisely, to forget one\u2019s\nself such that the distinction between the self and other does not\narise in this nondualistic awareness. One has now abandoned\none\u2019s self, one\u2019s individuality, and become the authentic\nground of the self and the other as the realization of absolute\ntotality. Ethics is now a matter of spontaneous compassion,\nspontaneous caring, and concern for the whole. This is the birth of\nselfless morality, for which the only counterparts in the West are the\nmystical traditions and perhaps some forms of religiosity in which it\nis God who moves in us, and not we ourselves. The double negation\nreferred to earlier whereby the individual is negated by the group\naspect of self, and the group aspect is in turn negated by the\nindividual aspect, is not to be taken as a complete negation that\nobliterates that which is negated. The negated are preserved, else\nthere would be no true self-contradiction. This robust sense of the\nimportance of self-contradiction shares much with the more developed\nsense of the identity of self-contradiction about which Nishida said\nso much (see the entry on\n Nishida Kitar\u014d).\n What is stressed by both thinkers is that some judgments of logical\ncontradiction are at best penultimate judgments, which may point us in\nthe direction of a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of\nour own experience. Watsuji refers to \u2018wakaru \u2019\n(to understand), which is derived from \u2018wakeru \u2019\n(to divide); and in order to understand, one must already have\npresupposed something whole, that is to say, a system or unity. For\nexample, in self-reflection, we make our own self, other. Yet\nthe distinction reveals the original unity, for the self is other as\nobjectified and of course is divided from the originally unified self.\nTo think of a thing is to distinguish it from something else, and yet\nin order to make such a distinction, the two must already have had\nsomething in common. Thus, to emphasize the contradiction is to plunge\ninto the world as many; to emphasize the context, or background, or\nmatrix is to plunge into the world as one. Readers will be familiar\nwith the logical formulation, often encountered in Zen but ubiquitous\nin Buddhism generally, that A is A; and A\nis not-A; therefore, A is A. There is a\ndouble negation in evidence here: an individual is an individual, and\nyet an individual is not individual unless one stands opposed to other\nindividuals. That an individual stands opposed to others means that\none is related to others as a member of a group or groups. Because an\nindividual is a member of a group, one is both a member as an\nindividual, and an otherwise isolated individual as a member of a\ngroup. We are both, in mutual interactive negation, and as such we are\ndetermined by the group or community, and yet we ourselves determine\nand shape the group or community. As such we are living\nself-contradictions, and, therefore, living identities of\nself-contradiction. \n\nMorality, for Watsuji, is a coming back to authentic unity through an\ninitial opposition between the self and other, and then a\nre-establishing of betweenness between self and other, ideally\nculminating in a nondualistic connection between the self and others\nthat actually negates any trace of difference or opposition in the\nemptiness of the home ground. This is the negation of negation, and it\noccurs in both time and space. It is not simply a matter of\nenlightenment as a private, individual experience, calling one to\nawareness of the interconnectedness of all things. Rather, it is a\nspatio-temporal series of interconnected actions, occurring in the\nbetweenness between us, which leads us to an awareness of betweenness\nthat ultimately eliminates the self and other, but of course, only\nfrom within a nondualist perspective. Dualistically comprehended, both\nthe self and other are preserved. As the Zen saying goes, \u201cnot\none, not two.\u201d As Taigen Dan Leighton explains,\n\u201cnonduality is not about transcending the duality of form and\nemptiness. This deeper nonduality is not the opposite of duality, but\nthe synthesis of duality and nonduality, with both included, and both\nseen as ultimately not separate, but as integrated\u201d(Leighton\n2004, 35). For Watsuji, emptiness is what makes the subject-object\nrelation, or better, the relation both inherent in ningen and\nbetween ningen possible. What is left is betweenness itself\nin which human actions occur. In this sense, betweenness is emptiness,\nand emptiness is betweenness. Betweenness is the place where\ncompassion arises and is acted out selflessly in the spatio-temporal\ntheatre of the world. It is that which makes possible the variety of\nrelationships of which human beings are capable. Watsuji\u2019s\nningen views each person\u2019s ethical identity as\nintegrally related to that of others and extends it beyond merely\nhuman relations. Self and other, self and nature, are viewed as\ninseparable from ethical identity and are related to, rather than\nviewed as opposed to or exclusive of each other. In Watsuji\u2019s\nningen we find this nondualism lived out in ways that extend\nethical identity beyond relations between human beings to encompass\nthe world in which we live \u2014 it is part of milieu or\nf\u016bdo. \n5. The State\n\nWatsuji\u2019s theory of the state, and his vocal support of the\nEmperor system, garnered considerable criticism after the Second World\nWar. La Fleur maintains that Watsuji\u2019s detractors were\n\u201cdominant in Japanese intellectual life from 1945 to\napproximately 1975,\u201d while his admirers became \u201cnewly\narticulate since the decade of the 1980s\u201d (LaFleur 1994, 453).\nThe former group considered his position to be a dangerous one. He\nargued that the culmination of the double negation, which he conceived\nof as a single movement, was the restoration of the absolute totality.\nIn other words, while the individual negates the group in order to be\nan authentic and independent individual, the second negation is to\nabandon one\u2019s independence as an individual in the full\nrealization of totality. It is a \u2018surrender\u2019 to totality,\nmoving one beyond the myriad specific groups to the one total and\nabsolute whole. It would seem natural that this ultimate wholeness\nwould be the home ground of nothingness, and in a way it is. But\nWatsuji argues that it is the state that takes on the authority of\ntotality. It is the highest and best social structure thus far. The\npolitical implications of this position could easily result in a\ntotalitarian state ethics. Indeed, Watsuji extolled the superiority of\ntraditional Japanese culture because of its emphasis on self-negation,\nincluding the making of the ultimate sacrifice if required by the\nEmperor. In America\u2019s National Character (1944), he\ncontrasted this willingness to an assumed selfishness or egocentrism\nfound in the West, together with a utilitarian ethic of expediency,\nwhich he felt was rarely able to commit to self-surrender in aid of\nthe state. What he saw as most exemplary in the Japanese way of life\nwas the Bushido ideal of \u201cthe absolute negativity of the\nsubject\u201d (Odin 1996, 67), through which the totality of the\nwhole is able to be achieved. There is no doubt that Watsuji\u2019s\nposition could easily be interpreted as a totalitarian state ethics.\nYet, insofar as Watsuji\u2019s analysis of Japanese ethics is an\naccount of how the Japanese do actually act in the world, then it is\nlittle surprise that the Japanese errors of excess which culminated in\nthe fascism of the Second World War period should be found somehow\nimplicit and possible in Watsuji\u2019s acute presentation of\nJapanese cultural history. Perhaps the fault to be found lies not in\nhis analysis per se, but rather in his all too sanguine collapsing of\nthe descriptive and the prescriptive. That the Japanese\nway-in-the-world might include a totalitarian seed is something which\ndemands a normative warning. Surely this is not what should be\napplauded as an aspect of the alleged superiority of Japanese culture,\nnor should Bushido in and of itself be taken as a blameless path to\nthe highest of ethical achievements. The willingness to be loyal,\nwhatever the rights and wrongs of the situation might be, in order to\nremain loyal to one\u2019s Lord, however evil or foolhardy he might\nbe, is not an adequate or rational position, and it is surely not\nlaudable ethically. It is, perhaps, the way the samurai saw\nthemselves, as martial servants loyal to death. But the\n\u2018is\u2019 here is clearly not a moral \u2018ought\u2019. \n\nWhat Watsuji adds to this picture which makes it extremely difficult\nto condemn him too harshly, and possibly to condemn him at all, is his\nadament insistence in the third volume of Rinrigaku that no\none nation has charted the correct political and cultural path, and\nthat the diversity of each is to be both encouraged and respected. He\nwrites of unity in diversity, and rejects the idea that any nation has\nthe right to culturally assimilate another. Each nation is shaped by\nits particular geography, climate, culture and history, and the\nresultant diversity is both to be protected and appreciated, and the\nnotion of a universal state is, therefore, but an unwanted and\ndangerous delusion. We must know our own traditions, and to cherish\nthose, but we must not extol them as superior out of our ignorance of\nother ways and cultural traditions. In fact, such ignorance, resulting\nfrom Japan\u2019s unwise self-imposed isolationism, Watsuji saw as\nthe most tragic flaw in Japan\u2019s own history, and a cause of the\nSecond World War. Japan knew so little of the outside world in the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, that it exaggerated its\nown worth and power, and vastly underestimated the importance of\npolitical and diplomatic involvement in the happenings of the rest of\nthe world. Nationalism must not express itself at the expense of\ninternationalism, and internationalism must not establish itself at\nthe expense of nationalism. Here is another pair of seeming\ncontradictions to be held together by the unity of mutual interaction;\nthe one modifies the other, and that tension is not to be resolved.\nInternationalism must be a unity of independent and distinctive\nnations. \n\nFive months before the end of the Second World War, Watsuji organized\na study group to re-think the Tokugawa Period (1600-1868), which\nresulted in his popular work, Closed Nation: Japan\u2019s\nTragedy (Sakoku), published in 1950. Some critics\nreacted by dubbing this work \u201cWatsuji\u2019s Tragedy\u201d\n(LaFleur 2001, 1), yet La Fleur insists that Sakoku, together\nwith a collection of other contemporaneous writings, provides a\nserious and important insight into Watsuji\u2019s later philosophical\nposition. His focal thesis was that the tragedy of the Japanese\ninvolvement in the Second World War was a direct result of\nJapan\u2019s policy of national seclusion. Isolationism took Japan\nout of the events of the world\u2019s activities for two centuries,\nallowing the West to outstrip Japan in terms of science and\ntechnology. But even more important is Watsuji\u2019s insistence that\nthe nationalists and militarists should have seen that Japan was in no\nposition to win the war since both \u201cmen and materiel were in\nincreasingly short supply\u201d (LaFleur 2001, 3). Not that Watsuji\nopposed the war, but the point he was making was that the tragedy came\nto be because the earlier isolationist attitude had been revived from\n1940 on. Japan was out of touch with the strengths and determination\nof its adversaries, and seemingly convinced that the character of the\nJapanese people would ensure success. Furthermore, coupled with this\nshort-term return to a head-in-the-sand isolationism of the 1940s, was\nWatsuji\u2019s insistence that throughout most of Japan\u2019s\nhistory, the Japanese people had demonstrated an intense curiosity and\na robust desire to learn, and in particular to learn from cultures\nquite different from their own: \u201cNo matter how far we go back in\nJapanese culture we will not find an age in which evidence of\nadmiration of foreign cultures is not to be found\u201d (Watsuji\n1998, 250). Japan was withdrawing inwards at precisely the time when\nthe West\u2019s expansionism and imperialism was gathering steam.\nLaFleur goes so far as to suggest that in a 1943 lecture to Navy\nofficials, Watsuji attempted to warn those in charge of the dangerous\ncourse they continued to pursue. LaFleur speculates that this is why\nWatsuji felt no need to recant after the War had ended. The salient\npoint of all of this is that the instances of isolationism in Japanese\nhistory are exceptions which run counter to what Watsuji saw as the\ndominant tendency of the Japanese to both welcome and encourage\noutside influence. Japan\u2019s national character throughout the\nbulk of its history displays a remarkable openness to and interest in\nother cultures, and a steadfast desire to learn from those cultures.\nHe was advocating a return to this more \u2018normal\u2019 attitude\ntowards the outside world, and not a return to Japanese nationalism or\nchauvinism. Watsuji presents us with a complex perspective. \n6. Religion\n\nWatsuji\u2019s interest in religion was as a social phenomenon, that\nis, in religion as an aspect of the cultural environment. And yet in\nthe Watsuji scholarship there remains disagreement about how religion\n\u2014 Buddhism in particular \u2014 is to be read in his work\n(Sevilla 2016, 608\u2013609). William LaFleur remarks, for example, that\nWatsuji \u201cembraces a religious solution\u2026philosophically\nand methodologically\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 238). While David Dilworth\ncontends that \u201cWatsuji\u2019s position was not essentially a\nBuddhistic or religious one\u201d(Dilworth 1974, 17). While there is\ndisagreement on LaFleur\u2019s claim that \u201cit was in the\nBuddhist notion of emptiness that Watsuji found the principle that\ngives his system\u2026coherence\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 239), it\ncannot be denied that when Watsuji writes of emptiness as that final\nplace or context in which all distinctions disappear, or empty, and\nyet from which they emerge, that this notion is at least partly rooted\nin his study of Buddhist philosophy and culture, and the concept of\nemptiness in particular. Watsuji \u201cembraces a religious\nsolution\u2026philosophically and methodologically\u201d (LaFleur\n1978, 238).The Buddhist notion of\nprat\u00eetya-samutp\u00e2da, or \u2018dependent\nco-origination\u2019 (or \u2018relationality,\u2019\n\u2018conditioned co-production,\u2019 \u2018dependent\nco-arising,\u2019 \u2018co-dependent origination\u2019) implies\nthat everything is \u2018empty\u2019 that is to say, \u201cthat\neverything is deprived of its substantiality, nothing exists\nindependently, everything is related to everything else, nothing ranks\nas a first cause, and even the self is but a delusory\nconstruction\u201d (Abe 1985, 153). The delusion of independent\nindividuality can be overcome by recognizing our radical relational\ninterconnectedness. At the same time, even this negation must be\nemptied or negated, hence our radical relational interconnectedness is\npossible only because true individuals have created a network in the\nbetweenness between them. The result is a selfless awareness of that\ntotality beyond all limited, social totalities, namely the emptiness\nor nothingness at the bottom of all things, whether individual or\ngroup. LaFleur summarises Watsuji\u2019s position: \u201cthe social\nside of human existence \u2018empties\u2019 the individuated side of\nany possible priority or autonomy and the individuated side does\nsomething exactly the same and exactly proportionate to and for the\nsocial side. There can be no doubt, I think, that for Watsuji,\nemptiness is the key to it all\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 250).\nWatsuji\u2019s emptiness is more a recognition of underlying\nrelatedness, and manifests as a place, a basho, that is the\ndynamic and creative origination of all relationships and all networks\nof interactions. However, it is important to keep in mind that even\nwhen Watsuji uses religious language (as in \u201cit is a religious\necstasy of the great emptiness\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 249), that\necstasy is not a mystical-like insight into one\u2019s union with God\nor the Absolute or a recognition of floating in\n\u2018other-power,\u2019 but a relational union of those persons\ninvolved in some communal forms, eventually culminating in the state.\nIt is an ethical, or political, or communal ecstasy and not a\nreligious identification with a transcendent Other \u2013 and as much as\nwe hear the influence of Buddhism, we also hear, for example, echoed\nof the Hegelian concept of sublation (Sevilla 2016, 626). Watsuji\ngives no evidence of deep religiosity but expresses a profound and\nsometimes ecstatic ethical humanism, one which is, nonetheless,\nsignificantly Buddhist in conception. \n\nIn denying the reality of the subject/object distinction, and\naffirming the emptiness of all things, Watsuji was able to argue that\nas the individual negates or rebels against society, thereby emptying\nsociety of an unchanging objective status, and as the second negation\nestablishes the totality of society by emptying the individual, it\nreduces the individual ego to emptiness as well. Neither of the dual\ncharacteristics of ningen are either unchanging or ultimately\nreal. What is ultimate is the emptiness which is revealed as their\nbasis, for all things are empty, and yet, once this truth is realized,\nit is as individuals and societies that nothingness is expressed and\nrevealed. Emptiness negates itself, or empties itself as the beings of\nthis world. And it does this in the emptiness of betweenness, the\nempty space within which relations between individuals and societies\nform and continue to re-form. The state, as the culminating social\norganization thus far achieved, is the form of forms,\n\u201ctranscending all the other levels of social\norganization\u2026giving to each of those protected forms a proper\nplace\u201d (LaFleur 1994, 457). The state is, ultimately, \u201cthe\nmoral systematiser of all those organizations\u201d (LaFleur, french,\n457). However, the problem of the proper relation of the individual to\nsociety emerges, for Watsuji goes on to argue that \u201cthe state\nsubsumes within itself all these forms of private life and continually\nturns them into the form of the public domain\u201d (LaFleur 1994,\n457). In attempting to move away from the selfishness of egoistic\naction, Watsuji has given primacy to the state over individual and\ngroup rights. As LaFleur states, \u201cby valorizing the state as\nthat entity that has the moral authority\u2014in fact the moral\nobligation\u2014to \u2018turn private things into the public domain,\nWatsuji provides a smooth rationale for a totalizing state\u201d\n(LaFleur 1994, 458). Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that his\nintent was not to advocate tyranny or fascism, but to seek out an\nethical and social theory whereby human beings as human beings could\ninteract easily and fruitfully in the space between them, creating as\na result a society, and a world-wide association of societies which\nselflessly recognized the value of the individual and the crucial\nimportance of the well-being of the whole. His solution may have been\ninadequate, and open to unwelcome misuse. His analysis of\n\u2018betweenness\u2019 shows it to be communality, and communality\nas a mutuality wherein each individual may affect every other\nindividual and thereby affect the community or communities; and the\ncommunity, as an historical expression of the whole may affect each\nindividual. Ideally, what would result would be an enlightened sense\nof our interconnectedness with all human beings, regardless of race,\ncolor, religion, or creed, and a selfless, compassionate capacity to\nidentify with others as though they were oneself. By reintroducing a\nvivial sense of our communitarian interconnectedness, and our spatial\nand bodily place in the betweenness between us, where we meet, love,\nand strive to live ethical lives together, Watsuji provides an ethical\nand political theory which might well prove to be helpful both to\nnon-Japanese societies, and to a modern Japan itself which is torn\nbetween what it was, and what it is becoming. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"WatWor\">Watsuji\u2019s Works</a>", "<a name=\"EngTra\">English Translations of Watsuji\u2019s Work</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"WatWor\">Watsuji\u2019s Works</a>": "</h3>\n<p>\nWatsuji Tetsur\u014d, 1992, <em>Watsuji Tetsur\u014d Zensh\u016b\n(Complete Works of Watsuji Tetsur\u014d)</em>, 27 vols., Abe\nYoshishigo et al., Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten.</p>\n<h3>", "<a name=\"EngTra\">English Translations of Watsuji\u2019s Work</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1969, \u201cJapanese Ethical Thought in\nthe Noh Plays of the Muromachi Period,\u201d David Dilworth and Umeyo\nHirano (trans.), <em>Monumenta Nipponica</em>, 24: 457\u201398.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1988 [1961], <em>Climate and Culture: A\nPhilosophical Study</em>, Geoffrey Bownas (trans.), New York:\nGreenwood Press; revised and reprinted from <em>A Climate: A\nPhilosophical Study</em>, Geoffrey Bownas (trans.), Tokyo: Ministry of\neducation and Hokuseido Press, 1961.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996, <em>Watsuji Tetsur\u014d\u2019s\nRinrigaku: Ethics in Japan</em>, Yamamoto Seisaku and Robert E.
