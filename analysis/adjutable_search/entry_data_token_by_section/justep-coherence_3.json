Other Accounts of Coherence\n\nWe will return, in section 6, to the problem of defining the\ntraditional concept of coherence while addressing some of the concerns\nthat we have raised, e.g., concerning the relationship between\ncoherence and system size. The point of departure for the present\ndiscussion, however, is the observation that several prominent\nself-proclaimed coherentists construe the central concept, and to some\nextent also its role in philosophical inquiry, in ways that depart\nsomewhat from the traditional view. Among them we find Nicolas\nRescher, Keith Lehrer and Paul Thagard.\n\nCentral in Rescher\u2019s account, as laid out in Rescher (1973), his most\ninfluential book on the subject, is the notion of a truth-candidate. A\nproposition is a truth-candidate if there is something that speaks in\nits favor. Rescher\u2019s truth-candidates are related to Lewis\u2019s\n\u201csupposed facts asserted\u201d. In both cases, the propositions\nof interest are prima facie rather than bona fide\ntruths. Although Rescher\u2019s 1973 book is entitled A Coherence\nTheory of Truth, the purpose of Rescher\u2019s investigation is not to\ninvestigate the possibility of defining truth in terms of\ncoherence but to find a truth criterion, which he understands\nto be a systematic procedure for selecting from a set of conflicting\nand even contradictory truth-candidates those elements which it is\nrational to accept as bona fide truths. His solution amounts\nto first identifying the maximal consistent subsets of the original\nset, i.e., the subsets that are consistent but would become\ninconsistent if extended by further elements of the original set, and\nthen choosing the most \u201cplausible\u201d among these subsets.\nPlausibility is characterized in way that reveals no obvious relation\nto the traditional concept of coherence. While the traditional concept\nof coherence plays a role in the philosophical underpinning of\nRescher\u2019s theory, it does not figure essentially in the final product.\nIn a later book, Rescher develops a more traditional\n\u201csystem-theoretic\u201d view on coherence (Rescher 1979).\n\nKeith Lehrer employs the concept of coherence in his definition of\njustification, which in turn is a chief ingredient in his complex\ndefinition of knowledge. According to Lehrer, a person is justified in\naccepting a proposition just in case that proposition coheres with the\nrelevant part of her cognitive system. This is the relational concept\nof coherence alluded to earlier. In Lehrer (1990), the relevant part\nis the \u201cacceptance system\u201d of the person, consisting of\npropositions to the effect that the subject accepts this and that.\nThus, \u201c\\(S\\) accepts that \\(A\\)\u201d would initially be\nin \\(S\\)\u2019s acceptance system, but not \\(A\\) itself. In later\nworks, Lehrer has emphasized the importance of coherence with a more\ncomplex cognitive entity which he calls the \u201cevaluation\nsystem\u201d (e.g., Lehrer 2000 and 2003).\n\nThe starting point of Lehrer\u2019s account of coherence is the fact that\nwe can think of all sorts of objections an imaginative critic may\nraise to what a person accepts. These objections might be directly\nincompatible with what that person accepts or they might threaten to\nundermine her reliability in making assessments of the kind in\nquestion. For instance, a critic might object to her claim that she\nsees a tree by suggesting that she is merely hallucinating. That would\nbe an example of the first sort of objection. An example of the second\nsort would be a case in which the critic replies that the person\ncannot tell whether she is hallucinating or not. Coherence, and\n(personal) justification, results when all objections have been\nmet.\n\nLehrer\u2019s concept of coherence does not seem to have much in common\nwith the traditional concept of mutual support. If one takes it as\nessential that such a theory make use of a concept of systematic or\nglobal coherence, then Lehrer\u2019s theory is not a coherence theory in\nthe traditional sense because, in Lehrer\u2019s view, \u201c[c]oherence\n\u2026 is not a global feature of the system\u201d (1997, 31), nor\ndoes it depend on global features of the system (31). A critic may\nwonder what reasons there are for calling the relation of meeting\nobjections to a given claim relative to an evaluation system a\nrelation of coherence. Lehrer\u2019s answer seems to be that it is\na relation of \u201cfitting together with\u201d, rather than, say, a\nrelation of \u201cbeing inferable from\u201d: \u201c[i]f it is more\nreasonable for me to accept one of [several] conflicting claims than\nthe other on the basis of my acceptance system, then that claim fits\nbetter or coheres better with my acceptance system\u201d (116), and\nso \u201c[a] belief may be completely justified for a person because\nof some relation of the belief to a system to which it belongs, the\nway it coheres with the system, just as a nose may be beautiful\nbecause of some relation of the nose to a face, the way it fits with\nthe face\u201d (88). Olsson (1999) has objected to this view by\npointing out that it is difficult to understand what it means for a\nbelief to fit into a system unless the former does so in virtue of\nadding to the global coherence of the latter.\n\nPaul Thagard\u2019s theory is clearly influenced by the traditional concept\nof coherence but the specific way in which the theory is developed\ngives it a somewhat non-traditional flavor, in particular considering\nits strong emphasis on explanatory relations between beliefs. Like\nRescher, Thagard takes the fundamental problem to be which elements of\na given set of typically conflicting claims that have the status of\nprima facie truths to single out as acceptable. However,\nwhere Rescher proposes to base the choice of acceptable truths on\nconsiderations of plausibility, Thagard suggests the use of\nexplanatory coherence for that purpose.\n\nAccording to Thagard, prima facie truths can cohere (fit\ntogether) or \u201cincohere\u201d (resist fitting together). The\nfirst type of relation includes relations of explanation and\ndeduction, whereas the second type includes various types of\nincompatibility, such as logical inconsistency. If two propositions\ncohere, this gives rise to a positive constraint. If they incohere,\nthe result is a negative constraint. A positive constraint between two\npropositions can be satisfied either by accepting both or by rejecting\nboth. By contrast, satisfying a negative constraint means accepting\none proposition while rejecting the other. A \u201ccoherence\nproblem\u201d, as Thagard sees it, is one of dividing the initial set\nof propositions into those that are accepted and those that are\nrejected in such a way that most constraints are satisfied. Thagard\npresents several different computational models for solving coherence\nproblems, including a model based on neural networks.\n\nHow acceptability depends on coherence, more precisely, is codified in\nThagard\u2019s \u201cprinciples of explanatory coherence\u201d (Thagard,\n2000):\n\nPrinciple E1 (Symmetry)\nExplanatory coherence is a symmetric relation. That is, two\npropositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) cohere with each other\nequally.\nPrinciple E2 (Explanation)\n\n\nA hypothesis coheres with what it explains, which can either be\nevidence or another hypothesis.\nHypotheses that together explain some other proposition cohere\nwith each other.\nThe more hypotheses it takes to explain something, the lower the\ndegree of coherence.\n \nPrinciple E3 (Analogy)\nSimilar hypotheses that explain similar pieces of evidence\ncohere.\nPrinciple E4 (Data Priority)\nPropositions that describe the results of observation have a\ndegree of acceptability on their own.\nPrinciple E5 (Contradiction)\nContradictory propositions are incoherent with each other.\nPrinciple E6 (Competition)\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both explain a proposition, and if\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not explanatorily connected, then \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are incoherent with each other \\((A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nexplanatorily connected if one explains the other or if together they\nexplain something).\nPrinciple E7 (Acceptance)\nThe acceptability of a proposition in a system of propositions\ndepends on its coherence with them.\n\n\nPrinciple E4 (Data Priority) reveals that Thagard\u2019s theory is not a\npure coherence theory, as it gives some epistemic priority to\nobservational beliefs, making it rather a form of weak\nfoundationalism, i.e., the view that some propositions have some\ninitial epistemic support apart from coherence. Moreover, Thagard\u2019s\ntheory is based on binary coherence/incoherence relations, i.e.,\nrelations holding between two propositions. His basic theory does not\nhandle incompatibilities that involve, in an essential way, more than\ntwo propositions. But incompatibilities of that sort may very well\narise, as exemplified by the three propositions \u201cJane is taller\nthan Martha\u201d, \u201cMartha is taller than Karen\u201d and\n\u201cKaren is taller than Jane\u201d. Nevertheless, Thagard reports\nthe existence of computational methods for converting constraint\nsatisfaction problems whose constraints involve more than two elements\ninto problems that involve only binary constraints, concluding that\nhis characterization of coherence \u201csuffices in principle for\ndealing with more complex coherence problems with nonbinary\nconstraints\u201d (Thagard 2000, 19). Thagard (2009) argues that\nthere is a connection between explanatory coherence and (approximate)\ntruth, where explaining consists in describing causal mechanisms.\nSeveral other authors have advocated coherence theories that emphasize\nthe importance of explanatory relations. See, for example, Lycan\n(1988, 2012) and, for a book-length defense of explanatory\ncoherentism, Poston (2014). Also related to Thagard\u2019s work is Susan Haack\u2019s so-called foundherentist theory, which draws on a proposed analogy between coherence justification (with foundationalist ingredients) and crossword puzzle-solving (Haack, 2009).\n",
