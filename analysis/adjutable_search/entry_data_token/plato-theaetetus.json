Introduction\n\n\nThe Theaetetus, which probably dates from about 369 BC, is\narguably Plato\u2019s greatest work on epistemology. (Arguably, it is his\ngreatest work on anything.) Plato (c.427\u2013347 BC) has much to say about\nthe nature of knowledge elsewhere. But only the Theaetetus\noffers a set-piece discussion of the question \u201cWhat is\nknowledge?\u201d\n\n\nLike many other Platonic dialogues, the Theaetetus is\ndominated by question-and-answer exchanges, with Socrates as main\nquestioner. His two respondents are Theaetetus, a brilliant young\nmathematician, and Theaetetus\u2019 tutor Theodorus, who is rather less\nyoung (and rather less brilliant).\n\n\nAlso like other Platonic dialogues, the main discussion of the\nTheaetetus is set within a framing conversation (142a\u2013143c)\nbetween Eucleides and Terpsion (cp. Phaedo 59c). This frame\nmay be meant as a dedication of the work to the memory of the\nman Theaetetus. Sedley 2004 (6\u20138) has argued that it is meant to set\nsome distance between Plato\u2019s authorial voice and the various other\nvoices (including Socrates\u2019) that are heard in the dialogue.\nAlternatively, or also, it may be intended, like Symposium\n172\u20133, to prompt questions about the reliability of knowledge based on\ntestimony. (Cp. the law-court passage (Theaetetus 201a\u2013c),\nand Socrates\u2019 dream (Theaetetus 201c\u2013202c).)\n\n\nThe Theaetetus\u2019 most important similarity to other\nPlatonic dialogues is that it is aporetic\u2014it is a\ndialogue that ends in an impasse. The Theaetetus\nreviews three definitions of knowledge in turn; plus, in a preliminary\ndiscussion, one would-be definition which, it is said, does not really\ncount. Each of these proposals is rejected, and no alternative is\nexplicitly offered. Thus we complete the dialogue without discovering\nwhat knowledge is. We discover only three things that knowledge is\nnot (Theaetetus 210c; cp. 183a5,\n187a1).\n\n\nThis matters, given the place that the Theaetetus is normally\nassigned in the chronology of Plato\u2019s writings. Most scholars agree\nthat Plato\u2019s first writings were the \u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues\n(as they are often called), which ask questions of the \u201cWhat\nis\u2026?\u201d form and typically fail to find answers:\n\u201cWhat is courage?\u201d (Laches), \u201cWhat is\nself-control?\u201d (Charmides), \u201cWhat is\njustice?\u201d (Alcibiades I; Republic 1),\n\u201cWhat is holiness?\u201d (Euthyphro), \u201cWhat is\nfriendship?\u201d (Lysis), \u201cWhat is virtue?\u201d\n(Meno), \u201cWhat is nobility?\u201d (Hippias\nMajor).  After some transitional works (Protagoras, Gorgias,\nCratylus, Euthydemus) comes a series of dialogues in which Plato\nwrites to a less tightly-defined format, not always focusing on a\n\u201cWhat is\u2026?\u201d question, nor using the\nquestion-and-answer interrogative method that he himself depicts as\nstrictly Socratic: the Phaedo, the Phaedrus, the\nSymposium, and the Republic. In these dialogues\nPlato shows a much greater willingness to put positive and ambitious\nmetaphysical views in Socrates\u2019 mouth, and to make Socrates the\nspokesman for what we call \u201cPlato\u2019s theory of Forms.\u201d\n\n\nAfter these, it is normally supposed that Plato\u2019s next two works were\nthe Parmenides and the Theaetetus, probably in that\norder. If so, and if we take as seriously as Plato seems to the\nimportant criticisms of the theory of Forms that are made in the\nParmenides, then the significance of the\nTheaetetus\u2019s return to the aporetic method looks obvious.\nApparently Plato has abandoned the certainties of his middle-period\nworks, such as the theory of Forms, and returned to the\nalmost-sceptical manner of the early dialogues. In the\nTheaetetus, the Forms that so dominated the\nRepublic\u2019s discussions of epistemology are hardly mentioned\nat all. A good understanding of the dialogue must make sense of this\nfact.\n2. Summary of the Dialogue\n\n\nAt the gates of the city of Megara in 369 BC, Eucleides and Terpsion\nhear a slave read out Eucleides\u2019 memoir of a philosophical discussion\nthat took place in 399 BC, shortly before Socrates\u2019 trial and\nexecution (142a\u2013143c). In this, the young Theaetetus is introduced to\nSocrates by his mathematics tutor, Theodorus. Socrates questions\nTheaetetus about the nature of expertise, and this leads him to pose\nthe key question of the dialogue: \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d\n(143d\u2013145e). Theaetetus\u2019 first response (D0) is to\ngive examples of knowledge such as geometry, astronomy, harmony,\narithmetic (146a\u2013c). Socrates objects that, for any x,\nexamples of x are neither necessary nor sufficient for a\ndefinition of x (146d\u2013147e). Theaetetus admits this, and\ncontrasts the ease with which he and his classmates define\nmathematical terms with his inability to define knowledge\n(147c\u2013148e). Socrates offers to explain Theaetetus\u2019 bewilderment about\nthe question \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d by comparing himself\nwith a midwife: Theaetetus, he suggests, is in discomfort because he\nis in intellectual labour (148e\u2013151d).\n\n\nThus prompted, Theaetetus states his first acceptable definition,\nwhich is the proposal (D1) that \u201cKnowledge is\nperception\u201d (151d\u2013e). Socrates does not respond to this\ndirectly. Instead he claims that D1 entails two other\ntheories (Protagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019), which he expounds (151e\u2013160e)\nand then criticises (160e\u2013183c). Socrates eventually presents no fewer\nthan eleven arguments, not all of which seem seriously intended,\nagainst the Protagorean and Heracleitean views. If any of these\narguments hit its target, then by modus tollens\nD1 is also false. A more direct argument against\nD1 is eventually given at 184\u20137.\n\n\nIn 187b4\u20138, Theaetetus proposes a second definition of knowledge:\n(D2) \u201cKnowledge is true belief.\u201d\nD2 provokes Socrates to ask: how can there be any\nsuch thing as false belief? There follows a five-phase\ndiscussion which attempts to come up with an account of false\nbelief. All five of these attempts fail, and that appears to be the\nend of the topic of false belief. Finally, at 200d\u2013201c, Socrates\nreturns to D2 itself. He dismisses\nD2 just by arguing that accidental true beliefs\ncannot be called knowledge, giving Athenian jurymen as an\nexample of accidental true belief.\n\n\nTheaetetus tries a third time. His final proposal\n(D3) defines knowledge as \u201ctrue belief\nwith an account (logos)\u201d (201c\u2013d). The ensuing\ndiscussion attempts to spell out what it might be like for\nD3 to be true, then makes three attempts to spell out\nwhat a logos is.\n\n\nIn 201d\u2013202d, the famous passage known as The Dream of\nSocrates, a two-part ontology of elements and complexes is\nproposed. Parallel to this ontology runs a theory of explanation that\nclaims that to explain, to offer a logos, is to analyse\ncomplexes into their elements, i.e., those parts which cannot be\nfurther analysed. Crucially, the Dream Theory says that knowledge of\nO is true belief about O plus an account of\nO\u2019s composition. If O is not composite, O\ncannot be known, but only \u201cperceived\u201d (202b6). When\nSocrates argues against the Dream Theory (202d8\u2013206b11), it is this\nentailment that he focuses on.\n\n\nSocrates then turns to consider, and reject, three attempts to spell\nout what a logos is\u2014to give an account of\n\u201caccount.\u201d  The first attempt takes logos just to\nmean \u201cspeech\u201d or \u201cstatement\u201d (206c\u2013e). The\nsecond account (206e4\u2013208b12) of \u201clogos of\nO\u201d takes it as \u201cenumeration of the elements of\nO.\u201d The third and last proposal (208c1\u2013210a9) is that\nto give the logos of O is to cite the\ns\u00eameion or diaphora of O, the\n\u201csign\u201d or diagnostic feature wherein O differs\nfrom everything else.\n\n\nAll three attempts to give an account of \u201caccount\u201d\nfail. The day\u2019s discussion, and the dialogue, end in aporia.\nSocrates leaves to face his enemies in the courtroom.\n3. Overall Interpretations of the Theaetetus\n\n\nThe Theaetetus is a principal field of battle for one of the\nmain disputes between Plato\u2019s interpreters. This is the dispute\nbetween Unitarians and Revisionists.\n\n\nUnitarians argue that Plato\u2019s works display a unity of doctrine and a\ncontinuity of purpose throughout. Unitarians include Aristotle,\nProclus, and all the ancient and mediaeval commentators; Bishop\nBerkeley; and in the modern era, Schleiermacher, Ast, Shorey,\nDi\u00e8s, Ross, Cornford, and Cherniss.\n\n\nRevisionists retort that Plato\u2019s works are full of revisions,\nretractations, and changes of direction. Eminent Revisionists include\nLutoslawski, Ryle, Robinson, Runciman, Owen, McDowell, Bostock, and\nmany recent commentators.\n\n\nUnitarianism is historically the dominant interpretive tradition.\nRevisionism, it appears, was not invented until the text-critical\nmethods, such as stylometry, that were developed in early\nnineteenth-century German biblical studies were transferred to\nPlato.\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, a different brand of Revisionism has\ndominated English-speaking Platonic studies. This owes its impetus to a\ndesire to read Plato as charitably as possible, and a belief that a\ncharitable reading of Plato\u2019s works will minimise their dependence on\nthe theory of Forms. (Corollary: Unitarians are likelier than\nRevisionists to be sympathetic to the theory of Forms.)\n\n\nUnitarianism could be the thesis that all of Plato\u2019s work is,\nreally, Socratic in method and inspiration, and that Plato should be\ncredited with no view that is not endorsed in the early dialogues.\n(In some recent writers, Unitarianism is this thesis: see\nPenner and Rowe (2005).) But this is not the most usual form of\nUnitarianism, which is more likely to \u201cread back\u201d the\nconcerns of the Phaedo and the Republic into the\nSocratic dialogues, than to \u201cread forward\u201d the studied\nagnosticism of the early works into these more ambitious later\ndialogues. Likewise, Revisionism could be evidenced by the\nobvious changes of outlook that occur, e.g., between the\nCharmides and the Phaedo, or again between the\nProtagoras and the Gorgias. But the main focus of\nthe Revisionist/Unitarian debate has never been on these\ndialogues. The contrasts between the Charmides and the\nPhaedo, and the Protagoras and the Gorgias,\ntell us little about the question whether Plato ever abandoned the\ntheory of Forms. And that has usually been the key dispute between\nRevisionists and Unitarians.\n\n\nHence the debate has typically focused on the contrast between the\n\u201cthe Middle Period dialogues\u201d and \u201cthe Late\ndialogues.\u201d  Revisionists say that the Middle Period dialogues\nenounce positive doctrines, above all the theory of Forms, which the\nLate dialogues criticise, reject, or simply bypass. The main place\nwhere Revisionists (e.g., Ryle 1939) suppose that Plato criticises the\ntheory of Forms is in the Parmenides (though some\nRevisionists find criticism of the theory of Forms in the\nTheaetetus and Sophist as well). The main places\nwhere Revisionists look to see Plato managing without the theory of\nForms are the Theaetetus and Sophist.\n\n\nRyle\u2019s Revisionism was soon supported by other Oxford Plato scholars\nsuch as Robinson 1950 and Runciman 1962 (28). Revisionism was also\ndefended by G.E.L. Owen. More recently, McDowell 1976, Bostock 1988,\nand Burnyeat 1990 are three classic books on the Theaetetus\nof a decidedly Revisionist tendency.  (McDowell shows a\nparticularly marked reluctance to bring in the theory of Forms\nanywhere where he is not absolutely compelled to.)\n\n\nRevisionists are committed by their overall stance to a number of more\nparticular views. They are more or less bound to say that the\nlate Plato takes the Parmenides\u2019 critique of the theory of\nForms to be cogent, or at least impressive; that the\nSophist\u2019s theory of \u201cthe five greatest\nkinds\u201d (Sophist 254b\u2013258e) is not a development of the\ntheory of Forms; and that the Timaeus was written before the\nParmenides, because of the Timaeus\u2019 apparent defence\nof theses from the theory of Forms. Their line on the\nTheaetetus will be that its argument does not support the\ntheory of Forms; that the Theaetetus is interesting precisely\nbecause it shows us how good at epistemology Plato is once he\nfrees himself from his obsession with the Forms.\n\n\nSome of these Revisionist claims look easier for Unitarians to dispute\nthan others. For example, Plato does not think that the arguments of\nParmenides 130b\u2013135c actually disprove the theory of\nForms. Rather, it is obviously Plato\u2019s view that Parmenides\u2019 arguments\nagainst the Forms can be refuted. See Parmenides 135a\u2013d,\nwhere Plato explicitly says\u2014using Parmenides as his\nmouthpiece\u2014that these arguments will be refuted by\nanyone of adequate philosophical training. (Whether anyone \u201cof\nadequate philosophical training\u201d is available is, of course,\nanother question.)\n\n\nAnother problem for the Revisionist concerns Owen 1965\u2019s proposal,\nadopted by Bostock 1988, to redate the Timaeus to the Middle\nPeriod, thus escaping the conclusion that Plato still accepted the\ntheory of Forms at the end of his philosophical career. The trouble\nwith this is that it is not only the Timaeus that the\nRevisionist needs to redate. In quite a number of apparently Late\ndialogues, Plato seems sympathetic to the theory of Forms: see e.g.,\nPhilebus 61e and Laws 965c.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Revisionist claim that the Theaetetus\nshows Plato doing more or less completely without the theory of Forms\nis very plausible. There are no explicit mentions of the Forms at all\nin the Theaetetus, except possibly (and even this much is\ndisputed) in what many take to be the philosophical backwater of the\nDigression. The main argument of the dialogue seems to get along\nwithout even implicit appeal to the theory of Forms. In the\nTheaetetus, Revisionism seems to be on its strongest ground\nof all.\n\n\nThe usual Unitarian answer is that this silence is studied. In the\nTheaetetus, Unitarians suggest, Plato is showing what\nknowledge is not. His argument is designed to show that\ncertain sorts of alternatives to Plato\u2019s own account of knowledge must\nfail. Plato demonstrates this failure by the \u2018maieutic\u2019\nmethod of developing those accounts until they fail. Thus the\nTheaetetus shows the impossibility of a successful account of\nknowledge that does not invoke the Forms. \n\n\nThe fault-line between Unitarians and Revisionists is the deepest\nfissure separating interpreters of the Theaetetus. It is not\nthe only distinction among overall interpretations of the dialogue. It\nhas also been suggested, both in the ancient and the modern eras, that\nthe Theaetetus is a sceptical work; that the\nTheaetetus is a genuinely aporetic work; and that the\nTheaetetus is a disjointed work. However, there is no space\nto review these possibilities here. It is time to look more closely at\nthe detail of the arguments that Plato gives in the distinct sections\nof the dialogue.\n4. The Introduction to the Dialogue: 142a\u2013145e\n\n\nWe should not miss the three philosophical theses that are explicitly\nadvanced in the Introduction. They are offered without argument by\nSocrates, and agreed to without argument by Theaetetus, at\n145d7\u2013145e5: \n\nThe wise are wise sophiai (=  by/ because of/ in\nrespect of/ as a result of wisdom:145d11).\nTo learn is to become wiser about the topic you are learning\nabout (145d8\u20139).\nWisdom (sophia) and knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) are the same thing (145e5).\n\n\n\nAll three theses might seem contentious today. (1) seems to allude to\nPhaedo 100e\u2019s notorious thesis about the role of the Form of\nF-ness in any x\u2019s being F\u2014that\nx is F \u201cby the Form of\nF-ness.\u201d (2) looks contentious because it implies (3);\nand (3) brings me to a second question about 142a\u2013145e (which is also\nan important question about the whole dialogue): What is the meaning\nof the Greek word that I am translating as \u201cknowledge,\u201d\nepist\u00eam\u00ea?\n\n\nMuch has been written about Plato\u2019s words for knowledge. One important\nquestion raised by Runciman 1962 is the question whether Plato was\naware of the commonplace modern distinction between knowing that,\nknowing how, and knowing what (or whom). Nothing is more natural for\nmodern philosophers than to contrast knowledge of\nobjects (knowledge by acquaintance or objectual knowledge;\nFrench conna\u00eetre) with knowledge of how to do\nthings (technique knowledge), and with knowledge of\npropositions or facts (propositional knowledge; French\nsavoir). Runciman doubts that Plato is aware of this\nthreefold distinction (1962, 17): \u201cAt the time of writing the\nTheaetetus Plato had made no clear distinction [between]\nknowing that, knowing how, and knowing by acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\nAgainst this, Plato\u2019s word for knowing how is surely\ntekhn\u00ea, from which we get the English word\n\u201ctechnique.\u201d Plato obviously thinks tekhn\u00ea\nincidental to a serious discussion of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\nThis is part of the point of the argument against definition by\nexamples that begins at 146d (cp. 177c\u2013179b).\n\n\nAs for the difference between knowing that and knowledge by\nacquaintance: the Theaetetus does mix passages that discuss\nthe one sort of knowledge with passages that discuss the other. This\ndoes not imply that Plato was unaware of the difference. Perhaps he\nwants to discuss theories of knowledge that find deep conceptual\nconnections between the two sorts of knowledge.\n\n\nA grammatical point is relevant here. The objectual \u201cI know\nSocrates\u201d in classical Greek is oida (or\ngign\u00f4sk\u00f4) ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean; the\npropositional \u201cI know Socrates is wise\u201d is oida\n(or gign\u00f4sk\u00f4) ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean sophon\nonta, literally \u201cI know Socrates being wise\u201d or,\ncolloquially, just oida ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean sophon,\nliterally \u201cI know Socrates wise\u201d. Thus the Greek\nidiom can readily treat the object of propositional knowledge, which\nin English would most naturally be a that-clause, as a thing\nconsidered as having a quality. We might almost say that Greek\ntreats what is known in propositional knowledge as just one special\ncase of what is known in objectual knowledge. This suggests that the\nancient Greeks naturally saw propositional and objectual knowledge as\nmore closely related than we do (though not necessarily as\nindistinguishable). If so, Plato may have felt able to offer a single\ntreatment for the two kinds of knowledge without thereby confusing\nthem. The point will be relevant to the whole of the\nTheaetetus.\n5. Definition by Examples: 146a\u2013151d\n\n\nAt 145d Socrates states the \u201cone little question that\npuzzles\u201d him: \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d Theaetetus\u2019 first\nresponse (D0) is to offer examples of knowledge\n(146c).  Socrates rejects this response, arguing that, for any\nx, examples of x are neither necessary nor\nsufficient for a definition of x. They are not necessary,\nbecause they are irrelevant (146e). They are not sufficient, because\nthey presuppose the understanding that a definition is meant to\nprovide (147a\u2013b). Moreover (147c), a definition could be briefly\nstated, whereas talking about examples is \u201can interminable\ndiversion\u201d (aperanton hodon).\n\n\nDoes Socrates produce good arguments against definition by examples?\nMany philosophers think not (McDowell 1976 (115), Geach 1966, Santas\n1972, Burnyeat 1977). They often argue this by appealing to the\nauthority of Wittgenstein, who famously complains (The Blue and\nBrown Books, 20) that \u201cWhen Socrates asks the question,\n\u2018What is knowledge?\u2019, he does not regard it even as a\npreliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge.\u201d\nFor arguments against this modern consensus, see Chappell 2005\n(36\u201337).\n\n\nSome commentators have taken Socrates\u2019 critique of definition by\nexamples to be an implicit critique of the Republic\u2019s\nprocedure of distinguishing knowledge, belief, and ignorance by\ndistinguishing their objects. The suggestion was first made by Ryle\n1990 (23), who points out that \u201cSocrates makes it clear that\nwhat he wants discussed is not a list of things that people\nknow,\u201d \u201cbut an elucidation of the concept of\nknowledge.\u201d Ryle suggests that \u201cAttention to this simple\npoint might have saved Cornford from saying that the implicit\nconclusion of the dialogue is that \u2018true knowledge has for its\nobjects things of a different order\u2019.\u201d Ryle thinks it\n\u201csilly\u201d to suggest that knowledge can be defined merely by\nspecifying its objects.\n\n\nHowever, 145e\u2013147c cannot be read as a critique of the\nRepublic\u2019s procedure of distinguishing knowledge from belief\nby their objects. 145e\u2013147c is not against defining knowledge by\nexamples of objects of knowledge; it is against\ndefining knowledge by examples of kinds of\nknowledge.  (See e.g., 146e7, \u201cWe weren\u2019t wanting to\nmake a list of kinds of knowledge.\u201d) This is a different\nmatter.\n\n\nWhy, anyway, would the Platonist of the Republic think that\nexamples of the objects of knowledge are enough for a definition of\nknowledge? He is surely the last person to think that. The person who\nwill think this is the empiricist, who thinks that we acquire\nall our concepts by exposure to examples of their application: Locke,\nEssay II.1, Aristotle, Posterior Analytics 100a4\u20139.\nFor the Platonist, definition by examples is never even possible; for\nthe empiricist, definition by examples is the natural method in every\ncase. This suggests that empiricism is a principal target of the\nargument of the Theaetetus. More about this in sections\n6\u20138.\n\n\nTheaetetus is puzzled by his own inability to answer Socrates\u2019 request\nfor a definition of knowledge, and contrasts it with the ease with\nwhich he can provide mathematical definitions. He gives an example of\na mathematical definition; scholars are divided about the aptness of\nthe parallel between this, and what would be needed for a definition\nof knowledge. Socrates\u2019 response, when Theaetetus still protests his\ninability to define knowledge, is to compare himself to a midwife in a\nlong and intricate analogy.\n\n\nMany ancient Platonists read the midwife analogy, and more recently\nCornford 1935 has read it, as alluding to the theory of recollection.\nBut it is better not to import metaphysical assumptions into the text\nwithout good reason, and it is hard to see what the reason would be\nbeyond a determination to insist that Plato always maintained the\ntheory of recollection.  With or without this speculation, the midwife\npassage does tell us something important about how\nthe Theaetetus is going to proceed. In line with the\nclassification that the ancient editors set at the front of the\ndialogue, it is going to be peirastikos,\nan experimental dialogue. It will try out a number of\nsuggestions about the nature of knowledge. As in the aporetic\ndialogues, there is no guarantee that any of these suggestions will be\nsuccessful (and every chance that none of them will be).\n\n\nSo read, the midwife passage can also tell us something important\nabout the limitations of the Theaetetus\u2019 inquiry. The\nlimitations of the inquiry are the limitations of the main inquirers,\nand neither (the historical) Socrates nor Theaetetus was a\ncard-carrying adherent of Plato\u2019s theory of Forms. Perhaps the\ndialogue brings us only as far as the threshold of the theory of Forms\nprecisely because, on Socratic principles, one can get no further. To\nget beyond where the Theaetetus leaves off, you have to be a\nPlatonist. (For book-length developments of this reading of the\nTheaetetus, see Sedley 2004 and Chappell 2005.)\n6. First Definition (D1): \u201cKnowledge is Perception\u201d: 151e\u2013187a\n\n\nBetween Stephanus pages 151 and 187, and leaving aside the Digression,\n172\u2013177 (section 6d), 31 pages of close and complex argument state,\ndiscuss, and eventually refute the first of Theaetetus\u2019 three serious\nattempts at a definition of knowledge (D1):\n\u201cKnowledge is perception.\u201d\n\n\nAs before, there are two main alternative readings of 151\u2013187: the\nUnitarian and the Revisionist. On the Unitarian reading, Plato\u2019s\npurpose is to salvage as much as possible of the theories of\nProtagoras and Heracleitus (each respectfully described as ou\nphaulon: 151e8, 152d2). Plato\u2019s strategy is to show that these\ntheories have their own distinctive area of application, the\nperceptible or sensible world, within which they are true. However,\nthe sensible world is not the whole world, and so these theories are\nnot the whole truth. We get absurdities if we try to take them as\nunrestrictedly true. To avoid these absurdities it is necessary to\nposit the intelligible world (the world of the Forms)\nalongside the sensible world (the world of perception). When\nthis is done, Platonism subsumes the theories of Protagoras and\nHeracleitus as partial truths. On this reading, the strategy of the\ndiscussion of D1 is to transcend Protagoras and\nHeracleitus: to explain their views by showing how they are, not the\ntruth, but parts of a larger truth. In the process the discussion\nreveals logical pressures that may push us towards the two-worlds\nPlatonism that many readers, e.g., Ross and Cornford, find in the\nRepublic and Timaeus.\n\n\nOn the Revisionist reading, Plato\u2019s purpose is to refute the theories\nof Protagoras and Heracleitus. He thinks that the absurdities those\ntheories give rise to, come not from trying to take the theories as\nunrestrictedly true, but from trying to take them as true\nat all, even of the sensible world. Anyone who tries to take\nseriously the thesis that knowledge is perception has to adopt\ntheories of knowledge and perception like Protagoras\u2019 and\nHeracleitus\u2019. But their theories are untenable. By modus\ntollens this shows that D1 itself is\nuntenable. On this reading, the strategy of the discussion of\nD1 is to move us towards the view that sensible\nphenomena have to fall under the same general metaphysical theory as\nintelligible phenomena.\n\n\nThis outline of the two main alternatives for 151\u2013187 shows how\nstrategic and tactical issues of Plato interpretation interlock. For\ninstance, the outline shows how important it is for an overall\nunderstanding of the Theaetetus to have a view on the\nfollowing questions of detail (more about them later): \n\nAt 156a\u2013157c, is Socrates just reporting, or also endorsing, a\nHeracleitean flux theory of perception?\nWhat is the date of the Timaeus, which seems (28\u201329, 45b\u201346c,\n49e) to present a very similar theory of perception to that found in\nTheaetetus 156\u20137?\nWhat does Plato take to be the logical relations between the three\npositions under discussion in 151\u2013184 (D1,\nProtagoras\u2019 theory, and Heracleitus\u2019 theory)? The closer he takes them\nto be, the more support that seems to give to the Revisionist view\nthat the whole of 151\u2013187 is one gigantic modus tollens. The\nmore separate they are, the better for those versions of Unitarianism\nthat suggest that Plato wants to pick and choose among the positions\noffered in 151\u2013187.\n\n\n     \nSo much for the overall structure of 151\u2013187; now for the parts.\n6.1 The Definition of Knowledge as Perception: 151d\u2013e\n\n\nAt 151d7\u2013e3 Theaetetus proposes D1: \u201cKnowledge\nis nothing other than perception\u201d\n(aisth\u00easis). This proposal is immediately equated by\nSocrates with Protagoras\u2019s thesis that \u201cman is the measure of\nall things\u201d (Hm for homomensura),\nwhich in turn entails the thesis that things are to any human just as\nthey appear to that human (PS for phenomenal\nsubjectivism). Socrates then adds that, in its turn,\nPS entails Heracleitus\u2019 view that \u201cAll is\nflux,\u201d that there are no stably existing objects with\nstably enduring qualities.\n\n\nThe first of these deft exchanges struck the Anonymous Commentator as\ndisingenuous: \u201cPlato himself knew that Protagoras\u2019 opinion about\nknowledge was not the same as Theaetetus\u2019\u201d (Anon, ad\nloc.). Certainly it is easy to see counter-examples to the\nalleged entailment. Take, for instance, the thesis that knowledge is\nawareness (which is often the right way to translate\naisth\u00easis). Or take the thesis that to know is to\nperceive things as God, or the Ideal Observer, perceives them, and\nthat we fail to know (or to perceive) just insofar as our opinions are\nother than God\u2019s or the Ideal Observer\u2019s. These theses are both\nversions of D1. Neither entails Hm,\nthe claim that \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d; nor the\nProtagoreanism that lies behind that slogan.\n\n\nSo how, if at all, does D1 entail all the things\nthat Socrates apparently makes it entail in 151\u2013184? And does Plato\nthink it has all these entailments? Evidently the answer to that\ndepends on how we understand D1. In particular, it\ndepends on the meaning of the word aisth\u00easis,\n\u201cperception,\u201d in D1. If the slogan\n\u201cKnowledge is perception\u201d equates knowledge with what ordinary\nspeakers of classical Greek would have meant by\naisth\u00easis, then D1 does not entail\nProtagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019 views. In the ordinary sense of\naisth\u00easis, there are (as just pointed out) too many\nother possible ways of spelling out D1 for the move\nfrom D1 to Hm to be logically\nobligatory. But if the slogan \u201cKnowledge is perception\u201d equates\nknowledge with what Protagoras and Heracleitus meant by\naisth\u00easis, D1 does entail\nProtagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019 views. Of course it does; for then\nD1 simply says that knowledge is just what Protagoras\nand Heracleitus say knowledge is.\n6.2 The \u201cCold Wind\u201d Argument; and the Theory of Flux: 152a\u2013160e\n\n\nAt 152b1\u2013152c8 Socrates begins his presentation of Protagoras\u2019 view\nthat things are to any human just as they appear to that human by\ntaking the example of a wind which affects two people\ndifferently. Such cases, he says, support Protagoras\u2019\nanalysis: \u201cthat the wind is cold to the one who feels\ncold, but not cold to the one who does not feel\ncold.\u201d\n\n\nSome scholars (Cornford 1935, 33\u20134; Waterlow 1977) think that the\npoint of the argument is that both \u201cthe wind in itself\nis cold\u201d and \u201cthe wind in itself is not cold (but\nwarm)\u201d are true: \u201c\u2018Warm\u2019 and\n\u2018cold\u2019 are two properties which can co-exist in the same\nphysical object. I perceive the one, you perceive the other.\u201d\nThe trouble with this suggestion is that much of the detail of the\nProtagorean/Heracleitean position in 151\u2013184 seems to be generated by\nProtagoras\u2019 desire to avoid contradiction. If Cornford thinks\nthat Protagoras is not concerned to avoid contradicting\nhimself, then he has a huge task of reinterpretation ahead of him.\n\n\nRather, perhaps, the point of the argument is this: Neither \u201cThe\nwind in itself is cold\u201d nor \u201cThe wind in itself is\nwarm\u201d is true. If we had grounds for affirming either, we would\nhave equally good grounds for affirming both; but the conjunction\n\u201cThe wind in itself is cold and the wind in itself is\nwarm\u201d is a contradiction. This contradiction, says Protagoras,\nobliges us to give up all talk about \u201cthe wind in itself,\u201d\nand switch to relativised talk about the wind as it seems to\nme or to you, etc.  (The same contradiction pushes the\nPlato of the Republic in the opposite direction: it leads him\nto place no further trust in any relativised talk, precisely\nbecause such talk cannot get us beyond such\ncontradictions.)\n\n\nSo we have moved from D1, to Hm, to\nPS. At 152c8\u2013152e1 Socrates adds\nthat, in its turn, PS entails Heracleitus\u2019 view that\n\u201cAll is flux,\u201d that there are no stably existing\nobjects with stably enduring qualities. The reason\ngiven for this is the same thought as the one at the centre of the\ncold-wind argument: that everything to which any predicate can be\napplied, according to one perception, can also have the negation of\nthat predicate applied to it, according to an opposite perception with\nequally good credentials.\n\n\nAfter a passage (152e1\u2013153d5) in which Socrates presents what seem to\nbe deliberately bad arguments, eight of them, for Heracleitus\u2019 flux\nthesis, Socrates notes three shocking theses which the flux theory\nimplies:\n\nQualities have no independent existence in time and space\n(153d6\u2013e1).\nQualities do not exist except in perceptions of them\n(153e3\u2013154a8).\n(The dice paradox:) changes in a thing\u2019s qualities are not so much\nchanges in that thing as in perceptions of that thing\n(154a9\u2013155c6).\n\n\n\nThese shocking implications, Socrates says, give the phenomenal\nsubjectivist his reason to reject the entire object/quality\nmetaphysics, and to replace it with a metaphysics of flux.\n\n\nIn 155c\u2013157c the flux theory is used to develop a\nProtagorean/Heracleitean account of perception, to replace accounts\nbased on the object/property ontology of common sense. Socrates notes\nthe subversive implications of the theory of flux for the\nmeaningfulness and truth-aptness of most of our language as it\nstands. (He returns to this point at 183a\u2013b.) The ontology of the flux\ntheory distinguishes kinds of \u201cprocess\u201d\n(kin\u00easis), i.e., of flux, in two ways: as fast or slow,\nand as active or passive. Hence there are four such processes. On\nthese the flux theory\u2019s account of perception rests.\n\n\nA rather similar theory of perception is given by Plato in\nTimaeus 45b\u201346c, 67c\u201368d. This fact has much exercised\nscholars, since it relates closely to the question whether Plato\nhimself accepts the flux theory of perception (cp. Theaetetus\n157c5). The question is important because it connects with the\nquestion of whether the Revisionist or Unitarian reading of 151\u2013187 is\nright.  (For more on this issue, see Cornford 1935 (49\u201350); Crombie\n1963, II (21\u201322); Burnyeat 1990 (17\u201318); McDowell 1973 (139\u2013140),\nChappell 2005 (74\u201378).)\n\n\nAt 157c\u2013160c Socrates states a first objection to the flux theory.\nThis asks how the flux theorist is to distinguish false (deceptive)\nappearances such as dreams from the true (undeceptive) appearances of\nthe waking world. The flux theorist\u2019s answer is that such appearances\nshould not be described as \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019\nappearances to the same person. Rather they should be described as\ndifferent appearances to different people. According to the flux\ntheorist, we have the same person if and only if we have the same\ncombination of a perception and a perceiving (159c\u2013d). So there is no\nneed to call any appearances false. Thus we preserve the\nclaim that all appearances are true\u2014a claim which must be true\nif knowledge is perception in the sense that Socrates has taken that\ndefinition.\n\n\n160b\u2013d summarises the whole of 151\u2013160. Socrates shows how the\nexploration of Theaetetus\u2019 identification of knowledge with perception\nhas led us to develop a whole battery of views: in particular, a\nProtagorean doctrine of the incorrigibility of perception, and a\nHeracleitean account of what perception is. Thus \u201cperception has\none of the two marks of knowledge, infallibility\u201d (Cornford\n1935, 58); \u201cand, if we can accept Protagoras\u2019 identification of\nwhat appears to me with what is, ignoring the addition \u2018for\nme\u2019 and the distinction between being and becoming, the case\nwill be complete.\u201d\n6.3 The Refutation of the Thesis that Knowledge is Perception: 160e5\u2013186e12\n\n\n160e marks the transition from the statement and exposition of the\ndefinition of knowledge as perception (D1), to the\ncriticism and eventual refutation of that definition.\n\n\nScholars have divided about the overall purpose of 160e\u2013186e. Mostly\nthey have divided along the lines described in section 3, taking\neither a Revisionist or a Unitarian view of Part One of the\nTheaetetus.\n\n\nRevisionists say that the target of the critique of 160e\u2013186e is\neverything that has been said in support and development of\nD1 ever since 151. Unitarians argue that Plato\u2019s\ncriticism of D1 in 160e\u2013186e is more selective.\nObviously his aim is to refute D1, the equation of\nknowledge with perception. But that does not oblige him to reject the\naccount of perception that has been offered in support of\nD1. And Plato does not reject this account: he\naccepts it.\n\n\nThus the Unitarian Cornford argues that Plato is not rejecting the\nHeracleitean flux theory of perception. He is rejecting only\nD1\u2019s claim that knowledge is that sort of\nperception. It remains possible that perception is just as Heracleitus\ndescribes it. Likewise, Cornford suggests, the Protagorean doctrine\nthat \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d is true provided\nit is taken to mean only \u201call things that we\nperceive.\u201d\n\n\nIf some form of Unitarianism is correct, an examination of 160\u2013186\nshould show that Plato\u2019s strategy in the critique of\nD1 highlights two distinctions:\n\nA distinction between the claim that the objects of\nperception are in flux, and the claim that everything is\nin flux.\nA distinction between bare sensory awareness, and judgement on\nthe basis of such awareness.\n\n\n\nOne vital passage for distinction (1) is 181b\u2013183b. If Unitarianism is\nright, this passage should be an attack on the Heracleitean thesis\nthat everything is in flux, but not an attack on the\nHeracleitean thesis that the objects of perception are in\nflux. According to Unitarians, the thesis that the objects of\nperception are in flux is a Platonic thesis too. Readers should ask\nthemselves whether this is the right way to read 181b \u2013183b.\n\n\nDistinction (2) seems to be explicitly stated at 179c. There also\nseems to be clear evidence of distinction (2) in the final argument\nagainst D1, at 184\u2013187. Distinction (2) is also at\nwork, apparently, in the discussion of some of the nine objections\naddressed to the Protagorean theory. Some of these objections can\nplausibly be read as points about the unattractive consequences of\nfailing to distinguish the Protagorean claim that bare sense-awareness\nis incorrigible (as the Unitarian Plato agrees) from the further\nProtagorean claim that judgements about sense-awareness are\nincorrigible (which the Unitarian Plato denies).\n\n\nThe criticism of D1 breaks down into twelve separate\narguments, interrupted by the Digression (172c\u2013177c: translated and\ndiscussed separately in section 6d). There is no space here to comment\nin detail on every one of these arguments, some of which, as noted\nabove, have often been thought frivolous or comically intended\n(cp. 152e1\u2013153d5). Some brief notes on the earlier objections will\nshow what the serious point of each might be.\n\n\nThe first objection to Protagoras (160e\u2013161d) observes that if all\nperceptions are true, then there is no reason to think that animal\nperceptions are inferior to human ones: a situation which Socrates\nfinds absurd.\n\n\nIf this objection is really concerned with perceptions strictly so\ncalled, then it obviously fails. Protagoras just accepts this\nsupposedly absurd consequence; and apparently he is right to do so. If\nwe consider animals and humans just as perceivers, there is no\nautomatic reason to prefer human perceptions. Many animal perceptions\nare superior to human perceptions (dogs\u2019 hearing, hawks\u2019\neyesight, dolphins\u2019 echolocatory ability, most mammals\u2019 sense of\nsmell, etc.), and the Greeks knew it, cf. Homer\u2019s commonplace remarks\nabout \u201cfar-sighted eagles\u201d, or indeed Aristotle, in the\nEudemian Ethics, 1231a5\u20136. The objection works much better\nrephrased as an objection about\njudgements about perceptions, rather than about\nperceptions strictly so called. Humans are no more and no\nless perceivers than pigs, baboons, or tadpoles. But they are\ndifferent in their powers of judgement about perceptions.  \n\n\nThis distinction between arguments against a Protagorean view about\nperception and a Protagorean view about judgement about perception is\nrelevant to the second objection too (161d\u2013162a). This objection (cp.\nCratylus 386c) makes the point that Protagoras\u2019 theory\nimplies that no one is wiser than anyone else. Notably, the argument\ndoes not attack the idea that perception is\ninfallible. Rather, it attacks the idea that the opinion or judgement\nthat anyone forms on the basis of perception is infallible\n(161d3). (This is an important piece of support for Unitarianism:\ncp. distinction (2) above.)\n\n\nA third objection to Protagoras\u2019 thesis is very quickly stated in\nSocrates\u2019 two rhetorical questions at 162c2\u20136. Since Protagoras\u2019\nthesis implies that all perceptions are true, it not only has the\nallegedly absurd consequence that animals\u2019 perceptions are not\ninferior to humans. It also has the consequence that humans\u2019\nperceptions are not inferior to the gods\u2019. This consequence too is now\nsaid to be absurd.\n\n\nAs with the first two objections, so here. If we consider divinities\nand humans just as perceivers, there is no automatic reason to prefer\ndivine perceptions, and hence no absurdity. Plato may well want us to\ninfer that the Greek gods are not different just in respect of being\nperceivers from humans. But they are different in\ntheir powers of judgement about perceptions.\n\n\nThe next four arguments (163a\u2013168c) present counter-examples to the\nalleged equivalence of knowledge and perception. The fourth observes\nthat, if perception = knowledge, then anyone who perceives an\nutterance in a given language should have knowledge of that utterance,\ni.e., understand it\u2014which plainly doesn\u2019t happen. The fifth\nraises a similar problem about memory and perception: remembering\nthings is knowing them, but not perceiving them. The\nsixth (the \u201ccovered eye\u201d) objection contrasts not\nperceiving an object (in one sensory modality) with not\nknowing it. If perception = knowledge, seeing an object with one\neye and not seeing it with the other would appear to be a case of the\ncontradictory state of both knowing it and not knowing it. The seventh\npoints out that one can perceive dimly or faintly, clearly or\nunclearly, but that these adverbial distinctions do not apply to ways\nof knowing\u2014as they must if knowing is perceiving.\n\n\nIn 165e4\u2013168c5, Socrates sketches Protagoras\u2019s response to these seven\nobjections. Protagoras makes two main points. First, he can meet some\nof the objections by distinguishing types and occasions of\nperception. Second, teaching as he understands it is not a matter of\ngetting the pupil to have true rather than false beliefs. Since there\nare no false beliefs, the change that a teacher can effect is not a\nchange from false belief to true belief or knowledge. Rather,\nProtagoras\u2019 model of teaching is a therapeutic model. What a\ngood teacher does, according to him, is use arguments (or discourses:\nlogoi) as a good doctor uses drugs, to replace the state of\nthe soul in which \u201cbad things are and appear\u201d with one in\nwhich \u201cgood things are and appear.\u201d While all\nbeliefs are true, not all beliefs are\nbeneficial.\n\n\nA difficulty for Protagoras\u2019 position here is that, if all beliefs are\ntrue, then all beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial must be\ntrue. But surely, some beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial\ncontradict other beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial;\nespecially if some people are better than others at bringing about\nbeneficial beliefs. (For example, no doubt Plato\u2019s and Protagoras\u2019\nbeliefs conflict at this point.) This means that Protagoras\u2019 view\nentails a contradiction of the same sort as the next\nobjection\u2013the famous peritrop\u00ea\u2014seems to be\nmeant to bring out.\n\n\nThe peritrop\u00ea (\u201ctable-turning\u201d) objection\n(171a\u2013b) is this. Suppose I believe, as Protagoras does, that\n\u201cAll beliefs are true,\u201d but also admit that \u201cThere\nis a belief that \u2018Not all beliefs are true\u2019.\u201d If all\nbeliefs are true, the belief that \u201cNot all beliefs are\ntrue\u201d must be true too. But if that belief is true, then by\ndisquotation, not all beliefs are true.  So I refute myself by\ncontradicting myself; and the same holds for Protagoras.\n\n\nThe validity of the objection has been much\ndisputed. Burnyeat, Denyer and Sedley all offer reconstructions of the\nobjection that make it come out valid. McDowell and Bostock suggest\nthat although the objection does not prove what it is meant to prove\n(self-contradiction), it does prove a different point (about\nself-defeat) which is equally worth making. \n\n\nSocrates\u2019 ninth objection presents Protagoras\u2019 theory with a\ndilemma. If the theory is completely general in its application, then\nit must say that not only what counts as justice in cities,\nbut also what benefits cities, is a relative matter. As\nProtagoras has already admitted (167a3), it is implausible to say that\nbenefit is a relative notion. But the alternative, which Protagoras\napparently prefers, is a conceptual divorce between the notions of\njustice and benefit, which restrict the application of Protagoras\u2019\ntheory to the notion of justice. Socrates obviously finds this\nconceptual divorce unattractive, though he does not, directly, say\nwhy. Instead, he offers us the Digression.\n6.4 The Digression: 172c1\u2013177b7\n\n\nAn obvious question: what is the Digression for? One answer (defended\nin Chappell 2004, ad loc.) would be that it is a critique of the\nsociety that produces the conceptual divorce between justice and\nbenefit that has just emerged.  Socrates draws an extended parallel\nbetween two types of character, the philosophical man and the man of\nrhetoric, to show that it is better to be the philosophical type.\n\n\nThe Digression is \u201cphilosophically quite pointless,\u201d\naccording to Ryle 1966: 158. Less dismissively, McDowell 1976: 174\nsuggests that the Digression serves \u201ca purpose which, in a\nmodern book, might be served by footnotes or an appendix.\u201d\nSimilarly, Cornford 1935 (83) suggests that Plato aims to give the\nreader some references for anti-relativist arguments that he presents\nelsewhere: \u201cTo argue explicitly against it would perhaps take\nhim too far from the original topic of perception. Instead, he inserts\n[the Digression], which contains allusions to such arguments in other\nworks of his.\u201d\n\n\nPerhaps the Digression paints a picture of what it is like to\nlive in accordance with the two different accounts of\nknowledge, the Protagorean and the Platonist, that Plato is\ncomparing. Thus the Digression shows us what is ethically at stake in\nthe often abstruse debates found elsewhere in the Theaetetus.\nIts point is that we can\u2019t make a decision about what account of\nknowledge to accept without making all sorts of other decisions, not\nonly about the technical, logical and metaphysical matters that are to\nthe fore in the rest of the Theaetetus, but also about\nquestions of deep ethical significance. So, for instance, it can\nhardly be an accident that, at 176c2, the difference between justice\nand injustice is said to be a difference between knowledge\n(gn\u00f4sis) and ignorance (agnoia).\n\n\nAnother common question about the Digression is: does it introduce or\nmention the Platonic Forms? Certainly the Digression uses phrases that\nare indisputably part of the Middle-Period language for the Forms.  If\nPlato uses the language of the theory of Forms in a passage which is\nadmitted on all sides to allude to the themes of the\nRepublic, it strains credulity to imagine that Plato is not\nintentionally referring to the Forms in that passage.\n\n\nOn the other hand, as the Revisionist will point out, the\nTheaetetus does not seem to do much with the Forms\nthat are thus allegedly introduced. But perhaps it would undermine the\nUnitarian reading of the Theaetetus if the Forms\nwere present in the Digression in the role of paradigm\nobjects of knowledge.  For the Unitarian reading, at least on the\nversion that strikes me as most plausible, says that the aim of\nthe Theaetetus is to show that, in the end, we cannot\nconstruct a theory of knowledge without the Forms\u2014a claim which is to\nbe proved by trying and failing, three times, to do so. So if the\nForms were there in the Digression, perhaps that would be a case of\n\u201cgiving the game away.\u201d\n6.5 Last Objection to Protagoras: 177c6\u2013179b5\n\n\nAfter the Digression Socrates returns to criticising Protagoras\u2019\nrelativism. His last objection is that there is no coherent way of\napplying Protagoras\u2019 relativism to judgements about the future.\n\n\nHow might Protagoras counter this objection? Protagoras has already\nsuggested that the past may now be no more than whatever I now\nremember it to have been (166b). Perhaps he can also suggest that the\nfuture is now no more than I now believe it will be. No prediction is\never proved wrong, just as no memory is ever inaccurate. All that\nhappens is it seems to one self at one time that something will\nbe true (or has been true), and seems to another self at\nanother time that something different is true.\n\n\nBut these appeals to distinctions between Protagorean\nselves\u2014future or past\u2014do not help. Suppose we grant to\nProtagoras that, when I make a claim about how the future will be,\nthis claim concerns how things will be for my future self. It\nis just irrelevant to add that my future self and I are different\nbeings. Claims about the future still have a form that makes them\nrefutable by someone\u2019s future experience. If I predict on\nMonday that on Tuesday my head will hurt, that claim is falsified\neither if I have no headache on Tuesday, or if, on Tuesday, there is\nsomeone who is by convention picked out as my continuant whose head\ndoes not hurt.\n\n     \nSimilarly with the past. Suppose I know on Tuesday that on Monday I\npredicted that on Tuesday my head would hurt. It is no help against\nthe present objection for me to reflect, on Tuesday, that I am a\ndifferent person now from who I was then. My Monday-self can only have\nmeant either that his head would hurt on Tuesday, which was a\nfalse belief on his part if he no longer exists on Tuesday; or else\nthat the Tuesday-self would have a sore head. But if the Tuesday-self\nhas no sore head, then my Monday-self made a false prediction, and so\nmust have had a false belief. Either way, the relativist does not\nescape the objection.\n\n\nMoreover, this defence of Protagoras does not evade the following\ndilemma. Either what I mean by claiming (to take an example of\nBostock\u2019s) that \u201cThe wine will taste raw to me in five years\u2019\ntime\u201d is literally that. Or else what I mean is just\n\u201cIt seems to me that the wine will taste raw to me in\nfive years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\nSuppose I mean the former assertion. If the wine turns out not to\ntaste raw five years hence, Protagoras has no defence from the\nconclusion that I made a false prediction about how things would seem\nto me in five years. Or suppose I meant the latter assertion. Then I\ndid not make a prediction, strictly speaking, at all; merely\na remark about what presently seems to me.  Either way, Protagoras\nloses.\n6.6 Last Objection to Heracleitus: 179c1\u2013183c2\n\n\nSocrates argues that if Heracleitus\u2019 doctrine of flux is true, then no\nassertion whatever can properly be made. Therefore (a) Heracleitus\u2019\ntheory of flux no more helps to prove that knowledge is\nperception than that knowledge is not perception,\nand (b) Heracleiteans cannot coherently say anything at all, not even\nto state their own doctrine.\n\n\nThere are two variants of the argument. On the first of these\nvariants, evident in 181c2\u2013e10, Socrates distinguishes just\ntwo kinds of flux or process, namely qualitative alteration\nand spatial motion, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed\nto saying that both are continual. On the second variant, evident\nperhaps at 182a1, 182e4\u20135, Socrates distinguishes indefinitely many\nkinds of flux or process, not just qualitative alteration and motion\nthrough space, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed to\nsaying that every kind of flux is continual.\n\n\nNow the view that everything is always changing in every way might\nseem a rather foolish view to take about everyday objects. But, as\n182a2\u2013b8 shows, the present argument is not about everyday objects\nanyway. Plato does not apply his distinction between kinds of change\nto every sort of object whatever, including everyday objects. He\napplies it specifically to the objects (if that is the word) of\nHeracleitean metaphysics. These items are supposed by the Heracleitean\nto be the reality underlying all talk of everyday objects. It is at\nthe level of these Heracleitean perceivings and perceivers that\nPlato\u2019s argument against Heracleitus is pitched. And it is not\nobviously silly to suppose that Heracleitean perceivings and\nperceivers are constantly changing in every way.\n\n\nThe argument that Socrates presents on the Heracleiteans\u2019 behalf\ninfers from \u201cEverything is always changing in every way\u201d\nthat \u201cNo description of anything is excluded.\u201d How does\nthis follow?  McDowell 1976: 181\u20132 finds the missing link in the\nimpossibility of identifications. We cannot (says McDowell)\nidentify a moving sample of whiteness, or of seeing, any\nlonger once it has changed into some other colour, or\nperception.\n\n\nBut this only excludes reidentifications: presumably I can\nidentify the moving whiteness or the moving seeing until it\nchanges, even if this only gives me an instant in which to identify\nit.  This point renders McDowell\u2019s version, as it stands, an invalid\nargument. If it is on his account possible to identify the moving\nwhiteness until it changes, then it is on his account\npossible to identify the moving whiteness. But if that is possible,\nthen his argument contradicts itself: for it goes on to deny this\npossibility.\n\n\nSome other accounts of the argument also commit this fallacy.  Compare\nSayre\u2019s account (1969: 94): \u201cIf no statement, either affirmative\nor negative, can remain true for longer than the time taken in its\nutterance, then no statement can be treated as either true or false,\nand the cause of communicating with one\u2019s fellow beings must be given\nup as hopeless.\u201d \n\n\nSayre\u2019s argument aims at the conclusion \u201cNo statement can be\ntreated as either true or false.\u201d But Sayre goes via the premiss\n\u201cAny statement remains true no longer than the time taken in its\nutterance.\u201d If there are statements which are true,\neven if they are not true for very long, it is not clear why these\nstatements cannot be treated as true, at least in\nprinciple (and in practice too, given creatures with the right sensory\nequipment and sense of time).\n\n\nMcDowell\u2019s and Sayre\u2019s versions of the argument also face the\nfollowing objection. It is obvious how, given flux, a present-tense\nclaim like \u201cItem X is present\u201d can quickly cease\nto be true, because e.g., \u201cItem Y is present\u201d\ncomes to replace it. But it isn\u2019t obvious why flux should exclude the\npossibility of past-tense statements like \u201cItem X\nflowed into item Y between t1 and\nt2,\u201d or of tenseless statements like\n\u201cItem X is present at t1, item\nY is present at t2.\u201d As Bostock\n1988: 105\u20136 points out, \u201cSo long as we do have a language with\nstable meanings, and the ability to make temporal distinctions, there\nis no difficulty at all about describing an ever-changing\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo long as\u201d: to make the argument workable, we\nmay suggest that its point is that the meanings of words are\nexempt from flux. If meanings are not in flux, and if we have access\nto those meanings, nothing stops us from identifying the whiteness at\nleast until it flows away. But if meanings are in flux too, we will\nhave the result that the argument against Heracleitus actually\nproduces at 183a5: anything at all will count equally well as\nidentifying or not identifying the whiteness. \u201cUnless we\nrecognise some class of knowable entities exempt from the Heracleitean\nflux and so capable of standing as the fixed meanings of words, no\ndefinition of knowledge can be any more true than its\ncontradictory. Plato is determined to make us feel the need of his\nForms without mentioning them\u201d (Cornford 1935, 99).\n6.7 The Final Refutation of D1: 183c4\u2013187a8\n\n\nSocrates completes his refutation of the thesis that knowledge is\nperception by bringing a twelfth and final objection, directed against\nD1 itself rather than its Protagorean or Heracleitean\ninterpretations. This objection says that the mind makes use of a\nrange of concepts which it could not have acquired, and which do not\noperate, through the senses: e.g., \u201cexistence,\u201d\n\u201csameness,\u201d \u201cdifference.\u201d So there is a part\nof thought, and hence of knowledge, which has nothing to do with\nperception. Therefore knowledge is not perception.\n\n\nUnitarians and Revisionists will read this last argument against\nD1 in line with their general\norientations. Unitarians will suggest that Socrates\u2019 range of concepts\ncommon to the senses is a list of Forms. They will point to the\nsimilarities between the image of the senses as soldiers in a wooden\nhorse that Socrates offers at 184d1 ff., and the picture of a\nHeracleitean self, existing only in its awareness of particular\nperceptions, that he drew at 156\u2013160.\n\n\nRevisionists will retort that there are important differences between\nthe Heracleitean self and the wooden-horse self, differences that show\nthat Heracleiteanism is no longer in force in 184\u2013187. They will\ninsist that the view of perception in play in 184\u2013187 is Plato\u2019s own\nnon-Heracleitean view of perception. Thus Burnyeat 1990: 55\u201356 argues\nthat, since Heracleiteanism has been refuted by 184, \u201cthe organs\nand subjects dealt with [in the Wooden Horse passage] are the ordinary\nstable kind which continue in being from one moment to the\nnext.\u201d On the other hand, notice that Plato\u2019s equivalent for\nBurnyeat\u2019s \u201corgans and subjects\u201d is the single word\naisth\u00easeis (184d2). On its own, the word can mean\neither \u201csenses\u201d or \u201csensings\u201d; but it seems\nsignificant that it was the word Plato used at 156b1 for one of the\ntwo sorts of Heracleitean \u201coffspring.\u201d Plato speaks of the\naisth\u00easeis concealed \u201cas if within a Wooden\nHorse\u201d as pollai tines (184d1), \u201cindefinitely\nmany.\u201d But while there are indefinitely many Heracleitean\nsensings, there are not, of course, indefinitely many\nsenses. Indeed even the claim that we have many\nsenses (pollai), rather than several\n(enioi, tines), does not sound quite right, either\nin English or in Greek. This is perhaps why most translators, assuming\nthat aisth\u00easeis means \u201csenses,\u201d put\n\u201ca number of senses\u201d for pollai tines\naisth\u00easeis. Perhaps this is a mistake, and what\naisth\u00easeis means here is \u201cHeracleitean\nsensings.\u201d  If so, this explains how the\naisth\u00easeis inside any given Wooden Horse can be\npollai tines.\n\n\nIf the aisth\u00easeis in the Wooden Horse are Heracleitean\nsensings, not ordinary, un-Heracleitean senses, this\nsupports the Unitarian idea that 184\u2013187 is contrasting Heracleitean\nperceiving of particulars with Platonic knowing of the Forms (or\nknowing of particulars via, and in terms of, the\nForms).\n\n\nAnother piece of evidence pointing in the same direction is the\nsimilarity between Plato\u2019s list of the \u201ccommon notions\u201d at\nTheaetetus 186a and closely contemporary lists that he gives\nof the Forms, such as the list of Forms (likeness,\nmultitude, rest and their opposites) given at\nParmenides 129d, with ethical additions at\nParmenides 130b. There are also the megista\ngen\u00ea (\u201cgreatest kinds\u201d) of Sophist\n254b\u2013258e (being, sameness, otherness,\nrest and change); though whether these\ngen\u00ea are Forms is controversial.\n7. Second Definition (D2): \u201cKnowledge is True Judgement\u201d: 187b\u2013201c\n\n\n151\u2013187 has considered and rejected the proposal that knowledge is\nperception. Sometimes in 151\u2013187 \u201cperception\u201d seems to\nmean \u201cimmediate sensory awareness\u201d; at other times it\nseems to mean \u201cjudgements made about immediate sensory\nawareness.\u201d The proposal that \u201cKnowledge is immediate\nsensory awareness\u201d is rejected as incoherent: \u201cKnowledge\nis not to be found in our bodily experiences, but in our reasonings\nabout those experiences\u201d (186d2). The proposal that\n\u201cKnowledge is judgement about immediate sensory awareness\u201d\nraises the question how judgements, or beliefs, can emerge\nfrom immediate sensory awareness.  Answering this question is the\nmain aim in 187\u2013201.\n\n\nEmpiricists claim that sensation, which in itself has no cognitive\ncontent, is the source of all beliefs, which essentially have\ncognitive content\u2014which are by their very nature candidates for\ntruth or falsity. So unless we can explain how beliefs can be true or\nfalse, we cannot explain how there can be beliefs at all. Hence\nPlato\u2019s interest in the question of false belief. What Plato wants to\nshow in 187\u2013201 is that there is no way for the empiricist to\nconstruct contentful belief from contentless sensory awareness\nalone. The corollary is, of course, that we need something else\nbesides sensory awareness to explain belief. In modern terms, we need\nirreducible semantic properties. In Plato\u2019s terms, we need\nthe Forms.\n\n\nIn pursuit of this strategy of argument in 187\u2013201, Plato rejects in\nturn five possible empiricist explanations of how there can be false\nbelief. In the First Puzzle (188a\u2013c) he proposes a basic \ndifficulty for any empiricist. Then he argues that no move available\nto the empiricist circumvents this basic difficulty, however much\ncomplexity it may introduce (the other four Puzzles: 188d\u2013201b). The\nFifth Puzzle collapses back into the Third Puzzle, and the Third\nPuzzle collapses back into the First. The proposal that gives us the\nFourth Puzzle is disproved by the counter-examples that make the Fifth\nPuzzle necessary. As for the Second Puzzle, Plato deploys this to show\nhow empiricism has the disabling drawback that it turns an outrageous\nsophistical argument into a valid disproof of the possibility of at\nleast some sorts of false belief.\n\n\nThus 187\u2013201 continues the critique of perception-based accounts of\nknowledge that 151\u2013187 began. Contrary to what some\u2014for instance\nCornford\u2014have thought, it is no digression from the main path of the\nTheaetetus. On the contrary, the discussion of false belief\nis the most obvious way forward.\n\n\nAs Plato stresses throughout the dialogue, it is Theaetetus who is\ncaught in this problem about false belief. It is not Socrates, nor\nPlato. There is clear evidence at Philebus 38c ff. that false\nbelief (at least of some sorts) was no problem at all to Plato himself\n(at least at some points in his career). Plato\u2019s question is not\n\u201cHow on earth can there be false judgement?\u201d Rather it is\n\u201cWhat sort of background assumptions about knowledge must\nTheaetetus be making, given that he is puzzled by the question how\nthere can be false judgement?\u201d\n\n\nIs it only false judgements of identity that are at issue in\n187\u2013201, or is it any false judgement? One interpretation of\n187\u2013201 says that it is only about false judgements of\nmisidentification. Call this view misidentificationism. The\nmain alternative interpretation of 187\u2013201 says that it is about any\nand every false judgement. Call this view\nanti-misidentificationism. The present discussion assumes the truth of\nanti-misidentificationism; see Chappell 2005: 154\u2013157 for the\narguments.\n\n\nI turn to the detail of the five proposals about how to explain false\nbelief that occupy Stephanus pages 187 to 200 of the dialogue.\n7.1 The Puzzle of Misidentification: 187e5\u2013188c8\n\n\nThe first proposal about how to explain the possibility of false\nbelief is the proposal that false belief occurs when someone\nmisidentifies one thing as another. To believe or judge falsely is to\njudge, for some two objects O1 and O2, that\nO1 is O2.\n\n\nHow can such confusions even occur? Plato presents a dilemma that\nseems to show that they can\u2019t. The objects of the judgement,\nO1 and O2, must either be known or unknown to the\njudger x. Suppose one of the objects, say O1, is\nunknown to x. In that case, O1 cannot figure in\nx\u2019s thoughts at all, since x can only form\njudgements using objects that he knows. So if O1 is not an\nobject known to x, x cannot make any\njudgement about O1. A fortiori, then, x can\nmake no false judgement about O1 either.\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, both O1 and O2 are known to\nx, then x can perhaps make some judgements\nabout O1 and O2; but not the false judgement that\n\u201cO1 is O2.\u201d If x knows\nO1 and O2, x must know that O1 is\nO1 and O2 is O2, and that it would be a\nconfusion to identify them. So apparently false belief is impossible\nif the judger does not know both O1 and O2; but also\nimpossible if he does know both O1 and O2.  \n\n\nI cannot mistake X for Y unless I am able to\nformulate thoughts about X and Y. But I will not be\nable to formulate thoughts about X and Y unless I am\nacquainted with X and Y. Being acquainted\nwith X and Y means knowing X and\nY; and anyone who knows X and Y will not\nmistake them for each other.\n\n\nWhy think this a genuine puzzle? There seem to be plenty of everyday\ncases where knowing some thing in no way prevents us from sometimes\nmistaking that thing for something else. One example in the dialogue\nitself is at 191b (cp. 144c5). It is perfectly possible for someone\nwho knows Socrates to see Theaetetus in the distance, and wrongly\nthink that Theaetetus is Socrates. The First Puzzle does not even get\noff the ground, unless we can see why our knowledge of X and\nY should guarantee us against mistakes about X and\nY. Who is the puzzle of 188a\u2013c supposed to be a puzzle\nfor?\n\n\nSome authors, such as Bostock, Crombie, McDowell, and White, think\nthat Plato himself is puzzled by this puzzle. Thus Crombie 1963: 111\nthinks that Plato advances the claim that any knowledge at all of an\nobject O is sufficient for infallibility about O\nbecause he fails to see the difference between \u201cbeing acquainted\nwith X\u201d and \u201cbeing familiar with\nX.\u201d But to confuse knowing everything about\nX with knowing enough about X to use the name\n\u2018X\u2019 is really a very simple mistake. Plato would\nnot be much of a philosopher if he made this mistake.\n\n\nIf (as is suggested in e.g. Chappell 2004, ad loc.) 187\u2013201 is an\nindirect demonstration that false belief cannot be explained by\nempiricism (whether this means a developed philosophical theory, or\nthe instinctive empiricism of some people\u2019s common sense), then it is\nlikely that the First Puzzle states the basic difficulty for\nempiricism, to which the other four Puzzles look for alternative\nsolutions. The nature of this basic difficulty is not fully, or indeed\nat all, explained by the First Puzzle. We have to read on and watch\nthe development of the argument of 187\u2013201 to see exactly what the\nproblem is that gives the First Puzzle its bite.\n7.2 Second Puzzle About False Belief: \u201cBelieving What is Not\u201d: 188c10\u2013189b9\n\n\nThe second proposal says that false judgement is believing or judging\nta m\u00ea onta, \u201cthings that are\nnot\u201d or \u201cwhat is not.\u201d Socrates observes that if\n\u201cwhat is not\u201d is understood as it often was by Greek\nthinkers, as meaning \u201cnothing,\u201d then this proposal leads\nus straight into the sophistical absurdity that false beliefs are the\nsame thing as beliefs about nothing (i.e., contentless beliefs). But\nthere can be no beliefs about nothing; and there are false beliefs; so\nfalse belief isn\u2019t the same thing as believing what is not.\n\n\nSome think the Second Puzzle a mere sophistry. Bostock 1988: 165\ndistinguishes two versions of the sophistry: \u201cOn one version, to\nbelieve falsely is\u2026 to believe what is not \u2018just by\nitself\u2019; on the other version, it is to believe what is not\n\u2018about one of the things which are\u2019\u201d. The argument\nof the first version, according to Bostock, \u201cis just that there\nis no such thing as what is not (the case); it is a mere\nnonentity. But just as you cannot perceive a nonentity, so equally you\ncannot believe one either.\u201d Bostock proposes the following\nsolution to this problem: \u201cWe may find it natural to reply to\nthis argument by distinguishing\u2026 propositions [from] facts,\nsituations, states of affairs, and so on. Then we shall say that the\nthings that are believed are propositions, not facts\u2026 so a\nfalse belief is not directed at a non-existent.\u201d\n\n\nThis raises the question whether a consistent empiricist can admit the\nexistence of propositions. At least one great modern empiricist, Quine\n1953: 156\u20137, thinks not. Plato agrees: he regards a commitment to the\nexistence of propositions as evidence of Platonism,\nacceptance of the claim that abstract objects (and plenty of them)\ngenuinely exist. So an explanation of false judgement that invoked\nentities called propositions would be unavailable to the sort of\nempiricist that Plato has in his sights.\n\n\nBostock\u2019s second version of the puzzle makes it an even more\ntransparent sophistry, turning on a simple confusion between the\n\u201cis\u201d of predication and the \u201cis\u201d of\nexistence. As pointed out above, we can reasonably ask whether Plato\nmade this distinction, or made it as we make it.\n\n\nIf the structure of the Second Puzzle is really as Bostock suggests,\nthen the Second Puzzle is just the old sophistry about believing what\nis not (cp. Parmenides DK 29B8, Euthydemus 283e ff.,\nCratylus 429d, Republic 477a, Sophist 263e\nff.). Moreover, on this interpretation of the Second Puzzle, Plato is\ncommitted, in his own person and with full generality, to accepting\n(at least provisionally) a very bad argument for the conclusion that\nthere can be no false belief. It would be nice if an interpretation of\nthe Second Puzzle were available that saw it differently: e.g., as\naccepted by him only in a context where special reasons make the\nSecond Puzzle very plausible in that context.\n\n\nOne such interpretation is defended e.g., by Burnyeat 1990: 78, who\nsuggests that the Second Puzzle can only work if we accept the\n\u201cscandalous analogy between judging what is not and seeing or\ntouching what is not there to be seen or touched\u201d: \u201cA\nmodel on which judgements relate to the world in the same sort of\nunstructured way as perceiving or (we may add) naming, will tie anyone\nin knots when it comes to the question \u2018What is a false\njudgement the judgement/ name of?\u2019. The only available answer,\nwhen the judgement is taken as an unstructured whole, appears to be:\nNothing.\u201d\n\n\nNotice that it is the empiricist who will most naturally tend to rely\non this analogy. It is the empiricist who finds it natural to\nassimilate judgement and knowledge to perception, so far as he can. So\nwe may suggest that the Second Puzzle is a mere sophistry for any\ndecent account of false judgement, but a good argument against the\nempiricist account of false judgement that Plato is attacking. The\nmoral of the Second Puzzle is that empiricism validates the old\nsophistry because it treats believing or judging as too\nclosely analogous to seeing: 188e4\u20137. For empiricism judgement, and\nthought in general, consists in awareness of the ideas that are\npresent to our minds, exactly as they are present to our\nminds. It cannot consist in awareness of those ideas as they are\nnot; because (according to empiricism) we are immediately and\nincorrigibly aware of our own ideas, it can only consist in awareness\nof those ideas as they are. Nor can judgement consist in\nawareness of ideas that are not present to our minds, for\n(according to empiricism) what is not present to our minds cannot be a\npart of our thoughts. Still less can judgement consist in awareness of\nideas that do not exist at all.\n\n\nThe old sophists took false belief as \u201cjudging what is\nnot\u201d; they then fallaciously slid from \u201cjudging what is\nnot,\u201d to \u201cjudging nothing,\u201d to \u201cnot judging at\nall,\u201d and hence concluded that no judgement that was ever\nactually made was a false judgement. The empiricism that Plato attacks\nnot only repeats this logical slide; it makes it look almost\nreasonable. The point of the Second Puzzle is to draw out this\nscandalous consequence.\n7.3 Third Puzzle About False Belief: Allodoxia: 189b10\u2013190e4\n\n\nLiterally translated, the third proposal about how to explain the\npossibility of false belief says that false belief occurs \u201cwhen\nsomeone exchanges (antallaxamenos) in his understanding one\nof the things that are with another of the things that are, and says\nis\u201d (189b12\u2013c2).\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to read this very unclear statement is as meaning\nthat the distinctive addition in the third proposal is the notion of\ninadvertency. The point of Socrates\u2019 argument is that this\naddition does not help us to obtain an adequate account of false\nbelief because thought (dianoia) has to be understood as an\ninner process, with objects that we are always fully and explicitly\nconscious of. If we are fully and explicitly conscious of all the\nobjects of our thoughts, and if the objects of our thoughts are as\nsimple as empiricism takes them to be, there is simply no room for\ninadvertency. But without inadvertency, the third proposal simply\ncollapses back into the first proposal, which has already been\nrefuted.\n\n\nThe empiricist conception of knowledge that Theaetetus unwittingly\nbrings forth, and which Socrates is scrutinising, takes the objects of\nthought to be simple mental images which are either straightforwardly\navailable to be thought about, or straightforwardly absent. The First\nPuzzle showed that there is a general problem for the empiricist about\nexplaining how such images can be confused with each other, or indeed\nsemantically conjoined in any way at all. The Second Puzzle showed\nthat, because the empiricist lacks clear alternatives other than that\nsomeone should have a mental image or lack it, he is\nwide open to the sophistical argument which identifies\nbelieving with having a mental image, and then\nidentifies believing what is with having a mental\nimage, too\u2014and so \u201cproves\u201d the impossibility of\nfalse belief. The Third Puzzle restricts itself (at least up to 190d7)\nto someone who has the requisite mental images, and adds the\nsuggestion that he manages to confuse them by a piece of inadvertency.\nSocrates\u2019 rejoinder is that nothing has been done to show how\nthere can be inadvertent confusions of things that are as simple and\nunstructured, and as simply grasped or not grasped, as the\nempiricist takes mental images to be. Just as speech is explicit\nouter dialogue, so thought is explicit inner\ndialogue. What the empiricist needs to do to show the possibility of\nsuch a confusion is to explain how, on his principles, either speech\nor thought can fail to be fully explicit and fully \u201cin\ntouch\u201d with its objects, if it is \u201cin touch\u201d with\nthem at all.\n\n\nIn the discussion of the Fourth and Fifth Puzzles, Socrates and\nTheaetetus together work out the detail of two empiricist attempts to\nexplain just this. It then becomes clearer why Plato does not think\nthat the empiricist can explain the difference between fully explicit\nand not-fully-explicit speech or thought. Plato thinks that, to\nexplain this, we have to abandon altogether the empiricist conception\nof thought as the concatenation (somehow) of semantically inert simple\nmental images. Instead, we have to understand thought as the syntactic\nconcatenation of the genuine semantic entities, the Forms.\nMistakes in thought will then be comprehensible as mistakes either\nabout the logical interrelations of the Forms, or about the correct\napplication of the Forms to the sensory phenomena.\n7.4 Fourth Puzzle About False Belief: the Wax Tablet: 190e5\u2013196c5\n\n\nThe Wax Tablet passage offers us a more explicit account of the nature\nof thought, and its relationship with perception. The story now on\noffer says explicitly that perception relates to thought roughly as\nHumean \u201cimpressions\u201d relate to Humean \u201cideas\u201d\n(191d; compare Hume, First Enquiry II). The objects of\nperception, as before, are a succession of constantly-changing\nimmediate awarenesses.  The objects of thought, it is now added, are\nthose objects of perception to which we have chosen to give a measure\nof stability by imprinting them on the wax tablets in our minds. (The\nimage of memory as writing in the mind had currency in Greek thought\nwell before Plato\u2019s time: see e.g. Aeschylus, Eumenides\n275.)\n\n\nThis new spelling-out of the empiricist account of thought seems to\noffer new resources for explaining the possibility of false\nbelief. The new explanation can say that false belief occurs when\nthere is a mismatch, not between two objects of thought, nor\nbetween two objects of perception, but between one object of\neach type.\n\n\nThis proposal faces a simple and decisive objection. No one disputes\nthat there are false beliefs that cannot be explained as\nmismatches of thought and perception: e.g., false beliefs about\narithmetic. The Wax Tablet does not explain how such false beliefs\nhappen; indeed it entails that they can\u2019t happen. Such\nmistakes are confusions of two objects of thought, and the Wax Tablet\nmodel does not dispute the earlier finding that there can be no such\nconfusions. So the Wax Tablet model fails.\n\n\nThere is of course plenty more that Plato could have said in\ncriticism of the Wax Tablet model. Most obviously, he could have\npointed out the absurdity of identifying any number with any\nindividual\u2019s thought of that number (195e9 ff.); especially\nwhen the numerical thought in question is no more than an ossified\nperception. In the present passage Plato is content to refute the Wax\nTablet by the simplest and shortest argument available: so he does not\nmake this point. But perhaps the point is meant to occur to the\nreader; for the same absurdity reappears in an even more glaring form\nin the Aviary passage.\n7.5 Fifth Puzzle About False Belief: the Aviary: 196d1\u2013200d4\n\n\nIf we had a solution to the very basic problem about how the\nempiricist can get any content at all out of sensation, then the\nfourth proposal might show how the empiricist could explain false\nbelief involving perception. The fifth and last proposal about how to\nexplain the possibility of false belief attempts to remedy the fourth\nproposal\u2019s incapacity\u2014which Plato says refutes it,\n196c5\u20137\u2014to deal with cases of false belief involving no\nperception, such as false arithmetical beliefs. \n\n\nIt attempts this by deploying a distinction between knowledge that\nsomeone merely has (latent knowledge) and knowledge that he\nis actually using (active knowledge). (Perhaps Plato\nis now exploring \u201cthe intermediate stages between knowing and\nnot knowing\u201d mentioned at 188a2\u20133.) The suggestion is that false\nbelief occurs when someone wants to use some item of latent knowledge\nin his active thought, but makes a wrong selection from among the\nitems that he knows latently.\n\n\nIf this proposal worked it would cover false arithmetical belief.  But\nthe proposal does not work, because it is regressive. If there is a\nproblem about the very possibility of confusing two things, it is no\nanswer to this problem to suppose that for each thing there is a\ncorresponding item of knowledge, and that what happens when two\nthings are confused is really that the two corresponding\nitems of knowledge are confused\n(200a\u2013b).\n\n\nThe Aviary rightly tries to explain false belief by complicating our\npicture of belief. But it complicates in the wrong way and the wrong\nplace. It is no help to complicate the story by throwing in further\nobjects of the same sort as the objects that created the difficulty\nabout false belief in the first place. What is needed is a different\nsort of object for thought: a kind of object that can be thought of\nunder different aspects (say, as \u201cthe sum of 5 and 7,\u201d or\nas \u201cthe integer 12\u201d). There are no such aspects to the\n\u201citems of knowledge\u201d that the Aviary deals in. As with the\nconception of the objects of thought and knowledge that we found in\nthe Wax Tablet, it is this lack of aspects that dooms the Aviary\u2019s\nconception of the objects of knowledge too. Like the Wax Tablet, the\nAviary founders on its own inability to accommodate the point that\nthought cannot consist merely in the presentation of a series of inert\n\u201cobjects of thought.\u201d  Whether these objects of thought\nare mental images drawn from perception or something else, the\nthinking is not so much in the objects of thought as in what is\ndone with those objects (186d2\u20134).\n\n\nWe may illustrate this by asking: When the dunce who supposes that 5 +\n7 = 11 decides to activate some item of knowledge to be the answer to\n\u201cWhat is the sum of 5 and 7?,\u201d which item of\nknowledge does he thus decide to activate? At first only two answers\nseem possible: either he decides to activate 12, or he decides to\nactivate 11. If he decides to activate 12, then we cannot explain the\nfact that what he actually does is activate 11, except by saying that\nhe mistakes the item of knowledge which is 11 for the item of\nknowledge which is 12. But this mistake is the very mistake ruled out\nas impossible right at the beginning of the inquiry into false belief\n(188a\u2013c).  Alternatively, if he decides to activate 11, then we have\nto ask why he decides to do this. The most plausible answer\nto that question is: \u201cBecause he believes falsely that 5 + 7 =\n11.\u201d But as noted above, if he has already formed this false\nbelief, within the account that is supposed to explain false\nbelief, then a regress looms.\n\n\nIn fact, the correct answer to the question \u201cWhich item of\nknowledge does the dunce decide to activate?\u201d is neither\n\u201c12\u201d nor \u201c11.\u201d It is \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7.\u201d But this answer does\nnot save the Aviary theorist from the dilemma just pointed out; for it\nis not available to him. To be able to give this answer, the Aviary\ntheorist would have to be able to distinguish \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7\u201d from\n\u201c12.\u201d But since \u201c12\u201d is \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7,\u201d this distinction\ncannot be made by anyone who takes the objects of thought to be simple\nin the way that the Aviary theorist seems to.\n\n\nAt 199e1 ff. Theaetetus suggests an amendment to the Aviary. This is\nthat we might have items of ignorance in our heads as well as\nitems of knowledge. As Socrates remarks, these ignorance-birds can be\nconfused with knowledge-birds in just the same way as knowledge-birds\ncan be confused with each other. So the addition does not help.\n7.6 The Final Refutation of D2: 200d5\u2013201c7\n\n\nAt 200d\u2013201c Socrates argues more directly against\nD2.  He offers a counter-example to the thesis that\nknowledge is true belief. A skilled lawyer can bring jurymen into a\nstate of true belief without bringing them into a state of knowledge;\nso knowledge and true belief are different states.\n\n\nMcDowell 1976: 227\u20138 suggests that this swift argument\n\u201ccontradicts the most characteristic expositions of the Theory\nof Forms, which indicate that the title \u2018knowledge\u2019 should\nbe reserved for a relation between the mind and the Forms untainted by\nany reliance on perception.\u201d By contrast Plato here tells us,\nquite unambiguously, that the jury are persuaded into a state of true\nbelief \u201cabout things which only someone who sees them can\nknow\u201d (201b8). This implies that there can be knowledge which is\nentirely reliant on perception. (One way out of this is to deny that\nPlato ever thought that knowledge is only of the Forms, as\nopposed to thinking that knowledge is paradigmatically of the\nForms. For this more tolerant Platonist view about perception see e.g.\nPhilebus 58d\u201362d, and Timaeus 27d ff.)\n\n\nThe jury argument seems to be a counter-example not only to\nD2 but also to D3, the thesis that\nknowledge is true belief with an account (provided we allow\nthat the jury \u201chave an account\u201d).\n\n\nA third problem about the jury argument is that Plato seems to offer\ntwo incompatible explanations of why the jury don\u2019t know: first that\nthey have only a limited time to hear the arguments (201b3, 172e1);\nand second that their judgement is second-hand (201b9).\n8. Third Definition (D3): \u201cKnowledge is True Judgement With an Account\u201d: 201d\u2013210a\n\n\nTheaetetus\u2019 third proposal about how to knowledge is\n(D3) that it is true belief with an account (meta\nlogou al\u00eath\u00ea doxan).\n\n\nD3 apparently does nothing at all to solve the main\nproblems that D2 faced. Besides the jurymen\ncounter-example just noted, 187\u2013201 showed that we could not define\nknowledge as true belief unless we had an account of\nfalse belief. This problem has not just evaporated in\n201\u2013210.  It will remain as long as we propose to define knowledge as\ntrue belief plus anything. Significantly, this does not seem to bother\nPlato\u2014as we might expect if Plato is not even trying to offer an\nacceptable definition of knowledge, but is rather undermining\nunacceptable definitions.\n\n\nOne crucial question about Theaetetus 201\u2013210 is the question\nwhether the argument is concerned with objectual or propositional\nknowledge. This is a basic and central division among interpretations\nof the whole passage 201\u2013210, but it is hard to discuss it properly\nwithout getting into the detail of the Dream Theory: see section\n8a.\n\n\nA second question, which arises often elsewhere in the\nTheaetetus, is whether the argument\u2019s appearance of\naporia reflects genuine uncertainty on Plato\u2019s part, or is\nrather a kind of literary device. Is Plato thinking aloud, trying to\nclarify his own view about the nature of knowledge, as Revisionists\nsuspect? Or is he using an aporetic argument only to smoke out his\nopponents, as Unitarians think?\n\n\nThe evidence favours the latter reading. There are a significant\nnumber of other passages where something very like Theaetetus\u2019 claim\n(D3) that knowledge is \u201ctrue belief with an\naccount\u201d is not only discussed, but actually defended: for\ninstance, Meno 98a2, Phaedo 76b5\u20136, Phaedo\n97d\u201399d2, Symposium 202a5\u20139, Republic 534b3\u20137, and\nTimaeus 51e5. So it appears that, in the Theaetetus,\nPlato cannot be genuinely puzzled about what knowledge can be. Nor can\nhe genuinely doubt his own former confidence in one version of\nD3. If he does have a genuine doubt or puzzle of this\nsort, it is simply incredible that he should say what he does say in\n201\u2013210 without also expressing it.\n\n\nWhat Plato does in 201\u2013210 is: present a picture (Socrates\u2019 Dream) of\nhow things may be if D3 is true (201c\u2013202c); raise\nobjections to the Dream theory which are said (206b12) to be decisive\n(202c\u2013206c); and present and reject three further suggestions about\nthe meaning of logos, and so three more versions of\nD3 (206c\u2013210a). But none of these four\ninterpretations of D3 is Plato\u2019s own earlier version\nof D3, which says that knowledge = true belief with\nan account of the reason why the true belief is true. If what\nPlato wants to tell us in Theaetetus 201\u2013210 is that he no\nlonger accepts any version of D3, not even\nhis own version, then it is extraordinary that he does not even\nmention his own version, concentrating instead on versions of\nD3 so different from Plato\u2019s version as to be\nobviously irrelevant to its refutation.\n\n\nUnitarians can suggest that Plato\u2019s strategy is to refute what he\ntakes to be false versions of D3 so as to increase\nthe logical pressure on anyone who rejects Plato\u2019s version of\nD3. In particular, he wants to put pressure on the\nempiricist theories of knowledge that seem to be the main target of\nthe Theaetetus. What Plato wants to show is, not only that no\ndefinition of knowledge except his own, D3, is\nacceptable, but also that no version of D3 except his\nown is acceptable.\n8.1 The Dream of Socrates: 201d8\u2013202d7\n\n\nRather as Socrates offered to develop D1 in all sorts\nof surprising directions, so now he offers to develop\nD3 into a sophisticated theory of knowledge. This\ntheory, usually known as the \u201cDream of Socrates\u201d or the\n\u201cDream Theory,\u201d posits two kinds of existents, complexes\nand simples, and proposes that \u201can account\u201d means\n\u201can account of the complexes that analyses them into their\nsimple components.\u201d Thus \u201cknowledge of x\u201d\nturns out to mean \u201ctrue belief about x with an account\nof x that analyses x into its simple\ncomponents.\u201d\n\n\nTaken as a general account of knowledge, the Dream Theory implies that\nknowledge is only of complexes, and that there can be no knowledge of\nsimples. Socrates attacks this implication.\n\n\nA common question about the Dream Theory is whether it is concerned\nwith objectual or propositional knowledge. Those who take the Dream\nTheory to be concerned with propositional knowledge include\nRyle 1990: 27\u201330: \u201cfrom 201 onwards Plato concentrates on\n\u2018know\u2019 (conna\u00eetre): [Socrates\u2019 Dream] is a\nlogician\u2019s theory, a theory about the composition of truths and\nfalsehoods.\u201d Those who take the Dream Theory to be concerned\nwith objectual knowledge include White 1976: 177, and Crombie\n1963: II: 41\u201342; also Bostock 1988. A third way of taking the Dream\nTheory, which may well be the most promising interpretation, is to\ntake it as a Logical Atomism: as a theory which founds an\naccount of propositional structure on an account of the concatenation\nof simple objects of experience or acquaintance such as \u201csense\ndata.\u201d\n\n\nThe Logical-Atomist reading of the Dream Theory undercuts the\npropositional/objectual distinction. On this reading, the Dream\nTheory claims that simple, private objects of experience are the\nelements of the proposition; thus, the Dream Theory is both a\ntheory about the structure of propositions and a theory about\nsimple and complex objects. It claims in effect that a proposition\u2019s\nstructure is that of a complex object made up out of simple objects,\nwhere these simple objects are conceived in the Russellian manner as\nobjects of inner perception or acquaintance, and the complexes which\nthey compose are conceived in the phenomenalist manner as\n(epistemological and/ or semantic) constructs out of those simple\nobjects.\n\n\nThis supposition makes good sense of the claim that we ourselves are\nexamples of complexes (201e2: \u201cthe primary elements\n(pr\u00f4ta stoikheia) of which we and everything else are\ncomposed\u2026\u201d). If the Dream theorist is a Logical Atomist,\nhe will think that there is a clear sense in which people, and\neverything else, are composed out of sense data. He will also think\nthat descriptions of objects, too, are complexes constructed in\nanother way out of the immediately available simples of sensation.\n\n\nFor such a theorist, epistemology and semantics alike rest upon the\nfoundation provided by the simple objects of acquaintance. Both\nthought and meaning consist in the construction of complex objects out\nof those simple objects. Philosophical analysis, meanwhile, consists\nin stating how the complexes involved in thought and meaning\nare constructed out of simples. This statement involves, amongst other\nthings, dividing down to and enumerating the (simple) parts of such\ncomplexes.\n\n\nWhat then is the relation of the Dream Theory to the problems posed\nfor empiricism by the discussion of D2 in 187\u2013201?  The fundamental\nproblem for empiricism, as we saw, is the problem how to get from\nsensation to content: the problem of how we could start with bare\nsense-data, and build up out of them anything that deserved to be\ncalled meaning. Plato thinks that there is a good answer to\nthis, though it is not an empiricist answer. Sense experience becomes\ncontentful when it is understood and arranged according to the\nstructures that the Forms give it. So to understand sense experience\nis, in the truest sense, \u201cto give an account\u201d for it.\n\n\nThe empiricist cannot offer this answer to the problem of how to get\nfrom sensation to content without ceasing to be an empiricist. What\nthe empiricist can do is propose that content arises out of\nsets of sense experiences. We get to the level of belief and knowledge\nonly when we start to consider such sets: before that we are at the\nlevel only of perception. Our beliefs, couched in expressions that\nrefer to and quantify over such sets, will then become knowledge (a)\nwhen they are true, and (b) when we understand the full story of their\ncomposition out of such sets.\n\n\nIf this is the point of the Dream Theory, then the best answer to the\nquestion \u201cWhose is the Dream Theory?\u201d is \u201cIt belongs\nto the empiricist whom Plato is attacking.\u201d\n8.2 Critique of the Dream Theory: 202d8\u2013206c2\n\n\nThe Dream Theory says that knowledge of O is true belief\nabout O plus an account of O\u2019s composition. If\nO is not composite, O cannot be known, but only\n\u201cperceived\u201d (202b6).\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 main strategy in 202d8\u2013206c2 is to attack the Dream\u2019s claim\nthat complexes and elements are distinguishable in respect of\nknowability. To this end he deploys a dilemma. A complex, say a\nsyllable, is either (a) no more than its elements (its letters), or\n(b) something over and above those elements.\n\n\n202d8\u2013203e1 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from\nalternative (a), that a complex is no more than its elements. If I am\nto know a syllable SO, and that syllable is no more than its\nelements, then I cannot know the syllable SO without also\nknowing its elements S and O. Indeed, it seems that\ncoming to know the parts S and O is both necessary\nand sufficient for coming to know the syllable SO. But if\nthat is right, and if the letter/syllable relation models the\nelement/complex relation, then if any complex is knowable,\nits elements will be knowable too; and if any complex\u2019s elements\nare\nunknowable, then the complex will be unknowable too. This\nresult contradicts the Dream Theory.\n\n\n203e2\u2013205e8 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from\nalternative (b), that a complex is something over and above its\nelements. In that case, to know the syllable is to know something for\nwhich knowledge of the elements is not sufficient. The syllable turns\nout to be \u201ca single Idea that comes to be out of the\nfitted-together elements\u201d (204a1\u20132). But then the syllable does\nnot have the elements as parts: if it did, that would compromise its\nsingularity. And if the elements are not the parts of the syllable,\nnothing else can be. So the syllable has no parts, which makes it as\nsimple as an element. Thus if the element is unknowable, the syllable\nmust be unknowable too. This result contradicts the Dream Theory\ntoo.\n\n\nFinally, in 206a1\u2013c2, Plato makes a further, very simple, point\nagainst the Dream Theory. Our own experience of learning letters and\nsyllables shows that it is both more basic and more important to know\nelements than complexes, not vice versa as the Dream Theory\nimplies. The thesis that the complexes are knowable, the elements\nunknowable, is false to our experience, in which \u201cknowledge of\nthe elements is primary\u201d (Burnyeat 1990:192).\n8.3 Three Attempts to Understand Logos: 206c2\u2013210a9\n\n\nThe refutation of the Dream Theory\u2019s attempt to spell out what it\nmight be like for D3 to be true is followed by three\nattempts to give an account of what a logos is. The first\nattempt to give an account of \u201caccount\u201d takes\nlogos just to mean \u201cspeech\u201d or\n\u201cstatement.\u201d This is deemed obviously insufficient\n(206c1\u2013206e3).\n\n\nA second attempted explanation of \u201clogos of O\u201d\ntakes it as \u201cenumeration of the elements of\nO.\u201d The logos is a statement of the\nelements of the object of knowledge. You have knowledge of\nsomething when, in addition to your true belief about it, you are able\nalso to \u201cgo through the elements\u201d of that thing.\n\n\nPlato\u2019s objection to this proposal (208b) is that it leaves open the\npossibility that someone could count as having knowledge of the name\n\u201cTheaetetus\u201d even if they could do no more than write out\nthe letters of the name \u201cTheaetetus\u201d in the right\norder. Since such a person can enumerate the elements of the complex,\ni.e., the letters of the name (207c8\u2013d1), he has an account. Since he\ncan arrange those letters in their correct order (208a9\u201310), he also\nhas true belief. For all that, insists Plato, he does not have\nknowledge of the name \u201cTheaetetus.\u201d\n\n\nWhy not, we might ask? To see the answer we should bring in what Plato\nsays about syllables at 207d8\u2013208a3. Suppose someone could enumerate\nthe letters of \u201cTheaetetus,\u201d and could give their correct\norder, and yet knew nothing about syllables. This person wouldn\u2019t\ncount as knowing \u201cTheaetetus\u201d because he would have no\nunderstanding of the principles that get us from ordered letters to\nnames. Those principles are principles about how letters form\nsyllables, and how syllables form names. A person who can\nstate only the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d and their order has\nno awareness of these principles.\n\n\nTo put it a modern way, a robot or an automatic typewriter might be\nable to reproduce or print the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d\ncorrectly and in order. It might even be able to store such a correct\nordering in its electronic memory. That would not show that such a\nmachine understood how to spell \u201cTheaetetus,\u201d any\nmore than the symbol-manipulating capacities of the man in Searle\u2019s\nChinese Room show that he understands Chinese. What is missing is an\nawareness of bridging or structuring principles, rules explaining\nhow we get from strings of symbols, via syllables,\nto representations of Greek names. \n\n\nKnowledge of such bridging principles can reasonably be called\nknowledge of why the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d are\nwhat they are. So it is plausible to suggest that the moral of the\nargument is to point us to the need for an account in the sense of an\nexplanation \u201cWhy?,\u201d and so to the version of\nD3 that Plato himself accepts.\n\n\nThe third proposed account of logos says that to give the\nlogos of O is to cite the s\u00eameion or\ndiaphora of O. In the Wax Tablet passage,\ns\u00eameion meant \u2018imprint\u2019; in the present\npassage, it means the \u2018sign\u2019 or diagnostic feature wherein\nx differs from everything else, or everything else of\nO\u2019s own kind. So, presumably, knowledge of (say) Theaetetus\nconsists in true belief about Theaetetus plus an account of what\ndifferentiates Theaetetus from every other human.\n\n\nSocrates offers two objections to this proposal. First, if knowledge\nof Theaetetus requires a mention of his s\u00eameion, so\ndoes true belief about Theaetetus. Second, to possess\n\u201can account of Theaetetus\u2019 s\u00eameion\u201d must\nmean either (a) having true belief about that s\u00eameion,\nor else (b) having knowledge of it. But it has already been pointed\nout that any true belief, if it is to qualify as being about\nTheaetetus at all, must already be true belief about his\ns\u00eameion. So interpretation (a) has the result that\nknowledge of Theaetetus = true belief about Theaetetus\u2019\ns\u00eameion + true belief about Theaetetus\u2019\ns\u00eameion. As for (b): if we want to know what knowledge\nis, it is no help to be told that knowledge of O = something\nelse + knowledge of the s\u00eameion of\nO. We still need to know what knowledge of the\ns\u00eameion of O is. Nor will it help us to be\nlaunched on a vicious regress: as we will be if we are told that\nknowledge of the s\u00eameion of O = something else\n+ knowledge of the s\u00eameion of the\ns\u00eameion of O.  \n\n\nThis is where the argument ends, and Socrates leaves to meet his\naccusers.\n9. Conclusion\n\n\nThe Theaetetus is an extended attack on certain assumptions\nand intuitions about knowledge that the intelligent\nman-in-the-street\u2014Theaetetus, for instance\u2014might find\ninitially attractive, and which some philosophers known to\nPlato\u2014Protagoras and Heracleitus, for instance\u2014had worked\nup into complex and sophisticated philosophical theories. Basic to all\nthese assumptions and intuitions, which here have been grouped together under\nthe name \u201cempiricism,\u201d is the idea that knowledge is\nconstructed out of perception and perception alone.\n\n\nThe first part of the Theaetetus attacks the idea that\nknowledge could be simply identified with perception.\nPerceptions alone have no semantic structure. So if this thesis was\ntrue, it would be impossible to state it.\n\n\nThe second part attacks the suggestion that knowledge can be defined\nas true belief, where beliefs are supposed to be\nsemantically-structured concatenations of sensory impressions. Against\nthis Plato argues that, unless something can be said to explain\nhow impressions can be concatenated so as to give them\nsemantic structure, there is no reason to grant that the distinction\nbetween true and false applies to such beliefs any more than it does\nto perceptions.\n\n\nFinally, in the third part of the Theaetetus, an attempt is\nmade to meet this challenge, and present some explanation of how\nsemantic structures can arise out of mere perceptions or impressions.\nThe proposed explanation is the Dream Theory, a theory interestingly\ncomparable to Russellian Logical Atomism, which takes both\npropositions and objects to be complexes \u201clogically\nconstructed\u201d out of simple sensory impressions. On this\nconception, knowledge will come about when someone is capable not only\nof using such logical constructions in thought, but of understanding\nhow they arise from perception.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 basic objection to this theory is that it still gives no\nproper explanation of how this logical construction takes\nplace. Without such an explanation, there is no good reason to treat\nthe complexes that are thus logically constructed as anything other\nthan simples in their own right. We need to know how it can be that,\nmerely by conjoining perceptions in the right way, we manage to\nachieve a degree of semantic structure that (for instance) makes it\npossible to refer to things in the world, such as\nTheaetetus. But this is not explained simply by listing all the simple\nperceptions that are so conjoined. Nor\u2014and this is where we\nreach the third proposal of 208b11\u2013210a9\u2014is it explained by\nfixing on any of those perceptions in particular, and taking it to be\nthe special mark of Theaetetus whereby reference to Theaetetus is\nfixed.\n\n\nThe third proposal about how to understand logos faces the\ndifficulty that, if it adds anything at all to differentiate knowledge\nof O from true belief about O, then what it adds is\na diagnostic quality of O. If there is a problem about how to\nidentify O, there is a problem about how to identify the\ndiagnostic quality too. This launches a vicious regress.\n\n\nOne way of preventing this regress is to argue that the regress is\ncaused by the attempt to work up a definition of knowledge exclusively out of\nempiricist materials. Hence there is no way of avoiding such a vicious\nregress if you are determined to try to define knowledge on an exclusively\nempiricist basis. The right response is to abandon that attempt.\nKnowledge is indeed indefinable in empiricist terms. In those\nterms, it has no logos. In those terms, therefore,\nknowledge itself is unknowable.\n\n\nThe official conclusion of the Theaetetus is that we still do\nnot know how to define knowledge. Even on the most sceptical reading,\nthis is not to say that we have not learned anything about what\nknowledge is like. As Theaetetus says (210b6), he has given birth to\nfar more than he had in him.\n\n\nAnd as many interpreters have seen, there may be much more to the\nending than that. It may even be that, in the last two pages of the\nTheaetetus, we have seen hints of Plato\u2019s own answer to the\npuzzle. Perhaps understanding has emerged from the last\ndiscussion, as wisdom did from 145d\u2013e, as the key ingredient\nwithout which no true beliefs alone can even begin to look like they\nmight count as knowledge. Perhaps it is only when we, the readers,\nunderstand this point\u2014that epistemological success in the last\nresort depends on having epistemological virtue\u2014that we begin\nnot only to have true beliefs about what knowledge is, but to\nunderstand knowledge. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, R.
