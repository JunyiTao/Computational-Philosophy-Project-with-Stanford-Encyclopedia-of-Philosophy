    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Theory of the Correlatives\n3.3 Theory of the Correlatives\n\nOne of the most original aspects of Llull\u2019s philosophy is the\ntheory of the correlatives, which does not follow the analogic logic\nfound in the first formulations of the Ars, but a logic whose\nfoundations are the ontological principles that explain the\nconcatenation between beings based on their own nature.\n\nAccording to the theory of the correlatives, the nature of a being is\nsomething defined by its activity. Therefore, being and activity are\ninseparable and identified (esse and agere).\nConsequently, according to the theory of the correlatives, the nature\nof a being is defined based on (a) its activity, that which makes it\nactive and allows it to execute different intrinsic and extrinsic\nactions; (b) its passion, that which affects the being either\nintrinsically by itself or extrinsically by another; and (c) its\naction, that which makes it being in act and being in constant\nmovement. This structure, which will receive diverse formulations\nthroughout his work, namely matter/form/conjunction,\nbeginning/middle/end, or doer/done/means (Gay\u00e1 2008; Bonner\n2007), is presented in the book Liber de ascensu et descensu\nintellectus as follows: every being has a natural virtue, which\ncan be \u201cactive\u201d, \u201cpassive\u201d, and\n\u201cconnective\u201d. These virtues are the correlatives that\nLlull linguistically distinguishes using suffixes. For the active\nnature he uses -tivus (e.g., bonificativus), for the passive,\n-bilis (bonificabilis), and for the connective, -are\n(bonificare).\n\nThe nature of each being is constituted, intrinsically, by its\ncorrelatives, which are, for example, in the case of man,\n\u201chomificativus\u201d,\n\u201chomificabilis\u201d, and\n\u201chomificare\u201d. Through the actions carried out by\nthese correlatives, man must actualize the potentiality of his act.\nHowever, as every being is formed by certain faculties, the activity,\nthe passivity, and the connectivity of man\u2019s nature must be\nexercised through each one of these faculties. Thus, to see, he will\nuse the vision formed by its correlatives (which will be explained in\nthe following sections), and so on. When he uses each one of these\ncorrelatives, he must apply the dynamism of the correlatives of the\nprinciples such as \u201cbonitas\u201d or\n\u201cmagnitudo\u201d, by which he is also constituted, to\nreflect the divinity of the dignities in his action.\n\nThe correlatives form, therefore, a complex structure that is\nreproduced throughout the ladder and in each one of the beings, from\nGod to a stone, to ontologically explain the continuity among all\nbeings. In each one of them, the chain of the whole of creation is\nreproduced.\n\nThe correlatives are also distinguished in God because, for Llull,\nactivity is needed for nature, and there could only be divine nature\nif it has an activity. Llull identifies the divine correlatives in\ntheir intrinsic action through the Trinity, namely the Father, the\nSon, and the Holy Spirit, while their extrinsic action, through the\nDignities, will result in creation.\n",
