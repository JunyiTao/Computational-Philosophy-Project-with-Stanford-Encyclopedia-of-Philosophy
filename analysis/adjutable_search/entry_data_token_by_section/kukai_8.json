    "main_text": "Thought || Hosshin Sepp\u014d: The Buddha\u2019s Cosmic Preaching of the Dharma\n3.6 Hosshin Sepp\u014d: The Buddha\u2019s Cosmic Preaching of the Dharma\n\nAs the hosshin, the Buddha Dainichi preaches the Dharma\nvia his omnipresencing, that is, through every sensible media\nof the cosmos. K\u016bkai called this, hosshin sepp\u014d\n(literally: \u201cthe dharmak\u0101ya\u2019s expounding of\nthe Dharma\u201d), and used its concept (e.g. in his Benkenmitsu\nnikky\u014dron) as an important criterion for distinguishing\nesoteric Buddhism from exoteric Buddhism. In his work\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi, this concept of hosshin\nsepp\u014d serves as the starting point. The sepp\u014d\n(\u201cpreaching,\u201d \u201cexpounding\u201d) therein is equated\nwith the phenomena of the cosmos as comprising\nsh\u014djijiss\u014d, that is, sound, sign, reality, and\ntheir meanings. (We will discuss the linguistic or semiological\nsignificance of this idea in the following section.) The point is that\nevery thing and every event in the universe, as objects of our six\nsenses, are the Buddha\u2019s preaching of the Dharma. Each\nphenomenon manifest serves to explain (setsu) the truth, the\nDharma. The hosshin in its omnipresencing throughout the\ncosmos, permeating every aspect of it, is perpetually informing all\nthings of the Dharma. This cosmic omnipresencing of the Dharma via\nhosshin sepp\u014d entails a dynamism of continuous activity\nthat accounts for the movements within the universe \u2013 both\nphysical and mental.\n\nSince everything to which Dainichi preaches, is itself his\nmanifestation as an embodied part of the cosmos, the sermon is\nultimately a monologue. The expounding of the Dharma is in one sense\nthen really the Buddha\u2019s monologic expression of his own\nself-enjoyment in samadhic bliss. And yet simultaneously it\nexpresses Dainichi\u2019s compassion for the unawakened (though\nultimately they are non-dualistic with the Buddha) so that they may\nalso enjoy the fruits of the Dharma. Through the help of\nDainichi\u2019s compassionate con-descension or kaji (more\non this in a later section), the practitioner is enabled to\ninter-resonate with the sermon of the cosmos.\n\nThe idea of hosshin sepp\u014d also expresses a\nuniversalization in Shingon of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion\nof expedient (or: skillful) means. The Shingon doctrine of\nh\u014dben kuky\u014d (\u201cultimacy of expedient\nmeans\u201d) means that any phenomenon or thing-event of the cosmos\ncan serve as a means to enlightenment, entailing a gradation of\nunderstanding, hinging on how the event speaks to the person relative\nto the time, place, and situational context. This also corresponds to\nthe levels of mental states discussed in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nJ\u016bj\u016bshinron (which we will examine in a further\nsection below). The key to immediate and complete enlightenment\nhowever is to understand the comprehensive (or\nholistic) sense of the truth being spoken by the cosmos as a\nwhole even if through the medium of a particular thing-event.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s claim was that only through the Buddhism of\nesoteric teachings can one attain to an experiential recognition of\nhosshin sepp\u014d, i.e. that the cosmos itself is describing\nthe immediate enlightened body-and-mind state of the Buddha. By\ncontrast exoteric truths preached by other forms of Buddhism are meant\nfor a specific audience in a specific place and time, and hence are\nconditional, relative, and provisional. Moreover exoteric truths are\nlimited by human language, which is inadequate to describe the state\nof enlightenment and the absoluteness of the Dharma. The esoteric\ntruth revealed in hosshin sepp\u014d on the other hand\nunfolds through a non-human language, that is, a cosmic and esoteric\nlanguage originating in the hosshin itself. This is the\nlanguage of the mantra or in Japanese, shingon, literally\nmeaning \u201cthe word of truth,\u201d and from which\nK\u016bkai\u2019s brand of Buddhism derives its name. Mantra\n(shingon) is the language of the cosmos involving all mental\nand physical-sensible phenomena. The esoteric truths expressed in this\nmantric language of the Buddha/cosmos reveal themselves only in\naccordance with the reader\u2019s capacity to attune himself to, and\nread, this cosmic (con)text of the mantric universe.\n",
