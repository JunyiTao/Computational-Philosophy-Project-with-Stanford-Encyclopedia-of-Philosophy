They are\nespecially interesting from a foundational perspective because they\nhave no evident classical analogues and because they offer new insight\non the role of\n entanglement\n in quantum computing (Jozsa 2006). They may also have interesting\nengineering-related consequences, suggesting a different kind of\ncomputer architecture which is more fault tolerant (Nielsen and Dawson\n2005).\n\nMeasurement-based algorithms fall into two categories. The first is\nteleportation quantum computing (based on an idea of Gottesman and\nChuang (1999), and developed into a computational model by Nielsen\n(2003) and Leung (2004)). The second is the \u201cone way quantum\ncomputer\u201d, known also as the \u201ccluster state\u201d model\n(Raussendorf and Briegel 2002). The interesting feature of these\nmodels is that they are able to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics,\nincluding unitary dynamics, using basic non-unitary measurements. The\nmeasurements are performed on a pool of highly entangled states and\nare adaptive, i.e., each measurement is done in a different basis\nwhich is calculated classically, given the result of earlier\nmeasurements.\n\nExotic models such as these might seem redundant, especially since\nthey have been shown to be polynomially equivalent to the standard\ncircuit model in terms of computational complexity (Raussendorf,\nBrowne, and Briegel 2003). Their merit, however, lies in the\nfoundational lessons they drive home: with these models the separation\nbetween the classical (i.e., the calculation of the next\nmeasurement-basis) and quantum (i.e., measurements on the entangled\nqubits) parts of the computation becomes evident, hence it may be\neasier to pinpoint the quantum resources that are responsible for the\nputative \u201cspeed-up\u201d.\n",
