    "main_text": "Evaluation of Legal Rules and Institutions || The Argument for Welfarism Revisited\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nThough the controversy over economic analysis of law has waned, its\nproject continues to disquiet many scholars who study legal phenomena.\nThe prior discussion identifies two distinct sources for that\ndisquiet.\n\nMany legal scholars object to the normative theory of adjudication\nadvanced by policy analysts. These scholars generally reject the\nwelfarism to which policy analysis is committed. The prior discussion\nsuggests, however, that a rejection of welfarism as a moral theory is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for the rejection of the normative\ntheory of adjudication advanced by policy analysts. Moreover, the core\ncommitments and achievements of economic analysis do not lie in the\nconstruction of a normative theory of adjudication. Rejection of the\neconomic theory of adjudication thus leaves the central elements of\npolicy analysis, political economy, and doctrinal analysis largely\nintact.\n\nThe methodology of economic analysis of law poses a more significant\nchallenge to traditional accounts of law. Economic analysis of law\nprovokes disquiet because the model of self-interested maximization of\npreferences apparently does not admit a concept of normativity but\nexplaining the normativity of law is a central pre-occupation of\nphilosophy of law. The logic of this commitment to self-interested\nmaximization of preferences would appear to lead to a denial of the\nneed for a distinct concept of law in the explanation and evaluation\nof social institutions. As section 4 suggested, this denial of\nnormativity may only be apparent as the methodological resources of\neconomic analysis of law allow for at least some accommodation for the\nincorporation of some normative reasons into the explanation of\nbehavior.\n\nEconomic analysis of law seeks primarily to explain how people behave\nin response to legal rules and institutions. This core project of\neconomic analysis of law complements traditional legal theory with its\nemphasis on the nature of law and its normative claims. Within\neconomic analysis of law, however, lies a more ambitious project that\nwould radically reconstruct the debate over the concept of law (as\nsketched above in section 3.3). It replaces the debate over the\nconcept of law with two related inquiries.\n\nThe first inquiry is explanatory. It requires a concept of governance\nthat facilitates our understanding of how societies resolve problems\nof adaptation, monitoring, application, and sanction. Governance\nregimes include purely coercive regimes as well as regimes with some\nnormative aspect to them. It regards the debate over which of these\nsystems should be called \u201clegal systems\u201d as fruitless and\nuninteresting. \n\nThe second inquiry is normative and treats the term \u201claw\u201d\nas an honorific or a term of commendation that we apply to some\ngovernance structures. The value of legality, of course, is neither\nclear nor uncontroversial. It requires much elaboration. However\nelaborated, this approach treats law as an achievement of governance,\nnot a mode of governance.\n\nThese two conceptual inquiries intersect. An analogy with economics\nmay clarify the intersection. Economics at its core studies resource\nallocation mechanisms. In so doing, economists have identified a\nparticular value, efficiency, that good resource allocation mechanisms\nachieve or manifest. Economists then seek to identify the conditions\nunder which specific resource allocation mechanisms, such as\ncompetitive markets, will realize efficiency. \n\nEconomic analysis of law suggests a similar research project. First,\ncharacterize governance structures. Next, specify the value of\nlegality. Finally, identify the conditions under which specific\ngovernance structures realize the value of legality. This project thus\ntransforms the project of legal theory as currently understood while\nnonetheless leaving past legal theory both comprehensible and fertile.\nTraditional legal theory suggests how we might articulate both the\nconcept of governance and the concept of legality that economic\nanalysis seeks to develop and elaborate.\n",
