However, he thinks\nboth the agnostics and the circular demonstrators are wrong in\nmaintaining that scientific knowledge is only possible by\ndemonstration from premises scientifically known: instead, he claims,\nthere is another form of knowledge possible for the first premises,\nand this provides the starting points for demonstrations.\n\nTo solve this problem, Aristotle needs to do something quite specific.\nIt will not be enough for him to establish that we can have knowledge\nof some propositions without demonstrating them: unless it is\nin turn possible to deduce all the other propositions of a science\nfrom them, we shall not have solved the regress problem. Moreover (and\nobviously), it is no solution to this problem for Aristotle simply to\nassert that we have knowledge without demonstration of some\nappropriate starting points. He does indeed say that it is his\nposition that we have such knowledge (An. Post. I.2,), but he\nowes us an account of why that should be so.\n",
