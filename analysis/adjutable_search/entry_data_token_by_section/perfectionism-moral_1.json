    "main_text": "Perfectionism and Value Theory || Two Versions of Perfectionism\n1.1 Two Versions of Perfectionism\n\n\nPutting nonhumanistic perfectionism aside, perfectionist goods are\ncomponents of an excellent human life. Historically, as noted\nabove, perfectionists have related these goods to the development of\nhuman nature. For example, the development of rationality is\noften considered to be a perfectionist good because it is a capacity\nessential to human nature. Following Aristotle, a number of\ncontemporary writers have sought to develop accounts of the human good\nalong these lines (Hurka 1993, Foot 2003). We can use the term\nhuman nature perfectionism to refer generally to accounts of\nthe human good that relate perfectionist goods to the development of\nhuman nature. Other writers, however, have characterized\nperfectionism without any reference to human nature. John Rawls\ncharacterizes perfectionism as requiring the maximum \u201cachievement\nof human excellence in art, science and culture\u201d (Rawls 1971,\n325). Derek Parfit characterizes perfectionism in terms of the\nachievement or realization of \u201cthe best things in life\u201d\n(Parfit 1986, 162). Here it is the existence of the objective\ngoods, and not their relation to the development of human nature, that\nis highlighted. Similarly, other writers have identified\nperfectionism with the realization of a specified list of objective\ngoods (Finnis 1980, Griffin 1986, Arneson 2000). We can use the\nterm objective goods perfectionism to refer generally to\naccounts of the human good that identify perfectionist goods without\nrelating them to the development of human\n nature.[2]\n\n\nBoth types of perfectionism confront formidable challenges.\nProponents of human nature perfectionism must present an adequate\naccount of human nature. More precisely, they must give a plausible\naccount of the properties that are central to human nature and the\ndevelopment of which explain why certain activities and states are\ngood for human beings (Hurka 1993). Whether there is any account of\nhuman nature that both yields plausible results and has genuine\nexplanatory power can be doubted (Dorsey 2010). By contrast,\nproponents of objective goods perfectionism, having freed the\nidentification of objective goods from dependence on the development\nof human nature, must explain why some things, and not others, are\ncounted as good. Objective goods perfectionists need not formulate an\nexhaustive list of these goods. They may think such an undertaking to\nbe misguided. But they should have something to say about what makes\nan alleged good an objective good, one worthy of pursuit (Sumner 1996,\nSher 1997).\n",
