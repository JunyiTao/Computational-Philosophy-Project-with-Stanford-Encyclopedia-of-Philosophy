    "main_text": "Other Features of Aesthetic Judgments || Aesthetic Truth\n2.1 Aesthetic Truth\n\nThe normativity of aesthetic judgments can be recast in terms\nof a particular conception of aesthetic truth. For some purposes, it\nis useful to do this. It might be thought that deploying the idea of\naesthetic truth commits us to the existence of an aesthetic\nreality. But this springs from the assumption that a strong\ncorrespondence conception of truth is all there ever is to truth in\nany area where we might employ the notion. In many\nareas\u2014scientific and psychological thought, for example\u2014a\nstrong correspondence conception of truth is likely to be in question.\nHowever, the conception of truth applicable in aesthetics might be one\naccording to which truth only implies the sort of normativity\ndescribed above, according to which there are correct and incorrect\njudgments of taste, or at least that some judgments are better than\nothers.\n\nIf we deploy the notion of truth, we might express the normative idea\nby saying if a judgment is true then its opposite is false. Or we\nmight say that the law of non-contradiction applies to aesthetic\njudgments: there are some aesthetic judgments such that they and their\nnegations cannot both be true. This principle need not hold of all\njudgments of taste, so long as it holds of a significant proportion of\nthem.\n\nSuch a normative conception of truth is stronger than a notion of\ntruth which is merely a device for \u201csemantic assent\u201d; that\nis, normative truth is more than thin \u201cdisquotational\u201d\ntruth, according to which the notion of truth is merely a device for\nsemantic ascent. Thus we can say \u201cx is beautiful\u2019 is true\nif and only if x is beautiful. Even judgments of the agreeable, about\nthe niceness of Canary-wine, can have access to an inconsequential\ndisquotational conception of truth. We can say \u201cCanary-wine is\nnice\u2019 is true if and only if Canary-wine is nice\u201d without\nraising the temperature. However, judgments about the niceness of\nCanary-wine do not aspire to a normative conception of truth. There\nare no right and wrong answers to the question of whether Canary-wine\nreally is nice. And so, of neither the judgment that it is nice nor\nthe judgment that it is not nice can it be said that if it is true\nthen its opposite is false. But this is what we do say of some\naesthetic judgments.\n\nHowever, although we can cast aesthetic normativity in terms\nof truth, we need not do so. Aesthetic \u201ctruth\u201d, in fact,\nadds little to the notion of correctness that we have already\nencountered. We can do without the word \u201ctrue\u201d. We can say\nthat something cannot both be beautiful and ugly (in the same respect\nat the same time), and that if something is beautiful then it is not\nugly (in the same respect at the same\n time).[1]\n\n",
