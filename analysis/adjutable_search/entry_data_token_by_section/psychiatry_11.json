    "main_text": "Alternatives to the Medical Model || Introduction\n4.1 Introduction\n\n\nA number of scholars in recent years have argued that existing\npsychiatry is flawed in terms of its philosophy of psychology, even if\none accepts the basic commitments of the medical model rather than a\nmore normative view. On this view, psychiatry has bought into several\nphilosophical mistakes, being unduly reductive or internalist. There\nare longstanding objections to psychiatry along these lines,\nincluding the idea that psychiatric disorders should not be assimilated\nto general medical conditions (Arpaly 2005, Graham 2009). But there are\nspecific criticisms within a broadly naturalistic approach to\nphilosophical psychopathology that we will review here.\n",
