    "main_text": "Machian Positivism || Positivism and the \u201cHole Argument\u201d\n2.3 Positivism and the \u201cHole Argument\u201d\n\nA passage from \u00a73 of Einstein\u2019s first complete exposition\nof the general theory of relativity (1916a) appeared to provide\nfurther grist for the mill of Machian positivism. There Einstein\ngrandly declared that his requirement of general covariance for the\ngravitational field equations (i.e., that they remain unchanged under\narbitrary, but suitably continuous, transformation of the spacetime\ncoordinates), \u201ctakes away from space and time the last remnant\nof physical objectivity\u201d. An accompanying heuristic reflection\non the reasoning behind this claim seemed nothing less than an\nendorsement of Mach\u2019s phenomenalism. \u201cAll our space-time\nverifications\u201d, Einstein wrote, \u201cinvariably amount to a\ndetermination of space-time coincidences\u2026\u201d. This is\nbecause, Einstein presumed, all results of physical measurement\nultimately amount to verifications of such coincidences, such as the\nobservation of the coincidence of the second hand of a clock with a\nmark on its dial, or the point-like mark of a particle made on a\ndetection screen. Observing that such (topological) relations alone\nare preserved under arbitrary coordinate transformation, Einstein\nconcluded that \u201call our physical experience can ultimately be\nreduced to such coincidences\u201d. To Mach\u2019s followers,\nEinstein\u2019s illustrative reflection was nothing less than an\nexplicit avowal of the centerpiece of Mach\u2019s phenomenalist\nepistemology, that sensations (Empfindungen), directly\nexperienced sensory perceptions, alone are real and knowable. Thus\nJosef Petzoldt, a Machian philosopher and editor of the 8th\nedition of Mach\u2019s Mechanics , the first to appear after\nthe general theory of relativity, noted that Einstein\u2019s remarks\nmeant that the theory \u201crests, in the end, on the perception of\nthe coincidence of sensations\u201d and so \u201cis fully in accord\nwith Mach\u2019s world-view, which is best characterized as\nrelativistic positivism\u201d (1921: 516).\n\nHowever, contemporary scholarship has shown that Einstein\u2019s\nremarks here were but elliptical references to an argument (the\nso-called \u201cHole Argument\u201d) that has only fully been\nreconstructed from his private correspondence. Its conclusion is that,\nif a theory is generally covariant, the bare points of the spacetime\nmanifold can have no inherent primitive identity (inherited say, from\nthe manifold\u2019s underlying topology), and so no reality\nindependent of, in particular, the value of the metrical field\nassociated with each point by a particular solution of the Einstein\nfield equations (Stachel 1980; Norton 1984, 1993). Thus for a\ngenerally covariant theory, no physical reality accrues to\n\u201cempty space\u201d in the absence of any physical fields. In\nEinstein\u2019s rhetorical embellishment, general covariance\n\u201ctakes away from space and time the last remnant of physical\nobjectivity\u201d; what he should have said is that spacetime\ncoordinates are nothing more than arbitrary labels or parameters for\nthe identification of physical events [see entry on\n the hole argument].\n Hence this passage is not really an endorsement of positivist\nphenomenalism.\n",
