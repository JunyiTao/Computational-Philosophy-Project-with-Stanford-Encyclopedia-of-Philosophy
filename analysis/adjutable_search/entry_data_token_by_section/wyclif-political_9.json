    "main_text": "Types of Human Dominium || Civil Dominium\n4.3 Tyranny\n\n\nHistory is rich with examples of kings who, wittingly or unwittingly,\nlose sight of their ministerial position and wield secular authority\nin their own interests, cruelly using the land and church for their\nown gain. Such tyrants cause Wyclif some problems, for in many cases\nit is difficult for the subjects to determine whether their lord is\nacting viciously as a crowned brigand, or sternly, as a physician\npurging a patient. For the same reason that Wyclif denies the\nsuitability of popular elections, he is cautious regarding tyranny: it\nis impossible for human minds to gauge the absence of grace in\nanother. What may look like cruel persecution of a subject may in fact\nbe just punishment, while what may appear to be benign, permissive\nrule may in fact be the lassitude of misrule. Certainly no priest is\nin a position to assess the justice of a civil lord, given his\ndedication to apostolic ideals foreign to civil dominium. In\nsome cases, Wyclif advises that one must suffer tyrannical rule as a\ndivine punishment, particularly when a king deprives His subjects of\nmaterial wealth. In other cases, especially when a civil lord fosters\necclesiastical decay by not persecuting heretics or regulating the\nChurch's goods, Wyclif suggests that resistance to tyranny may be\njustifiable: better to focus on the greater danger of priestly\ntyranny; after all, a tyrannical civil lord can only do damage to\none's material well-being, but a tyrannical priest can endanger one's\neternal soul. The guardian against priestly tyranny must be the civil\nlord, whose responsibility to the Church requires him to monitor the\nclergy's execution of its spiritual duties. Those who argue that a\ncivil lord has no business interfering with spiritual concerns\noverlook the fundamental relation holding between just civil law and\ndivine law: because the civil lord's responsibility is to God, his\nfirst concern must be to ensure that nothing will impede obedience to\ndivine law. The canon law that has built up over the centuries like\nbarnacles on a ship's hull is held up as the means by which the Church\nregulates spiritual affairs, but this, Wyclif explains, is a\nsuperfluous creation of priests, ultimately hindering the Church by\nintroducing material structure to what should be a purely spiritual\nenterprise.  \n\n\nThe king uses bishops, an office justly instituted by the early\nchurch, to monitor the spiritual offices of priests to counteract\nproblems like simony, pluralism, absenteeism, and heresy. These\nbishops ought also to act as royal theological advisors, helping the\ncivil lord to understand how Christ's law is best implemented in his\nown legislation. Just as a civil lord is God's steward and a servant\nto his subjects, a bishop is not superior to the laity or the priests,\nbut a steward whose responsibility is to God and the divine law, which\nordains subservience to the grace-favored civil lord. Wyclif continued\nto argue for the centrality of episcopal office throughout his life,\ndespite his own troubles with the Bishop of London and the Archbishop\nof Canterbury.  \n",
