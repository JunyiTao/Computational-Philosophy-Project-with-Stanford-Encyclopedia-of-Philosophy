    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Modern Science and Causal Influence\n1.2 Modern Science and Causal Influence\nThere is an interesting history to modern science\u2019s views\nabout the kinds of things that can produce physical effects (Papineau 2001). It will\nbe worth rehearsing this history in outline, if only to forestall a\ncommon reaction to ontological naturalism. It is sometimes suggested\nthat ontological naturalism rests, not on principled grounds, but on\nsome kind of unargued commitment, some ultimate decision to nail\none\u2019s philosophical colours to the naturalist\nmast.[4] And\nthis diagnosis seems to be supported by the historical contingency of\nontologically naturalist doctrines, and in particular by the fact that they have\nbecome widely popular only in the past few decades. However,\nfamiliarity with the relevant scientific history casts the matter in a\ndifferent light. It turns out that naturalist doctrines, far from\nvarying with ephemeral fashion, are closely responsive to received\nscientific opinion about the range of causes that can have physical\neffects.\nA short version of this history runs like this: (1) the mechanistic\nphysics of the seventeenth century allowed only a very narrow range of\nsuch causes; (2) early Newtonian physics was more liberal, and indeed\ndid not impose any real restrictions on possible causes of physical\neffects; (3) however, the discovery of the conservation of energy in\nthe middle of the nineteenth century limited the range of possible\ncauses once more; (4) moreover, twentieth-century physiological\nresearch has arguably provided evidence for yet further\nrestrictions.\nLet us now rehearse this story more slowly.\n(1) The \u201cmechanical philosophers\u201d of the early\nseventeenth century held that any material body maintains a constant\nvelocity unless acted on, and moreover held that all action is due to\nimpact between one material particle and another. So stated, the\nmechanical philosophy immediately precludes anything except impacting\nmaterial particles from producing physical effects. Leibniz saw this\nclearly, and concluded that it discredited Descartes\u2019\ninteractive dualism, which had a non-material mind influencing the\nphysical world (Woolhouse 1985). (Of course, Leibniz did not therewith\nreject dualism and embrace the physicalist view that minds are\ncomposed of material particles, but instead opted for\n\u201cpre-established harmony\u201d.  Views which avoid ontological\nnaturalistic views of the mind by denying that mental events have any physical\neffects will be discussed further in\nsection 1.6 below.)\n(2) At the end of the seventeenth century Newtonian physics\nreplaced the mechanical philosophy of Descartes and Leibniz. This\nreinstated the possibility of interactive dualism, since it allowed that\ndisembodied forces, as well as impacts, could cause physical\neffects. Newtonian physics was open-ended about the kinds of forces\nthat exist. Early Newtonians posited fundamental mental and vital\nforces alongside magnetic, chemical, cohesive, gravitational and\nimpact forces. Accordingly, they took sui generis mental\naction in the material world to be perfectly consistent with the\nprinciple of physics. Moreover, there is nothing in the original\nprinciples of Newtonian mechanics to stop mental forces arising\nautonomously and spontaneously, in line with common assumptions about\nthe operation of the mind (Papineau 2001: Section 7).\n(3) In the middle of the nineteenth century the conservation of\nkinetic plus potential energy came to be accepted as a basic principle\nof physics (Elkana 1974). In itself this does not rule out fundamental\nmental or vital forces, for there is no reason why such forces should\nnot be \u201cconservative\u201d, operating in such a way as to\ncompensate losses of kinetic energy by gains in potential energy\nand vice versa. (The term \u201cnervous energy\u201d is a\nrelic of the widespread late nineteenth-century assumption that mental\nprocesses store up a species of potential energy that is then released\nas kinetic energy in action.) However, the conservation of energy does imply that any\nsuch special forces must be governed by strict deterministic laws: if\nmental or vital forces arose spontaneously, then there would be\nnothing to ensure that they never led to energy increases.\n(4) During the course of the twentieth century received\nscientific opinion became even more restrictive about possible\ncauses of physical effects, and ruled out any sui generis\nmental or vital causes, even of a law-governed and predictable\nkind. Detailed physiological research, especially into the operation of nerve cells,\ngave no indication of any physical effects that cannot be explained\nin terms of basic physical forces that also occur outside living\nbodies. By the middle of the twentieth century, belief in sui\ngeneris mental or vital forces had become a minority view. This\nled to the widespread acceptance of the doctrine now known as the\n\u201ccausal closure\u201d or the \u201ccausal completeness of\nthe physical\u201d, according to which all physical effects have\nfully physical causes.\n",
