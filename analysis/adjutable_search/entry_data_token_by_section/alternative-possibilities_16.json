    "main_text": "Objections to Frankfurt-Style Cases || The Cases are Too Unusual\n4.1 The Cases are Too Unusual\n\nFSCs are philosophical thought-experiments, often involving science\nfiction and covert figures with mysterious powers and unlikely\nobsessions. The growing literature on FSCs continues this pattern (for\na sampling, see Widerker & McKenna 2003). As the cases get\nincreasingly \u201cstrange and esoteric\u201d (Kane 2007: 168),\nachieving \u201cdizzying degrees of development\u201d (Speak 2002:\n98), we might start to wonder whether we\u2019ve lost sight of the\ngoal, which is to understand concepts originating, not in\nphilosophical fantasy, but in everyday life and ordinary\ncircumstances. However things look in the distant possible worlds of\nFSCs, our natural practices and judgments of moral responsibility\nrequire alternatives.\n\nThis suggestion could play out in a few ways. One is to concede that\nFSCs have refuted PAP, but to insist that the principle\u2014much\nlike Newtonian theory in the domain of physics\u2014is still good\nenough for our ordinary practices of assigning praise and blame (Stump\n1990). Or one might just abandon PAP as formulated but replace it with\na principle explicitly restricted to ordinary, non-Frankfurt\ncases:\n\n\nPAP-ordinary: in ordinary circumstances, a person is\nmorally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done\notherwise.\n\n\nSuch a principle appears Frankfurt-proof, yet is designed to be just\nas useful to assigning praise and blame as the original\n(O\u2019Connor 2005; Glatz 2008; Perry 2010; Whittle 2016). Finally,\none could say that this sort of restriction was part of PAP all along,\nas the principle gets its content from\u2014and is restricted\nto\u2014our ordinary practices. In that case, PAP-ordinary just is\nthe original PAP, so FSCs were never a threat to begin with.\n\nIn reply, a defender of FSCs could note that not all such cases are so\nfar removed from everyday life. There is nothing especially bizarre\nabout Locke\u2019s content prisoner (an early kind of FSC) or\nFrankfurt\u2019s own example of the dormant addiction. And there is\nno fantastic technology or malevolent being in another FSC, the\n\u201cdriver instruction vehicle\u201d with dual controls: Sally\nsteers her car to the right, which the instructor is happy to allow.\nBut \n\n\nif Sally had shown any inclination to cause the car to go in some\nother direction, the instructor would have intervened and caused the\ncar to go to the right (just as it actually goes). (Fischer &\nRavizza 1998: 32; cp. Naylor 1984) \n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting as well that if traditional theism is true,\nand if divine foreknowledge is an FSC (Hunt 2003), then FSCs, far from\nbeing unusual, are commonplace. That said, all of these more\n\u201cordinary\u201d FSCs still violate background assumptions\nusually in place when persons are praised or blamed. Those favoring\nPAP-ordinary could claim that these examples do not fall within the\nprinciple\u2019s scope.\n\nIn any case, there is a more fundamental reply to the general strategy\nof this section: if FSCs, strange as some of them are, are at least\ncoherent, they do point to a conceptual divide between moral\nresponsibility and alternatives. Even if alternatives are needed for\nresponsibility in ordinary circumstances, FSCs, if successful, show\nthat this is a contingent fact. Fallback principles such as\nPAP-ordinary reveal, at best, that alternatives are usually correlated\nwith responsibility, and tell us little about what it is to\nbe responsible. FSCs could thereby serve an important\ntheoretical role in directing attention away from alternatives to what\nmakes someone responsible for their actions (Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 30; Ekstrom 2000: 184\u20135).\n",
