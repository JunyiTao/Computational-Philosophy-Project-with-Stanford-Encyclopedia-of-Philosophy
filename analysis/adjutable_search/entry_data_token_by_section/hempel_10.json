Hempel doesn\u2019t specify the form laws\nmay take, which could be simple or complex. Most of his examples were\nsimple, such as \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d, \u201cAll gold is\nmalleable\u201d, and so on. Others were quantitative, such as\nArchimedes\u2019 principle (A body totally immersed in a\nfluid\u2014a liquid or a gas\u2014experiences an apparent loss in\nweight equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces), Snell\u2019s\nlaw (During refraction of light, the ratio of the sines of the angles\nof incidence and of refraction is a constant equal to the refractive\nindex of the medium), and Newton\u2019s law of gravitation (Any two\nbodies attract each other with a force proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance\nbetween them), which he discussed.\n\nMore complicated examples can be found in standard sources, such as\nThe Feynman Lectures on Physics (Feynman et al.\n1963\u201365), the first volume of which is devoted to mechanics,\nradiation, and heat; the second, to electromagnetism and matter; and\nthe third, to quantum mechanics. Hempel explored the implications of\n (CA-4)\n for laws:\n\n\nThe requirement of truth for laws has the consequence that a given\nempirical statement \\(S\\) can never be definitely\nknown to be a law; for the sentence affirming the truth of \\(S\\)\nis tantamount to \\(S\\) and is\ntherefore capable only of acquiring a more or less high probability,\nor degree of confirmation, relative to the experimental evidence\navailable at any given time (Hempel and Oppenheim 1948: note 22,\nitalics added).\n\n\nHempel considered weakening condition\n (CA-4)\n to one of high confirmation instead of truth, but concluded that it\nwould be awkward to have \u201cadequate explanations\u201d that are\nlater superseded by different \u201cadequate\nexplanations\u201d with the acquisition of additional evidence and\nalternative hypotheses across time. He therefore retained the\ncondition of truth. Whether or not the conditions of explanatory\nadequacy should be relative to an epistemic context of confirmation\nrather than to an ontic context of truth would become an important\nquestion in coping with the requirements for probabilistic\nexplanations.\n\nNo aspect of Hempel\u2019s position generated more controversy than\nthe symmetry thesis, which holds that, for any adequate\nexplanation, had its premises\u2014its initial conditions and\ncovering laws\u2014been taken into account at a suitable prior time,\nthen a deductive prediction of the occurrence of the explanandum event\nwould have been possible, and conversely (Hempel & Oppenheim\n1948). Inferences from adequate explanations to potential predictions\nwere generally accepted, but not the converse. Critics, such as\nMichael Scriven (1962), advanced counter-examples that were based on\ncorrelations or \u201ccommon causes\u201d: the occurrence of a storm\nmight be predicted when cows lie down in their fields, for example,\nyet their behavior does not explain why the storm occurs. Sylvain\nBromberger offered the example of the length of the shadow cast by a\nflagpole, which is sufficient to deduce the height of the flagpole and\nthus satisfies Hempel\u2019s conditions but does not explain why the\nflagpole has that height (Bromberger 1966). Since logical relations\nare non-temporal, Hempel may have taken the symmetry thesis to be a\ntrivial consequence of his account, but deeper issues are involved\nhere.\n",
