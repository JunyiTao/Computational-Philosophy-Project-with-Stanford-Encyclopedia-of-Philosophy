    "main_text": "How to Atone || Apology\n2.1 Apology\n\nAlthough there is some dispute concerning how best to define the\nnotion of apology (N. Smith 2008), many apologies plainly help atone\nfor wrongdoing. Smith presents the notion of a categorical apology,\nwhich he takes to be a regulative ideal (N. Smith 2008; 2014).\nCategorical apologies involve some thirteen features such as accepting\nblame, recognizing the victim as a moral interlocutor, and reforming\none\u2019s\n behavior.[15]\n All thirteen features of categorical apology plainly can atone, as\nthey each can help bridge the rift preventing reconciliation, as well\nas help fulfill moral debts of wrongdoing. Indeed, categorical apology\nis defined to include almost everything that could go into atoning for\na wrong\u2014for Smith, repentance, reparation, accepting punishment,\nand moral reformation all count as part of apology. But Smith\nacknowledges that most of our apologies do not include all thirteen\nfeatures.\n\nHow we define apology ultimately is of little significance to the\nissue of how we can atone. Actions can be carved and catalogued as one\npleases, so long as the actions of atoning significance are included\nsomewhere in the catalogue. In this section I will work with the\nnarrower notion of a genuine apology: one genuinely apologizes for an\naction when one accepts blame for the action, has the standing to\naccept blame for it, feels sorrow and guilt, regards the victim as a\nmoral interlocutor, communicates the apology to the victim, and\nintends to reform and offer redress. This narrower notion is fairly\nwell expressed, surprisingly enough, on a sign often found in Jimmy\nJohn\u2019s sandwich shops: \u201cproper apologies have three parts:\n1. What I did was wrong. 2. I feel badly that I hurt you. 3. How can I\nmake this better?\u201d\n\nBy apologizing, the wrongdoer withdraws the insult made to the victim.\nTheir intention to refrain from the wrong action in the future gives\nthe victim at least some reason to trust them. Both aspects of apology\ncan thus reduce the rift that divides the wrongdoer from the victim\nand bring about reconciliation\u2014at least, moral reconciliation.\nIn addition, the wrongdoer\u2019s feeling of guilt and fear of\nrejection can be a source of relational rift with the victim. The\nwrongdoer can\u2019t bring themselves to face the victim. By\napologizing the wrongdoer breaks down this barrier to reconciliation\nas well (Griffiths 2021: 103).\n\nAlthough apologies may sometimes in themselves suffice to atone and\nbring about reconciliation\u2014when the offense is small, or when\nthe victim already has good reason to think that the wrongdoer is\nrepentant and that the wrongdoer wants what is best for the\nvictim\u2014often more is required to atone. Apologies can be easy to\nfake, and there are a variety of locutions that sound like apologies\nbut in fact are not\u2014e.g., expressions of sympathy, and ambiguous\napologies (N. Smith 2008: 145\u20138). Victims will thus reasonably\nbe expected to accept an apology only where there are clear signs that\nthe apology is genuine, such as if the apology is costly (Ohtsubo\n& Watanabe 2009). This is especially so if the wrongdoer aims to\nreconcile a thicker relationship with the victim, such as a close\nfriendship or a\n marriage.[16]\n\nApology isn\u2019t always necessary for atonement, such as in\nRadzik\u2019s rubber vase case and Bovens\u2019s case of a doctor\nwho secretly gives his patient a treatment intending to kill the\npatient, but by chance the treatment instead cures the patient\u2019s\ndisease (Bovens 2008). If the victim is unaware of the wrongdoing and\napologizing would only bring grief to the victim and a rupture in the\nrelationship between the offender and victim, and no other benefits,\nthen even if there is a pro tanto moral reason to apologize,\nthat reason is overridden by a moral reason not to inflict harm when\nthere are no benefits to doing so. One can atone in other ways in\nthese circumstances.\n",
