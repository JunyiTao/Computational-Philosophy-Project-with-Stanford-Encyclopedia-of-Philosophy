Consider the\nfollowing:\n\n(Setup)\nTwo strangers were chatting on a bus. One told the other he was on\nhis way to a biology lab downtown to pick up his dog. \u201cThe\nscientists there are doing some research on him\u201d, he said.\n\u201cHe was born with no nose\u201d.\n\u201cReally?\u201d said the other. \u201cHow does he\nsmell?\u201d\n(Punchline)\n\u201cAwful\u201d.\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that structure. When we hear the question\n\u201cHow does he smell?\u201d it seems as if it is a serious query,\nan expression of serious curiosity about canine anatomy and its\nmutations. It has the quality of seriousness, of factuality, of\nnon-ironic information. There is nothing funny about that statement.\nBut, when the punch line comes, retrospectively, that set up is funny.\nThat set up is funny because it has been recontextualized by the pun\non the word \u201csmell\u201d, which is made to have more than one\nidentity when put into a new context.\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that it is precisely by\nnot being funny that the setup was funny. In other words, if\nit was already funny, if you didn\u2019t take it seriously for a\nsecond, the contrast between the two different meanings of this thing\ncould never have clashed in the way that is necessary to make the\nlaughter, to make it actually funny. We have a setup which is serious\nand a punch line which is funny, but when you look back at the setup\nfrom the vantage point of having heard the punchline, that setup is\nalso funny. After all, we don\u2019t say that just the punch line is\nfunny. We say the whole joke is funny. The setup is funny in the mode\nof not being funny yet. It is only funny because it wasn\u2019t\nfunny. It is the same thing in the Lotus Sutra and it is the same\nthing in life really. You\u2019re Enlightened! That is what\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism says, everyone is Enlightened! Everybody\nis a Buddha! But the way in which you are a Buddha is the way in which\nthe setup of a joke is funny, i.e., by not being a Buddha. By\nstruggling toward buddhahood, toward something else, but by\nrevisualizing or recontextualizing or expanding awareness, which has\nbeen the preferred technique in Buddhism all along, those very things\nwhich are the details of daily life, of the struggles to interact, to\ndeal with conditions and suffering and lack of control are not just a\nmeans to buddhahood. They are themselves buddhahood as the life of a\nsentient being.\n\nThe \u201cprovisional\u201d, conventional truth, local coherence, is\nthe set-up. The \u201cultimate truth\u201d, Emptiness, global\nincoherence, ontological ambiguity, is the punch line. What is\nimportant here is to preserve both the contrast between the\ntwo and their ultimate identity in sharing the quality of\nhumorousness which belongs to every atom of the joke considered as a\nwhole, once the punch line has been revealed. The setup is serious,\nwhile the punchline is funny. The funniness of the punchline depends\non the seriousness of the setup, and on the contrast and difference\nbetween the two. However, once the punchline has occurred, it is also\nthe case that the setup is, retrospectively, funny. This also means\nthat the original contrast between the two is both preserved and\nannulled: neither funniness nor seriousness means the same thing after\nthe punchline dawns, for their original meanings depended on the\nmutually exclusive nature of their defining contrast. Is the setup\nserious or funny? It is both: it is funny as serious, and\nserious as funny. Is the punchline serious or funny? It is\nboth, but in an interestingly different way. It is obviously funny,\nbut is it also serious? Yes. Why? Because now that the setup has\noccurred, both \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d have a\ndifferent meaning. Originally, we thought that \u201cfunny\u201d\nmeant \u201cwhat I laugh at when I hear it\u201d or something like\nthat, and \u201cserious\u201d meant \u201cwhat gives me non-funny\ninformation\u201d or something similar. But now we see that\n\u201cfunny\u201d can also mean: What I take to be serious, what I\nam not laughing about, what I am earnestly considering, or\ncrying over, or bewailing even.\n\nBut this means also that \u201cserious\u201d means \u201cwhat can\nturn out to be either funny or serious\u201d. So both\n\u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d now both mean\n\u201cfunny-and-serious, what can appear as both funny and\nserious\u201d. Each is now a center that subsumes of the other; they\nare intersubsumptive. As a consequence, the old pragmatic standard of\ntruth is applied more liberally here: all claims, statements and\npositions are true in the sense that all can, if properly\nrecontextualized, lead to liberation\u2014which is to say, to their\nown self-overcoming. Conversely, none will lead to liberation if not\nproperly contextualized.\n",
