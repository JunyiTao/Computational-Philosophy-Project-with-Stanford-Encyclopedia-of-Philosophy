    "main_text": "Neo-Kantianism || Logic and Scientific Methodology\n4.3 Logic and Scientific Methodology\n\nWhen Lange died in 1875, he was working on a revision of the\nHistory of Materialism, and on the first part of a work\ncalled the Logische Studien (Logical Studies).\nHermann Cohen saw the Logische Studien to press and wrote a\nshort introduction. While the argument of the Logische\nStudien remains incomplete, it makes several contributions, some\nahead of their time. Thiel (1994) and Patton (2011) are appreciations\nof the Logische Studien, Wille (2011) is a review of Patton\n(2011). Bellucci (2013) examines accounts of diagrammatic reasoning in\nLange and in Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\nThe first chapter of the Logische Studien situates\nLange\u2019s text in the tradition of wissenschaftliche\nErkenntnistheorie, loosely, scientific epistemology. This tradition\nresponds to the successes of materialism and empirical science\nmentioned above, by focusing on scientific methodology. Johann\nHerbart, a founder of empirical psychology, and Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg, a philosopher and classicist, are particularly\nimportant for Lange (see Patton 2011, Haaparanta 2009). Herbart had\nargued that scientific methodology and inference could be based on\npsychology (Maign\u00e9 2002, Hatfield 1990). Trendelenburg responds\nthat the logic of science should establish how the content of\nscientific theories is proven with certainty, which cannot be\naccomplished within any particular science, but only in an overall\ncritique of scientific thought and methods (Trendelenburg 1862,\n9\u201310).\n\nLange responds to Herbart by arguing that, while the synthesis of\nrepresentations (in Kant\u2019s sense) can be explained\npsychologically, the reasons why that synthesis are necessary and\napply to objects are not reducible to psychology. However, Lange does\nargue that the natural and the normative explanations of necessity are\ncompatible, and that this explains our access to normative\nconclusions. As Ernst Schr\u00f6der points out, \u201cIn striving for\nour goals, we can thus take comfort in the belief that under certain\nknowable conditions the objective necessity that we are searching for\nwill always also become subjective. Namely, if we are talking about\nthe unification of unmediated contradictions, then both formal\nnecessities will always occur together. In this context, F. A. Lange\nremarks very aptly, \u2018The law of non-contradiction is the point\nat which the natural law of thought comes into contact with\nthe normative law\u2019\u201d (Schr\u00f6der (1890),\n11\u201313, citation from Lange (1877), 27\u201328).\n\nLange agrees with Trendelenburg that logic, like epistemology of\nscience, ought to concern itself with an analysis of necessity, which\ninforms Lange\u2019s response to Herbart. However, Lange disagrees\nwith Trendelenburg on the status of logic. Trendelenburg was what\nmight be called a neo-Aristotelian logician. He wrote several works on\nAristotelian logic, especially the logic of the categories. As such,\nTrendelenburg works on what Lange refers to as the \u201ctraditional\nlogic of content\u201d. Lange considers that this has been superseded\nby the new, English \u201clogic of extension,\u201d associated with\nJohn Venn and others.\n\nOne major goal of Lange\u2019s book is thus to show that the formal\ninferences of Aristotelian logic, the syllogistic, can all be captured\nwithin the logic of extension, which might now be called propositional\nlogic. Lange accomplishes this in the next few chapters of the book.\nHe does so by using Euler-Gergonne diagrams, which would now be called\nVenn diagrams\u2014but Lange died before Venn first published the\nVenn diagrams in 1880 (in \u201cOn the Forms of Logical\nProposition\u201d, in the journal Mind). In Symbolic\nLogic, published the following year, Venn remarks:\n\nWhen the substance of this chapter was first written out for\nMind I was unable to ascertain that any attempt had been made\nto reconstruct the syllogistic figures upon this propositional scheme.\nI have since found that almost exactly the same results as are given\nhere had been already obtained by F.A. Lange, in his admirable\nLogische Studien, though from a somewhat different point of\nview (Venn (1881), 17n).\n\n\nAnother major goal of the book is to argue for the notion that all\ncertain or \u201capodictic\u201d (sometimes spelled\n\u201capodeictic\u201d) scientific inference is the same in kind.\nAgain, although Lange does not agree with Herbart that a naturalistic\ndescription of thought can capture the necessity of scientific proofs,\nhe disagrees with the notion that only derivation from a priori\nprinciples yields certain knowledge. The year after Lange\u2019s book\nappeared, J. A. Stewart reviewed the work in Mind,\nsaying:\n\nThe metaphysicians have had it so much their own way since\nAristotle\u2019s time that the mere form of deduction has\ncome to be identified with the apodeictic, however disputed in each\nsystem the principles may be and the conclusions derived from them.\nThe professor of a systematic metaphysic thus elevates himself above\nthe man of science to whom he denies the apodeictic (Stewart 1878,\n112).\n\n\nAs Lange puts it,\n\nAccording to the metaphysicians\u2019 account, Faraday has no\nknowledge of magnetism, Meynert no knowledge of the construction of\nthe brain, Helmholtz\u2019s doctrine of the sensations of tone or his\nphysiological optics are not science, because they are not deduced\nfrom physei proteron, but are built on experiments; maybe, at\nmost, those elements that can be deduced solely and entirely from\nmathematical principles can be called \u201cscience\u201d (Lange\n(1877), 6).\n\n\nLange tries to steer a middle course, between \u201cthe\nmetaphysicians\u2019 account\u201d and the \u201cbare\u201d\nmaterialism he rejects in the History of Materialism. This\nleads him to reject Hegelian idealism (see above), but also to put\ninto question some elements even of the Kantian system. Seventy-four\nyears before the publication of Quine\u2019s \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d, Lange explicitly rejects the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction:\n\nIt is known that Kant took mathematical judgments in general\nto be synthetic, and that to him, mathematics is the primary proof\nthat there are judgments that are synthetic, but at the same time are\nconnected with the consciousness of necessity and thus, as\nKant concluded, are not empirical. This theory was new; but since then\nthe view has been prevalent that even mathematical judgments are\nanalytic and rest on the principle of contradiction. This view finds\nenergetic adherents even to this day, to whom Kant himself essentially\nhanded a weapon in the form of his view of the purely analytic nature\nof formal logic. In fact, it can be proven that the nature of all\nnecessarily valid judgments is essentially one and the same and\nthat it follows from this that they are either all synthetic, or all\nanalytic, or that this distinction in the Kantian, exclusive sense is\nnot correct at all. In fact, the latter is the case (Lange (1877), 9).\n\n\nA recurring theme in the Logische Studien is Lange\u2019s\nbelief in the essential unity of apodictic, certain and necessary,\njudgments. It is for this reason that he does not think the methods of\nscience can be reduced to derivation from metaphysical first\nprinciples, to the inferences of analytic formal logic, or to a\nnaturalist, purely descriptive psychology.\n\nLange\u2019s commitment to the unity of valid inferences even leads\nhim to reject another Kantian distinction, that between thought and\nintuition:\n\nit can be shown, that \u201cintuition\u201d of any object in general\ncannot arise without the cooperation of spontaneity. Conversely, even\nin the most abstract objects there is no thought without intuition\n(Lange 1877, 9).\n\n\nLange\u2019s rejection of two distinctions central to Kantian thought\nare one argument against placing him squarely in any neo-Kantian\ntradition. However, Lange\u2019s work in the Logische\nStudien and in the \u201cStandpoint of the Ideal\u201d chapter\nare difficult to reconcile with a purely empiricist stance either, so\nhe is difficult to place in the philosophical tradition. In addition,\nLange concludes the Logische Studien with an intriguing, but\nsomewhat perplexing, appeal to neo-Platonist thought in explaining his\ntheory of space and time. In general, while it is true that Lange\nproposed rejecting these fundamental Kantian distinctions, there is\nreason to question whether he conceived of a coherent view that\ndispenses with them. For instance, Lange suggests that certain logical\ninferences are based on manipulations of the \u201cformal\u201d\naspects of our representations, but, arguably, Lange does not explain\nhow we are to distinguish formal from material in this context (see\nPatton 2011, 150\u2013151).\n\nThe footnotes and first chapter of the Logische Studien\nreveal the extent to which Lange was engaged in discussions with\nphilosophers in Bonn and in Berlin who were particularly interested in\nthe methodology of science, including Hermann Cohen, Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg, Friedrich \u00dcberweg, and others. These late\nnineteenth century discussions set the stage for the work of more\nwell-known philosophers of science of the early twentieth century.\nLange\u2019s work in this context is a counterpoint to the\nneo-Kantian and materialist traditions.\n",
