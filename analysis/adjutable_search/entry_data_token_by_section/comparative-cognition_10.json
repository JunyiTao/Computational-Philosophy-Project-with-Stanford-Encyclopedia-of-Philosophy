    "main_text": "Methodological Challenges || Anthropomorphism\n3.1 Anthropomorphism\n\nA perennial concern in animal cognition research is whether\nresearchers are being \u201canthropomorphic\u201d. Shettleworth\ndefines anthropomorphism as\n\n\nthe attribution of human qualities to other animals, usually with the\nimplication it is done without sound justification. (Shettleworth\n2010b: 477)\n\n\nThe term \u201chuman qualities\u201d refers to those properties that\nwe readily accept as characteristic of humans. These may include\ncognitive abilities such as future planning, empathizing, insightful\nproblem solving, and reliving past experiences. In comparative\ncognition, researchers may attribute such states to animals based on\nthe available empirical evidence. In our everyday lives, we also often\nattribute human-like states to animals (Serpell 2005). In both cases,\nthere\u2019s a question whether one\u2019s attributions are correct\nor not.\n\nConcerns surrounding anthropomorphism have dramatically influenced the\nmethods and conclusions drawn from animal studies throughout the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries. Behaviorism within animal\ncognition research, for example, can be understood in part as a\nresponse to concerns about anthropomorphism (Wynne 2007). For those\nworried that we are misattributing human-like cognitive states to\nnonhuman animals, one solution is to focus on describing observed\nrelationships between environmental cues and behavior instead.\nAlthough traditional behaviorism is widely rejected today, there are\ncontemporary scholars who hold that behaviorism had something right in\nits unwillingness to anthropomorphize. As Clive Wynne (2004)\nwarns:\n\n\nOld-time behaviourism may have imposed excessive constraints on animal\npsychology. But the reintroduction of anthropomorphism risks bringing\nback the dirty bathwater as we rescue the baby. (2004: 606)\n\n\nShould we be concerned about anthropomorphism in comparative\ncognition? One reason to be concerned is that there are empirical\nstudies showing that humans have the tendency to over-attribute mental\nstates to objects in their environment. For example, in one classic\nstudy, the psychologists Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel (1944)\nshowed human participants a video of three shapes moving in various\ndirections and speeds. Despite the objects being two-dimensional\nshapes, almost all participants described the scene in anthropomorphic\nor human-like terms (e.g., as the shapes \u201cfighting\u201d or\n\u201cchasing\u201d one another). Contemporary studies confirm that\nhumans are quick to attribute mental states to objects and agents\nbased on behavior and other cues (like the presence of eyes) (Fiala,\nArico, & Nichols 2011, 2014; Arico et al. 2011). As Dacey (2017)\nargues, the human tendency to anthropomorphize may serve as a fast and\nfrugal heuristic allowing one to quickly anticipate the behavior of\nother agents. However, if this heuristic activates even when no\npsychological agent is present, then this may lead to numerous false\npositive in animal cognition research. Dacey argues that the best\nmethodological approach is not a general prohibition against the\nattribution of human-like mental states to animals, however, but\nrather the application of methods known to effectively combat implicit\nbias, like making counter-stereotypical information salient. For\nexample, selecting targets that are relatively unlikely to be\nanthropomorphized (such as insects) and asking researchers to imagine\nsuch targets behaving intelligently may help counter intuitive\nanthropomorphism (Dacey 2017: 1158\u20131161).\n\nA second argument in favor of avoiding the attribution of human-like\nmental states to animals highlights that there are competing\nexplanations that can account for the behaviors in\nquestion\u2014explanations that do not appeal to sophisticated\ncognitive abilities. For example, Shettleworth (2010b) discusses the\ncases of animal insight, theory of mind, and mental time travel.\nResearch suggests we find these abilities in animals such as\nchimpanzees and crows. However, Shettleworth argues that we should\nresist this conclusion because there are alternative,\nnon-anthropomorphic, explanations for the behaviors observed in these\nanimals. For example, we can explain the apparent insightful\nproblem-solving behavior found in crows as part of their natural\nbehavioral repertoire or as being driven by cues in the environment.\nAnd we can explain the apparent theory of mind abilities in\nchimpanzees as instead arising from a set of learned and innate rules\nabout what to expect in social situations (see\n section 2).\n Crucially, in addition to arguing that sophisticated mental abilities\nmight not provide the best explanations for animal behavior,\nShettleworth argues that such abilities might also not provide the\nbest explanation for human behavior. She writes that empirical\nresearch\n\n\nincreasingly reveals an unexpected role in human behavior for simple,\nunconscious and sometimes irrational processes shared by other\nanimals. Greater appreciation of such mechanisms in nonhuman species\nwould contribute to a deeper, more truly comparative psychology.\n(Shettleworth 2010b: 477)\n\n\nBuckner (2013) additionally argues that humans have an inflated sense\nof their own cognitive aptitudes; thus, using this sense as a guide\nfor evaluating other animals \u201cloads the deck against animal\nmentality\u201d (2013: 853). He calls this tendency\n\u201canthropofabulation\u201d which combines anthropocentrism (next\nsection) with an exaggerated sense of human intelligence.\n\nSome researchers argue that anthropomorphism has scientific benefits.\nFor example, \u201cheuristic anthropomorphism\u201d holds that we\ncan use our intuitive understanding of humans and animals to generate\nconcrete hypotheses about animal behavior and then test those\nhypotheses empirically (de Waal 1999). In other words, we can use our\nexperience of being human\u2014that is, of being a human\nanimal\u2014to help us generate hypotheses about what it might be\nlike to be another animal, such as a crow or dog. Crucially, however,\nthe idea is not to simply impose a human perspective on other animals,\nbut to take what is known about an animal\u2019s behavior,\nevolutionary history, ecological context, etc. into account. The idea\nis to do this critically; that is, in a conjectural or provisional\nway, which leaves the proposed hypothesis open to testing, revision or\nrejection. As de Waal (1999) writes:\n\n\nWhile we should be reluctant to postulate capacities for which there\nis no evidence anywhere in a species\u2019 behavior, charges of\nanthropomorphism are meaningless without a precise critique of the\nhypotheses under consideration. In a Darwinian framework, there is no\ngood reason to avoid concepts merely because they derive from the\nbehavior of the species to which we belong. Application of these\nconcepts to animals not only enriches the range of hypotheses to be\nconsidered, but it also changes the view of ourselves: the more\nhuman-like we permit animals to become the more animal-like we become\nin the process. (1999: 272).\n\n\nAndrews (2016, 2020) also argues for the importance of human folk\npsychology in comparative cognition research. Folk psychology can be\nbroadly understood as our human commonsense understanding of\npsychological phenomena (see entry on\n folk psychology as a theory).\n Folk psychology is a form of anthropomorphism insofar as it involves\napplying human qualities to other animals. Andrews argues that folk\npsychology is methodologically important for grouping animal behaviors\ntogether into types. For example, in a now classic study, Whiten and\nByrne (1988) collected reports of tactical deception in nonhuman\nprimates. \u201cDeception\u201d is a folk psychological term used to\nindicate the human act of deceiving or tricking another individual.\nHowever, despite its folk-psychological origin, Andrews argues that\nthis term provided a useful starting point for individuating and\ncategorizing behaviors. Such categories were then analyzed, updated,\nand refined based on empirical evidence. Identifying robust behavioral\ntypes in this way is in turn important for investigating the cognitive\nmechanisms responsible for behavior (Andrews 2016a).\n",
