    "main_text": "Hayek Against Justice\n5. Hayek Against Justice\n\nTo Hayek, it matters far more that the law be a framework for\ncoordination than exactly what the coordination points are (Hayek\n1960, 118). Hayek realizes that many coordination points have\ndistributive implications, which leads Hayek to lament our tendency to\nevaluate distributions by asking whether they are just. (Yet, Hayek\nconcedes, at least in principle, the legitimacy of a minimum income or\nwelfare safety net of some sort. See Tebble 2015 for a sympathetic yet\nacute argument that this concession on Hayek\u2019s part is a\n\u201cfatal ambivalence.\u201d In fact, Tebble argues, Hayek\u2019s\nrepudiation of social justice leaves him with no room to make any such\nconcession.) \n\nHayek says, \u201cone of my chief preoccupations for more than 10\nyears\u201d has been coming to terms with the idea that social\njustice is a mirage (Hayek 1978b,\n 57).[8]\n By social justice, Hayek seems to mean distributive justice,\nand more specifically what Nozick called end-state principles of\ndistributive justice, which treat justice as a feature of outcomes\nrather than of procedures.\n\nWhy would justice so conceived be a mirage? Hayek says, \u201cthere\ncan be no distributive justice where no one distributes\u201d (Hayek\n1978b, 58 or 1976, 68\u201369). In Hayek\u2019s words,\n\u201cconsiderations of justice provide no justification for\n\u2018correcting\u2019 the results of the market\u201d (1969, 175).\nSo long as traders are voluntarily making pareto-superior moves, there\nis nothing else that can be said or needs to be said by way of\njustification.\n\nWhy resist applying conceptions of justice and injustice to situations\nwhere no one distributes? What is haunting Hayek here is not the idea\nthat one person might be more deserving than another, but that a\n\u201cmerit czar\u201d might presume to intervene so as to correct\nmarkets that fail to give people what the czar thinks people deserve.\nFearing the potential for tyranny, Hayek argues not that markets are\njust but that they are not the kind of thing that can be just or\nunjust. Where no one distributes, there may be something lamentable\nabout the result, but the result will not be an injustice in the way\nthat engineering such a result would be. Outcomes that would\nhave been unjust  if deliberately imposed (such as being born\nwith a cleft palate) sometimes simply happen. As Rawls says,\n\u201cThe natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it\nunjust that persons are born into society at some particular position.\nThese are simply natural facts.\u201d Hayek would agree.\n\nRawls, however, immediately adds what Hayek would call a non sequitur:\n\u201cWhat is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with\nthese facts\u201d (Rawls, 1971, 102), where resigning ourselves to\nthe facts is the paradigmatically unjust way of dealing with them\n(ibid). If Rawls is right to deem the natural distribution neither\njust nor unjust, then when institutions \u201cdeal with natural\nfacts,\u201d they are, to Hayek, not undoing wrongs. Hayek would\nnever deny that cleft palates are bad or that fixing them is good, but\nwould insist that fixing what is not unjust cannot count as rectifying\ninjustice. If we feel called upon to help children with cleft palates,\nit will be because having a cleft palate is bad, not because having it\nis unjust. When we help, we are not fixing an improper distribution of\ncleft plates. We are simply fixing cleft palates. When we respond to\nthe problem, we take a stand not against injustice but against\nsuffering (Hayek 1976, 87). As Hayek knew, he was profoundly at odds\nwith much thinking about social justice. He expected to be vilified\n(1944, vii), and he was. Although he was as responsive to misfortune\nas anyone, and seemed to embrace the same package of duties to\nchildren as any social justice theorist would, he also saw the free\nworld at a crossroads between a defeasible presumption that normal\nadults have agreed to share each other\u2019s fate (Rawls, 1971, 102) and a\ndefeasible presumption that normal adults have the right and the\nresponsibility to play the cards that nature has dealt. \n\nHayek seems to worry that our sense of justice can make it harder for\nus to live together, and make progress together. To Hayek, if people\ncannot claim that a starting point is unjust, then whatever we do must\nbe justified as an improvement, not as rectification. If\nthere is no injustice needing rectification, then the improvement we\nhave a right to strive for is pareto-improvement, or in any case,\nimprovement by mutually acceptable means. By contrast, if (contra\nRawls) the natural distribution were unjust, that would open the field\nto all of the zero-sum and negative-sum moves that people feel\nwarranted in imposing on each other under the guise of being fair. The\nright to make such moves with other people\u2019s money becomes an\noverwhelmingly lucrative political football, luring a society\u2019s\nentrepreneurial talent into politics, where instead of creating new\nsocial capital, entrepreneurs spend their time inventing clever new\nways of dividing it. (Rawls could note that money being in the\npossession of others does not entail that the money is rightfully\ntheirs, but Hayek is doing social science here. Hayek would not deny\nthe plain fact that people can and often do treat other people\u2019s\npossessions as a political football, and sometimes even invent\ntheories according to which they have a right to do so. Hayek is\ntalking about the actual empirical cost of treating other\npeople\u2019s possessions as a political football, not the\ntheoretical possibility.) \n\nIn Hayek\u2019s mind, we should want a system of justice to be a\nframework that helps us to coordinate on a set of mutual expectations\nthat we each find useful in helping us stay out of each other\u2019s\nway as we each set a course for our individually chosen destinations.\nNo principle of justice would pick our destination for us. Neither\nwould it require us to justify our destination to others. Indeed, the\npremium would be on people not needing to justify themselves. If we\noperated by end-state principles of justice (Nozick 1974), we would\nneed to justify every move that bore on how goods would be distributed\nin the evolving end-state, which is to say we would need to justify\nvirtually every trade we contemplate, which would gridlock us rather\nthan facilitate our inventing new ways of making ourselves more\nvaluable to the people around us.\n\nPerhaps Hayek is overreacting here. In any case, some philosophical\ninterpretation is unavoidable, but this, arguably, accounts for\nHayek\u2019s seemingly dogmatic dismissal of end-state principles of\njustice. For reasons reminiscent of Nozick\u2019s, Hayek finds such\nprinciples unaffordable, and incompatible with autonomous agents\nminding their own business in a free society. Indeed such principles\nmake it impossible to say what could count as minding one\u2019s own\nbusiness. In that respect, in trying to carve out a coherent realm of\nindividual autonomy, Hayek is, as he often claimed, paradigmatically a\nliberal, not conservative.\n",
