    "main_text": "Sortals and the mass-count distinction\n2. Sortals and the mass-count distinction\n\nLinguists have long distinguished between mass and count nouns on\ngrammatical grounds and that distinction is close to the sortal vs\nnon-sortal distinction philosophers deploy. Count nouns form plurals\nand occur in constructions involving \u201cHow many \u2026\u201d\nMass nouns do not pluralize and occur in constructions involving\n\u201cHow much \u2026?\u201d We ask how many cats our friend owns\nand how much cat food. Some words, especially those involving food,\nhave both a mass and a count sense. We can ask both how many chickens\nour friend owns and how much chicken you want for dinner. (See Pelletier (1979, 2010), as well as the entries on the logic and the metaphysics of mass expressions, for detailed discussions on the mass-count distinction, from philosophical, linguistic, and cognitive perspectives.)\n\nThe grammatical distinction is robust. Almost all speakers of a\nlanguage agree on which sentences are grammatical and which are not.\nBut philosophers disagree about the extent to which count nouns match\nup with sortals. The sentences \u201cThere are three red things on\nthe shelf\u201d and \u201cTwo objects collided\u201d are definitely\ngrammatical, so \u201cred thing\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d are\ncount nouns, but most philosophers argue that they are not sortals.\nFor example, Hirsch and Wiggins think not because they claim that you\ncannot count red things or objects, even though the request to do so\nis grammatical. Others think that we can count red things but that the\nonly two possibly correct answers are \u201cinfinitely many\u201d\nand \u201cnone\u201d. If nothing red is present there are no red\nobjects. But if some red thing is present then so are the top half of\nit, and also the bottom half, each of which are counted as a red\nthing, And the three thirds giving us three more red things, and so on\nad infinitum. Whether this is the best understanding of\n\u201cthing\u201d is disputed. We won\u2019t linger over that\ndebate just now, but the issue recurs later when we discuss sortals\nand concept acquisition in children.\n\nThe count-mass distinction tracks closely in most instances with the\nintuitive difference between stuff and things we appealed to at the\nbeginning, but not always. There are some differences in English that\ndon\u2019t seem systematic For example, \u201cvehicle\u201d and\n\u201cvegetable\u201d are count nouns, which makes sense because car\nand carrot are. But fruit and furniture are mass nouns although the\nthings they refer to, apples and chairs, are referred to by more\nspecific count nouns. And languages differ\u2014as mentioned before,\nEnglish speakers count their vegetables, but German speakers ask how\nmuch Gemuse you want, even though\n\u201cGemuse\u201d refers to the same things as\n\u201cvegetable\u201d. And in Italian both\n\u201cfrutta\u201d and \u201cverdura\u201d are\nmass nouns.\n\nA related distinction is the one between counting and measuring. But\nwhile the differences between typical cases of counting\u2014how many\noranges do we have\u2014as opposed to measuring\u2014how much rice\ndo we have\u2014are clear, other cases are perplexing. Salmon (1997)\noffers multiple possible analyses of sentences such as \u201cThere\nare two and a half oranges on the table\u201d, but he finds all of\nthem wanting. \n",
