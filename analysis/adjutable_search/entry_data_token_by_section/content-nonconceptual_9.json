    "main_text": "The autonomy of nonconceptual content\n7. Nonconceptual content: Problems and prospects\n\nIt should be clear from the preceding sections that the basic idea of\nnonconceptual content provides a promising tool for tackling a range\nof problems in the philosophy of mind and cognition. Allowing that a\ncreature\u2019s representational capacities can outstrip its\nconceptual capacities makes it possible for philosophers and cognitive\nscientists to study aspects of cognition and behavior that remain\noutside the scope of more traditional approaches\u2014from\nsubpersonal computational mechanisms to the psychological states of\nnon-human animals and human infants to the nature of perceptual\nexperience.\n\nIt should be recognized, however, that there may well not be a unitary\nnotion of nonconceptual content applicable to these various domains.\nWe need to distinguish between the formal notion of nonconceptual\ncontent (the idea of a way of representing the world that is not\nconstrained by conceptual capacities) and the different concrete\nproposals for developing this basic idea (such as Peacocke\u2019s\nnotion of scenario content). There is potential for serious confusion\nif it is assumed that a specific theory of nonconceptual content\nproposed for one area can be unproblematically applied to another\narea. It may well turn out, for example, that fundamentally different\nnotions of nonconceptual content are required for subpersonal\ncomputational states and perceptual experiences.\n\nIndeed, recent work on nonconceptual content has expanded beyond its\norigins in visual perception to other modalities and even beyond\nperception. Thus, Young (2015, forthcoming), drawing on a broad\nempirical literature, argues that olfactive representations, unlike\nconceptual representations, are not concatenatively compositional. As\nsuch they are best understood as representational but nonconceptual.\nOthers, have moved beyond perception and have argued for a\nnonconceptual account of the contents of emotions (see e.g., Gunther\n2003, Tye 2008, D\u00f6ring 2009, Wringe 2015, Tappolet 2016) and\npossibly other affective-evaluative experiences (Mitchell 2018).\nFinally, Beck (2012) has argued that certain cognitive states with\nanalog magnitude content (primitive representations of spatial,\ntemporal, numerical, and other magnitudes) are best understood as\nnonconceptual, as they do not satisfy Evans\u2019 Generality Constraint,\ndiscussed above (but see replies by Gillett 2014, Grey 2014, and\nBeck\u2019s further replies in his 2014).\n\nWhile the philosophy of perception has been the area where the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction has been most discussed, the\ntheory of nonconceptual content has been fruitfully employed in other\nareas of philosophy. A case in point is the study of\nself-consciousness (see the entry on\n self-consciousness).\n In 1998 two books independently developed theories of nonconceptual\nself-consciousness (Hurley 1998 and Berm\u00fadez 1998).\nBerm\u00fadez and Hurley both emphasized prelinguistic forms of\nself-consciousness, arguing that linguistic self-reference and\nassociated modes of conceptual self-consciousness both emerge from,\nand need to understood in terms of, much more primitive forms of\nself-specifying information. For Berm\u00fadez these include:\n\ninformation in visual and other exteroceptive perceptual\nmodalities specifying the perceiver\u2019s own spatial and kinematic\nproperties\ninformation via affordances that specify the perceiver\u2019s\ncapacities for acting upon the distal environment\ninformation through somatic proprioception, kinesthesia, and\nactive touch about both the disposition of body parts and the limits\nof the bodily self.\nself-locating information about the subject\u2019s changing location\nin objective space exploited in navigation involving cognitive\nmaps\n\n\nSeveral of these forms of nonconceptual self-consciousness have been\ndiscussed more recently by Kristina Musholt (2013, 2015), who argues\nthat though such forms of awareness provide necessarily\nself-specifying information, they should not properly be considered\nmodes of self-conscious, as they contain no explicitly self-referring\ncomponent. Rather than thinking of the self as being part of the\n(explicit) representational contents of perception and proprioception,\nshe argues it should be thought of as being implicit in the mode of\npresentation (Musholt 2015).\n\nChristopher Peacocke\u2019s recent work on consciousness and\nself-consciousness identifies what he terms a \u201cnonconceptual\nparent\u201d of the first-person concept (Peacocke 2014). What he calls\nDegree 1 of subject involvement \u201cis exhibited by a subject who\nenjoys states with nonconceptual content that is objective, and which\nrepresents the subject as standing in spatial relations to other\nobjects and events in the spatial world\u201d (2014, p. 35). Like\nBerm\u00fadez and Hurley, Peacocke sees Gibson\u2019s analysis of\nvision as illuminating a basic form of nonconceptual\nself-consciousness. Unlike them, however, he does not think that\nnonconceptually self-conscious subjects are necessarily embodied.\n\nPrimitive, nonconceptual, forms of self-consciousness are also\ncritical for the acquisition of the first-person concept and for\ngrounding thoughts whose contents have an important property\nintroduced in Shoemaker (1968). This is the property of being immune\nto error through misidentification relative to the first-person\nconcept, defined so that properties attributed in such thoughts must\nbe properties of the thinker, if they are instantiated at all. Cahen\nand Musholt (2017) argue that it is precisely because certain\nrepresentational states with nonconceptual content, e.g., perception\nand proprioception, do not contain an explicitly self-referring (or\nself-identifying) component, but do supply necessarily self-specifying\ninformation that, while such modes of awareness are not themselves\nimmune to error through misidentification, they can serve as the basis\nfor first-personal judgments that are so immune.\n\nFinally, it should be reiterated that the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent is essentially contrastive\u2014and the significance of the\nnotion depends upon the particular way of understanding concepts with\nwhich it is contrasted. Some psychological states that would count as\nnonconceptual for a theorist with a rich and demanding notion of what\nit is to possess a concept would be conceptual for a theorist with a\nmore relaxed view of concepts. Before we can plausibly claim to have a\nfull understanding of the possibilities of the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent, we need to have a much clearer view than we currently have of\nwhat it is to possess a concept. As we saw earlier, on the most\nminimal view of concepts, a thinker can be credited with a concept of\nFs provided that he can discriminate things that are\nF from things that are not F. A richer view of\nconcepts might demand that the thinker have a full appreciation of the\ngrounds on which one might judge something to be an F. The\nmost demanding view of concepts might require the thinker to be able\nto justify and defend the judgment that something is an F.\nClearly, different locations on this broad spectrum will generate\ndifferent ways of thinking about what is to count as nonconceptual\ncontent\u2014as well as different assessments of the overall\nsignificance of the notion.\n",
