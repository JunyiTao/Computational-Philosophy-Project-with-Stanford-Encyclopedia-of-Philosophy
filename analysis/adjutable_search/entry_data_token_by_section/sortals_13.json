    "main_text": "Sortals and Logic || Sortals and standard logic\n8.1 Sortals and standard logic\n\nSome philosophers, perhaps most notably Carnap (1950) have used a\nconcept closely akin to sortals in formulating many-sorted logics.\nThere is a technical point to be explained and a controversy to be\ndiscussed in relation to these.\n\nSometimes in applications of first order logic, i.e., when we are\ndealing at length with a specific class of interpretations the domain\ndivides into intuitively disparate kinds of objects, e.g., people and\nnumbers. In the usual formulation, one has predicates, e.g., Px\nand Nx which are true of those kinds of things respectively,\nand so one translates the English sentence \u201cAll numbers are\nodd\u201d as \\((\\forall x)(Nx \\rightarrow Ox)\\) and \u201cSome\nperson is tall\u201d as \\((\\exists x)(Px \\mathbin{\\&} Tx)\\). In a\nmany-sorted logic distinct variables are used for the different kinds\nof objects, perhaps m, n,\u2026 for numbers and\np, q,\u2026 for people. In this language combinations\nof variables with predicates are sometimes restricted so that\nNm and Tp are well-formed but Np and Tn\nare not. If one does not make this restriction then the notation is\nexactly equivalent to standard first-order logic. A many-sorted\nlanguage is expressively equivalent to a single sorted one which has\nadditional predicates for the various sorts of things (cf. Quine\n1966).\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, one can introduce different\nkinds of variables to reflect any distinction one wants, e.g., there\ncould be distinctive styles of variables for even numbers as opposed\nto odd ones, or for left-handed people as opposed to right-handed.\nHowever, Carnap and others who advocated a many-sorted logic for\nreasons that were more ontological than pragmatic introduced different\nvariables only for what they believed were metaphysically distinct\nkinds of entities, e.g., numbers, physical objects, sense data. In\nthis respect, there is some parallel with ultimate sortals as\ndiscussed above, although Carnap does not make an explicit connection\nwith earlier writers.\n\nA related use of many-sorted logic is to provide a kind of translation\nfrom second-order logic into a first-order logic. In this case instead\nof having second-order quantification over sets (or properties), one\nstays with a first-order language which is supplemented with a\npredicate true of all and only sets (or properties), a distinct style\nof variables for those entities, and with a two-place relation of\neither membership or instantiation.\n",
