    "main_text": "Many-sorted Logic as a Unifying Framework || Translations\n3.1 Translations\n\nCurrently, the proliferation of logical systems used in mathematics,\ncomputer science, philosophy, and linguistics makes the relationships\nbetween and their possible translations into one another a pressing\nissue. We saw above that many-sorted logic is a natural logic for\nreasoning about more than one sort of objects. In this section, we\nwill present it as a unifying framework in which we may situate most\nof the many logics available to us. The general plan of translations\ninto MSL is described with some details. Three possible levels of\ntranslations are settled and, at each level, when successfully\nreached, one completeness result is gained: abstract completeness at\nthe first level, strong completeness at the third. Therefore, when a\nlogic is translated into many-sorted logic we only need a unique\ndeductive calculus, the many-sorted one, as well as an efficient\ntheorem prover. In cases like basic propositional modal\nlogic, where formulas could be translated into a decidable\nfragment of first-order logic with only two variables, the translation\nmechanism implies decidability for the modal logic. Moreover, some\nmetaproperties of many-sorted logic can be transferred to the logic\nbeing translated.\n\nTranslations offer a better understanding of the logics being\ntranslated and could be used to compare two logics when they are\ntransformed into theories of a common target logic, many-sorted\nfirst-order logic in our case. It is not a positive answer to the\nquestion \u201cThe One Right Logic?\u201d (see the entry\n classical logic)\n as this question was not posed and it is not in the spirit of this\ntranslation into many-sorted logic. In Modal Logic for Open\nMinds (van Benthem 2010) translations into first-order logic are\nextensively treated and there is a section entitled \u201cDiscussion:\nwhat good is a translation\u201d (2010: 77) where Johan van Benthem\nanalyzes the balance of expressive power and complexity and advocates\nfor a tandem approach to answer the question Does the translation\nST mean that we can forget the modal language and just do first-order\nlogic?\nTranslations\n\nTranslations between logics have been formulated as an ambitious\nparadigm whose tools would serve for handling the existing\nmultiplicity of logics. Some methodologies are proof-oriented, others\nare model-oriented, and finally some others are conceived in purely\nabstract suprastructural terms.\n\n\n\nFrom a proof-theoretical point of view, the style of\ncomparing logics will rest upon deductive calculi. The \u201clabelled\ndeductive systems\u201d of Dov Gabbay (1994 and 1996) emerge.\n\n\n\nFrom a model-theoretical perspective, one will presumably\ncompare logics by defining relations between the structures those\nlogics are attempting to describe, as in the correspondence theory of\nJohan van Benthem (1983, 1984a, and 2010). \n\n\nFrom a suprastructural point of view, we define morphisms\nbetween categories. Among the abstract approaches to logic we\nhighlight the \u201cgeneral logics\u201d of Jos\u00e9 Meseguer\n(1989) as well as the \u201crewriting logic\u201d of Narciso\nMart\u0131\u0301-Oliet and Jos\u00e9 Meseguer (1994). Da Silva,\nD\u2019Ottaviano, and Sette (1999) gave a general definition of\ntranslation between logics according to which logics are characterized\nas sets with consequence relations; translations are hence\nconsequence-relation preserving maps. \n\n\nThe paradigm of logical\n translation[11]\n assumed in this entry belongs to the model-theoretical tradition\nmentioned in item 2 and the target logic is many-sorted logic.\n\nAs far as intensional logic is concerned, let us quote Johan van\nBenthem:\n\n\nGiven any intensional logic, a complete possible-worlds semantics of\nthe usual variety may be viewed as a faithful embedding of that logic\ninto some suitably augmented many-sorted predicate logic (with\nquantification over possible worlds), perhaps provided with some\nsimple auxiliary special-purpose theory for\n\u201caccessibility\u201d, \u201creversal\u201d, and so on. Is\npredicate logic universal in this respect, in that every effectively\naxiomatized intensional logic can be semanticized in this way? (1984b:\n995)\n\n",
