    "main_text": "Science || Cosmology\n6. Legacy\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s optimism on this score was not necessarily borne\nout in subsequent generations. But among thinkers influenced by\nal-Kindi, one can discern a continuing tendency to harmonize\n\u201cforeign\u201d philosophy with the \u201cindigenous\u201d\ndevelopments of Muslim culture. This is one feature of what might be\ncalled the \u201cKindian tradition,\u201d an intellectual current\nthat runs up through the tenth century, which is most obviously\nrepresented by first and second generation students of\nal-Kindi\u2019s. Particularly prominent among these figures is\nal-\u2018Amiri, a well-known Neoplatonist thinker who was a second\ngeneration student of al-Kindi\u2019s (the link was al-Kindi\u2019s\nstudent Abu Zayd al-Balkhi). Also influenced by al-Kindi were the\nJewish thinker Isaac Israeli (on whom see Altmann and Stern 1958) and\nthe aforementioned tenth century polymath Miskawayh.\n\n\nWhile al-Kindi is only rarely cited by authors writing in Arabic\nlater than the tenth century, he was a significant figure for Latin\nmedieval authors. Most influential were his works on astrology (see\nBurnett 1999); but works like On the Intellect were also\ntranslated, and as noted above there are works in the Kindian corpus\nthat are extant only in Latin. One of these, On Rays, was the\ntarget of a polemic composed by Giles of Rome.\n\n\nTo this we might add that philosophy in the Islamic world was itself\na broader legacy of al-Kindi\u2019s, and this in two respects.\nFirstly, the translations produced in the Kindi circle would become\nstandard philosophical texts for centuries to come \u2013 particularly\ninfluential would be their translations of certain Aristotelian works\n(such as the Metaphysics) and of Plotinus, in the Theology\nof Aristotle. Secondly, though authors like al-Farabi and Averroes\nhardly mention al-Kindi by name (al-Farabi never does so, and Averroes\ndoes so only to criticize his pharmacological theory), they are\ncarrying on his philhellenic project, in which the practice of\nphilosophy is defined by an engagement with Greek philosophical\nworks.\n",
