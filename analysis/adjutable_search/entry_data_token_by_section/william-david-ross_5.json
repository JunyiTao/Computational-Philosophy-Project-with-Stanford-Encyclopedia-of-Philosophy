    "main_text": "Ross\u2019s Distinctive Moral Framework: The Right and the Good || The Good\n4.2 The Good\n\nIn RG, Ross argues four things are intrinsically good (RG 27, 102,\n134\u2013141):\n\nVirtue (or, \u2018virtuous disposition and action, i.e. action,\nor disposition to act, from any one of certain motives [desires], of\nwhich at all events the most notable are the desire to do one\u2019s\nduty, the desire to bring into being something that is good, and the\ndesire to give pleasure or save pain to others\u2019 (RG 134; also\n160);\nKnowledge (or apprehension of fact) and (to a lesser extent) right\nopinion (or correct belief about the ways things are);\nJustice (or happiness apportioned to merit or virtue); and\nPleasure[2].\n\n\nVirtue, knowledge and pleasure are states of mind, while justice is a\nrelation between states of mind (virtue and pleasure) (RG\n 140).[3]\n\nRoss does not think these values are of the same importance. He ranks\nthem. Virtue is ranked highest. It is \u2018superior\u2019 to all\nthe other goods (RG 153). It is, he says, \u2018infinitely\u2019\nbetter than knowledge (understood as a \u2018bare condition of the\nintellect\u2019 (RG 151)), pleasure, and (it seems) justice (RG 150,\n152\u2013154). As noted, there are three virtuous desires. These, too, are\nranked. The desire to do one\u2019s duty is more valuable than the\ndesire to promote what is good (e.g., virtue and knowledge) which is\nmore valuable than the desire to promote others\u2019 pleasure (RG\n164\u2013166). \n\nKnowledge is the next best, followed by right\n opinion.[4]\n Knowledge and right opinion are, for Ross, distinct states:\n\u2018Knowledge is apprehension of fact, and right opinion is not\nthat, but is simply a state of mind in which things are believed\n(not apprehended) to be related as they are in fact\nrelated\u2019 (RG 146). Knowledge is better than right opinion, for\ntwo reasons.\n\nFirst, knowledge involves direct apprehension of facts or the\ninferential apprehension of one fact \u2018as necessitated by other\nfacts\u2019, but right opinion is always partly grounded on\n\u2018the product of other psychical events such as wishes, hopes,\nfears, or the mere association of ideas\u2019 (RG 146). Second,\nknowledge involves certainty which right opinion lacks (RG 30,\n138\u2013139, 147). In addition, \u2018knowledge of general\nprinciples is intellectually more valuable than knowledge of isolated\nmatters of fact\u2019 and the more general the knowledge \u2013 the\nmore it explains or has the potential to explain other facts \u2013\nthe better it is (RG 147; for discussion, see Hurka 2014,\n206\u2013208).\n\nThe least valuable is pleasure (RG 152). It is unclear where exactly\nto place justice in Ross\u2019s hierarchy; he says only that it is\nless valuable than virtue (RG 153\u2013154). It is not implausible to\nthink it should be placed between (virtuous) knowledge and pleasure,\nand therefore the values are ranked as follows: virtue, (virtuous)\nknowledge, justice and pleasure.\n\nIn FE, Ross defends a slightly different view. He appears to maintain\nthere are four non-instrumental values (FE 19, 73, 180, 262, 278,\n288\u2013289):\n\nvirtue;\nintellectual and aesthetic activities;\njustice; and\n(others\u2019) pleasure.\n\n\nIn RG, Ross maintains all non-instrumental values are valuable in the\nsame way: their goodness is intrinsic to them (RG 115, 118, 132; also\nOJ 119; he returns to this position at KT 11\u201312;). In FE, he\nadopts a different stance. The value of virtue and intellectual\nactivities is a \u2018quality intrinsic to them\u2019 (FE 278).\nThese items are \u2018fit objects of admiration\u2019 or objects\n\u2018worthy of admiration\u2019 (FE 282\u2013283). By contrast,\nthe value of justice and pleasure is not intrinsic to them; rather,\ntheir value is based on a relation involving us rightly taking an\ninterest or rightly finding (some kind of) satisfaction in them (FE\n278). The pleasure of others and justice are \u2018worthy objects of\nsatisfaction\u2019 or things in which it is right to take\nsatisfaction or an interest (FE 275, 278, 282, 283, 288\u201389). The\ndifference in the source of value of the things in the two categories\nappears to follow from the fact \u2018while it is self-evident that\nthe only ground on which a thing is worthy of admiration is that it is\ngood in itself, it is not self-evident that the only ground on which a\nthing is worthy of our interest or liking is that it is good in\nitself\u2019 (FE\n 279).[5]\n\nThis distinction between types of non-instrumental value permits Ross\nto explain two things he thinks true of pleasure:\n\nOnly innocent pleasure is good, that is, pleasure not\nundeserved or taken in the misfortune of others or in lust or in\ncruelty (RG 136\u2013137, 151; FE 271\u2013272).\nOnly the innocent pleasure of others is good and hence\nwhy we think we have a duty to promote it and not our own (even\ninnocent) pleasure (FE 74\u201375, 272, 276, 279, 283,\n 322).[6]\n\n\nThe reason only innocent pleasure is valuable is only it is an object\nworthy of satisfaction. For Ross, it is not right to take satisfaction\nin, for instance, undeserved pleasure or pleasure in cruelty or lust.\nThe reason only the pleasure of others is valuable is, again, only in\nit is it right for one to take satisfaction. It is not right, thinks\nRoss, for one to take satisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure.\n\nIn section 4.1 we discussed Ross\u2019s view we have no duty or\nobligation to promote our own pleasure or prevent our own pain. Here\nwe see one reason for this: one\u2019s own pain is not from\none\u2019s own point of view bad and one\u2019s own pleasure is not\nfrom one\u2019s own point of view good. These are not fit objects of\n(dis)satisfaction. Hence, we have no duty to prevent our own pain or\npromote our own\n pleasure.[7]\n\nIn RG, Ross wrestled with whether we have a duty to promote our own\npleasure, noting \u2018while we clearly recognize a duty to produce\npleasure for others, it is by no means so clear that we recognize a\nduty to produce pleasure for ourselves\u2019 (RG 24; also 25\u201326,\n151). Despite his lack of confidence, he affirmed in RG an obligation\nto promote our own happiness under the obligation of beneficence (RG\n25\u201326). However, as we have seen, there are traces of the view we have\nno duty to promote our own pleasure / prevent our own pain even in RG,\nincluding (as noted) in how he construes the duty of non-maleficence\n(e.g., at RG 21, 22, 28) and in his view it is not virtuous to desire\nto give yourself pleasure or save yourself pain (RG 134, 168; cf. Ross\n1928\u201329, 268\u201369).\n\nRoss is often unclear about the value and status of justice. He\nfrequently states there are only three intrinsic goods (FE 19, 180,\n262, 278; KT 11\u201312; OJ 119, 120, 121). In early writings, he\nclaims justice is a duty not a value (OJ 123). In RG, he is unclear,\nsometimes claiming justice is a good (RG 27) and sometimes that it is\na prima facie duty (RG 35). However, in FE he is relatively\nclear justice is good in the same sense the pleasure of others is\ngood, so it seems reasonable to conclude he thinks justice is a\nnon-instrumental good (FE 288\u2013289). He also suggests at one\npoint promise keeping is good in the same way justice and pleasure are\ngood (FE 289). But he more often rejects the claim that promise\nkeeping is good (FE 141, 142), suggesting not all objects worthy of\nsatisfaction are\n valuable.[8]\n\nThere are variety of ways in which to attack Ross\u2019s theory of\nvalue. As in the case of Ross\u2019s list of duties we can ask\nwhether his list should be expanded or contracted. But before we\ndiscuss this it is worth to examine a some of the unique and striking\nfeatures of Ross\u2019s value theory.\n\nRoss says a number of highly interesting things about knowledge,\nincluding about the value of knowledge (RG 148). One thing he says,\nfor example, is knowledge is always more valuable than right opinion.\nHe seems to think knowledge better in part because right opinion\nalways rests on \u2018psychological causes (largely\nirrational)\u2019, e.g., wishes, hopes, and fears (RG 146). Against\nRoss, one might suggest not all right opinion \u2013 e.g., opinion\ncarefully formed on the basis of the best evidence \u2013 necessarily\nrests on such causes (Phillips 2019, 144). Suppose having used the\nbest, most sophisticated polling data I believe with a credence level\nof 84% that a certain politician will win a by-election and she does.\nMy being able to have only probable opinion in this case need not\nresult from some intellectual vice or shortcoming.\n\nRoss might say in reply in the case of right opinion you cannot rule\nout that such causes are operating on your opinion, whereas in the\ncase of knowledge you can, because, on his conception of knowledge,\nwhen you know, you know you know. You have complete conviction (RG\n147). This might make knowledge more valuable. And, he might continue,\neven if you can rule out such causes in the case of right opinion\nright opinion is less valuable than knowledge because it is in some\nway always based on conjecture and merely contingent\nconnections between ideas and so held with some degree of\ndiffidence.\n\nRoss also says, as we noted, some virtuous motives are better than\nothers. We might question whether we really can affirm, for example,\nthe desire to do one\u2019s duty is always better than the desire to\nproduce something good (RG 164\u201365). The desire to do your duty because\nit is your duty seems no more valuable than the desire to promote good\nbecause it is good (Hurka 2003, 213\u201314). Both involve similar kinds of\nattitudes (loving the good and loving the right) and overcoming\nsimilar kinds of obstacles. It is not clear it is better to follow\nwarranted public health measures because you desire to do what you\nought rather than because you desire to promote general good.\n\nRoss\u2019s value theory also includes two very striking claims.\nPerhaps the most striking claim is about the value of virtue. He says\n\u2018no amount of pleasure is equal to any amount of\nvirtue\u2019 (RG 150; italics in original). This means a world with\nsome, very small amount of virtue but great amounts of (surplus) pain\nis better than a world with slightly less virtue (one more venial sin\nhas been committed) but great quantities of (surplus) pleasure. This\nis hard to believe. Surely, the second world is better (Price 1931,\n354; also Hurka 2014, 226; Phillips 2019, 120).\n\nRoss also says in FE that one\u2019s own (innocent) pleasure lacks\nnon-instrumental value from one\u2019s own point of view. He holds\nthis because, as we noted, only the (innocent) pleasure of others is\nsomething in which it is right to take satisfaction. Ross says little\nabout (innocent) pain. But his view seems to be my own (innocent) pain\nis not something in which it is right to take dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, it does not seem like it is wrong to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s own pain. It seems right to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s wretched childhood (if one has had one) and to take\ndissatisfaction in the fact one\u2019s future is likely to be painful\n(after, say, a terminal cancer diagnosis). It is not clear, contra\nRoss, we could not follow these judgements with \u2018moral\nsafety\u2019 (FE 288). It might be harder to think it right to take\nsatisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure. But, still, it does not seem\nwrong to take satisfaction in a joyous childhood (if one has had one)\nand to take satisfaction in the fact that one\u2019s future appears\nlikely to be enjoyable (see also Shaver 2014, 312).\n\nFurthermore, Broad rightly says we \u2018certainly condemn morally a\nperson who acts highly imprudently, i.e. one who unreasonably\ndiscounts his own probably future pleasures and unpleasures in\ncomparison with those which are immediately within his reach\u2019\n(Broad 1971, 274\u201375; also Butler 1736, 137\u2013138; Price 1787, 153). One\nplausible explanation of this is that one\u2019s own pleasure (pain)\nis non-instrumentally good (bad).\n\nRoss\u2019s worry seems to be that it is odd to say it would be\nmorally right to take satisfaction in one\u2019s own\npleasure and morally right to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s own pain (FE 322; also 324, 282, 288; RG 151). Perhaps the\nright reply, then, is to say that there is reason to take\nsatisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure and reason to take\ndissatisfaction in one\u2019s own pain.\n\nIn general, Ross\u2019s value theory is too rigid. One of the\nattractive features of his theory of prima facie duties is\nits flexibility and its lack of a rigid hierarchy amongst the duties.\nIt is always possible for any one duty to outweigh any other. Ross\nwould do well to inject some of this flexibility into his value\ntheory, thinking it is always possible for one value to outweigh any\nother in some context. This seems a better fit with what\n\u2018we\u2019 think on reflection.\n\nIn the last section we explored some attempts by ideal utilitarians to\nshow there are fewer duties than Ross allows. Some ideal utilitarians\ntake the opposite position with respect to his list of values. They\nthink it should be expanded or (at any rate) modified. They think a\nplausible list would incorporate the values of keeping promises,\nexpressing gratitude and compensating for past wrongs. The idea is\nthat acts of this sort have value. They think this will help capture\nour intuitions about the ethical importance of promise keeping,\ngratitude and reparation while retaining the idea it is never right to\ndo less than the (impartial) best. Grappling with this puts us in a\nposition us to assess the second ideal utilitarian reply to\nRoss\u2019s objections mentioned in the last section.\n\nRecall again one of Ross\u2019s examples to suggest ideal\nutilitarianism cannot make sense of the obligation to keep one\u2019s\npromises:\n\n\nA is dying. He entrusts his property to B, on the\nstrength of B\u2019s promise to give it to C.\nC does not know of A\u2019s intentions or\nB\u2019s promise. B\u2019s activities will not\ndisappoint A or C, nor will his activities\nnegatively impact the general mutual confidence. Suppose D\ncould make better use of the property than C. It follows on\nideal utilitarianism B ought to give the property to\nD.\n\n\nRoss thinks this breach of trust \u2018outrageous\u2019 (FE\n105).\n\nIn reply, some ideal utilitarians contend they can agree in this case\nthe promise ought to be kept by adding a value to Ross\u2019s list\nand say (the act of) promise keeping is non-instrumentally valuable\n(or at least that promise breaking is evil). The most plausible form\nof this argument states Ross must accept promise keeping is valuable\nbecause he accepts knowledge and justice are valuable and there is no\nreal difference between these values and the value of keeping promises\nor the disvalue of breaking promises (Shaver 2011, 130ff.).\n\nThe characterisation of Ross\u2019s value theory in this section\nprovides him with a potential defence. He seems to insist on many\noccasions only states of mind or relations between states of mind have\nnon-instrumental value. Promise keeping, reparation, and gratitude are\nnot merely states of mind or relations between states of mind.\nTherefore, they are not non-instrumentally good.\n\nOne worry with this reply is knowledge is not merely a state of mind.\nIt involves relations to what grounds it. In RG, Ross insists\nknowledge has intrinsic value. He sometimes suggests this in FE.\nHowever, his considered seems to be that it is not knowledge but\nintellectual and aesthetic activities that have value (FE 19, 27, 73,\n180, 262, 266, 267, 270, 278, 282\u2013283, 284, 290, 296; also OJ\n119, 120, 121; KT 11\u201312). And these, we might think, are states of\nmind.\n\nThis reply might cause Ross problems. If he says knowledge is not\nintrinsically valuable but intellectual activities are, he cannot say\nan activity of the mind is better when it issues in knowledge (FE 270;\nShaver 2011, 134n34). Perhaps Ross will have to say intellectual\nactivities leading to knowledge are better, not because knowledge is\nitself good, but because of its instrumental properties, e.g.,\nknowledge might lead us to being most effective at promoting justice\nor virtue or pleasure. A fortiori the claim it is\nintellectual activities that are intrinsically good explains why some\ninstances of knowledge are more important than others. Ross says\n\u2018different instances of this [intellectual] activity are good in\nproportion as they are conducted according to these principles\u2019\n(FE 270; also RG 151\u2013152), i.e., principles discovered by logic.\nBecause, say, more philosophical or more general knowledge requires\ngreater and more sophisticated use of \u2018the principles discovered\nby logic\u2019 (FE 270), it is better than knowledge of the sex lives\nof movie stars. The value of the intellectual activities explains the\nvalue of the knowledge.\n\nBut what about the fact that justice is an intrinsic value? It is not\na state of consciousness; it is a relation between states of\nconsciousness (RG 140). If Ross is willing to accept justice as a\ngood, why not accept (the act of) promise keeping, and so on, are\ngood? Ross might insist justice is different from promise keeping,\nreparation, and gratitude because it is compounded from states of\nconsciousness and that is why it and not these other things are good.\nHowever, perhaps the better reply is to stop treating justice as a\nvalue. He repeatedly contends it is only states of mind that have\nvalue (OJ 118; RG 122, 106\u2013107, 140; FE 259, 270; KT 21), and\njustice is not a state of mind. He can insist only states of mind have\nvalue and block the ideal utilitarian response. Ross is open to\ncharacterising justice as a requirement of duty rather than a value\n(FE 319), and he losses little by not listing it as a value. Further,\nit might be more acceptable and capture more of what we think about\njustice to construe justice (in his sense and others) as a\n duty.[9] \nMany think justice constrains what we are permitted to do to\npromote general good and Ross sometimes agrees (FE 71).\n\nIt is, of course, open to a critic to argue there is little reason to\nthink that only states of mind have value. Ross does little to defend\nthe view. Indeed, he might be forced to reconsider whether only states\nof consciousness possess value once he is confronted with the idea\nthat achievement is among the things we seem to value, where this\ninvolves \u2018having a goal for how the world should be and then\nrealizing it\u2019 (Hurka 2014, 209). Achievement involves\ninteracting with and affecting the world, including doing things like\nwriting a book, raising a child to adulthood and building a muscular\nphysique.\n\nRoss relies quite heavily on the Moorean isolation method to defend\nhis value theory (Moore 1903, 93, 95\u201396, 187\u201388). You figure out\nwhether something is non-instrumentally valuable by considering it by\nitself or in isolation (KT 10, 11). His value theory came under much\nless scrutiny than did his theory of right, and therefore he did not\nsee fit to consider monistic responses to it. This may in part be\nbecause there is agreement amongst his main rivals\u2014Moore,\nRashdall, Pickard-Cambridge, Ewing, and Johnson\u2014that value\npluralism is true. This may also be because he considered the main\nmonistic rival\u2014that is, hedonism\u2014a dead end (RG 98; FE\n65). But hedonism lives on (Bradley 2009; Crisp 2006; de Lazari-Radek\nand Singer 2014; Feldman 2004; Hewitt 2010; Mendola 2006). Therefore,\nRoss\u2019s value theory may be in for a challenge neither he nor his\nideal utilitarian critics anticipated.\n\nTo get a taste of what this challenge may look like consider the\nfollowing hedonistic reply to Ross\u2019s argument for the idea\nvirtue is intrinsically valuable. Hedonists hold pace Ross\nthat while it is obvious virtue is instrumentally good and vice is\ninstrumentally bad, it is far from clear the former is intrinsically\ngood and the latter is intrinsically bad (Sidgwick 1907: 400ff.). In\nresponse, Ross asks us to imagine two worlds, W1\nand W2. W1 and\nW2 include the same quantity of pleasure. However,\nW1 contains agents that are virtuous, who act from\nor who are disposed to act from the right motives, while\nW2 contains agents who are vicious, who act from\nor who are disposed to act from the wrong motives. Is not\nW1 preferable to W2? Ross\nthinks it is, and he says what explains this is virtue is\nintrinsically good (RG 134).\n\nBut the hedonist has a reply. The situation envisaged is implausible,\nfor surely W1 would have more pleasure than\nW2 because typically virtuous people produce more\npleasure than vicious people. Indeed, would not a world with virtuous\npeople be more likely to continue to be filled with pleasure and lack\nthe possibility of descending into chaos than a world with vicious\npeople? Is not this ultimately the reason why we desire or prefer\nit?\n\nIn response, Ross reminds us not all pleasure springs from the actions\nof virtuous people and not all pain springs from actions of vicious\n(RG 134). Some results from \u2018the operation of natural\nlaws\u2019 (RG 134). Suppose, then, there are two worlds,\nW1 and W2.\nW1 contains virtuous people and\nW2 contains vicious people, and the two worlds\ncontain equal amounts of pleasure, because although\nW1-type worlds usually contain more pleasure than\nW2-type worlds, W1\u2019s\nextra virtue-generated pleasure is offset by \u2018a much greater\nincidence of disease\u2019, making the worlds equal in pleasure. Ross\ncontends it is still the case the virtuous world,\nW1, is better than W2.\n\nThis is a good response. The hedonist may have a rejoinder. Would not\nW1 be on the whole better (hedonistically\nspeaking) in the long run because of the virtuous people? Would not\nW1 be a place where it is more likely to be the\ncase a cure is found or where it is more likely pain is treated\neffectively and sympathetically or where it is more likely to remain\nstable enough to handle the disease and illness? Ross may rely on\nstrategies similar to the ones he adopts against the ideal\nutilitarian\u2019s attempt to show she can explain the importance of\npromise keeping (RG 38). But it is clear proponents of Ross\u2019s\nview of value may well have to contend with arguments of this variety\ngiven the recent resurgence of hedonism. They may have to contend more\nspecifically with hedonistic replies questioning the reliability of\nthe intuitions to which Ross appeal in his attempt to argue for value\npluralism.\n",
