    "main_text": "Is Hyperintensionality Real? || The Indispensability of Hyperintensions\n2.2 The Indispensability of Hyperintensions\n\nTalk of belief, desire, and meaning is prima facie\nhyperintensional, as discussed above. But perhaps this appearance\ncould be resisted. One strategy is to employ use/mention distinctions\nin novel ways. Instead of hyperintensional operations on propositions\nor other meanings, we can treat apparently hyperintensional language\nas expressing properties of or relations between sentences or other\npieces of language. If we do this systematically, a theory can do away\nwith merely intensional distinctions.\n\nQuine (1953) suggests that modal operators, when we need them at all,\nare best interpreted as predicates of sentences. Quine (1956) and\nDavidson (1968) suggest an approach to propositional attitude\nascriptions as implicitly talking about connections between people and\nsentences: \u201cJohn believes that it is raining\u201d is\nregimented as a two-place predicate holding between John and the\nsentence \u201cIt is raining\u201d. For Davidson, this in effect\nasserts that John stands in a certain relation to a sentence that\nstands in the same-saying relation to the sentence \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d. This supposedly accommodates how non-English speakers\ncan believe that it is raining. Reconstruing mental attitude reports\nas reporting relations to sentences has fallen out of favor in\ncontemporary philosophy, for reasons largely orthogonal to\nintensionality or hyperintensionality: see Propositional Attitude\nAscriptions, section 7. Still, with enough ingenuity techniques like\nQuine\u2019s and Davidson\u2019s could be extended to apparently\nhyperintensional pieces of language.\n\nSome philosophers who reject extensionalism nevertheless offer\ntechniques for avoiding treating beliefs and desires as\nhyperintensional. Stalnaker (1984) tries to rescue the SPWS analysis\nof propositional content by explaining away hyperintensional\nintuitions via a sort of metalinguistic approach: when we fail to see\nthat a proposition is necessarily true, or that two propositions are\nnecessarily equivalent, we are actually failing to see what\npropositions are expressed by certain sentences. Given sentence \\(A\\),\none should distinguish (1) the proposition \\(P\\) expressed by \\(A\\)\n(in a context), and (2) the proposition \\(P\\)* that A\nexpresses \\(P\\), relating the sentence to what it expresses.\nIgnorance of necessary truths or equivalences is ignorance about\nP*.\n\nStalnaker maintains that whenever one fails to know or believe a necessary truth, \\(A\\),\none actually fails to fully grasp the sentence \\(A\\)\u2019s meaning:\none doesn\u2019t realize that \\(A\\) expresses the total set of\nworlds. Stalnaker points at the occasional distance between the\nsyntactic structure of the relevant \\(A\\), which can be quite complex,\nand the expressed proposition\u2014in SPWS, an unstructured entity (a\nset):\n\n\nWhenever the structure of sentences is complicated, there will be a\nnontrivial question about the relation between sentences and the\npropositions they express, and so there will be room for reasonable\ndoubt about what proposition is expressed by a given sentence.\n(Stalnaker 1984: 84)\n\n\nFor Stalnaker\u2019s story to work in general, all cases of ignorance\nof necessary truths or equivalences must be instances of meaning\nignorance. This is difficult to believe. A mathematician who wonders\nwhether Goldbach\u2019s conjecture is true can hardly be described as\nmistaken about what \u201cEvery even integer larger than two is the\nsum of two primes\u201d means. They know the meanings of all\nconstituents of the sentence\u2014they have mastered the\nelementary-school-math concepts even integer, larger\nthan, two, sum, prime number as much\nas any of us. As competent speakers of English, they understand how\nthe syntax of the sentence makes its constituents conjure for it to\nexpress the content it expresses. What they have doubts about is\nwhether that content is true. We sometimes seem to fully grasp the\ncontents of sentences whose status of necessary truths, or falsities,\nwe are ignorant of.\n\nLewis (1982) proposes a fragmentation strategy to explain away\napparent failures of logical omniscience, in particular, apparent\nbelief in inconsistencies which is not, however, belief in everything.\nOne\u2019s epistemic state may be split into different \u201cframes\nof mind\u201d. One may believe \\(A\\) in one mind frame, \\({\\sim}A\\)\nin another one, but fail to put them together:\n\n\nI used to think that Nassau Street ran roughly east-west; that the\nrailroad nearby ran roughly north-south; and that the two were roughly\nparallel. [\u2026] So each sentence in an inconsistent triple was\ntrue according to my beliefs, but not everything was true according to\nmy beliefs. [\u2026] My system of beliefs was broken into\n(overlapping) fragments. Different fragments came into action in\ndifferent situations, and the whole system of beliefs never manifested\nitself all at once. [\u2026] The inconsistent conjunction of all\nthree did not belong to, was in no way implied by, and was not true\naccording to, any one fragment. That is why it was not true according\nto my system of beliefs taken as a whole. (Lewis 1982: 436)\n\n\nEach fragment can be given the SPWS treatment, while trans-fragmental\ninconsistencies do not trivialize the belief system.\n\nThe account, just like Stalnaker\u2019s, doesn\u2019t seem to\ngeneralize. It seems strange to say that when agents don\u2019t\nfollow through the logical consequences of what they believe,\nit\u2019s always because they haven\u2019t conjoined the premises\nwhereas, when they do, they suddenly come to believe all the\ninfinitely many consequences (Jago 2014). It\u2019s sometimes an easy\nlogical step from \\(A_1, A_2, A_3\\), to \\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\).\nWhat is often difficult is to see whether a remote \\(B\\) follows from\n\\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\).\n\nEven if Lewis and Stalnaker can explain away the apparent\nhyperintensionality of belief, these attempts to not extend in any\nstraightforward way to all prima facie cases of\nhyperintensionality. Stalnaker, at least, seems committed to a project\nof explaining away many apparent cases of hyperintensionality,\ncommitted as he is to a SPWS account of linguistic meaning and mental\ncontent (Stalnaker 1984). So far as we can tell, Stalnaker is willing\nto take this project piece-meal.\n\nLewis seems more hospitable to hyperintensional approaches, provided\nthey can be ultimately explained in terms of possible worlds and\nset-theoretic constructions out of them. In Lewis (1986: 49\u201350),\nhe discusses a hyperintensional \u201ctrivially\u201d operator that\nwould apply differently to different necessary truths. In a\nposthumously published letter (Lewis 2004) he seems to acknowledge\nthat there was more than one distinct impossible fiction, and\npresumably that \u201cAccording to fiction \\(f, A\\)\u201d was\nhyperintensional (since when \\(f\\) is an impossible fiction, there\nwill be some impossible claim that is true according to it, but in\ngeneral not all impossible claims will be).\n\nPhilosophers suspicious of hyperintensionality in particular areas\nshould consider if this stems from features of the specific case or is\ngeneral. If the latter, they may wish to attempt a general account of\nmeaning that ensures we never need to acknowledge hyperintensionality:\notherwise, a general suspicion will risk being undermined.\n",
