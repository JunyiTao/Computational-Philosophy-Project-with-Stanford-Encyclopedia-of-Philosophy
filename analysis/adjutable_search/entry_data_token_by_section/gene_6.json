    "main_text": "Philosophical Accounts of Scientific Change in Genetics || Conceptual change and the gene concept\n2.2 Conceptual change and the gene concept\n\nAbout the time when philosophers of science turned to biology, a new\ntheory of meaning was widely discussed\u2014the causal theory of\nreference (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975; see entries on\n reference\n and\n natural kinds).\n Proponents of this view turned against earlier theories of reference,\nwhich they took to hold that the reference of a token (an instance of\na term\u2019s use) is fixed by a description of the referent the\nspeaker has in mind and that represents the term\u2019s meaning.\nInstead, according to the new theory, a natural kind term, and\nespecially a scientific term, is connected to a kind of entity when it\nis used for the first time to refer to an instance as belonging to a\ncertain natural kind by an ostensive gesture or an equivalent.\nSpeakers might then use a scientific term to refer to a natural kind,\neven if they are not able to identify a member of the kind in question\nor have false beliefs about this kind of entity. They rely on the fact\nthat there are experts in their broader linguistic community who can\nidentify members of the kind in question in the way it was initially\nintroduced, and who stand in a suitable causal relation with the event\nof the original naming of the kind through a series of communicative\nlinks. The initial identification of a kind might have been based on\nrecognizing some salient shared properties (\u201cnominal\nessence\u201d in Locke\u2019s terms;\n Locke on real essences).\n However, if the introduction of the term has indeed successfully\nidentified a natural kind, then, eventually, the \u201creal\nessence\u201d of the kind will be identified, presumably in form of\nthe physical microstructure, which explains the initially recognized\nproperties. The latter still play a role in characterizing a\nstereotype for non-expert speakers, but based on the underlying causal\nproperties experts can determine kind membership unequivocally in\nevery case (Putnam 1975).\n\nBased on such a view, the dependence of the reference of theoretical\nterms in science on a description or on its relation to a currently\naccepted theory can be avoided. This is what made causal theories of\nreference attractive to philosophers of biology, who saw continuity in\nthe use of the term \u201cgene\u201d despite significant theoretical\nshifts in genetics during the twentieth century. This view suggests\nthe following narrative regarding the events presented in Part 1:\nMendel had identified a natural kind when he identified gametic\nelements involved in the inheritance of characters. Early Mendelians\nused a variety of terms but referred to the same entity when\nperforming hybridization experiments. Later the units were named\n\u201cgenes\u201d but the communicative chain connecting earlier and\nlater uses of the terms referring to entities belonging to the natural\nkind remained intact. And even if the meaning of the concept changed,\ni.e., various properties shared by the members of the kind were\nsuggested or dropped from the list of necessary and sufficient\ncriteria, eventually, a molecular characterization of genes was\nachieved, which explained the most stable observed properties (or\ntheir variation under varying conditions) and was since available for\nexpert geneticists to determine whether something was a gene or not.\nMuch of the debate sketched in the following can be described as\ndiscussing to what extent this narrative is adequate.\n\nKitcher takes causal theories of reference as his starting point to\ndiscuss conceptual change in the case of the gene concept (1982). He\nintroduces the notion of reference potential of a term type, which on\nhis account comprises several ways in which the reference of a token\nis fixed. On the one hand, there are several modes of reference and\nthey are correlated with the intention of the speakers. Sometimes a\nspeaker might value clarity and hence provide a description that fixes\nthe reference of a term in the sense of descriptivist theories of\nreference. Indeed, researchers or teachers often provide definitions\nof the term \u201cgene\u201d. The description might turn out to be\nwrong, however, and hence the term might fail to refer, but at least\nthe speaker made it transparent in which sense the term is used. In\nother situations, a speaker might want to conform to the established\nuse of a term in a community. In this case the reference is fixed in\nthe way suggested by causal theories of reference; in using the term\nthe speaker relies on the existence of experts in the broader language\ncommunity, who know how the term is applied correctly (i.e., how a\nmember of the natural kind is identified). These experts are causally\nconnected to the initial event of the term\u2019s introduction. This\nis the way most people use the term \u201cgene\u201d. Finally,\nspeakers might refer to an entity in a situation where they are in\ndirect causal interaction with it. This might be the case when\nresearchers refer to genes in research articles reporting experiments\ninvolving genes.\n \nOn the other hand, and this is what expands the reference potential of\na concept, there are various descriptions available, which speakers\nmight use to fix the reference of the term\n\u201cgene\u201d. Furthermore, there are several causal trajectories\nby which various groups of experts are connected to situations where\nthe term was introduced by something akin to ostension. Finally, there\nare always new situations in which researchers refer by ostension in\ndirect interaction with genes, possibly based on new kinds of\nexperiments. Conceptual change for Kitcher is thus constituted by\nchanges in the reference potential of a concept, in this case, in the\nways tokens of the term \u201cgene\u201d refer to genes (if they\nrefer at all).\n\nWhen applying theories of reference, philosophers typically commit to\nrealism of some form. This means that they assume that there are\nnatural kinds and that a concept, when it refers successfully, picks\nout some natural kind. When dealing with complex matters such as the\nphenomena of heredity, there are certainly several natural kinds to be\nidentified. Hence, according to Kitcher, not only the reference\npotential of a concept changes, but also the reference of the concept\nitself. Earlier as well as later uses of the term \u201cgene\u201d\nmight have referred successfully, but the extensions of the term in\nearlier and later instances might nonetheless have been different.\nMendelians might have picked out the natural kind of, say, chromosomal\nelements that are potential difference makers with respect to\nheritable phenotypic variation when using the term. This kind\ncomprises protein-coding DNA sequences and some non-coding regions.\nMolecular geneticists might have picked out another natural kind, say,\ntemplate for functional molecules, which did not include some of the\nelements referred to as genes by Mendelians, but protein-coding DNA\nsequences as well as sequences coding for functional RNA. While this\nopens the door to a form of pluralism regarding genes as natural\nkinds, Kitcher connects his account to a notion of progress. He\nmaintains that the reference potential of the gene concept improved.\nDescriptions that failed to fix reference were rejected and causal\ntrajectories going back to the ostensive introduction of a term that\nturned out to have failed to pick out a natural kind or picked a\nnatural kind no longer held to be significant are cut. In\nKitcher\u2019s view molecular genetics refined the concept of the\ngene. The notions of failure of reference and improvement of the\nreference potential are of course dependent on the status of molecular\nbiological knowledge at a given time, which provides the baseline for\nthe evaluation of concepts (Weber 2005: Ch. 7; for developments since\nKitcher\u2019s writing, see\n \u00a71.5).\n\nRichard Burian (1985), like Kitcher, is concerned with the facts that\ntheoretical terms can pick out natural kinds even when a theory turns\nout to be mistaken and that researchers who disagree in their theories\ncan use a concept that refers to the same natural kind. Burian\nillustrates these points with the case of Bateson, who held\ntheoretical views that are now seen as false (e.g., regarding the\npresence/absence hypothesis, see\n \u00a71.1),\n but who is still taken to have referred successfully to genes on most\noccasions where he used the term or synonyms. Furthermore, Bateson was\nable to discuss the chromosome theory held by the Morgan group (see\n \u00a71.2),\n despite rejecting it. This only makes sense if it is assumed that\ndespite disagreement, both parties used the term \u201cgene\u201d to\nrefer to the same natural kind. Burian aims at a hybrid account\ncombining extensionalist views based on causal theories of reference\nand intensionalist views relying on the notion of theoretical\ndescriptions. Theoretical differences among accounts put forward by\nvarious groups simultaneously or across time can thus be bridged by a\ngene concept exhibiting \u201creferential openness\u201d achieved by\nindefinite, rather schematic descriptions that are not committed to\nthe material nature of genes but nonetheless characterize them through\ntheir causal effects and in that sense operationalize the concept.\nWhile such concepts facilitate continuity in scientific change, any\ngiven research project will operate with a specification of the\ndescription that provides criteria to individuate genes and that\nrelies on a mix of functional and structural characterizations. How\ngenes are identified depends among other things on how and on what\nlevel the phenotype is determined (e.g., as qualitative or\nquantitative, molecular or morphological). Such specific gene concepts\nthen account for the discontinuities observed in the history of\ngenetics (Burian 1985; [1995] 2005). In the light of the complex\ncellular processes in which DNA is involved, both Kitcher and Burian\nsuggest that molecular biologists ultimately study the genetic\nmaterial rather than genes, but importantly, they are still interested\nin functional units; a gene then becomes \u201canything a competent\nbiologist chooses to call a gene\u201d (Kitcher 1992: 131). Genomics\nor post-genomics can be understood as enhancing this shift (see\n \u00a71.5;\n Dupr\u00e9 2004; Stotz et al. 2006; entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nMarcel Weber (2005: Ch. 7) begins his discussion of reference and\nconceptual change in genetics by drawing on Kitcher\u2019s account of\nchanging modes of reference and reference potentials, following Burian\nin emphasizing the important role of meaning in terms of descriptions\nor theoretical beliefs. Weber then presents a more fine-grained series\nof conceptual changes, driven by the introduction of new investigative\ntechniques or new experimental organisms (esp. bacteria and phage),\nand observes that the reference potential (including theoretical\nbeliefs) as well as the extension of the term \u201cgene\u201d\nchanged continuously. Weber describes a situation where a broad\nextension based on the causal effects observed in Mendelian crossing\nexperiments is narrowed down when additional criteria are introduced\nin classical, chromosome-based genetics, broadened again to include\nbacteria and viruses, and narrowed down again to sequences of DNA that\ndetermine the sequence of proteins (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.1\u20131.3).\n Furthermore, in different contexts researchers could interpret the\nmolecular characterization differently, for instance, including or\nexcluding regulatory sequences.\n\nBecause of this diachronic and synchronic variation in gene concepts,\nWeber speaks of \u201cfloating reference\u201d, highlighting\npermanent change in the reference potential and shifts in reference.\nThis fact, according to Weber, is explained by metaphysical\nconsiderations regarding the nature of biological objects. Evolution\nproduces variation; this is true also for genetic material. As a\nresult, genetic material exhibits kinds in the sense of classes of\nobjects that share some causal disposition, but it can nonetheless be\ndivided in various ways. Hence different historical and contemporary\ngene concepts identify different kinds depending on the methods and\ninterests of researchers. Apart from the different ways to identify\ncausally relevant classes of objects, any such class contains objects\nnone of which is exactly like the other. The gene concept is thus\ncomparable to the species concept (Weber 2014; see entry on\n species).\n\nFurthermore, Weber moves from general characterizations of concepts to\nan empirical study of reference to particular genes in\nDrosophila in the context of investigative practices in\ngenetics, such as the molecular cloning of genes in the context of\ndevelopmental biology (see\n \u00a71.4).\n Even though reference and description of classical and various\nversions of molecular gene concepts differ, it turns out that the\nclassical concept is utilized in identifying genes (e.g., those\ninvolved in the organization of the fly embryo), which are then made\nsubject to molecular characterization (Weber 2005: Ch 7; see also\nWaters 1994). Thus, despite a lack of complete co-extension of the\nclassical and the molecular gene concepts, partial referential\ncontinuity plays a significant role in mediating investigative\npractices.\n\nThe importance of investigative practices highlighted by Weber is also\nemphasized by Ingo Brigandt (2010). He suggests that the content of\ntheoretical concepts consists of three elements: a concept\u2019s\nreference; its inferential role, which he construes similarly to\nKitcher\u2019s reference potential; and its epistemic goal, which he\nspecifies as the theoretical, explanatory, and investigative aims that\nare facilitated using a given concept. Brigandt argues that change of\nor variation in the inferential role of a concept is rational when the\ninferences or explanations supported by the revised concept support a\ngiven epistemic goal better than an earlier or an alternative version.\nThe epistemic goals associated with a concept can change as well,\ntypically, according to Brigandt, in a gradual manner. From this\nperspective, Brigandt reconstructs a continuous shift in the goals\npursued by researchers using the gene concept, from classical\ngenetics, which pursued the epistemic goal of predicting patterns of\ninheritance to molecular genetics\u2019 focus on the goal of\nexplaining how genes bring about their molecular products, through\nvarious intermediate goals, such as understanding the influence of\ngenes on cell metabolism (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.2\u20131.3).\n Furthermore, the account addresses the variety of gene concepts\nemerging in the last 30 years (see\n \u00a71.5).\n While the epistemic goal connected to the gene concept in\ncontemporary molecular genetics remains similar to that associated\nwith the classical molecular gene, i.e., to elucidate how DNA\ncontributes to functional RNA and protein, reference and inferential\nrole are specific to various research contexts. More recent\ndiscussions of conceptual change in biology have not focused on genes,\nbut on related concepts such as dominance (Shan 2020) or lineage (Neto\n2020).\n\nThe next section focuses on the simultaneous use of various gene\nconcepts in contemporary biology rather than the succession of gene\nconcepts.\n",
