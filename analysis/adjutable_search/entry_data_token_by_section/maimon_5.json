    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\n\nUnlike Kant and most of the German Idealists, Maimon denies that\npractical reason enjoys a primacy over theoretical reason. For Maimon,\nthe force of both morality and epistemology resides in the notion of\nuniversal validity: as rational beings we are bound by both\nphilosophical truth and moral duty. As Maimon puts the matter,\n\u201cthe moral good is good only because it is true.\u201d\n(GW II, 405 | VT 409) And, in the 1794 essay \u201cAttempt\nat a New Presentation of the Principle of Morality and a New Deduction\nof its Reality,\u201d Maimon radically alters Kant\u2019s famous\nclaim in the Groundwork about the good will being the only\nunconditioned good, instead holding that \u201cit is impossible to\nthink of anything at all in the world, or indeed even beyond it, that\ncould be considered good without limitation except the striving\nafter cognition.\u201d (GW VI, 407; translated in Quinn\n(2018)) As such, the theoretical and the practical go hand in hand;\nfor Maimon, it makes no sense to follow Kant\u2019s claim to have\ndenied knowledge to make room for faith. Rather, Maimon revives\nsomething like the Aristotelian notion that the highest virtue and\npleasure are found in philosophical contemplation. This results,\nMaimon claims, because both practical and theoretical cognition follow\nfrom the same notion of freedom:\n\nJust as I have produced the principle of practical cognition from the\nmere widening of the theoretical, so I find practical freedom from the\nmere widening of what is theoretically given as a fact, and this\nconcept of freedom first makes possible the use of this principle\n(GW VII, 275 | KU 273).\n\n\nOur cognitive situations in the theoretical and moral arenas are then\nidentical; in each, the conflicts that characterize our cognitive\ncapacities can be resolved only by assuming that our cognition is a\n\u2018schema\u2019 of an infinite intellect, which is to embrace a\ntype of dogmatism that echoes Spinoza, Leibniz and Wolff.\n\nThe similarities between the theoretical and the practical realms\nallow for an explanation of the possibility of freedom, even though\n\u201cthis concept [of freedom] is capable of no empirical\npresentation.\u201d (GW VII 241 | KU 241) Thought, Maimon\nargues, is an absolutely free activity of the faculty of cognition,\nwhich is not determined a priori by natural laws, but rather\naccording to the laws of the faculty of cognition itself. The will\nthat is related to the faculty of cognition (the will to think) is\nlikewise not determined through objects of thought, but rather through\nthe a priori form of thought, which precedes the actual\nthought of these objects (on this point, see Ware (2019)). We thus\nhave an instance of a free will in general (GW VII 242 | KU\n240).\n\nAlthough Maimon\u2019s account of freedom is related to Kant\u2019s\nposition, Maimon diverges from the critical philosophy by insisting\nthat since the moral law provides only the form of the determination\nof the will, the actualization of this form \u201cmust be connected\nto an originally agreeable feeling (which does not arise from\nhabit).\u201d (GW VII 243 | KU 241) This feeling, Maimon argues, must\nbe understood not in terms of a particular sensuous desire, but rather\nas \u201cabstracted from all individuality.\u201d (GW VII\n245 | KU 243) Here the close connection between the theoretical and\nthe practical spheres is again important, for Maimon argues that the\n\u2018abstract feeling\u2019 is best understood in terms of a\n\u2018drive for cognition\u2019:\n\nMan considers himself as an object of nature, and consequently as a\nlimited being, and yet, since his faculty of cognition extends to all\npossible objects, he finds himself in a position to strive to\ninfinity, and to get ever closer to the infinite faculty of cognition\n(divinity). Can a greater worth for a being be thought than to get\ncloser to divinity? And must not all other motives vanish in the face\nof the motives of cognition and morality (whereby all lofty\npreferences extend to outer actions)? Here we have the prevailing\nmotive of morality, whose power no one who has considered the case can\ndoubt (GW VII 246\u20137 | KU 244\u20135).\n\n\nThe role played by the pleasure of the striving after knowledge,\nhowever, recedes in importance as Maimon becomes more skeptical about\nthe possibility of explaining the motivations that lead to moral\nactions. On this point, Pollock (2020) notes the similarities between\nMaimon\u2019s skeptical response to Kant\u2019 transcendental\nidealism and his moral philosophy: both fall prey to the worries that\narise from the quid juris and the quid facti.\nPerhaps the clearest formulation of Maimon\u2019s later position is\nin \u2018The Moral Skeptic,\u2019 a late work from 1800, where a\nsketch of the difference between moral dogmatism and skepticism is\nprovided. As in the theoretical realm, Maimon focuses on the problem\nof the legitimate application of universal rules to particular cases\n(a problem that Kant in the Groundwork is well aware of).\nJust as we can be skeptical of whether the category of causality is\nlegitimately applied to particular intuitions, so too can the\nconnection between the moral law and particular actions be called into\ndoubt. While the moral law presents the rule of conduct that I ought\nto follow, there is no way, Maimon claims, to determine whether in\nfact I act only according to it, or whether other motivations have\ninsinuated themselves into the action. Kant, of course, agrees with\nthis point, but Maimon attempts to draw a more skeptical conclusion\nfrom it than Kant does. On Maimon\u2019s view, one cannot determine\nwhether an action simply accords with the moral law \u201cand hence\npossesses mere legality\u201d or whether it in fact follows from the\nmotive of duty itself, and as such lays claim to morality. This\nuncertainty arises, Maimon argues, because the moral character of an\naction is not immediately present to cognition. Rather, one can\nascribe a moral character to a person or action only after excluding\nall other possible motives as insufficient to explain the action\n\u2014 but, Maimon notes, such a strategy would require an\n\u2018infinite faculty of cognition\u2019 in order to accomplish\nthis task. Given the uncertainty about motivations, Maimon argues that\nthe moral law can at best be viewed as an \u201cidea that provides\nonly a regulative use (for legality).\u201d (GW VII 547 | MS\n285) As such, while the moral law presents a universal command, it\ncannot be shown to be the ground of human actions, since \u2014 to\nemploy a term from Maimon\u2019s theoretical philosophy \u2014 there\nis no determinate relation between the moral law and particular\nactions. For Maimon, the moral law stands, as do the Kantian\ncategories in the theoretical realm, as a \u2018castle in the\nair,\u2019 incapable of reaching the solid ground of particular\nactions.\n",
