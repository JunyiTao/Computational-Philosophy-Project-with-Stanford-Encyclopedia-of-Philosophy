    "main_text": "Life and Career\n1. Life and Career\n\nLange was born on September 28, 1828 in Wald, near Solingen, Germany.\nHe was the son of a protestant theologian, pastor and professor. Soon\nafter Lange was born, the family moved to Langenberg near Elberfeld\nand then in 1832 to Duisburg. Lange went to both elementary school and\nhigh school in Duisburg. The family moved in 1841 to Zurich so that\nhis father could take up the position as pastor and Professor of\nTheology that had been withdrawn from David Friedrich Strauss as a\nresult of Strauss\u2019s controversial book The Life of\nJesus. Lange continued his high school education in Zurich. Lange\nalso attended lectures at the university for two semesters on\nphilology and theology. He was exposed to both Hegel and Herbart in\nZurich. This exposure to Herbart influenced his later interests in\neducation theory, but more importantly led him back to Kant. In 1848\nhe went to study philology at the University of Bonn under Friedrich\nRitschl. Here he also took courses in philosophy, the history of\nclassical German literature, and analytic geometry and calculus. He\nfinished a dissertation on Greek poetry, \u201cQuaestiones\nmetricae\u201d, and was awarded his doctorate in\n 1851.[1]\n\nAfter doing his military service in Cologne, he became an assistant\nhigh school teacher there in 1852 at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium.\nAfter failing to be promoted from assistant teacher to teacher after\nthree years, he resigned and received his habilitation\n(qualification as a university lecturer) at the University of Bonn. In\n1855 he became a Privatdozent of Philosophy and Pedagogy at the\nUniversity of\n Bonn.[2]\n His inaugural lecture was on the relation between the education\nsystems and dominant world views of various time periods (Lange\n 1855).[3]\n He gave lectures on psychology and pedagogy. He began lecturing on\nthe history of materialism during the summer of 1857. This was the\nbeginning of the research that would eventually yield his book,\nThe History of Materialism, many years later. He also gave\nlectures on \u201cMoralstatistik\u201d, the view popular in some\ncircles in the nineteenth century that there are statistical\ncorrelations between the rates of certain kinds of morally significant\nbehavior such as crimes, marriages, and suicides. Lange\u2019s\nthoughts about how to reform logic also begin during this period even\nthough his book, Logical Studies, that eventually emerged\nfrom his investigations, was only published posthumously. It is\npresumably significant for his later views that during this time he\nheard Hermann von Helmholtz lecture on the \u201cPhysiology of the\nSense\n Organs\u201d.[4]\n\nAfter failing to find a university position better than that of\nPrivatdozent, he accepted an offer to teach at his old school, the\nDuisburg Gymnasium. He taught there from 1858\u20131862. He gave\nclasses on Greek, Latin, German and philosophy. He was also busy\noutside the classroom writing reports for the school authorities and\nparticipating in politics as an elector. He wrote many articles for\nKarl Schmid\u2019s encyclopedia of pedagogy during this time (Lange\n1869\u201375). This was the period when Lange really became a\npolitical activist. He participated in the organization of the new\nconsumer cooperatives meant to help the working class avoid\nexploitation by merchant traders\u2014the traders sold low-quality\ngoods at high prices and encouraged indebtedness. He was involved with\nthe liberal, nationalist society, the Deutsche Nationalverein\n(whose members were later to form a similarly motivated political\nparty, the Deutsche Fortschrittspartei) attempting to achieve\nGerman unification.\n\nLange\u2019s political activism brought him into conflict with various\nauthorities. He had to quit his teaching post because of political\nproblems in 1862. The school authorities had issued a decree in\nJanuary warning teachers not to engage in \u201cagitation\u201d.\nLange attempted to organize the teachers against the decree. He\nfollowed this up with a spirited public defense of the view that\nteachers needed to be fully active citizens in order to lead their\nstudents, by example, to the life of a true citizen (Lange 1862).\nLange continued to resist attempts by the authorities to bring state\nemployees, including teachers, into line. Another warning followed in\nJune and, despite failed attempts at reconciliation with the\nauthorities, Lange decided to leave his position at the end of the\nschool year. He became co-editor of the liberal Rhein- und\nRuhrzeitung and secretary of the Duisburg Chamber of Commerce.\nThe newspaper was an outspoken critic of the right-wing policies of\nBismarck, and already had strained relations with the authorities.\nLange also wrote for other papers and magazines, and often resorted to\npublishing short pamphlets that were widely distributed. He joined the\nmanagement of a small publishing house with the intention of\npublishing a series of popular works for the working class.\n\nDespite working on a liberal paper, his own position shifted in the\nsocialist direction. His political positions split the editorial staff\nof the newspaper, and alienated the members of the Chamber of\nCommerce. He soon left the newspaper because he thought it was not\ntaking the interests of the working class seriously enough. Similarly,\nhe broke with the Fortschrittspartei and what he took to be\nits anti-worker platform.\n\nA crucial event in his political development was his participation, a\nfew weeks after Ferdinand Lassalle\u2019s death, in the second\nCongress of the German Workers\u2019 Association, Vereinstag\ndeutscher Arbeitervereine (VDAV) in Leipzig in October 1864. The\nVDAV was founded initially as a counterweight to Lassalle\u2019s more\nradical, more Prussian, Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein\n(ADAV) (General German Workers\u2019 Association)\u2014one of the\nancestors of the current Social Democratic Party. The VDAV was set up\nas a loose organization, in contrast again to the ADAV, but acquired\nmore structure later as the Federation of German Workers\u2019\nAssociations, Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine (which kept\nthe same initials in German) (SED 1966, 216; Na\u2019aman 1980).\nLange attended the 1864 Congress as a representative of his Duisburg\nconsumers\u2019 cooperative. He was elected to the Standing Committee\nand attempted to mediate between various factions, in particular\nbetween the Lassalleans of the ADAV and the more liberal participants\nof the Congress. The politics were quite complicated, since there were\nvoices even further to the left of the leadership of the ADAV,\nfamously Marx and Engels. The disagreements were in essence about\nwhich existing social, political, and economic structures and forces\nshould or had to be accepted and worked within, and which could and\nshould be replaced. The disagreements reflected splits between the\nmiddle class and the working class. Despite his role as mediator,\nLange was clear that the workers must not be co-opted for a bourgeois,\nliberal agenda, and that the workers\u2019 movement as a whole must\nremain focused on the class interests of the working class (Bernstein\n1892, 139; Mehring 1908, 368). Lange failed to succeed in his\nmediating efforts, and felt compelled to explain his own position in\nhis Arbeiterfrage (The Labor Question) (Lange\n1865a).\n\nThese political conflicts pushed Lange\u2019s plans to publish short\nworks for the working class into the background. He did publish two\nsmaller works (Lange 1863b, 1865c). He was also writing his most\nfamous book, The History of Materialism, during this time. In\nhis Grundlegung der mathematischen Psychologie (1865b), also\nwritten during this time, he indicated that he had already finished\nhis History of Materialism. It eventually came out in print\nin 1866.\n\nWith August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, Lange continued to try to\npush the VDAV to the left: from the initial liberal position of\nHermann Schulze-Delitzsch to a position that took the interests of the\nworking class itself more seriously (Bebel 1958, 103; Hundt 1965;\nNa\u2019aman 1980, xxv). He also joined the International Working\nMen\u2019s Association, the First International, in 1866 (Weikart\n1999, 84). As the political repression increased, newspapers were no\nlonger willing to publish Lange\u2019s articles. Lange set up his own\nnewspaper, Der Bote vom Niederrhein, that ran from October\n1865 to June 1866. Marx and Engels had turned down his initial request\nfor support for such a newspaper (Lange 1968b, 78\u201379; Irmer\n1975,\n 14).[5]\n Lange had intended the newspaper to help maintain unity within the\nworkers\u2019 movement, but he failed in these efforts (Hundt 1965,\n694\u201396; Offermann 2002, 42, 147\u2013148; Lange [1866] 1968a,\n23 May 1866, 3 June 1866). By the end of this period Lange was\npolitically isolated, having broken with the liberals, and being\nunwilling to fully join the socialists. (He did not attend the VDAV in\nNuremberg in 1868, despite Bebel\u2019s encouragement to do so; see Ridolfi\n2015, 23). He was also losing hope in the working class, and felt that\nthe left was being outmaneuvered by Bismarck, in part because of the\ninternational military successes of Bismarckian politics (Ellissen\n1905, 7; Nipperdey 1985, 790\u2013803). Discouraged, he left for\nSwitzerland.\n\nHe settled in Winterthur, became co-editor of the Winterthurer\nLandboten, and joined a friend\u2019s publishing house. He\nbecame very involved in Swiss politics, particularly in the movement\nto reform the constitution and make it more democratic\u2014a\nmovement that was particularly strong in his Zurich canton. He was on\nthe boards of many social organizations and on various state\ncommittees as an expert on education, banking, and the railways\n(Weinkauff 1883, 30). During this time, he also taught occasionally at\nthe Winterthur Gymnasium. He continued working on his contributions to\nSchmid\u2019s education encyclopedia (Lange 1859\u201375) and he\nresponded to criticisms of the first edition of his History of\nMaterialism in Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte des\nMaterialismus (Lange 1867).\n\nIn 1869 he joined the Zurich faculty as a Privatdozent. He finished\nthe heavily revised second edition of the Arbeiterfrage in\n1870. In 1870 he also finally received a professorship at Zurich,\nthough, unfortunately, this happened quite soon after he was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Despite the illness he continued working on the second\nedition of The History of Materialism (Lange 1873\u201375).\nAfter rejecting offers from K\u00f6nigsberg and W\u00fcrzburg, he\naccepted an invitation to take up a professorship at Marburg in 1872.\nHe gave lectures right till the end, but cancer eventually led to his\ndeath on 21 November 1875 in Marburg.\n",
