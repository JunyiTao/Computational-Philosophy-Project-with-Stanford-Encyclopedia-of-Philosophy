    "main_text": "\n\nTransformative experiences are experiences that radically change the\nexperiencer in both an epistemic and personal way (see Paul 2014).\nWhen a person transforms epistemically, they gain knowledge\nof \u201cwhat the experience is like\u201d that they could not have\nhad without the experience. For instance, falling in love for the\nfirst time\u2014be it with a romantic partner, child, friend, or\npet\u2014is the only way to truly know what it\u2019s like to fall\nin love and allows one to better understand human bonds and\nrelationships. A person might also transform personally, or\nsuch that key agential features\u2014like their core preferences,\nlife goals, and way they maneuver through the world\u2014change. For\ninstance, falling in love has a tendency to radically reshape the\npeople and activities one prefers, change one\u2019s major future\nplans, and alter the way one moves through the world. While these\npersonal transformations might be caused epistemic ones, they also\njust could arise alongside the epistemic transformation as a result of\nthe new experience. Experiences like falling in love that transform\npeople both epistemically and personally are transformative\nexperiences.\n\nThough the concept of transformative experience sketched above comes\nfrom Paul (2014), elements of her account can be traced back to\nearlier work. For instance, antecedents include Lewis\u2019s (1988\n[1990]) discussion of what experience teaches with respect to the\nphenomenal character of the experience, as well as\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s (2006) work that highlights how making big\ndecisions isn\u2019t subject to rationality precisely because these\ndecisions tend to involve personal transformation. However,\nPaul\u2019s work has brought a resurgence of attention to the topic.\nTransformative experiences give us a way to understand the richness of\nour experiences, and also raise important questions in diverse areas\nof philosophy. Thus, this topic permeates both our lives and\nphilosophical conversations. This entry discusses the different\ncontexts in which transformative experiences may arise and the wide\nset of philosophical questions that surround transformative\nexperience.\n",
