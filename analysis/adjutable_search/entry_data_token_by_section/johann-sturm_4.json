    "main_text": "The scientific method: experimental, hypothetical, eclectic\n3. Occasionalism\n\nIn the theoretical part (physica generalis) of his\nPhysica Electiva, Sturm sets down the metaphysical foundations\nof his system. In a nutshell, Sturm argues that the whole of nature\n(human and angelic minds set aside) can be explained by two\nprinciples: matter and its modes, which are material forms. Both these\nprinciples are causally passive and shaped by local motion. Forms, in\nparticular, provide the specific reasons why certain phenomena are\nproduced in a certain way, but they do not include the causal powers\nthat bring these phenomena about. That power comes only from God, who\nis the universal and omnipresent cause acting in nature. In order to\nsupport this picture, Sturm gives a number of original twists to an\nargumentative strategy already exploited by other occasionalist\nauthors, while providing at the same time a more eclectic and broader\nrationale for endorsing an occasionalist metaphysics. To deepen\nSturm\u2019s account, three main points deserve special attention:\n(1) the justification for passive forms as modes of matter;\n(2) why God\u2019s causal power is directly needed to bring about\nnatural phenomena; and (3) the role that passive forms play in\nscientific explanations.\n\n(1) Early modern natural philosophers agree with their Scholastic\nopponents in granting that matter is utterly passive and devoid of\nefficacious causal powers. Sturm takes stock of this point, joining\nDescartes and other Cartesians in defining matter in terms of pure\nextension (res extensa) and motion as local motion. However,\nearly modern natural philosophers disagreed with Scholastics and among\nthemselves about the notion of \u2018form\u2019, whether there could\nbe any \u2018substantial form\u2019 and if rejecting substantial\nforms would lead to discard all causal powers in finite beings.\n\nSturm\u2019s position in this debate is clear-cut. Sturm argues that\nforms are nothing but modes of matter (i.e., modifications of\nan extended substance), and since matter is causally passive, forms\nare causally passive, too. Sturm agrees with many other early modern\nanti-Scholastic philosophers in dismissing scholastic substantial\nforms.\n\nSturm\u2019s argument for rejecting substantial forms is based on a\ntrilemma, according to which forms are either (i) purely material\nbeings, (ii) purely spiritual beings distinct from matter, or (iii) a\nkind of being that is in between purely material and purely immaterial\nsubstances.\n\nThe first option leads directly to Sturm\u2019s own view. If\nsubstantial forms are purely material beings, they cannot be\nsubstances in themselves because the form of a material body cannot be\nanother separate material body, given that forms operate in virtue of\ntheir intimate union with the matter of the substance of which they\nare the form. It follows that if substantial forms are purely\nmaterial, then they have to be conceived as modes of matter.\n\nThe second option is relevant because later scholastic authors (such\nas Su\u00e1rez) tended to use the rational soul as the prototype to\nunderstand natural substantial forms as well. However, the rational\nsoul is a self-standing spiritual substance that can exist and be\nconceived independently from the body with which it is united. This\nentails that the rational soul is not the form of the body,\nbut simply a different, independent substance that is united with the\nbody itself. Hence (pace scholastics), the case of the human\nrational soul cannot be used as a model to conceptualize\n\u2018substantial forms\u2019 in other (non-human) natural beings\n(PE I: 94).\n\nSturm\u2019s argument against the third option of the trilemma runs\nas follows. If one defines (as scholastics usually do) a substantial\nform in terms of the role that the form plays in explaining and\naccounting for the nature of composite beings, then what is called a\n\u2018substantial form\u2019 cannot belong to the ontological\ncategory of a substance, but only to the category of\n\u2018relatives\u2019 or relational things. Sturm stresses that\n\u201cthe entire nature of a form generally and essentially consists\nof a relation\u201d (PE I: 94). Forms are not beings in themselves,\nbut ways in which certain beings operate and undergo changes.\nAgainst the third option of the trilemma, Sturm maintains that forms\nare not the kind of being that can be conceived of or exist\nindependently from the being that they inform. Natural forms\ncannot be understood as a kind of substance or being\nintermediate between material and spiritual substances because forms\nare not substances in the first place. Since natural forms\nare relational beings they cannot be substances, and\nthus the very idea of a \u2018substantial form\u2019 is a chimera, a\ncategory mistake. The only viable option left is thus the one defended\nby Sturm himself: forms are modes of matter, and since matter is\ncausally passive, forms are causally passive as well.\n\n(2) This conclusion requires an account of how natural phenomena can\ntake place if nothing in nature is endowed with active causal powers.\nAccording to Sturm, the origin of natural causality lies in God\nhimself. God is the substance defined by pure activity, and He is the\nonly truly efficient cause of all motion in the world:\n\n\nOnly God\u2019s most efficacious volition is that truly acting power\n(virtutem), which moves while not being moved, which\nrigorously speaking moves, which moves one body by means of\n(per) another, which moves the whole corporeal world, its\nparts, some by means of (per) others, and in this way He\nbrings about (efficiat) every one of the natural effects that\nhappens in even the most remote corners of the Universe by means of\nhis sole immediate power. (PE I: 164)\n\n\nGod is the \u201crequiring cause\u201d (causam exigentem,\nPE I: 161) of natural phenomena. This means that when God\nwants something to happen then the effect obtains. However,\nSturm also maintains that God\u2019s will does not operate in nature\nthrough its \u201cabsolute power\u201d (potentia absoluta)\nbut rather by following what Sturm calls \u201crespective or\nhypothetical power\u201d (potentia respectiva &\nhypothetica):\n\n\nHere I established that God acts and operates in the whole of nature,\nnot on the basis of his absolute power (which obtains whatever he\nwants without hindrances and in the most perfect way), but on the\nbasis of a respective and hypothetical power, whose exercise God\nhimself has (in the most free way) subordinated to certain conditions\nof matter or of the human mind. (PE I: 178)\n\n\nGod did not establish to elicit effects absolutely by his mere act of\nfree will. Rather, God freely subordinated his own actions to the\nobtainment of certain specific conditions, namely, certain states of\nnatural beings or of human minds. Sturm does not extensively use the\nMalebranchian terminology of occasional causes, but he does explicitly\nequate occasional causes with sine quibus non causes (PE I:\n117). A sine qua non cause is a (counterfactually) necessary\ncondition for the production of a certain effect, although the\nsine qua non cause does not truly contribute to its\nproduction in virtue of any active power it possesses (see Sangiacomo\n2019). Sturm\u2019s account of God\u2019s hypothetical power entails\nthat all natural forms are sine quibus non conditions for the\nproduction of natural effects, in the sense that they do not\ncontribute in virtue of any active power they might have (since they\nhave none), but rather because God (freely) established to bring about\ncertain effects as consequences of certain modifications (i.e., forms)\nof matter. Since (what Malebranche calls) \u2018occasional\ncauses\u2019 can be understood in terms of sine qua non\ncausation, and since Sturm maintains that all natural forms work as\nsine quibus non causes of natural effects, it seems safe to\nconclude that Sturm supports a version of occasionalism.\n\nHence, Sturm\u2019s strategy achieves its goal: matter is causally\npassive, and material forms are passive as well. In order to account\nfor the changes observed in nature, it is necessary to locate a source\nfor causal activity. However, this source cannot be found anywhere in\nthe natural world itself. God is thus the only candidate left to\naccount for the causal active power needed to bring about natural\nphenomena. God\u2019s power, however, is only responsible for the\nfact that natural phenomena are brought about. The specific\nreason why they are such and such is to be located in the\nspecific features of passive forms themselves. In this respect,\nGod\u2019s involvement in nature plays only a metaphysical grounding\nfunction and it is not supposed to replace, but rather to justify, the\nneed to carefully investigate the mechanical structures of passive\nforms.\n\nSturm\u2019s occasionalism, however, is quite peculiar, especially as\ncompared to Malebranche\u2019s more familiar version of\noccasionalism. A crucial feature of Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism\nis the role that the laws of nature play in accounting for natural\nphenomena. According to him, natural beings do not have any causal\npowers and can be occasions of their effects only in virtue of the\nlaws of nature established by God. In contrast, Sturm takes God to\nestablish the whole set of counterfactually necessary conditionals\nthat determine which effects will obtain when certain conditions are\nin place in nature. These conditions are passive forms themselves,\nwhich then play the role of explanantia of natural\nphenomena.\n\n(3) Sturm\u2019s account of passive forms breaks with the idea that\nexplanatory principles in natural philosophy must also account for the\nactive power that brings phenomena about. In this sense, Sturm\ndismisses the idea that causal explanations must be based on active\npowers intrinsic to the natural agents themselves. According to Sturm,\nall phenomena are brought about by God himself. But God\u2019s power\nbeing indifferent, differences among phenomena depend on passive\nforms, which operate as sine quibus non conditions for their\nproduction. This means that the explanandum in natural\nphenomena is not the fact that something is brought about, but rather\nthe specific characteristics of what is brought about. God\u2019s\npower explains that something (in general) is brought about, but only\npassive forms explain what is brought about in particular and how. The\nexplanandum in natural phenomena is thus the specificity of\nthe phenomenon at stake, and the explanans of this phenomenon\nare passive forms, which are a matter of empirical investigation.\n\nSturm\u2019s approach combines the strengths of both the scholastic\nand seventeenth-century mechanist approach in order to remedy their\nreciprocal shortcomings. Passive mechanical forms (as\nAristotelian-scholastic forms) are particular principles of\nexplanation that can be used to account for different specific\nphenomena. At the same time, passive mechanical forms (as mechanical\nprinciples) are ontologically nothing but modes of matter shaped by\nmotion. Passive forms are different among themselves but they\nare all ontologically shaped by the same universal principles, which\nmake explanations based on passive mechanical forms homogenous and\nuniform (from a conceptual point of view) without making them too\ngeneral and abstract.\n\nSturm\u2019s approach has at least two important implications: (i)\nthe integration of teleology and final causation in a mechanist\nnatural philosophy; and (ii) the marginalization of the laws of nature\ntherein.\n\nSturm is a strenuous defender of natural teleology and final causes.\nIn the chapter dedicated to final causes in the PE, Sturm presents to\nthe reader numerous phenomena which are supposed to back up or at\nleast make her inclined to accept the existence of teleology in nature\nas well as the necessity to study it. Sturm mentions inter\nalia bodily organs performing certain functions (the eyes are\nthere to see; the heart pumps blood through the body) and the\nwell-adaptedness of certain animals; for instance, in the case of\nbirds (geese, ducks, storks) their wings, the lightness of their\nbones, and the possession of a certain type of beak. According to\nSturm, ends and uses are an inextricable part of the world as a whole\nand of its parts (PE I: 226). Sturm\u2019s passive forms thus retain\nthe teleological connotation that Aristotelian forms already had,\nfitting it into a mechanist picture of the universe. Forms are\nstructures of matter aimed at producing certain effects rather than\nothers. They are not only the efficient (passive) conditions for these\neffects to obtain, but also the final (passive) principles that\nexplain them. Properly speaking, God himself, once again, is the sole\nfinal cause in nature, since God is the one who designed,\nplanned and carried out the whole of nature as a gigantic and most\nperfect clockwork.\n\nSturm\u2019s emphasis on forms has its counterpart in his\nmarginalization of the role that the laws of nature play in his\nnatural philosophy and in scientific explanations. Sturm puts forward\nonly two very general laws, one concerning the communication of motion\n(PE I: 164) and the other concerning the mind-body union (PE I:\n858\u2013859). Focusing on the conservation of motion, it is\nimportant to stress that this law is not supposed to explain what\nspecific features different specific bodies can have, nor does Sturm\never suggest that the variety of finite things could follow from a\nconsideration of this (or any other) law alone. Rather, the law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion simply constrains the effects\nof every natural phenomenon (namely, the fact that motion cannot be\ndissipated during impacts but must be always conserved in the whole of\nthe universe). Remarkably, Sturm also mentions that this law is not\ndeduced a priori from purely metaphysical considerations (as\nis the case in Descartes\u2019 deduction of conservation from the\nnature of God\u2019s immutability), but rather only a\nposteriori on the basis of empirical observations. As an\nempirical regularity derived from experience, Sturm\u2019s\nconservation law does not have the same strong metaphysical\nconnotations of Malebranche\u2019s laws of nature (which are grounded\nin a consideration of God\u2019s attributes of simplicity and\nwisdom), nor does it play any significant role in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena.\n",
