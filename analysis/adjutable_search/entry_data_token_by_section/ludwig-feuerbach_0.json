    "main_text": "Biographical Introduction\n1. Biographical Introduction\n\nLudwig was the fourth son of the distinguished jurist, Paul Johann\nAnselm Ritter von Feuerbach. His nephew, the neo-classical painter,\nAnselm Feuerbach, was the son of Ludwig\u2019s older brother, also\ncalled Anselm, who was himself a classical archaeologist and\naesthetician \u201cin the spirit of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and\nJohann Joachim\n Winckelmann\u201d.[6]\n Ludwig\u2019s father, who studied philosophy and law at Jena in the\n1790s with the Kantians, Karl Reinhold and Gottlieb Hufeland,\nrespectively, belonged to a group of distinguished northern German\nscholars called to Bavaria during the period of administrative reform\nunder Maximilian Montgelas and charged with the task of modernizing\nthe legal and educational institutions of what became in 1806 the\nmodern kingdom of Bavaria. Other members of this group of so-called\nNordlichter or \u201cnorthern lights\u201d included F.I.\nNiethammer, F.H. Jacobi (the godfather of Ludwig\u2019s younger\nbrother, Friedrich), and Friedrich Thiersch (the tutor of\nLudwig\u2019s two oldest brothers, who has sometimes been called\n\u201cthe Humboldt of Bavaria\u201d). P.J.A. Feuerbach was knighted\nin recognition of his achievement in modernizing the Bavarian penal\ncode, though his political influence was dramatically curtailed as a\nresult of outspoken national-liberal criticisms of Napoleon expressed\nin pamphlets he published in 1813 and 1814 (cf. Tomasoni 2015:\n16\u201325).\n\nRaised Protestant and religiously devout in his youth, Ludwig\nmatriculated in 1823 in the theological faculty of the University of\nHeidelberg, where his father hoped he would come under the influence\nof the late rationalist, H.E.G. Paulus. Ludwig was won over instead by\nthe speculative theologian, Karl Daub, who had been instrumental in\nbringing Hegel to Heidelberg for two years in 1816, and was by this\ntime one of the foremost theologians of the Hegelian school. By 1824,\nLudwig had secured his father\u2019s grudging permission to transfer\nto Berlin under the pretext of wanting to study with the theologians,\nFriedrich Schleiermacher and August Neander, but in fact because of\nhis growing infatuation with Hegel\u2019s philosophy.\nFeuerbach\u2019s matriculation at Berlin was delayed because of\nsuspicions of his involvement in the politically subversive student\nfraternity (Burschenschaft) movement, in which two of his\nolder brothers were active, for which reason one of them (Karl, a\ntalented mathematician) was imprisoned and subsequently attempted\nsuicide. In 1825, to his father\u2019s consternation, Ludwig\ntransferred to the philosophical faculty, thereafter hearing within a\ntwo-year period all of Hegel\u2019s lectures, except for those on\naesthetics, repeating the lectures on logic\n twice.[7]\n\nFeuerbach defended his Latin dissertation, De ratione, una,\nuniversali, infinita, at the University of Erlangen in 1828. Soon\nthereafter, he began to deliver lectures on the history of modern\nphilosophy at the same university, a bastion of theological and\npolitical conservatism many of whose faculty were closely associated\nwith the neo-Pietist Awakening. One colleague of Feuerbach\u2019s at\nErlangen was Julius Friedrich Stahl, who would go on to become a\nleading theorist of conservatism, and was associated by Feuerbach with\nthe so-called \u201cpositive philosophy\u201d of the late Schelling.\nFeuerbach imprudently appended to his first book, Thoughts on\nDeath and Immortality (1830, hereafter Thoughts; see\n Section 2\n below), which was published anonymously, but to no avail, a number of\nscathingly satirical and even vulgar couplets (Xenien)\ndirected against the Pietists that effectively destroyed his prospects\nfor an academic career.\n\nDuring the 1830s, Feuerbach published three books on the history of\nmodern philosophy, in addition to several essays and reviews. These\ninclude the History of Modern Philosophy from Bacon to\nSpinoza (1833), History of Modern Philosophy: Presentation,\nDevelopment, and Critique of the Leibnizian Philosophy (1837),\nand Pierre Bayle: A Contribution to the History of Philosophy and\nHumanity (1838), none of which have been translated into\n English.[8]\n The first won him the praise of Edward Gans and an invitation from\nLeopold von Henning to contribute reviews to the Annals for\nScientific Criticism, the principal journal of the Hegelian\nacademic establishment in Berlin. In these reviews, Feuerbach defended\nthe Hegelian philosophy vigorously against critics such as Karl\nBachmann. Even after the publication of the works on Leibniz and\nBayle, however, his efforts to secure an academic appointment remained\nunsuccessful. He was able for several decades to sustain his existence\nas an independent scholar in the remote Frankish village of Bruckberg\nby virtue of his wife, Bertha L\u00f6w, having been partial heir of a\nporcelain factory located there, from a modest pension due to his\nfather\u2019s service to Bavaria, and from publishing royalties.\n\nThe event that precipitated the gradual dissolution of the Hegelian\nsynthesis of faith and knowledge (a process later referred to\nsardonically by Marx and Engels as the \u201cputrefaction of absolute\nspirit\u201d) was the publication in two volumes in 1835\u201336 of\nD.F. Strauss\u2019s Life of Jesus Critically Examined. In\nthis controversial work, Strauss used the tools of historical\ncriticism he had acquired from his T\u00fcbingen teacher, F.C. Baur,\nto develop a compelling argument for the historical unreliability of\nthe accounts of the life of Jesus preserved in the canonical gospels.\nIn a relatively brief \u201cconcluding dissertation\u201d at the end\nof this lengthy work of biblical criticism, Strauss appealed to\nHegel\u2019s philosophy in proposing to interpret the doctrine of the\nincarnation of Christ as a mythological expression of the\nphilosophical truth of the identity of the divine spirit and the human\nspecies (conceived as the community of finite spirits existing\nthroughout history, and not as the historical individual, Jesus of\nNazareth). The appearance of Strauss\u2019s book confirmed the\nsuspicions of theological conservatives like E.W. Hengstenberg and\nHeinrich Leo that Hegel\u2019s philosophy, despite its use of\nChristian terminology, is incompatible with the historical faith, and\nthe editors of the Berlin Annals felt compelled to publicly discredit\nStrauss\u2019s Hegelian credentials. It was in the wake of these\nevents that Arnold Ruge and Theodor Echtermeyer established the\nHalle Annals for German Science and Art, which served for\nseveral years as the principal literary organ of the so-called Young\nHegelians. Among the essays and reviews that Feuerbach began to\ncontribute to the Halle Annals in 1838 is one entitled\n\u201cToward a Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy\u201d (1839), in\nwhich he began to distance himself publicly from the Hegelian cause,\ncalling for a \u201creturn to nature,\u201d as well as for a\nnaturalistic explanation of the mysteries of Christianity and of\nreligion more\n generally.[9]\n Publication of the Halle Annals was suspended by the\nPrussian censor in 1841.\n\nFeuerbach achieved the height of his brief literary fame with the\npublication, also in 1841, of The Essence of Christianity, a\nwork that made a striking impression on a number of his\ncontemporaries. Engels recalled the appearance of this book as having\na profoundly \u201cliberating effect\u201d on him and Marx by\n\u201cbreaking the spell\u201d of the Hegelian system and\nestablishing the truths that human consciousness is the only\nconsciousness or spirit that exists, and that it is ontologically\ndependent upon the physical existence of human beings as part of\nnature (Engels 1888: 12\u201313). In 1844, Marx wrote to Feuerbach,\nwith reference to the latter\u2019s Principles of the Philosophy\nof the Future (1843; hereafter Principles) and The\nEssence of Faith According to Luther (1844), that in them he had,\nintentionally or not, \u201cgiven socialism a philosophical\nfoundation\u201d (GW v. 18, p. 376). In fact, Feuerbach was\nonly then beginning to acquaint himself with socialist ideas through\nhis reading of authors like Lorenz von Stein and Wilhelm Weitling. In\nthe end, he declined Marx\u2019s request for a contribution to the\nGerman-French Annals, as well as Ruge\u2019s urging that he\nbecome more politically engaged. He came out of rural seclusion to\nobserve, with great anticipation followed by mounting disillusionment,\nthe events in Frankfurt in 1848, and to deliver a series of public\nlectures at Heidelberg beginning the same year. Rather than working to\nspell out in detail the \u201cphilosophy of the future\u201d for\nwhich he himself had called in the early 1840s, Feuerbach continued to\nfocus his attention mainly on religion in works including The\nEssence of Religion (1845), Lectures on the Essence of\nReligion (1851), and Theogony According to the Sources of\nClassical, Hebrew and Christian Antiquity (1857). The five years\nof philological labor he invested in the latter work, which he\nconsidered his crowning achievement, went largely unnoticed both by\nhis contemporaries and by posterity.\n\nDuring the 1840s, Feuerbach corresponded, and occasionally visited and\nmaintained close personal relationships with, several leading German\nradicals, including, in addition to Ruge and Marx, the publishers,\nOtto L\u00fcning, Otto Wigand, and Julius Fr\u00f6bel; the\nrevolutionary poet, Georg Herwegh, and his wife, Emma; Hermann Kriege,\na freelance activist and early German socialist who emigrated to\nAmerica; as well as the scientific materialists, Carl Vogt and Jacob\nMoleschott. It was in a review of a book on nutrition published by the\nlatter figure that Feuerbach famously quipped, \u201cMan ist, was man\ni\u00dft,\u201d making a play on words that doesn\u2019t come\nthrough in the English expression, \u201cYou are what you eat.\u201d\nThe impression made by Feuerbach on several leading lights of the\nyounger generation is reflected in Gottfried Keller\u2019s\nBildungsroman, Green Henry (1855), which features a\ncharacter inspired by Feuerbach, as well as in the original dedication\n(to Feuerbach) of Richard Wagner\u2019s early book, The Art-Work\nof the Future (1850).\n\nPartly as the result of a global financial crisis, the porcelain\nfactory that had supported Feuerbach\u2019s literary existence went\nbankrupt in 1859. The following year he and his wife and daughter were\nforced to relocate to the village of Rechenberg, located then on the\noutskirts of Nuremberg, where Feuerbach lived out the remainder of his\nlife in increasingly ill health. Although his productivity as a writer\ndeclined sharply during this period, he was able, in 1866, to bring\nout the tenth and final volume of his collected works (which had begun\nto appear in 1846), bearing the title, God, Freedom and\nImmortality from the Standpoint of Anthropology, and including a\nfairly substantial, though fragmentary, essay \u201cOn Spiritualism\nand Materialism, Especially in Relation to the Freedom of the\nWill\u201d. In this essay, and in an essay on ethics that Feuerbach\nleft incomplete at his death, we find him beginning to sketch out a\nmoral psychology, and an eudaimonistic ethical theory, in which the\nconcept of the \u201cdrive-to-happiness\u201d\n(Gl\u00fcckseligkeitstrieb) plays a central role.\n",
