Wittgenstein\n\nAs noted, Findlay met Wittgenstein in February 1930 and again in 1939.\nHis description of the first encounter, published in 1974, has been\nfrequently quoted by Wittgenstein\u2019s biographers (see, for\nexample, Bartley 1985: 192):\n\n\nAt the age of 40 he looked like a youth of 20, with a godlike beauty,\nalways an important feature at Cambridge. The God received him and\ngave him lunch in an ascetic room, beautiful in its almost total\nemptiness, where a wooden bowl of fruit on a table made one note of\ncolor. The God was all he had been described as being: he looked like\nApollo who had bounded into life out of his own statue, or perhaps\nlike the Norse God Baldur, blue-eyed and fair haired, with a beauty\nthat had nothing sensual about it, but simply breathed the four Greek\ncardinal virtues, to which was added a very exquisite kindness and\ngraciousness that bathed one like remote, slightly wintry\nsunshine\u2026 The tea that one drank with him tasted like nectar.\n(EQ: 173\u20134)\n\n\nFindlay was also a keen appreciator of Wittgenstein\u2019s prose\nstyle, and felt that some fraction of Wittgenstein\u2019s influence\nstemmed from the beauty of his German sentences, a beauty that an\nunwary reader might mistake for truth. Nevertheless, he freely\nacknowledged Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophical genius:\n\n\nOne could not listen to Wittgenstein\u2019s least pronouncements,\nhowever falteringly expressed, without feeling that they sprung from a\nmind of supreme integrity and the most penetrating insight. (W:\n24)\n\n\nand the threat it posed to his own work. If the Tractatus was\nright, his book on Meinong was wrong; if the Blue and Brown books were\nright, then Values and Intentions was misguided, if the\nPhilosophical Investigations (1953) got it right, the Gifford\nlectures were nonsense. The defensive result was Wittgenstein: a\nCritique, published in Findlay\u2019s eightieth year. \n\n\nI have returned to my own orbit as a result of learning to answer\nalmost all of Wittgenstein\u2019s rhetorical questions, which were\nintended to promote the answer \u201cYes\u201d, with the straight\nanswer \u201cNo\u201d.(EQ: 168) \n\n\nWittgenstein: A Critique reviews the Tractatus, the\nBlue and Brown books, Remarks on the Foundations of the\nMathematics, and the Investigations. The format is to take key\naphorisms from Wittgenstein, expound them at considerable length, and\nthen launch objections, which pile up as in a Thomistic\nSumma, but absent the replies. For example, against the\nTractatus, Findlay objects (1) \u201cUltimate simple\nobjects\u201d are not ontologically viable, whatever can be referred\nto must have an internal structure, and form part of a larger\nrelational structure; (2) \u201cThe restriction of all domains to the\nactually existent\u201d is to be rejected because it is always\nsignificant to suppose that this thing that exists, might have not\nexisted; (3) the view that \u201call necessities are logical\nnecessities\u201d is wrong because two atomic propositions can be\ninconsistent; (4) the axiom of extensionality is false because there\nare significant and true modal propositions; (5) not \u201call\nlogical necessities are tautological\u201d, since , e.g.,\n\u201cp\u201d and \u201cnot not p\u201d differ in\nsense; ( 6) the picture theory of language is wrong because meanings\nare connected to objects by intentional mental acts, not by\n\u201cmirroring\u201d (W: 222).\n\nHusserl\u2019s \u201cmeaning as intentionality\u201d theory is\nbrought to bear on the \u201cmeaning as use\u201d doctrine of the\nBlue and Brown books and Philosophical Investigations.\nFindlay remarks that he was shocked in 1939 when Wittgenstein admitted\nto him that he had already written a great deal about \u201cmental\nprocesses\u201d, while reading next to nothing of the great early\ntwentieth century experimental psychologists (SF: 31). So when\nWittgenstein mocked the story of the mind\u2019s eye viewing inner\nmental pictures, he was ignorant of Titchner\u2019s work on\n\u201cimageless thought;\u201d when he attacked introspection as\npseudo-science, he was ignorant of the careful and disciplined\nintrospective methods of K\u00fclpe and the W\u00fcrzburg school, and\nso forth. Many of Wittgenstein\u2019s targets are thus straw men.\n\nFindlay readily concedes that Wittgenstein is right that there is\nrarely a uniform inner experience that is invariably present in a\nspecific mental processes such as thinking or believing. But it is a\nmistake infer from the absence of uniform inner experiences that there\nare no inner experiences at all:\n\n\nWittgenstein denies the existence of specific experiences of\nintending, with equal correctness and incorrectness. There are\nintentions as poignantly experienced as the nailing of these to church\ndoors, and intentions distinguished only by the very faint note of\n\u201cto be doneness\u201d, as when we go up to someone and greet\nhim. (W: 39)\n\n\nAnd again:\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s dogmatic pronouncement may here be contrasted\nwith the vastly varied categorizations which introspective\npsychologists have brought into the examination of pain, as well as\ninto every other form of organic or kinesthetic sensation, using\nmetaphorical descriptions without stint, and often with great aptness.\n(W: 222)\n\n\nThese inner experiences are part of a general subjectivity that form\nthe background without which language cannot even arise; this\nbackground is a quasi-language of thought possessed to some degree by\nnon-human animals. \n\n\n[Wittgenstein] has rejected what seemed to him the idle pictures that\nmen fashion in going beyond the actual sues of language, but he has\ngiven us little understanding of what those actual uses are, and what\nthey ought to be. Blind acceptance of the uses of expression, without\na justifying ontology or experimental phenomenology, does not\nrecommend itself to the most na\u00efve user of words: they look for a\njustification of use, and they seek it beyond use. The falsifying,\nmerely pictorial element abounds in inner-life talk, but it will none\nthe less not do to throw out the baby of inner experience with the\nbath water of undisciplined diction (W: 252)\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s famous argument against \u201ca private\nlanguage\u201d, is set by Findlay in a special context. In the\nTractatus Wittgenstein endorses solipsism: there is even a\nexample of one eye contemplating a world that is entirely its own.\nFindlay argued that Wittgenstein not only preached solipsism; he lived\nit. \u201cWittgenstein, I consider, is one of the few and genuine\ncomplete solipsists who have ever existed\u201d (SF: 62). He believed\nthat he did not know what it is to be like someone other than\nWittgenstein, or that anyone else could gasp what his own life was\nlike.\n\n\nHis pervasive aestheticism certainly displayed a character that I\nbelieve, is technically describable as \u201cschizoid\u201d, there\nwas something, queer, detached, surreal, incompletely human about it.\nHis colorless simple objects are not things that one can touch and\nhandle, and his villagers who sell apples one by one taken from a\ndrawer, and then ritually count them as they are taken out, or who\nassure themselves that something is red by taking a named sample of\nred out of their pockets, are plainly the inhabitants of a dream or a\nnightmare, and not of a possible village. (W: 21)\n\n\nThe \u201cprivate language argument\u201d in this context, becomes\nan almost hysterical attempt to provide a public world and public\ncommunication between the separate selves of the Tractatus.\nTo insist (against private languages) that \u201cinner processes must\nhave outer criteria\u201d is not a problem for Findlay, who remained\na quasi-behaviorist to the end. The problem is to claim, as\nWittgenstein did, that in most cases outward criteria cannot be found,\nand to declare on this basis that inner processes are largely\nmythical. On Findlay\u2019s interpretation, Wittgenstein spent his\nyouthful years hiding his inner experiences, and then in later life\ninvented a philosophy that declared that he had nothing to hide.\n\nThe Wittgenstein wave has largely passed by, and Findlay\u2019s\nmultitudinous objections look a bit like overkill. Philosophy today\nhas rediscovered psychology, though it is the psychology of Kahneman\nand Tversky and Pylyshyn, not the psychology of Brentano or Titchner.\nBut Findlay\u2019s style of objecting to Wittgenstein, rather than\nignoring him, presupposes a common ground, and suggests a continuing\nrelevance of Wittgenstein\u2019s thought for the contemporary\nphilosophy of mind. \n\nTo close with an autobiographical passage: Findlay, a theosophist\nsurrounded by hostile logicians, seems to have found in Wittgenstein a\nkindred spirit: \n\n\nHe treated me with extraordinary graciousness, perhaps principally\nbecause he saw in me an inconsequential unbelongingness akin to his\nown. He gave me his then only copy of the first 150 sections of the\nPhilosophical Investigations to read! It is in the light of\nhis many kindnesses that I should wish this present, highly critical\nbook about his teachings to be regarded, not merely as a critique, but\nalso as a tribute. (W: 22)\n\n",
