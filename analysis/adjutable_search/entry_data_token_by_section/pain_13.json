In other words, the\nphenomenal and representational contents of pain are one and the same\nthing, thus they cannot come apart. Among the defenders of pain\nrepresentationalism understood this way are Harman (1990), Dretske\n(1995, 1999, 2003), Tye (1996, 1997, 2006a, 2006b), Byrne (2001),\nSeager (2002), Bain (2003, 2007, 2013, 2017), and Cutter & Tye\n(2011), Cutter\n (2017).[15]\n\nMost early direct realist accounts of perception, as mentioned before,\nwere shy about acknowledging a robust phenomenology for experiences.\nThis was primarily because experiential phenomenology was associated\nwith indirect realism and sense-data theories in particular. Many\nearly direct realists embraced adverbialism because adverbialism\npromised a way of being realist about experiences while\navoiding an act-object view of them. Because most direct realists\nidentified pains with sensory experiences rather than their objects,\nthe direct perceptual theorists about pain needed a robust (realist)\nnotion of experience. Adverbialism gave way to a strong form of\nrepresentationalism by suggesting ways in which intentional content\ncould be naturalized on the basis of those canonical conditions that\ncausally/lawfully control the occurrence of perceptual experiences in\nvirtue of which they represent those bodily conditions. This opened up\nthe possibility of defending direct realism about a robust\nexperiential phenomenology with completely naturalistic credentials.\nThe result was strong representationalism about all experiential\nphenomenology, according to which the entire phenomenal (qualitative)\ncharacter or qualities of any experience is metaphysically constituted\nwithout remainder by its (wide) representational content (=phenomenal\ncontent)\n\nHence, representationalism about experience in this context needs to\nbe understood in a reductionist sense. As we have seen, indirect\nrealist theories, especially in the form of sense-datum theories, were\nalso advanced as representational theories (perhaps excluding the\nintransitive bodily sensations). Indeed, the old name for indirect\nrealism was \u201crepresentative realism.\u201d On these theories,\nin having a perceptual experience we are directly acquainted with\nqualia, understood either as intrinsic qualities of experiences or as\nproperties of phenomenal individuals like sense-data. But, at least in\nstandard exteroception, these qualities contingently\nrepresent objective sensible properties of public objects in virtue of\neither resembling them or by being regularly caused by their\ninstantiations \u2014 or both. In other words, on an indirect realist\napproach, they are distinct existences: qualia or sense-data come\nto represent public objects and their sensible properties in\nvirtue of some contingent relations holding between them\n(resemblance or causation).\n\nHowever, in her acknowledgment of phenomenology, the reductionist\ndirect realist cannot have such phenomenal objects somehow internal to\none\u2019s mind or experience, nor can she endorse the existence of\nqualities intrinsic to experiences that we can become\ndirectly aware of in introspection \u2014 the basic direct\nperceptualist intuition, recall, is that our experiences are\ntransparent to us in that they present us the world directly and\nimmediately (this external relation is primary). So if qualia are to\nbe retained in one\u2019s direct realist picture of perception, these\nqualia need to be reduced to representational content of perceptual\nstates. We will sometimes use \u2018strong representationalism\u2019\nto distinguish this view from \u201crepresentative realism\u201d\n(see Block 2006 \u2014 Block uses \u2018representationism\u2019 to\nmark the same distinction).\n\nLike earlier direct realists, strong representationalists tend to be\nnaturalists or physicalists. Therefore these theories usually come\nwith a naturalist account of how these states (thought of as realized\nin the central nervous system) acquire their representational content.\nThe most common account is either an ideal causal co-variation theory\n(informational semantics \u2014 see Dretske 1981, Fodor 1987, Aydede\nand G\u00fczeldere 2005) or a teleological psychosemantics (see\nMillikan 1984, Papineau 1987) or both (Dretske 1988, 1995; Tye 1996a).\nThese are externalist\n theories.[16]\n\nTo recap, strong representationalism is the modern day\u2019s direct\nrealism about perception, where adverbialism is replaced by\nrepresentationalism run on a naturalistic story about how perceptual\nexperiences acquire their (analog) representational content that in\nturn constitutes their phenomenology. So, according to strong\nrepresentationalism, pain experiences feel the way they do in virtue\nof their representational content, and nothing else. They represent\nvarious disorderly conditions of bodily tissue. The way they represent\nthese conditions is analogous to the way our visual system represents\ncolors. If colors are (at least, partly) objective features of\nsurfaces like their surface spectral reflectances, our visual\nexperiences don\u2019t represent colors as such, so we cannot come to\nconceptualize colors as spectral reflectances on the basis of their\n\u201cgrainless\u201d visual presentations. So it is no objection to\nrepresentationalism that our pain experiences don\u2019t represent\ntissue damage as such, which is to say that we cannot necessarily\nconceptualize what pain experiences represent as tissue damage solely\non the basis of these experiences.\n\nIt is sometimes said that perceptual experiences represent what they\ndo nonconceptually, which is often times equated with\nanalog content (realized in picture-like continuous\nrepresentations). In this context we can take this as a claim about\nthe way experiences are representationally structured: they are not\nstructured out of concepts (discrete representations) as thoughts are\nusually thought to be. Every sensory modality has a range of\nproprietary qualities that they can detect. Pain experiences seem no\ndifferent, although they may be less rich in terms of their\ninformational content compared to vision for instance. Nevertheless,\nit is reasonable to argue that qualitative differences in pain\nexperiences are due to their representing different bodily conditions.\nTye lists a number of candidates:\n\n\u2026 a twinge of pain represents a mild, brief case of damage. A\nthrobbing pain represents a rapidly pulsing disorder. Aches represent\nregions of damage inside the body rather than on the surface. These\nregions are represented as having volume, as gradually beginning and\nending, as increasing in severity, as slowly fading away. The volumes\nso represented are not represented as precise or sharply bounded. This\nis why aches are not felt to have precise locations, unlike pricking\npains, for example. A stabbing pain is one that represents sudden\ndamage over a particular well-defined bodily region. This region is\nrepresented as having volume (rather than being two-dimensional), as\nbeing the shape of something sharp-edged and pointed (like that of a\ndagger). In the case of a pricking pain, the relevant damage is\nrepresented as having a sudden beginning and ending on the surface or\njust below, and as covering a very tiny area. A racking pain is one\nthat represents that the damage involves the stretching of internal\nbody parts (e.g., muscles). (Tye 1997, p. 333; cf. Tye 1996, 2006a)\n\n\nThe problem of pain location is handled in the same way that the early\nperceptual theories handled them: the location of pain is the location\nthat the pain experiences represent as where the tissue damage is\noccurring. This sort of account becomes more attractive in light of\nthe fact that we now have a much more robust and realist notion of\nexperience whose phenomenological-cum-representational-content is a\ndirect guide to the location of tissue damage. The phenomenology of\npain experiences now directly (transparently) presents tissue damage\nto the sufferer in virtue of its identity with its representational\ncontent (Tye 2006a, 2006b).\n",
