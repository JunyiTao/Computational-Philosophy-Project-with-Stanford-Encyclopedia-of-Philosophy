    "main_text": "Naturalizing Social Construction || Construction, Human Kinds and Human Traits\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe metaphor of \u201csocial construction\u201d has proven\nremarkably supple in labeling and prompting a range of research across\nthe social sciences and humanities, and the themes of personal and\ncultural causation taken up in this research are themselves of central\nconcern. While most philosophical effort has gone towards the\ninterpretation and refutation of provocative accounts of social\nconstruction arising especially out of studies in the history and\nsociology of science, social constructionist themes emerge across a\nhost of other contexts, offering philosophical naturalists a range of\nalternate ways of engaging constructionist themes. Philosophical\nnaturalists as well as working scientists have begun to take up this\nopportunity in ways that use the methods of philosophy and science to\nboth state and evaluate social constructionist hypotheses (though not\nalways under that label). Because of the powerful and central role\nculture plays in shaping human social environments, behaviors,\nidentities and development, there is ample room for continuing and\neven expanding the pursuit of social constructionist themes within a\nnaturalistic framework.\n",
