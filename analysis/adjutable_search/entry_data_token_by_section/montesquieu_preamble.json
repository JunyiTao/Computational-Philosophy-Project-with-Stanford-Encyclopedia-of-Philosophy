    "main_text": "\n\n\nMontesquieu was one of the great political philosophers of the\nEnlightenment. Insatiably curious and mordantly funny, he constructed\na naturalistic account of the various forms of government, and of the\ncauses that made them what they were and that advanced or constrained\ntheir development. He used this account to explain how governments\nmight be preserved from corruption. He saw despotism, in particular,\nas a standing danger for any government not already despotic, and\nargued that it could best be prevented by a system in which different\nbodies exercised legislative, executive, and judicial power, and in\nwhich all those bodies were bound by the rule of law. This theory of\nthe separation of powers had an enormous impact on liberal political\ntheory, and on the framers of the constitution of the United States of\nAmerica.\n",
