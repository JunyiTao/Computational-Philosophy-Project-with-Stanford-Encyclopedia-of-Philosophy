Adorno (1903\u20131969) is the foremost example of this\napproach, and one of the most significant philosophers of music in the\nWestern tradition. A philosopher and sociologist, in 1958 he became\ndirector of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. His dense\nwriting is made more difficult by his frequent and highly technical\nmusicological observations\u2014he was a trained musician and an\nactive composer, having studied with Arnold Schoenberg\u2019s pupil\nAlban Berg (Paddison 1993 and Witkin 1998 are book-length studies of\nAdorno\u2019s philosophy of music; for a shorter overview, see\nHamilton 2007: chapter 6).\n\nA central theme in Adorno\u2019s work is represented by the tension\nbetween the autonomy of the artwork as an aesthetic object and its\nsocial function (Adorno 1970 [1997: 252]). As a member of the\nFrankfurt School, Adorno\u2019s outlook is broadly Marxist, in that\nhe is interested in art as a product of society, as well as in its\npotential as vehicle of social critique.\n\nHowever, Adorno\u2019s advocacy of music as a critical tool does not\nresult in an endorsement of politically engaged music. The critical\nfunction of music is achieved once societal contradictions are\nembodied in the formal features of artworks, as opposed to being\nexplicitly denounced (see for instance Adorno 1970 [1997: 257]).\nAdorno writes:\n\n\nIn all art that is still possible, social critique must be raised to\nthe level of form, to the point that it wipes out all manifestly\nsocial content [Inhalt]. (1970 [1997: 250])\n\n\nAccording to Adorno, art achieves this critical capacity by becoming\nautonomous, that is, by rejecting direct social functions, including\nexplicitly political ones. However, it is not obvious how societal\ndynamics or contradictions could be embodied in works of pure\ninstrumental music (Zangwill 2012: 380\u2013381 is skeptical about\nthis possibility).\n\nIt is this framework that grounds Adorno\u2019s endorsement of\nSchoenberg against Stravinsky, which he develops in his Philosophy\nof New Music (1949). Schoenberg\u2019s atonal music is true to\nthe society that generated it because it rejects tonality, the\npossibilities of which Adorno considers thoroughly explored. Musical\nmaterial is thus historically \u201cpre-formed\u201d, in that the\nuse of tonal structures has a fundamentally different significance\ntoday than it had when tonal music was still developing.\nSchoenberg\u2019s music is progressive because it follows the laws of\ndevelopment intrinsic to the musical material he inherited from\ntradition. Stravinsky instead pulls musical structures from an\nirretrievable past, thereby producing music that is well-crafted, but\nultimately untrue (for a detailed analysis of Adorno\u2019s view of\nSchoenberg and Stravinsky, see Witkin 1998: chapters 7 and 8).\n\nThe attitude just described grounds Adorno\u2019s notorious\nreservations regarding popular music, which he elaborated in a number\nof essays, as well as in his influential Introduction to the\nSociology of Music (1962 [1976]). His view of \u201cjazz\u201d,\na label he employed liberally and at times confusingly (see Gracyk\n1992), and of popular music in general, is that its primary function\nis that of easily available entertainment, despite jazz\u2019s\nattempts to dissimulate this behind musical structures that are only\napparently novel. Standardization is the essential feature of popular\nmusic (Adorno 1962 [1976: 25]), and its result is music that\n\u201clistens for the listener\u201d (Adorno 1962 [1976: 29]), as it\ndoes not require any effort. The invisible hand that standardizes\ntaste and produces art having the sole function of entertaining the\nmasses is the culture industry, a concept which Adorno had elaborated\nin Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), co-authored with Max\nHorkheimer (1895\u20131973) (Horkheimer & Adorno 1947: chapter\n4).\n\nAdorno\u2019s qualms with regard to popular music may understandably\nappear elitist (see Baugh 1990). However, as Martin Jay points\nout,\n\n\nThe real dichotomy, Adorno contended, was not between\n\u201clight\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d music\u2014he was never\na defender of traditional cultural standards for their own\nsake\u2014but rather between music that was market-oriented and music\nthat was not. (Jay 1973: 182)\n\n\nThus, although popular music possesses standardized features that\nfavor its commodification, the culture industry also includes music\nfrom the past that has been commodified and reduced to a mere\ndistraction.\n\nMusic is also related to social change in the thought of the\nunorthodox Marxist philosophy of Ernst Bloch (1885\u20131977). The\nconcepts of utopia and hope are fundamental to his view, which finds\nits chief expression in The Spirit of Utopia (1918) and in\nThe Principle of Hope (1954). \u201cUtopia\u201d refers to\na potential future state to which humanity aspires, whereas hope is\nthe process of striving toward that utopic state. Art creates visions\nof alternative realities which, far from being mere illusions or\ndistractions, have utopian potential.\n\nBloch devotes a central chapter of his Spirit of Utopia to\nmusic, which he conceives of as a concerned with the inward side of\nthe utopian dimension, and thus with humanity\u2019s striving toward\nself-awareness and understanding. The chapter traces the unfolding of\nmusic\u2019s utopian potential in the Western tradition. This\nrestriction in focus seems to follow from an intentionally narrow\nconception of music, motivated by Bloch\u2019s characterization of\nthis art as concerned with the manifestation and development of\ninteriority. He thus denies that civilizations such as the Greek and\nthe Egyptian produced any music worth of interest, because their\nworldview was focused on exteriority and visuality (Bloch 1918,\n\u201cThe Mystery\u201d).\n\nIn Bloch\u2019s reconstruction, Western music develops through three\nstages, or \u201ccarpets\u201d (Teppiche), a concept he\nborrows from Georg Luk\u00e1cs (1885\u20131971) (Bloch 1918,\n\u201cThe Problem of a Historical Philosophy of Music\u201d). The\nfirst stage is represented by dance and chamber music, the second by\nthe music of Bach and Mozart, and particularly by the fugue, while the\nthird culminates in the symphonies of Beethoven and Bruckner. It is\nover the course of this development that music progressively realizes\nhumanity\u2019s awareness of itself (on Bloch\u2019s philosophy of\nmusic, see Zabel 1990, Korstvedt 2010, and Vidal 2003 [2010]).\n",
