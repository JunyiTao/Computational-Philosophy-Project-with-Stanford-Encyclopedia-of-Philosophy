    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || The Anthropological View\n2.4 The Anthropological View \nSome have attempted to respond to the worry about bad or false\nnarratives by introducing a reality constraint to narrative views, one\nthat's buttressed by appeal to third-person storytelling (Lindemann\n2001; Schechtman 2014, Ch. 3).  But allowing third-person narratives\ninto the mix causes a sea change in our enterprise, for it greatly\nbroadens the range of identity-related practical concerns we will need\nto explain.  To see this important point, suppose that we start with a\npurely subjective, first-person narrative account of my identity,\naccording to which I gather together various experiences in my life as\nmine so that I can tell a sensible story unifying the actions for\nwhich I'm morally responsible, the experiences I can rationally\nanticipate having, the burdening experiences for which I can\njustifiably be compensated with benefits, and the expected future\nbenefits or burdens I may prudentially care about.  Notice that\ntelling this unifying story both requires a robust set of\npsychological capacities and incorporates just those actions and\nexperiences I have had (or will have) while in possession of that\nrobust set of psychological capacities, i.e., the story is just about\nmy life as a Lockean person.\nNow I may tell a one-sided or downright false story.  To correct\nthe story, therefore, we may have to check it against third-person\nnarratives of my life.  But third-person narratives are not going to\nbe restricted just to what happened to me while I was a Lockean\nperson.  They will also include things I did or that happened to me\nwhen I was an infant, or even a fetus (\u201cYou kicked so hard\nduring that last month of pregnancy,\u201d says my mother).  And they\nmay well include what happens to me after falling into a PVS (\u201cI\nvisited him every day and talked to him,\u201d says my mother).\nThese are social treatments that also seem grounded by attributions of\nidentity, such as he was my son, or she's still my mom.\nBut neither the Psychological Criterion nor the Biological Criterion\ncan account for them in a straightforward way.\n\nThe Psychological Criterion requires sophisticated psychological\ncapacities, sufficient to sustain continuities of memory, intentions,\nbeliefs, desires, and character.  As neither infants/fetuses nor those\nin PVS have such capacities, this criterion cannot ground these forms\nof social treatment.\nNow one might think the Biological Criterion could easily handle\nsuch cases, but it can't.  That's again because it's not in virtue of\nher being the same human animal that we continue to treat\nsomeone in a PVS or in the end stages of dementia, say, as identical\nto her pre-PVS self.  Rather, it's in virtue of her being the\nsame human animal that we do so.  This is the core of what we\nmay call the Anthropological View, recently advanced and\ndefended by Marya Schechtman (Schechtman 2014).  (Schechtman herself\ncalls this the \u201cperson-life view,\u201d but this label is\nmisleading for our purposes, as what she means by \u201cperson\u201d\nisn't Lockean; for instance, she assigns personhood even to fetuses\nand those in a PVS.  It is preferable, therefore, to stick with the\nanthropological label for the sake of clarity and distinction from the\nother views on the table.)\nOn the Anthropological View, we are human beings, with ways of life\norganized around a particular paradigm: We are creatures who typically\ndevelop in certain ways and are treated in certain ways not only with\nrespect to our inborn biological and psychological features but also\nwith respect to our socially shaped capacities (e.g., being empathic\nand sociable requires nurturing).  Among these capacities are the\n\u201cforensic\u201d capacities Locke and many others have focused\non, having to do with responsibility and prudential concern.  But we\nare also born into families and societies whose members treat us in\nvarious ways, giving us names, dressing us, singing to us, taking\nwalks with us, and so on.  These concerns all track the very same\nmetaphysical unit that gradually becomes responsible and\nconcerned for its own future.  We thus cannot say that the later\nresponsible unit is a different thing, or even a different kind of\nthing, from the infant from which he or she developed.\nInsofar as this is an account that draws from paradigmatic\ncases of humanity to identify our identity conditions, it can allow\nthat, while there are non-paradigmatic cases of humans that may not be\na target of all our practical concerns, they are nevertheless\nindividuals like us and so are certainly appropriate targets\nof some such concerns (like being named, dressed, and sung to).\nThis explains why humans with profound intellectual disabilities and\nthose in a PVS or with Alzheimer's dementia are still individuals like\nus, units whose identity is also defined by the web of our practical\nconcerns (Schechtman 2014, Chs. 5\u20136)\nIndividuals like us, then, are human animals with a particular form\nof life, one whose practices of pregnancy, birth, development, social\ninteraction, personhood, and death both shape and are shaped by the\nparticular attributes and capacities of the individuals living\nit. These human animals are the locus of all of our\n\u201cperson\u201d-related practical concerns, and what makes any\nsuch individual at one time the same as an individual at a later time\nis just that they are living the very same human life.\nIf successful, this Anthropological View would reveal an extremely\ntight relation between our practical concerns and personal\nidentity. Before we assess it, however, we must first examine its\npolar opposite, a view abjuring any such relation between practical\nconcerns and personal identity.\n2.5 The Identity Doesn't Matter View \n\n\nDerek Parfit was among the first contemporary theorists to explore \nthe relation between identity and ethics explicitly, first in his \nseminal early 1970s articles, \u201cPersonal Identity\u201d and \nespecially \u201cLater Selves and Moral Principles,\u201d and then \nin his restatement and development of the view in Part III of his \n1984 book Reasons and Persons (from which the present \nexposition is taken). Parfit's is, in many respects, a Lockean \naccount of personal identity, although there are significant \ndepartures. He is a \u201creductionist,\u201d according to which \nthe facts about persons and personal identity consist in more \nparticular facts about brains, bodies, and series of interrelated \nmental and physical events (Parfit 1984, 210\u2013211). The denial of \nreductionism is called \u201cnonreductionism,\u201d according to \nwhich the facts about persons and personal identity consist in some \nfurther fact, typically a fact about Cartesian egos or souls.\n\n\nWhile Parfit's arguments against nonreductionism and in favor of \nreductionism are striking and important, for our purposes what \nmatters is how he articulates and develops reductionism and how he \nargues for the surprising conclusion that the identity relation is in\nfact not what matters in survival. To begin, he suggests at times \nthat the most plausible reductionist criterion of personal identity \nis the Psychological Criterion. As we saw earlier, this criterion \nmaintains that in order for X to be identical to Y,\nX must be uniquely psychologically continuous\nwith Y. Psychological continuity is potentially a branching,\none-many relation, i.e., it could conceivably hold between me-now and\nmore than one person in the future. But identity is an equivalence\nrelation \u2013 it is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive \u2013\nso it holds only one-one. Thus only by including a \u201cno\nbranching\u201d clause can this criterion of identity avoid a\ncrippling contradiction.\n\n\nBy way of explanation, consider the case Parfit uses in support of \nhis claim that identity is not what matters: fission (Ibid.,\n254\u2013255). Suppose both of my brain hemispheres are functional \nduplicates of the other, and that each of my other two triplet \nbrothers has suffered irreversible brain damage. A brilliant \nneurosurgeon can transplant one of my brain hemispheres into each \nbrother, and so each survivor (we will stipulate) will be fully \npsychologically continuous with me upon waking up. What has happened \nto me? If we lack the \u201cno branching\u201d clause, we are \nforced to say that, because both brothers are psychologically \ncontinuous with me, they are both me. But then (given the \ntransitivity of identity) both survivors would also have to be \nidentical to each other, which seems obviously false \n(although see Belzer 2005 for doubts about this assertion). So to \navoid violating this transitivity requirement, we simply have to \nstipulate in our criterion of personal identity that, if the \nrelations in which identity consists may hold one-many, they must \nobtain uniquely for identity itself to obtain.\n\n\nBut then what has happened to me in fission? It seems I\ncannot survive as both, as they are two people and I am only one. In\naddition, there simply is no non-arbitrary reason why identity should\nobtain between me and just\none of the survivors, given that I bear precisely the same\nrelation to each one.  So the only remaining option is that I do not\nsurvive fission (see Parfit 2001, 42; see also Brink 1997b,\n140\u2013141; and Johansson 2010). But is this like an ordinary case\nin which I don't survive, i.e., like death? Clearly not: both\nsurvivors will seem to remember my thoughts and experiences, they will\nfulfill intentions I had in action, they will have the same\nbeliefs/desires/goals as me, and their characters will be exactly like\nmine. Indeed, it will be just as if I had\nsurvived. Everything that matters in ordinary survival (or nearly\neverything), therefore, is preserved in fission, despite the fact that\nthe identity relation is not. What this must mean, then, is that the\nidentity relation just is not what matters (or is not what matters\nvery much) in survival; instead, what matters has to consist in\npsychological continuity and/or connectedness (what Parfit calls\n\u201cRelation R\u201d). As long as that relation holds\nbetween me-now and some other person-stage \u2013 regardless of\nwhether or not it holds one-one \u2013 what happens to me is just as\ngood as ordinary survival. Call this the Identity Doesn't\nMatter (IDM) view.\n\n\nWhile there are plausible alternative reactions to fission that \nmaintain the importance of the identity relation (see, e.g., Lewis \n1976, Sider 2001a) \u2013 and such views will be explored later \n\u2013 for now it is important to see what Parfit's version would \nmean, if anything, for our practical concerns. What, after all, do we\ndo if identity is not what matters in survival? Given that we have \nfor the most part been assuming that identity is the relation \ngrounding our patterns of concern, we are now faced with two options:\neither we take those patterns of concern to be unjustified \nor we find new grounds for them. In Reasons and Persons, \nParfit is officially agnostic on the proper approach (he claims that \narguments for both stances are defensible, yet also can be defensibly\ndenied; see Parfit 1984, 311\u2013312). Nevertheless, it surely seems most\nplausible to retain the patterns of concern formerly grounded on \nidentity and simply find a new justification for them. And it seems \nobvious that Relation R could provide such a justification. After \nall, if we formerly thought identity justified these patterns insofar\nas it was what we thought mattered for survival, but it turns out \nthat identity \u2013 Relation R plus uniqueness \u2013 is not what \nmatters only because uniqueness is not what matters, then it\nseems natural and plausible to cite the remaining \naspect of identity (Relation R) as what grounds our patterns of \nconcern in virtue of being what truly matters in survival (see, e.g.,\nJeske 1993). How, in other words, could \nuniqueness have provided all the relevant justifications?\nIndeed, Parfit himself seems drawn to such a conclusion in the\ndiscussion of rationality and morality that follows. He calls it\nthe Moderate Claim (Parfit 1984, 311).  (This is in contrast to\nthe Extreme Claim, which is that the further fact of identity\nis what grounds our practical concerns, so to the extent there is no\nsuch further fact, our practical concerns are ungrounded.)\n\n\nSo let us assume that Relation R grounds our patterns of concern. \nConsider, then, prudential rationality. While it is ordinarily \nthought to be imprudent to discount the interests of one's Much Later\nSelf (MLS) just because that self will not come into existence for a \nlong time, Parfit suggests that reductionism provides a different, \nmore plausible reason to do so. Since one of the relations in R \n(connectedness) obtains by degrees, it is very likely it will obtain \nto a much reduced degree between me-now and my MLS than it will \nbetween me-now and my tomorrow's self. But if R grounds my patterns \nof concern, and a reduced degree of connectedness is one part of R, \nthen a reduced degree of connectedness justifies a reduced degree of \nconcern. Thus, I may be justified in caring much less about my MLS \nthan about my tomorrow's self. This conclusion justifies \ndiscounting my MLS's (expected) interests in favor of my present \ninterests.\n\n\nOf course, given that we still think great imprudence is wrong, how \nmight we criticize it if we made these revisions to our practices? \nOne way to do so would be to recognize that, since my MLS would \nreally be more like a different person than me, he should be treated \nas such, i.e., how I treat him should now fall under the rubric of \nmorality, and insofar as it is wrong to harm others without \ntheir consent, it would be wrong for me to harm him as well. Great \nimprudence like this, in other words, would be immoral \n(Parfit 1984, 318\u2013320).\n\n\nParfit's theory has often been called \u201crevisionary,\u201d in \npart because of moves like this one (see, e.g., Rovane 1998, 11; \nMartin 1998, 15). The thought is that both his theory of identity and\nits implications for our prudential and moral practices and concerns \nrequire us to change our views both of ourselves and of what matters.\nBut this judgment may be mistaken. After all, Parfit seems to be \ntrying to show that (a) what in fact matters to us in \nsurvival (revealed by the fission case) is Relation R, not identity, \nand (b) what these antecedent commitments about survival imply about \nprudence and morality is that the wrongness we currently attach to \ngreat imprudence should merely be called a wrongness of \nmorality. But in neither case is there any call for revision of \nanything substantive in our views of ourselves or in our normative \npractices. Indeed, people simply are less concerned with \ntheir MLSs than with their tomorrow-selves, and it is not difficult \nto see why: if they cannot imagine being the self in \nquestion, it is extremely difficult either to imagine what that \nself's interests are or to take those interests into account equally \nwith their more closely related stages in practical deliberation. But\nwhat generally enables that act of projective imagination is the \nexpectation of a significant degree of psychological connectedness, \nso the less there is expected to be of that relation, the less our \nconcern for those distant stages is likely to be. This suggests, \nthen, that Parfit's view is less revisionary than \nrevelatory: he may be taken to be providing a clear-headed \ndescription of our practices and commitments, and in so doing \nrevealing to us just what those practices and commitments actually \ninvolve and entail for other aspects of our lives (although see the \ndiscussion of the various articles by Mark Johnston later on for \nconsiderations to the contrary).\n2.6 Assessing Theories of Personal Identity in Light of Fission \nFission is a challenge to any theory of personal identity that\npurports to preserve a tight relation between identity and our\npractical concerns. The Psychological Criterion will be a clear\ncasualty, for instance.  As for the Biological Criterion, it seems\nmost plausible, in light of fission, to adopt an extreme version of\nthe IDM stance, maintaining (as does Olson 1997, as noted earlier)\nthat our numerical identity just doesn't ground our practical concerns\nat all (which are instead a function of a \u201csame person\nrelation\u201d that need not adhere to the demands of a strict\nnumerical identity relation).\nWhat, though, about the Anthropological View?  Schechtman offers an\ninteresting take on fission: Such a procedure hasn't yet occurred, so\nwithout filling in the social conditions and practices we can't state\nin advance what the identity of the survivors would be.  If fission\nhappened all the time, all of those future humans would likely be very\ndifferent sorts of creatures from us, as they would be living a\ndifferent form of life, and so the identity conditions for individuals\nlike us simply wouldn't apply to them.  If it happened only\nonce or very rarely, the survivors would be sufficiently like us (as\nwe could still engage with them interpersonally, and our interactions\nwith them could still make sense from within our current form of life)\nthat they would be one of us, but they couldn't be identical to the\noriginal person.  This is because there would be such a huge range of\ndifferences in how they would be treated \u2013 by the spouse, children,\nfriends, bank, and employer of the pre-fission person \u2013 that each\nperson's relation to the pre-fission person would now just be too\ndifferent to count as identity (Schechtman 2014, 159\u2013166).  The\nAnthropological View thus seems as if it can deal with fission while\nnevertheless preserving a tight relation between identity and\npractical concerns.\nIt seems difficult to arbitrate between the IDM and the\nAnthropological View, and one reason is that they seem to be taking\ndifferent methodological approaches to identifying the identity\nconditions for different kinds of entities.  Regarding the latter,\nParfit asks the first-person question, \u201cWhat matters\nto me in fission?\u201d and this presupposes that we are\ntalking about the type of creatures (pre- and post-fission) that are\nindividuals like us in terms of our full-fledged forensic (Lockean\npersonhood) capacities.  Schechtman, on the other hand, asks the\nthird-person question, about how such fission products would be\ntreated, which allows for their being creatures who are indeed\ndifferent from us.  Furthermore, Schechtman is interested in\nidentifying (from the start) the unified locus of our practical\nconcerns and then subsequently figuring out that thing's\nidentity conditions, whereas Parfit is interested in what antecedent\ntheories of personal identity would imply for our practical\nconcerns in light of fission.  This latter difference in methodology\nwill be discussed in a later section.  The former difference in the\nobject of our practical concerns, however, may be irreconcilable.\nIndeed, from my perspective in fission, once I'm a Lockean\nperson, it may seem that nothing internal to that perspective will be\nlost (holding instead twice over).  But I can also understand how\ndifferently the survivors might well be treated in a number of\nrespects by others.  It may thus be unclear which perspective we ought\nto privilege here.\n2.7 Nonreductionism \n\n\nWe have just examined the leading contemporary theories of \npersonal identity (or what matters in personal identity), and we have\nalso explored how those views might relate to ethics. But we have \nthus far ignored what may be the most popular theory of identity \noutside philosophy (and a view that a minority of \nphilosophers still accept as well). This is nonreductionism, according to \nwhich persons exist separately and independently from their brains \nand bodies, and so their lives are unified from birth to death in \nvirtue of that separately existing entity, what we will call a \nCartesian ego (but is most popularly thought of as a soul). And \nalthough there is logical space available for a nonreductionism \naccording to which identity isn't what matters for survival \nand our practical concerns, the universal view is instead the \nopposite. Notice, then, that this view implies both a deep unity \nwithin individual lives and a deep disunity between lives. \nAfter all, if what unifies my life is a particular persisting \nego-substance, and that substance is wholly present at every stage of\nmy life, then every temporal slice of my life is just as much a part \nof me as every other, so if prudential concern is grounded in \nidentity, for example, I ought to be equally concerned for every part\nof my life. Further, given that my particular ego-substance is \ndistinct from every other person's particular ego-substance, my \nspecial prudential concern justifiably ends at the boundaries of my \nepidermis (or at the \u201cboundaries\u201d of my ego).\n\n\nNow one important problem for this view is that it is very difficult \nto see why my patterns of concern should track this particular ego, \nand not instead the psychological features constituting Relation R. \nWhat is it about this substance that warrants my special \nprudential concern, for example? If it is in virtue of its function as the \ncarrier of the various psychological connections, then we \nmight well wonder why we shouldn't just care directly for those \nconnections, rather than merely for the \u201chouse\u201d they \nlive in. But if we make that move, then we have already switched to \nreductionism, it seems, and because those direct psychological \nconnections may hold one-many, identity cannot be what matters.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the nonreductionist might insist that I am \njustified in having special concern for my future ego simply insofar \nas it is the only thing that will be me, regardless of \nwhether or not Relation R is preserved by or within it. On this \naccount, then (what Parfit 1984, 228 calls the \u201cFeatureless \nCartesian View\u201d), who I am \u2013 my essential identity \n\u2013 is independent of any particular psychological properties. \nBut if identity is entirely prized apart from psychology in this way,\nand if the ego to be tracked is an immaterial substance (as it is, of\ncourse, on the Cartesian version), we are left with two related \npuzzles. First, if the particular ego I now have (or am) can be \nperceived or identified neither directly, via some empirical means, \nnor indirectly, via a particular set of psychological properties it \nmight be thought to evince, then we actually have no reason to \nbelieve that there is just one such ego unifying the various\nstages of our lives. Instead, our bodies might get a new, \nqualitatively identical ego every year on our birthdays, or perhaps \nevery day, or perhaps there is a river of them flowing through us \nfrom moment to moment. If this were to happen, then I would \ncease to exist, replaced by a qualitatively identical person who then\ninherits my psychological properties. But no one would even notice! \nThis would be rather odd, to say the least, and this is because of \nthe connection we think should obtain between our metaphysical \ncriterion of personal identity and our epistemological criterion of \npersonal identity. In other words, we tend to think there is a close \nconnection between the nature of personal identity and what enables \nus to determine when identity obtains. So if what makes \nX and Y identical is sameness of body, it will also\nbe our reidentification of that body which enables us to determine \nthat X is Y. Similarly, if what makes X \nand Y identical is some kind of psychological continuity, \nthen determining that X and Y are identical will be\na matter of determining whether psychological continuity obtains \nbetween them. Now in both the body and the psychology cases, we have \nthe capacity to do the tracking in question. If the Featureless \nCartesian View is correct, though, we do not. We cannot track \nimmaterial egos floating free from any particular psychological \nproperties, so on this view we would never be justified in claiming \nto have reidentified anyone, nor would we be justified in claiming \nspecial concern for some future stage of our bodies: in both cases, \nwe could have no reason whatsoever for thinking that the persons in \nquestion were who we thought they were (Perry 1978, 6\u201318; Parfit \n1984, 228).\n\n\nNow the defender of the view might maintain that, given the\ncorrectness of the metaphysical criterion, we should simply abandon\nour desire for epistemic access to identity. And it is indeed the case\nthat this version of nonreductionism could be true: There is simply no\nway to show that I am not, after all, an essentially immaterial\nsubstance unattached to any particular psychological properties. But\nif this true, and there becomes no way to make justified judgments of\nidentity, then the second problem is that the theory is\njust irrelevant for all practical purposes. We in fact make\njudgments of identity and reidentification based on physical and\npsychological properties \u2013 we lack the capacity to do anything\nelse \u2013 so even if the Featureless Cartesian View were true, it\nwould be useless in addressing any of our practical concerns. If,\nthen, we want to articulate a useful relation between\npersonal identity and ethics, we may have to abandon nonreductionism,\nor at least nonreductionism of the \u201cseparately existing\nentities\u201d sort (technically, Schechtman's Anthropological View\nis a non-reductionist view, as it does insist that the facts about\nidentity consist in facts beyond just facts about brains and bodies,\nbut these aren't non-trackable facts like those of the Featureless\nCartesian; they are instead facts about social treatment and\nengagement).\n2.8 Four-Dimensionalism \n\n\nLet us turn briefly now to a very general position, a possible \nversion of reductionism according to which identity nevertheless \nstill matters. This view is typically defended by advocates of \nfour-dimensionalism, according to which objects have both \nspatial and temporal parts (see, e.g., Lewis 1971, 1976; \nNoonan 1989; Sider 2001a). This view allows one to say that, in the \nfission case, both post-fission people existed all along, completely \ncoinciding spatially pre-fission (so that each shared that temporal \nstretch of his life with the other). In other words, they might be \nlike two distinct roads that coincide for a while before separating \noff in different directions. Thus, if both post-fission person-stages\nare stages of the same person as the pre-fission stages (but there \nare indeed two distinct persons all along), then one can maintain the\nthesis that the identity relation is what matters, for now identity \nis also preserved through fission (whereas in Parfit's version while \nwhat matters is preserved through fission, identity is not).\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean identity is really what matters. \nPerhaps instead the identity relation merely always \naccompanies, but is not constitutive of, what matters. \nIndeed, this point may be pressed on the four-dimensionalist. Why, \nafter all, would it be identity that matters in my relation \nto some future person-stage? Suppose we regularly lived to be 1000 \nyears old. On the four-dimensionalist account, I now would be unified\nwith \u2013 I would be part of the same spacetime worm as \u2013 my\n900-year-old self. But it is extraordinarily difficult, if not \npsychologically impossible, for me to project myself into his shoes, \nfor I expect him to be radically different, psychologically, from me.\nThere would be between us, then, virtually nothing of what \nactually matters in ordinary survival, despite the obtaining of \nidentity. Of course, one might maintain instead that it is some \nstrong degree of psychological connectedness that provides the unity \nrelation between various temporal stages, but then it seems explicit \nthat the relation preserving what matters is just connectedness, not \nidentity per se. There is much more to say about this view, of \ncourse (see, e.g., Belzer 2005), and we will return to it later.\n3. Prudential and Moral Units\n\n\nStrictly speaking, a metaphysical criterion of identity has no direct\nimplications whatsoever for normative matters, simply because what is\nthe case implies nothing about what ought to be the case. What people\nwho seek a relation between identity and ethics typically do, then, \nis appeal to considerations of identity to fill in some key blank \nregarding what the  ethically significant metaphysical units\nare. In other words, certain conclusions about identity are taken to \ninform us as to just what unifies the targets of prudential and moral\ntheorizing. Consider prudence, for example. In deliberating about \nwhat is in my best interest, what is needed is some conception of the\nscope of the \u201cmy\u201d in question, i.e., what unit \nmy deliberations are to cover. Similarly, with respect to moral \nresponsibility, we need to know whether the agent subject to \npraise or blame for some action is part of the same unit as the agent\nwho performed that action.\n\n\nBut notice that a specification of possible metaphysical unities alone\nwill not be sufficient, for what we need in addition is a\nspecification of which such unities are significant for\nethics. To see why this is an issue, consider just reductionism.\nReductionism is actually quite a general metaphysical view, holding at\nits most basic that the facts about identity simply consist in more\nparticular facts about brains, bodies, and so forth. But even if one\naccepts reductionism, and so abandons appeal to some further fact\nabout separately existing entities to explain personal identity, and\neven if one also believes that identity is not what matters in\nsurvival, one still has much work to do before being able to apply the\ntheory to ethics. This is because there are (at least) four\npossible metaphysical units that could be targeted for normative\ntheorizing. First, we might target living human beings, human\norganisms picked out by the Biological Criterion (and to some extent\nthe Anthropological View) and unified over time via biological\ncontinuity. These entities would endure from some early-stage fetuses\nuntil organismic death. Second, we might target Lockean\npersons, entities picked out by the Psychological Criterion\nand unified over time by psychological continuity (overlapping chains\nof strong psychological connectedness). These entities would endure\nfrom late infancy (or the time at which the various psychological\nconnections could be established) to brain death or perhaps\ndementia. Third, we might target selves, entities unified by\nstrong psychological connectedness. Such units would have significant\nduration, but they would not be likely to endure for as long as\npersons \u2013 insofar as memories typically fade, beliefs and\ndesires are lost or revised over time, and so forth \u2013 and they\ncertainly wouldn't endure as long as the life of the human being of\nwhich they were a part. Fourth, we might target atoms, or\nmomentary experiencers, \u201cunits\u201d defined and delimited by\nthe duration of an experience. It could be, after all, that if the\ndeep fact of identity is missing, there just are no other relations of\nsignificance we could legitimately substitute for it, so all that\nremains would be merely the basic atomic moments of people's\nlives. (For discussion of the last three possible units, see D.\nShoemaker 1999, 401; for a similar distinction, see Brink 1997b,\n110\u2013115, where he labels these last three possible units\n\u201cpersons,\u201d \u201cperson-segments,\u201d and\n\u201cperson-slices.\u201d)\n\n\nSo it is not enough that we articulate the various possible \nmetaphysical units. We must also figure out a way to identify \nwhich one we ought to target for ethics (or whether just one will do \nthe trick for all relevant forms of ethical theorizing). So in its \npurely metaphysical guise, reductionism must settle merely for \npresenting these four alternatives, remaining officially neutral on \nwhich one the ethicists should adopt. This two-step process \u2013 \nidentifying the possible metaphysical units, then narrowing down the \nlist to the ethically significant metaphysical units \u2013\nis often overlooked by those wishing to adopt metaphysical \nconclusions in their normative theorizing, but both steps are \nimportant (a notable exception to those who overlook this point is \nBrink; see his 1990, 1997a, and 1997b).\n\n\nOnce we make the switch from talk of identity to talk of unity \nrelations as being ethically significant, however, things can also \nget quite complicated. For there seems no reason in principle why two\nof the contending intrapersonal unity relations \u2013 psychological\ncontinuity and connectedness \u2013 could not also hold \ninterpersonally. That is, not only could psychological \ncontinuity, say, hold one-many, between me-now and more than one \nperson in the future, but it could also hold between me-now and other\nspatially distinct, simultaneously-existing persons (Brink 1997a, \n141\u2013143, 1997b, 125\u2013128). And the same could be true as well of \npsychological connectedness. At least \nsome of the psychological relations making up connectedness and \ncontinuity can obviously obtain interpersonally, e.g., sameness of \nbeliefs/desires/goals, and resemblance of character. But it also \nseems perfectly possible that memories and intentions may be shared \nbetween persons, produced by some common cause (Ibid.). \nRecognizing these connections widens the boundaries of what counts as\na targeted unit (and in so doing it may also blur the boundaries \nbetween prudence and morality), but the ensuing messiness may not be \nworth it. After all, if the proper ethical unit is a self, say, \nunified by psychological connectedness, which obtains by degrees, \nthat means that my unity with many others \u2013 and with future \nstages of myself \u2013 will be only partial, obtaining to various \npeople in varying degrees. But if these are the units targeted by \nethics, how do we mark their boundaries such that the moral concepts \nand principles coherently apply (McMahan 2002, 62)? In addition, who \nexactly would the practical agents in question be, where people are \nmore or less unified with each other (Brink 1997b, 113\u2013114)? And \nthere may also be worries about how to apply moral concepts admitting\nof no scalar dimensions \u2013 like promises \u2013 to moral units \n\u2013 like selves \u2013 that do (Williams 1976, 202\u2013204). These \nquestions (and more) pose genuine challenges for accounts allowing \nfor interpersonal unities.\nPerhaps in order to avoid these and other problems, Marya\nSchechtman proposes her Anthropological View as driven by the question\nof what units are the proper object of all of our\nperson-related practical concerns.  As already noted, she thinks the\nonly way to unite all of them is by focusing on the human animal, one\nthat lives our form of life.  This allows her to say that the fetus is\nthe same thing as the infant, which is the same as the teenager, the\nadult, and the demented grandparent, one individual treated as the\nsame locus of a host of practical concerns over the course of that\nlife.  This view effectively blocks the possibilities, raised above,\nof some concerns cutting across individual lives, but this may prevent\nthe Anthropological View from being able to explain some features of\ncommonsense morality that the interpersonal unities view can.\n4. Identity and Normative Ethics\n\n\nWe have already seen some ways in which considerations of personal \nidentity might be relevant to self-regarding arenas like \nanticipation and prudential concern. We turn now to examine specific ways \nin which personal identity may have implications for the \nother-regarding practical concerns discussed in various arenas of \nmoral philosophy. One of the most widely discussed in the \nliterature thus far has been ethical theory. Most of those working in\nthe field to this point have been appealing to considerations of \nidentity to boost the plausibility of consequentialism, and, more \nspecifically, utilitarianism. There are various ways in which such an\nattempt proceeds.\n\n\nFirst, one might identify a serious objection to utilitarianism, say,\nand then show how considerations of personal identity (or at least of\nwhat matters in identity) dissolve the objection. This is \nthe approach Parfit takes in Reasons and Persons. The \nobjection he is concerned to refute is Rawls' famous \n\u201cseparateness of persons\u201d charge, the contention that \nutilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinction between \npersons, because it controversially jettisons interpersonal \ndistributive principles in exactly the way we uncontroversially \njettison them intrapersonally (Rawls 1971, 22\u201327). That is, in \nextending the principle of rational choice to society-wide \ndecision-making (via use of the imagined impartial spectator), \nutilitarianism treats the interests of all members of society as if \nthey were the interests of one person, and so conflates different \npersons into one. What Parfit suggests is that, if the objection \ndepends on a hard-and-fast metaphysical distinction between persons \n(i.e., on the non-identity of different persons), and if this \ndistinction depends on the further fact of identity \u2013 a \nnonexistent fact if reductionism is true \u2013 then the distinction\nis nothing to take seriously in the first place. Utilitarians, in \nother words, may be reductionists, justifiably ignoring the \n\u201cdistinctness\u201d between persons \u2013 and the \ndistributive principles such a distinction might support \u2013 \nbecause the non-identity of persons is just a less deep fact (Parfit \n1984, 329\u2013345; see also Broome 1991 for a reductionist-based argument\nin support of utilitarianism's account of goodness).\n\n\nThe success of arguments for this conclusion actually depends on the specific \nversion of reductionism being advanced. After all, there are\nseveral possible ethically significant metaphysical units compatible\nwith reductionism, and it turns out that the larger the unit, the less\nsuccessful the argument will be. As the authors on this topic do, we\nwill focus just on the three possible psychological units:\npersons, selves, and atoms. If one believes that the only relevant\nunits are atoms (momentary experiencers) \u2013 given that in the\nabsence of the further fact of identity one believes there\njust are no other unifying relations of any significance\n(i.e., Parfit's Extreme Claim) \u2013 then it is easy to see the\ncomplete analogy between individual lives and sets of lives: neither\nare unified by any significant metaphysical relations, so we could\nthink of them both as just big collections of experiences, in which\ncase there would seem to be no reason to apply distributive principles\nwithin either (or, alternatively, no reason not to apply such\nprinciples to both \u2013 how much weight they ought to bear\nin that case would remain open, however). But notice that if one\nadopts either of the other two psychology-based versions of\nreductionism, according to which either selves or persons are the\nbasic moral units, the argument may not be as successful. If, for\ninstance, it is psychological continuity that matters instead of the\nfurther fact of identity \u2013 and matters just as much as identity\nwas thought to (i.e., Parfit's Moderate Claim) \u2013 then persons are\nthe ethically significant metaphysical units, but then there remains a\nmetaphysical distinction between persons, for psychological\ncontinuity, in the absence of interpersonal connectedness, fails to\nunify sets of lives in the way it does individual lives (see Jeske\n1993, Brink 1997a). And the same goes for strong psychological\nconnectedness, which would unify selves in a way rendering\nthem metaphysically distinct from sets of lives.\n\n\nIt looks, then, as if the only way to bolster support for \nutilitarianism (with a version of this argument, anyway) is \nto adopt the extreme view, that the ethically significant metaphysical \nunits are momentarily-existing person-atoms. But this is implausible,\nfor it is very difficult even to make sense of a momentary \nagent. Agents, after all, have interests and projects they \nseek to advance that necessarily project them into the future. In \norder to be what one is at any moment, then, one must identify with \none's future. \u201cWhen the person is viewed as an agent, no clear \ncontent can be given to the idea of a merely present self\u201d \n(Korsgaard 1989, 114; see also Williams 1976, 204\u2013207, and Brink \n1997b, 112\u2013113). But if one moves away from atoms as the basic moral \nunits for these sorts of practical reasons, the separation between \nselves/persons and sets of lives becomes more distinct.\n\nUnless, that is, one allows that the relations that matter \nin identity can hold interpersonally, in which case a number of \ninteresting possibilities arise. For instance, Brink argues that the \npossibility of interpersonal continuity supports a kind of \nconsequentialism via rational egoism. If one is a rational egoist, \none will aim to promote one's own good. What counts as one's \nown, though \u2013 what counts as contained within the \nprudentially significant metaphysical unit \u2013 given \nreductionism, is defined by psychological continuity (Brink argues \nagainst the coherence or practical feasibility of both atoms and \nselves as the basic units). But if continuity also holds \ninterpersonally, then the rational egoist must, if truly rational, \npromote the good of all those with whom he is continuous, which, \ngiven the thought that each of us bears only six degrees of \nseparation from every other person, generates an important kind of \nimpartial, universalist consequentialism: \u201cthe egoist \ncan recognize derivative but non-instrumental reason to be concerned \nabout others\u201d (Brink 1997b, 127). Of course, if the utter \nimpartiality of a universalist consequentialism is implausible for \nthe way it overlooks the importance to us of the special concern we \nhave for friends and loved ones, perhaps one can introduce the idea \nof degrees of continuity, in which case the concern the \negoist must have for others \u201cis proportional to the amount of \npsychological continuity that exists between the agent and \nothers\u201d (Ibid., 128; see also McMahan 2002, 59\u201366).\n\n\nOf course, while connectedness clearly comes in degrees, it is less \nclear that continuity does. For one thing, if continuity \nconsists in strong connectedness, and what makes for such strength is\nthe obtaining of an amount of direct psychological connections above \nsome specified threshold (as it does for Parfit 1984, 206), then \ncontinuity is not a matter of degree: either strong connectedness \nobtains at each link in the chain or it does not (Belzer 2005). But \neven if we allow that some links in the chain may be weaker than \nothers, if what matters is the existence of the chain, it is\ndifficult to see why its strength in certain patches is relevant. In \nother words, even if we allow that continuity comes in degrees, it is\nnot entirely clear why our patterns of concern ought to track the \namount and not simply the fact of continuity. \nIndeed, if what matters is supposed to be the degree of continuity, \nit might seem to make more sense simply to focus on the more \nobviously scalar relation in which continuity consists, viz., \nconnectedness, as delivering the units of significance in \nthe form of selves.\n\n\nWhile focus on selves could perhaps yield a very complicated form of \nconsequentialism (involving the introduction into deliberation of the\ngood of all affected parties \u2013 including future selves \u2013 \nweighted according to the degrees of connectedness obtaining between \nthem and the deliberator), another, perhaps more promising, approach \nwould be to appeal to reductionist selves to buttress a different \nethical theory altogether, namely contractualism. One longstanding \nobjection to the theory is that it has no way of motivating the \namoralist to adhere to the demands of morality. But we can assume \nthat the amoralist is at least prudentially rational. If so, then one\nvery plausible way to model ordinary prudential deliberation is as \nconsisting of a desire that one's actions be justifiable to all \naffected future stages of oneself (see, e.g., McClennen 1990, 217). \nBut if the relation that matters in identity is connectedness, it \nshould ground such prudential concern in a way that restricts \nrequired justification only to those stages with whom one expects to \nbe connected. Then if connectedness holds interpersonally, the \nrational amoralist must also extend that desire for justifiability to\nall those with whom he is psychologically connected, and this will \ntake him a long ways towards having the moral motivation at the heart\nof contractualism (D. Shoemaker 2000; \nfor the basic view of contractualism presupposed here, see Scanlon \n1982 and 1998).\n\n\nThe views documented thus far all appeal to psychology-based versions\nof the ethically significant metaphysical units. What, though, of\nbiology-based versions? One thought motivating nonconsequentialism\nover consequentialism has to do with compensation:\nnonconsequentialists think it would be unfair to compensate one basic\nmoral unit for a burden undergone by another such unit, something\nwhich consequentialism allegedly permits (Jeske 1993). Here the\nnon-identity of different basic moral units is significant. But what\nare the moral units relevant to issues of compensation? These are most\noften thought to be psychological units, typically reductionist\npersons. But why not think these basic units are instead human\nbeings, individual animal organisms unified by biological\ncontinuity? One reason to do so stems from consideration of cases in\nwhich a child has been made worse off by some burden undergone when\nshe was a fetus, e.g., her mother drank (giving her fetal alcohol\nsyndrome) or her mother's physician was negligent. Here she is owed\ncompensation, we might think, for what happened to her before\nbirth. (And analogous cases might be constructed with respect to\nhumans who become non-persons, perhaps by going into a PVS.) Such\ncases might then suggest that, if compensation presupposes personal\nidentity (or what matters in identity), then the criterion of identity\nrelevant to compensation is biological, in which case ethical theories\ntargeting only psychological units are incomplete (D. Shoemaker 2007,\n338).\n\n\nAs we can see, then, one may deploy reductionism about personal\nidentity in very different ways to achieve very different results for\nethical theory, depending on the basic metaphysical units one\ntargets. Of course, there may simply be no single relation appropriate\nfor grounding all our patterns of concern, i.e., some\npatterns of concern may be grounded in biological continuity, some may\nbe grounded in psychological continuity or connectedness, and some may\ntarget simple momentary experiences. If this is the case, then it may\nbe difficult to see what general uniform conclusions, if any, can be\ndrawn for ethical theory (see Shoemaker 2007; this is what Schechtman\n2014 (80\u201388) calls the Problem of Multiplicity).\n5. Identity and Moral Responsibility\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Locke thought the personal identity relation was, \nin effect, an accountability relation: what makes Y\nat t2 the same person as X at \nt1 is just what makes Y accountable\n\u2013 morally responsible \u2013 for X's actions. Now this\ngeneral account of moral responsibility won't do without immmediate\nsupplementation. After all, various excuses (e.g., brainwashing,\ninvoluntary intoxication) may serve to get one off the accountability\nhook even if one is identical to the original agent.  So let us\nsuppose, then, that Locke thought one is accountable, in the\nabsence of excuse, for all and only those actions performed by\nsomeone with whom one is identical. Is this true?\n\n\nThere is widespread agreement that identity is at least a necessary\ncondition for accountability. The way this idea is most often\nexpressed is that one can be responsible only for one's own\nactions. Sometimes this is put more expansively: I can be responsible\nfor my own actions, and I cannot be responsible for anyone else's\nactions (Sider 2001, 4, 143, 203\u2013204; Schechtman 1996, 14; Olson\n1997, 59). But these ways of putting the matter are just supposed to\nbe a gloss on the philosophical slogan that moral responsibility\npresupposes personal identity (Butler 1736, 99\u2013105; Reid 1785,\n107\u2013118; DeGrazia 2005, 88\u201389; Glannon 1998; Parfit 1984,\n323\u2013326; Parfit 1986, 837\u2013843).\n\n\nNow one might think that there are obvious counterexamples to the\nslogan: parents are sometimes held responsible for the actions of\ntheir children, and accomplices are held responsible for the crimes\ncommitted by others. An easy reply, however, is that in each case the\nperson being held responsible is actually responsible only for\nwhat he or she did. For example, the parent is being held \nresponsible, not for what his child did, but for his (in)action in \nletting the child do what she did, say, or for his poor \nparenting. And the accomplice is being held responsible, not for what \nthe criminal did, but for what the accomplice did in aiding the \ncriminal. So in both cases there is some properly specified action \nfor which it seems only the person identical to the actor may be held\nresponsible.\n\n\nNevertheless, there are serious problems with the slogan.  To see why,\nnote that we are looking for an answer to the following question:\nwhat makes a past action my own for purposes of responsibility?\nThe answer given by most theorists, following Locke, is that an action\nis my own just in case I am identical to the person who performed\nit. So what account of personal identity provides the right criterion\nof what makes an action one's own? Locke's memory criterion fails, for\nsome actions can be one's own even if one no longer remembers\nperforming them, due to drunkenness, repression, trauma, or the like\n(Schechtman 2005, 12; see also Bradford and Smith 1979). In addition,\nmemory isn't sufficient for ownership of actions. Were someone else's\nmemory trace of doing something immoral copied into my brain (so that\nI \u201cremembered\u201d that person's action), it would be silly to\nthink that it was mine for purposes of accountability, or that I was\nsomehow thereby identical to the performer of that action (Schechtman\n2005, 12).\n\n\nWhat of the Biological Criterion?  On an application of that view, some\npast action is mine for purposes of accountability just in case I am\nbiologically continuous with its agent.  But this again seems neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for ownership.  Were my cerebrum transplanted\ninto another's biological organism, such that that person were now\nfully psychologically continuous with me, it seems that ownership of\nmy actions would have been transferred as well, such that my cerebrum\ninheritor now is eligible for accountability for my actions, despite\nhis not being biologically continuous with me.  Furthermore, were\nimmoral Johann to enter a fugue state, yielding a biological successor\n(call him Sebastian) who was nevertheless completely psychologically\ndiscontinuous with Johann, it would be hard to believe Sebastian could\ncontinue to be the owner of Johann's actions, despite their biological\ncontinuity (D. Shoemaker 2011).\n\n\nThe natural move, then, is to apply the Psychological Criterion to the\ncriterion of ownership relevant to responsibility (see, e.g., Glannon\n1998, 231, 237\u2013243). This criterion requires a wider variety and a\ngreater number of psychological connections than does the memory\ncriterion, and so it can sidestep the worries attaching to Locke's\naccount, while also emphasizing that psychological, not biological,\nrelations are what matter for responsibility. According to this view,\nthen, some past action is my own (for purposes of accountability) just\nin case the person who performed the action is uniquely\npsychologically continuous with me (where this consists in overlapping\nchains of strong psychological connectedness).\n\n\nNevertheless, this view also has some problems. For one thing, it's\nunclear that psychological continuity alone is sufficient for\nownership. Suppose Johann's fugue state (turning into the\npsychologically very different Sebastian) developed gradually, as the\nresult of a brain tumor.  We still would likely deny that Sebastian is\nthe owner of Johann's actions, despite their now psychological\ncontinuity.  And it also seems possible that psychological continuity\nisn't necessary for ownership either. Suppose someone were to undergo\na brain trauma causing psychological discontinuity. Depending on how\nthe case were filled in, it may be that certain actions performed\nprior to the discontinuity would still be judged hers in the relevant\nsense. As long as they flowed from a central aspect of the agent's\ncharacter that remained in place, we might say, they are properly\nattributable to her regardless of the other psychological\ndiscontinuities that have taken place.\n\n\nIt is in part because of these sorts of worries that Schechtman \nsuggests abandoning the search for identity in the reidentification \nsense in favor of identity in the characterization sense. What we're \nlooking for, after all, is an account of what makes some past action \nmy own. But looking for an answer to this question via something like\nthe Psychological Criterion is too indirect: it has us attributing \nthe action to some past person first and then trying to determine \nwhether or not the person to be assessed as responsible is one and \nthe same as that past agent. But if the action cannot be attributed \nto the allegedly responsible person directly, the relation \nbetween the two person-slices just isn't strong enough to warrant \nresponses like punishment and blame (Schechtman 1996, 90\u201391; 2005, \n13).\n\n\nNevertheless, all of these theories, including narrative identity, fall prey to the \nfission case. Suppose X were to \nrob a bank and then undergo fission, dividing into Y and \nZ, both of whom were psychologically continuous with \nX. Both Y and Z would seem to remember \nX's theft, they would still be buzzing over the thrill of \nthe getaway chase, they would each have inherited an intention to \nspend the money on wine, women, and song, they would each persist in \nX's beliefs about the justification for the crime, and so \nforth. We would likely think the crime to be properly attributable to\nboth of them, and so hold them both (at least partially) responsible \nfor it. Yet neither could be numerically identical to \nX, and if identity is a necessary condition of \nresponsibility, neither could be morally responsible for his crime. \nBut this seems the wrong answer.\n\n\nThere are two plausible replies, both familiar by now. On the one \nhand, we can go four-dimensionalist (as does Sider 2001a), and hold that \nY and Z are indeed two people who were, \nessentially, present all along, overlapping in all their spatial \nparts during the temporal stage of the life when they were both known\nas \u201cX.\u201d This allows us to preserve the slogan\nthat one person cannot be responsible for the actions of another \n\u2013 in other words, it is indeed numerical identity that\nis necessary for responsibility \u2013 while also preserving the \nthought that it is the robust psychological relation that obtains \nbetween the various parties that grounds our belief that X \nhas not gotten away with his crime just by undergoing fission.\n\n\nNevertheless, this option has some uncomfortable implications. For \none thing, we think \u201cI\u201d uniquely refers, but \n\u201cI\u201d in X's mouth would, in this case, actually \nbe referring to two people, Y and Z. Or \nperhaps that is not quite right; perhaps instead \u201cI\u201d in \nX's mouth refers to only one person, either \nY or Z. But in that case, no one, not even\n\u201cthe\u201d speaker, could possibly know to which one it \nreferred. And there are other worries. For instance, whether or not \nthe pre-fission X consists in two overlapping persons \ndepends entirely on what happens in the future, i.e., on whether or \nnot X goes through with the fission. So if X is \ndriving from the bank to the fission doctor and then gets cold feet, \nthere will be no fission and thus no Y or Z. But \nthen whether or not Y or Z exist at the time of\nX's cold feet depends on whether or not X even\ngets cold feet, which seems, at the very least, quite odd. Whether or\nnot \u201cI\u201d now consist in one or two people should not, we \nwant to say, depend on what happens to \u201cme\u201d in the \nfuture.\n\n\nNow these are just standard puzzles for four-dimensionalism about \npersons (see Olson 1997b, van Inwagen 2002, and the entry on  \n personal identity).\n But there are also puzzles for four-dimensionalism specific to its \ntreatment of the responsibility case. For instance, if responsibility\ndepends on identity, and identity is a transitive relation, then if \nY is responsible for the actions of X (insofar as \nY is unified with X as part of the same \nperson-worm), and Z is responsible for the actions of \nX (insofar as Z is unified with X as part \nof the same person-worm), then wouldn't Y also be \nresponsible for the actions of Z (and vice versa)? Of \ncourse, unity relations are not identity relations, but it is unclear\njust why they do not have to be transitive in the way the identity \nrelation is supposed to be (in Sider 2001a, 203, he simply insists \nthat they do not have to be, without saying why). Furthermore, the \nfour-dimensionalist solution is meant to preserve the commonsense \nslogan, but it does so in virtue of a solution that seems about as\nfar from commonsense as can be. Indeed, the slogan is about the\nresponsibility of persons, but four-dimensionalism offers \nonly a solution regarding the responsibility of \nperson-stages (Ibid.; see also Parfit 1976).\n\n\nA second reply is reductionist, and it simply denies the slogan. \nIn other words, identity is not necessary for moral \nresponsibility. Instead (the reductionist could say), what matters is\npsychological continuity (or connectedness), regardless of whether it\nobtains uniquely. This allows the reductionist to handle the fission \ncase in the following way: while neither Y nor Z is\nidentical with X, both are fully psychologically continuous \nwith him, and insofar as ownership of actions consists in \npsychological continuity with the original agent, and because \nownership is the necessary condition for responsibility, both \nY and Z may be morally responsible for X's\ncrimes.\n\n\nOf course, we already saw some worries attached to a psychological\ncontinuity account of ownership that were unrelated to its being an\naccount of numerical identity (e.g., the gradual fugue of Johann to\nSebastian, and the psychological discontinuity case). Perhaps, though,\nwe could draw from the insights regarding the characterization sense\nof identity in responding to these particular problems, and then\nconstruct an account of ownership relevant to responsibility that is\nutterly divorced from considerations of numerical identity (and\ninsofar as narrative identity depends on numerical identity, it would\nnot be an eligible contender here). Indeed, this might be one way to\nconstrue what those working on responsibility\nand identification are doing (e.g., Frankfurt 1988, 1999;\nTaylor 1983; Watson 1975; Smith 2000; D. Shoemaker 2015). Once the\naccount of ownership were complete, one could then\ncall the view an identity account if one wanted (perhaps\nbeing about practical identity), but this would just be a\nterminological overlay, and it would be clear at that point that the\nessential component of responsibility was not really identity but\nrather ownership.\n(One might wonder what the Anthropological View would say about\nmoral responsibility and personhood. As the theory stands, it does not\nengage directly with this discussion, as it is just about determining\nthe types of entities who are the appropriate targets of\naccountability assessments, and so does not purport to deliver whether\nany individual assessment is appropriate relative to identity.)\n6. Identity and Applied Ethics\n\n\nPerhaps the most exciting and variegated explorations of the relation\nbetween identity and ethics are taking place in the arena \nof applied ethics, specifically in medical ethics and bioethics. \nThese typically involve attempts to chart the relation between some \nclear-cut person and either an earlier or later entity \u201cat the \nmargins of life.\u201d We will here discuss the two main arenas of \nsuch research before briefly noting the sorts of debates about \nidentity and applied ethics taking place in other arenas.\n6.1 Embryonic Research and Abortion\n\n\nThere are several ways in which personal identity is taken to be \nrelevant to the debates over these topics. Consider first embryos and\nrecent disputes over the morality of stem cell research. The\nmost commonly cited argument against such research is that, in its \nmost promising form, it will involve destruction of two- to \nfive-day-old embryos (in order to harvest their inner cell mass, \nwhich is what is used for the development of stem cells). But because\nhuman beings come into existence at the \u201cmoment\u201d of \nconception, embryos are human beings, and insofar as it is prima \nfacie immoral to kill human beings, it is prima facie immoral to kill\nembryos (see, e.g., Peters 2001, 129).\n\n\nReferences to identity in this debate come from objectors to this\nargument, who apply the argument from fission to a real life version\nof it, namely, twinning. An embryo might split any time generally\nbefore the two-week point in fetal development, and those two embryos\ncould develop into fully formed infant twins. The question for the\nadvocate of the above argument to consider is, in such a case, what\nhappens to the original human being, the embryo we will call\nAdam? There are only three possibilities: (a) either Adam survives as\nboth twins, (b) Adam survives only as one or the other of the twins,\nor (c) Adam does not survive. Option (a) cannot be right, given that\nthe twins will live distinct, individual lives, and so will clearly be\ntwo human beings, not one. Option (b) cannot be right, for what\nnon-arbitrary reason could there be for one of the twins to be Adam\nand not the other? They will both be qualitatively identical to Adam,\nafter all. The only remaining option, then, is (c), in which Adam does\nnot survive. But this has two bad implications for the above\nadvocate. First, if it is a tragedy when a human being dies, then\ntwinning involves a tragedy, and Adam's death, it seems, ought to be\nmourned. This seems absurd (McMahan 1995 and 2002, 26; although see\nOderberg 1997 for an embrace of this implication).  Second, if the\nmetaphysical analysis is right, then Adam's death brings about the\nexistence of two new human beings (call them Barney and Claire). But\nthis means that (1) it is not the case that\nall human beings come into existence at conception (some \ncome into existence at twinning), and (2) death can somehow occur \nwith no earthly remains, which is at best odd and at worst false \n(Kuhse and Singer 2002, 190).\n\n\nThere are several possible replies, though. First, it is not clear \nthat the options in twinning are exhausted by the three possibilities\narticulated above. A fourth possible option, it seems, is that of the\nfour-dimensionalist, who can maintain that the embryo is a human \nbeing from the moment of conception by saying that the pre-twinning \ntemporal parts of both Barney and Claire simply overlapped, \ni.e., what we called Adam was really a shared stage in the lives of \nboth Barney and Claire. McMahan, for one, simply dismisses this \npossibility as absurd (McMahan 2002, 26), but it is not clear why, \nespecially given that it is a straightforward application of a \npowerful metaphysical theory that has quite a bit of independent \nsupport (despite having its own set of problems, discussed earlier). \nSecond, the implications involved may not be as bad as indicated. For\none thing, \u201cdeath by twinning,\u201d while still a kind of \ndeath, may not be of a kind warranting the same sort of mourning \ntypically expected to accompany regular \u201cbodily\u201d death. \nFurthermore, this kind of ceasing to exist, if it is a different kind\nof event than that of regular death, perhaps should not be expected \nto have the same kind of conditions \u2013 like the leaving of \nearthly remains \u2013 as regular death either. Consider how we \nthink of the similar \u201cdeaths\u201d of splitting amoebas \n(Ibid., 27).\n\n\nTurn now to just one way in which personal identity enters into the \nbroader debate over abortion. Perhaps the most famous anti-abortion \nargument in the philosophical literature comes from Don Marquis, who \nargues that, because it is prima facie wrong to kill any entity with \na future like ours, and because a fetus has a future like ours, it is\nprima facie wrong to kill a fetus (Marquis 1989). Peter McInerney and\nothers, however, have denied that fetuses have futures like ours by \nappealing to considerations of identity. To have a future like ours, \nfor instance, presupposes that one is identical to some person who \nwill experience said future. But a fetus is not a person, it seems, \nand so it cannot be identical to any future person. Indeed, none of \nthe relations deemed relevant to the identity of persons are \npresent between a fetus and anything else, simply because a fetus \nlacks a psychology with memories, beliefs, desires, intentions, and a\ngeneral character capable of establishing any sort of plausible \nconnection to a future experiencer, so that any experiences that \nexperiencer undergoes cannot be the fetus's future \nexperiences (McInerney 1990, Brill 2003). (The same point might be \ntrue as well for infants, but instead of taking that to be a \nreductio of the objection, one might also quite plausibly take\nit simply to be a point in favor of rejecting Marquis's criterion of \nthe wrongness of killing: given that infants also lack a future like \nours, Marquis's account is substantially incomplete, for it fails to \nexplain why killing infants is wrong, when it obviously is.)\n\n\nThis objection assumes a purely psychological criterion of identity, \nhowever, one in which, further, \u201cperson\u201d is what's known\nas a substance concept, a term designating a kind to which an \nindividual always and essentially belongs throughout its existence. \nBut as we saw earlier, \u201cperson\u201d might be merely a  \nphase sortal, designating a kind to which the individual belongs\n\u2013 if it does at all \u2013 for only part of its existence. \nThis could mean, then, that I, now a person, could still be \nidentical qua individual, to some organism \u2013 a fetus, \nsay \u2013 that was not a person. Thus if some past fetus is \nidentical to me \u2013 if we are one and the same animal, or \norganism \u2013 then he did indeed have a future like ours (Marquis \n1998).\n\n\nClearly, though, if it is identity alone that renders a future\nexperiencer's experiences mine, then the view runs into\ndifficulty when, once more, we consider the possibility of fission.\nIf I undergo fission, then, given the standard arguments, I will not\nsurvive (setting four-dimensionalist considerations aside).\nNevertheless, surely we want to say that I still have a\nvaluable future \u2013 indeed, it is overwhelmingly plausible to say\nI will have  two valuable futures. This only makes sense,\nthough, if we prize apart the having of a valuable future from the\nobtaining of the (numerical) identity relation (for resistance to this\npoint, see Heathwood 2011). If we do so, though, we are insisting that\nthe relations that matter in the having of a valuable future are\ndefinitely psychological, in which case, even if I am\nidentical with some past fetus (qua organism or animal), that\nis irrelevant: what matters in the having of a valuable\nfuture does not obtain between us, so while a fetus has a future, it\nreally does not have a future like ours.\n\n\nA third kind of stance taken regarding identity and abortion is that \nthere just is no relation of significance between them. Earl\nConee argues in this way, insisting that the four main attempts to \nbolster some view about abortion with metaphysical conclusions fail, \nand thus that the metaphysics simply makes no moral difference, a \nconclusion \u201cindicative of a general epistemic irrelevance of \nmetaphysics to the moral issue\u201d (Conee 1999, 619). But just \nbecause the various arguments fail (and Conee seems right about \nthat), it does not yet follow that metaphysics generally makes no \nmoral difference to questions about fetuses and embryos; indeed, we \nhave just discussed two cases in which it clearly does. As Timothy \nChappell puts it, Conee \u201cdoes nothing to show that the \nright metaphysical doctrines \u2013 combined of course with\nthe right moral doctrines \u2013 could not give us genuine reason to\nturn one way rather than the other in debates about abortion, or \nother similar debates about the extent of the moral community\u201d \n(Chappell 2000, 279). And so it is to one of those \u201csimilar \ndebates,\u201d this time regarding the other end of life, that we \nnow turn.\n6.2 Advanced Directives \n\n\nThe philosophical puzzle regarding advance directives is \nfundamentally a puzzle about personal identity. Suppose that a woman \nis in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, and she recognizes \nthat there will come a point where she is in a demented state and \nwill thus be incompetent to make autonomous or informed decisions \nabout her treatment. Because she values her creativity and autonomy, \nshe does not want that future demented self to be kept alive \u2013 \nits life will not be worth living \u2013 so she signs an advance \ndirective stipulating that no life-saving measures are to be used on \nthat future demented self (FDS). However, by the time her FDS gets \npneumonia, she is quite content in her state and, when asked, says \nshe wants to live (e.g., McMahan 2002, 497).\n\n\nThere is obviously a conflict here, but of what sort? If FDS is \nidentical to the early-stage Alzheimer's self (EAS), then the \nconflict is between temporally distinct interests of the same person.\nBut if that is the case, then we typically discount past interests in\nfavor of present ones. If, when I was a ravenously carnivorous \n20-year-old, I swore to myself that I would never pass up an \nopportunity to eat a juicy steak, yet I now find myself a vegetarian \nwho gets queasy at the sight of medium-rare flesh on the table, it is\nobviously my present interests that will \u2013 and ought, we think \n\u2013 win the day.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if FDS is not identical to EAS \u2013 \nif, instead, she is a different person, or is at least a different \nself \u2013 then it may not be so obvious what the conflict is after\nall, for FDS has made her preferences clear, and if she is \nimportantly distinct from the signer of the advance directive, then \nthere seems little reason why the interests of EAS are relevant at \nall to FDS's life. But then again, FDS is not competent, and EAS, if \nnot identical to her, is at least akin to her closest relative, one \nmight think, in which case her earlier wishes perhaps ought to hold \nsway after all (see Luttrell and Sommerville 1996). (But EAS and FDS \nwill be very psychologically different, we are supposing, so why \nthink they are closely related at all? Indeed, wouldn't FDS be more \nclosely \u201crelated\u201d to her fellow end-stage Alzheimer's \npatients? So why think EAS has any more right to make life-or-death \ndecisions about her than any of these others?)\n\n\nAnd here is yet another way of looking at the matter. Suppose we \nagree with Parfit and others that identity just is not what matters \nfor, among other things, defining and delimiting the scope of \negoistic concern; suppose instead it is Relation R. FDS, because of \nher loss of memory and the like, will bear a very limited degree of \nthat relation to EAS. EAS will thus be strongly R-related with most \nof the previous stages of her life (the chains of connectedness, let \nus stipulate, are very strong), but very weakly R-related with FDS, \neven though, it seems clear, FDS remains a stage of her life. But the\npart of her life most deeply prudentially unified \u2013 the far \nlarger, more dominant part of her life \u2013 is the part of which \nEAS was still a strongly R-related part. Thus it might be that the \nwishes of EAS to preserve a coherently meaningful and valuable life \nought to control here, given that the longer FDS lives, the worse she\nmight retrospectively render EAS's life. That is, what is good for \nthe deepest, longest prudential unity will be closest to what is best\nfor the life as a whole, so FDS's good ought to be sacrificed for the\nsake of the good of the whole, as articulated by EAS in her advanced \ndirective (see McMahan 2002, 502 for an argument like this).\n\n\nOf course, once we abandon identity as what matters \u2013 \nespecially if we do so in favor of a relation(s) that does not \nguarantee life-long unity (e.g., connectedness) \u2013 then it is \nnot so clear anymore why what is best for the life-as-a-whole \n\u201cunit\u201d should matter at all. But if considerations of \nlife-long welfare are set aside, then it is hard to see how EAS's \nadvance directive could still have any moral authority over FDS's \nexpressed interests. EAS's \u201clife\u201d would be over, for all \nintents and purposes, so it seems that no matter what happens to FDS,\nit cannot retroactively affect the value of EAS's already-completed \n\u201clife.\u201d This is the kind of move urged by some theorists \nregardless of considerations of identity. What we should abandon, \nthey suggest, is the intuition that EAS's preferences are \nauthoritative over FDS's at all (Dresser 1986, Jaworska 1999). Many \ndemented patients are still capable of a kind of autonomy \u2013 \ninvolving the capacity to value \u2013 and so their wishes \nought to be respected, goes this line, over the decisions of their \nearlier selves (Jaworska 1999, 109). Of course, this kind of view \nwon't apply to end-stage dementia patients, but they may be \npatients incapable of expressing (or having?) genuine preferences in \nthe first place.\n\n\nAs should be evident from just this very brief discussion, the issues\nhere are quite complex, but they are definitely issues for which\nconsiderations of personal identity are often taken to be directly\nrelevant.  (See also Buchanan 1988 for helpful discussion of some of\nthese issues.)\n6.3 Other Issues in Applied Ethics \n\n\nThere are at least four other areas of applied ethics that seem to \nbear a relation to personal identity, and we will lay out the issues \nof each very briefly. First, there is a problem of justifying \ntherapeutic treatment for patients with Dissociative Identity \nDisorder (DID, formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder). The \nworry here comes from the attractive thought that each of the \ndistinct personalities of someone with DID is in fact a different \nperson (Wilkes 1988; Dennett 1976). If so, then a therapy that \naims at  eliminating one or more of the alter personalities in\nfavor of one of them would be, prima facie, immoral. (Morton Prince, \none of the first psychologists to work with a DID patient, wrote that\nhis aim was indeed to kill off what he thought of as the \n\u201cnon-real\u201d personalities of his patient, Christine \nBeauchamp. See Prince 1905.) But this verdict is quite \ncounterintuitive: surely the therapist is helping the patient \nwith DID when his work produces only one healthy personality, not \ndoing anything immoral. The issue, then, is about the moral \nramifications of cutting off personal identity in an unusual sort of \nway. In addition, there are intriguing issues regarding identity and \nboth legal and moral responsibility in patients with DID. What if one\nalter commits a crime, say? Is the patient with DID responsible or is\nonly the offending alter responsible? If the latter, how is a fair \npunishment to be effected? (For further discussion of these issues, \nsee Wilkes 1981, 1988; Hacking 1991, 1995; Lizza 1993; Braude 1995, \n1996; Radden 1996; Sinnott-Armstrong and Behnke 2000; Kennett and \nMatthews 2002; and DeGrazia 2005).\n\n\nA second problem has to do with genetic interference. Suppose someone\ncarried the gene for Huntington's disease (HD) and wanted a child. \nThere would be a 50/50 chance her child would inherit the HD gene. If\nthere were genetic intervention available to eliminate the \npossibility of her child carrying the gene, should she undergo it? It\nseems obvious she should, at least until we draw on some metaphysical\nconsiderations about identity. Suppose the genetic intervention \ninvolved waiting until after fertilization and then altering the \ngenome of the fetus. What would be the identity of the \npost-intervention child? Further, if its identity would be different \nfrom the child that would have been brought into existence, \nwould the genetic interference be immoral in virtue of \npreventing that other child's existence? Relevant to the \ndebate here is Saul Kripke's thesis about origins, that one person \ncould not have been someone else (Kripke 1980), and this is a thesis \nwith which advocates of the Biological Criterion of personal identity\nwould likely agree: what makes me the particular individual I am is \nmy biological structure and its origins, and any other combination of\nmy parents' sperm and egg would have produced a different individual.\nThe question here, though, is whether or not some other \nchanges, after the combination of sperm and egg, would be sufficient \nto produce a different individual. And if so, does this bear on the \nmorality of doing so? (For further discussion of these issues, see \nElliot 1993, Persson 1995, Belshaw 2000, Glannon 2001, and DeGrazia 2005:\n244\u2013268.)\n\n\nA third problem is in certain respects closely related. It is the \nnon-identity problem, first discussed in detail in Parfit \n1984, 351\u2013379. Suppose a fourteen-year-old girl decides to have a \nchild. Given her youth, the girl gives her child a bad start in life.\nIf she had waited several years to have a child, that child would \nhave been better off than the one she had. Our intuition is \nthat what the girl has done is wrong. But why? The obvious answer \nwould seem to be that the girl's decision was bad for her \nchild. But this cannot be right, for that child would not even \nhave existed were it not for her decision. It is also clear that she \ndoesn't harm the child that would have existed had she waited, given \nthat something that does not exist cannot be harmed. It thus turns \nout to be very difficult to articulate just what was wrong with the \ngirl's decision, but as Parfit notes, we do not abandon our belief in\nthe wrongness of what the girl did. Instead, \u201cwe cannot defend \nthis belief in the natural way \u2026 suggested\u201d (Parfit \n1984, 359). But finding an alternative defense does not look very \npromising. And applying the non-identity problem on a grander scale \nyields a serious puzzle in population ethics. Suppose governments \naround the world continue to ignore the threat of global warming, so \nthat the lives of people living between 2200 and 2500 are barely \nworth living. Contrast this case with the scenario in which the \ngovernments cooperate to enact regulatory measures that slow down the\nwarming trend and render it a non-threat, but in so doing make the \nlives of people living between 2010 and 2200 of a lower quality than \nthey would otherwise have been. Clearly, it seems the second scenario\nis better, that we ought to bring this scenario about. But on what \nbasis? Far-reaching governmental policies often play a critical role \nin determining the ways and timing in which people get together, so \nthe identities of the members of the populations in each scenario \nwould likely be quite different. If we also assume that we do not \nharm anyone by bringing him or her into existence, then who is harmed\nin the former scenario? Who is made worse off? Given that those \npeople would not have existed had we done something about global \nwarming, they have not been harmed by our inaction. So what moral \nreason can be given in defense of our pursuit of the second scenario?\n(Parfit 1984, 371\u2013377) These are very difficult issues indeed. (For \nfurther discussion, see DeGrazia 2005, 268\u2013279.)\n\n\nFinally, many have argued that considerations of personal identity can\nshed light on the nature of death, which itself plays a key role in\nmoral argumentation (Green and Wikler 1980; Zaner 1988; Puccetti 1988;\nMcMahan 2002; DeGrazia 2005). One popular line of thought, based on\nthe Psychological Criterion, has been that when an individual is at\nthe point when she is no longer able to sustain any psychological\ncontinuity, her identity has ceased, and so she should be considered\ndead. This idea has led many philosophers to advocate for a criterion\nof death known as the \u201chigher brain standard,\u201d according\nto which death occurs at the point of irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness (e.g., Green and Wikler 1980). This\npsychological criterion of death implies that those in a permanent\nvegetative state are dead, despite their continuing brainstem\nactivities. This philosophically popular view has never, however, been\nadopted anywhere. Those favoring the Biological Criterion advocate a\nview much more in line with actual medical practice. If we are\nessentially human organisms, according to these advocates, then our\ndeath occurs at the point when that organism dies. There is still\nwrangling over when precisely that occurs, however. Some favor a\n\u201cdeath of the whole brain standard,\u201d whereas\nothers, dissenters as DeGrazia labels them, adhere to a\n\u201ccirculatory-respiratory standard,\u201d according to which\n\u201chuman death is the permanent cessation of\ncirculatory-respiratory function\u201d (DeGrazia 2005, 149). It is\nless clear, however, what role personal identity actually plays in\nthis debate. After all, the cessation of my identity may have nothing\nto do with anything like organismic (or brain) death. On any view of\npersonal identity other than four-dimensionalism, recall, I cease to\nexist if I undergo fission. There will be no one in existence who is\nme, but this fact is irrelevant to our thinking about death. It may be\nthe case, then, that seeking the factors involved in cutting off\nsomeone's personal, or human, identity will yield no insights into the\nnature of death itself.  (For further discussion, see DeGrazia 2003, and\nMcMahan 1995 and 2002.)\n7. Methodological Alternatives\n\n\nRecall that both Reid and Butler objected to Locke's account of \npersonal identity, in part, because they thought it had absurdly \nrevisionary implications for our practices of moral responsibility. \nSo rather than give up those practices, they said, we would be better\noff giving up Locke's theory. On this view, our normative commitments\nprovide an important check on our theories of personal identity. Nevertheless, the \nconsideration about moral responsibility is only one of many \nobjections both critics run against Locke. They also launch purely \nmetaphysical objections as well, the thought being that Locke's view \nfails both on its own terms and in light of its absurd normative \nimplications. So actually, while our normative commitments provide \nan important consideration that the theory of personal \nidentity should account for, it remains open that such commitments \ncould be overridden or revised, depending perhaps on the independent \nplausibility of the theory in question.\n\n\nFor some authors, however, the role of our normative commitments in \nthis debate is much stronger: they may actually authoritatively \nconstrain, shape, or even be immune or irrelevant to one's theory of \npersonal identity. This is a general methodological dispute about the\nproper direction of argumentation in the arena of personal identity \nand ethics. The assumption of many working in this arena has been \nevident in the discussion thus far: we work out or identify the \ncorrect theory of personal identity and then apply it where needed to\nthe world of ethics. What we will briefly explore in this section, \nthough, are four importantly different approaches (these are not \nexhaustive of the alternatives, however).\n\n\nFirst, there is the Kantian view, advanced by Christine Korsgaard, \nthat conceiving ourselves as practical agents simply \nrequires us to view our lives as unified, despite the \nweakness or strength of various psychological connections that may or\nmay not obtain between our various temporal stages. My conception of \nmyself as a unified agent is not based on any metaphysical theory; it\nis instead based (a) on the basic need I have to eliminate \nconflict among my various motivational desires in order to act \n(producing my unified agency at any given time, i.e., synchronic \nunity), (b) on my deliberative standpoint, within which I view \nmyself \u2013 a single deliberator/decider \u2013 as being\nover and above my various desires, weighing them and deciding between\nthem, and (c) on my need to pursue any ends or carry out a \nrational plan of life (presupposing my unified agency across time, \ni.e., diachronic unity). In any case, I must conceive myself as a \nunified agent both at a time and across time because I have only one \nbody with which to act. This unity, therefore, has no need of any \nmetaphysical support; instead, it is simply a practical requirement \nof being an agent, a doer of deeds and a thinker of thoughts \n(Korsgaard 1989).\n\n\nSecond, there is the communitarian view, advanced by philosophers \nlike Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor, that all proper \nconceptions of the self are dependent on social matrices. In order to\nunderstand the self, we must view it both in its relation to the good\nand in its relation to other selves, for two reasons. First, we have \nan indispensable ability both to have certain moral intuitions and to\narticulate the grounds of those intuitions, and this ability \npresupposes the existence of what Taylor calls evaluative frameworks,\nframeworks also presupposed by our concept of personhood. So crucial \nto understanding who I am is understanding where I stand in moral \nspace: my identity is bound up in, and at least partially constituted\nby, my strong attachments to a community that provides the evaluative\nframework within which I am able to articulate what is good and \nvaluable. Thus, to ask about a person abstracted from his \nself-interpretations is to ask \u201ca fundamentally misguided \nquestion\u201d (Taylor 1989, 34).\n\n\nThe second general reason selves can be understood only by reference \nto community and morality comes from a consideration of human \nactions. As MacIntyre notes, human actions are intelligible \nonly if viewed in a particular setting. We can understand a piece of \nhuman behavior only when we have situated the agent's intentions \nwithin the two contexts of their role in the agent's history and \ntheir role within the history of their particular setting(s). In \ndoing so, we are writing a narrative history. Intelligible actions \nare actions for which the agent is accountable, actions \nwhich have a place in an ongoing narrative (MacIntyre 1984, 206\u2013208).\nThus arises the notion of narrative unity. My life, my \nentire life, from physical birth to physical death, can be \nunderstood only as a narrative, as an ongoing story. Now the unity of\na narrative requires unity of character, and unity of character \npresupposes strict, numerical personal identity. To be the subject of\na narrative is to be accountable for past actions that have composed \nthat narrative life. To understand your actions now, therefore, I \nhave to understand them as actions situated in a life story, \nyour life story, as actions interrelated with your \nprior actions. As a result, \u201call attempts to elucidate the \nnotion of personal identity independently of and in isolation from \nthe notions of narrative, intelligibility and accountability are \nbound to fail. As all such attempts have\u201d (ibid., \n218).\n\n\nBoth the Kantian and communitarian objections target the  \ndisunifying implications of a metaphysical approach like \nreductionism, insisting instead that we are indeed unified as either \npractical agents or selves in moral space for purely normative \nreasons. Any theory of identity we construct, then, must be \nconstrained by these normative considerations, which are thus \nobviously prior. Nevertheless, we may have some reason to doubt these\nclaims. Consider first narrative unity. For one thing, it is not \nclear that intelligible actions are those for which the agent is \naccountable. Actions of children and the insane can be perfectly \nintelligible \u2013 even intelligible within some kind of narrative \nstructure \u2013 without being those for which the agents are \naccountable.\n\n\nMore troublesome, though, is the status of the narrative unity claim.\nIs it descriptive or prescriptive? If descriptive, asserting that \nselves simply conceive themselves as unified over their lives within \na narrative structure, then it seems false. As Galen Strawson points \nout, some people (and he claims to be one) are \n\u201cEpisodics,\u201d those who have \u201clittle or no sense \nthat the self that one is was there in the (further) past and will be\nthere in the future,\u201d and thus \u201care likely to have no \nparticular tendency to see their life in Narrative terms\u201d \n(Strawson 2004, 430). In addition, this observation bodes ill for the\nKantian, insofar as it asserts the possibility of practical agency \nfor those who do not view themselves as diachronically \nunified, i.e., unified practical agency may indeed not be a practical\nnecessity. On the other hand, if the narrative unity thesis is \nsupposed to be prescriptive, urging that people \nought to view themselves as unified over time within a\nnarrative structure, then it poses no threat to descriptive,\ndisuniting theories of identity like reductionism, for it would have\nto allow that life-long unity may simply not occur. Indeed, if the\naccount is prescriptive, then it actually makes more sense to consider\npersons to be disunified, if what they ought to strive for is greater\nunity.  If unity were a given, such striving would be\nunnecessary. (For somewhat similar considerations, see Williams\n2007.)\n\n\nBut even if we grant the need for the kind of unity desired by both \nthe Kantians and the communitarians, this does not yet imply that we \nmust grant the life-long unity on which they both insist. It\nmay be instead that only certain parts of one's life are \nunified in the way they describe, and these could in fact be \nstretches defined also by the obtaining of strong psychological \nconnectedness, say (such that one's life would be better conceived as\na collection of short stories than as a novel). In other words, it \ncould be that reductionist theories of personal identity dovetail \nwith these normative considerations already, so that rather than \nconstituting a constraint on that theory (and disuniting theories \nlike it), such considerations actually  buttress it.\n\n\nThe third methodological alternative insists that, because our \ncommonsense intuitions are at loggerheads over the thought \nexperiments motivating the various metaphysical theories of personal \nidentity (e.g., brain transplants, teletransportation, and the like),\nthe only plausible solution to this underlying conflict is going to \nbe revisionary, requiring us to abandon one of the conflicting sets \nof intuitions. But on the basis of what? Carol Rovane suggests that \nwe start instead by deploying something on which everyone could \nagree, namely, a conception of personhood that's allegedly built into\nthe foundations of every ethical position (including anti-theoretical\nones). Once we determine the key condition of personhood \u2013 the \ncondition Rovane calls \u201cthe ability to engage in  \nagency-regarding relations\u201d (Rovane 1998, 5) \u2013 we \ncan then go on to construct a metaphysical theory of personal \nidentity on top of this ethical concept. For Rovane, this will yield \nthe rather surprising possibility of both group persons, composed of \nmany human bodies (insofar as the group can meet the conditions of \nethical personhood, functioning as an individual agent), and multiple\npersons, simultaneously existing within only one human body (insofar \nas each \u201cpersonality\u201d can meet the condition of ethical \npersonhood, functioning as an individual agent, as well) \n(Ibid., chapters 4\u20135).\n\n\nOthers have been sufficiently moved as well by the recognition of \nconflicting intuitions in the puzzle cases to seek an entirely \ndifferent approach to the issue of personal identity (see, e.g., \nWilkes 1988, Schechtman 1996). But it is not yet clear why such a \nradical revision in methodology is called for. After all, the fact \nthat our intuitions conflict in the puzzle cases does not necessarily\nmean that there is some deep-seated, ineliminable incoherence in the \nconcepts we're applying to them. Instead, it may simply mean that \nthere are conditions restricting the deployment of our concepts to \nanything other than paradigm cases, or it might mean that we are \nactually unsure what our intuitions are about the puzzle \ncases (for the former objection, see Gendler 2002a, 231; for the \nlatter, see Degaynesford 2001, 171). (Further, even if we do agree on\nthe need for a distinctly ethical conception of personhood and \npersonal identity, it is not clear why the one Rovane has chosen is \nsupposed to be uniquely suited to our purposes. After all, \nthere will be plenty of other possible conceptions that are at least \nas plausible as having the agency-regarding ability, including \nconceptions emphasizing the ability to experience complex emotions, \nto control certain aspects of their world, or to feel pleasure and \npain [see Gendler 2002a, 236]. Why privilege agency-regarding \ncapacities over these?)\n\n\nA fourth alternative to the methodology assumed thus far is presented\nin a series of powerful papers by Mark Johnston, in which he defends \na view called \u201cminimalism,\u201d according to which the \nmetaphysical facts of personal identity are irrelevant to the \njustification of our person-related practices and practical concerns,\nthat the facts to which we think we are committed actually play only \na minimal role in those practices and concerns (Johnston 1987, 1989, \n1992, and 1997; Wolf 1986 and Unger 1990 have argued in a somewhat \nsimilar vein as well). Indeed, our practices here have a \njustification independent of metaphysics \u2013 a coherentist \njustification \u2013 so no metaphysical theory of personal identity \nwill imply any real revisions to them at all. Johnston illustrates \nthis point by talking about one of our practical concerns in \nparticular: self-concern. My self-concern is part of a wider pattern \nof self-referential concern, a special non-derivative concern \nI have for a certain limited network of people, all of whom bear certain \nsorts of special relations to me: I care about my friends, \nmy family, and my self. I care about them for their own\nsakes and I would need a very good reason not to do so (which is so \nfar not forthcoming) (Johnston 1997, 158\u2013159). Thus, in \u201cthe \nparticular case of personal identity, minimalism implies that any \nmetaphysical view of persons which we might have is either \nepiphenomenal or a redundant basis for our practice of making \njudgements about personal identity and organizing our practical \nconcerns around this relation\u201d (Johnston 1997, 150).\n\n\nThis is an important point. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether it\ncould be extended to apply to all of our practical concerns,\nresting as it does solely on an analysis of self-concern.  Indeed,\nthere may well be other person-related practices and concerns that\naren't part of that network of self-referential concerns, including,\nperhaps, moral responsibility, compensation, third-person\nreidentification, and general survival. For these other practices and\nconcerns, then, the metaphysics of identity may still be quite\nrelevant.  Indeed, trying to see what, if anything, serves to unify\nthe locus of all of these practical concerns is what motivates\nSchechtman's (2014) Anthropological View of our \u201cliteral\nidentity.\u201d Insofar as our many concerns are, she thinks,\norganized around one type of thing (what she calls a\n\u201cperson-life\u201d), we can derive from their close\nconsideration the actual identity conditions of individuals like us.\nHere, though, the issue is less about identity grounding our\npractical concerns than its being revealed by them.\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nAs should by now be obvious, the relation between personal identity\nand ethics is complex and by no means established, and this is true\nfor several reasons. First, it is still unclear what the correct\ntheory of personal identity is, or even what the right sense of\n\u201cidentity\u201d (reidentification or characterization) is\nthat's to be deployed. Second, there is a question about the priority\nrelation between identity and ethics. In other words, should we\nestablish the true theory of identity before applying it to ethics,\nshould we constrain or construct our theory of identity in light of\nour ethical concerns, or should we try to build up theories of both\nidentity and our ethical concerns in light of one another (via a sort\nof reflective equilibrium)? Third, it is unclear what the precise type\nof relation is that we should expect between identity and ethics,\ni.e., should it be a justificatory relation or an explanatory\nrelation? If the former, how exactly do we bridge the is/ought gap\nbetween descriptive metaphysics and normativity? If the latter, what\nprecisely is to be explained, and how would appeals to identity help?\nFourth, are we right to think of there being the \u2013 a\nsingle \u2013 relation between identity and ethics at all? (See\nD. Shoemaker 2007 and 2016; Schechtman 2014, Ch. 3)\n\n\nThis last point deserves much more discussion than it has previously\nreceived. It has generally been assumed that if there is a relation\nbetween identity and our practical concerns, it is some sort of\nunivocal relation, running from a single (correct) theory of personal\nidentity to all of our person-related practical concerns\n(whether it's a grounding relation, an explanatory relation, a\nrevealed relation, or something else). But why should we think this is\nthe case?  Instead, why not think that some practical concerns are\ngrounded by one relation and other concerns are grounded by\nanother?\n\n\nHere is just one way in which this might be true. My concern about\nanticipation of survival seems to depend on a belief about some future\nperson bearing a certain sort of psychological relation to me.\nAlternatively, what grounds compensation might be a biological\nrelation. The possibility of compensation, after all, may not be\nrestricted to benefits and burdens distributed solely to psychological\ncreatures: As mentioned earlier, I may deserve compensation as an\nadult for what happened to me as a fetus, and this may be\nrendered coherent only with respect to my being a biological human\norganism. Finally, consider moral responsibility. It seems\nplatitudinous that I can be responsible only for my own actions, but\nthis suggests that what's at issue is the  ownership relation\nof moral agents to their actions, i.e., the issue of what makes some\npast action properly attributable to me, a robust Lockean person (see Jaworski and Shoemaker 2018). But\nthis relation may best be grounded by something like a narrative\nconception of personal identity, one that answers to the\ncharacterization question, not the reidentification question.\n\n\nThese sketches suggest the possibility, then, of a  plurality\nof relations between identity and ethics. If so, perhaps the way to\nproceed is to focus on one specific person-related practical concern\nat a time and work out its precise relation to identity (if any)\nbefore moving on to others. While this approach may not diminish the\ncomplexity of the relation(s) between identity and ethics, perhaps it\nwill at least provide the kind of settled views in some limited areas\nwhich we have thus far been missing.",
