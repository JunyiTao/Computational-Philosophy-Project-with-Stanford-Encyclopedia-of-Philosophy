    "main_text": "The Ascent to Properties\n3. The Ascent to Properties\n\nCartesian dualism has fallen out of favor among philosophers and\ncognitive scientists. There are, to be sure, non-Cartesian forms of\nsubstance dualism that might have the resources to confront the\nProblem of Interaction in its various guises (Hasker 1999; Lowe 2006).\nBut the dominant view today would appear to be that if the mind is a\nsubstance at all, it is a physical substance\u2014the brain, for\ninstance. This sort of \u201csubstance monism\u201d is in fact a\nconsequence of the more general token identity theory: every concrete\nmental particular (token) is physical. We will assume token identity\nin what follows: minds, mental events, and any other mental\n\u201cobjects\u201d are physical (see\n the mind/brain identity theory).\n\nWhat becomes of the Problem of Interaction on such a view? It would\nseem to dissolve. While causation between brain and body is complex,\neven to the point of being empirically inscrutable, it does not pose\nthe same problems as soul\u2013body interaction. There are no special\nphilosophical problems with brain\u2013body interaction, nor is there\nanything especially odd or worrisome about an event in your brain\ncausing, say, your arm to go up. Any philosophical questions here\nbelong to\n the metaphysics of causation\n generally and have no special application to mental causation.\n\nNevertheless, philosophical worries about mental causation persist.\nTheoretical and commonsensical considerations leading us to think the\nmind or mental events cause behavior should also make us think that\nthey do so as mental, i.e., in virtue of their mental\n properties.\n Properties figure in causal relations (Kim 1973; Mackie 1974, ch. 10;\nArmstrong 1989, pp. 28\u20139; Ehring 1997). Drop a square\npaperweight into soft clay and it will produce an impression. The\nshape of the impression can be traced to the shape of the paperweight,\nthe depth of the impression to the mass of the paperweight. Here shape\nand mass are \u201ccausally relevant\u201d or \u201ccausally\nefficacious\u201d properties. In particular, they are relevant to\ncertain properties of the impression. By contrast, other properties of\nthe paperweight, such as its color or value, appear to be irrelevant\nto producing this kind of impression. Or consider a soprano who sings\na high note, thereby shattering a glass. The sound, we can suppose,\nhas a meaning\u2014a semantic property\u2014but it is the\nsound\u2019s acoustic properties that are operative in producing the\nshattering; the semantic properties play no causal role, at least not\nwith respect to this effect (Dretske 1989).\n\nBy themselves, these observations pose no special problem for the\nphilosopher of mind. While the notion of a causally relevant property\ncalls for analysis (Horgan 1989; Dardis 1993; Braun 1995), there is no\nreason at the outset for a token-identity theorist to be especially\nconcerned about the efficacy of mental properties. Gus smiles because\nof the way his food tastes, that phenomenal property; Lilian walks to\nschool along a particular route because of what she believes, that\nrepresentational property. Assuming the mind is something physical,\nwhy should a mind\u2019s causing behavior in virtue of its mental\nproperties be any more puzzling than a paperweight\u2019s causing a\nsquare impression in virtue of its shape?\n\nRecent philosophical work on mental properties has revealed that\nmatters are not so simple, however. Mental properties are alleged to\nhave, not just one, but up to four features that make their efficacy\nphilosophically puzzling, no less problematic than mind\u2013body\ninteraction is for the Cartesian dualist. These features will be\ndiscussed in the following sections. Each feature makes it appear as\nthough mental properties, or some important family of them, are\nirrelevant to the production of behavior. The threat is a form of\nepiphenomenalism: even if minds and mental events are causes, they are\nnot causes as (or qua) mental.\n",
