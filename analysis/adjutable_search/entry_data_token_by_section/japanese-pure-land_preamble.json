    "main_text": "\n\nPure Land Buddhist teachings have played a major role in Japanese\nintellectual and social life from the sixth century CE, when\nemissaries from the Korean peninsula first officially introduced\nBuddhist images and texts to the Japanese court, down to the present.\nWhile the influence of the Zen tradition on Japanese thought and\nculture is widely acknowledged, the role of Pure Land Buddhist\nconcepts and sensibilities have tended to receive only marginal\nrecognition in the West. Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore\ntheir perhaps even more pervasive force. Moreover, as D. T. Suzuki\n(1870\u20131966) has noted,\n\n\nThe Japanese may not have offered very many original ideas to world\nthought or world culture, but in Shin we find a major contribution the\nJapanese can make to the outside world and to all other Buddhist\nschools. (Suzuki 1970, pp.\u200913\u201314)\n\n\nAlthough Suzuki does not define what ideas he has in mind, he\nindicates that it is specifically in relation to the Pure Land\ntradition that we find a significant, innovative development in\nBuddhist philosophy that has taken place in Japan.\n\nIn brief, the Japanese Pure Land contribution to Buddhist philosophy\nmay be said to lie in its fusion of two fundamental attitudes. On the\none hand, it stands squarely upon a Mahayana Buddhist conception of\nenlightened wisdom as radically nondichotomous and nondual with\nreality, indicated with such terms as thusness, buddha-nature, and\nemptiness. On the other hand, it directly confronts the nature of\nhuman existence in its ineluctable finitude: karmically conditioned,\ndiscriminative and reifying in awareness, and given to the afflicting\npassions of attachment to a falsely conceived self surrounded by\nsubstantial objects. Through its probing religious anthropology,\nJapanese Pure Land thought explores the paradoxical issues of how\ntransformative awakening can be possible for the ignorant self, how\nattainment as liberation from defiled self-will can occur, and the\nnature of the world of religious realization that unfolds within the\nlocus of a person\u2019s samsaric existence.\n",
