    "main_text": "Libertarian Principles\n7. Libertarian Principles\n\nMost contemporary versions of the principles discussed so far allow\nsome role for the market as a means of achieving the desired\ndistributive pattern\u2014the Difference Principle uses it as a\nmeans of helping the least advantaged; utilitarian principles commonly\nuse it as a means of achieving the distributive pattern maximizing\nutility; desert-based principles rely on it to distribute goods\naccording to desert, etc. In contrast, advocates of libertarian\ndistributive principles rarely see the market as a means to some\ndesired pattern, since the principle(s) they advocate do not\nostensibly propose a \u2018pattern\u2019 at all, but instead\ndescribe the sorts of acquisitions or exchanges which are just in\ntheir own right. The market will be just, not as a means to some\npattern, but insofar as the exchanges permitted in the market satisfy\nthe conditions of just acquisition and exchange described by the\nprinciples. For libertarians, just outcomes are those arrived at by\nthe separate just actions of individuals; a particular distributive\npattern is not required for justice. Robert Nozick advanced this\nversion of libertarianism (Nozick 1974), and is its best known\ncontemporary advocate. \n\nNozick proposes a 3-part \u201cEntitlement Theory\u201d.\n\nIf the world were wholly just, the following definition would\nexhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings:\n\n\nA person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle\nof justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding.\nA person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle\nof justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to the holding, is\nentitled to the holding.\nNo one is entitled to a holding except by (repeated) applications\nof (a) and (b).\n\n\nThe complete principle of distributive justice would say simply that a\ndistribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they\npossess under the distribution (Nozick, p.151).\n\n\nThe statement of the Entitlement Theory includes reference to the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and transfer. (For details of\nthese principles see Nozick, pp.149\u2013182.) The principle of\njustice in transfer is the least controversial and is designed to\nspecify fair contracts while ruling out stealing, fraud, etc. The\nprinciple of justice in acquisition is more complicated and more\ncontroversial. The principle is meant to govern the gaining of\nexclusive property rights over the material world. For the\njustification of these rights, Nozick takes his inspiration from John\nLocke\u2019s idea that everyone \u2018owns\u2019 themselves and, by\nmixing one\u2019s labors with the world, self-ownership can generate\nownership of some part of the material world. However, of\nLocke\u2019s mixing metaphor, Nozick legitimately asks:\n\u2018\u2026why isn\u2019t mixing what I own with what I\ndon\u2019t own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of\ngaining what I don\u2019t? If I own a can of tomato juice and spill\nit in the sea so its molecules... mingle evenly throughout the sea, do\nI thereby come to own the sea, or have I foolishly dissipated my\ntomato juice?\u2019 (Nozick 1974, p.174) Nozick concludes that what\nis significant about mixing our labor with the material world is that\nin doing so, we tend to increase the value of it, so that\nself-ownership can lead to ownership of the external world in such\ncases (Nozick 1974, pp. 149\u2013182).\n\nThe obvious objection to this claim is that it is not clear why the\nfirst people to acquire some part of the material world should be able\nto exclude others from it (and, for instance, be the land owners while\nthe later ones become the wage laborers). In response to this\nobjection, Nozick follows Locke in recognizing the need for a\nqualification on just acquisition. According to the Lockean\nProviso, an exclusive acquisition of the external world is just,\nif, after the acquisition, there is \u2018enough and as good left in\ncommon for others\u2019. One of the main challenges for libertarians\nhas been to formulate a morally plausible interpretation of this\nproviso. According to Nozick\u2019s weaker version of Locke\u2019s\nProviso, \u201ca process normally giving rise to a permanent\nbequeathable property right in a previously unowned thing will not do\nso if the position of others no longer at liberty to use the thing is\nthereby worsened\u201d (Nozick, 1974, p. 178). For Nozick\u2019s\ncritics, his proviso is unacceptably weak. This is partly because it\nfails to consider the position others may have achieved under\nalternative distributions and thereby instantiates the morally dubious\ncriterion of whoever is first gets the exclusive spoils. For example,\none can satisfy Nozick\u2019s proviso by \u2018acquiring\u2019 a\nbeach and charging $1 admission to those who previously were able to\nuse the beach for free, so long as one compensates them with a benefit\nthey deem equally valuable, such as a clean-up or life-guarding\nservice on the beach. However, the beach-goers would have been even\nbetter off had the more efficient organizer among them acquired the\nbeach, charging only 50 cents for the same service, but this\nalternative is never considered under Nozick\u2019s proviso (Cohen,\n1995).\n\nWill Kymlicka has given a summary of the steps in Nozick\u2019s\nself-ownership argument:\n\nPeople own themselves.\nThe world is initially unowned.\nYou can acquire absolute rights over a disproportionate share of\nthe world, if you do not worsen the condition of others.\nIt is relatively easy, without worsening the condition of others,\nto acquire absolute rights over a disproportionate share of the world.\nTherefore:\nOnce private property has been appropriated, a free market in\ncapital and labor is morally required (Kymlicka 1990, p. 112).\n\n\nThe assessment of this argument is quite complex, but the difficulties\nmentioned above with the proviso call into question claims (3) and\n(4). The challenge for libertarians then is to find a plausible\nreading of (3) which will yield (4). Moreover, Nozick extends the\noperation of the proviso to apply both to acquisitions and transfers,\ncompounding the problem (Nozick, 1974, p. 174).\n\nEgalitarian leaning theorists generally have opposed Nozick\u2019s\nform of libertarianism on the grounds that its implementation would\nlead to potentially vast material inequalities. However, a subset of\negalitarians have nevertheless been attracted to the normative\nstrength and implications of self-ownership, concerned that an\nunconstrained pursuit of equality could pose a danger to\npeople\u2019s rights over themselves and their labor. G.A. Cohen\neloquently expresses this concern:\n\nIn my experience, leftists who disparage Nozick\u2019s essentially\nunargued affirmation of each person\u2019s rights over himself lose\nconfidence in their unqualified denial of the thesis of self-ownership\nwhen they are asked to consider who has the right to decide what\nshould happen, for example, to their own eyes. They do not immediately\nagree that, were eye transplants easy to achieve, it would then be\nacceptable for the state to conscript potential eye donors into a\nlottery whose losers must yield an eye to beneficiaries who would\notherwise not be one-eyed but blind. (Cohen, 1995, p.70)\n A strong enough commitment to self-ownership would seem\nto protect against such a scenario, as well as providing a\njustification for the view we cannot be forced to give our efforts or\nlabor to others. So a number of egalitarian-leaning theorists who are\nnevertheless deeply committed to self-ownership locate the problematic\naspect of Nozick\u2019s libertarianism in the way it permits and\nprotects particularly strong ownership rights over unequal amounts of\nthe external world. Known as left libertarians, they combine\na fundamental commitment to self-ownership with various egalitarian\nviews of how people can come to have rights to use or own elements of\nthe external world. A key principle in these views is that the mere\npossession of land or natural resources should not be permitted to\ngenerate greater wealth for some. An early version of this combination\nof views can be found in Henry George\u2019s Progress and\nPoverty (1879), in which he argued for the value of land to be\ntaxed while the value added by people\u2019s work be retained by\nthem. Contemporary left libertarians include Hillel Steiner (1994),\nPhilippe Van Parijs (1995), Michael Otsuka (2003) and Peter Vallentyne\n(Vallentyne and Steiner, eds., 2000a and 2000b). In addition to their\ncommitment to self-ownership, they believe self-ownership and equality\ncan be rendered compatible, so long as the Lockean Proviso is given a\nproper and sufficient egalitarian reading. They therefore accept some\nform of egalitarian ownership over (unimproved, or unproduced) natural\nresources, but differ on the form this takes. In the work of Hillel\nSteiner (1994), for example, everyone is a full self-owner and also\nhas a right to an equal share of natural resource value. Both Michael\nOtsuka and Peter Vallentyne defend an equal opportunity\nleft-libertarianism, in which \u201cthose whose initial internal\nendowments provide less favourable effective opportunities for\nwell-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources\u201d\n(Vallentyne, 2009, p. 149). Similarly, Otsuka argues that across a\nwide range of individuals who differ in their capacity to derive\nwelfare from resources, it will be possible to \u201cdistribute\ninitially unowned worldly resources so as to achieve equality of\nopportunity for welfare in a manner which is compatible with each\nperson\u2019s possession of an uninfringed libertarian right of\nself-ownership that is robust rather than merely formal\u201d\n(Otsuka, 2003, see Chapter 1). Philippe Van Parijs (1995) defends an\nunconditional basic income for all, by combining self-ownership with\nthe view that natural resources should be used to promote equality.\n\n\nOf course, many existing holdings are the result of acquisitions or\ntransfers which at some point did not satisfy the principles of\njustice for acquisitions or transfers, however these are understood.\nHence, libertarians who rely on historical principles to underpin\nproperty rights must supplement these with a principle of\nrectification for past injustice, or at least some strategy for\ndealing with unjust holdings. Although Nozick does not specify this\nprinciple he does describe its purpose:\n\nThis principle uses historical information about previous situations\nand injustices done in them... and information about the actual course\nof events that flowed from these injustices, until the present, and it\nyields a description (or descriptions) of holdings in the society. The\nprinciple of rectification presumably will make use of its best\nestimate of subjunctive information about what would have occurred...\nif the injustice had not taken place. If the actual description of\nholdings turns out not to be one of the descriptions yielded by the\nprinciple, then one of the descriptions yielded must be realized.\n(Nozick 1974, pp. 152\u2013153)\n\n\nNozick does not make an attempt to provide a principle of\nrectification. The absence of such a principle is much worse for a\nhistorical theory than for a patterned theory. Past injustices\nsystematically undermine the justice of every subsequent distribution\nin historical theories. Nozick is clear that his historical theory\ncannot be used to evaluate the justice of actual societies until such\na theory of rectification is given or no considerations of\nrectification of injustice could apply to justify the distribution in\nthe actual society: \n\nIn the absence of [a full treatment of the principle of rectification]\napplied to a particular society, one cannot use the analysis\nand theory presented here to condemn any particular scheme of transfer\npayments, unless it is clear that no considerations of rectification\nof injustice could apply to justify it. (Nozick 1974, p.231)\n\n\nUnfortunately for the theory, it would seem that no such treatment\nwill ever be forthcoming because the task is, for all practical\npurposes, impossible. The numbers of injustices perpetrated throughout\nhistory, both within nations and between them, are enormous and the\nnecessary details of the vast majority of injustices are unavailable.\nEven if the details of the injustices were available, the\ncounterfactual causal chains could not be reliably determined. As\nDerek Parfit has pointed out, in a different context, even the people\nwho would have been born would have been different (Parfit 1986). As a\nconsequence, it is difficult to see how Nozick\u2019s entitlement\ntheory could provide guidance as to what the current distribution of\nmaterial holdings should be or what distributions or redistributions\nare legitimate or illegitimate. (Indeed Nozick suggests, for instance,\nthe Difference Principle may be the best implementation of the\nprinciple of rectification.) Although Nozick is fairly candid about\nthis consequence, many of his supporters and critics have ignored it\nand have carried on a vigorous debate as though, contrary to\nNozick\u2019s own statement, his theory can be used to evaluate the\njustice of current economic distributions. \n\nClassical libertarians such as Nozick usually advocate a system in\nwhich there are exclusive property rights, with the role of the\ngovernment restricted to the protection of these property rights. The\nproperty rights commonly rule out taxation for purposes other than\nraising the funds necessary to protect property rights. One of the\nstrongest critiques of any attempt to institute such a system of\nlegally protected strong property rights comes, as we have seen, from\nNozick\u2019s theory itself\u2014there seems no obvious reason to\ngive strong legal protection to property rights which have arisen\nthrough violations of the just principles of acquisition and transfer.\nBut putting this critique to one side for a moment, what other\narguments are made in favor of exclusionary property rights?\n\nAs already noted, Nozick argues that because people own themselves and\nhence their talents, they own whatever they can produce with these\ntalents. Moreover, it is possible in a free market to sell the\nproducts of exercising one\u2019s talents. Any taxation of the income\nfrom such selling, according to Nozick, \u2018institute[s] (partial)\nownership by others of people and their actions and labor\u2019\n(Nozick, p. 172). People, according to this argument, have these\nexclusive rights of ownership. Taxation then, simply involves\nviolating these rights and allowing some people to own (partially)\nother people. Moreover, it is argued, any system not legally\nrecognizing these rights violates Immanuel Kant\u2019s maxim to treat\npeople always as ends in themselves and never merely as a means. The\ntwo main difficulties with this argument have been: (1) to show that\nself-ownership is only compatible with having such strong exclusive\nproperty rights; and (2) that a system of exclusive property rights is\nthe best system for treating people with respect, as ends in\nthemselves.\n\nNozick candidly accepts that he does not himself give a systematic\nmoral justification of the exclusionary property rights he advocates:\n\u2018This book does not present a precise theory of the moral basis\nof individual rights.\u2019 (Nozick, p.xiv) But others have tried to\nprovide more systematic justifications of similar rights (Lomasky,\nSteiner) or to develop, more fully, justifications to which Nozick\nalludes.\n\nIn addition to the arguments from self-ownership, and the requirement\nto treat people as ends in themselves, the most common other route for\ntrying to justify exclusive property rights has been to argue that\nthey are required for the maximization of freedom and/or liberty or\nthe minimization of violations of these (Hayek 1960). As an empirical\nclaim though, this appears to be false. If we compare countries with\nless exclusionary property rights (e.g. more taxation) with countries\nwith more exclusionary property regimes, we see no systematic\nadvantage in freedoms or liberties enjoyed by people in the latter\ncountries. (Of course, we do see a difference in distribution\nof such freedoms or liberties. In the latter countries, the richer\nhave more and the poorer less, while in the former they are more\nevenly distributed.) Now if libertarians restrict what counts as a\nvaluable freedom/liberty (and discount other freedoms/liberties people\nvalue), it will follow that exclusionary property rights are required\nto maximize freedom and/or liberty or to minimize violations of these.\nBut the challenge for these libertarians is to show why only their\nfavored liberties and freedoms are valuable, and not those which are\nweakened by a system of exclusive property rights.\n",
