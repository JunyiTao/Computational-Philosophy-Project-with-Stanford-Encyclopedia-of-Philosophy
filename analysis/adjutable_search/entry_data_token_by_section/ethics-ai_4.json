    "main_text": "Main Debates || Privacy & Surveillance\n2.1 Privacy & Surveillance\n\nThere is a general discussion about privacy and surveillance in\ninformation technology (e.g., Macnish 2017; Roessler 2017), which\nmainly concerns the access to private data and data that is personally\nidentifiable. Privacy has several well recognised aspects, e.g.,\n\u201cthe right to be let alone\u201d, information privacy, privacy\nas an aspect of personhood, control over information about oneself,\nand the right to secrecy (Bennett and Raab 2006). Privacy studies have\nhistorically focused on state surveillance by secret services but now\ninclude surveillance by other state agents, businesses, and even\nindividuals. The technology has changed significantly in the last\ndecades while regulation has been slow to respond (though there is the\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679)\u2014the result is a certain anarchy that\nis exploited by the most powerful players, sometimes in plain sight,\nsometimes in hiding.\n\nThe digital sphere has widened greatly: All data collection and\nstorage is now digital, our lives are increasingly digital, most\ndigital data is connected to a single Internet, and there is more and\nmore sensor technology in use that generates data about non-digital\naspects of our lives. AI increases both the possibilities of\nintelligent data collection and the possibilities for data analysis.\nThis applies to blanket surveillance of whole populations as well as\nto classic targeted surveillance. In addition, much of the data is\ntraded between agents, usually for a fee.\n\nAt the same time, controlling who collects which data, and who has\naccess, is much harder in the digital world than it was in the\nanalogue world of paper and telephone calls. Many new AI technologies\namplify the known issues. For example, face recognition in photos and\nvideos allows identification and thus profiling and searching for\nindividuals (Whittaker et al. 2018: 15ff). This continues using other\ntechniques for identification, e.g., \u201cdevice\nfingerprinting\u201d, which are commonplace on the Internet\n(sometimes revealed in the \u201cprivacy policy\u201d). The result\nis that \u201cIn this vast ocean of data, there is a frighteningly\ncomplete picture of us\u201d (Smolan 2016: 1:01). The result is\narguably a scandal that still has not received due public\nattention.\n\nThe data trail we leave behind is how our \u201cfree\u201d services\nare paid for\u2014but we are not told about that data collection and\nthe value of this new raw material, and we are manipulated into\nleaving ever more such data. For the \u201cbig 5\u201d companies\n(Amazon, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook), the main\ndata-collection part of their business appears to be based on\ndeception, exploiting human weaknesses, furthering procrastination,\ngenerating addiction, and manipulation (Harris 2016 [OIR]). The\nprimary focus of social media, gaming, and most of the Internet in\nthis \u201csurveillance economy\u201d is to gain, maintain, and\ndirect attention\u2014and thus data supply. \u201cSurveillance is\nthe business model of the Internet\u201d (Schneier 2015). This\nsurveillance and attention economy is sometimes called\n\u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d (Zuboff 2019). It has caused\nmany attempts to escape from the grasp of these corporations, e.g., in\nexercises of \u201cminimalism\u201d (Newport 2019), sometimes\nthrough the open source movement, but it appears that present-day\ncitizens have lost the degree of autonomy needed to escape while fully\ncontinuing with their life and work. We have lost ownership of our\ndata, if \u201cownership\u201d is the right relation here. Arguably,\nwe have lost control of our data.\n\nThese systems will often reveal facts about us that we ourselves wish\nto suppress or are not aware of: they know more about us than we know\nourselves. Even just observing online behaviour allows insights into\nour mental states (Burr and Christianini 2019) and manipulation (see\nbelow\n section 2.2).\n This has led to calls for the protection of \u201cderived\ndata\u201d (Wachter and Mittelstadt 2019). With the last sentence of\nhis bestselling book, Homo Deus, Harari asks about the\nlong-term consequences of AI:\n\n\nWhat will happen to society, politics and daily life when\nnon-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we\nknow ourselves? (2016: 462)\n\n\nRobotic devices have not yet played a major role in this area, except\nfor security patrolling, but this will change once they are more\ncommon outside of industry environments. Together with the\n\u201cInternet of things\u201d, the so-called \u201csmart\u201d\nsystems (phone, TV, oven, lamp, virtual assistant, home,\u2026),\n\u201csmart city\u201d (Sennett 2018), and \u201csmart\ngovernance\u201d, they are set to become part of the data-gathering\nmachinery that offers more detailed data, of different types, in real\ntime, with ever more information.\n\nPrivacy-preserving techniques that can largely conceal the identity of\npersons or groups are now a standard staple in data science; they\ninclude (relative) anonymisation , access control (plus encryption),\nand other models where computation is carried out with fully or\npartially encrypted input data (Stahl and Wright 2018); in the case of\n\u201cdifferential privacy\u201d, this is done by adding calibrated\nnoise to encrypt the output of queries (Dwork et al. 2006; Abowd\n2017). While requiring more effort and cost, such techniques can avoid\nmany of the privacy issues. Some companies have also seen better\nprivacy as a competitive advantage that can be leveraged and sold at a\nprice.\n\nOne of the major practical difficulties is to actually enforce\nregulation, both on the level of the state and on the level of the\nindividual who has a claim. They must identify the responsible legal\nentity, prove the action, perhaps prove intent, find a court that\ndeclares itself competent \u2026 and eventually get the court to\nactually enforce its decision. Well-established legal protection of\nrights such as consumer rights, product liability, and other civil\nliability or protection of intellectual property rights is often\nmissing in digital products, or hard to enforce. This means that\ncompanies with a \u201cdigital\u201d background are used to testing\ntheir products on the consumers without fear of liability while\nheavily defending their intellectual property rights. This\n\u201cInternet Libertarianism\u201d is sometimes taken to assume\nthat technical solutions will take care of societal problems by\nthemselves (Mozorov 2013).\n",
