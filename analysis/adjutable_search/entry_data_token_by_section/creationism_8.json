    "main_text": "The Explanatory Filter\n9. The Explanatory Filter\n\nBehe is in need of help. This supposedly comes from a conceptual\nargument in favor of Intelligent Design due to the also-mentioned,\nphilosopher-mathematician William Dembski (1998a, b). Let us first\nlook at his argument, and then see how it helps Behe.\n\nDembski\u2019s aim is two-fold. First, to give us the criteria by which we\ndistinguish something that we would label \u2018designed\u2019\nrather than otherwise. Second, to put this into context, and show how\nwe distinguish design from something produced naturally by law or\nsomething we would put down to chance. As far as inferring design is\nconcerned, there are three notions of importance: contingency,\ncomplexity, and specification. Design has to be something which is not\ncontingent. The example that Dembski uses is the message from outer\nspace received in the movie Contact. The series of dots and\ndashes, zeros and ones, could not be deduced from the laws of physics.\nBut do they show evidence of design? Suppose we can interpret the\nseries in a binary fashion, and the initial yield is the number group,\n2, 3, 5. As it happens, these are the beginning of the prime-number\nseries, but with so small a yield no one is going to get very excited.\nIt could just be chance. So no one is going to insist on design yet.\nBut suppose now you keep going on the series, and it turns out that it\nyields in exact and precise order the prime numbers up to 101. Now you\nwill start to think that something is up, because the situation seems\njust too complex to be mere chance. It is highly improbable.\n\u2018Complexity as I am describing it here is a form of\nprobability\u2026.\u2019 (Dembski 2000, 27).\n\nBut although you are probably happy now to conclude (on the basis of\nthe prime-number sequence) that there are extraterrestrials out there,\nin fact there is another thing needed. \u2018If I flip a coin 1000\ntimes, I will participate in a highly complex (that is, highly\nimprobable) event\u2026. This sequence of coin tosses will not,\nhowever, trigger a design inference. Though complex, this sequence\nwill not exhibit a suitable pattern.\u2019 Here, we have a contrast\nwith the prime-number sequence from 2 to 101. \u2018Not only is this\nsequence complex, but it also embodies a suitable pattern. The SETI\nresearcher who in the movie Contact discovered this sequence put it\nthis way: \u201cThis isn\u2019t noise, this has structure\u201d\u2019\n(pp. 27\u20138). What is going on here? You recognize in design something\nwhich is not just arbitrary or chance or which is given status only\nafter the experiment or discovery, but rather something that was or\ncould be in some way specified, insisted upon, before you set out. You\nknow or could work out the sequence of prime numbers at any time\nbefore or after the contact from space. The random sequence of penny\ntosses will come only after the event. \u2018The key concept is that\nof \u201cindependence\u201d. I define a specification as a match\nbetween an event and an independently given pattern. Events that are\nboth highly complex and specified (that is, that match an\nindependently given pattern) indicate design.\u2019 \n\nDembski is now in a position to move on to the second part of his\nargument where we actually detect design. Here we have what he calls\nan \u2018Explanatory Filter\u2019 (Dembski 1998a, b). We have a\nparticular phenomenon. The question is, what caused it? Is it\nsomething which might not have happened, given the laws of nature? Is\nit contingent? Or was it necessitated? The moon goes endlessly round\nthe earth. We know that it does this because of (the updated version\nof) Newton\u2019s laws. End of discussion. No design here. However, now we\nhave some rather strange new phenomenon, the causal origin of which is\na puzzle. Suppose we have a mutation, where although we can quantify\nover large numbers we cannot predict at an individual level. There is\nno immediate subsumption beneath law, and therefore there is no reason\nto think that at this level it was necessary. Let us say, as\nsupposedly happened in the extended royal family of Europe, there was\na mutation to a gene responsible for hemophilia. Is it complex?\nObviously not, for it leads to breakdown rather than otherwise. Hence\nit is appropriate to talk now of chance. There is no design. The\nhemophilia mutation was just an accident. \n\nSuppose now that we do have complexity. A rather intricate mineral\npattern in the rocks might qualify here. Suppose we have veins of\nprecious metals set in other materials, the whole being intricate and\nvaried \u2013 certainly not a pattern you could simply deduce from\nthe laws of physics or chemistry or geology or whatever. Nor would one\nthink of it as being a breakdown mess, as one might a bad mutation. Is\nthis now design? Almost certainly not, for there is no way that one\nmight pre-specify such a pattern. It is all a bit ad hoc, and\nnot something which comes across as the result of conscious intention.\nAnd then finally there are phenomena which are complex and specified.\nOne presumes that the microscopical biological apparatuses and\nprocesses discussed by Behe would qualify here. They are not contingent,\nfor they are irreducibly complex. They are design-like for they do\nwhat is needed for the organism in which they are to be found. That is\nto say they are of pre-specified form. And so, having survived the\nexplanatory filter, they are properly considered the product of real\ndesign. \n\nNow, with the conceptual argument laid out in full, we are in a\nposition to turn back to Behe and to see how Dembski\u2019s explanatory\nfilter is supposed to let Behe\u2019s god off the hook with respect to the\nproblem of evil. Given the explanatory filter, a bad mutation would\nsurely get caught by the filter half-way down. It would be siphoned\noff to the side as chance, if not indeed simply put down as necessity.\nIt certainly would not pass the specification test. This would mean\nthat a dreadful genetic disease would not be the fault of the\ndesigner, whereas successful complex mechanisms would be to the\ndesigner\u2019s credit. Dembski stresses that these are mutually exclusive\nalternatives. \u2018To attribute an event to design is to say that it\ncannot plausibly be referred to either law or chance. In\ncharacterizing design as the set-theoretic complement of the\ndisjunction law-or-chance, one therefore guarantees that these three\nmodes of explanation will be mutually exclusive and exhaustive\u2019\n(Dembski 1998b, 98).\n",
