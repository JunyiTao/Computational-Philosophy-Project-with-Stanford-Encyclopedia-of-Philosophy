    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus || Happiness in Facing One\u2019s Fate\n3.4 Happiness in Facing One\u2019s Fate\n\nHow then to remain consistent with absurd reasoning and avoid falling\nvictim to the \u201cspirit of nostalgia\u201d? The Myth of\nSisyphus finds the answer by abandoning the terrain of philosophy\naltogether. Camus describes a number of absurdist fictional characters\nand activities, including Don Juan and Dostoevsky\u2019s Kirolov\n(The Possessed), theater, and literary creation. And then he\nconcludes with the story of Sisyphus, who fully incarnates a sense of\nlife\u2019s absurdity, its \u201cfutility and hopeless labor\u201d\n(MS, 119). Camus sees Sisyphus\u2019s endless effort and\nintense consciousness of futility as a triumph. \u201cHis\nscorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won\nhim that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted\ntoward accomplishing nothing\u201d (MS, 120). After the\ndense and highly self-conscious earlier chapters, these pages condense\nthe entire line of thought into a vivid image. Sisyphus demonstrates\nthat we can live with \u201cthe certainty of a crushing fate, without\nthe resignation that ought to accompany it\u201d (MS, 54).\nFor Camus, Sisyphus reminds us that we cannot help seeking to\nunderstand the reality that transcends our intelligence, striving to\ngrasp more than our limited and practical scientific understanding\nallows, and wishing to live without dying. Like Sisyphus, we are our\nfate, and our frustration is our very life: we can never escape\nit.\n\nBut there is more. After the rock comes tumbling down, confirming the\nultimate futility of his project, Sisyphus trudges after it once\nagain. This \u201cis the hour of consciousness. At each of those\nmoments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks towards the\nlairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his\nrock\u201d (MS, 121). Why use the words\n\u201csuperior\u201d and \u201cstronger\u201d when he has no hope\nof succeeding the next time? Paradoxically, it is because a sense of\ntragedy \u201ccrowns his victory.\u201d \u201cSisyphus, proletarian\nof the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his\nwretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent\u201d\n(MS, 121). Tragic consciousness is the conclusion of\n\u201cabsurd reasoning\u201d: living fully aware of the bitterness\nof our being and consciously facing our fate.\n\nWhat then is Camus\u2019s reply to his question about whether or not\nto commit suicide? Full consciousness, avoiding false solutions such\nas religion, refusing to submit, and carrying on with vitality and\nintensity: these are Camus\u2019s answers. This is how a life without\nultimate meaning can be made worth living. As he said in\nNuptials, life\u2019s pleasures are inseparable from a keen\nawareness of these limits. Sisyphus accepts and embraces living with\ndeath without the possibility of appealing to God. \u201cAll\nSisyphus\u2019s silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to\nhim. His rock is his thing\u201d (MS, 123).\n\nLucidly living the human condition, Sisyphus \u201cknows himself to\nbe the master of his days.\u201d By becoming conscious of it, Camus\nis saying, he takes ownership of it. In this sense Sisyphus reshapes\nhis fate into a condition of \u201cwholly human origin.\u201d\n\u201cWholly\u201d may be an exaggeration, because after all, death\nis \u201cinevitable and despicable,\u201d but it is the very\ncondition of living. In acknowledging this, Sisyphus consciously lives\nout what has been imposed on him, thus making it into his own end. In\nthe same way, Meursault, protagonist of The Stranger, comes\nto consciousness in that book\u2019s second part after committing the\ninexplicable murder that ends the book\u2019s first part. He has\nlived his existence from one moment to the next and without much\nawareness, but at his trial and while awaiting execution he becomes\nlike Sisyphus, fully conscious of himself and his terrible fate. He\nwill die triumphant as the absurd man.\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus is far from having a skeptical\nconclusion. In response to the lure of suicide, Camus counsels an\nintensely conscious and active non-resolution. Rejecting any hope of\nresolving the strain is also to reject despair. Indeed, it is\npossible, within and against these limits, to speak of happiness.\n\u201cHappiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They\nare inseparable\u201d (MS, 122). It is not that discovering\nthe absurd leads necessarily to happiness, but rather that\nacknowledging the absurd means also accepting human frailty, an\nawareness of our limitations, and the fact that we cannot help wishing\nto go beyond what is possible. These are all tokens of being fully\nalive. \u201cThe struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill\na man\u2019s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d\n(MS, 123).\n",
