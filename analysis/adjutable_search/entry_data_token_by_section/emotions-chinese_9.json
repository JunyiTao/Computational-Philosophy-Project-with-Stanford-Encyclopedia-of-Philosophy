    "main_text": "Interpretations of Qing || Qing as Mutual Arousal and Response among Things\n3.3 Qing as Mutual Arousal and Response among Things\n\nBruya (2003) reports that, in many pre-Han texts, qing refers\nto affective states of the mind. Although he does not disagree with\nGraham (1990) that qing, in some contexts of pre-Han\nliterature, means nature, essence, or genuineness of things, he points\nout that qing also means feelings or emotions in other\ncontexts. In fact, qing is closely related to affective\nstates in several pre-Han texts such as the Mencius and the\nXunzi. He states that \u201cthe defining of\n\u2018qing\u2019 in terms of emotions can be now be seen\nexplicitly as early as Mencius\u2026\u201d and argues that the\n\u201cimplicit early cosmology of spontaneous interrelation among\nthings (humans included)\u201d is in the background of the polysemous\nnature of qing (Bruya 2003: 163). He explains that\nqing has at least two different meanings, one being facts or\nsituations and the other being feelings and emotions. However the two\nmeanings, although contrastive or distinctive, are not necessarily\nincommensurable or incomparable to each other because qing\nhas \u201cimplicit emotional overtones in early usage\u201d and\nthese implicit connections between the two meanings became apparent\nand explicit in Chinese texts in the late Warring States period such\nas the Mencius and the Xunzi (Bruya 2003: 152n3).\nAccording to him, the gradual transition or perhaps transformation\nfrom the onto-objective pole (i.e., qing as nature or\nreality) to psycho-subjective pole (i.e, qing as an\ninteractive psychological state of the mind) of qing took\nplace in Mencius\u2019s period and clearly observed in the\nXunzi. He (2003: 169) states that \n\n\nqing is closely associated with mutual arousal and response,\nthe processes of transformation through interpenetration \n\n\nand this general (albeit vague and implicit) understanding of the\nuniverse and human affairs precedes the philosophical discussions of\nqing as an affective state of the mind in the Warring States\nperiod (Bruya 2003: 168\u2013169). For example, he (2003: 163) states\nthat \n\n\nthe defining \u201cqing\u201d in terms of emotions can now\nbe seen explicitly as early as Mencius, and its implicit content can\nbe seen as far back as the Shujing [\u66f8\u7d93 the Book of\nDocuments]. \n\n\nIt is important to note that, in Bruya\u2019s explanation, the\nsemantic transition or conceptual change of qing is not\nunderstood as a sudden shift of viewpoints from the external to\ninternal dimensions of qing. Rather, it is understood as a\ngradual process of the integration and interpenetration of the\nexternal and internal aspects of qing via a particular form\nof philosophical psychology, i.e., understanding of the mind and its\ninner states as a resonating and interactive flow that derives from\nthe generative and interpenetrative cosmological force.\n",
