    "main_text": "Implementations and Applications || Reasoning about Probabilities\n7.2 Reasoning about Probabilities\n\nSections 5.7\nand 5.8 above\ndiscussed probabilistic semantics for defeasible logics. It is also\npossible to reason defeasibly about propositions\nthat explicitly involve numerical probabilities. We can\nreason defeasibly about propositions that assign specific\nprobabilities to the other propositions or that assert numerical\nrelations (identity, inequalities) between such propositions.\n\nChitta Baral, Michael Gelfond, and Nelson Rushton (Baral et al. 2009)\nhave developed a declarative language P-Log, which combines defeasible\nlogic with Bayesian probability nets. They use Answer Set Prolog to\nprovide the logical foundations. They make use of a version of the\nprinciple of indifference. Belief revision occurs by means of Bayesian\nconditioning. Baral et al. demonstrate that P-log can reason correctly\nabout the Monty Hall problem and Simpson\u2019s paradox. See Gelfond and\nKahl 2014, pp. 235\u2013270 for the syntax and semantics of P-log.\n\nJoohyung Lee and Yi Wang (Lee and Wang 2016) take a somewhat different\napproach, using the log-linear models of Markov Logic (Richardson and\nDomingos 2006), which they argue is a natural way to add probabilistic\ninformation to stable semantics for logic programming languages. A\nMarkov Logic network is a way of finding the probability distribution\nto a Markov chain that is stationary, i.e., stable with\nrespect to updating. Their approach incorporates the ProbLog model of\nFierens et al. 2015 as a special case.\n\nAnthony Hunter has developed a strategy for using argumentation theory\nto reason with incomplete and even inconsistent information about\nprobabilities (Hunter 2020). Once inconsistencies have been eliminated\nby belief contraction, Hunter relies on the maximum entropy\ndistribution that is consistent with the remaining constraints to\ndefine the optimal probability function.\n7.3 Software Implementations\n\nArguMed by Verheij (Verheij 2005) computes a version of\nstable semantics. Chris Reed and Glenn Rowe (Reed and Rowe 2004) have\ndeveloped Araucaria, an application for analyzing and\ndiagramming legal arguments. Prakken\u2019s ASPIC+ system (Prakken\n2010) can be used in analyzing formal argumentative structures.\n\nMichael Gelfond and Yulia Kahl (Gelfond and Kahl 2014, 131\u2013151)\ndiscuss how to develop algorithms for efficiently computing answer\nsets for logic programming. They describe inference engines that can\nact as answer-set programming solvers.\n7.4 Efficiency in Updating\n\nAn important practical problem that arises from applying formal models\nof defeasible reasoning is that of updating in light of new or\nretracted information. Must we re-compute the nonmonotonic\nconsequences from scratch each time updating is required?\n\nBeishui Liao and his collaborators (Liao et al. 2011) addressed the\nissue of the computational dynamics of argument systems by\ninvestigating under which conditions an argument system can be divided\ninto modules, so that the implications of new information can be\nefficiently computed by updating only the affected module. They\ndiscovered that such modularity is possible for any semantics that has\nthe property of directionality. A semantics is directional if\nand only if, for every argument structure AS, the\nintersection of any extension prescribed for AS with an\nunattacked set /(U/) is identical to one of the extensions prescribed\nfor the restriction of AS to \\(U\\), and vice versa.
