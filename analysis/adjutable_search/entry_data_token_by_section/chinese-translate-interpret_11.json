    "main_text": "Methodological Issues || Translating the Truth\n4.2 Translating the Truth\n Davidson\u2019s focus on propositional truth\n(\u00a72.2 above) is altogether in\nkeeping with the concern of most Anglophone 20th century\nphilosophers to analyze language as the main means of communicating\nfacts about the world to our fellow human beings. When the facts are\nindeed as communicated, we say the statements expressing them are\n\u201ctrue\u201d. The precise nature of the relation between the\nfacts and the statements of them has generated different theories of\ntruth\u2014correspondence, coherence, pragmatic, semantic, even\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d\u2014with the question remaining an open\none today, although fewer philosophers are pursuing an answer to\nit.\n No matter which theory one adopts, elaborating this concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d involves a cluster of related\nconcepts: sentence, proposition, statement, fact, semantics,\nreference, connotation, denotation, plus a few others. There is\nanother conception of \u201ctruth\u201d, however, where the direct\nconveying of information is not central to the definition, and\nconsequently \u201cknowledge\u201d is also conceived somewhat\ndifferently. Other uses of language might be equally or more important\nfor some philosophers. Remember Chad Hansen\u2019s claim\n(\u00a72.2) that all of the\nearly Chinese philosophers held that \u201clanguage is a social\npractice. Its basic function is guiding discourse \u201d (1992:\n3). If so, then the standard translation of the graph zhi as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d becomes problematic, identified as it is with\n\u201cjustified true belief\u201d. Rosemont argues that \u201cWe\nare inclined to focus on the informative uses of language, that is,\nthe transmission of knowledge that\u201d. On his account\nreaders will profit more if zhi is translated as\n\u201crealize\u201d instead of \u201cknowledge\u201d, following\nHall and Ames (1987). \u201cIf \u2018to personalize\u2019 means\n\u2018to make personal\u2019, then \u2018to realize\u2019 is\n\u2018to make real\u2019 in the sense of knowing how, knowing\nabout, knowing to\u201d (Rosemont 2012: 47). Much the same thing\nhas been noted by Stephen Angle and Justin Tiwald in a forthcoming\nbook on Neo-Confucianism, in which they say they will focus on\n\u201cknowledge as an activity rather than knowledge as a set of\ntruths\u201d (2015: 5, 1).\nThis, too, may be construed as \u201ctruth\u201d, even though not\npropositional, and with a different concept-cluster around\nit: authenticity, engagement, trustworthy,\nintegrity, honesty, upright, and more. In\n2014 a Symposium celebrating the inauguration of a new online journal\nof cross-cultural philosophy (Confluence, 1, 1) was devoted\nto the question of whether the concept of truth was useful in the\npursuit of cross-cultural philosophical research. The four symposiasts\nrepresented Japanese philosophy, Confucianism, Aztec philosophy and\nTibetan Buddhism. None of them found close approximations for\n\u201ctruth\u201d in the propositional sense in the cultures they\nstudied, but all four said there were analogues for the terms\nassociated with truth as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d in the lexicons of\nthe thinkers and traditions they worked with. This non-propositional\nsense of truth is of course not unknown in the West; everyone\nunderstands what Vaclav Havel meant when he entitled an anthology of\nhis essays Living in Truth (1990). But it has not been a\nmajor concern among English-speaking philosophers since the analytic\nmovement got under way a little over a century ago.\nHelping people to hold true beliefs is a very worthwhile endeavor,\nand so is helping them transform themselves to lead meaningful\nlives. The translator/interpreter must be aware of which approach is\nreflected in the text under examination. If we believe the author(s)\nwere concerned with the way things are in the world, we will employ\ninterpretive methods to ascertain the truth of the claims made,\nnamely, those methods concerned with propositional truth: logical and\nlinguistic analysis, especially in the Anglophone tradition, and/or\nhermeneutics or phenomenology among continental philosophers.\n If we understand the ancient Chinese philosophers as having\nanother basic aim, however, we might pause at using Western\ninterpretive strategies adopted for propositional truth-seeking to\nstudy the praxis-guiding normative statements of the Chinese. In\npraxis-guiding discourse(s) human flourishing for oneself and others\nwas the basic concern. Put another way, the standard style of Western\nphilosophical writings tends to be explanatory and justificatory,\nwhereas the Chinese style tends to be narrative (of experience) and\nnormative. There are exceptions in both cases of course; normativity\nis no more unknown in the West than explanations are in China. But in\ngeneral truth is associated with facts and propositions in modern\nWestern philosophical texts, and with values and the conduct of\none\u2019s life in China\u2019s classical texts. If so, it is by no\nmeans clear that the methodologies developed for philosophical\ncritiques and exegeses in the modern Western tradition are suitable\nfor application mutatis mutandis to Chinese classical\nwritings; attempting to uncover and explicate one kind of truth may\nwell hinder acquiring insights about the other.\n",
