    "main_text": "Aspects of Illocutionary Force\n3. Aspects of Illocutionary Force\n\n\nAustin distinguishes illocutionary acts into five categories:\nverdictives (in which a speaker gives a verdict, e.g. acquitting and\ndiagnosing), exercitives (in which speakers exercise powers, rights or\ninfluence, e.g. excommunicating and resigning), commissives (in which\nspeakers commit themselves to causes or courses of action,\ne.g. promising and betting), behabitives (concerning attitudes and\nsocial behavior, e.g. apologizing and toasting), and expositives (in\nwhich speakers clarify how their utterances fit into lines of\nreasoning, e.g., postulating and defining).\n\nSearle (1975) criticizes Austin\u2019s taxonomy on two central\ngrounds. First, Austin\u2019s methodology is unduly lexicographic,\nassuming that we can learn about the range and limits of illocutionary\nacts by studying illocutionary verbs in English or other natural\nlanguages. However, Searle observes, nothing rules out the possibility\nof there being illocutionary acts that are not named by a verb either\nin a particular language such as Swahili or Bengali, or indeed in any\nlanguage at all; similarly, two non-synonymous illocutionary verbs may\nyet name one and the same illocutionary act.\n\nSecond, Searle argues that the principles of distinction among\nAustin\u2019s categories are unclear. For instance, behavitives seem\nto be a heterogeneous group with little unifying principle. Similarly,\n\u2018describe\u2019 appears both as a verdictive and as an\nexpositive whereas one would expect taxonomic categories to be\nmutually exclusive. More generally, Austin\u2019s brief account of\neach category gives no direction as to why this way of delineating\nthem does so along their most fundamental features. Searle offers a\nnew categorization of speech acts based on relatively clear principles\nof distinction. To appreciate this it will help to explain some of the\nbasic concepts he uses for this purpose.\n",
