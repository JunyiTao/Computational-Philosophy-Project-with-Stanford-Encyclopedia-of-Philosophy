    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Proving God\u2019s existence\n6.1 Proving God\u2019s existence\n\n\nThe first question of Book I of the Lectura, is\n\u201cWhether the wayfarer can know that God exists by means of\nphilosophical proof,\u201d and a number of arguments are presented,\nsix against and six for. He tells us how he will deal with the\nproblem: firstly, he will deal with the question as to whether the\nexistence of God as such can be known and then, secondly, whether one\ncan have both faith and knowledge of the same thing at the same\ntime. Then, thirdly, he will examine the various authorities. This is\nthe basic structure followed in the rest of the Lectura, even\nif FitzRalph did not always reorganize his material fully in this\nmanner, since sometimes individual articles remain on their own or\nquestions are left unresolved. FitzRalph quotes the views of Henry of\nGhent on demonstrating the existence of God, but he accepts the\nposition of Aquinas. Again, regarding whether God\u2019s existence is\nevident or not, he follows Aquinas. There then follows a long and\nelaborate treatment of the ontological argument but, curiously, no\nform of a cosmological argument is to be found in his writings.  It\nmust be surmised that the latter was not the focus of debate in Oxford\nat this time. \n",
