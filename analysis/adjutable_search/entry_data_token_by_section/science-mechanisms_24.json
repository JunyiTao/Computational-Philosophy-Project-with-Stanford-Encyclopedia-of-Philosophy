    "main_text": "Discovery: From A-ha Moments to Discovery Strategies || Discovery via Strategies\n6.2 Discovery via Strategies\nBechtel and Richardson\u2019s Discovering Complexity (2010\n[1993]) is organized around a flowchart representing choice-points in\nthe discovery of a mechanism. The process of searching for mechanisms\nbegins with a provisional characterization of the phenomenon. Then\nfollow strategies of localizing the mechanism within the\nsystem, and decomposing the phenomenon into distinct\nsub-functions. Localization of function involves determining which of\nthese sub-functions of the system is performed by which parts. Bechtel\nand Richardson further characterize the use of excitatory and\ninhibitory experiments to obtain these kinds of information. Bechtel\nand Abrahamsen (2013) add a subsequent stage, in which\nscientists recompose what they have learned about the\nfunctional parts by putting them back together to produce the\nphenomenon in question (perhaps using simulations). \nDarden also emphasized mechanisms as an important framework concept\nin scientific discovery (Darden 1980, 1982, 1986, 1991). In the\ndiscovery of protein synthesis (jointly investigated by molecular\nbiologists and biochemists in the 1950s and 1960s), scientists didn\u2019t\nsimply have an \u201cA-ha\u201d moment. Rather, they deployed\nstrategies for revealing how a mechanism works (Darden 2006; Craver\nand Darden 2013). Darden characterizes the process of mechanism\ndiscovery as an \u201cextended, piecemeal process with hypotheses\nundergoing iterative refinement\u201d; that process occurs via the\nconstruction, evaluation, and revision of mechanism schemas in light\nof observational and experimental constraints (Darden 2006: 272).\nDarden\u2019s construction strategies are strategies for generating new\nhypotheses about a mechanism. In addition to decomposition and\nlocalization, Darden shows that scientists often borrow a schema\ntype from another area of science, as when selection-type\nmechanisms were borrowed to understand how the immune system works, or\nassemble a mechanism from known modules of functional activity\n(modular sub-assembly), as is common in biochemistry and\nmolecular biology. Sometimes, scientists know one part of the\nmechanism and attempt to work forward or backward through to the other\nparts and activities. In the discovery of the mechanism of protein\nsynthesis, for example, molecular biologists worked forward from the\nstructure of DNA to figure out what molecules could interact with it\n(forward chaining), and biochemists worked backward from\nproteins to figure out what chemical reactions would be necessary to\ncreate them (backward chaining). They met in the middle at\nRNA. Protein synthesis is now understood to involve transcribing DNA\ninto RNA and then translating RNA into proteins. Far from being\nphilosophically inscrutable, Darden points out that scientists used\nwhat they knew about the working entities and activities in the\nmechanism to infer what could come next or before in the mechanism of\nprotein synthesis (Darden 2006; see\nalso the entry on \nmolecular biology).\nEvaluation strategies, for Darden, involve constraint-based\nreasoning to limn the contours of the space of possible\nmechanisms for a given phenomenon. Often scientists reason about how a\nmechanism works by building off basic findings concerning the spatial\nand temporal organization of its parts. Harvey, for example, reasoned\nhis way to the circulation of the blood by considering the locations\nof the valves of the veins and their orientation with respect to the\nheart. These organizational constraints, and many others, combined to\nnarrow the space of possible mechanisms to a small region containing a\nmodel in which the blood completes a circuit of the body (Craver and\nDarden 2013).\nDarden and Craver also discuss experimental strategies for learning\nhow a mechanism works. These strategies reveal how different entities\nand activities in a mechanism act, interact, and are organized\ntogether. For example, one might intervene to remove a putative\ncomponent to see if and how the mechanism functions in its absence\n(inhibitory experiments). Or one might stimulate\nthat component to see if it can drive the mechanism or modulate its\nbehavior. Or one might activate a mechanism by placing it in\nthe precipitating conditions for the phenomenon and observe how the\nentity or activity changes as the mechanism works. Craver (2002)\ndiscusses these under the heading of \u201cinterlevel\nexperiments\u201d (see also Harinen forthcoming). \nCraver and Darden (2013) also discuss more complex\nkinds of experiments for learning what sort of entity or activity\ncontributes to a process and for learning more complex features of a\nmechanism\u2019s organization.\nDatteri (2009; Datteri and Tamburrini 2007), explores the use of\nrobotic simulations for the purposes of testing mechanisms. They\ndiscuss both how assumptions are built into robotic models and how\nexperiments can be designed to reveal how mechanisms work. This work\nextends the mechanistic framework into the area of bio-robotics and\nreveals a set of strategies distinct from those explored in Darden\u2019s\nwork.\nRather than focusing on the process by which mechanism schemas are\nconstructed, evaluated, and revised, Steele focuses on the question of\nhow one extrapolates from a sample population or a model organism to\nthe structure of a mechanism in the target. Will a treatment proven to\nsuppress tumors in mice (a model organism) also suppress tumors in\nhumans (the target population)? After developing a probabilistic\naccount of mechanisms, Steele considers how researchers get around\nwhat he calls the extrapolator\u2019s circle: determining\n\nhow we could know that the model and the target are\nsimilar in causally relevant respects without already knowing the\ncausal relationship in the target. (Steel 2008: 78)\n\n Steel breaks the extrapolator\u2019s circle by\ndeveloping a mechanisms-based extrapolation strategy\u2014the\nstrategy of comparative process tracing. Once a mechanism for\nsome phenomenon has been elucidated in a model (such as a particular\nprocess of carcinogenesis in rats), scientists (toxicologists in this\ncase) then compare key stages (particularly downstream stages) of the\nmodel with the stages in the target, paying particular attention to\npoints in the process where differences are most likely to arise. The\ngreater the similarities of the entities, activities, and organization\nof the mechanisms in both populations, the stronger is the basis for\nextrapolation; the greater the differences, the weaker the basis (but\nsee Howick et al. 2013; see also the sections on extrapolation in the\nentries on\n molecular biology\nand\n experiment in biology).\n",
