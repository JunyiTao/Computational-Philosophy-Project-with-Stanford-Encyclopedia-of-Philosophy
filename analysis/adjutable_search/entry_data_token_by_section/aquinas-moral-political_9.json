    "main_text": "Practical reason\u2019s first principles || Only incipiently moral\n2.7 Only incipiently moral\n\nMany nineteenth- and early twentieth century accounts of Aquinas took\nit that the first principles of practical reason, which he regularly\ncalls first principles of natural law or natural right, are moral\nprinciples picking out kinds of human act as to be done (e.g.\nalms-giving to the poor) or not done (e.g. murder, adultery), in the\nmanner of the Commandments. But though there are a few passages in\nwhich Aquinas himself speaks in that way, they can be read down so as\nto make them consistent with the more strategic passages in which he\nspeaks of such moral principles or norms as \u201cderived\u201d\nconclusions from first principles. (See also 3.3 below.) Even immoral\npeople so blinded by culture or disposition that they do not make\nthese inferences nevertheless can and normally do understand the\nfirst principles of practical reason and are guided by them,\nthough imperfectly, in their deliberations.\n\nAgainst Kant\u2019s assumption that, since the ends toward which one\nwishes to act are subjective because projected, and established in\none\u2019s deliberating and willingness (as Hume proposed), by\none\u2019s subrational desires, practical reason\u2019s function is\nto limit and channel one\u2019s pursuit of those ends, Aquinas\nconsiders that practical reason\u2019s first and fundamental\noperation is not limiting, confining or negative but rather\nfacilitating and positive: finding and constructing intelligible ends\nto be pursued (prosequenda), ends that give intelligent point\nto our behavior.\n\nThe thesis that the first practical principles are only incipiently\nmoral should not be confused with the widespread modern opinion that\npractical reason\u2019s default position is self-interest or\n\u201cprudential\u201d reason, so that there is a puzzle about how\none transits from this to morality. In Aquinas\u2019 classical view,\none\u2019s reason (as distinct from some of one\u2019s customary\nways of thinking) naturally understands the primary or basic goods as\ngood for anyone, and further understands that it is good to\nparticipate in the many forms of friendship which require that one set\naside all merely emotionally motivated self-preference.\n",
