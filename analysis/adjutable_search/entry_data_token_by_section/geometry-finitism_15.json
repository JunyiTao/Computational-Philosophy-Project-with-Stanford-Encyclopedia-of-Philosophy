    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as generators of classical geometry || Can it be an empirical problem?\n3.4 Can it be an empirical problem?\n\nSo far we have explored several theoretical possibilities of a\ndiscrete geometry as a counterpart of classical geometry. Given the\nexamples we discussed in the preceding sections, the relevance for\nphysics seems obvious. Although one might be tempted to believe that\nthe discreteness of space and/or time is a purely theoretical matter,\nnevertheless it is an intriguing question whether the matter could\nalso be of an empirical nature. More concretely, is it imaginable that\nsomehow we could design an experiment such that the outcome is either\nthat space is discrete or that space is continuous? This might sound\nreally far-fetched, but nevertheless the matter has drawn the\nattention of philosophers and a specific experiment has indeed been\nproposed, though at present the circumstances to execute the\nexperiment are unfortunately not feasible.\n\nIt is quite interesting to see that already in 1961 Paul Feyerabend\nsuggested such a possibility. However not much more is said, as\n\n\nthe difficulty of the present situation seems to lie in the fact that\ndiscrete alternatives for the mathematics, which at the present moment\nis being used in physics, are missing. (1961: 160)\n\n\nEqually interesting is the fact that Feyerabend too mentions the\nstandard argument that the lack of a Pythagorean theorem is a genuine\nproblem. His proposal is that\n\n\nwe need only assume that measurements in different directions do not\ncommute; and then perhaps we can retain the theorem as an operator\nequation. (1961: 161)\n\n\nHere too, unfortunately, nothing more is said. Peter Forrest (1995)\nmaintains that such an experiment is possible. The fundamental reason\nis that classical mathematics uses continuous variables whereas strict\nfinitist mathematics uses discrete variables. Thus for differentation\nand integration finite analogs must be found and they will approximate\nthe classical case, but never coincide with it. Hence, there will\nalways be small differences and it cannot be excluded that these could\nbe detectable.\n\nOne such possibility for detection concerns the following curious\nphenomenon. Take the differential equation, \\(df/dx = ax(1 - x)\\). It\nis a straightforward exercise to solve it and one will find a very\nneat continuous solution, whereas if one takes for the discrete case\nthe corresponding difference equation, \\(\\Delta f/\\Delta x = ax(1 -\nx)\\), depending on the value of the parameter \\(a\\), the behaviour of\nthe function \\(f\\) produces chaotic effects, which are absent in the\ncontinuous case. See Van Bendegem (2000) and Welti (1987:\n516\u2013518). The outcome of such an experiment would not be as\nclear-cut as wished for, but to observe chaotic effects means that\nspace is discrete, whereas to observe no chaotic effects means that\neither space is continuous or the hodons are far smaller than we\nimagined. After a long period of silence, there is a new development\nto report. Oppenheim et al. (2023) claim that we should investigate\nanew the possibility that space-time in general relativity theory need\nnot be quantized in order to obtain a unification with quantum (field)\ntheory. Postquantum theory of classical gravity, as they call it,\ntakes continuous space-time as a starting point. A question that\narises is how to devise crucial experiments. Such experiments need not\ninvolve space-time itself in a direct way, but, if a choice can be\nmade, it will at the same time be a choice for a discrete or a\ncontinuous space-time..\n\nIt has been indicated several times in this lemma that different\nscientists with different intentions and aims and with different\nbackgrounds have proposed or propose equally different ideas about\ndiscrete geometry as an alternative for classical geometry. Many\nauthors do not necessarily present more or less complete theories, but\nrather limit themselves to making suggestions and exploring some\nparticular idea. These papers are to be seen as sources of inspiration\nin the search for a full-fledged theory. A few examples are: Hahn\n(1934), Biser (1941), Coish (1959), Ahmavaara (1965a,b), Finkelstein\n(1969) (this is the first of a five paper series with the same title\nin the same journal), Dadi\u0107 & Pisk (1979), Finkelstein &\nRodriguez (1986), Meessen (1989), Buot (1989), to name but a very few.\nFor the period 1925\u20131936, Kragh and Carazza (1994) is an\nexcellent overview showing that many physicists were playing around\nwith finitist ideas.\n",
