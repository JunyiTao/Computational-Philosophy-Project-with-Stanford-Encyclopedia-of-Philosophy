    "main_text": "How Rich is Consciousness?\n6. How Rich is Consciousness?\n\nWe have met with a contrast between views that are relatively\ninclusive, and those that are relatively restrictive in what they\ncount as properly experiential. Specifically: non-separatists\u2019\npositions diverge with respect to what differences in\nintentionality they regard as brought along with differences in the\nphenomenal or subjective character of experience. If we think of\n\u201cphenomenal intentionality\u201d as whatever intentionality\ncomes along with certain varieties of phenomenal consciousness, we can\ndistinguish those views that recognize more phenomenal\nintentionality from those that recognize less. Philosophers\ndisagree then over how richly intentional (and thus, as we might also\nsay, how cognitively rich) phenomenal character is. In this section we\nwill set separatism aside, and focus on how intentionalist\nperspectives differ along this dimension.\n\nWe have noted how distinguishing basic forms of intentionality or\ncontent (such as \u201cconceptual\u201d and\n\u201cnon-conceptual\u201d) may be allied (as in Tye) with a broad\nrestriction on phenomenal intentionality: phenomenal character is\nconfined to a non-conceptual sort of intentionality (or\ncontent or representation) that is found in sensory states\n(where these would encompass, e.g., both visual perception and\nimagery). Similarly, one may draw a general limit to the kind of\nproperties that can be represented in the phenomenal character of\none\u2019s experience. This is illustrated in Prinz\u2019s (2012)\nrepresentationalist theory: he limits phenomenal character to\n\u201cintermediate level\u201d \u201cviewpoint dependent\u201d\nproperties that one may perceive something to have (such as\n\u201c2\u00bd-D\u201d shapes); \u201chigher-level\u201d\nproperties (such as being a chair) are excluded.\n\nHowever, to think of such theories as admitting relatively less\nrichness to phenomenal intentionality could mislead us. An aspect of\nthis: one may limit richness in the manner just suggested, while\nexpanding it in other ways. In the case of vision one indication of\nrichness might lie in how finely discriminatory the\nintentional/representational differences in phenomenal character are:\na richer view would recognize more differences in\ncolors or shapes figure in experience in this way, a sparser\nview fewer. The question here would be roughly: how much can\nyou visually experience of space, of color, in a given amount of time?\nOn such matters, both Tye\u2019s and Prinz\u2019s accounts would\ncome out as rich relative to others\u2014since they would say that a\nhigher level of spatial detail is experienced even in relatively brief\nvisual presentations (such as letter arrays) than would\nothers\u2014like Dennett, who advocates a professedly\n\u201csparse\u201d view of consciousness. Controversies of\nthis sort about richness versus sparseness have recently\nplayed out in complex ways that combine phenomenological\nconsiderations with detailed interpretation of experimental work on\nvision (concerned, e.g, with \u201cchange blindness\u201d,\n\u201cinattentional blindness\u201d, \u201cmasking\u201d, and\n\u201cSperling paradigm\u201d cuing effects). (See, for example,\nBlock 2012 for discussion of such issues, in support of a relatively\nrich view.) And such questions about the \u201cfineness of\ngrain\u201d or \u201cdetail\u201d in visual experience have often\nbeen discussed in connection with questions about the conflict or\nharmony between what first-person reflective judgment\n(\u201cintrospection\u201d) seems to tell us about experience and\nwhat experimental data reveal (see No\u00eb 2002 on the \u201cgrand\nillusion hypothesis\u201d).\n\nAt issue in these latter sort of \u201crichness\u201d controversies\nis, roughly speaking, the amount of \u201crichness at a\nlevel\u201d\u2014e.g., how finely differentiated is spatial\nexperience of an array of objects? These contrast with the earlier\nindicated issues concerning what we might call \u201crichness of\nlevels\u201d in experience. For example, does subjective\nexperience not only distinguish (\u201cat a level\u201d) differences\nin (e.g.) how far a surface bulges out, but differences of\nadditional levels\u2014say, whether an object is\nspherical or cubical, and not just these, but whether it is a\nball or a chair? It seems clear one can have a rich view with\nrespect to one sort of issue, while maintaining sparseness at the\nother. If the question is richness \u201cat a level\u201d Dennett\nwould seem to hold a sparse view relative to Prinz. But if we are\nasking about richness \u201cof levels\u201d, the comparison comes\nout differently: Dennett\u2019s view of consciousness, as Prinz\n(disapprovingly) notes, puts no limits on what sort of properties\nmight figure in its content.\n\nAnother complicating factor here has to do with how one situates a\ntaxonomy of views with respect to a distinction between sensory or\nperceptual phenomena on the on hand, and thought or\ncognition, on the other. Susanna Siegel has argued for the view\nthat so-called \u201chigh-level\u201d features, like being a\npine tree, are \u201crepresented in visual experience\u201d.\nTim Bayne (2009) has argued for a position similar to Siegel\u2019s,\npartly by appeal to consideration of the kind of deficits in visual\nrecognition found in associative agnosia. Such views of visual\nconsciousness contrast with Tye\u2019s and Prinz\u2019s. (See Byrne\nand Siegel 2017 for an illustration of this debate. And see Connolly\n2019 for defense of a relatively low-level view, discussed in\nconnection with research on perceptual recognition and learning.) Yet\nother alternatives are possible here\u2014one might maintain\nexperience encompasses a greater richness of levels than do Byrne,\nTye, or Prinz, though without (like Siegel) putting visual experience\nin the business of representing objects to have high-level properties.\nOne might argue for the experiential reality of spatial object\nconstancy, and of visual recognition of kinds, without committing to\nSiegel\u2019s version of representationalism: something might\nsubjectively and irreducibly look recognizable to you as a\npine tree or a glove, for example\u2014but this isn\u2019t\nnecessarily to say that your visual experience (like your thought)\ncorrectly or incorrectly represents it to have a property that would\nbe missing in a genetically different plant, or in a differently\npurposed artifact (Siewert 2013a, 2015, 2019). The issues raised here\nturn partly on what sort of description of experience yields the best\nunderstanding of visual recognition in the light of what is made\nevident by Gestalt phenomena and selective deficits in vision, and\nthey seem to call for careful interpretation of relevant experimental\nwork (see Block 2014).\n\nAnother species of \u201crichness\u201d controversy that arises with\na distinction between thought and sensory states is this. Again, we\nmay distinguish thinking (cognition of the sort involved in\nconceptual, rational understanding) from both perceiving with the\nsenses and forming sensory images. We may thus think of\nthings when we neither perceive them by the senses, nor\nform sensory images of them (by e.g., visualizing), and even\nwhere such images as we may then form (say, such as an utterance in\ninner speech) do not suffice for the thoughts we then have.\nEven if Siegel\u2019s view is in doubt, it may seem at least that\nconceptual thinking in this sense can, in virtue of its subjective\ncharacter, be about pines (and not merely \u201cpine-ish\u201d\nthings), and about gloves (and not merely \u201cglove-ish\u201d\nthings). That is, one might affirm a phenomenal-intentional richness\nof levels, not by having sensory experience attribute to objects a\nricher class of properties, but by holding that thinking and\nunderstanding possess phenomenal character that yields richer\ncognitive differences than can be delivered by the sort of sensory\nexperience one can have without full-blown conceptual abilities.\n\nIs there something it\u2019s like for us to think that is not\nexhausted by what it\u2019s like for us to have merely sensory\nstates? Here we come upon the issue that has lately emerged under the\nheading \u201ccognitive phenomenology\u201d. Or rather, we come upon\none way of articulating an aspect of issues so labeled. Much of the\nchallenge of this debate lies in properly framing it; different\nparties have done so in significantly different ways. As a start, and\nvery roughly, we might distinguish views that include in\nphenomenal character the sorts of differences in thinking and\nunderstanding that go beyond the \u201cpurely sensory\u201d and\nthose that restrict phenomenal character in a way that\nexcludes these. The latter philosophers hold that phenomenal\ncharacter is exhausted by or reducible to non-cognitive, purely\nsensory differences, while the former say there is more to it than\nthis\u2014the \u201csomething more\u201d found in thought. The\narticles in Bayne and Montague 2011 provide an array of perspectives\non this issue. Chudnoff 2015 furnishes a detailed overview and\nassessment of the debate.\n\nA prominent defender of an inclusive view\u2014David Pitt\u2014takes\nthe question to concern, crucially, whether thought has its own\n\u201cproprietary and distinctive\u201d phenomenal character (Pitt\n2004). His affirmative answer to this has been glossed by saying there\nis a special sort of \u201cnon-sensory phenomenology\u201d. (See\nalso Michelle Montague\u2019s 2016 formulation.) This has been taken to\nimply the phenomenal character of thought can be separated from that\nof sensory states in certain ways critics have found highly dubious.\nTye and Wright 2011, for instance, assume that if there is indeed\n\u201ccognitive phenomenology\u201d, then there is an aspect to the\nphenomenal character of verbally expressed thought that would remain\nthe same if all imagery and sense perception (including the verbal\nimagery involved in its expression) were removed from it\u2014a\nphenomenological constant that would inevitably be shared by\nmonolingual speakers of different languages expressing their thoughts\nintertranslatably. And they find this consequence quite incredible.\nPrinz 2011 assumes that if inclusive (what he calls\n\u201cexpansionist\u201d) views were right, we should be able to\nengage in experiential thought independently of all sensory activity,\nmuch as we can enjoy experience in one sensory modality in the absence\nof another (as when we see without hearing). But, he says, we do not.\nRelated criticisms appear in Pautz 2013 and 2021.\n\nSome proponents of inclusivity do embrace a quite radical in-principle\nseparability of thought and sensory experience. Kriegel 2015, for\nexample, invites us to consider the cognitive experience of a subject\nengaged in \u201cpure\u201d mathematical reasoning, unaccompanied by\nimagery or sensed symbolic expression of any sort. However, neither\nthis sort of radical separability, nor the kinds criticized in Pautz,\nPrinz, and Tye, are essential to all inclusive views. For Siewert\n1998, 2011 the issue does not turn on whether linguistic expression or\nsensory vehicles are merely incidental to our conscious thinking, or\non whether there\u2019s a cognitive component to its subjective\ncharacter that would remain identifiably the same, were everything\nsensory is stripped away from it. Rather, the question is whether the\nsubjective character of your experience when you read, speak, or\nlisten to others, would remain unchanged if all understanding\nwere stripped away, or if differences in how you understood the words\nwere radically switched around. Chudnoff 2015 also takes pains to\nseparate the question of cognitive phenomenology from the claims\ncritics have associated with it.\n\nClearly then, no small part of justifying a position on this aspect of\nthe \u201ccognitive richness of levels\u201d issue consists in\narguing for a certain way of framing the issues. Additionally, and in\nconnection with this, arguments proceed by asking us to consider what\nsort of differences (or contrasts) in phenomenal character we\nrecognize in reflection. For instance: is there a difference in what\nit\u2019s like for you to take an ambiguous phrase in one sense, and\nthen another? Is there such an experiential difference between reading\nor hearing something without following it, and then again,\nwith understanding? Are we justified in thinking such\ndifferences as we find always coincide with merely sensory\ndifferences? Would what it\u2019s like for us when we understand\nsomething differently be just the same if understanding were absent?\nArguments here also focus on the idea that differences in what\nit\u2019s like for one to have experience make for differences in\nself-knowledge for which we cannot adequately account, if we assume\nthe relevant phenomenal differences to be independent of conceptual\nthought and understanding. (For a sampling of arguments appealing in a\nvariety of ways to experiential contrasts, see Chudnoff 2015, Horgan\nand Tienson 2002, Pitt 2004, Siewert 1998, 2011, and Strawson 1994.\nFor an interpretation and critique of \u201ccontrast arguments\u201d, see\nKoksvik 2015. For representative arguments that all relevant contrasts\nare exhausted by purely sensory differences, see Tye and Wright 2011;\nPrinz 2011, 2013; and Robinson 2011. For an argument against such\nsensory \u201creductions\u201d appealing to the phenomenon of aphantasia, see\nLennon, forthcoming. For arguments that appeal, in different ways, to\nconnections between experiential and epistemic differences, see Pitt\n2004 and Siewert 2011. For discussion of Pitt\u2019s epistemic\nargument, see Chudnoff 2015. For an overview of the issues and\nstrategies of argument, see Smithies 2013a and 2013b.)\n\nAnother aspect to these issues concerns what conception of thought\ncontent one employs, and how this is introduced. Some ways of defining\nthe issues invoke at the very outset a notion of content (or of\nrepresentation). Pitt sees the basic question as whether the\nphenomenology of thought \u201cindividuates its content\u201d. One\nmay, however, also approach the issue initially by asking about the\nrelation of phenomenal differences to differences in how we understand\nour words, or how we think of what we are thinking about\u2014where\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d and \u201cthinking\u201d are taken to\nimply the possession of relevant conceptual abilities. Only after\nthis, does one pose questions about content, on consideration of\nvarious ways of construing that notion (see Siewert 2011 and Chudnoff\n2015). But when questions about the subjective experience of thinking\ndo join with questions about differences in what is\nthought\u2014differences in content\u2014assessment of the\nexternalist arguments about content (mentioned in Section 3) again\nbecome relevant. Somewhat as in the case of sense perception, thorny\nquestions arise about how to interpret envisaged scenarios in which\nthe subjective character of experience apparently remains\nconstant, while certain facts about one\u2019s\nenvironment are varied in imagination (facts such\nas: which of a pair of \u201ctwin\u201d objects is found there, what\ntype of hidden microstructure its natural kinds have, what linguistic\npractices are followed locally). Should we accept that subjective\ncharacter would be invariant across scenarios described in terms of\nsuch variations? If we do, should we take this, together with an\ninclusive attitude, to indicate that some differences in content\nare, and some are not, set with phenomenal\ncharacter? Or should we instead adopt an unqualified externalism that\nconcludes no sort of thought content supervenes on subjective\nexperience? Or, on the contrary, should we regard no fully\nextra-phenomenal differences as constituting genuine differences in\nwhat is thought? To thoroughly address questions about the phenomenal\ncharacter of thought and understanding, one needs to examine various\nnotions of thought content, and what theoretical role they are\nsupposed to serve.\n\nFurther issues that seem to call for treatment in connection with the\nphenomenal character of thought include the following. How should we\nalign a view of this with an understanding of what concepts\nare (and what it is to possess them)? (See, e.g., Peter Forrest\u2019s 2017\nargument that the notion that phenomenal character \u201cdetermines thought\ncontent\u201d aligns poorly with the best theories of concepts, given\ncertain assumptioins about the relation between concepts and\ncontents.) In this connection too we may ask\u2014how, if at all,\nsubjects\u2019 concepts could vary, even if the totality of\nfacts (including dispositional facts) regarding the subjective\ncharacter of their experience is held constant? How should a sense of\nagency (and thought \u201cauthorship\u201d), and\ndifferences among mental actions (e.g., judging, doubting, merely\nconsidering) figure in our understanding of the experience of\nthinking? And how is that experience related to the idea of a\n\u201cfringe of consciousness\u201d?\n\nFinally, we may note that this section\u2019s issues raise important\nmethodological questions for the philosophy of consciousness\nespecially acutely. What role should reflection on one\u2019s own\nexperience play in argument? And what role should interpretation\nof recent intellectual history have here? Regarding the first\nquestion: it has been suggested that if this sort of\nreflection\u2014\u201cintrospection\u201d\u2014did have a\nlegitimate role to play, it should have easily resolved questions of\ncognitive phenomenology\u2014as it evidently has not (Schwitzgebel\n2011, Spener 2011). Against this, it has been argued that reflection\non experience has indeed a crucial place here, but its value depends\non how well one has framed the questions one puts to it and how good\nare the assumptions that guide one\u2019s\nreflection\u2014controversial matters of philosophical quality we\nhave no right to expect to be easily assessed (Siewert 2011).\nRegarding the place of historical understanding: one may wonder why\n(as noted earlier) separatist and restrictive conceptions of\nconsciousness\u2014of the sorts that now make inclusive views\ncontroversial\u2014are so little in evidence in phenomenology, or\neven in early twentieth century analytic philosophy or psychology. How\nand why did the framework in which philosophers think about\nconsciousness shift? What can this tell us about the dialectical\nsituation in which we currently find ourselves?
