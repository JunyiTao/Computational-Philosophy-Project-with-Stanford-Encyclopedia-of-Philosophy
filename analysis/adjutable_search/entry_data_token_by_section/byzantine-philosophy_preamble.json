    "main_text": "\n\n\nFor the purposes of this article, Byzantine philosophy is the study\nand teaching of traditional subjects of philosophy in the Greek\nlanguage between c. 730 and 1453. The second half of this delineation\nconstrues the attribute \u201cByzantine\u201d rather narrowly, in\nthat it excludes the whole period between c. 330 and c. 730, which is\ncommonly referred to by historians as \u201cEarly Byzantine\u201d\n(and also leaves out of account philosophical activity in the minority\nlanguages of the Byzantine Empire). The main reason for focusing on\nthe philosophical works after c. 730 is that Early Byzantine\nphilosophy is usually covered in accounts of late Ancient Philosophy,\nof which it is a seamless continuation. The first half of the\ndelineation should not be taken to imply any particular view regarding\nthe \u201ctrue face of Byzantine philosophy\u201d, although we do\nthink that it is by being related in certain ways to the philosophical\ntradition that a written work is eligible to be classed as\nphilosophical. This tradition was formed in antiquity. Hence, the\nworks discussed here will typically be concerned with questions\ninherited from ancient philosophy.\n\n\nWe have tried to impose a provisional borderline between Byzantine\nphilosophy and other areas which are so closely related to Byzantine\nphilosophy as to be sometimes inseparable from it. Most importantly,\nwe have tried to demarcate our subject matter from that of Byzantine\ntheology, not because we believe that an account in which the\nreligious dimension is largely ignored will be sufficient to grasp\nByzantine intellectual history in its organic entirety, but because we\nthink that a clearer conception of the \u201cpurely\u201d\nphilosophical part of Byzantine intellectual history is both desirable\nin itself and necessary for the understanding of the whole. This may\nseem to lead us straight towards an episodic account, concentrating on\na few solitary thinkers on the fringe of Byzantine intellectual\nhistory. In order to avoid this we have chosen not to place very heavy\ndemands on the originality of the works to be included. Our main\nconcern has been to describe the typical features of the philosophical\ntradition in Byzantium, rather than to highlight the rare instances\nwhen innovative views and arguments were put forward. For further discussion of the methodology of the history of Byzantine philosophy, see Kapriev (2006), Trizio (2007), Golitsis (2011), and Gutas and Siniossoglou (2017).\n\n\nThe main part of the article is divided into two sections. Section\n1 attempts to situate Byzantine philosophy in the general context of\nByzantine culture and education, and to give a brief survey of the more\nimportant philosophical authors and their works. For Section 2, we have\nmade a selection of two especially significant topics in the fields of\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics. This arrangement allows us to look\na bit more closely at the form and content of some Byzantine\nphilosophical views and arguments without giving up the ambition to be\nreasonably historically comprehensive.\n",
