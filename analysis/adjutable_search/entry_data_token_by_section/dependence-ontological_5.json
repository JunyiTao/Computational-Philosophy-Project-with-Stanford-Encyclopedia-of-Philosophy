    "main_text": "Essential Dependence and Identity-Dependence || Why Essential Dependence?\n4.1 Why Essential Dependence?\n\nUntil quite recently, it was common to think that ontological\ndependence can be fully characterized in modal-existential terms, as\nwe have seen above. One obvious reason for this is that if one adopts\nthe usual \u201cmodalist\u201d analysis of essence,\nessential dependence will collapse into a form of modal-existential\ndependence (one classic defense of the \u201cmodalist\u201d analysis\nis Marcus 1967). But it seems clear already starting from Aristotle\nthat there is an alternative way to formulate ontological dependence\nif essence is not analyzed in modal terms (as Fine 1994a and\nespecially those working in the \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d\ntradition would have it). However, this is not to suggest that\nAristotle did not rely on the modal-existential notion of ontological\ndependence. Rather, there are reasons to think that Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of dependence encompasses both the\nmodal-existential notion and the essentialist notion to be described\nbelow (for historical details and further discussion, see Corkum 2008,\nKoslicki 2013, and Peramatzis 2011).\n\nOne motivation for developing a non-modal conception of\nontological dependence is that the modal-existential analysis appears\nto be too coarse-grained for some cases. We have already discussed\nsome of these cases, but the most well-known examples have been made\nfamous by Fine (e.g., 1994b). Consider, for instance, what the\nmodal-existential account entails in the case of necessary existents.\nTake Socrates and the number 2, for example. Given that numbers\nnecessarily exist, it is necessarily the case that 2 exists if\nSocrates does. But presumably we do not want to say that Socrates\ndepends upon the number 2, or indeed on most necessary existents that\nyou might put in the place of 2. So the modal-existential account\nmakes everything depend upon every necessary existent, which seems\nlike the wrong result.\n\nAdmittedly, those who defend a modal-existential analysis of\nontological dependence could insist that it applies only to\ncontingent objects (cf. Simons 1987: 295). Simons makes this\ntype of qualification by focusing on concrete entities, hence\nexcluding necessary existents by definition; he also excludes\nself-dependence. Simons calls the resulting notion of dependence\nweak rigid dependence, but a stronger notion, strong\nrigid dependence (Simons 1987: 303) is also defined\u2014the\nlatter is a special case of the former. One example of weak rigid\ndependence as defined by Simons would be a particular water molecule\ndepending for its existence on a particular oxygen atom. In the case\nof strong rigid dependence, the dependent object cannot be a proper\npart of the object it depends upon. So object x is strongly\nrigidly dependent on object y if x depends for its\nexistence on y and y is not a proper part of x.\nOne example of strong rigid dependence defined thus would be a trope\n(or mode) depending for its existence on a substance. In addition to\nthese rigid notions, Simons defines corresponding notions of (weak and\nstrong) generic dependence.\n\nWhile it is possible to avoid some of the challenges raised for the\nmodal-existential account with these qualifications, they do\nnevertheless call for an alternative, more fine-grained account of\nontological dependence that could also be applied to necessary\nexistents. As last resort, a proponent of the modal-existential\naccount who does not wish to buy into essentialist ontology could\nsimply bite the bullet and insist that every contingent entity\ndoes rigidly depend for its existence on necessary existents.\nOne reason to do so would be the ability to get by with a sparser\nbattery of formal ontological tools\u2014a consideration motivated by\nparsimony.\n\nThe modal-existential analysis of ontological dependence can thus be\ndeveloped further, and it can perhaps overcome some of the problems\nthat were pointed out earlier. But there are areas where a more\nfine-grained notion would seem to be required and there is also a\nhistorical precedent (e.g., in Aristotle) for such a notion. It should\nbe noted though that much of the contemporary literature in defense of\na non-modal, fine-grained analysis (such as Fine 1994b and Koslicki\n2012), operates in a \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d framework which\ntypically assumes some \u201cnon-modalist\u201d version of\nessentialism. Accordingly, there is an obvious rift between the\nmodal-existential analysis and the essentialist analysis\u2014one\nthat we cannot fully bridge here. In any case, it is good to keep in\nmind that the notion of ontological dependence itself, when used as a\ntool to formulate the commitments of a specific theory, does not\nimmediately force one to make a commitment in this regard, even though\nsome of its applications may entail such a commitment.\n",
