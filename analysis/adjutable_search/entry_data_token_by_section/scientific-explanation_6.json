    "main_text": "The SR Model || The Basic Idea\n3.1 The Basic Idea\n\nMuch of the subsequent literature on explanation has been motivated by\nattempts to capture the features of causal or explanatory relevance\nthat appear to be left out of examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n typically within the empiricist constraints described above. Wesley\nSalmon\u2019s statistical relevance (or SR) model (Salmon\n1971a) is a very influential attempt to capture these features in\nterms of the notion of statistical relevance or conditional dependence\nrelationships. Given some class or population \\(A\\), an attribute\n\\(C\\) will be statistically relevant to another attribute\n\\(B\\) if and only if \\(P(B\\pmid A.C) \\ne P(B\\pmid A)\\)\u2014that is,\nif and only if the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)\nis different from the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) alone.\nThe intuition underlying the SR model is that statistically\nrelevant properties (or information about statistically relevant\nrelationships) are explanatory and statistically irrelevant properties\nare not. In other words, the notion of a property making a difference\nfor an explanandum is unpacked in terms of statistical relevance\nrelationships.\n\nAs an illustration, suppose that in the birth control pills example\n (5)\n the original population T includes both sexes. Then\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{Pregnancy} \\pmid T.&\\text{Male.Takes birth control pills})\\\\\n& {} = P(\\text{Pregnancy} \\pmid T.\\text{Male})\\\\\n& {} = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nwhile \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{Pregnancy} \\pmid T.&\\text{Female.Takes birth control pills})\\\\\n&{} \\ne P(\\text{Pregnancy} \\pmid T.\\text{Female})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nassuming that not all women in the population take birth control\npills. In other words, if you are a male in this population, taking\nbirth control pills is statistically irrelevant to whether you become\npregnant, while if you are a female it is relevant. Thus taking birth\ncontrol pills is explanatorily irrelevant to pregnancy among males but\nnot among females.\n\nTo characterize the SR model more precisely we need the\nnotion of a homogenous partition. A homogenous partition of\n\\(A\\) is a set of subclasses or cells \\(C_i\\) of \\(A\\) that are\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive, where \\(P(B\\pmid A.C_i) \\ne\nP(B\\pmid A.C_j)\\) for all \\(C_i \\ne C_j\\) and where no further\nstatistically relevant partition of any of the cells \\(A\\), \\(C_i\\)\ncan be made with respect to \\(B\\)\u2014that is, there are no\nadditional attributes \\(D_k\\) in \\(A\\) such that  \n\n\\[P(B\\pmid A.C_i) \\ne P(B\\pmid A.C_i.D_k).\\]\n\n\nOn the SR model, an explanation of why some member x\nof the class characterized by attribute \\(A\\) has attribute \\(B\\)\nconsists of the following information:\n\nThe prior probability of \\(B\\) within \\(A\\): \\(P(B\\pmid A) =\np\\).\n A homogeneous partition of A with respect to B,\n(\\(A.C_1,\\ldots ,A.C_n)\\), together with the probability of B\nwithin each cell of the partition: \\(P(B\\pmid A.C_i) = p_i\\) and\n The cell of the partition to which x belongs.\n\n\nTo employ one of Salmon\u2019s examples, suppose we want to construct\nan SR explanation of why x who has a strep infection =\nS, recovers quickly = Q. Let \\(T(-T)\\) according to\nwhether x is (is not) treated with penicillin, and \\(R(-R)\\) =\naccording to whether x has a penicillin-resistant strain.\nAssume for the sake of argument that no other factors are relevant to\nquick recovery. There are four possible combinations of these\nproperties: \\(T.R,\\) \\(-T.R,\\) \\(T.{-R},\\) \\({-T}.{-R},\\) but let us\nassume that \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP(Q\\pmid S.T.R) & = P(Q\\pmid S.{-T}.R)\\\\\n& = P(Q\\pmid S.{-T}.{-R})\\\\\n& \\ne P(Q\\pmid S.{T}.{-R})\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThat is, the probability of quick recovery, given that one has strep,\nis the same for those who have the resistant strain regardless of\nwhether or not they are treated and also the same for those who have\nnot been treated. By contrast, the probability of recovery is\ndifferent (presumably greater) among those with strep who have been\ntreated and do not have the resistant strain.\n\nIn this case \n\n\\[[S.(T.R \\lor {-T}.R \\lor {-R}.{-T})], [S.T.{-R}]\\]\n\n\nis a homogenous partition of S with respect to Q. The\nSR explanation of x\u2019s recovery will consist of a\nstatement of the probability of quick recovery among all those with\nstrep ((i) above), a statement of the probability of recovery in each\nof the two cells of the above partition ((ii) above), and the cell to\nwhich x belongs, which is \\(S.T.R\\) ((iii) above). Intuitively,\nthe idea is that this information tells us about the relevance of each\nof the possible combinations of the properties T and R\nto quick recovery among those with strep and is explanatory for just\nthis reason.\n",
