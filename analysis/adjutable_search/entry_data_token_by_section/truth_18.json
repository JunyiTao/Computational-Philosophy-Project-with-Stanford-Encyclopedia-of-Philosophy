    "main_text": "Realism and anti-realism || Truth pluralism\n4.4 Truth pluralism\n\nAnother view that has grown out of the literature on realism and\nanti-realism, and has become increasingly important in the current\nliterature, is that of pluralism about truth. This view, developed in\nwork of Lynch (e.g. 2001b; 2009) and Wright (e.g. 1992; 1999),\nproposes that there are multiple ways for truth bearers to be true.\nWright, in particular, suggests that in certain domains of discourse\nwhat we say is true in virtue of a correspondence-like relation, while\nin others it is its true in virtue of a kind of assertibility relation\nthat is closer in spirit to the anti-realist views we have just\ndiscussed.\n\nSuch a proposal might suggest there are multiple concepts of truth, or\nthat the term \u2018true\u2019 is itself ambiguous. However, whether\nor not a pluralist view is committed to such claims has been disputed.\nIn particular, Lynch (2001b; 2009) develops a version of pluralism\nwhich takes truth to be a functional role concept. The functional role\nof truth is characterized by a range of principles that articulate\nsuch features of truth as its objectivity, its role in inquiry, and\nrelated ideas we have encountered in considering various theories of\ntruth. (A related point about platitudes governing the concept of\ntruth is made by Wright (1992).) But according to Lynch, these display\nthe functional role of truth. Furthermore, Lynch claims that on\nanalogy with analytic functionalism, these principles can be seen as\nderiving from our pre-theoretic or \u2018folk\u2019 ideas about\ntruth.\n\nLike all functional role concepts, truth must be realized, and\naccording to Lynch it may be realized in different ways in different\nsettings. Such multiple realizability has been one of the hallmarks of\nfunctional role concepts discussed in the philosophy of mind. For\ninstance, Lynch suggests that for ordinary claims about material\nobjects, truth might be realized by a correspondence property (which\nhe links to representational views), while for moral claims truth\nmight be manifest by an assertibility property along more anti-realist\nlines.\n\nFor more on pluralism about truth, see Pedersen and Lynch (2018) and\nthe entry on\n pluralist theories of truth.\n",
