    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || Four-Dimensionalism\n2.8 Four-Dimensionalism \n\n\nLet us turn briefly now to a very general position, a possible \nversion of reductionism according to which identity nevertheless \nstill matters. This view is typically defended by advocates of \nfour-dimensionalism, according to which objects have both \nspatial and temporal parts (see, e.g., Lewis 1971, 1976; \nNoonan 1989; Sider 2001a). This view allows one to say that, in the \nfission case, both post-fission people existed all along, completely \ncoinciding spatially pre-fission (so that each shared that temporal \nstretch of his life with the other). In other words, they might be \nlike two distinct roads that coincide for a while before separating \noff in different directions. Thus, if both post-fission person-stages\nare stages of the same person as the pre-fission stages (but there \nare indeed two distinct persons all along), then one can maintain the\nthesis that the identity relation is what matters, for now identity \nis also preserved through fission (whereas in Parfit's version while \nwhat matters is preserved through fission, identity is not).\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean identity is really what matters. \nPerhaps instead the identity relation merely always \naccompanies, but is not constitutive of, what matters. \nIndeed, this point may be pressed on the four-dimensionalist. Why, \nafter all, would it be identity that matters in my relation \nto some future person-stage? Suppose we regularly lived to be 1000 \nyears old. On the four-dimensionalist account, I now would be unified\nwith \u2013 I would be part of the same spacetime worm as \u2013 my\n900-year-old self. But it is extraordinarily difficult, if not \npsychologically impossible, for me to project myself into his shoes, \nfor I expect him to be radically different, psychologically, from me.\nThere would be between us, then, virtually nothing of what \nactually matters in ordinary survival, despite the obtaining of \nidentity. Of course, one might maintain instead that it is some \nstrong degree of psychological connectedness that provides the unity \nrelation between various temporal stages, but then it seems explicit \nthat the relation preserving what matters is just connectedness, not \nidentity per se. There is much more to say about this view, of \ncourse (see, e.g., Belzer 2005), and we will return to it later.\n",
