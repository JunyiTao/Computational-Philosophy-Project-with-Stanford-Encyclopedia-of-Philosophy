    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || The Role of Symmetries\n5.4 The Role of Symmetries\n\n\nSymmetries play a central role in QFT. In order to characterize a\nspecial symmetry one has to specify transformations T and features\nthat remain unchanged during these transformations: invariants I.\nSymmetries are thus pairs \\(\\{\\)T, I\\(\\}\\). The basic idea is that the\ntransformations change elements of the mathematical description (the\nLagrangians for instance) whereas the empirical content of the theory\nis unchanged. There are space-time transformations and so-called\ninternal transformations. Whereas space-time symmetries are universal,\ni.\u00a0e., they are valid for all interactions, internal symmetries\ncharacterize special sorts of interaction (electromagnetic, weak or\nstrong interaction). Symmetry transformations define properties of\nparticles/quantum fields that are conserved if the symmetry is not\nbroken. The invariance of a system defines a conservation law, e.g.,\nif a system is invariant under translations the linear momentum is\nconserved, if it is invariant under rotation the angular momentum is\nconserved. Inner transformations, such as gauge transformations, are\nconnected with more abstract properties.\n\n\nSymmetries are not only defined for Lagrangians but they can also be\nfound in empirical data and phenomenological descriptions. Symmetries\ncan thus bridge the gap between descriptions which are close to\nempirical results (\u2018phenomenology\u2019) and the more abstract\ngeneral theory which is a most important reason for their heuristic\nforce. If a conservation law is found one has some knowledge about the\nsystem even if details of the dynamics are unknown. The analysis of\nmany high energy collision experiments led to the assumption of\nspecial conservation laws for abstract properties like baryon number\nor strangeness. Evaluating experiments in this way allowed for a\nclassification of particles. This phenomenological classification was\ngood enough to predict new particles which could be found in the\nexperiments. Free places in the classification could be filled even if\nthe dynamics of the theory (for example the Lagrangian of strong\ninteraction) was yet unknown. As the history of QFT for strong\ninteraction shows, symmetries found in the phenomenological\ndescription often lead to valuable constraints for the construction of the\ndynamical equations. Arguments from group theory played a decisive role\nin the unification of fundamental interactions. In addition,\nsymmetries bring about substantial technical advantages. For example,\nby using gauge transformations one can bring the Lagrangian into a\nform which makes it easy to prove the renormalizability of the theory.\nSee also the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking.\n\nIn many cases symmetries are not only heuristically useful but supply\nsome sort of \u2018justification\u2019 by being used in the\nbeginning of a chain of explanation. To a remarkable degree the\npresent theories of elementary particle interactions can be understood\nby deduction from general principles. Under these principles symmetry\nrequirements play a crucial role in order to determine the\nLagrangian. For example, the only Lorentz invariant and gauge\ninvariant renormalizable Lagrangian for photons and electrons is\nprecisely the original Dirac Lagrangian. In this way symmetry\narguments acquire an explanatory power and help to minimize the\nunexplained basic assumptions of a theory. Heisenberg concludes that\nin order \u201cto find the way to a real understanding of the\nspectrum of particles it will therefore be necessary to look for the\nfundamental symmetries and not for the fundamental particles.\u201d\n(Blum et al. 1995: 507).\n\nSince symmetry operations change the perspective of an observer but\nnot the physics an analysis of the relevant symmetry group can yield\nvery general information about those entities which are unchanged by\ntransformations. Such an invariance under a symmetry group is a\nnecessary (but not sufficient) requirement for something to belong to\nthe ontology of the considered physical theory. Hermann Weyl\npropagated the idea that objectivity is associated with invariance\n(see, e.g., his authoritative work Weyl 1952: 132). Auyang (1995)\nstresses the connection between properties of physically relevant\nsymmetry groups and ontological questions. Kosso argues that\nsymmetries help to separate objective facts from the conventions of\ndescriptions; see his article in Brading & Castellani (2003), an\nanthology containing numerous further philosophical studies about\nsymmetries in physics.\n\nSymmetries are typical examples of structures that show more\ncontinuity in scientific change than assumptions about objects. For\nthat reason structural realists consider structures as \u201cthe best\ncandidate for what is \u2018true\u2019 about a physical\ntheory\u201d (Redhead 1999: 34). Physical objects such as electrons\nare then taken to be similar to fiction that should not be taken\nseriously, in the end. In the epistemic variant of structural realism\nstructure is all we know about nature whereas the objects which are\nrelated by structures might exist but they are not accessible to\nus. For the extreme ontic structural realist there is nothing but\nstructures in the world (Ladyman 1998).\n",
