    "main_text": "A place in the universe at large\n9. A place in the universe at large\n\nReligion gives meaning to human lives by assigning them a certain\ndefinite place within a grander scheme or narrative. It gives its\nadherents a sense of their part in a coherent universe. It tells us\nthat the universe is not a random conjunction of brute facts, but a\nwhole in which we have our proper location. The pantheist may regard\nthe cosmos as divine for very similar reasons. To think of oneself as\npart of a vast interconnected scheme may give one a sense of being\n\u2018at home in the universe.\u2019 Here ecological thinking may\ncome to the fore; like the individual creatures in a complex\necosystem, small but vital contributors to a larger whole, we too may\nbe thought to have our place in the connected whole that is\nNature.\n",
