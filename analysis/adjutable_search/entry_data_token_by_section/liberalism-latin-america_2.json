    "main_text": "Early Hispanic American Liberalism\n3. Early Hispanic American Liberalism\n\nThe liberal discourse received from the French Revolution via the\nCadiz constitution provided the language in which political actors\ndemanded emancipation from colonial rule in the early nineteenth\ncentury. This is why liberalism, though a diffuse ideology with no\nclear contours, commanded the assent of many who favored the cause of\nindependence. The discourse of liberation appealed to the notion of\npopular sovereignty in order to justify emancipation from colonial\nrule (Palti 2007: ch. 2). Representation and legal equality were\nheartfelt demands in a region that had had little if no experience in\npolitical representation while a colony, except for the brief interval\nwhen the Cadiz constitution was in force from 1812 through 1814 (Palti\n2007: ch. 4). The natural rights to freedom of thought and of the\npress were considered fundamental after centuries of tight control by\nthe Catholic inquisition, which had curtailed the free circulation of\nideas. A republican form of government with a division of powers was\nconsidered an antidote against one-person despotic rule and a clear\nsign of emancipation from monarchical absolutism. Some of those who\nwere later considered \u201cconservatives\u201d, such as Lucas\nAlam\u00e1n in Mexico, or \u201crepublicans\u201d, such as\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in Venezuela, shared in this early liberal\nconsensus. Both of them affirmed, at least initially, the core ideas\nof popular sovereignty, some natural rights, and a republican form of\ngovernment with a division of powers. Conservative constitutions, such\nas the Chilean one from 1833, affirmed these core ideas as well.\nLiberal ideas thus provided a shared perspective in relation to which\nthe various political positions that were to develop later defined\nthemselves.\n\nThe philosophical sources of this early liberalism are quite diverse\nsince public intellectuals referred to all sorts of authorities that\ncould support their own positions. Though the list is long, the most\nwidely referred to authors were Rousseau, Montesquieu, Constant, and\nBentham (Safford 1987: 68). From Montesquieu they took the defense of\na division of powers and the critique of despotism; from Rousseau the\nidea of popular sovereignty, the social contract, and the natural\nequality of men; from Constant the critique of popular sovereignty and\nthe defense of a limited government; from Bentham the rationalistic\napproach to legislation. It should be noted, however, that the\ninfluence of these authorities was not limited to those who\nconsistently subscribed to liberal views. Such an influence also\nextended across a political spectrum that acquired more definite\ncontours in later decades. The echoes of Rousseau are apparent among\nthose who advocated an egalitarian strand of liberalism that demanded\nequal political rights for all males, as in the 1814 Apatzing\u00e1n\nConstitution in Mexico, which was never in force. This constitution\nmentions the need for a virtuous citizenry, who, when in disagreement\nwith specific laws, must submit to them as a \u201csacrifice of\nparticular intelligence to the general will\u201d. But Rousseau was\nalso highly influential among those who defended clearly authoritarian\nforms of governance, such as Bol\u00edvar, who established a\nlifetime executive in the 1826 Bolivian Constitution. The same holds\nfor Constant, who was an authority for liberal intellectuals, such as\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora in Mexico, but also for some of\nthose who designed \u201cconservative\u201d constitutions, such as\nthe Mexican constitution of 1836. Constant\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cmoderating power\u201d was also picked up by the Brazilian\nmonarchy. This indicates that intellectuals often drew from the same\nphilosophical sources in order to develop political positions that\nwere, in fact, quite different from each other.\n\nIt is a matter of debate among scholars whether the notion of early\nHispanic American liberalism is only a retrospective reconstruction or\nwhether it is apt to refer to the initial usage of some liberal ideas\nfor political and legal purposes as a sort of\n\u201cliberalism\u201d. As mentioned, at this early state in the\nfirst half of the nineteenth century there were no political groups\nthat self-identified as \u201cliberal\u201d. The political\nusage of the term was not yet well established in the region. The term\n\u201cliberal\u201d still carried with it its original moral meaning\nassociated with noble qualities of generosity and magnanimity, which,\nin the Hispanic-Portuguese Catholic tradition, were virtues that the\nmonarch had to have (Fern\u00e1ndez Sebasti\u00e1n 2009:\n703\u20134). In this moral sense, \u201cliberal\u201d was opposed\nto tyranny and despotism. From the perspective afforded by this\nwidespread moral usage of the term, it became difficult for Hispanic\nAmericans political actors to identify themselves as\n\u201cliberals\u201d along the lines of Spanish liberalism. Although\nthis may seem paradoxical, the reason is that the liberal Spanish\nCourts came to be seen as \u201cilliberal\u201d since they had\ngrudgingly granted representation rights to as few American deputies\nas possible in the C\u00e1diz constitution. Early Spanish liberalism\nproved not to be incompatible with empire. This led some Hispanic\nAmerican liberals to claim distance from Spanish liberalism despite\nthe fact that the greatest impulse for the spread of liberal ideas in\nLatin America was the Cadiz constitution. According to their own\nself-perception, for instance, Colombian liberals owed nothing to the\nlatter. It was only in the twentieth century that historians have\ndemonstrated the inaccuracy of this self-conception (Mart\u00ednez\nGarnica 2006).\n\nThe moral meaning of the term \u201cliberal\u201d provided a\nperspective from which Hispanic American liberals construed their\nvision of the Spanish monarchy as a paradigm of tyranny and despotism.\nFrom the point of view of liberal ideas, more broadly, they came to\nsee the colonial past as an age of obscurantism, ignorance, and\nbackwardness (Lastarria 1844; Samper 1861; for discussion see Collier\n1967: ch. 5). This negative conception of the Spanish heritage became\na constant feature of the Hispanic American liberal frame of mind. In\nlight of their abhorrence of the colonial past, liberals insisted on\nthe need to construe completely new political institutions and to\ninstill a new political mentality in the population. They were also\nprone to blame the colonial heritage for the great difficulties that\nthey faced in carrying out these purposes. To be sure, this dismissive\nattitude towards the colonial past was not exclusive of liberals since\nit was Bol\u00edvar who famously blamed the ills of Hispanic America\non the colonial past. In his Jamaica Letter he claimed that,\nas a consequence of the colonial heritage, \u201cinstitutions which\nare wholly representative are not suited to our character, customs,\nand present knowledge\u201d (Bol\u00edvar 1815). As some\nconservatives often complained, the repudiation of the Spanish\nheritage prevented liberals from positively valuing aspects of their\nsociety that could help build stable political institutions, such as\nthe unifying force of Catholicism.\n\nIn light of this view of the character and customs inherited from the\ncolonial times, the liberal faith in the capacity of written\nconstitutions to fully transform their societies away from the\ncolonial structures and in the direction of progress went hand in hand\nwith strong a pessimism about the capacity of the majority of the\npeople to live up to the demands of such institutions. Since the\nmajority of the population shared the moral values of the colonial\nsociety and lacked even the basic skills of reading and writing, the\nelite judged them to be backward and ignorant. Most liberals indeed\ndeemed the majority of the people to be unfit for republican\ncitizenship. To be sure, the latter was a widely shared view among\nEuropean liberals who also advocated a limited franchise. Most\nHispanic American liberals endorsed the French doctrinaire\u2019s\nargument that most of the population lacked the needed independence of\njudgment to exercise political rights either because of lack of\ninstruction or because of their subservience to masters, or both,\nwhich was usually the case. A notable exception to this dominant view\nwas the short lived liberal Colombian constitution of 1853 which\ngranted universal male suffrage following the French example after the\n1848 revolution (Bushnell 1993: 108). The same year, a local\nlegislature in Colombia also granted women the right to vote for the\nfirst time in the Americas though the measure was turned down by the\nsupreme court (Bushnell 1993: 163). By contrast with their European\ncounterparts, however, the Hispanic American liberals\u2019\nconviction about the political incapacity of the masses was compounded\nby their belief that the cultural practices inherited from colonial\ntimes were a formidable obstacle for the realization of liberal\npolitical ideas. This perception motivated the disenchanted conclusion\nthat liberal institutions were not suitable for Hispanic American\nsocieties, as Bol\u00edvar put it, and as many other conservatives\nrepeatedly complained against partisans of liberalism.\n",
