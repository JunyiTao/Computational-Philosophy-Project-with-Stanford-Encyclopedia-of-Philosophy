    "main_text": "What is Sport? || Formalism\n2.1 Formalism\n\n\nFormalism conceives of sport as constituted solely by written rules:\na sport is just the set of written rules that govern it. On this view,\nthere is no need to look beyond the written rules to determine whether\nan activity is a sport (e.g. is tennis a sport?), whether an activity\nconstitutes the playing of a certain sport (e.g. are they playing\ntennis or squash?), or whether a particular move is permitted within a\nspecific sport (e.g. is kicking the ball permitted in tennis?).\n\n\nBernard Suits\u2019 The Grasshopper: Games, Life and\nUtopia (1978 [2014]) is regarded as the seminal formalist text\n(Hurka, \n 2005)[1].\n Suits attempts to refute Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that, as a\n\u2018family-resemblance\u2019 concept, \u2018game\u2019 resists\ndefinition. On Wittgenstein\u2019s view (1958, sect. 66\u201367), it\nis not possible to specify individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions for something to constitute a game. Instead,\ngames are endlessly varied, and, while some games may share features\nin common with some other games, there is no single element that is\nshared by all games. Contra Wittgenstein, Suits argues that there are\nfour elements common to every game: goals, means, rules, and a certain\nattitude among the gameplayers.\n\n\nGames are goal-directed activities. Every game has two distinct\ngoals: a \u2018lusory\u2019 goal and a \u2018pre-lusory\u2019 goal.\nThe pre-lusory goal is a specific state of affairs that game players\ntry to bring about: placing the ball in the hole in golf, crossing the\nbar in the high jump, and crossing the line in the marathon. These can\nbe achieved prior to the formation of a game. For example, I can place\na golf ball in a hole even if no game of golf has begun, or I can jump\nover a bar even if no high jump competition is underway. The lusory\ngoal is winning. This can be achieved only in the context of an\norganised game.\n\n\nThe second element of any game is the means. Every game restricts\nthe methods that gameplayers are permitted to use to achieve the\npre-lusory goal. Golfers are not allowed to drop the ball into the hole\nwith their hands; high jumpers are not permitted to vault the bar using\na trampoline, and marathon runners are forbidden from completing the\nrace using a bicycle. The means permitted in games are always\n\u2018inefficient\u2019 for the achievement of the pre-lusory goal.\nFor example, if the goal of boxing is to incapacitate one\u2019s\nopponent for a count of \u201810\u2019, it would be much more\nefficient to attack her with a baseball bat or to shoot her with a gun\nthan having to punch her above the waist wearing gloves. If the\ngoal of soccer is to put the ball into the goal, it would be much more\nefficient to kick, head, and carry the ball rather than only kicking\nand heading it. Means permitted within a game are the\n\u2018lusory\u2019 means, and those prohibited are the\n\u2018illusory\u2019 means.\n\n\nThe third element of a game is the (constitutive) rules. Rules\nprovide a complete account of what means are permitted and not\npermitted within the game. They establish what means can be employed to\nachieve the pre-lusory goal of the game. These limitations on the\npermitted means make the game possible, for they erect (unnecessary)\nobstacles that participants attempt to overcome in the game. For\ninstance, boxing rules disallow the use of weapons, such as knives or\nfirearms. This ensures that the sport is a punching contest. The laws\nof soccer permit the use of any body part other than the arms so that\nthe ball is played predominantly with the feet. In addition to\nconstitutive rules, Suits argues, there are rules of skill, which\nestablish how to play the game well. Such rules are rules of\nthumb that a coach may advise a player to follow to help her better\nexecute the skills of the sport (e.g. keep your eye on the ball, follow\nthrough after impact, accelerate through the finish line).\n\n\nThe final element of gameplaying is attitudinal. Suits argues that,\nto play a game, one must have the \u2018lusory attitude\u2019.\nPlayers must commit themselves to playing in accordance with the rules\nthat constitute the game just so that the game can take place. The type\nof motivation must be a particular kind (or at least must\ninclude motivation of a particular kind): players must respect\nthe rules because they wish to play and they endorse the formalist view\nthat breaking the rules necessarily ends the game. It is not sufficient\nto be motivated to respect the rules, for example, to ensure\none\u2019s good reputation or to compete for a\n\u2018sportsmanship\u2019 award. So, in the absence of the lusory\nattitude, it is quite possible, according to Suits, for a player to act\nin accordance with the rules without actually playing the game. The\nplayers accept the constitutive rules because, in the absence of such\nacceptance, no game is possible. On this view, if someone decided that\nshe would break the rules whenever she could do so undetected, then,\naccording to Suits, she is not really playing the game \u2013 even if\nno opportunity to break the rules undetected ever arose. She might\nappear to be playing the game, but, in the absence of an\nacceptance to bind herself to the constraints imposed by the\nconstitutive rules, she would not count as really playing the\ngame. \n\n\nThe four elements in Suits\u2019 analysis of games culminate in the\nfollowing definition:\n\nTo play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs,\nusing only means permitted by the rules, where the rules prohibit use\nof more efficient in favour of less efficient means, and where the\nrules are accepted just because they make possible such activity.\n(Suits, 1978 [2014, 43])\n\n\nSuits also offers a shorthand definition: \u2018playing a game is\nthe voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles\u2019 (Suits,\n1978 [2014, 43]). Suits\u2019 account of games has attracted much critical\nattention. Principal among the objections raised are that games are not\nconstituted by their constitutive rules only (D\u2019Agostino, 1981;\nRussell, 1999) and that gameplaying does not require strict adherence\nto constitutive rules (i.e. some rule-breaking can be consistent with\ngame-playing) (Lehman, 1981; Fraleigh, 2003).\n\n\nSuits draws on his definition of games to provide a definition of\nsport. He defines sports as \u2018games of physical skill\u2019\n(Suits, 1988, 2), incorporating the elements of his earlier\ndefinition of game and adding further elements that are distinctive to\nsport as compared to other types of games. In particular, a game\nbecomes a sport by meeting the following criteria: \u2018(1) that the\ngame be a game of skill; (2) that the skill be physical; (3) that the\ngame has a wide following; and (4) that the following achieve a\ncertain level of stability\u2019 (Suits, 1973 [2007]). Thus, the\noutcome of the game must be dependent on the exercise of physical\nskills. This is what differentiates sporting games from card games or\nchess, for example (see Kobiela, 2018 and Hale, 2008). In the latter,\nthe way the body is moved is irrelevant, and what matters are the\nmoves made (either with cards or pieces on the board). Indeed, such\ngames can be played in non-physical spaces such as virtual reality and\nby non-human players such as computers. However, in soccer or boxing,\nthe skillful control of the body is essential to the achievement of\nthe goal of the game.\n\n\nThe third and fourth criteria in Suits\u2019 definition demand that\nsports are widely followed institutionalized games. A sport is\ninstitutionalized when its norms and codified rules are established and\nenforced by formal associations or organizations. The\ninstitutionalization criterion is often employed in sociological and\nhistorical analyses of sport. For example, historian Allen Guttmann\n(1978) argues that bureaucratization and rationalization are defining\ncomponents of modern sports. Sport philosophers, however, have remained\nskeptical about the possibility of defining sports as institutionalized\ngames. For instance, Klaus V. Meier (1988) rejects the\ninstitutionalization criterion. For him, the institutionalization\naspect is not a defining element of sport, but rather a contingent one\nthat \u2018adds color and significance to particular sports\u2019\n(Meier, 1988, 15). In his view, should soccer lack international\nfollowing and institutions to establish and enforce the rules of the\ngame, it would still be a sport. \n\n\nIn \u2018Tricky Triad,\u2019 Suits revises his original definition\nof sport from \u2018The Elements of Sport\u2019, redefining sports\nas\n\n\u2026 competitive events involving a variety of physical (usually\nin combination with other) human skills, where the superior\nparticipant is judged to have exhibited those skills in a superior\nway. (Suits, 1988: 2)\n\n\nIn this definition, Suits narrows the scope of the concept of\n\u2018game\u2019 and distinguishes between two types of sports:\n\u2018refereed games\u2019 and \u2018judged performances.\u2019\nThat is to say, whereas in his earlier definition all sports\nare games, in his revised definition only some sports are\ngames, other sports are performances. Soccer, basketball, tennis, and\nAmerican football are games, while gymnastics, figure skating, and\ndiving are performances. The key difference between the two, according\nto Suits, is that games have constitutive rules, whereas performances\nlack constitutive rules and have only rules of skill. Thus, for Suits,\ngames consist in overcoming obstacles erected by the constitutive\nrules, whereas performances centre on the approximation of an ideal or\nperfect performance. For example, soccer players play the ball with\ntheir feet cooperatively as a team to put the ball into the opponent\u2019s\nnet. Using the feet, working as a team, and facing an opponent are the\nobstacles erected by the rules of soccer. For Suits, there is nothing\nlike these in performances. Figure skaters do not attempt to overcome\nobstacles. Rather, they try to approach an ideal performance that\nmanifests virtues such as power, grace, and imagination. \n\n\nThis revised definition sparked a classic debate in the philosophy\nof sport between Suits and Meier. The latter criticized Suits\u2019 revised\ndefinition of sport and defended the original one. For Meier (1988),\nSuits\u2019 original definition is correct because what Suits calls\n\u2018performances\u2019 also have constitutive rules. For example,\ngymnasts perform their acrobatics in a specific space, utilising\ncertain equipment. Kretchmar agrees with Meier that both types of\nsports are games, but acknowledges that performances place more\nemphasis on aesthetic criteria, calling them \u2018beautiful\ngames\u2019 (Kretchmar, 1989). Despite criticism, Suits\u2019 definitions\nof games and sport serve as the point of departure for most\ncontemporary philosophical theorising about sport, thereby making Suits\nthe most influential figure in the discipline.\n\n\nTurning to formalism more generally, adherents of this view take\nrules to be the normative cornerstone of a proper ethical analysis of\nsport. They define the rightness and wrongness of conduct within sport\nsolely in terms of rule-following. Strict formalists contend that one\ncannot play the game and break the rules at the same time (i.e. the\n\u2018logical incompatibility thesis\u2019). If gameplaying requires\nadherence to the rules, then any rule violation \u2013 intentional or\notherwise \u2013 marks an end to the game. Formalists oppose strategic\nfouling and doping because both practices involve breaking the rules\n(Moore, 2017a; Morgan, 1987; P\u00e9rez Trivi\u00f1o, 2014).\n\n\nFormalist analyses of sport hold important similarities to debates\nwithin the philosophy of law about the nature of law. Indeed, the works\nof philosophers of law such as Ronald Dworkin and H. L. A. Hart, as\nwell as philosophical analyses of rules such as those of Immanuel Kant\nand John R. Searle, have been influential within formalism (Kretchmar,\n2001; Torres, 2000).\n\n\nFormalism has been criticised as an inadequate normative theory of\nsport on account of its failure to recognise non-rule based norms in\nsport. As formalists do not recognise normative reasons internal to\nsport other than the rules themselves, they lack criteria to evaluate\nexisting or proposed rules as well as criteria to evaluate actions not\ncontemplated in the rulebook. Kretchmar attempts to salvage formalism\nfrom this criticism by drawing on both Suits and Searle. In Kretchmar\u2019s\nview, critics of formalism overlook the fact that games and, a\nfortiori, constitutive rules are created to serve a function: to\nprovide engaging, artificial problems. Games are made by humans for\nhumans. Human biological nature is, in Searle\u2019s terms, a \u2018brute fact\u2019\nthat gamewrights consider when creating the rules. They craft games\nthat fit human capacities to present a \u2018just right\u2019 challenge\n(Kretchmar, 2015a). Otherwise, games would fail to perform their\nfunction. Kretchmar argues that Suits\u2019 account already contains\nthe resources necessary to discharge this evaluative function of an\nadequate normative theory of sport. Suits argues that when games set an\nextremely difficult or extremely easy obstacle, individuals lose\ninterest in playing them (Kretchmar, 1975). Such games, then, fail to\nfulfil their goal of providing players with a worthy set of obstacles\nto overcome.\n\n\nAnother criticism that has been levelled against formalism is the\napparently implausible implication of the logical incompatibility\nthesis that any game in which a rule is broken ends at the point at\nwhich the rule-breaking occurs. If rule-breaking is incompatible with\ngameplaying then any foul or accidental transgression of the rules\nwould cause the game to end. For instance, a 100m sprint would cease\nwhen a runner makes a false start. A basketball game would terminate\nwhen a player commits a strategic foul to prevent an opponent from\nscoring in a fast break. A tennis match would end whenever a shot is\nhit out. Formalists have attempted to overcome this objection by\ndistinguishing between \u2018constitutive rules\u2019 and\n\u2018regulative rules\u2019. The latter allow the game to be\nreinstated following a transgression of the rules by determining how\nthe game is to be restarted (e.g. restarting the race, a free kick, a\nsecond serve) and how rule-breakers are to be penalized (e.g.\ndisqualified from the race, a penalty kick awarded to the opposing\nteam, the loss of a point). For Graham McFee (2004b), this constitutive\nrule/regulative rule distinction does not address the objection\nadequately, as it remains unclear when a rule is constitutive or\nregulative. For instance, an outfield player in soccer using her hands\nto stop a counterattack would be considered a strategic foul and,\ntherefore, judged according to a regulative rule. However, if players\nconstantly used their hands, the game would become either impossible\n(e.g. all players are eventually sent off) or a different game (e.g.\nrugby or handball). Thus, according to McFee, rules must be understood\nbased on how participants use them in specific contexts. However,\nformalism does not provide the resources to make these contextual\ndiscriminations. What criteria should we use to evaluate the rules of a\nsport? When should we change the rules of a sport? Can we evaluate a\npurported need for rule change without appealing to some consideration\nother than the rules themselves? \n",
