    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nValla did not have an easy life. Equipped with a sharp and polemical\nmind, an even sharper pen and a sense of self-importance verging on\nthe pathological, he made many enemies throughout his life. Born in\nRome in (most likely) 1406 to a family with ties to the papal curia,\nValla as a young man was already in close contact with some major\nhumanists working as papal secretaries such as Leonardo Bruni\n(1370\u20131444) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380\u20131459). Another\nwas his uncle Melchior Scrivani, whom Valla had hoped to succeed after\nhis death; but opposition from Poggio and Antonio Loschi\n(1365/8\u20131441) must have led the pope to refuse to employ him.\nValla had criticized an elegy by Loschi, and had also boldly favored\nQuintilian over Cicero in a treatise which has long considered to be\nlost; but a lengthy anonymous prefatory letter has recently been found\nand ascribed, convincingly, to the young Valla (Pagliaroli 2008; it\nturns out not to be a comparison between Cicero\u2019s theory of\nrhetoric and Quintilian\u2019s handbook, as scholars have always\nassumed, but a comparison between a declamation of Ps-Quintilian,\nGladiator\u2014the declamations were considered to be the\nwork of Quintilian in Valla\u2019s time\u2014and one of\nCicero\u2019s orations, Pro Ligario.) Valla\u2019s Roman\nexperience of humanist conversations found an outlet in his dialogue\nDe voluptate (On Pleasure), in which the Christian\nconcepts of charity and beatitude are identified with hedonist\npleasure, while the \u201cStoic\u201d concept of virtue is rejected\n(see below). Valla would later revise the dialogue and change the\nnames of the interlocutors, but his Epicurean-Christian position\nremained the same.\n\nMeanwhile he had moved to Pavia in 1431, stimulated by his friend\nPanormita (Antonio Beccadelli, 1394\u20131471)\u2014with whom he was\nsoon to quarrel\u2014and had begun to teach rhetoric. He had to flee\nPavia, however, in 1433 after having aroused the anger of the jurists.\nIn a letter to a humanist jurist friend of his, Catone Sacco\n(1394\u20131463), Valla had attacked the language of one of the\nlawyers\u2019 main authorities, Bartolus of Sassoferrato\n(1313\u20131357). After some travelling, in 1435 Valla found\nemployment at the court of Alfonso of Aragon (1396\u20131458), who\nwas trying to capture Naples. Though complaining about the lack of\ntime, books and fellow humanists, Valla was immensely productive in\nthis phase of his career. In 1439 he finished the first version of his\ncritique of scholastic philosophy. Two years later he finished his\nElegantiae linguae Latinae, a manual for the correct use of\nLatin syntax and vocabulary, which became a bestseller throughout\nEurope. As a humanist in the court of a king who was fighting against\nthe pope, Valla demonstrated that the Donation of Constantine, which\nhad served the papacy to claim worldly power, was a forgery. In the\nsame years he composed a dialogue on free will and began working on\nhis annotations to the standard Latin translation of the Bible,\ncomparing it with the Greek text of the New Testament. He also wrote a\ndialogue On the Profession of the Religious (De\nprofessione religiosorum), in which he attacked the vow of\nobedience and asceticism taken by members of religious orders.\nFurther, he worked on the text of Livy, wrote a history of the deeds\nof Alfonso\u2019s father, and began re-reading and annotating\nQuintilian\u2019s Institutio oratoria (Education of the\nOrator) in a manuscript which is still extant (Paris,\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, lat. 7723). But Valla\u2019s\nphilological approach and his penchant for quarreling made him enemies\nat the Aragonese court. After his patron Alfonso had made peace with\nthe pope in 1443, Valla\u2019s role as an anti-papal polemicist may\nhave shrunk. His enemies took advantage of the situation. The\nimmediate occasion was Valla\u2019s denial of the apostolic origin of\nthe Symbolum Apostolicum (Apostle\u2019s Creed). In a\nletter, now lost, to the Neapolitan lawyers he argued that a passage\nfrom Gratian\u2019s Decretum that formed the basis of the\nbelief in the apostolic origin of the Creed was corrupt and needed\nemendation. Powerful men at the court staged an inquisitorial trial to\ndetermine whether Valla\u2019s works contained heretical and\nheterodox opinions. In preparation for the trial Valla wrote a\nself-defense (and later an \u201cApology\u201d), but was rescued\nfrom this perilous situation by the intervention of the king. The\nwhole affair must have fuelled Valla\u2019s wish to return to Rome.\nIn 1447 he made peace with the pope and became an apostolic\nscriptor (scribe), and later, in 1455, a papal secretary. In\nthese years he revised some of his earlier works such as the\nRepastinatio and his notes on the New Testament, and\ntranslated Thucydides and Herodotus into Latin; his work on\nThucydides, in particular, was to have an important impact on the\nstudy of this difficult Greek author. Always an irascible man, he\ncontinued to engage in quarrels and exchanged a series of invectives\nwith his arch-enemy Poggio. He died in 1457, still working on a second\nrevision of his Dialectics (that is, the third version). He\nwas buried in the Lateran, where his grave was removed in the\nsixteenth century, probably between the 1560s and 1580s at a time when\nhis works were put on the Index; the present memorial is not Valla\u2019s\ntombstone.\n\nValla\u2019s impact on the humanist movement was long-lasting and\nvaried. His philological approach was developed by subsequent\ngenerations of humanists, and found, arguably, its first systematic\nexpression in the work of Angelo Poliziano (1454\u20131494). His\nElegantiae was printed many times, either in the original or\nin one of its many adaptations and abridgments made by later scholars.\nA copy of his annotations on the New Testament was found near Louvain\nby Erasmus (1467?\u20131534), who published it. Though many\ntheologians complained about his ignorance of theology, Luther and\nLeibniz, each for his own reasons, found occasion to refer to\nValla\u2019s dialogue on free will. Humanists found Valla\u2019s\ncriticisms of Aristotelian-scholastic thought congenial, though not a\nfew regarded his style as too aggressive and polemical. And though\nsome humanists such as Juan Luis Vives (1492\u20131540) and Johann\nEck (1486\u20131543) complained about Valla\u2019s lack of\nphilosophical acumen, his critique of scholasticism has a place in the\nlong transformation from medieval to modern thought\u2014in which\nhumanism played an important though by no means exclusive role.\n",
