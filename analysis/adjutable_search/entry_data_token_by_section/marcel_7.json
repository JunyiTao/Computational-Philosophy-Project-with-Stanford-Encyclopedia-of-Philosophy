The Spirit of Abstraction\n\nAlthough secondary reflection is able to recoup the unity of\nexperience that primary reflection dissects, it is possible that\nsecondary reflection can be frustrated. One example of the frustration\nof secondary reflection and the mysterious is the functional person;\nhowever, this is really just one example of a more general phenomenon:\nthe person who has given in to the \u201cspirit of\nabstraction.\u201d When we engage in primary reflection without\nproceeding to the synthesizing, recollecting act of secondary\nreflection, we fall victim to what Marcel calls the spirit of\nabstraction. \u201cAs soon as we accord to any category, isolated\nfrom all other categories, an arbitrary primacy, we are victims of the\nspirit of abstraction\u201d (Marcel 1962b, pp.\n 155\u2013156).[7]\n\nAbstraction, which is in essence the kind of thinking that\ncharacterizes primary reflection, is not always bad per se. However,\nneither is it, always an \u201cessentially intellectual\u201d\noperation (Marcel 1962b, p. 156). That is, contrary to what the\nsuccesses of science and technology might tell us, we may succumb to\nthe spirit of abstraction out of passional reasons rather than\nintellectual expediency. Abstraction\u2014which is always abstraction\nfrom an embodied, concrete existence\u2014can overcome our concrete\nexistence and we may come to view abstracted elements of existence as\nif they were independent. As Marcel describes it: \u201cit can happen\nthat the mind, yielding to a sort of fascination, ceases to be aware\nof these prior conditions that justify abstraction and deceives itself\nabout the nature of what is, in itself, nothing more than a\nmethod\u201d (Marcel 1962b, p. 156). The significance of this\nphenomenon for Marcel would be difficult to overstate\u2014indeed, in\nMan Against Mass Society, Marcel argues that the spirit of\nabstraction is inherently disingenuous and violent, and a significant\nfactor in the making of war\u2014and there is a sense in which his\nwhole philosophical project is an \u201cobstinate and untiring battle\nagainst the spirit of abstraction\u201d (Marcel 1962b, p.\n 1).[8]\n",
