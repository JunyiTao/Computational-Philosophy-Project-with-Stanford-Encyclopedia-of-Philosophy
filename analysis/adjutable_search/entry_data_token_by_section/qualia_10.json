Russellian Monism about Qualia\n\nRussellian Monism (RM) gets its name from a view Bertrand Russell held\nin 1927 and that he himself called \u2018neutral monism\u2019. The key idea\nof this view is that the fundamental entities in micro-reality have\nintrinsic natures not specified in microphysics, natures made up of\nproperties (known as quiddities), some of which are crucial to\nconsciousness and conscious states. The standard reductive version\nholds that the relevant properties are themselves genuinely conscious\nproperties (that is, qualia) of various sorts. Advocates include for\nexample, Grover Maxwell (1978), David Chalmers (1995 and 1997), Dan\nStoljar (2001 and 2006), Galen Strawson (2006), and Barbara Montero\n(2010). An alternative version of Russellian Monism has it that the\nrelevant properties are only proto-phenomenal. On one interesting\nversion of this view (panqualityism), these properties are not\ngenuinely phenomenal since they are unexperienced but they are\nnonetheless of the same kind as the phenomenal qualities present in\nour experiences of pain or color (Coleman 2006, 2015). It is a\nconsequence of this view that the latter qualities themselves are\nqualities of a sort that are only contingently experienced. What makes\nthese qualities qualia just is the fact that they are experienced.\n\n\nThere is debate about whether RM is really a physicalist view. One\nthing at least is clear: RM differs from the usual forms of\nphysicalism in its reliance on quiddities and its assertion that\nspecific quiddities are crucial to macro-conscious states. Of course,\nif the Russellian monist holds that some quiddities are genuinely\nphenomenal properties, then some physical things will have subjective\nproperties as well as objective ones. And this might lead some to deny\nthat RM is really a form of physicalism. Still, this seems to me a\nverbal dispute about how to use the term \u2018physicalism\u2019.\n\nRussellian monists can say that they agree with dualists about the\nconceivability (and indeed metaphysical possibility) of zombies.\nZombies are conceivable, they can claim, since it is conceivable that\nthere are beings the same as us except for the phenomenally relevant\nquiddities. These beings are structurally, functionally, and\nbehaviorally just like us but they lack any conscious states.\n\nThe quiddities generally that are phenomenally relevant are very\ndifferent from macro-phenomenal properties; for it would be absurd to\nhold that quarks feel pains and itches and experience colors. So how\nare our qualia related to micro-qualia? This question poses the\ncombination problem for the Russellian monist about macro-qualia (see\nhere Goff 2006, Coleman 2014, Lewtas 2013, Roelofs 2019, Tye 2021). If\nour qualia are simple, then there is real emergence and reductive\nRussellian Monism is false. On the other hand, if our qualia are\ngenerated from combinations of micro-qualia, then why is it that our\nqualia seem (in some cases at any rate) so simple, so utterly lacking\nin components? To date, there is no agreed upon solution to the\ncombination problem.\n",
