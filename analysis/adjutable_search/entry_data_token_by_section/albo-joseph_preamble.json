    "main_text": "\n\n\nJoseph Albo (c. 1380\u20131444) was a Jewish philosopher active in\nChristian Spain in the first half of the fifteenth century. His\ntheoretical work found expression in his well-known opus Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim [Book of Principles], completed in 1425 in\nthe town of Soria in the crown of Castile. In this work, Albo\naddresses a wide variety of interpretive, theological and\nphilosophical issues, in a style integrating logical, methodical\nanalyses with exegetical discussions. Albo\u2019s composition reveals his\nexposure to the works of many Jewish philosophers that preceded him,\nparticularly Maimonides, Hasdai Crescas (Albo\u2019s teacher in his\nformative years), and his contemporary, Simeon ben Zemah Duran. The\nhistorical circumstances in which he functioned, especially the\nCatholic Church\u2019s persecution of the Jews in Christian Spain, led him\nto contribute to the anti-Christian polemic, and apparently also\npermitted his exposure to the writings of such Christian philosophers\nas Thomas Aquinas.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s central contribution to the history of Jewish philosophy is his\ntheory of principles. In his theory, he determines the fundamental,\nnecessary beliefs that a person must uphold in order to belong to the\nsystem called \u201cdivine law.\u201d This theory serves as an\nalternative to previous lists of principles, especially the thirteen\nprinciples of faith formulated by Maimonides. Albo\u2019s list includes\nonly three fundamental beliefs: the existence of God, the divine\norigin of the Torah, and reward and punishment. The following\nparagraphs will outline Albo\u2019s theory and several of the prominent\nissues in his thought, such as the theory of law, the theory of divine\nattributes, the theory of human perfection and the theory of\nprovidence and reward.\n",
