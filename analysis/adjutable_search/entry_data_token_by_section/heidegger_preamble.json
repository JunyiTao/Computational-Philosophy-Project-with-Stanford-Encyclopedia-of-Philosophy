    "main_text": "\n\n\nMartin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) was a German philosopher whose work is\nperhaps most readily associated with phenomenology and existentialism,\nalthough his thinking should be identified as part of such\nphilosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification. His\nideas have exerted a seminal influence on the development of\ncontemporary European philosophy. They have also had an impact far\nbeyond philosophy, for example in architectural theory (see e.g., Sharr\n2007), literary criticism (see e.g., Ziarek 1989), theology (see e.g.,\nCaputo 1993), psychotherapy (see e.g., Binswanger 1943/1964, Guignon\n1993) and cognitive science (see e.g., Dreyfus 1992, 2008; Wheeler 2005;\nKiverstein and Wheeler 2012).\n",
