Two principal questions with\nregard to sex and gender arise in sport: is sex segregation in sporting\ncompetition morally justifiable? If so, in what category should trans\nand intersex athletes compete?\n\n\nThe starting point for the sex segregation debate is Jane\nEnglish\u2019s \u2018Sex Equality in Sport\u2019 (1978). English\nconsiders what equality of opportunity between the sexes requires in\nsport. She argues that a just society would incorporate a greater\nvariety of sports than at present. Specifically, sports that reward\n\u2018women\u2019s distinctive abilities\u2019 (English, 1978, 227)\n(e.g. flexibility, low centre of gravity) would be more numerous. On\ngrounds of self-respect, women should enjoy roughly half of the\n\u2018basic benefits\u2019 of health and recreation. This includes\nthe right to equal facilities. This would require significant\nre-ordering of how resources are distributed between the sexes within\nsport. Ultimately, however, English advocates a (qualified)\nretention of binary sex segregation in sport. The contours of this\ndistinction have been challenged by intersex, trans, and non-gendered\nathletes who do not fit comfortably into either category. The question\n\u2018Who is a sportswoman?\u2019 (Camporesi, 2017) has never been\nmore contested.\n\n\nTo police sex segregation in competition, sports authorities have\nadopted a variety of approaches to sex verification at different times\nsince the 1930s. These have included visual tests, chromosome\ntests, and testosterone tests. The prevailing approach to the\neligibility of trans women to compete in women\u2019s events does not\npreclude those who are biologically male from competing in\nwomen\u2019s sport, but it requires that their testosterone level\nremains below a certain threshold for a period prior to and\ncontinuously throughout their time competing in women\u2019s\ncompetition (IOC, 2015). The requirement that trans, as well as\nintersex, women whose natural testosterone level is above the permitted\nthreshold must undergo hormone treatment (i.e. androgen suppressive\ntherapy) to bring their level below that threshold has been criticised\nas the unnecessary medicalisation of healthy athletes and a violation\nof the principle of beneficence in medical ethics. (Camporesi, 2016).\nCritics have suggested that athletes should not be required to meet\ncertain physiological criteria to be eligible to compete in a\nparticular gender category. Proposals sympathetic to this view have\nincluded that athletes should be allowed to compete in the gender\ncategory with which they identify (Davis and Edwards 2014); that trans\nwomen athletes should be allowed to compete in women\u2019s sport but,\nto mitigate unfair advantage, should be subject to a handicap based on\neffective testosterone levels (Bianchi, 2017); and, finally, that\neligibility should be determined by legally recognised gender (McKinnon\nand Conrad, forthcoming) \n\n\nAt the heart of this debate is whether trans women enjoy an unfair\nadvantage over cis female athletes (i.e. athletes who were assigned the sex of\nfemale at birth and whose gender identity is female). Some have suggested that testosterone has not been\nproved to provide an advantage in competition (Camporesi, 2016) or that\nthe advantage it provides, even if unfair, may be tolerably unfair\n(Devine, 2019). Moreover, no attempt is made to regulate other\nbiological and genetic variations that provide a clear performance\nadvantage. For example, there is no attempt to exclude or regulate\nathletes with Marfan syndrome. However, the long limbs and flexible\njoints associated with that condition provide a clear advantage for\nswimmers, basketball players, and volleyball players. It has been\nsuggested that, if there is no morally relevant difference between\nadvantages that result from sex and those that result from other\nbiological and genetic variations, why should testosterone levels be\nregulated when other such variations relevant to sporting performance\nare not (Camporesi 2017; Camporesi and Maugeri 2016)?\n\n\nA more fundamental challenge has been levelled at the very\ninstitution of sex segregation in sport. It has been proposed that the\norganisation of sport should be indifferent to an athlete\u2019s sex, so men and women should compete with and against each other. On this view,\nrather than retaining sex segregation, which involves\ndiscrimination against women as well as complex questions concerning\nthe proper categorization of intersex, trans, and non-gendered\nathletes, we should eliminate sex segregation altogether, and sport\nshould either be open (not segregated at all) (Tamburrini, 2000a, ch.\n6; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2000) or segregated along dimensions other than\nsex such as weight, height, haemoglobin level, or testosterone level\n(Knox et al, 2019).\n\n\nAside from the sex segregation question, there has been much\ndiscussion of sport as a site of gender politics. The role that sport\nplays in the construction of gender (including gender hierarchies) was\ntaken up in Iris Marion Young\u2019s classic paper \u2018Throwing\nLike a Girl\u2019 (1980) which explores the modalities of feminine bodily\nexistence for women in contemporary society. Young\u2019s central\nclaim is that such modalities of feminie movement, motility, and\nspatiality have as their source not anatomy or physiology but the\nparticular situation of women, which is shaped by sexist oppression\n(Young, 1980). The framework developed by Young has inspired\nphenomenologies of female embodiment in particular sports such as\nsurfing (Brennan, 2016) and climbing (Chisholm, 2008), which delineate\nthe oppression of women within these sporting communities arising from\nprevailing sexist notions of the female body. Young has also argued\nthat, as long as women\u2019s bodies are understood as objects, they\nare excluded by the culture from sport. This cultural exclusion of\nwomen from sport, in turn, creates a masculine bias within sport, which\nprecludes the exhibition of sport\u2019s potential humanity (Young,\n1979). There has also been discussion of whether the very nature of\ncompetiton \u2013 a central feature of sport \u2013 is masculinist\nand inherently incompatible with feminism (Davion, 1987).\n\n\nCompared to the well-developed literature around sex and gender in\nsport, issues around race and sport have received surprisingly little\nattention in the philosophy of sport literature (with exceptions\nincluding disparate articles by Mosley, 2003; Lapchick, 2003; and\nMarqusee, 2003). However, recent political activism by American\nfootball star Colin Kaepernick to highlight systematic racism in the\nUnited States against African Americans has inspired philosophical work\nabout race and sport, and the ethics of political activism by athletes\n(Brackett, 2017; Klein, 2017; Marston, 2017; Sailors, 2017; and Rorke\nand Copeland, 2017).\n\n\nSeveral Foucauldian post-structuralists and existentialists have\nexplored the connections between hegemonic racial power structures and\nsport (Early, 2007). For instance, writers such as Grant Farred (2018),\nErin C. Tarver (2018), and Katrhryn E. Henne (2015), have explored\nthemes around sports and white (and/or colonial) hegemonic interests.\nThey have examined whether sport and the engagement of minorities in\nsport perpetuates and promotes white privilege and white interests\n(Henne, 2015). They have also critiqued the hegemonic forces\npurportedly used by the institutionalized and corporate structure of\nsport to discipline and exploit minorities, especially in professional\nsport and American college sport (Hawkins, 2001; Farred,\n2018). \n",
