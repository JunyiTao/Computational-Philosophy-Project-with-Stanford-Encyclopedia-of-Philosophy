    "main_text": "Definitions || Definition and Demonstration\n7.5 Definition and Demonstration\n\nClosely related to this is the discussion, in Posterior\nAnalytics II.3\u201310, of the question whether there can be\nboth definition and demonstration of the same thing (that is, whether\nthe same result can be established either by definition or by\ndemonstration). Since the definitions Aristotle is interested in are\nstatements of essences, knowing a definition is knowing, of some\nexisting thing, what it is. Consequently, Aristotle\u2019s question\namounts to a question whether defining and demonstrating can be\nalternative ways of acquiring the same knowledge. His reply is\ncomplex:\n\nNot everything demonstrable can be known by finding definitions,\nsince all definitions are universal and affirmative whereas some\ndemonstrable propositions are negative.\nIf a thing is demonstrable, then to know it just is to possess its\ndemonstration; therefore, it cannot be known just by definition.\nNevertheless, some definitions can be understood as demonstrations\ndifferently arranged.\n\n\nAs an example of case 3, Aristotle considers the definition\n\u201cThunder is the extinction of fire in the clouds\u201d. He sees\nthis as a compressed and rearranged form of this demonstration:\n\nSound accompanies the extinguishing of fire.\nFire is extinguished in the clouds.\nTherefore, a sound occurs in the clouds.\n\n\nWe can see the connection by considering the answers to two questions:\n\u201cWhat is thunder?\u201d \u201cThe extinction of fire in the\nclouds\u201d (definition). \u201cWhy does it thunder?\u201d\n\u201cBecause fire is extinguished in the clouds\u201d\n(demonstration).\n\nAs with his criticisms of Division, Aristotle is arguing for the\nsuperiority of his own concept of science to the Platonic concept.\nKnowledge is composed of demonstrations, even if it may also include\ndefinitions; the method of science is demonstrative, even if it may\nalso include the process of defining.\n",
