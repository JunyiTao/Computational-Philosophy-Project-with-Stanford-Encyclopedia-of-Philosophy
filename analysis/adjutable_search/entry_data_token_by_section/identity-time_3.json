    "main_text": "Identity and Change || Candidate Solutions\n2.4 Candidate Solutions\n\nLewis considers three answers to this question. According to the first\nfor some object O to be F at t is for the\nrelation of being F to tenselessly, or timelessly, hold\nbetween O and time t. For example, for Plate to be\nround at t1 is for the two-place relation of being\nround at to hold between Plate and t1. Something\ncan stand in the relation of being round at to the earlier time\nt1 without standing in that relation to the later\ntime t2. So there is no reason to think that\nstanding in the relation of being round at to t1\nis incompatible with standing in the relation of being square at to\nt2. By transmuting the ostensibly one place\nrelational properties of being round and being square into the two\nplace relational properties of being round at and being square at we\ncan show how something can be round at one time and square at\nanother.\n\nLewis' principle objection to this first solution is that it\ntransforms intrinsic into extrinsic properties. He takes it as evident\nthat properties such as being round and being red are intrinsic. Why\nso? Call the view that putatively one place intrinsic properties are\ntwo place relational properties the relational view. Why does Lewis so\nadamantly reject that view? One difficulty with answering this\nquestion is a difficulty about locating the source of Lewis' disquiet\nwith the relational view.\n\nIs it that Lewis rejects the relational view because it treats\nputatively intrinsic properties as extrinsic, or because it discerns\nan extra place in a putatively monadic property? That it is the latter\nis suggested by the following. The problem of temporary intrinsics\nappears to arise because nothing can have the intrinsic properties of\nbeing round and being square, unless it has those properties at\ndifferent times. The same goes for pairs of extrinsic properties. The\nproperty of being the same height as the Eiffel Tower is extrinsic as\nis the property of being different in height from the Eiffel Tower.\nSomething can change from being the same height as the Eiffel Tower to\nbeing different in height from that structure even though nothing can\nsimultaneously have the properties of being the same height as, and\nbeing different in height from, the Eiffel Tower. Suppose we say that\nsomething can be the same height as the Eiffel Tower at some time\nt1 without being the same height as the Eiffel\ntower at some distinct time t2. In that case we\nappear to be confronted with the same problem as the one that\noriginally raised the problem of temporary intrinsics. We are\nconfronted with the task of explaining what it is for something to\nhave, in this case, the property of being the same height as the\nEiffel Tower at time t1. If we respond, it is for\nthe three place relation of being the same height as at to hold\nbetween some object, the Eiffel Tower, and time t1\nwe are, treating an ostensibly two place relation as a three place one\neven though we are not treating an intrinsic property as\nextrinsic.\n\nLewis considers an alternative explanation of what it is for an object\nto have a property at a time. What might be called the\n\u2018according to\u2019 explanation. We are used to something\nhaving a property according to one story, but failing to have that\nproperty according to another. If we think of a time as a set of\npropositions describing what holds at that time, we can say that\naccording to one such set plate is round, but according to another it\nis square.\n\nLewis gives the according to explanation short shrift. We may think it\ncannot be so readily dismissed if it is combined with a view about\nexistence and time that has received considerable discussion in recent\nyears. The view is called Presentism. On the Presentist view the only\nthings that exist without qualification are things that presently\nexist. Suppose t1, a time when Plate is round, is\nthe present. In that case if Plate is ever square it will be, or was\nsquare. What is it for Plate to be round? Given that plate is\npresently round what makes it the case that Plate is round is not just\nthat Plate is round according to some set of propositions about the\npresent. Instead what makes it the case that Plate is presently round\nis that plate exists and is round. So, what makes it the case that\nPlate, say, will be square? Not, the Presentist will say, this: Plate\ntenselessly or timelessly exists, and will be square. So what makes it\nthe case that Plate will be square? Perhaps this. What makes it true\nthat Plate will be square is that Plate is square according to some\nrelevant future tensed presently existing propositions.\n\nHere is one reason why we might think that Presentism does not, in the\nend, help with the problem of temporary intrinsics. Suppose that, at\nt1, we send a circular object forward in time to\nt2. At t2 the shape of the\ncircular object changes so that it becomes elliptical. Retaining its\nelliptical shape the object is sent back to t1. Even\nif Presentism is true at t1 we have an object with\nincompatible intrinsic properties.\n\nOf course, to embrace this combination of an according to explanation\nwith Presentism is to embrace just one of a number of options\navailable to the Presentist for giving the truthmakers of future and\npast tense propositions.\n\nWhether or not a Presentist wishes to take over in this way the\n\u2018according to\u2019 explanation, Presentism provides a solution\nto the problem of temporary intrinsics. Presentists can deny that it\nfollows from something at one time being round that will at another\ntime be square that there exists something both round and square.\n2.5 Alternative Solutions\n\n\nLewis, we saw, denies that a sentence such as \u2018Plate is square\nat t1\u2019 states something true just in case\nPlate stands in the square at relation to t1. In\nhis original exposition of the problem of temporary intrinsics, Lewis\ndoes not consider a variety of other ways of understanding sentences\nattributing ostensibly intrinsic properties to objects at times. Here\nis one. Many take it that a relation of instantiation holds between a\nproperty and its instances. Suppose instantiation is not a two place,\nbut, at least, a three place relation holding between an object,\nproperty and time. If so, Plate is round at t1 if\nand only if Plate stands in the instantiation relation to the\n(non-relational) property of roundness and t1.\nMoreover Plate standing in the instantiation relation to roundness and\nt1 is clearly consistent with Plate failing to\nstand in the instantiation relation to roundness and the different\ntime t2. The key difference between this view\nand the relational view that Lewis considers is the following. On the\nrelational view we take an ostensibly non-relational property such as\nbeing circular to be relational and extrinsic [extrinsic because\nhaving it requires an object to stand in a relation to a time]. On the\ninstantiation view we are taking something, the instantiation\nrelation, that is already an extrinsic relation to have an extra\nplace. So, our intuitions about what counts as an intrinsic\nnon-relational property are not violated.\n\n\nAlternative ways of taking \u2018a is red at\nt\u2019 include treating \u2018at t\u2019 as an\nadverbial modifier, or as a sentential operator. According to the\nfirst \u2018at t\u2019, better written as \u2018at\nt-ly\u2019, is an adverbial modifier specifying the way in\nwhich something has a property. So \u2018Plate is round at\nt1\u2019 is true just in case Plate has roundness\nat-t1-ly. Plate, on this view, can be round at\nt1, but square at t2 because\nPlate can have roundness at t1-ly without having\nroundness at-t2-ly (See Johnston 1987, Haslanger\n1989).\n\nAccording to the temporal operator view \u2018at\nt1\u2019 and \u2018at\nt2\u2019 should be understood as the temporal\noperators: \u2018at t1 it is true that\n\u2026\u2019 and \u2018at t2 it is true that\n\u2026\u2019. Just as \u2018it is possible that Plate is\nround\u2019 is consistent with \u2018it is possible that Plate is\nsquare\u2019 so \u2018at t1 it is true that\nPlate is round\u2019 is consistent with \u2018at\nt2 it is true that Plate is square\u2019.\n\nSolutions to the problem of temporary intrinsics abound. Here is\nanother that treats being true and being false as three place\nrelations between propositions, facts and times. Consider the\npropositions:\n\n(i) Plate is round,\n\n\nAnd:\n\n(ii) Plate is square.\n\n\nWe should distinguish between a property of a proposition, and a\nproperty that is a constituent of a proposition. Being a proposition\nis a property of (i), but is not a constituent of (i). In contrast,\nbeing round is a constituent of (i), but is not a property of (i).\nPropositions have no shape. Can we hold that (i) and (ii) are both\ntrue compatibly with taking roundness and squareness to be intrinsic\nproperties?\n\nIt is plausible to suppose that that the truth value of a proposition\nsuch as (i) or (ii) depends on the existence of something distinct\nfrom that proposition. Since that is so, let us, as some adherents of\na correspondence theory of truth would do, allow that if (i), say, is\ntrue, it has a relational property of being true. For example being\ntrue may be a relation that holds between (i) and the fact that Plate\nis round.\n\nHow many places are there in what we may call the truth relation? It\nis often though to be a two place relation. Suppose that is wrong, and\ntruth is a three place relation holding between a proposition, fact\nand time. In that case, the three place relation of truth can hold\nbetween (i), the fact that Plate is round, and t1,\nwithout holding between (i), the same fact and\nt2.\n\nOf course whether this is a solution to the problem of temporary\nintrinsics depends on what that problem is. It is a solution if the\nproblem is to explain time indexing without turning intrinsic into\nextrinsic properties. After all, no correspondance theorist would\nallow truth is an intrinsic property. It is not a solution if the\nproblem is to explain time indexing without adding extra places to, it\nmay be, relational properties.\n\nAlternatively, we can follow Haslanger in Haslanger 1989 and Lowe in\nLowe 1987 and treat the relevant propositions as tensed. A change in\nan intrinsic property corresponds, on this view, to a change in the\ntense of a proposition atrributing that property.\n\nLewis (2002) objects to this last solution on the grounds that a\ntensed proposition should itself be identified with a relational\nproperty. But, such identification leaves it unexplained how something\ncan change its non-relational intrinsic properties. Ben Caplan in\nCaplan 2005 has replied to Lewis that Lewis's objection depends on a\nview about propositions that is not compulsory.\n\nLewis favors a different solution to the problem of temporary\nintrinsics (Lewis 1986). Whether or not there is a problem with the\nsame object being round and square, there is no problem with the same\nobject having a round part and a square part. To solve the problem of\ntemporary intrinsics, Lewis invokes the view that, in addition to\ntheir spatial parts, objects have temporal parts or stages. This\nallows him to hold that Plate is round at t1 and\nsquare at t2 because Plate has a round part at\nt1 and a square part at t2.\nPlate's round t1 part exists only at\nt1, and Plate's square t2 part\nexists only at t2. Hence there is no problem posed\nby either temporal part changing its shape. Plate itself is an object\nconsisting of a suitably interrelated sequence of such temporal parts.\nFor the t1 temporal part of Plate to be round is\njust for it to be round. For the longer lived Plate to be round at\nt1 is for Plate to be appropriately related to a\nround temporal part at t1.\n\nAs we have seen in invoking temporal parts or stages Lewis endorses\none species of what has come to be called Four Dimensionalism. The\nexpression \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 has been applied to a\nnumber of different positions that it is well to distinguish here\nsince not all of them are relevant to identity across time.\n\u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 has sometimes been used for the\nthesis, particularly associated with Relativity Theory, that time is\nspace like. On another use of \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 a\npersisting thing is identical with its history. On this view an object\nis a sequence of events. Sometimes \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019\nis used to label the view that, contra Presentism, things past present\nand future are equally real.\n\nLewis' version of Four Dimensionalism should be distinguished from all\nof the above. It is the view that, just as an object such as Plate is\nextended in space with spatial parts, so it is extended in time with\ntemporal parts.\n\nThe problem of temporary intrinsics focuses on the possibility of\npersisting things changing their properties, or, at least, changing\ntheir intrinsic properties. Many of the problems about identity\nthrough time are posed by puzzle cases that involve change of parts.\nFour dimensionalism is one, widely accepted, solution to those\npuzzles. It is not overstretching it to suggest that each of the\npuzzle cases we will shortly consider appears to be a case of\ntemporary identity. That is, each one appears to be a case of the\nfollowing. For some x and y, at some time t\nx is identical with y, and at some time\nt\u2032 x is distinct from y.\n\nIn the first section we briefly looked at one argument, the so-called\nmodal argument for the necessity of identities, for denying that there\ncould be temporary identities. Some philosophers have responded to\nsome of the diachronic identity puzzles by maintaining that there\ncould be indeterminate identities. An argument with a similar\nstructure to the modal argument has been deployed to rule out\nindeterminate identities. Give their implications for identity across\ntime the modal argument and the argument against indeterminate\nidentities are set out in more detail in the next section.\n",
