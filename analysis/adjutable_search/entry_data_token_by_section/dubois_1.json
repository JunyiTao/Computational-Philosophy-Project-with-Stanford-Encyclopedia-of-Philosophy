Social Philosophy, The Negro Problem, and Race\n\nOver the course of his career, Du Bois\u2019s social philosophy\ncomprised contributions to social ontology, social theory, the\nphilosophy of the human and social sciences, and the diagnosis of\nsocial\n problems.[1]\n His analysis of the nature of a social problem and, specifically, his\ndiagnosis of the Negro problem; his social constructionist accounts of\nrace and racial differences; his ongoing reflection on the methods,\npurposes, and sometimes moral significance of social inquiry; and his\nelaboration of the claim that the concept of race, operating as a\nmechanism of power, structures relations of social domination, all\nplayed a critical role in what he ultimately came to call his\n\u201cevolving program for Negro freedom\u201d (1944, 31). The\npresent section bears on Du Bois\u2019s analysis of the Negro problem\nand his contributions to the philosophy of race. Section 3, below,\nfocuses on his contributions to the philosophy of the social\nsciences.\n",
