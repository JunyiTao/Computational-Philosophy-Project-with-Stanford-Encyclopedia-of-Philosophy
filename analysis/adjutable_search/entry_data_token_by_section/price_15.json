    "main_text": "Building on Hume || Two Similarities and a Difference with Hume\n4.1 Two Similarities and a Difference with Hume\n\nPrice shares Hume\u2019s conception of two things. First, both hold\nthat (a) experience presents us, or acquaints us, with perceptions,\nimpressions, or sensibilia (ignoring Hume\u2019s scepticism about the\nself); and (b) our belief in an external world amounts to regarding\nthose presented sensibilia as the real external objects or as\nconstituents of external objects. In effect, both reject an\nunderstanding of our belief in an external world as a belief in\nobjects as causes of our perceptions, as lying behind them and not\npart of the world of experience. That is, they both reject the\ntwo-world model with a world of presented experience and another world\nof spatial external objects. However, recall, Price accepts that there\nare physical occupants distinct from sense-data or families of them\nwhich vertically cause our sense-data. Price gives no hint at how (i)\nhis own earlier positive, sense-data theory of perception relates to\n(ii) his engagement with Hume\u2019s theory (though Church [1943:\n317\u2013318] and Laing [1941: 317] make comparisons).\n\nTheir biggest difference concerns the \u201cvulgar\u201d belief that\npresented sense-data are persisting, external spatial objects.\nHume\u2019s whole theory can be described as an error theory. Price\nrejects Hume\u2019s arguments for this (e.g.,\n \u00a74.3\n below). The two resemblances, this difference, and his real\nadmiration for Hume guide Price\u2019s discussion.\n",
