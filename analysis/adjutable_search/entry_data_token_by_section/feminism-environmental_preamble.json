    "main_text": "\n Early positions of \u201cfeminist environmental philosophy\u201d\nfocused mostly on ethical perspectives on the interconnections among\nwomen, nonhuman animals, and nature (e.g., Carol Adams 1990; Deborah\nSlicer 1991). As it matured, references to feminist environmental\nphilosophy became what it is now\u2014an umbrella term for a variety\nof different, sometimes incompatible, philosophical perspectives on\ninterconnections among women of diverse races/ethnicities,\nsocioeconomic statuses, and geographic locations, on the one hand, and\nnonhuman animals and nature, on the other. For the purposes of this\nessay, \u201cfeminist environmental philosophy\u201d refers to this\ndiversity of positions on the interconnections among women, nonhuman\nanimals and nature within Western philosophy\u2014what will be\ncalled, simply, \u201cwomen-nature connections\u201d. Unless\nspecifically or separately identified, nonhuman animals are included\nin the concept of \u201cnature\u201d. (It is beyond the scope of\nthis essay to consider non-Western philosophical positions concerning\nthe environment.)\n",
