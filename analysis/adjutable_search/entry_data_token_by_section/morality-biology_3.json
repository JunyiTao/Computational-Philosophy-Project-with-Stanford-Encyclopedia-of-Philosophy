Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: Explaining Morality in the Empirical Sense\n\nEvolutionary explanations for morality in the empirical sense are\noffered at different levels, and this makes for very different\nexplanatory projects with different implications. Some typical\nexplananda in accounts of \u201cthe evolution of\nmorality\u201d are:\n\nThe general capacity for normative judgment and guidance, and the\ntendency to exercise this capacity in social life;\nThe capacity for certain sentiments and the ability to detect them\nin others;\nThe tendency to experience and to be motivated by certain\nsentiments in certain types of situation;\nThe tendency to make certain particular kinds of moral judgment or\ninference, or to have certain characteristic moral intuitions (i.e., a\n\u2018moral sense\u2019);\nThe tendency to exhibit certain particular types of behavior in\ncertain types of situation (as a result of D);\nThe tendency of societies to exhibit certain particular systems of\nnorms or types of practice (due to D and E).\n\n",
