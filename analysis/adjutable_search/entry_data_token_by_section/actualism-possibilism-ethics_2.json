    "main_text": "Historical Origins of the Debate || Replies and the Rise of the Actualism/Possibilism Debate\n1.3 Replies and the Rise of the Actualism/Possibilism Debate\n\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s short article spawned a number of replies\nwith various proposed solutions. Casta\u00f1eda himself argued that\nthe problem stemmed from the \u201conly if\u201d clause in\n (U)\n and concluded that it should be removed. However, he believed that,\neven once this clause has been removed, it remains an open question\nwhether utilitarianism could identify necessary conditions for\nobligatory actions (1968: 142).\n\nThe most numerous, and influential, replies were written by Lars\nBergstr\u00f6m, who argued that the contradiction arises only if it is\nassumed that \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are\nalternatives in the relevant sense. He argued that \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are not, in fact, alternatives\nsince they are compatible (Bergstr\u00f6m 1968b: 43). Notably, this is\nan issue of which Bergstr\u00f6m was clearly aware of in his (1966:\nch. 2) book in which he argued that \u201ctwo actions can reasonably\nbe regarded as alternatives (in the morally relevant sense) only if\nthey are incompatible or mutually exclusive\u201d. If, by hypothesis,\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\), then\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) must be compatible and\nso are not alternatives (1968b: 44). The subsequent literature\nconsisted of a back-and-forth between Bergstr\u00f6m and\nCasta\u00f1eda that primarily revolved around identifying the\nmorally relevant set of alternatives and Bergstr\u00f6m\u2019s\nattempts to formulate a utilitarian principle that avoids\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s objection (Bergstr\u00f6m 1968a,b, 1971,\n1973, 1976; Casta\u00f1eda 1968, 1969, 1972). As will be shown in\nthe subsequent sections, the issue of identifying the morally relevant\nset of alternatives forms the crux of the actualism/possibilism\ndebate.\n\nDag Prawitz (1970) and Fred Westphal (1972) both suggested revising\n (U)\n by indexing actions to the time they would need to be performed in\norder to bring about the uniquely optimific outcome. So, if performing\nthe joint act \\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) would\nresult in the greatest net amount of good, then S is obligated\nto perform \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) and to perform \\(\\langle B \\at\nt_2\\rangle\\) and, Westphal claims, this avoids the contradiction. At\n\\(t_1\\), \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) supposedly is the act that\nwould produce the greatest net amount of good in comparison to any\nother act performable at \\(t_1\\). At \\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\)\nsupposedly is the act that would produce the greatest net\namount of good in comparison to any other act performable at \\(t_2\\).\nFinally, from among the performable act-sets that might occur from\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is the\nact-set that would produce the greatest net amount of good. Thus, each\nact is the uniquely optimific act at the time it is performed, or so\nWestphal claims. Notably, Prawitz (1968, 1970) and Westphal (1972)\neach argue that an act is permissible if and only if it is part of an\nact-set that, if performed, would bring about the greatest net good of\nany of the acts available to the agent. In making this argument,\nPrawitz and Westphal were giving what may be considered the earliest\ndefenses of possibilism. However, they did not yet refer to this view\nas possibilism. \n\nWhile possibilism itself remains a viable view in the literature,\nHarold Zellner demonstrated that Prawitz\u2019s and Westphal\u2019s\nresponses did not solve the specific problem Casta\u00f1eda\nidentified for utilitarianism. This is because, while performing\n\\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) may be uniquely\noptimific, it does not follow that performing either of these\nindividual acts at their respective times would be uniquely optimific.\nFor instance, performing \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) may not be\nuniquely optimific if the agent would not perform \\(\\langle B\n\\at t_2\\rangle\\)if she first performs \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\).\nZellner (1972: 125)\nillustrates this with the following case. \n\nTeach, Play Cupid, or Skip Class: Suppose that\nthe best act-set Tom can perform is \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\),\nwhere \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) = commute to campus and \\(\\langle\nB\\rangle\\) = teach his classes. Tom can also \\(\\langle C\\rangle\\),\nwhere \\(\\langle C\\rangle\\) = play Cupid by loaning his car to two\npeople so they can go on a date. Finally, suppose that if Tom were to\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) commute to campus, he would\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) skip teaching class. This is the worst\nact-set Tom can perform.\n\n\nAgain, it would be best if Tom \u27e8commutes to campus &\nteaches\u27e9, second best if he \u27e8plays Cupid\u27e9, and\nworst if he \u27e8commutes to campus & skips class\u27e9.\nThus, the value of the act-sets may be ranked from best to worst as\nfollows.\n\n \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\)\n\\(\\langle C\\rangle\\)\n \\(\\langle A \\lamp {\\sim}B\\rangle\\)\n\n\nZellner points out that, since Tom would \\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) if\nhe were to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\), the value of performing \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) is not uniquely optimific even though the value of\nperforming \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is uniquely optimific. Thus,\nin such cases,\n (U)\n combined with\n (ODC)\n still generates contradictions, even if each act is indexed to their\nrespective times. Zellner argued that, to solve the problem, (U)\nshould be rejected because it is inconsistent with a supposedly basic\nprinciple of inference, referred to as (NI), which holds that if an\nagent is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\), then\nshe is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) (1972: 125). This\nrule is sometimes referred to as Normative Inheritance or as\nPermissibility is Closed Under Implication. It may be\nrepresented more formally in the Standard Deontic Logic system as\n(Feldman 1986: 41):\n\n(NI)\nIf \\({\\vdash} A \\rightarrow B\\) then \\({\\vdash} O(A) \\rightarrow O(B)\\)\n\n\nThis literature on the coherence of utilitarianism directly gave rise\nto the actualism/possibilism literature. Most importantly, (i) it made\nsalient the importance of determining the relevant act-alternatives\navailable to the agent and (ii) cases such as Teach, Play\nCupid, or Skip Class raised questions about the\nrelationship between an agent\u2019s free actions and her moral\nobligations. As will be illustrated in the next section, actualists\nand possibilists are divided over cases with this exact structure.\n",
