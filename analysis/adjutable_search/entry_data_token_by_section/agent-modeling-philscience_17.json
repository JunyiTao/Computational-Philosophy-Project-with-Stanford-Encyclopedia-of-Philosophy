To get a more precise grip on\nhow individual incentives shape epistemic coordination and theoretical\ndiversity, philosophers introduced formal analytical models, inspired\nby research in economics. One of the central results from this body of\nliterature is that the optimal distribution of labor can be achieved\nwhen scientists act according to their self-interest rather than\nfollowing epistemic ends (e.g., Kitcher 1990; Brock & Durlauf\n1999; Strevens 2003). More precisely, the models show that if we\nassume scientists aim at maximizing rewards from making discoveries,\nthey will succeed to optimally distribute their research efforts if\nthey take into account the probability of success of each research\nline and how many other scientists currently pursue it. Assuming that\nall scientists evaluate theories in the same way, their interest in\nfame and fortune, rather than epistemic goals alone, will lead some of\nthem to select avenues that initially appear less\n promising.[7]\n\n\nABMs were introduced to address similar questions, but assuming more\ncomplex scenarios. For example, Muldoon and Weisberg (2011) developed\nan epistemic landscape model (see\n Section 3.1)\n to examine the robustness of Kitcher\u2019s and Strevens\u2019\nresults under the assumption that scientists have varying access to\ninformation about the pursued research projects in their community and\nthe future success of those projects. Their results indicate that once\nscientists have limited information about what others are working on,\nor about the degree to which projects are likely to succeed, their\nself-organized division of labor fails to be optimal. Another example\nis the model by De Langhe & Greiff (2010) who generalize\nKitcher\u2019s model to a situation with multiple epistemic standards\ndetermining the background assumptions of scientists, acceptable\nmethods, acceptable puzzles, and so on. The simulations show that once\nscientific practice is modeled as based on multiple standards, the\nincentive to compete fails to provide an optimal division of labor.\n\n\nA closely related question concerns the \u201cpriority\nrule\u201d\u2014a norm that allocates credit for a scientific\ndiscovery to the first one to make it (Strevens 2003, 2011)\u2014and\nits impact on the division of labor. While Kitcher\u2019s and\nStrevens\u2019s models suggested that the priority rule incentivizes\nthe optimal distribution of scientists across rival research programs,\na range of formal models, including ABMs, were developed to reexamine\nthese results and shed additional light on this norm. For instance,\nRubin and Schneider (2021) examine what happens if credit is assigned\nby individuals, rather than by the scientific community as a whole, as\nin Strevens\u2019 model. They further suppose that news about\nsimultaneous discoveries by two scientists spreads through a networked\ncommunity. The simulations show that more connected scientists are\nmore likely to gain credit than the less connected ones, which may, on\nthe one hand, disadvantage minority members in the community, and on\nthe other hand, undermine the role of the priority rule as an\nincentive resulting in the optimal division of labor. Besides the\nquestion of how the priority rule impacts the division of labor, ABMs\nhave also been used to study other effects of the priority rule. For\nexample, Tiokhin, Yan, and Morgan (2021) develop an evolutionary ABM\nshowing that the priority rule leads the scientific community to\nevolve towards research based on smaller sample sizes, which in turn\nreduces the reliability of published findings.\n\nThe impact of incentives on the division of labor in science has also\nbeen analyzed in terms of incentives to \u201cexploit\u201d existing\nprojects in contrast to incentives to \u201cexplore\u201d novel\nideas. For instance, De Langhe (2014b) developed a generalized version\nof Kitcher and Strevens\u2019 model in which agents achieve the\noptimal division of labor by weighing up relative costs and benefits\nof exploiting available theories and exploring new ones. Within the\nframework of bandit models and network epistemology (see\n Section 3.2),\n Kummerfeld and Zollman (2016) proposed an ABM that examines a\nscenario in which scientists face two rival hypotheses, one of which\nis better though the agents don\u2019t know which one. While agents\nalways choose to pursue (or exploit) a hypothesis that seems more\npromising, they may also occasionally research (and thereby explore)\nthe alternative one. The simulations show that if the community is\nleft to be self-organized in the sense that each scientist explores to\nthe extent that they consider individually optimal, agents will be\nincentivized to leave exploration to others. As a result, scientists\nwill fail to develop a sufficiently high incentive for exploring novel\nideas, that is, an incentive which would be optimal from the\nperspective of their community at large.\n",
