    "main_text": "Reception and influence\n7. Reception and influence\n\n\nWe can distinguish between the influence of Crescas on Jewish\nphilosophy and his influence on general occidental philosophy.\n\n\nJewish philosophy: As has been pointed out, Crescas was considered\nthe major leader of the Jewish community of Aragon and to a certain\nextent all of Spanish Jewry (It should be noted that at the time, the\nSpanish Jewish community was the biggest in the Jewish world.). He was\nboth the most important political leader and one of the major legal\nauthorities of his time. A significant proportion of the major rabbis\nin Aragon in the generation following Crescas were in fact his\nimmediate pupils or people within his circle of\n scholars.[31]\nCrescas was also one of the most\noriginal Jewish philosophers in the Middle Ages. His critiques of\nAristotelian science and of the Maimonidean integration of\nAristotelianism into Judaism have an honored place in the history of\nthe disintegration of the influence of Aristotle \u2013 a\ndisintegration that laid the groundwork for the development of a new\nscience. These kinds of critiques were very popular in the Renaissance\nand at the beginning of the modern period. Additionally, in the\nmajority of the subjects that Crescas deals with, his opinion is closer\nto the traditional point of view than is Maimonides\u2019 opinion. But\ncontrary to what we might have expected from this situation, Crescas\ndid not create an important Jewish current of thought as did Maimonides\nand the Kabbala. The majority of his direct students and of the people\nin his circle came back to either a different kind of Aristotelian view\nor else a regular traditional point of view, and did not continue\nCrescas\u2019s philosophical project.\n\n\nModern scholars have given a number of explanations for this\nphenomenon, most prominent of which is the disintegration of Spanish\nJewry caused by the pogrom of 1391 and the persecutions at the\nbeginning of the 15th century. Because of this\ndisintegration, the Spanish Jewish community did not integrate the new\nand original mode of thinking of Crescas, and instead went back after\nhis death to different more traditional opinions. Another explanation\nis that his opinions were ahead of their time, and people (including\nhis own pupils) did not completely understand them. Another explanation\nattributes the general rejection of Crescas to his citation of\nChristian scholars, and especially the apostate Abner of Burgos.\nAccording to this opinion, the Jewish community knew Abner\u2019s\nideas and was dismayed by Crescas\u2019s utilization of the\napostate\u2019s\n views.[32]\n Some scholars also claim that the major goal of Crescas was to refute the\nAristotelian interpretation of Judaism, so following the collapse of\nthis interpretation, caused by the general fall of Aristotle, there was\nsimply no more need for Crescas\u2019s critiques. Perhaps the most\nprobable explanation is that Crescas did not realize his original\nproject of writing another legalistic book against the Mishneh\nTorah of Maimonides. If Crescas had written this book, he probably\nwould have become not only one of the major Jewish philosophers, but\nalso one of the major legal authorities of both his generation and\nsucceeding generations. The combination of legal works, philosophical\ntracts, and political leadership was undoubtedly of great help to the\nphilosophical reception of Maimonides within Judaism.\n\n\nYet another reason for the relative lack of influence of Crescas on\nposterior Judaism is his intermediate position between philosophy and\ntradition. Maimonides was not only the most important Jewish\nphilosopher, but also the Jewish philosopher par excellence, such that\nthe majority of orthodox Jewish philosophers see themselves as\ncontinuators of Maimonides. For the majority of Jewish philosophers,\nCrescas is too traditional, while for the majority of traditionalists\nhe is too philosophical. Ultimately, however, and in spite of all the\naforementioned factors, the influence of Crescas on Jewish thought is\npalpable. Or Hashem is found today in a large\nmajority of the libraries of the different yeshivot (Jewish\nacademies), and rabbis from all the different streams of Judaism have\nstudied his book throughout the modern period. In universities and the\nresearch world there is a relatively large amount of interest in his\noriginal philosophy, and a substantial number of scholars of medieval\nJewish philosophy consider Crescas to be the second most important\nmedieval Jewish philosopher after Maimonides.\n",
