    "main_text": "\n\nIn Japan, Confucianism stands, along with Buddhism, as a major\nreligio-philosophical teaching introduced from the larger Asian\ncultural arena at the dawn of civilization in Japanese history,\nroughly the mid-sixth century. Unlike Buddhism which ultimately hailed\nfrom India, Confucianism was first and foremost a distinctly Chinese\nteaching. It spread, however, from Han dynasty China, into Korea, and\nthen later entered Japan via, for the most part, the Korean peninsula.\nIn significant respects, then, Confucianism defines much of the East\nAsian identity of Japan, especially in relation to philosophical\nthought and practice.\n\nWhile there is a religious dimension to Confucianism, its\nteachings \u2013 ethical, epistemological, metaphysical, political, and\naesthetic \u2013 are typically understood in relation to the\nsocio-political world of humanity, beginning with the individual and\nhis/her pursuit of moral and intellectual perfection, the family and\nits pursuit of harmony and order, and the polity and its pursuit of\npeace and prosperity throughout all below heaven, i.e., the world at\nlarge. In this respect, Confucianism was the secular philosophy\noperative in the ordinary world of everyday existence, at one level or\nanother, throughout Japanese history, well into modern times. As often\nas not, however, its teachings have become so\nthoroughly integrated into Japanese culture without being\nexplicitly identified as \u201cConfucian\u201d that many have\nnaively assumed them simply generic to the Japanese mind and its\nmyriad expressions in history and culture.\n\nViewed as a religio-philosophical teaching, Confucianism brims with\nhigh-minded ideals that have always challenged humanity to realize the\nhighest state of ethical perfection and self-realization. However, as\na political doctrine appropriated by the ruling elite to provide a\nmodicum of legitimization for coercive rule, Confucianism was often\nvoiced in cynical if not self-serving ways, belying the very ideals to\nwhich little more than lip-service was otherwise given. However, from\nthe beginnings of political unity in Japan as provided by the nascent\nimperial system and then later by various shogunal regimes, Confucian\nthinking informed the ethics and socio-political ideals of the polity,\nand not infrequently imperial names and reign names, thus defining the\nparameters of real world discourse about the governed, those\ngoverning, and the nature and purpose of government. In modern times,\never resilient Confucian notions have provided conceptual foundations\nfor integrating much of western thinking about self, society, the\nfamily, and the polity, thus helping to mediate Japan\u2019s advance,\nphilosophically, toward a more global understanding of civilization\nand modernity.\n\nHere, rather than trace the historical vicissitudes of Confucianism in\nJapanese culture, or explore the thinking of individual scholars,\nConfucianism will be approached as a systematic conceptual discourse\ndefining the contours, philosophically, of much that was said and\nthought about the everyday world of common sense reality. In\nparticular, the focus is on Confucian thinking about language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, the mind, political theory,\neducation, spirituality, and the environment. In this way, the\nfoundations of Confucianism as intellectual discourse are hopefully\nlaid bare.\n",
