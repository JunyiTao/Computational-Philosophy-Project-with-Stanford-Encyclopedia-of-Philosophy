    "main_text": "14th Century Theories of Consequence || The emergence of treatises on consequence in the 14th century\n3.1 The emergence of treatises on consequence in the 14th century\n\nThe precise historical origins of 14th century theories of\nconsequence are still debated among scholars. What we know is that, at\nthe beginning of the 14th century, treatises and chapters\nbearing the title De consequentiis and similar titles began\nto appear. Why then, and not before? Naturally, the subject itself,\nthat is, the logical/inferential relations between sentences, had been\nextensively discussed by earlier authors, as we have seen. But no\ntreatises or chapters were specifically dedicated to the topic or bore\nsuch titles before the 14th century.\n\nAccording to a once influential hypothesis, medieval theories of\nconsequences would have emerged from the tradition commenting on and\ndiscussing Aristotle\u2019s Topics (Bird 1961; Stump 1982). At\nfirst sight, this hypothesis may seem plausible: traditionally, the\nrole of the topical framework was often to account for the patterns of\n(correct) inference and reasoning which did not fit into the\nsyllogistic system presented in the Prior Analytics. So,\nconceptually, it would seem quite natural that the tradition on the\nTopics might represent the historical origins of theories of\nconsequences. Moreover, as we have seen, most earlier discussions of\nthe notion of consequence (e.g. Abelard) were conducted explicitly\nwithin the context of the topical framework, following Boethius.\n\nHowever, on closer scrutiny, this hypothesis fails to receive\nhistorical and textual confirmation. (Green-Pedersen 1984, chapter E\nin particular) is (still) the most comprehensive study on this\nsubject, covering virtually every text known to us that is relevant\nfor the hypothesis. Green-Pedersen argues (1984, 270) that the late\n13th century literature on the Topics, that is, the period\nimmediately preceding the emergence of treatises on consequences,\ngives absolutely no indication of what was to come. In other words,\nthere are no significant similarities between the contents of these\n13th century treatises on the Topics and the\n14th century treatises on consequences. Therefore, we may\nconclude that the Topics could not have been the main, and in any case\ncertainly not the only, source for the emergence of 14th\ncentury theories of consequences.\n\nBe that as it may, the importance of the Topics for the development of\n14th century theories of consequences should not be altogether\ndismissed. It is worth noticing that two of the first\nauthors who presented systematic discussions of consequence in the\n14th century, namely Ockham and Burley, are both in some\nway or another influenced by the Topics. Burley explicitly says that\nall valid consequences are based on dialectical topics (On the\npurity, p. 158 and 162). In contrast, the relation of Ockham\u2019s\ntheory of consequence to the topical framework is more convoluted; Green-Pedersen\nargues convincingly that Bird\u2019s reconstruction of Ockham\u2019s theory\nwithin the topical framework (Bird 1961) is not satisfactory\n(Green-Pedersen 1984, 268), but he also confirms that Ockham\u2019s\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018extrinsic\u2019 middles, crucial\nconcepts for his theory of consequence (to be explained shortly), are\nconcepts essentially taken (albeit in modified form) from the topical\nframework.\n\nIn short, although the current availability of texts still does not\nallow for definitive conclusions to be drawn, the picture that at this point seems\nmost plausible is that different strands of traditional logical\ntheories converged in order to give rise to the 14th\ncentury theories of consequences. It seems that at least four\ntraditions contributed substantially to these developments: treatises\non syncategoremata, especially in connection with the\nsyncategorema \u2018si\u2019; discussions of hypothetical\nsyllogisms; commentaries on the Prior Analytics; and the\ntradition of the Topics. Different elements of each of these\ntraditions contributed to the development of different aspects of the\ntheories of\n consequence.[7]\n Green-Pedersen (1984, 295) argues, for example, that the late\n13th-century treatises that most resemble early\n14th-century treatises on consequences are \u201cthe\ntreatises on syncategorematic words and a number of\nsophism-collections arranged after syncategoremes.\u201d\n\nThe different 14th century treatises on consequences can be\ndivided into four main groups:\n\nThe treatises on consequences from the very beginning of the\n14th century: Burley\u2019s De consequentiis and two\nanonymous treatises of roughly the same time (Green-Pedersen 1981).\nThey are in fact rather unsystematic collections of rules of\nconsequence/inference; it seems that their purpose was solely to\nprovide \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 to deal with sophismata related\nto some syncategorematic terms. No conceptual or systematic discussion\nof the nature of consequence is presented.\nThe second group is represented by Burley\u2019s De Puritate,\nthe chapters on consequence in Ockham\u2019s Summa Logicae\n(III-3), a few Pseudo-Ockham treatises, and the Liber\nconsequentiarium (edited in Schupp 1988). In these texts, the\nconcept of (intrinsic and extrinsic) middles and other topical\nconcepts occupy a prominent place. They display a much deeper interest\nin the very nature of consequence than the previous group, presenting\ngeneral definitions and criteria for what is to count as a\nconsequence, as well as divisions of kinds of consequence.\nThe third group is represented by Buridan\u2019s treatise on\nconsequence and the treatises inspired by it, most notably Albert of\nSaxony\u2019s (a chapter of his Perutilis logica) and Marsilius of\nInghen\u2019s treatise on consequence (Ciola 2018). There is also the\ninteresting commentary on the Prior Analytics formerly\nattributed to\n Scotus,[8]\n which is thought to have been composed before or in any case\nindependently of Buridan\u2019s treatise (Lagerlund 2000, chapter 6). In\nthese treatises, topical vestiges such as the doctrine of intrinsic\nand extrinsic middles have disappeared completely. What characterizes\nthem as a group is the definition of formal consequence based on the\nsubstitutivity criterion, in the spirit of (ST) (more on this below).\nThis tradition is usually referred to as the Parisian/continental\ntradition on consequences.\nThe fourth group of treatises is predominantly British, and is\nrepresented by a significantly greater number of surviving treatises\nthan group (3). It is represented by the treatises by Robert Fland,\nJohn of Holland, Richard Billingham, Richard Lavenham, Ralph Strode,\nand the Logica Oxoniensis, among others (Ashworth and Spade\n1992). What characterizes this group as such is the definition of\nformal consequence in terms of containment of the consequent in the\nantecedent, in the spirit of (Co), usually interpreted in epistemic\nterms.\n\n\nChronologically, the development of theories of consequence in the\n14th century is thus characterized by an early and rather\n\u2018primitive\u2019 stage (1), then by a stage of further\ndevelopment, in which, nevertheless, topical notions still play a\nprominent role (2), and then by two further traditions which run more\nor less parallel, namely the Parisian/continental tradition (3) and\nthe British tradition (4). While they differed in particular in the\nvarious definitions given to the formal vs. material consequence\ndistinction, they all agreed that necessary truth-preservation (TP) is\na necessary (but perhaps not sufficient) condition for something to count as a (valid) consequence\n(Dutilh Novaes 2008).\n\nBefore moving on, it is important to note that, in the 14th century, rules of\nconsequence were often discussed against the background of the genre\nof oral disputation known as obligationes (see entry on\nobligationes of this encyclopedia). It is common to encounter\nformulations of rules of consequence in obligational terms, for\nexample: if you have conceded the consequence and its antecedent, then\nyou must concede the consequent. Thus, interesting reflections on\nconsequence are also to be found in obligationes treatises\n(and vice-versa).\n",
