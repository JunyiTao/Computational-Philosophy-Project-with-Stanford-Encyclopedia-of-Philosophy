I.1.5. Such rulers govern in accordance\nwith the laws concerning the establishment of their office, their\nappointment and their responsibilities. When power is, by contrast,\n\u201cplenary\u201d, the government is said to be\n\u201cregal\u201d in kind. But even regal government, in its proper\nforms, is the government of free and equal people who have in some\nsense (never made quite clear by Aquinas) the \u201cright to resist\n[ius repugnandi]\u201d the ruler(s). Even regal rulers are\nsubject to the directive force of the laws, though there is no-one who\nhas the legal authority to coerce them.\n\nAquinas sees no need for any \u201csocial contract\u201d to explain\nor justify the origins of government or of any particular regime. But\nhe does think that, even in regal as distinct from political rule, the\nenacted laws constitute \u201ca kind of covenant [pactum]\nbetween king and people\u201d (In Rom. 13.1 v. 6), and\nviolation of this by the ruler can entail that subjects are released\nfrom their covenantal obligation.\n\nIn principle, Aquinas thinks, the supreme legislative powers are held\neither by the whole people [tota multitudo], a free people\n[libera multitudo], or by some public persona who\nhas responsibility [cura] for them and represents them\n[gerit personam multitudinis: bears their persona]: I-II q.\n97 a. 3 ad 3; II-II q. 57 a. 2. Neither the meaning of this\n\u201crepresentation\u201d nor the practicalities of designating a\nrepresentative are explored in any depth by Aquinas. Nor does he\ndiscuss how it gets settled whether a particular people is (i) simply\nfree and self-governing, or (ii) free but subject to the legislative\nauthority of some princeps, or (iii) unfree (perhaps because\nconquered).\n",
