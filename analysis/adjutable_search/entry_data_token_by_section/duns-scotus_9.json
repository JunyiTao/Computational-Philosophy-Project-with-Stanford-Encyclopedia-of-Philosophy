    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Intuitive cognition\n4.2 Intuitive cognition\n\nScotus understands intuitive cognition by way of contrast with\nabstractive cognition. The latter, as we have seen, involves the\nuniversal; and a universal as such need not be exemplified. That is,\nmy intelligible species of dog only tells me what it is to be a dog;\nit doesn\u2019t tell me whether any particular dog actually exists.\nIntuitive cognition, by contrast, \u201cyields information about how\nthings are right now\u201d (Pasnau [2002]). Sensory cognition, as\nScotus explicitly acknowledges, counts as intuitive cognition on this\naccount. It is, after all, quite uncontroversial that my seeing or\nhearing a dog gives me information about some particular dog as it\nexists when I see or hear it. Scotus\u2019s much bolder claim\nconcerns intellectual intuitive cognition, by which the\nintellect cognizes a particular thing as existing at that very moment.\nIntellectual intuitive cognition does not require phantasms; nor does\nit involve intelligible species (which, like phantasms, are\nabstractive).\n\nIntellectual intuitive cognition has two different kinds of objects:\nextramental sensible objects and the soul\u2019s own acts. (Scotus\ncomes around to affirming the possibility of such cognition of\nextramental objects in his later works, having denied it earlier in\nhis career; he is consistent about the possibility of intuitive\ncognition of the soul\u2019s acts. See Cross 2014, 43\u201364, on\nwhom I draw thoughout this section.) We must have intuitive cognition\nof extramental objects because we can cognize them intellectually\nas existing; we can form propositions about them and use such\npropositions in syllogisms. So, for example, if I form the proposition\n\u201cThis flower is red,\u201d the contents of that proposition\nmust be in the intellect, not merely in the sense. This is\nintellectual cognition because it is conceptual; it is\nintuitive cognition because it concerns something as\nexisting. The information contained in the sensible\nspecies\u2014the shape and color of the flower\u2014is \"promoted\" by\nthe agent intellect from material existence in an organ to immaterial\nexistence in the non-organic intellect, so that it is available for\nintellectual cognition. The role of sensible species in intuitive\nintellectual cognition explains why Scotus denies that we can have\nsuch cognition of non-sensible objects, such as angels, in this\nlife.\n\nWe also have intuitive cognition of our mental acts. (As I discuss in\nthe next section, Scotus attaches considerable importance to our\nintuitive self-knowledge). Abstractive cognition could provide me with\nan abstract concept of thinking about Scotus, for example,\nbut I need intuitive cognition to know that I am in fact exemplifying\nthat concept right this minute. This kind of intuitive cognition\nclearly dispenses even with sensible species, since the\nintellect\u2019s acts, like the intellect itself, are immaterial and\ntherefore not the sorts of things that can be sensed.\n",
