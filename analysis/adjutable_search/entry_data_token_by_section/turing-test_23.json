    "main_text": "Alternative Tests || The Turing Test is Too Narrow\n5.2 The Turing Test is Too Narrow\n\nThere are authors who have suggested that The Turing Test does not set\na sufficiently broad goal for research in the area of artificial\nintelligence. Amongst these authors, there are many who suppose that\nThe Turing Test is too easy. (We go on to consider some of these\nauthors in the next sub-section.) But there are also some authors who\nhave supposed that, even if the goal that is set by The Turing Test is\nvery demanding indeed, it is nonetheless too restrictive.\n\nObjection to the notion that the Turing Test provides a logically\nsufficient condition for intelligence can be adapted to the goal of\nshowing that the Turing Test is too restrictive. Consider, for\nexample, Gunderson (1964). Gunderson has two major complaints to make\nagainst The Turing Test. First, he thinks that success in\nTuring\u2019s Imitation Game might come for reasons other than the\npossession of intelligence. But, second, he thinks that success in the\nImitation Game would be but one example of the kinds of things that\nintelligent beings can do and\u2014hence\u2014in itself could not be\ntaken as a reliable indicator of intelligence. By way of analogy,\nGunderson offers the case of a vacuum cleaner salesman who claims that\nhis product is \u201call-purpose\u201d when, in fact, all it does is\nto suck up dust. According to Gunderson, Turing is in the same\nposition as the vacuum cleaner salesman if he is prepared to\nsay that a machine is intelligent merely on the basis of its success\nin the Imitation Game. Just as \u201call purpose\u201d entails the\nability to do a range of things, so, too, \u201cthinking\u201d\nentails the possession of a range of abilities (beyond the mere\nability to succeed in the Imitation Game).\n\nThere is an obvious reply to the argument that we have here attributed\nto Gunderson, viz. that a machine that is capable of success in the\nImitation Game is capable of doing a large range of different kinds of\nthings. In order to carry out a conversation, one needs to have many\ndifferent kinds of cognitive skills, each of which is capable of\napplication in other areas. Apart from the obvious general cognitive\ncompetencies\u2014memory, perception, etc.\u2014there are many\nparticular competencies\u2014rudimentary arithmetic abilities,\nunderstanding of the rules of games, rudimentary understanding of\nnational politics, etc.\u2014which are tested in the course of\nrepeated runs of the Imitation Game. It is inconceivable that that\nthere be a machine that is startlingly good at playing the Imitation\nGame, and yet unable to do well at any other tasks that might\nbe assigned to it; and it is equally inconceivable that there is a\nmachine that is startlingly good at the Imitation Game and yet that\ndoes not have a wide range of competencies that can be displayed in a\nrange of quite disparate areas. To the extent that Gunderson considers\nthis line of reply, all that he says is that there is no reason to\nthink that a machine that can succeed in the Imitation Game\nmust have more than a narrow range of abilities; we think\nthat there is no reason to believe that this reply should be taken\nseriously.\n\nMore recently, Erion (2001) has defended a position that has some\naffinity to that of Gunderson. According to Erion, machines might be\n\u201ccapable of outperforming human beings in limited tasks in\nspecific environments, [and yet] still be unable to act skillfully in\nthe diverse range of situations that a person with common sense\ncan\u201d (36). On one way of understanding the claim that Erion\nmakes, he too believes that The Turing Test only identifies one\namongst a range of independent competencies that are possessed by\nintelligent human beings, and it is for this reason that he proposes a\nmore comprehensive \u201cCartesian Test\u201d that \u201cinvolves a\nmore careful examination of a creature\u2019s language, [and] also\ntests the creature\u2019s ability to solve problems in a wide variety\nof everyday circumstances\u201d (37). In our view, at least when The\nTuring Test is properly understood, it is clear that anything that\npasses The Turing Test must have the ability to solve problems in a\nwide variety of everyday circumstances (because the interrogators will\nuse their questions to probe these\u2014and other\u2014kinds of\nabilities in those who play the Imitation Game).\n",
