    "main_text": "\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n\nPeople should not be allowed to starve.\n\nNo one should be denied access to a decent minimum of health-care.\n\nEvery citizen should be able to meet their basic needs.\n\n\nThese statements all express a widespread view that a political\ncommunity should seek to ensure that its members are all able to enjoy\nat least a minimally decent standard of living. They assert the\nimportance of what is often called the social minimum.\nHowever, the exact nature of the social minimum, the considerations\nthat support it, and even its basic justifiability, are all matters of\nphilosophical controversy. The aim here is to provide a guide through\nthe terrain of these controversies. This is done in three stages.\n\nFirstly, in section\n 1,\n we look more closely at the question, \u201cWhat is a social\nminimum?\u201d This section introduces a number of basic distinctions\nthat will serve to clarify the discussion. We define a \u201csocial\nminimum\u201d as that bundle of resources which suffices in the\ncircumstances of a society to enable someone to lead a minimally\ndecent life. We define a \u201csocial minimum policy regime\u201d as\na set of policies and institutions that serve to secure reasonable\naccess to this social minimum for all members of the society. As part\nof the task of clarification in this section, we review some of the\nmain philosophical issues posed by these definitions. In particular,\nhow are we to understand the notion of a \u201cminimally decent\nlife\u201d?\n\nIn section\n 2,\n we then consider the question, \u201cWhy a social minimum?\u201d\nSpecifically, we outline a range of influential theories of social\njustice, and we consider in each case whether and how the theory in\nquestion might lend support to the enactment of a social minimum (that\nis, to the establishment of a social minimum policy regime). The\ntheories considered include utilitarianism, libertarianism,\nleft-libertarianism, egalitarian liberalism, and relational\negalitarianism.\n\nIn section\n 3,\n we then turn to the critics of enactment, posing the question\n\u201cWhat can be said against enactment of a social minimum?\u201d\nWe consider three sets of objections that appeal respectively to the\nvalues of individual freedom, fairness, and legitimacy. Although the\nobjections do not seem to refute the case for enacting a social\nminimum, some are helpful in thinking about the form the social\nminimum should take and about the political procedures surrounding its\nenactment. Section\n 4\n offers a brief conclusion to our discussion.\n",
