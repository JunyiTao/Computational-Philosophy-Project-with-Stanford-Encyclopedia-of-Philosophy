    "main_text": "Epistemological Issues || Mechanism and Experimentalism\n4.3 Mechanism and Experimentalism\n\nAccording to Lenoble (1943), Mersenne\u2019s mature works, focusing\nalmost exclusively on \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences,\nwitnesses the \u201cbirth of mechanism\u201d. However, as the term\nis not an actor\u2019s category of the 17th century, one should be\ncareful in its use. Formulated in its own terms, Mersenne\u2019s\nstandpoint regarding explanations in physics is that we can only\nunderstand what we can do:\n\n\nwe only know the real reasons for things that we can create with our\nhand and our mind; \u2026 and of all the things made by God, we\ncannot create any, no matter how much subtlety and effort we apply.\n(NO: 8; Lenoble 1943: 384)\n\n\nThis indicates both the foundations and limits of mechanistic\nexplanations: finding reasons means showing how things can he produced\nby mechanical actions\u2014actions of the kind we are capable of when\napplying our bodies to external bodies. On the one hand, however, this\nmode of genetic explanation can provide only a very superficial\nclarification of created things, whose construction and complexity are\neither infinite, or go to details and minutiae that our senses are\nincapable of perceiving (OC: 89). On the other hand, these\nexplanations cannot bear the character of necessity since they focus\non objects that are fundamentally contingent and whose inner machinery\ncould have been constituted differently, had God so wanted:\n\n\none knows all but nothing in physics, if one follows the definition of\nscience Aristotle gave; for if it ought to be about eternal and\nimmutable objects, and God can change everything that is in physics,\none cannot make a science of it. (QT: 9)\n\n\nThe conjoined effects of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological pessimism\nand metaphysical voluntarism make his version of\n\u201cmechanism\u201d very different from the Cartesian, Hobbesian\nor Gassendist one. He never conceived mechanical explanations as a new\nscience of \u201ccauses\u201d, based on the adoption of new\nprinciples and elements intended to take the place of Aristotelian\nsubstantial forms\u2014such as Descartes\u2019s subtle matter or\nGassendi\u2019s atoms. Mechanics, as all other mixed-mathematics, was\nsimply concerned with establishing the laws of phenomena.\n\nThis reflection on nature and the limits of mechanistic science was\naccompanied by truly experimental activity. Mersenne was convinced\nthat mathematical sciences of nature cannot settle for common and\nvague observation. It urgently required \u201cwell-controlled and\nwell-performed experiments\u201d (HU I: 167), facts that were\nartificially generated and precisely measured. Mersenne was aware\nthat, even when rigorously performed, an experiment is not always\nenough to establish the law of phenomena: two series of experiments\ncan diverge very little and yet express very different laws.\nMeasurement can only be approximated, and this has a bearing on the\ncertainty of mixed mathematics, which is partially compromised to the\nextent that it deals with physical objects. Reason must therefore, as\nfar as possible, always accompany and discipline observation, without\nwhich one is vulnerable to considerable misunderstandings.\n\nMersenne made a considerable effort to do and redo experiments that\nhis predecessors (most notably Galileo) had not always had the sense\nto present precisely. Thus, on the subject of the increase in speed\nduring falling motion on an inclined plane, he conducted a precise\ncampaign of measurements that enabled him to criticize Galileo\u2019s\nnumerical results, and eventually express doubts on the validity of\nthe law itself (Palmerini 2010). As usual, he expressed his\nreservations concerning our capacity to determine with certainty the\ncauses of gravity: \u201cit is just as difficult to find the real\ncause as to demonstrate whether the earth is stable or mobile\u201d\n(Trait\u00e9 des mouvements) and he placed back-to-back the\nreasons put forward by his contemporaries\u2014positive and real\nquality, air pressure, magnetic attraction\u2014which could only\npartially account for the phenomenon in its precise numerical\ndimensions. As Peter Dear has shown, Mersenne\u2019s approach to the\nscience of motion was inductive in nature, not centered, as it was in\nGalileo, on the abstract physical process, but rather on \u201ca\ngeneralized description of cases, whose details and precise parameters\nheld an importance altogether lacking in Galileo\u201d (Dear\n1994).\n",
