DS, which is valid in classical\nlogic, but also in intuitionistic logic and in the multi-valued logics\ndiscussed in the previous section (with the exception of PL), has\nhowever been rejected in relevance logics (Anderson and Belnap 1962,\n1975). Relevance logics are non-classical logical systems developed to\navoid the paradoxes of material and strict implication (see the entry\non\n relevance logic).\n These are classically valid principles, like \\(p \\to (q \\vee \\neg\nq)\\), which however strike us as counterintuitive. This is so because,\naccording to the relevantist, they involve a fallacy of relevance: in\nthese cases the antecedent is typically irrelevant to the consequent.\nBelnap\u2019s formal criteria of relevance (also known as variable\nsharing principle) is that in any provable implication, the antecedent\nand the consequent should share at least one propositional variable, and that no\ninference can be shown valid if the premises and conclusion do not\nshare at least one propositional variable.\n\nHistorically, relevance logic rejected DS because of the role it plays\nin C.I. Lewis \u201cindependent\u201d proof of the fact that an\nimpossible proposition \\((A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) can lead to any\nproposition whatsoever, which is one of the paradoxes of strict\nimplication:\n\n\n1.\n \\((A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) \n [assumption]\n\n2.\n\\( A\\) \n [from 1, by \\(E_{\\wedge}\\)]\n\n3.\n \\(\\neg A\\) \n [from 1, by \\(E_{\\wedge}\\)]\n\n4.\n \\((A \\vee B)\\) \n[from 2, by \\(I_{\\vee}\\), or addition]\n\n5.\n \\(B\\) \n [from 3,4 by disjunctive syllogism]\n\n\nAccording to Anderson and Belnap \u201cthe inference from \\(\\neg A\\)\nand \\(A\\vee B\\) to \\(B\\) is an error: [\u2026] a fallacy of\nrelevance\u201d (Anderson and Belnap 1962: 19). Formally, the\ninference is rejected because according to Anderson and Belnap\u2019s\nnotion of tautological entailment (see their system E) \\(\\neg A \\wedge\n(A\\vee B)\\) entails \\(B\\) if and only if \\((\\neg A \\wedge A) \\vee\n(\\neg A \\wedge B)\\) entails \\(B\\), only if \\((\\neg A \\wedge A)\\)\nentails \\(B\\), which fails since the premise \\((\\neg A \\wedge A)\\) is\nnot relevant to the conclusion \\(B\\) (no shared propositional\nvariables). Anderson and Belnap further argued that we can still have\na version of disjunctive syllogism involving an intensional notion of\ndisjunction \\(\\vee_i\\), for which addition wouldn\u2019t hold.\nIntensional disjunction is defined as follows: \\((A\\vee_i B):= (\\neg A\n\\to_i B) \\), where \\(\\to_i\\) is an intensional implicational\nconnective, i.e., one satisfying the formal criterion of relevance\nintroduced above. The English or would then be ambiguous\nbetween intensional and extensional (truth-functional) disjunction,\nand only for the latter would addition hold. Intuitively, the\nintensional variety of or would be one requiring\n\u201crelevance\u201d between the disjuncts. On the intensional\nreading, \u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\u201d would entail that \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are so related that we are entitled to say \u201cIf\n\\(A\\) had not been true, \\(B\\) would have been true\u201d or\n\u201cIf \\(B\\) had not been true, \\(A\\) would have been\ntrue\u201d or the like. A disjunction like Either Napoleon was\nborn in Corsica or else the number of the beast is perfect\nclearly fails to have this property and therefore is of the\ntruth-functional kind. Whereas That is either Drosophilia\nMelanogaster or D. virilis, I\u2019m not sure which appears to\nentail that if it is not the one then it is the other, and thus is of\nthe intensional kind. The distinction between intensional and\nextensional disjunction has been criticized by various scholars,\nincluding Burgess (1981, 1983), but has been defended by Read (1981,\n1983) who proposed the following example as a clear case of\ntruth-functional disjunction, for which addition is valid: You\nqualify for a grant if either you are over 65 or you can earn less\nthan 2000 pounds a year (Read 1981: 68). Now if English\nor had an intensional and an extensional sense, it should be\npossible to find both in a large variety of linguistic contexts. On a\ncloser inspection however it appears that it is quite hard to find\nclear cases of intensional disjunction in embedded positions like in\nthe antecedent of a conditional (as in Read\u2019s example), or under\nnegation. For example, That is not Drosophilia Melanogaster or D.\nvirilisit, on its most natural reading, simply means that that is\nnot either, but then or must be extensional here because to\nderive \u201cnot \\(A\\) and not \\(B\\)\u201d from \u201cnot\n(\\(A\\) or \\(B\\))\u201d addition is needed. This seems to\nsuggest that phenomena of relevance should be captured on a pragmatic\nlevel rather than on the level of logic (Grice 1989). An explicit\nGricean account of relevance of disjunctive sentences has been indeed\nproposed by Simons (2001), who observes that felicitous utterances of\n\u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\u201d require the disjuncts to be\nrelevant alternatives, and argues that such condition, which she calls\nthe relatedness condition, can be derived from general principles of\nconversation interacting with truth functional interpretation of\nor. In \u201cFurther Notes on Logic and Conversation\u201d\nGrice had suggested that to felicitously use a disjunctive sentence\n\u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\u201d, a speaker must be in possession of\na reasonable argument with \u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\u201d as\nconclusion [by Quality] which does not contain one of the disjuncts as\na step [by Quantity] (Grice 1989: 44). According to Simons to arrive\nat such a kind of evidence is almost certainly impossible in case the\ndisjuncts are not (contextually) related to each other (as they were\nfor example in Belnap and Anderson\u2019s Napoleon example, which\nindeed requires a special context to be acceptable). Simons (2001)\nalso discusses a second requirement that a disjunction needs to\nsatisfy in order to constitute a felicitous contribution to an\nordinary conversation, namely what she calls the distinctness\ncondition (aka known as Hurford\u2019s constraint, from Hurford\n1974), which states that the disjuncts in a clausal disjunction must\nbe distinct alternatives. The following, which does not satisfy such a\nconstraint since one of the disjunct entails the other, is indeed\nhighly anomalous (Simons 2001: example (2)):\n\n(16) Either\nthere is dirt in the fuel line or there is something in the fuel\nline.\n\n\nHurford\u2019s constraint has more recently received some attention\nin the semantic/pragmatic literature because of its role in the debate\nbetween localist and globalist analysis of scalar implicatures (e.g.,\nChierchia, Fox, and Spector 2012).\n\n\nDisjunctive syllogism is also invalid (or better quasi-valid) in\nPriest\u2019s Logic of Paradox (LP). In PL both \\(1\\) and \\(\\#\\) are\ndesignated values (i.e., preserved in valid inferences), where #\nstands for both true and false. More formally, validity is defined as\nfollows: \\(\\Sigma \\models \\phi\\) iff there is no valuation \\(v\\) such\nthat for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Sigma: v(\\psi) = 1\\) or # and \\(v(\\phi) =0\\).\nAdopting the strong Kleene tables for disjunction and negation\npresented above, we obtain that \\(\\phi, (\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi)\n\\not\\models \\psi\\), because \\(\\phi\\) and thus also \\((\\neg \\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\) might be both true and false, while \\(\\psi\\) is false. The\nschema \\(\\phi , (\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi) \\models \\psi\\) however only\nfails in case \\(\\phi\\) is a dialetheia (both true and false),\nin this sense is the scheme quasi-valid. Priest (2006: ch. 8) then argues that applications\nof disjunctive syllogism can be justified/are reasonable in case\n\\((\\phi \\wedge \\neg \\phi)\\) is rationally rejectable.\n\n\nWe conclude this section with a final remark on addition, which\naccording to Anderson and Belnap does not hold for intensional\ndisjunction. The validity of addition has also been disputed in\nrelation to imperative logic. We don\u2019t seem to be able to\nconclude\n (18)\n from\n (17)\n (Ross\u2019 (1941) paradox):\n\n(17) Post\nthis letter!\n(18) Post\nthis letter or burn it!\n\n\nOne way to tackle this would be to treat or in\n (18)\n as a case of intensional disjunction. This solution however would\nfail to account for a characteristic aspect of the interpretation of\ndisjunctive imperatives which arguably explains the failure of\naddition in these cases, namely their choice offering potential. The\nmost natural interpretation of disjunctive imperatives is as one\npresenting a choice between different actions:\n (18)\n implies that you may post the letter and you may burn it (a free\nchoice inference). Imperative\n (17)\n then cannot imply\n (18)\n otherwise when told the former one would be justified in burning the\nletter rather than posting it (e.g., Mastop 2005; Aloni 2007; Aloni\nand Ciardelli 2013).
