    "main_text": "States and Sovereignty || Self-Determination\n3.2 Self-Determination\n\nThere is another fundamental concept that must be factored in to\nexplain the role of sovereignty in modern international law:\nself-determination. Self-determination is prominently mentioned in\nArticle 1(2) of the UN Charter as one of the purposes of the UN. Under\ninternational law, self-determination is a right of all peoples,\ndefined in identical terms in the Charter and the UN International\nCovenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and Economic, Social,\nand Cultural Rights (1966), as the right to \u201cfreely determine\ntheir political status and freely pursue their economic, social and\ncultural development.\u201d\n\nSelf-determination is considered to have both an external and internal\ndimension (Crawford 1979; Alston 2017). The external dimension, namely\nthe right of a people to be free from colonial subjugation or foreign\noccupation and control, was historically most transformative at the\ntime of decolonization (Crawford 1979). The internal dimension\nconcerns the rights of people to pursue democratic governance\ndomestically (Franck 1992) and has become increasingly relevant in\ndiscussions about the role of international law in promoting\ndemocracy.\n\nSelf-determination complicates the meaning of sovereignty in\ninternational law. It is conceptually cognate to moral and political\nideas of popular sovereignty and self-government, which are, in turn,\nrelated to the values of self-respect and autonomy. By embracing this\nnotion, international law gave recognition to the moral and political\nvalue of self-government, accepting that people prefer to be ruled by\ntheir own bad rulers rather than foreigners, including those\nforeigners with some claim to greater competence.\n\nSelf-determination adds a new dimension to argument about sovereignty\nin international law also because it is no longer only states that\nadvance a claim to ultimate authority\u2014in some sense, and to some\ndegree, people can too. This means that international law is no longer\nimmune from tensions between the state and the people that have\nfeatured prominently in many political struggles. In cases of\nsecession (Crawford 1979; Buchanan 2008) in particular, the claim of\nthe extant state to ultimate authority can be challenged by a\npopulation now empowered to articulate a competing claim under the\nbanner of an internationally recognized legal principle (the legal\nmerits of such competing claims will, of course, vary).\n\nIf sovereignty is thought of as a quality that both states and peoples\npossess, the analogy between sovereignty and human autonomy, advanced\nby Timothy Endicott, makes more sense. Moreover, understood as both\ncomplete power within a political community and complete independence\nneeded for the purposes of a good state, sovereignty is compatible\nwith the legitimate authority of international law and ameliorates the\nworry about abuses (Endicott 2010). Such power and freedom must be\nsubject to law but, just as with individual autonomy, it is wrong to\nthink that these qualities must be forgone as a price for such\nsubjection.\n",
