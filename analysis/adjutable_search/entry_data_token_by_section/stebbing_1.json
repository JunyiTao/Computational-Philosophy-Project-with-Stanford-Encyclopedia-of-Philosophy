    "main_text": "Logic\n2. Logic\n\nStebbing\u2019s first significant work, which established her\nreputation, was A Modern Introduction to Logic. First\npublished in 1930, it was revised in 1933, and might justly be\nregarded as the first textbook of analytic philosophy: it went through\nseveral editions and was still being reprinted in the early 1960s. Its\nmain aim was to introduce readers to the developments in logic that\nhad taken place over the previous five decades, though she leads into\nthis through discussion of traditional Aristotelian logic. Its title\nwas \u201cA Modern Introduction to Logic\u201d, not \u201cAn\nIntroduction to Modern Logic\u201d. Divided into three parts, the\nfirst deals with topics that are now familiar in analytic philosophy,\nsuch as names and descriptions, logical form, the theory of\ndescriptions, inference and implication, as well as offering an\naccount of syllogistic theory. The second deals with scientific\nmethodology, covering induction and causality, in particular. The\nthird discusses definition, abstraction, and the nature and historical\ndevelopment of logic.\n\nStebbing\u2019s conception of logic is made clear in the first and\nlast two chapters of the book. Logical thinking is\n\u201cdirected\u201d thinking, aimed at answering a question or\nsolving a problem. As such it involves reasoning: identifying\nand articulating the premises by means of which, by valid\nargumentation, to arrive at relevant conclusions. Reasoning proceeds\nin accord with certain rules and exhibits certain forms of inference,\nand one of the tasks of logical theory is to articulate these rules\nand make explicit these forms of inference\u2014as Aristotle first\ndid in developing his theory of the syllogism. One reason that\nStebbing included discussion of syllogistic theory was that the rules\nand forms are relatively simple, so that the dependence of the\nvalidity of an inference on its logical form, for example, could be\nmore easily ascertained and elucidated. But she was also concerned to\nintroduce modern logic. She explains the basic symbolism of Whitehead\nand Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica in chapter 8, for\nexample, and the theory of relations in chapter 10. She does not give\nany systematic presentation of the predicate calculus, however. In\nkeeping with her conception of directed thinking, her concern is\nprimarily with explaining the various concepts and doctrines, such as\nthe concept of a proposition and Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions, which help us in understanding logical thinking and\nlogical theory.\n\nLogic, according to Stebbing, is not an art, understood as \u201ca\nset of rules the learning of which may fit some one to do\nsomething\u201d, but a science\u2014the science of possible forms\n(1933b: 473\u20134). Insofar as the logical forms that the science of\nlogic discovers are norms of thinking, logic can be described\nas a normative science. But its normativity is not its distinguishing\nfeature, she argues, but is merely a by-product of the fact that norms\nare what are discovered in logic. She offers an account of the\ndevelopment of logic as the science of form in the final chapter of\nthe book, tracing it from its roots in Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics to Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica, in which it is finally shown, she claims, that\n\u201cDemonstration as such is purely formal\u201d (1933b: 488).\n\nIn 1934 Stebbing published Logic in Practice, a very short\nbook directed at a more general audience. She continues to regard\nlogic as the science of forms, the chief task of which is to make\nexplicit the norms of reasoning. But she does indeed become more\ninterested in the art of thinking. In the preface she writes:\n\n\nThe study of logic does not in itself suffice to enable us to reason\ncorrectly, still less to think clearly where our passionate beliefs\nare concerned. Thinking is an activity of the whole personality.\nGiven, however, a desire to be reasonable, then a knowledge of the\nconditions to which all sound thinking must conform will enable us to\navoid certain mistakes into which we are prone to fall. There is such\na thing as a habit of sound reasoning. This habit may be acquired by\nconsciously attending to the logical principles of sound reasoning, in\norder to apply them to test the soundness of particular arguments.\n(1934a: vii\u2013viii)\n\n\nLogic in Practice is intended to help people reason\ncorrectly, with stress laid on \u201cthe importance of considering\nlanguage, which is an instrument of our thinking and is imperfect, as\nare all human creations\u201d (1934a: viii). This marks a transition\nin Stebbing\u2019s work: from the mid 1930s onwards she becomes more\nconcerned with what would now be described as critical thinking.\n",
