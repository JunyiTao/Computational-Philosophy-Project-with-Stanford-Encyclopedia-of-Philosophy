    "main_text": "The practical criterion || The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n5.2 The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe RNB view opens up a more promising way to read the\nbrief counter-arguments in Plutarch and Sextus as a positive theory of\nArcesilaus. His counter in Plutarch is that action isn\u2019t always caused\nby occurrent beliefs\u2014we sometimes act through habit, or by\ninstinct. By itself, this doesn\u2019t go very far, however, since the\nStoics will have objected that, even if this were possible, this\naccount couldn\u2019t describe the voluntary and responsible actions of a\nrational agent. (The Stoics defined responsible or voluntary action in\nterms of assent, since this was the mechanism through which our\nrationality acts on the world.) But one can read the counter-argument\nin Sextus as supplementing that response: there is space for\nrationality and responsibility, on this view, in the production of the\nimpressions or thoughts motivating us when we act. We can act in\naccordance with what strikes us as the reasonable thing to do upon\nreflection, but still refrain from assent, i.e., refrain from forming\nthe belief that this is the right thing to do.\n\n\nThere are two problems facing this interpretation of \u2018the\nreasonable\u2019. The first is that it does not look to be supported\nby the evidence to which it appeals. Sextus, the source for the notion\nof \u2018the reasonable\u2019 as the criterion, says that Arcesilaus\nand his followers did not define a criterion and that, when they\nseemed to, they did so \u201ca counterblast to that of the\nStoics\u201d (M. 7.150, Bury trans.). (Sextus\u2019 later\naccount of Arcesilaus in another work is also incompatible with his\nhypothesizing such a theory; see Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.232\u20133.) And Cicero and Numenius, our other sources for the\nview that Arcesilas was committed to inapprehensibility\nand universal suspension, do not mention his adoption of a\npractical criterion\u2014in fact, in both authors it is suggested\nthat Arcesilaus did not offer a position on how one might live without\nassent, and that Carneades significantly revised the Academic position\nin this respect (Academica 2.32; Numenius fr. 27.14\u201332,\ncf.  Numenius fr. 26.107\u201311).\n\n\nThe second problem is that even if the context does not explicitly\ndemand that Arcesilaus\u2019 practical criterion was a dialectical\nploy, the argument Arcesilaus used to support it makes the most sense\nif it is construed dialectically. The argument he gives is something\nlike this (Sextus M. 7.158):\n\na good life depends on practical wisdom;\npractical wisdom consists in a disposition causing right or\nsuccessful actions;\nright or successful actions are those that have a reasonable\ndefense (or justification);\nthe wise person will be guided by what is reasonable;\nhence, the wise person will go right or be successful.\n\n\n\nTwo difficulties face this non-dialectical reading. One is that\nthere is no other evidence that Arcesilaus was committed to premises\n[13] through [16], and they are also ones that Arcesilaus may have\nargued against, since it is reported that he argued not just against\nthe Stoic theory but against all ethical views (Philodemus Index\nAcademicorum 18.40\u201319.9, Diogenes Laertius 7.171, Numenius\nfr. 25.154\u201361, cf. fr. 25.41\u20135).\n\n\nThe second, more pressing difficulty is that, although these premises\nare adapted to the Arcesilean context in which nothing can be known\nand the wise person does not assent to anything, they are manifestly\nvariants of the Stoic theory. The Stoics claimed that a good life is\nthe result of performing \u2018appropriate\nactions\u2019\u2014defined as \u201cthose that, once done, have a\nreasonable defense\u201d\u2014from a disposition of wisdom, i.e.,\nknowledge of what is good, bad and neither. But if nothing can be\nknown, as Arcesilaus has already argued ([5]\u2013[7] in sect. 3,\nabove), the wisdom of the sage consists in not having any\nbeliefs. This disposition will still allow the sage to perform\nappropriate actions, however, if, as the Stoics claim, they are\ndefined by reasonable defenses or justifications. The connection\nbetween performing such actions through a wise disposition and success\nis, Arcesilaus suggests, something that the Stoics can\u2019t deny, because\nthey agree that opinion is the cause of error (this is the\njustification for premise [6] in sect. 3, above).  Hence, the perfect\nexercise of our rationality\u2014reflection without assent, as\nArcesilaus has argued\u2014will lead us to find the action that is\nappropriate to us as rational animals, i.e., the reasonable thing to\ndo, and this guarantees success. Arcesilaus therefore employs the\nStoic definition of appropriate action to defend acting on views that\nare reasonably justified. But, for the Stoics, what is reasonably\njustified is what conforms with the sage\u2019s knowledge of what is\ngood, bad, and neither. Arcesilaus, it seems, cannot borrow his\nopponents\u2019 theory without also accepting the possibility of\nknowledge.\n",
