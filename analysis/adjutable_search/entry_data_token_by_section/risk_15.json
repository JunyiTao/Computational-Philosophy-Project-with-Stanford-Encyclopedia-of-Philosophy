Some of us willingly take risks\nwhich others deem much too large. The notion of certainty-equivalent\noutcomes can be used to specify such differences. Consider a risky\noutcome X. Another outcome Y is a\ncertainty-equivalent outcome for X if and only if (1)\nY involves no uncertainty and (2) X and Y\nare considered by the agent to be equally good. For instance, let\nX be a lottery ticket with a 50 per cent chance of winning\nsomething to which you assign 10 utiles (utility units) and a 50 per\ncent chance of winning nothing. The expected utility of this ticket is\n5 utiles. Now suppose that you are indifferent between receiving 3\nutiles for sure and receiving X. Then your attitude is risk\naverse. The general criterion for risk aversion (risk avoidance,\ncautiousness) is that \\(CE(X) < EU(X)\\). Similarly, you are risk\nneutral concerning X if \\(CE(X) = EU(X)\\) and you are risk\naffine (risk seeking, risk loving) if \\(EU(X) < CE(X)\\).\n\nIn economics, risk aversion is usually related to money. Let\nX represent a lottery ticket with a 50 per cent chance of\nwinning \u20ac 100, and suppose that you consider this ticket to be\nworth \u20ac 30. We then have \\(EU(X) = u(100)/2\\), and \\(CE(X) =\nu(30)\\). This means that \\(u(30) = u(100)/2\\). If this is a consistent\npattern, then the utility of money, as illustrated in a diagram with\namounts x of money on the x axis and their utilities \\(u(x)\\)\non the y axis, will be represented by a concave (hill-like) curve.\nSimilarly, if a risk affine behaviour will be represented by a convex\n(valley-like curve). Provided that the utility function u is\ntwice continuously differentiable, this can be expressed more\nprecisely in the form of the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk\naversion/affinity, according to which the agent\u2019s risk aversion\nat any point x is equal to \\(-u''(x)/u'(x)\\). Hence, a person\nwith the utility function \\(u_1\\) is more risk averse at a point\nx than one with utility function \\(u_2\\) if and only if\n\n\\[-{u_1}''(x)/{u_1}'(x) > -{u_2}''(x)/{u_2}'(x)\\]\n (Arrow 1965; Pratt 1964). The Arrow-Pratt measure has the\nadvantage of being invariant under transformations of the utility\nfunction that preserve the preference relation that it represents\n(i.e. it is invariant under multiplication of the utility with a\npositive constant and addition of an arbitrary constant). On the other\nhand, it can be questioned on philosophical grounds whether risk\nattitudes can be adequately represented by variations in the utility\nof money. It can be argued that cautiousness and the utility of money\nare two separate issues and that they should therefore have\nindependent representations.\n",
