    "main_text": "Regress and Theoretical Vices\n1. Regress and Theoretical Vices\n\nSometimes it is uncontroversial that a theory that generates an\ninfinite regress is objectionable, because the regress reveals that\nthe theory suffers from some kind of theoretical vice that is a reason\nto reject the theory independently of it yielding an infinite\nregress. In these cases, an infinite regress argument can show us that\nwe have reason to reject a theory, but it is not because the theory\nyields a regress per se, but rather because it has this other\nbad feature, and the regress has revealed that.\n",
