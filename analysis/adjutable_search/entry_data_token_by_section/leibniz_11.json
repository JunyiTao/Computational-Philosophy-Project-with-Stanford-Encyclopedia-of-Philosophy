    "main_text": "Metaphysics: A Primer on Substance || The Logical Conception of Substance\n4.1 The Logical Conception of Substance\n\n\nIn \u00a78 of the Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz gives\none of his most important accounts of the nature of individual\nsubstance. There he claims that the Aristotelian idea that a substance\nis that which is the subject of predication and which cannot be\npredicated of something else is insufficient for a true analysis of the\nnature of substance. He next appeals to the PC and the PIN: in every\ntrue predication, the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. \u201cSince this is so,\u201d Leibniz claims,\n\u201cwe can say that the nature of an individual substance or of a\ncomplete being is to have a notion so complete that it is sufficient to\ncontain and to allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the\nsubject to which this notion is attributed\u201d (A VI iv 1540/AG 41).\nIn other words, x is a substance if and only\nif x has a complete individual\nconcept (CIC), that is, a concept that contains within it\nall predicates of x past,\npresent, and future. The CIC, then, serves to individuate substances;\nit is able to pick out its bearer from an infinity of other finite\ncreated substances. Leibniz gives as an example Alexander the Great. The\nconcept of Alexander contains being a King, being a student of\nAristotle, conquering Darius and Porus, and so on. Now, \u201cGod,\nseeing Alexander's individual notion or haecceity, sees in it at the\nsame time the basis and reason for all the predicates which can be said\ntruly of him\u201d (A VI iv 1540\u201341/AG 41). Leibniz's invocation\nof the Scotist notion of a haecceity is intriguing. What\nLeibniz is telling us is that Alexander's thisness is\ndetermined by the sum of his qualitative properties. Moreover, we can\nsee a metaphysical aspect to this logical conception of substance: the\ncomplete individual concept of a substance is the notion or\nessence of the substance as it known by the divine\nunderstanding.\n\n\nLeibniz concludes this section with his celebrated doctrine\nof marks and traces: \u201cwhen we consider\ncarefully the connection of things, we can say that from all time in\nAlexander's soul there are vestiges of everything that has\nhappened to him and marks of everything that will happen to him and\neven traces of everything that happens in the universe, even though God\nalone could recognize them all\u201d (A VI iv 1541/AG 41). The\ndoctrine of marks and traces, therefore, claims that, because the CIC\ncontains all predicates true of a substance past, present, and future,\nthe entire history of the universe can be read (if only by God) in the\nessence of any individual substance.\n\n\nThe consequences that Leibniz draws from the logical conception of\nsubstance and the doctrine of marks and traces are remarkable. In the\nfollowing section (\u00a79) of the Discourse on Metaphysics,\nwe are told they include the following:\n\n\n\n(1)\nNo two substances can resemble each other\ncompletely and be distinct. (PII)\n\n\n(2)\nA substance can only begin in creation and end\nin annihilation.\n\n\n(3)\nA substance is not divisible.\n\n\n(4)\nOne substance cannot be constructed from\ntwo.\n\n\n(5)\nThe number of substances does not naturally\nincrease and decrease.\n\n\n(6)\nEvery substance is like a complete world and\nlike a mirror of God or of the whole universe, which each expresses in\nits own way.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Leibniz's reasons for drawing these\nconsequences are not in all cases obvious. Why should PII follow from\nthe complete individual concept account of substance? If we consider\nthe CIC as that which allows us to pick out and individuate any\nindividual substance from an infinity of substances, then we realize\nthat, if the individual concepts of two substances,\na and b, do not\nallow us (or God) to distinguish the one from the other, then their\nindividual concepts are not complete. That is, there must\nalways be a reason, found within the complete individual concept of\nsubstances and issuing from the free decree of God, that\na is discernible from\nb. And this fact points to another important\nfact about the interpretation suggested above: it is not only the case\nthat each substance has a complete individual concept\u2013the\nessence of the substance as it exists in the divine mind\u2013but\nfor every essence or complete individual concept there is one and only\none substance in a world. (The argument here is essentially that which\nwas given above in the section describing the relation between PSR and\nPII; namely, what reason could God have had for instantiating two\nsubstances with identical CICs?) Further, why should it be the case\nthat substances can only arise naturally in God's creation of the\nworld and end in his annihilation? If one takes quite literally\nLeibniz's claim that the CIC contains within it all predicates\ntrue of the substance past, present, and future, then one might be able\nto say that this must include truths extending back to the creation and\nforward either infinitely or to the end of time. This argument might be\nsomewhat weak in itself, but it certainly would seem to follow from\nLeibniz's logical notion of substance and one of the\nother consequences, namely, that each substance is a mirror of the\nentire universe. If this is the case, then a substance,\ninsofar as it is a mirror of the entire universe, must have within its\ncomplete individual concept predicates that extend back to creation and\nforward in time. At first glance, it is also not readily apparent\nmerely from the CIC and doctrine of marks and traces why a substance\ncannot be constructed from two substances or be divided into two new\nsubstances. Let substance x have within its\ncomplete individual concept predicates g, h, i\u2026 which\nare true of it past, present and future. Suppose\nx were to be divided into\nx\u03b1 and\nx\u03b2. One might imagine that\nboth new substances would have all of\nx's pre-division predicates in common\nand unique predicates thereafter. But the relevant part of\nLeibniz's logical notion of substance is that the CIC is\nsufficiently rich to allow us (or God) to deduce from it all predicates\npast, present and future. Leibniz's implicit suggestion is that\nthe pre-division predicates would not allow the logical deduction of\nbranching or divided substances. If g, h, i,\u2026 imply\nl\u03b1, m\u03b1, n\u03b1,\nthey cannot also imply l\u03b2, m\u03b2,\nn\u03b2. A similar argument works against the\npossibility of the fusion of two substances. Further, if we already\ngrant PII, then it should be clear that the substance having within its\nCIC predicates g, h, i, \u2026 l\u03b1,\nm\u03b1, n\u03b1, and the substance having\nwithin its CIC predicates g, h, i, \u2026 l\u03b2,\nm\u03b2, n\u03b2 are numerically distinct\nsubstances and not simply one substance in its pre-division phase that\nhas multiplied. Since substances can only naturally arise during\nGod's creation of the world and since substances cannot undergo\nfusion or fission, it is obvious that the number of substances must\nremain constant. Finally, if it is the case that it is of the nature of\na substance to have a notion so complete that one can deduce from it\nall its predicates past, present, and future and if substances exist\nfrom the creation of the world, then it would seem (relatively) natural\nto conclude that each substance contains within it a kind of story of\nthe entire universe from its own particular perspective. While more\nwill be said below, what Leibniz is suggesting here is a set of\ndoctrines that he will develop in greater detail: the\nworlds apart doctrine, the\nmirroring (or expression) thesis, and the\ndoctrine of universal harmony.\n\nAnother notable consequence of the logical conception of substance is\nthe denial of the causal interaction of finite\nsubstances. This is clearest in Primary Truths (C 521/L\n269/AG 33), where a very similar argument concerning the nature of\nsubstance is given. Not only is it the case, Leibniz claims, that\ngenuine physical influx \u2013 the transfer of some property within\none substance to a second substance \u2013 is inexplicable, but more\nimportant the logical conception of substance shows us that\nthe reasons for any property that a substance may have are\nalready contained within its CIC. In other words, every state of a\nsubstance is explained, grounded, or caused by its own notion or\nCIC. (Of course, the ground or reason for the existence or actuality\nof any particular substance is to be found in God and his free choice\nof worlds. A more detailed account of Leibniz's views on causation is\navailable in the entry\n Leibniz on Causation.) \nAs we shall see below, the denial of the causal interaction of\nsubstances forms an essential premise of Leibniz's argument for\npre-established harmony.\n",
