Natural Language Ontology as a Subdiscipline of Both Linguistics and Philosophy\n\nNatural language ontology as a subdiscipline of both linguistics and\nphilosophy raises a number of general questions. First, how does\nnatural language ontology situate itself within metaphysics and how is\nit to be understood as a part of metaphysics? Second, how exactly does\nthe semantics of natural language involve ontology and thus in what\nsense is natural language ontology part of linguistics? Third, what\nsorts of linguistic data reflect the ontology implicit in language,\nand how is that ontology itself to be characterized? In what follows,\nthese questions will be addressed in turn.\n",
