Put bluntly, Dingle is an old-fashioned\nempiricist and inductivist. He believes that the only way to do true\nscience is to first collect data, then, and only then, to hypothesize\non the basis of that data. Observation, then hypothesis. As he sees\nit, Eddington, Milne and Dirac have got it exactly backwards. They\nfirst (as he terms it) assume an hypothesis, then, and only then, go\nabout collecting data. Except, according to his lights, the data\nisn\u2019t ever collected: \u201cto [the Aristotelians\u2019]\nmodern representatives it seems as though a fancy is no sooner in the\nhead than it is on paper and sent for publication\u201d (Dingle 1937,\np. 785). Obviously Dingle is simply wrong; it never occurred to his\nopponents that hypotheses would not be followed\nimmediately by attempts at deductive prediction of observational\nconsequences. But it was enough, in Dingle\u2019s mind, that they\ndidn\u2019t use induction, for them to come under blame.\n",
