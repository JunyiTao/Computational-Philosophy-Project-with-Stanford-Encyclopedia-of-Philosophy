    "main_text": "\n\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following new entry by Amber Griffioen replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous authors.]\n\n\nAlthough rather unlikely to make many philosophers\u2019\n\u201ctop-five\u201d list of medieval Christian thinkers (and even\nless likely to be found on a history of philosophy syllabus), few\nmedieval thinkers are as wildly popular today in non-academic circles\n(and even more widely quoted out of context\u2014both in his day and\nin ours) than Meister Eckhart. Both the scholarly philosophical\nneglect and the popular spiritual embrace of Eckhart have, in no small\npart, to do with his contemporary recasting as a\n\u201cmystic\u201d\u2014a designation which has led present-day\nscholars to downplay his intellectual importance and spiritual seekers\nto up-play his esotericism. Even the German title Meister\n(\u201cmaster\u201d) is often mistakenly assumed to reflect\nEckhart\u2019s status as a spiritual \u201cguru\u201d of sorts,\nwhen in reality it derives from the Latin honorific magister,\na title granted only to the most learned of university-trained\nscholars of his day. Yet neither the contemporary philosophers who\nignore him nor the new-age enthusiasts who adore him adequately\ncapture the complexity of the Meister, who was both a sophisticated\nand well-respected intellectual\u2014a master of letters, learning,\nand language\u2014as well as a spiritual leader of his order helping\nthe men and women under his instruction to master the \u201cwayless\nways\u201d of leaving the self, knowing God, and living well. This\nentry seeks to show the ways in which the intellectual, spiritual, and\nethical aspects of Eckhart\u2019s thought are deeply intertwined,\nusing his unique approach to language and communication as a guiding\nthread.\n\nUnfortunately, the neglect in philosophical circles of Eckhart\u2019s\nintellectual contributions to the history of philosophy makes it\ndifficult to find a comprehensive list of the\nmagister\u2019s (confirmed) Latin and German works, and\nthere is to-date no complete English translation of the Latin works.\nAdditionally, various editors and translators over the years have\nnumbered the German sermons differently, often leading to confusion\nregarding the ordering and cross-referencing of the sermons. For this\nreason, citations of primary-source material in this entry provide,\nfirst, the abbreviation of the relevant work with the section number,\nfollowed by the volume and page number from the German critical\nedition (LW or DW for Lateinische Werke and\nDeutsche Werke, respectively), as well as the page number of\nthe English translation when possible. With respect to Eckhart\u2019s\nGerman sermons, I have used Quint\u2019s numbering, as it is the most\nwidely recognized by Eckhart scholars (and that used by the critical\neditions). Finally, where relevant, I have cited LW I/2, as opposed to\nLW I, since the former is also used in the more accessible (and\naffordable) Latin-German study edition.\n",
