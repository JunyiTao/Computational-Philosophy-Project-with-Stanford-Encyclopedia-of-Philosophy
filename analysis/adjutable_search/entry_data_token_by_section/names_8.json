The set of\ncanonical attributions in the use theory boils down to a cluster of\nconditions that jointly determine reference. Theories of both sorts\nare specified by providing a means of selecting the set, and a means\nof resolving conflicts among the properties in the set (in the event\nthat it does not turn out to be unitary).\n\nUse theories, like cluster theories, can be seen as open-ended in what\ncounts towards reference (I was careful to allow for this in the\ngeneral statement at the end of the previous section). Even an\nopen-ended cluster theory can issue in ceteris paribus claims\nsuch as: if these are the only considerations operating in the case,\nthen the reference is to so-and-so. In use theories, this\nopen-endedness crops up (at least) in the choice of precedent; so that\nthe best we might say, in some cases, is: if we fix the precedent like\nthis, then the reference is to such-and-such. Though we are certainly\nnot at a loss in deciding the proper precedent for any particular\ncase, it is difficult to say in general and with precision which\napplications should count. Evans\u2019 invocation of a name-using\npractice is too vague to guide us in concretely described cases, and\nKripke explicitly disclaims that he is providing a prediction-making\ntheory of nominal reference.\n\nIf we generalize cluster theories to allow them to include identifying\nproperties extracted from use (instead of restricting them to\ndispositional identifying descriptions), we can treat use theories as\na species of cluster theory. Indeed, a general umbrella is a good idea\nif it turns out that dispositional identifying descriptions play a\npart in determining reference alongside \u201cthe actual pattern of\ndealings\u201d (see Lewis 1984: 226\u201327, for this argument, and\nUnger 1983 for the cases on which it is based). For example, Evans\nobserves that one\u2019s utterance of \u201cAnir\u201d cannot refer\nto King Arthur\u2019s son if one believes it to be the name of\nArthur\u2019s burial place instead (1973: 198; see Dickie 2011 for a\nhost of similar examples).\n\nWe have already noted that a cluster theory need not give the meaning\nof a name; that adopting one is consistent with thinking that names\nare meaningless. Our example, recall, was Strawson, who denied the\nmeaningfulness of names (he would not even grant them a rule of use),\nyet thought their reference was determined by a cluster of identifying\ndescriptions. On the other hand, one might have reasons for thinking\nthe cluster\u2014even one that includes properties derived from\nuse\u2014accurately represents the meaning of a name (this appears,\nfor instance, to be Lewis\u2019s view). Finally, the cluster could\ncomprise influences from meaning alongside influences from use, with\nthe rule for adjudicating conflict, in part, deciding between factors\nof those different types.\n",
