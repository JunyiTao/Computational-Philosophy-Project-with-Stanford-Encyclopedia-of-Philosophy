    "main_text": "Rights of Future People vis-\u00e0-vis Presently Living People || A Right to Non-Existence?\n2.2 A Right to Non-Existence?\n\nCan prospective children be said to have an interest that their\nparents not act in a way likely to lead to their birth when the\nparents are in a position to know that the life of the child, should\nit be born, would fall below some relevant threshold of well-being?\n(On the significance of the notion of a threshold level of well-being,\nsee below,\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74).\n John Stuart Mill endorses the idea of a procreational duty of\nomission, namely, not to bring a person into existence unless the\nperson will have \u201cat least the ordinary chances of a desirable\nexistence\u201d (see Mill 1859 [1977: 301\u2013304]). It is a widely\nheld belief that under certain circumstances prospective parents\nshould refrain from procreating owing to the predicted plight of the\nwould-be child. Antinatalists hold that these conditions hold\ngenerally (see, e.g., Schopenhauer, 1851: vol. 2, ch. xii, \u00a7 149;\nCioran, 1978: 117; Horstmann 1983: 99\u2013101). More recently, for\nexample, Seana Shiffrin (1999) and David Benatar (2006: esp. ch. 2)\nhave argued that causing someone to exist always entails the\nfrustration of some of the person\u2019s interests and nontrivial\nharm to that person, and therefore we ought to refrain from\nprocreating.\n\nSince the publication of Narveson\u2019s seminal paper\n\u201cUtilitarianism and New Generations\u201d (Narveson 1967; see\nalso Narveson 1973), many have contributed to the debate on whether a\nperson-affecting approach can account for the asymmetry of our\nprocreational duties (Parfit 1976; Feinberg 1984: 101, and 1986;\nMulgan 2006: ch. 6; Rivera-L\u00f3pez 2009). The claimed asymmetry\nis the following: while prospective parents have no obligation to\nprocreate out of regard for the interests of possible future children,\nthey have an obligation not to beget children who are going to be\nmiserable.\n\nSome have argued that belief in such an asymmetry is incompatible with\na person-affecting view and, more particularly, with the claim that\npossible people cannot be said to have, against us, a right to\n existence.[2]\n It is helpful at this point to make a distinction between the\nreasoning of potential parents that involves a possible\nfuture child and reasoning that involves their future child\n(see Govier 1979: 111). For instance, in deciding not to procreate at\nall people do not thereby harm the children they could have brought\ninto existence (see\n \u00a72.1)\n since these are merely possible individuals. Thus, much reasoning\nabout whether or not to have a child should concern the interests of\nthose already alive; it is actual people\u2019s lives that would be\naffected by whether or not the child comes into existence (see Heyd\n1992: 96\u201397; Roberts 2009: sec. 2). Nonetheless, people might\nmake choices about procreation based on the welfare of their future\nchild; that is, the welfare of that as yet non-existent individual\nwould feature in their reasoning. When prospective parents decide in\nfavor of having a child and now learn that this child, if born, would\nhave a life that falls below a certain threshold of well-being (see\n \u00a74)\n they ought to consider the effects of their actions on their\nchild and might well decide not to have a child after all.\n\nObjections to the asymmetry view presented above concern, in\nparticular, the claim that after having made a decision to have\nchildren, prospective parents should revise their decision out of\nregard for their would-be child(ren) when they learn that the\nprospective child(ren) would have a life that falls below the relevant\nthreshold. Why, under these circumstances, should parents revise their\ndecision to have children out of regard for the children? Some argue\nthat they would harm the would-be child, and, thus, arguably, would\nact wrongly toward it. Here, harming their child-to-be would inflict a\nwrong on it. When prospective parents learn that their child would\nhave a life that falls below the relevant threshold, they should\nrefrain from having it, for by bringing the child into existence they\nwould cause harm to it. In bringing about a child\u2019s existence\nthey can harm this child.\n\nThis claim has been said to be incompatible with a person-affecting\nview (see Heyd 1992: 102, 105\u2013106, 241\u2013242). In\n Section 3,\n two notions of harm will be distinguished. The first relies on\ncomparing a person\u2019s actual state to a counterfactual (or\nhistorical) state of the same person. The second relies on no such\ncomparison. Both notions of harm require us to ask: for whom is the\naction worse? However, while both notions can be understood to reflect\nthe person-affecting view as specified above\n (\u00a71),\n only the first fulfills the stronger conditions of Parfit\u2019s\n\u201ctwo-state requirement\u201d or\n\u201cbetter-or-worse-for-the-same-person\u201d requirement: \n\n\nwe benefit or harm someone only if we cause him to be better or worse\noff than he would otherwise at that time have been. (Parfit 1984: 487)\n\n\n\nThis requirement characterizes the strong person-affecting view (as\nintroduced in\n \u00a71).\n The contingency of future people will often mean that the same person\ncould not or is not likely to have come into existence as a result of\ntwo alternative acts or actions (see below\n \u00a73.1).\n As will be shown in\n Section 3.2\n below, in applying the second notion of harm, we do not have to\ncompare the value of life below some threshold with nonexistence (or\nwith how well off another person or other people would have been) in\norder to be able to claim that we can cause harm to a person by\nbringing about that person\u2019s existence. The second notion\nfulfills the conditions of the weak person-affecting view (as\nintroduced in\n \u00a71).\n\nIf on the basis of this reflection we assume that the person can be\nconsidered harmed, why was the person wronged by having been brought\ninto existence if the person has a life worth living? If we specify\nthe threshold in terms of rights we might think that the person would\nwaive whatever right was violated by having been brought into\nexistence as the person can be assumed to much prefer living to\nnever-ever-coming into existence. Then we might believe that bringing\ninto existence a person whose life is worth living, but below the\nthreshold, is a case of wrongless harm-doing if we consider the issue\nin person-affecting terms (see J. Harris 1992: 94\u201396; Williams\n& Harris 2014, 347\u2013348).\n\nThe assumed fact that the person would waive her right clearly does\nnot settle the matter of whether she was wronged by having been\nbrought into existence (Harman 2004: 89\u2013101; Liberto 2014:\n79\u201380). A person can have a legitimate complaint about having\nbeen brought into existence although she does not wish that the action\nhad not occurred, although she (the same person) could not be in the\nstate of not having been wronged (but see Heyd 2014: 4\u20135), and\neven though she enjoys a life worth living.\n\nThe claim that bringing into existence a person in a harmed state\naccording to a certain threshold is wrongful implies that this person\nis worse off than she ought to be. That the person will have a life\nworth living is not a sufficient reason to render permissible bringing\nthe person into existence and in a harmed sub-threshold state. The\nground for this reason does not rely on a comparison with how well off\nthe person or other people would be if we refrain from bringing the\nperson into existence or acted differently (but see Harman 2004:\n101\u2013102; McBrayer 2008: 304; Woollard 2012). The reason\nunderstood in person-affecting terms does not reflect the view that\nthe person would be better off if he or she would never ever come to\nexistence or the view that we should bring into existence another\nperson whose life is above the threshold or the view that we should\nmaximize the number of people with lives above the threshold. Rather,\nif we have a choice between bringing into existence a person with a\nlife worth living, but below the threshold, and bringing into\nexistence a person with a life worth living at or above the threshold,\nthe reason, namely, that persons can be worse off than they ought to\nbe, speaks against doing the former but not in favor of doing the\nlatter. This is how we can argue on the basis of a weak\nperson-affecting view (see\n \u00a71)\n and a threshold conception of harm (see\n \u00a73).\n\nLet us note that one can also defend the asymmetry of our\nprocreational duties from an impersonal view, according to which the\nvalue of states of affairs is not reducible to how these states affect\nthe interests of people. From an impersonal view one does not have to\nclaim that prospective parents should refrain from procreation out\nof regard for the children they would have. Based on this view,\ntwo alternative interpretations of the asymmetry of our procreational\nduties have been discussed in the literature. One could adopt a\nversion of negative consequentialism and argue that the universe would\nbe better if present generations were guided by a criterion of right\naction that requires them to give priority to the prevention of\nsuffering over the creation of good and happiness (see Heyd 1992:\n59\u201360, for problems with this account). Alternatively, an\nimpersonal approach could argue that we have a prima facie\nduty to promote over-all happiness by creating new well off\npeople\u2014which duty, however, may be more easily overridden than\nduties not to cause harm. The paradoxical implications of the latter\nview have been prominently explored by Derek\n Parfit.[3]\n",
