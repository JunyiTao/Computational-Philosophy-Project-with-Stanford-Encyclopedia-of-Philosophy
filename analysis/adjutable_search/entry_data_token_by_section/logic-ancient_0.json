    "main_text": "Pre-Aristotelian Logic || Syntax and Semantics\n1.1 Syntax and Semantics\n\n\nSome of the Sophists classified types of sentences (logoi)\naccording to their force. So Protagoras (485\u2013415 BCE), who\nincluded wish, question, answer and command (Diels Kranz (DK) 80.A1,\nDiogenes Laertius (D. L.) 9.53\u20134), and Alcidamas (pupil of\nGorgias, fl. 4th BCE), who distinguished assertion\n(phasis), denial (apophasis), question and address\n(prosagoreusis) (D. L. 9.54). Antisthenes\n(mid-5th\u2013mid-4th cent.) defined a sentence\nas \u2018that which indicates what a thing was or is\u2019\n(D. L. 6.3, DK 45) and stated that someone who says what is speaks\ntruly (DK49). Perhaps the earliest surviving passage on logic is found\nin the Dissoi Logoi or Double Arguments (DK 90.4,\nc. 400 BCE). It is evidence for a debate over truth and\nfalsehood. Opposed were the views (i) that truth is\na\u2014temporal\u2014property of sentences, and that a sentence is\ntrue (when it is said), if and only if things are as the sentence says\nthey are when it is said, and false if they aren\u2019t; and (ii) that\ntruth is an atemporal property of what is said, and that what is said\nis true if and only if the things are the case, false if they aren\u2019t\nthe case. These are rudimentary formulations of two alternative\ncorrespondence theories of truth. The same passage displays awareness\nof the fact that self-referential use of the truth-predicate can be\nproblematic\u2014an insight also documented by the discovery of the\nLiar paradox by Eubulides of Miletus (mid-4th c. BCE)\nshortly thereafter.\n\n\nSome Platonic dialogues contain passages whose topic is indubitably\nlogic. In the Sophist, Plato analyzes simple statements as\ncontaining a verb (rh\u00eama), which indicates action, and\na noun(onoma), which indicates the agent (Soph.\n261e\u2013262a). Anticipating the modern distinction of logical\ntypes, he argues that neither a series of nouns nor a series of verbs\ncan combine into a statement (Soph. 262a\u2013d). Plato also\ndivorces syntax (\u2018what is a statement?\u2019) from semantics\n(\u2018when is it true?\u2019). Something (e.g. \u2018Theaetetus is\nsitting\u2019) is a statement if it both succeeds in specifying a\nsubject and says something about this subject. Plato thus determines\nsubject and predicate as relational elements in a statement and\nexcludes as statements subject-predicate combinations containing empty\nsubject expressions. Something is a true statement if with reference\nto its subject (Theaetetus) it says of what is (e.g. sitting) that it\nis. Something is a false statement if with reference to its subject it\nsays of something other than what is (e.g. flying), that it is. Here\nPlato produces a sketch of a deflationist theory of truth\n(Soph. 262e\u2013263d; cf. Crat. 385b). He also\ndistinguished negations from affirmations and took the negation\nparticle to have narrow scope: it negates the predicate, not the whole\nsentence (Soph. 257b\u2013c). There are many passages in\nPlato where he struggles to explain certain logical relations:\nfor example his theory that things participate in Forms corresponds to\na rudimentary theory of predication; in the Sophist and\nelsewhere he grapples with the class relations of exclusion, union and\nco-extension; also with the difference between the \u2018is\u2019 of\npredication (being) and the \u2018is\u2019 of identity (sameness);\nand in Republic 4, 436bff., he anticipates the law of\nnon-contradiction. But his explications of these logical questions are\ncast in metaphysical terms, and so can at most be regarded as\nproto-logical.\n",
