    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Reparations\n3.7 Reparations\n\nThe term \u2018reparations\u2019 has been used more and less broadly\nto refer to efforts to repair the harm that results from a wrong or\nconflict. A narrow use of the term refers to a transfer of land,\ngoods, or wealth that is intended to directly compensate for goods\nthat were taken, damaged or destroyed. The payment is made either by\nthe party who was responsible for the harm, by the wrongdoers\u2019\ndescendants or other beneficiaries, or potentially by a third party\nacting on the wrongdoers\u2019 behalf. This sort of transfer is\nperhaps better labeled \u2018restitution.\u2019 Transfers made in\nresponse to losses that are not literally replaceable or monetizable,\nsuch as deaths or injuries, are also referred to as restitution or\nreparation. A still broader use of the term includes material\ntransfers that have a more purely symbolic function. These payments\nare meant to send a conciliatory message of some sort rather than to\nsuggest that the wrong or harm is being paid back. One friend\u2019s\ngift to another after a quarrel could be an example of a symbolic\nreparation in everyday life. So could investments in the economy of a\nformer foe. The term \u2018reparations\u2019 is also used even more\nbroadly to include acts other than material transfers, such as\napologies or instances of truth-telling (Torpey 2003, Walker\n2010).\n\nAs we will discuss further in section 4, arguments for material\ntransfers may appeal directly to principles of corrective justice.\nThose commentators who defend material reparations in the name of\nreconciliation frequently interpret such payments as acknowledgements\nof responsibility, expressions of respect for the moral status of the\nvictims, acts of remorse or caring, evidence of increased\ntrustworthiness or a recommitment to the norms of justice (Thompson\n2002, Brooks 2004, Gray 2010, Walker 2010). Yet the meanings of\nreparations can change, be undermined or repudiated, depending on the\nmanner and context in which they are offered (Brooks 1999, Barkan\n2000, de Greiff 2006). Still, when combined with apologies,\ntruth-telling, and other measures, reparations have the potential to\nimprove relations. Perhaps more importantly, leaving identifiable\nharms uncompensated may undermine the effectiveness of apologies and\nother efforts to reconcile.\n\nReparations for historical injustice are particularly controversial.\nOne ongoing debate concerns the guilt or liability of those who would\npay, the claim-rights and connection to the victims of those who would\nreceive payment, and the difficulty in calculating the proper sum of\nrestitution (Waldron 1992, Wheeler 1997, Boxill 2003). Such debates\nsuggest that reparations are being interpreted as restitution, where\nthe legalistic logic of property rights and inheritance are paramount,\nrather than under the broader project of repairing relationships\n(Thompson 2002, Brooks 2004).\n\nVictims and their descendants, for their part, sometimes worry that\naccepting reparation payments may be seen as drawing a line under the\npast, as implying the moral debt is paid or that all is forgiven\n(Barkan 2000). They also object to the suggestion that the people and\nother valuable things lost could be repaid by money or other material\ngoods.\n",
