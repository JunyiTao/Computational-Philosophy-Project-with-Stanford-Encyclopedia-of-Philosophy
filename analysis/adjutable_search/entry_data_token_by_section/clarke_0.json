    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nSamuel Clarke was born on October 11, 1675, in Norwich, England to\nEdward Clarke (a cloth merchant, alderman, and representative in\nParliament) and Hannah, daughter of Samuel Parmenter, a merchant\n(Hoadly 1730, i). He took his B.A. degree at Cambridge in 1695 by\ndefending Newton\u2019s views, which were not yet widely accepted.\nHis oral defense \u201csuprized the Whole Audience, both for the\nAccuracy of Knowledge, and Clearness of Expression, that appeared\nthrough the Whole\u201d (Hoadly 1730, iii-iv).\n\nHis tutor, Sir John Ellis, a Cartesian, apparently encouraged Clarke\nto provide a new annotated Latin translation of\nRohault\u2019s Treatise of Physics. The 1697 translation\nincluded Clarke\u2019s Newtonian notes that criticized\nRohault\u2019s Cartesian text. The edition\u2019s success rapidly\nexpanded the understanding of Newtonian physics, and later editions\nbecame the standard physics textbook in England. In that same year,\nClarke befriended William Whiston, who probably introduced Clarke into\nthe Newtonian circle. These early years show Clarke\u2019s interest in\ntheology as well; he published Three practical essays on baptism,\nconfirmation, and repentance (1699), A Paraphrase on the Four\nEvangelists (1701\u20131702), and Some Reflections on that\nPart of a Book called Amyntor (1699), a response to John\nToland\u2019s critique of the New Testament canon. These all\ndemonstrate Clarke\u2019s early interest in \u201cprimitive Christianity\u201d\n(Christianity as practiced and believed in its first two hundred\nyears), which would be central to his theological vision and would\nlead to the confrontations over the doctrine of the trinity in the\n1710s.\n\nThe middle years of his career mark his greatest philosophical\ncontributions, beginning with the Boyle lectures (delivered 1704 and\n1705). The first, an attempt to prove the existence of God, along with\nall divine attributes, was published as A Demonstration of the\nBeing and Attributes of God (1705) and the second, a continuation\nintended to establish all fundamental moral truths and most religious\ndoctrine, as A discourse concerning the unchangeable obligations\nof natural religion, and the truth and certainty of the Christian\nrevelation (1706). They both went through many editions and were\noften published together. These lectures, established by Robert Boyle\nto promote natural religion based on the latest scientific\ndevelopments, were closely watched, and Clarke instantly became one of\nthe most well known philosophers in England. Also in 1706, his\nassociation with Newton became official when he translated the\nOpticks into Latin. In the meantime, he had been introduced\nto Queen Anne, who made him one of her chaplains in 1706, and three\nyears later he was elevated to the rectory of St. James\u2019s,\nWestminster. After the Hanoverian accession, Clarke developed a close\nrelationship with Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales and\nfuture queen. His prominence as a philosopher drew him into a series\nof very public exchanges of letters. The most notable of these were\nthe letters to Anthony Collins (1707\u20131708) and the letters to\nLeibniz (1715\u20131716) (see below).\n\nIn the later years of his life, Clarke published popular works of\ntheology, notable translations of Caesar, and a royally appointed\ntranslation of the Iliad. Each of his major publications went\nthrough multiple editions, often with substantial revision. He died in\n1729 after a very short illness, consistent with a stroke (Sykes 1729,\n10). He was survived by his wife Katherine and five of his seven\nchildren. Clarke was a polite and courtly man, vivacious with his\nfriends, and reportedly fond of playing cards.\n",
