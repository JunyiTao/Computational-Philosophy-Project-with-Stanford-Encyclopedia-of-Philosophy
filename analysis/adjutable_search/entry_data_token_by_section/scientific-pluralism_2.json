    "main_text": "Theories, models, and explanations || Intertheoretic Reduction and Antireductionism\n2.1 Intertheoretic Reduction and Antireductionism\n\nScientific pluralism is often motivated by opposition to reductionism\nas the idea that unity of science is achieved through the reduction of\ndifferent levels of organization. In its most straightforward\nintuitive formulation, reductionism assumes that the world is\norganized in different physical, chemical, biological, psychological,\nand social levels that correspond to different scientific disciplines.\nThese levels are reducible in the sense that social theories can be\nderived from psychological theories, psychological theories can be\nderived from biological theories, and so on. At least in principle,\neverything can therefore be derived from microphysical theories and\nthe only barriers are limited computing power and limited cognitive\ncapacities of humans.\n\nDebates about theory reduction in early post-war philosophy of science\nsuggested that this intuitive formulation required further nuance but\nalso that it captured important insight about the structure of\nscience. Rather than questioning the focus on intertheoretical\nreduction, much of the debate focused on specifying increasingly\ncomplex accounts of the relations between theories across different\nlevels of organization (Oppenheim & Putnam 1958; E. Nagel 1961;\nSchaffner 1967). In contrast, scientific pluralists challenged\nreductionism as fundamentally misrepresenting the relation between\nscientific theories and levels of organization. Pluralist challenges\nlargely emerged in the context of wider scientific developments of the\npost-war period. For example, reductionist appeals to unification\nseemed to clash with the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d of the\n1960s and the rapid development of new scientific fields such as\nartificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and generative\nlinguistics (Gardner 1987). The cognitive revolution seemed to\nhighlight that science does not progress through unification but\nrather through the emergence of novel fields that further proliferate\nthe diversity of scientific concepts, methods, and theories.\n\nBeyond this apparent tension between ideals of reduction and the\nreality of scientific diversification, pluralist philosophers\nemphasized the difficulties of applying reductionist frameworks. For\nexample, consider the assumption that psychological theories reduce to\nbiological theories or the related metaphysical claim that cognitive\nprocesses are ultimately nothing but brain processes. How can such a\nreductionism accommodate the development of artificial intelligence\nand the idea that cognitive processes could also be realized in\nsystems that are not constituted by organic compounds at all? How can\nit accommodate the evolution of biological species with very different\nbrain architectures or even the possibility of life on other planets\nthat realize cognitive processes in radically different ways? This\nproblem of \u201cmultiple realization\u201d (R. C. Richardson 2009)\ndid not merely appear in the cognitive sciences but also extends to\nother fields such as economics. For example, a generalization in\neconomics may provide interesting insights about patterns in the\nsocial world but not correspond to unified physical generalizations or\neven strict physical laws. According to Fodor (1974), economic events\ncan be realized through vastly different structures \u201cwhose\nphysical descriptions have nothing in common\u201d (1974: 103) and\nthe reductionist program of unification at the level of microphysics\nis therefore doomed to fail.\n\nSome pluralist frameworks articulate epistemological theses about the\ndisunity of scientific theories\u2014higher-level theories cannot\nalways be derived from lower-level theories (Fodor 1974). Other\npluralist formulations are more explicitly metaphysical in appealing\nto a \u201cdisorder of things\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 1993) and a\n\u201cdappled world\u201d (Cartwright 1999) that characterize the\nworld and not merely scientific theories as disunified. The idea of a\ndappled world also extends antireductionism from vertical to\nhorizontal levels. Reductionism fails not only in relating different\nlevels of organization but also as a thesis stating that a law can\napply to every phenomenon that falls in its domain. In physics for\ninstance, Newton\u2019s laws may apply successfully to orderly\nsystems as the ones we set up in the highly-controlled environments of\nour laboratories (e.g., a harmonic oscillator), but it would partake\nof an article of faith to believe that Newton\u2019s laws apply to\nany real-world system. Making instead the case for a \u201cdappled\nworld\u201d, that is, a world displaying both nomologically ordered\nsystems and unruly ones, Cartwright (1999) invites scientists to\nresist methodological inclinations for generality and reductionist\napproaches.\n\nControversies about reductionism have been formative of scientific\npluralism and served as a focal point for the articulation of general\npluralist epistemological and metaphysical frameworks. The fading of\nreductionism as a general ideology in philosophy of science, however,\nhas also shifted the attention of many pluralists away from\nintertheoretic reduction towards heterogenous relations between\nexplanations, aims, models, practices, and institutions in scientific\npractice. In some cases, this shift towards \u201cphilosophy of\nscience in practice\u201d (Ankeny et al. 2011) has led to challenges\nnot only of reductionism but also of antireductionism as a general\naccount of the relations between scientific theories. Some pluralists\ntherefore advocate for \u201cmetaphysical abstinence\u201d (Ruphy\n2005) in the sense that pluralists should make temporally qualified\narguments in specific settings of scientific practice rather than\nformulating pluralism as a general account of the structure of science\nthat is grounded in a general metaphysics of disunity.\n",
