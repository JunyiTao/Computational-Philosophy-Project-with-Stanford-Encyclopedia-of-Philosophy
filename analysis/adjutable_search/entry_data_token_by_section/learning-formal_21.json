Let \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) be a set of empirical hypotheses. Then\nthere is a method that reliably identifies a correct hypothesis from\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) in the limit with at most n mind changes if and only if the\nelimination procedure defined above terminates with an empty set of\nhypotheses after n stages.\n\n\nThus for an inductive problem to be solvable with at most \\(n\\)\nmind changes, the maximum simplicity rank of any possible hypothesis\nis \\(n.\\) In the Riddle of Induction, the maximum simplicity rank\nis 1, and therefore this problem can be solved with at most 1 mind\nchange. The next result provides an Ockham theorem connecting\nsimplicity and mind change performance.\n\n\nOckham Theorem. Let \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) be a set of empirical hypotheses\nwith optimal mind change bound n. Then an inductive method is mind\nchange optimal if and only if it satisfies the following\nconditions.\n\nWhenever the method adopts one of the hypotheses from \\(\\mathbf{H},\\)\nthis hypothesis is the uniquely simplest one consistent with the\nevidence.\nIf the method changes its mind at inquiry time \\(t+1\\), the\nuniquely simplest hypothesis at time \\(t\\) is falsified at time\n\\(t+1.\\)\n\n\n\nThis theorem says that a mind-change optimal method may withhold a\nconjecture as a skeptic would, but if it does adopt a definite\nhypothesis, the hypothesis must be the simplest one, in the sense of\nhaving the maximum simplicity rank. Thus the mind change optimal\nmethods discussed in\n Section 4\n are all Ockham methods that adopt the simplest hypothesis consistent\nwith the data. The Ockham theorem shows a remarkable reversal from the\nlong-standing objection that long-run reliability imposes too few\nconstraints on short-run conjectures: If we add to long-run\nconvergence to the truth the goal of achieving stable belief, then in\nfact there is a unique inductive method that achieves this goal\nin a given empirical problem. Thus the methodological analysis\nswitches from offering no short-run prescriptions to offering a\ncomplete prescription.\n",
