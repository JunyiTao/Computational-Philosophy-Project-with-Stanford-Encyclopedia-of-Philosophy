    "main_text": "Individually-Based Accounts and Radical Cognitive Disability: The Challenge of Exclusion || Identifying More Inclusive Attributes\n4.1 Identifying More Inclusive Attributes\n\nSeveral accounts identify attributes, such as the capacity to value or\ncare, that are shared by a greater proportion of human beings than\nself-consciousness, practical rationality, autonomy, or moral\naccountability. These accounts seek to recognize the full and equal\nmoral status of all, or almost all, human beings, including children,\nand of adults with significant cognitive and psychological\ndisabilities. Among the more inclusive criteria proposed are the\ncapacities to communicate, or for minimal communication with other\nhumans (respectively, Berube 1996; Francis and Norman 1978); to value\nor care (Jaworska 1999, 2007); and to give and receive love (Kittay\n1999); to form relationships characterized by reciprocity of care\n(Mullin 2011). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2016 a, 2016b offer perhaps\nthe most detailed account that grounds moral status in the capacity to\nform morally significant relationships. They maintain that \u201ca\nbeing merits higher moral status\u201d if it has the capacity to\nachieve, through a rearing relationship, \u201cincomplete\nrealizations of activities characteristic of\u201d humans with\ntypical psychological attributes (whom they call \u201cself-standing\npersons\u201d (SSP)) (2016b, 1098). An actual rearing relationship is\nnot necessary, but only beings who can model Characteristic SSP\nactivities have the requisite capacity. This excludes humans\n\u201ccapable of rudimentary conscious activity who nonetheless are\nnot yet capable of modeling SSP activities in any form\u201d (2016b,\n1101)\u2014not only early fetuses but children and adults with the\nmost significant cognitive impairments, who will never have that\ncapacity.\n\nThese accounts are attractive in identifying attributes that may offer\na more intuitively appealing basis for moral status than practical\nrationality or self-awareness, and in reducing, to varying extents,\nthe proportion of humanity excluded from full moral status. But\nbecause they exclude some humans, and may include some non-human\nanimals, they do not fully capture commonsense views about moral\nstatus and will be unacceptable to some philosophers. Moreover, these\nalternative attributes do not resolve, but merely relocate, the\nproblem of accounting for the threshold and range features of full\nmoral status.\n\nOne attribute\u2014the potential for any other individual\nattribute held to suffice for full moral status\u2014comes much\ncloser to full inclusion (Kumar 2008). But it faces three formidable\nproblems. As Joel Feinberg (1986) famously argued, the fact that\nsomeone has the mere potential for an attribute does not warrant\ntreating him as if he actually possessed it. If potential has moral\nsignificance, it cannot be directly inferred from the moral\nsignificance of that which it actualizes. Further, some human beings\nnever have the potential for any individual attribute held to suffice\nfor full moral status, in any sense of \u201cpotential\u201d that\nwould distinguish them from many non-human animals (McMahan 2008,\n91\u201392). As debates about the moral status of the fetus suggest,\nit is not at all clear when a being has the \u201cpotential\u201d\nfor an attribute. The claim that someone has potential is a\ncounterfactual: in some other circumstances, perhaps a later\nlife-stage of the individual, the person would have the attribute.\nThis brings in difficult questions about the scope of such\ncounterfactuals. On a broad enough construal, every living being has\nthe potential to develop the relevant attributes in a sufficiently\ndifferent possible world, and so has full moral\n status.[8]\n\n\nMatthew Liao has argued for \u201cthe genetic basis for moral\nagency\u201d as a sufficient condition for full moral status that is\nmore plausible and inclusive than a potentiality criterion (Liao\n2010). It accords full moral status to humans who have lost the\npotential for agency, and to radically disabled humans who never had\nsuch potential, in any conventional sense of that term. But it\nincludes these individuals at the cost of including almost all human\nembryos\u2014a cost many would consider excessive. Moreover,\nLiao\u2019s account requires a conceptually difficult, morally\nuncertain distinction between genomes that have and lack \u201cthe basis\nfor moral agency\u201d (e.g., Wasserman 2002; McMahan 2002, 2008).\nPotentiality accounts face similar line-drawing problems; the question\nis whether the shift from \u201cpotential\u201d to \u201cgenetic basis\u201d makes\nthose problems any more tractable. The genetic basis account also\nshares what many would regard as a problem of \u201cover\ninclusiveness\u201d\u2014they confer moral status on early embryos, which\nhave the genetic basis for moral agency, at least as clearly as they\nhave the potential for it. To justify abortion, proponents of either\naccount must rely on a woman\u2019s right to withdraw gestational\naid.\n\nThese challenges are inherited by two accounts that seek to base moral\nstatus on the possession of a \u201cmodal property.\u201d Shelley Kagan\n(2016) and Jonathan Surovell (forthcoming) argue that beings who had,\nor could have had, the psychological capacities of typical human\nbeings are their moral equals. According to both accounts, human\nbeings who lost, or never had, those capacities due to illness or\nimpairment still have the modal property that they could have had\nthem, and this property confers full moral status. That property is\nnot possessed by members of most other species, who could only have\nacquired those capacities in quite distant possible worlds. As\nSurovell puts it, \u201c[d]isability but not species membership is a\nmatter of luck\u201d (21).\n\nThese accounts face much the same challenge as Liao\u2019s, of\ndetermining whether a given being \u201ccould have\u201d developed the\npsychological capacities of human beings when their failure to do so\nresults from genetic differences. They also face the challenge posed\nby members of other species capable of identity-preserving cognitive\nupgrades (DeGrazia, 2016; McMahan, 2016). But perhaps the strongest\nobjection to grounding moral status in modal properties is raised by\nDeGrazia: even if human beings with profound cognitive impairments are\naptly characterized as victims of bad luck, why does their victimhood\nconfer moral status? Surely that status cannot be justified as a\nconsolation prize for a near miss. While this objection does not\ndirectly apply to the genetic-basis account, that account faces the\nquestion of why the biological basis for morally significant\nattributes itself has moral significance.\n",
