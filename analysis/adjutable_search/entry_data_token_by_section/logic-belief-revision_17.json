    "main_text": "Other operations || Shielded contraction\n6.5 Shielded contraction\n\nThe Success postulate of contraction requires that all\nnon-tautological beliefs are retractable. This is not a fully\nrealistic requirement, since actual agents are known to have beliefs\nof a non-logical nature that nothing can bring them to give up. In\nshielded contraction, some non-tautological beliefs cannot be given\nup; they are shielded from contraction. Shielded contraction can be\nbased on an ordinary contraction \\(\\div\\) and a set \\(R\\) of\nretractable sentences. If \\(p \\in R\\), then \\(K-p = K\\div p\\).\nOtherwise, \\(K-p = K\\).\n\nThis construction can be further specified by adding various\nrequirements on the structure of \\(R\\). Close connections have been\nshown to hold between shielded contraction and semi-revision.\n(Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2001)\n",
