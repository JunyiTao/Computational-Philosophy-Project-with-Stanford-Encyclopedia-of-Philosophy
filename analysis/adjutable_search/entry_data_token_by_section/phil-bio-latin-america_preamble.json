    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of biology is a sub-discipline within philosophy of\nscience, and it became professionalized and institutionalized in\nregions like the United States, Canada, and Europe during the 1970s\nand 1980s. In Latin America, this process began a decade later, after\na long period of early history from the colonial period to the\nmid-twentieth century. The professionalization and\ninstitutionalization of philosophy of science, including the\ngermination of philosophy of biology, took place between the\nmid-twentieth century and the 1980s\u20131990s. Since then, the field\nof philosophy of biology grew consistently in Latin America, with\ncontributions of international impact.\n\nThis article provides an overview of the work done on three topics\nthat are most characteristic of how philosophy of biology has\ndeveloped in the subcontinent. The themes chosen are the analysis of\nthe concept of race, the analysis of biological theories, and\ndifferent ways of relating philosophy of biology with history of\nbiology. The main focus is placed on contributions that thinkers\nliving in Latin America have made to philosophy of biology, most of\nthem born in the region. We will also review contributions made by\nLatin American thinkers working outside the region.\n\nThis entry has six parts. Sections 1 and 2 provide context for the\nremainder of the entry. Section 1 gives a brief introduction to\nphilosophy of biology, and Section 2 provides historical background\nand general characteristics of philosophy of biology in Latin America.\nSections 3 through 5 are devoted to the three topics mentioned above:\nSection 3 to the theme of race, Section 4 to the issue of the nature,\nstructure, and function of biological theories, and Section 5 to the\nstrong connection to history of biology. Section 6 offers final\nthoughts and considers some future prospects for philosophy of biology\nin Latin America.\n",
