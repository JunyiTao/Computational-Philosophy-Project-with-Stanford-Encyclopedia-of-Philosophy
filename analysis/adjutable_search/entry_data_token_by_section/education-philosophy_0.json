Problems in Delineating the Field\n\nThe inward/outward looking nature of the field of philosophy of\neducation alluded to above makes the task of delineating the field, of\ngiving an over-all picture of the intellectual landscape, somewhat\ncomplicated (for a detailed account of this topography, see Phillips\n1985, 2010). Suffice it to say that some philosophers, as well as\nfocusing inward on the abstract philosophical issues that concern\nthem, are drawn outwards to discuss or comment on issues that are more\ncommonly regarded as falling within the purview of professional\neducators, educational researchers, policy-makers and the like. (An\nexample is Michael Scriven, who in his early career was a prominent\nphilosopher of science; later he became a central figure in the\ndevelopment of the field of evaluation of educational and social\nprograms. See Scriven 1991a, 1991b.) At the same time, there are\nprofessionals in the educational or closely related spheres who are\ndrawn to discuss one or another of the philosophical issues that they\nencounter in the course of their work. (An example here is the\nbehaviorist psychologist B.F. Skinner, the central figure in the\ndevelopment of operant conditioning and programmed learning, who in\nworks such as Walden Two (1948) and Beyond Freedom and\nDignity (1972) grappled\u2014albeit controversially\u2014with\nmajor philosophical issues that were related to his work.) \n\nWhat makes the field even more amorphous is the existence of works on\neducational topics, written by well-regarded philosophers who have\nmade major contributions to their discipline; these educational\nreflections have little or no philosophical content, illustrating the\ntruth that philosophers do not always write philosophy. However,\ndespite this, works in this genre have often been treated as\ncontributions to philosophy of education. (Examples include John\nLocke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning Education [1693] and\nBertrand Russell\u2019s rollicking pieces written primarily to raise\nfunds to support a progressive school he ran with his \nwife. (See Park 1965.)\n\nFinally, as indicated earlier, the domain of education is vast, the\nissues it raises are almost overwhelmingly numerous and are of great\ncomplexity, and the social significance of the field is second to\nnone. These features make the phenomena and problems of education of\ngreat interest to a wide range of socially-concerned intellectuals,\nwho bring with them their own favored conceptual\nframeworks\u2014concepts, theories and ideologies, methods of\nanalysis and argumentation, metaphysical and other assumptions, and\nthe like. It is not surprising that scholars who work in this broad\ngenre also find a home in the field of philosophy of education.\n\nAs a result of these various factors, the significant intellectual and\nsocial trends of the past few centuries, together with the significant\ndevelopments in philosophy, all have had an impact on the content of\narguments and methods of argumentation in philosophy of\neducation\u2014Marxism, psycho-analysis, existentialism,\nphenomenology, positivism, post-modernism, pragmatism, neo-liberalism,\nthe several waves of feminism, analytic philosophy in both its\nordinary language and more formal guises, are merely the tip of the\niceberg.\n",
