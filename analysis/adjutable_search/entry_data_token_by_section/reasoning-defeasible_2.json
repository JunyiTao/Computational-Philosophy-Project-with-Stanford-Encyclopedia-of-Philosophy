    "main_text": "History || Artificial Intelligence\n1.2 Artificial Intelligence\n\nAs the subdiscipline of artificial intelligence took shape in the\n1960s, pioneers like John M. McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes soon\ndiscovered the need to represent and implement the sort of defeasible\nreasoning that had been identified by Aristotle and Chisholm. McCarthy\nand Hayes (McCarthy and Hayes 1969) developed a formal language they\ncalled the \u201csituation calculus,\u201d for use by expert systems\nattempting to model changes and interactions among a domain of objects\nand actors. McCarthy and Hayes encountered what they called the\nframe problem: the problem of deciding which conditions will\nnot change in the wake of an event. They required a\ndefeasible principle of inertia: the presumption that any given\ncondition will not change, unless required to do so by actual events\nand dynamic laws. In addition, they encountered the qualification\nproblem: the need for a presumption that an action can be\nsuccessfully performed, once a short list of essential prerequisites\nhave been met. McCarthy (McCarthy 1977, 1038\u20131044) suggested\nthat the solution lay in a logical principle of\ncircumscription: the presumption that the actual situation is\nas unencumbered with abnormalities and oddities (including unexplained\nchanges and unexpected interferences) as is consistent with our\nknowledge of it. (McCarthy 1982; McCarthy 1986) In effect, McCarthy\nsuggests that it is warranted to believe whatever is true in all the\nminimal (or otherwise preferred) models of\none\u2019s initial information set.\n\nIn the early 1980s, several systems of defeasible reasoning were\nproposed by others in the field of artificial intelligence: Ray\nReiter\u2019s default logic (Reiter 1980; Etherington and Reiter\n1983, 104\u2013108), McDermott and Doyle\u2019s Non-Monotonic Logic\nI (McDermott and Doyle, 1982), Robert C. Moore\u2019s Autoepistemic\nLogic (Moore 1985), and Hector Levesque\u2019s formalization of the\n\u201call I know\u201d operator (Levesque 1990). These early\nproposals involved the search for a kind of fixed point or\ncognitive equilibrium. Special rules (called default rules by\nReiter) permit drawing certain conclusions so long as these\nconclusions are consistent with what one knows, including all that one\nknows on the basis of these very default rules. In some cases, no such\nfixed point exists, and, in others, there are multiple, mutually\ninconsistent fixed points. In addition, these systems were procedural\nor computational in nature, in contrast to the semantic\ncharacterization of warranted conclusions (in terms of preferred\nmodels) in McCarthy\u2019s circumscription system. Later work in\nartificial intelligence has tended to follow McCarthy\u2019s lead in\nthis respect.\n",
