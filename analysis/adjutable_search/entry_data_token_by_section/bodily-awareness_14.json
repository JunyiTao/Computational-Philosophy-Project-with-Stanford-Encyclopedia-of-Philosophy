    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership || The deflationary conception\n4.2 The deflationary conception\n\nAccording to what Berm\u00fadez (2011: 167) calls the deflationary\nconception, \n\n\nthe sense of ownership consists, first, in certain facts about the\nphenomenology of bodily sensations and, second, in certain fairly\nobvious judgments about the body (which we can term judgments of\nownership). \n\n\nLikewise, Martin (1995: 278) states that the sense of ownership is not\nan additional quality to the sensory qualities of bodily experiences\nand that it is \u201csomehow already inherent within them\u201d. For\ninstance, in the rubber hand illusion participants do not report only\nownership towards the rubber hand, but also referred tactile\nsensations on the fake hand. One may then argue that experiencing the\nrubber hand as one\u2019s own is nothing more than feeling sensations\nin it (Wu forthcoming). One intuitive way to spell out the\ndeflationary conception is indeed in spatial terms: \u201cwhen one\nfeels a bodily sensation to have a location there is no issue over\nwhose body it appears to belong to\u201d (Martin 1992: 201). Martin\nclaims that the spatial phenomenology can account for the sense of\nownership because there is an identity between one\u2019s own body\nand the body in which one locates bodily experiences. According to the\nsole-object view that he defends, for an instance of bodily experience\nto count as an instance of perception, it must indeed be an experience\nof what is in fact the subject\u2019s actual body. However, one can\nbe aware of the boundaries of one\u2019s body without being aware of\nthe boundaries of one\u2019s body qua one\u2019s own (Dokic\n2003; Serrahima forthcoming). A further problem for all\ndeflationary conceptions comes from dissociation between bodily\nsensations and the sense of ownership. They indeed\npredict that it is inconceivable for one to experience sensations in a\nlimb and fail to experience this limb as one\u2019s own (Martin 1995;\nDokic 2003). However, it has been found that patients with\ndisownership syndromes can still experience some bodily experiences\n(e.g., Moro et al. 2004). The question then is whether this type of results can\ninvalidate the deflationary conception or not (Bradley\nforthcoming).\n",
