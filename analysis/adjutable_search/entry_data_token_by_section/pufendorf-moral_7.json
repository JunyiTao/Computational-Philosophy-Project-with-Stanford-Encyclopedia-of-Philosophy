    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Types of Duties\n3.5 Types of Duties\n\nToward the end of his discussion of the natural law\u2019s main\nprinciple, Pufendorf joins Hobbes in subsuming international (ius\ngentium) under natural law (DJN II.3.23) \u2013 which is\ncritical for understanding both \u2013 and makes some distinctions\nthat shape the rest of the work (Reibstein 1955, Seidler 2015). Like\nGrotius, he contrasts \u201cmatters which the natural law disposes by\ndirect precept or prohibition from those that reason has\npersuaded men to institute on account of sociality, or that may be\nundertaken by virtue of a license flowing directly from these\ninstitutions \u2013 in which case they are said to have a\nreductive relation to the natural law\u201d (DJN II.3.22;\nPufendorf 1994a, p. 156; emphasis added). More formatively, he divides\nthe law\u2019s injunctions \u2013 loosely reflecting the divisions\nof the natural state \u2013 into those toward God (adversus\nDeum), toward ourselves (adversus seipsum), and toward\nother humans (adversus alios homines). The first category is\ntreated separately in the pedagogically oriented DO (I.4), written\nwhile Pufendorf was fighting charges of atheism in Lund. However, DJN\n(II.4.3\u20134, III.4.4) folds it into the second group, particularly\nthe law\u2019s (i.e., God\u2019s) command that we cultivate our\nminds by developing appropriate beliefs about God through careful\nconsideration of the supposedly convincing arguments of natural\ntheology \u2013 a strategy that recalls the difficulties noted above.\nThe third category\u2019s precepts regarding other humans are divided\ninto absolute and hypothetical injunctions, the former obligating all\nmen and women as such, whatever their status, and the latter \u2013\nas in the direct/reductive distinction above \u2013 presupposing\ncertain states or institutions introduced by them (DJN II.3.24).\nHypothetical injunctions are also distinguished from positive civil\nlaws that may appeal to them for justification, even if based on\nparticular states\u2019 advantage or specific legislators\u2019\nvolitions. The three most important human institutions governed by\nhypothetical laws of nature are speech, dominion over things\n(property) and price (the valuation of things), and human sovereignty\n(including the civil state) \u2013 the subjects of DJN IV\u2013V and\nVI\u2013VIII. Book II concludes with three more chapters treating the\nvarious duties toward ourselves (II.4), the right and limits of\nself-defense (II.5), and the right of necessity (II.6).\n\nBefore turning to various categories of hypothetical duties in Book\nIII, Pufendorf examines several absolute requirements toward other\nhumans. The first is the prime natural law directive \u2013 also\nfound in Grotius and Hobbes \u2013 without which social life could\nnot exist: that no one should injure another and, if they have, that\nreparation should be made (DJN III.1). Second, since injury can be\ndone to others not only by damaging their bodies or things, but also\ntheir self-esteem, humans must show mutual respect and treat one\nanother as natural equals: for \u201cone cannot lead a social life\nwith someone by whom one is not esteemed at least as a man,\n\u2026\u201d (DJN III.2.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 159). The basis of\nthis requirement is not human nature regarded metaphysically (or\ntranscendentally) as an absolute value, but a so-called equality of\nright or law (ius) consisting merely of our joint obligation\n(per natural law) to cultivate a social life (DJN III.2.2; (Fiorillo\n2013a, Saastamoinen 2010, Haakonssen 2011). Human moral equality so\nconceived also leads Pufendorf to reject the notion of natural\nslavery, even though he allows its compatibility with certain kinds of\ncontractual subjection in both pre-civil and civil society (DJN\nIII.2.8\u20139). Third, beside observing the minimalist requirements\nnot to injure or insult others, Pufendorf notes, one must also seek to\nbenefit them, \u201cso that I am glad that others who share my nature\nalso live upon this earth\u201d (DJN III.3.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p.\n165). This introduces the important distinction between perfect and\nimperfect duties, the latter consisting of so-called duties of\nhumanity which, though owed in the same sense as perfect duties,\ncannot be compelled. There are a number of interesting discussions\nhere, addressing the right of passage \u201cfor legitimate\nreasons\u201d (justas causas, DJN III.3.5), the duty of\nhospitality, and the right of immigration \u2013 some of which recur\nin the fuller treatment of international law at the end of DJN VIII.\nDuties of humanity often depend on special circumstances. Thus,\nPufendorf could consistently approve of Frederick William\u2019s\nliberal (and self-serving) pro-Huguenot immigration policy in\nBrandenburg while supporting Charles XI\u2019s tighter restrictions\nin Sweden (KVS 1995e, pp. 472, 505; Habitu \u00a754, 2002c, pp.\n118\u201321). Moreover, in the immediate context, he disagrees with\nVitoria (DJN III.3.9) by limiting the so-called right of commerce,\nincluding territorial access for such purposes, especially as it was\nused by Europeans in their conquest of America (Cavallar 2002, 2008;\nHunter 2007a).\n\nSince imperfect duties of humanity do not suffice for maintaining\nsocial relations, particularly those involving precise mutual\nexpectations, Pufendorf introduces (DJN III.4) another class of\nabsolute duties arising from pacts among individuals. The natural law\nstipulates no specifics here but merely commands that we enter into\nsome such consensual arrangements, since without them sociality would\nbe hampered and humans remain in the natural state. Pact-generated\nobligations are both adventitious, or based upon some antecedent human\ndeed responding to circumstance, and perfect in the sense of specific\nand compellable. They arise from either unilateral promises or\nbilateral agreements, and they create perfect rights (i.e., justified\nexpectations of exact performance) in others (DJN I.7.7). It appears\nhere that Pufendorf is an obligation theorist in that rights derive\nfrom obligations (DJN III.5.1; cf. VIII.3.5), yet there are also\nrights without corresponding obligations; that is, correlativity\nexists, but incompletely (Mautner 1991, 1989). He also rejects once\nmore Hobbes\u2019s notion of a right to all things and maintains that\nrights claims to natural objects must rest, if they are to have\nnormative force, on the express or tacit consent of others (DJN\nIII.5.2\u20133); that is, they arise out of social interaction and\nare not presupposed by it. Given its importance for the development of\nhuman social life, five more chapters are devoted to the topic of\npromises and pacts: on their nature, subject-matter, types, and\nconditionality, as well as the sorts of individual and collective\nagents capable of generating consent-based obligations by promising or\nagreeing with one another. The discussion as a whole is fundamental to\nthe hypothetical laws of nature articulated in the rest of the work,\nin the context of various consensually created adventitious human\ninstitutions.\n",
