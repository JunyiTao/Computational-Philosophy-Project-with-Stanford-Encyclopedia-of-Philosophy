    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nNot a great deal is known of Robert Alyngton\u2019s life. Most of the\ninformation about him comes from Emden 1957\u201359. From 1379 until\n1386, he was fellow of Queens College (the same Oxonian college where\nWyclif started his theological studies in 1363 and Johannes Sharpe\ntaught in the 1390s); he became Magister Artium and, by 1393,\ndoctor of theology. He was chancellor of the University in 1393 and\n1395. In 1382 he preached Wyclif\u2019s religious and political ideas\nin Hampshire (McHardy 1987). He was rector of Long Whatton,\nLeicestershire, where he died by September 1398. \n\nAccording to Emden 1957\u201359 and Ashworth & Spade 1992,\nAlyngton was of considerable repute as a logician. Among his extant\nworks, the following can be mentioned (the most complete list of his\nwritings is found in Bale 1557\u201359 [pp. 519\u201320]):\n\nA commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n(Litteralis sententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis\n[henceforward In Cat.]), partially edited in Conti 1993 (pp.\n242\u2013306). (All references are to the pages of this edition or,\nfor the unedited portions, to the ms. London, Lambeth Palace\n393.)\nA treatise on the supposition of terms (Tractatus de\nsuppositionibus terminorum).\nA commentary on the Liber sex principiorum.\nA treatise on the genera of being (Tractatus\ngenerum).\n\n",
