If the first ruler is\nexcellent and his rulership truly excellent, then in what he\nprescribes he seeks only to obtain, for himself and for everyone under\nhis rulership, the ultimate happiness that is truly happiness; and\nthat religion will be the excellent religion. (Book of\nReligion 1: 93, slightly modified)\n\n\nAs this quotation amply evinces, al-Farabi has a fairly peculiar\nnotion of religion. First, it embraces \u201copinions\u201d and\n\u201cactions\u201d and, hence, those two elements which, as seen\nabove\n (section 2.2),\n play a significant role in connection with the attainment of\nindividual felicity. Accordingly, human beings need to know certain\nthings (in one of the two mentioned ways) and perform certain actions\nin order to become truly happy. Second, religion is described as the\nresult of a first ruler\u2019s activities. More precisely, this ruler\nis depicted as the one who first established the opinions and actions\nto be held and performed by the community she\n rules.[26]\n Furthermore, in so doing she pursued a specific purpose. In other\nwords, these opinions and actions are supposed to be defended and\ncarried out, not for their own sake, but\u2014provided \u201cthe\nfirst ruler is excellent\u201d\u2014for the sake of ultimate\nhappiness. Religion, therefore, is not a goal in and of itself; it is\nan instrument, more specifically, it is an instrument of\n rulership.[27]\n\nAt first glance, al-Farabi\u2019s concept of religion may appear as\ndepreciative, particularly from the perspective of existing religions,\nsuch as Islam. He bluntly denies religion the status of an autonomous\nsphere of knowledge and wisdom; he rejects its claim to exclusive\ntruth; and he reduces it to a mere tool. However, these features\ncannot be assessed tel quel, but require their specific\ncontext, namely, al-Farabi\u2019s basic ontological and\nepistemological views. According to him, the givens of\nreality\u2014the things constituting reality, their behavior, and the\nunderlying natural laws\u2014are the effects of certain primary\nprinciples, such as intelligence, soul, and matter, which are\nultimately all founded in a single, first cause (cf. above,\n section 2.1).[28]\n These facts now, on al-Farabi\u2019s account, can be known by human\nbeings, just as the moral obligations they entail (as discussed above,\n section 3.1).\n Accordingly, there is one objective reality and, epistemologically,\none objectively true account of it. There are, however, several\nmethods for appropriating this true account and, in turn, imparting it\nto others, namely, \u201ceither \u2026 as [these things] really are\nor \u2026 through affinity and symbolic representation\u201d\n (section 3.2).\n\nPrecisely this latter method of symbolic representation is identified\nwith religion, while its counterpart, teaching and knowing things as\nthey \u201creally are\u201d, corresponds to philosophy. Doubtlessly,\nphilosophy is therefore superior to religion, as is often underscored\nby scholarship and acknowledged by al-Farabi himself (cf. Book of\nReligion 5: 97\u20138). This superiority, however, concerns only\nthe respective epistemic levels. While \u2018philosophy\u2019 is the\nname of a knowledge based on demonstration and resulting in objective\ncertitude, \u2018religion\u2019 is the name for a knowledge based on\ndialectical and rhetorical means and resulting only in probable\nopinion and\n conviction.[29]\n From a pragmatic point of view, by contrast, the coordinate system\nshifts considerably. From this angle, it is religion which turns out\nto be no less important than philosophy, due to the givens of\nanthropology: for by far the majority of people depend on\n\u201csymbolic representation\u201d as the avenue to the knowledge\nand activities required for the attainment of felicity, while only a\nminority can grasp the things as they \u201creally are\u201d.\n\nThe relation of religion to philosophy, therefore, is like the\nrelation of human beings to organisms, and of society to the cosmos:\nthat of similitude\u2014provided, that is, it is an excellent\n religion.[30]\n It is a similitude of philosophy in various respects, on the one\nhand, concerning its immanent structure, on the other, regarding its\nmode of operation. Just like philosophy, it embraces a body of\ntheoretical knowledge (a creed) from which it derives practical rules\n(the law); and just like philosophy, its principal purpose consists in\nteaching and, thus, providing a means of governance to the ruler. From\nthis particular setting it can be concluded that what religion\nteaches, or rather, what the ruler teaches by virtue of religion, is a\nmetaphorical account of what philosophy presents scientifically. This\nis already conspicuous, for example, in the way al-Farabi presents the\ntheoretical doctrines (creed) conveyed by religion:\n\n\nAmong the theoretical [things taught by the excellent religion] are\nthose that describe God, may He be exalted. Then there are some that\ndescribe the spiritual beings, their ranks in themselves, their\nstations in relation to God, may He be exalted \u2026. (Book of\nReligion 2: 94)\n\n\nEven without presenting the entire list, it is obvious that al-Farabi\nrefers to the same issues as those detailed in his Perfect\nState (see\n section 2.2\n above). However, while the Perfect State employed a\nterminology reminiscent of philosophical jargon, the Book of\nReligion falls back on religious terms. Instead of the first\ncause, it speaks of God; instead of cosmology, it refers to theology;\ninstead of the separate intellects, it evokes angels and demons as\nspiritual beings. The same kind of shift can be observed in connection\nwith the activities the excellent religion determines (law):\n\n\nAs for actions, they are, first of all, the actions and speeches by\nwhich God is praised and extolled. Then there are those that praise\nthe spiritual beings and the angels. Then there are those that praise\nthe prophets, the most excellent kings, the righteous rulers, and the\nleaders of the right way who have gone before. (Book of\nReligion 3: 96, slightly modified)\n\n\nOnce again, already the formulas used by al-Farabi to indicate the\ntype of activities determined by religion, without giving a single\nexample, evoke associations with existing religions, particularly,\nIslam. Thus, with God\u2019s praise one will easily connect the five\ndaily prayers demanded of Muslims; the \u201cprophets\u201d,\n\u201crighteous rulers\u201d, and \u201cleaders of the right\nway\u201d are reminiscent of the prophet Mu\u1e25ammad and his\npredecessors; of the first four caliphs; and of either the imams of\nShi\u2018ism or other spiritual leaders of Islam (e.g., sufis).\n\nNotably, in light of the above\n (section 2.2),\n it is evident that a religion\u2019s holy scripture, like the\nQur\u2019an, serves two functions\u2014provided that the respective\nreligion fulfills the excellence criterion. With regard to the\ndoctrines it imparts, it offers a similitude of the objects people\nactually ought to know in order to achieve their natural\n telos.[31]\n As to its practical implications, i.e., the rites and norms it\nconveys, it executes the aforementioned preparatory function: it\ntrains the faithful in a behavior which is suited to foster exactly\nthe same moral virtues as those addressed by the Nicomachean\nEthics and referred to by al-Farabi himself: virtues which\nimprove the soul\u2019s disposition so as to realize, to the best of\none\u2019s capacities, its natural\n ergon.[32]\n",
