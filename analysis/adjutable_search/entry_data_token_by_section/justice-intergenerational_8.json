Egalitarian\nreasons allow us to object to inequalities, for egalitarian reasons\nmake it possible for us to understand relative differences between the\nstates of persons as something \u201cwhich is itself to be eliminated\nor reduced\u201d (Scanlon 2005: 6). We might hold that the standing\nof people relative to their contemporaries is (extrinsically or\nintrinsically) important (see the entry on\n equality)\n and that the threshold notion of harm ought to reflect, say, the\naverage level of well-being that people realize\u2014or that future\npeople will realize: the higher the average level of well-being, the\nhigher the threshold level of harm should be set.\n\nEgalitarian considerations that address relative differences between\npeople can help specify the standard in at least two ways. First,\npresently existing people may be thought to harm future people by\ncausing them to realize a (much) lower level of well-being than their\nown contemporaries (Sher 1979: 389). In addition or alternatively, we\nmight hold that the threshold level ought to reflect, say, the average\nlevel of well-being of the present generations upon whose decisions\nthe well-being of future people depend. According to such an\ninterpretation presently existing people harm future people by causing\nthem to realize a (much) lower level of well-being than they enjoy\nthemselves (see, for example, Barry 1999).\n\nStill, even if egalitarian considerations that reflect a concern with\nthe relative differences between people can contribute to the\nspecification of the threshold, a plausible threshold arguably is not\ngoing to be based on that concern only. Otherwise\u2014this is an\nimplication of the first interpretation\u2014any level of well-being\nwould be considered justified as long as all future people fare\nequally badly. This presupposes attributing intrinsic value\nexclusively to equality\u2014an implausible view (see the entry on\n equality\n and\n \u00a74.2\n below and \u00a74.5\n below). Moreover, to define the\nthreshold standard of well-being of future people as the level of\nwell-being achieved by currently living people (whatever it may be) is\nless than plausible, unless we were to attribute intrinsic value\nexclusively to intergenerational equality, so understood (see Marmor\n2003, Steiner 2003, Raz 2003, Gosepath 2004: 454\u201363; and Holtug\n& Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). This understanding does not only imply\nthat it is worse for future generations to be worse off than the\npresent generation; it also implies that it is, in one respect, worse\nfor future generations to be better off. In the intragenerational\ncontext some philosophers have argued that this implication (the\nrecommendation to \u201clevel down\u201d persons\u2019 well-being)\nis implausible (see Parfit 1997; Raz 1986: 230\u2013235). An\nanalogous objection applies to intergenerational relations as well. It\nis doubtful that a more equal distribution across generations is\nbetter if it came at the cost of some generations being worse off, and\nnone being better off. Under certain circumstances this view would\ndeny that currently living people may stand under a duty of justice\npositively to save for future people so that they will achieve a\nsufficientarian level of well-being (see\n \u00a74.5\n on Rawls\u2019 \u201csavings principle\u201d).\n",
