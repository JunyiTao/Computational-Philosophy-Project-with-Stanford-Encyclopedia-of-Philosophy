    "main_text": "Other Topics in Heritage Ethics || The Ethics of Display\n6.1 The Ethics of Display\n\nBeyond issues concerning the repatriation of art and artifacts,\nfurther ethical questions arise about how cultural heritage that is\nretained in museums should be displayed. These questions play out\nagainst the backdrop of how non-Western artworks have been regarded in\nthe context of Western art institutions, vacillating between\nrelegation to anthropological museums that challenged their art-status\nto de-contextual display in modern art museums that deprived them of\nrelevant cultural context (Eaton & Gaskell 2012). Analogous to\ndebates about cultural appropriation discussed in\n section 4,\n museums are sometimes challenged for misrepresenting non-Western\ncultures, or lacking relevant participation from cultural group\nmembers (Brown 2009). Thus questions arise about the relative value of\ndifferent kinds of knowledge, how they are prioritized by institutions\nclaiming to steward the past, respectful display, and to whom these\ninstitutions are accountable (Wylie 2005; Pantazatos 2016, 2017;\nGaskell 2008).\n",
