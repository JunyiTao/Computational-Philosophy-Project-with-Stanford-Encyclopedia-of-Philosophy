Experimental moral\nphilosophy is the empirical study of moral intuitions, judgments, and\nbehaviors. Like other forms of experimental philosophy, it involves\ngathering data using experimental methods and using these data to\nsubstantiate, undermine, or revise philosophical theories. In this\ncase, the theories in question concern the nature of moral reasoning\nand judgment; the extent and sources of moral obligations; the nature\nof a good person and a good life; even the scope and nature of moral\ntheory itself.

After discussing some strategies for\nanswering this question, the entry examines two of the main projects\nwithin experimental moral philosophy, and then discusses some of the\nmost prominent areas of research within the field.

Introduction and History\n\nThe idea that our actual moral judgments are an important source of\ninformation about the origins and justification of moral norms goes\nback to ancient Greece, if not further. Herodotus recounts a story in\nwhich the Persian emperor Darius invited Greek members of his court\n\u201cand asked them what price would persuade them to eat the dead\nbodies of their fathers. They answered that there was no price for\nwhich they would do it.\u201d Darius then summoned members of a\ndifferent group, \u201cand asked them\u2026 what would make them\nwilling to burn their fathers at death. The Indians cried aloud, that\nhe should not speak of so horrid an act.\u201d Herodotus concludes\nthat stories like these prove that, as the poet Pindar writes,\n\u201ccustom is king of all,\u201d thereby providing an instance of\nthe argument from moral disagreement for relativism. Likewise, in the\nOutlines of Skepticism, Sextus Empiricus stresses that\nempirical discoveries can destabilize our confidence in universal\nmoral agreement:\n\neven if in some cases we cannot see an anomaly, we should say that\npossibly there is dispute about these matters too\u2026 Just as, if\nwe had not, for example, known about the Egyptian custom of marrying\ntheir sisters, we should have affirmed, wrongly, that it is agreed by\nall that you must not marry your sister. (Sextus Empiricus,\nOutlines of Skepticism)\n\n\nWhile the use of empirical observation in moral theory has a long\nhistory, the contemporary movement known as experimental philosophy\ngoes back only a few decades. The current experimental philosophy\nmovement owes its beginnings to the work of Stephen Stich, Shaun\nNichols and Jonathan Weinberg (2001) and Joshua Knobe (2003), but\nthe earliest instance of experimental philosophy may be Truth as\nConceived by Those Who Are Not Professional Philosophers (Naess\n1938), which surveyed ordinary speakers for their intuitions about the\nnature of truth. Contemporary philosophers have not been uniformly\naccepting of the movement, but as we will see, there are reasons to\nthink that experimental evidence might have a distinctive role,\nsignificance, and importance in moral philosophy and theorizing.\n\nThe relationship between more traditional philosophy and experimental\nwork is instructive and brings out some tensions within moral\nphilosophy and theory: namely, morality is at once practical and\nnormative, and these two aspects inform and constrain the extent to\nwhich it is accountable to human psychology.\n\nInsofar as morality is practical, it should be accessible to and\nattainable by agents like us: if a theory is too demanding, or relies\non intuitions, judgments, motivations, or capacities that people do\nnot (or, worse, cannot) possess, we might on those grounds dismiss it.\nOn the other hand, morality is also normative: it aims not just to\ndescribe what we actually do or think, but to guide our practice. For\nthis reason, some philosophers have responded to experimental results\nclaiming to show that attaining and reliably expressing virtues in a\nwide variety of situations is difficult (see section 3.1 below for a\ndiscussion of this literature) by pointing out that the fact that\npeople do not always make the right judgment, or perform actions for\nthe right reasons, does not falsify a theory\u2014it simply shows\nthat people often act in ways that are morally deficient. We will\nreturn to these issues when we discuss criticisms of experimental\nmoral philosophy at the end of this entry; for now, we mention them to\nillustrate that the extent to which experimental moral philosophy\nchallenges traditional philosophical approaches is itself a\ncontroversial issue. Some moral philosophers see themselves as\nderiving moral principles a priori, without appeal to contingent facts\nabout human psychology. Others see themselves as working within a\ntradition, going back at least as far as Aristotle, that conceives of\nethics as the study of human flourishing. These philosophers have not\nnecessarily embraced experimental moral philosophy, but many\npractitioners envision their projects as outgrowths of the\nnaturalistic moral theories developed by Aristotle, Hume, and\nothers.\n1.1 What Are Experiments?\n\nAs the examples discussed above reveal, a variety of types of\nempirical evidence are useful to moral theorizing (see also the\nentries on empirical moral psychology, empirical distributive justice,\nand empirical psychology and character). Anthropological observation\nand data have long played a role in moral philosophy. The\ntwentieth-century moral philosophers John Ladd and Richard Brandt\ninvestigated moral relativism in part by conducting their own\nethnographies in Native American communities. Brandt writes, \u201cWe\nhave\u2026 a question affecting the truth of ethical relativism\nwhich, conceivably, anthropology can help us settle. Does ethnological\nevidence support the view that \u201dqualified persons\u201c can\ndisagree in ethical attitude?\u201d But, he notes, \u201csome kinds\nof anthropological material will not help us\u2014in particular, bare\ninformation about intercultural differences in ethical opinion or\nattitude.\u201d (1952: 238). This is a caveat frequently cited by\nphilosophers engaged in empirical research: it is important to have\nphilosophers participate in experimental design and the gathering of\nempirical data, because there are certain questions that must be\naddressed for the data to have philosophical applications\u2014in\nthis case, whether moral disagreements involve different factual\nbeliefs or other non-moral differences. Barry Hallen (1986, 2000)\nconducted a series of interviews and ethnographies among the Yoruba,\ninvestigating central evaluative concepts and language relating to\nepistemology, aesthetics, and moral value. Hallen was motivated by\nquestions about the indeterminacy of translation, but his work\nprovides an example of how in-depth interviews can inform\ninvestigations of philosophical concepts.\n\nThese examples show that ethnography has a valuable role to play in\nphilosophical theory, but the remainder of this entry will focus\nprimarily on experiments. Paradigmatic experiments involve randomized\nassignment to varying conditions of objects or people from a random\nsample, followed by statistical comparison of the outcomes for each\ncondition. The variation in conditions is sometimes called a\nmanipulation. For example, an experimenter might select a random\nsample of people, randomly assign them either to find or not to find a\ndime in the coin return of a pay phone, and then measure the degree to\nwhich they subsequently help someone they take to be in need (Isen\n& Levin 1972). Finding or not finding the dime is the condition;\ndegree of helpfulness is the outcome variable.\n\nWhile true experiments follow this procedure, other types of studies\nallow non-random assignment to conditions. Astronomers, for example,\nsometimes speak of natural experiments. Although we are in no position\nto affect the motions of heavenly bodies, we can observe them under a\nvariety of conditions, over long periods of time, and with a variety\nof instruments. Likewise, anthropological investigation of different\ncultures\u2019 moral beliefs and practices is unlikely to involve\nmanipulating variables in the lives of the members of the culture, but\nsuch studies are valuable and empirically respectable. Still,\ninferring causation is more difficult with such studies, so the\nevidential value of these studies is often less than that of\nexperiments, at least in this respect; most published research in\nexperimental philosophy involves true experiments.\n\nEven within the category of experiments, we find a lot of diversity\nwith respect to inputs, methods of measurement, and outputs. The\nexperiment just described uses a behavioral measure and\nmanipulation\u2014finding the dime is the input, helping is the\noutcome measured. Other experiments measure not behavior but judgment\nor intuition, and this can be done using a survey or other form of\nself\u2013report or informant\u2013report where subjects respond\nexplicitly to some question, situation, or dilemma. Studies measuring\njudgments might use either manipulations of the condition in which the\nsubject makes the judgment, or they might look for correlations\nbetween judgments and some other factor, such as brain activity,\nemotional response, reaction time, visual attention, and so on\n(Strohminger et al. 2014).\n\nThe experimental methods available have also changed over time.\nSurveys have been the dominant method of experimental philosophy for\nthe past few decades, but technology may change this: advances in\nvirtual and augmented reality mean that philosophers can now immerse\npeople in moral dilemmas such as Thompson\u2019s (1971) violinist\nthought experiment and different versions of the trolley problem\n(e.g., Navarrete et al 2012). Philosophers interested in the neural\ncorrelates of moral judgment can use transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS) to investigate the effects of enhancing or lessening activity in\ncertain areas of the brain. Even survey methods have seen advances\nthanks to technology; the ubiquity of smartphones allows researchers\nto ping people in real time, asking for reports on mood (see section\n3.2 below for a discussion of surveys relating to happiness and\nmood).\n\nWhether experimental moral philosophy has to use true experiments or\ncan include studies and even ethnographies and other forms of\nqualitative data is partly a terminological question about how to\ndefine the field and whether we distinguish it from empirical moral\npsychology, a closely related research program. As we will see below,\nthough, a diversity of both methods and subjects is important in\nhelping experimental moral philosophy respond to its critics.\n1.2 What Types of Questions and Data?\n\nLike experimental philosophy more generally, experimental moral\nphilosophy is interested in our intuitions and judgments about\nphilosophical thought experiments and moral dilemmas. But research in\nthis area also concerns the cognitive architecture underlying our\nmoral judgments; the developmental processes that give rise to moral\njudgments; the neuroscience of moral judgment; and other related\nfields.\n\nDirect experiments investigate whether a claim held (or\ndenied) by philosophers is corroborated or falsified. This might mean\ninvestigating an intuition and whether it is as widely shared as\nphilosophers claim, or it might mean investigating the claim that a\ncertain behavior or trait is widespread or that two factors covary.\nFor example, we find philosophers claiming that it is wrong to\nimprison an innocent person to prevent rioting; that a good life must\nbe authentic; and that moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.\nExperimental research can be (and has been, as we will see below)\nbrought to bear on each of these claims.\n\nIndirect experiments look at the nature of some capacity or\njudgment: for example, whether certain types of moral dilemmas engage\nparticular areas of the brain; how early children develop a capacity\nto empathize; and whether the moral/conventional distinction is\nuniversal across cultures (for discussion of the moral/conventional\ndistinction, see Machery & Stich 2022). These claims have\nphilosophical relevance insofar as they help us understand the nature\nof moral judgment.\n\nIn addition to distinctions involving the type of data and how\ndirectly it bears on the question, we can also distinguish among\nexperimental applied ethics, experimental normative ethics, and\nexperimental metaethics. The first involves the variables that\ninfluence judgments about particular practical problems, such as how a\nself-driving car should respond to sacrificial dilemmas (Bonnefon,\nSharriff & Rahwan 2016). The second involves investigations\nof how we ought to behave, act, and judge, as well as our intuitions\nabout moral responsibility, character, and what constitutes a good\nlife. The third involves debates over moral realism and antirealism.\nIn this entry we focus on the latter two.\n\nIn many of these cases, the line between experimental moral philosophy\nand its neighbors is difficult to draw: what distinguishes\nexperimental moral philosophy from empirical moral psychology? What is\nthe difference between experimental moral philosophy and psychology or\nneuroscience that investigates morality? What is the difference\nbetween experimental moral philosophy and metaethics? We might try to\nanswer these questions by pointing to the training of the\nexperimenters\u2014as philosophers or as scientists\u2014but much of\nthe work in these areas is done by collaborative teams involving both\nphilosophers and social scientists or neuroscientists. In addition,\nsome philosophers work in law and psychology departments, and graduate\nprograms increasingly offer cross-disciplinary training. Another\napproach would be to look at the literature with which the work\nengages: many psychologists (e.g., Haidt, Greene) investigating moral\njudgment situate their arguments within the debate between Kantians\nand Humeans, so engagement with the philosophical tradition might be\nused as a criterion to distinguish experimental moral philosophy from\nexperimental moral psychology. All this said, an inability to sharply\ndistinguish experimental moral philosophy from adjoining areas of\ninvestigation may not be particularly important. Experimental\nphilosophers often point out that the disciplinary divide between\nphilosophy and psychology is a relatively recent phenomenon; early\ntwentieth-century writers such as William James situated themselves in\nboth disciplines, making vital contributions to each. If there is a\nproblem here, it is not unique to experimental moral philosophy. For\nexample, is work on semantics that uses both linguistics and analytic\nphilosophy best understood as linguistics or philosophy of language?\nThese debates arise, and may be largely moot, for many research\nprograms that cut across disciplinary boundaries.\n\nThe rest of this entry proceeds as follows. Section 2 canvasses\nexperimental research on moral judgments and intuitions, describing\nvarious programmatic uses to which experimental results have been put,\nthen turning to examples of experimental research on moral judgment\nand intuition, including intuitions about intentionality and\nresponsibility, the so-called linguistic analogy, and some\ncross-cultural work. Section 3 discusses experimental results on thick\n(i.e., simultaneously descriptive and normative) topics, including\ncharacter and virtue, well-being, emotion and affect, and moral\nstanding. Section 4 discusses questions about moral disagreement and\nmoral language, both important sources of evidence in the longstanding\ndebate over moral objectivity. Section 5 considers some objections to\nexperimental moral philosophy.\n2. Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis\n\nOne role for experiments in moral philosophy, as indicated above, is\nto investigate our moral intuitions about cases, and to use the\nresults gleaned from such investigations to guide or constrain our\nmoral metaphysics, semantics, or epistemology. Philosophers often rely\non such judgments\u2014in the form of claims to the effect that\n\u201cwe would judge x\u201d or, \u201cintuitively,\nx\u201d\u2014as data or evidence for a theory (though see Cappelen\n2012, Deutsch 2016, and Machery 2017 for critical discussion of this\npoint). Claims about what we would judge or about the intuitive\nresponse to a case are empirically testable, and one project in\nexperimental moral philosophy (perhaps the dominant original project)\nhas been to test such claims via an investigation of our intuitions\nand related moral judgments. In doing so, experimental moral\nphilosophers can accomplish one of two things: first, they can test\nthe claims of traditional philosophers about what is or is not\nintuitive; second, they can investigate the sources of our intuitions\nand judgments. These tasks can be undertaken as part of a positive\nprogram, which uses our intuitions and judgments as inputs and\nconstructs theories that accommodate and explain them. Alternatively,\nthese tasks can figure in a negative program, which uses experimental\nresearch to undermine traditional appeals to intuition as evidence in\nmoral philosophy and conceptual analysis more broadly. The negative\nprogram can proceed directly or indirectly: either via testing and\nrefuting claims about intuitions themselves, or by discrediting the\nsources of those intuitions by discovering that they are influenced by\nfactors widely regarded as not evidential or unreliable. We discuss\nboth the negative program and the positive program below.\n2.1 The Negative Program in Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nEarly work in experimental philosophy suggested cross-cultural\ndifferences in semantic, epistemic, and moral intuitions. For example,\nMachery, Mallon, Nichols, and Stich (2004) argued that East Asian\nsubjects were more likely to hold descriptivist intuitions than their\nWestern counterparts, who tended to embrace causal theories of\nreference. Haidt (2006) argued that the extent to which people judged\nharmless violations such as eating a deceased pet, or engaging in\nconsensual sibling incest, to be wrong depended on socioeconomic\nstatus. Since, presumably, moral wrongness doesn\u2019t itself depend\non socioeconomic status, gender, or culture of the person making the\nmoral judgment, these results have been marshaled to argue either\nagainst the evidential value of intuitions or against the existence of\nmoral facts altogether.\n\nNegative experimental moral philosophy generates results that are then\nused to discount the evidential value of appeals to intuition (for\nreview, Machery 2017, Chapter 2). For example, Singer (2005),\nSinnott-Armstrong (2008d), Lanteri and colleagues (2008), Lombrozo\n(2009), Schwitzgebel and Cushman (2012, 2015), Liao and colleagues\n(2012), Tobia and colleagues (2013), Wiegmann and colleagues (2020),\nRehren and Walter (2021), and McDonald et al. (2021) have\nargued that moral intuitions are subject to normatively\nirrelevant situational influences (e.g., order or framing effects),\nwhile Feltz and Cokely (2009) and Knobe (2011) have documented\ncorrelations between moral intuitions and (presumably) normatively\nirrelevant individual differences (e.g., extroversion). Such results\nmight warrant skepticism about moral intuitions, or at least about\nsome classes of intuitions or\n intuiters.[1]\n\nThe studies just mentioned involve results that suggest that the\ncontent of intuitions varies along some normatively irrelevant\ndimension. Another source of evidence for the negative program draws\non results regarding the cognitive mechanisms underlying or generating\nintuitions themselves. For example, studies that suggest that\ndeontological intuitions are driven by emotional aversions to harming\nothers have been used to argue that we ought to discount our\ndeontological intuitions in favor of consequentialist\nprinciples\u2014an idea discussed in more detail below (see Singer\n2005; Wiegman 2017). In several experiments, Kneer and\nMachery (2019) show that judgments about moral luck result from\nthe hindsight bias, i.e., the tendency to overestimate the probability\nthat events known to have happened would happen. Thus, the\nprobability that the unlucky event in a bad luck situation (e.g.,\na car accident involving a drunk driver) would happen is\noverestimated and the agent is judged to have been more\nnegligent than her counterpart in a lucky situation (the drunk\ndriver who did not get into any accident). This psychological account\nis then used to undermine the philosophical significance of intuitions\nabout moral luck: If the asymmetry between good and back luck\nsituations is due to a psychological bias, it should not bear on\nphilosophical theorizing.\n\nThe distinction between negative and positive experimental moral\nphilosophy is difficult to draw, partly because the negative program\noften discounts particular classes or types of intuitions in favor of\nothers that are supposed to be more reliable. For example, Singer\noffers an anti-deontological argument as part of the negative program\ninsofar as his argument uses the emotional origins of deontological\nintuitions to discount them. But because he then argues for the\nsuperiority of consequentialist intuitions, his position also fits\nwithin the positive program. So the difference between the two\nprograms is not in the data or the kinds of questions investigated,\nbut in how the data are put to use\u2014whether they are seen as\ndebunking traditional philosophical appeals to intuition or as an\naddition to traditional philosophical appeals to intuition, by helping\nphilosophers distinguish between reliable and unreliable intuitions\nand their sources. In the next section, we look at positive uses of\nintuitions as evidence.\n2.2 The Positive Program in Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nOther philosophers are more sanguine about the upshot of experimental\ninvestigations of moral judgment and intuition. Knobe, for example,\nuses experimental investigations of the determinants of moral\njudgments to identify the contours of philosophically resonant\nconcepts and the mechanisms or processes that underlie moral judgment.\nHe has argued for the pervasive influence of moral considerations\nthroughout folk psychological concepts (2009, 2010; see also Pettit\n& Knobe 2009), claiming, among other things, that the concept of\nan intentional action is sensitive to the foreseeable evaluative\nvalence of the consequences of that action (2003, 2004b,\n 2006).[2]\n\n\nAnother line of research is due to Joshua Greene and his colleagues\n(Greene et al. 2001, 2004, 2008; Greene 2008), who investigate the\nneural bases of consequentialist and deontological moral judgments\n(but see Kahane et al. 2015). Greene and his colleagues elicited the\nintuitions of subjects about a variety of trolley problems\u2014cases\nthat present a dilemma in which a trolley is racing towards five\nindividuals, all of whom will be killed unless the trolley is instead\ndiverted towards one individual\u2014while inside an fMRI scanner.\nThe researchers found that, when given cases in which the trolley is\ndiverted by pulling a switch, most subjects agreed that diverting the\ntrolley away from the five and towards the one person was the right\naction. When, instead, the case involved pushing a person off a bridge\nto land in front of and halt the trolley, subjects were less likely to\njudge that sacrificing the one person as morally permissible. In\naddition, Greene found that subjects who did judge it permissible to\npush the person took longer to arrive at their judgment, suggesting\nthat they had to overcome conflicting intuitions to do so (but see\nMcGuire et al. 2009)\u2014a finding bolstered by the fact that when\nsubjects considered pushing the person off the bridge, their brains\nrevealed increased activity in areas associated with the aggregation\nand modulation of value signals (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nand dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Greene concludes that our\naversion to pushing the person is due to an emotional response to the\nthought of causing physical harm to someone, while our willingness to\npull the switch is due to the rational calculation that saving five\npeople is preferable to letting five people die to spare one life.\nGreene and Singer use these findings as a basis for a debunking of\ndeontological intuitions and a vindication of consequentialism, since\nthe latter rests on intuitions which stem from a source we consider\nboth generally reliable and appropriately used as the basis for moral\nreasoning. It should be noted, though, that this argument presupposes\nthat emotional reactions are (at least in these cases) necessarily\nirrational or arational; philosophers who are unsympathetic to such a\nview of emotions need not follow Greene and Singer to their ultimate\nconclusions (Berker 2009; Greene 2014; Railton 2014).\n\nA related approach aims to identify the features to which intuitions\nabout philosophically important concepts are sensitive. Sripada (2011)\nthinks that the proper role of experimental investigations of moral\nintuitions is not to identify the mechanisms underlying moral\nintuitions. Such knowledge, it is claimed, contributes little of\nrelevance to philosophical theorizing. It is rather to investigate, on\na case by case basis, the features to which people are responding when\nthey have such intuitions. On this view, people (philosophers\nincluded) can readily identify whether they have a given intuition,\nbut not why they have it. An example from the debate over determinism\nand free will: manipulation cases have been thought to undermine\ncompatibilist intuitions\u2014intuition supporting the notion that\ndeterminism is compatible with \u201cthe sort of free will required\nfor moral responsibility\u201d (Pereboom 2001). In such cases, an\nunwitting victim is described as having been surreptitiously\nmanipulated into having and reflectively endorsing a motivation to\nperform some action. Critics of compatibilism say that such cases\nsatisfy compatibilist criteria for moral responsibility, and yet,\nintuitively, the actors are not morally responsible (Pereboom 2001).\nSripada (2011) makes a strong case, however, through both mediation\nanalysis and structural equation modeling, that to the extent that\npeople feel the manipulee not to be morally responsible, they do so\nbecause they judge him in fact not to satisfy the compatibilist\n criteria.[3]\n Thus, by determining which aspects of the case philosophical\nintuitions are responding to, it might be possible to resolve\notherwise intractable questions.\n2.3 An Example: Intentionality and Responsibility\n\nSince Knobe\u2019s seminal (2003) paper, experimental philosophers\nhave investigated the complex patterns in people\u2019s dispositions\nto make judgments about moral notions (praiseworthiness,\nblameworthiness, responsibility), cognitive attitudes (belief,\nknowledge, remembering), motivational attitudes (desire, favor,\nadvocacy), and character traits (compassion, callousness) in the\ncontext of violations of and conformity to various norms (moral,\nprudential, aesthetic, legal, conventional,\n descriptive).[4]\n In Knobe\u2019s original experiment, participants first read a\ndescription of a choice scenario: the protagonist is presented with a\npotential policy (aimed at increasing profits) that would result in a\nside effect (either harming or helping the environment). Next, the\nprotagonist explicitly disavows caring about the side effect, and\nchooses to go ahead with the policy. The policy results as advertised:\nboth the primary and the side effect occur. Participants are asked to\nattribute intentionality or an attitude (or, in the case of later work\nby Robinson et al. 2013, a character trait) to the protagonist. What\nKnobe found was that participants were significantly more inclined to\nindicate that the protagonist had intentionally brought about the side\neffect when it was perceived to be bad (harming the environment) than\nwhen it was perceived to be good (helping the environment). This\neffect has been replicated dozens of times, and its scope has been\ngreatly expanded from intentionality attributions after violations of\na moral norm to attributions of diverse properties after violations of\na wide variety of norms.\n\nThe first-order aim of interpreters of this body of evidence is to\ncreate a model that predicts when the attribution asymmetry will crop\nup. The second-order aims are to explain as systematically as possible\nwhy the effect occurs, and to determine the extent to which the\nattribution asymmetry can be considered rational. Figure 1, presented\nhere for the first time, models how participants\u2019 responses to\nthis sort of vignette are produced (for a different, neuroscientific\napproach, see Ngo et al. 2015):\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Model of Participant Response\nto Experimental Philosophy Vignettes\n\n\nIn this model, the boxes represent constructs, the arrows represent\ncausal or functional influences, and the area in grey represents the\nmind of the participant, which is not directly observable but is the\ntarget of investigation. In broad strokes, the idea is that a\nparticipant first reads the text of the vignette and forms a mental\nmodel of what happens in the story. On the basis of this model (and\nalmost certainly while the vignette is still being read), the\nparticipant begins to interpret, i.e., to make both descriptive and\nnormative judgments about the scenario, especially about the mental\nstates and character traits of the people in it. The participant then\nreads the experimenter\u2019s question, forms a mental model of what\nis being asked, and\u2014based on her judgments about the\nscenario\u2014forms an answer to that question. That answer may then\nbe pragmatically revised (to avoid unwanted implications, to bring it\nmore into accord with what the participant thinks the experimenter\nwants to hear, etc.) and is finally recorded as an explicit response\nto a statement about the protagonist\u2019s attitudes (e.g.,\n\u201che brought about the side effect intentionally,\u201d graded\non a Likert\n scale).[5]\n\nA result that has been replicated repeatedly is that, when the\nvignette describes a norm violation, subjects indicate that they agree\nmore strongly that the action violating the norm was performed\nintentionally. While this finding could be used by proponents of the\nnegative program to undermine the conceptual coherence of our notion\nof moral responsibility, experimental moral philosophers working in\nthe positive program have taken up the task of explaining the\nasymmetry by postulating models of unobservable entities that mediate,\nexplain, and perhaps even rationalize the asymmetry. A discussion of\nseveral attempts to do so follows; each offers a different explanation\nof the asymmetry, but all represent vindications or at least\nrehabilitations of our intuitions about intention.\n\nThe Conceptual Competence Model\n\nPerhaps the best known is Knobe\u2019s conceptual competence model,\naccording to which the asymmetry arises at the judgment stage. On this\nview, normative judgments about the action influence otherwise\ndescriptive judgments about whether it was intentional (or desired, or\nexpected, etc.). Moreover, this influence is taken to be part of the\nvery conception of intentionality (desire, belief, etc.). Thus, on the\nconceptual competence model, the asymmetry in attributions is a\nrational expression of the ordinary conception of intentionality\n(desire, belief, etc.), which turns out to have a normative component\n(see Machery 2008 for doubts about how to circumscribe what is part of\nthe conceptual competence with any given\n concept).[6]\n\nThe Motivational Bias Model\n\nThe motivational bias model (Alicke 2008; Nadelhoffer 2004, 2006)\nagrees that the asymmetry originates in the judgment stage, and that\nnormative judgments influence descriptive judgments. However, unlike\nthe conceptual competence model, it takes this to be a bias rather\nthan an expression of conceptual competence. Thus, on this model, the\nasymmetry in attributions is a distortion of the correct conception of\nintentionality (desire, belief, etc.).\n\nThe Deep Self Model\n\nThe deep self concordance model (Sripada 2010, 2012; Sripada &\nKonrath 2011) also locates the source of the asymmetry in the judgment\nstage, but does not recognize an influence (licit or illicit) of\nnormative judgments on descriptive judgments. Instead, proponents of\nthis model claim that when assessing intentional action, people not\nonly attend to their representation of a person\u2019s\n\u201csurface\u201d self\u2014her expectations, means-end beliefs,\nmoment-to-moment intentions, and conditional desires\u2014but also to\ntheir representation of the person\u2019s \u201cdeep\u201d self,\nwhich harbors her sentiments, values, and core principles (for\ncritical discussion, see Rose et al. 2012). According to this model,\nwhen assessing whether someone intentionally brings about some state\nof affairs, people determine (typically unconsciously) whether there\nexists sufficient concordance between their representation of the\noutcome the agent brings about and what they take to be her deep self.\nFor instance, when the chairman says he does not care at all about\neither harming or helping the environment, people attribute to him a\ndeeply anti-environment stance. When he harms the environment, this is\nconcordant with his anti-environment deep self; in contrast, when the\nchairman helps the environment, this is discordant with his\nanti-environment deep self. According to the deep self concordance\nmodel, then, the asymmetry in attributions is a reasonable expression\nof the folk psychological distinction between the deep and shallow\nself.\n\nThe Conversational Pragmatics Model\n\nUnlike the models discussed so far, the conversational pragmatics\nmodel (Adams & Steadman 2004, 2007; Lindauer & Southwood 2021)\nlocates the source of the asymmetry in the pragmatic revision stage.\nAccording to this model, participants judge the protagonist not to\nhave acted intentionally in both norm-conforming and norm-violating\ncases. However, when it comes time to tell the experimenter what they\nthink, participants do not want to be taken as suggesting that the\nharm-causing protagonist is blameless, so they report that he acted\nintentionally. This is a reasonable goal, so according to the\npragmatic revision model, the attribution asymmetry is rational,\nthough misleading.\n\nThe Trade-Off Model\n\nThe trade-off model (Machery 2008) disagrees with the previous models\nabout the location of the source of the asymmetry: it locates it in\nthe interpretation of the scenario. It proposes that when people\nread that the chairman agrees to harm the environment, they\nconceptualize the side effect harming the\nenvironment as a cost, that is, as something that is\nnegatively valued and that one must incur if one is to reap a greater\nbenefit. People think of this cost as being offset by the\nbenefit increasing the profits of the company. That is,\nthey conceptualize the harm case as involving a trade-off between a\ncost and a benefit. The side effect helping the\nenvironment cannot be conceptualized in this way since\nit cannot be plausibly thought of as a cost. Since people think of\ncosts as being intentionally incurred in order to reap some foreseen\nbenefits, the side effect is judged to be intentional in the former\nsituation, but not in the latter situation.  \n\nThe Deliberation Model\n\nLike the trade-off model, according to the deliberation model (Alfano,\nBeebe, & Robinson 2012; Robinson, Stey, & Alfano 2013; Scaife\n& Webber 2013), the best explanation of the complex patterns of\nevidence is that the very first mental stage, the formation of a\nmental model of the scenario, differs between norm-violation and\nnorm-conformity vignettes. When the protagonist is told that a policy\nhe would ordinarily want to pursue violates a norm, he acquires a\nreason to deliberate further about what to do; in contrast, when the\nprotagonist is told that the policy conforms to some norm, he acquires\nno such reason. Participants tend to think of the protagonist as\ndeliberating about what to do when and only when a norm would be\nviolated. Since deliberation leads to the formation of other mental\nstates such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, this basal difference\nbetween participants\u2019 models of what happens in the story flows\nthrough the rest of their interpretation and leads to the attribution\nasymmetry. On the deliberation model, then, the attribution asymmetry\noriginates earlier than other experimental philosophers suppose, and\nis due to rational processes.\n2.4 Another Example: The Linguistic Analogy\n\nAnother positive program investigates the structure and form of moral\nintuitions, in addition to their content, with the aim of using these\nfeatures to inform a theory of the cognitive structures underlying\nmoral judgment and their etiology.\n\nRawls (1971), drawing on Chomsky\u2019s (1965) theory of generative\nlinguistics, suggested that moral cognition might be usefully modeled\non our language faculty, a parallel endorsed by Chomsky himself:\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that we have a natural moral sense\u2026.That\nis, just as people somehow can construct an extraordinarily rich\nsystem of knowledge of language on the basis of rather limited and\ndegenerate experience, similarly, people develop implicit systems of\nmoral evaluation, which are more or less uniform from person to\nperson. There are differences, and the differences are interesting,\nbut over quite a substantial range we tend to make comparable\njudgments, and we do it, it would appear, in quite intricate and\ndelicate ways involving new cases and agreement often about new\ncases\u2026 and we do this on the basis of a very limited\nenvironmental context available to us. The child or the adult\ndoesn\u2019t have much information that enables the mature person to\nconstruct a moral system that will in fact apply to a rich range of\ncases, and yet that happens.\u2026whenever we see a very rich,\nintricate system developing in a more or less uniform way on the basis\nof rather restricted stimulus conditions, we have to assume that there\nis a very powerful, very rich, highly structured innate component that\nis operating in such a way as to create that highly specific system on\nthe basis of the limited data available to it. (Chomsky, quoted in\nMikhail 2005).\n\n\nHere Chomsky points to four similarities between the development of\nlinguistic knowledge and the development of moral knowledge:\n\n\nL1: A child raised in a particular linguistic community almost\ninevitably ends up speaking an idiolect of the local language despite\nlack of sufficient explicit instruction, lack of extensive negative\nfeedback for mistakes, and grammatical mistakes by caretakers.\n\nM1: A child raised in a particular moral community almost inevitably\nends up judging in accordance with an idiolect of the local moral code\ndespite lack of sufficient explicit instruction, lack of sufficient\nnegative feedback for moral mistakes, and moral mistakes by\ncaretakers.\n\nL2: While there is great diversity among natural languages, there are\nsystematic constraints on possible natural languages.\n\nM2: While there is great diversity among natural moralities, there are\nsystematic constraints on possible natural moralities.\n\nL3: Language-speakers obey many esoteric rules that they themselves\ntypically cannot articulate or explain, and which some would not even\nrecognize.\n\nM3: Moral agents judge according to esoteric rules (such as the\ndoctrine of double effect) that they themselves typically cannot\narticulate or explain, and which some would not even recognize.\n\nL4: Drawing on a limited vocabulary, a speaker can both produce and\ncomprehend a potential infinity of linguistic expressions.\n\nM4: Drawing on a limited moral vocabulary, an agent can produce and\nevaluate a very large (though perhaps not infinite) class of\naction-plans, which are ripe for moral judgment.\n\n\nWe will now explain and evaluate each of these pairs of claims in\nturn.\n\nL1/M1 refer to Chomsky\u2019s poverty of the stimulus\nargument: despite receiving little explicit linguistic and grammatical\ninstruction, children develop language rapidly and at a young age, and\nquickly come to display competence applying complex grammatical rules.\nSimilarly, Mikhail and other proponents of the analogy argue that\nchildren acquire moral knowledge at a young age based on relatively\nlittle explicit instruction. However, critics of the analogy point out\nseveral points of difference. First, children actually receive quite a\nbit of explicit moral instruction and correction, and in contrast with\nthe linguistic case, this often takes the form of explicit statements\nof moral rules: \u2018don\u2019t hit,\u2019 \u2018share,\u2019\nand so on. Secondly, there is debate over the age at which children\nactually display moral competence. Paul Bloom (2013; see also Blake,\nMcAuliffe, and Warneken 2014) has argued that babies display moral\ntendencies as early as 3\u20136 months, but others (most famously\nKohlberg (1969) and Piaget (1970)) have argued that children are not\nfully competent with moral judgment until as late as 8\u201312 years,\nby which time they have received quite a bit of moral instruction,\nboth implicit and explicit. A related point concerns the ability to\nreceive instructions: in the case of language, a child requires some\nlinguistic knowledge or understanding in order even to receive\ninstruction: a child who has no understanding of language will not\nunderstand instructions given to her. But in the moral case, a child\nneed not understand moral rules in order to be instructed in them, so\nthere is less need to posit some innate knowledge or understanding.\nNichols et al. (2016) have conducted a series of experiments using\nstatistical learning and Bayesian modeling to show how children might\nlearn complex rules with scant input (see also Nichols 2021). Finally,\nwhile children may initially acquire the moral values present in their\nenvironment, they sometimes change their values or develop their own\nvalues later in life in ways that present spontaneously and with\nlittle conscious effort. This is in marked contrast with language; as\nany second-language learner will recognize, acquiring a new language\nlater in life is effortful and, even if one succeeds in achieving\nfluency, the first language is rarely lost. Lastly, as Prinz (2008)\npoints out, children are punished for moral violations, which may\nexplain why they are quicker to learn moral than grammatical\nrules.\n\nL2/M2 refer to the existence of so-called linguistic\nuniversals: structures present in all known languages. Whether\nthis is true in the moral case is controversial, for reasons\nwe\u2019ll discuss further below. Prinz (2008) and Sripada (2004)\nhave argued that there are no exceptionless moral universals,\nunless one phrases or describes the norms in question in such a way as\nto render them vacuous. Sripada uses the example \u2018murder is\nwrong\u2019 as a vacuous rule: while this might seem like a plausible\ncandidate for a moral universal, when we consider that\n\u2018murder\u2019 refers to a wrongful act of killing, we can see\nthat the norm is not informative. But Mikhail might respond by\nclaiming that the fact that all cultures recognize a subset of\nintentional killings as morally wrong, even if they differ in how they\ncircumscribe this subset, is itself significant, and the relevant\nanalogy here would be with the existence of categories like\n\u2018subject\u2019, \u2018verb\u2019, and \u2018object\u2019 in\nall languages, or with features like recursion, which are present in\nthe grammars of all natural languages (but see Everett 2005).\n\nL3/M3 refer to the patterns displayed by grammatical and moral\nintuitions. In the case of language, native speakers can recognize\ngrammatical and ungrammatical constructions relatively easily, but\ntypically cannot articulate the rules underlying these intuitions. In\nthe case of moral grammar, the analogy claims, the same is true: we\nproduce moral intuitions effortlessly without being able to explain\nthe rules underlying them. Indeed, in both cases, the rules underlying\nthe judgments might be quite esoteric and difficult for native\nspeakers to learn and understand.\n\nL4/M4 refer to the fact that we can embed linguistic phrases within\nother linguistic phrases to create novel and increasingly complex\nphrases and sentences. This property is known as recursion,\nand is present in all known natural languages (indeed, Chomsky\nsuggests that perhaps recursion is the only linguistic universal; see\nHauser, Chomsky & Fitch 2002; but see Everett 2005). For\ninstance, just as phrases can be embedded in other phrases to form\nmore complex phrases:\n\nthe calico cat \\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the dog chased)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the dog [that the breeding\nconglomerate wanted] chased) \\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the\ndog [that the breeding conglomerate{that was bankrupt} wanted] chased)\n\n\nso the descriptions of actions that are morally assessed can be\nembedded in other action descriptions to produce novel action\ndescriptions (Harman 2008, 346). For example:\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to \\(x \\rightarrow\\) It\u2019s wrong to coerce\nsomeone to \\(x \\rightarrow\\) It\u2019s wrong to persuade someone to\ncoerce someone to \\(x\\).\n\n\nThe point is twofold: first, we can create complex action\ndescriptions; second, we can evaluate novel and complex actions and\nrespond with relatively automatic intuitions of grammatical or moral\npermissibility.\n\nMikhail (2011: 43\u201348) uses experimental evidence of judgments\nabout trolley problems to argue that our moral judgments are generated\nby imposing a deontic structure on our representation of the causal\nand evaluative features of the action under consideration. Mikhail\npoints to a variation on the poverty of the stimulus argument, which\nhe calls the poverty of the perceptual stimulus (Mikhail\n2009: 37): when faced with a particular moral situation, we draw\ncomplex inferences about both act and actor based on relatively little\ndata. Mikhail (2010) uses this argument against models of moral\njudgment as affect-driven intuitions:\n\nAlthough each of these rapid, intuitive, and highly automatic moral\njudgments is occasioned by an identifiable stimulus, how the brain\ngoes about interpreting these complex action descriptions and\nassigning a deontic status to each of them is not something revealed\nin any obvious way by the surface structure of the stimulus itself.\nInstead, an intervening step must be postulated: an intuitive\nappraisal of some sort that is imposed on the stimulus prior to any\ndeontic response to it. Hence, a simple perceptual model, such as the\none implicit in Haidt\u2019s (2001) influential model of moral\njudgment, appears inadequate for explaining these intuitions, a point\nthat can be illustrated by calling attention to the unanalyzed link\nbetween eliciting situation and intuitive response in Haidt\u2019s\nmodel\n\n\nUnlike the traditional poverty of the stimulus argument, this version\ndoes not rely on developmental evidence, but on our ability to quickly\nand effortlessly appraise complicated scenarios, such as variations on\ntrolley problems, in a way that is independent of their superficial\nfeatures (e.g., the way they are described), and then issue\nnormative judgments. The postulated intervening step is like the\nunconscious appeal to rules of grammar, and the evidence for such a\nstep must come from experiments showing that we do, in fact, have such\nintuitions, and that they conform to predictable patterns.\n\nThe linguistic analogy relies on experimental evidence about the\nnature and pattern of our moral intuitions, and it outlines an\nimportant role for experiments in moral theory. If the analogy holds,\nthen a descriptively adequate moral theory must be based on the\njudgments of competent moral judges (although a reformist moral theory\nneed not, or at least not to the same extent), just as grammatical\nrules are constructed based on the judgments of competent speakers. A\npressing task will be the systematic collection of such judgments. The\nanalogy also suggests a kind of rationalism about moral judgment,\nsince it posits that our judgments result from the unconscious\napplication of rules to cases. Finally, the analogy might have\nmetaethical implications. Just as we can only evaluate grammaticality\nof utterances relative to a language, it may be that we can only\nevaluate the morality of an action relative to a specific moral\nsystem. How to individuate moralities, and how many (assuming there\nare multiple ones) there are, is a question for further empirical\ninvestigation, and here again experimental evidence will play a\ncrucial role.\n2.5 Cross-Cultural Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nGuided by the idea that variation in some judgments might\nchallenge our trust in them (Machery 2017, Chapter 4), the\nnegative program has led experimental philosophers to examine whether\nmoral judgments vary across cultures and other demographic groups (see\nalso Graham et al. 2016; Doris et al. 2020). Early research\nfocused on the distinction between causing harm as a means or as a\nside effect, and failed to find any cultural variation using the\nfootbridge and the bystander versions of the trolley case (Hauser\net al. 2007; Moore et al. 2011), but a few articles have\nobserved differences among Americans, Russians and Chinese (Ahlenius\n& T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2012), English and Chinese (Gold et\nal. 2014), and Yali horticulturalists in Papua (Sorokowski\net al. 2020). A recent study of moral judgments in 45 countries found\nthat people find it less acceptable to cause someone\u2019s death as a\nmeans to prevent a greater harm than as a mere side effect; they\nalso find it less acceptable to cause someone\u2019s death as a means to\nprevent a greater harm when the death results from \u201cpersonal\nforce\u201d, i.e., when the force that impacts the victim originates\nin the agent\u2019s muscles; but the interaction between these two factors,\nwhich had been observed in the USA, was only found in\nWestern countries (Bago et al. 2022). Moral dilemmas that\ninvestigate the permissibility of causing harm to prevent a greater\nharm also elicit different judgments from men and women: in a\nmetaanalysis of 40 studies, men were more likely to find it\npermissible to cause harm to prevent a greater harm in this kind\nof moral dilemmas (Friesdorf et al. 2015). Hannikainen, Machery and\nCushman (2018) have also shown that Millenials are more likely to find\nit permissible to cause harm to prevent a greater harm in the\nfootbridge case than Gen Xers and Boomers, suggesting that the\nrelevant moral norms might have culturally evolved. \n\nVariation is not limited to sacrificial dilemmas (Stich and Machery in\npress). Cultural factors moderate the influence of valence on judgment\nabout the intentionality of action that was discussed above (Robbins,\nShepard and Rochat 2017): in two rural, traditional cultures\n(Samoa and Vanuatu) people were more likely to judge the good\nside effect than the bad side effect as intentional if the protagonist\nhad a high status.  \n\nAnother area of investigation focuses on the distinction between norms\nthat are thought to be moral and norms that aren\u2019t (see also Machery\nand Stich 2022 for the cross-cultural work on the\nmoral/conventional distinction). Buchtel et al. (2015) have shown that\nthe Mandarin translation of \u201cimmoral\u201d applies to a\nsurprisingly different set of behaviors than \u201cimmoral\u201d in\nEnglish: the former primarily applies to behaviors viewed as\nuncivilized, the latter often to harmful behavior (see also\nDranseika, Berni\u016bnas & Silius 2018).\nBerni\u016bnas (2020) extends this research to the Mongolian\ntranslation of \u201cmoral.\u201d Asking people to classify norms as\nmoral and non-moral, Levine and colleagues (2021) have also shown that\nreligious affiliation influences what counts as moral: religious Jews\nand non-believers have a very narrow moral domain, while Christians\nand Muslims tend to have a broad moral domain; surprisingly, Hindus\nfail to distinguish moral from non-moral norms (see\nalso Dranseika, Berni\u016bnas & Sousa 2016). This kind\nof findings has led Machery (2018) to propose that morality is a\ncultural invention that is not found in every culture (see also Stich\n2018).\n\nJudgments related to free will, control, blame, and punishment also\nvary across cultures (Hannikainen et al. 2019; for a different line of\ncross-cultural research on free will, see Sarkissian et al.\n2010). In most cultures, people deny free will and control (and\nthus blame and punish less) when the agent\u2019s action is described\nas antecedently caused; by contrast, they assign free will and\ncontrol when the action originates stems from the agent\u2019s own\nwill even if she could not have done otherwise (a situation\nillustrated by Frankfurt cases). East Asians, however, differ in\ntreating these two kinds of situations similarly: if the surrounding\ncircumstances undercut the agent\u2019s capacity to have done\notherwise, they tend to deny her free will and control. East Asians\u2019\ngreater attention to contextual factors when explaining behavior\n(Choi, Nisbett and Norenzayan 1999) might account for this finding\n(for related research, see Buchtel et al. 2018). Berniunas and\ncolleagues (2021) have even argued that the concept of free will is a\nculture-specific concept, not found in most cultures. \n3. Character, Wellbeing, Emotion, and Moral Standing\n\nUntil the 1950s, modern moral philosophy had largely focused on either\nconsequentialism or deontology. The revitalization of virtue ethics\nled to a renewed interest in virtues and vices (e.g., honesty,\ngenerosity, fairness, dishonesty, stinginess, unfairness), in\neudaimonia (often translated as \u2018happiness\u2019 or\n\u2018flourishing\u2019), and in the emotions. In recent decades,\nexperimental work in psychology, sociology, and neuroscience has been\nbrought to bear on the empirical grounding of philosophical views in\nthese areas.\n3.1 Character and Virtue\n\nA virtue is a complex disposition comprising sub-dispositions to\nnotice, construe, think, desire, and act in characteristic ways. To be\ngenerous, for instance, is (among other things) to be disposed to\nnotice occasions for giving, to construe ambiguous social cues\ncharitably, to desire to give people things they want, need, or would\nappreciate, to deliberate well about what they want, need, or would\nappreciate, and to act on the basis of such deliberation.\nManifestations of such a disposition are observable and hence ripe for\nempirical investigation. Virtue ethicists of the last several decades\nhave sometimes been optimistic about the distribution of virtue in the\npopulation. Alasdair MacIntyre claims, for example, that\n\u201cwithout allusion to the place that justice and injustice,\ncourage and cowardice play in human life very little will be genuinely\nexplicable\u201d (1984: 199). Julia Annas\n(2011: 8\u201310) claims that \u201cby the time we reflect\nabout virtues, we already have some.\u201d Linda Zagzebski (2010)\nprovides an \u201cexemplarist\u201d semantics for virtue terms that\nonly gets off the ground if there are in fact many virtuous\npeople.\n\nStarting with Owen Flanagan\u2019s Varieties of Moral\nPersonality (1993), philosophers began to worry that empirical\nresults from social psychology were inconsistent with the structure of\nhuman agency presupposed by virtue theory. In this framework, people\nare conceived as having more or less fixed traits of character that\nsystematically order their perception, cognition, emotion, reasoning,\ndecision-making, and behavior. For example, a generous person is\ninclined to notice and seek out opportunities to give supererogatorily\nto others. The generous person is also inclined to think about what\nwould (and wouldn\u2019t) be appreciated by potential recipients, to\nfeel the urge to give and the glow of satisfaction after giving, to\ndeliberate effectively about when, where, and how to give to whom, to\ncome to firm decisions based on such deliberation, and to follow\nthrough on those decisions once they\u2019ve been made. Other traits\nare meant to fit the same pattern, structuring perception, cognition,\nmotivation, and action of their bearers. Famous results in social\npsychology, such as Darley and Batson\u2019s (1973) Good Samaritan\nexperiment, seem to tell against this view of human moral conduct.\nWhen someone helps another in need, they may do so simply because they\nare not in a rush, rather than because they are expressing a fixed\ntrait like generosity or compassion.\n\nIn the virtue-theoretic framework, people are not necessarily assumed\nto already be virtuous. However, they are assumed to be at least\npotentially responsive to the considerations that a virtuous person\nwould ordinarily notice and take into account. Flanagan (1993),\nfollowed by Doris (1998, 2002, in press), Harman (1999, 2000), and\nAlfano (2013), made trouble for this framework by pointing to social\npsychological evidence suggesting that much of people\u2019s\nthinking, feeling, and acting is instead predicted by (and hence\nresponsive to) situational factors that don\u2019t seem to count as\nreasons at all\u2014not even bad reasons or temptations to vice.\nEarly discussions of these situational factors\nemphasized influences such as ambient sensibilia (sounds, smells,\nlight levels, etc.), seemingly trivial and normatively irrelevant\ninducers of positive and negative moods, order of presentation of\nstimuli, and a variety of framing and priming effects, many of which\nare reviewed in Alfano (2013:\n 40\u201350).[7] \n It\u2019s\n worth emphasizing the depth of the problem these studies appeared\nto pose. It\u2019s not that they suggest that most people\naren\u2019t virtuous (although they do suggest that as well).\nIt\u2019s that they suggest that they undermine the entire framework\nin which people are conceived as cognitively sensitive and\nmotivationally responsive to reasons. Someone whose failure to act\nvirtuously because they gave in to temptation can be understood in the\nvirtue-theoretic framework. Someone whose failure to act virtuously\nbecause they\u2019d just been subliminally primed with physical\ncoldness, which in turn is metaphorically associated with social\ncoldness, finds no place in the virtue-theoretic framework. These\nsorts of effects push us to revamp our whole notion of agency and\npersonhood (Doris 2015).\n\nSome of the most surprising findings touted by critics of virtue\nethics (e.g., social priming) now appear to be\nunreplicable (for discussion, see Alfano 2018), but this outcome\ndoes not provide much solace to virtue theorists. Early estimates\nsuggested that individual difference variables typically explain less\nthan 10% of the variance in people\u2019s behavior (Mischel\n1968)\u2014though, as Funder and Ozer (1983) pointed out, situational\nfactors may explain less than\n 16%.[8]\n More recent aggregated evidence indicates that situational factors\nexplain approximately twice as much of the variance in human behavior\nas the five main trait factors (Rauthmann et al. 2014). Convergent\nevidence from both lexicographical and survey studies indicates that\nthere are at least five dimensions of situations that reliably predict\nthought, feeling, and behavior: (1) negative valence, (2) adversity,\n(3) duty, (4) complexity, and (5) positive valence (Rauthmann and\nSherman 2018).\n\nAccording to Doris (2002, in press), the best explanation of this lack\nof cross-situational consistency is that the great majority of people\nhave local rather than global, traits: they are not honest,\ncourageous, or greedy, but they may be honest-while-in-a-good-mood,\ncourageous-while-sailing-in-rough-weather-with-friends, and\ngreedy-unless-watched-by-fellow-parishioners. In contrast, Christian\nMiller (2013, 2014) thinks the evidence is best explained by a theory\nof mixed global traits, such as the disposition to (among other\nthings) help because it improves one\u2019s mood. Such traits are\nglobal, in the sense that they explain and predict behavior across\nsituations (someone with such a disposition will, other things being\nequal, typically help so long as it will maintain her mood), but\nnormatively mixed, in the sense that they are neither virtues nor\nvices. Mark Alfano (2013) goes in a third direction, arguing that\nvirtue and vice attributions tend to function as self-fulfilling\nprophecies. People tend to act in accordance with the traits that are\nattributed to them, whether the traits are minor virtues such as\ntidiness (Miller, Brickman, & Bolen 1975) and ecology-mindedness\n(Cornelissen et al. 2006, 2007), major virtues such as charity (Jensen\n& Moore 1977), cooperativeness (Grusec et al. 1978), and\ngenerosity (Grusec & Redler 1980), or vices such as cutthroat\ncompetitiveness (Grusec et al. 1978). On Alfano\u2019s view,\nwhen people act in accordance with a virtue, they often do so not\nbecause they possess the trait in question, but because they think\nthey do or because they know that other people think they do. He calls\nsuch simulations of moral character factitious virtues, and\neven suggests that the notion of a virtue should be revised to include\nreflexive and social\n expectations.[9]\n\nIt might seem that the criticisms that motivate these novel approaches\nto virtue miss their mark. After all, virtue ethicists needn\u2019t\n(and often don\u2019t) commit themselves to the claim that almost\neveryone is virtuous. Instead, many argue that virtue is the\nnormative goal of moral development, and that people mostly fail in\nvarious ways to reach that goal. The argument from the fact that most\npeople\u2019s dispositions are not virtues to a rejection of orthodox\nvirtue ethics, then, might be thought a non sequitur, at\nleast for such views. But empirically-minded critics of virtue ethics\ndo not stop there. They all have positive views about what sorts of\ndispositions people have instead of virtues. These\ndispositions are alleged to be so structurally dissimilar from virtues\n(as traditionally understood) that it may be psychologically\nunrealistic to treat (traditional) virtue as a regulative ideal. What\nmatters, then, is the width of the gap between the descriptive and the\nnormative, between the (structure of the) dispositions most people\nhave and the (structure of the) dispositions that count as\nvirtues.\n\nThree leading defenses against this criticism have been offered. Some\nvirtue ethicists (Kupperman 2009) have conceded that virtue is\nextremely rare, but argued that it may still be a useful regulative\nideal. Others (Hurka 2006; Merritt 2000) have attempted to weaken\nthe concept of virtue in such a way as to enable more people, or at\nleast more behaviors, to count as virtuous. Still others (Kamtekar\n2004; Russell 2009; Snow 2010; Sreenivasan 2002) have\nchallenged the situationist evidence or its interpretation. While it\nremains unclear whether these defenses succeed, grappling with the\nsituationist challenge has led both defenders and challengers of\nvirtue ethics to develop more nuanced and empirically informed\n views.[10]\n3.2 Wellbeing, Happiness, and the Good Life\n\nPhilosophers have always been interested in what makes a human life go\nwell, but recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in both\npsychological and philosophical research into happiness, well-being,\nand what makes for a good life. It is important to distinguish here\nbetween \u2018good life\u2019 in the sense of a life that goes well\nfor the one who lives it, and a morally good life, since\nphilosophers have long debated whether a morally bad person could\nenjoy a good life. The empirical study of wellbeing focuses primarily\non lives that are good in the former sense: good for the person whose\nlife it is. Second, we need to distinguish between a hedonically good\nlife and an overall good life. A life that is hedonically good is one\nthat the subject experiences as pleasant; an overall good life might\nnot contain much pleasure but might be good for other reasons, such as\nwhat it accomplishes. We might decide, after investigation, that an\noverall good life must be a hedonically good life, but the two\nconcepts are distinct.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can see the relevance of\nexperimental evidence to investigations in this area. First and\nperhaps most obviously, experiments can investigate our intuitions\nabout what constitutes a good life, thereby giving us insight into the\nordinary concepts of happiness, well-being, and flourishing. To this\nend, Phillips, Nyholm, and Liao (2014) investigated intuitions about\nthe relationship between morality and happiness. Their results suggest\nthat the ordinary conception of happiness involves both descriptive\nand normative components: specifically, we judge that people are happy\nif they are experiencing positive feelings that they ought to\nexperience. So, to use their examples, a Nazi doctor who gets positive\nfeelings from conducting his experiments is not happy. By contrast, a\nnurse who gets positive feelings from helping sick children is happy,\nthough a nurse who is made miserable by the same actions is not\nhappy.\n\nAnother set of experimental findings bearing on this question involves\nNozick\u2019s (1974: 44\u201345) experience machine thought\nexperiment. In response to the hedonist\u2019s claim that pleasure is\nthe only intrinsic good, Nozick asks us to consider the following:\n\nSuppose there was an experience machine that would give you any\nexperience you desired. Super-duper neuropsychologists could stimulate\nyour brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great\nnovel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the\ntime you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your\nbrain. Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your\nlife experiences? [\u2026] Of course, while in the tank you\nwon\u2019t know that you\u2019re there; you\u2019ll think that\nit\u2019s all actually happening [\u2026] Would you plug in?\n\n\nNozick argues that our response to the experience machine reveals that\nwell-being is not purely subjective: \u201cWe learn that something\nmatters to us in addition to experience by imagining an experience\nmachine and then realizing that we would not use it.\u201d De Brigard\n(2010) reports finding that subjects\u2019 intuitions about the\nexperience were different if they were told they were already in such\na machine, in which case they would not choose to unplug; he explains\nthis in terms of the status quo bias. Weijers (2014) goes further,\nasking subjects about Nozick\u2019s original scenario while also\nasking them to justify their response; he found that many of the\njustifications implied a kind of imaginative resistance to the\nscenario or cited irrelevant factors. He also found that respondents\nwere more likely to say that a \u2018plugged in life\u2019 would be\nbetter when they were choosing for someone else, rather than for\nthemselves. L\u00f6hr (2019) shows that a third of philosophers would\nstay in the machine and recommend it to others. Hindriks and Douven\n(2018) further show that people are more likely to agree to choose\npleasurable, but illusory experiences in scenarios that are more\nrealistic than the experience machine.   \n\nA second type of study involves investigating the causes and\ncorrelates of happiness, well-being, and life-satisfaction. These\nexperiments look at the conditions under which people report positive\naffect or life-satisfaction, as well as the conditions under which\nthey judge that their lives are going well. This is distinct from the\nfirst type of research, since the fact that someone reports an\nexperience as being pleasurable does not necessarily tell us whether\nthey would judge that experience to be pleasurable for someone else;\nthere may be asymmetries in first- and third-person evaluations.\nFurthermore, this type of research can tell us how various candidates\ncontribute to well-being from a first-person perspective, but that\ndoesn\u2019t settle the question of the concept of a good life. I\nmight judge that my life is going well, yet fail to notice that I am\ndoing so because I am in a very good mood, and that in fact I am not\naccomplishing any of my goals; if confronted with another person in a\nsimilar situation, I might not make the same judgment. Which of these\njudgments best represents our concept of well-being is a tricky\nquestion, and a normative one since experimental evidence alone may\nnot settle it. As it turns out, experiments have uncovered a number of\nfactors that influence our own reports and assessments of pleasure and\nwell-being. We will discuss two areas of research in particular:\nreports of pleasures and pains, and judgments of life\nsatisfaction.\n\nFirst, in the realm of hedonic evaluation, there are marked\ndivergences between the aggregate sums of in-the-moment pleasures and\npains and ex post memories of pleasures and pains. For example, the\nremembered level of pain of a colonoscopy is well-predicted by the\naverage of the worst momentary level of pain and the final level of\npain; furthermore, the duration of the procedure has no measurable\neffect on ex post pain ratings (Redelmeier & Kahneman 1996). What\nthis means is that people\u2019s after-the-fact summaries of their\nhedonic experiences are not simple integrals with respect to time of\nmomentary hedonic tone. If the colonoscopy were functionally completed\nafter minute 5, but arbitrarily prolonged for another 5 minutes so\nthat the final level of pain was less at the end of minute 10 than at\nthe end of minute 5, the patient would retrospectively evaluate the\nexperience as less painful. This complicates accounts of well-being in\nterms of pleasure (for example, Bentham\u2019s 1789/1961 hedonism)\ninsofar as it raises the question whether the pleasure being measured\nis pleasure as experienced in the moment, or retrospectively: if, in\nthe very act of aggregating pleasure, we change the way we evaluate\nit, this is a complication for hedonism and for some versions of\nutilitarianism. Since well-being is supposed to be a normative notion\ncapable of guiding both individual actions and social policy, findings\nlike these also call into question what, exactly, we ought to be\nseeking to maximize: pleasurable moments, or the overall retrospective\nevaluation of pleasure.\n\nSuch findings have led some philosophers to seek out alternatives to\nhedonism in hopes of establishing a more empirically stable\nunderpinning for well-being: in particular, the idea that well-being\nconsists in life satisfaction. The most prominent psychologist in this\nfield is Ed\n Diener[11]\n whose Satisfaction with Life Scale asks participants to agree or\ndisagree with statements such as, \u201cI am satisfied with my\nlife\u201d and \u201cIf I could live my life over, I would change\nalmost nothing.\u201d These questions seem to get at more stable and\nsignificant features of life than hedonic assessments in terms of\npleasure and pain, and one might expect the responses to be more\nconsistent and robust. However, two problems arise. The first is that\nparticipants\u2019 responses to life satisfaction questionnaires may\nnot be accurate reports of standing attitudes. Fox and Kahneman\n(1992), for instance, showed that, especially in personal domains\npeople seem to value (friends and love life), what predicts\nparticipants\u2019 responses is not recent intrapersonal factors but\nsocial comparison. Someone who has just lost a friend but still thinks\nof herself as having more friends than her peers will tend to report\nhigher life satisfaction than someone who has just gained a friend but\nwho still thinks of himself as having fewer friends than his\npeers.\n\nLife satisfaction surveys were also believed to be subject to\norder effects. If a participant is asked a global life satisfaction\nquestion and then asked about his romantic life, the correlation\nbetween these questions tends to be near zero, but if the participant\nis asked the dating question first, the correlation tends to be high\nand positive (Strack, Martin & Schwarz\n1988). Relatedly, weather and life-satisfaction were\ncorrelated when subjects were asked about weather first, but not when\nthe weather question followed the life-satisfaction query (Schwarz\n& Clore 1983). Recent work has however cast doubts on this\nkind of results: Schimmack and Oishi (2005) did not\nreplicate Strack et al.\u2019s (1988) findings and Lucas and Lawless\n(2013) found no evidence for an effect of weather on\nlife-satisfaction judgments (but see Connolly\n 2013).[12]\n Recent surveys suggest that the instability of life satisfaction\nsurveys, which some philosophers have been taken for granted, has been\nexaggerated (Lucas 2018). \n\nSchwarz\u2019s findings and similar ones have led some philosophers (e.g.,\nHaybron 2008) to argue that life-satisfaction judgments are too\narbitrary to ever satisfy the requirements of a theory of well-being.\nIn response, Tiberius and Plakias (2011) argue for an idealized\nlife-satisfaction theory they call value-based life\nsatisfaction, suggesting that by asking subjects to consider\ntheir life-satisfaction while attending to the domains they most value\nmuch of the instability plaguing the studies described above is\nremoved, a claim they support with research showing that judgments\nmade after priming subjects to think about their values demonstrate\nhigher levels of retest stability (Schimmack & Oishi 2005).\n3.3 Emotion and Affect\n\nAs much of the previous discussion reveals, the relationship between\nemotion and moral judgment is one of the central concerns of both\ntraditional and experimental moral philosophy. Our discussion of this\ntopic will focus on two types of research: the role of emotion in\nmoral reasoning generally, and the role of a specific\nemotion\u2014disgust\u2014in moral judgments.\n\nOne debate concerns whether hot, emotion-driven reasoning is\nnecessarily better or worse than reasoning based only on cooler, more\nreflective thinking\u2014a distinction sometimes referred to using\nKahneman\u2019s terminology of system 1/system 2 thinking. The\nterminology is not perfect, though, because Kahneman\u2019s terms map\nonto a quick, automatic, unconscious system of judgments (system 1)\nand a slow, effortful, deliberative decision-making process (system\n2), and as we saw above, this is not a distinction between emotion and\nreason, since rule-based judgments can be automatic and unconscious\nwhile emotional judgments might be effortful and conscious. The debate\nbetween Mikhail and Haidt is a debate over the extent to which\nemotions rather than rules explain our moral judgments; Singer and\nGreene\u2019s arguments against deontology rest on the claim that\nemotion-backed judgments are less justified than their utilitarian\ncounterparts.\n\nOne reason for thinking that moral judgments essentially involve some\nemotional component is that they tend to motivate us.\nInternalism is the view that there is a necessary connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation. This contrasts with\nexternalism, which doesn\u2019t deny that moral judgments\nare usually motivating, but does deny that they are necessarily so, as\nthe link between judgment and motivation is only contingent. Since\nemotions are intrinsically motivational, showing that moral judgments\nconsist, even in part, of emotions would vindicate internalism. One\nroute to this conclusion has involved surveying people\u2019s\nintuitions about moral judgment. Nichols (2002: 289) asked subjects\nwhether an agent who \u201chad no emotional reaction to hurting other\npeople\u201d but claims to know that hurting others is wrong really\nunderstands that hurting others is wrong. He found that most subjects\ndid attribute knowledge in such cases, suggesting that the ordinary\nconcept of moral judgment is externalist, a claim that is further\nsupported by Strandberg and Bj\u00f6rklund (2013). An additional\nsource of evidence comes from psychopaths and patients with traumatic\nbrain injuries, both of whom show evidence of impaired moral\nfunctioning\u2014though how one regards this evidence depends on\nwhich perspective one begins with: while externalists (Nichols\n2002; Roskies 2003) claim that the existence of psychopaths\nprovides a counterexample to the claim that moral judgment is\nmotivating (since psychopaths lack empathy and an aversion to harming\nothers), internalists (Smith 1994; Maibom 2005; Kennett\n& Fine 2008) argue that psychopaths don\u2019t actually make\nfull-fledged moral judgments. Psychologist Robert Hare (1993: 129)\nquotes a researcher as saying that, they \u201cknow the words but not\nthe music.\u201d Psychopaths also display other cognitive and\naffective deficiencies, as evidenced by their poor decision-making\nskills in other areas. This may mean that they should not be taken as\nevidence against internalism.\n\nA reason for thinking that moral judgments ought not involve emotion\nis that emotions sometimes seem to lead to judgments that are\ndistorted or off-track, or that seem otherwise unjustified. One\nemotion in particular is often mentioned in this context: disgust.\nThis emotion, which seems to be unique to human animals and emerges\nrelatively late in development (from the ages of about 5\u20138),\ninvolves a characteristic gaping facial expression, a tendency to\nwithdraw from the object of disgust, a slight reduction in body\ntemperature and heart rate, and a sense of nausea and the need to\ncleanse oneself. In addition, the disgusted subject is typically\nmotivated to avoid and even expunge the offending object, experiences\nit as contaminating and repugnant, becomes more attuned to other\ndisgusting objects in the immediate environment, and is inclined to\ntreat anything that the object comes in contact with (whether\nphysically or symbolically) as also disgusting. This last\ncharacteristic is often referred to as \u2018contamination\npotency\u2019 and it is one of the features that makes disgust so\npotent and, according to its critics, so problematic. The disgust\nreaction can be difficult to repress, is easily recognized, and\nempathically induces disgust in those who do recognize\n it.[13]\n There are certain objects that almost all normal adults are disgusted\nby (feces, decaying corpses, rotting food, spiders, maggots, gross\nphysical deformities). But there is also considerable intercultural\nand interpersonal variation beyond these core objects of disgust,\nwhere the emotion extends into food choices, sexual behaviors,\nout-group members, and violations of social norms. Many studies have\nclaimed to show that disgust is implicated in harsher moral judgments\n(Schnall, Haidt, & Clore 2008), citing experiments in which\nsubjects filling out questionnaires in smelly or dirty rooms evaluated\nmoral transgressions more harshly. Many of these studies have however\nfailed to replicate, raising doubts about the influence of incidental\ndisgust on moral judgment (e.g., Johnson, Cheung &\nDonnellan\u2019s (2014) failed replication of Schnall et al. (2008);\nGhelfi et al. 2020). \n\nOthers have gone further and argued that disgust might itself cause or\ncomprise a part of moral judgment (Haidt 2001; Wheatley & Haidt\n2005). If this is true, critics argue, we ought to be wary of those\njudgments, because disgust has a checkered past in multiple senses.\nFirst, it\u2019s historically (and currently) associated with racism,\nsexism, homophobia and xenophobia; the language of disgust is often\nused in campaigns of discrimination and even genocide. Secondly,\ndisgust\u2019s evolutionary history gives us reason to doubt it.\nKelly (2011) argues that the universal bodily manifestations of\ndisgust evolved to help humans avoid ingesting toxins and other\nharmful substances, while the more cognitive or symbolic sense of\noffensiveness and contamination associated with disgust evolved to\nhelp humans avoid diseases and parasites. This system is later\nrecruited for an entirely distinct purpose: to help mark the\nboundaries between in-group and out-group, and thus to motivate\ncooperation with in-group members, punishment of in-group defectors,\nand exclusion of out-group members.\n\nIf Kelly\u2019s account of disgust is on the right track, it seems to\nhave a number of important moral upshots. One consequence, he argues,\nis \u201cdisgust skepticism\u201d (139), according to which the\ncombination of disgust\u2019s hair trigger and its ballistic\ntrajectory mean that it is especially prone to incorrigible false\npositives that involve unwarranted feelings of contamination and even\ndehumanization. Hence, \u201cthe fact that something is disgusting is\nnot even remotely a reliable indicator of moral foul play\u201d but\nis instead \u201cirrelevant to moral justification\u201d (148).\n\nIt is important to note that the skeptical considerations Kelly raises\nare specific to disgust and its particular evolutionary history, so\nthey aren\u2019t intended to undermine the role of all emotions in\nmoral judgment. Still, if Kelly is correct, and if disgust is\nimplicated in lots of moral judgments, we may have a reason to be\nskeptical of many of our judgments. Plakias (2011, 2017) argues\nagainst the first half of this antecedent, claiming that Kelly and\nother \u2018disgust skeptics\u2019 are wrong to claim that the\npurposes of moral and physical disgust are totally distinct; she\nsuggests that disgust is sometimes a fitting response to moral\nviolations that protects against social contagion. May (2014) argues\nagainst the second half, claiming that disgust\u2019s role in moral\njudgment has been significantly overblown; at most, we have evidence\nthat disgust can, in certain cases, slightly amplify moral judgments\nthat are already in place. Recent empirical work indicates that\nincidental disgust has little effect on the harshness of moral\njudgments, though dispositional disgust-sensitivity does (Landy &\nGoodwin 2015; Landy & Piazza 2019).\n3.4 Moral Standing\n\nA creature has moral standing if its interests are morally relevant to\nthe agents whose actions impact it. Stones don\u2019t have moral\nstanding, people do. Moral philosophers disagree about the grounds of\nmoral standing, i.e., that in virtue of which a creature has moral\nstanding. Some argue that the capacity to feel gives a creature moral\nstanding (e.g., Bentham 1781/2011), others favor autonomy (e.g., Kant\n2001). What about lay people (for review, see Goodwin 2015)? According\nto Gray, Gray, and Wegner (2007), lay people side with Bentham:\nWhether a creature can suffer determines whether it has morally\nrelevant interests (see also Robbins & Jack 2006 and Knobe &\nPrinz 2008). \n\nHowever, the influence of another historical tradition, which like\nKant highlights the connection between rationality and autonomy and\nmoral standing, suggests that the capacity to feel might not be the\nwhole story. Sytsma and Machery (2012) provided evidence for the\ntwo-source hypothesis: both rationality and the capacity to feel\nunderwrite the ascription of moral standing by lay people. Others have\nsince identified further factors that influence the ascription of\nmoral standing (e.g., Piazza, Landy & Goodwin 2014), and they have\nexamined how information about the grounds of moral standing can be\nused by people in a self-serving manner (Piazza & Loughnan 2016).\nRecent work connects moral standing ascription to, on the one hand,\nvegetarianism and the treatment of animals (e.g., Piazza &\nLoughnan 2016) and, on the other, the psychological processes\nunderlying dehumanization (Machery 2021).\n4. Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nMetaethics steps back from moral theorizing to ask about the nature\nand function of morality. While first-order ethics seeks to explain\nwhat we should do, metaethics seeks to explain the status of those\ntheories themselves: what are their metaphysical commitments, and what\nevidence do we have for or against them? Which epistemology best\ncharacterizes our moral practices? What is the correct semantics for\nmoral language? These questions might not seem obviously empirical,\nbut insofar as it attempts to give an account of moral semantics,\nepistemology, and ontology, metaethics aims, in part, to capture or\nexplain what we do when we engage in moral talk, judgment, and\nevaluation. To the extent that metaethics sees itself as\ncharacterizing our ordinary practice of morality, it is therefore\nanswerable to empirical data about that practice. To the extent that a\ntheory claims that we are mistaken or in widespread error about the\nmeaning of moral language, or that we lack justification for our core\nmoral beliefs, this is taken to be a strike against that theory. For\nexample, relativism is often criticized on the grounds that it\nrequires us to give up the (putatively) widespread belief that moral\nclaims concern objective matters of fact and are true or false\nindependently of our beliefs or attitudes. We have already seen\nseveral ways that experimental data bears on theories about moral\nreasons (the debate between internalists and externalists) and the\nepistemology of moral judgment (the debate over the role of\nintuitions). In this section we will examine experimental\ncontributions to the debate over moral realism, arguments about moral\ndisagreement, and moral language.\n4.1 Folk Metaethics and Moral Realism\n\nMuch contemporary metaethics relies on assumptions about the nature of\nordinary moral thought, discourse, and practice; metaethicists tend to\nsee their project as essentially conservative. For example, Michael\nSmith writes that the first step in metaethical theorizing is to\n\u201cidentify features that are manifest in ordinary moral\npractice\u201d and the second step is to \u201cmake sense of a\npractice having these features.\u201d (1994) This assumption has had\na major impact on the debate between realists and anti-realists, with\nrealists claiming to best capture the nature of ordinary moral\ndiscourse: \u201cWe begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about\nethics,\u201d says Brink (1989), and then \u201cwe are led to some\nform of antirealism (if we are) only because we come to regard the\nmoral realist\u2019s commitments as untenable\u2026 Moral realism\nshould be our metaethical starting point, and we should give it up\nonly if it does involve unacceptable metaphysical and epistemological\ncommitments.\u201d\n\nBut experimental work has cast doubt on this claim, beginning with\nDarley and Goodwin (2008), and continued by James Beebe (2014) and\nothers (Wright et al. 2013; Campbell & Kumar 2012; Goodwin &\nDarley 2010; Sarkissian et al. 2011; but see Sousa et al.\n2021; for review, see P\u00f6lzler & Wright 2019). Goodwin\nand Darley asked subjects to rate their agreement with statements\ndrawn from the moral, ethical, and aesthetic domain, and asked\nsubjects whether they agreed with the statement (for example,\n\u201cbefore the 3rd month of pregnancy, abortion for any reason (of\nthe mother\u2019s) is morally permissible,\u201d), whether they\nthought it represented a fact or an opinion or\nattitude, and whether, if someone were to disagree with them\nabout the statement, at least one of the disputants would have to be\nmistaken. (We will say more about the authors\u2019 use of\ndisagreement as a proxy for realism in the following section.) In\ngeneral, subjects rated moral statements as less factual than\nobviously factual statements (e.g. \u201cthe earth is at the center\nof the universe,\u201d) but more factual than statements about\nmatters of taste or etiquette. What is striking about these findings\nis not just that people are not straightforwardly realist, but that\nthey seem to treat moral questions variably (Wright, Grandjean\n& McWhite 2013): some are treated as matters of fact, others\nas matters of opinion. This pattern has been replicated in several\nstudies, and persists even when subjects are allowed to determine for\nthemselves which issues to assign to the moral domain, suggesting that\nsubjects do not think moral claims are uniformly objective\n\nA question that remains is how to explain this variation: are people\nbeing inconsistent? Are they tracking something besides the moral\nquestion\u2014perhaps the degree of consensus that exists about a\nquestion? Further research may help shed some light on these issues,\nbut even if the questions are answered in the affirmative, the\nrealist\u2019s claim to capture folk morality is called into\nquestion, since these experiments suggest that folk intuitions are\neither not uniformly realist, or they are confused (and hence poorly\nsuited for a role in metaethical theorizing). Another response to\nthese findings is that they reveal a kind of folk metaethical\npluralism. For example, Michael Gill (2008, 2009) and Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong (2009) have suggested a noncognitivist treatment of\nsome areas of morality and cognitivism about others. This response is\nunder-motivated by empirical data, however, since such data shows at\nmost that our judgments about the extent to which moral claims\ndescribe mind-independent facts is variable, and not that their\nsemantics itself varies. Nor does such data settle the question\nwhether our moral judgments are beliefs or another conative state:\nwhile experimental data can reveal a role for emotion in moral\njudgment, as discussed above, it does not show that in such cases\nbelief is absent. We will discuss limitations on experimental moral\nphilosophy in more detail in Section 5 below. For now, it seems that\ndata about folk realism are best viewed as undermining one of the most\ncommonly-cited sources of evidence for moral realism, namely, that it\ncaptures our ordinary moral discourse and practice better than its\ncompetitors. A further question, open to exploration, is whether an\nanti-realist view might do better at capturing and explaining our folk\nintuitions than realist competitors.\n4.2 Moral Disagreement\n\nAs we saw at the beginning of this entry, some of the earliest\nthinking in empirically-informed moral philosophy concerns moral\ndisagreement. Brandt and Ladd conducted in-depth investigations into\nthe moral codes of other groups, and some contemporary moral\nphilosophers have argued for continuing attention to the empirical\ndetails of moral disagreement. This is partly due to the influence of\nMackie\u2019s (1977: 36\u201337) formulation of what he dubbed\n\u2018the argument from relativity\u2019 in terms of an inference to\nthe best explanation: the best explanation of the nature and\npersistence of moral diversity, Mackie argues, is that our moral\njudgments represent \u201cways of life,\u201d rather than\n\u201cperceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly\ndistorted, of objective moral values.\u201d Realists have tended to\nrespond to the argument by pointing to other possible explanations of\ndisagreement that are consistent with objectivity, such as mistakes\nabout the non-moral facts, irrationality, and failures of impartiality\nand imagination (e.g., Brink 1984; Sturgeon 1988; Smith\n1994; Shafer-Landau 2003; for an overview and analysis of realist\nresponses, see Loeb 1998).\n\nHere it is useful to recall Brandt\u2019s admonition that \u201cbare\ninformation about intercultural differences\u201d will not suffice to\nsettle the debate. Because the argument from disagreement turns, in\npart, on both the existence of moral disagreement and the best\nexplanation for it, evaluating the prospects for the argument requires\nattention to the empirical details of actual moral disagreements,\nrather than conjecture about the outcomes of possible moral\ndisagreements. For example, Doris and Plakias (2008) discuss several\ninstances of cross-cultural moral disagreement, and assess the\nprospects for applying what they call \u2018defusing\nexplanations\u2019 to these cases. A defusing explanation is one that\naccounts for the disagreement in terms of a non-moral difference or an\nepistemic shortcoming on the part of one or more disputant, thereby\nshowing that it is not, in fact, a moral disagreement. Their argument\nand the experiments they cite are discussed in detail in the entry on\nempirical moral psychology, so we will not discuss them in detail\nhere; for now, we will note that such explanations are difficult to\nassess via survey methods alone. This is why it is especially helpful\nto look to the anthropological record, as Oliver Curry et al. (2019)\ndo in a recent publication. Curry hypothesizes that morality comprises\nstable, cooperative solutions to recurrent problems that can be\nmodeled as non-zero-sum games. There are a variety of such recurrent\nproblems, and game theory has established a suite of analytical tools\nfor diagnosing and solving them. Curry and his colleagues show that\nsuch solutions are always seen as either morally good or\nmorally neutral in societies at various stages of development, from\nsmall-band hunter gatherers to industrialized democracies. This\nresearch suggests that philosophers may have greatly exaggerated the\nextent of moral disagreement that actually exists.\n4.3 Moral Language\n\nOne reason disagreement is a useful measure of objectivity is that the\nimpossibility of faultless disagreement is taken to be characteristic\nof questions concerning objective matters of fact. That is, while we\nmight concede the possibility of faultless disagreements about matters\nconcerning the deliciousness of foods or the merits of a sports team,\nwhen we disagree over moral issues, we think that there is a correct\nanswer and that therefore at least one disputant is getting things\nwrong (for a discussion of the analogy between food and morality, see\nLoeb 2003). To the extent that people judge a disagreement to be\nfaultless, we might think that they are evincing a kind of\nanti-realism about the issue under dispute. This is yet another way\ndisagreement can bear on the realism/antirealism debate. Can\nexperimental evidence involving disagreement tell us anything about\nthe semantics of moral language?\n\nOne reason to think it can is that the very idea of faultless\ndisagreement strikes some as incoherent. In cases where one individual\nthinks (or says) that pistachio ice cream is delicious and another\nthinks (or says) that it is disgusting, we understand the two parties\nas expressing their own personal preference. To explain the apparent\nfaultlessness of the dispute, we reinterpret their thoughts or\nutterances as expressing something like, \u201cpistachio ice cream is\ndelicious [disgusting] to me.\u201d Because the two parties\ndo not genuinely contradict one another, we need not say that one of\nthem is mistaken. Faultlessness is therefore supposed to be a point in\nfavor of the moral anti-realist, since it seems to imply that there is\nno single content about which the parties disagree (and about which\none might be mistaken).\n\nBy contrast, realists claim that their view is better able to capture\nour intuition that there is a genuine disagreement at stake when one\nperson says that stealing is wrong and another says that stealing is\nnot wrong. In these cases, realists argue, we have the intuition that\nthere really is a conflict, and only a theory on which moral language\ninvolves attributing properties to acts and things, rather than\nreporting or expressing speakers\u2019 attitudes, can capture this\nintuition.\n\nWe have already seen some data bearing on this issue in our discussion\nof folk realism above. The claim here is not about realism per se, but\nabout whether experimental evidence can give us insight into the\nsemantics of moral language, since our intuitions about whether there\nis genuine faultlessness can tell us about whether there is a single\nshared content between two utterances\u2014a single proposition that\none party asserts and another denies\u2014or whether the two\nparties\u2019 utterances contain implicit relativizations. This has,\nat least, been the assumption guiding much of the debate over\ndisagreement and its implication for moral semantics. In recent work,\nhowever, John Khoo and Joshua Knobe (2018) have cast doubt on this\nassumption; their experiments indicate that subjects do not see\ndisagreement as requiring exclusionary content\u2014a single\nproposition that one party accepts and the other rejects. Intuitions\nabout disagreement may thus not be as straightforwardly tied to moral\nsemantics as philosophers have thought: judgments that two individuals\ngenuinely disagree about some claim do not necessarily imply a single\nshared content between the two speakers. This work is still in early\nstages, but it reveals the complications involved in reading semantics\noff disagreement.\n\nA further challenge for attempts to experimentally investigate moral\nsemantics is the debate within antirealism between cognitivism and\nnoncognitivism. According to the cognitivist, ordinary moral sentences\nare best understood as factual assertions, expressing propositions\nthat attribute moral properties (such as rightness or goodness) to\nthings (such as actions or characters). Noncognitivists (including\ntheir contemporary representatives, the expressivists) hold that moral\nlanguage has a fundamentally different function, to express attitudes\nor to issue commands, for example. While this debate seems ripe for\nexperimental investigation, the noncognitivist typically acknowledges\nthat their view is a reforming one. Furthermore, the semantics of our\nterms may be opaque to ordinary users, to the extent that we cannot\nread off semantics from intuitions but must investigate them\nindirectly. Lastly, the cognitivist and noncognitivist can agree on a\nnumber of empirical features of moral judgment and discourse; the\nchallenge for experimentalists is to find predictions that confirm one\nview while disconfirming the other. This is a relatively new area of\ninvestigation and, while not without challenges, ripe for\nexploration.\n5. Criticisms of Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nExperimental moral philosophy far outstrips what we have been able to\ncover here, and many issues and areas of productive research have\nbarely been touched upon. For example, experimental evidence is\nrelevant to moral questions in bioethics, such as euthanasia,\nabortion, genetic screening, and placebogenic interventions. Likewise,\nexperiments in behavioral economics and cognitive psychology are being\nemployed in asking moral questions about public policy (Bicchieri\n& Chavez 2010; Bicchieri & Xiao 2009). We neglect these\nissues only because of lack of space. In the few words remaining, we\nexplore some potential criticisms of experimental philosophy.\n5.1 Problems with Experimental Design and Interpretation\n\nAs a young field, experimental philosophy suffers from various\nproblems with experimental design and interpretation. These are not\ninsurmountable problems (Machery & Doris 2017), and they are\nproblems faced by related fields, such as social psychology, cognitive\npsychology, and behavioral economics.\n\nOne issue that has recently come to the fore is the problem of\nreplication (Romero\n 2019).[14]\n Statistical analysis is not deductive inference, and the mere fact\nthat statistical analysis yields a positive result does not guarantee\nthat anything has been discovered. Typically, an experimental result\nis only treated as \u201creal\u201d if its p-value\nis at most .05, but such a value just\nindicates, roughly, the probability that the observation in question\nor a more extreme observation would have been made if the null\nhypothesis were true. It is not the probability that the null\nhypothesis is false given the\n observation.[15]\n So, even when statistical analysis indicates that the null hypothesis\nis to be rejected, that indication can be erroneous, and the null\nhypothesis might still be quite plausible. \n\nWe should also expect other failures of replication because of a bias\nbuilt into the system of funding experimentation and publishing\nresults. Since experimentalists are reluctant to report (and even\ndiscouraged by journal editors and referees from reporting) null\nresults (i.e., results where the p-value is more\nthan .05), for every published result there may be any number of\nunpublished non-results (Rosenthal 1979).\n\nAnother worry is that simultaneously testing many intuition-probes can\nlead unwary experimenters on fishing expeditions. Suppose an\nexperimental philosopher conducts an experiment with two conditions:\nin the experimental condition, participants are primed with\ndeterministic ideas, while in the control condition they are not\nprimed one way or another. She asks participants twenty different\nquestions about their moral intuitions, for instance, whether there is\nfree will, whether malefactors deserve to be punished, whether virtue\ndeserves to be rewarded, and so on. She then makes pairwise\ncomparisons of their responses to each of the questions in an attempt\nto figure out whether deterministic priming induces changes in moral\nintuitions. She thus makes twenty independent comparisons, each at the\nindustry-standard 5% level. Suppose now for the sake of argument that\nthere is no effect\u2014that all null hypotheses are true. In that\ncase, the probability that at least one of these tests will result in\na Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis even though it is true)\nis 64%. More generally, when an experimenter performs n\nindependent comparisons at the 5% level, the\nprobability of at least one Type I error is \\(1-.95^n\\). This problem\ncan be addressed by various procedures, most notably the Tukey method\nand the Bonferroni\n method.[16]\n\nMultiple testing without correction is a form of\np-hacking (Simmons, Nelson & Simohnson 2011).\n\u201cP-hacking\u201d refers to a family of practices that increase\nthe probability of obtaining a significant result by capitalizing on\nchance, such as dropping outliers, testing statistical models with and\nwithout covariates, and uncorrected multiple testing. While p-hacking\nmight be surprisingly frequent in psychology (John, Loewenstein\n& Prelec 2012), it appears rare in experimental\nphilosophy (Stuart, Cola\u00e7o & Machery 2018). \n\nThe best way to tell whether such a result carries any evidential\nvalue is for the experiment to be replicated\u2014preferably by\nanother research group. If a result cannot be robustly replicated, it\nis probably a mirage. Such mirages have turned up to a disturbing\nextent recently, as Daniel Kahneman has famously pointed out (Yong\n2012; see also Wagenmakers et al. 2012). Kahneman proposed a\n\u201cdaisy chain\u201d of replication, where no result in\npsychology would be published until it had been successfully\nreplicated by another prominent lab. This proposal has not yet been\n(and may never be) instituted, but it has raised the problem of\nreplication to salience, and a related project has taken off. The\nreproducibility project in psychology aims to establish the extent to\nwhich prominent, published results can be\n replicated.[17]\n Experimental philosophers have followed suit with their own\nreplication project (see the Other Internet Resources). This work has\nrecently yielded encouraging fruit: a large collaborative replication\neffort suggests that approximately 7 out of 10 experimental philosophy\nresults can be reproduced, whereas similar efforts show that less than\nhalf of the results in biomedicine, economics, and psychology are\nreplicable (Cova et al. 2021, Other Internet Resources). On the other\nhand, as discussed throughout this entry, many influential\nexperimental studies in moral psychology have failed to\nreplicate. \n5.2 Philosophical Problems\n\nOne might object that the real problem with experimental moral\nphilosophy is not with science, but with its relevance (or more\nprecisely, its irrelevance) to moral philosophy. The objection is that\nmoral philosophy is concerned not with how we are and what we do, but\nwith how we ought to be and what we ought to do. As such, it is a\nnormative enterprise, and is unaffected by empirical results. Science\nis hard, but so is morality; if we fail to understand and live up to\nthe demands of the latter, that doesn\u2019t show a problem with our\nmoral theory but with our moral natures.\n\nExperimental philosophers can agree with this objection, up to a\npoint. No one is suggesting that we read morality directly off survey\nresults. But, to return to the point with which we began, while\nmorality is normative, it is also essentially practical. Moral theory\nis a theory about what we ought to do: a theory about how creatures\nlike us ought to conduct ourselves and interact with one another. A\nmorality completely divorced from our natures, that demanded acts\nimpossible from us, would surely be unacceptable. This is not just a\npoint about experimental philosophy; utilitarianism is sometimes\ncritiqued as making unrealistic demands of impartiality. Alongside the\nfamous proscription against deriving an ought from an\nis, we also find the dictum that ought implies can.\nThe exact extent to which morality can be demanding without being\nunrealistic is itself a philosophical question, and so experimental\nmoral philosophy works in conjunction with philosophical analysis; it\ndoes not aim to eliminate it. Exactly how the two relate to each\nother, and how empirical evidence will bear on and influence debates\nin moral theory in the future, is a contested issue, but surely\ntraditional moral theory and experimental moral philosophy have much\nto learn from one another (Doris, Machery & Stich 2017).\n\nWe need to proceed cautiously here. No one doubts that what we ought\nto do depends on how things are non-morally. For example, the moral\nclaim that a given man deserves to be punished presupposes the\nnon-moral fact that he committed the crime. It should come as no\nsurprise, then, that experimental evidence might be relevant in this\nway to morality. Whether experimental evidence is relevant to\ndiscovering the fundamental moral principles\u2014those meant to be\nput into action one way or another depending on how the world is\nnon-morally\u2014is still subject to debate.\n\nAnother version of this argument says that fundamental moral\nphilosophical principles are, if true at all, necessarily true, and\nthat empirical research can establish at best only contingent\n truths.[18]\n But if fundamental moral theories are necessary, then they are\nnecessary for creatures like us. And one thing that empirical\ninvestigation can do is to help establish what sorts of creatures we\nare. Imagination needs material to work with. When one sits in\none\u2019s armchair, imagining a hypothetical scenario, one makes a\nwhole host of assumptions about what people are like, how\npsychological processes work, and so on. These assumptions can be\nempirically well or poorly informed. It\u2019s hard to see why anyone\ncould doubt that being well informed is to be preferred. Likewise\nit\u2019s hard to see how anyone could doubt the relevance of\nexperimental evidence to better grounding our empirical assumptions,\nin this case our assumptions relevant to moral philosophy. Exactly how\nexperimental\u2014or more broadly, empirical\u2014evidence is\nrelevant, and how relevant it is, are at present hotly contested\nmatters.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abelson, R., 1997. \u201cOn the surprising longevity of flogged\nhorses: Why there is a case for the significance test\u201d,\n<em>Psychological Science</em>, 8(1): 12\u201315.", "Adams, F., &amp; Steadman, A., 2004. \u201cIntentional action in\nordinary language: Core concept or pragmatic understanding?\u201d\n<em>Analysis</em>, 64: 173\u2013181.", "Adams, F., &amp; Steadman, A., 2007. \u201cFolk concepts,\nsurveys, and intentional action\u201d, in C.
