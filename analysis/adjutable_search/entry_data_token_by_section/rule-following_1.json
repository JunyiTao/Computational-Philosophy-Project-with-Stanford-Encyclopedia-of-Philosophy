    "main_text": "The Sceptical Argument\n2. The Sceptical Argument\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with a brief outline of the argument of\nKripke\u2019s sceptic. Suppose that I\u2019ve never dealt with\nnumbers larger than\n 57.[3]\n (Given our finite nature and the infinitude of the natural number\nseries, there will always in fact be such a number.) I\u2019m asked\nto perform the computation \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019,\nand I arrive at the\nanswer \u2018125\u2019, which I take to be right. However, a\n\u201cbizarre skeptic\u201d (Kripke 1982: 8) questions my certainty.\nShe suggests that in the past I used \u2018plus\u2019 and\n\u2018+\u2019 to mean a different function, which she calls\n\u201cquaddition\u201d. Quaddition yields the same result as\naddition if the numbers are lower than 57, and 5 otherwise, so the\ncorrect result of the aforementioned computation is \u20185\u2019,\nnot \u2018125\u2019. I should answer \u20185\u2019 if I intend to\nuse \u2018plus\u2019 in the same way in which I have been using it\nin the past, or so the sceptic suggests.\n\nKripke allows that the sceptic\u2019s proposal is \u201cabsolutely\nwild\u201d, and that she is \u201ccrazy\u201d if she\n\u201cproposes [her] hypothesis sincerely\u201d. He grants, however,\nthat it is not logically impossible, and so \u201cthere must be some\nfact about my past usage that can be cited to refute\u201d that\nhypothesis (1982: 9). That is, there must be some fact about my past\nusage that determines that I meant addition by\n\u2018plus\u2019 in the past, and thus that (again, assuming that I\nintend to use the expression in the same way I have been using it so\nfar) I should answer \u2018125\u2019 rather than \u20185\u2019.\nImportantly, the sceptic does not question my memory concerning past\nuse; indeed, she goes as far as to allow that the exercise of my\ncognitive powers is faultless, and that I have access to all the facts\nabout my mind and behaviour that are potentially constitutive of my\nmeaning one thing rather than another (1982: 14). Her thought is that\nif I am not able, even in such cognitively ideal conditions, to\nprovide the fact in virtue of which I mean addition, a fact\nthat properly singles out the function of addition rather than the\nfunction of quaddition, it is because there is no such fact.\nFurthermore, the focus is on past use because \u201cif I use language\nat all, I cannot doubt coherently that \u2018plus\u2019, as I now\nuse it, denotes plus\u201d (1982: 13). But, if the sceptic\u2019s\nchallenge succeeds, it can be generalized, for \u201cif there was no\nsuch thing as my meaning plus rather than quus in the past, neither\ncan there be any such thing in the present\u201d (1982: 21). (The\nfact that the sceptic grants the idealisation of our cognitive powers\nin the way that she does shows that her argument is not of a piece\nwith the argument of the epistemological sceptic, who is concerned\nwith whether our actual cognitive capacities can lead to knowledge.\nSee Boghossian 1989 [2002: 150]. For dissent over this point, see\nGinsborg 2018. Martin Kusch takes the argument to be metaphysical\n[2006: xiv], but, in contrast with Boghossian, he takes the dialogic\nsetting to play an essential role in it.)\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, the search for a fact fails, and the sceptic\nconcludes that \u201cthe entire idea of meaning vanishes into thin\nair\u201d (Kripke 1982: 22). Kripke rejects this paradoxical\nconclusion as \u201cinsane and intolerable\u201d (1982: 60) and\n\u201cincredible and self-defeating\u201d (1982: 71), and goes on to\ndevelop, on behalf of Wittgenstein, a sceptical solution, which he\ntakes to be similar in some respects to David Hume\u2019s solution to\nthe sceptical problem about causation (1982: 4; 62\u201369), and\nwhich purports to conceive of meaning in a way that does not lead to\nparadox. We discuss the sceptical solution in\n section 3.\n (George Wilson was the first to insist on the significance of the\ndistinction between the parts of the sceptic\u2019s position\nKripke\u2019s Wittgenstein accepts and the parts he\nrejects\u2014between the basic sceptical conclusion,\naccording to which there are no facts about a speaker of the sort that\nthe sceptic is seeking that constitute her meaning something by an\nexpression, and the radical sceptical conclusion, according\nto which no one means anything by an expression [Wilson 1994, 1998].\nWe will return to Wilson\u2019s view in\n section 3.3.)\n\nWhy does Kripke take the search for candidate meaning facts to fail?\nRecall that all my previous uses of \u2018+\u2019 are compatible\nwith my meaning quaddition, which is what enables the sceptic\nto say that I meant that all along. One might complain that the\nchallenge operates from a \u201cridiculous model of\ninstruction\u201d (1982: 15), which fails to take into account that\nto be a competent adder is to have internalized a general instruction\nor rule that is now \u201cengraved on my mind as on a slate\u201d\nand which \u201cjustifies and determines my present response\u201d\n(1982: 15\u201316). But the sceptic will reply that the worry can be\nraised again with respect to the general instruction or rule, which is\njust as susceptible to being interpreted in a deviant way as the\ninitial expression. Kripke then considers a variety of other\ncandidates, which are the kernel of various philosophical theories,\nand argues, on behalf of the sceptic, that none of them fit the bill.\nAmong the facts considered are my being disposed to produce the sum\n(1982: 22\u201332), my instantiating a machine whose operations\nembody the function of addition (1982: 32\u201335), the simplicity of\nthe addition hypothesis (1982: 37\u201339), my having a distinctive\nexperience \u201cwith its own special quale, known directly\u201d\nthrough introspection (1982: 41), my having an image in mind that\nsupposedly singles out addition (1982: 42), my being in a primitive,\nirreducible state of meaning addition (1982: 51\u201353), and my\ngrasping an abstract entity, such as a Fregean sense, which singles\nout addition (1982: 53\u201354). None of them, Kripke argues, is\nsuccessful in ruling out the skeptic\u2019s hypothesis that I meant\nquaddition rather than addition.\n\nAs mentioned above, dispositionalism and non-reductionism are the most\nprominently discussed proposals, and we\u2019ll consider them more\ncarefully in\n section 4\n and\n section 5,\n respectively. At this stage, we should ask the following question:\nwhat are the conditions that a candidate meaning fact must meet? There\nis controversy in the literature about their nature and\nplausibility.\n",
