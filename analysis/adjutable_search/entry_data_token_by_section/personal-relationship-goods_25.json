It seems important to draw a distinction\nbetween how feasible it is to enforce duties corresponding to the\nright to enjoy personal relationship goods, and how desirable it is to\nenforce the duties in particular circumstances. Some (Cowden 2012b)\nrun the two considerations together, while others (Brownlee 2013)\ndistinguish them.\n\nFor instance, it may be undesirable to enforce a duty to provide\npersonal relationship goods because we lack a legitimate way of doing\nit\u2014we do not know how to enforce the duty without violating some\nrights. As some have noted (Collins 2013), duties to associate with\nothers in adult personal relationships limits freedom of association;\nbut perhaps freedom of association is much more restrictive in nature\nand scope than we tend to think (Brownlee forthcoming).\n\nIf a person has a right to a certain good, this means that if the\nright is violated she is owed compensation. But, in some cases, the\nloss cannot be compensated because certain goods have significant and\nunique non-instrumental value. At least some personal relationship\ngoods\u2014such as love and friendship\u2014are like this (Gheaus\n2009). The loss of other personal relationship goods seems impossible\nto compensate due to their instrumental value to survival, functioning\nand autonomy. Even if emotional care for children, or decent social\ninteraction amongst adults, had only instrumental value, if it is true\nthat these goods are necessary for minimally good health, their\nabsence cannot be compensated.\n\nThe impossibility of compensation may be relevant for the importance\nof protecting the any rights to personal relationship goods\u2014like\nin the case of the right to life. It may count as an argument that it\nis more urgent to provide (opportunities to) personal relationship\ngoods than other goods to the provision of which we have a right.\n",
