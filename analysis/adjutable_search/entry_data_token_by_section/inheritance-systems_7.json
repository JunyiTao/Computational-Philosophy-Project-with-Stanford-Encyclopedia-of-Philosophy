    "main_text": "Reproduction and Replication || The reproducer concept\n2.3 The reproducer concept\n\nJames Griesemer has proposed the reproducer as a fundamental\nnotion for thinking about reproduction in evolution. A reproducer is\nan entity that multiplies with material overlap between parent and\noffspring, transferring mechanisms conferring the capacity to develop\nthe capacity to reproduce (Griesemer 2000a: S361, 2000b, 2000c, see\nalso the entry on\n replication,\n section 8). By definition, being a reproducer is a property\napplicable to systems that have developmental capacities. In contrast\nwith traditional accounts of natural selection that focus on heredity,\nGriesemer\u2019s analysis of reproduction processes attempts to\nintegrate heredity and development in a single conceptual scheme.\nGodfrey-Smith has argued that both requirements emphasized by\nGriesemer \u2014 material overlap between generations, and the\ncapacity to develop \u2014 are too strong, and are not required for a\nformal account of evolution via natural selection per se\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 83\u201384).\n\nBased on the reproducer concept, Griesemer has proposed an analysis of\nmodes of multiplication in which reproduction, inheritance, and\nreplication are special cases of multiplication processes (Griesemer\n2000a: S360; 2000c). According to this classification, inheritance\nprocesses are reproduction processes in which there are evolved\nmechanisms for producing hereditary relations in development.\nReplication processes in turn are inheritance processes with\nevolved coding mechanisms. Thus, replication (which is contrasted by\nGriesemer with mere copying) is a special case of inheritance, itself\na special case of biological reproduction. Genetic inheritance is a\nreplication process and as such it involves coding mechanisms. Since\ngenes do not constitute mechanisms of development in their own right,\nbut are pieces of mechanisms, Griesemer argues that they cannot have\nthe privileged explanatory role often accorded to them (Griesemer\n2000a: 364). According to Griesemer\u2019s classification, epigenetic\ninheritance processes can be classified as inheritance processes which\nare not replication processes (Griesemer 2000c: 250).\n\nBoth Griesemer and Godfrey-Smith applied their respective notions of\nreproducers to the question of collective reproduction, involving\nentities that can reproduce but that contain other things than can\nalso reproduce (see Godfrey-Smith 2012, Griesemer 2018; for further\ndiscussion see entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n The paradigmatic test cases are multi-cellular organisms (arguably,\ncollective reproducers) and animal groups (who are arguably not).\nGriesemer focuses on the role of scaffolding and levels of\ncompositional organization, while Godfrey-Smith characterizes\ncollective reproduction according to the degree of overall integration\nof the reproducer, the degree of reproductive (germ/soma)\nspecialization, and the degree of a reproductive bottleneck. The\nproperties characterizing collective reproducers are arguably related\nto the inheritance systems involved (for one intriguing suggestion\nconcerned with the role of epigenetic inheritance in the origin of the\ngerm-line see Lachmann & Libby 2016). \n\nGriesemer\u2019s classification of reproducers is an abstraction\nhierarchy. It provides a formal taxonomy of reproducers, arranging\nthem in a series of nested classes. The classification of inheritance\nsystems suggested by Jablonka and Lamb (Jablonka 2001; Jablonka &\nLamb 2005/2014) discussed in the next section, in contrast, enumerates\ntypes of concrete inheritance systems found in the living world.\n",
