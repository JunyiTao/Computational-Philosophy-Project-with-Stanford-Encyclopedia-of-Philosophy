Early Criticism of Husserl\u2019s Arguments\n\nWhile Frege\u2019s antipsychologism received scant attention,\nHusserl\u2019s Prolegomena were widely discussed in\nGerman-speaking philosophy between 1901 and 1920. Here I shall only be\nable to present a few of the critical replies (cf. Kusch 1995, Chs. 4\nand 5). While my selection is itself based upon an evaluation \u2014\nI have tried to pick arguments with at least some (initial)\nplausibility \u2014 I shall not here try to assess the strengths and\nweaknesses of the various responses. Nor do I have the space to\ndescribe the more general, and sometimes highly contested,\nphilosophical presuppositions upon which the replies are based. \n\nThe Southwest-German School of Neokantians was particularly critical\nof Husserl\u2019s claim that logic qua normative-practical\ndiscipline must be based upon logic as a theoretical science. On their\nbehalf, Richard Kroner (1909) defended the view that logical laws are\nimperatives, and that these imperatives are founded on values (1909,\n241). Kroner insists that not all \u2018ought-sentences\u2019 are\nfounded on non-normative, theoretical sentences. Only hypothetical\nimperatives (and their cognate ought-sentences) fit Husserl\u2019s\nanalysis. For instance, the hypothetical ought-sentence (a)\n\u2026\n\n(a) If you want to ride a horse well, you ought to be able to\ncontrol it, sit tight, etc.\n\n\n\u2026 indeed presupposes the theoretical, non-normative sentence\n(b) \u2026\n\n(b) Riding a horse well is possible only if one is able to\ncontrol the horse, sit tight, etc.\n\n\nHowever, categorical ought-sentences demand a different\nanalysis, Kroner maintains. The categorical ought-sentence\n(a\u2032) \u2026\n\n(a\u2032) A warrior ought to be courageous\n\n\n\u2026 is not based upon the theoretical sentence\n(b\u2032) \u2026\n\n(b\u2032) It is part of the concept of a good warrior that\nhe is courageous.\n\n\nIn the case of categorical ought-sentences, the order of\npresupposition is reversed: the non-normative sentence\n(b\u2032) derives its justification or meaning from the\nnormative one (a\u2032). To model the relation between\n(a\u2032) and (b\u2032) on the relation between\n(a) and (b) \u2018would be to practice moral\nphilosophy in a Socratic fashion, that is, it would imply a one-sided\nintellectualistic interpretation of the concept of value\u2019 (1909,\n242). Kroner thinks that the case of logic is similar to the case of\nmorals. The highest logical norm is something like (a\u2033)\n\u2026\n\n(a\u2033) Every reasoner ought to think what is true\n\n\n\u2026 and this norm is primary with respect to (b\u2033)\n\u2026\n\n(b\u2033) It is part of the concept of the good reasoner\nthat she thinks what is true.\n\n\nAnd this analysis of the most basic logical norm also applies to all\nother logical norms (1909, 242). (For important recent discussion of\nthe relation between Neokantianism and psychologism, see Anderson\n2005, Beiser 2009, Edgar 2007.) \n\nHusserl\u2019s (and Frege\u2019s) arguments for a sharp distinction\nbetween logical and psychological laws \u2014 that that only the\nlatter are vague and based on induction \u2014 were targeted often;\nespecially forcefully by Moritz Schlick (1910):\n\nOne sees immediately that one might with equal right infer the\nopposite: since logical structures, inferences, judgments and concepts\nundoubtedly result from psychological processes, we are entitled to\ninfer from the existence of logical rules that there are perfectly\nexact psychological laws as well\u2026. The proponent of\n\u201cabsolute\u201d logic cannot defend his position simply by\nclaiming that all psychological laws are vague; for this amounts to a\npetitio principii (Schlick 1910, 409).\n\n\nOr:\n\nHe who regards logical principles as exact laws of thought [and thus\nas laws of nature] will of course deny that all laws of nature are\nmerely probably valid \u2026 (1910, 410)\n\n\nHusserl\u2019s characterization of logical laws as known a priori\nalso met with opposition. According to Gerardus Heymans, all\nepistemology can say, for the time being, with respect to a logical\nlaw like the Principle of Non-Contradiction is that\n\u2018probably all human beings reject contradiction\u2019\n(1905, 66). Our knowledge of logical laws is more probable than our\nknowledge of other psychological laws only \u2018because we\nexperiment, throughout our life, daily and every hour, with these\nelementary relations between phenomena of consciousness\u2019 (1905,\n33).\n\nSchlick (1910) also challenges Husserl\u2019s claim that laws of\nlogic do not imply the existence of matters of fact. Schlick maintains\nthat psychological acts of judgment and logical sentences are\nintertwined, such that the logical sentence and its truth\n\n\u2026can never be found independently of the act of judgment; the\nlogical sentence is included in the latter and results from it via\nabstraction\u2026. the logical sentence has its place only\nin the mental experience and does not exist outside of it in\nany sense. The two cannot be separated; the judgment as logical\nstructure, as \u201cideal meaning\u201d \u2026 comes to be, once\none abstracts, within the real experience of judging, from all\nindividual and temporal elements. And even though one can abstract\nfrom all individual-psychological factors, one cannot abstract from\nthe psychological in general. In other words, one cannot understand\nlogical sentences as structures without psychological quality.\nPace Husserl, logical sentences imply the existence of\nexperiences of judging. For if we take away, from any chosen judgment,\neverything which is psychological, we only remain with the matter of\nfact that the judgment expresses and upon which it is based (1910,\n405).\n\n\nDefenders of psychologistic renderings of logical principles and\nsyllogistic also stood their ground. Recall that Husserl argued\nagainst Heymans as follows: \n\n\n 1. If the laws of syllogistics were (hardwired) psychological\nlaws of thought, then no human reasoner could ever deviate from these\nlaws.\n\n2. Human\nreasoners commit fallacies, i.e. they deviate from the laws of\nsyllogistics.\n\nThe laws of syllogistics are not (hardwired) psychological laws\nof thought.\n\n\nIn his reply, Heymans denies Husserl\u2019s claim according to which\nfallacies are deviations from the laws of syllogistics. For Heymans,\nsomeone who does not derive the right conclusion from given premises\nis confused about the meaning of the major, middle or minor terms, not\nlacking knowledge of the inference schemes. In the case of fallacies\nthe causes of the deviation from the laws of syllogistics are\n\n\u2026as it were, prior to the thought processes. The\npremises are not the right ones, or are not clearly grasped or wrongly\nunderstood; but a principal difference in laws of thought [between\nlaws of thought in the cases of correct and incorrect inferring]\ncannot be claimed to exist\u2026. As concerns the question whether\nthere are cases which can only be explained by assuming such a\ndifference, one might say that the burden of proof is on the side of\nthose who claim that there are such cases. As long as such cases have\nnot been firmly established, the theory of knowledge can rest content\nwith accepting the fact that people think according to logical laws\n\u2026 (1905, 69)\n\n\nSome of Husserl\u2019s case against psychologism rested on showing\nthat it is a form of skeptical relativism, and that skeptical\nrelativism is self-refuting. The latter claim was first doubted by\nPaul Natorp (1901). In his review of the Prolegomena Natorp\nhints at the possibility that Husserl\u2019s arguments against\nrelativism and skepticism are guilty of a petitio:\n\n[For Husserl] skepticism is \u2026 absurd. (But perhaps only for\nthose who want strictly valid theories at all costs. The skeptic might\nsay that he too wants such theories, but that he feels that they are\nan impossible ideal \u2026). Husserl then studies skepticism and\nskeptical relativism in its individualistic form; he claims that\n\u201cas soon as this position is formulated, it is already\nrefuted\u201d \u2014 at least for those who understand the\nobjectivity of logic. (But this is precisely what the skeptic denies.)\n(1901, 274)\n\n\nRecall that Husserl\u2019s case against psychologism centrally relies\non the claim that truths exist independently of whether or not they\nare ever grasped by anyone. Schlick (1910) called this assumption\n\u2018the independence theory of truth\u2019. It was frequently\nattacked. Since Husserl provided the clearest statement of the\nindependence theory of truth in the context of his criticism of\nChristoph Sigwart, it seems only fair to start the summary of\nrepudiations with this author. In the Prolegomena Husserl\ndisagrees with Sigwart\u2019s claim that no judgment can be true\nunless it is actually thought by someone. Husserl regards it as part\nof the meaning of the law of gravity that the law is true for all\ntimes, that is, even prior to its discovery and regardless of whether\nit is ever formulated by anyone. Sigwart (1921) accuses Husserl of\nconflating truth with reality:\n\nIn the original sense of the terms, only assertions or opinions can be\ntrue or false. And assertions or opinions necessarily presuppose\nthinking subjects who entertain the opinions or utter the assertions.\nTo postulate \u201csentences\u201d as independent essences is sheer\nmythology. Insofar as Husserl speaks of \u201ccontradictory\nfacts\u201d that cannot both be true, he conflates \u201ctrue\u201d\nand \u201creal\u201d. And thus Husserl lapses into the same\nconceptual confusion that the German Criminal Code is guilty of when\nit speaks of \u2026 \u201cpretence of false facts\u201d\u2026.\nOnly an opinion, a report about a fact, can be false. But a fact is\nsimply there \u2026 When no judgments have been made, then there is\nnothing of which \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d could be\npredicated. Of course, the planets did move, already long before\nNewton, in a way that conforms to the law of gravity. However, before\nNewton formulated his theory (\u2026) no true sentence about these\nmovements existed within human knowledge. After Newton formulated the\nlaw of gravity as a sentence, this sentence became, due to its\ncontent, true for the past as well (1921, 23).\n\n\nSchlick (1910) agrees: \u2018There is no truth of judgments such that\nthis truth is independent of the judgments\u2019 existence in mental\nacts. Only the facts upon which true judgments are based, are\nindependent of us\u2019 (403). However, Schlick goes further than\nSigwart by trying to explain Husserl\u2019s alleged conflation: \n\nThe mistake of the independence theory is based upon a fallacious\ndistinction between ideas and objects of ideas. In the case of\nconcrete ideas, say ideas of [physical] objects that I can [literally]\ngrasp, this distinction makes sense; after all, I distinguish between\nthe book lying in front of me on the table, and my idea of that book.\nBut, in the case of abstract ideas, object and content coincide, i.e.\nthe object of the idea is nowhere to be found, except within that very\nidea. And thus logical sentences and acts of judging are absolutely\ninseparable (1910, 407).\n\n\nHusserl\u2019s distinction between the act and content of judgments\nwas questioned by other commentators as well. Wilhelm Jerusalem (1905)\nputs his criticism in the context of a defense of species relativism.\nHe especially disagrees with Husserl\u2019s claim that \u2018the\nsame content of a judgment cannot be true for one species and false\nfor another\u2019. Jerusalem replies:\n\nIf the two species in question are totally differently organized, or\n\u201cconstituted\u201d, then there are no contents of judgments\nthat are identical for both. For some purposes one can distinguish\nbetween the act and content of a judgment, by reflecting on, or\nattending to, one or another of the two. But the act and the content\ncannot be separated in such a way that the one could remain constant\nwhile the other is changed. The act and the content of a judgment\npenetrate each other completely and every change in the act leads to a\nchange in the content\u2026. Thus it is not absurd to restrict truth\nto human knowledge; what is absurd is rather to speak of\nidentical contents of judgments in the case of differently organized\nspecies (1905, 104).\n\n\nHusserl\u2019s equation of psychologism with species relativism was\nfirst and foremost targeting Erdmann. In a footnote to the second\nedition of his Logische Elementarlehre (1907), Erdmann\nlaments that Husserl has misconstrued his views. And in a footnote he\ngives a new defense of his claim that the laws of logic have only\nhypothetical necessity:\n\nWe are unable to prove that the logical basic laws of our thinking\n\u2026 are the conditions and norms of all possible thinking. Thus\nwe have to allow for the real possibility of a thinking that differs\nfrom ours. This concession has to be made, first of all, because\nscience is not meant to exclude the religious convictions of religious\nconsciousness \u2026 [i.e. science has no right to infer with the\nbelief that God may have a different logic]. Secondly, this concession\nalso has to be made insofar as \u2026 it is no more than an\nempirical experience that we think and an empirical\nexperience of how we think. This experience is not changed by\nthe fact that we are indeed bound to the conditions of our\nthinking, and that our valid thinking has to submit to the logical\nnorms that we formulate. We are not even able to claim that our\nthinking will always be bound to these conditions and norms, for we\nhave no right to assume that our thinking will be eternal. The days of\nthe human species on earth are numbered too \u2026 And even if the\nhuman species did not just belong to one period of the development of\nthe earth or the solar system, even then we should not dare proclaim\nour thinking invariable. We could proclaim such invariability only if\nwe were able to directly grasp the essence of our soul as an\nindependent, invariable substance \u2014 in the way assumed by a\nrational psychology \u2014 and if we could deduce the invariability\nof our thinking. But this we are unable to do as long as we hold on to\nthe idea that psychology can determine the stock and connections of\npsychological life-processes only via observation \u2014 like any\nother science of facts. Finally, our thinking has developed out of\nless complicated forms of mental representation, and thus we have no\nright to rule out further development towards higher complexity of\nthought, a development that calls for different norms. Be it added,\nhowever, \u2026 that we have no reason to expect such further\ndevelopment \u2026 But here we are concerned not with probability\nbut with possibility (1907, 531\u201332)\n\n\nIn Husserl\u2019s overall argument, self-evidence figures in two\ndistinct ways. On the one hand, Husserl claims self-evidence for the\nthought that no other species could have a different logic from ours.\nOn the other hand, Husserl denies both that purely logical sentences\nsay anything about self-evidence and that self-evidence is a criterion\nof truth. \n\nCritics of Husserl\u2019s view on self-evidence attacked one or both\nof these lines of thought. Wilhelm Wundt (1910) for example complains\nthat Husserl never gives satisfactory definitions of his key terms: in\nHusserl\u2019s Logische Untersuchungen\n\n\u2026 every definition amounts to the explanation that the concept\nin question is a specific experience which cannot be defined at all.\nThis observation also holds for that concept which plays the most\ncentral role in Husserl\u2019s logical investigations: the concept of\nself-evidence (1910, 611).\n\n\nWundt suggests the following explanation for Husserl\u2019s alleged\ninability to define self-evidence:\n\nEven more strange than the failure of psychologism is the fact that\nlogicism [i.e. Brentano\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s position]\nfares no better. The latter fares no better despite its emphatic\nappeal to the self-evidence of logical laws. This is because\nlogicism\u2019s appeal [to the self-evidence of logical laws] moves\nin a continuing circle: it declares logical laws self-evident, but\nthen again it bases self-evidence upon the validity of logical laws.\nIn order to escape this circle, logicism can do no better than explain\nthat self-evidence is an ultimate fact which cannot be further\ndefined. And since a fact can only be regarded as existing if it is\nsomehow given within a perception (Anschauung, intuition), it\nis understandable that logicism treats immediate perception and\nindefinability as equivalent modes of justification\u2026. However,\nsince every immediate perception is a psychological process, the\nappeal to immediate perception amounts to a relapse into psychologism\n\u2026 (1910, 623\u201325).\n\n\nSchlick (1910) is especially concerned to point out that\nHusserl\u2019s two treatments of self-evidence contradict one\nanother. As Schlick sees it, the second employment contradicts the\nfirst. Schlick writes:\n\n[Husserl\u2019s] absolute, independent truth would be unrecognizable\nin every sense. Even if it could, through a miracle, enter into the\nhuman intellect, how in the world could we recognise the truth as the\ntruth? According to Husserl the criterion is self-evidence.\nAt one point he begins a defense of the independence theory with the\nwords: \u201cThe following relation is self-evidently given\n(durch Einsicht gegeben)\u201d; some pages later we read, as\nif to confirm the earlier claim: \u201cIf we were not allowed to\ntrust self-evidence any more, how could we make, and reasonably\ndefend, any assertions at all?\u201d But this obviously amounts to\nnothing else than a flight into the theory of self-evidence! It is\nbeyond doubt that in these quoted sentences Husserl advocates\n\u201cthe real theory of self-evidence\u201d, a theory that he\nhimself rejects with the following drastic words: \u201cOne feels\ninclined to ask what the authority of that feeling [of self-evidence]\nis based upon, how that feeling can guarantee the truth of a judgment,\nhow it can \u2018mark a statement with the stamp of truth\u2019,\n\u2018announce\u2019 its truth, \u2026\u201d Nothing can hide the\nfact that our author here contradicts himself, not even the appeal to\nhis distinction between ideal possibility of self-evidence relating to\n\u201csentences\u201d and real self-evidence relating to acts of\njudging. After all, in this context we are dealing with factual,\nreal knowledge of the truth, i.e. with real, psychological\nself-evidence. In fact it is only this real self-evidence that exists\n\u2026 (1910, 415).\n\n",
