Introduction: The Challenge of Environmental Ethics\n\nSuppose putting out natural fires, culling feral animals or removing\nsome individual members of overpopulated species is necessary for the\nprotection of the integrity of a certain ecosystem. Will these actions\nbe morally permissible or even required? Is it morally acceptable for\nfarmers in non-industrial countries to practise slash and burn\ntechniques to clear areas for agriculture? Consider a mining company\nwhich has performed open pit mining in some previously unspoiled area.\nDoes the company have a moral obligation to restore the landform and\nsurface ecology? And what is the value of a humanly restored\nenvironment compared with the originally natural environment? Many\npeople think that it is morally wrong for human beings to pollute and\ndestroy parts of the natural environment and to consume a huge\nproportion of the planet\u2019s natural resources. If that is wrong,\nis it simply because a sustainable environment is essential to human\nexistence and well-being? Or is such behaviour also wrong because the\nnatural environment and/or its various contents have certain values in\ntheir own right so that these values ought to be respected and\nprotected in any case? These are among the questions investigated by\nenvironmental ethics. Some of them are specific questions faced by\nindividuals in particular circumstances, while others are more global\nquestions faced by groups and communities. Yet others are more\nabstract questions concerning the value and moral standing of the\nnatural environment and its non-human components.\n\nIn the literature on environmental ethics the distinction between\ninstrumental value and\n intrinsic value\n (in the sense of \u201cnon-instrumental value\u201d) is of\nconsiderable importance. The former is the value of things as\nmeans to further some other ends, whereas the latter is the\nvalue of things as ends in themselves regardless of whether\nthey are also useful as means to other ends. For instance, certain\nfruits have instrumental value for bats who feed on them, since\nfeeding on the fruits is a means to survival for the bats. However, it\nis not widely agreed that fruits have value as ends in themselves. We\ncan likewise think of a person who teaches others as having\ninstrumental value for those who want to acquire knowledge. Yet, in\naddition to any such value, it is normally said that a person, as a\nperson, has intrinsic value, i.e., value in their own right\nindependently of their prospects for serving the ends of others. For\nanother example, a certain wild plant may have instrumental value\nbecause it provides the ingredients for some medicine or as an\naesthetic object for human observers. But if the plant also has some\nvalue in itself independently of its prospects for furthering some\nother ends such as human health, or the pleasure from aesthetic\nexperience, then the plant also has intrinsic value. Because the\nintrinsically valuable is that which is good as an end in itself, it\nis commonly agreed that something\u2019s possession of intrinsic\nvalue generates a prima facie direct moral duty on the part of moral\nagents to protect it or at least refrain from damaging it (see\nO\u2019Neil 1992 and Jamieson 2002 for detailed accounts of intrinsic\nvalue).\n\nMany traditional western ethical perspectives, however, are\nanthropocentric or human-centered in that either they assign\nintrinsic value to human beings alone (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a strong sense) or they assign a\nsignificantly greater amount of intrinsic value to human beings than\nto any non-human things such that the protection or promotion of human\ninterests or well-being at the expense of non-human things turns out\nto be nearly always justified (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a weak sense). For example, Aristotle\n(Politics, Bk. 1, Ch. 8) apparently maintains that\n\u201cnature has made all things specifically for the sake of\nman\u201d. Such purposive or teleological thinking may encourage the\nbelief that the value of non-human things in nature is merely\ninstrumental. It is difficult for anthropocentric positions to\narticulate what is wrong with the cruel treatment of non-human\nanimals, except to the extent that such treatment may lead to bad\nconsequences for human beings. Immanuel Kant (\u201cDuties to Animals\nand Spirits\u201d, in Lectures on Ethics), for instance,\nsuggests that cruelty towards a dog might encourage a person to\ndevelop a character which would be desensitized to cruelty towards\nhumans. From this standpoint, cruelty towards non-human animals would\nbe instrumentally, rather than intrinsically, wrong. Likewise,\nanthropocentrism often recognizes some non-intrinsic wrongness of\nanthropogenic (i.e. human-caused) environmental devastation. Such\ndestruction might damage the well-being of human beings now and in the\nfuture, since our very existence and well-being is essentially\ndependent on a sustainable environment. This argument was made in the\nprevious century (see Passmore 1974; Bookchin 1990; Norton et\nal. (eds.) 1995), and seems subsequently to have garnered wide\npublic support (see the results of surveys in Pew 2018).\n\nWhen environmental ethics emerged as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy in the early 1970s, it did so by posing a challenge to\ntraditional anthropocentrism. In the first place, it questioned the\nassumed moral superiority of human beings to members of other species\non earth. In the second place, it investigated the possibility of\nrational arguments for assigning intrinsic value to the natural\nenvironment and its non-human contents. It should be noted, however,\nthat some theorists working in the field see no need to develop new,\nnon-anthropocentric theories. Instead, they advocate what may be\ncalled enlightened anthropocentrism (or, perhaps more\nappropriately called, prudential anthropocentrism). Briefly,\nthis is the view that all the moral duties we have towards the\nenvironment are derived from our direct duties to its human\ninhabitants. The practical purpose of environmental ethics, they\nmaintain, is to provide moral grounds for social policies aimed at\nprotecting the earth\u2019s environment and remedying environmental\ndegradation. Enlightened anthropocentrism, they argue, is sufficient\nfor that practical purpose, and perhaps even more effective in\ndelivering pragmatic outcomes, in terms of policy-making, than\nnon-anthropocentric theories given the theoretical burden on the\nlatter to provide sound arguments for its more radical view that the\nnon-human environment has intrinsic value (cf. Norton 1991, de Shalit\n1994, Light and Katz 1996). Furthermore, some prudential\nanthropocentrists may hold what might be called cynical\nanthropocentrism, which says that we have a higher-level\nanthropocentric reason to be non-anthropocentric in our day-to-day\nthinking. Suppose that a day-to-day non-anthropocentrist tends to act\nmore benignly towards the non-human environment on which human\nwell-being depends. This would provide reason for encouraging\nnon-anthropocentric thinking, even to those who find the idea of\nnon-anthropocentric intrinsic value hard to swallow. In order for such\na strategy to be effective one may need to hide one\u2019s cynical\nanthropocentrism from others and even from oneself. The position can\nbe structurally compared to some indirect form of\n consequentialism\n and may attract parallel critiques (see\n Henry Sidgwick\n on utilitarianism and esoteric morality, and\n Bernard Williams\n on indirect utilitarianism).\n",
