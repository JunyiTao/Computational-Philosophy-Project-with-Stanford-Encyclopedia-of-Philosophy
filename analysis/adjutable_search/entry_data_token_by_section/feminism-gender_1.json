    "main_text": "The sex/gender distinction. || Biological determinism\n1.1 Biological determinism\n\nMost people ordinarily seem to think that sex and gender are\ncoextensive: women are human females, men are human males. Many\nfeminists have historically disagreed and have endorsed the sex/\ngender distinction. Provisionally: \u2018sex\u2019 denotes human\nfemales and males depending on biological features\n(chromosomes, sex organs, hormones and other physical features);\n\u2018gender\u2019 denotes women and men depending on\nsocial factors (social role, position, behaviour or\nidentity). The main feminist motivation for making this distinction\nwas to counter biological determinism or the view that biology is\ndestiny.\n\nA typical example of a biological determinist view is that of Geddes\nand Thompson who, in 1889, argued that social, psychological and\nbehavioural traits were caused by metabolic state. Women supposedly\nconserve energy (being \u2018anabolic\u2019) and this makes them\npassive, conservative, sluggish, stable and uninterested in politics.\nMen expend their surplus energy (being \u2018katabolic\u2019) and\nthis makes them eager, energetic, passionate, variable and, thereby,\ninterested in political and social matters. These biological\n\u2018facts\u2019 about metabolic states were used not only to\nexplain behavioural differences between women and men but also to\njustify what our social and political arrangements ought to be. More\nspecifically, they were used to argue for withholding from women\npolitical rights accorded to men because (according to Geddes and\nThompson) \u201cwhat was decided among the prehistoric Protozoa\ncannot be annulled by Act of Parliament\u201d (quoted from Moi 1999,\n18). It would be inappropriate to grant women political rights, as\nthey are simply not suited to have those rights; it would also be\nfutile since women (due to their biology) would simply not be\ninterested in exercising their political rights. To counter this kind\nof biological determinism, feminists have argued that behavioural and\npsychological differences have social, rather than biological, causes.\nFor instance, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that one is not\nborn, but rather becomes a woman, and that \u201csocial\ndiscrimination produces in women moral and intellectual effects so\nprofound that they appear to be caused by nature\u201d (Beauvoir 1972\n[original 1949], 18; for more, see the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir).\n Commonly observed behavioural traits associated with women and men,\nthen, are not caused by anatomy or chromosomes. Rather, they are\nculturally learned or acquired.\n\nAlthough biological determinism of the kind endorsed by Geddes and\nThompson is nowadays uncommon, the idea that behavioural and\npsychological differences between women and men have biological causes\nhas not disappeared. In the 1970s, sex differences were used to argue\nthat women should not become airline pilots since they will be\nhormonally unstable once a month and, therefore, unable to perform\ntheir duties as well as men (Rogers 1999, 11). More recently,\ndifferences in male and female brains have been said to explain\nbehavioural differences; in particular, the anatomy of corpus\ncallosum, a bundle of nerves that connects the right and left cerebral\nhemispheres, is thought to be responsible for various psychological\nand behavioural differences. For instance, in 1992, a Time\nmagazine article surveyed then prominent biological explanations of\ndifferences between women and men claiming that women\u2019s thicker\ncorpus callosums could explain what \u2018women\u2019s\nintuition\u2019 is based on and impair women\u2019s ability to\nperform some specialised visual-spatial skills, like reading maps\n(Gorman 1992). Anne Fausto-Sterling has questioned the idea that\ndifferences in corpus callosums cause behavioural and psychological\ndifferences. First, the corpus callosum is a highly variable piece of\nanatomy; as a result, generalisations about its size, shape and\nthickness that hold for women and men in general should be viewed with\ncaution. Second, differences in adult human corpus callosums are not\nfound in infants; this may suggest that physical brain differences\nactually develop as responses to differential treatment. Third, given\nthat visual-spatial skills (like map reading) can be improved by\npractice, even if women and men\u2019s corpus callosums differ, this\ndoes not make the resulting behavioural differences immutable.\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000b, chapter 5).\n",
