    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Perfectionist Elements\n2.3 Perfectionist Elements\n\nWe can begin to see the possibility and the appeal of reading Mill as\na kind of perfectionist about happiness, who claims that human\nhappiness consists in the proper exercise of those capacities\nessential to our nature. For instance, Mill suggests this sort of\nperfectionist perspective on happiness when early in On\nLiberty he describes the utilitarian foundation of his defense of\nindividual liberties.\n\n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing\nindependent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense,\ngrounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\n(OL I 11)\n\n\nMill apparently believes that the sense of dignity of a (properly\nself-conscious) progressive being would give rise to a categorical\npreference for activities that exercise his or her higher capacities.\nIn claiming that \u201cit is better to be a human being dissatisfied\nthan a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool\nsatisfied\u201d (U II 6), Mill recognizes capacities for\nself-examination and practical deliberation as among our higher\ncapacities.\n\nThis concern with self-examination and practical deliberation is, of\ncourse, a central theme in On Liberty. There he articulates\nthe interest that progressive beings have in reflective\ndecision-making.\n\n\nHe who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of\nlife for him has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of\nimitation. He who chooses his plan for himself employs all his\nfaculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to\nforesee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to\ndecide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold his\ndeliberate decision. And these qualities he requires and exercises\nexactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines\naccording to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is\npossible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of\nharm\u2019s way, without any of these things. But what will be his\ncomparative worth as a human being? (OL III 4)\n\n\nEven if we agree that these deliberative capacities are unique to\nhumans or that humans possess them to a higher degree than other\ncreatures, we might wonder in what way their possession marks us as\nprogressive beings or their exercise is important to human\nhappiness.\n\nIn his discussion of responsibility in A System of Logic\n(SL VI.ii.1\u20134) Mill suggests that he thinks that humans\nare responsible agents and that this is what marks us as progressive\nbeings. There he claims that capacities for practical deliberation are\nnecessary for responsibility. In particular, he claims that moral\nresponsibility involves a kind of self-mastery or self-governance in\nwhich one can can deliberate about the appropriateness of one\u2019s\ndesires and regulate one\u2019s actions according to these\ndeliberations (SL VI.ii.3). If this is right, then Mill can\nclaim that possession and use of our deliberative capacities mark us\nas progressive beings, because they are what mark as moral agents who\nare responsible. If our happiness should reflect the sort of beings we\nare, Mill can argue that higher activities that exercise these\ndeliberative capacities form the principal or most important\ningredient in human happiness.\n",
