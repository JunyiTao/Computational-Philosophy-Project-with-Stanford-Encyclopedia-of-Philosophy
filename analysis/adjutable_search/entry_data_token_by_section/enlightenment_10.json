    "main_text": "The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment || French Classicism and German Rationalism\n3.1 French Classicism and German Rationalism\n\nIn the early Enlightenment, especially in France, the emphasis is upon\nthe discernment of an objective rational order, rather than upon the\nsubject\u2019s sensual aesthetic pleasure. Though Descartes\u2019\nphilosophical system does not include a theory of taste or of beauty,\nhis mathematical model of the physical universe inspires the\naesthetics of French classicism. French classicism begins from the\nclassical maxim that the beautiful is the true. Nicolas Boileau writes\nin his influential didactic poem, The Art of Poetry (1674),\nin which he lays down rules for good versification within different\ngenres, that \u201cNothing is beautiful but the true, the true alone\nis lovable.\u201d In the period the true is conceived of as an\nobjective rational order. According to the classical conception of art\nthat dominates in the period, art imitates nature, though not\nnature as given in disordered experience, but the ideal\nnature, the ideal in which we can discern and enjoy \u201cunity in\nmultiplicity.\u201d In French classicism, aesthetics is very much\nunder the influence of, and indeed modeled on, systematic, rigorous\ntheoretical science of nature. Just as in Descartes\u2019 model of\nscience, where knowledge of all particulars depends on prior knowledge\nof the principle from which the particulars are deduced, so also in\nthe aesthetics of French classicism, the demand is for systematization\nunder a single, universal principle. The subjection of artistic\nphenomena to universal rules and principles is expressed, for example,\nin the title of Charles Batteaux\u2019s main work, The Fine Arts\nReduced to a Single Principle (1746), as well as in\nBoileau\u2019s rules for good versification.\n\nIn Germany in the eighteenth century, Christian Wolff\u2019s\nsystematic rationalist metaphysics forms the basis for much of the\nreflection on aesthetics, though sometimes as a set of doctrines to be\nargued against. Wolff affirms the classical dictum that beauty is\ntruth; beauty is truth perceived through the feeling of pleasure.\nWolff understands beauty to consist in the perfection in things, which\nhe understands in turn to consist in a harmony or order of a manifold.\nWe judge something beautiful through a feeling of pleasure when we\nsense in it this harmony or perfection. Beauty is, for Wolff, the\nsensitive cognition of perfection. Thus, for Wolff, beauty corresponds\nto objective features of the world, but judgments of beauty are\nrelative to us also, insofar as they are based on the human faculty of\nsensibility.\n",
