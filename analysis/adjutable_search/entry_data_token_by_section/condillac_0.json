    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nCondillac was born on September 30, 1714 in Grenoble as the third son\nof Gabriel Bonnot, Vicomte de Mably, and Catherine de La Coste.\n(\u201cCondillac\u201d was the name of an estate purchased by his\nfather in 1720.) He is said to have had very poor eyesight and a weak\nphysical constitution, factors that so retarded his intellectual\ndevelopment that as late as his twelfth year he was still unable to\nread. His education began only in his teens, first under the direction\nof a local priest, then at Lyons, where he went to live with his older\nbrother, Jean, after the death of their father. Perhaps because of his\nreticence and his late learning his family regarded him as possessing\nlimited intellectual abilities. He nonetheless managed to continue his\neducation as a seminarian in Paris, at Saint-Suplice and at the\nSorbonne. He took holy orders in 1740 and wore a cassock for the rest\nof his life, but did no pastoral work. After some years spent living\nthe life of a man of letters in Paris, during which he came to be\nclosely acquainted with Rousseau and Diderot, and published work that\nwon him election to the Prussian Academy of the Sciences (1749), he\naccepted a position as tutor to the Prince of Parma, a post that he\nheld from 1758\u201368. He returned to Paris in 1768 and was elected\nto the French Academy in that year, but he left the city shortly\nafter, in 1773, and took up residence on a country estate he had\npurchased near Beaugency. He died there on August 3, 1780. \n\nCondillac published two main philosophical works: the Essay on the\nOrigin of Human Knowledge of 1746, and the Treatise on\nSensations of 1754, both of which were devoted to expositing his\nviews on the role of experience in the development of our cognitive\ncapacities.\n\nThe earlier Essay was a less radical work. Though it sought\nto explain how the cognitive faculties are developed as a consequence\nof sensation, it took sensation itself largely for granted. Condillac\nexplicitly rejected the views that the mind can make judgments that it\nis not aware of, and that we can confuse the products of inferential\noperations with immediately given sensations. As a consequence, he\nmaintained, in opposition to Molyneux, Locke, and Berkeley, that we do\nnot need to learn to perceive visual depth. However, the\nEssay was also more wide-ranging than the Treatise.\nIt devoted attention to the development of language and its role both\nin the acquisition of our more sophisticated cognitive powers and in\nthe generation of false philosophies. These are topics that Condillac\nlater relegated to his works on logic.\n\nIn the Treatise Condillac focused just on our pre-linguistic\ncognitive abilities, which he came to think he might have\nunderestimated when he wrote the Essay. He retracted his\nearlier claim that perception is a transparent process and accepted\nboth that it involves unconscious inference from what is given in\nsensation and that sensation itself may contain more than it is at\nfirst perceived to contain. He also retracted his earlier claim that\ndepth is immediately perceived by vision. To support these revised\nopinions, he proposed a famous thought experiment. He asked his\nreaders to consider an originally inanimate and insentient human being\n(Condillac spoke of a being that is just a \u201cstatue\u201d of a\nhuman being) and to consider what this being could come to know were\nit to acquire each of the senses in isolation from the others, or each\nin combination with just one or two others. In proposing this question\nCondillac was asking a more radical version of the question Molyneux\nhad posed to Locke: would a person born blind and made to see perceive\nspatial features well enough upon first sight to be able to identify\ncubes and spheres without touching them? Condillac was asking what a\nperson endowed with just a sense of smell would think upon acquiring\nthe power of hearing, or what a person endowed with vision would know\nif unaffected by hunger, incapable of motion, and unaware of any\ntactile sensation. His answer to these questions sought not just to\nexplain how this person would acquire ideas of space and of external\nobjects, but to prove that nothing more would be needed for it to\nacquire all the knowledge and all of the abilities that we have other\nthan just to experience a sufficiently rich array of sensations.\n\nCondillac\u2019s other philosophical works support and embellish the\ndoctrines of the Essay and the Treatise. They are\nthe Treatise on Systems of 1749, which is devoted to\ncritiquing the metaphysics and the methodology of earlier\nphilosophers, the Treatise on Animals of 1755, which attempts\nto explain how human souls differ from those of animals with respect\nto intelligence and free will, the \u201cDissertation on\nLiberty\u201d, an important short work appended to the Treatise\non Sensations that further addresses the issue of human free\nwill, the \u201cSummary [extrait raisonn\u00e9] of the\nTreatise on Sensations,\u201d originally included in the\nTreatise on Animals, and a textbook on Logic (1780). He also\npublished a work on commerce and government, assembled a dictionary of\nsynonyms, and put together a multi-volume course of studies that he\nhad developed while tutoring the Prince of Parma. The latter dealt\nprincipally with history but also included some philosophical\nmaterial, including a different presentation of logic. At the time of\nhis death he left an incomplete a work entitled The Language of\nCalculation.\n",
