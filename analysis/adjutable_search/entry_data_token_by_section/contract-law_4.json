    "main_text": "General Theories of the Law of Contracts || The normativity of the contract relation\n1.4 The normativity of the contract relation\n\nTort law concerns obligations among strangers. But contract law\nconcerns obligations among parties who have a special relationship to\neach other, including the relationship constructed by the contract\nitself. Raz (1977: 228) writing about promises, has suggested that\nbare reasons for keeping promises \u201ccan only be justified if the\ncreation of [the] special relationships between people [that even bare\npromises involve] is held to be valuable.\u201d However, Raz declines\n\u201cto argue that the special relationships the desirability of\nwhich would validate [bare promissory obligations] are indeed\ndesirable.\u201d\n\n\nSome contract theorists embrace Raz\u2019s formal observation and\nseek to ground contract law in one or another substantive conception\nof the value of the special relationships that exist among contracting\nparties.\n\nOne version of this approach emphasizes that contracts generally (some\ntheorists claim always) arise inside already existing commercial and\neven social relationships. The \u201ctheory of relational\ncontracting\u201d seeks the basis for enforcing contractual promises\nin the norms that govern the background relationships. Legal\nsociologists working in this vein have emphasized that contracting,\nespecially in commercial contexts, relies on the parties\u2019\nantecedent commitments to integrity or \u201ccommon honesty and\ndecency\u201d (Macaulay 1963). Others emphasize social norms\ninvolving reciprocity and respect, especially within close-knit\ncontracting communities (Bernstein 1992). Still others approach\ncontract law through a theory of exchange relations according to which\nevery contract is \u201cnecessarily partially\u201d embedded in a\nthick context of extra-legal relations, from which it draws its legal\nauthority and force (Macneil 1980).\n\nAnother set of theories emphasizes the formal structure of the legal\nrelation of contract itself, even apart from any commercial or social\nrelationships within which it arises (Markovits 2004; Bensen 2019).\nThe doctrines governing offer and acceptance require contractual\npromisors to form (and to communicate) intentions that refer to their\npromisees. The parties to contracts, that is, intend to pursue ends\nthat do not merely coincide but rather, to borrow a formulation from\nDavid Hume, \u201chave a reference to\u201d each other (A\nTreatise of Human Nature, L.A. III, 2, ii.). Moreover, each\npromisor intends not simply to do things but to be bound to do things,\nentrenching her deference to the promisee, intending to perform unless\nreleased. Her obligation endures at his option, so that she gives him\npower over her normative situation. Contracts, that is, establish the\ntransaction as a normative unit.\n\nA contractual promisor\u2019s intentions, moreover, run not just to\nher own interest in the joint contractual project, or even to her\npromisee\u2019s interest in this project (as she understands it), but\nrather to his perspective on the project, as this is the perspective\nfrom which he will decide whether to insist on her performance or to\nrelease her. In this way, the promisor recognizes her promisee as an\nauthority over her, with respect to the promised contractual\nperformance. She treats as a final end not just the joint activities\ndescribed by her contracts but also his person\u2014his will (which\nmay insist on or relieve the duty to perform). Borrowing from Kant,\none might even say that a contract constitutes \u201can act of the\nunited choice of two persons\u201d (The Metaphysics of\nMorals 6:271) so that offers and acceptances are\n\u201crepresented not as following upon one another but \u2026 as\nproceeding from a single common will\u201d (6:273). Every\ncontract, on this view, establishes a shared perspective over the\ncontemplated performance.\n\nContractual obligations, according to such theories, are grounded in\nthe value of a shared perspective. On one version, this value lies in\nthe recognition immanent in the perspective, as promisors and\npromisees each treat the other as an independent person, imbued with\nthe special normative status that asserting contractual authority\ninvolves. This approach treats the duty of good faith in performance,\nwhich the common law makes mandatory in every contract (UCC:\n\u00a71-304; R2: \u00a7205), as contract law\u2019s core doctrine,\nbecause it requires parties to show fidelity to the shared perspective\nof the contract relation when they administer their contracts\n(Markovits 2014). On another version, the value of the contract\nrelation lies in the transfer of rights, completed at the moment of\ncontract formation. This approach treats the consideration doctrine,\nwhich other theories regard as poorly justified and marginal to\ncontract law, as contract\u2019s central, organizing principle.\nConsideration ensures that every contract is indeed constituted as a\ntransaction involving an exchange of rights (Benson 2019).\n\nAccounts of contract that emphasize the normativity of the contract\nrelation face a shared challenge, although it expresses itself\ndifferently for different versions of the view. The challenge is to\nexplain why the motives parties adopt in the shadow of legal\nenforcement do not undermine the value of the special relationship,\nwhose desirability grounds contractual obligation on the relational\nmodel. Theorists who embed the contract relation inside pre-existing\nsocial and moral relationships must explain why the self-interested\nmotives associated with contractual compliance\u2014\u201cgreed and\nfear\u201d as G. A. Cohen (2009: 40\u201344) puts it\u2014do not\n\u201ccrowd out\u201d the desirable attitudes and motives out of\nwhich the enveloping pre-legal relationships are built. This concern\nhas been much discussed\u2014both the empirical reality of crowding\nout (see, e.g., Deci, Koestner, & Ryan 1999; Gneezy and Rustichini\n2000) and its normative significance for valued social relationships\n(Atiq 2014). Theorists who understand contract as a free-standing\nrelation can avoid this challenge and might even embrace the crowding\nout of socially thicker motives as a feature of the contract relation\nrather than a bug (Markovits 2011). But the general problem remains in\nplace of explaining how an arm\u2019s-length relation among\nself-interested parties might establish a morally desirable form of\nsolidarity. This challenge becomes especially pressing in light of the\nfact that most contracts have organizations as a party (Leib 2015).\nOrganizations lack the properties of natural persons out of which the\nrelational theories build their accounts of the normativity of the\ncontract relation. Whereas contracts among organizations are the\nnatural domain for economic theories (see\n \u00a71.3),\n they are difficult for relational theories to compass.\n",
