    "main_text": "Metaphysics: A Primer on Substance || Activity\n4.3 Activity\n\n\nThe second part of Leibniz's critique of the Cartesian\ndoctrine of corporeal substance relates to the notion of activity.\nAccording to Leibniz, substances are not only essentially unities, but\nalso active. As he says in the opening line of the Principles of\nNature and Grace: \u201cA Substance is a being capable\nof action\u201d (G VI 598/AG 207). But Cartesian corporeal substance,\ninsofar as its essence is extension, cannot be itself a source of\nactivity. (G IV 510/AG 161) There are at least two strands to\nLeibniz's argument on this point. First, Leibniz holds that this\nis so because he adheres to the classical and Scholastic idea that\nactions pertain to supposita; that is, only something that can\nbe the subject of predication can be active, and only true unities can\nbe genuine subjects of predication (and not mere phenomena). Put\ndifferently, Cartesian extended stuff cannot, insofar as it is\ninfinitely divisible, constitute a suppositum, or subject of\npredication. But, second, Leibniz believes that something is active if\nand only if the source of its activity can arise within\nitself, that is, if and only if its activity arises spontaneously from\nwithin itself. This is another reason, then, that individual substances\nwill be understood as mind-like, for Leibniz believes that only minds\nor mind-like things can originate and alter their modifications.\n\n\nIn saying that substances are essentially active, Leibniz means that\nthey are endowed with forces. More precisely, according to\nLeibniz, \u201cthe very substance of things consists in a force for\nacting and being acted upon,\u201d (G IV 508/AG 159) that is, each\nsimple substance is endowed with what Leibniz calls primitive active\nand passive powers. The idea here again sounds Aristotelian: a\nsubstance has a certain essentially active component, the soul or\nsubstantial form or first entelechy, and a passive component, primary\nmatter. In Leibniz's mature account, the primitive active force\nis \u201can inherent law, impressed by divine decree,\u201d that is,\nit is the law of unfolding or the law of the series of the simple\nsubstance. As he puts it in a letter to De Volder, \u201cI think that\nit is obvious that primitive forces can be nothing but the internal\nstrivings [tendentia] of simple substances, strivings by means\nof which they pass from perception to perception in accordance with a\ncertain law of their nature, and at the same time harmonize with one\nanother, representing the same phenomena of the universe in different\nways, something that must necessarily arise from a common cause\u201d\n(G II 275/AG 181). Since simple substances are minds, their\nmodifications are representations or perceptions, and the activity of\nthe simple substance will relate to the change or succession of its\nperceptions. One way to think of this is that each substance has a\nunique series of perceptions programmed by God to play in harmony with\nall other substances, and the internal tendency of a substance to move\nfrom perception to perception is its active force, or what Leibniz also\ncalls appetite or appetition.\n",
