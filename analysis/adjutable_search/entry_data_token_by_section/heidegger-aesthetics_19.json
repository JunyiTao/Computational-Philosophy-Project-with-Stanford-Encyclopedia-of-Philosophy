Conclusion: Resolving the Controversy Surrounding Heidegger\u2019s Interpretation of Van Gogh\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s subtle but ambitious effort to show phenomenologically how\naesthetics can transcend itself from within in an encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting has not been well understood, and Heidegger\u2019s attempt,\nas part of that effort, to link Van Gogh\u2019s painting with the deep\nspiritual wisdom of rural life proved highly controversial (to say the\nleast).  Unfortunately, this controversy has subsequently distracted\nreaders from understanding what Heidegger was really trying to do. By\nworking through this controversy here, however, we can finally resolve\nit, draw its important lessons, and so put it behind us.\n\n\nAs we have seen, Heidegger assumes that the shoes Van Gogh painted\nbelong to a farming woman. The standard but unfortunate\ntranslation of die B\u00e4uerin\u2014literally \u201cthe\nfemale farmer\u201d\u2014as \u201cthe peasant woman\u201d is not\njust classist but misleading. That the shoes disclose the world\nof a farmer is important for Heidegger precisely because the\nfarmer\u2019s world is deeply attuned to the struggle with the earth;\nthe farming woman works the earth daily, caring for, struggling with,\nand ultimately depending on the earth to nurture and bring forth\nher\n harvest.[87]\nHeidegger suggests that no one is more\nimmediately attuned to the struggle between earth and world than the\nexperienced farmer, long intimate with \u201cthe uncomplaining fear as\nto the certainty of bread\u201d as well as \u201cthe wordless joy of\nhaving once more withstood want\u201d (PLT 34/GA5 19). Of\ncourse, farmers forced to abandon their farms in the dust bowl might\nfind Heidegger\u2019s vision of the earth as that which, from out\n\u201cof the calm of great riches, ripens and dispenses what is\ninexhaustible\u201d (IM 164/GA40 118) to be a romantic\nexaggeration. Nevertheless, during the great depression era of\nthe 1930s, \u201cthe earth\u201d really was Heidegger\u2019s chosen\nname for that \u201cinexhaustible\u201d dimension of intelligibility\nexperienced not only by farmers while farming but also by poets while\npoetizing, painters while painting, thinkers while thinking, and,\nindeed, by all those who create by patiently and carefully seeking to\nbring something long nurtured and concealed in a protective darkness\ninto the light of day. That such metaphors also suggest pregnancy\nmight help explain why Heidegger imagines the farmer as a woman,\ndespite the fact that the shoes in Van Gogh\u2019s painting appear\nrather masculine to our contemporary aesthetic sensibilities. Or\nHeidegger might simply have assumed that the shoes belonged to a female\nfarmer because the exhibition in which he originally saw\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting of \u201cA pair of shoes\u201d\nwas\nprobably populated with some of Van Gogh\u2019s many paintings from\n1885 of women\n engaged in farm work\n(women\n digging in the fields,\n planting,\n harvesting\nand\n peeling potatoes,\nand so on).\n\n\nIn fact, however, we have no way of knowing exactly which paintings\nHeidegger saw at the 1930 exhibit of Van Gogh\u2019s works in\nAmsterdam he later recalled having\n visited.[88]\nThe debate surrounding\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting can be\ntraced back to the fact that initially it is not even clear which\npainting Heidegger is referring to when he invokes an allegedly\n\u201cwell known painting by Van Gogh, who painted such shoes several\ntimes.\u201d  (Here are links to three of them, dated\n Spring 1887, \n early 1887,\n and June 1886.)\n  If Heidegger was aware that Van Gogh painted no fewer than five works \ntitled \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d \nbetween 1886 and 1888, plus several other pairs of wooden farmer\u2019s\n clogs,\n leather clogs,\nand paintings of\n more than one pair of shoes, \n then he does not seem to have thought\nthis fact significant. The art historian who was closest to\nHeidegger, Heinrich Petzet, proposes that the \u201cvarious versions\n[of Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018A Pair of Shoes\u2019] each show the same\nthing,\u201d and this might well be what Heidegger himself thought (if\nhe ever even thought about it): Each of these paintings manifests\nthe struggle between earth and\n world.[89]\nYet, there are lots of other\ndifferences between these paintings; anyone who studies them will\nquickly see that they are not even all paintings of the same pair of\nshoes. Given the subsequent fame of Heidegger\u2019s essay, it\nis quite understandable that both art historians and phenomenologists\nwould want to determine precisely which painting Heidegger was\nreferring to in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d so as to be\nable to evaluate his interpretation for ourselves. When the\neminent art historian Meyer Schapiro took up the task of identifying the\npainting in the 1960s, however, the mystery over which shoes Heidegger\nwas actually referring to exploded into a whole new controversy.\n\n\nSchapiro wrote to Heidegger to find out where and when he had\nactually seen Van Gogh\u2019s painting; Heidegger, then nearing\neighty, recalled having seen an exhibition in Amsterdam in 1930, so\nSchapiro cross-referenced all the works that could possibly have been\nexhibited there with Heidegger\u2019s own descriptions of the painting\nin his essay. In the end, Schapiro concluded not just that\nHeidegger had melded several paintings together in his memory but that,\nin so doing, Heidegger had mistaken as the shoes of a female farmer\nshoes that in fact belonged to Van Gogh\n himself.[90]\nThe significance of\nSchapiro\u2019s famous criticism has been hotly debated ever\nsince. Art historians have typically taken Schapiro\u2019s claim\nthat Heidegger mistakenly attributed Van Gogh\u2019s own shoes to a\nfarming woman as a devastating objection that pulls the rug right out\nfrom under Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of the painting, whereas\nphilosophers sympathetic to Heidegger often conclude that\nSchapiro\u2019s objection simply misses Heidegger\u2019s\n point.[91]\n(These\nphilosophers thus treat Heidegger\u2019s apparent error of attribution\nas if it were of no more philosophical importance than the remarkably\nsimilar fact that the work Heidegger attributed to Don Scotus in his\nHabilitation thesis was shown subsequently to have been written instead\nby Thomas of\n Erfurt.)[92]\n\n\nTo wit, Dreyfus dismisses the question of who the shoes originally\nbelonged to as \u201cirrelevant to how the picture works\u201d (2005,\np. 409). Although Dreyfus is ultimately right, his dismissal is\nmuch too quick to convince the many who disagree. For,\nSchapiro\u2019s criticism does indeed constitute a devastating\nobjection to Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh, if that\ninterpretation is understood in the standard way. According to\nwhat most readers take to be the sequence of phenomenological steps in\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh, Heidegger begins (1) with\nthe assumption that the shoes belong to a farmer, an assumption which\nthen allows him (2) to invoke that struggle with the earth with which\nthe farmer\u2019s world is so closely attuned, so that he can finally\n(3) postulate this earth/world tension as the ontological truth of\nart. On this reconstruction of his argument, however, if\nHeidegger is wrong that the shoes belonged to a farmer then the\nphenomenological bridge he is trying to build between a particular\n(\u201contic\u201d) work of art and the ontological truth of art in\ngeneral would collapse before it even gets off the ground, severed at\nits very first step.\n\n\nIndeed, Heidegger\u2019s entire interpretation of Van Gogh as the\npainter of the ontological truth of painting implodes if its first step\nis merely an idiosyncratic and arbitrary projection on\nHeidegger\u2019s part\u2014or something worse. And this is\nprecisely what Schapiro alleges. As Schapiro delivers his\nverdict:\n\n\nAlas for him, the philosopher has deceived himself. He has\nretained from his encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s canvas a moving set\nof associations with peasants and the soil, which are not sustained by\nthe picture itself. They are grounded rather in his own social\noutlook with its heavy pathos of the primordial and earthy. He\nhas indeed \u201cimagined everything and projected it into the\npainting.\u201d (Schapiro 1968, p. 138)\n\n\nAs this attempt to link Heidegger\u2019s thinking of earth with\n\u201cthe soil\u201d and his \u201csocial outlook\u201d suggests,\nSchapiro\u2019s famous criticism has an obvious political\nsubtext. To put it bluntly, Schapiro is insinuating that Heidegger\nprojected his own National Socialist-tainted associations onto Van\nGogh\u2019s work, then mistook these \u201cblood and soil\u201d\nprojections for the truth of the\n painting.[93]\nEven stripped of the\npolitical subtext that motivates it, this allegation that\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting is really\nnothing more than a projection of Heidegger\u2019s own subjective\nbiases represents a potentially formidable objection to\nHeidegger\u2019s attempt to move beyond the subject/object dichotomy\nat the heart of aesthetics. For, if Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation really just covertly reinstalls his own subjective\nperspective, then this attempt to transcend aesthetic subjectivism from\nwithin looks dubious at best.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s response to this particular objection (which he\nanticipates in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d) is simply\nto turn it around. Heidegger maintains, in effect, that any\nobjection that he is merely projecting is merely a projection on the\npart of the objector. As he puts it (in the line Schapiro throws\nback at him in the quotation above):\n\n\nIt would be the worst self-deception to believe that our description\nhad first pictured [or imagined, ausgemalt] everything thus as\na subjective act and then projected it onto the painting. (PLT\n35\u20136/GA5 21)\n\n\nHere, however, we seem to reach a deadlock. To Schapiro,\nHeidegger\u2019s anticipatory denial of projection looks like an\nunconscious confession, what Freud called a denegation, that\nis, a disavowal that really confirms the truth of what it denies (the\nclassic example of which is: \u201cI have no idea what my dream\nmeant, Dr. Freud, I only know it was not about\nmy\n mother!\u201d).[94]\nTo Heidegger, Schapiro would seem to\nhave deceived himself in the \u201cworst\u201d way; by projecting\nprojection onto Heidegger\u2019s essay, Schapiro\u2019s interpretation\nwill have been led astray by its own maliciousness. Is there no\nway to avoid leaving the debate in such an unfriendly state, where the\nexplicit avowal of \u201cnot A\u201d is taken as an unconscious\nconfession of \u201cA,\u201d no one\u2019s motives remain above the\nhermeneutics of suspicion, and art interpretation threatens to collapse\ninto the relativism of competing subjective\n projections?[95]\n\n\nThe way out of this impasse is to take Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenology much more seriously, as we have done here. What we\nhave seen is that, rather than just asserting his interpretation of Van\nGogh, Heidegger provides a phenomenological argument for it,\nthat is, a series of steps meant to take his audience from an\nexperience of an \u201contic\u201d work of art to an encounter with\nthe ontological truth of art in general. Insofar as we can personally\nexperience the phenomenological sequence of steps to which Heidegger\nrefers, we ourselves can attest to the truth of his\ninterpretation. (And if we cannot experience that sequence, or we\nexperience something else instead, then we can seek to redescribe,\nrefine, or contest his interpretation for ourselves). Let us thus\nseek to finally resolve this longstanding controversy by summarizing\nand then clarifying the basic sequence of steps in Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological interpretation of\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting\n of \u201cA pair of shoes.\u201d\n\n\nWhen Heidegger discusses Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair\nof Shoes,\u201d we have seen, his analysis takes us from: (1)\nexperiencing Van Gogh\u2019s painting as an aesthetic object (a\npainting of a pair of shoes apparently on hand for our viewing); to (2)\nattending to the nothing (that is, the way the painting\u2019s\nbackground continues to suggest other possibilities which nevertheless\nresist being fully gestalted and so brought into the foreground); to\nthereby (3) encountering the essential tension between earth and world\n(the inconspicuous struggle between revealing and concealing implicit\nin \u201cwhat is there\u201d), and so finally (4) coming to\nsee for oneself what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s shoes (by\nencountering for oneself, in the artwork, the struggle to bring the\nbounty of the earth forth into the light of the world). We can\nsee this quite clearly by looking at one of the crucial passages again,\nthis time with the four steps in Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological\ntransition explicitly labeled:\n\n\n[1] A painting by Van Gogh: a pair of tough farmer\u2019s\nshoes, [2] nothing else. The picture really represents\nnothing. [3] Yet, what is there, with that you are\nimmediately alone, [4] as if on a late autumn evening, when the last\npotato fires have burned out, you yourself were heading wearily home\nfrom the field with your hoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nThese four steps, taken together, form the phenomenological bridge\nthat allows us to move from an interpretation of a particular work of\nart to the ontological truth inherent in all art (indeed, in all\ncoming-into-being). In other words, these are the four steps in\nthe phenomenological argument whereby Heidegger discovers what he calls\nthe a-l\u00eatheiac \u201cessential strife\u201d between\n\u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d\u2014that is, the tension\nof emerging and withdrawing implicit in all intelligibility\u2014in\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting\n of \u201cA pair of shoes\u201d.\n\n\nWe can unpack that third step\u2014and better understand its\nconnection to the fourth\u2014by further examining Heidegger\u2019s\ncuriously specific assertion:\n\n\nYet, what is there, with that you are immediately alone, as\nif on a late autumn evening, when the last potato fires have burned\nout, you yourself were heading wearily home from the field with your\nhoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nInitially this certainly sounds, as Schapiro alleges, like a highly\nidiosyncratic projection of Heidegger\u2019s own subjective prejudices\nonto Van Gogh\u2019s work. Of course, art historians like\nSchapiro commonly observe that in late works like \u201cA Pair of\nShoes,\u201d Van Gogh seems to devote as much care and attention to\nhis use of color and brush strokes as he does to representing the\nfairly simple subject at the center of the\n painting.[96]\nWhat is so interesting\nfor us about this, however, is that if one attends carefully to what\nemerges from \u201c[o]ut of the dark opening of the well-worn insides\nof shoes\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19)\u2014attending specifically to the\nlighter patches of color that emerge from the dark opening of the shoe\non the right\u2014one can in fact discern the head (hair bonnet and\nface in profile), torso, and arms of what could easily be a woman,\ncarrying a hoe (a small shovel), with what could even be a small\norange-brown \u201cfire\u201d smoldering behind her. \n\n\nInsofar as we too can discern this \u201clittle old woman who lived\nin the shoe\u201d (as we could call this figure Heidegger seems to\nhave seen), then we can be certain (pace\nDerrida) that Schapiro did in fact correctly identify the precise\npainting Heidegger was discussing: \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(1886). But this also means that Heidegger is not using Van\nGogh\u2019s painting as a jumping off point for his own\nfree-associations (as Schapiro assumes); instead, Heidegger is drawing\ndirectly on his own phenomenological encounter with the painting when\nhe describes \u201cwhat is there\u201d (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38) in\nthe work\u2019s inconspicuous earth/world\n struggle.[97]\nThis would also explain\nwhat Heidegger means when he says (immediately following the quotation\nSchapiro throws back at him):\n\n\nIf anything is questionable here, it is rather that we experienced\ntoo little in the vicinity of the work and that we expressed the\nexperience too crudely and too literally. (PLT 36,\nemphasis added/GA5 21)\n\n\nIf Heidegger was literally describing the figure he saw\nemerging from \u201c[o]ut of the dark opening of the well-worn\ninsides of shoes\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19) in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of\n\u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d (1886), however, then what Heidegger\noffers us is not merely the projection of his own subjective\nassociations onto a blank canvas but, instead, a meaningful gestalting\nof something from what is really there, something we too can\nphenomenologically confirm for ourselves. (It may help to examine this\ndetail from the shoe on the right-hand side of Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cA\nPair of Shoes\u201d (1886); here the figure of the farming woman\nthat, I argue, Heidegger creatively disclosed \u201c[s]taring forth\nfrom out of the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes\u201d\n(PLT 33/GA5 19) has been outlined by Mark Wrathall in order to make it\neasier for others to see.)\n\n\nDetail from the shoe on the right side of Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n\n\nThis is important, because to make something from what is really\nthere\u2014something which is neither obviously determined by what\noffers itself to us nor simply ignores what offers itself to us in\norder to impose its own subjective idea\u2014this is what all true\nartistic creation does, according to Heidegger\u2019s view (presented\nin section\n 3.7).[98]\nAs we saw, every\n\u201cauthentic\u201d hermeneutics must do this; to interpret any\ngreat work of art, \u201cyou yourself\u201d have to struggle to bring\nforth its hidden riches, just as the farmer must struggle with the\nearth to bring forth the bounty nurtured within it. To engage in\nsuch phenomenological hermeneutics, we might thus say, is to encounter\noneself as a farmer of meaning. For, such an encounter\nallows us to understand for ourselves what it is like when the earth\ncomes to inform our worlds with a genuine, partly independent meaning\nwhich we ourselves brought forth creatively and yet did not simply\nmake-up or project onto the work. When we catch ourselves in the\nact of making-sense of an artwork in this way, then we experience for\nourselves that fundamental making-sense from which, for Heidegger, all\ngenuine meaning ultimately derives.\n\n\nHere, then, we reach the important fourth and final step in\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation, which still needs to\nbe explicitly unpacked and explained. As we saw in sections\n3.5\u20136, Heidegger claims that by experiencing the implicitly dynamic\ntension between earth and world in Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we can\nthereby come to encounter the same primordial level of practical\nmeaning that is unknowingly known by the farmer who uses her shoes\n\u201cwithout noticing or reflecting\u201d on them (PLT 34/GA5\n19). From what has been said, we should now be able to understand\njust how that is supposed to be possible. In our phenomenological\nencounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we catch ourselves in the act\nof struggling to impose a stable world of meanings upon an inherently\ndynamic intelligible domain that both informs and resists this\nworld. To thus find ourselves \u201cworlding the earth\u201d in\nour encounter with art, we have just seen, is to experience for\nourselves essentially the same struggle as the farmer who must struggle\nwith the earth in order to bring forth and maintain her world. In\nour encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we thus learn for\nourselves what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s shoes (where\nearth and world meet, both literally and figuratively), because we too\nhave experienced the way the earth both informs and exceeds the world\nof meanings we take from it, enduring the same struggle to world the\nearth (albeit on a smaller scale) in our own hermeneutic and\nphenomenological engagement with Van Gogh\u2019s painting (and\nHeidegger\u2019s\n texts, which seek to \u201cpreserve,\u201d that is, creatively disclose, the inexhaustible world of meanings at work in the work, thereby helping to hold open this ontologically-pluralistic and so nascently postmodern world).[99]\n\n\nThe most important point to grasp here, then, is that Heidegger does\nnot maintain (as it is easy but nonetheless a mistake to assume) that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting allows us somehow first to directly intuit\nthe world of a farmer as she might experience it so that, by getting in\ntouch with her farming world, we can thereby come to experience the\n\u201cessential tension\u201d between earth and world with which a\nfarmer is intimately familiar. That cannot be right because it\nbegs the question, assuming the aporetic step that Heidegger realizes\nneeds to be explained (as we saw in 3.3), namely, how can we move from\nan aesthetic experience of a painting on hand like an object to an\nencounter with the \u201cequipmentality\u201d of equipment? It\nis crucial to see that Heidegger does not first assume that the shoes\nin the painting belong to a farmer, and then, by alluding to the\nfarmer\u2019s world, introduce the essential struggle between earth\nand world as the truth of the painting. If that were the sequence of\nsteps in Heidegger\u2019s argument, then not only would he be\nknowingly begging his own question but, worse, Schapiro\u2019s telling\ncriticism that the shoes in Van Gogh\u2019s painting could not in fact\nhave been used by a farmer would constitute a completely devastating\nobjection to Heidegger\u2019s interpretation. For, Schapiro\nis certainly right that the shoes in the painting could not have been\nused by a woman while farming, for the simple reason that the\nDutch farmers Van Gogh painted wore wooden clogs in the damp potato\nfields, not leather shoes like those worn by farmers in Southern\nGermany, which would have quickly rotted from the damp soil in\nthe\n Netherlands.[100]\nThus, if Heidegger had sought simply\nto move from what he assumed were a pair of farmer\u2019s\nshoes to an intimation of the earth/world struggle familiar to farmers,\nand then from there to the essence of art, Schapiro\u2019s objection\nwould destroy the bridge Heidegger was seeking to build from an ontic\nwork of art to the ontological truth of art in general.\n\n\nThis longstanding controversy can finally be resolved, however, once\nwe realize that Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation of\nVan Gogh actually follows a different sequence of steps. As we\nhave seen, Heidegger moves from: (1) experiencing an objective\npainting of unused shoes (in the standard aesthetic way); to (2)\nnoticing and attending to the dynamic \u201cnothing\u201d in the\nbackground of the painting and thereby (3) encountering the earth/world\nstruggle implicit in the work; to finally (4) intimating, from this\nearth/world struggle, what a farmer\u2019s inconspicuous use of shoes\nas equipment is like. The trick Schapiro misses (along with most\nother readers of Heidegger\u2019s famous essay) is that attending to\nthe \u201cnothing\u201d that makes itself visible in the background\nof Van Gogh\u2019s painting allows us to encounter the essential\ntension between world and earth for ourselves, and it is this\nencounter\u2014with the tension between that which comes forth into\nthe light (\u201cworld\u201d) and that which nurtures this coming\nforth and yet also shelters itself in the darkness\n(\u201cearth\u201d)\u2014that allows us to understand, as though\nfrom the inside, what it is like to walk in the shoes of a\nfarmer.\n\n\nIn the end, then, Schapiro\u2019s objection that the shoes belonged not to\na farmer but to Van Gogh himself does indeed miss Heidegger\u2019s\nphilosophical point. Once we understand the actual sequence of steps\nin Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological argument, we can see that Schapiro\u2019s\ncriticism really only temporarily complicates the inference from step\n3 to step 4 (that is, the move from encountering the conflict between\nearth and world to understanding what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s\nshoes).  This is an inference, however, that Heidegger could have\nreached just as easily by discussing the world of Van Gogh himself\n(whom Schapiro takes to be rightful owner of the shoes in the\npainting). In Heidegger\u2019s view of him, Van Gogh clearly understood the\nearth/world struggle at least as lucidly as the farmers he painted (so\nHeidegger could just as easily have moved from encountering the\nearth/world struggle to understanding what it is like to walk in the\nshoes of a painter like Van Gogh). Indeed, Heidegger\u2019s final point\n(the point conveyed by his references to \u201cyou\u201d and\n\u201cyou yourself\u201d) is that Van Gogh and these farmers lived\nthe same struggle in different ways, and so do all of us meaning\nfarmers, that is, all of us who genuinely create by discerning\ninchoate contours and struggling to give shape to something that\npreviously was only partly glimpsed at best and so remained hidden\nin darkness.  Art thus teaches us not to try to banish the darkness\nthat surrounds the light of intelligibility, but to learn to see into\nthat ubiquitous \u201cnoth-ing\u201d so as to discern therein the\nenigmatic \u201cearth\u201d which nurtures all the genuine meanings\nthat have yet to see the light of day. Insofar as we can learn from\nVan Gogh (or other similarly great artists) to see in this poetic way\nourselves, Heidegger suggests, we will find ourselves dwelling in a\npostmodern world permeated by genuinely meaningful possibilities.\n",
