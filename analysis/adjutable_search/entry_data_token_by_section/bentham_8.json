    "main_text": "Later Improvements || Greatest Happiness Principle\n4.2 Greatest Happiness Principle\n\nBentham detected a serious and potentially debilitating defect in\nrendering the utility principle as the \u201cgreatest happiness of\nthe greatest number\u201d. He came to see that such a principle could\njustify inordinate sacrifices by a minority, however that minority\nmight be composed, in the interest of enhancing the happiness of a\nmajority. He considered this a false conclusion, but one that needed\nto be addressed. \u201cBe the community in question what it\nmay\u201d, he writes, \u201cdivide it into two unequal parts, call\none of them the majority, the other the minority, lay out of the\naccount the feelings of the minority, include in the account no\nfeelings but those of the majority, the result you will find is that\nto the aggregate stock of the happiness of the community, loss, not\nprofit, is the result of the operation\u201d. The less the numerical\ndifference between the minority and majority, the more obvious the\ndeficiency in aggregate happiness will be (1983a, 309). Logically,\nthen, the closer we approximate the happiness of all the\nmembers of the community, the greater the aggregate of happiness.\n",
