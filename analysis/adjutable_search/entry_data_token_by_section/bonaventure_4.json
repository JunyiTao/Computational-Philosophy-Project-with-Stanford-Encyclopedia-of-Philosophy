    "main_text": "Physical Creation || Creation\n3.2 Creation\n\nThe tension between the newly translated Aristotelian corpus and the\ntraditional theological teaching of the Church regarding the doctrine\nof creation was well understood by Bonaventure\u2019s time. Indeed,\nthe prohibitions of 1215 and 1231 regarding the teaching of the\nAristotelian writings on natural philosophy had given way to the\ndirect teaching of Aristotle in the Faculty of Arts by the time\nBonaventure took his master of arts degree at the University of Paris,\nand by the time he left the University, the Aristotelian corpus in its\nentirety was a subject of examination for candidates for degrees in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Yet the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of\nthe world was given various interpretations. Some favored a benign\ninterpretation, claiming that all Aristotle meant in Physics\nVIII was that the world and its motion did not arise from some earlier\nmotion, but rather time, moveable things, and motion were all coeval\nand\n concomitant.[14]\n Others, however, chief among them Robert Grosseteste, argued that the\nviews of Aristotle should be taken at face value and what the\nStagirite intended was the eternity of the past; the Greek Fathers and\nAristotle\u2019s own commentators both were in accord that the\nAristotelian outlook involved the beginninglessness of the past and\nunoriginated\n matter.[15]\n\nBonaventure\u2019s own position takes its origins from a combination\nof elements coming from Alexander of Hales and Grosseteste. Following\nthe lead of the latter, Bonaventure rejects, albeit with some\nhesitation, the benign reading of the Stagirite; in all likelihood,\nAristotle did intend to teach that the world was beginningless:\n\n\nAnd this view [i.e., that matter eternally existed under some form]\nseems more reasonable than its opposite, namely, that matter existed\neternally incomplete, bereft of form and divine influence, as some of\nthe philosophers posited. Indeed, this view seems so reasonable that\nthe most excellent of the philosophers, Aristotle, fell into this\nerror, at least as the saints impute it to him, his commentators\nexpound him, and his own words indicate. (In II Sent., lib.\nII, d. 1, pars 1, art. 1, qu. 2, resp. [Quaracchi II: 22b], trans.\n authors[16])\n\n\nYet the most striking feature of Bonaventure\u2019s account of the\nphilosophers is the manner in which he juxtaposes the doctrine of\ncreation, as he understands it, with the philosophical theory of\norigins. According to Bonaventure, only two theories regarding the\norigin of the cosmos are really tenable: first, the theory of the\npagan philosophers according to which the world is eternal and the\nmatter of the universe is without ultimate causal origin; second, the\nChristian doctrine of creation according to which the universe depends\nentirely for its being on God, is produced \u201cfrom nothing (ex\nnihilo)\u201d, and is temporally finite in the past. The third\npossibility, namely that the world is both produced from nothing and\neternal, Bonaventure vehemently rejects on the grounds that such a\nposition is inherently contradictory:\n\n\nResponse: To posit that the world is eternal or eternally produced,\nwhile positing likewise that all things have been produced from\nnothing, is altogether opposed to the truth and reason, just as the\nlast reason stated showed. Indeed, it is so opposed to reason that I\ndo not believe any philosopher, however small his intellectual\nabilities, took this position. For this involves, in itself, an\nobvious contradiction. To posit, however, that the world is eternal on\nthe supposition that matter is eternal seems reasonable and\nunderstandable\u2026. (In II Sent., d. 1, pars 1, art. 1,\nqu. 2 [Quaracchi II: 22a\u2013b], trans.\n authors[17])\n\n\nReturning to the last argument, we find the reasoning to which\nBonaventure refers. The argument is an elegant synthesis and\nrestatement of the position of Parisian theologians since the time of\nWilliam of Auxerre, but is especially indebted to the\nQuaestiones of Alexander of Hales. Everything that depends\nentirely for its being on something else is produced by that thing\nfrom nothing. The world depends entirely for its being on God. Hence,\nthe world must be produced from nothing. If the world is produced from\nnothing, it must either arise out of the \u201cnothing\u201d as out\nof matter or out of the \u201cnothing\u201d as out of a point of\norigin. The world cannot arise out of nothing as out of matter. Thus\nthe world must arise out of nothing as out of a point of origin. If,\nhowever, the world arises out of nothing as out of a point of origin,\nthen the world has being after non-being. Nothing having being after\nnon-being can be eternal. The world, as a created thing, has being\nafter non-being. Therefore, the world, precisely as created \u201cout\nof nothing\u201d, cannot be eternal (In II Sent., d. 1, pars\n1, art. 1, qu. 2 [Quaracchi II:\n 22a][18]).\n The philosophical force of the expression that there be a logical\nmoment at which we could say that the world is not and with reference\nto which the world begins to be. The ontological reference of such a\nlogical moment is the divine eternity with respect to which\n(\u201cafter\u201d which) the world begins.\n\nTo Bonaventure\u2019s mind, the creationist view of the universe\nalone accounts for the total being of the universe in the sense of\nexplaining both its structure and the fact that it exists; the view of\nthe ancients only explains the order and the pattern of the universe\nwithout reaching the depths of accounting for why the universe exists\nat all. A sign of this shortcoming is to be seen in the shared\npresupposition of Plato and Aristotle that matter is unoriginated.\nFurthermore, to the extent that the ancient pagan views of the\nuniverse involve the infinity of past time, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that the eternity of past time entails, natural reason\nwould seem capable of arriving, in principle, at the conclusion that\nthe world was created, even though, historically speaking, the\ngreatest of the ancient philosophers failed to do so.\n",
