    "main_text": "Intellect and Will\n10. Intellect and Will\n\n\nIn his production Henry dedicates no less than 20 quodlibetal\nquestions to an analysis of will and intellect, considered both in\ngeneral and with particular reference to the human sphere (Macken 1975\nand 1977). In Quodl. I, q. 14, the eminence of the will over\nthe intellect is defended, taking into account the habitus,\nact and object of the two faculties. As in Pauline doctrine, the\nhabitus of the will, which is love (caritas), is\npreferable to the habitus of the intellect, which is\nknowledge. Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\nGod. The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\n\u201cprimacy of essence\u201d should be attributed to\nvoluntas, whereas \u201cprimacy of action\u201d should be\nattributed to ratio.\n\n\nWhile it is true that the will is the superior faculty, in order to\nact it always needs the intervention of reason. This is justified on\nthe basis of the human cognitive process itself: in man, as in other\nanimals, the first form of knowledge is received through the senses.\nNevertheless, sensible appetites alone cannot activate the will, which\nonly moves toward the universaliter and simpliciter\nGood, and not toward a particular good, such as that perceived by the\nsenses. So the intervention of the intellect, which is able to abstract\nthe universal from sensible particulars and thereby permits the motion\nof the will, is always needed. In this way, the intellect precedes the\nwill. So, in order to avoid the inconvenience of having the motion of\nthe will depend on sensible appetites (determinism of the passions),\nHenry always recognizes the importance of the role of reason.\n\n\nNevertheless, unlike the theory upheld by those intellectualists\ncloser to the Aristotelian tradition in this case, the intellect itself\nis only a condition, and not the absolute cause, of the motion of the\nwill. For Henry the will is characterized by the capacity for\nself-motion. After being alluded to in q. 22, Quodl. IV, this\ntheory becomes central to q. 5, Quodl. IX of the Lent Session,\n1285: \u201cUtrum voluntas moveat seipsam\u201d (\u201cWhether the\nwill moves itself\u201d). The date is here important, since this\nQuodlibet was disputed after the famous propositio\nmagistralis of 1285, i.e. the proposition conceded by the Parisian\nMasters of Theology on the occasion of Giles of Rome's\nrehabilitation: \u201csi ratio recta, et voluntas recta\u201d\n(\u201cif reason is right, then the will is also right\u201d). In\nthis question the superiority of the will is vindicated by Henry, since\nnot only does it move all the other faculties, and hence the intellect\ntoo, but it also, indeed above all, moves itself, at a level of\nperfection which is second only to that of God. To the objection based\non the well-known Aristotelian principle according to which \u201call\nthat moves, is moved by something else,\u201d Henry replies that while\nthis principle is valid for the material faculties, it cannot be\napplied in the same way to the spiritual faculties, since the latter\npossess a higher degree of perfection.\n\n\nIt is the level of perfection that determines the strength and\ncapacity of that which actualizes something else. Therefore, as the\nlevels of perfection increase, from matter (which, as pure potency,\nmoves nothing) to God (pure act), the distinction between mover and\nmoved diminishes. The will is immediately below the highest level of\nperfection, represented by God, since it admits a purely\n\u201cintentional\u201d distinction (see above \u00a74) between\nmover and moved. And since it is self-moving, it is also free. Thus, in\nvirtue of its nature, the will is induced to seek the good proposed by\nthe intellect, though it remains free in this quest even with regard to\nthe supreme Good.\n\n\nIn Quodlibet X of the Advent Session, 1286, Henry returns\nto the problem of the self-motion of the will, introducing the notion\nof virtus ad movendum, through which the spiritual faculties\n(such as human voluntas) can produce and specify their own\nacts without an external mover. More especially, through this\nvirtus ad movendum, which corresponds to the substantial form\nof the subject, the will is able to pass from the potency of desiring\nto the act of desiring, since it already \u201cvirtually\u201d\ncontains this act within itself. Henry thus surprisingly concludes that\neven the above-mentioned propositio magistralis (\u201csi\nratio recta, et voluntas recta\u201d) does not undermine the\nsuperiority of the will. The proposition should be interpreted in the\nsense of simultaneity, and not causality, since the second faculty\n(ratio) does not necessarily determine the first\n(voluntas), but is only the conditio sine qua non of\nits operation. Finally, Henry concedes that the will cannot desire what\nit does not know, but denies that the will is determined in its choices\nby the intellect; in other words, that it cannot desire the opposite of\nwhat the intellect dictates.\n\n\nHenry can thus undoubtedly be considered a voluntarist (M\u00fcller\n2007), even though with regard to the more \u201cradical\u201d\nvoluntarists, such as Walter of Brugge, he does not confine himself to\ninterpreting the role of reason as that of a mere\n\u201cadvisor\u201d, but instead as that of a cause (albeit a\ncausa sine qua non): without the prior knowledge of the\nintellect (characterized by the same kind of freedom as\nvoluntas), the will cannot desire anything. In other words,\nfor Henry the intellect and the good that it proposes are not the sole\nor necessary origin of the motion of the will, as is affirmed, on the\nother hand, by those interpreters closer to Aristotle. Nevertheless, by\npresenting the objects that this faculty can freely choose, reason is\nthe conditio sine qua non of the action of the will itself,\nwhich otherwise would be prey to sensible appetites and the determinism\nof the passions. Moral action is therefore performed both by the\nintellect, which presents the kinds of good to choose, and by the will,\nwhich freely chooses one of these, yet without being forced to opt for\nthat which is judged best by reason (Teske 2011; Leone 2014).\n",
