Views Opposing the Existence Dimension (II): Error-Theory and Morality\n\nAccording to Field\u2019s error-theory of arithmetic, the objects\ndistinctive of arithmetic do not exist, and it is this which leads to\nthe rejection of the existence dimension of arithmetical realism, at\nleast as platonistically conceived (for a non-platonistic view of\narithmetic which is at least potentially realist, see Benacerraf 1965;\nfor incisive discussion, see Wright 1983, Ch.3). J. L. Mackie, on the\nother hand, proposes an error-theoretic account of morals, not because\nthere are no objects or entities that could form the subject matter of\nethics (it is no part of Mackie\u2019s brief to deny the existence of\npersons and their actions and so on), but because it is implausible to\nsuppose that the sorts of properties that moral properties would have\nto be are ever instantiated in the world (Mackie 1977, Ch.1). Like\nField on arithmetic, then, Mackie\u2019s central claim about the\natomic, declarative sentences of ethics (such as \u2018Napoleon was\nevil\u2019) is that they are systematically and uniformly false. How\nmight one argue for such a radical-sounding thesis? The clearest way\nto view Mackie\u2019s argument for the error-theory is as a\nconjunction of a conceptual claim with an ontological claim (following\nSmith 1994, pp. 63\u201366). The conceptual claim is that moral facts\nare objective and categorically prescriptive facts, or, equivalently,\nthat our concept of a moral property is a concept of an objective and\ncategorically prescriptive quality (what Mackie means by this is\nexplained below). The ontological claim is simply that there are no\nobjective and categorically prescriptive facts, that objective and\ncategorically prescriptive properties are nowhere instantiated. The\nconclusion is that there is nothing in the world answering to our\nmoral concepts, no facts or properties which render the judgements\nformed via those moral concepts true. Our moral (atomic) moral\njudgements are systematically false. We can thus construe the argument\nfor the error-theory as follows:\n\n\nConceptual Claim: Moral facts are objective and\ncategorically prescriptive facts.\nIf there are moral facts, then there are objective and\ncategorically prescriptive facts (Definitional consequence of the\nConceptual Claim)\n\nIf there are true, atomic, declarative moral sentences, then there\nare objective and categorically prescriptive facts.\n\nOntological Claim: there are no objectively and\ncategorically prescriptive facts.\n\nSo,\n\nThere are no moral facts.\n\nSo,\n\nConclusion: There are no true, atomic, declarative\nmoral sentences.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument clearly follows from its premises, so\nthe question facing those who wish to defend at least the existence\ndimension of realism in the case of morals is whether the premises are\ntrue. (Note that strictly speaking what the argument purports to\nestablish is that there are no moral facts as-we-conceive-of-them.\nThus, it may be possible to block the argument by advocating a\nrevisionary approach to our moral concepts; or by deploying a\nRamsey-Carnap-Lewis conception of theoretical terms and arguing that\nthere are moral facts, just ones that do not answer to our concept but\nwhich (coming closer than other candidates) would best deserve the\n\u201cmoral fact\u201d label (see Smith 1994), section 2.10 for a\ngood explanation of the application of the Ramsey-Lewis-Carnap\nconception in the moral case).\n\nMackie\u2019s conceptual claim in effect amounts to the claim that\nour concept of a moral requirement is the concept of an objectively,\ncategorically prescriptive requirement. What does this mean? To say\nthat moral requirements are prescriptive is to say that they tell us\nhow we ought to act, to say that they give us reasons for acting.\nThus, to say that something is morally good is to say that we ought to\npursue it, that we have reason to pursue it. To say that something is\nmorally bad is to say that we ought not to pursue it, that we have\nreason not to pursue it. To say that moral requirements are\ncategorically prescriptive is to say that these reasons are\ncategorical in the sense of Kant\u2019s categorical imperatives. The\nreasons for action that moral requirements furnish are not contingent\nupon the possession of any desires or wants on the part of the agent\nto whom they are addressed: I cannot release myself from the\nrequirement imposed by the claim that torturing the innocent is wrong\nby citing some desire or inclination that I have. This contrasts, for\nexample, with the requirement imposed by the claim that perpetual\nlateness at work is likely to result in one losing one\u2019s job: I\ncan release myself from the requirement imposed by this claim by\nciting my desire to lose my job (perhaps because I find it\nunfulfilling, or whatever). Reasons for action which are contingent in\nthis way on desires and inclinations are furnished by what Kant called\nhypothetical imperatives.\n\nSo our concept of a moral requirement is a concept of a categorically\nprescriptive requirement. But Mackie claims further that our concept\nof a moral requirement is a concept of an objective and categorically\nprescriptive requirement. What does it mean to say that a requirement\nis objective? Mackie says a lot of different-sounding things about\nthis, and the following (as outlined in Miller 2013a) is by no means a\ncomprehensive list (references are to Ch. 1 of Mackie 1977). To call a\nrequirement objective is to say that it can be an object of knowledge\n(24, 31, 33), that it can be true or false (26, 33), that it can be\nperceived (31, 33), that it can be recognised (42), that it is prior\nto and independent of our preferences and choices (30, 43), that it is\na source of authority external to our preferences and choices (32, 34,\n43), that it is part of the fabric of the world (12), that it backs up\nand validates some of our preferences and choices (22), that it is\ncapable of being simply true (30) or valid as a matter of general\nlogic (30), that it is not constituted by our choosing or deciding to\nthink in a certain way (30), that it is extra-mental (23), that it is\nsomething of which we can be aware (38), that it is something that can\nbe introspected (39), that it is something that can figure as a\npremise in an explanatory hypothesis or inference (39), and so on.\nMackie plainly does not take these to be individually necessary: facts\nabout subatomic particles, for example, may qualify as objective in\nvirtue of figuring in explanatory hypotheses even though they cannot\nbe objects of perceptual acquaintance. But his intention is plain\nenough: these are the sorts of conditions whose satisfaction by a fact\nrenders it objective as opposed to subjective. Mackie\u2019s\nconceptual claim about morality is thus that our concept of a moral\nrequirement is a concept of a fact which is objective in at least some\nof the senses just listed, while his ontological claim will be that\nthe world does not contain any facts which are both candidates for\nbeing moral facts and yet which play even some of the roles\ndistinctive of objective facts.\n\nHow plausible is Mackie\u2019s conceptual claim? This issue cannot be\ndiscussed in detail here, except to note that while it seems plausible\nto claim that if our concept of a moral fact is a concept of\na reason for action then that concept must be a concept of a\ncategorical reason for action, it is not so clear why we have to say\nthat our concept of a moral fact is a concept of a reason for action\nat all. If we deny this, we can concede the conditional claim whilst\nresisting Mackie\u2019s conceptual claim. One way to do this would be\nto question the assumption, implicit in the exposition of\nMackie\u2019s argument for the conceptual claim above, that an\n\u2018ought\u2019-statement that binds an agent A provides that\nagent with a reason for action. For an example of a version of moral\nrealism that attempts to block Mackie\u2019s conceptual claim in this\nway, see Railton (1986). For defence of Mackie\u2019s conceptual\nclaim, see Smith (1994), Ch.3 and Joyce (2001). For exposition and\ncritical discussion, see Miller (2013a), Ch.9.\n\nWhat is Mackie\u2019s argument for his ontological claim? This is set\nout in his \u2018argument from queerness\u2019 (Mackie has another\nargument, the \u2018argument from relativity\u2019 (or\n\u2018argument from disagreement\u2019) (1977: 36\u201338), but\nthis argument cannot be discussed here for reasons of space. For a\nuseful discussion, see Brink (1984)).The argument from queerness has\nboth metaphysical and epistemological components. The metaphysical\nproblem with objective values concerns \u2018the metaphysical\npeculiarity of the supposed objective values, in that they would have\nto be intrinsically action-guiding and motivating\u2019 (49). The\nepistemological problem concerns \u2018the difficulty of accounting\nfor our knowledge of value entities or features and of their links\nwith the features on which they would be consequential\u2019 (49).\nLet\u2019s look at each type of worry more closely in turn.\n\nExpounding the metaphysical part of the argument from queerness,\nMackie writes: \u201cIf there were objective values, then they would\nbe entities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different\nfrom anything else in the universe.\u201d (38) What is so strange\nabout them? Mackie says that Plato\u2019s Forms (and for that matter,\nMoore\u2019s non-natural qualities) give us a \u2018dramatic\npicture\u2019 of what objective values would be, if there were\nany:\n\nThe Form of the Good is such that knowledge of it provides the knower\nwith both a direction and an overriding motive; something\u2019s\nbeing good both tells the person who knows this to pursue it and makes\nhim pursue it. An objective good would be sought by anyone who was\nacquainted with it, not because of any contingent fact that this\nperson, or every person, is so constituted that he desires this end,\nbut just because the end has to-be-pursuedness somehow built into it.\nSimilarly, if there were objective principles of right and wrong, any\nwrong (possible) course of action would have not-to-be-doneness\nsomehow built into it. Or we should have something like Clarke\u2019s\nnecessary relations of fitness between situations and actions, so that\na situation would have a demand for such-and-such an action somehow\nbuilt into it (40).\n\n\nThe obtaining of a moral state of affairs would be the obtaining of a\nsituation \u2018with a demand for such and such an action somehow\nbuilt into it\u2019; the states of affairs which we find in the world\ndo not have such demands built into them, they are \u2018normatively\ninert\u2019, as it were. Thus, the world contains no moral states of\naffairs, situations which consist in the instantiation of a moral\nquality.\n\nMackie now backs up this metaphysical argument with an epistemological\nargument:\n\nIf we were aware [of objective values], it would have to be by some\nspecial faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different\nfrom our ways of knowing everything else. These points were recognised\nby Moore when he spoke of non-natural qualities, and by the\nintuitionists in their talk about a faculty of moral intuition.\nIntuitionism has long been out of favour, and it is indeed easy to\npoint out its implausibilities. What is not so often stressed, but is\nmore important, is that the central thesis of intuitionism is one to\nwhich any objectivist view of values is in the end committed:\nintuitionism merely makes unpalatably plain what other forms of\nobjectivism wrap up (38).\n\n\nIn short, our ordinary conceptions of how we might come into cognitive\ncontact with states of affairs, and thereby acquire knowledge of them,\ncannot cope with the idea that the states of affairs are objective\nvalues. So we are forced to expand that ordinary conception to include\nforms of moral perception and intuition. But these are completely\nunexplanatory: they are really just placeholders for our capacity to\nform correct moral judgements (the reader should here hear an echo of\nthe complaints Benacerraf and Field raise against arithmetical\nplatonism).\n\nEvaluating the argument from queerness is well outwith the scope of\nthe present entry. While Railton\u2019s version of moral realism\nattempts to block Mackie\u2019s overall argument by conceding his\nontological claim whilst rejecting his conceptual claim, other\nversions of moral realism agree with Mackie\u2019s conceptual claim\nbut reject his ontological claim. Examples of the latter version, and\nattempts to provide the owed response to the argument from queerness,\ncan be found in Smith (1994), Ch.6, and McDowell (1998), Chs\n4\u201310.\u201cCompanions in Guilt\u201d style responses attempt\nto undermine Mackie\u2019s argument by suggesting that if it were\nsound, it would undermine much more than moral realism. For an example\nof such a strategy, see Cuneo (2007). For a general discussion, see\nLillehammer (2010). \n\nThere are two main ways in which one might respond to Mackie\u2019s\nargument for the error-theory: directly, via contesting one of its\npremises or inferences, or indirectly, pointing to some internal\ntension within the error-theory itself. Some possible direct responses\nhave already been mentioned, responses which reject either the\nconceptual or ontological claims that feature as premises in\nMackie\u2019s argument for the error-theory. An indirect argument\nagainst the error-theory has been developed in recent writings by\nCrispin Wright (this argument is intended to apply also to\nField\u2019s error-theory of arithmetic).\n\nMackie claims that the error-theory of moral judgement is a\nsecond-order theory, which does not necessarily have implications for\nthe first order practice of making moral judgements (1977: 16).\nWright\u2019s argument against the error-theory begins by suggesting\notherwise:\n\nThe great discomfort with [Mackie\u2019s] view is that, unless more\nis said, it simply relegates moral discourse to bad faith. Whatever we\nmay once have thought, as soon as philosophy has taught us that the\nworld is unsuited to confer truth on any of our claims about what is\nright, or wrong, or obligatory, etc., the reasonable response ought\nsurely to be to forgo the right to making any such claims \u2026. If\nit is of the essence of moral judgement to aim at the truth, and if\nphilosophy teaches us that there is no moral truth to hit, how are we\nsupposed to take ourselves seriously in thinking the way we do about\nany issue which we regard as of major moral importance? (1996: 2; see\nalso 1992: 9).\n\n\nWright realises that the error-theorist is likely to have a story to\ntell about the point of moral discourse, about \u201csome norm of\nappraisal besides truth, at which its statements can be seen as aimed,\nand which they can satisfy.\u201d (1996: 2) And Mackie has such a\nstory: the point of moral discourse is\u2014to simplify\u2014to\nsecure the benefits of social co-operation (1973: chapter 5 passim;\nnote that this is the analogue in Mackie\u2019s theory of\nField\u2019s notion of the conservativeness of mathematical\ntheories). Suppose we can extract from this story some subsidiary norm\ndistinct from truth, which governs the practice of forming moral\njudgements. Then, for example, \u2018Honesty is good\u2019 and\n\u2018Dishonesty is good\u2019, although both false, will not be on\na par in point of their contribution to the satisfaction of the\nsubsidiary norm: if accepted widely enough, the former will presumably\nfacilitate the satisfaction of the subsidiary norm, while the latter,\nif accepted widely enough, will frustrate it. Wright questions whether\nMackie\u2019s moral sceptic can plausibly combine such a story about\nthe benefits of the practice of moral judgement with the central\nnegative claim of the error-theory:\n\n[I]f, among the welter of falsehoods which we enunciate in moral\ndiscourse, there is a good distinction to be drawn between those which\nare acceptable in the light of some such subsidiary norm and those\nwhich are not\u2014a distinction which actually informs ordinary\ndiscussion and criticism of moral claims\u2014then why insist on\nconstruing truth for moral discourse in terms which motivate\na charge of global error, rather than explicate it in terms of the\nsatisfaction of the putative subsidiary norm, whatever it is? The\nquestion may have a good answer. The error-theorist may be able to\nargue that the superstition that he finds in ordinary moral thought\ngoes too deep to permit of any construction of moral truth\nwhich avoids it to be acceptable as an account of moral truth. But I\ndo not know of promising argument in that direction (1996: 3; see also\n1992: 10).\n\n\nWright thus argues that even if we concede to the error-theorist that\nhis original scepticism about moral truth is well-founded, the\nerror-theorist\u2019s own positive proposal will be inherently\nunstable. In recent years, inspired by error-theory, philosophers have\ndeveloped forms of moral fictionalism, according to which moral claims\neither are or ought to be \u201cuseful fictions\u201d. See Kalderon\n2005 and Joyce 2001 for examples. For a book-length treatment of moral\nerror-theory, see Olson 2014.\n\nThe error-theories proposed by Mackie and Field are non-eliminativist\nerror-theories, and should be contrasted with the kind of\neliminativist error-theory proposed by e.g. Paul Churchland concerning\nfolk-psychological propositional attitudes (see Churchland 1981).\nChurchland argues that our everyday talk of propositional attitudes\nsuch as beliefs, desires and intentions should eventually be abandoned\ngiven developments in neuroscience. Mackie and Field make no analogous\nclaims concerning morality and arithmetic: no claim, that is, to the\neffect that they will one day be in principle replaceable by\nphilosophically hygienic counterparts. For some discussion of the\ncontrast between eliminativist and non-eliminativist error theories,\nsee Miller (2015). \n",
