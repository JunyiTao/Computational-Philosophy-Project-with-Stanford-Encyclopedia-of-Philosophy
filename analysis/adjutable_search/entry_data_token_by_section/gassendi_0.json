    "main_text": "Historical Background and Gassendi's Life\n1. Historical Background and Gassendi's Life\n\n\nBorn in 1592 to a family of commoners in the tranquil Haute-Provence\ntown of Champtercier, Pierre Gassendi rose to become the greatest\nProven\u00e7al scholar of his day, a member of the preeminent French\nintellectual group of his times\u2014the Mersenne circle\u2014and\nprofessor of mathematics at the College Royal. At an early age, his\ninstructors recognized great potential, and dispatched him at age\nsixteen to Aix-en-Provence for studies of further sophistication than\nhis local schooling could provide. In these first years of scholarly\npursuit, Gassendi shuttled between Aix and Digne (the provincial\ncapital) and so began a life-long pattern of itinerant travel. His\nextensive and early education vaulted him to professorship at Aix\nwhile still in his mid-twenties. He shuttled between careers as well,\nattaining success and station not only in academic circles but also in\nthe Catholic Church.\n\n\nGassendi's career as a priest is a crucial facet of his intellectual\nconstitution: his writings reflect an unbending allegiance to Holy\nScripture and Church teachings, though not necessarily in orthodox\ndoctrinal lights. He was ordained at the age of 24 or 25 and, while\nthere is no question of the strength of his faith, one motivation for\nhis career in the Church appears to be its provision of a sinecure.\nThus Gassendi started at the rank of a low-level local official\n(Chanoine of the Cathedral) in Digne and rose to the rank of a\nslightly higher-level local official (Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t), still in\nDigne, some twenty years later. Though he clearly pursued a studied\nrelationship with his higher authority, all the while he wrote letters\nof support to the Church-embattled Galileo, sought appointment to the\nsecular College Royal, and cultivated deep personal and intellectual\nties with his non-Church patrons\u2014the affluent\nfonctionnaire, Francois Luillier; the Proven\u00e7al\nsavant, Nicole-Pierre Fabri de Peiresc; the local count of Alais,\nLouis Emmanuel de Valois; and the Parisian noble, Habert de\nMontmor.\n\n\nAfter some years of instructing pupils in philosophy and theology,\nGassendi distanced himself from what he believed to be rigid teachings\nof the Scholastics in his Exercitationes Paradoxicae of 1624.\nThereafter he began a formative partnership in physiological,\nastronomical, and historical studies with the wise and wealthy\nPeiresc, summarized in Gassendi's glowing biography written upon\nPeiresc's death in 1637. By this time, Gassendi had also developed his\nearly interests in a variety of questions in basic physics and in\nrestoring the philosophy of Epicurus\u2014much as Thomas had restored\nAristotle, integrating his thought with what he held to be\ntheologically viable. His published work in philosophy and natural\nphilosophy captured the attention of the Minim priest, Marin\nMersenne. Gassendi spent the last two decades of his life traveling\nback and forth between Provence and Paris because of varying\ncommitments to patrons, appointment to the College Royal, and\nill health. Throughout, he remained informed of and involved with\nscholarly discussions of the day, owing to his engagement with the\ngroup of philosophers and scientists united through correspondence\nwith Mersenne. In the Mersenne circle, debates ranged over numerous\ntopics central to the dismantling of Aristotelian and Scholastic\nworld-views, and Mersenne often used his role as facilitator to bring\ntogether opponents on these issues. In that context, Mersenne helped\nenable the entry of Gassendi's criticisms of Descartes's\nMeditations into the Objections and Replies\n(Gassendi subsequently published his rebuttals in his Disquistio\nMetaphysica of 1646) and focused Gassendi's attention on refuting\nthe mystical attacks on Kepler by Robert Fludd (Epistolica\nExercitatio, in qua principia philosophiae Roberti Fluddi medici\nreteguntur, 1630). Members of this circle regularly reported on\neach other's experiments and proposed new challenges, such as\nPoysson's well-known puzzling over whether physical indivisibles could\nor should be identified with mathematical points. Gassendi used this\nforum to learn about other empirical studies as well as to work out a\ngood many of his views.\n\n\nHis scientific career was varied and complex, if never quite\nassociated with glowing triumph. Some historians consider his greatest\naccomplishment in this sphere to be his contribution to the revival of\nancient atomism but this represents only one end of his\nanti-Aristotelian physics, and a small, albeit core element of his\nscientific interests. His other accomplishments in physics includes a\nstudy of bodies in free fall (closely modeled on Galileo's work), a\nmature enunciation of the principle of inertia, and an early and\nreasonably accurate interpretation of the Pascalian barometry\nexperiments of the late 1640s. Gassendi also ventured into\nexperimental science: he attempted to measure the speed of sound by\ncannon fire, arranged to have weights dropped from the mast of a\nmoving ship to enact Galileo's thought experiment (and so dispel\ndoubts about the motion of the Earth), and conducted numerous chemical\ntrials involving, among other things, the dissolution of salts and\nformation of crystals (which he took to bolster his molecular theory\nof matter).  These are only some of his better-known exploits. In\naddition, he offered a wide variety of speculations on the earth\nsciences based partly on geological fieldwork and biological and\nphysiological observations\u2014and as shaped by his atomist\nhypothesis. Finally, Gassendi devoted much of his time to astronomical\npursuits. He made regular observations of the skies for decades,\nproducing confirmatory evidence for Kepler's views, observing\nsunspots, the anses of Saturn, and the passage of Mercury before the\nSun (1631), and successfully predicting an eclipse in 1654. Moreover,\nhe commissioned the first map of the moon, defended the Copernican\nview as plausible save for its conflicts with Church teachings, and\noffered many disparaging words on what he considered the scurrilous\nand empirically intolerable practice of astrology.\n\n\nIn his final years, Gassendi relented to pressure from friends and\nreleased a major portion of his Epicurean studies to the public,\npublishing his Latin translation of Diogenes Laertiius's Book X on\nEpicurus, along with ample commentary, in his Animadversiones\nof 1649. He continued to work on this interpretive material, however,\nsteadily incorporating philosophical and scientific insights, until\nhis death in the Paris apartment of Montmor in 1655. Montmor, acting\nas executor, collected this material in manuscript form and with\nGassendi's other Parisian friends arranged to have it published as the\nposthumous Syntagma Philosophicum. The Syntagma is\nmore systematic than the Animadversiones, largely eschewing\nthe sometimes philological character of the earlier commentary and\nprincipally discussing logic, the natural sciences, psychology, and\nethics from the perspective of what Gassendi deems philosophically,\nhistorically, and theologically supportable. His interests in Epicurus\nare ever-present, not least in the structure of the work, which is\ndivided into a Logic (including his textbook-format Institutio\nLogica), Physics, and Ethics.  Happily, we have a rather\nwell-rounded picture of Gassendi's intellectual pursuits, on top of\nhis Epicurean projects. Montmor and company had the good sense to\nbundle the Syntagma together with the better part of\nGassendi's other writings (the Animadversiones notably\nexcepted) in six volumes of collected works, the Opera Omnia\n(Lyon, 1658; Florence, 1727), which includes as well earlier letters\non optics and the free fall of bodies, a portion of his voluminous\nastronomical observations, and a great deal of his correspondence.\n(In what follows, we cite passages in Opera Omnia by using\nthe following abbreviations for the volumes: \"O I\", \"O II\",\u2026,\n\"O VI\".)\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Gassendi's death, his general renown, influence on\nFrench schooling and popular conceptions of natural science, and\nrivalry for Descartes' legacy, all grew. This impact was enhanced by\nthe 1674-1675 publication of a condensed, abridged, reorganized, and\noccasionally paraphrased version of the Opera Omnia, written\nin French by Gassendi's acolyte, Fran\u00e7ois Bernier. Over the\nfollowing half century, the \u201cGassendistes\u201d stood as\nformidable opponents to the \u201cCart\u00e9siennes\u201d in\nFrench debates over educational and scientific matters, and Gassendi's\nthinking spread\u2014variously influencing Leibniz, Boyle, Locke, and\nNewton, among others.\n",
