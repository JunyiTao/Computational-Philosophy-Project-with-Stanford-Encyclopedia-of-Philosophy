    "main_text": "Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms || The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and the Relative A Priori\n3.2 The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and the Relative A Priori\n\nWhether the verificationist agenda was pursued in a formalist or\npragmatic vein, however, all members shared the belief that meaningful\nstatements divided exclusively into analytic and synthetic statements\nwhich, when asserted, were strictly matched with a priori and\na posteriori reasoning for their support. The Vienna Circle\nwielded this pairing of epistemic and semantic notions as a weapon not\nonly against the substantive a priori of the Schoolmen but\nalso against Kant\u2019s synthetic a priori. Moreover, their\nnotion of analyticity comprized both logical and mathematical truths,\nthereby extending Wittgenstein\u2019s understanding of the former as\n\u201ctautological\u201d in support of a broadly logicist\nprogram.\n\nIt is well known that this central component of the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s arsenal, the analytic/synthetic distinction, came under\nsharp criticism from Quine in his \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (1951a), less so that the criticism can only be\nsustained by relying on objections of a type first published by\nTarski. The argument is more complex, but here is a very rough sketch.\nSo as to discard the analytic/synthetic distinction as an unwarranted\ndogma, Quine in \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d argued for the in-principle\nrevisability of all knowledge claims and criticised the impossibility\nof defining analyticity in a non-circular fashion. The first argument\ntells against the apodictic a priori of old (the eternal\nconceptual verities), but, as we shall see, it is unclear whether it\ntells against at least some of the notions of the a priori\nheld in the Vienna Circle. The second argument presupposes a\ncommitment to extensionalism that likewise can be argued not to have\nbeen shared by all in the Circle. By contrast, Tarski had merely\nobserved that, at a still more fundamental level, he knew of no basis\nfor a sharp distinction between logical and non-logical terms. (For\nrelevant primary source materials see also Quine 1935, 1951b, 1963,\nCarnap 1950, 1955, 1963b, their correspondence and related previously\nunpublished lectures and writings in Creath 1990, the memoir Quine\n1991, and Tarski 1936.)\n\nThe central role on the Vienna Circle\u2019s side in this discussion\nfalls to Carnap and the reorientation of philosophy he sought to\neffect in Logical Syntax (1934/37). It was the notion of the\nmerely relative and therefore non-apodictic a priori that\ndeeply conditioned his notion of analyticity and allowed him to\nsidestep Quine\u2019s fallibilist argument in a most instructive\nfashion. In doing so Carnap built on an idea behind\nReichenbach\u2019s early attempt (1920) to comprehend the general\ntheory of relativity by means of the notion of a merely constitutive\na priori. Now Schlick had objected to the residual idealism\nof this proposal (see Oberdan 2009) and prefered talk of conventions\ninstead and Reichenbach soon followed him in this (see Coffa 1991, Ch.\n10). Carnap too did not speak of the relative a priori as\nsuch (in returning to this terminology present discussions follow\nFriedman 1994), but his pluralism of logico-linguistic frameworks\nfurnishes precisely that.\n\nFirst consider Schlick as a contrast class. Schlick (1934) appeared to\nshow little awareness of the language-relativity of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction and spoke of analytic truths as\nconceptual necessities that can be conclusively surveyed. This would\nsuggest that Schlick rejected Kant\u2019s apodictic synthetic a\npriori but not the apodicity of analytic statements. Clearly, if\nthat were so, Quine\u2019s argument from universal fallibilism would\nfind a target here. Matters are not quite so clear-cut, however.\nSchlick had long accepted the doctrine of semantic conventionalism\nthat the same facts could be captured by different conceptual systems\n(1915): this would suggest that his analytic truths were conventions that were\nframework-relative and as such necessary only in the very frameworks\nthey helped to constitute. Yet Schlick did not countenance\nthe possibility of incommensurable conceptual frameworks:\nany fact was potentially expressible in any framework (1936b). As a\nresult, Schlick did not accept the possibility that after the adoption\nof a new framework the analytic truths of the old one may be no longer\nassertable, that they could be discarded as no longer applicable even\nin translation, as it were. Herein lay a point that Quine\u2019s\nargument could exploit: Schlick\u2019s analytic truths remained\nunassailable despite their language-relativity.\n\nNow Carnap, under the banner of the principle of logical tolerance\n(1934/37, \u00a717), abandoned the idea of the one universal logic\nwhich had informed Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein before him.\nInstead, he recognized a plurality of logics and languages whose\nconsistency was an objective matter even though axioms and logical\nrules were fixed entirely by convention. Already due to this logical\npluralism, the framework-relativity of analytic statements went deeper\nfor Carnap than it did for Schlick. But Carnap also accepted the\npossibility of incommensurability between seemingly similar\ndescriptive terms and between entire conceptual systems (1936a).\nAccepting the analytic truths of the framework of our best physical\ntheory may thus be incompatible with accepting those of an earlier\none, even if the same logic is employed in both. Carnapian\nanalyticities do not therefore express propositions that we hold to be\ntrue unconditionally, but only propositions true relative to their own\nframework: they are no longer held to be\npotentially translatable across all frameworks. Quine\u2019s charge of\nuniversal revisability (which itself needs some modification; see\nPutnam 1978) thus misses its mark against them. (Quine, of course, also\nrejected Carnap\u2019s ultimately intensionalist accommodation of radical\nfallibilism via the notion of language change.)\n\nConcerning the criticism of the circular nature of the definition of\nanalyticity, Carnap responded that it pertained primarily to the idea\nof analyticity in natural language whereas he was interested in\n\u201cexplications\u201d as provided by the logic of science (or\nbetter, a logic of science, since there existed no unique logic of\nscience for Carnap). Explications are reconstructions in a formal\nlanguage of selected aspects of complex terms that should not be\nexpected to model the original in all respects (1950b, Ch.1).\nMoreover, Carnap held that explication of the notion of analyticity in\nformal languages yielded the kind of precision that rendered the\ncomplaint of circularity irrelevant: vague intuitions of meaning were\nno longer relied upon. Those propositions of a given language were\nanalytic that followed from its axioms and, once the syntactic\nlimitations of the Logical Syntax period had been left\nbehind, from its definitions and meaning postulates, by application of\nits rules: no ambiguity obtained.\n\nSo it may appear that the notion of analyticity is easily delimitable\nin Carnap\u2019s explicational approach: analytic propositions would\nbe those that constitute a logico-linguistic framework. But\ncomplications arose from the fact that, on Carnap\u2019s\nunderstanding, not all propositions defining a logico-linguistic\nframework need be analytic ones (1934/37, \u00a751). It was possible\nfor a framework to consist not only of L-rules, whose entirety\ndetermines the notion of logical consequence, but also of P-rules,\nwhich represent presumed physical laws. So let analytic propositions\nbe those framework propositions whose negations are\nself-contradictory. Here a problem arose once the syntactic\nconstraints were dropped by Carnap after Logical Syntax so as\nto allow semantic reasoning and the introduction of so-called meaning\npostulates: now the class of analytic propositions was widened to\ninclude not only logical and mathematical truths but also those\nobtained by substitution of semantically equivalent expressions. How\nwas one now to explicate the idea that there can be non-analytic\nframework propositions (whose negations are not self-contradictory)?\nConsider that for opponents like Quine, responding that the negations\nof non-analytic framework propositions do not contradict meaning\npostulates, was merely to dress up a presupposed notion of meaning in\npseudo-formal garb: while it provided what looked like formal\ncriteria, Carnap\u2019s method did not leave the circle of\nintensional notions behind and so seemed to beg the question. Meaning\npostulates (Carnap 1952), after all, could only be identified by\nappearing on a list headed \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d (as Quine\nadded in reprints of 1951a).\n\nHere one must note that in Logical Syntax, Carnap also\nmodified the thesis of extensionality he had previously defended\nalongside Russell and Wittgenstein: now it merely claimed the\npossibility of purely extensional languages and no longer demanded\nthat intensional languages be reduced to them (ibid.,\n\u00a767). Of course, the mere claim that the language of science can\nbe extensional still proves troublesome enough, given that in such a\nlanguage a distinction between laws and accidentally true universal\npropositions cannot be drawn (the notion of a counterfactual\nconditional, needed to distinguish the former, is an intensional one).\nEven so, this opening of Carnap\u2019s towards intensionalism already\nat the height of his syntacticism\u2014to say nothing of his explicit\nintensionalism in Meaning and Necessity (1947)\u2014seems\nenough to thwart Quine\u2019s second complaint in \u201cTwo\nDogmas\u201d. Carnap did not share Quine\u2019s extensionalist\nagenda, so the need to break out of the circle of intensional notions\nonce these were clearly defined in his formal languages did not apply.\nThat theirs were in fact different empiricist research programmes was\ninsufficiently stressed, it would appear, by Quine and Quinean critics\nof Carnap (as noted pointedly by Stein 1992; cf. Ricketts 1982, 2003, Creath 1991, 2004,\nRichardson 1997).\n\nTo sustain his critique, Quine had to revive his and Tarski\u2019s\nearly doubts about Carnap\u2019s methodological apparatus and dig\neven deeper. (Tarski also shared Quine\u2019s misgivings about\nanalyticity when they discussed these issues with Carnap at Harvard;\nsee Mancosu 2005, Frost-Arnold 2013.) Their scepticism found its\ntarget in Carnap\u2019s ingenious measures in Logical Syntax\ntaken to preserve the thesis that mathematics is analytic from the\nravages of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems. G\u00f6del\nproved that every formal system strong enough to represent number\ntheory contains a formula that is true but neither itself or its\nnegation is provable in that system; such formulae\u2014known since\nas G\u00f6del sentences\u2014are provable in a still stronger system\nwhich, however, also contains a formula of its own that is true but\nnot provable in it (and neither is its negation). Commonly,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof is taken to have undermined the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic. (For discussions of this challenge to\nCarnap\u2019s logical syntax project, see Friedman 1988, 1999a, 2009,\nGoldfarb and Ricketts 1992, Richardson 1994, Awodey and Carus 2003,\n2004.) Carnap responded by stating that arithmetic demands an infinite\nsequence of ever richer languages and by declaring analytic statements\nto be provable by non-finite reasoning (1934/37, \u00a760a-d). This\nlooked like fitting the bill on purely technical grounds, but it is\nquestionable whether such reasoning may still count as syntactic.\nNowadays, it is computational effectiveness that is taken to\ndistinguish purely formal from non-formal, material reasoning.\n(Carnap\u2019s move highlights the tension within Logical\nSyntax between formal and crypto-semantic reasoning: that the rigid\nsyntacticism officially advertised there was at the same time\nundermined as its failings were being compensated\u2014illegitimately so\nby official standards, e.g., by considering translatability a\nsyntactic notion\u2014points ahead to his acceptance of semantics in 1935, only one\nyear after the publication of Logical Syntax and contrary to\nhis disparagement of the notion of synthetic truth there. For a discussion of Carnap\u2019s moves, see Coffa\n1978, Ricketts 1996, Goldfarb 1997, Creath 1996, 1999.) It is no\ncriticism that Carnap\u2019s reconstruction of arithmetic was not\nstandard logicism, but that Carnap unduly stretched the idea of formal\nreasoning is. Was he saved by his shift to semantics?\n\nTarski (1936) granted the language-relativity of the reconstructed\nnotion of analyticity in Logical Syntax. He also did not\nobject that Carnap\u2019s procedure of circumventing the problem\nwhich the G\u00f6del sentences presented to the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic was illegitimate. Tarski rather questioned\nwhether there were \u201cobjective reasons\u201d for the sharp\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms and he pointed out\nthat Carnap\u2019s distinction between the logical and the empirical\nwas not a hard and fast one. Since noting that the distinction between\nlogical and non-logical was not a sharp one and arguing that no\nprincipled distinction could be upheld between them are two quite\ndifferent reactions, however, Tarski\u2019s point on its own does not\nfully support the Quinean critique. Quine\u2019s conclusion (1940,\n\u00a760) that the notion of logical truth itself is\n\u201cinformal\u201d rather reflects the moral that he drew from\nTarski\u2019s observation. It appears that what motivated him (after\na nominalistic interlude in the 1940s) to develop his naturalistic alternative to\nCarnap\u2019s conception of philosophy was his considered rejection\nof Carnap\u2019s accommodation of the thesis that arithmetic is\nanalytic to G\u00f6del\u2019s result.\n\nDifferent strands of Quine\u2019s criticism of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction must thus be distinguished. While Quine\u2019s criticisms\nin \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d on their own clearly did not undermine all\nforms of the distinction that were defended in the Vienna\nCircle\u2014Carnap\u2019s reconstructions of the notion of\nanalyticity did not express unconditionally necessary and unrevisable\npropositions\u2014they do gain in plausibility even against\nCarnap\u2019s once it is recognized that the deepest ground of\ncontestation lies elsewhere: not in the notion of analyticity widely\nunderstood but in that of logical truth narrowly understood. Read in\nthis way, Quine can be seen to argue that the notion of L-consequence\nas explication of analytic truth\u2014as opposed to P-consequence as\nnon-analytic, mere framework entailments\u2014traded not only on the\nidea of non-finitary notions of proof but also on a distinction of\nlogical from descriptive expressions that itself only proceeded on the\nbasis of a finite enumeration of the former (compare Carnap 1934/37,\n\u00a7\u00a751\u201352). (This deficit was not repaired in\nCarnap\u2019s later work either; see Awodey 2007.) What Quine\ncriticized was precisely the fact that Carnap could ground the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms no deeper than by\nthe enumeration of the former in a given framework: was the\ndistinction therefore not quite arbitrary? \n\nQuine\u2019s direct arguments against the distinction between logical\nand empirical truth (1963) have been found to beg the question against\nCarnap and his way of conceiving of philosophy (Creath 2003). This way\nof responding to Quine\u2019s objection requires us to specify still\nmore precisely just what Carnap thought he was doing when he employed\nthe distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. To be\nsure, in (1955) he gave broadly behavioural criteria for when meaning\nascriptions could be deemed accepted in linguistic practice, but he also noted that this was not a general requirement for the\nacceptability of explicatory discourse. To repeat, explications did\nnot seek to model natural language concepts in their tension-filled\nvividness, but to make proposals for future use and to extract and\nsystematize certain aspects for constructive purposes. Thus Carnap\nclarified (1963b, \u00a732) that he regarded the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic statements\u2014just like the distinction\nbetween descriptive or factual and prescriptive or evaluative\nstatements\u2014not as descriptive of natural language practices, but\nas a constructive tool for logico-linguistic analysis and theory\nconstruction. It is difficult to overstress the significance of this\nstance of Carnap\u2019s for the evaluation of his version of the\nphilosophical project of the Vienna Circle. Carnap\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy has thus been aptly described as the\n\u201cscience of possibilities\u201d (Mormann 2000). \n\nAs Carnap understood the analytic/synthetic distinction, it was a\ndistinction drawn by a logician to enable greater theoretical\nsystematicity in the reconstructive understanding of a given symbol\nsystem, typically a fragment of a historically developed one. That\nfully determinative objective criteria of what to regard as a logical\nand what as a non-logical term cannot be assumed to be pre-given does\nnot then in and of itself invalidate the use of that distinction by\nCarnap. On the contrary, it has been convincingly argued that Carnap\nhimself did not hold to a notion of what is a factual and what is a\nformal expression or statement that was independent of the\nspecification of the language in question (Ricketts 1994). The\nultimate ungroundedness of his basic semantic explicatory categories,\nthis suggests instead, was a fact that his own theories fully\nrecognized and consciously exploited. (Somewhat analogously, that we\ncannot define science independently of the practice of scientists of\n\u201cour culture\u201d was admitted by Neurath 1932a, Carnap 1932d\nand Hempel 1935, much to the exasperation of Zilsel 1932 and Schlick\n1935a.)\n\nIt remained open for Carnap then to declare his notion of analyticity\nto be only operationally defined for constructed languages and to let\nthat notion be judged entirely in terms of its utility for\nmeta-theoretical reflection. Just on that account, however, a last\nhurdle remains: finding a suitable criterion of significance for\ntheoretical terms that allows the distinction between analytic and\nsynthetic statements to be drawn in the non-observational, theoretical\nlanguages of science. (This was a problem ever since the\nnon-eliminative reducibility of disposition terms had been accepted\nand one that still held for Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion; see section\n3.5 below). Only if that can be done, we must therefore add, can\nCarnap claim his formalist explicationist project to emerge unscathed\nfrom the criticisms of both Tarski and Quine.\n\nAn important related though independently pursued line of criticism\nmay be noted here. It finds its origin in Saunders Mac Lane\u2019s\nreview (1937) of Carnap\u2019s Logical Syntax and focusses\nless on the analytic/synthetic distinction than on Carnap\u2019s\nfailure to give a formally correct definition of logic. It challenges\nthe ambition to have accounted for the formal sciences but declines to\nembrace a naturalistic alternative. Further research along these lines\nhas suggested to some that by extending Carnap\u2019s approach and\nframework it can be linked to attempts in category theory to provide\nthe missing definition (see Awodey 2012, 2017), while a different response to Mac Lane\u2019s as well as Quine\u2019s criticisms defends Carnap\u2019s inability, frankly admitted in (1942, 57) to define logical terms as such in full generality (Creath 2017).\n\nNone of the above considerations should lead one to deny, however,\nthat one can find understandings of the term \u201canalytic\u201d by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle (like Schlick) that do fall victim to the\ncriticisms of Quine more easily. Nor should one discount the fact that\nCarnap\u2019s logic of science emerges as wilfully ill-equipped to\ndeal with the problems that exercise the traditional metaphysics or\nepistemologies that deal in analyticities. (Of course, unlike his\ndetractors, Carnap considered this to be a merit of his approach.)\nLastly, it must be noted that Carnap\u2019s intensionalist logic of\nscience holds out the promise of practical utility only for the price\nof a pragmatic story that remains to be told. Of what nature are the\npractical considerations and decisions that, as Carnap so freely\nconceded (1950a), are called for when choosing logico-linguistic\nframeworks? (Such conventional choices do not respond to truth or\nfalsity, but instead to whatever is taken to measure convenience.)\nThat Carnap rightly may have considered such pragmatic questions\nbeyond his own specific brief as a logician of science does not\nobviate the need for an answer to the question itself. (Carus 2007\nargues that in this broadly pragmatic dimension lies the very point of\nCarnap\u2019s explicationism.) On this issue, too, it would have been\nhelpful if there had been more collaboration with Neurath and Frank,\nwho were sympathetic to Carnap\u2019s explication of analyticity but\ndid not refer to it much in their own, more practice-oriented\ninvestigations (see section 3.6 below).\n",
