    "preamble": "\n\nThe tradition of Chinese ethical thought is centrally concerned with\nquestions about how one ought to live: what goes into a worthwhile\nlife, how to weigh duties toward family versus duties toward\nstrangers, whether human nature is predisposed to be morally good or\nbad, how one ought to relate to the non-human world, the extent to\nwhich one ought to become involved in reforming the larger social and\npolitical structures of one\u2019s society, and how one ought to\nconduct oneself when in a position of influence or power. The\npersonal, social, and political are often intertwined in Chinese\napproaches to the subject. Anyone who wants to draw from the range of\nimportant traditions of thought on this subject needs to look\nseriously at the Chinese tradition. The canonical texts of that\ntradition have been memorized by schoolchildren in Asian societies for\nhundreds of years, and at the same time have served as objects of\nsophisticated and rigorous analysis by scholars and theoreticians\nrooted in widely variant traditions and approaches. This article will\nintroduce ethical issues raised by some of the most influential texts\nin Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, Legalism, and Chinese Buddhism, with\nthe most attention directed at the first four, which are indigenous to\nChina and arose during the classical period (about the middle of\nthe 6th to the end of the 3rd century BCE) of Chinese philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Characteristics of Chinese Ethics: Practical Focus and Closeness to Pre-theoretical Experience\n\nIn the Analects 13.18, the Governor of She tells Confucius of\na Straight Body who reported his father to the authorities for\nstealing a sheep. Confucius (Kongzi, best known in the West under his\nlatinized name, lived in the 6th and 5th century\nB.C.E) replies that in his village, uprightness lies in fathers and\nsons covering up for each other. In the Euthyphro, Socrates\nencounters Euthyphro (whose name can be translated as \u201cStraight\nthinker\u201d), reputed for his religious knowledge and on his way to\nbring charges against his father for murder. The conversation between\nSocrates and Euthyphro leads to a theoretical inquiry in which various\nproposed answers as to piety\u2019s ousia (essence) are\nprobed and ultimately found unsatisfactory, but in which no answer to\nthe piety or impiety of Euthyphro\u2019s action is given. The\ncontrast between these two stories highlights one of the distinctive\nfeatures of Chinese ethics in general: its respect for the practical\nproblem. The practical problem discussed by Confucius and Socrates is\narguably a universal one: the conflict between loyalty owed to a\nfamily member and duty to uphold public justice within the larger\ncommunity. Confucius\u2019s response is one dimension of a\ncharacteristically Chinese respect for the practical problem. The\nnature of the problem demands a practical response. However, another\ndimension of a reflective respect for the practical problem\nis to maintain a certain humility in the face of a really hard\nproblem. It is to be skeptical that highly abstract theories will\nprovide a response that is true to the complexities of that problem. A\ntradition exemplifying such respect will contain influential works\nthat will not pretend to have resolved recurring tensions within the\nmoral life such as those identified in the Analects and the\nEuthyphro.\n\nConfucius gives an immediate practical answer in 13.18, but the reader\nand commentators have been left to weave together the various remarks\nabout filiality (or as it is often called, \u201cfilial piety\u201d)\nso as to present a rationale for that answer. These remarks quite\noften concern rather particular matters, as is the matter of turning\nin one\u2019s father for stealing a sheep, and the implications for\nmore general issues are ambiguous. Do fathers and sons cover up for\neach other on all occasions, no matter how serious, and if there is a\ncover-up, is there also an attempt to compensate the victim of the\nwrongdoing? The particularity of these passages is tied up with the\nemphasis on praxis. What is sought and what is discussed is often the\nanswer to a particular practical problem, and the resulting\nparticularity of the remarks invites multiple interpretations. The\nsayings often are presented as emerging from conversations between\nConfucius and his students or various personages with official\npositions, or among Confucius\u2019s students. One passage (11.22)\nportrays Confucius as having tailored his advice according to the\ncharacter of the particular student: he urges one student to ask\nfather and elder brother for advice before practicing something he has\nlearnt, while he urges the other to immediately practice; the reason\nis that the first has so much energy that he needs to be kept back,\nwhile the second is retiring and needs to be urged forward. With this\npassage in mind, we might then wonder whether the apparent tension\nbetween remarks made in connection with a concept is to be understood\nin terms of the differences between the individuals addressed or other\naspects of the conversational context. \n\nAll texts that have become canonical within a tradition, of course,\nare subject to multiple interpretations, but Chinese texts invite\nthem. They invite them by articulating themes that stay relatively\nclose to the pre-theoretical experience that gives rise to the\npractical problems of moral life (see Kupperman 1999 on the role of\nexperience in Chinese philosophy). The pre-theoretical is not\nexperience that is a pure given or unconceptualized, nor is it\nnecessarily experience that is universal in its significance and\nintelligibility across different traditions of thought and culture.\nThis attention to pre-theoretical experience also leads to differences\nin format and discursive form: dialogues and stories are more suited\nfor appealing to and evoking the kind of pre-theoretical experience\nthat inspires parts of the text. By contrast, much Western philosophy\nhas gone with Plato in taking the route of increasing abstraction from\npre-theoretical experience.\n\nThe contrast is not meant to imply that Chinese philosophy fails to\ngive rise to theoretical reflection. Theoretical reflection of great\nsignificance arises in the Mozi, Mencius,\nHanfeizi, Xunzi, and Zhuangzi, but there is\nmore frequent interplay between the theorizing and references to\npre-theoretical experience. In Chinese texts there are suggestions for\ntheorizing about this experience, but the suggestions often indicate\nseveral different and fruitful directions for theorizing to go\nfurther. These directions may seem incompatible, and they may or may\nnot be so in the end, but the tensions between these directions are\nreal. The result is a fruitful ambiguity that poses a\nproblematic. Pre-theoretical experience poses a practical\nproblem. Apparently incompatible solutions to problems are partially\ntheorized in the text, but the apparent incompatibility is not\nremoved. Much of the value of these texts lies in their leaving the\ntensions in place with enough theory given to stimulate thinking\nwithin a certain broadly defined approach. There is more than enough\nfor the sophisticated theorist to try to interpret or to reconstruct a\nmore defined position as an extension of that broadly defined\napproach. At the same time, the problematic is partly framed with the\nlanguage of pre-theoretical experience in the form of dialogue and\nstory, making the texts accessible to a much broader range of readers\nthan is usually the case with philosophy texts. The following sections\npresent some of the major kinds of problematic that appear in the\nmajor schools of Chinese ethical thought.\n2. Confucian Ethics\n2.1 Virtue ethics: the dao, the junzi, and ren\n\nA common way to understand Confucian ethics is that it is a virtue\nethic. For some scholars this will be an obvious, uncontroversial\ntruth. For others, it is a misconstrual that imposes contentious\nWestern assumptions on Confucianism about what it is to be a person\nand what an ethics should be about. In light of this controversy, it\nis important to specify the sense in which it is relatively\nuncontroversial to claim that virtues constitute a major focus of\nattention in these texts. Virtues in the relevant sense are qualities\nor traits that persons could have and that are appropriate objects of\naspiration to realize. These virtues go into the conception of an\nideal of a kind of person that one aspires to be. Given this rather\nbroad sense of \u201cvirtue,\u201d it is unobjectionable to say that\nConfucian texts discuss ethics primarily in terms of virtues and\ncorresponding ideals of the person.\n\nWhat makes the characterization of Confucianism as a virtue ethic\ncontroversial are more specific, narrower senses of\n\u201cvirtue\u201d employed in Western philosophical theories.\nTiwald (2018) distinguishes between something like the broad sense of\nvirtue and a philosophical usage that confers on qualities or traits\nof character explanatory priority over right action and promoting good\nconsequences. Virtue ethics in this sense is a competitor to rule\ndeontological and consequentialist theories. There simply is not\nenough discussion in the Confucian texts, especially in the classical\nperiod, that is addressed to the kind of questions these Western\ntheories seek to answer.\n\nThere are other narrower senses of \u201cvirtue\u201d that are\nclearly mischaracterizations when applied to Confucian ethics. Virtues\nmight be supposed to be qualities that people have or can have in\nisolation from others with whom they interact or from their\ncommunities, societies, or culture. Such atomistic virtues could make\nup ideals of the person that in turn can be specified or realized in\nsocial isolation. Further, virtues might be supposed to be\nidentifiable through generalizations that hold true in every case,\nsuch that the ways these traits are concretely manifested in conduct\ndo not vary across context or situation. Prominent and influential\ncritics of the \u201cvirtue\u201d characterization of Confucian\nethics--Roger Ames (2011, 2021) and Robert Neville (2016)--seem to be\nsupposing that the term is loaded with such controversial\npresuppositions.\n\nAs will become clear in subsequent discussion here, one can employ\nvirtue language with the appropriate qualifiers and at the same time\nacknowledge much of what the critics claim as insights of Confucian\nethics: e.g., that the process of realizing the virtues\ncharacteristically takes place in relationship to others--those to\nwhom one has responsibilities as a son or daughter or mother or\nfather, for example--and that it can be part of one\u2019s very\nidentity to be a particular person\u2019s son or daughter, mother or\nfather. It is part of the Confucian vision of a life befitting human\nbeings that it is a life of relationships marked by mutual care and\nrespect, that one achieves fullest personhood that way. One achieves\nthis in a manner that is particular to one\u2019s circumstances,\nincluding the particular others with whom one most interacts. None of\nthis is inconsistent with virtue characterizations in the broad sense\n(for an alternative role-ethic characterization of Confucian ethics\nthat incorporates these insights in a different way, see Ames, 2011,\n2021).\n\nThe most frequently discussed ideal is that of the junzi. The\nChinese word originally meant \u201cprince\u2019s son,\u201d but in\nthe Analects it refers to ethical nobility. The\nfirst English translations rendered it as \u201cgentleman,\u201d but\nAmes and Rosemont (1998) have usefully suggested \u201cexemplary\nperson.\u201d Among the traits connected to ethical nobility are\nfiliality, a respect for and dedication to the performance of\ntraditional ritual forms of conduct, and the ability to judge what the\nright thing to do is in the given situation. These traits are virtues\nin the sense that they are necessary for following the dao,\nthe way human beings ought to live their lives. As Yu (2007) points\nout, the dao plays the kind of role in ancient Chinese ethics\nthat is analogous to the role played by eudaimonia or\nflourishing, in ancient Greek ethics. The junzi is the\nethical exemplar with the virtues making it possible to follow the\ndao.\n\nBesides the concepts of dao and junzi, the concept\nof ren is a unifying theme in the Analects. Before\nConfucius\u2019s time, the concept of ren referred to the\naristocracy of bloodlines, meaning something like the strong and\nhandsome appearance of an aristocrat. But in the Analects the\nconcept is of a moral excellence that anyone has the potential to\nachieve. Various translations have been given of ren. Many\ntranslations attempt to convey the idea of complete ethical virtue,\nconnoting a comprehensive state of ethical excellence. In a number of\nplaces in the Analects the ren person is treated as\nequivalent to the junzi, indicating that ren has the\nmeaning of complete or comprehensive moral excellence, lacking no\nparticular virtue but having them all. However, ren in some\nplaces in the Analects is treated as one virtue among others\nsuch as wisdom and courage. In the narrower sense of being one virtue\namong others, it is explained in 12.22 in terms of caring for others.\nIt is in light of these passages that other translators, such as D.C.\nLau, 1970a, use \u2018benevolence\u2019 to translate ren.\nHowever, others have tried to more explicitly convey the sense of\n\u2018ren\u2019 in the comprehensive sense of\nall-encompassing moral virtue through use of the translation\n\u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018Goodness\u2019 (see Waley, 1938, 1989;\nSlingerland, 2003). It is possible that the sense of ren as\nparticular virtue and the sense of comprehensive excellence are\nrelated in that attitudes such as care and respect for others may be a\npervasive aspect of different forms of moral excellence, e.g., such\nattitudes may be expressed in ritual performance, as discussed below,\nor in right or appropriate action according to the context. But this\nsuggestion is speculative, and because the very nature of ren\nremains so elusive, it shall be here referred to simply\nas\u2018ren\u2019.\n\nWhy is the central virtue discussed in such an elusive fashion in the\nAnalects? The answer may lie in the role that pre-theoretical\nexperience plays in Chinese philosophy. Tan (2005) has pointed to the\nnumber and vividness of the persons in the Analects who serve\nas moral exemplars. She suggests that the text invites us to exercise\nour imaginations in envisioning what these people might have been like\nand what we ourselves might become in trying to emulate them. Use of\nthe imagination, she points out, draws our attention to the\nparticularities of virtue and engages our emotions and desires. Amy\nOlberding (2008, 2012) develops the notion of exemplarism into a\nConfucian epistemology, according to which we get much of our\nimportant knowledge by encountering the relevant objects or persons.\nUpon initial contact, we may have little general knowledge of the\nqualities that make them so compelling to us, but we are motivated to\nfurther investigate. Confucius treated as exemplars legendary figures\nfrom the early days of the Zhou dynasty, such as the Duke of Zhou and\nKings Wu and Wen. Confucius served as an exemplar to his students,\nperhaps of the virtue of ren, though he never claimed the\nvirtue for himself. Book Ten of the Analects displays what\nmight appear to be an obsessive concern with the way Confucius greeted\npersons in everyday life, e.g., if he saw they were dressed in\nmourning dress, he would take on a solemn appearance or lean forward\non the stanchion of his carriage. Such concern becomes much more\ncomprehensible if Confucius is being treated as an exemplar of virtue\nfrom which the students are trying to learn. The focus of Book Ten and\nelsewhere in the Analects also suggests that the primary\nlocus of virtue is to be found in how people treat each other in the\nfabric of everyday life and not in the dramatic moral dilemmas so much\ndiscussed in contemporary Western moral philosophy.\n2.2 The centrality of li or ritual\n\nAnalects 1.15 likens the project of cultivating one\u2019s\ncharacter to crafting something fine from raw material: cutting bone,\ncarving a piece of horn, polishing or grinding a piece of jade. The\nchapter also stresses the importance of li (the rites,\nritual) in this project. In the Analects ritual ranges quite\nwidely to include ceremonies of ancestor worship, the burial of\nparents, and customs governing respectful and appropriate\nbehavior within the family and with friends, in everyday\ninteractions with others in one\u2019s village, and protocols for\nofficials performing their duties within the court.\n\nRitual is an exemplification of the saying that the personal is the\npolitical. It is personal in the sense that engaging in ritual,\nlearning to perform it properly and with the right attitudes of\nrespect and consideration while performing it, is to engage in a kind\nof cutting and carving and polishing and grinding of the self. One of\nthe most distinctive marks of Confucian ethics is the centrality of\nritual performance in the ethical cultivation of character. For\nexample, while Aristotelian habituation generally corresponds to the\nConfucian cultivation of character, there is no comparable\nemphasis in Aristotle on the role of ritual performance in this\nprocess of character transformation. Ritual is also political in the\nsense that the right governance of a society is thought to be founded\nupon the appropriate conduct of relationships at all levels in a\nsociety, starting with family relationships as the foundation. As\nOlberding puts it, the term li covers both\ngood manners and political civility because the Confucians did not\ndistinguish between them: \u201cboth require interpreting situations and\nsteering conduct to communicate respect, consideration, and\ntoleration. Success in both will likewise often depend on developed\ndisposition, on prior patterning that renders me more prone to one\nkind of response than another\u201d (2019, 28).\n\nIt is clear that in the Analects any complete\ndescription of self-cultivation must include a role for the culturally\nestablished customs that spell out what it means to express respect\nfor another person in various social contexts. Just how that role is\nconceived, however, is one of the central interpretive puzzles\nconcerning the Analects. The interpretive question of\nhow li is central to self-cultivation is posed in\nparticular about its relation to the chief virtue of ren. In\nthe Analects 3.3 the Master said, \u201cA man who is not\nren\u2014what has he to do with ritual?\u201d The\nimplication is that ritual is a means of cultivating and expressing a\nren that is already there, at least in a raw or unrefined\nstate. This implication about the role of ritual is consistent with\npassages of the Analects in which Confucius shows flexibility\non the question of whether to follow established ritual practice. 9.3\nshows him accepting the contemporary practice of wearing a cheaper\nsilk ceremonial cap rather than the traditional linen cap. 9.3 also\nshows Confucius rejecting the contemporary practice of bowing after\none ascends the stairs leading up to the ruler\u2019s dais, and\nmaintaining the traditional practice of bowing before one ascends the\nstairs. The implication is that the contemporary practice expresses\nthe wrong attitude toward the ruler\u2014presumptuousness in assuming\npermission to ascend. 9.3 suggests that it is something like the right\nattitude that is cultivated and expressed by ritual. Kwong-loi Shun\n(1993) has called this kind of understanding of ritual the\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d interpretation.\n\nHowever, in other places of the Analects, ritual seems to\ntake on a more central role in the achievement of ren.\nIndeed, it seems to be presented as the key. A very common\ntranslation of 12.1 has Confucius telling his favorite student Yan Hui\nthat \u201cRestraining yourself and returning to the rites\nconstitutes ren. If for one day you managed to restrain\nyourself and return to the rites, in this way you could lead the\nentire world back to ren. The key to achieving ren\nlies within yourself\u2014how could it come from others?\u201d\n(translation from Slingerland, 2003, though see Li, 2007, for a\ndifferent translation of the word wei usually translated as\n\u2018constitutes\u2019, with different implications for the\nquestion of the relation between li and ren). Such\npassages have given rise to the \u201cdefinitionalist\u201d\ninterpretation, as Shun calls it, which makes li definitive\nof the whole of ren. Obviously the instrumental and\ndefinitional interpretations cannot both be true.\n\nOne possibility for resolving this tension is to construe\nConfucius\u2019 remarks as directed towards a particular student and\ninformed by his conception of what sort of advice that student needs\nto hear given his strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps Confucius believes\nthat Yan Hui should be focusing on disciplining himself through\nobserving the rites, but his advice should not be be taken as an\nintended generalization about the relationship between ren\nand li. Perhaps the remarks that suggest more of an\ninstrumentalist construal of the relationship are similarly context\nand audience bound. Such interpretation, of course, leaves open the\nquestion of what that relationship is, or indeed, whether Confucius\never had in mind a generalization about the relationship that informed\nhis remarks.\n\nSome have argued that such serious conflicts within the text\nconstitute reasons for thinking that the Analects is an\naccretive text, i.e., composed of layers added at different times by\ndifferent people with conflicting views. To some extent, viewing the\nAnalects as accretive is nothing new, but Bruce and A. Takeo\nBrooks (1998, 2000) have taken that view very far by identifying Book\n4 (and only part of it, for that matter) as the most reflective of the\nhistorical Kongzi\u2019s views, and the other books as stemming from\nConfucius\u2019s students and members of his family. The different\nbooks, and, sometimes, individual passages within the books, represent\ndifferent time periods, people, with different agendas who are\nresponding to different conditions, and often putting forward\nincompatible strands of Confucianism. The Brooks suggest that the\nparts of the Analects most directly associated with the\nhistorical Confucius and his disciples are the parts that feature\nren as the pre-eminent virtue and that de-emphasize the role\nof ritual. The parts that are due to another trend in Confucianism,\nheaded by Confucius\u2019s descendants, are the parts that elevate\nritual as the key to ren. The Brooks\u2019s theory of the\nAnalects has drawn appreciation and disagreement (e.g., see\nSlingerland, 2000 for both). It threatens to dislodge the assumption\nthat underlies the dominant mode of interpreting the\nAnalects, which is that the text, or most of it, reflects the\ncoherent thought of one person.\n\nTao Jiang (2022) distinguishes between the sinological approach of the\nkind done by the Brooks and the approach of\nphilosophers that focuses on the \u201cinfluential received\ntext\u201d which presents to the reader a \u201ctextual\nauthor,\u201d e.g., a Confucius, to whom authorial intent is\nattributed through the sayings and ideas in the text. The philosopher\ninvestigates this textual object as part of a lengthy and highly\ninfluential philosophical and cultural tradition that often deploys\ntexts to address problems of contemporary concern. \n\nA third approach, different from though in some respects simiar to the\nsecond, is to acknowledge the real possibility that different sets of\npassages are the products of different thinkers, but also to hold that\nthese different thinkers might have employed different but\nphilosophically substantial perspectives on common problems. One of\nthose problems might indeed have been the relation between\nren and li, and at least part of the explanation of\nwhy different and potentially conflicting things are said about that\nrelation is that the relation is a difficult one to figure out and\nthat different thinkers addressing that common problem might\nreasonably have arrived at different things to say. Whether these\ndifferent things are ultimately irreconcilable remains an open\nquestion. This third approach merges with the second if one is open to\nthe possibility that the \u201ctextual author\u201d could be\nconceived as being of more than one mind as to how to solve the\nproblem in question.  This, after all, is a plausible thing to say\nabout some philosophers of whom we are pretty sure that they were the\nsingle authors of the texts under study. One might take a constructive\nattitude to the different possible solutions, ask what good\nphilosophical reasons could motivate the different approaches, and\ndetermine whether there is a way of reconciling what all the good\nreasons entail. If not, one can ask what might be the best solution,\nall things considered.\n\nKwong-loi Shun\u2019s approach to the ren and\nli is compatible with the third approach. Shun holds\nthat on the one hand, a particular set of ritual forms are the\nconventions that a community has evolved, and without such forms\nattitudes such as respect or reverence cannot be made intelligible or\nexpressed (reasons in favor of the definitionalist interpretation). In\nthis sense, li constitutes ren within or for a given\ncommunity. On the other hand, different communities may have different\nconventions that express respect or reverence, and moreover any given\ncommunity may revise its conventions in piecemeal though not wholesale\nfashion (reasons in favor of the instrumentalist interpretation).\n\nChenyang Li (2007) proposes a different approach based on a different\nreading of the word \u2018wei\u2019 used in 12.1 and often\ntranslated as \u2018constitutes\u2019 to render the crucial line,\n\u201cRestraining yourself and returning to the rites constitutes\nren.\u201d Li notes that a common meaning of the word is\n\u2018make\u2019 or \u2018result in.\u2019 The relation between\nli and ren need not be construed as either\ndefinitional or constitutive, nor need it be construed as purely\ninstrumental. Li proposes that li functions something like a\ncultural grammar where ren is like mastery of the culture.\nMastery of a language entails mastery of its grammar but not vice\nversa.\n\nBoth Shun and Li are striving to capture a way in which ren\ndoes not reduce to li but also a way in which li is\nmore than purely instrumental to the realization of ren.\nThere are good philosophical reasons for this move. Consider the\nreasons for resisting the reduction of ren to li. As\nindicated above, 9.3 suggests that the attitudes of respect and\nreverence that are expressed by ritual forms are not reducible to any\nparticular set of such forms, and Shun has a point in arguing that\nsuch attitudes could be expressed by different sets of such forms as\nestablished by different communities. In studying the cultures of\nother communities, we recognize that certain customs are meant to\nsignify respect, even if we do not share these customs, just as we\nrecognize that something that does not signify disrespect in our\nculture does indeed so signify in another culture. The fact that we\ncan distinguish the attitude from the ritual forms that we use to\nexpress them allows us to consider alternative ritual forms that could\nexpress the same or similar attitude. Ceremonial caps that are made of\nmore economical material are acceptable, perhaps, because wearing such\ncaps do not affect the spirit of the ceremony. By contrast,\nbowing after one ascends the stairs constitutes an unacceptable change\nin attitude. To maintain that particular ritual forms do not\ndefine the respect and reverence they are intended to express\nis not to underestimate their importance for cultivating and\nstrengthening these attitudes. Acting in ways that express respect\ngiven the conventionally established meanings of accepted ritual forms\nhelps to strengthen the agent\u2019s disposition to have respect. The\nethical development of character does involve strengthening some\nemotional dispositions over others, and we\n\n strengthen dispositions by acting on them. By providing\nconventionally established, symbolic ways to express respect for\nothers, ritual forms give participants ways to act on and therefore to\nstrengthen the right dispositions. The cultivating function of\nobserving ritual highlights the distinctive practical focus of\nConfucian ethics. It is every bit as concerned with how to\nacquire the right sort of character as it is with what the right sort\nis.\n\nOn the other hand, there is good reason to resist the reduction of\nli simply to the role of expressing and cultivating a set of\nattitudes and emotional dispositions. In his influential\ninterpretation (1972) of the Analects, Herbert Fingarette\nconstrues ritual performance as an end in itself, as beautiful and\ndignified, open and shared participation in ceremonies that celebrate\nhuman community. Ritual performance, internalized so that it becomes\nsecond nature, such that it is gracefully and spontaneously performed,\nis a crucial constituent of a fully realized human life. There are\nnonconventional dimensions of what it is to show respect, such as\nproviding food for one\u2019s parents (see Analects 2.7),\nbut the particular way the agent does this will be deeply influenced\nby custom. Indeed, custom specifies what is a respectful way of\nserving food. On the Confucian view, doing so in a graceful and\nwhole-hearted fashion as spelled out by the customs of one\u2019s\ncommunity is part of what it is to live a fully human life.\n\nRitual constitutes an important part of what ren is, and\nhence it is not merely an instrument for refining the substance of\nren. At the same time it is not the whole of ren.\nConsider that part of ren that involves attitudinal\ndispositions. Attitude is not reducible to ritual form even if acting\non that form can cultivate and sustain attitude. Moreover, 7.30\nemphasizes the connection between desire for ren and its\nachievement (\u201cIf I simply desire ren, I find that it is\nalready there\u201d). The achievement of ren is of course a\ndifficult and long journey, and so 7.30 implies that coming to truly\ndesire it lies at the heart of that achievement. The multifaceted\nnature of ren emerges in Book 12, where Confucius is\nportrayed as giving different descriptions of ren. In 12.1,\nas already noted, he says that ritual makes for ren. But then\nin 12.2, he says that ren involves comporting oneself in\npublic as if one were receiving an important guest and in the\nmanagement of the common people behaving as if one were overseeing a\ngreat sacrifice (the duty to be respectful toward others). 12.2 also\nassociates ren with shu or \u201csympathetic\nunderstanding,\u201d not imposing on others what you yourself do not\ndesire. Here the emphasis is not so much on ritual or not exclusively\nanyway, but on the attitudes one displays toward others, and on the\nability to understand what others want or do not want based on\nprojecting oneself into their situation. In 12.3, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that ren people are hesitant to\nspeak (suggesting that such people take extreme care not to have their\nwords exceed their actions). And then in 12.22, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that it is to care for people. Such\ndiverse characterizations are appropriate if ren is complete\nethical virtue or comprehensive excellence that includes many\ndimensions, including but not reducing to the kinds of excellence\nassociated with li.\n\nIf we take the relevant passages on li and ren as\nforming a whole in which a coherent view is embedded, there is a\npretty good case for regarding the observance of ritual propriety as a\nconstituent of ren as well as crucial for instrumentally\nrealizing some other dimensions of ren. But it does not\nexhaust the substance of ren. If the text is as radically\naccretive as the Brooks maintain, then the proposed construal of the\nrelation is more of a reconstruction of what the best philosophical\nposition might be on the nature of the relation. The reconstructive\npossibility should not be disturbing as long as we recognize it for\nwhat it is. Thinkers within a complex and vigorous tradition\nfrequently re-interpret, expand, develop, revise, and even reject some\nof what one has inherited from the past. The fact that the\nAnalects itself might be a product of this kind of engagement\nmight usefully be taken as encouragement for its present students to\nengage with the text in the same way.\n\nThe Confucian position on the importance of li in ethical\ncultivation is interesting and distinctive in its own right, and this\nis partly because Confucianism hews close to a kind of pre-theoretical\nexperience of the moral life that might otherwise get obscured by a\nmore purely theoretical approach to ethics. If we look at everyday\nexperience of the moral life, we see that much of the substance of\nethically significant attitudes such as respect is in fact given by\ncultural norms and practices, and learning a morality must involve\nlearning these norms and practices. Children learn what their behavior\nmeans to others, and what it should mean, by learning how to greet\neach other, make requests, and answer requests, all in a respectful\nmanner. Much of our everyday experience of moral socialization lies in\nthe absorption of or teaching to others of customs that are\nconventionally established to mean respect, gratitude, and other\nethically significant attitudes (see Olberding, 2016, 2019).\n\nSo construed, Confucian ethics provides an alternative to\nunderstanding the nature of the moral life that is different from an\nunderstanding that is primarily based on abstract principles, even\nabstract principles that require respect for each person. This is why\nthere is significant resonance between Confucianism and communitarian\nphilosophies such as those defended by Alasdair MacIntyre (1984, 1989)\nand Michael Walzer (1983). One of the distinctive marks of\ncommunitarianism is the theme that much of the substance of a morality\nis given not in abstract principles of the sort typically defended in\nmodern Western philosophy but in a society\u2019s specific customs\nand practices. In the Analects, the ambiguous relation\nbetween ren and li poses the problematic of how we\nare to understand the relation between cultural norms and practices on\nthe one hand and that part of morality that appears to transcend any\nparticular set of norms and practices. The Analects suggests\na large role for culture, but on the reading suggested here, not a\ndefinitional role. There is much room for theoretical elaboration on\nthe nature of that role.\n\nFurthermore, in understanding why Confucians take a life of ritual\npractice to be partly constitutive of a fully human life, one must\nunderstand the aesthetic dimension of their notion of a fully human\nlife. Such a life is lived as a beautiful and graceful coordinated\ninteraction with others according to conventionally established forms\nthat express mutual respect. A good part of the value attached to the\nfully human life lies in the aesthetic dimensions of a\n\u201cdance\u201d (Ihara, 2004) one performs with others. To better\nunderstand why the moral and the aesthetic cannot be cleanly separated\nin Confucian ethics, consider that a graceful and whole-hearted\nexpression of respect can be beautiful precisely because it reflects\nthe extent that the agent has made this moral attitude part of their\nsecond nature. The beauty has a moral dimension. Both these\nthemes\u2014the importance of contextualized moral judgment and\naesthetic value of human interaction according to custom and\ntradition\u2014offer opportunities for practitioners of, say,\nAnglo-American moral philosophy to reflect on what their approaches to\nthe moral life might miss.\n2.3 Ren and li as relational values in contrast to values of individual autonomy\n\nConsider ren in its meaning as the particular virtue of\ncaring for others and li in its aspect as the valued human\ndance. These values are the basis for characterizing Confucian ethics\nas a relational ethic, meaning that it is in part distinguished by its\nplacement of relationships at the center of a well-lived life (see\nAmes, 2011, 2021). Confucian ethics are often taken to stand in\ncontrast to ethics that place individual autonomy and freedom to\nchoose how to live. While there is much that is true about this\ncontrast, it must be carefully described so as to differentiate it\nfrom some other contrasts. For example, the value of individual\nautonomy usually includes several different dimensions that do not\nnecessarily accompany one another: (1) prioritizing of individual\ninterests over group or collective interests when these conflict; (2)\ngiving moral permission to the individual to choose from a\nsignificantly wide range (within certain moral boundaries) of ways to\nlive; and (3) emphasizing the importance of living according to\none\u2019s own understanding of what is right and good even if others\ndo not see it the same way.\n\nConfucian ethics in significant part, though not in all parts, accepts\nautonomy in the sense of (3) (see Shun, 2004; and Brindley, 2010).\nConfucius is often depicted in the Analects as emphasizing\nthe importance of cultivating one\u2019s own character even when\nothers do not recognize or appreciate one\u2019s efforts (e.g., 4.14)\nand of acting independently of what is conventionally approved or\ndisapproved (e.g., 5.1). The texts associated with Mencius (Mengzi,\nbest known in the West under his Latinized name, lived in the 4th\ncentury B.C.E.) and Xunzi (4th and 3rd centuries\nB.C.E.), the most pivotal thinkers in the classical Confucian\ntradition after Confucius, both articulate the necessity to speak up\nwhen one believes the ruler one is serving is on a wrong course of\naction (e.g., Mencius 1A3 and Xunzi 29.2). On the\nother hand, none of these classical thinkers argue for the necessity\nof protecting a frank subordinate from a ruler who is made angry by\ncriticism, and it could be argued that Confucianism does not fully\nendorse autonomy in sense (3) without endorsing such protection for\nthose who wish to engage in moral criticism of the powerful.\n\nMost interpretations present Confucian ethics as rejecting (2). There\nis a way for human beings to live, a comprehensive human good to be\nrealized, and there can be no choosing between significantly different\nways of life that are equally acceptable from a moral perspective (an\nimportant exception to this kind of interpretation is provided by Hall\nand Ames, 1987, who interpret Confucius\u2019s dao as a\nhuman invention, collective and individual). On the other hand,\nConfucian ethics de-emphasizes legal coercion as a method for guiding\npeople along the way and instead emphasizes moral exhortation and\ninspiration by way of example (see, most famously, 2.3 of the\nAnalects, which emphasizes the necessity of a ruler\u2019s\nguiding his people by instilling in them a sense of shame rather than\nby the threat of external punishment). While a Confucian might believe\nin a single correct way for human beings, they might endorse a\nsignificant degree of latitude for people to learn from their own\nmistakes and by way of example from others (see Chan, 1999).\n\nConfucian ethics does not accept (1), but not because it subordinates\nindividual interests to group or collective interests (for criticism\nof the rather common interpretation of Confucianism as prioritizing\nthe group over the individual, see Hall and Ames 1998). Rather, there\nis a different conception of the relationship between individual and\ngroup interests. The best illustration of this different conception is\na story to be found in the Mencius that concerns sage-king\nShun. When Shun wanted to marry, he knew that his father, influenced\nby his stepmother, would not allow him to marry. In this difficult\nsituation, Shun decided to marry without telling his father, even\nthough he is renowned for his filiality. Mencius in fact defends the\nfiliality of Shun\u2019s act in 5A2. He observes that Shun knew that\nhe would not have been allowed to marry if he told his father. This\nwould have resulted in bitterness toward his parents, and that is why\nhe did not tell them. The implication of this version of Shun\u2019s\nreason is that filiality means preserving an emotionally viable\nrelationship with one\u2019s parents, and in the case at hand Shun\njudged that it would have been worse for the relationship to have\nasked permission to marry. The conception of the relation between\nindividual and group interests embodied in this story is not one of\nsubordination of one to the other but about the mutual dependence\nbetween the individual and the group. The individual depends on the\ngroup and must make the group\u2019s interests part of their own\ninterests, but, on the other side of the equation, the group depends\non the individual and must make that individual\u2019s interests part\nof the group\u2019s interests. Shun\u2019s welfare depends on his\nfamily and therefore must make his family\u2019s interests part of\nhis own (he resolves to do what is necessary to preserve his\nrelationship to his parents), but his family\u2019s welfare depends\non Shun, and therefore it must recognize his interests to constitute\npart of its welfare (the family must recognize that it is damaging\nitself in requiring Shun to deny himself the most part important of\nhuman relationships).\n\nThe way that Confucianism conceives of the relationship between the\nindividual and the group, as well as the way it is typically\nmisconceived, is reflected in its notion of harmony or\nhe. A typical misconception of harmony as a Confucian value\nis that it involves agreement and conformity with the views of others.\nIn Analects 13.23, however, Confucius says that the\njunzi pursues harmony rather than sameness, while the small\nperson does the opposite. The pre-Confucian thinker Yan Ying expresses\na similar idea about harmony in likening it to a soup made with meat\nor fish, the strong flavor of which must be balanced and complemented\nby other ingredients such as vinegar, sauce, salt, and plum\n(Zuozhuan, Duke Zhao, 20th year; see Legge 1960 translation).\nThe metaphor is meant to convey the idea that a ruler will not seek\nonly ministers who agree with him but will seek to reconcile a\ndiversity of viewpoints from his ministers. Reconciliation not only\ninvolves acceptance of difference but also acceptance of a degree of\ntension and conflict, even if one seeks to reduce the latter from\ndangerous levels (Li 2014; Wong 2020) to achieve a productive\nequilibrium. Moreover, that equilibrium is dynamic and is continuously\ncreated and re-created.\n\nSuccess in achieving a satisfactory equilibrium is never guaranteed.\nConfucian ethics draws much of its appeal and power from its placing\nat the center of our attention the human desire for connection with\nothers. At the same time, satisfying connections can be surprisingly\nfragile and subject to both predictable and unpredictable conflict.\nActing in accordance with li and cultivating one\u2019s\ndispositions for respect and tolerance of others is a way of\nmaking desired relationships more fruitful and less alienating\n(Olberding 2019). However, we have limited control over what others do\nand over what happens to them. As a result, the most satisfying\nrelationships also make us exceedingly vulnerable when they break or\nare lost through separation and death. We may never be the same\npersons when such loss occurs, and a continuing concern of the\nConfucian tradition is how to reckon with such loss when one\u2019s\nidentity as a person includes significant others and our moral\ncommitments to them (for a discussion of how this is treated in the\nConfucian tradition, with connections drawn to feminist analyses of\nthe way our ties to others makes for value and vulnerability, see Ing\n2017). The wholeness and integrity of one\u2019s relational identity may be\nthreatened with disintegration upon the loss of these others, or when\none\u2019s multiple attachments present conflicting and possibly\nirreconcilable demands on the self. Ing (2017) points out that\nthe Confucian tradition as a whole produced different points of view\non whether it was always possible to deal successfully with threats to\nthe integrity of the self. One point of view, which might be\nreasonably attributed to the Analects, Mencius,\nand Xunzi, is that there is always a way to preserve\none\u2019s integrity if one is wise and able enough. Ing articulates\nanother point of view elsewhere defended in the Confucian\ntradition, to the effect that there are inherently tragic situations\nin which no option could be said to be right or best. This second\npossibility resonates with one defended in contemporary Western moral\nand political philosophy by philosophers such as Michael Walzer\n(1973).\n2.4 Filiality and care with distinctions in Confucian ethics\n\nAlong with the emphasis on li, the centrality of filiality is\none of the most distinctive characteristics of Confucian ethics. The\nAnalects 2.6 says to give parents no cause for anxiety other\nthan illness, whereas 2.7, as mentioned earlier, emphasizes the need\nfor the material support of parents to be carried out in a respectful\nmanner. 2.8 emphasizes that it is the expression on one\u2019s face\nthat is filial and not just taking on the burden of work or letting\nelders partake of the wine and food before others.\n\nIs obedience to parents always required of the filial child? What if\nthe child believes that parents are wrong and their wishes run\ncontrary to what is right or to ren? In those cases where one\nthinks them wrong, what is one to do? The Analects 2.5\nportrays Confucius as saying, \u201cDo not disobey,\u201d but when\nqueried further as to his meaning, he explains obedience in terms of\nconformance to the rites for burying and sacrificing to deceased\nparents. In 4.18 Confucius says that when one disagrees with\none\u2019s parents, one should remonstrate with them gently. Most\ntranslations of what follows have Confucius concluding that if parents\nare not persuaded, one should not oppose them (e.g., Lau, 1979;\nSlingerland, 2003; Waley, 1938), but it is possible to read the spare\nand ambiguously worded passage as requiring instead that one not\nabandon one\u2019s purpose in respectfully trying to change\none\u2019s parents\u2019 minds (Legge, 1971; see Huang, 2013,\n133\u2013137 for a survey of the different interpretations and an argument\nfor the persistence-in-remonstrating translation). In other Confucian\ntexts, the question of whether obedience is required has received\ndifferent answers in the Confucian tradition. Chapters 1 and 2 of the\nRecord of Ritual (Legge, 1967, vol. 1) say that one must obey\nif one fails to persuade one\u2019s parent. On the other hand, Xunzi\ndeclares that following the requirements of morality rather than the\nwishes of one\u2019s father is part of the highest standard of\nconduct (29.1 of the Xunzi; for a translation see Knoblock,\n1988\u201394; or Hutton 2014) and moreover that if following the\ncourse of action mandated by one\u2019s father would bring disgrace\nto the family and not following it would bring honor, then not\nfollowing is to act morally (29.2 of the Xunzi).\nXunzi\u2019s position is supported in part by the distinction between\nservice to parents and obedience to them. It might very well fail to\nbe of service to parents if following their wishes is to bring moral\ndisgrace to them and the family.\n\nAnother ethical issue arising from the strong Confucian emphasis on\nfiliality concerns possible conflicts between loyalty to parents and\nloyalty to the ruler or public justice. Consider again\nAnalects 13.18, in which Confucius says that uprightness is\nfound in sons and fathers covering up for each other. In this case, at\nleast, loyalty to parents or to children takes precedence over loyalty\nto ruler or to public justice. This precedence is one implication of\nthe Confucian doctrine of care with distinctions (\u201clove with\ndistinctions\u201d is a frequent translation, but perhaps \u201ccare\nwith distinctions\u201d is less misleading because it covers both the\nemotionally freighted attitude toward kin and a more distanced\nattitude toward strangers). Though all people are owed moral concern,\nsome are owed more than others, according to the agent\u2019s\nrelationship to them.\n\nJiang (2021) argues that much of the dynamic development of classical\nChinese philosophy springs from a tension between values of humaneness\nbased on special relationships such as family membership, on the one\nhand, and on the other hand, impartial values such as justice, a\ntension that surfaces in the Analects. The Confucian\nresponse to this tension divides, he suggests, between two streams: an\n\u201cextensionist\u201d approach that sees the two kinds of value as ultimately\ncompatible, and a \u201csacrificialist\u201d approach that focuses on the\nconflict between them and prioritizes humaneness. \n\nAn alternative reading of the tradition that does not put the tension\nquite so much at the center would not construe the relationship\nbetween humaneness and justice as inherently conflictual: after all,\nthe Confucians recognized that family loyalty is the foundation\nfor the development of moral concern for the welfare of others\noutside the family and at the same time that circumstances can bring\nthe two kinds of value into conflict. In any case, it seems right to\nsee the relationship between these values and the different ways that\nthinkers reacted to that relationship as a fertile source of newly\ndeveloping streams of thought.\n\nThis issue works into understanding the thought of a pivotal\ncritic of Confucianism in the classical period. Mozi (probably\n5th century B.C.E), who possibly was once a student of\nConfucianism, came to reject that teaching, partly on the grounds that\nthe Confucian emphasis on ritual and musical performance was a\nwasteful expenditure of resources that could otherwise be used to meet\nthe basic needs of the many (Mozi, for a translation,\nsee Books 25, 32 in Fraser 2020). A related criticism in the text\nof the Mozi is that tradition does not hold normative\nauthority simply because it is tradition, for there was a time when\nthe practice in question was not tradition but new (Book 39 in\nFraser). If a practice has no authority when it is new, it has no\nauthority at any subsequent time simply because it is getting\nolder.\n\nMozi also argued that exclusive concern for one\u2019s own (oneself,\none\u2019s family, one\u2019s state) is at the root of all\ndestructive conflict (Book 16 in Fraser). Exclusive concern for the\nself causes the strong to rob the weak. Exclusive concern for\none\u2019s family causes great families to wreak havoc on lesser\nfamilies (it is not difficult to see how this thought might apply to\nthe idea of protecting one\u2019s own, even if they have committed\nserious crimes against others outside the family). Exclusive concern\ntoward one\u2019s state causes great states to attack small states.\nMozi advocated the doctrine of jian ai as a remedy.\n\u201cAi\u201d usually means \u201clove\u201d or\n\u201caffection,\u201d but for Mozi it probably meant an emotionally\ncooler form of concern. \u201cJian\u201d usually means\n\u201cinclusive.\u201d One possible translation of \u201cjian\nai\u201d is \u201cinclusive care\u201d (see Fraser, 2016).\nOther translations render \u201cjian\u201d as\n\u201cimpartial,\u201d as in \u201cimpartial care\u201d (see\nIvanhoe 2005). The latter translation conveys clearly the\nunderstanding that Confucians, at least since Mencius, have had of\njian ai, which is that it requires one to have equal concern\nfor everyone regardless of one\u2019s relationship to them. The next\nsection explains how Mencius incorporated this understanding of\njian ai in his criticism of it and in his development of\nConfucian ethics.\n2.5 Mencius\u2019s defense of care with distinctions and his theory of the roots of moral knowledge and motivation in human nature\n\nThe substantial following that Mohism gained in the classical period\nforced a response from Confucians (see Hansen, 1992, and Van Norden\n2007, for a discussion of Mozi\u2019s pivotal impact on the Chinese\ntradition). They responded on two subjects: first, they had to address\nwhat is required by way of concern for all people and how to reconcile\nsuch concern with the greater concern for some that the Confucian\ndoctrine of care with distinctions requires; second, they had to\naddress the question of what kinds of concern are motivationally\npossible for human beings, partly in response to the Mohist argument\nthat it is not difficult to act on jian ai (which they came\nto interpret as being contrary to care with distinctions), and partly\nin response to others who were skeptical about the possibility of\nacting on any kind of genuinely other-regarding concern. Mencius, in\nthe text purporting to be a record of his teachings, explicitly sets\nhimself to the task of defending Confucianism not only against Mohism\nbut the teachings of Yang Zhu. Yang\u2019s teachings seemed to\nMencius to sit on the opposite end of the spectrum from Mohism (there\nis no surviving text purporting to articulate and defend Yangism).\nAccording to Mencius\u2019s characterization, Yang Zhu criticized\nboth Mohism and Confucianism for asking people to sacrifice themselves\nfor others. Yang Zhu on this view was an ethical egoist: i.e., one who\nholds that it is always right to promote one\u2019s own welfare.\nMencius positioned Confucianism as the occupying the correct mean\nbetween the extremes of having concern only for oneself on the one\nhand and having an equal degree of concern for everyone.\n\nMencius 1A7 purports to be an account of a conversation\nbetween Mencius and King Xuan, the ruler of a Chinese state. Mencius\nis attempting to persuade the king to adopt the Confucian dao\nor way of ruling. The king wonders whether he really can be the kind\nof king Mencius is advocating, and Mencius replies by asking whether\nthe following story he has heard about the king is true. The story is\nthat the king saw an ox being led to slaughter for a ritual sacrifice.\nThe king decided to spare the ox and substituted a lamb for the ritual\nsacrifice. Thinking back on that occasion, the king recalls that it\nwas the look in the ox\u2019s eyes, like that of an innocent man\nbeing led to execution, that led him to substitute the lamb. Mencius\nthen comments that this story demonstrates the king\u2019s capability\nto become a true king, and that all he has to do is to extend the sort\nof compassion he showed the ox to his own people. To say that he can\ncare for an ox but not for his people is like saying \u201cmy\nstrength is sufficient to lift heavy weight, but not enough to lift a\nfeather\u201d (translation adapted from Lau, 1970a) His failure to\nact on behalf of his people is due simply to his not acting, not to an\ninability to act. What the king has to do, suggests Mencius, is to\ntreat the aged in his family as aged, and then extend it to the aged\nin other families; treat his young ones as young ones, and extend it\nto the young ones of others; then he can turn the whole world in the\npalm of his hand.\n\nThe passage demonstrates one characteristic of the text that is\npertinent to Mencius\u2019s response to Mohism and quite possibly its\ninfluence on him. In contrast to the Analects, the\nruler\u2019s duties to care for his people are more frequently\ndiscussed and play a more prominent role in the conception of a\nruler\u2019s moral excellence. Mencius is portrayed in this text as\nvery much engaged in getting the kings of Chinese states to stop\nmistreating their subjects, to stop drafting their subjects into their\nwars of territorial expansion, and to avoid overtaxing them to finance\ntheir wars and lavish projects. At the same time, Mencius\u2019s\nassertion that the king is able to extend the kind of concern he\nshowed the ox toward his own people is a reply to those who advocate\nYangism on the grounds that acting for one\u2019s own sake is\nnatural. Mencius holds that natural compassion is a part of human\nnature. The task of moral self-cultivation is the task of\n\u201cextending\u201d what is natural. What is natural, or at least\nmore so, is properly acting toward the aged and the young in\none\u2019s family and then extending that to the aged and the young\nin other families.\n\nExtension is necessary because natural compassion is uneven compared\nto where it ought to extend. King Xuan may find it natural to have\ncompassion for an innocent man about to be executed or a terrified ox\nabout to be slaughtered, but not toward all his subjects when he is\nfocusing on the benefits that a war of territorial expansion might\nbring him. This story of Mencius, the King, and the ox is rich\nmaterial for reflection on the nature of moral development. It seems\nplausible that development must begin with something that is of the\nright nature to be shaped into the moral virtues, and also plausible\nthat what we begin with is not as it fully should be. The questions\nposed by the story is what the natural basis of morality is and how\nfurther development occurs. Mencius\u2019s theory of the \u201cfour\nduan\u201d addresses these questions.\n\u201cDuan\u201d literally means \u201ctip of\nsomething\u201d and is often translated as \u201cbeginnings\u201d\nin this context.\n\nWhat are the four beginnings of morality? In 2A6 human nature (ren\nxing) it is said that no person is devoid of a heart (the word\nfor heart in Chinese stands for the seat of thinking and feeling,\nhence often translated as \u201cthe mind\u201d) sensitive to the\nsuffering of others, and to illustrate this beginning, Mencius asks us\nto suppose that a man were suddenly to see a young child about to fall\ninto a well. Such a man would certainly be moved to compassion, not\nbecause he wanted to get in the good graces of the parents, nor\nbecause he wished to win the praise of his fellow villagers or\nfriends, nor yet because he disliked the cry of the child. This\nnatural compassion can develop into the virtue of ren (in\nMencius, ren is more often a particular virtue that concerns\ncaring and hence is often translated as \u201cbenevolence\u201d or\n\u201chumaneness\u201d). A second beginning is the heart that feels shame in\ncertain situations, e.g., in 6A10, Mencius says that if rice and soup\nare offered after being trampled upon, even a beggar would disdain\nthem. Under the right conditions, innate shame develops into the\nvirtue of yi or righteousness\u2014being able to do the\nright thing and dedication to doing it. The third beginning is the\nheart that feels courtesy,e.g., the younger sometimes instinctively\nknows to respect and be courteous to the older. Under the right\nconditions, courtesy develops into li, which as a virtue\nconsists in the observance of the rites or the virtue of ritual\npropriety. And finally, there is the heart that can make morally\nrelevant distinctions (shi/fei, the thing to do or not\nto do). Under the right conditions, this sense of approval and\ndisapproval develops into wisdom, which includes having a grasp of the\nspirit behind moral rules so that one knows how to be flexible in\napplying them.\n\nIt is important to note that Mencian beginnings of morality are not\njust blind feelings or primitive urges to act in certain ways, but\ncontain within them certain intuitive judgments about what is right\nand wrong, what is to be disdained and what is deferential, respectful\nbehavior. In the example of the beggar who does not accept food that\nhas been trampled upon, it seems that Mencius is suggesting we have an\noriginal, unlearned sense that allows us to judge the sort of respect\nthat is due to ourselves as human beings. Similarly, in suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of deference, Mencius is suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of what is due to others such as\nelders and our parents. Mencius\u2019s theory tallies with some of\nthe more recent theories of emotion that point toward the intertwining\nof cognitive and affective dimensions (the theory does not necessarily\nimply, however, that the affective amounts to nothing more than the\ncognitive, as shall be discussed later).\n\nThe Mencius contains different metaphors that convey a view\nof human nature as the basis for moral development. On one metaphor,\nused in a debate with rival philosopher Gaozi in 6A2, the inborn\ngoodness of human nature is like the tendency of water to flow\ndownward. The metaphor implies that human beings develop virtues in\nthe absence of abnormal interference such as water being damned up or\nstruck so that it splashes upward. On the other way of conceiving\nethical development, the four beginnings are more like barley sprouts\nthat need nurture analogous to sun, water, and fertile soil (6A7).\nMencius seems to treat the the two conceptions as equivalent, but\narguably they are are significantly different since\nthe \u201cgrowing\u201d conditions for the sprouts are not\nnecessarily provided in the normal course of affairs (see Wong,\n2015b).\n\nIn some passages, extension is characterized as a matter of simply\npreserving or not losing what is given to one at birth (4B12, 4B19,\n4B28, 6A10, 6A11), and such passages accord with the water metaphor in\nsuggesting that moral development happens in the absence of abnormal\ninterference. In other places, the thinking seems to be more in accord\nwith the sprout metaphor and identifies conditions for moral\ndevelopment that go well beyond noninterference: kings are held\nresponsible for providing for their subjects a constant means of\nlivelihood (1A7) that enables them to support parents and nurture wife\nand children; kings must also ensure the appropriate moral education\nabout filiality, about the duties that rulers and subjects owe to each\nother and about respect for the elder. Mencius furthermore recognized\nnatural predispositions other than the four beginnings that could\npotentially lead human beings astray. He mentions the desires of the\nsenses in this regard (6A15). This is why Mencius places\nresponsibility on everyone to si (reflect on, turn over in\none\u2019s mind) (6A14, 6A15) the manifestations of the four\nbeginnings. With such reflection, human beings can recognize that\nvirtue takes precedence over satisfaction of potentially conflicting\ndesires and feelings (e.g., the priority of righteousness over the\ndesire for life if one cannot have both), but lack of reflection will\nstunt moral development (6A9). If the deprivation of nourishing\nconditions is severe enough, the sprouts can be killed off (6A8).\nThus, while Mencius is often characterized superficially by his saying\nthat human nature is good (6A6), he means (at least when his thinking\nis guided by the sprout metaphor) that it contains predispositions to\nfeel and act in morally appropriate ways and to make intuitive\nnormative judgments that can with the right nurturing conditions give\nhuman beings guidance as to the proper emphasis to be given to the\ndesires of the senses (see Shun, 1997; Van Norden, 2004, 2007).\n\nIt is not surprising that there should be the kind of ambiguity\nexpressed by the juxtaposition of the water and sprout metaphors in\nMencius. A very common contemporary conception of the innate comes\nvery close to the implications of the water metaphor, i.e., that which\ndevelops under normal conditions. On the other hand, we are also\ncapable of recognizing that other things develop under a narrower or\nmuch more contingent (not necessarily realized in the normal course of\naffairs) set of conditions. A barley sprout develops only if human\nbeings plant it in the right kind of soil and put effort into\ncultivating it. Yet it seems intuitively correct to say that its\ndirection of growth is innate. If the conditions for growth are\nrealized, it will become a barley plant, not a corn plant.\nContemporary thinking about the innate bases of morality also shows\nthis range of thinking. Claims that morality is constrained by an\ninnate universal grammar (e.g., Hauser, 2008; Mikhail, 2011) seem\ncloser to the idea that the moral (or its underlying universal\nstructure) develops under normal conditions; other conceptions\nacknowledge more of a role for contingent factors (Nichols, 2004;\nHaidt and Bjorklund 2008). The ambiguity in Mencius\u2019 thought,\nthen, anticipates contemporary swings in thinking about the relative\nroles of what human beings are born with and what they acquire through\nlearning, experience and culture.\n\nMuch of what is fascinating in Mencius lies in his explorations of how\nmoral learning takes place and how this learning might also interact\nwith emotion. Consider now in combination the theme that the cognitive\nand affective go into the constitution of emotion and the theme that\nthe emotional beginnings of morality can be extended through provision\nof the right kind of nurture. What is necessary for extension? Is\ncognitive extension, i.e., more moral knowledge, sufficient? The\nanswer to this question depends on the nature of the intertwining\nbetween the cognitive and affective in emotions. Consider again the\nstory of King Xuan and the ox. Mencius expresses confidence in King\nXuan\u2019s ability to have compassion for his people, based on his\nact of compassion for the ox. Here the question of whether cognitive\nextension is sufficient emerges in the concrete. Was it sufficient for\nMencius to have reminded the king that he has even more of a reason to\nspare his people from suffering than he had to spare the ox from\nsuffering (more reason because Mencius clearly ranks the interests of\nanimals below those of human beings, and because for him there is a\ngood moral reason for the performance of ritual sacrifices)? Logical\nconsistency alone cannot be expected to provide motivation, as David\nNivison has pointed out (1996), but then what is Mencius trying to do\nwith the King if not move him through logic?\n\nNowhere in the Mencius is there enough said to point to a\ndefinitive interpretation on this matter, but various reconstructions\nof possible positions can be given. Perhaps the King\u2019s innate\nnature contains all the motivation he needs, and all that Mencius is\ndoing is reminding him that he has the motivation to spare his people.\nThis interpretation seems roughly in accord with Mencius\u2019\nlikening moral development to water flowing downward: it will proceed\nunless interfered with. Perhaps the King\u2019s nature needs some\ndegree of transformation that starts with the sort of compassion he\ncan feel for a terrified ox or an innocent man about to be executed\nand then expands the scope of that compassion to more of its\nappropriate objects. This interpretation seems roughly in accord with\nMencius\u2019 likening moral development to the growth of sprouts\nthat need the appropriate water, soil and cultivation efforts. (See\nIm, 1999, Ivanhoe, 2002, Shun, 1997, Wong, 2002, Van Norden, 2007, and\nMcRae 2011 for a range of different possible positions that could be\nattributed to Mencius).\n\nWhat seems philosophically fruitful about the Xuan and ox story is\nthat it portrays an attempt at moral teaching of the kind that\nactually occurs in the moral life, and the ambiguity that it presents\nto the reader is fruitful precisely because it is not a completely\ntheorized story. We are not told exactly what Mencius is trying to do\nwith the King in terms of a theory of the nature of emotions and the\nrelation between the cognitive and affective. Rather, we are led to\nreflect on the most plausible possibilities in trying to arrive at a\nreconstruction of what might have been meant by the text, as well as\nwhat might be the most illuminating position on its own merits. The\nstory is particularly intriguing for those philosophers who believe in\nthe possibility that learning can influence emotion at the same time\nthat emotion can help learning become motivationally efficacious. At\none moment in the conversation between King Xuan and Mencius, the King\nremarks that Mencius has helped him to understand that he was truly\nmotivated by compassion to spare the ox. As Mencius was talking, he\nsays, he felt the stirrings of compassion again. It is at this point\nthat Mencius reminds the King of the suffering of his people. Perhaps\nwhat Mencius was trying to do was to expand the scope of the\nKing\u2019s feeling for those who suffer. He may know in the abstract\nthat he has a duty to advance the welfare of his people, but he may\nnot feel it very much, and by stimulating the King to re-experience\nthe feeling of compassion he had for the ox, Mencius is perhaps trying\nto get that feeling to expand to include his subjects. Mencius is\nreminding the King of his duty precisely when he has primed the King\nto assimilate it emotionally. In any case, this is a plausible picture\nof how the cognitive and affective can interact in emotionally\ndevelopment and both be necessary for effective moral motivation (see\nWong, 2015a).\n\nIf we recall Mencius\u2019s saying in 6A10 that even a beggar would\nrefuse food that has been trampled upon, we may infer that something\nlike a concept of human dignity is implied. In virtue of the four\nduan, we are entitled to respect. What is of further\ninterest, however, is the idea that the source of our dignity is also\nthe source of our responsibilities to each other and to ourselves. We\nhave the responsibility of reflecting on the duan, and if we\nabuse them and kill them off, we have made ourselves unworthy of the\nrespect to which we were originally entitled. These implications of\nthe Mencian idea about the source of human dignity are not so much\nhighlighted in the Western tradition. The idea that we might render\nourselves unworthy of the basic respect to which we are originally\nentitled might appear harsh, but what should be kept in mind is that\nothers share in the responsibility to develop our duan (see\nsection 2.8 below). Most importantly our family shares in that\nresponsibility, but as Mencius also emphasizes, the king has\nresponsibility for putting in the conditions for material security\nthat enable most people to reflect on and develop their duan.\nIn fact Mencius holds responsible the king who does not provide a\nconstant means of livelihood for the crimes his people commit in order\nto survive and feed their families. It is those who have adequate\nmaterial security and moral education and yet who still fail to\nreflect who must bear the fuller share of responsibility for their\nwrongdoing.\n\nWhat about the priority of filial loyalty over loyalty to the larger\ncommunity? Mencius\u2019 defense of this priority draws from his\ntheory of human nature as containing not only the beginnings of\naffective motivations for being moral but also intuitive judgments\nabout what is right and about what deserves the feeling of shame. His\nquestion to a Mohist, Yizi, is how Yizi can justify providing his\ndeceased parents a special burial when the Mohist prescriptions are\nfor a plain burial for anyone. Yizi\u2019s reply is to quote from the\nBook of History: the sage-kings treated all their subjects as\nif they were their new-born children. Yizi\u2019s interpretation of\nthis saying is that there should be no distinctions in one\u2019s\nconcern for people, though the practice of it may begin with\none\u2019s parents (how concern without distinctions is compatible\nwith special burial for one\u2019s parents is unclear, and there is\nno further clarification in 3A5, but the issue involves the question\nof what Mohists meant by jian ai, which is addressed in\nsection 3 below). Mencius\u2019s counter-reply is to ask whether Yizi\nreally holds that a person loves his elder brother\u2019s son no more\nthan his neighbor\u2019s baby. This is not just an assertion about\nwhat people tend to feel but also an assertion about what people\nintuitively hold to be right to feel and to do. Then Mencius makes a\npuzzling remark to the effect that Yizi is singling out a special\nfeature in a certain case: \u201cwhen a new-born babe creeps toward a\nwell, it is not its fault.\u201d This last part of Mencius\u2019s\nresponse is puzzling because Yizi did not say anything about a baby\nand a well. One possibility is that Yizi may have obliquely referred\nto Mencius\u2019s claim that all have the original and unlearned\nfeeling of distress at seeing a child about to fall into a well. In\nother words, Yizi might have been challenging Mencius by asking,\n\u201cDoes not your own postulated unlearned compassion require us to\nregard that child the same way, regardless of whose child it\nis?\u201d This way of taking Yizi helps makes sense of\nMencius\u2019s reply. First, he points out what he takes to be the\nindisputably greater affection one feels for elder brother\u2019s son\nover one\u2019s neighbor\u2019s baby. Mencius grants that we all\nrespond to a child about to fall into the well with alarm and\ndistress, and it doesn\u2019t matter whose child it is. However, one\ncannot infer from this one particular situation that we ought to have\nequal concern for everyone in all situations. The case of the\nchild about to fall into the well has a particular feature that makes\nit relevant to treat it as one would any child. That feature seems to\nbe innocence.\n\nThe Mencian position is premised on the principle that it is right to\ntreat all people alike only when the ways they are alike are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. We should do the same\nthing only when the similarities between two cases are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. Mencius believes that in\nmany instances, the presence or absence of a family relationship to a\nperson is the most relevant feature (in deciding which children to\ngive gifts, the fact that one child is one\u2019s elder\nbrother\u2019s son and the other child is one\u2019s\nneighbor\u2019s child may be the most relevant feature). In other\ntypes of situations, such as a child about to fall into a well, it is\nthe innocence that children share that is the most relevant feature.\nThat is why it is proper to feel alarm or distress toward any child in\nthat situation. The implied application of this idea to the\nsage-kings\u2019 treatment of the people is that these kings treated\nall people alike insofar as they did not deserve the harm about to\nbefall them.\n\nTwo issues arise from this response to Mohism as he understood it\n(whether he understood it correctly will be addressed in section 3).\nOne issue is whether Mencius has sufficient warrant to trust the kinds\nof intuitive judgments he attributes to human nature. Mencius holds\nthat the beginnings of morality are sent by Heaven, but in the absence\nof such a metaphysical warrant, can these intuitive judgments be\naccepted, particularly the ones that underwrite care with\ndistinctions? Doubt about the metaphysical warrant may not doom\nMencius\u2019s response to Mohism, however, if one holds that all\nnormative theories ultimately depend on intuitive judgments and if one\nhas no good reason to be skeptical about these judgments. Thus one\nmight hold that whether or not there is a metaphysical warrant, there\nis a great deal of plausibility to the intuitive judgment about owing\nparents more concern because they are the source of one\u2019s life\nand nurturance. Of course one might also hold, as Mencius appears to\nhold, that people are owed concern in virtue of their being human, and\nthe possibility for conflict of duties arises from these different\nsources of concern. The second issue is how the Mencius text\ndeals with conflicts of the sort exemplified by the sheep-stealing\ncase in the Analects.\n\nThe text contains themes embodying the theme of filial loyalty, and as\nin the Analects, such loyalty takes precedence over public\njustice. 7A35 tells a story about the sage-emperor Shun that\nillustrates this theme. Because Shun was renowned for his filiality,\nMencius is asked what Shun would have done if his father killed a man.\nMencius replies that Shun could not stop the judge from apprehending\nhis father because the judge had the legal authority to act. But then,\nMencius says, Shun would have abdicated and fled with his father to\nthe edge of the sea. 5A2 and 5A3 describe the way that Shun dealt with\nhis half-brother Xiang\u2019s conspiring with his father and\nstepmother to kill him. He enfeoffed Xiang because all he could do as\na brother is to love him. At the same time, Shun appointed officials\nto administer the fief and to collect taxes and tributes, to protect\nthe people of Youbi from Xiang\u2019s potentially abusive ruling.\nThat is why some called Shun\u2019s act a banishment of Xiang.\nHowever, the Shun stories exhibit a complexity that differentiates\nthem from the story of the sheep-stealing coverup in the\nAnalects. Though filial loyalty is clearly given a priority\nin each story, there is in Shun\u2019s actions an acknowledgment of\nthe other value that comes into conflict with filial loyalty. Though\nShun ultimately gives priority to filial loyalty in the case of his\nfather, his first action acknowledges the value of public justice by\ndeclining to interfere with the judge while he is king. While Shun\ndeclines to punish his half-brother, he protects the people of\nXiang\u2019s new fiefdom.\n\nThese Shun stories illustrate that an agent\u2019s response to a\nsituation in which important values come into conflict need not be a\nstrict choice between honoring one value and wholly denying the other.\nWhile some sort of priority might have to be set in the end, there are\nalso ways to acknowledge the value that is subordinated, but how\nexactly that is to be done seems very much a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation at hand. The Shun stories are an expression of\nthe Confucian theme that rightness cannot be judged on the basis of\nexceptionless general principles but a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation. It is difficult to see how this theme can be\ntaught except by the way it is done in the Mencius: through\nexemplars of how it is done, and where the situation is presented\nthrough some kind of narrative.\n\nThe characteristic form of reasoning in Mencius is analogical\nreasoning (see Lau, 1970b; Wong, 2002). Starting from what seems true\nin one case and \u201cextending\u201d similar conclusions to another\ncase that has similar conclusions. The trick in doing analogical\nreasoning correctly, as suggested earlier, is to extend the similar\nconclusions only when the two cases share ethically relevant and\ndecisive features. The Mencius 4A17 shows a similar concern\nfor treating like cases alike. Mencius grants that to save the life of\none\u2019s drowning sister-in-law, one of course suspends the\ncustomary rule of propriety prohibiting the touching of man and woman\nwhen they are giving and receiving. Another philosopher proposes to\napply this idea of suspending the usual rules of propriety to save\nsomething else from drowning\u2014the entire Empire! Mencius replies\nthat one saves one\u2019s sister-in-law with one\u2019s hand but\ncannot save the Empire from drowning in chaos and corruption with\none\u2019s hand. The Empire can only be pulled out by the Way.\nMencius is rejecting the analogy between compromising on ritual\npropriety to save the country and compromising on propriety to save\none\u2019s sister-in-law. There is a relevant dissimilarity between\nthe case of the drowning sister-in-law and saving the country: one\ncannot save the Empire through compromises of ritual propriety, but\ninstead by following the Way, which itself involves following ritual\npropriety.\n\nSo what do we do when we confront a problematic case in the present\nand we do not automatically know what the right thing to do is?\nMencius believes we can rely on past cases in which we have made\nreliable judgments about, for example, what is right and shameful.\nThese reliable judgments made in past cases serve as paradigms or\nexemplars of correct ethical judgment. In encountering new\nproblem situations, we determine what sort of ethical reaction to the\nnew situation is correct by asking which of the cases in which\nwe\u2019ve had paradigm judgments are relevantly similar. We then\ndetermine what reactions to the new situations would be sufficiently\nsimilar to the relevant paradigm judgments. Analogical reasoning is\ncareful attention and comparing to a concrete paradigm. The\npool of paradigm ethical judgments we have not only includes cases\nfrom our own personal experience, but also include the experience of\nothers, especially those who serve as models of wise judgment. The\nstories of sage-king Shun in the Mencius text seem to give us\nsuch paradigms. Shun\u2019s judgments on what to do about conflicts\nbetween filial loyalty and public justice are perhaps meant to serve\nas paradigm judgments. The conception of moral reasoning found in the\nMencius offers important material for reflection on the\nprocess of moral judgment, especially for those who have come to\nreject the simple model of judgment as deduction from premises\nincluding a general moral principle and a description of the\nconditions that make the principle applicable to the situation at\nhand. The Mencian picture includes general moral considerations or\nvalues that bear on the situation at hand, such as the importance of\nfamily loyalty and public justice, but the picture also suggests that\njudgment in difficult situations includes finding a way to adequately\nrecognize and realize the values in play. \u201cFinding a way\u201d\nseems much more a matter of imagination and ingenuity rather than\ndeduction, but the Mencian picture also suggests that we can be guided\nby exemplars of wise judgment. Identifying the relevant similarities\nand dissimilarities between these exemplars and one\u2019s present\nsituation seems a matter of perception and close attention rather than\ndeduction from principle.\n2.6 Xunzi versus Mencius on human nature and the origins of morality\n\nIn the Xing E (\u201c[Human] Nature is Bad\u201d) chapter\n(see Hutton 2014 for a translation), Xunzi explicitly opposes his\nposition on human nature to Mencius\u2019s. He asserts that far from\nbeing good, human nature is bad because it includes a love of profit,\nenvy and hatred, and desires of the eyes and ears that lead to\nviolence and anarchy. To avoid these consequences of indulging our\nspontaneous desires and impulses, it takes wei (conscious\nactivity or deliberate effort), models and teaching, and guidance\nthrough observing ritual and yi (standards of righteousness).\nThrough such efforts, natural emotions and desires are transformed as\na crooked piece of wood is steamed and then straightened upon a press\nframe. All rituals and standards of righteousness are sheng\n(generated, produced) by the sages. These are generated from the\nconscious activity of the sages and not from their original nature.\nJust as the vessel made by a potter is generated from his conscious\nactivity and not his original nature, so the sages accumulated their\nthoughts and ideas and made a practice of conscious activity and\nprecedents, thereby generating rituals and standards of\nrighteousness.\n\nPart of Xunzi\u2019s argument against Mencius is that human nature is\nnot what is produced by conscious activity but rather that which is\nalready there in human beings independently of conscious activity.\nSince it is clear that human beings are not already good but must work\nat it, it is clear that human nature cannot be good. When Mencius\nexpresses the water-metaphor view of the human inclination toward\ngoodness, Xunzi\u2019s criticism has a point. Becoming good does not\nseem to be merely a matter of not interfering with what will unfold in\nnormal circumstances. However, when Mencius expresses the\nsprout-metaphor view, the differences between him and Xunzi are more\nsubtle. On the sprout-metaphor view, effort and reflection must be put\ninto the project of extending the sprouts to where they should be. It\nmight be thought that one of the real differences between Mencius and\nXunzi is that the former believes the necessary effort lies in growing\nor extending what lies in human nature, whereas the latter believes\nthat the effort lies in remaking and reshaping what lies in human\nnature. Perhaps one believes that we can go \u201cwith the\ngrain\u201d of what we are born with, and the other believes we must\ngo \u201cagainst the grain.\u201d\n\nEach thinker emphasizes one of these opposing directions, but\nit is a credit to the subtlety and power of their views that each also\ntakes into account the direction that the other emphasizes. Mencius\nacknowledges that moral development is hindered when a person pays\nmore attention to the \u201csmall\u201d parts of the self that\ninclude desires for sensual and material satisfaction and fails to use\nthe heart-mind to reflect on the great parts that have normative\npriority. In the chapter on rituals, Xunzi identifies natural and\npowerful emotional dispositions such as love of one\u2019s own kind\nthat rituals must give expression to and that seem to form more of a\npositive basis for moral development. Such natural love is expressed\nin love for parents and intense grief upon their deaths, which must be\ngiven appropriate expression in mourning and burial rituals. Thus\nMencius acknowledges that there are natural parts of the self that\nmust be disciplined and held in check while Xunzi acknowledges that\nthere are natural parts that are largely congenial to morality in the\nsense that they are the natural basis for taking great satisfaction\nand contentment in virtue once one has gotten the self-aggrandizing\ndesires and emotions under control.\n\nAnother disagreement between Mencius and Xunzi has to do with\nMencius\u2019 claim that human nature contains moral predispositions.\nAs indicated earlier, such Mencian predispositions appear to contain\nmoral intuitions (e.g., about what is shameful and right or wrong). On\none plausible interpretation of Mencius, morality is part of the order\nimparted to the world by tian or heaven. By contrast, Xunzi\nseems to rule out the existence of natural predispositions with moral\ncontent when he claims that the sage kings generated ritual principles\nand precepts of moral duty. One natural interpretation of\n\u201cgenerated\u201d is \u201ccreated\u201d or\n\u201cinvented.\u201d On these interpretations of each thinker, the\ncontrast between Mencius and Xunzi exemplifies the contrast between a\nrobust moral realism that has moral properties such as rightness\nexisting independently of human invention and a constructivist\nposition that makes moral properties dependent on human invention.\n\nThe interpretation of Xunzi as a constructivist does not commit\nhim to a denial of the objectivity of morality or to the denial that\nthere is a single objectively correct morality. It is possible to see\nXunzi as a constructivist about morality but also as an objectivist\n(see Nivison, 1991). On the constructivist interpretation, Xunzi holds\na functional conception of morality, according to which it is invented\nto harmonize the interests of individuals and to constrain and\ntransform the heedless pursuit of short-term gratification for the\nsake of promoting the long-term interests of the individual and the\ngroup. Ritual principles and moral precepts are invented to accomplish\nsuch a function, and human nature constrains which of the possible\nprinciples and precepts are better or worse for accomplishing that\nfunction. Xunzi\u2019s point about the mourning rituals prescribed by\nConfucians being suited to the nature of human love for one\u2019s\nparents is a case in point.\n\nXunzi\u2019s functional theory of morality bears added interest for\nthose exploring the possibilities of a naturalistic approach to\nmorality. One fairly common interpretation of Xunzi\u2019s conception\nof tian or heaven is that it is an order-giving force in the\ncosmos that is neutral to whatever human beings have come to regard as\nright and good. In fact, a translation that better conveys such a\nmeaning for \u2018tian\u2019 is \u201cnature,\u201d which\nis the translation given by Knoblock\u2019s valued translation of the\nXunzi. Textual passages that support this interpretation\nstress that tian operates according to patterns that remain\nconstant no matter what human beings do or whether they appeal to it\nfor good fortune (chapter 17). It is the proper task of human beings\nto understand what these patterns are in order to take advantage of\nthem (e.g., so that they may know to plow in the spring, weed in the\nsummer, harvest in the fall, and store in the winter).\n\nSuch a view of the difference between Xunzi and Mencius, however,\ndepends on interpretations that been disputed in favor of alternative\ninterpretations. Roger Ames (1991, 2002) defends an interpretation of\nMencius that gives the greatest role in shaping the direction of moral\ndevelopment to human \u201ccreative social intelligence\u201d rather\nthan tian conceived as a force operating independently of\nhuman beings. For a contrasting view, see Irene Bloom (1994, 1997,\n2002), who, sometimes in response to Ames, defends a greater role for\nbiology in her interpretation of Mencius while also leaving an\nimportant role for culture. The Xunzi text is also\nsusceptible to very different interpretations, partly because of the\noriginality of its synthesis of several streams of thought:\nConfucianism, Daoism, Mohism, and the Jixia Academy. When Xunzi\nasserts that tian is unresponsive to human supplication and\nritual sacrifice, it looks as if he might be drawing from Daoism (see\nbelow), but when he refers to the tian-given faculties human\nbeings should exercise to solve the problem of conflict, he might be\ninterpreted as implying that tian conferred these faculties\nupon human beings for the purpose of solving the problem of\nconflict and realizing fulfilling human lives together (see Eno 1990;\nand Machle, 1993 for an exploration of the rich interpretive\npossibilities regarding Xunzi\u2019s conception of tian).\nWhile it might still be possible to interpret Xunzi as a\nconstructivist on the origin of morality, this alternative\ninterpretation might suggest that Xunzi\u2019s tian had a\nblueprint it intended human beings to fulfill. Under alternative\ninterpretations of Mencius and Xunzi, then, the differences do not\ndisappear, but they might form even more subtle contrasts (Wong,\n2016).\n\nEven some of the theoretical difficulties that Xunzi has are\ninstructive. In pressing his case against Mencius for the badness of\nhuman nature, he stresses the self-serving drives of human nature.\nUnlike Hobbes, he does not accept that human beings are inevitably\nmotivated by self-interest, and he does not try to base adherence to\nmoral norms on the basis of self-interest alone. This arguably is a\npromising move, given the heavy criticism that can be directed against\nthe Hobbesian project and subsequent attempts to carry it out its\nbasic idea (see Gauthier, 1986 for such an attempt; see Vallentyne,\n1991 for criticism). Xunzi rather argues that the problems created by\nunrestrained self-interest point to the need to transform human\nmotivation. People can come to love moral virtue and the rites for\ntheir own sakes, and this is necessary, on Xunzi\u2019s view, for a\nstable solution to the problem of conflict between self-interested\nindividuals. At times, Xunzi suggests that the intellect can override\nthe desires arising from the natural emotions, but it remains unclear\nas to how self-regarding motivations can become a love of virtue and\nthe rites simply because the intellect approves of them. The parts of\nXunzi asserting a more complex picture of human motivation suggest a\nsolution. If human beings are capable of genuine compassion and\nconcern for others, as the chapter on rites suggests, then the ritual\nprinciples and moral precepts invented by the sage kings have some\nmotivational leverage for the birth of a love of virtue and rites.\nSuch a solution draws from what are arguably some of the most\nplausible positions of Mencius: that human beings are capable of\naltruism and compassion even if they are motivated much of the time by\nself-interest; and that moral transformation is a matter of\ncultivating and extending a motivational substance that is congenial\nto morality (see Wong, 2000).\n\nMencius and Xunzi, then, offer sophisticated theories that expand the\nrange of possible ways of understanding moral knowledge, motivation,\nand the nature of morality itself. Mencius presents an interesting\nconception of the way that we reason by analogy from intuitive\njudgments and also a plausible conception of innate predispositions\nthat are compatible with a major role for learning and upbringing in\nthe development of character and virtue. Those who are more\nnaturalistically inclined in their approach to morality (at least\ninsofar as this involves resisting the idea of a transcendent source\nof moral properties) may find the interpretation of Xunzi as offering\na functional conception of morality appealing, especially if it allows\nfor a degree of objectivity regarding the content of morality.\n2.7 Confucianism and the situationist problem for virtue ethics\n\nIn recent years, Gilbert Harman (1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000) and\nJohn Doris (2002) have pointed to the influence of situations over\nattitude and behavior as a problem for virtue ethics. Citing empirical\nwork in social psychology, Harman and Doris claim that the extensive\nand surprising influence of situational factors undermines the\ncommonsense idea that people possess stable character traits that\nexplain what they do. Some of the classic psychological studies used\nin this argument appear to show that ordinary respectable American\ncitizens will administer dangerous electrical shocks to an innocent\nperson when urged to do so by an experimenter in a lab coat (Milgram\n1974), and that being late for an appointment is the most influential\nfactor in whether a seminary student will stop and help someone who\nseems to be falling ill, even if the appointment is to attend a\nlecture on the Good Samaritan (Darley and Batson 1973). Such studies\npose a problem not only for the commonsense conception of character\ntraits, but also for virtue ethics, which appear to assume the\npossibility of achieving stable character traits that are virtues.\nPerhaps human beings are inevitably creatures who are influenced by\nthe situation in which they act and not by any characterlogical\ndispositions they bring with them to the situation. If so, it appears\nthat the ideal of attaining virtues is misguided.\n\nThere are good reasons to expect Confucianism to offer some\ndistinctive resources for dealing with this problem. First, as pointed\nout in 2.3, Confucians appreciate the relational nature of human life:\nwho we are as persons very much includes our social context: the\npeople with whom we are in relationship and our institutions and\npractices. So they are very much in a position to appreciate\nsituational influences on how human beings think, feel, and act.\nSecond, they appear to hold something like a conception of virtues as\nstable character traits that are resistant to undue situational\ninfluences. As noted in 2.3, and this pertains to the challenge posed\nby the Milgram study, the Confucians emphasize the importance of\nliving according to one\u2019s own understanding of what is right and\ngood even if others do not see it the same way. Third, as noted at the\nbeginning of this entry, Chinese philosophy in general is\ndistinguished by a focus on the practical. This is illustrated in the\nConfucian case by the tradition of scholar-officials who not only\nwrote about and taught the importance of the ethical to the political\nlife, but strove to enact this importance in their own careers. As a\nconsequence, they were very much concerned with specifying in\npractical terms how one could go about cultivating the virtues in\noneself. Fourth, and this is very much in response to the combination\nof the previous points, they describe a long and arduous program of\nethical training to inculcate the virtues.\n\nAs Edward Slingerland (2011) has put it, Confucianism is in a good\nposition to appreciate the \u201chigh bar\u201d challenge of\nsituational influence to the project of cultivating the virtues in\noneself and others. In response to this challenge, their program of\nethical training includes study of the classics (after the ancient\nperiod, the classics came to include, of course, the Analects\nand the Mencius), memorized and rehearsed until they become\nfully internalized and embedded in the unconscious patterns of thought\nthat are so powerful in shaping what we do in everyday life (see\nSlingerland 2009). This is one characteristic pattern of Confucian\nself-cultivation: one consciously, deliberately and assiduously\nundertakes a program that inculcates dispositions to have ethically\nappropriate emotional responses and patterns of conduct. The intent is\nto make the dispositions for these responses reliable and resistant to\nundue situational influence.\n\nFurthermore, the Confucians very much appreciated the power of models\nto inspire, to make one want to transcend one\u2019s present self\n(see Tan, 2005 and Olberding, 2008, 2012, 2016). The psychologist\nJonathan Haidt (2003) has given empirical evidence for an emotion he\ncalls \u201celevation,\u201d which is something like awe and\nadmiration upon contemplating the morally admirable. The\nAnalects, in fact, has been read as a record of how a group\nof men gathered around a teacher with the power to elevate, and as a\nrecord of how this group created a culture in which goals of\nself-transformation were treated as collaborative projects. These\npeople not only discussed the nature of self-cultivation but enacted\nit as a relational process in which they supported one another,\nreinforced their common goals, and served as checks on each other in\ncase they went off the path, the dao. They were each\nother\u2019s situational influences. See Sarkissian, 2010 for the\nargument that Confucius shows how one can turn the power of situations\non people\u2019s attitudes and behavior toward positive ends; if\nsituations can influence people, one can through small details of\ncomportment and attitude be a situational influence on others that\ntilts things toward a better course.\n\nTraining in ritual, li, takes on another dimension of\nimportance in light of the situationist problem. As noted in section\n2.2 Confucian rituals help to express attitudes of respect and\nreverence for others that can exist independently of the rituals\nthemselves, but rituals provide conventionally established, symbolic\nways to express these attitudes toward others. Ritual forms,\ntherefore, give participants manifold and (just as importantly)\nregularly recurring ways to act on and therefore to strengthen the\nright attitudes and behavioral dispositions. Given the renewed\nappreciation in contemporary psychology for the power of emotions to\ninfluence attitude and behavior, the resource offered by ritual\ntraining should not be ignored by anyone concerned about the problem\nof how to resist undue situational influence.\n\nFinally, Confucianism points to the possibility that individuals,\nunder the right circumstances and encouragement, can enhance their\nreflective control of their own emotions and impulses. Mencius\u2019\nconversation with King Xuan can be conceived as an attempt to get the\nking to nourish his moral sprouts by reflecting on them, to become\naware of what his moral emotions are (such as compassion) and to take\naction to grow them. It should be noted that contemporary psychology\nis exploring the factors that work into the development of\nself-control of one\u2019s emotions and impulses (e.g., chapter 3 in\nBelsky et al., 2022). See Lieberman (2011) and Creswell (2007) for\nstudies indicating that meditation focused on cultivating compassion\nin oneself can be effective through enhancing one\u2019s ability to\nidentify and gain better control of one\u2019s emotions.\n\nFinally, in considering why robust character traits that could qualify\nas virtues are so rare, we should consider the perspective that very\nmuch informs the self-cultivation projects of Confucius and his\nstudents. They were very much aware of the lack of virtue as a social\nand political condition and not merely as an individual condition that\njust happened to be widespread (Hutton 2006 makes this point). There\nis a reason why Confucius and Mencius after him sought to have kings\nadopt their teachings. If in fact the achievement of robust virtues\nrequires long and hard training, supported and guided by others who\nhave taken similar paths before, and if as Mencius 1A7 holds, people\ncannot engage in such training until they have the material security\nthat enables them to take their minds off the sheer task of survival,\nthen it is no mystery at all why there are no such traits in societies\nstructured to achieve very different goals. Ironically, the\nsituationist psychological experiments do not take into account this\nunderlying relational factor that might deeply influence the ability\nof people to form robust virtues, and neither do the philosophical\ncritics of virtue ethics who rely on the situationist experimental\nevidence.\n2.8 Responsibility and agency in Confucian ethics\n\nIn many respects, the ethics associated with the canonical figures of\nConfucius, Mencius, and Xunzi is about the way people should respond\nto one another, and in this sense it is a paradigmatic ethic of\nresponsibility. Confucian ethics exemplifies, along with most other\nethics, the idea that we must be responsive to, held responsible for,\nthat which makes us morally valuable.  Confucian virtues\nof ren, yi, li, and filiality are conceived\nto make their possessor trustworthy and reliable responders to the\nneeds, welfare, and dignity of others. The centrality that Confucian\nethics accords to relationship in what is valuable in human life\nresults in some distinctive features of its conception of\nresponsibility. A supreme degree of responsiveness to the needs and\nsuffering of people is required of exemplary officials. In Mencius\n4B29, Yu, legendary for working tirelessly to control the flooding of\nthe great rivers of China and who later became King, is described as\nregarded those drowning as if he had drowned them himself. Ji, who\nbore his official responsibilities in a time of famine, regarded those\nstarving as if he had starved them himself.  Xunzi says\nthat Tian gave birth to the people not for the sake of their\nlords, but established the lords for the sake of the people (chapter\n27). \n\nThe authority of rulers rests on their being given the responsibility\nfor bringing about the conditions under which their people can live\nfulfilling lives and develop their virtue. Recall Mencius\u2019 declaration\nto King Xuan that if the people do not have a constant means of\nlivelihood, they will not have the constant minds to set themselves on\ndeveloping their virtue, and fall into crime (1A7). If a king allows\nsuch circumstances to afflict his people, if his people commit crimes\nto feed themselves and their families, and if the king punishes them,\nhe will have entrapped them. Mencius\u2019 declaration, then, amounts to\ndistributing a great share of the responsibility for the people\u2019s\ncrimes to their king.\n\nMencius goes on to propose concrete policies to the king to avoid\nentrapping the people: not overtaxing them to fund aggressive wars\nagainst neighboring states, prohibiting close-mesh fishing nets so as\nnot to catch young fish and turtles, limiting the harvesting of trees\nto certain seasons, and planting mulberry trees so that the people\nwill have silk clothing to wear (1A3, 1A7). Such policies make for\nsufficiently fertile soil from which his people\u2019s duan might\ngrow. Mencius might here be construed as invoking what has been called\n\u201ccircumstantial luck\u201d by Thomas Nagel in his classic \u201cMoral Luck\u201d\nessay (1976). While we do have control over some of our circumstances,\nwe have none or very little control over other circumstances that\ngreatly affect what can we make of ourselves. This is the source of\nNagel\u2019s intuition that an arbitrariness of evaluation infects our\njudgments of what we tend to hold people to answer for.  Some of\nus have very unfavorable circumstances in which we choose, yet others\nwith more favorable circumstances get more credit for their choices.\nInterestingly, the only exception Mengzi makes to the rule that those\nwithout a constant means will be unable to have a constant mind is the\nclass of shi \u58eb, the gentry-scholar class of which\nMengzi himself was a member. In an era of great political turbulence\nand disintegrating social order, members of this class were dislodged\nfrom their comfortable niches in the lower aristocracy, but their\nknowledge of traditions made them valuable to competing warlord-kings\nwho wished to replicate the glory of the old kings. This distinct set\nof circumstances for the shi made genteel poverty and itinerancy more\nfavorable, or at least less adverse, circumstances for maintaining a\nconstant mind than others lower in the social order.\n\nPeople normally have responsibility to refrain from crime, which\ninvolves their responsibility to respond to the needs of their\npotential victims, but that responsibility can be mitigated by the\nlack of control they have to avoid severe suffering if they refrain\nfrom crime. Their responsibility is mitigated by the way desperation\nfocuses the mind on self and those for whom one cares the most. When\ngovernments fail to realize the material conditions under which their\npeople could devote adequate attention to the development of their\nvirtue, they share a great deal of the responsibility for the\nwrongdoing and harm that results.\n\nThough Xunzi has a very different theory of what happens in the\ncultivation of virtue, he too believes that helping individuals to\nbecome competent moral agents is a collective task.\nHe recounts a story that occurred when Confucius was Minister of\nJustice. A father and son had become embroiled in a legal\ndispute. Kongzi detained them both but ultimately releases both. When\nquestioned as to why he let the son go when he should have been\npunished for being unfilial, Kongzi questions the permissibility\nof killing subordinates when their superiors are at fault: to\nfail to teach the people and then judge their crimes is to kill the\ninnocent; to fail to teach the people and yet hold them responsible\nfor achieving meritorious works is being cruel; it is only when one\nstops these practices that it is permissible to apply\npunishments (chapter 28, see translation by Hutton 2014: 319).\nHowever, if the material conditions sufficient for the focusing\nof one\u2019s attention on moral virtue are present, and if others capable\nof pointing the way toward learning are available to be followed, then\nit is up to the individual to put in the effort (see Mencius 6A9 and\nJiang 2002). \n\nLack of control over the conditions under which one becomes a\nresponsible moral agent, as discussed above, can result in mitigation\nof personal responsibility. However, it is also possible to become\nresponsible for what is not under one\u2019s control. This can happen\nbecause others who commit a moral wrong stand in special relationship\nto oneself. In addition, such others can enter so deeply into\none\u2019s identity that one cannot repudiate what they do without\ndisowning part of the self. In the text Kongzi Jiayu\n(\u5b54\u5b50\u5bb6\u8a9e The School Sayings of\nConfucius, 37.4 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources), a story is told\nof the time Kongzi refrains from denouncing the unseemly conduct of an\nold friend and does not distance himself from it or his friend. In\nexplaining this, Kongzi says that family members never lose that which\nmakes them family and old friends never lose that which makes them old\nfriends. Deep and lasting friendship can make us partly responsible\nfor the misconduct of our friends (see Ing 2017 for an illuminating\ndiscussion of this passage).\n\nSuch consequences for the allotment of responsibility stem from the\nmoral centrality given to relationship in Confucian ethics, but are\nnot peculiar to Confucian ethics. Margaret Urban Walker (1993) has\nobserved that moral agents who accept responsibility for circumstances\nbeyond their control and who therefore \u201crecognize their vulnerability\nto fortune are primed for dependability of humanly invaluable sorts\u201d\nand \u201cwon\u2019t fail us even under the blows of bad fortune or odd turns of\nfate which might otherwise prompt denial or opportunism\u201d (1993,\n25\u201326).\n\nAgency, then, can be distributed among a larger group of people and is\nnot limited to the agent who directly chooses the action in question;\nit is distributed among those who can some significant degree of\ncontrol over the conditions under which the direct agent chooses.\nOthers can share responsibility through having a relevant relationship\nto the direct agent. A significant degree of responsibility is\nretained by the direct agent, however, especially if the conditions\n(such as a constant means of livelihood and the presence of reliable\nteachers and models) favorable to the development of agency are\npresent. Then responsibility is conceived to rest on the individual to\nexercise their heart-mind. In Mencius\u2019 case, the individual needs to\nexercise the heart-mind\u2019s capacity to think about the importance of\ndeveloping the moral duan within; in Xunzi\u2019s case,\nthe individual needs to reflect on what qualities of character and\nwhat kinds of cooperative relationships with others would provide\nthe greatest, and most stable satisfaction of desire. In each case,\nthere is an internal normative hierarchywithin the person that should\nbe established, with the heart-mind as the leader or commander of the\nrest of the person. The heart-mind directs how the person should\ncultivate the self and conduct itself in relation to others. This\nhierarchy corresponds to the meritocratic order that Confucians\nbelieve should obtain in state and society: the most virtuous and\nmost able (those who have developed their heart-minds the most) should\nhave the most authority to govern. We shall see how\nthe Zhuangzi (section 4.2) in particular poses a\nstriking critique of both forms of hierarchy.\n2.9 Neo-Confucian theories of morality and their grounding in a cosmology\n\nZhu Xi (1130\u20131200) reinterpreted ethical themes inherited from\nthe classical thinkers and grounded them in a cosmology and\nmetaphysics that had absorbed the influence of Buddhism, particularly\nas it transformed in its interaction with Daoism when entering China\n(see the chapters on Zhu Xi and Wang Yang Ming in Ivanhoe, 1993 for\nthe neo-Confucian reaction Buddhism and Daoism). Zhu established the\nConfucian canon that served as a basis for the Chinese public service\nexamination, including the Analects and Mencius,\nalong with the Great Learning (Da Xue) and\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhong Yong). In fact, he had\nhis greatest influence through the commentaries he wrote on these\ntexts (see Gardner, 2003 for a discussion of the influence of Zhu\nXi\u2019s reading of the Analects). Zhu affirmed the Mencian\ntheme that human nature is good, with greater emphasis on that vein of\nthought in the Mencius that stresses that goodness is\ninternal to human beings and will develop in the absence of\ninterference. This reading of Mencius is unsurprising given the\ninfluence of Buddhism on the Neo-Confucians, and it meant the demotion\nof Xunzi within the influential Neo-Confucian reading of the\ntradition. Much of Zhu\u2019s metaphysics centers on the relation\nbetween li \u7406 (not li \u79ae as\nritual but as principle or pattern or the fit and coherence between\nthings) and qi (the material force or energy stuff from which\nobjects emerge and return at the end of their existence). How Zhu Xi\nconceived this relation is a matter of interpretive debate. Some view\nhim as holding a dualistic metaphysics in analogy to the way that\nPlato\u2019s distinction between the Forms and the sensible world is\noften taken to embody a metaphysical dualism (Fung, 1948, chapter 25).\nHowever, others interpret Zhu\u2019s li not as ontologically\nprior to qi but rather as being a pattern or deep structure\nthat is immanent within and expressed by qi and delineates\nthe range and possibilities of qi\u2019s transformations\n(Graham, 1986; Thompson, 1988; Angle and Tiwald, 2017; Liu, 2018).\nOthers have noted that li appears to have both subjective and\nobjective aspects: it lays down the lines along which everything moves\nin a way that is independent of personal desires; but on the other\nhand, it is related to the pattern of one\u2019s profoundest\nresponses to things (see Angle, 2009, for an attempt to reconcile\nthese aspects). With regard to qi, Zhu Xi held that even\nthough goodness is within human nature, individuals differed with\nrespect to their native endowment of energy stuff, and that this,\ntogether with differences in their family and social circumstances,\naffected the development of their good natures (Angle and Tiwald,\n2017; Liu, 2018).\n\nZhu Xi saw one\u2019s self-cultivation as a matter of apprehending\nthe li of one\u2019s own mind, largely through meditation\npractice, and, at the same time, investigating the li or\npatterns of things not only as revealed in texts such as the\nAnalects but as embodied in concrete situations, including\nthe patterns in relationships between persons. Both kinds of\nactivities must be conducted with jing, which in Zhu\u2019s\nthought means respectful attention. Zhu is sometimes characterized as\na kind of scholastic, but he emphasized study of the texts in\nconjunction with acting, with observing li as principle,\npattern, or coherence in external situations and relationships, and\nrealizing the correspondence between the li of one\u2019s\nown mind and the li of texts and of situations and\nrelationships. Apprehending li in a concrete situation in\norder to respond appropriately to it was not a simple matter of\nabsorbing generalizations from texts and applying it to the situation,\nbut rather a matter of bringing to bear a mind that has been\ncultivated by meditation and by study of the texts and by observing\nand acting in previous situations. Such a mind can take into account\nrelevant ethical considerations and is disciplined in attending to the\nsituation (see the chapter on Zhu Xi in Ivanhoe, 1993; and Gardner,\n1990).\n\nThe other Neo-Confucian whose influence rivals that of Zhu Xi is Wang\nYang Ming (1472\u20131529). Wang saw Zhu\u2019s emphasis on the\ninvestigation of patterns in external things as overly scholastic and\nleading to abstract speculation rather than practical guidance. He\nrejected what he saw to be the intellectualization of personal\nrealization, and identified the mind with li. This means that\nthe dispositions to judge properly the appropriate action in various\nsituations constitute the mind\u2019s original pure state.\nLi is not to be sought as a pattern residing in an\nindependently existing external world but is embodied in judgments of\nthe mind. This seems to commit Wang to an identification of the world\nwith the experienced world and to a denial of a mind-independent\nworld, but an alternative interpretation is that the structure of the\nworld is mind-dependent while the world itself is not (Liu, 2018).\nWang\u2019s version of the Mencian theme that human nature is good is\neven more innatist than Zhu Xi\u2019s (see Ivanhoe, 1990, for a\ncomparison of Mencius and Wang Yang Ming). Original goodness does not\nneed completion through learning about the external world. Then why\naren\u2019t all people fully good? Why are some very bad?\nWang\u2019s answer is that selfish desires cloud the sun of the\ncomplete and perfect moral mind, and that the task of human beings is\nto eliminate selfish desires and recover that mind (Chan, 1963,\nsections 21, 62).\n\nOne of Wang\u2019s better-known themes is the unity of knowledge and\naction. There can be no gap between knowing what to do and doing it.\nGenuine knowledge is necessarily practical. Selfish desires and\nemotions get in the way of achieving genuine knowledge. One way of\nunderstanding this identification is to take knowledge as a knowing\nhow to act that is expressed in acting. One expresses one\u2019s\nknowing how to ride a bicycle by riding, not by articulating\npropositions about how to ride a bicycle that one might not be able to\nact upon. Furthermore, knowledge is particularist and\ncontext-sensitive in nature and is expressed in intuitive reactions to\nthe present moment. Knowing how to ride a bicycle is continually\nreacting by shifting one\u2019s body first this way and then that way\nto the changing center of gravity of one\u2019s body in tandem with\nthe bicycle. The moral life, on Wang\u2019s view, is like that rather\nthan applying a static set of generalizations one learns before\nencountering the situations in which one needs to act. Notice also\nthat the kinesthetic sensations blend seamlessly with the bodily\nresponses to those sensations that help one to go forward and keep\none\u2019s balance on a bicycle. In genuine moral knowledge,\nperception of the situation at hand blends seamlessly with the right\nresponse to it.\n\nIn emphasizing that the ultimate ideal is a kind of spontaneous and\nintuitive perceiving of the situation and the right response to it,\nWang Yang Ming joins with Zhu Xi. However, this does not mean that\nthere were not important dissenting voices. Dai Zhen defended an\nethical ideal in which deliberative reflection on the right thing to\ndo continues to play an important role and not just at stages in which\none is a considerable distance from realizing the ideal. Dai\nparticularly emphasizes the necessity for imagining the effects of\none\u2019s actions on others, which might help one better share their\nsorrows and joys. Whereas Zhu equated spontaneous and non-conscious\nidentification with others as a reflection of the wholeheartedness of\none\u2019s motivations, Dai counters that needing to deliberate over\nthe right thing to do is compatible with a wholehearted acting on\none\u2019s judgment when one arrives at it. Dai is inclined to give\ndesires for the self a legitimate place in ethical reflection because\nhe holds that one\u2019s valuing of relationships can be strengthened\nwhen one understands that the other\u2019s flourishing is tied up\nwith one\u2019s own (see Tiwald 2010, 2011a, 2011b).\n2.10 Confucianism and gender\n\nMany contemporary philosophers who have seriously undertaken the study\nof Confucian ethics have concluded that it remains a\n\u201clive\u201d philosophy with insights of continuing relevance. A\nfull defense of this claim requires not only identifying what is\nvaluable in Confucian ethics but also addressing moral evils and\nliabilities that have long been associated with it (the same should be\nsaid of Aristotle and his views of women and slaves, or Kant, and his\nviews of women or people of African descent). For example, Confucian\nethics might be seen as providing a needed emphasis on the central\nvalue of relationship in most, if not all, human lives that are worth\nliving. In response to the Socratic claim that the unexamined life is\nnot worth living, the Confucian might be on at least equal footing in\nsaying that an isolated life is not worth living. Yet the Confucian is\nalso required to examine what sorts of relationships should have this\nhigh status. Does Confucianism require family relationships that are\npatriarchal, with the husband and father exercising authority over\nwife and children in ways that would inevitably offend values of\nequality and autonomy?\n\nA recurring theme in the more recent literature on this subject is\nthat views of women in the early period of Confucianism were\nrelatively positive compared to the views adopted later. Raphals\n(1998) has extracted from the literature of the Warring States Period\n(during which Confucius lived) and the later Han Dynasty portraits of\nwomen who were active and sometimes very effective participants in\ntheir societies. For example, the \u201cCollected Life Stories of\nWomen\u201d (Lienu zhuan) depicts women as having the same\nintellectual virtues as men, providing strategy and counsel to their\nrulers, husbands, fathers and sons, excelling in logic and argument,\nand presenting sagely wisdom. Nylan reads classical Chinese texts as\ntalking \u201cwith almost stunning clarity of the power for good and\nevil that women bring to politics\u201d (2000, 212), and she\nconcludes that \u201c[o]ur stereotypes of ancient China do not come\nso much from \u2026 [these texts] as from relatively recent sources,\nthe Neo-Confucians and the May Fourth reformers\u201d (2000, 213). At\nthe same time, it must be said that the powerful women of ancient\nChina were almost always excluded from official positions of power and\nauthority.\n\nSin Yee Chan (2000) presents a portrait consistent with Raphals\u2019\nand Nylan\u2019s from looking at the Analects and the\nMencius. It is assumed in those texts that the proper roles\nfor women lie in the inner, domestic sphere, and for men the outer,\npublic sphere. This distinction, argues Chan, is functional and\nconceived as obtaining between complementary roles, not between women\nand men conceived as inferior and superior. But the consignment of\nwomen to the inner sphere does exclude them from one of the most\ncentral aspirations of the junzi, which is to serve in public\noffice. It also excludes them from receiving the education that is a\npreparation for office. At the same time, there is no attempt to\njustify the exclusion of women from this aspiration, and no argument\ngiven in these texts that they possess lesser capabilities for\nachieving that aspiration, no conception of women as having inferior\ncapacities for the development of strategic intelligence, moral\nwisdom, or self-discipline.\n\nThe inference is to the possibility of a version of Confucian ethics\nthat fully acknowledges the capabilities of women to become\njunzi and that supports opportunities for them to achieve\nthat ideal. Some who are sympathetic to this line of development for\nConfucian ethics have argued for its significant affinities with some\nstrains of feminist thought. Consider ren in its meaning as\nthe particular virtue of care for others. Chenyang Li (1994) has\nargued that there are important similarities between this central\nConfucian virtue and the feminist ethic of care articulated by Carol\nGilligan (1982) and Nell Noddings (1984). Furthermore, both Confucian\nand feminist care ethics have conceptions of ethical reasoning that\nemphasize contextualized reasoning about moral problems rather than\ndeducing solutions top-down from high general principles. Li\nacknowledges the patriarchal form that Confucian ethics came to take\non, but stresses that in a contemporary dialogue between these two\nethics, each could have something to contribute to the other.\n\nRosenlee (2014; also see 2007) addresses a criticism of care ethics of\neither the Confucian or Western feminist sort that has come from some\nfeminist quarters, which is that care is a value pressed upon women so\nthat they might be subordinate helpmates to men. While she\nacknowledges that the value has functioned in this way, she questions\nwhether women should cease caring when \u201cvulnerability and\ninterdependency characterize human existence\u201d (2013, 318).\nShouldn\u2019t they rather insist that men share equitably the task\nof caring? Rosenlee defends the Confucian value of filiality or\nxiao as the root of moral character, starting the project of\ncaring with addressing the vulnerability of the child, then through\nthe stages where a child reciprocates care for parents, and getting\nextended beyond the family.\n\nKupperman (2000) holds that Confucian ethics could benefit from\nadopting the feminist recognition that many social roles and the\nrituals that support them need to be reformed and perhaps re-invented\nin some cases, given the limiting and inhibiting effect they have on\nthe life projects women have chosen or could have chosen for\nthemselves (Meyers, 1989). He reads the classical Confucian texts as\nadopting a much more conservative and respectful attitude towards\ntraditional social roles and rituals, and while he has a degree of\nsympathy for this attitude (there can be good reasons why things are\nold enough to be traditional), he concludes that Confucian ethics, if\nit is to fully support opportunities for development of women\u2019s\ncapabilities, must prepare to be radicalized with respect to at least\nsome of the roles and rituals it has defended (see Neville 2017 for\nthe argument that Confucianism is up to the task of seeing the need\nfor new or radically revised rituals in this regard).\n\nThe issue of the Confucian orientation to tradition is itself a matter\nof contested interpretation. While the Confucian attitude is\nuncontroversially \u201cconservative\u201d in holding that there is\nmuch wisdom and guidance to be recovered from the past, some lean\ntoward the more extreme Mohist interpretation that Confucians accept\ntradition simply because it is tradition (e.g., Hansen, 1992), while\nothers view the Confucian attitude as a discerning and critical\nattitude toward tradition, citing passages such as Analects\n3.15 in which Confucius says that his own persistent questioning at\nthe Grand Temple is itself an act of li or proper observance\nof ritual (see Alan Chan, 2000). Further, and most importantly,\nConfucius was a pivotal figure in turning the meaning of\n\u201cjunzi\u201d from a person of noble blood to a person\nof moral nobility who could come from any background.\n\nTo retrieve one\u2019s cultural inheritance is itself a complex,\ncontested task, given the internal diversity of belief and practice\nthat is characteristic of any vibrant tradition. In her account of how\nChinese thinkers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\napproached the task of bringing to bear Western thought to the reform\nof their own society, Jenco (2015) points out that a crucial part of\ntheir task was to identify what their own cultural inheritance was,\nsuch that it could be brought into relation to a present and future\nthat involved possibly profound transformation. She points out that\n\u201cConfucius offered one of the earliest accounts of how an\norientation to a particular past could be both deliberate and\ntransformative rather than merely descriptive of an established\nidentity,\u201d and that his conception of the Zhou inheritance was\nbut \u201cone of many possible lineages created when the present was\nsutured to that particular past\u201d (Jenco, 2015, 57). Tan (2004,\n82) makes a similar point in claiming that the Confucian \u201clegacy\nis successfully transmitted only when the past is revitalized, so that\nit is embodied in the different experience of the present. Confucius\nconsiders one who \u201drevitalizes the old to realize the new\n(wengu er zhixin)\u201c worthy of being a teacher (Analects\n2.11).\u201d Those engaged in transforming Confucian ethics in\nrelation to women can view their task as a project of the kind Jenco\nand Tan are describing.\n2.11Confucianism and liberal democracy\n\nThe relationship between Confucian ethics and liberal democratic\nvalues has received vigorous and diverse discussion starting from the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century. This discussion has\ncentered on three kinds of tension: Confucian perfectionism versus\npluralism in the recognition of what constitutes a good and worthwhile\nhuman life; the Confucian value of social harmony versus individual\nrights; and the Confucian value of meritocracy versus the grounding of\na government\u2019s legitimacy in its acceptance by the governed.\n\nJoseph Chan (2014) has classified Confucian ethics, along with much of\nancient Greek ethics, as perfectionist in structure. Many of the\ncentral ethical judgments in Confucianism have to do what what it is\nto live a good human life, and the virtues it takes to live such a\nlife. As indicated earlier, the Confucian conception of a good human\nlife is centered around relationships--within the family, within\nfriendship, and also within a society in which one aspires to serve a\ngovernment by advancing the mission of securing the material and moral\nwelfare of the people. From the standpoint of a contemporary liberal\ndemocratic theory, one might question how much room this leaves people\nto choose among a plurality of reasonable conceptions of the good\nlife. Certainly, many contemporary Americans and Europeans would not\nplace so central an emphasis on family relationship and on filiality\nas Confucians do. Chan (2000, 2014) proposes to defuse this tension\nthrough advocating a moderate Confucian perfectionism that refrains\nfrom promoting a comprehensive view of how people ought to live. The\nliberal argument that conceptions of the good life are too\ncontroversial to be promoted by the state does not apply, he argues,\nto some important constituents of the Confucian conception of how to\nlive--prudential goods and goods necessary for agency. Such goods,\nwhen separated from a comprehensive conception that orders and\nprioritizes them into a particular way of life, can be promoted in\npiecemeal fashion through non-coercive methods in the context of\nparticular issues, and justifications can be given on the basis of\ncommon ground and compromise.\n\nKim (2016) argues that Chan\u2019s version of moderate Confucian\nperfectionism does not leave enough that is distinctively Confucian.\nFiliality as traditionally understood is tightly associated with a\npatrilineal family/clan structure and with rituals that express gender\nhierarchy, which is why it is the greatest failure of filiality to\nfail to produce a male heir who will continue the male family line and\nwho will conduct the ceremonies of ancestor worship. On the other\nhand, if one does leave enough that is distinctively and traditionally\nConfucian, Kim argues, one will not have a perfectionism that is\nmoderate enough to be compatible with the pluralistic, diverse\ncharacter of contemporary East Asian societies. Kim proposes the\nalternative he calls \u201cpublic reason Confucianism,\u201d which\nsets traditional Confucianism and the democratic values of popular\nsovereignty, political equality, and the right to political\nparticipation in dialogue with each other. The two sides must\naccommodate to each other. In practice, it seems that the most glaring\ninequalities accepted under traditional Confucianism, including gender\ninequalities that support women\u2019s unequal standing as citizens,\nmust go, though traditionalist Confucian associations retain a degree\nof autonomy to run their affairs and to retain \u201cmoderate\ninequalities\u201d when these do not have vital public implications\n(2016, 164). One of the challenges Kim may have to address is whether\nin the dialogue between traditional Confucianism and democratic values\nthere emerges something that is coherent and still distinctively\nConfucian. The previously discussed commentators on Confucianism and\ngender equality illustrate how it might be argued that gender equality\nis more compatible with Confucian values than they are usually thought\nto be. They also raise the issue of what \u201ctraditional\u201d\nConfucianism really is, whether it is one thing, and whether it has\nnot always been constantly changing.\n\nAngle (2012) addresses the tension between perfectionism and pluralism\nabout the good life by developing an argument he finds in the\ntwentieth century Confucian Mou Zongsan. Mou holds that politics must\nultimately be based on moral values but is concerned about the\nexcesses of governments trying to promote particular conceptions of\nvirtue and the good life. Given the difficulties of achieving ethical\ninsight, even among the most accomplished of human beings, it is\nnecessary to separate to some degree political values from ethical\nvalue. Even a political leader who is a sage must engage in\n\u201cself restriction\u201d (ziwo kanxian). In practice,\nAngle explains, self-restriction means putting in place democratic\ninstitutions and the recognition of human rights. This not only sets\nup guardrails to keep political leaders from going badly off track,\nbut also provides citizens the opportunity to participation in public\nlife that is needed to advance their own ethical insight and further\nrealize good character.\n\nTan (2003) argues that Confucian methods for encouraging the\nrealization of virtues are non-coercive because its conception of the\ngood life is process-oriented and fallibilistic, and its conception of\npersonhood is social and relational. Human beings become persons\nthrough processes of relationship with each other, by contributing to\neach other\u2019s ethical growth. What growth amounts to is something\nthat can be meaningfully judged only within the particular\ncircumstances and the processes that have led up to the present. A\nfigure such as Confucius has authority not just because of who he is\nbut because others respond to him with spontaneous acceptance,\nadmiration, and emulation. Since Tan holds that these Confucian\nconceptions are eminently plausible, she argues that not only is\nConfucianism compatible with democracy, but that democracy needs to\nincorporate the insights of Confucianism. In the Western tradition,\nshe finds in John Dewey a thinker who is sympathetic to these\ninsights.\n\nIn section 2.3, it was suggested that Confucianism posits a\nfundamental harmony between individual and group interests, and that\nthere are ways in which Confucianism values autonomy and ways it does\nnot. These points have ramifications for the issue of whether\nConfucianism can recognize individual rights. Given the way that\nindividual and group interests are conceived as mutually dependent and\ninterwoven, Confucianism cannot recognize rights on the grounds that\nthe individual\u2019s interests inevitably conflict with group\ninterests. Furthermore, Confucians might have a legitimate concern\nthat an emphasis on individual rights, as things that can be claimed\nagainst the group, tends to encourage people to think of their\ninterests as incompatible with the interests of others.\n\nThese considerations should hold some weight for Confucians, but so do\nsome other considerations that support protections for individuals.\nConfucianism can recognize that individuals do not always accurately\nperceive or act on the fundamental compatibility between individual\nand group interests. Rights might be necessary in case relationships\nirretrievably break down and individuals need to be protected. Joseph\nChan (1999, 2014) has made this very point for rights as\n\u201cfallback\u201d mechanisms. One might go further than Chan does\nand give rights a more prominent place if one expects regular\nmisfiring on attempts to reconcile individual and group interests\n(e.g., see Fan 2010, Wong 2004). If in fact it can be a difficult\nmatter to tell how to promote fundamental harmony between\npeople\u2019s interests, and if political leaders tend to have their\njudgment about this matter compromised by the influence of some of\ntheir own personal interests and by the sheer fact of holding power\n(there is evidence that one becomes less sensitive to other\npeople\u2019s interests the longer one holds power over them), there\nmay be good reason to recognize rights to free speech that can be used\nby citizens to call office holders to account and to make their own\ninterests more salient. Providing these protections under the heading\nof rights may help to protect citizens when the content of their\nspeech concerns the wrongful or misconceived conduct and policies of\nan office holder (Wong, 2004).\n\nAngle\u2019s argument, inspired by Mou Zongsan\u2019s idea of\nself-restriction, has a similar logic of pointing to human fallibility\nas a warrant for rights. A more positive justification for rights\nmight be rooted in Confucian values. As mentioned earlier, Angle\n(2012) argues that participation in public affairs is necessary for\nadvancing the cultivation of one\u2019s character. Kim (2016) argues\nfor equal rights of political participation based in the Mencian view\nthat all human beings have the moral sprouts within their nature. What\nkept Mencius from recognizing an equal right to participation is his\ncommitment to the sage-king paradigm of government, but such an\narrangement is a non-starter for even contemporary East Asian\nsocieties with a substantial Confucian heritage.\n\nIndeed, if one goes back to the classical Confucian notion of harmony\ndiscussed in section 2.3, there is a basis for ensuring room for a\ndiversity of viewpoints. Harmony is not sameness of viewpoint but\nmakes use of diversity of viewpoint. In Analects 9.30,\nConfucius states the inevitability of what we today might call\n\u201creasonable disagreement:\u201d \u201cThe Master said,\n\u201dYou can study with some, and yet not necessarily walk the same\npath (dao); you can walk the same path as some, and yet not\nnecessarily take your stand with them; you can take your stand with\nthem, and yet not necessarily weigh things up in the same way\u201c\n(translation from Ames and Rosemont, 2010).\n\nPositive arguments for rights based on the goal of promoting the\ncommon good emerged in Chinese thought soon after it encountered the\nidea of rights from the West in the nineteenth century. For example,\nit was argued that individuals ought to have a range of freedom of\nexpression and action so that they can contribute more richly and\noriginally to the welfare of Chinese society. Chinese thinkers such as\nLiang Qichao and Japanese thinkers such as Kato affirmed both the\nlegitimacy of the individual\u2019s desires and the necessity to\nharmonize individual and group desires (see Angle and Svensson, 2001;\nAngle, 2002). Emphasis on the former would be the relatively new\nelement in a contemporary Confucianism, but 1B6 of the\nMencius provides a striking anticipation of this element.\nHere King Xuan tells Mencius that his ability to be a true king for\nhis people is thwarted by his desires for wealth and for sex. Mencius\nreplies that if the King accords the common people the same privileges\nfor wealth and sex, there would be no problem in becoming a true king.\nXunzi (see section 2.6) conceives of morality as a way of harmonizing\nthe desires of individuals so that destructive conflict is replaced by\nproductive harmony, and this gives the satisfaction of desire a\ncentral role in his version of Confucian ethics. Later on in the\ntradition, Dai Zhen defended the legitimacy of self-interested desire\nas long as it is tempered by a proper concern for others (see Tiwald,\n2011a; and section 2.8). Rosemont (1991, 2004) has argued that\n\u201dsecond-generation\u201c\u201dpositive\u201c rights to\neducation and economic security are better grounded in the Chinese\ntradition than they have been in the West. Such grounding might have\nvery deep roots in Confucian thought, specifically what Chan calls the\n\u201dservice\u201c conception of government, or the idea that\ngovernment finds its only warrant in protecting and advancing the\nwelfare of the people.\n\nThe above arguments on behalf of recognizing rights within a Confucian\nframework provide resources for addressing the worry that rights\nundermine social harmony. Achieving harmony is a continuous process of\nadjusting to inevitable differences even among reasonable individuals.\nProviding a forum for the airing of differences can positively\ncontribute to a better and more inclusive view of the common good.\nRights need not be justified in a way that opposes them to the common\ngood but can in fact be construed as necessary for its realization.\nThis might present a somewhat different conception of rights that does\nnot treat them as \u201dtrumps\u201c but as based on substantial\nmoral considerations that must be taken into account but do not\nnecessarily override all other moral considerations. Greene (2021) has\nargued that the American legal tradition is an outlier (even among\ndeveloped democracies) in regarding rights in the former way and that\nit would be better off adopting something like the latter way.\n\nIt might be argued that however much Confucianism evolves, it would be\ndifficult to conceive of it without the idea that the wisest, most\nvirtuous and competent should rule. Meritocracy is not in outright\ncontradiction with popular sovereignty. One might hold that people\nshould vote for those best equipped to promote the common good, for\nexample, and one might further argue that in contemporary\ncircumstances, Confucians have other reasons to take on board\ndemocratic institutions of citizen participation. Inspiration for the\nidea of combining legitimacy founded on popular election and\nlegitimacy founded on merit originally came from a proposal by the\ninfluential contemporary Confucian Jiang Qing (2012). However, his\nproposal includes a third legislative chamber consisting of those\nrepresenting the cultural and religious heritage of China, which most\nothers have not included.\n\nJoseph Chan (2014) has argued that Confucianism may do well to\nincorporate democratic electoral institutions to hold political\nleaders accountable to the common good. Accordingly, he proposes that\nthere should be a democratically elected legislative chamber in a\nConfucian moderately perfectionist government. However, as democratic\ninstitutions are known not to necessarily result in the selection of\nthe wisest, most virtuous and competent, Chan proposes a second\nlegislative chamber to be paired with the first, the members of this\nsecond being chosen on the basis of demonstrated merit, in terms of\nvirtue and competence, as chosen by those who have had the opportunity\nto observe them in action, such as colleagues and experienced\njournalists. Chan\u2019s overriding Confucian concern is moral\neducation throughout the whole society in virtues such as respect,\nreverence, trustworthiness, sincerity, beneficence, civility, and the\ncommon good. In fact, the primary function of the second chamber, in\nhis view, is to advance this educative goal.\n\nDaniel Bell (2006) and Tongdong Bai (2013, 2015) have proposed that\none legislative chamber be comprised of elected representatives and\nthe other by those selected on the basis of exams and previous\nperformance in office. Bell and Bai are more pessimistic than Chan is\nabout the prospects for modern democratic citizenry to make good\nchoices. Bai points out that the ancient Greeks had slaves that made\nit possible for them to fully participate in the Assembly, and they\nbelonged to a small city state, not a large society with many complex\nissues that require specialized knowledge to handle, and not one that\ngives rise to enormous inequalities that undermine the sense of a\ncommon good. Bell (2015) points out the negligible impact of any\nindividual\u2019s vote in large democracies, and the time and effort\nrequired to become better informed about complex issues requiring\nspecialized knowledge. Even if individuals had the time and motivation\nto to be more informed, they are subject to a wide array of cognitive\nbiases that they are liable to get little help in correcting.\n\nIn later work Bell (2015) proposes a \u201dvertical\u201c model in\nwhich democratic elections are instituted at the local level but the\ntop national leaders are selected on the basis of merit. at the\nintermediate levels, experimentation with democracy can take place,\nand if successful can be tried in other places or on an expanded\nbasis. He let go of the bicameral proposal because he became convinced\nthat the democratically elected chamber would eventually dominate.\nBell argues that democracy works best at the local level where voters\nare more likely to know the virtue and ability of the leaders they\nselect. The issues are relatively straightforward and easier to\nunderstand. It is easier to generate a sense of community at that\nlevel. At the highest levels of government, the issues are much more\ncomplex. Bell is well aware of problems for realizing the ideal of\nvirtuous and able leaders. There is corruption and ossification of an\nelite who are likely to come from and select colleagues from a narrow\nset of social, economic and educational backgrounds. Even if these\nproblems could be addressed through institutional reform, there is in\nthe end a need to legitimize conferring so much power and prestige on\nan elite who might not be that different from others in society who\nchoose different vocations. Bell concludes that democracy (perhaps in\nthe form of a popular referendum on the vertical model) might be\nnecessary for the legitimacy of a political meritocracy, even in a\ncountry with a Confucian heritage such as China.\n\nOne common characteristic of the contemporary writing on Confucianism,\nrights and democracy is its relative openness to alternatives. There\nis less of a tendency to assume that a single model of government is\nright for all societies, even all large contemporary societies, or\neven all large, developed countries. At the same time, there is\nopenness to learning from the experience of other societies. There is\nmore awareness of the continuing nature of the debate and the\ninconclusiveness of history\u2019s verdict thus far.\n3. Mohist Ethics\n3.1 A consequentialist ethic, but what kind?\n\nThe Mohists constituted a philosophical school founded by Mozi, who\nwas roughly contemporaneous with Confucius. Not much is known about\nhim, but a reasonable speculation is that Mozi came from an artisan\nbackground. The text bearing his name contains purported quotations\nfrom Mozi, but it is manifestly the contribution of different persons\nover a substantial period of time. The text advocates a\nconsequentialist ethic that requires concern and acting for the\nbenefit of all. Those who made the earliest contributions to\nthe Mozi had a conception of benefit that is very\nconcrete and relatively narrow, limited to material goods to\nsatisfy the basic needs of all (e.g., enough food, shelter and warm\nclothing), sufficient population, and social order. As will be\ndiscussed later, however, this earliest conception may have included\nrelational virtues such as filiality. Later Mohists seem to have\nbroadened their conception to something like a a preference\nsatisfaction criterion using pleasure and displeasure as indicators\n(See Stephens\u2019 2021 argument for such an interpretation of the\nlater Mohists; for a translation, see Fraser 2020: Books 40\u20133 A\n26\u201327).\n\nThe Mozi is quite explicit in its consequentialism. It names\nthree fa or standards for judging the viability of beliefs\nand theories (see Fraser 2020, Book 35). One standard is of\nusefulness. In applying this standard, one assesses the viability of a\nbelief or theory according to the beneficial or harmful consequences\nof acting on it. Another standard is that of consulting the origin,\nwhich is the historical record on the actions of the sage-kings. One\ndetermines whether the belief or theory being judged accords with\nthose actions. The third standard is looking at evidence provided by\nthe eyes and ears of the people. This seems to refer to observations\nthat garner some degree of intersubjective consensus. Each standard is\npresented as if its validity might be independent from the others, but\nthere are indications that the standard of usefulness is the most\nbasic one. For one thing, consulting the record of the\nsage-kings\u2019 actions hardly seems to be a good idea in Mohist\nterms given the Mohist objection to valuing tradition for its own\nsake, unless these actions are good guides because they\nproduced good results, a historical judgment that was commonly\naccepted by otherwise disputing philosophical schools. Furthermore,\narguments given in the Mozi that are purportedly based on\nintersubjective observation seem extremely dubious, e.g., that ghosts\nexist because stories are told about them very often. In fact, the\npossibility that ghosts do not exist is explicitly admitted (Fraser\n2020, Book 31), but sacrifices to spirits are justified on the grounds\nthat they produce good effects among the living. Ghosts in general are\nput to good use in the text: their primary activity is to avenge\nthemselves upon the living persons who have done them wrong. The\nstandard of usefulness guides application of the other standards. Even\nwhat seems to be the attempted justification of the standard of\nusefulness by reference to the will of tian or Heaven\n(Fraser, Book 26) has a circularity to it. We are to promote benefits\nand avoid harms because that is the will of Heaven, and Heaven\u2019s\nwill is to be relied upon because it is the wisest and noblest of all\nagents. But what could be the criterion for a being\u2019s being wise\nand noble exception the promotion of benefits and avoidance of harms?\nFurthermore, the will of Heaven is demonstrated by the fact that\nwrongdoers are punished and the virtuous rewarded. Again, the evidence\nseems highly selective and is guided by the very standard of\nusefulness that it is seeemingly being justified.\n\nA crucial issue in the interpretation of Mohism is what kind of\nconcern for all it requires. As indicated earlier, Mencius interpreted\nthe Mohist advocacy of jian ai to be advocacy of equal or\nimpartial care for all, but some of the more important contemporary\nscholarship of Mohism has problematized this interpretation. Three\nbooks in the Mozi text (Fraser 2020, Books 14, 15, and 16)\nall bear the title of \u201dJian Ai\u201c (translated by\nFraser as \u201dInclusive Care\u201c). These books differ somewhat in\ncontent, perhaps suggesting an evolution in Mohist thought over time\ncorresponding to the order of the chapters (see Defoort, 2005\u20136).\nPeople who do nothing to benefit others if they are not related to\nthem in the right way, or even harm them, are contrasted with those\nwho act according to jian ai. In the later two books, we are\ntold to care for others as we care for ourselves, to view others as we\nview ourselves, or to be for others as we are for ourselves. Such\nformulations might reasonably be taken to require equality or\nimpartiality of care. Perhaps this is why Mencius interpreted Mozi as\nrequiring denial of one\u2019s parents (Mencius 3B9).\n\nHowever, the jian ai books consistently count among the\nfailures to care for others failures of filiality between fathers and\nsons. They correspondingly count among the benefits of acting\naccording to jian ai the realization of relational virtues\nsuch as filiality. Furthermore, the words used to say that we are to\ncare for others \u201das\u201c we care for ourselves, to view others\n\u201das\u201c we view ourselves, and to be for others\n\u201das\u201c we are for ourselves, are ruo and\nyou, which can be used to mean equality of relationship or\nmerely similarity of relationship (see Chiu 2013; Fraser 2016). Chiu\n(2013) concludes that jian ai means only caring for everyone\nwith no requirement in equality of care. Fraser (2016), on the other\nhand, points to passages in later chapters of the Mozi (in\nthe section called the \u201dMo Bian\u201c or \u201dMohist\nDialectics;\u201c see Fraser, 2016: 171) that support the equal or\nimpartial caring interpretation.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the necessity to distinguish\njian ai as a prescription for the attitude to take toward\nothers and a prescription for conduct toward them. To have equal care\nas an attitude does not entail acting toward others in the same way.\nIndeed, the limited nature of the mental and physical resources\navailable to the individual agent seems to necessitate some degree of\ninequality of action toward others. This may be at least partly why\nthe jian ai books are relatively modest in their\nprescriptions for how individuals are to benefit others, even though\nthere is some expansion of requirement in the later chapters. In fact\neven the latter prescriptions do not seem incompatible with what might\nbe prescribed in the way of conduct by Confucian care with\ndistinctions: refraining from harming others, engaging in\nrelationships of mutual aid, and contributing to the support of those\nleast able to care for themselves and who lack families able to\nprotect them. Thus the Mohists may eventually have come to the view\nthat a division of moral labor is suitable for most people. Most can\nsatisfy the duties of righteousness (yi) through refraining\nfrom harming others, devoting more of their resources to benefiting\nthose in traditional relationships with them such as family, engaging\nin mutual aid in somewhat larger groups such as the village, being\nprepared to contribute along with others to the support and protection\nof the most needy, and being loyal to those charged with seeing to the\nbenefit of much larger groups. This picture fits with Mozi\u2019s\nexpress concern (in book 8 on promoting the worthy) that social\nconflict comes from each person having and acting on their own\nconception of what is right. To avoid conflict a strict nested\nhierarchy of authority must be instituted: the Son of Heaven rules\nover the entire country with the help of ministers, and the country is\ndivided into states, which are further divided into fiefdoms, and so\non. Each social unit has members who are required to report their\nviews to a superior on what is right and wrong, and the superior\u2019s\nword on what is right is final (though one may remonstrate with a\nsuperior if one believes them wrong), and each unit must report to the\nsuperior of the next larger unit containing it. The Son of Heaven is\naccountable to Heaven, Tian, a more clearly and consistently\nanthropomorphized deity than the Confucian Tian, and whose\nwill is that people benefit and not harm one another.\n\nHonoring the relational virtues of family may be justified on the\ngrounds that it is part of a social division of labor that most\nefficiently contributes to the benefit of all. It may also be, as\nFraser (2016: 146) has suggested, that the Mohist conception of\nbenefit (li) includes the realization of such virtues as\ngoods in themselves. On either construal or both, since the possible\njustifications are not inconsistent with another, Mohists may not have\nadvocated as demanding an ethic as may appear from the text\u2019s\nstatements of what jian ai is. Even if one interprets the\nattitudinal component as requiring equal or impartial care, the\nconduct component might consist of only a moderately demanding norms\nfor benefiting others.\n\nHeaven is treated as a kind of model for human beings. In one of the\nbooks on Heaven\u2019s will, Mozi is quoted as saying that he treats\nthe will of Heaven as a wheelwright holds to his compass and a\ncarpenter his square. That Heaven is taken as a direct model in this\nway is significant for the question of whether jian ai taken\nin its attitudinal component means equal concern or merely concern\nthat can vary in degree. Heaven\u2019s will is not known through\nrevelation or scripture but rather in how it acts. According to the\ntext, it benefits and nourishes everyone; it rewards those who aid\nothers and punishes those who harm others. It provides life and\nsustenance to rich and poor, noble and low, kin and nonkin; it created\nthe regular and constant pattern of the seasons and weather that makes\nall these broadly distributed benefits possible. If Heaven\u2019s\nwill is taken as a model for the attitude one should have toward\nothers, then impartiality of attitude seems to be the\nprescription.\n\nHeaven also can serve as a model for conduct, such that one might not\nonly benefit all in the sense of conforming to norms that would\ngenerally benefit everyone if enough people do their part, but also\ndirectly try to benefit as many people as possible, especially if one\nis in a position of means and influence. In the 16th book, King Wen is\nextolled as having exemplified the practice of jian ai. His\npractice was like the illumination of the sun and the moon, showing no\nfavoritism to any direction or region. King Wen here exemplifies what\ncan be a more demanding virtue than righteousness, which is\nbenevolence (in the Mohist text this probably the best translation of\nren). Fraser points out that in some of the later books of\nthe Mozi that feature dialogues between Mozi and others, an\nideal of sagehood emerges that is much more demanding than the\nprescriptions issued for everyone in the jian ai books. In\nchapter 49, righteousness is characterized as lying largely in helping\nothers (Fraser 2016: 150). More radically, book 47 quotes Mozi as\nadvocating the elimination of happiness, anger, joy, sorrow, likes and\ndislikes and dedicating oneself solely to benevolence and\nrighteousness. Thus there might have been an evolution towards this\nmore demanding ideal late in the Mohist movement, but perhaps, as\nFraser (2016: 151) suggests, this ideal was treated as applicable only\nto the most devoted of Mohists.\n\nThis greater complexity associated with what it means to care for all\nmight be a feature of any consequentialist ethic that takes seriously\nthe idea of equal or impartial concern. Even if care as an attitude\ndoes not necessarily require trying to directly promote the benefit of\nall, the more capacity one has to promote the welfare of large numbers\nof people, the more one may (or should) feel bound to do so. Even if\none acknowledges relationships such as those one finds in good\nfamilies to have value in themselves, one might also be moved by the\nrecognition that these things are valuable to everyone. One might come\nto feel bound by the acknowledgment that one would be doing the most\ngood by helping the greater number to fulfill their basic needs and to\nachieve those relationships, even if this drains the mental and\nphysical resources one has to put into one\u2019s own\nrelationships.\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that similar ambiguities are displayed in\nWestern forms of consequentialism. There are very demanding forms of\nconsequentialism, exemplified by Peter Singer\u2019s argument for\nstrong duties to contribute to famine relief (Singer, 1972). These\nforms typically focus on the good an individual could do on their own,\nregardless of whether others act similarly. When combined with the\nidea that others are no less morally important than oneself, these\nforms tend to justify very strong duties on the part of those with\nrelatively plentiful resources to aid others. On the other hand, there\nare forms of consequentialism that construe the individual\u2019s\nduties in terms of a generally applicable set of norms, the\ndesirability of which is determined by the consequences of everyone or\nnearly everyone accepting them. Such forms of consequentialism, (e.g.,\nfor rule consequentialism, see Hooker 2000), tend to confirm more\nmodest demands on the individual to aid others. Consequentialism may\ntend to oscillate between the pole of doing\u2019s best in directly\nacting on equal concern for all others on the one hand and on the\nother hand acknowledging both practical and psychological limitations\non the ability of (at least) most people to do so.\n3.2 Comparisons with Confucian ethics\n\nHow, then, does Mohist ethics differ from Confucian ethics in the end?\nBecause Confucian care with distinctions requires the extension of\ncare to nonkin, and because Mohists by and large prescribed a modestly\ndemanding form of jian ai as applied to conduct toward\nothers, there is not as dramatic a practical difference as one might\nfirst think between Confucian and Mohist ethics. Confucians accept\nthat there are plural sources of moral duty, and that conflicts\nbetween the reasons provided by these sources must be dealt with\nthrough the discretion and weighing of judgment. While Mohists appear\nto put forward a monistic source of duty\u2014promoting benefits and\navoiding harms, a plausible reading of the Mozi has it including\nplural sources of benefit, e.g., food and filiality. They may also\nhave to resort to discretion and weighing of judgment when there are\nconflicts between plural goods. Mohists might attach more weight to\nthe value of doing good for the most people when it comes into\nconflict with loyalty to kin, but there is no explicit position on\nthis question in the Mozi.\n\nThere are certainly differences between the two ethics on the value of\nritual and musical performance. Of course, many Confucians might be\nunhappy with the Mohist portrayal of their tradition as insisting on\nextravagantly expensive performances. But the difference over the\nvalue of ritual and music has even deeper roots than the issue of how\nmuch of a society\u2019s material resources should be expended to\nstage them. Confucians tend to view the moral life as not only service\nto others but as fulfilling one\u2019s own humanity. This feature of\nConfucian ethics, which it shares with classical Greek virtue ethics,\ndistances it from Mohism.\n\nFurthermore, as pointed out earlier, the Confucian conception of a\nhumanly fulfilling way of life has aesthetic and emotionally\nexpressive dimensions that set it further apart from Mohism. The focus\non ritual and music exemplifies a deep concern for graceful and\nskillful enactments of concern and respect for others. To express\nthese attitudes in a fitting and beautiful way is intrinsically\nvaluable. The practice of ritual and music is also conceived as\ncrucial for cultivation of one\u2019s desires and emotional\ndispositions. For Confucius and Xunzi, such practice constituted\ntraining of one\u2019s desires and emotional dispositions, ways of\nrestraining a stubborn and undue concern for the self. While Mencius\ndoes not emphasize such a function for the practice of ritual and\nmusic, he does conceive of moral cultivation as nurturing the inborn\nemotional sensibilities that find fulfillment in relationship to\nothers. He recognizes the danger of overfeeding the small part of the\nself that takes pleasure in eating and drinking. This need to shape\nand train the self stands in contrast with the aforementioned Mohist\nassumption that the main cause of social conflict is the variety of\ndifferent conceptions of what is right that individuals tend to have.\nThere is no indication in this Mohist diagnosis that there is any\nspecial difficulty in getting oneself or others to try to do what one\nthinks is right.\n4. Daoist Ethics\n4.1 Ethical perspectives drawn from the Daodejing: the \u201dsoft\u201c style of action and social primitivism\n\nIn the Daodejing (the text is associated with Laozi and is\nthought to have originated sometime in the period of\n6th-3rd century B.C.E.) and Zhuangzi (a\ntext associated with the historical Zhuangzi who lived in the\n4th century B.C.E.) the focus shifts from the human social\nworld to the cosmos, in which that human world often appears to be\ntiny and insignificant or even comically and absurdly self-important.\nIt may seem that such a distanced and detached perspective has no\nethical content or implications, but that is to assume an overly\nnarrow vision of the ethical. In its own way, Daoism addresses as much\nas Confucianism does questions as to how one ought to live one\u2019s\nlife. Daoist ethics emphasizes appropriate responsiveness to the\nbroader world that shapes and enfolds the human social world.\n\nThe nature of the vision of the broader world is open to dispute. A\ntraditional interpretation of the Daodejing is that it\nconveys a metaphysical vision of the dao as the source of all\nthings, and that this source is specially associated in nonbeing and\nemptiness as contrasted with being, perhaps suggesting that the\ndao is an indeterminate ontological ground in which the\nmyriad individual things are incipient. Some contemporary commentators\nhold that the traditional interpretation is an imposition on the text\nof later metaphysical concerns (Hansen, 1992; LaFargue, 1992). Others\nhew closer to the traditional interpretation, citing passages such as\nthose in chapter 4, where Dao is described as being empty, as seeming\nsomething like the ancestor of the myriad of things, as appearing to\nprecede the Lord (di).\n\nHowever that issue is resolved, it is apparent that a certain\nconception of the patterns of nature is embedded in the text and\ninforms its ethical recommendations. Consider the characterizations of\nnatural processes as falling into one or another of opposites: there\nis the active, aggressive, hard, and the male, on the one hand; and\nthere is the passive, yielding, soft, and female, on the other hand\n(later these forces were much more explicitly associated with\nyang and yin). Conventional \u201dknowledge\u201c\nand \u201dwisdom\u201c dichotomizes processes into one or another of\nthese categories and values the first over the second. The\nDaodejing extols the efficacy of the second. Whereas the\nfirst is associated with strength, the second, it is often said,\npossesses a deeper, underlying strength as demonstrated by water\novercoming the hard and unyielding (chapter 78). Hence a\n\u201dsoft\u201c style of action, wu wei (literally,\n\u201dnonaction\u201c but less misleadingly translated as effortless\naction) is recommended, even as a style of ruling. For example,\nchapter 66 says that one who desires to rule must in his words humble\nhimself before the people, and that one who desires to lead the people\nmust in his person follow them. Chapter 75 says that rulers eat up too\nmuch in taxes and therefore people are hungry. Rulers are too fond of\naction and therefore the people are difficult to govern. Setting too\nmuch store on life makes people treat death lightly. The last point\nbrings out the related theme that striving after something often\nproduces the opposite of the intended result. One of the more\nprominent themes in the Daodejing is the rejection of\nmoralism: a preoccupation with and striving to become good or\nvirtuous. Chapter 19 says to exterminate ren and discard\nyi (righteousness or rectitude), and the people will recover\nfilial love.\n\nOne crucial ambiguity of the text is whether the \u201dsoft\u201c\nwu wei style of action is meant consistently to be extolled\nover the \u201dhard\u201c style (as Lau claims in his introduction\nto his translation of the Daodejing, 1963), or whether the\nreversal of valuation is merely a heuristic device meant to correct a\ncommon human tendency to err in the direction of consistently valuing\nthe hard style (LaFargue, 1992). The second alternative is consistent\nwith a theme plausibly attributed to the text: that all dichotomies\nand all valuations based on them are unreliable in the end, even\nevaluations that are reversals of the conventionally accepted ones.\nPrescriptions to follow the \u201dsoft\u201c style, taken as\nexceptionless generalizations, are no more reliable than the\nconventional wisdom to follow the \u201dhard\u201c style. On the\nother hand, many of the prescriptions in the Daodejing seem\npremised on the conception of there being genuine human needs that are\nsimple and few in number, and that desires going beyond these needs\nare the source of trouble and conflict. Prescriptions for the ruler\nseem to be aimed at bringing about a reversion to a kind of\nprimitivist state of society where no \u201dimprovements\u201c are\nsought or desired. Carried to its logical limit, this primitivism\nimplies the existence of a natural goodness with which human beings\nought to become attuned. Indeed, the first of the three treasures of\nchapter 67 is ci or compassion. The ethics of the\nDaodejing is in these respects less radical and iconoclastic\nthan some of its anti-moralistic language might suggest. If we are not\nto strive after goodness, it is there nevertheless as something that\nwe must recover.\n4.2 Ethical perspectives from Zhuangzi: skeptical questioning, attunement to the grain of things, inclusion, acceptance and freedom\n\nOn this point the Zhuangzi often sounds a much more skeptical\nnote. In the second (Qi Wu Lun \u201dEqualizing All\nThings\u201c) chapter of that text, the following questions go\nunanswered: \u201dHow do I know that to take pleasure in life is not\na delusion? How do I know that we who hate death are not exiles since\nchildhood who have forgotten the way home?\u201c (translation from\nGraham, 1989, 59; see also the translation from Ziporyn, 2009). The\nhuman pretension to know what is true and important is lampooned by\ncomparing it to the pretension of the cicada and turtle dove to know\nby their own experiences of flight the possibilities of how high\ncreatures can fly. There is no vision of a primitivist utopia here\neither. Rather, the dominant attitude towards the possibility of\nlarge-scale social change for the better is pessimism. It is a\ndangerous task for the idealist to undertake, and one that will\nprobably end badly for the idealist because rulers don\u2019t like to\nbe lectured on their failings. On this matter, the Zhuangzi\nnot only diverges from the primitivist Utopian strain in the\nDaodejing but also more forcefully from the earnest and\never-striving idealism of the Confucians. In the fourth (Ren Jian\nShi \u201dThe Human World\u201c) chapter, a pessimistic\nConfucius (who here seems to be speaking on behalf of Zhuangzi) tells\nhis idealistic student Yan Hui that he will probably get himself\nkilled trying to change the ways of a callous and violent ruler.\nFurther, some passages in this story can be read as implying that Yan\nHui\u2019s deeper motivation is to gain praise for his own virtue.\nThat Yan Hui might be characterized in this way is especially\nsignificant, because the Confucian tradition regards his motivations\nas being especially pure. The implication might be that the Confucian\nidealistic project is continually and inevitably self-undermining:\npeople can sense the self-aggrandizing motivations behind the noble\ntalk and react negatively (see Chong, 2016).\n\nAt the same time, it is significant that in this story Confucius does\nnot reject Yan Hui\u2019s idealistic project altogether, but suggests\nanother way of proceeding. If he insists on trying, Yan Hui must\nrefrain from formulating plans and goals. Such preconceptions will\nonly interfere with seeing the ruler as he is and how he must be dealt\nwith (there is a grain, then, unique to each human being to which one\nmust become attuned to deal with him or her). So Yan Hui must prepare\nnot with plans but by fasting and emptying his mind, so that he can\nlisten to the ruler not only with his ears and mind, but also with his\nqi or vital energies. Such advice might in contemporary\nterms be construed as advice to cultivate one\u2019s ability to tune into\nwhat is going on with other people through one\u2019s gut intuitions, which\non a neuroscientic level might correspond to the idea that human\nbeings make practical decisions with the aid of bodily or \u201dsomatic\nmarkers\u201c which record the positive or negative valence of outcomes\nensuing from certain types of actions (Damsio\n1994).  Elsewhere in the text, there are happier references\nto activities that involve attunement to the grain of whatever is at\nhand. These forms of activity are presented as supremely satisfying.\nThe most prominent example is that of Cook Ding in the third\n(Yangsheng Zhu \u201dThe Primacy of Nourishing Life\u201c)\nchapter, the cook who is able to wield his knife so skillfully in\ncutting up oxen that it flows without a nick through the spaces within\nthe joints. Cook Ding has gotten past the stage where he sees with his\neyes while cutting the ox; instead his qi or vital energies\nmove freely to where they must go. The kind of phenomenology to which\nthe Zhuangzi refers is one in which there is no\nself-conscious guiding of one\u2019s actions but rather a complete\nabsorption with the matter of hand. The efficacy and effortlessness of\nsuch activities might appear to suggest privileged veridical access to\nthe situation and material at hand, but a less extreme interpretation\nis available.\n\nComplete absorption in the matter at hand seems to involve the ability\nto keep one\u2019s desires from interfering with one\u2019s\nattention. The Daodejing contains epigrams about the\ndesirability of being desireless, but first chapter (Xiao Yao You\n\u201dWandering Far and Unfettered\u201c of the Zhuangzi\nincludes an entertaining story that conveys this lesson. Huizi tries\nto figure out what to do with the shells of some huge gourds he had\ngrown. He tried using them as water dippers and water containers, but\nthey are too large and heavy for those purposes. Not being able to\ndiscover a purpose for them, he smashes them to pieces. Zhuangzi\nchides his friend for having underbrush in his head and not realizing\nthat he could have lashed the gourds together to make a raft for\nfloating about on the lakes and the rivers. A recurrent theme\nthroughout the first chapter is that we are ruled by our\npreconceptions of the uses of things, which keeps us from being able\nto recognize the usefulness of the \u201duseless.\u201c When\nperforming skill activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s, preoccupation\nwith the \u201duses\u201c of these activities can interfere with our\nability to perform them well. Woodcarver Qing (chapter 19 Da\nSheng \u201dFathoming Life\u201c of the Zhuangzi) makes\nmarvelous bellstands. When he goes to make one, he fasts in order to\nstill his mind. As he fasts, the distracting thoughts of\ncongratulation and reward melt away, honors and salary, blame and\npraise, skill and clumsiness, even his awareness of having a body and\nlimbs. Only when he is able to focus does he go into the forest to\nobserve the nature of the wood, and only then does he have a complete\nvision of the bellstand.\n\nInterpretations of the Zhuangzi tend to give primacy either\nto the skeptical passages or to the passages suggesting special access\nto the grain of things. On the first option, Zhuangzi simply\nappreciates the many perspectives on the world one could have, the\nmany ways of dividing the world up by sets of distinctions, none of\nwhich can be shown in a non-question-begging manner to be superior to\nthe others (Hansen, 1992, 2003; see also Chong, 2016). On the second\noption, Zhuangzi is often taken to hold in a kind of ineffable and\nnonconceptual access to the world, an access that makes possible the\nefficacy of activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s (Ivanhoe, 1996; Roth\n1999, 2000). A third possibility is that the text demonstrates a kind\nof continuing dialectic between skepticism and the conviction that one\nhas genuine knowledge, and that the dialectic has no envisioned end.\nThe dialectic includes a stage of skeptical questioning of whatever\none\u2019s current beliefs are, but the aim is not merely to\nundermine but to reveal something about the way the world that is\noccluded by one\u2019s current beliefs. However, one is not allowed\nto rest content with the new beliefs but is led to question their\ncomprehensiveness and adequacy precisely because they are suspected of\noccluding still something else about the world (Wong, 2005).\n\nThe third possibility does not subscribe to ineffable and\nnonconceptual access to the world, nor does it expouse a dogmatic\nskepticism that declares that no knowledge is possible. It is arguably\nconsistent with some of the latest thinking about human\nperception--that it operates through selecting an extremely small\nportion of sensory input  from the world and that is is both\na bottom-up and top-down process in which that input is interpreted\naccording to what we already believe about the world and is used as a\nbasis for predicting what will be experienced in the near future. If\nthere are discrepancies in our predictions we may be led to revise our\nprior beliefs and make new predictions to be tested (Clark 2016). This\nprocess is highly fallible because of necessary selectiveness in\nthe sensory input to which we attend and because of tendencies toward\nbiased interpretation of that input in the service of our prior\ncognitive commitments. Confucius\u2019 advice to Yan Hui to \u201dfast\u201c his mind\ndoes not have to be construed as cultivating an ineffable and\nunmediated access to the world but rather as meditative practice\nthat might unseat those commitments in favor of alternative\nperspectives on the world. These alternatives might better fit\nincoming sensory input or prompt us to take in a different range\nof input.\n\nSuch an interpretation aligns with apparent advocacy in the second\nchapter of going with the \u201dpresent this\u201c instead of sticking with a\nfixed perspective on the world, constituted by a set of\ndistinctions between \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong.\u2019 Confucians are described\nas having their set of \u2018this\u2019s and \u2018that\u2019s,\n\u2019right\u2019s and \u2018wrong\u2019s, which are diametrically\nopposed to the \u2018this\u2019s and \u2018that\u2019s and\n\u2018right\u2019s and \u2018wrong\u2019s of the Mohists, such\nthat the \u2019this\u2019 of the Confucians is\nthe \u2019that\u2019 of Mohists, the \u2019right\u2019 of\nConfucians being the \u2018wrong\u2019 of Confucians. Instead of\nrigidly applying any single perspective in the face of present\nexperience that does not fit it very well, the sage is described as\nfinding a \u201dpresent this.\u201c When the Zhuangzi is\nconstrued as delivering such a message, it can be situated as taking\nto the ultimate a theme that is found in much if not all classical\nChinese philosophy, one that Goldin (2005a) calls the \u201dprimacy of the\nsituation\u201c and Valmisa calls \u201dadaptive agency\u201c (2021). This theme,\nwhile not necessarily dismissing the relevance of general rules as\nguidelines for action, tends to view the particulars of the situation\nat hand as the ultimate ground for judging the appropriateness of\naction. In the Analects and the Mencius, for\nexample, this theme is reflected in its conception\nof yi or rightness as appropriateness to the\nsituation, though clearly the Zhuangzi is much\ncloser to a kind of radically particularist view of what is\nappropriate. \n\nHowever one might try to reconcile the tension between the skeptical\nquestioning and the claims to special knowledge, the stories about\nskill activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s arguably exemplify certain\nkinds of activities that human beings across cultures and historical\nperiods have experienced to their great satisfaction. These activities\ninvolve the mastery of the many sub-activities that constitute a\ncomplex activity with goals that challenge abilities of the agent. The\nactivities of master musicians (e.g., the technique of fingering on a\nflute), artistic performers (e.g., the placement of the toes in the\npirouette of a dancer) and athletes (e.g., bringing the bat through\nthe optimal plane while swinging it to hit a baseball) correspond\nrather closely to Cook Ding\u2019s mastery of the sub-activities of\ncutting through the ox. In all these activities the agent does not\nneed to pay conscious attention to performance of the sub-activities,\nand this enables attention to be focused on matters that escape the\napprentice. Just as Cook Ding\u2019s skill in the motor execution of\nthe motions of cutting allows him to fully focus on where the joints\nand spaces are, the flutist is able to concentrate on the music as she\nis making it and not her fingering technique (see Csikszentmihalyi,\n1990 for a study of such activities).\n\nOne interesting and realistic detail in the cook\u2019s story\nchallenges the reading of the skill stories as extolling the\npossibility of nonconceptual access to the grain of things. The cook\nsays that whenever he comes to a complicated place in the ox, he sizes\nup the difficulties, tell himself to watch out and be careful, keeps\nhis eyes on what he\u2019s doing, works very slowly, and moves the\nknife with the greatest subtlety until the pieces fall away. Clearly\nthere is conceptualization going on here, and in fact it is\nimplausible to deny that the whole activity is being guided by a\nconceptualized goal! There is a difference between self-conscious\nconceptualization of experience and the application of concepts\nwithout awareness of applying them. One mustn\u2019t confuse the\nlatter with nonconceptualized experience. While there may be some way\nof squaring this part of the story with the interpretation that\nnonconceptual experience is celebrated in the Zhuangzi, the\nvirtue of the story is that it is realistic and captures aspects of\nsupremely skilled activities that are part of the experience of many\npeople. Insofar as the Zhuangzi recommends such activities as\npart of a good life, it very much presents an ethic. When taken\ntogether with Confucius\u2019 initial advice to Yan Hui to listen not only\nwith his ears and not only with his mind but also with\nhis qi \n\nIt also presents an ethic in supporting the idea of inclusiveness and\nacceptance. Here skeptical questioning of what we think we know,\nespecially what we think we know about people and who is good and has\nsomething to offer to us are questioned in the chapter featuring\nstigmatized individuals, often with feet amputated (a common criminal\npunishment of the time), who turn out to be masters drawing as many\nstudents as Confucius. The Zhuangzi also urges identification\nand acceptance of the whole and of any and all of the changes that its\ncreatures undergo. We should not be so sure that life is great and\ndeath is evil, and accept everything that comes our way, marveling at\nthe possibility that upon our death we might be made into a\nfly\u2019s foreleg the next time around. The Zhuangzi, like\nthe Daodejing, calls upon human beings to identify with the\nwhole of the cosmos and its transformations, and such identification\ninvolves acceptance, even celebration of death and loss, because in\ndying one participates in the next transformation of the cosmos and\nbecomes something else to marvel at, such as a fly\u2019s foreleg.\nSuch a call may hold deep appeal, especially for those who cannot see\nany form of monotheism as a viable object for belief and yet desire\nsome sort of spiritual connection that stretches beyond the merely\nhuman community.\n\nHowever, such a call also raises challenging questions about human\npossibility. Can human beings really accept the loss of their selves\nand their loved ones with the kind of equanimity that identification\nwith the whole requires? The Zhuangzi presents stories that\nrepresent different possibilities for conceiving of the nature of this\nequanimity. In the stories of the four masters, death is accepted\nwithout the slightest shiver. In the story of the death of\nZhuangzi\u2019s wife, a more complex emotional story is told, whereby\nZhuangzi first feels her loss but comes to accept it as yet another\ntransformation. This story suggests that one may retain one\u2019s\nattachments to particular people and yet maintain resilience in the\nface of their loss because of one\u2019s identification with the\nwhole (Wong 2006; see Becker, 1998 for an discussion of resilience in\nthe face of loss in the context of developing a contemporary\nStoicism). But how is such identification psychologically possible? In\nthe Zhuangzi, it seems based on a spirit of restless and\njoyful exploration of the richness of the cosmos. In the end, it\nembodies the emotion that is perhaps most fundamental to philosophy,\nand that is wonder.\n\nAnother implication could be drawn from the values found in the\nfoundational texts that is not found in these texts but emerges in the\ncontemporary context. The Zhuangzi\u2019s lampooning of\nhuman pretension and arrogance, together with call to identify with\nthe whole and with the nonhuman parts of nature, has appealed to those\nseeking philosophical perspectives within which to frame an\nenvironmental ethic (see Girardot, Miller, and Liu, 2001). A Daoist\nperspective offers both an alternative to an instrumentalist approach\nthat would ground an environmental ethic solely in the idea that it\ndefeats human beings\u2019 interests to foul their own environment\nand to an intrinsic value approach that would ground duties to nature\nsolely in a value that it possesses apart from its relation to human\nbeings. A Daoist approach might point to the way that the human traits\nare conditioned by and responses to the nonhuman environment, such\nthat these traits cannot be specified independently of the\nenvironment. In other words the Daoist self is not a substantial\nindependent existence but a relational one whose boundaries extend\ninto the conventionally nonhuman, and from a Daoist perspective that\nis reconstructed to be oriented toward the problem of the environment,\nwe would do well to acknowledge the ways in which whatever we value in\nourselves is connected to the nonhuman (Hourdequin and Wong, 2005;\nHassoun and Wong, 2015). Treating the environment correctly is not\npurely a matter of satisfying conventional human interests such as\nconserving resources for our future consumption, nor need it be a\nmatter of recognizing a value that the environment has in complete\nindependence of its impact on us. It can be a matter of recognizing\nthat who we are cannot be cleanly separated from the nonhuman\nenvironment. Moreover, there is much to be gained from being open to\nthe transformation of our interests if we remain open to new sources\nof satisfaction in the nonhuman environment that currently escape our\nconceptions of the \u201duseful\u201c (recall Huizi and the\ngourds).\n\nNone of this shows that the composers of the classical Daoist texts\nhad an environmental ethic. Goldin (2005b) points out that\nChina does not have a very good history of concern for degradation or\noveruse of the environment and that the Daoist texts express no\nconcern about such matters. As Goldin points out, the Chinese ancients\nsimply had nothing comparable to our environmental problems. It is\npossible to find, however, fundamental attitudes toward the human\nrelationship with nature that in our own time might seem a more\npromising basis for an environmental ethic. These attitudes embody a\ndifferent relationship with nature that is not governed by the\nimperative of ceaseless consumption and the drive to colonize nature\n(see Jonathan Chan, 2009; and Miller, 2017 for further discussion of\nhow Daoism might provide resources for dealing with the contemporary\nenvironmental crisis).\n\nWithin the ancient Chinese tradition,\nthe Zhuangzi is taken to be highly\nunusual  for its celebration of individual freedom. This\nshows in the text\u2019s frequent characterization of social and moral\nnorms as constraining and controlling the individual, as motivating\nsmall-minded condemnation of those who deviate from them. It also\nshows in the text\u2019s rejection of the ideal of social and political\nservice as dangerous to the individual. Jiang (2021) sees the text as\noffering two visions of freedom as counters to such constraint:\nfreedom within the human lifeworld of social relationships; and\nfreedom beyond the human lifeworld. The first is metaphorically\nillustrated by Cook Ding\u2019s effortless, supremely responsive,\nnavigation through the joints and spaces of the ox he is cutting up.\nOne can navigate around social constraints instead of being restricted\nby them. More literally, freedom within the human lifeworld is\nexemplified in the text by friends who enjoy and accept one another\nbut refrain from unwanted interference with each other\u2019s affairs. The\nsecond is to identify with and embrace the inevitable processes of\nchange and transformation, including death and the loss of what is\nmost treasured within the human lifeworld. There are limits to the two\nkinds of freedom Jiang finds in the text: neither, in his view\nincludes the kind of freedom that can be accomplished as a social and\npolitical value through challenging and changing the norms and\ninstitutions that unduly constrain the individual.\n\nLai (2020) distinguishes a third kind of freedom she sees in\nthe Zhuangzi: freedom in\nworking with constraints. On her account, one can\ncultivate the skills needed to match one\u2019s capabilities to act with\nthe situation at hand, which of course includes whatever might be\nregarded as social constraints. But to act by working with\nconstraints is primarily to respond to the situation, which leaves\nopen the question of whether one acts within the\nconstraints, beyond them, or in some other way, perhaps even\nundermining them. This way of construing Zhuangian freedom\nis  compatible with the above discussion of the way the text\nmight be seen as encouraging the freeing of oneself from rigid\npreconceptions of how to understand the world and to be open to other\nways of understanding one\u2019s situation and to other ways of responding\nto it. Valmisa (2021) explicitly connects what she sees as social and\npolitical implications of Zhuangian freedom with the possibility of\nexpanding one\u2019s capabilities to efficaciously deal with constraints\nand to creatively imagine new possibilities. This possibility of a\nsocial and political construal of Zhuangzian values matches Chong\u2019s\n(2016) perspective on the Zhuangzi as including a\nbasic equality among all human beings that is inclusive in spirit and\nopposed to set hierarchical rankings of human beings in terms of\nunequal worth. This matches up with the Zhuangian critique of\nConfucian hierarchies, not only for society and state, but advocating\nfor the individual an egalitarian conception of the parts of a\nperson that puts the heart-mind in conversation with the rest of the\nbody rather than in command (see the entry on\n  mind (heart-mind) in Chinese philosophy).\n5. Legalism (Fajia)\n\nThinkers grouped under what is known in China as the Fajia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6 or Fa tradition are usually known in\nthe West as \u201dLegalists.\u201c This is misleading in that while the term\nfa can mean law, it can also include standards, norms,\nmodels, and methods (see Goldin 2005c, and the entry on \n legalism in Chinese philosophy).\n The English term is also misleading if taken to refer to thinkers who\nshared in common a cohesive set of doctrines when in fact the thinkers\ngrouped under the name have a fairly diverse set of\nideas. Nevertheless, there are some themes that are reasonably\nassociated with some of the most prominent thinkers. One theme is\nperhaps best introduced as the opposite reaction to Analects\n2.3, in which Confucius says that guiding the people by edicts and\nkeeping them in line with punishments will keep them out of trouble\nbut will give them no sense of shame; guiding them by virtue and\nkeeping them in line with the rites will not only give them a sense of\nshame but enable them to reform themselves. In the most prominent\nFajia text, the Hanfeizi (Hanfei lived during the\n3rd century B.C.E. For a translation, see Watson 2003), the\npeople are characterized as far too swayed by their material interests\nto be guided by a sense of shame. People must be guided by clear\nedicts and strong punishments. Furthermore, rulers must be wary of\ntheir ambitious ministers and take care not to reveal their own likes\nand dislikes so as not to be manipulated by their scheming\nsubordinates. As to rulers themselves, it is a mistake to found\ngovernment on the presumption that they are or can become virtuous.\nWhile exceptionally good and exceptionally evil rulers have existed,\nthe vast majority of rulers have been mediocre. Governments must be\nstructured so that it can run satisfactorily, because that is what\nrulers will be like almost always.\n\nThe Confucians held that the remedy to China\u2019s turmoil and chaos\nlay in wise and morally excellent rulers\u2014that moral excellence\nwould ripple downwards from the top and create harmony and prosperity.\nThe Daodejing upholds a vision of an original harmony that\nhuman beings once had, a way that consisted in living in accord with\nthe natural grain of things, and that involves seeking only what one\ntruly needs, not in multiplying useless desires that only agitate and\nultimately make us unhappy. Many in\nthe Fa tradition reject moral and spiritual\ntransformation, of either the Confucian or Laoist kind, as the\nsolution to China\u2019s troubles. Most human beings will remain\nunlovely beings to the end, and governmental structures must be\ndesigned for such beings. Hanfei recommended a highly centralized\ngovernment in which the ruler retains firm control of the \u201dtwo\nhandles\u201c of government: punishment and favor (chapter 7). By\nmaking sure he always has his own hands on these handles, the ruler\nremains in firm control of his ministers. If a minister proposes a way\nto get something done, measure his performance on whether he gets it\ndone in the way he says he will. If not, punish him. The ruler is to\nhold his officials strictly to the definitions of their role\nresponsibilities, so that they are punished not only when they fail to\nperform some of those assigned responsibilities but also when they do\nmore than their assigned responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the text consist of arguments\nsupporting the necessity of governmental structure and the folly of\ndepending on the character of rulers. It\u2019s not just that virtue\nis a rare thing. Even if it appears in a ruler, it is not by itself\nsufficient for achieving a good society. The \u201dFive Vermin\u201c\nchapter (49) does not dispute an assumption that is commonly held\nacross Chinese philosophical schools\u2014that the sage-kings of\nancient times were virtuous and ruled over a harmonious and prosperous\nsociety. It disputes, however, that their virtue was the primary cause\nof this golden age. What about those kings in more recent times who\nwere ren and yi, benevolent and righteous, and who\ngot wiped out for their trouble? Virtue by itself is not the\nexplanation of success or failure. The explanation has much more to do\nwith the scarcity of goods in relation to the number of people. It\nfurther has to do with whether the right sort of structure of roles\nwith attendant powers and privileges is put into place. This structure\ncan optimize the effectiveness of, and limit the damage done by,\npeople who are not especially virtuous or extraordinarily able.\n\nConfucians can give replies to such arguments. In answer to the\nargument that virtue is too rare a thing to depend upon, the most\nobvious reply is that they never promised virtue would be easy.\nIndeed, the canonical texts all stress the difficulty of achieving\nfull virtue. Mencius in particular conceives of moral development as\nextending the natural beginnings of virtue to situations where they\nought to extend but do not currently extend. Confucians might also\nobject that good results will follow from the kind of structure\ndescribed in the Hanfeizi only if persons of good-enough\ncharacter staff it. The Hanfeizi sometimes implicitly\nacknowledges this point and integrates it with a reasonable stress on\nstructure and impersonal administration. In chapter 6 there is\ndiscussion of what is necessary to compensate for a mediocre ruler:\ngetting able people with the right motives to serve that ruler.\nInstitute laws and regulations specifying how these people are\nselected: not on the basis of reputation alone, since that will give\npeople an incentive to curry favor with their associates and\nsubordinates and disregard the ruler; not on the basis of cliques,\nsince that will motivate people only to establish connections rather\nthan acquire the qualifications to perform in office. Specify the\nqualifications clearly in laws and regulations, appoint, promote, and\ndismiss strictly according to these specifications. The law, not the\nruler\u2019s personal views, must form the basis for these actions.\nIn chapter 43, consideration is given to the suggestion that those who\ntake heads in battle should be rewarded with desirable offices. This\nis rejected in cases where the office requires wisdom and ability\nrather than courage. In the end, one wonders whether a good number of\nsuch persons of right motive, competence, courage, wisdom and ability\nare enough, given the highly centralized nature of the government\nrecommended in the Hanfeizi. A lot depends on the ruler who\nwields the \u201dtwo handles\u201c of government. Taken in moderate\ndoses, Hanfeizi arguably provides a needed corrective to the\nConfucian emphasis on character. Structure can be designed with an eye\nto the realistic possibilities for mediocre and bad rulers. The\nConfucian emphasis on discretion in judgment is obviously subject to\nabuse that can be checked by structures that provide a degree of\nimpersonal administration and consistent application of relatively\nclear laws and regulations. The American legal experience seems to\nshow, however, that no set of laws can interpret itself with an eye to\ncomplex situations that are unforeseeable when laws are framed.\nUltimately, stable character and wise discretion are needed.\n\nThe strongest challenge that Legalism raises to virtue ethics is not\nthat stable virtues are impossible to achieve, but that they are not\nrealistic possibilities for most persons, and that therefore lofty\nvirtue ideals cannot provide the basis for a large-scale social ethic.\nEven if these ideals are directed only at an elite that is then\nexpected to lead the rest of the people, the question arises as to\nwhat influence this elite can have on the rest if the majority do not\nhave some attraction to virtue. It is dubious, however, that the\nsolution lies in seeking to make character irrelevant. For a more\nextensive discussion of the Fajia thinkers,\nsee the entry on\n  legalism in Chinese philosophy, \n6. Chinese Buddhist Ethics\n\nBuddhism is not indigenous to China, and it has a long and rich\ntradition of thought and practice in India and in areas other than\nChina. This brief section will focus on ethical aspects of the most\ndistinctive form of Buddhism that developed once it was introduced to\nChina: Chan Buddhism, or as it came to be known later in Japan, Zen.\nIt should be noted, however, that prominent forms of Chinese Buddhism\nalso include Tiantai and Huayan. All three forms of Chinese Buddhism\ndeveloped in interaction with indigenous Chinese thought, especially\nDaoism. Chan developed partly as a response to the perception of some\nChinese Buddhists that Tiantai and Huayan had developed in overly\nscholastic directions with proliferating metaphysical distinctions and\ndoctrines that hinder rather than aid Enlightenment.\n\nThe immediate focus of Buddhist ethics is the problem of suffering,\nand a conception of the self is at the heart of the Buddhist response\nto that problem. The self is conceived as a floating collection of\nvarious psychophysical reactions and responses with no fixed center or\nunchanging ego entity. The usual human conception of self as a fixed\nand unchanging center is a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various\nfeelings, perceptions, ideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a\nconsciousness of the world display a constant interplay and\ninterconnection that leads us to the belief that there is some\ndefinite \u2018I\u2019 that underlies and is independent of the\never-shifting series. But there is only the interacting and\ninterconnected series. Human suffering ultimately stems from a concern\nfor the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self that\nnever existed in the first place. Recognition of the impermanence of\nthe self can lead to release or mitigation of suffering, but the\nrecognition cannot merely be intellectual. It must involve\ntransformation of one\u2019s desires. The belief on some abstract\nlevel, for example, that there are no permanent selves is a belief\nthat can co-exist with having and acting on intense desires to avoid\ndeath, as if death were some evil befalling some underlying\n\u2018I\u2019. Similarly, the intellectual recognition that none of\nthe \u201dthings\u201c of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, can lead to recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. But if the latter recognition is again\nmerely intellectual, one can still have and act on intensely\nself-regarding desires at severe cost to others. In both cases a\ntransformation of desire is what is required in order to go beyond the\nmerely intellectual and to achieve true Enlightenment and meaningful\nrecognition of one\u2019s true nature as impermanent and as\ninterdependent with all other things.\n\nRecall the practical focus and the closeness to pre-theoretical\nexperience that are distinctive of indigenous Chinese philosophy.\nThese traits interacted with Buddhism as it was introduced into China.\nThe \u2018Chan\u2019 in \u201dChan Buddhism\u201c comes from the\nSanskrit \u2018dhyana\u2019 which means meditation. Though\nmeditation practice is not the only practice employed in Chan, its\ncentral role does illustrate the focus on achieving transformation of\none\u2019s desires through experience of the self and the world. This\nkind of transformation is different than reaching intellectual\nconviction through textual study and understanding of argumentation,\nand also different than escape from the world of suffering through\nobliteration of one\u2019s consciousness as an individual being.\nChinese Buddhism in the form of Chan was especially influential in\nputting forward this conception of Enlightenment as lived in this\nworld rather than escaping from it.\n\nDaoism in particular has themes that make it especially appropriate\nfor interaction with Buddhism. Recall the theme that one must keep\ndesires from interfering with one\u2019s attention to the matter at\nhand. Correspondingly, a major theme in Chan is that all forms of\nstriving, especially the very striving for Enlightenment, interfere\nwith attention to one\u2019s true nature (Hui Neng, 638\u2013713,\nPlatform Scripture). Hence the reason for the otherwise\npuzzlingly harsh reactions of Chan masters to the earnest strivings of\ntheir students to reach Enlightenment (Yi Xuan, d. 866, The\nRecorded Conversations of Linji Yi Xuan) especially if such\nstrivings have any tinge of the academic or doctrinal about them\n(Huang Po, d. 850, The Transmission of Mind). Recall also the\ntheme in Daodejing concerning the dao as the source\nof the myriad things. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the nature of\nthe many things brought him to recognize the Many as also the One.\nFinally, recall the skeptical theme in Daoism about the limits of\nconceptualization. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the Many as also\nthe One does not mean that the Many are really only One, but rather\nMany and Once at once, and if we have difficulty making sense of that,\nit is founded in the limits of our conceptualization. Finally, there\nis the same possibility for ambiguity as to whether there is some\nineffable and nonconceptual access to an ultimate reality or whether\nthere is skeptical question that goes all the way down (or all the way\nup?). In the Zhuangzi this ambiguity is quite apparent. And\nthough Chan is usually taken to affirm a foundation in ineffable\naccess (Kasulis, 1986), there are those who argue that a thoroughgoing\nskepticism is truer to its spirit (Wright, 1998).\n\nSince the self is a bundle of changing psychological and physical\nattributes whose boundaries are conventionally established, and since\nits attributes exist only in relation to other things outside its\nconventionally established boundaries, it ought to dampen its\nself-regarding cares and concerns and widen the boundaries of its\nconcerns to embrace all life. This Buddhist reasoning certainly is an\ninteresting way to ground impersonal concern, and it may appeal to\nthose of us who see little plausibility in the idea of Cartesian\nsubstances as fixed ego entities. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear\nthat a metaphysical deconstruction of an essential self assures that\ncare for all others is normatively required. Further, this reasoning\nmay seem to drain all passion from life, and it requires that we\ndampen the attachment we have not only to our selves but also to\nparticular others such as friends and family members. Buddhism is\nespecially well known for its advocacy of detachment, not only from\nmaterial possessions, worldly power and status, but also from\nparticular people and communities. For example, in Ashvaghosha\u2019s\npoem on \u201dNanda the Fair,\u201c the Buddha explains to Nanda\nthat delusion alone ties one person to another (Conze, 1959, 110). The\nargument is that a family is like a group of travelers at an inn who\ncome together for a while and then part. No one belongs to anyone\nelse. A family is held together only as sand is held in a clenched\nfist. A number of Neo-Confucians, such as the Cheng brothers and Zhu\nXi, harshly accused Buddhists of selfishness while not quite squaring\nthat accusation with the ideal of the Boddhisattvas in Mahayana\nBuddhism, who delay their entrance into Nirvana, their final release\nfrom suffering, until all beings are liberated from suffering. What\nthe neo-Confucians might have been saying is that the real appeal of\nBuddhism is to the selfish impulse to save oneself, regardless of what\ntheir doctrines say. \n\nBuddhist traditions are diverse, long-lived, and philosophically\nsophisticated in addressing these questions. Worries about the\ndesirability and realistic possibility of assuming the kind of\ndetached attitude the Buddhists upheld are similar to worries\nraised by Daoist identification with the cosmos. As the discussion of\nZhuangzi and wife suggests, it may be possible to distinguish as an\nalternative to the pure and complete detachment exemplified in\nAshvagosha another kind that is consistent with emotional involvement\nwith others for as long as they are given to us.\n",
