    "main_text": "The Development of Feminist Bioethics || Introduction\n1.1 Introduction\n\nBioethics is the hybrid discipline that attends to the ethical\nimplications of developments in the life sciences, especially\nbiomedical research and practice, public health, the delivery of\nhealthcare services, and the socio-ethical impacts of technology.\nSince it first emerged as a distinct approach in applied philosophy,\nbioethics has blossomed into a substantial interdisciplinary field,\ndrawing on a highly diverse range of scholarship, including\nphilosophy, theology, law, medicine, and the biological sciences, and\nincreasingly turning to the social sciences and humanities.\n\nChronicles of bioethics tend to argue that it originated as a response\nto two main factors. First, medical developments in the mid-twentieth\ncentury raised issues beyond the limits of conventional medical\nethics\u2019 focus on intraprofessional conduct and the\nphysician-patient dyad. Second, this period also saw growing\nrecognition of historical atrocities in medical research (such as the\nexperimentation on inmates of concentration and extermination camps\nduring the Nazi Third Reich that led directly to the Nuremberg\nDoctors\u2019 Trial and, indirectly, to the first set of research\nethics guidelines in the Nuremberg Code of 1947). But this narrative,\nwhile not wrong, omits the broader political and intellectual context\nof the milieu within which bioethics developed. The 1960s saw social\ntransformation in many parts of the world, and in its early days at\nleast, bioethics\u2019 focus on those who might be harmed by medical\npractice reflected these social and cultural changes. Like many young\ndisciplines, it has also been open to a wide range of theoretical and\nmethodological approaches. This may be one reason why feminist\nbioethics was able to develop rapidly and strongly as a distinctive\nsub-field within it.\n",
