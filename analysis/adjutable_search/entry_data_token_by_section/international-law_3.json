    "main_text": "International Law as Law || The Role of Consent in the Formation of Rules of International Law\n2.2 The Role of Consent in the Formation of Rules of International Law\n\nThe most authoritative statement of the sources of international law\nis found in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of\nJustice (ICJ 1945). Neither of the two main sources of international\nlaw there identified\u2014customary international law and\ntreaties\u2014has an obvious counterpart in domestic law. Arguments\nabout the legal character of international law turn, to a significant\ndegree, on how we understand these two methods of law creation to\nfunction.\n\nLegal philosophers writing about international law have often\nproceeded on the basis that both treaty and custom ultimately depend\non state consent. Ronald Dworkin, for example, believed that the idea\nthat a state is subject to international law only insofar as it has\nconsented to be bound by it reflects what \u201cseems to be now\ngenerally accepted by practitioners and scholars of international\nlaw\u201d (Dworkin 2013: 5). The consent-based account of\ninternational law does indeed enjoy wide support among international\nlawyers too. In one 1996 case, the International Court of Justice\ndescribed consent, alongside sovereignty, as \u201cthe very basis\nof international law\u201d (ICJ 1996: para. 21).\n\nBut is the consent-based account correct in a descriptive sense? Does\nit, in other words, accurately reflect the way in which rules of\ninternational law are generated? When one considers how international\nlaw \u201cworks\u201d, in theory as well as in practice, this\naccount begins to unravel. This was noted by H.L.A. Hart in 1961 when\nhe wrote of\n\n\nthe suspicion that the general theory that all international\nobligation is self-imposed has been inspired by too much abstract\ndogma and too little respect for the facts. (Hart 1961 [2012:\n226])\n\n\nState consent does evidently play an important role in the formation\nof treaties. Treaties do not bind states that are not parties to them\nand have not consented to be so bound (Vienna Convention on the Law of\nTreaties, Article 34 [VCLT 1969]). But among treaties too, there are\nimportant caveats. The right to withdraw unilaterally from a treaty,\nwhich would grant states the full force of consent, does not, for\nexample, apply to all treaties. The UN Charter is generally understood\nnot to be open to unilateral withdrawal: member states of the UN can\nbe expelled from the organization, but they cannot leave it\nvoluntarily. Consent to it is thus irrevocable. States may be said to\nhave consented to all of the rules that descend from UN membership\nwhen they first joined the UN, but the UN Charter is not a static body\nof legal obligations; it also governs processes through which rules of\ninternational law come into existence, and are interpreted and\ndeveloped\u2014processes which will take their course after the\nState\u2019s initial consent to be bound by the Charter.\n\nThe consent-based account runs into even greater difficulties when it\ncomes to custom. There is, first, the notion of jus cogens,\ni.e., rules of customary international law (such as the prohibition on\ntorture, genocide and apartheid) which have acquired peremptory status\nand from which no state is permitted to derogate. Dworkin maintained\nthat jus cogens too comes \u201cunder the umbrella of\nconsent\u201d in contemporary international legal doctrine (Dworkin\n2013: 6), but there is nothing in the definition of jus\ncogens in the Vienna Convention that suggests\n this.[1]\n\nNor, contrary to many accounts, is customary international law, or\ncustom, based on consent. Custom is defined in the Statute of the\nInternational Court of Justice as \u201cgeneral practice accepted as\nlaw\u201d (Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article\n38(1)). This definition is normally understood to comprise two\nelements: an objective one, i.e., the practice of States; and a\nsubjective one, i.e., opinio juris, the acceptance of rules\nas custom. Many of the conceptual errors that afflict discussions of\ncustom, with inevitable repercussions for theoretical arguments about\ninternational law, concern its subjective dimension. Two errors are\ncommon. The first one is to think of opinio juris as\nrequiring state consent to a rule of customary international law.\nAcceptance and consent are, however, different concepts. The\nInternational Court of Justice regularly establishes the existence of\nrules of customary international law without specific evidence of\nconsent from the states concerned (Talmon 2015). The second one is to\ndescribe the subjective element as necessarily involving a belief that\na particular practice is already law.\n\nThere are at least two good descriptive reasons to be sceptical about\nboth the belief- and the consent-based theories of customary\ninternational law. First, they cannot explain why newly independent\nstates are bound by rules of custom in respect of which they never had\nan opportunity to give consent or time to form beliefs (Hart 1961\n[2012: 226]). Secondly, neither the consent-based nor the belief-based\naccount of customary international law can adequately explain change\nin customary rules. Under the consent-based theory, the replacement of\na rule of custom with a contrary one would be explained as a\nconsequence of states withdrawing their consent from, and acting in\nbreach of, the prior rule. Under the belief-based approach, a change\nin custom would be explained by error or insincerity on the part of\nstates, either acting on the erroneous belief that a particular rule\nwas one of customary international law or lying about their\nbelief.\n\nThese descriptive questions have a bearing on conceptual argument\nabout the legal character of international law. If the main engines of\nrule-creation function only on the basis of consent, or depend on the\nbelief and subjective mindset of those that those rules are meant to\nconstrain, the legal character of international law would be, at best,\nseverely diminished; or, at worst, lost entirely because international\nlaw would be robbed of the claim to legitimate authority inherent to\nlaw, a claim that its norms are binding simply as legal rather than as\nvoluntarily or otherwise subjectively assumed.\n\nThese questions also have an impact on argument about the legitimacy\ninternational law, which is discussed below, because as observed by\nJohn Tasioulas, such accounts \u201ctarnish[es] the\nlegitimacy of customary international law\u201d (Tasioulas 2014: 331;\nTasioulas 2016), and undermine both the moral and systemic credentials\nof international law.\n",
