    "main_text": "Events and Other Categories || Events vs. Facts\n1.2 Events vs. Facts\n\nNo matter what their relationships, events are naturally contrasted\nwith objects insofar as both are conceived of as individuals.\nBoth appear to be concrete, temporally and spatially located entities\norganized into part-whole hierarchies. Both can be counted, compared,\nquantified over, referred to, and variously described and\nre-described. (It has been argued that our conceptions of these two\ncategories are so closely tied as to be structurally complementary, in\nthat any characterization of the concept event that only\nmentions spatial and temporal features yields a characterization of\nthe concept object by a simple replacement of temporal with\nspatial predicates, and vice versa; see Mayo 1961.) Accordingly,\nevents are generally distinguished from facts, too, which are\ncharacterized by features of abstractness and a-temporality: the event\nof Caesar\u2019s death took place in Rome in 44 BCE, but that Caesar\ndied is a fact here as it is in Rome, today as in 44 BCE (Dodd 2009).\nOne could indeed speculate that for every event there is a companion\nfact, viz. the fact that the event took place (Bennett 1988), but the\ntwo would still be categorially distinct. The death of Caesar must no\nmore be confused with the fact that Caesar died than the Queen of\nEngland should be confused with the fact that England has a Queen\n(Ramsey 1927).\n\nAccording to some authors, this categorial distinction is actually\nreflected in the different sorts of expressions through which facts\nand events are referred to in ordinary language. In the terminology of\nVendler (1967), \u2018Caesar\u2019s death\u2019 is a perfect\nnominal: the process of nominalization is complete and the expression\ncan only be modified by adjectival phrases (\u2018Caesar\u2019s\nviolent death\u2019). By contrast, a gerundive such as\n\u2018Caesar\u2019s dying\u2019, or a that-clause such as\n\u2018that Caesar died\u2019, are imperfect nominals that still have\n\u201ca verb alive and kicking inside them\u201d: they can therefore\ntolerate tenses and auxiliaries (\u2018Caesar\u2019s having\ndied\u2019, \u2018That Caesar might die\u2019), adverbs\n(\u2018Caesar\u2019s dying violently\u2019), negation\n(\u2018Caesar\u2019s not dying\u2019), etc. With some\nqualifications (e.g. McCann 1979), the metaphysical hypothesis would\nbe that, as a norm, perfect nominals stand for events, whereas facts\nor states of affairs are the referents of imperfect nominals.\n\nSome philosophers, however, conceive of the link between events and\nfacts as being much closer than this\u2014close enough to justify\nassimilating the two categories (Wilson 1974; Tegtmeier 2000) or at\nleast treating both as species of the same \u201cstate of\naffairs\u201d genus (Chisholm 1970). This has two main consequences.\nOn the one hand, because facts corresponding to non-equivalent\npropositions are distinct, events conceived of as facts or fact-like\nparticulars are fine-grained entities that cannot be freely\nre-described or re-identified under different conceptualizations: the\nfact that Caesar died violently is different from the fact that he\ndied, hence the death of Caesar and his violent death would be two\ndifferent events (Chisholm 1971), as opposed to one and the same event\nunder different descriptions (Davidson 1969; Anscombe 1979). On the\nother hand, because linguistic expressions of facts are semantically\ntransparent, a Fregean line of argument could be concocted to show\ninstead that events construed as facts are too coarse-grained, to the\npoint of melting into a single \u201cbig\u201d entity (Davidson\n1967a). (The argument is known as the \u201cslingshot\nargument\u201d, following Barwise & Perry 1981; for details, see\nNeale 2001.)\n\nOther philosophers have insisted on distinguishing events from facts\nbut have given accounts that effectively amount to an assimilation.\nThis is true especially of those theories that construe events as\nproperty exemplifications, i.e., exemplifications of\nproperties by objects at times (Kim 1966, 1969;\nMartin 1969; Goldman 1970; Taylor 1985; Hendrickson 2006). On such\ntheories, events are individual entities. But because they have a\nstructure, a difference in any constituent is sufficient to yield a\ndifferent event. In particular, a difference in the relevant\nconstitutive property is sufficient to distinguish events such as\nCaesar\u2019s death, construed as Caesar\u2019s exemplification of\nthe property of dying, and Caesar\u2019s violent death,\nconstrued as his exemplification of the property of dying\nviolently (Kim 1976). Again, this makes events virtually as\nfine-grained as facts. It bears emphasis, however, that this\nconsequence is not intrinsic to the theory of events as property\nexemplifications. Both Caesar\u2019s death and his violent death\ncould be construed as Caesar\u2019s exemplification of one and the\nsame property P, describable both as a dying and\u2014with\ngreater accuracy\u2014as a dying violently. Thus, even if construed\nas a structured complex, an event can be coarsely referred to insofar\nas its names need not be sensitive to this structure (Bennett 1988).\nIn this way, the distinction between events and facts can be\nreinstated in terms of a firm distinction between semantic and\nmetaphysical aspects (respectively) of the theory of\nevent-descriptions.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to those theories that treat events as\nsituations, in the sense familiar from situation semantics (Barwise\n& Perry 1983). On such theories, events are construed as sets of\nfunctions from spatiotemporal locations to \u201csituation\ntypes\u201d defined as sequences of objects standing or failing to\nstand in a certain relation. But while the formal machinery delivers a\nfine-grained account, the algorithm for applying the machinery to\nnatural language sentences leaves room for flexibility.\n",
