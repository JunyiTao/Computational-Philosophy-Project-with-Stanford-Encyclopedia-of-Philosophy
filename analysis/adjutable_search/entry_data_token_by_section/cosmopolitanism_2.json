    "main_text": "History of Cosmopolitanisms || Cosmopolitanism in the 19th and 20th Centuries\n1.3 Cosmopolitanism in the 19th and 20th Centuries\nEnlightenment cosmopolitanism continued to be a source of debate in\nthe subsequent two centuries. First, in the nineteenth century,\neconomic globalization provoked fierce reactions. Marx and Engels tag\ncosmopolitanism as an ideological reflection of capitalism. They\nregard market capitalism as inherently expansive, breaking the bounds\nof the nation-state system, as evidenced by the fact that production\nand consumption had become attuned to faraway lands. In their hands,\nthe word \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 is tied to the effects of\ncapitalist globalization, including especially the bourgeois ideology\nwhich legitimizes \u2018free\u2019 trade in terms of the freedom\nof individuals and mutual benefit, although this very capitalist order\nis the cause of the misery of millions, indeed the cause of the very\nexistence of the proletariat. At the same time, however, Marx and\nEngels also hold that the proletariat in every country shares\nessential features and has common interests, and the Communist\nmovement aims to convince proletarians everywhere of these common\ninterests. Most famously, the Communist Manifesto ends with\nthe call, \u201cProletarians of all countries, unite!\u201d This,\ncombined with the ideal of the class-less society and the expected\nwithering away of the states after the revolution, implies a form of\ncosmopolitanism of its own.\n\n\nDebates about global capitalism and about an international workers\u2019\nmovement have persisted. Frequently economic cosmopolitanism can be\nfound in the advocacy of open markets, in the tradition from Adam Smith\nto Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. Communist versions of\ncosmopolitanism also developed further, although the Leninist-Stalinist\ntradition kept using \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 itself as a derogatory\nterm.\n\n\nThe second inheritance from eighteenth century cosmopolitanism is\nfound in the two centuries\u2019 worth of attempts to create peace. It has\noften been noted that there are parallels between Kant\u2019s peace\nproposal in Toward Perpetual Peace and the structure of the\nLeague of Nations as it existed in the early part of the 20th century\nas well as the structure of the current United Nations, although it\nshould also be pointed out that essential features of Kant\u2019s plan were\nnot implemented, such as the abolition of standing armies. After the end of the cold war, discussion about the most appropriate world order to promote global peace resurged, just as it did after the first and second world wars.\n\n\nThe International Criminal Court should be mentioned here as an\ninnovative form of cosmopolitanism, going much beyond Kant\u2019s\nconception of \u2018cosmopolitan law.\u2019 The ICC itself\nrepresents an extension of the long trend, in international law, to do\naway with the principle of the absolute subjection of individuals to\nthe state and strengthen the status of individuals. Individuals are\nnow the bearers of certain rights under international law, and they\ncan be held responsible for crimes under international law in ways\nthat cut through the shield of state sovereignty.\n\n\nThird, moral philosophers and moralists in the wake of\neighteenth-century cosmopolitanisms have insisted that we human beings\nhave a duty to aid fellow humans in need, regardless of their\ncitizenship status. There is a history of international relief efforts\n(International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, famine relief\norganizations, and the like) in the name of the reduction of human\nsuffering and without regard to the nationality of those affected.\n\n\nIn addition, because cosmopolitan duty is not restricted to duties of\nbeneficence but also requires justice and respect, cosmopolitan values\nand principles have often been invoked as a motivation to oppose\nslavery and apartheid, and to advocate the emancipation of women.\n\n\nMost past cosmopolitan authors did not fully live up to the literal\ninterpretation of their cosmopolitan theories, and one can find\nmisogynist, racist, nationalist, sectarian, or class-based biases and\ninconsistencies in their accounts. These shortcomings have often been\nused as arguments against cosmopolitanism, but they are not as easily\nused for that purpose as it may seem. Because the universalist\npotential in the discourse of \u2018world citizenship\u2019 can\nitself be used as a basis for exposing these shortcomings as\nproblematic, one should say that they stem from too little, rather than\ntoo much, cosmopolitanism.\n",
