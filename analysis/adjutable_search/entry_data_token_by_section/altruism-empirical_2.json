    "main_text": "Altruism and Evolution\n3. Altruism and Evolution\n\nReaders familiar with some of the popular literature on the evolution\nof morality that has appeared in the last few decades might suspect\nthat recent work in evolutionary biology has resolved the debate\nbetween egoists and altruists. For some readers\u2014and some\nwriters\u2014seem to interpret evolutionary theory as showing that\naltruism is biologically impossible. If altruistic organisms were\nsomehow to emerge, this literature sometimes suggests, they would lose\nthe competition for survival and reproduction to their selfish\nconspecifics, and they would quickly become extinct. On this view, any\nappearance of altruism is simply an illusion. In the memorable words\nof biologist Michael Ghiselin (1974: 247) \u201cScratch an\n\u2018altruist\u2019 and watch a \u2018hypocrite\u2019\nbleed\u201d.\n\nBut as Sober and Wilson (1998) have argued with great clarity, there\nis no simple connection between evolutionary theory and the\nphilosophical debate between egoism and altruism. This is because the\nconcept of altruism that is important in evolutionary theory is quite\ndifferent from the standard concept of altruism invoked in the\nphilosophical debate. For biologists, an organism behaves\naltruistically if and only if the behavior in question reduces its own\nfitness while increasing the fitness of one or more other organisms.\nRoughly speaking, an organism\u2019s fitness is a measure of how many\ndescendants it will\n have.[11]\n As Sober and Wilson note, on this evolutionary account of altruism,\nan organism can be altruistic even if it does not have a mind capable\nof having beliefs and desires. Thus there can be no easy inference\nfrom biological altruism to psychological altruism. Nor does the\ninference go in the opposite direction. To make the point, Sober and\nWilson (Ch. 10) note that natural selection might well equip humans or\nother psychologically sophisticated organisms with ultimate desires to\nfoster the welfare of their offspring under certain circumstances.\nOrganisms with these ultimate desires would be psychological\naltruists, though the behavior that the desires gave rise to would\ntypically not be evolutionarily altruistic, since by\nhelping their offspring organisms typically are increasing their own\nfitness. So, contrary to the presumption that evolutionary biology has\nresolved the debate between egoists and altruists in favor of egoism,\nit appears that evolutionary theory little to offer that will support\nthat\n conclusion.[12]\n",
