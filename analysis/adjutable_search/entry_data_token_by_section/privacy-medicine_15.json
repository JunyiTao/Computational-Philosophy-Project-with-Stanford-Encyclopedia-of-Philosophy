    "main_text": "Decisional Privacy || Abortion\n5.2 Abortion\n\nWith the possible exception of the privacy of medical records and\ngenetic information since the 1990s, no issues have linked the concept\nof privacy to medicine more than the issue of abortion rights. Because\nof moral and religious disagreement about abortion, the link beween\nprivacy and abortion rights has been politicized in the United States\nfor decades (Jonsen 1998: 294ff). \n\nAvoiding the concept of privacy as such, Judith Thomson employed the\nconcept of a right to control the use of one\u2019s own body in a\nfamous defense of abortion rights (Thomson 1971). The United States\nSupreme Court popularized privacy grounds for abortion rights when it\nheld in Roe v Wade in 1973 that the constitutional right to\nprivacy requires striking down laws criminalizing medically safe\nabortions. Advocates of a decisional privacy right to abortion\nmaintain that government should not take sides in what is irreducibly\na moral debate, and that individuals should be free to make up their\nown minds about the moral status of the unborn (Richards 1986).\n\nStressing that fetus are not self conscious subjects of experience,\nsome philosophers have denied that fetuses are moral persons with\nrights to life that outweigh women\u2019s privacy rights. Those who oppose\nabortion privacy argue that abortion should not be left to private\nchoice because the unborn are in fact equal members of the moral\ncommunity, along with newborn infants. Membership in the moral\ncommunity is conferred by human status or potential personhood, these\nphilosophers argue. Religious ethicists sometimes characterize the\nunborn as acquiring souls in utero. Some moralists maintain that\nwomen\u2019s decisional privacy must yield if science establishes\nthat a totally unique human life comes into being with fertilization\nof an ovum. In support of moral and legal abortion rights, Peter\nSinger has argued that science proves that unique human lives do not\nbegin at conception. Instead, fertilization begins a process of\ninitially pluripotent cell development that may result in several\nhuman lives, due, e.g., to twinning and other divisions, or in no\nhuman life, due, e.g., to defects that result in spontaneous abortion.\nPhilosophers Margaret Little and Rosalind Hursthouse contributed\nnuance to the ethics of abortion debate by arguing that while autonomy\nand privacy concerns are important, sui generis\nconsiderations of obligation and virtue are ethically relevant to\ndecisions about terminating a pregnancy (Little 1999; Hursthouse\n1991).\n\nThe trend in public policy, dating back to the 1970s in the U.S. and\nmost of Europe, seems to be moral compromise (McDonagh 1996; Sher\n1981). The law tends to permit women to obtain abortions freely in the\nfirst trimester and then to limit access to second and third trimester\nabortions. Philosophical differences in how societies think about\nabortion ethics are reflected in the four major models of abortion\nregulation found around the world. The models of abortion regulation\nare (1) the model of prohibition, banning most abortions, even if\nmedically safe; (2) the model of permission, allowing most abortions\nbut based legislated eligibility criteria rather than choice; (3) the\nmodel of prescription, requiring even unwanted abortions for eugenic\nor population control purposes and (4) the model of privacy, freely\nallowing most abortions chosen by women, with minimal restrictions.\nWhile the U.S. under Roe v. Wade (1973) used to be a nation\nin which the model of privacy prevailed, it has taken on features of a\nmodel of permission regime since 1989 when the U.S. Supreme Court\nannounced it would begin allowing restrictions. The Court has upheld\nrestrictions it deems not unduly restrictive of choice, including\nmandatory waiting periods and bans on specific second and third\nsemester abortion (so-called \u201cpartial birth\u201d)\ntechniques.\n",
