    "main_text": "Polqar and Abner of Burgos: Judaism vs. Christianity || The Messiah: has he already come?\n2.3 The Messiah: has he already come?\n\nDetermining whether or not the messiah to whom Hebrew sources refer\nhas already come, as Christians maintain, could not be demonstrated\nthrough philosophical investigation. It could only be demonstrated by\ninterpreting scriptural verses and rabbinic texts well known to both\nAbner and Polqar, and by examining how the picture of the messiah and\nthe messianic era that emerges from that interpretation coheres or\ndoes not cohere with past empirical events. In other words, Polqar\nchose prophetic verses that show that Jesus did not bring about the\nmessianic era described by the prophets. On the other hand, Abner, who\nsought to prove just the opposite, used the same verses, as well as\nothers, to demonstrate that Jesus and the messianic era he inaugurated\ndid in fact correspond precisely to what the prophets had\ndescribed.\n\nOne of the main differences between Judaism and Christianity is rooted\nin each religion\u2019s approach to the messiah. While Christianity\nconsiders the messiah to be both divine and human, Judaism sees in the\nmessiah a human being of extraordinary character. Christian dogma\neducates its believers to live their lives as if the messiah has\nalready come; their way of living is a preparation for the world to\ncome. In Judaism, the messianic era is located in the future, and it\nfeatures the restoration of Jewish sovereignty over the land of Israel\nand a world in which all nations dwell in peace with one another.\nThus, if the Jews accept the view that Jesus is the messiah, it\nfollows that any hope they maintain for that restoration is only folly\nand illusion.\n\nPolqar presents his theory regarding the messiah in the fifth chapter\nof his Teshuvat Apikoros and in the sixth chapter\n(sha\u2019ar) of treatise one of \u02bfEzer ha-Dat.\nThe texts presented in both works are almost identical, and differ in\nonly two places. The first difference is that the first paragraph in\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat contains a reference to Bil\u02bfam that is\nomitted from Teshuvat\n Apikoros,[13]\n while the second difference is that it is only in Teshuvat\nApikoros that Polqar refers to the Muslims\n(Ishma\u02bfelim); this reference is absent from\n\u02bfEzer\n ha-Dat.[14]\n\nRejecting the claim that the messianic era has already begun, Polqar\nfocuses on three prophetic predictions concerning the nature of the\nmessianic era; none of these, Polqar maintains, have come to pass. The\nfirst is Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy that the Israelites will reside in\nthe land of Israel. Ezekiel foresaw that\n\n\nthey [the Israelites] shall remain in the land which I gave to my\nservant Jacob\u2026they and their children and their\nchildren\u2019s children shall dwell there forever, with my servant\nDavid as their prince for all time.\n\n\nReality, however, shows that the Jews do not reside in the land of\nIsrael. On the contrary, they have suffered a long and painful exile,\nwhile foreigners settled in the land.\n\nThe second prediction concerns the war between Gog and Magog. Ezekiel\nprophesized that only after that war \u201cI [LORD] will be zealous\nfor My holy name\u201d [Ezek. 39:25], and \u201cI will never again\nhide my face from them\u201d [Ezek. 39:29]. The Jews\u2019 dreadful\ncondition proves that the war has not yet occurred, and therefore that\nthe messiah cannot have come. Finally, the third prediction concerns\nthe rebuilding of Jerusalem and the holy temple; as Amos states,\n\u201cIn that day I will set up again the fallen booth of\nDavid\u201d [Amos 9:11]. He also predicts the third ingathering of\nthe Jews: \u201cAnd I will plant them upon their soil nevermore to be\nuprooted from the soil I have given them, says the Lord your\nGod\u201d [Amos 9:15]. The first ingathering was connected with the\nbuilding of the First Temple; the second was connected with the Second\nTemple; the third is to occur upon the building of the Third Temple.\nPolqar cites these verses to indicate that Jerusalem and the Temple\nhave not yet been rebuilt; it follows that this third ingathering has\nnot yet occurred.\n\nBefore quoting the relevant verses from the prophetic books, Polqar\nsets forth two principles that must be taken into account when\nexamining the prophecies. Firstly, he declares that any prophecy\nstating that the Jews will never again be exiled cannot be applied to\nthe Second Temple period, especially if the word \u201cforever\u201d\n[le\u02bfolam] appears in it, insofar as the current\nsituation shows that the Second Temple period was followed by exile.\nSecondly, Polqar states that all of the prophecies concerning the\nSecond Temple period which predict the building of Zion and Jerusalem\ncannot be applied to Jesus, for \u201cthose who believe in him\n[Jesus] are further from him than they are from ruling over that\nland\u201d [Teshuvat Apikoros: 4b]. Merging these two\nprinciples with his interpretation of the prophetic message serves\nPolqar\u2019s goal: rejecting Christianity as a true religion. Abner,\nnot surprisingly, applies these very prophecies to the Second Temple\nperiod and to Jesus (cf. Joseph Shalom in Rosenthal 1961: 44).\nAccording to him, the arrival of the messiah was the final stage in\nestablishing the correct beliefs, which is to say the fundamental\nChristian theological doctrines, in the hearts of human beings. The\nTrinity, he states, was originally concealed from the people of Israel\ndue to its complexity and to the risk it posed: if it were\nmisunderstood, it might lead the Jews to worship idols. The final\nIncarnation, namely the Incarnation in Jesus, would guarantee the\npeople\u2019s belief in reward and punishment in this world and the\nnext.\n",
