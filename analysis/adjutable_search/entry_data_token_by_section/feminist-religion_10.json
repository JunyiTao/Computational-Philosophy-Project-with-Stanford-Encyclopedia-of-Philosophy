    "main_text": "Immanental Themes and Methods || Corporeal Subjectivity\n5.3 Corporeal Subjectivity\n\nThe body, a recurrent theme in a variety of recent interdisciplinary\nstudies, figures as the material or symbolic basis for much feminist\nphilosophy of religion, in contrast to the fiction of disembodied\nsubjectivity that marks mainstream modern epistemology.\n\nOne such body-based study, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz\u2019s work, God\u2019s\nPhallus and Other Problems for Men and Monotheism (1994), is\nindicative of a new alliance of philosophy of religion with gender\nstudies and social theory, rather than with natural theology and\nspeculative metaphysics. Dozens of feminist studies have explored the\nway in which male deities authorize male domination and undermine\nfemale experience in the social order. Left unconsidered was the\nquestion whether a male divinity generates certain dilemmas and\ntensions for the conception of masculinity, rendering its meaning\nunstable. Pursuing this question, Eilberg-Schwartz overturns the\nconventional assumption that Jewish monotheism centered on an\ninvisible, disembodied deity. His analysis of numerous myths shows\nthat ancient Israel did image God in human form, while at the same\ntime veiling the divine phallus.\n\nTwo consequences in particular arise for masculinity in a religious\nsystem that imagines a male deity with a phallus. First, the dilemma\nof homoerotic desire is posed when men worship a male God in a culture\nbased on heterosexual complementarity. Although the expression of\ndivine-human intimacy is couched in the language of male-female\ncomplementarity, it is males, not females, who enter into the\ncovenantal marriage with the deity. Collectively, Israelite men were\nconstituted discursively as \u201cshe\u201d, and said to be\n\u201cwhoring\u201d when they strayed from monotheism (monogamy)\ninto idolatry (adultery). Suppression of the homoerotic impulse in the\ndivine-human relationship, however, could take several forms: hiding\nand veiling the body of God through prohibitions against depicting\nGod; feminizing Israelite males so that they could assume the role of\nGod\u2019s wife; and exaggerating the way in which women are\n\u201cother\u201d so as to minimize the ways in which men are made\ninto others of God.\n\nThe solution of imagining Israel as a metaphorical woman, in an\nexclusive relation to the divine maleness, may have solved the first\ndilemma of homoerotic desire only by generating another. The second\nmajor dilemma for masculinity, according to Eilberg-Schwartz, is posed\nby being made in the image of a sexless Father God in a culture\ndefined by patrilineal descent. The sexlessness of a Creator Father\nGod sets up major tensions for men who must pro-create. In contrast to\nthe Christian religion, whose different logic of a God fathering a Son\ncould render a human father irrelevant, Hebrew logic placed great\nimportance on the human father, generating tension around a Father God\nwho was thought to be sexless and therefore without a son. When the\ndilemma of homoerotic desire is posed later for Christian men in\nrelation to a male Christ\u2019s body, it, too, is avoided by speaking\ncollectively of the Christian community as a woman.\n\nFeminist philosophy of religion has yet to explore fully the question\nof how a male God is problematic for men\u2019s conceptions of self,\naccording to Eilberg-Schwartz. It has also left unthought the\ndifference between God as male and God as Father. Strict focus on the\nways in which a masculine image of God undermines female experience\ntends to conflate human and divine masculinities into one\nundifferentiated symbol. Eilberg-Schwartz differentiates between\nimages of male deities and images of father deities, contending that\nthe maleness of God may have different implications than the\nfatherliness of God. Fatherly images of God can and should be used, he\nargues, \u201cbut only if equally powerful female images are also\ncelebrated\u201d (1994: 239). Repudiating the incorporeal, distant\nGod that helped to generate the hierarchical associations of\nmasculinity and femininity, he favors an image of \u201ca tender\nloving Father who faces and embraces the child\u201d, in the apparent\nexpectation that a loving and embodied God may support a different\nkind of masculinity, one more capable of intimacy and tenderness\n(1994: 240).\n",
