    "main_text": "How does contractualism differ from utilitarianism? || Reasonable Rejection\n3.1 Reasonable Rejection\n\nIn order to reasonably reject a principle, I must have some objection\nto it. This objection may begin with some direct harm I suffer as a\nresult of the principle. So far, if the harm involved is pain or\nsuffering, contractualism mirrors utilitarianism. However, the fact\nthat a principle impacts negatively on me is not sufficient.\nTo know whether I can reasonably reject the principle, I must\nalso ask how it impacts on others. If a principle imposes a certain\nburden (b1) on me, but every alternative imposes a greater\nburden (b2) on someone else, then b1 does not give\nme a reason to reject the principle. If I am reasonable, then I\nwithdraw my objection when I see that your reason is more pressing.\n(By contrast, it would make no sense to say that a utilitarian has\n\u2018withdrawn her pain\u2019 because she has noticed that someone\nelse\u2019s pain is greater.) So we conclude that the principle\nimposing b1 on me cannot be reasonably rejected. And we reach\nthis conclusion without having to aggregate anything.\n\nIn contractualism, individuals are motivated both by self-regard and\nby respect for others. Since each person is partly motivated by\nconcern for her own interests, contractualism can ground\nconsequentialist reasons. Part of what we owe others is to promote\ntheir interests. Contractualism can therefore accommodate important\nconsequentialist aspects of the structure of moral thought.\n\nUnlike utilitarianism, however, the account of value underlying\ncontractualism does not claim that there is only one rational attitude\nto have towards value. So contractualism can accommodate\nconsequentialist aspects without being a completely consequentialist\ntheory. (This represents an advantage of contractualism over\nna\u00efve versions of Kantian ethics, which reject all\nconsequentialist reasons and thus make it very difficult to explain\nwhy the consequences of our actions have any moral significance at\nall.) In contrast to an outcome ethics (such as utilitarianism), what\nis foundational for contractualism is not minimising what is\nundesirable, but considering what principles no-one could reasonably\nreject. Moral principles are grounded in the idea of living with\nothers on terms of mutual respect. This means that as well as\naccommodating some consequentialist aspects, contractualism can also\naccommodate certain deontological intuitions: commonsense prohibitions\nagainst treating persons in certain ways even in circumstances in\nwhich the aggregate value of the consequences of doing so is very\ngreat. Which prohibitions are justified? This question \u201cis best\nanswered by considering what principles licensing others to take our\nlives could be reasonably rejected\u201d (Scanlon 1998, p. 85). Among\nthese principles might be ones that involve \u201caccepting a certain\nview of the reasons one has: that the positive value of saving others\ndoes not justify killing someone\u201d (Scanlon 1998, p. 84).\n",
