    "main_text": "The Search for a Philosophical Foundation for Marxism and the Radical Subject || Phenomenological Marxism\n3.1 Phenomenological Marxism\n\n\nInspired by his reading of Heidegger\u2019s Being and\nTime, and having already been influenced by Marxism during his\nmilitary days, Marcuse went to Freiberg to study with Heidegger in\n1928. Between 1928 and 1932 he attempted to develop what has been\ncalled Heideggerian or phenomenological Marxism. This project was\nMarcuse\u2019s response to what has been called the \u201ccrisis of\nMarxism.\u201d \n\nBy the early twentieth century it appeared to be the case that\nthe proletarian revolution predicted by Marx was not going to\nhappen. Europe had witnessed several failed attempts at a\nrevolution. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was not lead by the\nproletariat and it simply produced a different form of\ntotalitarianism.\n\n Marcuse undoubtedly accepted Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s trenchant\ncritique of the authoritarian implications of Lenin\u2019s\nvanguardism. In fact, most European socialists viewed Lenin\u2019s\nvoluntarism as inappropriate for Western and Central Europe, where a\nmore advanced and experienced proletariat existed. (Wolin 2005: xiv)\n\n\nThis situation produced the political crisis of Marxism.\n\nThe political crisis of Marxism was entangled with its\nepistemological crisis (Wolin 2005: xiv). The\nepistemological crisis was the result of the scientific reductionism\nof Marxism which was encouraged by Engels and Karl Kautsky (Marcuse\n2005: xiv). So-called scientific Marxism is a non-philosophical,\nmechanistic form of Marxist theory that teaches the inevitable,\nautomatic collapse of capitalism. This form of theory ends up being\nnon-revolutionary to the extent that the \u201csubjective factor of\nworking class consciousness is down played\u201d (Marcuse\n2005: xiv). The Second International produced a form of positivism that\neliminated the dialectical approach of Marxism and erased the role of\nhuman subjectivity. That is, if the collapse of capitalism was\ninevitable because of the effects of certain natural laws and not due\nto the conscious, intentional efforts of the proletariat, then there\nis no need to work toward the development of revolutionary\nconsciousness. \n Marcuse\u2019s entire project can be seen as an attempt to rescue\nradical, socially transformative subjectivity. He gravitates toward\nMarxism because Marxism is an attempt to rescue subjectivity or\nhumanity from the reifying, oppressive forces of capitalism.\nUnfortunately, the Marxism of the Second International also erased\nhuman subjectivity as this form of Marxism became mechanistic in\nnature. It is in this context, where subjectivity and human agency are\nbeing whittled down, that Marcuse turns to Heidegger for a possible\nsolution. Marcuse saw in Marx and Heidegger \u201ca demand for\nradical action\u201d (Wolin 2001: 146). \n\n\nFor Marx, it took the form of \u201cpraxis,\u201d\n\u201crevolutionary, practical-critical activity.\u201d On the basis\nof authentic temporality, Dasein, too, demanded a radical\nresponse to the realities of alienated social existence. (Wolin 2001: 147)\n\nFor Marcuse, radical action was needed to overcome the oppressive,\nrepressive, and reified structure of advanced industrial society. He\nsaw common ground between Marx and Heidegger regarding this\nproblem. At this point in his career, Marcuse read the oppressive\nstructure of advanced industrial society through three lenses, the\nMarxian lens of alienation, The Luk\u00e1csian lens of reification,\nand the Heideggerian lens of inauthenticity. Although Marx\u2019s\n1844 Manuscripts which includes a discussion of alienation\nwere not yet available to Marcuse when he went to Freiburg,\nMarx\u2019s theory of alienation is implicit in various places in\nvolume one of Capital where he discusses the reduction of\nsocial relations between persons to the relations between things while\nthe relations between things are treated as social relations.\n\n\nThus, Marcuse believed that Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time\nrepresented a potentially valuable ally in the struggle against the\nreified social continuum of advanced industrial society. He\nconjectured that Heidegger\u2019s philosophy of existence possessed\nthe conceptual means required to counteract an inverted social world\nin which, according to Marx, \u201csocial relations between men\nassume\u2026the fantastic form of a relation between\nthings.\u201d In part, Marcuse read Heidegger\u2019s philosophy\nas an ontologically veiled critique of reification: an\nindictment of the way in which oppressive social circumstances\nmilitate against the possibility of human self-realization. It seemed\nthat, like the critical Marxists Luk\u00e1cs and Korsch, Heidegger\nstrove to surmount the fetishization of appearances that characterized\nthe shadow-world of bourgeois immediacy. Like Luk\u00e1cs and\nKorsch, in Being and Time Heidegger strove concertedly to\nbreak with the deterministic worldview of bourgeois science, in which\nhuman being or Dasein was degraded to the status of a\n\u201dthing among things.\u201c After all, this was the main point\nbehind Heidegger\u2019s critique of Vorhandenheit or being\npresent-at-hand as a mode of inauthenticity. (Wolin 2005:\nxiv\u2013xv). \n\nMarcuse\u2019s reading of Marx, Heidegger, Luk\u00e1cs, Korsch, and\neven Max Weber is based on his quest for radical or revolutionary\nsubjectivity. Like Horkheimer and Adorno, Marcuse saw western\nsociety as moving in the direction of a totally administered\nsociety. His later notion of one-dimensionality was developed\nvia his critique of such a society. However, he\neventually became disillusioned with Heidegger.\n\nEven while under Heidegger\u2019s influence Marcuse was never a mere\nHeideggerian. He recognized early on that Heidegger\u2019s philosophy\nhad certain limitations. He would eventually discover that\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy was not all that concrete. While\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy explicated the ontological structure of\nDasein in its everydayness, it never dwelled at the ontic\nlevel. At the ontological level Heidegger merely examined the\nfundamental structures of Dasein. That is, Dasein in\ngeneral carries out its life within a certain universal structure\nwhich is constituted by modes of existence such as fallenness, idle\ntalk, boredom, care, being toward death, etc. What has been disclosed\nhere are mere universal conditions or modes of existence in which\nDasein happens and experiences happenings. However, these\nmodes of existence are experienced in different ways, at different\ntimes, and with different levels of intensity by different\nindividuals. \n\nAt the end of the day, Marcuse sees that Heidegger avoids the type of\nanalyses that would reveal systems of oppression and domination from\nwhich many human beings suffer. The modes of existence for\nDasein have a social, historical, and political context that\nshape the way they are experienced. For example, Dasein has a\nrace, gender, class, etc. These particular features come with specific\nsocial interpretations which affect Dasein\u2019s\nlife\u2019s prospects. According to Marcuse, Heidegger\u2019s\nDasein is a sociologically and biologically neutral category\n(Marcuse 2005b: 167). Heidegger gives no account of the multiple forms\nof oppression and domination present in advanced industrial societies\nnor the way that individuals respond to these forms of oppression and\ndomination. In a 1977 interview conducted by Frederick A. Olafson,\nMarcuse raises the following criticism of Heidegger:\n\n\nHow does the individual situate himself and see himself in\ncapitalism\u2014at a certain stage of capitalism, under socialism, as\na member of this or that class, and so on? This entire dimension is\nabsent. To be sure, Dasein is constituted in historicity, but\nHeidegger focuses on individuals purged of the hidden and not so\nhidden injuries of their class, their work, their recreation, purged\nof the injuries they suffer from their society. There is no trace of\nthe daily rebellion, of the striving for liberation. The Man\n(the anonymous anyone) is no substitute for the social reality\n(Marcuse 2005b: 169) \n\n Hence, Heidegger\u2019s concrete philosophy is not so concrete as\nhe defines human beings and their historicity in such a way that omits\nthe real, concrete struggles in which social actors find\nthemselves. In the same interview quoted above, Marcuse claims that he\nand others realized that \u201cHeidegger\u2019s concreteness was to\na great extent a phony, false concreteness,\u201d removed from\nreality (Marcuse 2005b: 166)\n\nWe can see now that the very thing that drew Marcuse to\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy was missing. Heidegger\u2019s philosophy\nfailed to provide Marcuse with a concrete philosophical foundation for\nMarxism as well as a theory of the radical act or radical\nsubjectivity. Heidegger\u2019s interest with Nazism made it easy for\nMarcuse to leave Heidegger in 1932. This move was also made easy by\nthe publication of Marx\u2019s 1844 Manuscripts first\npublished in 1932. \n Although Marcuse breaks with Heidegger in 1932, for some scholars\nthe break is not all that clear. Martin Jay claims that when Marcuse\njoined the Institute, the influence of Horkheimer was so great that\nMarcuse \u201cabandoned Heidegger\u2019s vocabulary, as the impact\nof phenomenology on his thinking began to recede\u201d (Jay\n1973: 76). However, in a letter to Horkheimer on May 13, 1935, Adorno\nstrongly suggests that Marcuse was still a Heideggerian\n(Marcuse/Kellner 1998: 16 n.22). One must, however, maintain some level\nof suspicion of Adorno\u2019s claim since he and Marcuse were engaged\nin competition for Horkheimer\u2019s favor. Nevertheless, the\nquestion of Marcuse\u2019s Heideggerianism is still of interests for\nMarcuse scholars. For example, Richard Wolin writes: \u201cIn\nMarcuse\u2019s postwar writings, the Heideggerian dimension is muted\nbut nevertheless traceable\u201d (Wolin 2001: 167). \n\nDoes Marcuse continue to employ Heideggerian ideas in a new language?\nIs Marcuse\u2019s critique of one-dimensionality nothing more than a\nHeideggerian critique of inauthenticity? Both terms refer to \u201ca\nmass society of blind conformity\u201d (Wolin 2001: 168). Wolin also\nraises the question of parallels between Heidegger\u2019s ontological\nelitism and Marcuse\u2019s notion of an \u201ceducational\ndictatorship\u201d (Wolin 2001: 172). The issue of an educational\ndictatorship occurs in Eros and Civilization (1955) as well\nas in \u201cRepressive Tolerance\u201d (1965) and reflects\nMarcuse\u2019s pessimism about the development of radical\nconsciousness in the working class. The problem of some form of\nintellectual elitism is not only found in Heidegger but in Marxism\nitself. One need only think about Lenin\u2019s notion of the\nVanguard. However, whether the source be Heidegger or certain\nMarxists, the wave toward elitism, in one form or another, remains a\nproblem in Marcuse\u2019s work.  \n",
