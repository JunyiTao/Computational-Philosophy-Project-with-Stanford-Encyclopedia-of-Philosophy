    "main_text": "The Exchange\n5. The Exchange\n\nOn December 2, 1910, Jones delivered a paper to the Cambridge Moral\nSciences Club, titled \u201cCategorical Propositions and the Law of\nIdentity\u201d (later published, under a different title, as Jones\n1911a). Russell responded at a meeting three months later, on March\n10, 1911, delivering \u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription\u201d. While Russell did not acknowledge being influenced\nby Jones in his earlier work, nor did he compare her view to\nFrege\u2019s, it is significant that he took her work seriously\nenough to merit a public response, one that would be recorded in one\nof his most influential papers.\n\nThe main point of their exchange concerns the following well-known\npassage in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d:\n\nIf a is identical with b, whatever is true of one is\ntrue of the other, and either may be substituted for the other in any\nproposition without altering the truth or falsehood of that\nproposition. Now George IV wished to know whether Scott was the author\nof Waverley; and in fact Scott was the author of\nWaverley. Hence, we may substitute Scott for the\nauthor of \u2018Waverley\u2019, and thereby prove that George\nIV wished to know whether Scott was Scott. Yet an interest in the law\nof identity can hardly be attributed to the first gentleman of Europe.\n(Russell 1905b, 420)\n\n\nOf this passage, Jones writes:\n\n\nWhen George IV asked whether Scott was the author of\nWaverley, what he wanted to know was, whether the intension\n(\u2018meaning\u2019, connotation) of Author of\n\u2018Waverley\u2019 could be assigned to\nScott\u2014i.e.,\u2014whether identity of denotation could\nbe asserted between Scott and Author of\n\u2018Waverley\u2019. The \u201cfirst gentleman of\nEurope\u201d did not want to know whether Scott was Scott \u2026\n.\n\nNo doubt, \u2018if a is identical [in denotation] with\nb,\u2019 whatever is true of the thing denoted by a\nis true of the same thing denoted by\nb\u2014with the obvious reservation that\na is a does not convey the information that a has\nthe intension (or connotation) b. (Jones 1910a, 379\u201380;\nthe insertion is Jones\u2019s) \n\n\nI quote Russell\u2019s response at length:\n\n\nMiss Jones argues that \u2018Scott is the Author of\nWaverley\u2019 asserts identity of denotation between\nScott and the author of Waverley. But there is some\ndifficulty in choosing among alternative meanings of this contention.\nIn the first place, it should be observed that the Author of\nWaverley is not a mere name, like Scott.\nScott is merely a noise, or shape conventionally used to\ndesignate a certain person; it gives no information about that person,\nand has nothing that can be called meaning as opposed to denotation.\n(I neglect the fact, considered above, that names, as a rule, really\nstand for descriptions.) But the author of Waverley is not\nmerely conventionally a name for Scott; the element of mere convention\nbelongs here to the separate words, the and author\nand of and Waverley. Given what these words stand\nfor, the author of Waverley is no longer arbitrary. When it\nis said that Scott is the author of Waverley, we are not\nstating that these are two names for one man, as we should be\nif we said \u2018Scott is Sir Walter\u2019. A man\u2019s name is\nwhat he is called, but however much Scott had been called the author\nof Waverley, that would not have made him be the author; it\nwas necessary for him to actually write Waverley, which was a\nfact having nothing to do with names. (Russell 1910\u201311,\n27\u201328) \n\n\nThis passage expands on a point made in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d,\nwhere Russell writes:\n\nNow the relation of meaning and denotation is not merely linguistic\nthrough the phrase: there must be a logical relation involved, which\nwe express by saying that the meaning denotes the denotation. (Russell\n1905b, 421)\n\n\nIn his response, Russell explains why it is that the relation between\na name and its referent is \u201cmerely linguistic through the\nphrase\u201d, whereas the relation between a description and its\ndenotation must be \u201clogical\u201d. The relation between a name\n\u00df and what it stands for is (merely) linguistic in that it is\nacceptable to specify what \u00df stands for with the phrase\n\u2018the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019. The reason that it\nis acceptable is because \u00df has its reference or denotation\ndetermined conventionally. Thus, since no analysis is possible, all we\ncan do is state the brute fact captured by the schema \u2018\u00df\nstands for the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019. In contrast, the\nrelation between a description and what it denotes is\nlogical\u2014the denotation relation is constrained by the\nmeanings of the constituents of the description and their mode of\ncombination. Thus, if \u00df is a description, \u2018\u00df stands\nfor the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019 does not state a brute\nfact about our use of \u00df. Rather, it states a fact that holds in\nvirtue of other facts\u2014facts about the meanings of\n\u00df\u2019s constituents and their mode of combination.\n\nA bit later, he continues:\n\nIf we are to say, as Miss Jones does, that \u2018Scott is the author\nof Waverley\u2019 asserts an identity of denotation, we must\nregard the denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019\nas the denotation of what is meant by \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019. Let us call the meaning of \u2018the author\nof Waverley\u2019 M. Thus M is what\n\u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 means. Then we are to\nsuppose that \u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019\nmeans \u2018Scott is the denotation of M\u2019. But here we\nare explaining our proposition by another of the same form, and thus\nhave made no progress towards a real explanation. \u2018The\ndenotation of M\u2019, like \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019\u00b8 has both meaning and denotation, on\nthe theory we are examining. If we call its meaning M\u2032,\nour proposition becomes \u2018Scott is the denotation of\nM\u2032\u2019. But this leads to an endless regress. Thus\nthe attempt to regard our proposition as asserting identity of\ndenotation breaks down, and it becomes imperative to find some other\nanalysis. When this analysis has been completed, we shall be able to\nreinterpret the phrase \u2018identity of denotation\u2019, which\nremains obscure so long as it is taken as fundamental. (Russell\n1910\u201311, 28\u201329)\n\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this. Russell is here evaluating a hypothesis\naccording to which a description such as \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 is, contrary to his own view, meaningful in\n isolation.[5]\n To assume that this description is meaningful in isolation is to\nassume that, for some M, \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 means M. Let\u2019s call this\nmeaning M*. Since we accept the following:\n\nThe denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 = the\ndenotation of what is meant by \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019\n\n\nwe also accept\n\nThe denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 = the\ndenotation of M*\n\n\nNow the meaning-in-isolation theorist might suggest that our original\nsentence, \u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019,\nmeans that Scott is the denotation of M*. But, as Russell\nobserves, all this does is to replace one description with another.\nSince the theorist fails to tell us what \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 means in terms that don\u2019t involve an\nexpression equally in need of analysis, we have been given no evidence\nthat this, or any, description is meaningful in isolation.\n\nJones responds:\n\nMr. Russell explains my meaning to be that the denotation of The\nauthor of Waverley is the denotation of what is meant by\nthe author of Waverley. But I do not accept this. Meaning,\nintension, of author is authorship; denotation of\nauthor is person of whom authorship is an attribute.\nI do not see from the fact of one proposition being explained by\nanother of the same form \u2026 it follows that we \u201chave made\nno progress towards a real explanation.\u201d This would seem to\ninvolve that one categorical proposition cannot be explained by other\ncategorical propositions. (Jones 1910\u201311, 183\u2013184)\n\n\nJones rejects the proposal that what is denoted by the F =\nwhat is denoted by the meaning of \u2018the F\u2019. While\nher reasoning is obscure, the point seems to be that these\ndescriptions cannot co-refer, since they involve different\nconcepts\u2014one, but not the other, involves the concept of\ndenotation. The point is confused, however; clearly, the descriptions\nare co-denoting\u2014relative to the assumption that \u2018the\nmeaning of the F\u2019 has a denotation.\n\nHer second point is more intriguing: Jones objects to the regress\nargument\u2019s conclusion that no real explanation of the\nmeaning of denoting phrases can be achieved if we explain a\nproposition containing such a phrase with another proposition\ncontaining a phrase of the same form. Once again, however, the point\nis undeveloped. Nonetheless, it is implied that a categorical\nproposition can indeed be explained by another categorical\nproposition, so from the fact that p and q share the\nsame form it does not follow that (e.g.) q fails to explain\np (in the relevant sense of \u2018explain\u2019). (Recall\nthat she takes all categorical propositions to possess the same form.)\nEchoing Jones\u2019s sentiment, R. M. Sainsbury writes, \u201cit is\nunclear what sort of explanation is needed, and why the circularity is\nvicious. This objection [i.e., Russell\u2019s] must be regarded as\ntherefore inconclusive\u201d (Sainsbury 1979, 105). (Broad (1912)\nresponds similarly.) Hylton (1990, 252\u201353), on the other hand,\nargues quite persuasively that there is a vicious regress\nhere (Hylton\u2019s remarks are concerned specifically with the\npassage in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, however).\n\nThe point is developed further in Jones\u2019s reply to Broad (1912),\nresponding to Jones (1910\u201311):\n\n\nIf I say that the import of, e.g. Scott is the Author of\nWaverley, is to assert identity of denotation with diversity\nof intension, I can of course also say that: What is denoted by\n\u2018what is denoted by \u201cScott\u201d\u2019, is identical\nwith what is denoted by \u2018what is denoted by \u201cAuthor of\nWaverley\u201d\u2019. As Mr. Broad suggests, the repetition\nin Subject and Predicate is ineffective, and\n\n(1)\n Scott\n(2)\n What is denoted by \u2018Scott\u2019\n(3)\n What is denoted by \u2018What is denoted by\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019\n\n\nhave all three the same identical denotation.\n\n(1\u2032)\n Scott is the Author of Waverley.\n\n\nIf my analysis (as far as denotation is concerned) is applied to this,\nwe get:\u2014\n\n(2\u2032)\n What is denoted by \u2018Scott\u2019 is identical with what is\ndenoted by \u2018Author of Waverley\u2019. \n\n\nIf the same analysis is applied to (2) we have :\u2014\n\n(3\u2032)\n What is denoted by \u2018What is denoted by\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019 is identical with what is denoted by\n\u2018what is denoted by \u201cAuthor of\nWaverley\u201d\u2019, \n\n\nand so on. We have simply a repetition, for each successive more\ncomplicated proposition, of the analysis adopted.\n\nI think that a regress equally \u201cinfinite,\u201d equally\ninevitable, equally innocuous, equally useless, would emerge in the\ncase of any propositional analysis treated in the same way\u2026\n(Jones 1913, 528) \n\n\nJones seems to miss an important point here. The existence of a\nsequence such as (1\u2032)\u2013(3\u2032) is predicted on both\nanalyses\u2014one according to which \u2018Author of\nWaverley\u2019 (or \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019) has meaning in isolation, and one according\nto which it does not. Thus, the inevitability of the sequence is of no\nconsequence, as it fails to tell against Russell\u2019s theory.\n\nTo see this, note that Russell could easily acknowledge that a\nsequence of the following form will exist when\n\u2018a\u2019 is either a name or a definite\ndescription\n\na is the referent of \u2018a\u2019\n\na is the referent of \u201cthe referent of \u2018a\u2019\u201d\n\na is the referent of \u2018the referent of \u201cthe\nreferent of \u2018a\u2019\u201d\u2019\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nIn the case of names, the first clause provides the ultimate\nexplanation for the truth of each succeeding clause. This is not true,\nhowever, when \u2018a\u2019 is a description.\n\nConsider, for example, the following segment of an infinite\nsequence:\n\n(4)\n Scott\n(5)\n the referent of \u2018Scott\u2019\n(6)\n the referent of \u2018the referent of\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019\n\n\nWe can say that:\n\n(4*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (4).\n(5*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (5).\n(6*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (6).\n\n\nNotice, however, that each member of the latter sequence\nafter (4*) holds because (4*) holds. (Unless, of\ncourse, one wants to deny that even \u2018Scott\u2019 has meaning in\nisolation; but this is obviously not Jones\u2019s position.) That is,\n\u2018Scott\u2019 refers to the referent of \u2018Scott\u2019\n(i.e., (5)) because \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to Scott (i.e.,\n(4)).\n\nNow consider the following initial segment of an infinite sequence,\n(7)\u2013(9), together with the corresponding reference assignments,\n(7*)\u2013(9*):\n\n(7)\n the author of Waverly \n(8)\n the referent of \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019\n(9)\n the referent of \u2018the referent of \u201cthe author of\nWaverly\u201d\u2019\n(7*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (7)\n(8*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (8)\n(9*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (9)\n\n\nHere we see a contrast with (4*)\u2013(6*): to explain the fact\nreported by (8*) by citing the fact reported by (7*) is unsatisfying,\nsince (7*) is left unexplained. Moreover, (7*), unlike (4*), does not\nstate a brute semantic fact\u2013a fact that cannot be further\nexplained in semantic terms. It is clear that, if \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 is a singular term and, contra Russell, has\nmeaning in isolation, then the relation between it and its denotation,\nScott, cannot be like the one that obtains between \u2018Scott\u2019 and\nScott.\n\nThis disanalogy between the two cases may not settle the case in\nRussell\u2019s favor\u2014perhaps, \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019, like \u2018Scott\u2019, is\nmeaningful in isolation after all, even though its meaning (or\ndenotation), unlike that of \u2018Scott\u2019, can\u2019t be\nassigned directly (indeed, Richard Montague provided the tools for\nconstructing precisely such a meaning). Even so, Jones is wrong in\nthinking that the mere existence of a sequence such as (7*)\u2013(9*)\nis dispositive.\n",
