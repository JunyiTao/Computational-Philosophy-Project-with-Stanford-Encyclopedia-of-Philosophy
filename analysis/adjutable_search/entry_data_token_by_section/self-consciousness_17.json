    "main_text": "The Conditions of Self-Consciousness || Self-Consciousness and Intersubjectivity\n4.4 Self-Consciousness and Intersubjectivity\n\nWhat is the connection between self-consciousness and the awareness of\nothers? On some views self-consciousness requires awareness of others,\non another view the awareness of others requires self-consciousness.\nIn each case we can distinguish between those accounts according to\nwhich such awareness is merely an empirical condition from those\naccording to which it is a strictly necessary/sufficient condition.\nThere is also a distinction to be made regarding the sense of\n\u201cawareness of others\u201d that is in play: whilst some\nphilosophers are concerned with knowledge of other minds, others are\ncontent with the representation of others, veridical or not.\n\nA familiar account of our knowledge of others takes the form of an\nargument from analogy (Slote 1970: ch. 4; Avramides 2001: part I). The\nargument from analogy presents an account of our justification for\nmoving from judgements about others\u2019 observable behaviour to\njudgements about their unobservable mental states. I am aware from my\nown case that, say, wincing is the result of pain so, on seeing\nanother\u2019s wincing, I am justified in judging them to be in pain.\nOn this picture, self-awareness, as manifest in the judgement about my\nown case, is a necessary condition of knowledge of other minds. In\nthis respect the view is related to contemporary simulation theory,\nstandard versions of which see our capacity to attribute mental states\nto others as dependent on our capacity to attribute them to ourselves\n(Heal 1986; Goldman 2006: ch. 9; for a simulationist theory that\ndiffers in this respect, see Gordon 1996). Associated with the\nargument from analogy is a view according to which our grasp of mental\nstate concepts is an essentially first-personal affair. That is, we\nunderstand what, for example, pain is first from our own case (Nagel\n1986: \u00a72.3; Peacocke 2008: ch. 5\u20136; it has sometimes been\nclaimed that this view gives rise to the conceptual problem of other\nminds, see Wittgenstein 1958: \u00a7302; McGinn 1984; Avramides 2001:\npart II).\n\nIn opposition to this package stand views on which our grasp and\napplication of mental state concepts is neutral between the first and\nthird-person cases. Theory theorists, for example, claim that we\nattribute mental states to both ourselves and others by means of a\n(tacitly held) psychological theory. They may also hold that\npossession of such a theory constitutes our grasp of mental state\nconcepts (Carruthers 1996, 2011: ch. 8; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997;\nfor an account that combines elements of theory with elements of\nsimulation, see Nichols & Stich 2003). While such views accord no\npriority to the first-person case, they may see a tight connection\nbetween self-consciousness and our capacity to think about others:\nthese are simply two aspects of the more general capacity to think\nabout the mind. A distinct, though related, family of views see both\nself-consciousness and awareness of others as emerging from a\nprimitive \u201cadualist\u201d state in which self and other are not\ndistinguished (Piaget 1937; Merleau-Ponty 1960; Barresi & Moore\n1996; Hurley 2005; Gallese 2005; also see D. Stern 1985: part II).\nAgainst such \u201cadualist\u201d views, it is often claimed the\nphenomena of neonate imitation, joint attention, and emotion\nregulation show that infants display an awareness of others as\nothers from the very beginning of life (Meltzoff & Moore\n1977; Trevarthen 1979; Hurley & Chater 2005; Eilan et al. 2005;\nLegerstee 2005; Reddy 2008). One empirical proposal is that it is from\nthis early form of social interaction and capacity to understand\nothers that self-consciousness emerges as a self-directed form of\nmindreading (Carruthers 2011; Carruthers, Fletcher, & Ritchie\n2012; for an early such account, see Mead 1934). On such a view the\nfirst-person case is treated as secondary, reversing the traditional\npicture associated with the argument from analogy.\n\nA more ambitious version of this approach to the relationship between\nself-consciousness and awareness of others, prioritizing the awareness\nof others, is to argue that knowledge of other minds is a necessary\ncondition of the possibility of self-consciousness. Well known\nexamples of such arguments can be found in the work of P.F. Strawson\n(1959: ch. 3) and Davidson (1991; for the related Hegelian view that\nvarious forms of self-consciousness depend on intersubjective\nrecognition, see Honneth 1995). Since knowledge of other minds is\ntypically considered to be open to sceptical doubt, and\nself-consciousness is not, such lines of reasoning are transcendental\narguments and so potentially open to general criticisms of that form\nof argument (Stroud 1968; R. Stern 1999, 2000). Strawson\u2019s\nargument hinges on his claim that \n\n\nthe idea of a predicate is correlative with that of a range\nof distinguishable individuals of which the predicate can be\nsignificantly, though not necessarily truly, affirmed. (P.F. Strawson\n1959: 99; cf. Evans\u2019 generality constraint, 1982: \u00a74.3)\n\n\n\nThis means, Strawson claims, that one can only ascribe mental states\nto oneself if one is capable of ascribing them to others which, in\nturn, means that I cannot have gained the capacity to think of\nothers\u2019 mental states by means of an analogical reasoning from\nmy own case. This, Strawson argues, shows that others\u2019\nobservable behaviour is not a \u201csign\u201d of their mentality,\nbut is a \u201ccriterion\u201d of it. In short, we must have\nknowledge of others\u2019 minds if we are self-conscious (for the\nfull argument, see P.F. Strawson 1959: 105ff; for critical discussion,\nsee R. Stern 2000: ch. 6; Sacks 2005; Joel Smith 2011).\n\nDavidson\u2019s transcendental argument\u2014the triangulation\nargument\u2014connects self-consciousness, knowledge of other minds,\nand knowledge of the external world. At its heart is the claim that\nfor my thoughts to have determinate content there must exist another\nsubject who is able to interpret me. As Davidson puts it, \n\n\nit takes two points of view to give a location to the cause of a\nthought, and thus to define its content [\u2026] Until a base line\nhas been established by communication with someone else, there is no\npoint in saying one\u2019s own thoughts or words have a propositional\ncontent. (Davidson 1991: 212\u2013213) \n\n\nSince self-conscious subjects are aware of the contents of their\nthoughts, they must know that there are other minds, since the sort of\nintersubjective externalism that Davidson endorses guarantees it.\nSelf-knowledge, on this view, entails knowledge of others (for\ndiscussion, see R. Stern 2000: ch. 6; Sosa 2003; Ludwig 2011).\n",
