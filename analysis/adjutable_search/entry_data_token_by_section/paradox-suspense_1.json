    "main_text": "Entertained Uncertainty\n2. Entertained Uncertainty\n\n\nNo\u00ebl Carroll qualifies the first claim of the paradox; he argues\nthat suspense merely requires entertained uncertainty, not \nactual uncertainty (Carroll 2001). In \u201cThe Paradox of \nSuspense,\u201d Carroll offers a persuasive account of how we might \ndissolve this paradox. He argues that even if we know that a film \nwill end a certain way, we can still imagine while watching it, that \nit will not end that way. He argues that merely imagining that an \nevent\u2019s outcome is uncertain is enough to create suspense, thereby \nqualifying the first premise of the paradox\u2014only entertained \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense. \n\n\nNarrative, according to Carroll, is something akin to guided \nimagination, a process he describes as entertaining thoughts or \nholding propositions non-assertively (Carroll 1990). People can work \nthemselves into a variety of emotional states by merely imagining \nsituations that they know are untrue, such as being passed over for a\npromotion, cheated on by one\u2019s spouse, or having one\u2019s child \nkidnapped. The thought theory of emotional response is the \ntheory that fiction taps this power of the imagination for its energy\nto produce emotional reactions. This seems to solve the paradox of \nsuspense, since we can know that the hero will not die, but still \nfear the outcome simply by imagining that he might. On this view, \nsuspense does not require genuine uncertainty, only entertained \nuncertainty. Although we cannot be genuinely uncertain about the \noutcome of a familiar narrative, we can willfully entertain \nuncertainty. And we can entertain uncertainty on any number of \nencounters with the same story. \n\n\nAlthough Carroll\u2019s thought theory seems to explain how it is possible\nto feel suspense in response to a familiar narrative, it does not \ngive an explanation for the typical scenario of diminishing suspense.\nIf all it takes is entertained uncertainty (in addition to the \nunnamed other contributing factors), why do some fictions loose their\npower for many viewers? A perfectly willing viewer may eagerly sit \ndown to re-watch a suspenseful film without feeling nearly the same \namount of suspense as on the first viewing. This scenario\u2014that \nof diminishing returns (to the same narrative)\u2014is not merely \npossible, it is common. This shows that entertained uncertainty is \ninsufficient for recidivist suspense\u2014suspense felt \nin response to a familiar narrative. Perhaps the defender of the \nentertained uncertainty theory could reply by simply supplementing \nthe theory with an account of why it becomes more difficult or just \nless likely for audiences to entertain narrative outcomes as \nuncertain the more familiar they are with a story. \n\n\nRegardless, the theory faces bigger problems, one of which is that \nthere is reason to believe that entertained uncertainty is not \nnecessary for suspense. There are numerous cases where knowledge of \nthe outcome can make a narrative more, not less suspenseful. For \ninstance, the first time one watches Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho \n(1960), one may feel mild fear for Marion Crane as she chats with \nNorman Bates in the hotel office. Filled with stuffed, menacing \nbirds, the office creates an aura of danger, but viewers have no \nreason to suspect that in the next couple of minutes Norman will bury\na carving knife in Marion\u2019s chest as she showers. However, on a \nsecond viewing, one feels a great deal more suspense during the \noffice scene. Norman\u2019s disturbance seems obvious on repeated \nviewings. How could Marion fail to see it? One wants to scream \u201cGet \nout of there!\u201d The reason why the office scene in Psycho is \nmore suspenseful on subsequent viewings cannot be that audiences are \nentertaining the idea that the outcome is as uncertain as it was on \ntheir first viewing, since the first viewing is not as suspenseful as\nthe second. \n\n\nThis objection rests on the claim that normal people do indeed feel \nsuspense on the second viewing of Psycho, but one might simply\ndeny this claim. Perhaps audiences merely feel tension or \nanticipation, but not suspense. As we shall see, this is precisely \nwhat defenders of the emotional misidentification view say in \nresponse to all reports of recidivist suspense. If the defender of the \nentertained uncertainty view were to make a similar response to cases\nlike that of Psycho\u2014cases where one seemingly feels more\nsuspense when the outcome is certain\u2014she risks undermining the \nsupport for her central claim that recidivist suspense is common. \nThe defender of entertained uncertainty would owe us a clear \nexplanation for why we should trust the phenomenology in some cases \nand not in others. \n\n\nHowever, if we trust the phenomenology, if we trust audience members\u2019\naccounts of what they feel when they watch Psycho, then we \nhave additional reason to reject the claim of the paradox\u2014the \nclaim that suspense requires uncertainty. But we lack an explanation \nfor how this is possible. The next theory that we will consider \nattempts to provide an answer. \n",
