    "main_text": "Theories of Attention || General-Purpose Prioritization\n2.4 General-Purpose Prioritization\n\nIn the tradition perpetuated by Wu, the selectivity of attention is\nunderstood as providing a solution to one particular problem, created\nby the fact that there are multiple courses of action that might be\ntaken at any time, with the taking of any one requiring the others to\nbe suppressed. The solving of this particular problem is not the only\ncognitive need that could be served by an operation of selectivity,\neven in a mind without bottlenecks of processing capacity. The\nselection-for-action theory is therefore not the only alternative to\nBroadbent\u2019s bottleneck theory. Other functions for attentional\nselectivity might also be proposed. Alternatively\u2014rather than\nelecting any one of these functions of cognitive selectivity as being\nthe function that is essentially served by attention\u2014we might\ninstead characterize attention as a quite general process of\nselectivity, recruitable on any of the various occasions when one\nthing needs to prioritized over another, whether this prioritization\nis required by the presence of a processing bottleneck, required in\norder for a coherent action-plan to be executed, or required for some\nquite different reason. The work of Sebastian Watzl develops the idea\nthat attention might be such a non-specific process of prioritization\n(Watzl, 2017).\n\nIn Watzl\u2019s treatment of it, this idea places particular emphasis\non the fact that, just as a binary \u2018is greater than\u2019\nrelation can introduce a partial ordering on a set, so a number of\nthese binary prioritizations can be considered in sum, as introducing\na prioritization structure on the several items that together\nconstitute one\u2019s mental life. For Watzl, attention is the\nprocess by which one\u2019s life comes to have such a structure.\n\nWatzl also claims that any mind which lacked such a structure would\ntherefore be lacking a particular perspective on the world, and so\nwould not be the mind of a creature with the subjective point of view\nthat is characteristic of conscious experiences. From this he derives\nthe claim that every conscious creature is attentive. Carolyn Jennings\nhas suggested that certain kinds of highly engaged expert performance\nmay be a counterexample to this (Jennings, 2015).\n",
