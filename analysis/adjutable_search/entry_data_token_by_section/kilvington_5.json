    "main_text": "Theology\n6. Theology\n\nIn theology, Kilvington applied the new methods of terminist logic and\nmathematics to the most popular issues discussed in the\nfourteenth-century, such as human and divine love, human and divine\nwill, God\u2019s absolute and ordained power and human free decision,\ndivine knowledge of future contingents and predestination. Nothing is\nconsidered separately from the Creator; therefore, Kilvington relates\neach human action to God. Kilvington\u2019s questions on the\nSentences testify to his involvement in the lively,\ncontemporary discussions with semi-Pelagians. Thomas Bradwardine\nargued with John Duns Scotus, William Ockham, Adam Wodeham, Robert\nHolcot, and Thomas Buckingham, all of whom he regarded as Pelagians.\nIn his commentary on the Sentences, on which he lectured in\n1332\u20131333, Ockham was the theologian he most fiercely attacked.\nKilvington most likely lectured on the Sentences in the same\nyear. It also seems obvious that each took part in other's lectures as\nsocii. In his question Utrum actus volunatis per se malus\nsit per aliquid, Kilvington debates and criticizes\nBradwardine\u2019s views (see Jung & Micha\u0142owska 2022: 6).\n\nKilvington repeatedly cites the opinions of Augustine and Anselm,\nwhich he usually accepts completely, only sometimes reinterpreting\nthem according to his theory. For Kilvington, however, the greatest\nauthority is John Duns Scotus, whose views he fully accepts and\nsuccessfully develops. First of all, Kilvington adopts Scotus\u2019s\ndistinction (Ord. I, d. 44, q. u.) between the absolute and\nordained power of God:\n\n\nI say along with Scotus, in Sentences I, distinction 44, that\nGod\u2019s power is called ordained insofar as it is the principle of\ndoing something in conformity with right law with regard to the\nestablished order. God\u2019s power is called absolute insofar as it\nexceeds God\u2019s ordained power, because by virtue of it God can\nact against the established order. Generally, I say that by virtue of\nabsolute power God can do everything that is not contradictory. Thence\njurists use the terms de facto and de iure in a\nsimilar manner, for example, a king can do de facto that\nwhich is not in accordance with law and does not agree with it.\nGod\u2019s power is called ordained insofar as it is a principle for\ndoing something in conformity with a right law with regard to the\nestablished order (DV: 168).\n\n\nThe established order of nature is the result of God\u2019s ordained\npower, but God can also act against this order by his absolute power.\nIn Kilvington\u2019s opinion, both of God\u2019s powers are\nintensively infinite simpliciter, but even so, God\u2019s\nabsolute power is infinitely greater than, i.e., infinitely more\npowerful than, his ordained power.\n\nLike Scotus, Kilvington is convinced that potentia dei\nabsoluta is a power that really is or can be actualized by God.\nMiracles would be examples of God acting against the natural order.\nIndividual situations also show that God can deviate from laws\nestablished in the natural order, reflecting God\u2019s particular\njudgment.\n\nKilvington\u2019s theory of potentia dei absoluta\nand\u00a0ordinata serves to underline the contingency of\ncreation and the freedom of divine will. Here Kilvington abridges\nScotus\u2019s opinions (Lectura I, dist. 39) and reorders\nhis arguments, taking into account only those most useful for his own\ntheory. Kilvington claims that God\u2019s knowledge, existence, and\nwill are the same as God\u2019s essence. However, with regard to\nGod\u2019s absolute knowledge, assertoric statements about the past\nand present and contingent statements about the future have the same\ncertainty since they are absolutely necessary, whereas with regard to\nthe God\u2019s ordained knowledge, they have only ordained\nnecessity:\n\n\n[I]t can be said that God not always knows with the same certainty\nwhat came about and that which is going to come about. <It\u00a0is\nso,> because God\u2019s knowledge is equally certain with regard\nto future contingents as with regard to necessary events; however, it\nis possible for divine knowledge not to be certain with regard to\nGod\u2019s creatures, because a creature <i. e., a human> can\nknow that (s)he is sitting with as much certainty as that a human is\nan animal. Still, one certainty concerns contingent and the other\nnecessary things. Therefore, this consequence is false:\n\u2018<God> knows with equal certainty that which happened and\nthat which is going to happen\u2019. Yet, it may happen that\n<God> does not know the things that are going to happen, and\nthus <God> may not know the things that happened. This\nconclusion, however, is true by virtue of God\u2019s absolute power.\nAnd by virtue of God\u2019s ordained power it does not follow that\nall events (past, future, and present) are equally known by God (DV:\n182).\n\n\nKilvington\u2019s affinity to Scotus may also be seen in his theory\nof future contingents. He is in agreement with Scotus\n(Lectura I, dist. 39, qq. 1\u20135) in saying that only an\ninstant in time is present since only the \u2018now\u2019 exists.\nTherefore, Aquinas\u2019s analogy to God sitting at the center of a\ncircle and being present to the whole of time fails, whereas\nScotus\u2019s concept of a radius sweeping out the circumference of\nthe circle is correct, since the entire circle does not exist all at\nonce. He quotes Scotus verbatim:\n\n\nGod is \u201clike the center and all time flowing from the past to\nthe future <is> like the circumference, and no matter how the\ncircumference moves, it is always equally distant from the center, and\nno matter whether time flows into the past or the future, it is always\nthe present time to God\u201d (DV: 183).\n\n\nConsequently, \u2018now\u2019 moving in one way or another, moves\nlike a point on the circumference of a circle.\n\nKilvington, like Scotus, also rejects the view that God knows future\ncontingents via Ideas because Ideas necessarily represent what they\nrepresent, as in the sentence, \u201cSocrates is white\u201d, where\nit is said that Socrates is white. Although Kilvington does not\nexplain his position clearly, it seems that he takes for granted\nScotus\u2019s explanation (DV: 178). Scotus says that perhaps Ideas\ncould represent simple or complexes terms necessarily, although, as\nChris Schabel puts it: \u201cThey could not represent contingent\ncomplexes (\u2026), which we can call X. If God had the\nIdea only, eternally he would know only part of the contradiction, and\nthere would be no contingency. If He knew both parts, X and\n~X , He would know contradictories to be true simultaneously.\nSecond, since Ideas represent both futures that are possible but will\nnot exist, and futures that are possible and will exist, one needs to\nposit a way to distinguish between what will exist and what will not\nexist\u201d (Schabel 2000: 42).\n\nKilvington is also in agreement with Scotus when saying that secondary\ncauses cannot originate any contingency because of the necessity in a\nchain of causes. Therefore, a contingency observed in the action of\nsecondary causes must be routed to the first cause, which is God. To\nknow contingents, God first has to choose one of two contrary\nstatements, since otherwise, i.e., when God had an act of knowledge\nbefore his act of will, he would have had only necessary ordained\nknowledge about the natural order, which he has already established,\nand he would not know contingents. Consequently, God would have only\npartial knowledge about one side of a contradiction (i.e., he would\nknow only one of two contradictory statements, e.g., \u201cAntichrist\nwill be\u201d or \u201cAntichrist will not be\u201d), and his will\nwould not be absolutely free. Therefore, contingency must be located\nin God\u2019s will and not in God\u2019s intellect. Kilvington\nbelieves that future contingent events are such because God knows that\nthey are future contingents and not vice versa. God\u2019s accepting\n(beneplacitum) will, with respect to future contingents, is\nnaturally prior to God\u2019s knowledge, because the following\nconsequence is true, \u201cGod wants A to happen; therefore,\nGod knows it will happen,\u201d whereas this is false, \u201cGod\nknows it will happen (viz., that Socrates will sin); therefore, he\nwants him to sin\u201d (DV: 175).\n\nFollowing Scotus, Kilvington maintains that at the same instant in\nwhich the divine will wills A, it is able not to will\nA, and thus he accepts Scotus\u2019s synchronic contingency;\nnevertheless, he does accept Scotus\u2019 concept of instantiae\nnaturae. To save God\u2019s absolute free will and at the same\ntime to avoid the prospect of mutability in God\u2019s\ndecision-making, Kilvington asserts that by his absolute power God can\nmake himself not will A, while A is what God, by his\nordained power, wills in that particular instant, and this happens in\neternity. Such internal acts of God do not cause any changes in\nhis\u00a0external acts, since God\u2019s will is immutable.\nConsequently, by his absolute power, God can undo the past without\ncausing any change in history, such as, for example, Abraham\u2019s\nnon-existence. God, whose absolute power is infinitely infinite, can\ncause the past not to be the past, because there is no past for God.\nTo say that God cannot undo the past simply means that God has not\nrevealed a given thing, such as the restoration of one\u2019s lost\nvirginity. It is also not contradictory for God\u2019s absolute power\nto create the world from eternity, or to annihilate it. The\nworld\u2019s annihilation would not be less just than its continued\nexistence, since God\u2019s justice stems from his essence, which,\nlike his power, is absolute and ordained. However, God cannot do so by\nhis ordained power, since, even being infinite, his ordained power is\ninfinitely less powerful than his absolute power.\n\nKilvington believes that not only God\u2019s will but also\nGod\u2019s knowledge is contingent with regard to future contingents.\nThis produces a distinction between types of prophecies, with some of\nthem being absolutely necessary and others being conditionally\nnecessary and in this way contingent. Everything absolutely and\nunconditionally revealed by God necessarily comes about with ordained\nnecessity. Everything revealed by God\u2019s ordained\npower\u2014e.g., articles of faith\u2014depends on God\u2019s will\nand could be changed. Once revealed, however, they would have ordained\nnecessity, and so they would form a new law. The contingency ad\nutrumlibet of future events is guaranteed by the conditions under\nwhich such future events come about. Although God absolutely foreknows\nthat something will come about by absolute and ordained power, he\nreveals it absolutely with regard to circumstances, that is,\nconditionally. In conditional revelation, the change of status from\nbeing contingent to not being contingent is warranted by the\nconditions. When the revealed conditions are fulfilled, the future\nevent will no longer be contingent. The same concerns future\ncontingent deeds. Solely those foretold by God are necessary, but the\nothers are not because they depend on people\u2019s voluntary\nchoices. Nothing that depends on created free will ad\nutrumlibet\u00a0can be revealed absolutely relative to\nGod\u2019s ordained power (see Jung & Micha\u0142owska 2022:\n62\u201363 )\n\nLike the divine will, human free will is endowed with absolute and\nordained power to perform good and bad deeds. Kilvington argues that\nGod produces the substance of people\u2019s volitional act, that is,\ntheir ability to make choices, and interacts with human free will to\nintensify good deeds and to produce certain degrees of these acts. He\nargues that if free will were solely responsible for the degree of its\nact, then someone could love God whether endowed with grace or not,\nand someone without grace could love God above everything else, which\nis absurd. God only contributes to the performance of good deeds, and\nevil deeds result from the choices of human free will alone, because\n\u201ctruly we are good because of God, and <we are> evil all\nby ourselves.\u201d(Jung & Micha\u0142owska 2022: 46) It is\nobvious, however, that even if humans perform good deeds, God does not\nhave to take them into account or reward humans for their meritorious\nacts. People cannot be the primary cause of their reward, but they are\nthe primary cause of their punishment because they voluntarily make\nwrong choices and perform evil acts.\u00a0The capacity to sin\ntestifies to the freedom of people to make free choices (see\nJung & Micha\u0142owska 2022: 51\u201352 )\n\nIn his discussion of predestination, Kilvington again appears to be\nfollowing Duns Scotus, who maintains that predestination is simply a\nchoice of salvation and as such has only positive connotations.\nReprobation is solely a consequence of human misdeeds. God is the\nprimary and sole cause of predestination from eternity, but he also\ntakes into account the conduct of creatures, that is, their good or\nbad use of free will. Kilvington does not accept the concept of double\npredestination. The good use of free will, which is a concomitant act\nof the intellect, may be a partial cause of predestination when it\ncomes to the decision on baptism. The bad use of free will is the\nprimary cause of sin and punishment and the only cause of the\ncondemnation of adults who are endowed with grace. Although God is the\nfirst cause of people being accepted without any preceding merit or\nredemption, God is not the first cause revoking grace without any\npreceding demerit. That is because justification and acceptance are\nthe same as God\u2019s goodness and clemency (that is, God\u2019s\nsubstance), whereas forsaking and rejection are merely acts of\nGod\u2019s righteousness (that is, God\u2019s justice). Therefore,\nthe evil deeds of grace-filled adults are the only reason why God, by\ndivine righteousness, abandons\u00a0people (see\nJung & Micha\u0142owska 2022: 56\u201357)\n\nIn Kilvington\u2019s Sentences commentary, there are also\nmany places where he appears to follow Ockham, and while Scotus is\noften cited by name, Ockham remains in the background. Still,\nknowledge of both Scotus and Ockham is crucial to understanding\nKilvington\u2019s thought, as his own contributions are often the\nresult of blending these two strands of fourteenth-century Franciscan\ntheology.\n",
