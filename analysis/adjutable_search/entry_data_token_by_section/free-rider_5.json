    "main_text": "Democracy\n5. Democracy\n\n\nThe logic of collective action has become one of the richest areas\nof research and theory in rational choice theory in the social sciences\nand philosophy. Much of that literature focuses on the explanation of\nvaried social actions and outcomes, including spontaneous actions,\nsocial norms, and large institutions. One of its main areas is efforts\nto explain behavior in elections. In general, voting seems clearly to\nbe a case of collective action for the mutual benefit of all those who\nsupport a particular candidate or whose interests would be furthered by\nthat candidate\u2019s election. If voting entails costs to individuals\nwhereas the benefit from voting is essentially a collective benefit\nonly very weakly dependent on any individual\u2019s vote, individuals may\nfind it in their interest not to vote (Downs 1957). When the number of\nvoters on one side of an election is in the tens of millions, no\nindividual\u2019s vote is likely to matter at all. Even though it is not\nnarrowly in their own individual interest to do so if there are any\ncosts to be borne in going to the polls to vote and in learning enough\nabout various candidates to know which ones would further a voter\u2019s\ninterests, millions of people vote. This is one of the most notorious\nfailures of the rational choice literature. A standard response to the\nphenomenon of massive voting is to note how cheap the action is and how\nmuch public effort is expended in exhorting citizens to vote. But it\nseems likely that much of the voting we see is normatively\nmotivated.\n\n\nBoth the voting that does happen and the non-voting or free riding\nthat accompanies it as well as the level of ignorance of voters call\nsimple normative theories or views of democracy into question.\n\u201cThe will of the people\u201d is a notoriously hallowed phrase\nthat is vitiated by logical fallacy and that is generally meaningless\nas a supposed characterization of democracy, in which decisions are\nmajoritarian and not unanimous (Kant [1796] 1970, 101; Maitland [1875]\n2000, 101\u2013112). It might on rare occasion be true that the people are\nin virtually unanimous agreement on some important policy so that they\nshare the same will on that issue. But generally, there is a diversity\nof views and even deep conflict over significant policies in modern\npluralist democracies. In large societies, democracy is invariably\nrepresentative democracy except on issues that are put to direct\npopular vote in referendums. Even this term,\n\u201crepresentative,\u201d is gutted by logical fallacy. My\nrepresentative on some governmental body is apt to work on behalf of my\ninterests some of the time and against them some of the time. Even\nthose for whom I vote often work against my interests; and if they\nshould be said to represent me, they often do a very bad job of it.\n\n\nNote that, as mentioned earlier, the election of a candidate is a good\nwhose provision is a step function of the number of votes. If there\nare n votes cast, then half of n \u2212 1 votes spells defeat\nand half of n + 1 spells victory. If, as Mayor Daley did with\nthe Chicago votes in the US presidential election of 1960, I could\nwithhold my vote until all others have been counted, my vote might\nactually tip the result to victory for my candidate. In actual fact,\nthe typical voter casts a vote in a state of ignorance about the final\ncount. I might readily expect the margin to be very large or I might\nexpect it to be very narrow. But I am unlikely to expect it to be\ntied, so that my own vote would be decisive. Hence, although the\nactual provision is a step function, my vote or my free riding must be\nbased on some sense of the expected effect of my vote, and that must\ngenerally be minuscule for any election in a large electorate. With\nextremely high probability, my vote is likely to have no effect.\n",
