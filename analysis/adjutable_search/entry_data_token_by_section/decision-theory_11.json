    "main_text": "Challenges to EU theory || On risk and regret attitudes\n5.1 On risk and regret attitudes\n\nExpected utility theory has been criticised for not allowing for value\ninteractions between outcomes in different, mutually incompatible\nstates of the world. For instance, recall that when deciding between\ntwo risky options you should, according to Savage\u2019s version of\nthe theory, ignore the states of the world where the two options\nresult in the same outcome. That seems very reasonable if we can\nassume separability between outcomes in different states of\nthe world, i.e., if the contribution that an outcome in one state of\nthe world makes towards the overall value of an option is independent\nof what other outcomes the option might result in. For then identical\noutcomes (with equal probabilities) should cancel each other out in a\ncomparison of two options, which would entail that if two options\nshare an outcome in some state of the world, then when comparing the\noptions, it does not matter what that shared outcome is.\n\nThe Allais paradox, discussed in\n Section 2.3\n above, is a classic example where the aforementioned separability\nseems to fail. For ease of reference, the options that generate the\nparadox are reproduced as Table 3. Recall from\n Section 2.3\n that people tend to prefer \\(L_2\\) over \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_3\\) over\n\\(L_4\\)\u2014an attitude that has been called Allais\u2019\npreferences\u2014in violation of expected utility theory. The\nviolation occurs precisely because the contributions that some of\nthese outcomes make towards the overall value of an option is not\nindependent of the other outcomes that the option can have. Compare\nthe extra chance of outcome $0 that \\(L_1\\) has over \\(L_2\\) with the\nsame extra chance of $0 that \\(L_3\\) has over \\(L_4\\). Many people\nthink that this extra chance counts more heavily in the first\ncomparison than the latter, i.e., that an extra 0.01 chance of $0\ncontributes a greater negative value to \\(L_1\\) than to \\(L_3\\). Some\nexplain this by pointing out that the regret one would\nexperience by winning nothing when one could have had $2400 for\nsure\u2014i.e., when choosing \\(L_1\\) over \\(L_2\\) and the first\nticket is drawn\u2014is much greater than the regret one would\nexperience by winning nothing when the option one turned down also had\na high chance of resulting in $0\u2014such as when choosing \\(L_3\\)\nover \\(L_4\\) (see, e.g., Loomes and Sugden 1982). But whether or not\nthe preference in question should be explained by the potential for\nregret, it would seem that the desirability of the $0-outcome depends\non what could (or would) otherwise have been; in violation of the\naforementioned assumption of separability. (See Thoma 2020a for a\nrecent extensive discussion of this assumption.) \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_1\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$2400 \n\n\\(L_2\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$2400 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_3\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$0 \n\n\\(L_4\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$0 \n\n\nTable 3. Allais\u2019 paradox\n\n\nVarious attempts have been made to make Allais\u2019 preferences\ncompatible with some version of expected utility theory. A common\nresponse is to suggest that the choice problem has been incorrectly\ndescribed. If it really is rational to evaluate $0 differently\ndepending on which lottery it is part of, then perhaps this should be\naccounted for in the description of the outcomes (Broome 1991a). For\ninstance, we could add a variable to the $0 outcome that \\(L_1\\) might\nresult in to represent the extra regret or risk associate with that\noutcome compared to the $0 outcomes from the other lotteries (as done\nin\n Table 4).\n If we do that, Allais\u2019 preferences are no longer inconsistent\nwith EU theory. The simplest way to see this is to note that when we\nignore the state of the world where the options that are being\ncompared have the same outcome (i.e., when we ignore the last column\nin Table 4), \\(L_1\\) is no longer identical to \\(L_3\\), which means\nthat the Independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgenstern (and\nSavage\u2019s Sure Thing Principle) no longer requires that one\nprefer \\(L_2\\) over \\(L_1\\) only if one prefers \\(L_4\\) over\n\\(L_3\\).\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_1\\)\n$0 + \\(\\delta\\)\n$2500\n$2400 \n\n\\(L_2\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$2400 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_3\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$0 \n\n\\(L_4\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$0 \n\n\nTable 4. Allais\u2019 paradox\nre-described\n\n\nThe above \u201cre-description strategy\u201d could be employed\nwhenever the value and/or contribution of an outcome depends on other\npossible outcomes: just describe the outcomes in a way that accounts\nfor this dependency. But more worryingly, the strategy could be\nemployed whenever one comes across any violation of expected\nutility theory or other theories of rationality (as discussed in\n Section 4.2).\n \n\nLara Buchak (2013) has recently developed a decision theory that can\naccommodate Allais\u2019 preferences without re-describing the\noutcomes. On Buchak\u2019s interpretation, the explanation for\nAllais\u2019 preferences is not the different value that the\noutcome $0 has depending on what lottery it is part of. The outcome\nitself has the same value. However, the contribution that $0\nmakes towards the overall value of an option partly depends on what\nother outcomes are possible, she suggests, which reflects the fact\nthat the option-risk that the possibility of $0 generates depends on\nwhat other outcomes the option might result in. To accommodate\nAllais\u2019 preferences (and other intuitively rational attitudes to\nrisk that violate EU theory), Buchak introduces a risk\nfunction that represents people\u2019s willingness to trade\nchances of something good for risks of something bad. And she shows\nthat if an agent satisfies a particular set of axioms, which is\nessentially Savage\u2019s except that the Sure Thing Principle is\nreplaced with a strictly weaker one, then the agent\u2019s\npreferences can be represented as maximising risk weighted\nexpected utility; which is essentially Savage-style expected\nutility weighted by a risk function.\n\nBradley and Stef\u00e1nsson (2017) also develop a new decision\ntheory partly in response to the Allais paradox. But unlike Buchak,\nthey suggest that what explains Allais\u2019 preferences is that the\nvalue of wining nothing from a chosen lottery partly depends on what\nwould have happened had one chosen differently. To accommodate this,\nthey extend the Boolean algebra in Jeffrey\u2019s decision theory to\ncounterfactual propositions, and show that Jeffrey\u2019s\nextended theory can represent the value-dependencies one often finds\nbetween counterfactual and actual outcomes. In particular, their\ntheory can capture the intuition that the (un)desirability of winning\nnothing partly depends on whether or not one was guaranteed to win\nsomething had one chosen differently. Therefore, their theory can\nrepresent Allais\u2019 preferences as maximising the value of an\nextended Jeffrey-desirability function.\n\nStef\u00e1nsson and Bradley (2019) suggest yet another way of\naccounting for Allais\u2019 preferences in an extension of\nJeffrey\u2019s decision theory; this time extended to chance\npropositions, that is, propositions describing objective\nprobability distributions. The general idea is that the desirability\nof a particular increase or decrease in the chance of some\noutcome\u2014for instance, in the Allais case, a 0.01 increase in the\nchance of the $0-outcome\u2014might depend on what the chances were\nbefore the increase or decrease. Stef\u00e1nsson and Bradley\u2019s\nextension of Jeffrey\u2019s theory to chance propositions is also\nmotivated by the fact that standard decision theories do not\ndistinguish between risk aversion with respect to some good and\nattitudes to quantities of that good (which is found problematic by,\nfor instance, Hansson 1988, Rabin 2000, and Buchak 2013).\n",
