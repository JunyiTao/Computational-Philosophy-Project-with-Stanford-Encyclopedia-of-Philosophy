    "main_text": "A Bit of Mathematical Formalism\n2. A Bit of Mathematical Formalism\n\nTo facilitate subsequent discussions, a bit of mathematical formalism\nis needed. Indeed, the two core Bayesian norms were only stated above\nin a simple, finite setting\n (section 1.2),\n but there can be an infinity of possibilities under consideration.\nFor example, think about this question: What\u2019s the objective,\nphysical chance for a carbon-14 atom to decay in 20 years? Every\npossible chance in the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\) is a possibility to\nwhich a credence can be assigned. So the two core Bayesian norms need\nto be stated in a more general way than above.\n\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be a set of possibilities that are mutually exclusive\nand jointly exhaustive. There is no restriction on the size of\n\\(\\Omega\\); it can be finite or infinite. Let \\(\\cal A\\) be a set of\npropositions identified with some subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). Assume that\n\\(\\cal A\\) contains \\(\\Omega\\) and the empty set \\(\\varnothing\\), and\nis closed under the standard Boolean operations: conjunction\n(intersection), disjunction (union), and negation (complement). This\nclosure assumption means that, whenever \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are in \\(\\cal\nA\\), so are their intersection \\(A \\cap B\\), union \\(A \\cup B\\), and\ncomplement \\(\\Omega \\mcomplement A\\), which are often written in\nlogical notation as conjunction \\(A \\wedge B\\), disjunction \\(A \\vee\nB\\), and negation \\(\\neg A\\). When \\(\\cal A\\) satisfies the assumption\njust stated, it is called an algebra of\n sets/propositions.[2]\n\nLet \\(\\Cr\\) be an assignment of credences to some propositions. We\nwill often think of \\(\\Cr(A)\\) as denoting one\u2019s credence in\nproposition \\(A\\) and refer to \\(\\Cr\\) as one\u2019s credence\nfunction or credence assignment. Next, we need a\ndefinition from probability theory:\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Probability Measure). A credence\nfunction \\(\\Cr(\\wcdot)\\) is said to be probabilistic, also\ncalled a probability measure, if it is a real-valued function\ndefined on an algebra \\({\\cal A}\\) of propositions and satisfies the\nthree axioms of probability:\n\n(Non-Negativity) \\(\\Cr(A) \\ge 0\\) for every\n\\(A\\) in \\(\\cal A\\).\n(Normalization) \\(\\Cr(\\Omega) = 1\\).\n(Finite Additivity) \\(\\Cr(A \\cup B) = \\Cr(A) +\n\\Cr(B)\\) for any two incompatible propositions (i.e., disjoint sets)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(\\cal A\\).\n\n\n\n\nNow Probabilism can be stated as follows:\n\n\nProbabilism (Standard Version). One\u2019s\nassignment of credences at each time ought to be a probability\nmeasure.\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from the context that the credence assignment \\(\\Cr\\)\nis assumed to be probabilistic, it is often written \\(\\Pr\\) or \\(P\\).\nThe process of conditionalization can be defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Conditionalization). Suppose that\n\\(\\Cr(E) \\neq 0\\). A (new) credence function \\(\\Cr'(\\wcdot)\\) is said\nto be obtained from (old) credence function \\(\\Cr(\\wcdot)\\) by\nconditionalization on \\(E\\) if, for each \\(X \\in {\\cal\nA}\\), \n\\[\\Cr'(X) = \\frac{\\Cr(X\\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)}.\\]\n \n\n\n\nConditionalization changes the credence in \\(X\\) from \\(\\Cr(X)\\) to\n\\(\\Cr'(X)\\), which can be understood as involving two steps:\n\n\\[\\Cr(X) \\ovrightarrow{(i)}\n\\Cr(X \\cap E) \\ovrightarrow{(ii)} \\frac{\\Cr(X\\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)} = \\Cr'(X) .\\]\n\n\nTransition (i) corresponds to the zeroing step in the the informal\npresentation in\n section 1.2\n of conditionalization; transition (ii), the rescaling step. Now the\nsecond norm can be stated as follows:\n\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization (Standard\nVersion). One\u2019s credences ought to change by and only by\nconditionalization on the new evidence received.\n\n\n\nThe two norms just stated reduce to the informal versions presented in\nthe tutorial\n section 1.2\n when \\(\\Omega\\) contains only finitely many possibilities and \\(\\cal\nA\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nLet \\(\\Cr(X \\mid E)\\) denote one\u2019s credence in \\(X\\) on the\nsupposition of the truth of \\(E\\) (whether or not one will actually\nreceive \\(E\\) as new evidence); it is also called credence in \\(X\\)\ngiven \\(E\\), or credence in \\(X\\) conditional on \\(E\\). So \\(\\Cr(X\n\\mid E)\\) denotes a conditional credence, while \\(\\Cr(X)\\)\ndenotes an unconditional one. The connection between those\ntwo kinds of credences is often expressed by\n\n\nThe Ratio Formula \n\\[\\Cr(X\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(X \\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)} \\quad\\text{ if } \\Cr(E) \\neq 0.\\]\n\n\n\nIt is debatable whether this formula should be construed as a\ndefinition or as a normative constraint. See H\u00e1jek (2003) for\nsome objections to the definitional construal and for further\ndiscussion. \\(\\Cr(X \\mid E)\\) is often taken as shorthand for the\ncredence in \\(X\\) that results from conditionalization on \\(E\\),\nassuming that the Ratio Formula holds.\n\nMany applications of Bayesian epistemology make use Bayes\u2019\ntheorem. It has different versions, of which two are particularly\nsimple:\n\n\n\n\nBayes\u2019 Theorem (Simplest Version). Suppose\nthat \\(\\Cr\\) is probabilistic and assigns nonzero credences to \\(H\\)\nand \\(E\\), and that the Ratio Formula\n holds.[3]\n Then we have: \n\\[\n        \\Cr(H\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(E \\mid H) \\cdot \\Cr(H)}{\\Cr(E)} .\n        \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes\u2019 Theorem (Finite Version). Suppose\nfurther that hypotheses \\(H_1, \\ldots, H_N\\) are mutually exclusive\nand finite in number, and that each is assigned a nonzero credence and\ntheir disjunction is assigned credence 1 by \\(\\Cr\\). Then we have:\n\n\\[\n        \\Cr(H_i\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(E \\mid H_i) \\cdot \\Cr(H_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\Cr(E \\mid H_j) \\cdot \\Cr(H_j)} .\n   \\]\n \n\n\n\nThis theorem is often useful for calculating credences that result\nfrom conditionalization on evidence \\(E\\), which are represented on\nthe left side of the formula. Indeed, this theorem is very useful and\nimportant in statistical applications of Bayesian epistemology (see\n section 3.5\n below). For more on the significance of this theorem, see the entry\non\n Bayes\u2019 theorem.\n But this theorem is not essential to some other applications of\nBayesian epistemology. Indeed, the case studies in the tutorial\nsection make no reference to Bayes\u2019 theorem. As Earman (1992:\nch. 1) points out in his presentation of Bayes\u2019 (1763) seminal\nessay, Bayesian epistemology is Bayesian not really because\nBayes\u2019 theorem is used in a certain way, but because\nBayes\u2019 essay already contains the core ideas of Bayesian\nepistemology: Probabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization.\n\nHere are some introductory textbooks on Bayesian epistemology (and\nrelated topics) that include presentations of elementary probability\ntheory: Skyrms (1966 [2000]), Hacking (2001), Howson & Urbach\n(2006), Huber (2018), Weisberg (2019\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n and Titelbaum (forthcoming).\n\n\n",
