    "main_text": "Some Broader Implications of Chaos || Human and Divine Action in a Nonlinear World\n7.3 Human and Divine Action in a Nonlinear World\n\nThere has also been much recent work applying the perspective of\ndynamical systems to cognition and action, drawing explicitly on such\nproperties as attractors, bifurcations, SDIC and other denizens of the\nnonlinear zoo (e.g., van Gelder 1995; Kelso 1995; Port and van Gelder\n1995; Juarrero 1999; Tsuda 2001). The basic idea is to deploy the\nframework of nonlinear dynamics for interpreting neural and cognitive\nactivity as well as complex behavior. It is then hoped that patterns\nof neural, cognitive and human activity can be explained as the\nresults of nonlinear dynamical processes involving causal interactions\nand constraints at multiple levels (e.g., neurons, brains, bodies,\nphysical environments). Such approaches are highly suggestive, but\nalso face challenges. For instance, as mentioned in the previous\nsection, the nature of neural and cognitive dynamics is still much\ndisputed. Ultimately, it is an empirical matter whether these\ndynamics are largely nonlinear or not. Moreover, the explanatory power\nof dynamical systems approaches relative to rival computational\napproaches has been challenged (e.g., Clark 1998). Again, questions\nabout realism and explanation in chaotic dynamics\n (\u00a75)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption. \n\n Furthermore, Polkinghorne (among others), as previously noted, has\nproposed interpreting the randomness in macroscopic chaotic models and\nsystems as representing a genuine indeterminism rather than merely a\nmeasure of our ignorance (1991, pp.\u00a034\u201348). The idea is\nthat such openness or indeterminism is not only important to the free\nwill and action that we experience (pp.\u00a040\u20131), but also for\ndivine action in the world (e.g., Polkinghorne\n1989; \u00a77.1). In essence the sensitivity to\nsmall changes exhibited by the systems and models studied in chaotic\ndynamics, complexity theory and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics\nis taken to represent an ontological opening in the physical order for\ndivine activity. However the sensitivity upon which Polkinghorne\nrelies would also be open to quantum influences whether deterministic\nor indeterministic. Furthermore, as mentioned previously in\nconnection with the Brussels-Austin program, much rides on whether a\nsource for indeterminism in chaotic behavior can be found. If\nPolkinghorne\u2019s suggestion amounts to simply viewing the world as\nif chaos harbors indeterminism, then it seems that this\nsuggestion doesn\u2019t yield the kind of divine action he\nseeks. \n7. Conclusion\n\nChaos and nonlinear dynamics are not only rich areas for scientific\ninvestigation, but also raise a number of interesting philosophical\nquestions. The majority of these questions, however, remain thoroughly\nunder studied by philosophers.\n\nAppendix: Global Lyapunov Exponents",
