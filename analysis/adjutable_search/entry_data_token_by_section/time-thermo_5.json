    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time I || Quantum Cosmology\n2.4 Quantum Cosmology\n\nQuantum cosmology, it is often said, is the theory of the\nuniverse\u2019s initial conditions. Presumably this entails that its\nposits are to be regarded as lawlike. Because theories are typically\nunderstood as containing a set of laws, quantum cosmologists\napparently assume that the distinction between laws and initial\nconditions is fluid. Particular initial conditions will be said to\nobtain as a matter of law. Hawking writes, for example,\n\n\nwe shall not have a complete model of the universe until we can say\nmore about the boundary conditions than that they must be whatever\nwould produce what we observe, (1987: 163).\n\n\nCombining such aspirations with the observation that thermodynamics\nrequires special boundary conditions leads quite naturally to the\nthought that \u201cthe second law becomes a selection principle for\nthe boundary conditions of the universe [for quantum cosmology]\u201d\n(Laflamme 1994: 358). In other words, if one is to have a theory of\ninitial conditions, it would certainly be desirable to deduce initial\nconditions that will lead to the thermodynamic arrow. This is\nprecisely what many quantum cosmologists have sought. (This should be\ncontrasted with the arrows of time discussed in semiclassical quantum\ngravity, for example, the idea that quantum scattering processes in\nsystems with black holes violate the CPT theorem.) Since quantum\ncosmology is currently very speculative, it might be premature to\nstart worrying about what it says about time\u2019s arrow.\nNevertheless, there has been a substantial amount of debate on this\nissue (see Haliwell et al. 1994).\n2.5 Causation\n\nPenrose and Percival (1962) propose a general causal principle to\nhandle our problem. The principle states that the effects of\ninteractions happen after those interactions but not\nbefore. Similar to Reichenbach\u2019s principle of the\ncommon cause, they suggest what they dub the Law of Conditional\nIndependence, namely, that \u201cIf A and B are two disjoint\n4-regions, and C is any 4-region which divides the union of the pasts\nof A and B into two parts, one containing A and the other containing\nB, then A and B are conditionally independent given c. That is,\nPr(a&b/c) = Pr(a/c) \u00d7 Pr(b/c), for all a,b.\u201d (Penrose\nand Percival 1962, p. 611). Here c is an event that is a common cause\nthat screens off the correlation between events in A and B.\n\nIn terms of statistical mechanics, this law would have the effect of\nmaking the phase space density associated with a system at a time\ndetermined by earlier events but not later events. This would more or\nless directly preclude the temporal \"parity of reasoning\" motivated\ntransitions assumed in the problem of the direction of time,\ntransition of type (2). To achieve this, the Law of Conditional\nIndependence must be time asymmetric, which it is, and it must be a\nkind of fundamental principle that restricts the lawlike correlation\notherwise allowed. After all, if we assume that the laws of nature are\ntime reversal invariant, then there is no asymmetry between pre- and\npost-interaction correlations.\n\nPrice 1996 (chapter 5) and Sklar 1993 hold that this nomic restriction\nis unwarranted or unexplanatory. There is the sense that the causal\nasymmetry should come out of more basic physics, not be baked into\nthis physics. Horwich 1987 is an example of someone trying to derive\nwhat he calls the fork asymmetry, which is similar to the Law of\nConditional Independence, from more basic assumptions. \n\nA recent contribution that has some affinities with the Penrose and\nPercival move can be found in Myrvold 2020. \n2.6 Time Itself\n\nSome philosophers have sought an answer to the problem of time\u2019s\narrow by claiming that time itself is directed. They do not\nmean time is asymmetric in the sense intended by advocates of the\ntensed theory of time. Their proposals are firmly rooted in the idea\nthat time and space are properly represented on a four-dimensional\nmanifold. The main idea is that the asymmetries in time indicate\nsomething about the nature of time itself. Christensen (1993) argues\nthat this is the most economical response to our problem since it\nposits nothing besides time as the common cause of the asymmetries,\nand we already believe in time. A proposal similar to\nChristensen\u2019s is Weingard\u2019s \u201ctime-ordering\nfield\u201d (1977). Weingard\u2019s speculative thesis is that\nspacetime is temporally oriented by a \u201ctime potential\u201d, a\ntimelike vector field that at every spacetime point directs a vector\ninto its future light cone. In other words, supposing our spacetime is\ntemporally orientable, Weingard wants to actually orient it. The main\nvirtue of this is that it provides a time sense everywhere, even in\nspacetimes containing closed timelike curves (so long as they\u2019re\ntemporally orientable). As he shows, any explication of the\n\u201cearlier than\u201d relation in terms of some other physical\nrelation will have trouble providing a consistent description of time\ndirection in such spacetimes. Another virtue of the idea is that it is\nin principle capable of explaining all the temporal\nasymmetries. If coupled to the various asymmetries in time, it would\nbe the \u201cmaster arrow\u201d responsible for the arrows of\ninterest. As Sklar (1985) notes, Weingard\u2019s proposal makes the\npast-future asymmetry very much like the up-down asymmetry. As the\nup-down asymmetry was reduced to the existence of a gravitational\npotential\u2014and not an asymmetry of space itself\u2014so the\npast-future asymmetry would reduce to the time potential\u2014and not\nan asymmetry of time itself. Of course, if one thinks of the\ngravitational metric field as part of spacetime, there is a sense in\nwhich the reduction of the up-down asymmetry really was a reduction to\na spacetime asymmetry. And if the metric field is conceived as part of\nspacetime\u2014which is itself a huge source of contention in\nphilosophy of physics\u2014it is natural to think of Weingard\u2019s\ntime-ordering field as also part of spacetime. Thus his proposal\nshares a lot in common with Christensen\u2019s suggestion.\n\nThis sort of proposal has been criticized by Sklar on methodological\ngrounds. Sklar claims that scientists would not accept such an\nexplanation (1985: 111\u20132). One might point out, however, that\nmany scientists did believe in analogues of the time-ordering field as\npossible causes of the CP\n violations.[4]\n The time-ordering field, if it exists, would be an unseen (except\nthrough its effects) common cause of strikingly ubiquitous phenomena.\nScientists routinely accept such explanations. To find a problem with\nthe time-ordering field we need not invoke methodological scruples;\ninstead we can simply ask whether it does the job asked of it. Is\nthere a mechanism that will couple the time-ordering field to\nthermodynamic phenomena? Weingard says the time potential field needs\nto be suitably coupled (1977: 130) to the non-accidental asymmetric\nprocesses, but neither he nor Christensen elaborate on how this is to\nbe accomplished. Until this is addressed satisfactorily, this\nspeculative idea must be considered interesting yet embryonic. For\nmore recent work in this vein, see Maudlin 2002.\n2.7 Interventionism\n\nWhen explaining time\u2019s arrow many philosophers and physicists\nhave focused their attention upon the unimpeachable fact that real\nsystems are open systems that are subjected to interactions of various\nsorts. Thermodynamic systems cannot be truly isolated. To take the\nmost obvious example, we can not shield a system from the influence of\ngravity. At best, we can move systems to locations feeling less and\nless gravitational force, but we can never completely decouple a\nsystem from the gravitational field. Not only do we ignore the weak\ngravitational force when doing classical thermodynamics, but we also\nignore less exotic matters, such as the walls in the standard gas in a\nbox scenario. We can do this because the time it takes for a gas to\nreach equilibrium with itself is vastly shorter than the time it takes\nthe gas plus walls system to reach equilibrium. For this reason we\ntypically discount the effects of the box walls on the gas.\n\nIn this approximation many have thought there lies a possible solution\nto the problem of the direction of time. Indeed, many have thought\nherein lies a solution that does not change the laws of\nclassical mechanics and does not allow for the nomological\npossibility of anti-thermodynamic behavior. In other words, advocates\nof this view seem to believe it embodies a third way. Blatt 1959;\nReichenbach 1956; Redhead and Ridderbos 1998, and to some extent,\nHorwich 1987 are a few works charmed by this idea.\n\nThe idea is to take advantage of what a random perturbation of the\nrepresentative phase point would do to the evolution of a system.\nGiven our Boltzmannian setup, there is a tremendous asymmetry in phase\nspace between the volumes of points leading to equilibrium and of\npoints leading away from equilibrium. If the representative point of a\nsystem were knocked about randomly, then due to this asymmetry, it\nwould be very probable that the system at any given time be on a\ntrajectory leading toward equilibrium. Thus, if it could be argued\nthat the earlier treatment of the statistical mechanics of ideal\nsystems ignored a random perturber in the environment of the system,\nthen one would seem to have a solution to our problems. Even if the\nperturbation were weak it would still have the desired effect. The\nweak \u201crandom\u201d previously ignored knocking of the\nenvironment is is claimed to be the cause of the approach to\nequilibrium. Prima facie, this answer to the problem escapes\nthe appeal to special initial conditions and the appeal to new\nlaws.\n\nBut only prima facie. A number of criticisms have been\nleveled against this maneuver. One that seems on the mark is the\nobservation that if classical mechanics is to be a universal theory,\nthen the environment must be governed by the laws of classical\nmechanics as well. The environment is not some mechanism outside the\ngovernance of physical law, after all, and when we treat it too, the\n\u201cdeus ex machina\u201d\u2014the random\nperturber\u2014disappears. If we treat the gas-plus-the-container\nwalls as a classical system, it is still governed by time-reversible\nlaws that will cause the same problem as we met with the gas alone. At\nthis point one sometimes sees the response that this combined system\nof gas plus walls has a neglected environment too, and so on, and so\non, until we get to the entire universe. It is then questioned whether\nwe have a right to expect laws to apply universally (Reichenbach 1956:\n81ff). Or the point is made that we cannot write down the Hamiltonian\nfor all the interactions a real system suffers, and so there will\nalways be something \u201coutside\u201d what is governed by the\ntime-reversible Hamiltonian. Both of these points rely, one suspects,\non an underlying instrumentalism about the laws of nature. Our problem\nonly arises if we assume or pretend that the world literally is the\nway the theory says; dropping this assumption naturally\n\u201csolves\u201d the problem. Rather than further address these\nresponses, let us turn to the claim that this maneuver need not modify\nthe laws of classical mechanics.\n\nIf one does not make the radical proclamation that physical law does\nnot govern the environment, then it is easy to see that whatever law\ndescribes the perturber\u2019s behavior, it cannot be the laws of\nclassical mechanics \\(if\\) the environment is to do the job required\nof it. A time-reversal noninvariant law, in contrast to the time\nsymmetric laws of classical mechanics, must govern the external\nperturber. Otherwise we can in principle subject the whole system,\nenvironment plus system of interest, to a Loschmidt reversal. The\nsystem\u2019s velocities will reverse, as will the velocities of the\nmillions of tiny perturbers. \u201cMiraculously\u201d, as if there\nwere a conspiracy between the reversed system and the millions of\n\u201canti-perturbers\u201d, the whole system will return to a time\nreverse of its original state. What is more, this reversal will be\njust as likely as the original process if the laws are time reversal\ninvariant. A minimal criterion of adequacy, therefore, is that the\nrandom perturbers be time reversal noninvariant. But the laws\nof classical mechanics are time reversal invariant. Consequently, if\nthis \u201csolution\u201d is to succeed, it must exercise new laws\nand modify or supplement classical mechanics. (Since the perturbations\nneed to be genuinely random and not merely unpredictable, and since\nclassical mechanics is deterministic, the same sort of argument could\nbe run with indeterminism instead of irreversibility. See Price 2002\nfor a diagnosis of why people have made this mistake, and also for an\nargument objecting to interventionism for offering a\n\u201credundant\u201d physical mechanism responsible for entropy\n increase.)[5]\n2.8 Quantum Mechanics\n\nTo the best of our knowledge our world is fundamentally quantum\nmechanical, not classical mechanical. Does this change the situation?\n\u201cMaybe\u201d is perhaps the best answer. Not surprisingly,\nanswers to the question are affected by one\u2019s interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics suffers from the notorious\nmeasurement problem, a problem which demands one or another\ninterpretation of the quantum formalism. These interpretations fall\nbroadly into two types, depending on their view of the unitary\nevolution of the quantum state (e.g., evolution according to the\nSchroedinger equation): they either say that there is something more\nthan the quantum state, or that the unitary evolution is not entirely\ncorrect. The former are called \u201cno-collapse\u201d\ninterpretations while the latter are dubbed \u201ccollapse\u201d\ninterpretations. This is not the place to go into the details of these\ninterpretations, but we can still sketch the outlines of the picture\npainted by quantum mechanics (for more see Albert 1992).\n\nModulo some philosophical concerns about the meaning of time reversal\n(Albert 2000; Earman 2002), the equation governing the unitary\nevolution of the quantum state is time reversal invariant. For\ninterpretations that add something to quantum mechanics, this\ntypically means that the resulting theory is time reversal invariant\ntoo (since it would be odd or even inconsistent to have one part of\nthe theory invariant and the other part not). Since the resulting\ntheory is time reversal invariant, it is possible to generate the\nproblem of the direction of time just as we did with classical\nmechanics. While many details are altered in the change from classical\nto no-collapse quantum mechanics, the logical geography seems to\nremain the same.\n\nCollapse interpretations are more interesting with respect to our\ntopic. Collapses interrupt or outright replace the unitary evolution\nof the quantum state. To date, they have always done so in a time\nreversal noninvariant manner. The resulting theory,\ntherefore, is not time reversal invariant. This fact offers a\npotential escape from our problem: the transitions of type\n (2)\n in our above statement of the problem may not be lawful. And this has\nled many thinkers throughout the century to believe that collapses\nsomehow explain the thermodynamic time asymmetry.\n\nMostly these postulated methods fail to provide what we want. We think\ngases relax to equilibrium even when they\u2019re not measured by\nBohrian observers or Wignerian conscious beings. This complaint is,\nadmittedly, not independent of more general complaints about the\nadequacy of these interpretations. But perhaps because of these\ncontroversial features they have not been pushed very far in\nexplaining thermodynamics.\n\nMore satisfactory collapse theories exist, however. One, due to\nGhirardi, Rimini, and Weber, commonly known as GRW, can describe\ncollapses in a closed system\u2014no dubious appeal to observers\noutside the quantum system is required. Albert (1992, 2000) has\nextensively investigated the impact GRW would have on statistical\nmechanics and thermodynamics. GRW would ground a temporally asymmetric\nprobabilistic tendency for systems to evolve toward equilibrium.\nAnti-thermodynamic behavior is not impossible according to this\ntheory. Instead it is tremendously unlikely. The innovation of the\ntheory lies in the fact that although entropy is overwhelmingly likely\nto increase toward the future, it is not also overwhelmingly likely to\nincrease toward the past (because there are no dynamic backwards\ntransition probabilities provided by the theory). So the theory does\nnot suffer from a problem of the direction of time as stated\nabove.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that it removes the need for something\nlike the Past Hypothesis. GRW is capable of explaining why, given a\npresent nonequilibrium state, later states should have higher entropy;\nand it can do this without also implying that earlier states have\nhigher entropy too. But it does not explain how the universe ever got\ninto a nonequilibrium state in the first place. As indicated before,\nsome are not sure what would explain this fact, if anything,\nor whether it\u2019s something we should even aspire to explain. The\nprincipal virtue GRW would bring to the situation, Albert thinks, is\nthat it would solve or bypass various troubles involving the nature of\nprobabilities in statistical mechanics.\n\nThe same type of benefit, plus arguably others, come from a recent\nproposal by Chen (forthcoming). Chen suggests that we adopt a position\nknown as density matrix realism to help understand time\u2019s arrow.\nInstead of regarding the wavefunction as the basic ontology of quantum\ntheory, we take the quantum state to be represented by an impure\ndensity matrix. When we express the Past Hypothesis in terms of a\ndensity matrix, a number of virtues appear, including greater harmony\nbetween the probabilities of statistical mechanics and quantum\nmechanics. It may be that interpretations of quantum mechanics that\nare not like GRW can possess some of the same benefits that GRW\nbrings.\n\nMore detailed discussion of the impact quantum mechanics has on our\nproblem can be found in Albert 2000, North 2002, Price 2002 and Chen\nforthcoming. But if our superficial review is correct, we can say that\nquantum mechanics will not obviate our need for a Past Hypothesis\nthough it may well solve at least one problem related to the direction\nof time.\n2.9 Lawlike Initial Conditions?\n\nFinally, let\u2019s return to a point made in passing about the\nstatus of the Past Hypothesis. Without some new physics that\neliminates or explains the Past Hypothesis, or some satisfactory\n\u201cthird way\u201d, it seems we are left with a bald posit of\nspecial initial conditions. One can question whether there really is\nanything unsatisfactory about this (Sklar 1993; Callender 2004b). But\nperhaps we were wrong in the first place to think of the Past\nHypothesis as a contingent boundary condition. The question \u201cwhy\nthese special initial conditions?\u201d would be answered with\n\u201cit\u2019s physically impossible for them to be\notherwise\u201d, which is always a conversation stopper. Indeed,\nFeynman (1965: 116) speaks this way when explaining the statistical\nversion of the second law.\n\nAbsent a particular understanding of laws of nature, there is perhaps\nnot much to say about the issue. But given particular conceptions of\nlawhood, it is clear that various judgments about this issue follow\nnaturally\u2014as we will see momentarily. However, let\u2019s\nacknowledge that this may be to get matters backwards. It might be\nsaid that we first ought to find out whether the boundary\nconditions are lawlike, and then devise a theory of\nlaw appropriate to the answer. To decide whether or not the boundary\nconditions are lawlike based merely on current philosophical theories\nof law is to prejudge the issue. Perhaps this objection is really\nevidence of the feeling that settling the issue based on one\u2019s\nconception of lawhood seems a bit unsatisfying. It is hard to deny\nthis. Even so, it is illuminating to have a brief look at the\nrelationships between some conceptions of lawhood and the topic of\nspecial initial conditions. For discussion and references on laws of\nnature, please refer to the entry on that topic.\n\nFor instance, if one agrees with John Stuart Mill that from the laws\none should be able to deduce everything and one considers the\nthermodynamic part of that \u201ceverything\u201d, then the special\ninitial condition will be needed for such a deduction. The modern heir\nof this conception of lawhood, the one associated with Frank Ramsey\nand David Lewis (see Loewer 1996), sees laws as the axioms of the\nsimplest, most powerful, consistent deductive system possible. It is\nlikely that the specification of a special initial condition would\nemerge as an axiom in such a system, for such a constraint may well\nmake the laws much more powerful than they otherwise would be.\n\nWe should not expect the na\u00efve regularity view of laws to follow\nsuit, however. On this sort of account, roughly, if \\(B\\)s always\nfollow \\(A\\)s, then it is a law of nature that \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\). To\navoid finding laws everywhere, however, this account needs to assume\nthat \\(A\\)s and \\(B\\)s are instantiated plenty of times. But the\ninitial conditions occur only once.\n\nFor more robust realist conceptions of law, it\u2019s difficult to\npredict whether the special initial conditions will emerge as lawlike.\nNecessitarian accounts like Pargetter\u2019s (1984) maintain that it\nis a law that \\(P\\) in our world iff \\(P\\) obtains at every possible\nworld joined to ours by a nomic accessibility relation. Without more\nspecific information about the nature of the accessibility relations\nand the worlds to which we\u2019re related, one can only guess\nwhether all of the worlds relative to ours have the same special\ninitial conditions. Nevertheless some realist theories offer\napparently prohibitive criteria, so they are able to make negative\njudgments. For instance, \u201cuniversalist\u201d theories\nassociated with David Armstrong say that laws are relations between\nuniversals. Yet a constraint on initial conditions isn\u2019t in any\nnatural way put in this form; hence it would seem the universalist\ntheory would not consider this constraint lawlike.\n\nPhilosophical opinion is certainly divided. The problem is that a\nlawlike boundary condition lacks many of the features we ordinarily\nattribute to laws, e.g., multiple instances, governing temporal\nevolution, etc., yet different accounts of laws focus on different\nsubsets of these features. When we turn to the issue at hand, what we\nfind is the disagreement we expect.\n3. The Problem of the Direction of Time II\n\nLife is filled with temporal asymmetries. This directedness is one of\nthe most general features of the world we inhabit. We can break this\ngeneral tendency down into a few more specific temporal arrows.\n\nThe epistemological arrow. Roughly put, we know more about the\npast than the future. I know that yesterday\u2019s broken egg on the\nfloor had a similar outline to Chile\u2019s boundaries, but I have no\nidea what country tomorrow\u2019s broken egg will look like. Albert\n(2000) provides a much better characterization, for no one really\ncounts and compares known propositions between past and future.\nIt\u2019s better to say, as he does, that our way of knowing\nthe past is different than our way of knowing the future. There also\nseem to be more traces of events in the future than in the past. When\nI say something embarrassing, information representing that event is\nencoded on sound and light waves that form a continually increasing\nspherical shell in my future light-cone. I am potentially further\nembarrassed throughout my whole future lightcone. Yet there is no\nindication of the unfortunate event in its backward lightcone.\nThe mutability arrow. We feel the future is \u201copen\u201d or\nindeterminate in a way the past is not. The past is closed, fixed for\nall eternity. Related to this, no doubt, is the feeling that our\nactions are essentially tied to the future and not the past. The\nfuture is mutable whereas the past is not.\nThe psychological arrow. We have very different attitudes toward\nthe past than toward the future. We dread future but not past\nheadaches and prison sentences. This controversial arrow is actually\nmany different asymmetries. Another, much disputed, is that we seem to\nshare a psychological sense of passage through time. Allegedly, we\nsense a moving \u201cnow\u201d, the motion of the present as events\nare transformed from future to past.\nThe explanation-causation-counterfactual arrow. This arrow is\nactually three, yet it seems plausible that there are connections\namong them. Causes typically occur before their effects.\nRelated to the causal asymmetry in some fashion or other is the\nasymmetry of explanation. Usually good explanations appeal to events\nin the past of the event to be explained, not to events in the future.\nIt may be that this is just a prejudice that we ought to dispense\nwith, but it is an intuition that we frequently have. Finally, and no\ndoubt this is again related to the other two arrows as well as the\nmutability arrow, we\u2014at least naively\u2014believe the future\ndepends counterfactually on the present in a way that we do not\nbelieve the past depends counterfactually on the present.\n\n\nThe above list is not meant to be exhaustive or especially clean.\nTemporal asymmetries are everywhere. We age and die. Punchlines are at\nthe ends of jokes. Propensities and dispositions and reproductive\nfitness are all future-directed. We prefer rags-to-riches stories to\nriches-to-rags stories. Obviously there are connections amongst many\nof these arrows. Some authors have explicitly or implicitly proposed\nvarious \u201cdependency charts\u201d that are supposed to explain\nwhich of the above arrows depend on which for their existence. Horwich\n(1987) argues for an explanatory relationship wherein the\ncounterfactual arrow depends on the causal arrow, which depends on the\narrow of explanation, which depends on the epistemological arrow.\nLewis (1979), by contrast, thinks an alleged over-determination of\ntraces grounds the asymmetry of counterfactuals and that this in turn\ngrounds the rest. Suhler and Callender (2011) ground the psychological\narrow on the causal and knowledge asymmetries. The chart one judges\nmost appropriate will depend, to a large degree, upon one\u2019s\ngeneral philosophical stance on many large topics.\n\nWhich dependency chart is the correct one is not our concern here.\nRather, the second \u201cproblem of the direction of time\u201d\nasks: do any (all?) of these arrows ultimately hold in virtue of the\nthermodynamic arrow of time (or what grounds it)?\n\nSklar (1985) provides useful examples to have in mind. Consider the\nup-down asymmetry. It plausibly reduces to the local gravitational\ngradient. Astronauts on the moon think down is the direction toward\nthe center of the moon, not wherever it was when they left Earth. By\ncontrast, there is (probably) merely a correlation between the\nleft-right asymmetry (say, in snail shells) and parity violations in\nhigh-energy particle physics. The second problem asks whether any of\nthe above temporal asymmetries are to the thermodynamic arrow as the\nup-down asymmetry is to the local gravitational gradient. Of course,\nwe don\u2019t expect anything quite so straightforward. Sklar\ndescribes an experiment where iron dust inserted in the ear sacs of\nfish cause the fish to swim upside down when a magnet is held over the\ntank, presumably altering their sense of up and down. But as Jos\nUffink remarked to me, going inside a refrigerator doesn\u2019t cause\nus to remember the future. The connections, if any, are bound to be\nsubtle.\n3.1 The Thermodynamic Reduction\n\nInspired by Boltzmann\u2019s attempts in this regard, many\nphilosophers have sought such reductions, either partial or total.\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1973) and Smart (1967) develop entropic accounts of the\nknowledge asymmetry. Lewis (1979) suspects the asymmetry of traces is\nlinked to the thermodynamic arrow but provides no specifics. Dowe\n(1992), like a few others, ties the direction of causation to the\nentropy gradient. And some have also tied the psychological arrow to\nthis gradient (for a discussion see Kroes 1985). Perhaps the most\nambitious attempts at grounding many arrows all at once can be found\nin Reichenbach 1956, Horwich 1987, and Albert 2000, 2015. Each of\nthese books offers possible thermodynamic explanations for the causal\nand epistemic arrows, as well as many subsidiary arrows.\n\nA straightforward reduction of these arrows to entropy is probably not\nin the cards (Earman 1974; Horwich 1987). Consider the epistemic arrow\nof time. The traditional entropic account claimed that because we know\nthere are many more entropy-increasing rather than entropy-decreasing\nsystems in the world (or our part of it), we can infer when we see a\nlow-entropy system that it was preceded and caused by an interaction\nwith something outside the system. To take the canonical example,\nimagine you are walking on the beach and come across a footprint in\nthe sand. You can infer that earlier someone walked by (in contrast to\nit arising as a random fluctuation). In other words, you infer, due to\nits high order, that it was caused by something previously also of\nhigh (or higher) order, i.e, someone walking.\n\nHowever, the entropic account faces some very severe challenges.\nFirst, do footprints on beaches have well-defined thermodynamic\nentropies? To describe the example we switched from low-entropy to\nhigh order, but the association between entropy and our ordinary\nconcept of order is tenuous at best and usually completely misleading.\n(To appreciate this, just consider what happens to your salad dressing\nafter it is left undisturbed. Order increases when the oil and vinegar\nseparate, yet entropy has increased.) To describe the range of systems\nabout which we have knowledge, the account needs something broader\nthan the thermodynamic entropy. But what? Reichenbach is forced to\nmove to a notion of quasi-entropy, losing the reduction in the\nprocess. Second, the entropic account doesn\u2019t license the\ninference to a human being walking on the beach. All it tells you is\nthat the grains of sand in the footprint interacted with its\nenvironment previously, which barely scratches the surface of our\nability to tell detailed stories about what happened in the past.\nThird, even if we entertain a broader understanding of entropy, it\nstill doesn\u2019t always work. Consider Earman\u2019s (1974)\nexample of a bomb destroying a city. From the destruction we may infer\nthat a bomb went off; yet the bombed city does not have lower entropy\nthan its surroundings or even any type of intuitively higher order\nthan its surroundings.\n3.2 The Statistical Mechanical Reduction\n\nPresumably for these reasons, contemporary theories abandon the\nattempt to ground the arrows of time on thermodynamic entropy.\nInstead, they turn to statistical mechanics, that which grounds the\nthermodynamic arrow. This more general basis is regarded as more\nfertile ground for the other arrows. In effect, the thermodynamic\narrow is just regarded as another non-basic arrow like those four\nmention above. Horwich (1987) traces the arrows back to initial\nmicro-chaos. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2012) instead trace them\nto a package dubbed the Mentaculus (after the Coen\nbrothers\u2019 film, A Serious Man, 2009). Let\u2019s\nbriefly consider how Albert and Loewer propose to derive the\nthermodynamic arrow, the epistemic arrow, and the causal arrow all\nfrom the Mentaculus.\n\nIn the Coen brothers\u2019 film, the character Arthur Gopnik, a\nmathematician, spends his days on a couch filling a notebook with a\nprobability map of the universe, the Mentaculus. It is an apt name for\nwhat statistical mechanics provides us according to Albert and Loewer.\nIn effect, it provides us with a probability map for every macroscopic\ngeneralization because it provides probabilities over all the\nmicrostates realizing these macrostates. The package is composed of\nthe following elements: the past hypothesis (that the entropy of\ninitial macrostate \\(M(0)\\) is extremely low), a uniform probability\ndistribution over the microstates that realize \\(M(0)\\), the present\nmacrostate \\(M(t)\\), and the dynamical laws of the microlevel.\n\nThis package, they say, implies the thermodynamic arrow. We\n\u201cderive\u201d it from basic physics by making a case at time\n\\(t\\) that \n\\[ P(S \\text{ increases } \\mid M(t) \\amp M(0) \\amp\n\\text{uniform-probability-over-}M(0)) = \\text{high} \\]\n\n\nBoltzmann, Gibbs and many others make the case, although it\u2019s\nworth bearing in mind that they do so rigorously only in ideal cases\nand much remains controversial (see above). Still, it strikes many as\nphysically plausible. One could say a lot more, but let\u2019s grant\nthis. Then notice that the first problem of the direction of time is\nblocked by the Past Hypothesis. One conditionalizes on the uniform\ndistribution given \\(M(0)\\) and \\(M(t)\\), not merely \\(M(t)\\). The\nconstraint at one end of the universe makes the claim that earlier\nentropy was higher unlikely. If correct, we have an honest-to-goodness\nreduction of a special science law \u201cthe second law of\nthermodynamics\u201d from the bottom.\n\nBut this package also implies more. Turn to the causal arrow. As a\nvery rough first approximation, causation can be analyzed\nprobabilistically. Cause \\(C\\) causes effect \\(E\\) just in case \\(C\\)\nis prior to \\(E\\) and the probability of \\(E\\) given \\(C\\) and\nbackground \\(B\\) is greater than the probability of \\(E\\) given \\(B\\)\nalone. Of course, there are major problems with this account (see the\nentry on Probabilistic Causation). Yet the core intuition appears to\ncome from the package, as one gets the temporal priority of causes\nfrom the Past Hypothesis and the probabilities from statistical\nmechanics. Together, they are claimed to explain why we can manipulate\ncauses to produce effects but not vice versa. Turn to the epistemic\narrow. Reflect on the nature of records. When you weigh yourself on a\nscale, one produces a record of one\u2019s weight. This record is\nbased on an inference comparing the states of the scale at two\ndifferent times. I\u2019m (say) 180 lbs if the scale was in its\nfunctioning ready state at 0 lbs before I stepped on it. The idea,\nvery loosely (see Albert 2000, 2015 and Loewer 2012 for the details)\nis that the Past Hypothesis effectively is the world\u2019s Ready\nState. This highly constrained state is what causes there to be\nmacroscopic traces of the past in the present but not macroscopic\ntraces of the future in the present.\n\nNaturally, this ambitious program met with vigorous criticism. The\nidea that statistical mechanics implies (probabilistically) the truth\nor falsity of virtually every counterfactual-supporting generalization\nin all of science and everyday life strikes many as going too far. See\nCallender and Cohen 2010, Earman 2006, Frisch 2010, Leeds 2003, North\n2011, Westlake 2014, Winsberg 2004 and some essays in Wilson 2014.\n\nLong ago Boltzmann (e.g., 1895) suggested that the temporal\nasymmetries discussed above are explained by the direction of\nincreasing entropy. A lot of progress has been made developing this\ntantalizing thesis. Nevertheless, just as work on the first problem of\nthe origins of the thermodynamic arrow remains active, so too does\nresearch on the second.",
