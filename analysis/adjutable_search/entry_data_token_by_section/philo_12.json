    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || The Law of Nature\n4.4 The Law of Nature\n\nThe relation between the logos and the law of Nature is an\ninteresting topic since it shows the different perspectives of\nPhilo\u2019s thought and Stoic doctrine despite their many\nsimilarities (Najman 1999). For the Stoics, the logos and the\nlaw of Nature are perfectly synonymous. In their definition, the law\nof Nature is the command of the logos as to what must be done\nand what avoided. Philo\u2019s thought of the law is different. In\nOpif. 143, Philo alludes to man\u2019s original ancestor as\nliving in a world governed by a constitution, i.e., \u201cthe right\nreason of nature\u201d, which is named with more appropriate title\n\u201cordinance\u201d, a divine law according to which obligations\nand rights have been distributed to each creature. The vocabulary is\nStoic, but with an interesting nuance: Philo speaks about \u201cthe\nright reason of nature\u201d instead of \u201cthe law of\nnature\u201d. This is perhaps more than a stylistic variation;\ninstead, it may have served to reveal a distance with regard to the\ncanonical doctrine of the law of Nature. This distance appears to be\nessential, despite many variations and occasional contradictions.\nFirst of all, while Stoic natural law is affirmed by Cicero to be\n\u201cthe same in Athens and in Rome\u201d, but without any precise\nformulation, the Torah, specific law of the people of Israel, is\nposited by Philo to be unique, since it is both concrete and eternal.\nThe law of Moses thus has an ambiguous status, since it is sometimes\nsaid to be the Natural Law itself, and sometimes an image,\neik\u00f4n, of it. It is a controversial point whether the\nterm \u201cimage\u201d means an ontological degradation or a perfect\nidentity of one with the other. Last but not least, Philo emphasizes\nthe fact that before the Torah, the patriarchs were unwritten\nincarnations of the law of Nature. Admittedly, his task bordered on\nthe impossible. He had to take into account both the historicity of\nthe Torah and its eternity, its universality, and its institutional\nstatus as law of Israel. It is not impossible that he had in mind a\nmodel similar to the translation of the Torah into Greek. In the\nVita Mosis, he emphasizes the fact that the Greek translation\nand the Hebrew (he says \u201cChaldean\u201d) original are perfectly\nidentical and equivalent. There is a plasticity of the law of Nature,\nat first incarnated by the patriarchs, then written; and a plasticity\nof the Torah, first in Hebrew, then in Greek. At the same time, their\nunderlying function is always the same: defining a principle of\nethical responsibility not exclusively from the rationality of the\nworld but by reference to a personal God who chose Israel to incarnate\nand bear witness to this principle in its different forms.\n",
