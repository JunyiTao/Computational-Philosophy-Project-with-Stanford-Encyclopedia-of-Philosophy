    "main_text": "Russell\u2019s Atheism\n6. Russell\u2019s Atheism\n\nRussell sums up his views about religion quite plainly: \u201cMy own\nview on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born\nof fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race\u201d\n(A1957, 18). According to Russell, not only are most religious beliefs\nintellectually and morally pernicious, the religious point of view\nitself \u201cis a conception quite unworthy of free men\u201d\n(A1957, 17). Throughout his life, Russell thus put significant effort\ninto opposing religious ideas and institutions of all kinds. As he\nreports in his Autobiography, upon arriving at Brixton Prison\nin 1918, \u201cI was much cheered on my arrival by the warder at the\ngate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and\nI replied \u2018agnostic.\u2019 He asked how to spell it, and remarked with\na sigh: \u2018Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all\nworship the same God.\u2019 This remark kept me cheerful for about a\nweek\u201d (1968, 34). \n\nRussell\u2019s discussions about religion fall largely into four\ncategories: his criticisms of arguments favouring the existence of\nGod; his observation that religion has historically served to impede\nthe advancement of knowledge; his observation that religion has\nregularly advanced theories of morality that are more harmful than\ngood; and his analysis of religion, not simply as a body of belief but\nas a mode of feeling.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Russell opened the door to the\ndemystification of religion, writing in plain language at a time when\npeople had been told that serious discussions about religion required\na detailed knowledge of Latin and church history. The result was\ntwofold: first, that many people came to understand religion as a\nsubject about which they were entitled to develop their own beliefs\nand views; second, that arguments from ecclesiastical authority\nsuddenly became less formidable and less influential than they had\nbeen for centuries. In this respect, it is not too much to say that\nRussell did as much to usher in the twentieth century\u2019s age of\nsecularism as Luther did to usher in the sixteenth century\u2019s age of\nProtestantism. As the Nobel Prize committee noted, the 1950 award went\nto Russell \u201cin recognition of his varied and significant\nwritings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of\nthought\u201d (Nobel Media 2020). Russell himself reports that he\nreceived the award primarily for his anti-religious book, Marriage\nand Morals (1969, 30). \n\nRussell\u2019s analysis of traditional arguments in favour of the\nexistence of God appears in both his popular and his philosophical\nwritings. In his book on Leibniz, he discusses Leibniz\u2019s treatment\nof several such arguments, noting that they are \u201cthe weakest\npart in Leibniz\u2019s philosophy, the part most full of\ninconsistencies\u201d (1900, sec. 106, p. 172). In his more popular\nwritings, he repeatedly emphasizes his views about religion, noting\nthat \u201cThe fact that an opinion has been widely held is no\nevidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd\u201d (1929, 58). In his 1922 booklet Free Thought and Official\nPropaganda, he tells his readers that \u201cI am myself a dissenter from all known\nreligions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die\nout\u201d (1922a, 1). Later, in his 1941 collection of essays\nLet the People Think, he adds that \u201cmodern science gives us no\nindication whatever of the existence of the soul\u201d (A1941, 113),\nand in the preface to his 1957 book Why I Am Not a\nChristian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects, he notes that \n\u201cI am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that\nthey are untrue\u201d (1957, xi).\n\nRussell\u2019s criticism of arguments traditionally offered in favour of\nthe existence of God includes his discussion of the First Cause\nArgument, the Problem of Evil, the Ontological Argument, the\nTeleological Argument, the Argument from Pre-established Harmony, the\nNatural Law Argument, the Argument from Morality, the Remediation of\nInjustice Argument and the Argument from Religious Experience.\nUnderlying all of these discussions is Hume\u2019s suggestion that\nbelief needs to be proportioned to the available evidence, an idea\nneatly summed up in Russell\u2019s teapot analogy:\n\nIf I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china\nteapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be\nable to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the\nteapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful\ntelescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion\ncannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of\nhuman reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking\nnonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in\nancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled\ninto the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its\nexistence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter\nto the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the\nInquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a\nbelief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it. I\ndo not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied\nhistory. (1952, 547\u20138)\n\n\nThe First Cause (or Cosmological) Argument\nis the argument that since everything has a cause, there must have\nbeen a first cause, and it is to this first cause that we give the\nname God. In response to this argument, Russell notes the obvious: If\neverything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If\neverything must have a creator, then God must have a creator.\nAlternatively, if God can exist without a cause, then it is just as likely\nthat the world can exist without a cause. In fact, this is even more\nlikely than the existence of an uncaused, hypothetical, supernatural\ncreator who manufactures and then intervenes in the world, since there\n\u201cis no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at\nall\u201d (A1957, 4). To those who suggest that unlike God, since\nevery part of the world has a cause, it follows that the world itself\nmust have a cause, Russell notes that just because every man has a\nmother it does not follow that the human race must have a mother\n(A1957, 152). Put in more formal language, although causation connects\neach contingent stage of the world to the next, it need not follow\nthat there is an \u201cextramundane\u201d creator of the world as a\nwhole (1900, sec. 109, p. 176). To those who claim that without such a\ncreator, there can never be sufficient reason for \u201cwhy there are\nany states at all,\u201d Russell points out that the traditional view\nof God as being uncaused because he exists necessarily is simply\ninconsistent with God's creation of a contingent universe. No series of\ncontingent states may have come about by the necessity that\naccompanies God\u2019s actions, since the contingency of existential\npropositions rests on the assertion that God acts, not from necessity\nbut contingently (1900, sec. 110, p. 177). Thus, either the world\nitself has no supernatural cause or the supernatural cause itself will\nact and exist contingently, and so it, too, cannot be necessary and must require a\ncreator.\n\nRelated to this argument is the Problem of Evil. As Russell\nnotes, the creation of a contingent world could never eliminate\nGod\u2019s responsibility for the existence of evil: \n\nThe world, we are told, was created by a God who is both good and\nomnipotent. Before He created the world He foresaw all the pain and\nmisery that it would contain; He is therefore responsible for all of\nit. It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin.\nIn the first place, this is not true; it is not sin that causes rivers\nto overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt. But even if it were\ntrue, it would make no difference. If I were going to beget a child\nknowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac, I should be\nresponsible for his crimes. If God knew in advance the sins of which\nman would be guilty, He was clearly responsible for all the\nconsequences of those sins when He decided to create man. (A1957, 22)\n\n\nIn response to the Ontological Argument, the argument that\nsince perfection implies existence, the idea of a non-existent,\nperfect God is self-contradictory, Russell points out that the\nargument rests ultimately on the mistaken claim that existence is a\nproperty or, in Russell\u2019s terminology, a predicate. His reasoning is\nas follows: If existence were a predicate then, like all other\npredicates, it would (or would not) be part of the nature of any given\nsubstance. But upon being created, each such substance would acquire a\nnew predicate. \u201cHence the special position of existence, as a\ncontingent and synthetic predicate, falls to the ground. If all\nsubstances always contain all their predicates, then all substances\nalways contain or do not contain the predicate existence, and God must\nbe as powerless over this predicate as over any other. To add the\npredicate existence must be metaphysically impossible. Thus, either\ncreation is self-contradictory, or, if existence is not a predicate,\nthe ontological argument is unsound\u201d (1900, sec. 115, p.\n185).\n\nIn response to the Teleological Argument (or Argument\nfrom Design), the argument that the complexity and purpose we\nfind in the world shows that there must have been a creator, Russell\npoints out that \u201csince the time of Darwin we understand much\nbetter why living creatures are adapted to their environment. It is\nnot that their environment was made to be suitable to them, but that\nthey grew to be suitable to it, and that is the basis of adaption.\nThere is no evidence of design about it\u201d (A1957, 6). Russell\nalso reminds his readers about the pre-Darwin observation made famous\nby David Hume, that \u201cit is a most astonishing thing that people\ncan believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with\nall its defects,\u201d is the best that an omnipotent, omniscient\ncreator could have been able to create in millions of years. (A1957,\n6).\n\nIn response to the Argument from Pre-established Harmony, the\nargument that \u201cThe world is so well constructed, we are told,\nthat it must have had a highly skillful Architect\u201d or, as\nLeibniz preferred to say, that \u201cthe harmony of all the monads\ncan only have arisen from a common cause\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p.\n183), Russell notes that this is simply a version of the Argument from\nDesign and that \u201cBeing more palpably inadequate than any of the\nothers, it has acquired a popularity which they have never\nenjoyed\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p. 183).\n\nIn response to the Natural Law Argument, the argument that\nthe existence of laws of nature shows that there must have been a\nlawgiver, Russell points out that the argument arises simply as a result\nof a confusion between natural and human laws (A1957, 5). Human laws\nare commands that we choose to follow or ignore. In contrast, laws of\nnature are simply descriptions of how things in fact are. There is\nthus no need to assume a lawmaker unless the Argument from Design is\nsound, which it is not. Aternatively, if we assume there must\nhave been a lawmaker who brought about these laws, this raises the\nquestion of why the lawmaker chose to make these laws and not others:\n\u201cIf you say that He did it simply from His own good pleasure,\nand without any reason, you then find that there is something which is\nnot subject to law, and so your train of natural law is interrupted.\nIf you say, as more orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws\nwhich God issues He had a reason for giving those laws rather than\nothers \u2013 the reason, of course, being to create the best\nuniverse, although you would never think it to look at it \u2013 if\nthere was a reason for the laws which God gave, then God himself was\nsubject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by\nintroducing God as an intermediary\u201d (A1957, 5\u20136). In\neither case, there is no need to postulate a supernatural\nlawmaker.\n\nIn response to the Argument from Morality (or the Divine\nCommand Theory Argument), the argument that there could be no\nright or wrong unless God existed, Russell adapts the reply given by Socrates to Euthyphro 2,300 years earlier (Plato, Euthyphro,\n5d-15e). Assuming there is a difference between right and wrong, is\nthis difference due to God\u2019s commands or not? If it is, then for God\nthere must have originally been \u201cno difference between right and\nwrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is\ngood\u201d (A1957, 8). Alternatively, if we take a more traditional\ntheological line and insist that God is good, and it is for this\nreason that God commands some actions and not others, then we will\nalso have to say \u201cthat right and wrong have some meaning which\nis independent of God\u2019s fiat, because God\u2019s fiats are good and not\nbad independently of the mere fact that He made them. If you are going\nto say that, you will then have to say that it is not only through God\nthat right and wrong came into being, but that they are in their\nessence logically anterior to God\u201d (A1957, 8). Of course, we\nmight then feel compelled to suggest the existence of a superior\ndeity, one who ordered the God who created world to act as he did, but\nthis option will be of no value to the traditional theist. There is\nalso \u201cthe line that some of the gnostics took up \u2013 a line\nwhich I often thought was a very plausible one \u2013 that as a\nmatter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a\nmoment when God was not looking,\u201d but again, this is not the\nkind of option that would give comfort to the traditional theist\n(A1957, 8).\n\nIn response to the Remediation of Injustice Argument, the\nargument that God is needed to bring justice to the world, to ensure\nthat at the end of time the scales of justice have been balanced,\nRussell asks what evidence we have that such remediation is ever going\nto occur. \u201cIn the part of this universe that we know there is\ngreat injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked\nprosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying; but\nif you are going to have justice in the universe as a whole you have\nto suppose a future life to redress the balance of life here on earth.\nSo they say that there must be a God, and there must be heaven and\nhell in order that in the long run there may be justice\u201d (A1957,\n9). Despite such wishful thinking, we have no concrete evidence that\nsuch remediation is ever going to occur: \u201cSupposing you got a crate of\noranges that you opened, and you found all the top layer of oranges\nbad, you would not argue: \u2018The underneath ones must be good, so as\nto redress the balance.\u2019 You would say: \u2018Probably the whole lot is\na bad consignment,\u2019 and that is really what a scientific person\nwould argue about the universe\u201d (A1957, 9).\n\nFinally, in response to the Argument from Religious\nExperience, the argument that people report having had direct\nexperience of the supernatural or the divine, Russell simply notes\nthat we are just as likely to make mistakes when reporting such\nexperiences as we are to make mistakes in other areas of our lives:\n\u201cIf you have jaundice you see things yellow that are not yellow.\nYou\u2019re making a mistake\u201d (A1957, 161). Thus, it is our total\nbody of evidence that needs to be considered when making such\njudgments, a body of evidence that leans heavily against the existence\nof anything divine or supernatural.\n\nOn the question of whether religion has impeded the advancement of\nknowledge and introduced harmful theories of morality, Russell writes\nequally plainly: \u201cThe objections to religion are of two sorts\n\u2013 intellectual and moral. The intellectual objection is that\nthere is no reason to suppose any religion true; the moral objection\nis that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel\nthan they are, and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the\nmoral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow\u201d (A1957,\n23). The conclusion to be drawn, says Russell, is that religious faith\nhas served as a shield against the advancement of knowledge, both in\nethics and in the sciences: \u201cWhen two men of science disagree,\nthey do not invoke the secular arm; they wait for further evidence to\ndecide the issue, because, as men of science, they know that neither\nis infallible. But when two theologians differ, since there are no\ncriteria to which either can appeal, there is nothing for it but\nmutual hatred and an open or covert appeal to force\u201d (A1957,\n173). Today, no one \n\nbelieves that the world was created in 4004 BC; but not so very long\nago skepticism on this point was thought an abominable crime \u2026 It is\nno credit to the orthodox that they do not now believe all the\nabsurdities that were believed 150 years ago. The gradual emasculation\nof the Christian doctrine has been effected in spite of the most\nvigorous resistance, and solely as the result of the onslaughts of\nFreethinkers (A1957, 28).\n\n\nThe tortures of the Inquisition, the condoning of slavery in the Bible\nand the Koran, the burning of women and men for witchcraft, the coming together to\npray for deliverance at times of plague (which only led to the further\nspread of disease), all resulted from religious beliefs and practices.\nThe conclusion, says Russell, is obvious: \u201cthe more intense has\nbeen the religion of any period and the more profound has been the\ndogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has\nbeen the state of affairs\u201d (A1957, 15).\n\nIn his own time, Russell was criticized severely for his view that the\nchurch\u2019s attempt to keep sexual knowledge away from the young was\n\u201cextremely dangerous to mental and physical heath\u201d (A1957,\n21). Against the practice of his time, he advocated sex education for\nthe young. He also recommended temporary, childless marriages for\nthose not ready to begin a family and held that \u201cChristian\nethics inevitably, through the emphasis laid upon sexual virtue, did a\ngreat deal to degrade the position of women\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361). In support of his view that the writings handed down by\nthe church fathers were \u201cfull of invectives against\nWoman,\u201d he quotes the historian, W.E.H. Lecky: \u201cWoman was\nrepresented as the door to hell, as the mother of all human ills. She\nshould be ashamed at the very thought that she is a woman. She should\nlive in continual penance, on account of the curses she has brought\nupon the world\u201d (1929, 61). Russell concludes that \u201cIt is\nonly in quite modern times that women have regained the degree of\nfreedom which they enjoyed in the Roman Empire\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361).\n\nAmong Russell\u2019s critics, it was argued that in this case and others\nlike it, Russell had simply got his facts wrong:\n\nIt is incredible that a philosopher of note could be so unreliable, so\nunfamiliar with the fact that early Christianity has exalted the\nconception of women in the adoration given to Mary and the saints, and\nthat by treating marriage as a sacrament it emancipated women of all\nclasses from the old traditions of the absolute authority of parents\nand the seignorial power of feudal lords. It is intellectual blindness\nnot to recognize the revolutionary import of early Christianity,\nwhatever the contemporary feeling concerning the sacrament of marriage\nmay be, when it set itself like a wall against the tides of boundless\nsensuality and impressed upon the Roman world the sanctity of human\nlife. (Kayden 1930, 88)\n\n\nContrary to what was often said about his personal life, it is also\nworth noting that Russell did not practice or defend a libertine\nethic. He thought that sex was a natural need, like food and drink,\nbut that it should not be trivialized by disassociating it \u201cfrom\nserious emotion and from feelings of affection\u201d (1929, 127). As\nAlan Wood notes, the result was that \u201cMore than anyone else, he\nchanged the outlook on sex morality of a whole new generation; and\nduring his lifetime he saw the cause of Women\u2019s Rights, once\nregarded as a crank\u2019s crusade, end up as an established part of the\nlaws and customs of the land\u201d (Wood, 1957, 166). As Wood also\nnotes,\n\nPerhaps the finest tribute to his success is that few people now even\nrealize the nature of the old ideas. Russell, it must be repeated, was\nfighting a cruel and indefensible state of affairs where sexual\nignorance was deliberately fostered, so a boy might think the changes\nof puberty were signs of some dreadful disease, and a girl might marry\nwithout knowing anything of what lay ahead of her on her bridal night;\nwere women were taught to look on sex, not as a source of joy, but of\npainful matrimonial duty; where prudery went to the extent of covering\nthe legs of pianos in draperies; where artificial mystery evoked\nmorbid curiosity, and where humbug went hand in hand with unhappiness\n\u2026 . (Wood, 1957, 174)\n\n\nUnderlying Russell\u2019s writings on religion was also his observation\nthat religion is not simply a body of doctrine but also a vehicle for\nthe expression of emotion. This explains why arguments against the\nexistence of the supernatural, although influential among\nintellectuals, are not the main driving force behind most religious\nbelief (A1957, 9). Instead, religion is based largely on fear and ignorance: our fear of the mysterious, our lack\nof knowledge of natural causes, our fear of death (A1957, 16).\n\nWith regard to the propositional content of religion, or what Russell\ncalls theology, Russell notes that central to the idea of Christianity\nare belief in God, belief in immortality and, at the very least,\n\u201cbelief that Christ was, if not divine, at least the best and\nwisest of men. If you are not going to believe that much about Christ,\nI do not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian\u201d\n(A1957, 2). Since it is this propositional content that varies from\nreligion to religion, it turns out, as a matter of logic, that at most\none religion can be true (A1957, xi).\n\nEven so, as Jack Pitt writes, Russell is more than just a\n\u201cheroic heretic hounding the sacred cows of a sterile tradition\nwhile spreading a new gospel of human freedom and secular\nenlightenment\u201d (Pitt 1975, 152). Instead, \u201cRussell sees\nreligion (as distinct from theology) as essentially a mode of feeling,\nperhaps as a set of attitudes which inevitably have practical consequences\nfor the ethical tone and style of a person\u2019s life\u201d (Pitt 1975,\n160). Russell says much the same thing when he notes that \n\nReligion has three main aspects. In the first place, there are a\nman\u2019s serious personal beliefs, insofar as they have to do with the\nnature of the world and the conduct of life. In the second place there\nis theology. In the third place there is institutionalized religion,\ni.e., the churches. The first of these aspects is somewhat vague, the\nbut word \u201creligion\u201d is coming more and more to be used in\nthis sense. \u2026 What makes my attitude towards religion complex is\nthat, although I consider some form of personal religion highly\ndesirable, and feel many people unsatisfactory through the lack of it,\nI cannot accept the theology of any well-known religion, and I incline\nto think that most churches at most times have done more harm than\ngood. (Schilpp 1944, 725\u20136).\n\n\nOne suggestion about the source of this three-fold division is connected to Russell\u2019s love of Ottoline Morrell. Separating religious feelings from religious belief would have allowed Russell to find some common ground with Morrell\u2019s spiritually, without having to accept any particular theology. (See Swanson, 2019, 93\u20134 for a helpful discussion of this suggestion). An alternative view is that the complexity of Russell\u2019s view was generated by the fact that even our most serious\nemotions and most important feelings need not result solely from the\npropositional content of our beliefs. Among Russell\u2019s most\nfamous suggestions about the nature of the good life is his\nobservation that \u201cThe good life is one inspired by love and\nguided by knowledge\u201d (A1957, 44). For Russell, this is a view so\nbasic that it is more like a goal than a description. As a result, it\nbecomes impossible to think of it as a claim purely connected to propositional content. As\nRussell explains, \n\nSuppose, for instance, your child is ill. Love makes you wish to cure\nit, and science tells you how to do so. There is not an intermediate\nstage of ethical theory, where it is demonstrated that your child had\nbetter be cured. Your act springs directly from desire for an end,\ntogether with knowledge of means. This is equally true of all acts,\nwhether good or bad. (A1957, 48)\n\n\nThe result is that in many cases, emotion drives belief: \u201cI\ncannot, therefore, prove that my view of the good life is right; I can\nonly state my view, and hope that as many as possible will\nagree\u201d (A1957, 44).\n\nThese observations should not be interpreted as giving unfettered licence\nto religious belief. As Russell points out \u201csome very important\nvirtues are more likely to be found among those who reject religious\ndogmas than among those who accept them. I think this applies\nespecially to the virtue of truthfulness or intellectual integrity. I\nmean by intellectual integrity the habit of deciding vexed questions\nin accordance with the evidence, or of leaving them undecided where\nthe evidence is inconclusive\u201d (A1957, 169). In the case of\nreligion, it is not simply that such virtues are ignored. Instead,\nthey are positively frustrated: \n\nIf theology is thought necessary to virtue and if candid inquirers see\nno reason to think the theology true, the authorities will set to work\nto discourage candid inquiry. In former centuries, they did so by\nburning the inquirers at the stake. In Russia they still have methods\nwhich are little better; but in Western countries the authorities have\nperfected somewhat milder forms of persuasion. Of these, schools are\nperhaps the most important: the young must be preserved from hearing\nthe arguments in favour of the opinions which the authorities dislike,\nand those who nevertheless persist in showing an inquiring disposition\nwill incur social displeasure and, if possible, be made to feel\nmorally reprehensible. (A1957, 171)\n\n\nSocieties as well as individuals, says Russell, need to choose whether the good life is one that is guided by honest inquiry\nand the weighing of evidence, or by the familiarity of superstition\nand the comforts of religion.\n\nRussell\u2019s writings on religion and related topics include\nChapter 15 of his A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of\nLeibniz (1900), as well as A Free Man\u2019s Worship (1923b), \nWhy I Am Not a Christian (1927c), reprinted in\nWhy I am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related\nSubjects (A1957), \u201cThe Existence and Nature of God\u201d (1939), \u201cIs There a God?\u201d (1952) and What I Believe (A2013). \n",
