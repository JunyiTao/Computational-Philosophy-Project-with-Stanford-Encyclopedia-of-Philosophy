    "main_text": "Informed consent || Comprehension problems\n4.2 Comprehension problems\n\nWhat is the point of the disclosure process? The Nuremberg Code can be\nunderstood to answer that one point is that a research participant\nshould \u201chave sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the\nelements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an\nunderstanding and enlightened decision.\u201d Clearly, mere\ndisclosure does not ensure that. Even when information is given in\nplain terms in the participant\u2019s language, many participants\nfail to appreciate statistical information about risks, or the fact\nthat in placebo controlled trials, they might not receive the\ntreatment under investigation, or the fact that trials aim to further\nscientific knowledge and not necessarily their own medical good. The\nresult is that participants tend to overestimate the benefits of trial\nparticipation and downplay its risks, part of a phenomenon called the\n\u201ctherapeutic misconception\u201d (Candilis and Lidz 2010;\nMiller 2010, 382ff.; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 129).\n\nMany contemporary writers therefore emphasize that truly informed\nconsent requires much more than mere disclosure, and that the point of\ndisclosure, rather, is the comprehension potentially gained through\neffective communication (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 127ff; Manson\nand O\u2019Neill 2007, e.g., 184\u20135). Psychologists and health\nliteracy experts seek effective ways to improve comprehension among\npatients and candidate study participants (Candilis and Lidz 2010).\nAnd when a patient or a candidate participant is known to understand\nthe relevant information anyhow because she is a physician\nspecializing in the field, intuitively disclosure is unnecessary,\nevidence that its point is comprehension and hence, perhaps,\nautonomous decision-making (Beauchamp 2010, 57).\n\n\u201cHowever, a challenge arises in cases where disclosing all of the\nvery serious risks to candidates, results in forms that are so long as\nto inhibit comprehension. When this happens, a preference for adequate\ncomprehension over adequate disclosure may suggest that we should\nneglect to mention at least some major risks. If that seems misplaced,\nthere might be some point to adequate disclosure beyond its potential\ncontribution to the patient\u2019s or the study candidate\u2019s\nadequate comprehension, such as greater transparency and\naccountability.\n\nWhen comprehension remains poor despite repeated efforts to elicit\ncomprehension, what should investigators do? Is enlistment in a trial\nillegitimate, because no autonomous authorization took place (Faden\nand Beauchamp 1986; Candilis and Lidz 2010)? Some philosophers respond\nthat it remains legitimate, because by giving candidates the\nopportunity to issue autonomous authorization, investigators\ndo their parts (Sreenivasan 2003), avoid any potential fraud (Millum\nand Bromwich 2013), and treat the candidates fairly (Miller and\nWertheimer 2010), conditions that they find sufficient for valid\nconsent. Indeed, even the permissibility of skipping disclosure when\nthe patient is a medical expert might be taken to indicate that part\nof the point of informed consent is to prevent fraud, which is\nimpossible when the patient is easily capable of detecting fraud, and\nnot necessarily autonomous authorization.\n",
