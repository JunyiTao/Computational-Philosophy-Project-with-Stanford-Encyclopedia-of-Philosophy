    "main_text": "Philosophical Method || Common Sense and First Principles\n1.1 Common Sense and First Principles\n\n\nReid often articulates his theoretical positions in terms defending\ncommon sense and the \u201copinions of the vulgar\u201d. Indeed, he\nis often described as a \u201ccommon sense philosopher\u201d. This\nreputation owes less to the philosophical uses Reid makes of common\nsense than to fellow Scotsman James Beattie, who popularized common\nsense in his very widely read An Essay on The Nature and\nImmutability of Truth In Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism\n(1770). Even today it is easy to overestimate and to misunderstand the\nrole of common sense in Thomas Reid's philosophical system.\n\n\nThe most important use of the term \u201ccommon sense\u201d in Reid\noccurs in the context of his epistemology and his philosophical\nmethod. Here it refers to a select set of intuitive judgments. Reid\ncalls these variously \u201cfirst principles, principles of\ncommon sense, common notions, [or] self-evident\ntruths\u201d (Essays on the Intellectual Powers,\nabbreviated \u2018EIP\u2019, 6.4, 452). Common sense first principles are\nidentifiable because they typically possess a suite of additional\ntraits (traits, note, not necessary conditions) as follows. Denial of\na common sense principle is not only false but absurd (EIP 6.4,\n462). A common sense judgment is \u201cnecessary to all men for\ntheir being and preservation, and therefore it is unconditionally\ngiven to all men by the Author of Nature\u201d (EIP 4.6, 412). Common\nsense intuitive judgments are \u201cno sooner understood than they\nare believed. The judgment follows the apprehension of them\nnecessarily, and both are equally the work of nature, and the result\nof our original powers\u201d (EIP 6.4, 452).\n\n\nCommon sense principles possess \u201cthe consent of ages and\nnations, of the learned and unlearned, [which] ought to have great\nauthority with regard to first principles, where every man is a\ncompetent judge\u201d (EIP 6.4, 464).  Common sense principles are\ncommon sense because, but not only because, they are common to\nhumanity. Reid's account of common sense does not itself approach the\nstatus of a philosophical or psychological theory. Though his\ncommitment to common sense forms a key component in his philosophical\nmethod, a deeper methodological principle clearly underlies his appeal\nto common sense. Reid attempts to build his fallibilist,\nfoundationalist account of empirical knowledge while working under an\nempiricist constraint that prohibits speculative use of a priori\nreason. As a result, Reid's reference to beliefs held in common across\ntime and place, across culture and religion, functions as an\nempirically justified generalization about species-typical features of\nhuman cognition.\n\n\nThough this marks a point commonly neglected in the interpretation of\nReid, one can often find, in his discussion of common sense, emphasis\non empirical generalizations from observable data about what people\nbelieve and how they behave. For example, he writes, \u201cThe\nuniversality of these opinions, and of many such that might be named,\nis sufficiently evident, from the whole tenor of human conduct, as far\nas our acquaintance reaches, and from the history of all ages and\nnations of which we have any records\u201d (EIP 6.4, 466). Laying\nstress upon his claim about the universality of certain beliefs across\nour species has opened Reid up to tiresome criticism that began in his\nlifetime and continues to the present of the following sort: Reid's\nappeals to common sense are little more than affirmations of majority\nopinion or appeals to the masses, but these are fallacious, so his\ninferences from such principles are defeated. Reid corrects this\nmisunderstanding by emphasizing the fact that his first principles are\npsychological generalizations about belief formation applicable to\nmost of our species (EIP 6.4, 464\u20135).\n\n\nReid often appeals to the structure of languages as evidence for\ngeneralizations about human cognition, belief, and descriptive\nmetaphysics. Language, being something so widely shared, offers an\nabundance of data for observation. Reid finds many commonalities\nacross languages. (The connection between ordinary language and common\nsense that Reid espouses was of great influence on such later\nphilosophers as G. E. Moore and J. L. Austin.) Reid does not believe,\nhowever, that every feature of ordinary language is indicative of some\nimportant tenet of common sense (EIP 1.1, 26\u201327). Reid often suggests\nthat the relevant features are those that can be found in \u201cthe\nstructure of all languages\u201d, suggesting that the linguistic\nfeatures of relevance are features of syntactic structure shared among\nlanguages. Reid says there is some important difference between the\nactive and the passive, since \u201call languages\u201d have a\npassive and active voice. All languages distinguish between qualities\nof things and the things themselves (EIP 6.4, 466). This suggests that\ncertain universal features of the syntactic structure of languages\ninform us of a common sense cognitive commitment, even if it is\nimplicit.\n\n \nMost of Reid's first principles of contingent truth take the form of\nPrinciple 5, which reads \u201cThat those things do really exist\nwhich we distinctly perceive by our senses, and are what we perceive\nthem to be\u201d (EIP 6.5, 476). Such common sense first principles\nare intended to be more than merely generalizations about how\nhumans across cultures form beliefs. Reid intends these general\nprinciples to provide evidence for particular beliefs. Thus\nPrinciple 5 issues in the self-evident belief, for example, that I\nperceive a computer before me (Van Cleve 1999). As a result, Reid's\nphilosophical method accords with common sense insofar as everyday\nperceptual beliefs are evident or self-evident.\n\n\nAn implication of Reid's application of his common sense method to\nfirst principles is that Reid is not concerned to answer questions of\njustification that appear pressing to contemporary epistemologists. He\nis not, for instance, interested in providing a refutation of\nskepticism about the external world by appeal to first\nprinciples. Reid believes he can refute skeptical hypotheses--such as\nDescartes's hypothesis of an evil demon who makes us believe that the\nworld is the way we take it to be when it is really vastly\ndifferent--simply by showing that such a hypothesis is no more likely\nto be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the\nway we perceive it to be. Since the belief in the external world is a\ndictate of common sense, it is, Reid thinks, as justified as it needs\nto be when it is shown to be on the same footing as any\nalternative. Justification, therefore, does not necessarily require\nproviding positive reasons in favor of common-sensical beliefs; common\nsense beliefs could be adequately justified simply by undermining the\nforce of the reasons in favor of alternatives to common sense. In\nfact, as we move through this entry, we will witness Reid's repeated\ndeployment of this strategy in the form of burden-of-proof arguments\nagainst his major foil, the Way of Ideas. Common sense constrains,\nrather than dictates, acceptable philosophical positions.\n\n \nA number of additional problems remain in accounting for Reid's appeal\nto common sense and in his treatment of first principles. For example,\na number of comments Reid makes indicate that he appears to have a\npsychological conception of evidence whereby what is evident forces\nassent. He writes, \u201c[The different kinds of evidence] seem to me\nto agree only in this, that they are fitted by nature to produce\nbelief in the human mind\u201d (EIP 2.20, 292). Just what he means,\nthen, by terms \u201cevident\u201d and \u201cself-evident\u201d\n(terms he greatly prefers to the more contemporary\n\u201cjustification\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d) is an issue\nmeriting further research.\n",
