    "main_text": "The History of AI\n1. The History of AI\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence (AI) officially started in 1956,\nlaunched by a small but now-famous\n DARPA-sponsored\n summer conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n(The 50-year celebration of this conference,\n AI@50,\n was held in July 2006 at Dartmouth, with five of the original\nparticipants making it\n back.[2]\n What happened at this historic conference figures in the final\nsection of this entry.) Ten thinkers attended, including John McCarthy\n(who was working at Dartmouth in 1956), Claude Shannon, Marvin Minsky,\nArthur Samuel, Trenchard Moore (apparently the lone note-taker at the\noriginal conference), Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Allen Newell,\nand Herbert Simon. From where we stand now, into the start of the new\nmillennium, the Dartmouth conference is memorable for many reasons,\nincluding this pair: one, the term \u2018artificial\nintelligence\u2019 was coined there (and has long been firmly\nentrenched, despite being disliked by some of the attendees, e.g.,\nMoore); two, Newell and Simon revealed a program \u2013 Logic\nTheorist (LT) \u2013 agreed by the attendees (and, indeed, by nearly\nall those who learned of and about it soon after the conference) to be\na remarkable achievement. LT was capable of proving elementary\ntheorems in the propositional\n calculus.[3][4]\n\nThough the term \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 made\nits advent at the 1956 conference, certainly the field of AI,\noperationally defined (defined, i.e., as a field constituted by\npractitioners who think and act in certain ways), was in operation\nbefore 1956. For example, in a famous Mind paper of 1950,\nAlan Turing argues that the question \u201cCan a machine\nthink?\u201d (and here Turing is talking about standard computing\nmachines: machines capable of computing functions from the natural\nnumbers (or pairs, triples, \u2026 thereof) to the natural numbers\nthat a Turing machine or equivalent can handle) should be replaced\nwith the question \u201cCan a machine be linguistically\nindistinguishable from a human?.\u201d Specifically, he proposes a\ntest, the\n \u201cTuring Test\u201d\n (TT) as it\u2019s now known. In the TT, a woman and a computer are\nsequestered in sealed rooms, and a human judge, in the dark as to\nwhich of the two rooms contains which contestant, asks questions by\nemail (actually, by teletype, to use the original term) of the\ntwo. If, on the strength of returned answers, the judge can do no\nbetter than 50/50 when delivering a verdict as to which room houses\nwhich player, we say that the computer in question has passed\nthe TT. Passing in this sense operationalizes linguistic\nindistinguishability. Later, we shall discuss the role that TT has\nplayed, and indeed continues to play, in attempts to define AI. At the\nmoment, though, the point is that in his paper, Turing explicitly lays\ndown the call for building machines that would provide an existence\nproof of an affirmative answer to his question. The call even includes\na suggestion for how such construction should proceed. (He suggests\nthat \u201cchild machines\u201d be built, and that these machines\ncould then gradually grow up on their own to learn to communicate in\nnatural language at the level of adult humans. This suggestion has\narguably been followed by Rodney Brooks and the philosopher Daniel\nDennett (1994) in the Cog Project. In addition, the Spielberg/Kubrick\nmovie A.I. is at least in part a cinematic exploration of\nTuring\u2019s\n suggestion.[5])\n The TT continues to be at the heart of AI and discussions of its\nfoundations, as confirmed by the appearance of (Moor 2003). In fact,\nthe TT continues to be used to define the field, as in\nNilsson\u2019s (1998) position, expressed in his textbook for the\nfield, that AI simply is the field devoted to building an artifact\nable to negotiate this test. Energy supplied by the dream of\nengineering a computer that can pass TT, or by controversy surrounding\nclaims that it has already been passed, is if anything\nstronger than ever, and the reader has only to do an internet search\nvia the string \n\nturing test passed \n\nto find up-to-the-minute attempts at reaching this dream, and attempts\n(sometimes made by philosophers) to debunk claims that some such\nattempt has succeeded.\n\nReturning to the issue of the historical record, even if one bolsters\nthe claim that AI started at the 1956 conference by adding the proviso\nthat \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 refers to a nuts-and-bolts\nengineering pursuit (in which case Turing\u2019s\nphilosophical discussion, despite calls for a child machine,\nwouldn\u2019t exactly count as AI per se), one must confront the fact\nthat Turing, and indeed many predecessors, did attempt to build\nintelligent artifacts. In Turing\u2019s case, such building was\nsurprisingly well-understood before the advent of programmable\ncomputers: Turing wrote a program for playing chess before there were\ncomputers to run such programs on, by slavishly following the code\nhimself. He did this well before 1950, and long before Newell (1973)\ngave thought in print to the possibility of a sustained, serious\nattempt at building a good chess-playing\n computer.[6]\n\nFrom the perspective of philosophy, which views the systematic\ninvestigation of mechanical intelligence as meaningful and productive\nseparate from the specific logicist formalisms (e.g., first-order\nlogic) and problems (e.g., the Entscheidungsproblem) that gave\nbirth to computer science, neither the 1956 conference, nor\nTuring\u2019s Mind paper, come close to marking the start of\nAI. This is easy enough to see. For example, Descartes proposed TT\n(not the TT by name, of course) long before Turing was\n born.[7]\n Here\u2019s the relevant passage: \n\nIf there were machines which bore a resemblance to our body and\nimitated our actions as far as it was morally possible to do so, we\nshould always have two very certain tests by which to recognise that,\nfor all that, they were not real men. The first is, that they could\nnever use speech or other signs as we do when placing our thoughts on\nrecord for the benefit of others. For we can easily understand a\nmachine\u2019s being constituted so that it can utter words, and even\nemit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind, which brings\nabout a change in its organs; for instance, if it is touched in a\nparticular part it may ask what we wish to say to it; if in another\npart it may exclaim that it is being hurt, and so on. But it never\nhappens that it arranges its speech in various ways, in order to reply\nappropriately to everything that may be said in its presence, as even\nthe lowest type of man can do. And the second difference is, that\nalthough machines can perform certain things as well as or perhaps\nbetter than any of us can do, they infallibly fall short in others, by\nwhich means we may discover that they did not act from knowledge, but\nonly for the disposition of their organs. For while reason is a\nuniversal instrument which can serve for all contingencies, these\norgans have need of some special adaptation for every particular\naction. From this it follows that it is morally impossible that there\nshould be sufficient diversity in any machine to allow it to act in\nall the events of life in the same way as our reason causes us to act.\n(Descartes 1637, p. 116)\n\n\nAt the moment, Descartes is certainly carrying the\n day.[8]\n Turing predicted that his test would be passed by 2000, but the\nfireworks across the globe at the start of the new millennium have\nlong since died down, and the most articulate of computers still\ncan\u2019t meaningfully debate a sharp toddler. Moreover, while in\ncertain focussed areas machines out-perform minds (IBM\u2019s famous\nDeep Blue prevailed in chess over Gary Kasparov, e.g.; and more\nrecently, AI systems have prevailed in other games, e.g.\nJeopardy! and Go, about which more will momentarily be said),\nminds have a (Cartesian) capacity for cultivating their expertise in\nvirtually any sphere. (If it were announced to Deep Blue, or\nany current successor, that chess was no longer to be the game of\nchoice, but rather a heretofore unplayed variant of chess, the machine\nwould be trounced by human children of average intelligence having no\nchess expertise.) AI simply hasn\u2019t managed to create\ngeneral intelligence; it hasn\u2019t even managed to produce\nan artifact indicating that eventually it will create such a\nthing. \n\nBut what about IBM Watson\u2019s famous nail-biting victory in the\nJeopardy! game-show\n contest?[9]\n That certainly seems to be a machine triumph over humans on their\n\u201chome field,\u201d since Jeopardy! delivers a\nhuman-level linguistic challenge ranging across many domains. Indeed,\namong many AI cognoscenti, Watson\u2019s success is considered to be\nmuch more impressive than Deep Blue\u2019s, for numerous reasons. One\nreason is that while chess is generally considered to be\nwell-understood from the formal-computational perspective (after all,\nit\u2019s well-known that there exists a perfect strategy for playing\nchess), in open-domain question-answering (QA), as in any\nsignificant natural-language processing task, there is no consensus as\nto what problem, formally speaking, one is trying to solve. Briefly,\nquestion-answering (QA) is what the reader would think it is: one asks\na question of a machine, and gets an answer, where the answer has to\nbe produced via some \u201csignificant\u201d computational process.\n(See Strzalkowski & Harabagiu (2006) for an overview of what QA,\nhistorically, has been as a field.) A bit more precisely, there is no\nagreement as to what underlying function, formally speaking,\nquestion-answering capability computes. This lack of agreement stems\nquite naturally from the fact that there is of course no consensus as\nto what natural languages are, formally\n speaking.[10]\n Despite this murkiness, and in the face of an almost universal belief\nthat open-domain question-answering would remain unsolved for a decade\nor more, Watson decisively beat the two top human Jeopardy!\nchampions on the planet. During the contest, Watson had to answer\nquestions that required not only command of simple factoids\n(Question1), but also of some amount of rudimentary\nreasoning (in the form of temporal reasoning) and commonsense\n(Question2):\n\nQuestion1: The only two consecutive U.S. presidents\nwith the same first name. \n\nQuestion2: In May 1898, Portugal celebrated the\n400th anniversary of this explorer\u2019s arrival in India. \n\nWhile Watson is demonstrably better than humans in\nJeopardy!-style quizzing (a new human Jeopardy! master\ncould arrive on the scene, but as for chess, AI now assumes that a\nsecond round of IBM-level investment would vanquish the new human\nopponent), this approach does not work for the kind of NLP challenge\nthat Descartes described; that is, Watson can\u2019t converse on the\nfly. After all, some questions don\u2019t hinge on sophisticated\ninformation retrieval and machine learning over pre-existing data, but\nrather on intricate reasoning right on the spot. Such questions may\nfor instance involve anaphora resolution, which require even deeper\ndegrees of commonsensical understanding of time, space, history, folk\npsychology, and so on. Levesque (2013) has catalogued some alarmingly\nsimple questions which fall in this category. (Marcus, 2013, gives an\naccount of Levesque\u2019s challenges that is accessible to a wider\naudience.) The other class of question-answering tasks on which Watson\nfails can be characterized as dynamic question-answering. These\nare questions for which answers may not be recorded in textual form\nanywhere at the time of questioning, or for which answers are\ndependent on factors that change with time. Two questions that fall in\nthis category are given below (Govindarajulu et al. 2013):\n\nQuestion3: If I have 4 foos and 5 bars, and if foos\nare not the same as bars, how many foos will I have if I get 3 bazes\nwhich just happen to be foos?\n\nQuestion4: What was IBM\u2019s Sharpe ratio in the\nlast 60 days of trading? \n\nClosely following Watson\u2019s victory, in March 2016,\n Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo\n defeated one of Go\u2019s top-ranked players, Lee Seedol, in four\nout of five matches. This was considered a landmark achievement within\nAI, as it was widely believed in the AI community that computer\nvictory in Go was at least a few decades away, partly due to the\nenormous number of valid sequences of moves in Go compared to that in\n Chess.[11]\n While this is a remarkable achievement, it should be noted that,\ndespite breathless coverage in the popular\n press,[12]\n AlphaGo, while indisputably a great Go player, is just that. For\nexample, neither AlphaGo nor Watson can understand the rules of Go\nwritten in plain-and-simple English and produce a computer program\nthat can play the game. It\u2019s interesting that there is one\nendeavor in AI that tackles a narrow version of this very problem: In\ngeneral game playing, a machine is given a description of a\nbrand new game just before it has to play the game (Genesereth et al.\n2005). However, the description in question is expressed in a formal\nlanguage, and the machine has to manage to play the game from this\ndescription. Note that this is still far from understanding even a\nsimple description of a game in English well enough to play it. \n\nBut what if we consider the history of AI not from the perspective of\nphilosophy, but rather from the perspective of the field with which,\ntoday, it is most closely connected? The reference here is to computer\nscience. From this perspective, does AI run back to well before\nTuring? Interestingly enough, the results are the same: we find that\nAI runs deep into the past, and has always had philosophy in its\nveins. This is true for the simple reason that computer science grew\nout of logic and probability\n theory,[13]\n which in turn grew out of (and is still intertwined with) philosophy.\nComputer science, today, is shot through and through with logic; the\ntwo fields cannot be separated. This phenomenon has become an object\nof study unto itself (Halpern et al. 2001). The situation is no\ndifferent when we are talking not about traditional logic, but rather\nabout probabilistic formalisms, also a significant component of\nmodern-day AI: These formalisms also grew out of philosophy, as nicely\nchronicled, in part, by Glymour (1992). For example, in the one mind\nof Pascal was born a method of rigorously calculating probabilities,\nconditional probability (which plays a particularly large role in AI,\ncurrently), and such fertile philosophico-probabilistic arguments as\n Pascal\u2019s wager,\n according to which it is irrational not to become a Christian. \n\nThat modern-day AI has its roots in philosophy, and in fact that these\nhistorical roots are temporally deeper than even Descartes\u2019\ndistant day, can be seen by looking to the clever, revealing cover of\nthe second edition (the third edition is the current one) of the\ncomprehensive textbook\n Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\n (known in the AI community as simply AIMA2e for Russell &\nNorvig, 2002).\n\n\n\nCover of AIMA2e (Russell & Norvig 2002)\n\n\nWhat you see there is an eclectic collection of memorabilia that might\nbe on and around the desk of some imaginary AI researcher. For\nexample, if you look carefully, you will specifically see: a picture\nof Turing, a view of Big Ben through a window (perhaps R&N are\naware of the fact that Turing famously held at one point that a\nphysical machine with the power of a universal Turing machine is\nphysically impossible: he quipped that it would have to be the size of\nBig Ben), a planning algorithm described in Aristotle\u2019s De\nMotu Animalium,\n Frege\u2019s fascinating notation for first-order logic,\n a glimpse of Lewis Carroll\u2019s (1958) pictorial representation of\nsyllogistic reasoning, Ramon Lull\u2019s concept-generating wheel\nfrom his 13th-century Ars Magna, and a number of\nother pregnant items (including, in a clever, recursive, and\nbordering-on-self-congratulatory touch, a copy of AIMA itself).\nThough there is insufficient space here to make all the historical\nconnections, we can safely infer from the appearance of these items\n(and here we of course refer to the ancient ones: Aristotle conceived\nof planning as information-processing over two-and-a-half millennia\nback; and in addition, as Glymour (1992) notes, Artistotle can also be\ncredited with devising the first knowledge-bases and ontologies, two\ntypes of representation schemes that have long been central to AI)\nthat AI is indeed very, very old. Even those who insist that AI is at\nleast in part an artifact-building enterprise must concede that, in\nlight of these objects, AI is ancient, for it isn\u2019t just\ntheorizing from the perspective that intelligence is at bottom\ncomputational that runs back into the remote past of human history:\nLull\u2019s wheel, for example, marks an attempt to capture\nintelligence not only in computation, but in a physical artifact that\nembodies that\n computation.[14]\n\n\nAIMA has now reached its the third edition, and those interested in\nthe history of AI, and for that matter the history of philosophy of\nmind, will not be disappointed by examination of the cover of the\nthird installment (the cover of the second edition is almost exactly\nlike the first edition). (All the elements of the cover, separately\nlisted and annotated, can be found\n online.)\n One significant addition to the cover of the third edition is a\ndrawing of Thomas Bayes; his appearance reflects the recent rise in\nthe popularity of probabilistic techniques in AI, which we discuss\nlater.\n\nOne final point about the history of AI seems worth making. \n\nIt is generally assumed that the birth of modern-day AI in the 1950s\ncame in large part because of and through the advent of the modern\nhigh-speed digital computer. This assumption accords with\ncommon-sense. After all, AI (and, for that matter, to some degree its\ncousin, cognitive science, particularly computational cognitive\nmodeling, the sub-field of cognitive science devoted to producing\ncomputational simulations of human cognition) is aimed at implementing\nintelligence in a computer, and it stands to reason that such a goal\nwould be inseparably linked with the advent of such devices. However,\nthis is only part of the story: the part that reaches back but to\nTuring and others (e.g., von Neuman) responsible for the first\nelectronic computers. The other part is that, as already mentioned, AI\nhas a particularly strong tie, historically speaking, to reasoning\n(logic-based and, in the need to deal with uncertainty,\ninductive/probabilistic reasoning). In this story, nicely told by\nGlymour (1992), a search for an answer to the question \u201cWhat is\na proof?\u201d eventually led to an answer based on Frege\u2019s\nversion of first-order logic (FOL): a (finitary) mathematical proof\nconsists in a series of step-by-step inferences from one formula of\nfirst-order logic to the next. The obvious extension of this answer\n(and it isn\u2019t a complete answer, given that lots of classical\nmathematics, despite conventional wisdom, clearly can\u2019t be\nexpressed in FOL; even the Peano Axioms, to be expressed as a finite\nset of formulae, require SOL) is to say that not only\nmathematical thinking, but thinking, period, can be expressed in FOL.\n(This extension was entertained by many logicians long before the\nstart of information-processing psychology and cognitive science\n\u2013 a fact some cognitive psychologists and cognitive scientists\noften seem to forget.) Today, logic-based AI is only part of\nAI, but the point is that this part still lives (with help from logics\nmuch more powerful, but much more complicated, than FOL), and it can\nbe traced all the way back to Aristotle\u2019s theory of the\n syllogism.[15]\n In the case of uncertain reasoning, the question isn\u2019t\n\u201cWhat is a proof?\u201d, but rather questions such as\n\u201cWhat is it rational to believe, in light of certain\nobservations and probabilities?\u201d This is a question posed and\ntackled long before the arrival of digital computers. \n",
