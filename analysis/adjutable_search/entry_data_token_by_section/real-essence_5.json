    "main_text": "Interpretive Issues || Individual Real Essences\n4.2 Individual Real Essences\n\nA related, but importantly distinct issue, concerns the possibility of\nreal essences for individuals. On the one hand, if every object has an\nunderlying physical constitution, then there seems to be no problem\nwith thinking of individuals has possessing real essences. On the\nother hand, if real essences are only for sorted individuals, then\nthere are no real essences for individuals until we have classified\nthem by a nominal essence; until an individual is sorted, it only has\nan internal constitution, not a real essence. If one adopts the\nrelativized real essence interpretation of the Essay, then\nthere are no real essences for unsorted individuals. If, however, one\nadopts the unrelativized real essence interpretation, then it appears\npossible that Locke could think that unsorted individuals have a real\nessence and not just an internal constitution.\n\nOf course, in III.vi.4 Locke famously denies that anything is\nessential to a particular:\n\n\n\u2018Tis necessary for me to be as I am; GOD and Nature has made me\nso: But there is nothing I have, is essential to me. An Accident, or\nDisease, may very much alter my Colour, or Shape; a Fever, or Fall,\nmay take away my Reason, or Memory, or both; and an Apoplexy leave\nneither Sense, nor Understanding, no nor Life\u2026None of these are\nessential to the one, or the other, or to any Individual whatsoever,\ntill the Mind refers it to some Sort or Species of things;\nand then presently, according to the abstract Idea of that\nsort, something is found essential. Let any one examine his\nown Thoughts, and he will find, that as soon as he supposes or speaks\nof Essential, the consideration of some Species, or\nthe complex Idea, signified by some general name, comes into\nhis Mind: And \u2018tis in reference to that, that this or that\nQuality is said to be essential. So that if it be asked,\nwhether it be essential to me, or any other particular\ncorporeal Being to have Reason? I say no; no more than it is\nessential to this white thing I write on, to have words in\nit. But if that particular Being, be to be counted of the sort\nMan, and to have the name Man given it, then Reason\nis essential to it, supposing Reason to be a part of the\ncomplex Idea the name Man stands for\u2026.\n\n\nHowever, one might argue that in this section Locke is only\nconsidering nominally essential qualities and saying that none of the\ncandidates for nominally essential qualities are essential to a being,\nqua species or genus member, until it has been sorted.\n\nMoreover, the second sentence of III.vi.6, where he inserts the\nclarification that a real essence is \u201c\u2026that particular\nconstitution, which every Thing has within it self, without any\nrelation to any thing without it,\u201d appears to say that there can\nbe real essences of unsorted individuals. If a real essence is\ndefinable as a corpuscular structure cum causal powers that a\nbody has independently of anything else, then it seems to\nfollow that there are individual real essences independently of how we\nsort them. That is, if every natural substance has some submicroscopic\ncorpuscular constitution on which its observable qualities depend,\nthen it seems to follow that unsorted individuals have a real essence\n(see Owen 1991 and Vienne\n 1993).[5]\n\nIn II.xxxi.6, Locke refers to individual real essences: \u201cThe like\nignorance I have of the real Essence of this particular Substance, I\nhave also of the real Essence of all other natural ones\u201d. In\nIII.iii.15, as he is defining the concept of a real essence, he says:\n\u201cEssentia, in its primary notation signifying properly\nBeing. And in this sense it is still used, when we\nspeak of the Essence of particular things, without\ngiving them any Name\u201d. One might argue that, if a substance can have\nan essence prior to being named--prior to having a nominal\nessence--then the only other kind of essence it could have is a real\nessence.\n\nIt is possible that Locke was not always clear and consistent in his\nuse of the term \u2018real essence\u2019 and that these puzzles are\nimpossible to resolve. However, it is also possible that when Locke\nwas focusing on the precise meanings of terms that he was indeed\ncareful, and there is a consistent interpretation of his views on this\nissue. Either way, any interpretation of Locke on real essences must\ndetermine whether there are real essences for only sorted individuals\nor not.\n",
