    "main_text": "Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers || Metaphilosophy\n3.3 Metaphilosophy\n\nWhen analytic philosophy was introduced in the region, it generated an\nintellectual revolution. So, it is no wonder that many Latin American\nanalytic philosophers devoted their efforts to thinking about\nmetaphilosophical issues such as the methods and nature of philosophy,\nthe social role of philosophy, and more. This section presents two\nmetaphilosophical issues: professionalization and the language of\nphilosophy.\n\nSeveral Latin American philosophers thought of analytic philosophy as\na tool to professionalize philosophy\n (Section 2).\n Against this view, Rabossi (2008) presents some heterodox hypotheses\nabout philosophy as a discipline. For example, it is tempting to think\nof philosophy as a discipline that has been practiced for centuries.\nRabossi rejects this picture: on the basis of a detailed historical\nreconstruction, he argues that philosophy as it is practiced today is\nthe result of a split between philosophy and other theoretical\ndisciplines in Germany in the nineteenth century. Thus, far from\nhaving an essence that has been preserved for centuries, philosophy as\nwe know it today is a historically contingent\n practice.[119]\n\nIn recent years, other Latin American philosophers have seen the\nprofessionalization of philosophy with suspicion. Hurtado (2012)\nargues that professionalization led analytic philosophers to try to\n\u201cadjust a small screw in a piece of machinery\u201d, and\nneglect long-standing questions about human existence, the use of\nphilosophical tools to improve one\u2019s life, and the historical,\ncultural, and social context in which one does philosophy in Latin\nAmerican countries. Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2012) replies to Hurtado\nby offering examples where professionalization in the analytic\ntradition has led to philosophical progress about longstanding\nproblems. Quintanilla (2013) responds that the problems Hurtado\nassociates with professionalization are not specific to analytic\nphilosophy. They are not only widespread but also due to the research\npolicies that dominate global research institutions both in the\nhumanities and the social and natural sciences.\n\nLast but not least, Latin American analytic philosophers have\ndiscussed the role of language in philosophical practice. Analytic\nphilosophy has developed for the most part in English-speaking\ncountries, most analytic works are published in English, and\nglobalization has compelled Latin American analytic philosophers to\nproduce philosophy in English. These facts raise the question of\nwhether Latin American philosophers should abandon their native\nlanguage (Spanish or Portuguese) when they do philosophy.\nRodr\u00edguez-Pereyra (2013) and Ruffino (2013) think that\npragmatic professional reasons speak in favor of using English as the\nnew Latin, i.e., a new lingua franca for analytic philosophy.\nP\u00e9rez (2013b) and Hurtado (2013) object that this pragmatic\nstance overlooks the political, cultural, linguistic, contextual, and\nexperiential dimensions of language use. To illustrate, the choice of\na specific language can prompt hasty generalizations from a given\nlanguage that do not automatically hold for other\n languages.[120]\n A way of avoiding those hasty generalizations is to retain the use of\na plurality of languages in\n philosophy.[121]\n Moreover, the pragmatic argument hinges on a controversial view of\nthe language-thought interface. If natural languages are not only\ntools to communicate ready-made ideas, but media within which humans\nshape their own ideas, then the choice of a language can ultimately\nhave an impact on whether some ideas gain currency and others not.\n",
