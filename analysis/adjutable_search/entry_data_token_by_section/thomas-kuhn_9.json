    "main_text": "Criticism and Influence\n6. Criticism and Influence\nKuhn\u2019s work met with a largely critical reception among\nphilosophers. Some of this criticism became muted as Kuhn\u2019s work\nbecame better understood and as his own thinking underwent\ntransformation. At the same time other developments in philosophy\nopened up new avenues for criticism. That criticism has largely\nfocussed on two areas. First, it has been argued that Kuhn\u2019s account\nof the development of science is not entirely accurate. Secondly,\ncritics have attacked Kuhn\u2019s notion of incommensurability, arguing\nthat either it does not exist or, if it does exist, it is not a\nsignificant problem. Despite this criticism, Kuhn\u2019s work has been\nhugely influential, both within philosophy and outside it. The\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions was an important stimulus to\nwhat has since become known as \u2018Science Studies\u2019, in particular the\nSociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK).\n",
