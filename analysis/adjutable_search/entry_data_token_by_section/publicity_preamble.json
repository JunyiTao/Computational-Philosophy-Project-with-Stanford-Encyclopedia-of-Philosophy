    "main_text": "\nPublicity can be opposed both to privacy and to secrecy. This entry will mostly deal with the latter meaning. In everyday life, calls for greater transparency or openness in political and economic life may seem uncontroversial. Still, the precise reasons why and the extent to which publicity should be upheld are not straightforward. Moral and political philosophers, along with social scientists, have until now provided us with only fragmentary elements in this respect. We shall review here what has been gathered so far.\nThis entry unfolds in three parts. We start with hypothetical publicity, and singularly with Immanuel Kant\u2019s publicity test, contrasting his position with the one of Henry Sidgwick and looking both at the justification and implications of the Kantian test (\u00a71). More precisely, our focus in this first part will be on two questions. First, what (if anything) justifies the importance of this test? Second, what are its implications for moral and political philosophy in general and for actual publicity in particular? Hypothetical publicity may appear to some readers as the only genuinely philosophical development on publicity, which is why we examine it first.\nWe then look more closely at actual publicity, focusing on two moments of our political life (voting and deliberation) and two of its actors (citizens and representatives) (\u00a72). Authors such as John Stuart Mill and Jon Elster are our guides here. Secret ballots have not always been the rule. Hence, shifting away from the open vote gave rise to fascinating debates, especially in the 19th century. We then move to analyze the reasons for and against public deliberation, with Elster\u2019s argument from the civilizing force of hypocrisy being our starting point. At least two central questions should be kept in mind while reading this second part of the entry. First, are the arguments in favor of open/secret voting different from those in favor of open/secret deliberation? Second, how much weight should we attach, in philosophical arguments about publicity, to empirical claims, and have philosophers paid enough attention to relevant empirical complexities?\nIn the third section, we introduce the reader to a few dimensions of the concept of publicity as it appears in John Rawls\u2019s work. As for many other questions, Rawls has revived the topic. The ideas of \u201cpublic rules\u201d and \u201cpublic reason\u201d have now become important in political philosophy. We shall briefly present and discuss them.\n",
