    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience || (Emotional) expression\n1.4 (Emotional) expression\n\nA third view takes aesthetic experience to be focused on expressive\nproperties of objects. An expressive property of an object is a\nproperty by which it expresses something\u2014usually an emotion or\nother affect, but more rarely an attitude, a movement, a personality,\nor a way of experiencing the world as a whole.\n\nConsider how this kind of view differs from those discussed in the\nlast three subsections. Although certain forms can be expressive,\nexpressive properties in general are not just the same as formal\nproperties: something might have a deeply expressive coloration with\nvery simple, unexpressive form, like Rothko\u2019s famous color field\npaintings. It is a matter of substantive dispute (to be described\nbelow) whether expressive properties are the same as powers\nto make perceivers feel certain ways, or properties that\nmerit certain mental responses in perceivers.\n\nRegardless of the answers to these questions, two positions need to be\ndistinguished. One is the position that having an aesthetic experience\nessentially or necessarily involves some emotion. The other is the\nposition that aesthetic experience is essentially, primarily, or\nparadigmatically experience of expressive properties of its\nobject. These claims do not necessarily come together. This section\ndiscusses the latter claim (see Section 2.4 for discussion of the\nformer).\n\nThere are roughly four kinds of views of expression endorsed by those\nwho take the primary focus of aesthetic experience to be expressive\nproperties of an artwork (or, more rarely, of nature; see Croce 1902\n[1992], 1938 [2007]; Wollheim 1968 [1980]). These differ according to\ntheir conceptions of how expression takes place, and what it means for\nthe experience both of the creator and of the appreciator of an\nartwork. These are transfer views, projection views, correspondence\nviews, and transformation views (for alternative taxonomies, see\nMatravers 2013 and Levinson 2006).\n\nDebates about the nature of expression and its importance to aesthetic\nexperience are still lively (Matravers 1998, Robinson 2005, 2011, Gaut\n2007, Kivy 1989, 2002, Boghossian 2002, 2010, 2020, Nussbaum 2007,\nMontero 2006a-b, Cochrane 2010, Wiltsher 2016; for overviews see Kania\n2013 and Matravers 2007, 2013).\n1.4.1 Transfer\n\nThe first kind of view is the simplest, but it offers the least\nexplanation of expression. A simple transfer view of expression takes\nit that some inner state or event of the creator is simply shared via\nexperience of the artwork to the observer\u2014i.e. the spectator,\npercipient, or reader. What is expressed on this kind of view is\nusually an emotion or feeling, but it is sometimes a whole perceptual\nexperience or an entire way of seeing the world.\n\nIn the 1802 [1984] preface to his Lyrical Ballads, the poet\nWilliam Wordsworth identified poetry (which, on his view, could\ninclude prose) as \u201cthe spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\n\u2026 emotions recollected in tranquillity\u201d after having been\nfelt in all their heat previously by the poet (p.611; cf. Dewey 1934\n[2007], p. 312). The reader of a poem shares this feeling, learns\nabout this feeling, and thereby feels a pleasant communal feeling with\nthe author. Perhaps the greatest champion of this view was the Russian\nnovelist Leo Tolstoy, who in 1897 [2007] defined art as that\n\u201chuman activity\u201d by which \u201cone man consciously, by\nmeans of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has\nlived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings\nand also experience them\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007 at p. 237).\nSomeone who undergoes an aesthetic experience of art, then, will feel\na \u201cjoy and spiritual union\u201d not only with its creator, but\nalso with those others who experience it (p.239).\n\nThe transfer theory of emotional expression often associates this\ntransfer with an intermediate clarificatory step, and offers as part\nof a theory of the value of aesthetic experience that it offers not\njust emotional experience but a certain organized knowledge of what\nemotions feel like from the inside. In his lectures on aesthetics in\n1819\u201333 [1984], Friedrich Schleiermacher argued that artists\nconceive of works that both communicate their own emotions to the\naudience and clarify them in so doing (p.11). The painter and curator\nRoger Fry moved away from his friend Clive Bell\u2019s formalism as\nhe endorsed it in his early work (\u201cArt and Life,\u201d 1917\n[1981]) to claim that art rouses emotion in us in a specifically clear\nway, cut off as they are from motivating us to specific action in our\nown lives (\u201cEssay in Aesthetics\u201d 1909 [1981],\n\u201cRetrospect\u201d 1920 [1981]).\n\nThe transfer theory of expression of emotions is not particularly\npopular, largely because it seems that an artist need not feel those\nemotions she expresses in a work, and that the audience need not\nthemselves feel those emotions expressed in a work (cf. Langer 1953;\nStolnitz 1960; Matravers 2013). Moreover, different spectators tend to\nfeel quite different emotions in response to an artwork, so it\u2019s\nnot clear that art should be understood fundamentally in terms of\ntransferring just those emotions the creator had (Stolnitz 1960 p.\n186; Wimsatt and Beardsley 1949). Others take the focus on the emotion\nthat an artist felt to distract from the artwork itself (Stolnitz\n1960, p. 164).\n\nAnother kind of transfer theory focuses on transfer not of emotion but\nof sensory experience from creator to consumer. The critic John Ruskin\n(1843\u201360 [2004]) claimed that the true artist (e.g. the painter\nJ.M.W. Turner) could communicate precisely what it is like to have a\ncertain perceptual experience the artist had, by \u201cproducing on\nthe far-away beholder\u2019s mind precisely the impression which the\nreality would have produced\u201d (pp. 86\u20138). The French\nnovelist Marcel Proust\u2014who was a deep admirer of\nRuskin\u2014added that not only could aesthetic experience involve\nthe appreciation of one episode of subjective experience, but it could\nalso involve the appreciation of the artist\u2019s total and unique\nway of experiencing the world, as a kind of subjective personality\n(for discussion, see Landy 2004; compare V\u00e9ron 1879, Stolnitz\n1960 p.161ff.). One\u2019s act of writing, then, can be understood as\na \u201csecretion of one\u2019s innermost life \u2026 that one\ngives to the world\u201d (1895\u20131900 [1984], p. 79). The\ndenouement of his great novel In Search of Lost Time involves\nthe recognition on the narrator\u2019s part that\n\nart, if it means awareness of our own life, means also awareness of\nthe lives of other people \u2026 it is the revelation, which by\ndirect and conscious methods would be impossible, of the qualitative\ndifference, the uniqueness of the fashion in which the world appears\nto each one of us, a difference which, if there were no art, would\nremain for ever the secret of every individual (Time Regained\nin 1913\u20131927 [2003], p. 299).\n\n\nArthur Danto (1981) echoes this idea in his claim that\n\u201cexternalization of the artist\u2019s consciousness, as if we\ncould see his way of seeing and not merely what he saw,\u201d is an\nessential part of expressiveness in art (p.164). This, too, is a way\nof making available to an appreciator a subjective state\u2014but a\nmore general subjective stance on the world, a way of experiencing it\nas a whole, rather than just an individual emotion.\n1.4.2 Projection\n\nProjection views derive largely from mid-19th century to\nearly 20th century psychological thought about\n\u201cempathy,\u201d which was originally called\n\u201cEinf\u00fchlung\u201d in the German (Lipps 1903\u20136,\ntranslated to \u201cempathy\u201d by Titchener 1909 [1926]). Empathy\ntheorists took it that aesthetic experience involves mentally (or\nperhaps even mystically; Vischer 1873 [1994], p. 104) projecting\nourselves into the physical shape of an item to have an emotional or\ndynamic experience of the kind that a human subject would have if she\ntook on that physical shape. In the 1850s, Hermann Lotze (1885\n[1899]) claimed that a shape can \u201ctransport\u201d us\ninside of it \u201cand make us share its life\u201d (quoted by Lee\n& Anstruther-Thomson 1912, pp. 17-18). As Robert Vischer (1873\n[1994]) wrote, \u201cI can think my way into [an object], mediate its\nsize with my own, stretch and expand, bend and confine myself to\nit\u201d (pp. 104\u20135). The Swiss art historian Heinrich\nW\u00f6lfflin (1886) agreed that \u201cwe submit all objects to\nsoulification\u201d in this projective way, and suggested that such\nprojection involved actual workings of the \u201cmotor nerve\nsystem.\u201d\n\nThis view takes it that aesthetic perceivers attribute feeling to\nobjects, but partly by relating them closely to oneself. The\nphilosopher Theodor Lipps (1935) insisted that the \u201cinner\nimitation\u201d involved in empathy involved feeling that the emotion\nin question is felt as belonging to the object perceived\u2014but\nsince you feel \u201centirely and wholly identical\u201d with the\nobject in this context, you feel that emotion as belonging to yourself\ntoo. The English novelist Vernon Lee (real name Violet Paget) co-wrote\na work with her lover and fellow author Clementina Anstruther-Thomson\n(1912) in which they claimed that we attribute \u201cto lines and\nsurfaces, to the spatial forms, those dynamic experiences which we\nshould have were we to put our bodies into similar conditions\u201d\n(pp. 20\u20131).\n\nLater on, the psychologist Herbert Sidney Langfeld offered an analysis\nof The Aesthetic Attitude (1920) in terms of empathy, and\nmade several innovations to the theory as it stood: he noted that the\ncapacity for empathy varies across people (p.133), and that sometimes\nwe project motion onto a shape not by feeling as a human in that shape\nwould feel, but rather by feeling how one who produced that gestural\ntrace would feel (p.122).\n\nThese theorists disagreed on some points, for example: whether such\nprojection was voluntary (Vischer, Langfeld) or involuntary\n(W\u00f6lfflin, Lipps 1935); whether the emphasis of one\u2019s\nexperience is on feeling oneself as identical to the object\n(Lipps 1935 p. 298, Puffer 1905 pp. 12\u201313) or on the\nobject as it might feel were it human (Vischer p. 92,\nW\u00f6lfflin p. 4, Lee & Anstruther-Thomson p. 17); whether the\nemotions in question literally involved any physical bodily activation\nof the perceiver\u2019s nervous system (W\u00f6lfflin, Puffer 1905,\nLangfeld) or not (Lipps 1935); and whether such projection needed to\nbe based on actual remembered emotion or motion of the body (Lee &\nAnstruther-Thomson, Langfeld) or not (Vischer, W\u00f6lfflin, Lipps\n1935, Puffer 1905). But these disagreements pale in the face of the\nbroad consistency of these theories.\n\nFirst: none placed any particular emphasis on the mental, bodily, or\nemotional states of the creator of an object\u2014just on the\nfeatures of an object that made it amenable to the projective\nidentification involved in empathy. Beautiful things, they tended to\nagree, were those things most amenable to this identification that\nwould then offer pleasure (in this way, some of these theories also\nhave ancestors in those who took beauty to be a power to please; see\nSection 1.2). The pleasure to be had in these contexts is thought by\nthese theorists to be universally accessible (Vischer), as a joy taken\nin the \u201cliveliness\u201d (Lipps 1903\u20136 p. 102) of\nobjects, the lessening of loneliness (Vischer), or in particular in\nthe naturally harmonious (Puffer 1905) or intrinsically salutary (Lee\n& Anstruther-Thomson) condition into which such empathic\nidentification puts an observer\u2019s body. In the psychological\ncontext in which they wrote, they were not all exclusively concerned\nwith aesthetic experience per se, although they applied it to\narchitecture and the visual arts (Lipps 1903\u20136, 1935, Puffer\n1905, Lee & Anstruther-Thomson, Langfeld).\n\nRemarkably, these theorists are generally content to make claims about\nidentification and attribution of emotion that sound paradoxical to\nthe 21st-century ear (Goodman 1968 [1976], p. 243; Wollheim\n1968 [1980]). Partly due to the oddity in literally attributing\nemotions to objects or identifying with them, newer descendants of\nthis view focus instead on engagement from the imagination. Levinson\n(2006b) has claimed that you imagine a fictional \u201cpersona\u201d\nin music who is expressing the emotions she really has, and Walton\n(1988, 1994) says you imagine of your own actual experience\nof a work of art that it\u2019s an experiencing of real emotions (see\nMatravers 2013, p. 410, for objections).\n1.4.3 Correspondence\n\nThere is a difference between (i) experiencing certain feelings\nsuggested by a shape\u2019s affinity with a bodily position and (ii)\nexperiencing that very affinity itself. The former simply exploits a\nresemblance in eliciting a feeling experienced as being\n\u2018in\u2019 the object, whereas the latter kind of experience\ntakes as its focus that very resemblance relation. Those who endorse\ncorrespondence theories of expression, and take expressive properties\nto be the focus of aesthetic experience, understand aesthetic\nexperience as belonging to the latter kind. These correspondence\ntheories tend to treat aesthetic experience as fundamentally a matter\nof understanding a meaning that certain artworks already have in\nvirtue of their manifest correspondence with certain aspects of human\nsubjective experience\u2014which correspondence is experienced as\nsuch.\n\nAfter the resurgence of formalism in the early twentieth century,\nseveral philosophers started to think about form as having\nsignificance not just in itself but in the way it manifestly resembled\nor corresponded to emotion (e.g. Fry 1981). The philosopher to develop\nthis view most significantly was Susanne Langer, whose two influential\nbooks Philosophy in a New Key (1942) and Feeling and\nForm (1953) focused on music, poetry, and dance (for commentary\nsee Danto 1984). Music itself, she claimed, bears a \u201cclose\nlogical similarity to the forms of human feeling \u2013 forms of\ngrowth and attenuation, flowing and stowing, conflict and resolution,\nspeed, arrest, terrific excitement, calm, or subtle activation and\ndreamy lapses\u201d (1953, p. 27). This is a \u201cpattern of\nsentience,\u201d the form which lived phenomenal subjectivity of\nfeeling shares with music. Since music itself has this form, it has\n\u201cimport\u201d or significance as well: it \u201cexpresses life\n\u2013 feeling, growth, movement, emotion and everything that\ncharacterizes vital existence\u201d (1953, p. 82).\n\nAccording to Langer, this is not just a matter of conventional\nsymbolization, nor a matter of transmission of the life or feelings of\na creator. What the artist felt in making something, and indeed what\nyou yourself feel when you see it, is mostly beside the point. To the\nextent that there is a phenomenological feeling that pervades\naesthetic experience generally, it should be understood as a\n\u201cpervasive feeling of exhilaration\u201d (p.395). In\naesthetic experience a feeling is \u201cnot\n\u2018communicated,\u2019 but revealed; the created form\n\u2018has\u2019 it, so that perception of the virtual\nobject\u2014say, the famous frieze from the Parthenon\u2014is at\nonce the per\u00adception of its amazingly integrated and intense\nfeeling\u201d (1953, p. 394). Far from erasing the comparison,\naesthetic experience (or \u2018intuition\u2019) makes plain to us,\nin an intellectually satisfying way, how space can mirror sentiment:\n\u201cWhat it does to us is to formulate our conceptions of feeling\nand our conceptions of visual, factual, and audible reality together.\nIt gives us forms of imagination and forms of\nfeeling, inseparably\u201d (p.397).\n\nRichard Wollheim is well known for formulating this subtle aspect of\n\u2018expressive perception\u2019 in several books and essays\n(notably 1968 [1980], 1990, 1994). He treated art objects as\nmeaningful pieces of the physical world to be understood by spectators\nas physical objects which artists themselves intended to be perceived\nin a certain way. These are, and indeed are intended to be, expressive\nof the actual internal life of the artist. But an internal mental\ncondition can only be expressed by an art object via that\nobject\u2019s correspondence to the relevant condition, i.e. that\nproperty of \u201cseem[ing] to us to match, or correspond with, what\nwe experience inwardly\u201d (p.21) in that condition. In an\naesthetic experience of such an art object, the object is seen (or\nheard, or felt) as corresponding in this way to a certain\nfeeling, in a way that involves a spectator\u2019s feeling the\nrelevant feeling herself (cf. Wollheim 1994; see Budd 2008, Noordhof\n2008, Galgut 2010). This is not a matter of \u201creading off\u201d\nthe feeling from the artwork as you might decode an unfamiliar diagram\n(1980 \u00a729, p. 39ff), but rather participating in a certain\npractice of meaning-making and meaning-interpretation which he labels\na \u201cform of life\u201d (after Wittgenstein 1953 [2009]), and\nwhich allows us to literally experience emotion and inner life\nin artworks.\n\nOther views exploit correspondence, and our experience of\ncorrespondence as such, in different ways. Roger Scruton (1974)\nnotably analyzed aesthetic experience in terms of seeing as\n(cf. Wittgenstein 1953 [2009], 1958 [1965]), and stressed in a way\nsimilar to Wollheim that both a perceptual aspect and an aspect of\n\u2018thought\u2019 that can attribute emotion to what is seen are\ninseparable aspects of one and the same experience (p.117ff.). At\nbase, such \u2018seeing as\u2019 is only available when we notice a\ncertain resemblance which we exploit via an act of the imagination to\nhear something like a falling melody as sad (Chs.8\u20139).\nIn contrast with Wollheim, though, Scruton claimed the relevant\nresemblance was between the experience of an artwork and the\nexperience of the emotion, not the artwork itself and the experience\nof the emotion (p.127; for amendments to his view, see his 1999, pp.\n140\u2013170).\n\nBy definition, all correspondence views of expression will claim that\nan experience of an expressive property (aesthetic or not) involves\nexperiencing the correspondence relation itself. In this\nregard correspondence views are distinct from nearby theories.\nChristopher Peacocke\u2019s (2009) view of expression, for instance,\nis a view on which you can hear music metaphorically as sad\nby exploiting, but not by consciously representing or experiencing, an\nisomorphism between music and sadness. This isomorphism might make a\ndifference to subpersonal representational processes, and thereby come\nto causally affect the phenomenology of the experience of sadness in\nthe music, but the relation itself is not experienced, on this\nview.\n\nDespite their differences, the correspondence views of Langer,\nWollheim, and Scruton all agree on one crucial point: the relevant\nexperience of correspondence is not one that can be decomposed into\nstrictly separable aspects, one of what is \u2018strictly\u2019\nperceived and another added element of what is expressed via what is\nseen. According to all, an experience can be one of correspondence,\nbut in a particularly integrated and indecomposable way.\n\nCorrespondence views of expression\u2014which, by definition, take it\nthat you understand an expression partly by experiencing or noticing\nthe correspondence relation itself\u2014are still popular\n(Budd 1995, Kivy 1989, Davies 1994), and still vigorously debated\n(Peacocke 2009, Matravers 2013, Davies 2006, Levinson 2006b).\n1.4.4 Transformation\n\nTransfer, projection, and correspondence views of expression all share\n(at least) one key commitment\u2014the commitment to the idea that\nthe kinds of emotions or mental states expressed in art are one and\nthe same as the kinds of emotions or mental states experienced in\nordinary life. But those philosophers most closely associated with the\nview that aesthetic experience is focused on expressive properties did\nnot make this commitment. Instead, they took expression to transform\nthe nature of a feeling, and took the art-making process to be\ninextricably bound up with the nature of this transformation\n(Bosanquet 1892 [1904]; Ducasse 1929, p. 111; Dewey 1934 [1980];\nCassirer 1944, pp. 142\u20135).\n\nThe British philosopher Bernard Bosanquet propounded an early version\nof this view in his 1892 [1904] History of Aesthetic. He\nclaimed that expression of content through form\u2014and especially\nof emotion\u2014is the ultimate aim of any artwork. That content or\nemotion is fundamentally bound up with its \u201cembodiment\u201d in\nthe artwork, \u201cattached, annexed, to the quality of some object\n\u2013 to all its detail\u201d (p.4). The process of expression\n\u201ccreates the feeling in creating its embodiment, and the feeling\nso created not merely cannot be otherwise expressed, but cannot\notherwise exist, than in and through the embodiment which imagination\nhas found for it\u201d (p.34). While John Dewey (1934 [1980]) thought\nthat aesthetic experience could be enjoyed in various ordinary life\ncircumstances, he considered art intrinsically expressive as the\n\u201cvery operation of creating, by means of new objects, new modes\nof experience \u2026 It enables us to share vividly and deeply in\nmeanings to which we had been dumb\u201d (p.248).\n\nThe philosopher who most systematically developed the view of\nexpression as transformation was R.G. Collingwood, whose\nPrinciples of Art (1938 [1958]) drew deeply from Benedetto\nCroce\u2019s work (1902 [1992], 1938 [2007]). Croce considered\nexpression fundamental to aesthetic experience, and considered\naesthetic experience to be one of the most fundamental modes of\ncognitive interaction with the world (compare Baumgarten 1735 [1954]).\nExpression, for Croce, was not a matter of communication; it was a\nmatter of organizing fleeting impressions into a clarified, meaningful\nwhole, and as such it can happen purely in the mind of an individual\n(e.g. a single artist). A work of art, then, is not to be considered\nany public manifestation, but rather a mental item, a\n\u201ctheoretical form\u201d to be \u201cconvert[ed] into words,\nsong, and outward shape\u201d (1938, in Cahn and Meskin 2007,\np.272).\n\nCollingwood (1938 [1958]) left aside Croce\u2019s unusual metaphysics\nand philosophy of mind, but retained and elaborated much of what he\nsaid about the nature of expression. Real art just is a matter of\nexpression, and expression is an internal process directed at your own\nfeelings. It involves clarifying those feelings in a way that releases\nyou from their dominating influence on your thought and action (pp.\n109\u201310). To express a feeling is to attend wholly to a\nparticular affect-laden fleeting impression, to \u201cstabilize and\nperpetuate it as an idea\u201d in a Humean sense (p.218). In\nattending in this way, you come to consciousness of your feeling, but\nyou thereby also transform it: though \u201cThere is emotion there\nbefore we express it \u2026 as we express it, we confer upon it a\ndifferent kind of emotional colouring; in one way, therefore,\nexpression creates what it expresses\u201d (p.152). Collingwood gives\nthe somewhat unusual label \u201cImagination\u201d to \u201cthe new\nform which feeling takes when transformed by the activity of\nconsciousness\u201d (p.218). Insofar as art simply is expression, it\nis the production not of some object in the physical world, nor even\n\u201ca \u2018form\u2019, understood as a pattern or a system of\nrelations between the various noises we hear or the various colours we\nsee,\u201d but an episode of \u201ctotal imaginative\nactivity,\u201d which asserts the mastery of the self over feeling\n(p.142).\n\nImportantly for Collingwood, a consumer-side experience of an\nartist\u2019s expression is not to be understood as the reception of\na transferred feeling, or as the interpretation of a meaningful symbol\nor sign. Instead, it is a repetition of what the artist herself has\nalready done:\n\nIf a poet expresses, for example, a certain kind of fear, the only\nhearers who can understand him are those who are capable of\nexperiencing that kind of fear themselves. Hence, when some one reads\nand understands a poem, he is not merely understanding the\npoet\u2019s expression of his, the poet\u2019s, emotions, he is\nexpressing emotions of his own in the poet\u2019s words, which have\nthus become his own words. As Coleridge puts it, we know a man for a\npoet by the fact that he makes us poets. We know that he is expressing\nhis emotions by the fact that he is enabling us to express ours.\n(p.118)\n\n\nThis conception puts certain limitations on what aesthetic production\nand spectator-side aesthetic experience can do. Expression cannot be\nintended at the level of the individual feeling, as it isn\u2019t\nclear before expression what feeling is affecting you\n(p.111). What\u2019s more, a feeling when expressed is not purged\nfrom the mind, only recognized for what it is, and controlled\n(p.110).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s view is complicated and often obscure, but\nsecondary literature has elucidated it somewhat. Hopkins (2017) claims\nthat the clarification and freedom that expression offers comes from\nplacing a raw feeling imaginatively into a modal profile, thereby\nprojecting how it would shift with changes in objective circumstances.\nThis can affect the feeling itself in the moment, just as\nunderstanding the square projective shape in front of you as the face\nof a cube can affect the phenomenology of your visual experience of\nthat shape.\n\nThere is an elusive quality to the expression views of Croce,\nCollingwood, and their contemporaries: it is not easy to understand\nthe kinds of transformation, embodiments, or objectifications of\nfeelings that they take expression to involve. But the basic idea that\na feeling expressed in an artwork is thereby transformed in a way\ninextricable from the work itself has proven enduringly popular\n(Stolnitz 1960, p. 169; Sircello 1972, 1975; compare Budd 1985, Davies\n1994, Levinson 1996c, and Shelley 2010; see Wollheim 1980, p. 76ff.,\nMatravers 2013, and Tormey 1971 [1987] for criticism).\n",
