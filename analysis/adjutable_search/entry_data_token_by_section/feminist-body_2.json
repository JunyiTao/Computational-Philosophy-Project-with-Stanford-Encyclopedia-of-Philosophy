    "main_text": "The Second Sex || The Data of Biology\n2.1 The Data of Biology\n\nIn the first chapter of The Second Sex Beauvoir reviews the\ndata of biology. But she does so with a warning. Such data are not to\nbe thought of as determining individual characteristics or social\nlife. With that warning she goes on to describe what are claimed as\nbiological characteristics of the female qua animal or\norganism which, in addition to differences in reproductive\nrole, includes claims that \u201cwoman is weaker than man,\nshe has less muscular strength, \u2026 can lift less heavy\nweights\u201d (1949 [1982: 66]). She rehearses these\n\u201cfacts\u201d while also declaring that \u201cin themselves\n[such facts] have no significance\u201d (1949 [1982: 66]). This is\nbecause \u201cit is only in a human perspective that we can compare\nthe female and the male of the human species\u201d, and from this\nhuman perspective \u201cthe physiological facts \u2026 take on\nmeaning, this meaning \u2026 dependent on a whole context\u201d\n(1949 [1982: 66]). So, for example, in relation to \u201cthe burden\nimposed on women by her reproductive function \u2026 society alone\nis the arbiter\u201d (1949 [1982: 67]).\n\nSuch remarks have led to Beauvoir being regarded as an originator of\nthe sex/gender dichotomy, which became pivotal to feminist theorizing\nin the 1970s (see the entry:\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n Standardly sex was seen as fixed by biology, and gender, as the\nsocial meanings attached to such biology, seen as historically and\nsocially variable, and open to change. It is in this context that\nBeauvoir\u2019s famous claim that \u201cOne is not born, but rather\nbecomes, a woman\u201d, is consistently quoted (1949 [1982: 295]).\nNonetheless Beauvoir\u2019s own position does not map onto this sex\n/gender distinction in a straightforward way (Sandford\n2006, Lennon and Alsop 2019, cp 4). For her the\ndata of biology, offered as facts, lack the fixity which later\naccounts sometimes took for granted. She shows herself aware of the\nway in which cultural myths and metaphors influence the telling of the\nbiological story, even as she herself offers it to us. In pointing out\nthe ideological influence on the descriptions of the active sperm and\nthe passive egg (1949 [1982: 44] she anticipates the work of later writers\n(Martin 1987). Moreover she shows herself consistently aware of the\npossibilities which the biological data leave open to us, stressing\nalternatives to heterosexual reproduction throughout the biological\nrealm, the incidence of hermaphrodism in human and other animals, and\ndrawing attention in the animal kingdom to cases where care of the\neggs and the young is done by both male and female animals. The\nconsequence is that not even the biology of sexual difference is\ndetermined. \n\n\nIt is only through existence that the facts are manifest\n\u2026 and nothing requires that this body have this or that\nparticular structure \u2026 the perpetuation of the species does not\nnecessitate sexual differentiation \u2026 [while] it remains true\nthat both a mind without a body and an immortal man are strictly\ninconceivable \u2026 we can imagine a parthenogenetic or\nhermaphroditic society. (1949 [1982: 390], my emphasis) \n\n\nOn the other hand, the meanings and significance which we attach to\nour materiality do not float free of that materiality. The way the\nbody is lived by us has to accommodate the data which biology variably\ntries to capture, including facts of reproduction, menstruation and\nmenopause. \u201cSex\u201d for Beauvoir was not, then, a biological\ncategory. It is, as Sandford (2006), points out an existential one.\nAnd in exploring what constituted existing as a woman, biological data\nwas just one of the constituents.\n",
