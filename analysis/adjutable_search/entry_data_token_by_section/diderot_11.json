Here, he\nis loosely aligned with Spinoza. But this substance is in perpetual\nflux (a more Lucretian element in his thought), so that the individual\nbeings we encounter are merely temporary, provisional clusters of\nmolecules in interaction with one another, in the midst of what he\nterms the general \u201cvicissitude\u201d of the cosmos (by which he\nmeans its change). In the entry \u201cImmuable\u201d\n(\u201cImmutable\u201d) he writes that \u201cNature is in a state\nof perpetual vicissitude. It follows from the general law of all\nbodies: either they are in motion, or they tend to be in motion\u201d\n(Enc. VIII: 577).\n\nBorrowing a Heraclitean motif and adding a now rather dated gender\ninflection, Diderot also describes Nature as a woman who enjoys\ndisguises (IN, \u00a7 XII, doubtless alluding to\nHeraclitus\u2019 phusis kruptesthai philei, \u201cNature\nlikes to hide\u201d, frag. 208). This is also why there are no\nmonsters in any real sense:\n\n\nI speak of monstrosity relative to what they are at present, for there\nare no monsters relative to the whole \u2026. If everything is\nin fluxu, which we can hardly doubt, all beings are\nmonstrous, that is, more or less incompatible with their corresponding\norder. (OH; DPV XXIV: 317, 403)\n\n\nThe matter of which we, as well as all other entities in the universe,\nare composed, is heterogeneous: differing in terms of energy and\nsensitivity, and in perpetually evolving relation to the Whole:\n\n\nThe world is ceaselessly beginning and ending; it is at every moment\nat the beginning and at the end; it never had, and never will have any\nother. In this vast ocean of matter, not one molecule resembles\nanother, not one molecule is self-identical for one moment.\n(RA; DPV XVII: 128)\n\n\nThat is, Nature is both fundamentally heterogeneous (the atoms which\ncompose the natural world exist in a state of heterogeneity and\nagitation) and never entirely \u201cspecific\u201d:\n\n\neach thing is more or less specific (quelconque), more or\nless earth, more or less water, more or less air, more or less fire;\nmore or less belonging to one kingdom or another \u2026 hence there\nis no essence of a particular being. (RA; DPV XVII: 138)\n\n\nAll beings\n\n\nhave an infinite number of relations to one another, according to the\nqualities they have in common; \u2026 it is a certain assemblage of\nqualities which characterizes them and distinguishes them\n(BI; DPV III: 183)\n\n\nIn this ever-changing Whole, there are provisional constructs and\nentities that are, like everything else, wholly material, but can be\nof greater or lesser significance to us, whether this is \u201ccashed\nout\u201d aesthetically, emotionally, ethico-politically or even in\nterms of nerve impulses (and Diderot, most of the time, is not wont to\ndistinguish sharply between these).\n\nDiderot invented a new form of materialism, drawing on a variety of\nsources including the Epicurean tradition, Hobbes and Locke, Spinoza\nand Leibniz. He also transformed doctrines, genres and nascent\nintellectual constellations (skepticism, the philosophical novel, and\neclecticism, to name some instances). Even if he did not wish to\ncontribute to the genre of systematic philosophy, his contribution to\nthe Enlightenment (and its posterity) and to subsequent intellectual\nepisodes is considerable, difficult to measure, and should be engaged\nwith.\n",
