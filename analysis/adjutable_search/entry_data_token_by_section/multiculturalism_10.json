    "main_text": "Critique of multiculturalism || Feminist critique of multiculturalism\n3.6 Feminist critique of multiculturalism\n\nThe set of critiques that has ignited perhaps the most intense debate\nabout multiculturalism argues that extending protections to minority\ngroups may come at the price of reinforcing oppression of vulnerable\nmembers of those groups\u2014what some have called the problem of\n\u201cinternal minorities\u201d or \u201cminorities within\nminorities\u201d (Green 1994, Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005).\nMulticultural theorists have tended to focus on inequalities\nbetween groups in arguing for special protections for\nminority groups, but group-based protections can exacerbate\ninequalities within minority groups. This is because some\nways of protecting minority groups from oppression by the majority may\nmake it more likely that more powerful members of those groups are\nable to undermine the basic liberties and opportunities of vulnerable\nmembers. Vulnerable subgroups within minority groups include religious\ndissenters, sexual minorities, women, and children. A group\u2019s leaders\nmay exaggerate the degree of consensus and solidarity within their\ngroup to present a united front to the wider society and strengthen\ntheir case for accommodation.\n\nSome of the most oppressive group norms and practices revolve around\nissues of gender and sexuality, and it is feminist critics who first\ncalled attention to potential tensions between multiculturalism and\nfeminism (Coleman 1996, Okin 1999, Shachar 2000). These tensions\nconstitute a genuine dilemma if one accepts both that\ngroup-differentiated rights for minority cultural groups are\njustifiable, as multicultural theorists do, and that gender equality\nis an important value, as feminists have emphasized. Extending special\nprotections and accommodations to minority groups engaged in\npatriarchal practices may help reinforce gender inequality within\nthese communities. Examples that have been analyzed in the scholarly\nliterature include conflicts over arranged marriage, the ban on\nheadscarves, the use of \u201ccultural defenses\u201d in criminal\nlaw, accommodating religious law or customary law within dominant\nlegal systems, and self-government rights for indigenous communities\nthat reinforce the inequality of women.\n\nThese feminist objections are especially troublesome for liberal\negalitarian defenders of multiculturalism who wish to promote not only\ninter-group equality but also intra-group equality, including gender\nequality. In response, Kymlicka (1999) has emphasized the similarities\nbetween multiculturalism and feminism: both aim at a more inclusive\nconception of justice, and both challenge the traditional liberal\nassumption that equality requires identical treatment. To address the\nconcern about multicultural accommodations exacerbating intra-group\ninequality, Kymlicka distinguishes between two kinds of group rights:\n\u201cexternal protections\u201d are rights that a minority group\nclaims against non-members in order to reduce its vulnerability to the\neconomic and political power of the larger society, whereas\n\u201cinternal restrictions\u201d are rights that a minority group\nclaims against its own members. He argues that a liberal theory of\nminority group rights defends external protections while rejecting\ninternal restrictions (1995, 35\u201344;1999, 31).\n\nBut many feminist critics have emphasized, granting external\nprotections to minority groups may sometimes come at the price of\ninternal restrictions. They may be different sides of the same coin:\nfor example, respecting the self-government rights of Native\ncommunities may entail permitting sexually discriminatory membership\nrules enacted by the leaders of those communities. Whether\nmulticulturalism and feminism can be reconciled within liberal theory\ndepends in part on the empirical premise that groups that seek\ngroup-differentiated rights do not support patriarchal norms and\npractices. If they do, liberal multiculturalists would in principle\nhave to argue against extending the group right or extending it with\ncertain qualifications, such as conditioning the extension of\nself-government rights to Native peoples on the acceptance of a\nconstitutional bill of rights.\n\nThere has been a wave of feminist responses to the problem of\nvulnerable internal minorities that is sympathetic to both\nmulticulturalism and feminism (see, e.g., Arneil 2006b, Deveaux 2006,\nEisenberg 2003, L\u00e9pinard 2011, Phillips 2007, Shachar 2001, Song 2007, Volpp 2000).\nSome feminists have emphasized the importance of moving away from essentialist\nnotions of culture and reductive views of members of minority groups\nas incapable of meaningful agency (Phillips 2007, Volpp 2000). Other feminists\nhave sought to shift the emphasis from liberal rights towards more democratic approaches. Liberal theorists\nhave tended to start from the question of whether and how minority\ncultural practices should be tolerated or accommodated in accordance\nwith liberal principles, whereas democratic theorists foreground the\nrole of democratic deliberation and ask how affected parties\nunderstand the contested practice. By drawing on the voices of\naffected parties and giving special weight to the voice of women at\nthe center of gendered cultural conflicts, deliberation can clarify\nthe interests at stake and enhance the legitimacy of responses to\ncultural conflicts (Benhabib 2002, Deveaux 2006, Song 2007).\nDeliberation also provides opportunities for minority group members to\nexpose instances of cross-cultural hypocrisy and to consider whether\nand how the norms and institutions of the larger society, whose own\nstruggles for gender equality are incomplete and ongoing, may\nreinforce rather than challenge sexist practices within minority\ngroups (Song 2005). There is contestation over what constitutes\nsubordination and how best to address it, and intervention into\nminority cultural groups without the participation of minority women\nthemselves fails to respect their freedom and is not likely to serve\ntheir interests.\n",
