    "main_text": "Mutual obligations\n4. Mutual obligations\n\nGilbert has long held that participants in shared activity are\nobligated to do their part in it. Take her well-known example of\nwalking together, starring Jack and Sue. When Jack does something\nthat\u2019s not compatible with walking together, e.g. walking so\nfast that Sue cannot keep up, Sue is entitled to rebuke Jack.\nThis suggests to Gilbert that it is essential to shared activity (and\nintention) that each participant has an obligation to do his or her\npart in the activity (or in carrying out the intention). For\nexample,\n\nThe existence of this entitlement [Sue\u2019s entitlement to rebuke]\nsuggests that Jack has, in effect, an obligation to notice\nand to act (an obligation Sue has also). (Gilbert 1990, 180\u20131\n(1996,\n 184))[34]\n\n\nGilbert has used this mutual obligation criterion to criticize\nreductive accounts of shared activity in terms of \u201cpersonal\nintentions\u201d (1990, 180ff; 2008,499), such as that defended by\nBratman. Bratman 1997 acknowledges that mutual obligations are\ntypically associated with the sharing of intentions, but insists that\nthey are not essential. He argues that when present, the obligations\nare explained in terms of a moral principle that one should live up to\nthe expectations about one\u2019s actions that one has intentionally\ncreated in others. This principle, articulated by Scanlon in the\ncontext of a discussion about promising, does generally apply to\nsituations where individuals act together and share intentions.\n(Scanlon\u2019s Principle F is in his 1998, 304. For recent discussion of\nScanlon and promising that bears on shared activity, see Shiffrin\n2008. For another reductivist response to Gilbert see MacMahon 2005,\n299ff. For more recent discussion of mutual obligation, see Roth 2004,\nAlonso 2009.)\n\nSuppose, however, that we have individuals engaged in an endeavor they\nknow to be immoral, such as that of a pillager and a lazy plunderer\nraiding a village. The inadmissibility of the action undermines the\npillager\u2019s entitlement to hold the plunderer accountable for\nslacking off in his search for loot. There could not be an obligation\nto do one\u2019s part in this activity (Bratman, 1999,\n132\u20136). For Bratman, this shows that there can be shared\nactivity without these obligations. Gilbert responds that it only\nshows that the obligations in question are special, \u201cof a\ndifferent kind\u201d (2009, 178) than the sort of obligation familiar\nfrom discussion of moral philosophy. She goes so far as to say that\nthe obligations to do one\u2019s part are present, even when\none\u2019s partners in shared activity have coerced one into joining\nthem.\n\nGilbert\u2019s later statements become more explicit about the\ndirected nature of these non-moral obligations (Gilbert 1997,\n75\u20136). The obligation relates Jack with Sue in a way in which\nJack and a non-participant are not related (Gilbert 2009; 2008, 497;\nthis connects with recent discussion of \u201cbipolar normativity\u201d; see\nDarwall 2006, Thompson 2004, and Wallace 2013). To mark the\ndirected nature of the normative relation, and in a way that does not\nsuggest as strongly that they are moral in nature, we might speak of\ncontralateral commitments (Roth 2004). Thus, Jack has a\ncontralateral commitment-to-Sue to walk in a way that is compatible\nwith their walking together.\n\nGilbert attempts to articulate the sense of directedness in terms of\nownership: Jack\u2019s contralateral commitment to Sue to\nwalk at the appropriate pace entails that Sue is owed, and in a sense\nowns, the relevant performance on Jack\u2019s part (Gilbert 2008,\n497). This would presumably explain why Sue and not anyone else can\nrelease Jack from fulfilling the obligation/commitment, by giving up\nher claim on Jack\u2019s action. One might, in a related vein, try to\narticulate the directed nature of the commitment in terms of\n promising.[35]\n If we understand Jack\u2019s obligation as the result of something\nlike a promise to Sue, we can see not only that Jack has a commitment,\nbut that Sue is in a special position such that she can, for example,\nrelease him from fulfilling it. One drawback, at least for Gilbert, of\nappealing either to ownership or promising to articulate the notion of\ndirected obligation or contralateral commitment is that it is not\nclear that this would allow for these commitments to be as insulated\nfrom moral considerations as Gilbert seems to think they are (e.g. in\nthe response to Bratman above). A further question is whether\nownership or promising fully captures all that there is to the\ncontralateral or directed nature of the commitment. These strategies\nmight explain why Sue is in a special position to release\nJack from his commitment. But one might wonder whether there are other\naspects of her special standing with respect to Jack that are left\n unaddressed.[36]\n Furthermore, it might be that certain aspects of promising - in\nparticular the directedness of the obligation - might in some way\ndepend on shared agency or aspects thereof. See Gilbert 2011 and Roth\n2016.\n\nWhile the notion of ownership or claim rights is meant to be\nsuggestive of the sort of mutual obligations/contralateral commitments\nshe has in mind, the central explanatory concept deployed by Gilbert\nis that of joint commitment, which she takes to be\n primitive.[37]\n A concern here is whether joint commitment provides anything like a\nphilosophical account or explanation of mutual obligations, or whether\nit merely re-describes them. We get some idea of what Gilbert has in\nmind by contrasting it with personal commitment associated with\nindividual intention or decision (2009, 180). Whereas one can on\none\u2019s own take on and rescind the sort of commitment associated\nwith individual intention and decision, joint commitment can only be\nformed through a process whereby everyone expresses their readiness,\nand it can only be rescinded when all parties concur. This raises the\nissue of the previous section, of how exactly the joint commitment\ncomes into force. Even if everyone expresses a readiness to A\ntogether, it doesn\u2019t follow that we all take the plunge and\nactually undertake it. A further worry Gilbert herself has voiced is\nwhether any condition requiring expression might limit the\napplicability of her view in giving a more general account of\npolitical obligation, something she aims to do (e.g., in her 2006).\nGilbert\u2019s view has also been charged with circularity; it would seem\nthat the expression of readiness needed to establish joint commitment\nwould itself be an instance of shared activity and thus presuppose\njoint commitment. For discussion, see Tuomela 1992, Tollefsen 2002,\nand Schmid 2014.\n\nUnderstood as a kind of obligation, Gilbert\u2019s insight about a\ndistinctive normative relation holding between participants in shared\nagency risks rejection. Many find obligation, and especially the\nno-unilateral withdrawal condition, to be too strong. Gilbert\u2019s\ngeneral idea might find wider acceptance if we talk instead of\ncommitment that allows for unilateral\n withdrawal.[38]\n Finally, Stroud (2010) has suggested a normative condition in some\nrespects even weaker. Stroud holds that participants in shared\nactivity have a prerogative\u2014a moral permission\u2014that can\noverride or mitigate moral obligations had to non-participants (such\nas that of beneficence). It remains to be seen to what extent this\nmight address the intuitions that motivated Gilbert\u2019s original\nand important insight.\n",
