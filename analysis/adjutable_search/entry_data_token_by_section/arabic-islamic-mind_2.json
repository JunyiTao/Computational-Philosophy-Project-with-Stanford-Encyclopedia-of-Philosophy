    "main_text": "Avicenna\n3. Avicenna\n\n\nAvicenna (Ab\u00fb \u2018Al\u00ee al-Husayn b.\u2018Abd Allah Ibn S\u00een\u00e2,\nd. 1037), the multi-talented and prodigiously productive\nfaylas\u00fbf whose work had the greatest impact among later\nMuslim thinkers, unequivocally posited an independent, self-conscious, substantial\nand immortal soul, and with it asserted its\nimmortality. Avicenna could do this, following Plato rather than\nAristotle in positing an essential separation of body and soul.\nAvicenna opens his chapter on the soul in the encyclopedic work\nAl-Shif\u00e2\u2019 (known in English both as \u201cThe\nHealing\u201d and \u201cThe Cure\u201d) asserting this\nseparate\n existence.[21]\nLater, in both The Healing itself and in its abridged form of the\nNaj\u00e2t (called both \u201cThe Deliverance,\u201d and\n\u201cThe\n Salvation\u201d),[22]\nAvicenna presents arguments to support this\nclaim.\n\n\n He views the physical, corruptible body in\nall its parts, including the formal components, as irreconcilably other\nthan the purely immaterial soul, such that the latter cannot be an\nessential form of the former. Rather, the soul is in an accidental\nrelation to a particular body, occasioned by the generation of that\nbody and its need for a central organizing and sustaining principle.\nThe soul itself is generated by the separate intelligences of the\nheavens and emanated by them upon the body, having a natural\ninclination, or proclivity, niz\u00e2\u2018, for the body that has\ncome into\n being.[23]\n\n\n The soul is individuated by the particular\nnature of its designated body, which it strives to bring to moral and\nintellectual perfection. Being essentially immaterial, the soul does\nnot perish with the body, and even retains its individuality, i.e., the\nimages and intelligible ideas it amassed during its sojourn on\n earth.[24]\nAvicenna\nattributes self-consciousness to the soul, an ego that has\nself-awareness and is not to be identified unilaterally with the\nrational faculty (Rahman 1952, 66). Depending primarily on the amount\nof knowledge it accumulated, but also on the life the person lived,\nwith its virtues or vices, the immortal soul experiences continuous\npleasure or\n pain.[25]\n\n\n In this manner, both philosophically and\ntheologically, Avicenna goes beyond his Aristotelian and Muslim\npredecessors. He does this by combining Aristotelian and Neoplatonic\nmotifs in his\n epistemology.[26]\n\n\n The deviation from the hylomorphic ontology\nof Aristotle is apparent in the famous thought experiment that Avicenna\ndevises, conceiving of a person suspended in air in total isolation\nfrom any physical or sensory\n experience.[27]\nThe purport of this experiment\nis to show the ability of a person to deduce the soul's existence\nintellectually, without assistance from the sensory or imaginative,\nmaterial faculties of the soul. For Avicenna this proves that the soul\nis an independent intelligent substance, both prior to involvement with\nthe world, and afterwards, when the corporeal organs that service the\nsoul perish.\n\n\n Avicenna's depiction of the five\nexternal faculties of the soul follows Aristotle's De\nanima, the senses receiving the impressions of their designated\nsensible objects by intromission. In his discussion of the internal\nsenses, however, Avicenna significantly modifies the Aristotelian\ntradition that he received. The more he considered the matter, the more\nhe deviated from Aristotle, in a Platonic direction.\n\n\n Avicenna located the internal senses\nin three ventricles of the brain, placing two in each ventricle, with\nreceptive and retentive capacities\n respectively.[28]\nThe common sense and (one\naspect of) the imaginative faculty comprise the first pair, located in\nthe front ventricle of the brain. The common sense coordinates the\nimpressions received by the individual senses, in order to produce a\nunified picture of a sensible object. This includes, as Aristotle said,\nimpressions that are related incidentally (kata\nsymbebek\u00ea) to the\n object,[29]\na phenomenon that links memory of past\nsensible impressions to a current sensation. This indicates a certain\ncapacity to make judgments present already in the common sense.\n\n\n The sensible forms that the common sense\nreceives and unifies are then transmitted to the imaginative faculty,\nas Aristotle had said; except that Avicenna divides this faculty,\ncalling the first appearance a quwwah musawwirah, or\nkhay\u00e2l. It retains these forms fully, and is thus called\nin English, after the Arabic, the \u201cretentive\u201d as well as\n\u201cinforming,\u201d or \u201cformative,\u201d\n imagination.[30]\n\n\n The middle ventricle is the location of the\nnext pair of internal senses, as Avicenna first conceived them. They\ncomprise a novel faculty of \u201cestimation\u201d (following the\nLatin aestimatio), wahm in Arabic; and a second,\nchameleon type faculty. It functions both imaginatively (in animals and\nhumans), and rationally (in humans alone). As another aspect of the\nimaginative faculty, Avicenna calls it simply\nal-mutakhayy\u00eelah, \u201cthe imagination,\u201d but due to its\nfunction it is known as the \u201ccompositive imagination.\u201d\nHowever, when this faculty deals with specific, materially based\nconcepts, Avicenna calls it q\u00fbwah mufakkirah, a thinking\nor \u201ccogitative\u201d faculty.\n\n\n Avicenna posits the existence of an\nestimative faculty in order to explain the innate ability in all\nanimals (humans included) to sense a non-sensible intention\n(ma\u2018nan) that is intrinsic to the object as perceived by the\nsubject. Intentions are thus the extra-sensible properties that\nan object presents to an animal or person at the moment of perception.\nThese intentions affect the perceiver powerfully, such as the negative\nfeelings a sheep senses in perceiving a wolf, or the positive feelings\nsensed in perceiving a friend or\n child.[31]\n\n\n Avicenna does not limit wahm to\nanimals, as Averroes later\n assumed,[32]\nbut rather conceived it broadly, affecting\nlogical as well as physical subjects. He believed estimation grasps the\ncore characteristic of every discrete physical object, the intention\nthat distinguishes it from every other object.\n\n\n In addition to the faculty of estimation,\nand akin to it in being innate and spontaneous, Avicenna recognized,\nwith Aristotle, a faculty of intuition (hads) that is the key\nstep in obtaining certain knowledge. This is the ability a person has\nto discern suddenly the middle term of a putative syllogism, the\nproposition that anchors a particular\n argument.[33]\nAvicenna recognizes that\noccasionally brilliant individuals exist whose intuitive sense is so\ninnately strong that they can do without much prior experience,\nempirically or rationally. In extreme and rare cases, there are\nindividuals, like the prophets, with a developed intuitive acumen,\ndhak\u00e2\u2019 (Aristotle's anchinoia), that\nenables them to know instantly the entire subject matter of a given\nscience. While not part of his normative epistemology, Avicenna\nattempts to accommodate this phenomenon scientifically, seeing it not\nas an innate power of an internal sense, but as an expression, however\nrare, of the emanative powers of the Agent Intellect.\n\n\n Avicenna believes that the intentions that\nthe estimative faculty obtains are received in the third and rear\nventricle of the brain, in memory, hafizah . Memory shares the\nthird ventricle with a faculty of recollection (dhikr), which\nretains the estimative intentions ready for recall.\n\n\n Remembering for Avicenna thus consists in\nthe collation by the imaginative/cogitative faculty of estimative\nintentions on the one hand, and the appropriate sensible forms retained\nby the formative imagination, on the other. For that reason, this\n\u201csecond\u201d aspect of the imaginative faculty is referred to as the\n\u201ccompositive imagination;\u201d both it and the cogitative\nfaculty deal with specific sensible forms and concepts, respectively,\npresenting them exactly and completely. They do this by combining the\nimpressions received by the common sense and estimation, and separating\nout what is not relevant to the object.\n\n\n The cogitative faculty is primarily\nconcerned with practical issues rooted in material being, forming\njudgments based on empirical data with the help of innate powers of\nabstraction and logical acumen. In what may well be a nod to tradition,\nAvicenna counts the \u201creports (al-akhb\u00e2r) to which\nthe soul gives assent on account of unbroken and overwhelming tradition\n(shiddah al-taw\u00e2tur)\u201d as a further credible source\nfor forming practical\n judgments.[34]\n\n\n For Avicenna, animals have this developed imaginative\nfaculty only. It allows them to represent to themselves that which they\nremember, and also affords them the ability, like human beings, to\ndream. The cogitative faculty in human beings, on the other hand,\nallows them to go beyond instinctive remembering, and introduces an\nelement of rational deliberation that is limited primarily to purely\nindividual, discrete objects and\n actions.[35]\n\n\n Avicenna considers estimation to be\ninvolved with the cogitative faculty in reconstructing a specific,\nphysically based concept. As such, it can influence that faculty, and\nwhen excessive, be responsible for the fantasies and fictions in our\ndreams and thoughts (Black 2000, 227\u201328). Similarly, the estimative\nfaculty can over-reach itself in logical matters by using the\nsyllogisms that it helped create to pass judgments on immaterial\nbeings, thus leading to false judgments in\n metaphysics.[36]\n\n\n As described, many of the internal senses,\nparticularly the extended activities of estimation and the cogitative\nfaculty, perform in ways that encroach upon the preserve of the\nrational faculty and threaten to compromise its objectivity and\nseparate, immaterial nature, damaging the soul in its quest for\nimmortal bliss. Consequently, in his later writings Avicenna distanced\nintuition from any physical base within estimation and the brain,\nlocating it amorphously in the soul as a divine emanation; and he\nlimited the internal faculty of cogitation to thinking of particular\nconceptual concepts\n only.[37]\n\n\n This attempt to separate the rational\nfaculty from the internal senses is echoed in Avicenna's\ntreatment of the stages in the development of the intellect. He views\nthe entire cognitive process in which the internal senses were\npreoccupied as a necessary (for most people) but insufficient condition\nfor possessing true knowledge. The efforts of the internal senses are\nseen in some of his major compositions as having but a propadeutic\neffect on the soul, preparing it to receive the universal intelligible\nnotions that are its ultimate goal and, ultimately, its sole concern.\nThese intelligible ideas are not abstracted from the imagination, as\nAristotle would have it, but come from the universal Agent Intellect,\ntransforming the purely potential and passive intellect into an\n acquired intellect (\u2018aql mustaf\u00e2d).[38]\nThis is an active state of\ncognition, when the intellect is actively conjoined to its intelligible\nobject. Ultimately, this conjunction is with the Agent Intellect, the\nsource of all forms on earth.\n\n\n Avicenna also posits, as had\nAristotle originally, the existence of an intermediate stage of\npotentiality, calling it an \u201cintellect in habitu\u201d\n(al-\u2018aql bi\u2019l-malakah). At this stage, the\nintellect's acquired intelligibles are not being used, and are\ntherefore\n potential.[39]\nHowever, treating the active acquired\nintellligibles as potential seemed contradictory to Avicenna, so he\nreturns them to the Agent Intellect, where they are deposited and await\nrecollection by the intellect in habitu. This intellect does\nnot therefore store the acquired intelligibles, but merely serves to\nfacilitate their reacquisition from the Agent\n Intellect.[40]\n\n\n The Agent intellect is, then, the source of\nintelligible forms on earth, and the source of our being able to\nconceive of them. It functions much as does the sun, illuminating both\nsubject and object of intellection, and is present at every stage of\nthe individual person's intellectual development (Davidson 1992,\n86, 87, 92).\n\n\n While most people require preliminary\ntraining of the senses to prepare their souls for intellectual\ncognition, which the Agent Intellect automatically\n grants,[41]\nsome few\nindividuals with prodigious intuitions can, as we saw, grasp\nintelligible concepts and propositions immediately. Avicenna labels the\nintellects of such intuitively endowed persons \u201choly\u201d\n(\u2018aql quds\u00ee), and calls the Agent Intellect the\n \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d (al-r\u00fbh al-quds\u00ee).[42]\nProphets have\nthis sense to an extreme degree, receiving emanations of all, or nearly\nall, of the intelligible forms in the Agent Intellect. It is \u201cnot\nfar-fetched\u201d (wa l\u00e2 yab\u2018ud), Avicenna says, that the\nimaginative faculties of such persons are able to depict the emanated\nuniversal intelligible forms in particular, sensory,\n terms.[43]\n\n\n Prophecy is thus a natural, if exceptional,\noccurrence for Avicenna, who equivocates on the issue of personal\nprovidence. However much God is the final cause of intellection, He is\nnot directly involved in the entire process, a sanctified Agent\nIntellect being His intermediary to man. Here as elsewhere, we see\nAvicenna attempt to accommodate his philosophy to traditional religious\nconceptions.\n\n\n Avicenna has severed the natural link\nbetween imagination and intellection, in order to preserve the\nimmaterial and immortal nature of the soul. It is dependent on the\nAgent Intellect entirely, with only the soul's independent\nsubstantiality separating it from being totally absorbed in it.\n",
