    "main_text": "The later Luk\u00e1cs: Praxis, Totality, and Freedom || The Ontology of Social Being\n4.3 The Ontology of Social Being\n\nThe most fundamental level on which Luk\u00e1cs develops his revised\nmodel of Hegelian Marxism is that of ontology, or, more specifically,\nan \u201contology of social being.\u201d Luk\u00e1cs claims that,\nas far as ontology is concerned, we can distinguish three levels of\nbeing in the world: material or inorganic being, organic life, and\nsocial reality (GW 13: 22). All three levels are\ndistinguished by a division between the genuine essence of entities\nand their appearance. While on all three levels entities appear as\nfixed objects, their real essence is always that of interrelated,\nirreversible processes (GW 13: 240). This entails that the\nbasic form of all being is temporality and historicity\n(GW 13: 228). \n\nWhile this general ontology remains underdeveloped and is not informed\nby much knowledge of concurrent philosophical developments,\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s theory of social reality has contemporary relevance.\nSocial reality, Luk\u00e1cs claims, differs from the other levels of\nreality not only insofar as it is governed by causal, non-teleological\nlaws but also insofar as it contains an element of teleology\nas a result of \u201cteleological positing\u201d (GW 13:\n20; 1971c: 12ff.). Due to their ability to perform labor, humans can\n\u201cposit\u201d functions or goals that are to govern the natural,\ncausal processes they manipulate. By choosing one of the potential\nresults of the employment of their natural and technological\ncapacities as the correct one, individuals can draw a distinction\nbetween successful and unsuccessful executions of their intended\nactions in labor. This, Luk\u00e1cs argues, introduces normative\ndistinctions or values into the world (see 1971b: 75f and\n153\u2013156; 1968: 140). In particular, Luk\u00e1cs claims that\nthe objectification of human intentions in institutions enables us to\nunderstand the existence of objective values as products of\nsocial-historical developments without sliding into historical\nrelativism. However, as some of his own students noted, this\nexplanation remains too unclear to solve the problem of normativity\nfor Marxism (see Feh\u00e9r et al., 1976). The same doubts remain with\nregard to Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s further claim that there is one\nfundamental, immanent value of social history, namely the unfettered\ndevelopment of human capacities (GW 14: 153).\n\nBecause Luk\u00e1cs sees the process of labor as the foundation of\nall social and normative phenomena (see also 1971c: 65; Thompson\n2011), the totality of society can be described as the totality of all\nrelations between the teleological acts of \u201cpositing\u201d\nconditions of success in labor. However, even though Luk\u00e1cs\nthus acknowledges intentional consciousness as an irreducible factor\nin these acts (see Luk\u00e1cs 1968: 138), their meaning is\nultimately determined by the objective, historical development of\nsocial relations. \n\nFrom these ontological commitments it follows that intentionality,\nwhich guides individual acts of labor, is a condition for the\nexistence of the totality of social facts, and vice versa\n(see Tertullian 1988). In particular, he describes language and\ninstitutions as media of \u201cindirect\u201d teleological positing\nbecause they enable forms of action that do not directly modify nature\nbut that indirectly aspire to bring others to do so (GW 14:\n172; 1968: 142). Although he remains committed to the primacy of\nlabor, Luk\u00e1cs allows that these linguistic and institutional\nmediations acquire a dynamic of their own over time, becoming\nindependent of the goal of dominating nature, in particular because\nthey allow for a generalization of the cognitive grasping of\nparticular phenomena (see GW 13: 47; GW 14: 165ff,\n342\u2013357) and for greater distance between subject and object\n(1971c: 100).\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s conception of individuality as a product of the\nchoice between alternatives within a socially determined totality\nultimately led to a theory of alienation that partially\nreplaced the theory of reification of his younger years. Whereas the\nlatter theory was closely connected to the ideal of the collective\nreappropriation of society, Luk\u00e1cs describes alienation in the\nOntology as primarily the result of social conditions that\nturn individuals into merely \u201cparticular\u201d\npersonalities (GW 14: 530) instead of allowing them to\ndevelop their capacities to the degree that the present development of\nproductive forces could make possible. This means that alienation (for\ninstance the alienation brought about by excessive professional\nspecialization) must be understood as the socially induced incapacity\nof individuals to participate in \u201cspecies being\u201d or the\nsocial totality. The overcoming of alienation thus always\ndemands\u2014along with social changes\u2014subjective\ntransformation, i.e., individual change (GW 14: 551). This\npoints towards the ethical dimension of the\nOntology. Luk\u00e1cs claims that there is a normative\nideal immanent in society as such, namely, the ideal of social\nrelations that allow all to fully participate in the social totality\nwith their whole personality, thereby realizing their universal\nnature. This suggests a conception of political praxis that\namounts to a form of democratic politics.\n",
