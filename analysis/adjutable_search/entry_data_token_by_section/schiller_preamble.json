    "main_text": "\n\nJohann Christoph Friedrich Schiller (1759\u20131805) is best known\nfor his immense influence on German literature. In his relatively\nshort life, he authored an extraordinary series of dramas, including\nThe Robbers, Maria Stuart, and the trilogy\nWallenstein. He was also a prodigious poet, composing perhaps\nmost famously the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d featured in the culmination\nof Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony and enshrined, some two centuries\nlater, in the European\n Hymn.[1]\n In part through his celebrated friendship with Goethe, he edited\nepoch-defining literary journals and exerted lasting influence on\nGerman stage production. He is sometimes referred to as the German\nShakespeare; his are still among the most widely produced German plays\nboth in Germany and internationally.\n\nIn addition to his literary accomplishments, Schiller was a formidable\nphilosophical thinker. Between 1791 and 1796, he authored a range of\ntheoretical works that are both sophisticated and original. These\nwritings primarily concern aesthetics, but they stake out notable\npositions on ethics, metaphysics, ontology, and political theory as\nwell. Together, his essays helped shape one of the most prolific\nperiods of German philosophizing; since then, they have served as a\nsignificant source of philosophical insight from an aesthetic\npractitioner of the highest standing.\n",
