    "main_text": "\n\nOn March 7, 1277, the Bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, prohibited the\nteaching of 219 philosophical and theological theses that were being\ndiscussed and disputed in the faculty of arts under his jurisdiction.\nTempier\u2019s condemnation has gained great symbolic meaning in the\nminds of modern intellectual historians, and possibly for this reason,\nthere is still considerable disagreement about what motivated Tempier\nto promulgate his prohibition, what exactly was condemned, and who the\ntargets were. In addition, the effects of Tempier\u2019s action on\nthe course of medieval thought in the thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies, and even beyond, has been the subject of much debate. The\nlack of a commonly accepted standard account of Tempier\u2019s\nactions plus the enormous amount of literature and of textual evidence\nthat either directly or indirectly bears on the events of 1277, puts\nspecific limitations to the present entry. It will be confined to\npresenting those historical facts that are uncontroversial and to\nindicating the main issues of current debate with respect to\nTempier\u2019s condemnation.\n",
