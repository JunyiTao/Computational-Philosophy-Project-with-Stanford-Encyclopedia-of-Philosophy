    "main_text": "\n\n\nTime flies like an arrow.\u2026 Fruit flies like a banana.\n\u2014Oettinger (1966)\n\n\nMany languages have grammatical means to indicate the time when an\naction or event occurs, or when a state or process holds. This\nphenomenon is called tense. In English, for example, adding\nthe morpheme -ed to the verb walk, to form\nwalked, indicates that the event denoted by the verb occurred\nbefore the present time. What is called aspect, on the other\nhand, deals with the internal constituency of actions, events, states,\nprocesses or situations. For instance, it may indicate that an action\nis completed or still ongoing. English typically uses the\n-ing form of verbs to indicate ongoing processes, as in\nHe is building a house. \n\nAfter a short introduction to basic notions of tense and aspect we\nbriefly discuss temporal logic, and then Reichenbach\u2019s famous\ndistinction between speech time, event time and reference\ntime. Event-based semantic theories treat events as ontological\nprimitives, so in the following section we show how time can be\nconstructed from event structures, as exemplified by the Russell-Kamp\nconstruction. These sections are followed by a discussion of the most\nimportant observations concerning lexical and grammatical aspect,\nincluding the famous imperfective paradox. Next we introduce two\nwidely discussed theories of temporality and show how they cope with\nthe imperfective paradox. This section is followed by one that shows\nhow temporal information is expressed in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). We use the event calculus from AI to present a solution of the\nimperfective paradox, by viewing it as an instance of the frame\nproblem. The last section is devoted to gathering psycholinguistic\nevidence showing that at least some of the philosophical and semantic\nconcepts discussed in this article may be cognitively real. \n",
