    "main_text": "Varieties of Empiricism || Justificatory Empiricism\n2.3 Justificatory Empiricism\n\nA final form of empiricism is what we may call justificatory\nempiricism. In its strongest form, an empiricism of this kind is\nindifferent as to the origins of our ideas and can tolerate inferences\nto unobservable entities. It merely insists that wherever our ideas\ncome from and whatever explanatory claims we make, these cannot be\nregarded as justified until they have been successfully tested against\nexperience. Within twentieth-century philosophy, this position is\nassociated with a sharp distinction between the \u201ccontext of\ndiscovery\u201d and the \u201ccontext of justification\u201d\n(Reichenbach 1938: 6\u20137), with justificatory empiricists focusing\non the latter. For Karl Popper (1902\u20131994), for instance, the\nquestion of how a theory is discovered is irrelevant to its epistemic\nstatus; what matters is whether that theory has explanatory power and\nhas withstood severe testing (Popper 1935 [2002: 7\u20138]). On the\nface of it, this does seem a recent position. Perhaps no philosopher\nbefore Popper would have regarded the origins of an idea as entirely\nirrelevant to its standing. But there are hints of a modest kind of\njustificatory empiricism in the work of some ancient and medieval\nthinkers, who held that factual claims arrived at by deductive\nreasoning lack credibility if they have not also been tested against\nexperience.\n",
