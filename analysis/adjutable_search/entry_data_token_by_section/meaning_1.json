    "main_text": "Semantic Theories\n2. Semantic Theories\n\nThe task of explaining the main approaches to semantic theory in\ncontemporary philosophy of language might seem to face an in-principle\nstumbling block. Given that no two languages have the same\nsemantics\u2014no two languages are comprised of just the same words,\nwith just the same meanings\u2014it may seem hard to see how we can\nsay anything about different views about semantics in general, as\nopposed to views about the semantics of this or that language. This\nproblem has a relatively straightforward solution. While it is of\ncourse correct that the semantics for English is one thing and the\nsemantics for French something else, most assume that the various\nnatural languages should all have semantic theories of (in a sense to\nbe explained) the same form. The aim of what follows will,\naccordingly, be to introduce the reader to the main approaches to\nnatural language semantics\u2014the main views about the right form\nfor a semantics for a natural language to take\u2014rather than to provide a\ndetailed examination of the various views about the semantics of some\nparticular expression. (For an overview, see the entry on\n word meaning.\n For discussion of issues involving particular expression types, see\nthe entries on\n names,\n quantifiers and quantification,\n descriptions,\n propositional attitude reports, and\n natural kinds.)\n\nOne caveat before we get started: before a semantic theorist sets off\nto explain the meanings of the expressions of some language, she needs\na clear idea of what she is supposed to explain the meaning\nof. This might not seem to present much of a problem;\naren\u2019t the bearers of meaning just the sentences of the relevant\nlanguage, and their parts? This is correct as far as it goes. But the\ntask of explaining what the semantically significant parts of a\nsentence are, and how those parts combine to form the sentence, is as\ncomplex as semantics itself, and has important consequences for\nsemantic theory. Indeed, most disputes about the right semantic\ntreatment of some class of expressions are intertwined with questions\nabout the syntactic form of sentences in which those expressions\nfigure. Unfortunately, discussion of theories of this sort, which\nattempt to explain the syntax, or logical form, of natural language\nsentences, is well beyond the scope of this entry. As a result,\nfigures like Richard Montague, whose work on syntax and its connection\nto semantics has been central to the development of semantic theory\nover the past few decades, are passed over in what\nfollows. (Montague\u2019s essays are collected in Montague 1974.) For\nan excellent introduction to the connections between syntax and\nsemantics, see Heim & Kratzer (1998); for an overview of the\nrelations between philosophy of language and several branches of\nlinguistics, see Moss (2012).\n\nThere are a wide variety of approaches to natural language semantics.\nMy strategy in what follows will be to begin by explaining one\nprominent family of approaches to semantics which developed over the\ncourse of the twentieth century and is still prominently represented\nin contemporary work in semantics, both in linguistics and in\nphilosophy. For lack of a better term, let's call these types of\nsemantic theories classical semantic theories. (As in\ndiscussions of classical logic, the appellation\n\u201cclassical\u201d is not meant to suggest that theories to which\nthis label is applied are to be preferred over others.) Classical\nsemantic theories agree that sentences are (typically) true or false,\nand that whether they are true or false depends on what information\nthey encode or express. This \u201cinformation\u201d is often called\n\u201cthe proposition expressed by the sentence\u201d. The job of a\nsemantic theory, according to the classical theorist, is at least in\nlarge part to explain how the meanings of the parts of the sentence,\nalong with the context in which the sentence is used, combine to\ndetermine which proposition the sentence expresses in that context\n(and hence also the truth conditions of the sentence, as used in that\ncontext).\n\nClassical semantic theories are discussed in\n \u00a72.1.\nIn\n \u00a7\u00a72.1.1\u20134\n the theoretical framework common to classical semantic\ntheories is explained; in\n \u00a7\u00a72.1.5\u20137\nthe differences between three main versions of classical\nsemantic theories are explained. In\n \u00a72.2\n there is a discussion of the alternatives to classical semantic theories. \n In \n \u00a72.3\n few general concluding questions are discussed; these are questions\n semantic theorists face\nwhich are largely, though not completely, orthogonal to one\u2019s\nview about the form which a semantic theory ought to take.\n",
