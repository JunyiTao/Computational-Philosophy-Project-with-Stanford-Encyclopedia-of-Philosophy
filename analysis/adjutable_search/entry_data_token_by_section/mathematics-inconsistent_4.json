    "main_text": "Geometrical Inconsistency\n5. Chunk and Permeate\n\nRecently, an alternative technique for dealing generally with\ncontradictions has emerged. Brown and Priest (2004) have proposed a\ntechnique they call \u201cChunk and Permeate\u201d, in which\nreasoning from inconsistent premisses proceeds by separating the\nassumptions into consistent theories (chunks), deriving appropriate\nconsequences, then passing (permeating) those consequences to a\ndifferent chunk for further consequences to be derived. They suggest\nthat Newton\u2019s original reasoning in taking derivates in the\ncalculus, was of this form. This is an interesting and novel approach,\nthough it must meet the objection that to believe a conclusion\nobtained on this basis, one should believe all the premisses equally;\nand so an argument of the more common form, appealing to all the\npremisses without fragmenting them, should be eventually forthcoming.\nThe objection is thus that Chunk and Permeate is part of the context\nof discovery rather than the context of justification.\n\nLater, Benham et. al. (2014) have extended these methods to\nthe Dirac delta function. This broadens the class of applications, and\nso strengthens the technique. However, it also becomes clear there,\nthat there is a close parallel between (one large class of) Chunk and\nPermeate applications, and (consistent) non-standard analysis:\nwherever Chunk and Permeate takes a derivative by shifting chunks to\none where infinitesimals are zero, non-standard analysis takes a\nderivative by defining derivatives to be \u201cstandard parts\nonly\u201d. Of course, equivalence between these two techniques does\nnot show which is explanatorily deeper. Developments are to be awaited\nwith interest.\n6. Conclusion \n\nTo conclude: there has been appearing lately quite a bit of\nphilosophical material, that is sympathetic to the cause of\ninconsistent mathematics. Colyvan (2000) addresses the issue that\ninconsistent mathematical theories imply inconsistent mathematical\nobjects as their subject-matters. He also takes up the important task\nof providing an account of how inconsistent mathematics can have a\nbranch which is applied mathematics. Priest (2013), like\nColyvan, notes that inconsistent mathematics adds to the platonist\nmix. Berto (2007) usefully surveys paradoxes and foundational issues,\nand sets out some of the arithmetical results that bear on important\nphilosophical issues like the Incompleteness Theorems. Van Bendegem\n(2014) pursues the interesting motivation that change is always a\nstate of anomaly, so that always changing implies always anomalous.\nExamples include infinitesimals, complex numbers and infinity. Caution\nshould be adopted over thinking that inconsistency is always\nanomalous, however, if only because it is simply more material for\nmathematical study.\n\nIt should be emphasised again that these structures do not in any way\nchallenge or repudiate existing mathematics, but rather extend our\nconception of what is mathematically possible. This, in turn, sharpens\nthe issue of Mathematical Pluralism; see e.g., Davies (2005), Hellman\nand Bell (2006), or Priest (2013). Various authors have different\nversions of mathematical pluralism, but it is something along the\nlines that incompatible mathematical theories can be equally true. The\ncase for mathematical pluralism rests on the observation that there\nare different mathematical \u201cuniverses\u201d in which different,\nindeed incompatible, mathematical theorems or laws hold. Well-known\nexamples are the incompatibility between classical mathematics and\nintuitionist mathematics, and the incompatibility between ZF-like\nuniverses of sets respectively with, and without, the Axiom of Choice.\nIt seems absurd to say that ZF with Choice is true mathematics and ZF\nwithout Choice is false mathematics, if they are both legitimate\nexamples of mathematically well-behaved theories.\n\nThe primary question for the philosophy of mathematics is surely\nwhat is mathematics. Duality operations like topological\nduality or Routley* reinforce the point that incomplete/inconsistent\nduals are equally reasonable as examples of mathematics. From this\npoint of view, disputes about which of intuitionist or classical or\ninconsistent mathematics to accept seem pointless; they are all part\nof the subject matter of mathematics. This point is made effectively\nby Shapiro (2014, in contrast see his 2002). Shapiro\u2019s\ndistinctive position has other ingredients: mathematics as the science\nof structure, and mathematical pluralism implying logical pluralism\n(on logical pluralism see also Beall and Restall 2006); but we do not\ntake these up here.\n\nFor what it is worth, the present writer thinks that some version of\nmathematical pluralism is obviously true, if one takes mathematics to\nbe firstly about mathematical theories allowing for inconsistency ,\nand only secondly about the objects internal to those theories. There\nis, of course, no problem about incompatible theories co-existing, if\nconsidered as structures of propositions. The primacy of theories\nfits, too, with the natural observation that the epistemology of\nmathematics is deductive proof. It is only if one takes as a starting\npoint the primacy of the mathematical object as the truth-maker of\ntheories, that one has to worry about how their objects manage to\nco-exist.\n",
