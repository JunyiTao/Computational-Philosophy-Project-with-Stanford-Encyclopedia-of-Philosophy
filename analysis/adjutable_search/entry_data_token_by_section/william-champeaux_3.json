But they accept that an\nargument:\n\n  (1) Premise 1; Premise 2; therefore, Conclusion\n\n\n\nand its corresponding conditional:\n\n\n(2) If (Premise 1 and Premise 2) then Conclusion\n\n\nare equivalent by the deduction theorem. (2) in turn is interderivable\nwith:\n\n (3) If Premise 1 then (if Premise 2 then Conclusion)\n\n\nThese logical relationships were all in dispute during the twelfth\ncentury. (Iwakuma 2004b presents these distinctions and discusses\nWilliam's role in the debate.) Logicians at that time attributed much\nmore significance to the distinction between arguments and\nconditionals, and most did not accept what we would now recognize as\nthe formal rules of material implication. Along these lines, several\nviews were attributed to William as characteristic of his logical\nprogram, but his arguments in the available texts do not reflect what\nothers say about him. So, once again, the extent of William's\ninfluence is unclear.\n\n\nWilliam accepted that (1) and (2) are equivalent, but not for any\nmetalogical reason. He thought that syllogisms were phrases\n(orationes) that contain the senses of several other\nsentences. The view attributed to William is that syllogisms and\narguments are, as he puts it \"subcontinuatives\"\n[subcontinuativa] containing other sentences. \u2018Socrates\nis a man; therefore, Socrates is an animal\u2019 contains the sense\nof the sentences \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019, \u2018Socrates is\nan animal\u2019 and, \u2018If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is an\nanimal\u2019 (B9 2.1 ed. Iwakuma 2004b: 102; this is the same text as\nGreen-Pedersen 1974, frag 2). William calls the contained sentences\n\u2018continuatives [continuativa]\u2019. He also treats\nall syllogisms as conditionals of type (2) rather than type (3). There\nis no argument for his preference, at least not in the Introductions,\nand none of the available sources give his reasons.  At present all\nthat can be said is that William seems to have had a hand in the\norigins of a debate that raged during the twelfth century and was not\nrevived until the twentieth.\n\n\nWilliam introduces several novelties in his discussion of loci. Most\nsignificantly, he limits his discussion of the traditional Boethian\ntopics to the loci from the whole, part, opposites, equals, and\nimmediates. He also introduces loci from the subject and from the\npredicate into his discussion of categorical arguments. Both moves\nwere controversial.\n\n\nWilliam sometimes refers to the locus as \u2018the medium\u2019, by which\nhe does not necessarily mean the middle term but rather the thing that\nacts as a link between the extremes of an argument. He also called the\nlocus \u2018the argument\u2019, by which he means that the locus provides\nthe argumentative or inferential force. But whichever name he chooses,\nWilliam's realist commitment is evident.\nThe same thing is the argument and the locus according to\nMaster W. but the locus is the force of the argument [sedes\nargumenti], and so this thing is the force of the\nargument. (Green-Pedersen 1974: frag 1)\n\n\nIn the Introductions, William calls loci \"words\" [voces], but\nthey are words denoting the things themselves or their relations\n(habitudines) (IGP I 7).  But William is not clear about the\nimportance of this distinction between things and relations. Fragments\nof his later work report that he was quite careful to distinguish his\nview from any brand of vocalism. He distinguished the word\n(vox), the understanding or meaning of the word\n(intellectus), and the thing itself denoted by the word, and\nheld that the thing itself is the locus. (Green-Pedersen 1974: frag\n3,4)\n\n\nIn categorical syllogisms, William introduces the locus from subject,\npredicate, both subject and predicate, and from the whole (ISW II 2.2;\nIGP I 8ff; see Stump 1989: 117ff). Thus, the argument\n\nAll men are animals\nNo animal is a stone\nTherefore, no man is a stone\n \n\n\nis warranted by the locus from the predicate. The predicate of the\nfirst sentence is the link or medium between the extreme terms in the\nconclusion. In this case, animal (presumably the universal\nthing itself) is the locus or seat of the argument. The rule is, if\nsomething is predicated of some subject universally, then whatever is\nremoved universally from the predicate is removed universally from the\nsubject (William provides a lengthy set of rules describing the\nlogical relations that hold between subjects and predicates). As\ndescribed above, William holds that such maximal propositions contain\nthe sense of those propositions that fall under them. The rule\ncontains sentences signifying the relations between man and animal and\nbetween animal and stone (IGP I 8.4). The relations of animal\nto the extremes warrant the inference.\n\n\nWilliam provides a similar account of hypothetical syllogisms. He\nintroduces several loci and rules, but these are not formal\nrules. What ultimately warrants any hypothetical syllogism is the same\nsort of derivative signification of an extra-mental thing or\nrelation. Provided Socrates is risible, \u2018Socrates is a\nman\u2019 is true. The following hypothetical syllogism is warranted\nby the locus from the consequent:\n\n (Socrates is a man \u2192 Socrates is an animal) \u2192 (Socrates is\nrisible \u2192 Socrates is an animal)\n\n\nThe rule is: whatever follows from the consequent follows from the\nantecedent. In this case, the consequent is \u2018Socrates is a\nman\u2019, and the antecedent is \u2018Socrates is\nrisible\u2019. This looks like a formal rule:\n\n (A\u2192B)\u2192((B\u2192C)\u2192(A\u2192C))\n\n\n but William does not present it as such. \u2018Socrates is risible\n\u2192 Socrates is a man\u2019 is warranted by the locus from equals,\nand \u2018Socrates is man \u2192 Socrates is an animal\u2019 is\nwarranted by the locus from the part (IGP I 9.2). The conclusion,\n\u2018Socrates is risible \u2192 Socrates is an animal\u2019, is\narrived at via topical reasoning, not by formal rules of\ninference. This is the basis for much of the later criticism of his\nwork. Abelard in particular derives contradictions from his views by\ntreating William's loci as formal rules of inference (see Martin\n2004).\n",
