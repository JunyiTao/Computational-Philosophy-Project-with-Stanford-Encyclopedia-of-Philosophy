    "main_text": "Interdisciplinary Approaches\n2. Interdisciplinary Approaches\n\nThis section explores interdisciplinary approaches to critical\ndisability theory, along with the areas where there are overlaps and\ntensions. It describes the intersection of critical disability theory\nwith queer theory and critical race studies, as well as encounters\nwith indigenous thought. Crip theory, dis/ability critical race\nstudies and black disability studies, and indigenous theory and\npostcolonial theory, are all discussed. This section aims to be highly\ninclusive yet is at the same time limited by the fact that this\nliterature is developing.\n",
