    "main_text": "Range of issues || Who may punish?\n4.2 Who may punish?\n\nAssuming that wrongdoers deserve to be punished, who has a right to\ninflict the punishment? Who, in other words, are the appropriate\ndesert agents? One might start, as Hobbes and Locke did, with the view\nthat in the state of nature, the victim has the right to punish, and\nthat the reasons for creating a state include reasons for potential\nvictims to transfer that right to the state (Hobbes 1651: chs. 14\n& 18; Locke 1690: ch. 9).\n\nOne worry about this sort of view is that it could license vigilante\npunishment. Social contract theorists can handle that by emphasizing\nthat people not only delegate but transfer their right to\npunish, retaining only a vestigial right to punish in the case of\nminor punishments, such as would be doled out outside the criminal\njustice system, or if the state fails or is unable to act.\nCommunitarians like Antony Duff (2011: 6), however, object to even a\nvestigial right to vigilante punishment. Duff sees the state, which\nspeaks on behalf of the whole community, as the only proper punisher,\nat least in the context of crimes (For an even stronger position along\nthese lines, see Hegel 1821: \u00a7102).\n\nOthers take a different view about vigilantes, namely that\nanyone is pro tanto entitled to punish a wrongdoer.\nSome forfeiture theorists hold that restrictions on the right to\npunish someone who has forfeited her right not to be punished arise\nonly as a matter of political morality (Wellman 2017: 30\u201331). It\nis hard to see why a desert theorist could not take the same position.\nIndeed, some retributivists think that what vigilantes do should at\nleast count against the total punishment someone is due (Husak 1990:\n441\u2013442; but see Kolber 2013 (discussed in section 3 of the supplementary document Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality)\n for a challenge to the logical implication that vigilantes\n\u201cpunish\u201d).\n\nEven if the state normally has an exclusive right to punish criminal\nwrongdoing, questions arise whether it is permitted to punish if it\nsustains or fails to address important social injustices (from\ndistributive injustice to the denial of civil and political rights to\nsocially disempowered groups). (For an overview of the literature on\nthis, see Ewing 2018).\n\nFinally, can the wrongdoer herself be her own punitive desert agent?\nCan she repent and voluntarily take on hardships, and thereby preempt\nothers' right to punish her? Duff has argued that she cannot unless\nshe has also suffered public criticism and social ostracism\u2014and\neven then, such informal punishment should be discouraged as a\nsubstitute for formal punishment (Duff 2001: 118\u2013120).\n",
