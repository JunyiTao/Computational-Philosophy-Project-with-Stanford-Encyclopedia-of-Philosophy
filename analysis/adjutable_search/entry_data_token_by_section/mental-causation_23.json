Suppose that\nour mental representations are physical structures in the brain. Now\nsuppose with the externalist that the content of these representations\nis determined, not just by our intrinsic features, but by context as\nwell. Lilian (or Lilian\u2019s brain) represents a tree in the quad\nby going into state T. But T represents a tree in\nthe quad, not by virtue of T\u2019s (or, for that matter,\nLilian\u2019s) intrinsic makeup, but by virtue of T\u2019s\n(and by extension Lilian\u2019s) standing in the right kind of\nrelation to the tree. The very same kind of state in a different\ncontext (in the brain of someone in different circumstances) might\nrepresent something very different\u2014or nothing at all.\n\nNow if the content of Lilian\u2019s thought that there is a tree in\nthe quad is \u201cbroad\u201d, if the significance of her thought\ndepends on factors outside Lilian\u2019s body, then it is indeed hard\nto see how this content could figure in a causal account of her\nactions, including Lilian\u2019s expressing her belief that there is\na tree in the quad by uttering the sentence, \u201cThere is a tree in\nthe quad\u201d. This is bad news for any attempt to explain why we do\nwhat we do by reference to the contents of our thoughts.\n\nConsider an analogy (Dretske 1998). Gus inserts a quarter into a\nvending machine. The coin has a range of intrinsic qualities common to\nquarters, but its being a quarter does not depend solely on these\nintrinsic qualities: a quarter\u2019s intrinsic qualities would be\nshared by a decent counterfeit. The coin\u2019s being a quarter\ndepends on its having the right sort of history: it was produced in a\nUnited States mint. This is something the vending machine cares\nnothing about. The machine reacts only to the coin\u2019s intrinsic\nfeatures. You might put this by saying that the coin affects the\nmachine, not qua quarter, but only qua possessor of\na particular kind of intrinsic makeup. (Vending machines are built to\ntake advantage of the contingent fact that objects with this intrinsic\nmakeup are almost always quarters.)\n\nThe worry is that we apparently operate, in important respects, as\nvending machines do. We respond to incoming stimuli solely in virtue\nof our intrinsic makeup and the intrinsic character of the stimuli.\nBut if our thoughts possess their content in virtue of our standing in\ncomplicated environmental\u2013social\u2013historical relations to\nour surroundings, it is hard to see how such contents could make a\ncausal difference in our psychological economy, how they could figure\nin the production of behavior. Thoughts have contents, but\nthese contents could have no direct influence on the operation of\nmental mechanisms (Stich 1978; Kim 1982; Fodor 1980, 1987, ch. 2,\n1991; Jackson and Pettit 1988).\n",
