    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || International Law\n8.5 International Law\n\nThe Rule of Law applies not only within national polities but also\nincreasingly between them, but in this arena its use remains\nunder-theorized (for a helpful discussion, see Crawford 2003). Much of\nthe work that has been done on the international Rule of Law simply\nadopts uncritically the perspective of those who say, at the national\nlevel, that the Rule of Law requires determinacy, clarity, and\npredictability (see Chesterman 2008). But this may be misconceived\nwhen we are talking about states rather than individuals as the\nsubjects of law (Waldron 2011b). States are in a much better position to be informed of\nwhat their legal requirements are than individual men and women in\nsociety, since they are parties to the treaties and practices that\nestablish international law. (Maybe, though, this point does not hold\nto the same extent when we consider the murky depths of customary\ninternational law.)\n\nAnyway, the liberty of an individual state is not such an important\nvalue as the liberty of an individual person. It is not clear that\nnational states need protection from international law and the power\nthat it represents in the way that ordinary men and women need\nprotection from the exercise of political power in society. Moreover,\nin areas like international human rights law, any presumption based on\nthe Rule of Law in favor of the liberty of national states will tend\nto have detrimental effects on the liberty or well-being of individual\nmen and women. We have to be careful therefore that invocation of the\nRule of Law in the international realm does not undermine the values\nthat are supposed to be secured by this ideal within national\npolities.\n\nOne additional point. It remains controversial whether international\ninstitutions themselves\u2014like the United Nations and its\nagencies\u2014should be bound by the Rule of Law. This odd because\nthese agencies are among the most vociferous advocates of the Rule of\nLaw so far as its application to national states is concerned. The\nreluctance here stems in large part from an estimation of the\nimportance of diplomatic immunity. UN officials worry that if they and\ntheir agencies are held legally liable for malfeasances of various\nkinds associated with peace-keeping activities, there is a danger that\nthe whole basis of international action might unravel. The danger is\nprobably exaggerated, however, and those who make this argument would\nnot for a moment countenance a similar argument in the sphere of\nnational states.\n",
