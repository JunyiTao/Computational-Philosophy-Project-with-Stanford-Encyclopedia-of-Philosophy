    "main_text": "The Kairetic Account of Explanation\n2. The Kairetic Account of Explanation\n\nThis account is developed by Michael Strevens in his Depth\n(2008) and in a number of papers (2004, 2013, 2018). Strevens\ndescribes his theory as a \u201ctwo factor\u201d account (Strevens\n2008: 4). The first factor \u2013 Strevens\u2019 starting point\n\u2013 is the notion of causation or dependence (Strevens calls it\n\u201ccausal influence\u201d) that figures in fundamental physics.\nStrevens is ecumenical about what this involves. He holds that a\nnumber of different philosophical treatments of causal influence\n\u2013 conserved quantity, counterfactual or interventionist \u2013\nwill fit his purposes. This notion of causal influence is then used as\ninput to an account of causal explanation \u2013\nStrevens\u2019 second factor. A causal explanation of an individual\nevent e (Strevens\u2019 starting point) assembles all and\nonly those causal influences that make a difference to (are\nexplanatorily relevant to) e. A key idea here is the notion of\ncausal entailment (Strevens 2008:\n 74).[3]\n A set of premises that causally entail that e occurs\ndeductively entail this claim and do this in a way that\n\u201cmirrors\u201d the causal influences (ascertained from the\nfirst stage) leading to e. This notion of mirroring is\nlargely left at an intuitive level but as an illustration a derivation\nof an effect from premises describing the cause mirrors the causal\ninfluences leading to the effect while the reverse derivation from\neffect to cause does not. However, more than mirroring is required for\ncausal explanation: The premises in a causal entailment of the sort\njust described are subjected to a process (a kind of\n\u201cabstraction\u201d) in which premises that are not necessary\nfor the entailment of e are removed or replaced with weaker\nalternatives that are still sufficient to entail e \u2013\nthe result of this being to identify factors which are genuinely\ndifference-makers or explanatorily relevant to e. The result\nis what Strevens calls a \u201cstand-alone\u201d explanation for\ne (Strevens 2008: 70). (Explanatory relevance or\ndifference-making is thus understood in terms of what, so to speak, is\nminimally required for causal entailment, constrained by a\ncohesiveness requirement described below, rather than, as in some\nother models of explanation, in terms of counterfactuals or\nstatistical relevance.) As an illustration, if the event e is\nthe shattering of a window the causal influences on e,\nidentified from fundamental physics, will be extremely detailed and\nwill consist of influences that affect fine grained features of\ne\u2019s occurrence, having to do, e.g., with exactly how\nthe window shatters. But to the extent that the explanandum is just\nwhether e occurs most of those details will be irrelevant in\nthe sense that they will affect only the details of how the shattering\noccurs and not whether it occurs at all. Dropping these details will\nresult in a derivation that still causally entails e. The causal\nexplanation of e is what remains after all such details have\nbeen dropped and only what is necessary for the causal entailment of\ne is retained.\n\nAs Strevens is fully aware, this account faces the following apparent\ndifficulty. There are a number of different causal scenarios that\nrealize causes of bottle shatterings \u2013 the impact of rocks but\nalso, say, sonic booms (cf. Hall 2012). In Strevens\u2019 view, we\nshould not countenance causal explanations that disjoin causal models\nthat describe such highly different realizers, even though weakening\nderivations via the inclusion of such disjunctions may preserve causal\nentailment. Strevens\u2019 solution appeals to the notion of\ncohesion; when different processes serve as\n\u201crealizers\u201d for the causes of e, these must be\n\u201ccohesive\u201d in the sense that they are \u201ccausally\ncontiguous\u201d from the point of view of the underlying physics.\nRoughly, contiguous causal processes are those that are nearby or\nneighbors to one another in a space provided by fundamental\n physics.[4]\n Sonic booms and rock impacts do not satisfy this cohesiveness\nrequirement and hence models involving them as disjunctive premises\nare excluded. Fundamental physics is thus the arbitrator of whether\nupper-level properties with different realizers are sufficiently\nsimilar to satisfy the cohesion requirement. Or at least this is so\nfor deep \u201cstand alone\u201d explanations in contrast to those\nexplanations that are \u201cframework\u201d dependent (see\nbelow).\n\nAs Strevens sees it, a virtue of his account is that it separates\ndifficult (\u201cmetaphysical\u201d) questions about the nature of\nthe causal relationships (at least as these are found in physics which\nis Strevens\u2019 starting point) from issues about causal\nexplanation, which are the main focus of the kairetic account. It also\nfollows that most of the causal claims that we consider in common\nsense and in science (outside of fundamental physics) are in fact\nclaims about causal explanation and explanatory relevance as\ndetermined by the kairetic abstraction procedure rather than claims\nabout causation per se. In effect when one claims that \u201caspirin\ncauses headache relief\u201d one is making a rather complicated\ncausal explanatory claim about the upshot of the application of the\nabstraction procedure to the causal claims that, properly speaking,\nare provided by physics. This contrasts with an account in which\ncausal claims outside of physics are largely univocal with causal\nclaims (assuming that there are such) within physics.\n\nWe noted above that Strevens imposes a cohesiveness requirement on his\nabstraction procedure. This seems to have the consequence that\nupper-level causal generalizations that have realizers that are rather\ndisparate from the point of view of the underlying physics are\ndefective qua explainers, even though there are many examples\nof such generalizations that (rightly or wrongly) are regarded as\nexplanatory. Strevens addresses this difficulty by introducing the\nnotion of a framework \u2013 roughly a set of\npresuppositions for an explanation. When scientists\n\u201cframework\u201d some aspect of a causal story, they put that\naspect aside (it is presupposed rather an explicit part of the\nexplanation) and focus on getting the story right for the part that\nremains. A common example is to framework details of implementation,\nin effect black-boxing the low-level causal explanation of why certain\nparts of a system behave in the way they do. The resulting explanation\nsimply presupposes that these parts do what they do, without\nattempting to explain why. Consequently, the black boxes in such\nexplanations are not subject to the cohesion requirement, because they\nare not the locus of explanatory attention . Thus although\nexplanations appealing to premises with disparate realizers are\ndefective when considered by themselves as stand-alone explanations,\nwe may regard such explanations as dependent on a framework with the\nframework incorporating information about a presupposed mechanism that\nsatisfies the coherence\n constraint.[5]\n When this is the case, the explanation will be acceptable\nqua frameworked explanation. Nonetheless in such cases the\nexplanation should in principle be deepened by making explicit the\ninformation presupposed in the framework.\n\nStrevens describes his account as \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather\nthan \u201cnormative\u201d in aspiration. Presumably, however, it is\nnot intended as a description of the bases on which lay people or\nscientists come to accept causal explanations outside of fundamental\nphysics \u2013 people don\u2019t actually go through the abstraction\nfrom fundamental physics process that Strevens describes when they\narrive at or reason about upper-level causal explanations. Instead, as\nwe understand his account, it is intended to characterize something\nlike what must be the case from the point of view of fundamental\nphysics for upper-level causal judgments to be explanatory \u2013 the\nexplanatory upper-level claims must fit with physics in the right way\nas specified in Strevens\u2019 abstraction procedure and the\naccompanying cohesiveness\n constraint.[6]\n Perhaps then the account is intended to be descriptive in the sense\nthat the upper-level causal explanations people regard as satisfactory\ndo in fact satisfy the constraints he describes. In addition, the\naccount is intended to be descriptive in the sense that it contends\nthat as a matter of empirical fact people regard their explanations as\ncommitted to various claims about the underlying physics even if these\nclaims are presently unknown \u2013 e.g., to claims about the\ncohesiveness of these\n realizers.[7]\n At the same time the kairetic account is also normative in the sense\nthat it judges that explanations that fail to satisfy the constraints\nof the abstraction procedure are in some way unsatisfactory \u2013\nthus people are correct to have the commitments described above.\n\nDepth also contains an interesting treatment of the role of\nidealizations in explanation. It is often thought that idealizations\ninvolve the presence of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d, or\n\u201cdistortions\u201d. Strevens claims that these\n\u201cfalse\u201d features involve claims that do not have to do\nwith difference-makers, in the sense captured by the abstraction\nprocedure. Thus, according to the kairetic model, it does not matter\nif idealizations involve falsehoods or if they omit certain\ninformation since the falsehoods or omitted information do not concern\ndifference-makers \u2013 their presence thus does not detract from\nthe resulting explanation. Moreover, we can think of idealizations as\nconveying useful information about which factors are not\ndifference-makers.\n\nThe kairetic account covers a great deal more that we lack the space\nto discuss including treatments of what Strevens calls\n\u201centanglement\u201d, equilibrium explanations, statistical\nexplanation and much else.\n\nAs is always the case with ambitious theories in philosophy, there\nhave been a number of criticisms of the kairetic model. Here we\nmention just two. First, the kairetic model assumes that all\nlegitimate explanation is causal or at least that all explanation must\nin some way reference or connect with causal information. (A good deal\nof the discussion in Depth is concerned to show that\nexplanations that might seem to be non-causal can nonetheless be\nregarded as working by conveying causal information.) This claim that\nall explanation is causal is by no means an implausible idea \u2013\nuntil recently it was widely assumed in the literature on explanation\n(Skow 2014). Nonetheless this idea has recently been challenged by a\nnumber of philosophers (Baker 2005; Batterman 2000, 2002, 2010a; Lange\n2013, 2016; Lyon 2012; Pincock 2007). Relatedly, the kairetic account\nassumes that fundamental physics is \u201ccausal\u201d \u2013\nphysics describes causal relations, and indeed lots of causal\nrelations, enough to generate a large range of upper-level causal\nexplanations when the abstraction procedure is applied. Some hold\ninstead that the dependence relations described in physics are either\nnot causal at all (causation being a notion that applies only to\nupper-level or macroscopic relationships) or else that these\ndependence relations lack certain important features (such as\nasymmetry) that are apparently present in causal explanatory claims\noutside of physics (Ney 2009, 2016). These claims about the absence of\ncausation in physics are controversial but if correct, it follows that\nphysics does not provide the input that Strevens\u2019 account\n needs.[8]\n\nA second set of issues concern the kairetic abstraction process. Here\nthere are several worries. First, the constraints on this process have\nstruck some as vague since they involve judgments of cohesiveness of\nrealizers from the point of view of underlying physics. Does physics\nor any other science really provide a principled, objective basis for\nsuch judgments? Second, it seems, as suggested above, that upper-level\ncausal explanations often generalize over realizers that are very\ndisparate from the point of view of the underlying physics. Potochnik\n(2011, 2017) focuses on the example, also discussed by Strevens, of\nthe Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations which are applied to a large variety\nof different organisms that stand in predator/prey relations. Strevens\nuses his ideas about frameworks to argue that use of the LV equations\nis in some sense justifiable, but it also appears to be a consequence\nof his account (and Strevens seems to agree) that explanations\nappealing to the LV equations are not very deep, considered as\nstandalone explanations. But, at least as a descriptive matter,\nPotochnik claims, this does not seem to correspond to the judgments or\npractices of the scientists using these equations, who seem happy to\nuse the LV equations despite the fact that they fail to satisfy the\ncausal contiguity requirement. Potochnik thus challenges this portion\nof the descriptive adequacy of Strevens\u2019 account. Of course, one\nmight respond that these scientists ought to judge in accord\nwith Strevens\u2019 account, but as noted above, this involves taking\nthe account to have normative implications and not as merely\ndescriptive.\n\nA more general form of this issue arises in connection with\n\u201cuniversal\u201d behavior (Batterman 2002). There are a number\nof cases in which physical and biological systems that are very\ndifferent from one another in terms of their low-level realizers\nexhibit similar or identical upper-level behavior (Batterman 2002;\nBatterman & Rice 2014; Ross 2015). As a well-known example,\nsubstances as diverse as ferromagnets and various liquid/gas systems\nexhibit similar behavior around their critical points (Batterman 2000,\n2002). Renormalization techniques are often thought to explain this\ncommonality in behavior, but they do so precisely by showing that the\nphysical details of these systems do not matter for (are irrelevant\nto) the aspects of their upper-level behavior of interest. The\nfeatures of these systems that are relevant to their behavior have to\ndo with their dimensionality and symmetry properties among others and\nthis is revealed by the renormalization group analysis (RGA)\n(Batterman 2010b). One interesting question is whether we can think of\nthat analysis as an instance of Strevens\u2019 kairetic procedure. On\nthe one hand the RGA can certainly be viewed as an abstraction\nprocedure that discards non-difference-making factors. On the other\nhand, it is perhaps not so clear the RGA respects the cohesiveness\nrequirements that Strevens proposes since the upshot is that systems\nthat are very different at the level of fundamental physics are given\na common explanation. That is, the RGA does not seem to work by\nshowing (at least in any obvious way) that the systems to which it\napplies are contiguous with respect to the underlying\n physics.[9]\n\nAnother related issue is this: a number of philosophers claim that the\nRGA provides a non-causal explanation (Batterman 2002, 2010a;\nReutlinger 2014). As we have seen, Strevens denies that there are\nnon-causal explanations in his extended sense of \u201ccausal\u201d\nbut, in addition, if it is thought the RGA implements Strevens\u2019\nabstraction procedure, this raises the question of whether (contrary\nto Strevens\u2019 expectations) this procedure can take causal\ninformation as input and yield a non-causal explanation as output. A\ncontrary view, which may be Strevens\u2019, is that as long as the\nexplanation is the result of applying the kairetic procedure to causal\ninput, that result must be causal.\n\nThe issue that we have been addressing so far has to do with whether\ncausal contiguity is a defensible requirement to impose on upper-level\nexplanations. There is also a related question \u2013 assuming that\nthe requirement is defensible, how can we tell whether it is\nsatisfied? The contiguity requirement as well as the whole abstraction\nprocedure with which it is associated is characterized with reference\nto fundamental physics but, as we have noted, users of upper-level\nexplanations usually have little or no knowledge of how to connect\nthese with the underlying physics. If Strevens\u2019 model is to be\napplicable to the assessment of upper-level explanations it must be\npossible to tell, from the vantage point of those explanations and the\navailable information that surrounds their use, whether they satisfy\nthe contiguity and other requirements but without knowing in detail\nhow they connect to the underlying physics. Strevens clearly thinks\nthis is possible (as he should, given his views) and in some cases\nthis seems plausible. For example, it seems fairly plausible, as we\ntake Strevens to assume, that predator/prey pairs consisting of lions\nand zebras are disparate from pairs consisting of spiders and house\nflies from the point of view of the underlying physics and thus\nconstitute heterogeneous realizers of the LV\n equations.[10]\n On the other hand, in a case of pre-emption in which Billy\u2019s\nrock shatters a bottle very shortly before Suzy\u2019s rock arrives\nat the same space, Strevens seems committed to the claim that these\ntwo causal processes are non-contiguous \u2013 indeed he needs this\nresult to avoid counting Suzy\u2019s throw as a cause of the\n shattering[11]\n (Non-contiguity must hold even if the throws involve rocks with the\nsame mass and velocity following very similar trajectories, differing\nonly slightly in their timing.) In other examples, Strevens claims\nthat airfoils of different flexibility and different materials satisfy\nthe contiguity constraint, as do different molecular scattering\nprocesses in gases \u2013 apparently this is so even if the latter\nare governed by rather different potential functions (as they\nsometimes are) (Strevens 2008: 165\u20136). The issue here is not\nthat these judgments are obviously wrong but rather that one would\nlike to have a more systematic and principled story about the basis on\nwhich they are to be made.\n\nThat said, we think that Strevens has put his finger on an important\nissue that deserves more philosophical attention. This is that there\nis something explanatorily puzzling or incomplete about a stable\nupper-level generalization that appears to have very disparate\nrealizers: one naturally wants a further explanation of how this comes\nabout \u2013 one that does not leave it as a kind of unexplained\ncoincidence that this uniformity of behavior\n occurs.[12]\n The RGA purports to do this for certain aspects of behavior around\ncritical points and it does not seem unreasonable to hope for accounts\n(perhaps involving some apparatus very different from the RGA) for\nother cases. What is less clear is whether such an explanation will\nalways appeal to causal contiguity at the level of fundamental physics\n\u2013 for example in the case of the RGA the relevant factors (and\nwhere causal contiguity appears to obtain) are relatively abstract and\nhigh-level, although certainly \u201cphysical\u201d.\n",
