Mill\u2019s License to Hope\n\nThe posthumous publication of Mill\u2019s Three Essays on\nReligion (1874) drew criticism from the faithful, but it also\ndrew a surprising disappointment from those who expected the\n\u201csaint of rationalism\u201d to argue for agnosticism. The cause\nof this consternation is found in the third of the three essays,\n\u201cTheism,\u201d a short work begun in 1868 and unfinished when\nMill died in 1870. The faithful found \u201cTheism\u201d\nobjectionable because of Mill\u2019s criticism of several of the\nstandard arguments of natural theology. The disappointment of the\nother side flowed from Mill\u2019s endorsement of a position that can\nbe summed up by the principle that where probabilities fail, hope can\nproperly flourish. As Mill expressed this principle when discussing\nimmortality, \u201c\u2026to any one who feels it conducive either\nto his satisfaction or to his usefulness to hope for a future state as\na possibility, there is no hindrance to his indulging that hope\u201d\n(Mill 1874, 210). Mill thought that belief in a creator of great but\nlimited power was supported by the design argument, and one could\ncertainly erect the superstructure of hope upon the base of a belief\nin a creator who would extend human existence beyond the grave:\n\nAppearances point to the existence of a Being who has great power over\nus \u2013 all the power implied in the creation of the Kosmos, or of\nits organized beings at least \u2013 and of whose goodness we have\nevidence though not of its being his predominant attribute; and as we\ndo not know the limits either of his power or of his goodness, there\nis room to hope that both the one and the other may extend to granting\nus this gift provided that it would really be beneficial to us. (Mill\n1874, 210)\n\n\nSince we do not know that granting postmortem existence to humans is\nbeyond the capability of the creator, hope is possible. As Mill puts\nit:\n\n\u2026in the regulation of the imagination literal truth of facts is\nnot the only thing to be considered. Truth is the province of reason,\nand it is by the cultivation of the rational faculty that provision is\nmade for its being known always, and thought of as often as is\nrequired by duty and the circumstances of human life. But when reason\nis strongly cultivated, the imagination may safely follow its own end,\nand do its best to make life pleasant and lovely\u2026 On these\nprinciples it appears to me that the indulgence of hope with regard to\nthe government of the universe and the destiny of man after death,\nwhile we recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more\nthan a hope, is legitimate and philosophically defensible. The\nbeneficial effect of such a hope is far from trifling. (Mill 1874,\n248\u20139)\n\n\nFor our purposes the item of interest is Mill\u2019s claim that\n\u201cany one who feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to\nhis usefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility, there is\nno hindrance to his indulging that hope\u201d (Mill 1874, 210).\nMill\u2019s license to hope is issued on pragmatic grounds: it is\npermissible to hope if and only if:\n\nL1.\nFor all one knows or justifiably believes, the object of\none\u2019s hope obtains; and,\nL2.\nOne believes that hoping contributes to one\u2019s own happiness,\nor to the well-being of others.\n\n\nThe second condition (L2) is straightforwardly pragmatic and restricts\nhope to those who have goals either of personal happiness, or of\ncontributing to the well-being of others. Believing that hope will\nresult in the increase of happiness or well-being is a necessary\ncondition of permissible hope.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Mill agreed with Clifford\u2019s\nRule. Mill was no subjectivist or fideist. But hope and belief are not\nthe same; and the standards for the permissibility of the latter are\nconsiderably higher. Mill thought that (L1) and (L2) were the relevant\nstandards for permissible hope. If one believes that Clifford\u2019s\nRule should govern any and all propositional attitudes and not just\nbelief, then it is easy to see why Mill\u2019s liberal treatment of\nhope would disappoint.\n\nMill held that one may hope that God exists, but one may not believe\nthat God exists, as the evidence is lacking. Suppose one agrees with\nMill, that faith can subsist on hope, trust, or some other\nnon-doxastic attitude other than belief. Suppose further that one\nseeks to build a theistic commitment on hope. The acceptance of\ntheistic hope provides reason to act as if theism were true, not\nbecause one believes that it is true, but because one hopes that it\nis. What is it to act as if theism is true? It is to put into practice\nbehaviors characteristic of a particular religious tradition, such as\nJudaism, Christianity, or Islam. Acting as if a certain religious\ntradition were true would include reorienting one\u2019s values,\npriorities, and life-projects in order to reflect a commitment to a\nparticular tradition. It would also involve engaging in the rituals\nand behaviors associated with the particular tradition; and investing\na significant portion of one\u2019s time and money in support of\ncauses associated with the tradition.\n\nA problem arises however. Social psychology, with its theories of\nbiased scanning, social-perception theory, and cognitive dissonance\ntheory, advances the idea that behavior can alter, influence, and\ngenerate attitudes, including beliefs (see Jordan 2016). By regularly\nengaging in behaviors and practices characteristic of a particular\nreligious tradition, one engages in actions that tend to inculcate\nreligious belief. Belief is catching, as associating with and\nimitating the faithful is an effective way of self-inducing the\nbeliefs of the faithful. Those who seek to replace belief with hope\nwill find themselves taking steps to build a theistic commitment on\nhope, while holding that they ought to avoid theistic belief. Yet, the\nvery steps involved in fostering a commitment on hope \u2013\nimmersive role-playing as a theist, or acting as if theism were true\n\u2013 tend to generate theistic belief. Those who habitually or\nchronically imitate the actions and rituals of theists find eventually\nthat those are not just tasks they perform, but are at the heart of\nwho they are and what they believe. Yet, theistic belief is\noff-limits.\n\nOne would have to take steps that inoculate against the contagious\ntheistic belief. Yet, the reasons one has to build a theistic\ncommitment on hope and not belief, would conflict with one\u2019s\nreasons to inoculate against catching belief. One is pushed to act as\nif theism were true, yet pulled to act to ensure that one does not\ncome to believe that it is. Whatever commitment might emerge out of\nthis dynamic is not likely one characteristic of a mature or\nwholeheartedly committed theist.\n\nThis problem of catching belief flows out of the fact that chronically\nacting as if something is true is an effective way of inculcating the\nbelief that it is true. Any non-doxastic account of faith put into\nregular practice, coupled with Clifford\u2019s Rule, is exposed to\nthe problem of catching belief. Religious Fictionalism, for example,\nwhich holds that faith that p does not require belief that\np, has to deal with the problem.
