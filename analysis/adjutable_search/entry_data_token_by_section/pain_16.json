Evaluative and motivational theories\n\nAlthough a functionalist treatment of affective phenomenology seems\nproblematic for pure strong representationalists, it may be welcomed\nby perceptual theorists in general who are seeking to give a\nnaturalistic account of pain as a perception. All they need to do to\naccommodate pain\u2019s affective phenomenology is to say that\nfeeling pain involves perception although perception doesn\u2019t\nexhaust its nature: feeling pain is also an affective/emotional\nexperience that can be explained by invoking other factors, say, the\nfunctional role of pain\u2019s sensory/representational content (see,\nfor example, Lycan 1987a, pp. 60\u201361 and Clark 2006, Aydede &\nFulkerson 2019 for proposals roughly along this line) or the\nevaluative representation of what the sensory-discriminative component\nof pain represents (e.g., the badness of tissue damage) \u2014 see\nbelow. Including the affective phenomenology, as we may recall, is\nwhat the IASP definition of pain seems to recommend. It seems also\nembedded in the common-sense conception of pain: pains are\nunpleasant.\n\nIndeed a number of theorists embraced this sort of approach that may\nbe usefully called \u2018mixed theories of pain\u2019. These come in\na variety of forms, sometimes motivated by different sets of concerns,\nand accordingly, emphasizing different aspects of pain. But the basic\nidea is that the nature of pain is complex consisting of at least two\nmental elements. Generally one element is characterized by using one\nor more of the following group of terms: sensory, perceptual,\nrepresentational, discriminating, descriptive, or informational. The\nother is characterized by one or more of the following: affective,\nemotional, motivational, evaluative, directive, or imperative. So far\nwe have been focusing on those theories that have emphasized the\nformer aspect. Indeed this has been the overwhelmingly dominant style\nof theorizing \u2014 at least in the philosophical tradition. But in\nthe last 10 years or so, there has been an increasing recognition of\nthe fact that pain has an affective and motivational aspect which\nseems at least prima facie distinct from its sensory or perceptual\naspect (see next section for some scientific evidence). As observed,\nmost perceptual theorists and weak representationalists could, and as\na matter of historical fact, did accommodate the affective\naspect of pain to various degrees of success \u2014 mostly, by going\ncognitivist as described above. \n\nNevertheless, in recent years, a number of theorists have focused more\non the affective aspect of pain experiences rather than on their\nsensory/perceptual aspect, perhaps feeling that it is this aspect that\nmakes pain experiences and other similar bodily sensations unique and\ndistinctive. There are historical precedents to this kind of approach\n(e.g., Marshall 1892, 1894a, 1894b; Duncker 1941), but I will focus on\ncontemporary developments of the view. (Corns 2013 contains a\ncriticism of unitary views of pain, and recommends a multi-dimensional\nview. In this vein, see also Borg et al., forthcoming, for a polyeidic\nmodel of folk conception of pain.)\n\nA good example is Nelkin 1994. Nelkin calls his theory, the\n\u2018evaluative theory of pain\u2019, according to which pain\nconsists of two components, one of which is an occurrent phenomenal\nstate representing various troubles in body parts. The second\ncomponent is a simultaneous and non-inferential evaluation of this\nphenomenal state. Nelkin conceives of this evaluation as a form of\nspontaneous de re judgment about the phenomenal state as\nrepresenting harm to the body. He thinks that both elements are\nnecessary for pain experience. Surprisingly, however, Nelkin claims\nthat the evaluative component should not be equated with affect and\nmotivation involved in experiencing pain. According to Nelkin, these\ntwo are only contingently related to pain experiences. (A similar view\nis presented in Hall 1989.) \n\nAnother evaluative theory is offered by Helm (2002) who develops the\nview in a more integrated fashion. According to Helm, bodily pains and\npleasures are just felt evaluations, spontaneous evaluations of what\nis happening in one\u2019s body as good or bad. According to Helm,\nthese evaluations aren\u2019t judgments understood ordinarily.\nNevertheless, they have intentional contents rationally responsive to\na broader range of background conative and cognitive states of the\nexperiencer. Thus as felt evaluations they inherently motivate and\nrationalize behavior typically associated with pain and pleasure.\nTherefore, they are not a separate or separable component of pain.\nPains and pleasure just are felt evaluations. Helm\u2019s\naccount is nuanced in many ways as it depends on his theory of\nemotions (Helm 2001). \n\nPerhaps the two most prominent proponents of a mixed evaluative view\nof pain, in recent years, are Michael Tye (2006a,b, Cutter & Tye\n2011) and David Bain (2003, 2013, 2017). Both defend strong\nrepresentationalism for both the sensory and affective components of\npains. Bain labels the position evaluativism and states it\nsuccinctly: \n\n\nA subject\u2019s being in unpleasant pain consists in his (i)\nundergoing an experience (the pain) that represents a disturbance of a\ncertain sort, and (ii) that same experience additionally representing\nthe disturbance as bad for him in the bodily sense. (Bain, 2013:\nS82)\n\n\nTye (2006a,b) and Cutter & Tye (2011) take the badness of physical\ndisorder to be an evolutionarily significant objective property of the\ndisturbance (such as aptness to harm), whereas Bain seems\nnon-committal about what the badness might eventually come to (but see\nhis 2017). (For recent criticisms of evaluativism, see Aydede &\nFulkerson 2019; Jacobson 2013, 2018; see Cutter & Tye 2014 for a\nresponse to Jacobson 2013. Jacobson 2018 additionally develops an\nattitudinal first-order anti-damage desire account of pain\naffect.)\n\nHall (2008), Martinez (2011), and Klein (2007) offer accounts of pain\nthat belong to the class of motivational theories. They call\ntheir views \u2018imperative\u2019 theories (or,\nimperativism as the views have come to be known), according\nto which pains are experiences with purely intentional content:\naccording to Hall and Martinez, pains have mixed intentional contents\npartly consisting of descriptive content, and partly of imperative\ncontent. On these views, pain experiences both represent\nactual or potential damage in body parts and command certain\nactions involving those parts such as: \u201cStop! Stop doing what\nyou\u2019re doing with this bodily part\u201d (Hall 2008: 534), or\n<See to it that this bodily damage is no more!> (Martinez\n2011).\n\nKlein (2007, 2015) further develops this imperative account of pain in\na more radical way: he proposes that pain experiences are exhausted by\ntheir imperative content alone. He claims that they have no\ndescriptive (in his words, representational) content at all. He\nintends his account in the same metaphysical spirit in which strong\nrepresentationalists present their account: the difference being in\nthe kind of intentional content pains have. According to strong\nrepresentationalists (in Klein\u2019s terminology, intentionalists),\nthis content is purely descriptive. According to Klein, it is purely\nimperative: a proscription against acting with bodily parts where pain\nis felt. In his 2015, Klein takes this imperative content to be a\nprotective command issued by the body to the agent: <protect\nthat body part in this way!>. Klein offers his\nimperativism as an account of the essential nature of pains\nwhich he takes to consist only in pains\u2019 sensory-discriminative\ncomponent. The affective, unpleasantness, aspect is only contingently\nrelated to pains, according to Klein, and consists of second-order\nagential level commands directed at the pain\u2019s imperative\ncontent. (For criticisms, see Bain 2011, Aydede [2017, in Other\nInternet Resources].)\n\nGustafson (2006) develops an extended and multi-stage argument against\nunderstanding pain as a sensory experience. On his view, pains are\nessentially emotions. \n\nWhen the naturalistic underpinnings of these evaluative and\nmotivational theories are explored, functionalist or\npsychofunctionalist reductions of the affective/evaluative dimension\nof pain might turn out to be the most natural option for these\ntheorists. (For general critical reviews of the class of recent\nevaluative and motivational accounts of pain, and in particular the\naffective aspect of pains, see Corns 2018, and Aydede & Fulkerson\n2019, the latter develop a psychofunctionalist and a first-order\nexperiential anti-damage desire account of sensory affect, including\npain affect.)\n",
