    "main_text": "Ultimatum Games and Fairness\n1. Ultimatum Games and Fairness\nUltimatum games have the following setup. Call one person the\n\u201cofferer\u201d and the other the \u201cresponder\u201d, The\nofferer is informed that she can allocate a certain amount of a good.\nSuppose the good is money, such as $10, since that is the usual good\nchosen by experimenters in the literature. Next the offerer is\ninstructed to make some offer to the responder\u2014in our example,\nthe offer could range between $0 and $10, inclusive. So the offerer\ncan give away all the money, none of it, or something in-between. The\nonly other piece of information that the offerer knows, standardly, is\nthat the responder\u2019s reaction matters when he is presented with\nher offer. If the responder accepts the offer, then both parties keep\nwhatever the offer says (unless it is $0, in which case only one side\nkeeps any money). But if the responder rejects the offer, then neither\nside gets any money at all, and the game is done. Hence if the offer\nis to keep $8 and give $2, and the responder accepts this offer, then\nthat is in fact the amount of money with which each side walks\naway. But if the responder rejects the offer, then each side walks\naway with $0.\n A couple of observations are important here. First, it is not\nessential to the game that the offerer know anything about the\nresponder\u2014he or she could be a complete stranger. Second and, as\nwe will see, very importantly, it is not an essential feature of the\ngame that the responder know how much money the offerer has to work\nwith in the first place. So when the offer comes in at $2, the\nresponder might have no idea whether that is all the money that the\nofferer has to allocate, or whether it is just a small amount out of\n$100, $10,000, or even higher.  In many versions of the ultimatum\ngame, the responder is told what the offerer has\navailable. But the point to stress here is that this is an optional\nfeature of the game. Finally, it is worth noting that the power\ndynamic in this game favors the offerer. The responder cannot make any\ncounteroffers back in the hope of getting a bigger offer. He only has\nthe threat of veto power. But if he does veto the offer, then he comes\naway with nothing himself. That is not a great negotiating position to\nbe in.\nGiven this last thought, a natural prediction to make about how\nultimatum games will go is the following. Offerers will want to\nmaximize their self-interest, and so maximize their take-home payment.\nThey might think that, from a responder\u2019s perspective, any money\nis better than no money. So we might predict that the offer itself\nwill be as low as possible, say 1 cent or 5 cents in our example\ninvolving $10. For the responder to reject this offer would be\nirrational, since he would come away with nothing, whereas accepting\nthe offer would make him better off than he would otherwise have\nbeen.\nThis is, indeed, what many economists in the early days of research\non the ultimatum game predicted would happen, on the basis of standard\ngame theoretic assumptions (Kahneman et al. 1986: S285\u2013286;\nPillutla and Murnighan 1995: 1409; G\u00fcth 1995: 329; Camerer and Thaler 1995: 210). In other words,\ngiven a concern to promote one\u2019s own self-interest, the\nprediction is that minimal offers will be made in ultimatum games to\nmaximize one\u2019s take-home amount\u2014which is the subgame\nperfect Nash equilibrium (Kahneman et al. 1986: S289; Forsythe et\nal. 1994: 348; G\u00fcth 1995: 331; Pillutla and Murnighan 1995: 1409,\n2003: 248; Straub and Murnighan 1995: 345\u2013346).\nBut something surprising happened. Beginning with Werner\nG\u00fcth\u2019s famous paper in 1982 (G\u00fcth et al. 1982), the first\nempirical studies that were actually conducted to see what people\nwould do in this situation found a rather different result. Robert\nForsythe and his colleagues, for instance, found that not one offerer\nkept the entire amount of $10, and that offers were instead\ndistributed around the 50/50 split amount with 75% offering at least\nan equal amount (1994: 362). As we noted, this behavior by offerers is\nnot what standard game theory would have predicted. Similarly, in a\nwell-known paper Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues found that out of\n$10, the mean amount offered was $4.76 with 81% making equal split\noffers (1986: S291, see also G\u00fcth 1995).\nSurprising results were found for responders too. Kahneman also\nreports, for instance, that the mean of minimally acceptable (i.e.,\nnot rejected) offers was $2.59, with 58% demanding more than $1.50\n(Kahneman et al. 1986: S291).\nTo explain these puzzling results, several researchers began to\nmove beyond standard game theoretic assumptions and appeal to a\njustice motive. With offerers, this could be a desire to be fair in\nallocating goods, together with a belief that the fair allocation in\nthe game is an equal split. With responders, it could be a desire to\nnot be treated unfairly. This could lead to different explanations of\nrejection behavior, such as a desire to not participate in unfair\ndeals or a desire to punish someone who is behaving unfairly (Kahneman\net al.  1986: S290, see also Forsythe et al. 1994; G\u00fcth et al. 1982;\nG\u00fcth 1995; Camerer and Thaler 1995). \nBut this is not the end of the story about the research done to try\nto explain and predict ultimatum game behavior. In the 1990s, a wave\nof new studies began to cast doubt on these fairness\nexplanations. Here are some of the interesting results from this\nresearch:\n\nPaul Straub and J. Keith Murnighan (1995) varied the amount of\ninformation given to offerers and responders. Some offerers were told\nthat responders would know the amount that the offerer had to work\nwith, while other offerers were told that responders would not have\nthis piece of information at their disposal when presented with the\noffer. If the fairness hypothesis is correct, this change of\ninformation should not matter. The average offer should be roughly the\nsame in both conditions. But it wasn\u2019t. In the scenario where\nthe starting amount is $10, the mean offer made to responders was\n$4.05 in the complete information condition, but $3.14 in the partial\ninformation condition. When the amount was $80, the means were $30.73\nand $23.00 respectively (Straub and Murnighan 1995: 353).\nA similar disparity emerged when participants were responders, some\nof whom were told the amount that the offerer had to work with, and\nsome of whom were kept in the dark about this. For the ignorant group,\nthe mean lowest acceptable offer was $1.04, and 29 out of 45\nparticipants accepted an offer of $0.01. For the fully informed $10\ngroup, it was $1.92. For the fully informed $80 group, it was $17.43\n(1995: 351\u2013352). This result, though, need not be out of line\nwith what the fairness models above predict. The troublesome results\nfor fairness models arise here with respect to the offerers, not the\nresponders.\nMadan Pillutla and J. Keith Murnighan (1995) also varied\npartial versus complete information for offerers, and again found a\nsignificant difference. When the starting amount to be divided was\n$10, the mean offer given partial information was $3.54, whereas for\ncomplete information it was $4.66 (1995: 1415). The two new wrinkles\nwere (i) whether offers would come with a label \u201cthis is\nfair\u201d or not, and (ii) whether an independent third party would\nevaluate offers and decide if they were fair or not. Pillutla and\nMurnighan reasoned that if offerers really were motivated\npredominantly by fairness, then these variations should not matter\nsignificantly. But they did. For instance, in the partial information\ncondition, it was already noted that the mean offer was $3.54, but it\ndropped to $2.61 in the fair label variation (1995: 1415). Hence,\n\n [t]hey acted as if labeling an offer as fair would\nlead respondents to accept smaller offers\u2014even when the latter\nhad complete information. (1995: 1417)\n On the other hand, the mean offer increased all\nthe way to $4.67 in the third-party label variation, with 72% making\n50\u201350 offers (1995: 1415\u20131416).  These are effects that\nare easier to explain given a self-interested motivational story,\nthan they are on a fairness motivational story. As the researchers\nnote, \u201cIt seems that offerers only made equal offers when it\nwas worth their while to appear fair\u201d (1995: 1416).\nFor responders, Pillutla and Murnighan found that again small\noffers were rejected much more frequently in complete information\nversus partial information conditions. The rejection rate increased\neven more when the information was complete and the offer was labeled\nas unfair by a third party (1995: 1420).\nPillutla and Murnighan (1996) and Terry Boles and his\ncolleagues (2000) were among several researchers who introduced the\nvariation of giving outside options to responders, or options which\nthey knew they would receive if they rejected an offer. For instance,\na responder might reject an offer of $1 if he knows that he has an\noutside option of receiving $2 when rejecting an offer. With this new\ntwist, researchers can then introduce additional conditions in which\nofferers know or do not know whether there is an outside option for\nresponders, or what the value of that offer is, or what the range of\nthe offer could be, and so forth. Without getting into all the various\npermutations, one important result that Boles found was that offerers\nmade lower offers when they knew the size of the outside option, which\ndoes not seem to be what fairness would predict (Boles et al. 2000:\n247). Furthermore, Boles introduced a wrinkle whereby offerers could\nsend a message with their offer, allowing them to be deceptive about\nthe size of the allocation they had available to them in partial\ninformation conditions. The game was repeated with the same\nparticipants as offerers and responders for four rounds, and after\neach round, any deceit that offerers used was revealed to\nresponders. It turned out that offerers were deceptive 13.6% of the\ntime (2000: 247). Boles also discovered that when responders felt\ndeceived, in the next round they were much more likely to reject a new\noffer, even at the expense of their self-interest. In other words,\nthey wanted to punish the offender for deceiving them (Boles et\nal. 2000: 249\u2013250).\n\nGiven these results, a diverse array of more sophisticated\nmotivational accounts has been offered in the recent literature (For\nadditional results and discussion, see also Roth 1995; Kagel et al.\n1996; Pillutla and Murnighan 2003; Camerer 2003; Murnighan and Wang 2016.). One thing they have in common\nis that they are egoistic accounts, appealing in some way to what\nwould advance a person\u2019s self-interest. In the case of offerers,\nhere are some of the motivational proposals that have been made:\n\nLarger offers are made due to fear of rejection of smaller offers\n(Pillutla and Murnighan 1995: 1410\u20131411).\nLarger offers are made so long as one can enjoy appearing to be\nfair; otherwise smaller offers are made (Pillutla and Murnighan 1995:\n1424; Camerer and Thaler 1995: 212).\n\nIn the case of responders, here is an example of a recent egoistic\nproposal:\n\nSmall offers are rejected because of wounded pride. Although\nresponders may appeal to considerations of fairness, this only serves\nas post-hoc confabulation (Straub and Murnighan 1995: 360\u2013361;\nPillutla and Murnighan 2003: 253\u2013254).\nSo we can see a trend here (Roth 1995; Pillutla and Murnighan 1995:\n1424, 2003: 250). Initial hypotheses about participants in ultimatum\ngames relied on relatively simple egoistic motives. Those hypotheses\nwere allegedly disconfirmed by the evidence. New hypotheses were\noffered which appealed to the role of fairness motives. But then these\nhypotheses also were allegedly disconfirmed by additional evidence. So\neven newer hypotheses have now been offered that involve more\nelaborate egoistic motives. Future work will have to establish whether\nthese proposals turn out to be any more plausible in the long run.\n",
