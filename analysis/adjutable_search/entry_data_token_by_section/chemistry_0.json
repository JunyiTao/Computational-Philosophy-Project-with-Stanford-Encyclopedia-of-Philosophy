    "main_text": "Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination\n1. Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination\n\nOur contemporary understanding of chemical substances is elemental and\natomic: All substances are composed of atoms of elements such as\nhydrogen and oxygen. These atoms are the building blocks of the\nmicrostructures of compounds and hence are the fundamental units of\nchemical analysis. However, the reality of chemical atoms was\ncontroversial until the beginning of the 20th century and\nthe phrase \u201cfundamental building blocks\u201d has always\nrequired careful interpretation. So even today, the claim that all\nsubstances are composed of elements does not give us sufficient\nguidance about the ontological status of elements and how the elements\nare to be individuated.\n\nIn this section, we will begin with the issue of elements.\nHistorically, chemists have offered two answers to the question\n\u201cWhat is it for something to be an element?\u201d\n\nAn element is a substance which can exist in the isolated state\nand which cannot be further analyzed (hereafter the end of\nanalysis thesis).\nAn element is a substance which is a component of a composite\nsubstance (hereafter the actual components thesis).\n\n\nThese two theses describe elements in different ways. In the first,\nelements are explicitly identified by a procedure. Elements are simply\nthe ingredients in a mixture that can be separated no further. The\nsecond conception is more theoretical, positing elements as\nconstituents of composite bodies. In the pre-modern Aristotelian\nsystem, the end of analysis thesis was the favored option. Aristotle\nbelieved that elements were the building blocks of chemical\nsubstances, only potentially present in these substances. The modern\nconception of elements asserts that they are actual components,\nalthough, as we will see, aspects of the end of analysis thesis\nlinger. This section will explain the conceptual background behind\nchemistry\u2019s progression from one conception to the other. Along the\nway, we will discuss the persistence of elements in chemical\ncombination, the connection between element individuation and\nclassification, and criteria for determining pure substances.\n\n",
