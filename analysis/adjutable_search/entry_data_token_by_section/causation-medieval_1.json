    "main_text": "Causality and Motion || Motion in General\n1.1 Motion in General\n\nThere is a large body of medieval literature which deals with general\nchange of state: it is important because it led to a great deal of\ncareful analysis of continuous change (under the heading of \u201cintension\nand remission of forms\u201d), and this body of analysis was one of the\ncontributing currents which led to the invention of the calculus in\nthe sixteenth century. So, we can look at this literature from two\nviewpoints: either from the tradition which it grew out of \u2013\nthat of interpretations on Aristotle\u2019s Physics and the\npicture of change found there \u2013 or from the viewpoint of what it\nled to, that is, the analysis of continuous change. Either viewpoint\ncan be regarded as doing violence to the historical material, either\nby disregarding what was new in it, or by isolating the innovation\nfrom the tradition.\n\nFirst we can look at the starting point. There\nwas a great deal of argument, in the thirteenth\nand fourteenth century, about the precise interpretation of \nAristotle\u2019s theory of change: this theory talks about the bringing\nabout of change, by an agent, in a patient, and, furthermore, \nit talks about the change happening because of the transmission of a form \nfrom the agent to the patient.  The key text for this is \nAristotle, Physics III, cc2\u20133 (202a9\u201320), and it is very obscure. \nBecause of this obscurity, there is room for a good deal of disagreement\nabout the details: see (L\u00f6we 2017) for a particularly baroque example. \n\nNext we can look at study of intension and remission of forms: (Goubier and\nRoques 2017) is a good recent collection of work on this, Sylla (1982) shows\nhow this work was related to, and to some extent originated in, disputations \nabout logic, and Dumont (2009) \nshows how these debates were related to their theological context. We must not \nforget, though, that modern scholarship on this topic\ngoes back to at least Anneliese Maier (1964), whose work goes back to the\n1930s, and that she was working in the tradition of Pierre Duhem. So there is\na vast body of work on this topic, written by people with a variety\nof agendas. Despite this, it is a very interesting body of literature, \nand, if it might seem impossibly complex, it is thus because it reflects\nthe variety of medieval and early modern viewpoints on this material. \n\nMotions are, in Aristotle\u2019s physics, classified into\nnatural and violent. A paradigmatic example of\nnatural (local) motion is the motion of a freely falling body, whereas\nan example of violent (local) motion would be the motion of a thrown\nbody. The motion of a falling body is natural because\na heavy body has a natural tendency to move\ndownwards, or, as the thirteenth-century philosopher Peter of\nAuvergne puts it, \u201cbeing below is the principal end\nof a heavy body\u201d (Trifolgi 2015, p. 93).\n",
