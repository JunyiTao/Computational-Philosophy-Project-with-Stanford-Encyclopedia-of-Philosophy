    "main_text": "Non-naturalism and the Open-Question Argument\n1. Non-naturalism and the Open-Question Argument\n\nMoore\u2019s non-naturalism comprised two main theses. One was the\nrealist thesis that moral and more generally normative judgements\n\u2013 like many of his contemporaries, Moore did not distinguish the\ntwo \u2013 are true or false objectively, or independently of any\nbeliefs or attitudes we may have. The other was the autonomy-of-ethics\nthesis that moral judgements are sui generis, neither\nreducible to nor derivable from non-moral, for example scientific or\nmetaphysical, judgements; they express a distinctive kind of objective\ntruth. Closely connected to his non-naturalism was the epistemological\nview that our knowledge of moral truths is intuitive, in the sense\nthat it is not arrived at by inference from non-moral truths but rests\non our recognizing certain moral propositions as self-evident, by a\nkind of direct or immediate insight.\n\nMoore expressed the realist side of his non-naturalism by saying that\nfundamental moral judgements ascribe the property of goodness or\nbadness to states of affairs, though especially in Principia\nEthica he tended not to distinguish moral concepts and moral\nproperties. Like others of his time, he seems to have taken the\nrealist view that moral judgements are objectively true for granted;\nhe certainly did not defend it extensively against anti-realist\nalternatives. Thus the first sentence of Principia Ethica\nrefers casually, and without any sense of controversy, to the\n\u201ctruth\u201d of some ethical judgements (1903: 1/1993: 53). In\nthis he was doubtless influenced by the grammar of moral judgements,\nwhich have a standard subject-predicate form, as in \u201cx\nis good.\u201d But it may also be relevant that, at least early on,\nthe only version of subjectivism he seems to have been aware of was\nthe naturalist view that to say \u201cx is good\u201d is to\nreport some psychological fact such as that you approve of x\nor that most people in your society do. In his later book\nEthics he argued, among other things, that this view does not\nallow for moral disagreement, since, for example, my report that I\napprove of x and your report that you disapprove of it can\nboth be true (1912: 100\u201303/1947: 62\u201364/1965: 42\u201343).\nLate in his life he encountered the non-cognitivist emotivism of C.L.\nStevenson, which says that moral judgements express rather than report\nfeelings and therefore can conflict (Stevenson 1942). He initially\nconceded, surprisingly, that Stevenson\u2019s anti-realist view had\nas good a claim as his own to be true (1942: 544\u201345), but\nshortly after he reverted to his earlier non-naturalism, saying he\ncould not imagine what had induced him to consider abandoning it\n(Ewing 1962: 251).\n\nEspecially in Principia Ethica, Moore spent much more time\ndefending his other non-naturalist thesis, about the autonomy of\nethics, which he expressed by saying the property of goodness is\nsimple and unanalyzable, and in particular unanalyzable in non-moral\nterms. This meant the property is \u201cnon-natural,\u201d or\ndistinct from any of the natural properties studied by science, though\nhe also thought it distinct from metaphysical properties. Views that\ndenied this thesis committed what he called \u201cthe naturalistic\nfallacy\u201d (1903: 10/1993: 62), which he found in hedonists such\nas Jeremy Bentham, evolutionary ethicists such as Herbert Spencer, and\nmetaphysical ethicists such as T.H. Green. His main argument against\ntheir view was what has come to be known as the \u201copen-question\nargument,\u201d though he actually stated in two slightly different\nways. Consider a particular naturalist claim, such as that\n\u201cx is good\u201d is equivalent to \u201cx is\npleasant\u201d or \u201cx is pleasure.\u201dIf this claim\nwere true, he argued, the judgement \u201cPleasure is good\u201d\nwould be equivalent to \u201cPleasure is pleasure,\u201d yet surely\nsomeone who asserts the former means to express more than that\nuninformative tautology. Alternatively, if this naturalist claim were\ntrue, \u201cx is pleasant but x is not good\u201d\nwould be self-contradictory. Once it was established that x\nis pleasant, the question whether it is good would then be\nclosed, or not worth considering, whereas, he argued, it remains open.\nThe same argument can be mounted against any other naturalist\nproposal: even if we have determined that something is what we desire\nto desire or is more evolved, the question whether it is good remains\nopen, in the sense of not being settled by the meaning of the word\n\u201cgood.\u201d We can ask whether what we desire to desire is\ngood, and likewise for what is more evolved, more unified, or whatever\n(1903: 10\u201317/1993: 62\u201369). Sidgwick had used one form of\nthis argument against Bentham and Spencer, but only in passing (1907:\n26n, 109); Moore developed it a greater length and made it central to\nhis metaethics. And though he applied it specifically to\n\u201cgood,\u201d it can equally well be used about other moral or\nnormative concepts such as \u201cought\u201d and\n\u201cduty.\u201d\n\nThe open-question argument was extensively discussed in\n20th-century metaethics and met with several objections.\nOne said the argument\u2019s persuasiveness depends on the\n\u201cparadox of analysis\u201d: that any definition of a concept\nwill, if it is successful, appear uninformative. If an analysis does\ncapture all its target concept\u2019s content, the sentence linking\nthe two will be a tautology; but this is hardly a reason to reject all\nanalyses (Langford 1942). Here it can be replied that in other cases\naccepting a definition leads us to see that the sentence affirming it,\nwhile initially seeming informative, in fact is not; thus \u201ca\nbachelor is an unmarried man\u201d is not informative. This does not\nhappen, however, in the case of \u201cgood.\u201d Even if we agree\nthat only pleasure is good, no amount of reflection will make us think\n\u201cPleasure is good\u201d is equivalent to \u201cPleasure is\npleasure\u201d; Ross, for one, gave this response (1930:\n92\u201394). Another objection, made from the 1970s on and very\ninfluential, says that while the open-question argument may show that\nthe concept \u201cgood\u201d is distinct from any non-moral concept,\nit cannot support a similar conclusion about the property of goodness.\n(Recall that Moore tended not to distinguish concepts from\nproperties.) Empirical science, the objection runs, uncovers many\nnon-analytic property-identities, for example, that the property of\nbeing water is identical to the property of being H2O even\nthough the concepts \u201cwater\u201d and\n\u201cH2O\u201d are distinct. By analogy, the property of\ngoodness could be identical to that of being pleasant even if\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpleasant\u201d have different meanings\n(e.g. Brink 1989: Ch. 6). Moore\u2019s mistake, then, was to think\nthat what may indeed hold for the concept \u201cgood\u201d also\nholds for the property of goodness. Again, however, it can be replied\nthat natural-kind properties such as being water have special features\nthat allow non-analytic identities but that aren\u2019t had by\nethical properties such as goodness, for which such identities are\nimpossible. More specifically, it can be argued, the property of being\nwater is the property of having that underlying structure, whichever\nit is, the explains the behaviour of the stuff found in lakes, rivers,\nand streams; when this structure turns out to be H2O, the\nlatter property \u201cfills a gap\u201d in the former and makes the\ntwo identical (Parfit 2011, vol. 2: 298\u2013303, 329\u201338; also\nGampel 1996). But this explanation does not extend to the case of\ngoodness, which is not a higher-level property with any gap that needs\nfilling. To be good is not to have whatever other property plays some\nfunctional role; it is just to be good. It follows that if goodness is\nanalytically distinct from any natural property, it is metaphysically\ndistinct from it too.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that Moore did not explain his\nopen-question argument in the way many later non-cognitivists, who\nlikewise endorsed the argument, would. Following Hume, they held that\nmoral judgements are intrinsically motivating, so that sincerely\naccepting \u201cx is good\u201d requires a commitment or at\nleast some motivation to pursue x if that is possible (e.e.\nHare 1952: 81\u201393; Hare 1963: 22\u201329). But then no analysis\nof \u201cgood\u201d in purely natural terms can succeed, since it\ncannot capture the term\u2019s action-guiding force; nor can an\nevaluative conclusion be validly inferred from premises none of which\nhave that force. Whatever the merits of this Humean explanation, Moore\nhimself did not give it. The question whether moral judgements are\nintrinsically motivating is not one on which he expressed clear views\nor which he apparently thought important. In Principia Ethica\nhe remarked in passing that we \u201chardly ever\u201d think\nsomething good without having some attitude of will towards it, but he\ndenied that this is true universally (1903: 131, 135\u20136/1993:\n181\u201382, 186). Whether it is true universally, and what might\nfollow if it is, is not something he seems to have thought it worth\nconsidering further.\n",
