Artistic types and their tokens cannot have all and only the\nsame properties. For this reason Wolterstorff turns to a kind of\n\u201canalogous predication\u201d in which properties attributed to\nthe token are analogously attributed to the type. Suppose a\nperformance or instance of a work has the prescribed or indicated\nproperty, P. The analogous property of the work (qua type or\nkind) is the property: being such that something cannot be a correct\nor proper example of the work without having the property of being\nP. Shifting to the terminology of \u2018kinds\u2019 and\n\u2018examples\u2019, Wolterstorff focuses on properties that are\nnecessary to \u201cproperly formed\u201d examples of a kind, where\nthe kind in question is a \u201cnorm-kind\u201d that can (but need\nnot) have both improperly and properly formed instances. For example,\nsome seriously flawed attempts to play a difficult piece by Chopin are\nnonetheless performances of that work, even though they lack qualities\nthat a proper or a good instance of the work would have. This proposal\nis meant to accommodate the many cases where significantly different\nartistic and aesthetic properties figure within the occurrences or\nperformances of one and the same work (on this theme, see also Walton\n1977).\n\n\nWolterstorff accepts the thesis that works of art neither come into\nnor go out of existence (1980, 88\u201389). A kind, K, exists\nif and only if the correlated property, k, exists. With regard\nto the existence of properties, Wolterstorff\u2019s initial view\n(1970) was that for any property, being-f, this property\nexists just in case either something is-f or something is\nnot-f. Criticisms (John Perry 1974) involving Russell\u2019s\nparadox of unexemplified properties led him to qualify this\n\u201cgeneral predicate entailment principle.\u201d\n\n\nWolterstorff holds that the sequences of sounds and words of which\nmusical and literary works are made up exist everlastingly. What the\nartist does in creating a work, then, is to make it the case that a\n\u201cpreexistent kind becomes a work\u2014specifically, a\nwork of his\u201d (1980, 89). Wolterstorff\u2019s idea,\nthen, is that a composer can select but not create a sound pattern or\ntype of sound-occurrence. Although the latter is an entity that\nalready exists, it is not a musical work unless some composer has\ndetermined and perhaps recorded its correctness conditions\nqua work. Wolterstorff remarks that the composing of a\nmusical work is similar to the inventing of a game (1980, 63).\n",
