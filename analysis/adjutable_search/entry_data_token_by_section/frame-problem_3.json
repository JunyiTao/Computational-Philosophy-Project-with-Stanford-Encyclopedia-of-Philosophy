    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Common Sense Inertia\n4. The Metaphysics of Common Sense Inertia\n\n\nAn additional dimension to the frame problem is uncovered in (Fodor\n1987), where the metaphysical justification for the common sense law of\ninertia is challenged. Although Fodor himself doesn't clearly\ndistinguish this issue from other aspects of the wider frame problem,\nit appears on examination to be a separate philosophical conundrum.\nHere is the argument. As stated above, solutions to the logical frame\nproblem developed by AI researchers typically appeal to some version of\nthe common sense law of inertia, according to which properties of a\nsituation are assumed by default not to change as the result of an\naction. This assumption is supposedly justified by the very observation\nthat gave rise to the logical frame problem in the first place, namely\nthat most things don't change when an action is performed or an event\noccurs.\n\n\nAccording to Fodor, this metaphysical justification is unwarranted.\nTo begin with, some actions change many, many things. Those who affirm\nthat painting an object has little or no effect on most properties of\nmost of the objects in the room are likely to concede that detonating a\nbomb actually does affect most of those properties. But a deeper\ndifficulty presents itself when we ask what is meant by \u201cmost\nproperties\u201d. What predicates should be included in our ontology\nfor any of these claims about \u201cmost properties\u201d to fall\nout? To sharpen the point, Fodor introduces the concept of a\n\u201cfridgeon\u201d. Any particle is defined as a fridgeon\nat a given time if and only if Fodor's fridge is switched on at that\ntime. Now, it seems, the simple act of turning Fodor's fridge on or off\nbrings about an astronomical number of incidental changes. In a\nuniverse that can include fridgeons, can it really be the case that\nmost actions leave most things unchanged?\n\n\nThe point here is not a logical one. The effect on fridgeons of\nswitching Fodor's fridge on and off can concisely be represented\nwithout any difficulty (Shanahan 1997, 25). Rather, the point is\nmetaphysical. The common sense law of inertia is only justified in the\ncontext of the right ontology, the right choice of objects and\npredicates. But what is the right ontology to make the common sense law\nof inertia work? Clearly, fridgeons and the like are to be excluded.\nBut what metaphysical principle underpins such a decision?\n\n\nThese questions and the argument leading to them are very\nreminiscent of Goodman's treatment of induction (Goodman 1954).\nGoodman's\n \u201cnew riddle of induction\u201d,\n commonly called the grue paradox,\ninvites us to consider the predicate grue, which is true\nbefore time t only of objects that are green and after time\nt only of objects that are blue. The puzzle is that every\ninstance of a green emerald examined before time t is also an\ninstance of a grue emerald. So, the inductive inference that all\nemeralds are grue seems to be no less legitimate than the inductive\ninference that all emeralds are green. The problem, of course, is the\nchoice of predicates. Goodman showed that inductive inference only\nworks in the context of the right set of predicates, and Fodor\ndemonstrates much the same point for the common sense law of\ninertia.\n\n\nAn intimate relationship of a different kind between the frame\nproblem and the problem of induction is proposed by Fetzer (1991), who\nwrites that \u201cThe problem of induction [is] one of justifying some\ninferences about the future as opposed to others. The frame problem,\nlikewise, is one of justifying some inferences about the future as\nopposed to others. The second problem is an instance of the\nfirst.\u201d This view of the frame problem is highly controversial,\nhowever (Hayes 1991).\n",
