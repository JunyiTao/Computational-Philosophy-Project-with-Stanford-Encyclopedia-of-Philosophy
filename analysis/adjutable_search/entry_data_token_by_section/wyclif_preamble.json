    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Wyclif (ca. 1330\u201384) was one of the most important and\nauthoritative thinkers of the Middle Ages. His activity is set in the\nvery crucial period of late Scholasticism, when the new ideas and\ndoctrines there propounded accelerated the transition to the modern\nway of thought. On the one hand, he led a movement of opposition to\nthe medieval Church and to some of its dogmas and institutions, and\nwas a forerunner of the Reformation; on the other, he was also the\nmost prominent English philosopher of the second half of the\n14th century. His logical and ontological theories are, at\nthe same time, the final result of the preceding realistic tradition\nof thought and the starting-point of the new forms of realism at the\nend of the Middle Ages, since many authors active during the last\ndecades of the 14th and the first decades of the\n15th centuries (Robert Alyngton, William Penbygull,\nJohannes Sharpe, William Milverley, Roger Whelpdale, John Tarteys, and\nPaul of Venice), were heavily influenced by his metaphysics and\nlargely used his logical apparatus. However, his philosophical system,\nrigorous in its general design, contains unclear and aporetic points\nthat his followers attempted to remove. Although an influential\nthinker, Wyclif pointed to the strategy the Realists at the\nend of the Middle Ages were to adopt, rather than fully developed\nit.\n",
