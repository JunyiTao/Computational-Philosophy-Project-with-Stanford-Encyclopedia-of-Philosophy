    "main_text": "Answering the Evaluation Question || Manipulation and Treating Persons as Things\n3.4 Manipulation and Treating Persons as Things\n\nSeveral accounts of manipulation tie its moral status to the fact that\nit influences behavior by methods that seem analogous to how one might\noperate a tool or a device. On this view, manipulation involves\ntreating the target as a device to be operated rather than an agent to\nbe reasoned with. As Claudia Mills puts it,\n\n\na manipulator is interested in reasons not as logical justifiers but\nas causal levers. For the manipulator, reasons are tools, and bad\nreasons can work as well as, or better than, a good one. (Mills 1995:\n100\u2013101)\n\n\nThe point here is that a manipulator treats his target not as a fellow\nrational agent, for that would require giving good reasons for doing\nas the manipulator proposes. Instead, the manipulator treats his\ntarget as a being whose behavior is to be elicited by pressing the\nmost effective \u201ccausal levers\u201d.\n\nOf course, the idea that treating a person as a mere object is immoral\nis a prominent feature of Kant\u2019s account of respect for persons\n(see the entry on\n respect).\n Thus, it would be natural to appeal to Kantian ideas to help\nelaborate the idea that manipulation is wrong because of the way that\nit treats its target. As Thomas E. Hill writes,\n\n\nThe idea that one should try to reason with others rather than to\nmanipulate them by nonrational techniques is manifest in Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of the duty to respect others. (Hill 1980: 96)\n\n\nAlthough\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\n is a natural place to look for the idea that the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation derives from a failure to treat the target as a person,\nthere are potential drawbacks to tying the account too tightly to\nKant. For Kant\u2019s notion of rational agency appears to be of the\nhyper-cognitive, hyper-intellectual variety. Hence, if it is unethical\nto fail to treat someone as that kind of rational agent, we\nmight be pushed toward the conclusion that the only acceptable basis\nfor human interaction is the kind of coldly intellectual rational\npersuasion that excludes any appeal to emotions. But as we saw\nearlier, there are good reasons for regarding such a conclusion as\nimplausible.\n\nThese considerations certainly do not entail that it is hopeless to\nlook to some notion of treating persons as things for an account of\nthe wrongfulness of manipulation. But they do suggest that more work\nmust be done before the claim that manipulation is wrong because it\ntreats a person as a mere thing can be regarded as much more than a\nplatitude.\n",
