    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The Parallel Case for CH\n5.2 The Parallel Case for CH\nThe parallel case for CH also has two steps, the first involving\n\u03a9-completeness and the second involving maximality. \n The first result in the first step is the following: \n\nTheorem 5.4 (Woodin\n1985). Assume ZFC and that there is a\nproper class of measurable Woodin cardinals. Then ZFC +\nCH is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a321. \nMoreover, up to \u03a9-equivalence, CH is the unique\n\u03a321-statement\nthat is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a321; that\nis, letting TA be the \u03a9-complete theory\ngiven by ZFC + A where A is\n\u03a321, all\nsuch TA are \u03a9-equivalent\nto TCH and hence (trivially) all\nsuch TA contain CH. In other words, there is\na \u201cgood\u201d theory and all \u201cgood\u201d theories imply\nCH. \n To complete the first step we have to determine whether this\nresult is robust. For it could be the case that when one considers the\nnext level,\n\u03a322 (or\nfurther levels, like third-order arithmetic) CH is no longer part of\nthe picture, that is, perhaps large cardinals imply that there is an\naxiom A such that ZFC + A is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a322 (or,\ngoing further, all of third order arithmetic) and yet not all\nsuch A have an associated TA which\ncontains CH. We must rule this out if we are to secure the first\nstep. \n The most optimistic scenario along these lines is this: The\nscenario is that there is a large cardinal axiom L and\naxioms A\u2192 such that ZFC\n+ L + A\u2192 is\n\u03a9-complete for all of third-order arithmetic and all such\ntheories are \u03a9-equivalent and imply CH. Going further, perhaps\nfor each specifiable fragment V\u03bb of the\nuniverse of sets there is a large cardinal axiom L and\naxioms A\u2192 such that ZFC\n+ L + A\u2192 is\n\u03a9-complete for the entire theory of V\u03bb\nand, moreover, that such theories are \u03a9-equivalent and imply\nCH. Were this to be the case it would mean that for each such \u03bb\nthere is a unique \u03a9-complete picture\nof V\u03bb and we would have a unique\n\u03a9-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the\nuniverse of sets. This would make for a strong case for new axioms\ncompleting the axioms of ZFC and large cardinal axioms. \n Unfortunately, this optimistic scenario fails: Assuming the\nexistence of one such theory one can construct another which differs\non CH: \n\nTheorem 5.5 (Koellner and\nWoodin 2009). Assume ZFC and that there is a\nproper class of Woodin\ncardinals. Suppose V\u03bb is a\nspecifiable fragment of the universe (that is sufficiently\nlarge) and suppose that there is a large cardinal\naxiom L and axioms\nA\u2192 such that \n\nZFC + L + A\u2192 is \u03a9-complete\nfor Th(V\u03bb).\n Then there are axioms B\u2192 such that \n\nZFC + L +\nB\u2192 is \u03a9-complete\nfor Th(V\u03bb)\n and the first theory \u03a9-implies CH if\nand only if the second theory \u03a9-implies\n\u00acCH.  \n This still leaves us with the question of existence and the answer\nto this question is sensitive to the \u03a9 Conjecture and the\nAD+ Conjecture: \n\nTheorem 5.6\n(Woodin). Assume that there is a proper\nclass of Woodin cardinals and that the \u03a9 Conjecture\nholds. Then there is no recursive\ntheory A\u2192 such\nthat ZFC +\nA\u2192 is \u03a9-complete for the\ntheory\nof V\u03b40+1, where\n\u03b40 is the least Woodin cardinal. \nIn fact, under a stronger assumption, the scenario must fail at a\nmuch earlier level. \n\nTheorem 5.7\n(Woodin). Assume that there is a proper\nclass of Woodin cardinals and that the \u03a9 Conjecture\nholds. Assume that the AD+ Conjecture\nholds. Then there is no recursive\ntheory A\u2192 such\nthat ZFC +\nA\u2192 is \u03a9-complete for the\ntheory of\n\u03a323. \nIt is open whether there can be such a theory at the level of\n\u03a322. It\nis conjectured that ZFC + \u25c7 is \u03a9-complete (assuming large\ncardinal axioms) for\n\u03a322. \n Let us assume that it is answered positively and return to the\nquestion of uniqueness. For each such axiom A,\nlet TA be the\n\u03a322\ntheory computed by ZFC + A in \u03a9-logic. The question of\nuniqueness simply asks whether TA is\nunique. \n\nTheorem 5.8 (Koellner and\nWoodin 2009). Assume that there is a proper class of\nWoodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom\nsuch that \n\n\n\u00a0i. ZFC + A is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii. ZFC + A is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a322.\n\n\nThen there is an axiom B such that \n\n\n\u00a0i\u2032. ZFC + B is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii\u2032. ZFC + B is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a322\n\n\nand TA\u2260TB. \nThis is the parallel of Theorem 5.2. \n To complete the parallel one would need that CH is among all of\nthe TA. This is not known. But it is a\nreasonable conjecture. \n\nConjecture 5.9.  Assume large cardinal\naxioms. \n\n There is\nan \u03a322\naxiom A such that \n ZFC + A is \u03a9-satisfiable and \nZFC + A is \u03a9-complete for\nthe\n\u03a322.\n\n\nAny such\n\u03a322\naxiom A has the feature that ZFC +\nA \u22a7\u03a9 CH.\n\n\nShould this conjecture hold it would provide a true analogue of\nTheorem 5.1. This would complete the parallel with the first\nstep. \n There is also a parallel with the second step. Recall that for the\nsecond step in the previous subsection we had that although the\nvarious TA did not agree, they all contained\n\u00acCH and, moreover, from among them there is one that stands out,\nnamely the theory given by (\u2217), since this theory maximizes the\n\u03a02-theory of the structure \u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, \nA | A \u2208 P\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9. In the present context of CH we\nagain (assuming the conjecture) have that although\nthe TA do not agree, they all contain CH. It\nturns out that once again, from among them there is one that stands\nout, namely, the maximum one. For it is known (by a result of Woodin\nin 1985) that if there is a proper class of measurable Woodin\ncardinals then there is a forcing extension satisfying all\n\u03a322\nsentences \u03c6 such that ZFC + CH + \u03c6 is\n\u03a9-satisfiable (see Ketchersid, Larson, & Zapletal\n(2010)).  It follows that if the question of existence is answered\npositively with an A that is\n\u03a322\nthen TA must be this maximum\n\u03a322\ntheory and, consequently, all TA agree\nwhen A is\n\u03a322. So,\nassuming that there is a TA where A is\n\u03a322,\nthen, although not all TA agree\n(when A is arbitrary) there is one that stands out, namely, the\none that is maximum for\n\u03a322\nsentences. \n Thus, if the above conjecture holds, then the case of CH\nparallels that of \u00acCH, only now\n\u03a322 takes\nthe place of the theory of H(\u03c92). \n",
