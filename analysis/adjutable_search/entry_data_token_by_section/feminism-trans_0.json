    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\nTransgender is often used to refer to people who \u201cdo\nnot conform to prevailing expectations about gender\u201d by\npresenting and living genders that were not assigned to them at birth\nor by presenting and living genders in ways that may not be readily\nintelligible in terms of more traditional conceptions of gender. Used\nas an umbrella term, it generally aims to group several different kinds\nof people such as transsexuals, drag queens and kings, some butch\nlesbians, and (heterosexual) male cross dressers. Earlier the term\ntransgenderist had been used by Virginia Prince, a pioneer in\nthe cross dresser movement in the US, to stand for a person who lives\nin the gender \u201copposite\u201d the one assigned to them at birth\nbut who is not a transsexual (Stryker 2008, 123). It seems that Leslie\nFeinberg was one of the first to use this as a political, umbrella term\n(ibid).\n\n\nThe term currently flags the political stance, especially\nin the Anglo United States, of resisting medical pathologization of\ntrans people. This places it in prima facie opposition to the\nolder notion of transsexual (at least in the more traditional\nsense of that word). The term transgender is also sometimes\nused as an equivalent to transgenderist, to refer to folk who\nlive full-time in the role other than the one assigned to them at birth\nbut who do not see themselves as transsexual.\n\nTranssexual is often used to refer to individuals who use\nhormonal and/or surgical technologies to alter their bodies to conform\nto their gendered sense of self in ways that may be construed as at\nodds with the sex assigned at birth or in ways that may not be readily\nintelligible in terms of traditional conceptions of sexed bodies. It\nmay also be used to indicate people who self-identify and live as the\nsex \u201copposite\u201d to the one assigned to them at birth. The\ncondition of being a transsexual has been captured by the terms\ntranssexualism and transsexuality, the latter of\nwhich will be used in this entry.\n\n\nTraditionally, the term transsexual has been connected to\npsychiatric notions such as gender dysphoria and has also been associated\nwith the metaphor \u201ctrapped in the wrong body.\u201d The term was\nfirst used in English by David Caldwell (spelled with one s). It was then\npopularized by Harry Benjamin (spelled with two). Transsexual\nhas now also been redeployed in ways amenable to and possibly\nsubsumable under the more recent term transgender (depending,\nin part, upon one's political stance). It may also be\nused as a political term indicating a break from the term\ntransgender and as possibly contesting the underlying\npolitical ideology of \u201cthe transgender movement.\u201d\n\nFTM and MTF are abbreviations of\nfemale-to-male and male-to-female. They were\noriginally connected to transsexual (medical) discourse indicating\nindividuals who transition to the \u201copposite\u201d sex. They are\nnow used in ways that have broken from this medical discourse and may\nbe used more generally to indicate folk who move away from being\nassigned male (or female) at birth to the \u201cother\u201d\ndirection. They may also be used as primitive (undefined) terms. This\nmeans that they are not treated as abbreviations indicating transition\nfrom one sex to another. Instead, they are used to simply categorize\nindividuals in a way analogous to the categories man and\nwoman.\n\nQueer is a political and theoretical term and a reclamation\nof the word used as an insult. Politically it was associated with\ngroups such as Queer Nation and is used as umbrella term to apply to\nindividuals often associated with the categories lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transgender (LGBT). It generally indicates opposition to\nidentity-based categories and signals a strong antipathy for\n\u201cheteronormativity\u201d (roughly: the taken-for-granted social\nand sexual arrangements in a heterosexual-centered world-view).\nQueer Theory roughly applies to theoretical work, typically\ninformed by Foucault and Derrida, that aims to study and\n\u201cdeconstruct\u201d heteronormative ideology. It emerged in the\n1990s through thinkers such as Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky\nSedgwick. The term genderqueer draws on the political force\nof queer. It is used as a term of self-identification by\nindividuals who do not subscribe to the traditional binary division\nbetween male/female, man/woman, and masculine/feminine. An individual\nwho self-identifies may claim both sexes or genders, neither, or a\ncomplex blend of them.\n\n\n\nSince around 2010, the term trans* has been used in place\nof transgender and trans in order to provide for\nmore possibilities. One of the reasons for this is that many of the\npeople who self-identify as trans (or as transgender) identify as men\nor women and therefore in one way place themselves within traditional\nbinary categories. As a consequence, those who do not place themselves\nwithin the binary (e.g., genderqueer people) are effectively left out,\ndespite the original intention behind transgender as an inclusive\numbrella term. Since its introduction, unfortunately the term is also\nnow frequently used as a prefix that occurs before woman or man (as in\ntrans* man and trans* woman) in well-intentioned efforts at\ninclusivity. A problem, however, is that such a use may replicate the\nvery problem that led to the introduction of trans* in the first place\nby generating the expectation that trans* people are either trans* men\nor trans* women and thereby eliding trans* identities that resist\nplacement within a gender binary. Moreover, many trans people may not\nself-identify as trans* and so there is a problem of wrongfully\nimputing identities (and political agendas) that run contrary to\nself-identifications.\n\n\nIn this entry, trans will be used as a place-holder for the\npossibly productive political tensions discussed above (transsexual\nvs. transgender, trans* vs. transgender). Since many forms of\ntransphobia involve categorizing individuals contrary to their own\nsense of self, caution is required in applying terms to individuals\nwho may not self-identify with them. In light of this, the use\nof trans should not be understood to impute an identity or a\nshared political vision. Rather, it is a functional term restricted to\nthis entry alone, and is not intended to invoke a shared category\namong diverse individuals The expressions trans women\nand trans men will be used to refer to MTFs and FTMs who\nself-identify as women and men respectively (where trans\nfunctions as a context-restricted placeholder for the aforementioned\npolitical tensions.\n",
