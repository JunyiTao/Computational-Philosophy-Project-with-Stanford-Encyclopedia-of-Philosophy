As we have just seen, this class is defined in terms of the reference model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) in virtue of the assumption that it is a \u2018reasonable\u2019 model of computation. Several other models of computation are also studied in complexity theory not because they are presumed to be accurate representations of the costs of concretely embodied computation, but rather because they help us better understand the limits of feasible computability. The most important of these is the non-deterministic Turing machine model \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\).\nRecall that a deterministic Turing machine \\(T \\in \\mathfrak{T}\\) can be represented as a tuple \\(\\langle Q,\\Sigma,\\delta,s \\rangle\\) where \\(Q\\) is a finite set of internal states, \\(\\Sigma\\) is a finite tape alphabet, \\(s \\in Q\\) is \\(T\\)\u2019s start state, and \\(\\delta\\) is a transition function mapping state-symbol pairs \\(\\langle q,\\sigma \\rangle\\) into state-action pairs \\(\\langle q,a \\rangle\\). Here \\(a\\) is chosen from the set of actions \\(\\{\\sigma,\\Leftarrow,\\Rightarrow \\}\\) \u2013 i.e. write the symbol \\(\\sigma \\in \\Sigma\\) on the current square, move the head left, or move the head right. Such a function is hence of type \\(\\delta: Q \\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow Q \\times \\alpha\\). On the other hand, a non-deterministic Turing machine \\(N \\in \\mathfrak{N}\\) is of the form \\(\\langle Q,\\Sigma,\\Delta,s \\rangle\\) where \\(Q,\\Sigma\\), and \\(s\\) are as before but \\(\\Delta\\) is now only required to be a relation \u2013 i.e. \\(\\Delta \\subseteq (Q \\times \\Sigma) \\times (Q \\times \\alpha)\\). As a consequence, a machine configuration in which \\(N\\) is in state \\(q\\) and reading symbol \\(\\sigma\\) can lead to finitely many distinct successor configurations \u2013 e.g. it is possible that \\(\\Delta\\) relates \\(\\langle q,\\sigma \\rangle\\) to both \\(\\langle q',a' \\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle q'',a'' \\rangle\\) for distinct states \\(q'\\) and \\(q''\\) and actions \\(a'\\) and \n \\(a''\\).[11]\nThis difference in the definition of deterministic and non-deterministic machines also necessitates a change in the definition of what it means for a machine to decide a language \\(X\\). Recall that for a deterministic machine \\(T\\), a computation sequence starting from an initial configuration \\(C_0\\) is a finite or infinite sequence of machine configurations \\(C_0,C_1,C_2, \\ldots\\) Such a configuration consists of a specification of the contents of \\(T\\)\u2019s tape, internal state, and head position. \\(C_{i+1}\\) is the unique configuration determined by applying the transition function \\(\\delta\\) to the active state-symbol pair encoded by \\(C_i\\) and is undefined if \\(\\delta\\) is itself undefined on this pair (in which case the computation sequence is finite, corresponding to a halting computation). If \\(N\\) is a non-deterministic machine, however, there may be more than one configuration which is related to the current configuration by \\(\\Delta\\) at the current head position. In this case, a finite or infinite sequence \\(C_0,C_1,C_2, \\ldots\\) is said to be a computation sequence for \\(N\\) from the initial configuration \\(C_0\\) just in case for all \\(i \\geq 0\\), \\(C_{i+1}\\) is among the configurations which are related by \\(\\Delta\\) to \\(C_i\\) (and is similarly undefined if no such configuration exists).\nWe now also redefine what is required for the machine \\(N\\) to decide a language \\(X\\):\n\n\n\\(N\\) always halts \u2013 i.e. for all initial configurations \\(C_0\\), the computation sequence \\(C_0,C_1,C_2, \\ldots\\) of \\(N\\) is of finite length;\n\nif \\(x \\in X\\) and \\(C_0(x)\\) is the configuration of \\(N\\) encoding \\(x\\) as input, then there exists a computation sequence \\(C_0(x),C_1(x), \\ldots, C_n(x)\\) of \\(N\\) such that \\(C_n(x)\\) is an accepting state;\n\nif \\(x \\not\\in X\\), then all computation sequences \\(C_0(x),C_1(x), \\ldots, C_n(x)\\) of \\(N\\) are such that \\(C_{n}(x)\\) is a rejecting state.\n\nNote that this definition treats accepting and rejecting computations asymmetrically. For if \\(x \\in X\\), some of \\(N\\)\u2019s computation sequences starting from \\(C_0(x)\\) may still lead to rejecting states as long as it least one leads to an accepting state. On the other hand, if \\(x \\not\\in X\\), then all of \\(N\\)\u2019s computations from \\(C_0(x)\\) are required to lead to rejecting states.\nNon-deterministic machines are sometimes described as making undetermined \u2018choices\u2019 among different possible successor configurations at various points during their computation. But what the foregoing definitions actually describe is a tree \\(\\mathcal{T}^N_{C_0}\\) of all possible computation sequences starting from a given configuration \\(C_0\\) for a deterministic machine \\(N\\) (an example is depicted in Figure 1). Given the asymmetry just noted, it will generally be the case that all of the branches in \\(\\mathcal{T}^N_{C_0(x)}\\) must be surveyed in order to determine \\(N\\)\u2019s decision about the input \\(x\\).\n\n\nFigure 1. A potential computation tree \\(\\mathcal{T}^N_{C_0(x)}\\) for a non-deterministic Turing machine \\(N\\) starting from the initial configuration \\(C_0(x)\\). Accepting states are labeled \\(\\odot\\) and rejecting states \\(\\circ\\). Note that although this tree contains an accepting computation sequence of length 4, its maximum depth of 5 still counts towards the determination of \\(time_N(n) = \\max \\{\\text{depth}(\\mathcal{T}^N_{C_0(x)})\\ :\\ \\lvert x\\rvert = n\\)}.\n\nThe time complexity \\(t_N(n)\\) of a non-deterministic machine \\(N\\) is the maximum of the depths of the computation trees \\(\\mathcal{T}^N_{C_0(x)}\\) for all inputs \\(x\\) such that \\(\\lvert x\\rvert = n\\). Relative to this definition, non-deterministic machines can be used to implement many brute force algorithms in time polynomial in \\(n\\). For instance the \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) problem can be solved by a non-deterministic machine which on input \\(\\phi\\) uses part of its tape to non-deterministically construct (or \u2018guess\u2019) a string representing a valuation \\(v\\) assigning a truth value to each of \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s \\(n\\) propositional variables and then computes \\(\\llbracket \\phi \\rrbracket_v\\) using the method of truth tables (which is polynomial in \\(n\\)). As \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{SAT}\\) just in case a satisfying valuation exists, this is a correct method for deciding \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) relative to conventions (i)\u2013(iii) from above. This means that \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) can be solved in polynomial time relative to \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\).\nThis example also illustrates why adding non-determinism to the original deterministic model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) does not enlarge the class of decidable problems. For if \\(N \\in \\mathfrak{N}\\) decides \\(X\\), then it is possible to construct a machine \\(T_N \\in \\mathfrak{T}\\) which also decides \\(X\\), by successively simulating each of the finitely many possible sequences of non-deterministic choices \\(N\\) might have made in the course of its \n computation.[12] \n It is evident that if \\(N\\) has time complexity \\(f(n)\\), then \\(T_N\\) must generally check \\(O(k^{f(n)})\\) sequences of choices (for fixed \\(k\\)) in order to determine the output of \\(N\\) for an input of length \\(n\\). While the availability of such simulations shows that the class of languages decided by \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\) is the same as that decided by \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) \u2013 i.e. exactly the recursive ones \u2013 it also illustrates why the polynomial time decidability of a language by a non-deterministic Turing machine only guarantees that the language is decidable in exponential time by a deterministic Turing machine.\nIn order to account for this observation, Emde Boas (1990) introduced a distinction between two classes of models of computation which he labels the first and  second machine classes. The first machine class contains the basic Turing machine model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) as well as other models which satisfy the Invariance Thesis with respect to this model. As we have seen, this includes the multi-tape and multi-head Turing machine models as well as the RAM model. On the other hand, the second machine class is defined to include those deterministic models whose members can be used to efficiently simulate non-deterministic computation. This can be shown to include a number of standard models of parallel computation such as the PRAM machine which will be discussed in \n Section 3.4.3.  For such models the definitions of polynomial time, non-deterministic polynomial time, and polynomial space coincide.\nExperience has borne out that members of the first machine class are the ones which we should consider reasonable models of computation in the course of formulating the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis. It is also widely believed that members of the second machine class do not provide realistic representations of the complexity costs involved in concretely embodied computation (Chazelle and Monier (1983), Schorr (1983), Vit\u00e1nyi (1986)). Demonstrating this formally would, however, require proving separation results for complexity classes which are currently unresolved. Thus while it is widely believed that the second machine class properly extends the first, this is currently an open problem.\n",
