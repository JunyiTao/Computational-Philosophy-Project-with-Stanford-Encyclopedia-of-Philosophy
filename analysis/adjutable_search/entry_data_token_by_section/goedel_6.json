Perhaps the\nimportance he placed on the concept of evidence (see below) led to his\nclose consideration of it.\n\nWe discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s results on intuitionistic logic in their\nchronological order.\n2.5.1 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is not Finitely-Valued\n\nBoth many-valued logic, introduced by \u0141ukasiewicz in the twenties\n(\u0141ukasiewicz 1970) and intuitionistic logic, formalized by\nHeyting in 1930, fail to satisfy the law of excluded middle. It was\ntherefore natural to ask whether intuitionistic logic can be presented\nas a many-valued logic, and indeed a number of logicians in the 1920s\nhad suggested just that. In his 1932 G\u00f6del gave a simple argument\nwhich shows that intuitionistic propositional logic cannot be thought\nof as a finitely-valued logic. Precisely, G\u00f6del proved two\ntheorems:\n\nTheorem 7.\n\nThere is no realization with finitely many elements (truth values) for\nwhich the formulas provable in H, and only those, are\nsatisfied (that is, yield designated values for an arbitrary\nassignment).\n\n\n(H is intuitionistic propositional logic, after\nHeyting.)\n\nTheorem 8.\n\nInfinitely many systems lie between H and the system\nA of the ordinary propositional calculus, that is,\nthere is a monotonically decreasing sequence of systems all of which\ninclude H as a subset and are included in\nA as subsets.\n\n\nIn his proof he considered for each natural number n > 0\nthe sentence\n\nFn = \u22281\n\u2264 i < j \u2264 n\npi \u2261\npj.\n\n\nHe observed that in an n-valued logic the sentences\nFm, for m > n,\nshould be derivable. However, G\u00f6del showed,\nFn is not derivable from Heyting\u2019s\naxioms for any n.\n\nSubsequently Ja\u015bkowski (Ja\u015bkowski 1936) showed that\nintuitionistic propositional logic can be given a many-valued\nsemantics in terms of infinitely many truth-values. For further\ndiscussion of many-valued logics, see for example the entry on\n many-valued logic\n in this encyclopedia as well as van Stigt\u2019s article on\nintuitionistic logic in Mancosu 1998.\n2.5.2 Classical Arithmetic is Interpretable in Heyting Arithmetic\n\nWe now consider G\u00f6del 1933e, in which G\u00f6del showed, in\neffect, that intuitionistic or Heyting arithmetic is only apparently\nweaker than classical first-order arithmetic. This is because the\nlatter can be interpreted within the former by means of a simple\ntranslation, and thus to be convinced of the consistency of classical\narithmetic, it is enough to be convinced of the consistency of Heyting\narithmetic. Heyting arithmetic is defined to be the same as classical\narithmetic, except that the underlying predicate logic is given by\nintuitionistic axioms and rules of inference (see below).\n\nThis result extends the same assertion for the propositional case. Let\nH denote the intuitionistic propositional logic, and\nA denote its classical counterpart (as above).\nInductively define:\n\n\n\n\nA\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac\u00acA (A atomic) \n\n(\u00acA)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00acA\u2032 \n\n(A \u2192 B)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac(A\u2032 \u2227\n\u00acB\u2032) \n\n(A \u2228 B)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac(\u00acA\u2032 \u2227\n\u00acB\u2032) \n\n(A \u2227 B)\u2032\n\u2261\nA\u2032 \u2227 B\u2032\n \n\n\n\nThen,\n\nTheorem 9.\n\nLet F be a propositional formula. Then H\n\u22a2 F if and only if A \u22a2\nF\u2032,\n\n\nThe theorem follows easily from the result of Glivenko (1929) that\n\u00acF follows from H if and only if\n\u00acF follows from A, for any propositional\nformula F.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s so-called double negation interpretation extends\nTheorem 9 to a reduction of classical first order logic to\nintuitionistic predicate logic. The translation in this case can be\ntaken to map A\u2032 to A for atomic A.\nMoreover, we let \u2200xA(x)\u2032 =\n\u2200xA\u2032(x) :\n\nTheorem 10.\n\nSuppose A is a first order formula. If A is provable\nin classical first order logic, then A\u2032 is provable in\nintuitionistic first order logic.\n\n\nThe above result had been obtained independently by Gentzen (with\nBernays), but upon hearing of G\u00f6del\u2019s result Gentzen\nwithdrew his paper from publication. It had also been anticipated by\nKolmogorov in his 1925 \u201cOn the Principle of the Excluded\nMiddle,\u201d (English translation van Heijenoort 1967) but that\npaper was largely unknown to logicians who were outside of\nKolmogorov\u2019s circle.\n\nBernays has written (see Bernays\u2019 entry on David Hilbert in\nEdwards 1967) that this result of G\u00f6del\u2019s drew the\nattention of the Hilbert school to two observations: first, that\nintuitionistic logic goes beyond finitism, and secondly, that finitist\nsystems may not be the only acceptable ones from the foundational\npoint of view.\n\nThe following theorem for the case of arithmetic follows from Theorem\n10:\n\nTheorem 11.\n\nSuppose A is a first order formula of arithmetic. If\nA is provable in classical Peano arithmetic, then\nA\u2032 is provable in intuitionistic first order\narithmetic.\n\n\nFor a list of the axioms and rules of intuitionistic first order logic\nsee G\u00f6del 1958, reprinted with detailed introductory note by A.S.\nTroelstra in G\u00f6del 1990. See also Troelstra 1973, and\nTroelstra\u2019s \u201cAspects of constructive mathematics\u201d in\nBarwise 1977. For a detailed proof of the above theorem the reader is\nreferred also to the latter.\n2.5.3 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is Interpretable in S4\n\nThis result of G\u00f6del\u2019s (G\u00f6del 1933f), which marks the\nbeginning of provability logic, makes exact the difference between the\nconcept of \u201cprovability in a specified formal system\u201d and\nthat of \u201cprovability by any correct means.\u201d\n\nG\u00f6del had already noted this difference in the introduction to\nhis 1929 thesis. The context was the following: G\u00f6del entertains\nthere the possibility that his proof of the Completeness Theorem might\nbe circular, since the law of excluded middle was used to prove it.\nThis is because while the Completeness Theorem asserts \u2018a kind\nof decidability,\u2019 namely every quantificational formula is\neither provable or a counterexample to it can be given, \u2018the\nprinciple of the excluded middle seems to express nothing other than\nthe decidability of every problem\u2019:\n\n\u2026 what is affirmed (by the law of excluded middle) is the\nsolvability not at all through specified means but only through all\nmeans that are in any way imaginable \u2026\n [20]\n\n\nG\u00f6del considers intuitionistic propositional logic (henceforth\nIPL); he also considers a second system, classical propositional logic\nenriched by an operator \u201cB\u201d, where the intended meaning of\n\u201cB\u201d is \u201cprovable.\u201d The axiom system now known\nas S4 (for a list of these axioms see for example the\nentry on\n modal logic\n in this encyclopedia) is added to the standard axioms for classical\npropositional logic together with a new rule of proof: from\nA, BA may be inferred. Let us call this second\nsystem G. G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem states that\nIPL is interpretable in G via the following\ntranslation:\n\n\n\n\n\u00acp\n\u2261\n~Bp \n\np \u2283 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2192 Bq \n\np \u2228 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2228 Bq \n\np \u2227 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2227 Bq  \n\n\n\nThat is,\n\nTheorem 12.\n\nLet A be a formula of IPL, and let A\u2032\nbe its translation. Then IPL \u22a2 A implies\nG \u22a2 A\u2032.\n\n\nG\u00f6del conjectures that the converse implication must be true, and\nindeed this was shown in McKinsey and Tarski 1948.\n\nThe difference between the two notions of provability: \u201cprovable\nin a given formal system S\u201d and provability by any\ncorrect means \u2014 manifests itself as a consequence of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness Theorem, as follows. Let\nS contain Peano arithmetic, and let the operator B be\ninterpreted as \u201cprovable in S\u201d. If the axioms of\nS4 were valid for this interpretations of B,\nthen from B(0 \u2260 1) \u2192 (0 \u2260 1), the sentence\n\u00acB(0 \u2260 1) would be provable, contradicting the Second\nIncompleteness Theorem.\n\nFor further discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, its antecedents\nand its extensions, as well as its philosophical significance, the\nreader is referred to A.S Troelstra\u2019s introduction to\n1933f.\n2.5.4 Heyting Arithmetic is Interpretable into Computable Functionals of Finite Type.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s so-called Dialectica intepretation (G\u00f6del\n1958) delivers a relative consistency proof and justification for\nHeyting arithmetic by means of a concrete interpretation involving a\nsystem T of computable functionals of finite type. Taken\ntogether with his 1933e, which reduces classical first order\narithmetic to Heyting arithmetic, a justification in these terms is\nalso obtained for classical first order arithmetic.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s inductive definition of the notion \u201cfunction\nof finite type\u201d is as follows: (G\u00f6del 1990, p. 245).\n\nThe functionals of type 0 are the natural numbers.\nIf t0,\u2026,\ntk are types and we have already defined\nwhat functionals of types\nt0,\u2026,tk are,\nthen (t0,\u2026,\ntk) is a type and a functional of that\ntype assigns to every k-tuple of functionals of respective\ntypes t1,\u2026,\ntk, a functional of type\nt0.\n\n\nG\u00f6del considers the quantifier free theory of these functionals\nof finite type, denoted by T. T has the following\nfeatures: the language of T contains variables of each type,\nconstants for distinguished types, and a ternary predicate\n=\u03c3 for equality for type \u03c3. Equality between\nterms of the same type is decidable. The non-logical axioms and rules\nfor T include the classical arithmetic axioms for 0 and\nsuccessor, and the induction rule:\n\n(F(0) \u2227 (F(x0) \u2192\nF(S(x0)))) \u2192\nF(x0)\n\n\nfor quantifier-free formulas F(x0). As\nG\u00f6del remarks (G\u00f6del 1990, p. 247), the axioms for\nT are essentially those of primitive recursive arithmetic,\nexcept that the variables can be of any finite type.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s translation associates with every formula\nF(x) of the language of Peano arithmetic a\nformula F\u2032(x) =\n\u2203y\u2200zA(y,\nz, x) of the language of the theory\nT, where A is quantifier free and the (boldface)\nbound variables are finite sequences of variables thought to range\nover functionals of a finite type determined by the type of the\nvariable. Intuitively, y is a concrete analogue of\nthe abstract notion of a construction constituting the meaning of\nF.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is as follows:\n\nTheorem 13.\n\nSuppose F\u2032 =\n\u2203y\u2200zA(y,\nz, x). If F is provable in\nintuitionistic first order arithmetic, then there are computable\nfunctionals Q of finite type such that\nA(Q(x), z,\nx) is provable in T.\n\n\nThe proof is by induction on the structure of the proof of F\nin intuitionistic first order arithmetic. (For a treatment of the\nproof in detail, the reader is referred to Troelstra 1986.)\n\nThe importance of the theorem for foundations cannot be\n overstated.[21]\n A discussion of its generalizations, of ensuing work on functional\ninterpretations stimulated by the theorem due to Kreisel, Tait,\nHoward, Feferman and others; its foundational and philosophical\nsignificance; and finally its relation particularly to the earlier,\ninformal, proof interpretation, so-called, given by\nHeyting-Kolmogorov, will not be attempted here. Accordingly the reader\nis referred to the large literature on the subject, e.g., the\nabovementioned Troelstra 1986, Tait 1967, Feferman 1993 and Avigad\n& Feferman 1998. For interesting recent developments, e.g., in the\narea of relating G\u00f6del\u2019s Dialectica interpretation and\nKreisel\u2019s modified realizability, see Oliva 2006. See also van\nOosten 2008.\n\nA remark concerning the philosophical context in which G\u00f6del\npresented his translation, namely finitism. The question addressed in\nthe introduction to the paper is what abstract notions must\nbe added to finitary mathematics in order to obtain a consistency\nproof for arithmetic. Equivalently: what does the finitary view\npresuppose, which must be given up in the light of the Second\nIncompleteness Theorem, if the consistency proof is to be\nobtained:\n\nIn any case Bernays\u2019 remark teaches us to distinguish two\ncomponents of the finitary attitude; namely, first, the constructive\nelement, which consists in our being allowed to speak of mathematical\nobjects only insofar as we can exhibit them or actually produce them\nby means of a construction; second, the specifically finitistic\nelement, which makes the further demand that the objects about which\nwe make statements, with which the constructions are carried out and\nwhich we obtain by means of these constructions, are\n\u2018intuitive\u2019, that is, are in the last analysis\nspatiotemporal arrangements of elements whose characteristics other\nthan their identity or nonidentity are irrelevant.\u2026 It is the\nsecond requirement that must be dropped. This fact has hitherto been\ntaken into account by our adjoining to finitary mathematics parts of\nintuitionistic logic and the theory of ordinals. In what follows we\nshall show that, for the consistency proof of number theory, we can\nuse, instead, the notion of computable function of finite type on the\nnatural numbers and certain rather elementary principles of\nconstruction for such functions. (G\u00f6del 1990, p.245).\n\n\nAside from its technical contribution, then, G\u00f6del\u2019s\n1958/72 is one of G\u00f6del\u2019s most important philosophical\nworks; notable for its analysis of the nature of finitary mathematics,\nas well as its analysis of the notions of \u201cintuitive,\u201d as\nin \u201cintuitive knowledge,\u201d and that of abstract versus\nconcrete evidence.\n\nIn the next section, we turn to G\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical\nviews. But interested readers may wish to read a brief discussion\nabout G\u00f6del\u2019s Nachlass, important source of philosophical\nmaterial by G\u00f6del:\n\nSupplement Document: G\u00f6del\u2019s Documents\n\n3. G\u00f6del\u2019s Philosophical Views\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views can be broadly characterized by\ntwo points of focus, or, in modern parlance, commitments. These are:\nrealism, namely the belief that mathematics is a descriptive science\nin the way that the empirical sciences are. The second commitment is\nto a form of Leibnizian rationalism in philosophy; and in fact\nG\u00f6del\u2019s principal philosophical influences, in this regard\nparticularly but also many others, were Leibniz, Kant and Husserl.\n(For further discussion of how these philosophers influenced\nG\u00f6del, see van Atten and Kennedy 2003.)\n\nThe terms \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s realism\u201d and\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism\u201d must be prefaced with a\ndisclaimer: there is no single view one could associate with each of\nthese terms. G\u00f6del\u2019s realism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, in both the nature of its ontological claims as\nwell as in G\u00f6del\u2019s level of commitment to those claims.\nSimilarly G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, from a tentative version of it at the\nbeginning, to what was adjudged to be a fairly strong version of it in\nthe 1950s. Around 1959 and for some time afterward G\u00f6del fused\nhis rationalistic program of developing exact philosophy with the\nphenomenological method as developed by Husserl.\n\nWe examine these two strains of G\u00f6del\u2019s thinking below:\n3.1 G\u00f6del\u2019s Rationalism\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism has its roots in the Leibnizian thought\nthat the world, not that which we immanently experience but that which\nitself gives rise to immanent experience, is perfect and beautiful,\nand therefore rational and ordered. G\u00f6del\u2019s justification\nof this belief rests partly on an inductive generalization from the\nperfection and beauty of mathematics:\n\nRationalism is connected with Platonism because it is directed to the\nconceptual aspect rather than toward the (real) world. One uses\ninductive evidence\u2026Mathematics has a form of\nperfection\u2026We may expect that the conceptual world is perfect,\nand, furthermore, that objective reality is beautiful, good, and\nperfect. (Wang 1996, 9.4.18)\n\n\nOur total reality and total experience are beautiful and\nmeaningful\u2014this is also a Leibnizian thought. We should judge\nreality by the little which we truly know of it. Since that part which\nconceptually we know fully turns out to be so beautiful, the real\nworld of which we know so little should also be beautiful.\n(9.4.20)\n\n\nAlthough the roots of G\u00f6del\u2019s belief in rationalism are\nmetaphysical in nature, his long-standing aspirations in that domain\nhad always been practical ones. Namely, to develop exact methods in\nphilosophy; to transform it into an exact science, or strenge\nWissenschaft, to use Husserl\u2019s term.\n\nWhat this means in practice is taking the strictest view possible of\nwhat constitutes the dialectical grounds for the acceptance\nof an assertion; put another way, a level of rigor is aspired to in\nphilosophical arguments approaching that which is found in\nmathematical proofs. A formulation of the view\u2014one which is\nsomewhat phenomenologically colored (see below)\u2014can be found in\na document in the G\u00f6del Nachlass. This is a fourteen item list\nG\u00f6del drew up in about 1960, entitled \u201cMy Philosophical\nViewpoint.\u201d Two items on the list are relevant here:\n\nThere are systematic methods for the solution of all problems\n(also art, etc.).\n\n\nThere is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals\nwith concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most\nhighly fruitful for science.\n\n\n(The list was transcribed by Cheryl Dawson and was published in\nWang 1996, p. 316.)\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s earlier conception of rationalism refers to\nmathematical rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof,\nand is therefore in some sense a more radical one than that to which\nhe would later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of the\nGibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism are\ngiven:\n\nOf course I do not claim that the foregoing considerations amount to a\nreal proof of this view about the nature of mathematics. The most I\ncould assert would be to have disproved the nominalistic view, which\nconsiders mathematics to consist solely in syntactical conventions and\ntheir consequences. Moreover, I have adduced some strong arguments\nagainst the more general view that mathematics is our own creation.\nThere are, however, other alternatives to Platonism, in particular\npsychologism and Aristotelian realism. In order to establish Platonic\nrealism, these theories would have to be disproved one after the\nother, and then it would have to be shown that they exhaust all\npossibilities. I am not in a position to do this now; however I would\nlike to give some indications along these lines. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n321\u20132).\n\n\n(For a penetrating analysis of this passage see Tait 2001.) Such an\nanalysis must be based on conceptual analysis:\n\nI am under the impression that after sufficient clarification of the\nconcepts in question it will be possible to conduct these discussions\nwith mathematical rigour and that the result will then be\u2026that\nthe Platonistic view is the only one tenable. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n322).\n\n\nAlong with the methodological component, as can be seen from the items\non G\u00f6del\u2019s list, there was also an \u201coptimistic\u201d\ncomponent to G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism: once the appropriate\nmethods have been developed, philosophical problems such as, for\nexample, those in ethics (e.g., item 9 on the list is: \u201cFormal\nrights comprise a real science.\u201d) can be decisively solved. As\nfor mathematical assertions, such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set\ntheory, once conceptual analysis has been carried out in the right\nway, that is, once the basic concepts, such as that of\n\u201cset,\u201d have been completely clarified, the Continuum\nHypothesis should be able to be decided.\n\nAlthough at the time of the Gibbs lecture the analogy in\nG\u00f6del\u2019s mind between philosophical and mathematical\nreasoning may have been a very close one, G\u00f6del\u2019s view at\nother periods was that the envisaged methods will not be mathematical\nin nature. What was wanted was a general, informal science of\nconceptual analysis.\n\nPhilosophy is more general than science. Already the theory of\nconcepts is more general than mathematics\u2026True philosophy is\nprecise but not specialized.\n\n\nPerhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics (and there\nare so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself to the\next[ensional]\u2014thence also the feeling of disappointment in the\ncase of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation\naltogether. (Wang 1996, 9.3.20,\n 9.3.21)[22]\n\n\n(See notebook Max IV, p. 198 (G\u00f6del Nachla\u00df, Firestone\nLibrary, Princeton, item 030090). Transcription Cheryl Dawson;\ntranslation from the German ours; amendment ours. G\u00f6del\u2019s\ndating of Max IV indicates that it is from May 1941 to April 1942. See\nalso G\u00f6del\u2019s letter to Bernays, G\u00f6del 2003a, p.\n283.)\n\nAn important source for understanding G\u00f6del\u2019s advance\ntoward a general theory of concepts are G\u00f6del\u2019s remarks on\nconceptual analysis published by Hao Wang in Logical Journey.\nIn remark 8.6.10 for example, G\u00f6del expresses the belief that\nextensionality fails for concepts, contrary to what he said in his\n1944 \u201cRussell\u2019s Mathematical Logic,\u201d a remark which\nhe now wishes to retract:\n\nI do not (no longer) believe that generally sameness of range is\nsufficient to exclude the distinctness of two concepts.\n\n\nIn some of G\u00f6del\u2019s later discussions another component of\nconceptual analysis emerges, namely the project of finding the\nso-called primitive terms or concepts, and their relations. These are\nroughly terms or concepts which comprise a theoretical \u201cstarting\npoint,\u201d on the basis of their meaning being completely definite\nand clear. For example, the concept of \u201cthe application of a\nconcept to another concept\u201d is a primitive term, along with\n\u201cforce\u201d. (Wang 1996, 9.1.29).\n\nHe spoke to Wang about the general project in 1972:\n\nPhenomenology is not the only approach. Another approach is to find a\nlist of the main categories (e.g., causation, substance, action) and\ntheir interrelations, which, however, are to be arrived at\nphenomenologically. The task must be done in the right manner. (Wang\n1996, 5.3.7).\n\n\nG\u00f6del spoke with Sue Toledo between 1972 and 1975 about the\nproject of finding primitive terms, as well as other aspects of\nphenomenology. See Toledo 2011. We discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s\ninvolvement with phenomenology further in the supplementary document\n G\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology.\n\nThe judgement levied upon G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism by\ncontemporary philosophers was a harsh one. (See for example G\u00f6del\n1995, pp. 303\u20134). Nevertheless G\u00f6del himself remained\noptimistic. As he commented to Wang:\n\nIt is not appropriate to say that philosophy as rigorous science is\nnot realizable in the foreseeable future. Time is not the main factor;\nit can happen anytime when the right idea appears. (Wang 1996,\n4.3.14).\n\n\nG\u00f6del concluded his 1944 on a similarly optimistic note.\n3.2 G\u00f6del\u2019s Realism\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s realist views were formulated mostly in the context\nof the foundations of mathematics and set theory.\n\nWe referred above the list \u201cWhat I believe,\u201d thought to\nhave been written in 1960 or thereabouts. Out of 14 items, only two\nrefer to realism, remarks 10 and 12:\n\nMaterialism is false.\n\n\nConcepts have an objective existence.\n\n\nG\u00f6del published his views on realism for the first time in his\n1944. The following is one of his most quoted passages on the\nsubject:\n\n\nClasses and concepts may, however, also be conceived as real objects,\nnamely classes as \u201cpluralities of things,\u201d or as\nstructures consisting of a plurality of things and concepts as the\nproperties and relations of things existing independently of our\ndefinitions and constructions.\n\nIt seems to me that the assumption of such objects is quite as\nlegitimate as the assumption of physical bodies and there is quite as\nmuch reason to believe in their existence. They are in the same sense\nnecessary to obtain a satisfactory system of mathematics as physical\nbodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense\nperceptions and in both cases it is impossible to interpret the\npropositions one wants to assert about these entities as propositions\nabout the \u201cdata,\u201d i.e., in the latter case the actually\noccurring sense perceptions.\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s reference to the impossibility of interpreting\nempirical laws, or more precisely, instantiations of them\u2014the\nstatements \u201cone wants to assert,\u201d\u2014as statements\nabout sense perceptions, is likely an endorsement of the (then)\ncontemporary critique of phenomenalism. The critique was based on the\nobservation that sense data are so inextricably bound up with the\nconditions under which they are experienced, that no correspondence\nbetween statements about those and the statements \u201cwe want to\nassert\u201d can be given (see Chisholm 1948 for example). More\ngenerally G\u00f6del was against verificationism, namely the idea that\nthe meaning of a statement is its mode of verification.\n\nThe analogical point in the first part of the passage was amplified by\nG\u00f6del in the draft manuscript \u201cIs Mathematics a Syntax of\nLanguage?\u201d:\n\nIt is arbitrary to consider \u201cThis is red\u201d an immediate\ndatum, but not so to consider the proposition expressing modus ponens\nor complete induction (or perhaps some simpler propositions from which\nthe latter follows). (G\u00f6del 1995, p. 359)\n\n\nSome writers have interpreted G\u00f6del in this and similar passages\npragmatically, attributing to him the view that because empirical\nstatements are paradigmatic of successful reference, reference in the\ncase of abstract concepts should be modelled causally. (See Maddy\n1990.) Interpreting reference to abstract objects this way,\nit is argued, addresses the main difficulty associated with realism,\nthe problem how we can come to have knowledge of abstract objects.\nOthers have argued that G\u00f6del had no paradigm case in mind; that\nfor him both the empirical and the abstract case are either equally\nproblematic, or equally unproblematic. (See Tait 1986.) The latter\nview is referred to as epistemological parity in van Atten and Kennedy\n2003. (See also Kennedy and van Atten 2004.)\n\nIn his 1947 \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s Continuum Problem?\u201d,\nG\u00f6del expounds the view that in the case of meaningful\npropositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to\nbe decided in a yes or no fashion. This is a direct consequence of\nrealism, for if there exists a domain of mathematical objects or\nconcepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be\neither true or\n false.[23]\n The Continuum Hypothesis is G\u00f6del\u2019s example of a\nmeaningful question. The concept \u201chow many\u201d leads\n\u201cunambiguously\u201d to a definite meaning of the hypothesis,\nand therefore it should be decidable\u2014at least in principle. Most\nstrikingly G\u00f6del does not leave the matter there but goes on to\noffer a practical strategy for determining the value of the continuum,\nas well as the truth value of other axioms extending ZFC.\nSpecifically, he offers two criteria for their decidability: the first\ninvolves conceptual analysis and is associated with G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalistic program. (See the above section on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalism.) Secondly one must keep an eye on the so-called success\nof the axiom, as a check or indicator of which direction to look to\nfor the solution of its truth. For example, G\u00f6del notes in the\npaper that none of the consequences of the Axiom of Constructibility\nare very plausible. It is, then, likely false. See Maddy 2011 and\nKoellner 2014 for discussion of intrinsic vs extrinsic justifications\nfor new axioms of set theory.\n\nFor further discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views see\nthe supplementary documents:\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology\n\n\nand\n\nA Philosophical Argument About the Content of Mathematics\n",
