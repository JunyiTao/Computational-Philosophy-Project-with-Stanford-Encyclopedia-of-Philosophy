How Consequentializing Differs from Other Attempts to Reconcile Utilitarianism with Common Moral Opinion\n\nThere are at least two ways of trying to modify utilitarianism in the\nhopes of reconciling some portion of it with common moral opinion. One\nway is to keep its act-consequentialism but trade in its simplistic\nranking of outcomes for a more sophisticated one. Consider, then, that\nutilitarianism (which, recall, is short for \u201cBenthamite\nutilitarianism\u201d) ranks outcomes according to quantitative\nhedonism: the view that the only things that ultimately matter in\nranking outcomes are the intensities and durations of the pleasures\nand pains that they contain. Yet, it seems that many more things\nmatter, including whether those outcomes are ones in which we violate\npeople\u2019s rights or affect the quality\u2014and not just the\nquantity\u2014of their pleasures and pains. And this has led to\ntheories such as rights consequentialism (Sen 1982) and\nqualitative utilitarianism (Mill 1861), respectively. The\nother is to keep utilitarianism\u2019s quantitative hedonism but\ntrade in its act-consequentialism. For instance, whereas Bentham held\nthat we should evaluate acts in terms of their own utilities, we could\ninstead evaluate actions in terms of whether they accord with the code\nof rules that, if accepted by the vast majority of everyone\neverywhere, would produce more hedonic utility than the vast majority\nof everyone everywhere accepting some alternative code. And this has\nled to theories such as rule-utilitarianism. (Perhaps, there\u2019s\neven a third way: holding that the outcomes that are to be ranked are\nto be individuated not only metaphysically but also presentationally,\nsuch that they themselves can be agent-relative\u2014see N. R. Howard\n2022.)\n\nOf course, these different ways of trying to reconcile some portion of\nutilitarianism with common moral opinion are not mutually exclusive.\nBrad Hooker\u2019s (2000) rule-consequentialism not only trades in\nutilitarianism\u2019s act-consequentialism for rule-consequentialism\nbut also trades in its simplistic ranking of outcomes for one that\nadmits that other things besides pleasures and pains matter in the\nranking of outcomes. The result is a moral theory that is very close\nto commonsense morality in its deontic verdicts.\n\nBut although there may be more than one way of reconciling some\nportion of utilitarianism with common moral opinion,\nconsequentializing involves doing so by revising its method of ranking\noutcomes while keeping its act-consequentialism intact. This is\nbecause many (including non-consequentialists) believe that when we\nmove away from utilitarianism\u2019s act-consequentialism, we give up\nthe very thing that we found most compelling about it in the first\nplace. For, as Philippa Foot has argued, utilitarianism\u2019s\n\n\n[act-]consequentialist element is one of the main reasons why\nutilitarianism seems so compelling\n\n\nas well as the main reason why\n\n\nthe move to rule utilitarianism seems to be an unsatisfactory answer\nto the problem of reconciling utilitarianism with common moral\nopinion.
