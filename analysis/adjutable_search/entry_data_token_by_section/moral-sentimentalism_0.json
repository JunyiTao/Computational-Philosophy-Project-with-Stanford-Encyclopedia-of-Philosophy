    "main_text": "The Many Moral Sentimentalisms\n1. The Many Moral Sentimentalisms\n\nConsider the following story related by Frans de Waal:\n\n\nJ. lives in a small seaside town in France, where he is known as the\nhandyman he is. He can build an entire house with his own hands, as he\nis skilled in carpentry, plumbing, masonry, roof work, and so on.\n[\u2026] Being extremely nice, J. usually dispenses advice or lends\na helping hand. One neighbor, whom he barely knew, kept asking about\nhow to put a skylight in his roof. [\u2026]\n\nJ. spent from morning until late evening with the neighbor, basically\ndoing the job on his own (as the neighbor could barely hold a hammer,\nhe said), during which time the neighbor\u2019s wife came, cooked,\nand ate lunch (the main meal in France) with her husband without\noffering J. anything. By the end of the day, he had successfully put\nthe skylight in, having provided expert labor that normally would have\ncost more than six hundred euros. J. asked for nothing, but when the\nsame neighbor a few days later talked about a scuba diving course, and\nhow it would be fun to do together, he felt this opened a perfect\noccasion for a return gift, since the course cost about 150 euros. So\nJ. said he\u2019d love to go, but unfortunately didn\u2019t have the\nmoney in his budget. By now you can guess: The man went alone. (de\nWaal 2009: 174\u2013175)\n\n\nIf we assume the story is true and leaves nothing of importance out,\nwe\u2019re likely to have two kinds of response to it: we have a\nnegative feeling of some sort towards the neighbour, and we think that\nthe neighbour acted wrongly towards poor J. Roughly speaking,\nsentimentalists think that these two responses are intimately related,\nwith the feeling in the driving seat. Since different theories in the\nsentimentalist family make use of different responses, this entry will\nadopt a liberal definition of a \u2018sentiment\u2019 that includes\nnon-cognitive attitudes and states of all kinds \u2013 emotions,\nfeelings, affects, desires, plans, and dispositions to have them.\n\nThis core idea gives rise to many questions. One is explanatory: Why\ndo we think that the neighbour did something wrong? Explanatory\nsentimentalists believe that moral thoughts are fundamentally\nexplained by sentiments or emotions. The second kind of question is\nconstitutive: What does our thought that the neighbour did something\nwrong consist in? That is, what kind of thought is it? Is it more like\nbelieving that Pluto is a planet or like wanting to hit an\nuncooperative computer? Judgment sentimentalists believe that\nmoral judgments are constituted by emotional or non-cognitive\nresponses, at least in part, or alternatively are judgments\nabout emotional responses or the tendency of something to\ngive rise to them. Some judgment sentimentalists are also\nexpressivists, who believe that the meanings of moral terms\nmust be accounted for in terms of associated non-cognitive states.\n\nThird, assuming that we\u2019ve got it right, what kind of fact if\nany makes our thought that the neighbour acted wrongly true? Is the\nwrongness of the action a projection of our sentiments? If it is a\nfact, is it like the fact that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum\nof the squares of the other two sides of a right triangle, or like the\nfact that water is H2O, or perhaps more like the fact that\nrotten food is disgusting? For metaphysical sentimentalists,\nmoral facts have to do with our sentimental responses, or moral and\nevaluative concepts are concepts of properties of causing or\nwarranting sentimental responses. Finally, we\u2019re pretty\nconfident of our judgment. But even if we assume we know all the\npertinent empirical facts, how do we know that what the neighbour did\nis wrong? What if someone disagrees? How can we justify our verdict?\nEpistemic sentimentalists believe that sentimental responses\nof a suitable kind play a central role in moral justification or\nunderstanding.\n\nThese sentimentalist views are logically independent of each other.\nOne indication of this is that they contrast with different views.\nEpistemic and possibly explanatory sentimentalist views contrast with\nrationalist and intuitionist views, according to\nwhich we can acquire moral knowledge by reasoning or intuition,\nrespectively, rather than via emotion. Some, though not all, judgment\nsentimentalist views contrast with cognitivist accounts\nof moral judgment. Metaphysical sentimentalist views, in turn,\ncontrast with error theory and mind-independent moral\nrealism in naturalist and non-naturalist variants.\n",
