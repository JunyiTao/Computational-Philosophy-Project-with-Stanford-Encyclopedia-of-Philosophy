    "main_text": "Falaquera as an exegete\n6. Falaquera as an exegete\n\n\nFalaquera in his various writings shows great familiarity with the\nBible and rabbinic literature. It is possible to understand quite a\nbit from these books on how Falaquera read the Bible. In general,\nFalaquera repeatedly states that he views the Torah as a source of\ntruth, and that its teachings are in accord with the true teachings of\nphilosophy and science for which there are demonstrative proofs. In\nother words, if the Torah seems to contradict something that has been\nproven demonstratively, the passage in the Torah needs to be\ninterpreted.  Indeed, for Falaquera, philosophy is at times necessary\nfor the correct interpretation of Scripture. The correct\ninterpretation of it is not always apparent, but philosophy can help\nus to uncover it. Moreover, for Falaquera, Scripture is replete with\nscientific teachings and allusions (Iggeret ha-Vikkuah,\n69\u201371; trans., 34\u201337). On the other hand, he never tires of\nreiterating in almost all his works that if a statement of the\nphilosophers contradicts something from the Torah, we reject it. A\nclose examination of Falaquera\u2019s proof texts in his various writings\nreveals his methods of Biblical interpretation. For example, the\nallegorical interpretation of Prov.  27:26 and Song of Songs 4:11 as\nreferring to the need to conceal certain profound matters from the\nmany (Iggeret ha-Vikkuah, 74; trans., 42); or the reading of\nJer. 9:22 as referring to man\u2019s confusing the pseudo-perfections for\nthe true one (Reshit Hokhmah, 72); or the understanding of\nProv. 25:5 as teaching that man needs divine help in order to attain\nthe truth (Iggeret ha-Halom, 488); or simply taking\nPs. 31:20, 27:13, and 69:29 to each be referring to man\u2019s eternal life\n(Sefer ha-Ma\u2018alot, 15).\n\n\nA clearer picture of Falaquera as an exegete may be drawn from the\nrecent editions and translations of extant passages from his lost\ncommentaries on the Bible (Jospe, Torah and Sophia,\n468\u2013484, and Jospe and Schwartz, \u201cFalaquera\u2019s Lost Bible\nCommentary,\u201d 186\u2013200).\n\n\nHere one can see Falaquera\u2019s focus on understanding the meaning of\ncertain equivocal terms in Scripture; on explicating certain ambiguous\nterms; on providing scientific explanations of certain terms; on\npointing out that certain verses must be taken metaphorically; and on\nsuggesting the inner meaning (\u2018inyan penimi) when\nappropriate. At times Falaquera strove to understand and explain the\nliteral meaning of the verse, while at other times he sought to\nuncover its allegorical interpretation and secret meaning.\n",
