    "main_text": "Objections to Mathematical Platonism || Epistemological access\n3.1 Epistemological access\n\nThe most influential objection is probably the one inspired by\nBenacerraf (1973). What follows is an improved version of\nBenacerraf\u2019s objection due to Field\n (1989).[12]\n This version relies on the following three premises.\n\n\nPremise 1.\nMathematicians are reliable, in the sense that for almost every\nmathematical sentence \\(S\\), if mathematicians accept \\(S\\), then\n\\(S\\) is true. \n\nPremise 2.\nFor belief in mathematics to be justified, it must at least in\nprinciple be possible to explain the reliability described in Premise\n1. \n\nPremise 3.\nIf mathematical platonism is true, then this reliability cannot\nbe explained even in principle. \n\n\nIf these three premises are correct, it will follow that mathematical\nplatonism undercuts our justification for believing in\nmathematics.\n\nBut are the premises correct? The first two premises are relatively\nuncontroversial. Most platonists are already committed to Premise 1.\nAnd Premise 2 seems fairly secure. If the reliability of some belief\nformation procedure could not even in principle be explained, then the\nprocedure would seem to work purely by chance, thus undercutting any\njustification we have for the beliefs produced in this way.\n\nPremise 3 is far more controversial. Field defends this premise by\nobserving that \u201cthe truth-values of our mathematical assertions\ndepend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm\noutside of space-time\u201d (Field 1989, p. 68) and thus are causally\nisolated from us even in principle. However, this defense assumes that\nany adequate explanation of the reliability in question must involve\nsome causal correlation. This has been challenged by a variety of\nphilosophers who have proposed more minimal explanations of the\nreliability claim. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 41\u201349 and\nLewis 1991, pp. 111\u2013112; cf. also Clarke-Doane 2016. See Linnebo\n2006 for a\n critique.)[13]\n",
