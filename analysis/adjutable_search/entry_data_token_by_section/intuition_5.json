    "main_text": "The Epistemological Role of Intuitions || Philosophical and Non-Philosophical Uses of Intuitions\n2.1 Philosophical and Non-Philosophical Uses of Intuitions\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71,\n the focus of the present entry is the role of intuitions in\nphilosophy. It is as accounts of such intuitions that the accounts\nabove were evaluated. Hence, in what follows, it will be assumed that\nthe appropriate account of the states at issue is some relatively\nrestrictive version of the sui generis state account\n (\u00a71.3).\n Such an assumption is not, however, essential to much of what\nfollows.\n\nIn light of the discussion of\n \u00a71,\n some of the states which are included in more expansive accounts of\nintuition might be better taken to be perceptual seemings or\nexperiences of the sort endorsed by those who claim we have perceptual\nseemings or experiences with complex propositional content. In this\nconnection, it is worth considering the views of various theorists who\nhold that perceptual experience can basically represent, and present\nto a subject, propositions featuring sophisticated properties well\nbeyond phenomenological ones (Siegel 2010). On this kind of view,\nthose with suitable training might have a perceptual experience that a\nchild is ill or that a fire will soon engulf a room in the way that a\nnon-expert has a perceptual experience that they are presented with\nsomething red. The epistemology of such propositional perceptual\nstates (if they exist) must be addressed elsewhere.\n",
