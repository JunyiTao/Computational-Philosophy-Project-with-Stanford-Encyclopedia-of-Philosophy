    "main_text": "The Text of the Book of Changes || Symbols\n1.3 Symbols\n\nDespite warning of hubris and human wickedness, the\nXici\u2019s authors also assure readers that if they learn\nto read hexagrams properly, they will discern the pattern behind\nincessant changes. They write:\n\n\nThe Changes is a book from which one may not hold aloof. Its\ndao [i.e., pattern] is forever changing\u2014alternating,\nmovement without rest, flowing through the six empty places [of a\nhexagram]; rising and sinking without fixed law, firm and yielding\ntransform each other. They cannot be confined within a rule; it is\nonly change that is at work here. They move inward and outward\naccording to fixed rhythms. Without and within, they teach caution.\nThey also show care and sorrow and their causes. Though you have no\nteacher, approach them as you would your parents. (Xici II:\n7; WB67: 348\u201349, with modifications)\n\n\nSeen in this light, the 64 hexagrams are no longer oracles. They\nbecome symbols of the constant movements in the universe and the\nceaseless changes in one\u2019s life. More significantly, they point\nto the intricate networks of factors or forces\u2014from near to far\naway, from simple to complicated, from visible to invisible\u2014that\nshape the movements and changes around us.\n\nYet, while scholars of Changes generally agree that trigrams\nand hexagrams are symbols of the cosmic group dance, there is no\nconsensus as to how they understand symbolic and verbal\nrepresentation. Do they view visual and verbal symbols as realistic\nrepresentation of the dynamic unfolding of the universe? Or do they\nview visual and verbal symbols as selective depictions of the outside\nworld?\n\nThe former is a version of the \u201ccopy theory of\nrepresentation\u201d where symbols are tools, accurately and\nrealistically copying the outside world for our perusal. It assumes\nthat there is an objective world out there, and we develop tools to\ncopy it. And the effectiveness of the tools is determined by how\nrealistically they are in capturing the objective reality. The latter\nsmacks of Ernst Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of symbolic forms where\nsymbols are schemas, conceptually and homologically classifying the\noutside world to support our images of the world. It assumes that the\nuniverse is far more complex and complicated than humans can\napprehend, and therefore, the best humans can do is developing tools\nto give them a sense of the universe. Thus, the tools created are\npartly subjective and partly objective. They are subjective in the\nsense that they are man-made and limited by human cognitive and\nemotive capabilities. They are objective in the sense that they\nprovide an image of the world, allowing humans to function in daily\nlife.\n\nIn the Xici, we find passages that support the copy theory of\nrepresentation. The clearest example is the story of Bao Xi (Pao Hsi\n\u5305\u72a7, another name for Fu Xi \u4f0f\u7fb2) in Part 2,\n2:1. In that passage, Bao Xi reportedly created a system of signs\nafter observing the meteorological patterns in the sky and the\ngeographical patterns on the ground. This story goes like this:\n\n\nWhen in early antiquity Bao Xi ruled the world, he looked upward and\ncontemplated the images in heavens; he looked downward and\ncontemplated the patterns on earth. He contemplated the markings of\nbirds and beasts and the adaptations to the regions. He proceeded\ndirectly from himself and indirectly from objects. Thus he invented\nthe eight trigrams in order to enter into connection with the virtues\nof the light of the gods and to regulate the conditions of all beings.\nHe made knotted cords and used them for nets and baskets in hunting\nand fishing. He probably took this from the hexagram of THE CLINGING\n(\u201cLi\u201d). (Xici II: 2; WB67: 328\u2013329 with\nmodifications)\n\n\nTo some scholars, this story not only explains the creation of\ntrigrams and hexagrams but also proves that the graphic symbols are\nrealistic representation of the world. They point out that the two key\nterms in the Bao Xi story\u2014contemplation (guan \u89c0)\nand proceeding [from what is close to us to what is far beyond]\n(qu \u53d6)\u2014denote an active quest for empirical\nknowledge through careful observation and rational deduction that\nleads to a factual understanding of the workings of the universe.\n\nFurthermore, the Bao Xi story continues after his death. We are told\nthat another mythical figure, the Divine Husbandman (shennong\n\u795e\u8fb2) drew inspiration from the hexagram Yi\n\u76ca (Increase #42) and used his knowledge to teach people\nfarming. He also drew lessons from the hexagram Shihe\n\u566c\u55d1 (Biting Through, #21) to teach people how to exchange\ngoods to improve their lives. After the Divine Husbandman, Yellow\nEmperor, Shao and Shun continued to draw inspirations from a long list\nof hexagrams. They used their knowledge to teach people to improve\ntheir living conditions, including farming, government, and housing.\nThe experiences of all these mythical figures show that the trigrams\nand hexagrams are realistic representations of the empirical world.\nLike a Google Map or a satellite image in our times, the trigrams and\nhexagrams help the mythical figures navigate the complex reality and\nachieve what they want in everyday life.\n\nHowever, this \u201ccopy theory of representation\u201d only appears\nin a small number of passages in the Xici. Most of the other\npassages remind us of Ernst Cassirer\u2019s subjective use of\nsymbols. Take, for instance, Xici I: 2 in which we find a\ndifferent perspective of the creation of symbols.\n\n\nThe holy sages instituted the hexagrams, so that phenomena might be\nperceived therein. They appended the judgments, in order to indicate\ngood fortune and misfortune. As the firm and the yielding lines\ndisplace one another, change and transformation arise. Therefore good\nfortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss; remorse and\nhumiliation are the images of sorrow and forethought. (Xici\nPart I: 2; WB67: 287\u2013288)\n\n\nHere, the creation of trigrams and hexagrams is described as a\ndeliberate act of representing the world. We are told that the holy\nsages \u201cinstituted\u201d (she \u8a2d) the hexagrams\nand \u201cappended\u201d (xi \u7e4b) the Xici.\nIn both cases, the creation of knowledge is understood as a calculated\nact to convey a particular view of the empirical world. More\nimportantly, in the last line of the quoted paragraph, the authors of\nXici clearly explain the goal of this production of\nknowledge. They see the system of signs as a tool to help readers\nmaximize fortune, minimize misfortune, assuage remorse, and avoid\nhumiliation. In other words, the system of signs is intended to assist\nreaders to make decisions to improve their lives, rather than to mimic\nrealities of the world.\n\nIn another passage, this deliberate act of representation is even more\nexplicit. In Xici I:12, we find a soliloquy of the Master\n(presumably Confucius) who questions the efficacy of words and images\nin conveying reality:\n\n\nThe Master said: Writing cannot express words completely. Words cannot\nexpress thoughts completely. Are we then unable to see the thoughts of\nthe holy sages?\n\nThe Master said: The holy sages set up the images in order to express\ntheir thoughts completely; they devised the hexagrams in order to\nexpress the true and the false completely. Then they appended\njudgements and so could express their words completely. (Xici\nI:12; WB67: 322)\n\n\nThrough the Master, the authors of Xici assert that the\ntrigrams and hexagrams express the thoughts of their creators and not\nreflect the reality of the outside world. Similarly, the hexagram\nstatements (or Judgments) are not summaries of empirical facts but\nsuggestions of taking appropriate actions to solve pressing problems\nin life.\n\nTo followers of Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of symbolic forms, the\nargument in Xici is music to their ears. In his influential\narticle, \u201cGeist and Life\u201d, Cassirer describes human\nexistence as a constant battle between the vicissitudes of life (Life)\nand the symbols that are deployed to make sense of our surroundings\n(Form). While the former is \u201cobjective\u201d, involving\nempirical data and concrete facts in the tangible world, the latter is\n\u201csubjective\u201d, based on artificial schemas that presents a\npicture of external reality to the perceivers. For Cassirer, it is\nthis tension between what is external and internal, factual and\nrepresentational, objective and subjective, and realistic and\nidealistic, that characterizes creativity in human existence. In this\ncontinuum between Life and Form, and necessity and freedom, Cassirer\nurges us to develop our \u201cWill to Formation\u201d to align our\nunderstanding of the world with our system of symbols (Ernest Cassirer\n1930 [1996:15\u201318]). To him, developing the \u201cWill to\nFormation\u201d is more important than developing the \u201cWill to\nPower\u201d, as Nietzsche suggests, because it helps us come to terms\nwith the plurality, ambiguity, and conflicts in our lives (Cassirer\n1930 [1996: 29\u201333]).\n\nWhile in principle the authors of Xici may accept\nCassirer\u2019s active theory of representation, they are totally\ncommitted to trigrams and hexagrams as their preferred system of\nsigns. Having invested so much in pairing trigrams and hexagrams with\nthe cosmic great dance, these authors have no intention to include\nother systems of symbols to depict the universe, such as the visual\narts, literature, or poetry, as Cassirer recommends (Cassirer 1930\n[1996: 34\u2013111]). Herein, perhaps, lies their blind spot. Their\nunwavering commitment to trigrams and hexagrams leads them to a blind\nalley where they fail to see the value of other systems of signs (such\nas the number system that appears in Xici I:8).\n",
