    "main_text": "Spinoza and the Jewish Disposition vis-\u00e0-vis the World\n5. Spinoza and the Jewish Disposition vis-\u00e0-vis the World\n\nHer first strictly philosophical essay, as Susman understood it, was\ndedicated to Spinoza, who, in her view, was modern Judaism\u2019s\n\u201conly unique personality of truly creative magnitude\u201d as\nshe had noted in \u201cJudaism and Culture\u201d in 1907 (JuK 2).\n\u201cSpinoza und das j\u00fcdische Weltgef\u00fchl\u201d\n(\u201cSpinoza and the Jewish Disposition vis-\u00e0-vis the\nWorld\u201d, 1913) appeared in the anthology Vom Judentum,\nedited by the Jewish Student Association Bar Kochba in Prague. Susman\nwas the only contributing woman author.\n\nFor Susman, Spinoza represents the \u201ctype of the pure\nmetaphysician\u201d (1913: 53) whose philosophical approach reflects\nthe basic disposition of Jewish tradition in metaphysically refined\nterms. As she reconstructs Spinoza\u2019s central metaphysical\nargument, she argues that we can only get to the heart of\nSpinoza\u2019s thought if we recognize the deeper religious\ndisposition vis-\u00e0-vis the world (Weltgef\u00fchl) that\nguides his metaphysics (1913: 57). It is precisely this deeper\nreaching disposition that informs Spinoza\u2019s thought and allows\nit to move beyond a merely rationalist outlook. In Spinoza, the\nmetaphysical God gives way to the religious God at precisely the point\nwhere the nexus of the world extends beyond the human mind. At this\npoint for the first time the world is truly connected to the human\nbeing and their action. While the purely logical nexus of the world\ndoes not allow for the transition to the living human soul, this\ntransition becomes possible for Spinoza because of the particular way\nhe conceives of immanence as the dynamics of God\u2019s internal\nforce of infinite self-love. This turn of the divine world against\nitself eventually becomes active affect (1913: 58). This point of the\nturning of the world against itself, Susman notes, is what we call\nself-consciousness, which in turn coincides with God\u2019s\nconsciousness. The soul and its form of adequate knowledge rest on\nGod\u2019s self-affection extending to the dynamics of the\nincreasing, active affect that leads to the blissful joy that relates\nsolely to God and his law. This holy joy Spinoza calls the\nintellectual love of God (1913: 59).\n\nIn Spinoza, Susman notes, love is the turning of life onto itself, and\nas such God\u2019s acting on himself. This emphatic notion of love as\nmetaphysical concept is grounded in an idea Susman attributes to\nSpinoza: that self-consciousness \u201cis nothing else than the\nknowledge of the soul in the light of eternity, the knowledge of its\nessence in God\u201d. As a result, self-consciousness \u201ccan only\nact (wirken) and thus become actual (wirklich) by\nway of love\u201d (1913: 59). As Susman observes, \u201cone of the\ntwo great forms of human love shines out here from Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem\u201d (1913: 59). This is the kind of love that does not\nsurrender like that of the mystics but is empowering and\nself-enhancing (1913: 60). Rather than subjecting the soul to a\nheteronomous rule, this form of love understands itself to be the only\nfreedom of the soul. In sharp distinction to the notion of freedom in\nKant and Fichte, Spinoza\u2019s is like Moses\u2019 legislation in\ncontrast to Prometheus\u2019 deed (1913: 60). Spinoza\u2019s notion\nof freedom does not mean liberation from the law of the world but\nrather to grasp in ever more conscious way its sway. The more we\nunderstand our actions to be merely expression of the nature of things\nthe freer we are. We are not free to know what we wish but only to\ngrasp the nexus of things by way of thinking. Our free will does not\nconsist in arbitrariness but in grasping through our actions the\ninterconnection of the divine law (1913: 61). Since all processes in\nnature occur in God, the form of inner consequence\n(M\u00fcssen) replaces the ought (Sollen), i.e., a\nform of an inner urge, or love, as the human being is oriented towards\nthe idea of things, i.e., is truly human. As Susman notes:\n\n\nTo depend on God\u2019s law is nothing else but being determined by a\ncomprehensive being, by a universal law that is at the same time\nimmanent in me. (1913: 62)\n\n\nSusman goes on to distinguish two kinds of dispositions\nvis-\u00e0-vis the world, the Jewish and the Indian, including its\nGreek Dionysian and German mystical variations, in order to situate\nSpinoza more pointedly in the Jewish tradition. While Jewish thought,\nshe argues, subordinates everything to the idea, Indo-Germanic thought\nsubordinates everything to the I. Both world views have the question\nof redemption as their point of departure and both emerge from a\nreligious foundation. The one crystalizes early on into a sharp\ndualism, the other into the first great philosophy of identity. While\nthe Indian disposition elevates the self and its quest for freedom to\nthe center of its striving, the Jewish, with God at its center,\nprivileges law, obligation, and faith as its fundamental values. For\nSusman, however, law is mediated by love bound to a you.\n\n\nFor all love arises originally from the dualist disposition\nvis-\u00e0-vis the world. The thought of mediation is\nhumanity\u2019s proper thought of love. (1913: 67)\n\n\nIts redemptive force, as Susman notes, generates the Messianic idea\n(1913: 67). With this excursus, Susman returns to Spinoza, whose\nsystem of identity appears to exclude this kind of love. Nonetheless,\nshe argues, Spinoza is as different from the Indian disposition as it\nis from Judaism. His notion of self-preservation is the very opposite\nof self-interest; instead, it is \u201crecognition of one\u2019s own\nessence in and through God\u201d (1913: 69). This form of\nself-preservation is only realized by love of God: \u201cFor I am not\nseeking myself in [this love of God] but God\u2019s law in\nmyself\u201d (1913: 69). The identity of the world is thus produced\nby love as the mediating force between the human being and God, the\ndynamic moment of divine infinity that creates the true connection\nbetween I and God (1913: 69f.).\n\nSusman\u2019s essay is a pointed intervention in the lasting\ncontroversy around the place of Spinoza in the history of philosophy\nas well as in Judaism and suggestively argues for his thought\u2019s\nenduring significance in highlighting the constitutive role love plays\nin his system. Offering a provocative way of distinguishing two\nopposed metaphysical dispositions, Susman challenges the dominant\nnarrative that yokes Western philosophy to a Greco-Christian legacy.\nShe highlights the specifically Jewish moment that informs an\nalternative tradition of metaphysical thinking and argues for an inner\ntension that pits two different religious worldviews against each\nother, a tension she will go on to present in her work as a tension\nconstitutive of the modern world.\n",
