It is a kind of Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem for second-order logic. It says that if a second-order\nsentence has a model of the cardinality of a measurable cardinal, then\nit has a smaller submodel:\n\n\nTheorem 7 (Scott 1961) Suppose \\(\\kappa\\) is a\nmeasurable cardinal. If \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence and\n\\(\\phi\\) has a model \\(\\mm\\) of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\), then for every\n\\(X\\subseteq M\\) of cardinality \\(<\\kappa\\) there is\n\\(\\mn\\subseteq\\mm\\) such that \\(X\\subseteq N\\), \\(|N|\\kappa\\), and \\(\\mn\\models\\phi\\).\n [9]\n\n\n\nA particular consequence is that the first measurable cardinal cannot\nbe second-order characterizable as a model of the empty vocabulary (a\nfact that was referred to above in\n \u00a77.1).\n Theorem 7 resembles remarkably the Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem of first order logic. The only difference is that one has to\nstart with a big model, a model of the size of a measurable cardinal.\nSmaller cardinals need not work. For example, if \\(\\lambda\\) is the\nleast weakly compact cardinal \\(>\\omega\\), then there is a sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) which has \\(\\lambda\\) (with the empty vocabulary) as a model\nbut no smaller models. The\n sentence[10]\n \\(\\phi\\) says that \\(\\lambda\\) is inaccessible (\\(>\\omega\\)) and\nthat every \\(\\lambda\\)-tree (a tree of height \\(\\lambda\\) with all\nlevels of size \\(<\\lambda\\)) has a branch of length\n\\(\\lambda\\).\n\nIf we want to obtain a Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem which\nworks for any structure, not only for structures of a measurable\ncardinality, we have to look at even bigger cardinals: The\nLST-number of second-order logic is defined to be the least\n(if any exist) \\(\\kappa\\) such that if \\(\\ma\\) is any structure and\n\\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence true in \\(\\ma\\), then there is a\nsubstructure \\(\\mb\\) of \\(\\ma\\) of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) which also satisfies \\(\\phi.\\)\n\n\nTheorem 8 (Magidor 1971) The LST-number of\nsecond-order logic exists if and only if there are supercompact\ncardinals \\(>\\omega\\) and then it is the smallest of them.\n\n\nSecond-order logic is said to satisfy strong\n\\(\\kappa\\)-compactness if every second-order theory, every\nsubset of size \\(<\\kappa\\) of which has a model, has itself a\nmodel.\n\n\nTheorem 9 (Magidor 1971) The least \\(\\kappa\\) such\nthat second-order logic satisfies the strong \\(\\kappa\\)-compactness\nis the least extendible\ncardinal.\n\n\n\n",
