Some Fundamental Principles of Leibniz's Philosophy\n\n\nLeibniz asserts in the Monadology \u00a7\u00a731\u201332,\n\u201cOur reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction\u2026 [and] that of sufficient\nreason\u201d (G II 612/AG 217). To these two great principles\ncould be added four more: the Principle of the Best, the\nPredicate-in-Notion Principle, the Principle of the Identity\nof Indiscernibles, and the Principle of Continuity. The\nrelation among these principles is more complicated than one might\nexpect. Leibniz sometimes suggests that the Principle of the Best and\nthe Predicate-in-Notion Principle can be said to ground his \u201ctwo\ngreat principles\u201d; at other times, however, all four principles\nseem to work together in a system of circular implication. And while\nthe Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles is often presented in\ncontemporary discussions in analytic metaphysics as a stand-alone axiom,\nLeibniz tells us that it follows from the two great principles.\nFinally, the Principle or Law of Continuity is actually a principle\nthat Leibniz takes from his work in mathematics and applies to the\ninfinite hierarchy of monads in the world and to the quality of their\nperceptions; it appears to derive only tenuous support from the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason.\n",
