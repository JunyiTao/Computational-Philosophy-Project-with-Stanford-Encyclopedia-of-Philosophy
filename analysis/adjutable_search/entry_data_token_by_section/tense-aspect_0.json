    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nTense roughly means reference to the time at which events\ntake place, or at which processes or states hold. English, for\nexample, clearly distinguishes between past and non-past tense as in\n(1a) and (1b) and (1c). \n1.\n\n(a)\n\nJohn promised to pay ten pounds.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nI promise to pay you ten pounds.\n      \n\n\n(c)\n\nThe student will work on his thesis.\n      \n\n\nIn English, verb forms are typically used to signal the time\nwhen an action or event occurs or a state holds. Thus in (1a), John\u2019s\npromise was given before the present time, in (1b) the promising is\nsimultaneous with the present time and (1c) says that the student\u2019s\nwork on his thesis will occur at some time after the present. It\nshould be noted that the verb forms used to express temporal\ninformation may also be used to signal information that is not purely\ntemporal. For instance, the present tense form in John walks\n\n\ncharacterizes a certain habit of John. And in the statement The\ntrain departs at five o\u2019clock tomorrow, the present verb form\nclearly has a futurate meaning. So English distinguishes between past\nand non-past but not between future and non-future. Moreover, many\nlinguists exclude future as a pure tense, because the auxiliary\nwill may be used to express volition as in He will go\nswimming in dangerous\n water.[1]\n\nApart from absolute tense\u2014exemplified by\n(1a)\u2013(1c)\u2014where the reference point from which the\nlocation in time is evaluated is the present, there is also\n\nrelative tense where the reference point is not necessarily\nthe present but may be given by context. Thus in a sentence like\nThe student had worked on his thesis the student\u2019s work took\nplace at a time before a reference point in the past, in contrast to\n(1c) where the reference point is the present. Other instances of\nrelative tense in English are the present perfect and the future\nperfect in (2a) respectively (2b). \n2.\n\n(a)\n\n\n\nI have lost my watch.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nThe student will have finished his thesis next month.\n      \n\n\nThe notion of aspect according to Comrie refers to\n\u201c[the] different ways of viewing the internal temporal\nconstituency of a situation\u201d (1976: 3). It is customary to\ndistinguish between lexical and grammatical aspect.\nThe following are examples concerning lexical aspect. Since Vendler\n(1967) linguists distinguish at least four aspectual classes. These\nare states like know, activities like run,\naccomplishments like cross the street and achievements\nexemplified by a verb like recognize. Accomplishments\ndescribe the internal temporal constituency of a situation in a more\ndetailed way than (say) activities. Crossing the street, for\nexample, includes the starting of a crossing activity which goes on\nfor some time and involves a result state that is characterized by\nbeing on the other side of the street. No such elaborate descriptions\nare necessary for activities or achievements. There are grammatical\nmeans of distinguishing between these aspectual classes. For example,\nstates and achievements cannot occur with the progressive while\nactivities and accomplishments can; more about this below in\n Section 5.\n\n\n These differences are customarily considered to be lexical\ndifferences and this area is therefore dubbed lexical aspect.\n\n\nA further crucial aspectual difference is that between perfective and\nimperfective aspect. Comrie characterizes these notions as follows.\n\n\n\n\u2026perfectivity indicates the view of the situation as a single\nwhole, without distinction of the various separate phases that make up\nthat situation, while the imperfective pays essential attention to the\ninternal structure of the situation. (Comrie 1976: 16) \n\n\nIn English this difference is often expressed by grammatical\nmeans, for instance by past tense versus past progressive. This is an\ninstance of grammatical aspect. Slavic language often have an\nelaborate grammatical system to signal the difference between\nimperfectivity (ipv) and perfectivity (pv). Here is an example from Russian. \n3\n\n(a)\n\nPetr\n\nPeter  pisal\\(_{ipv}\\)/*napisal\\(_{pv}\\)\n\nwas-writing/*wrote  pis\u2019mo,\n\nletter,  kogda\n\n\n\nwhen  on\n\nhe  byl\n\nwas  prervan\n\ninterrupted  telefonnym\n\n\nby-telephone  zvonkom.\n\n\ncall. \n\n\n\n(b)\n\nPetr\n\nPeter  *pisal\\(_{ipv}\\)/napisal\\(_{pv}\\)\n\n*was-writing/wrote   pis\u2019mo\n\nletter  i\n\n\nand   otnes\n\n\nbrought   ego\n\nit   na\n\nto   po\u010dtu.\n\n\npost-office.\n\n\n\nSentence (3b) presents the writing of a letter as a single whole and\nit is clear that this activity was finished when the letter was brought to the\npost office. By contrast, (3a) focuses on an ongoing activity of\nletter writing in the past which is not completed because of the\ninterruption. In fact it is consistent with the truth of (3a) that the\nletter was never completely written. \n\nThe natural language categories tense and aspect\n\n\nembody the linguistic encoding of time. From a typological point of\nview these categories are typical verbal\n categories.[2]\n This means that if these categories are morphologically realized in a\nlanguage then these morphemes attach to the verb. Verbs usually\nexpress events, processes, actions or\n states[3]\n and the temporal morphemes locate these eventualities in time. Of\ncourse this does not mean that languages that lack such morphemes are\nnot able to express temporal relations. They just have to choose other\nmeans for this purpose. One famous example of a language not\ncontaining temporal morphology is Mandarin Chinese. Often tense and\naspect cannot be clearly separated. For example the Quich\u00e9\nprefix \\(x-\\) denotes a completed (aspect) action in the past\n (tense).[4]\n\n\nTypologists also observed an asymmetry between past and future. Most\nlanguages that possess temporal morphology use these means to\ndifferentiate between past and non-past. There are, however, a few\nlanguages which use temporal morphology to distinguish between future\nand non-future. \n\nWe will not go into further details concerning the linguistic\nrealization of tense and aspect, but present a brief and necessarily\nincomplete review of major philosophical and semantic theories of\nthese notions. \n",
