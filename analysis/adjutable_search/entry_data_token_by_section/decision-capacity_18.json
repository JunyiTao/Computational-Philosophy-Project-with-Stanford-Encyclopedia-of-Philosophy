    "main_text": "Are We Measuring the Right Thing? || Challenging the Four Abilities Model: Values & Authenticity\n6.2 Challenging the Four Abilities Model: Values & Authenticity\n\nMany of the same theorists who invoke emotion also point to the fact\nthat the four abilities model ignores patient values (Charland 2002).\nHowever, in some cases where, intuitively, patients appear to lack\ncapacity, it is precisely their pursuit of unusual and\nself-destructive values that seems to be problematic. Addicts pursuing\ntheir drug of choice (Levy 2016) or anorexia patients pursuing extreme\nthinness are cases in point. Might there yet be a way to appeal to\nvalues in an assessment of capacity?\n\nThe adequacy of the four abilities model was challenged along these\nlines by Tan, Hope, Stewart and colleagues in a series of articles\nexploring the results of a small empirical study of patients with\nanorexia nervosa (Tan, Hope, & Stewart 2003a,b; Tan, Stewart,\nFitzpatrick, & Hope 2006a,b; Tan, Stewart, & Hope 2009). Ten\nyoung women with the illness were interviewed at length about their\nown understanding of their illness, why they pursued extreme weight\nloss, how they felt about treatment and what might lead them to refuse\ntreatment. In addition, the women were all assessed for\ndecision-making capacity using the MacCAT-T. They all scored very well\non the MacCAT-T, demonstrating high levels of understanding and\nreasoning ability, with scores basically equivalent to healthy\ncontrols (Tan, Stewart, et al. 2006a: 270). By the typical, purely\ncognitive criteria of capacity assessment, they were all (or mostly\nall, depending on how much emphasis one places on appreciation)\n competent.[3]\n Yet most of them also clearly intended to keep trying to lose weight.\nThe extremely high value they placed on being thin led them to\ndownplay other values that had once been more central to them. As they\nexplained to interviewers, thinness was more important to them than\nfamily, friends, education, work, and even life itself. In the words\nof one participant, \n\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t mind dying, I really didn\u2019t want to,\nit\u2019s just I wanted to lose weight, that was the main thing.\n(Tan, Hope, & Stewart 2003a: 702)\n\n\nIntuitively, at least for many people, these young women, diagnosed\nwith a serious mental disorder and pursuing thinness at the expense of\nhealth and life, lack the ability to make their own decisions. For\nsome theorists, indeed, such cases are paradigm cases of incapacity,\nthe kinds of cases a theory ought to be able to account for. However,\nthe cognitively focused four-abilities model cannot account for these\ncases because the young women, though pursuing self-destructive\nbehavior, are cognitively intact. Indeed, it is not uncommon for\npatients with severe anorexia to count as having capacity by the usual\ncriteria (Elzakkers et al. 2016). The only unusual thing about their\ndecisions seems to be what they decide to pursue and the\nvalues that lie behind this. Is there, then, a way to appeal to the\nvalues such patients express as part of explaining why they lack\ncapacity? The traditional understanding of value neutrality\n (\u00a75.4\n above) suggests we can\u2019t. But Tan and others (Tan, Hope, &\nStewart 2003a,b; Tan, Stewart, et al. 2006a) suggest that the key is\nto recognize that these values (unlike, for example, the unusual\nvalues of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness) are caused by the\nmental disorder itself (For a similar point in relation to addiction\nsee Charland 2002, 2011). The values in question are\n\u201cpathological values\u201d.\n\nAlthough this seems promising at first, a number of problems remain.\nTo start with, this view appeals to the idea that anorexia is the\nsource or cause of these values. Even if that were so, we would need\nto know more before we could leverage that into an explanation of\nincapacity. We need a way of explaining how these values\nundermine or are bad-for decision-making.\n\nSome critics of Tan et al. come very close to just asserting that\nsince the anorexic values in question do not undermine the usual four\nabilities, the values in question clearly should not be taken as\nevidence of incapacity (Whiting 2009). This is too simplistic,\nhowever, for it begs the question of whether there might be further\nabilities, in addition to the traditional four, that matter. However,\nit is also true that Tan et al. have not yet given a fully\nsatisfactory account. Even if the values driving decision-making are a\nproduct of mental illness, this doesn\u2019t by itself license the\nconclusion that these values are problematic. An additional link\nbetween the values in question and decision-making is needed and it is\nnot yet clear whether one can be provided.\n\nA second worry is that such an approach (one that appeals to\npathological values) risks giving up one feature of the current\nframework prized by many psychiatrists, namely the refusal to use\ndiagnosis as a basis for determinations of capacity\n (\u00a75.5\n above). If anorexia causes problematic values and if this is\nsufficient to render patients incompetent, then since all patients\nwith anorexia have such values, we will in effect be saying that all\nsuch patients lack the capacity to refuse treatment.\n\nFinally, it is controversial whether or not we can really say that\nanorexia causes these values, even though it is clear that\nanorexia correlates with the existence of them. Like most mental\ndisorders, anorexia nervosa is defined in terms of its symptoms rather\nthan an underlying cause. Namely, the disorder is defined in terms of\nthe strong desires for extreme thinness we have been discussing, as\nwell as the behavioral consequences of these desires. And these\ndesires in turn reflect the value these patients place on extreme\nthinness. It is thus not explanatorily helpful or illuminating in any\nway to say that these desires are caused by anorexia, for\nthis amounts to saying (unhelpfully) that strong desires for extreme\nthinness are caused by strong desires for extreme thinness or that\nvaluing extreme thinness causes the valuing of extreme thinness.\n\nThe issue here is not about whether anorexia is really an illness\n(undoubtedly it is, and a very serious one at that). Rather, the point\nis about our current resources for explanation. Individuals\ncan agree that (a) anorexia is a devastating condition and be puzzled\nby (b) the fact that such individuals typically count as having\ndecision-making capacity, and yet also remain puzzled about (c) how\nprecisely to explain incapacity in these cases in a way consistent\nwith the general values described earlier\n (\u00a75.1\u20135.5).\n\nA slightly different point about values and decision-making capacity\nhas been made more recently, also in the context of trying to\nunderstand patients with anorexia. After extensive and careful\nanalysis of the ways individual patients talk about and describe their\nillness, Hope et al. (2011, 2013) have raised doubts about whether or\nnot we can trust a patient\u2019s own description of her mental\nstates, because patients appear to use different words for the same\nexperience at different times. This is extremely important because,\ngiven the existing framework, everything turns on whether or not\npatients have false beliefs (thereby failing either the understanding\nrequirement or the appreciation requirement). But unusual values are\n(on the standard approach) allowed to stand. However, the research of\nHope et al. suggests that the line between beliefs and values can\nactually be deeply obscure for patients as well as clinicians.\n\nHope et al. (2013) have argued that individuals with anorexia are in\nthe grip of affective states that shape how they see the world. Yet,\nalthough the world presents to them as one way, they may at another\nmore reflective level, reject the appearances. Thus an individual may\nhave a strong feeling or emotional sense that she is\nfat. But even though these feelings incline her to accept the\nproposition that she is fat she may not in fact believe at a higher\nlevel that she is fat. She may know quite well that she is dangerously\nthin. An analogy here with optical illusions is helpful. The\nexperience of seeing a stick in water as bent is incredibly powerful,\nbut we may nonetheless know it is not bent. However, the mental state\nthat is most authoritative when it comes to reporting our beliefs may\nnot be the same as the mental state that is most motivationally\npowerful. When it comes time to make choices about treatment, the\nsalience of the affective phenomena and the relative lack of salience\nof the dangers of self-starvation may lead a person to refuse\ntreatment.\n\nHere is where the puzzle for capacity assessment arises. In a very\nreal sense, the refusal is based on a mental state with a certain\npropositional content that is false. So, under the traditional\nanalysis, it seems we should count the patient as lacking capacity.\nBut in another sense, since her reflective self does not accept that\ncontent (she does not strictly speaking believe it) she has no false\nbeliefs (Hope et al. 2013: 30). And she is credible in\nreporting this. So, again following the traditional analysis, it seems\nwe should count the patient as having capacity.\n\nShe will, of course, be called upon to justify her decision and it may\nnot be clear to her how to describe her mental states. We do not\ntypically report affective experiences in the same way we report\nbeliefs. The only logical argument she could possibly offer would be:\nI would prefer to risk death than to put on weight (Hope et al. 2013:\n30). And this looks like a preference. On the classic analysis she is\ncompetent because her refusing treatment logically follows, given her\npreferences. But as Hope et al. say:\n\n\nBut this preference is not one she clearly held before discussion with\nher physician. It was constructed to create a rational argument for\nrefusing treatment that can satisfy her physician. (Hope et al. 2013:\n30)\n\n\nIf these descriptions of what happens with anorexia patients are\ncorrect, it seems plausible to suppose such patients should not\n(normatively speaking) be counted as having decision-making capacity.\nThey are, on this picture, subject to the emotional equivalent of a\npowerful illusion, and they are unable to resist the illusion when it\ncomes to choice. However, many problems remain about how to properly\ndistinguish cases of capacity and incapacity. The description offered\nby Hope et al. is extremely important for what it calls to our\nattention, but it still leaves most of the core issues unresolved.\n\n\nFinally, a slightly different (but related) challenge to the\nfour-abilities model is made using the notion of authenticity.\nBuilding on the idea introduced by Tan, Stewart, Fitzpatrick, and Hope\n(2006a) that certain values are caused by mental disorder and suspect\nin virtue of this, these critics raise the worry that the values\ndriving decisions may not be authentic values of the patient. If\nauthenticity is, in turn, thought of as part of autonomy, then it\nmight be thought that inauthentic values undermine capacity (though\nsee discussion of autonomy and capacity\n \u00a72).\n So the question then becomes: can we require that the values driving\na treatment decision be authentic, and if not may we declare the\nperson incompetent?\n\nKim (2016) has recently defended a mild form of authenticity\nrequirement that he calls \u201cthe ability to value\u201d. The\nterminology can be misleading because it is not about whether one is\nable to value something as opposed to nothing, but\nabout whether one is able to bring one\u2019s own authentic values to\nbear on decision-making (Hawkins 2016). There are two questions raised\nby Kim that correspond neatly to the two requirements he sketches for\nthe ability to value: first, are the values driving a particular\ntreatment decision really the patient\u2019s own values, or is the\npatient acting out of character? Second, if the values seem\ninauthentic, can we demonstrate that the new problematic values arose\nwith the onset of mental disorder or after some illness related event\n(for example, a depressed person who stopped taking meds three weeks\nago, and started wanting to die shortly thereafter)? The second\nquestion is analogous to the second question that arises in assessing\nappreciation, where we have to determine whether or not a\npatient\u2019s failure to believe that the facts are true of her is\ncaused by a mental problem of some sort (e.g., dementia induced\nconfusion or ICU psychosis). If appreciation fails because of\nreligious or cultural beliefs, this is not a sign of incapacity. Kim\nis clear that he intends this requirement to be applied very\ncarefully, and that impairment in this domain is not sufficient for a\ndetermination of incapacity, though he is vague about what precisely\nit can contribute to such a decision.\n\nOne problem with this view arises if one considers the fact that some\nindividuals with mental disorder identify with their illness (Erler\n& Hope 2014). Tan, Hope, and Stewart (2003b) explore the ways that\nmany young women with anorexia see their illness as an essential part\nof who they are. Yet it is these same values that are influencing\ntheir treatment decisions. If we wish to find a way of explaining the\ndeep intuition that these women lack decision-making capacity, then if\nwe do so through appeals to authenticity, we will most likely have to\ngive up on the idea that individuals are themselves the final\nauthority about which values or features of themselves are the\nauthentic ones.\n\nAppeals to authenticity also face problems related to our ability to\ndistinguish truly inauthentic values from new but still authentic\nones. Not all new values are inauthentic, for it is possible for a\nperson to autonomously change her mind. Moreover, sometimes illness\ngives us experiences that seem highly relevant to our choices. Having\nonce experienced illness we may be inclined to make decisions we would\nnever have expected ourselves to make before we were ill. The\ndecisions are not caused by our illness, but rather reflect what we\nhave learned from illness. As such they should not count against\ncapacity. But to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen we need reliable\nways of distinguishing cases that can, in fact, be very hard to\ndistinguish from the outside. [Also, insofar as we are looking for\nsuspicious changes in values as signs of inauthenticity, this\nwill not help in many cases of anorexia nervosa, where the patients in\nquestion typically acquire the illness at a very young age before they\nhave developed characteristic values distinguishable from the values\nof the illness.]\n\nKim\u2019s awareness of the dangers of confusing real value changes\nwith pathologically induced changes leads him to emphasize the need\nfor extreme caution in this area. Indeed, one problem with Kim\u2019s\napproach is that his understandable caution means that in many cases\nwhere intuitively a patient may lack capacity, we will still not be\nable to rule the patient incompetent (Hawkins 2016). In short, the\noriginal range of ethical constraints on capacity assessment continues\nto make it difficult to capture all and only the cases that seem\nintuitively to be cases of genuine incapacity, and Kim\u2019s\nsolution, though perhaps capturing a few more cases than other views,\nis still restrained in ways that leave us with some highly\ncounterintuitive cases.\n",
