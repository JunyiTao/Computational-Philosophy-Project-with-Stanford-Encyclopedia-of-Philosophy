    "main_text": "Sin as Action\n2. Sin as Action\n\nOne of the most common ways in which sinful actions have been\ncharacterized is as actions in conflict with the behaviors and\npatterns of life to which God calls humanity. The term\n\u201cactions\u201d should here be broadly construed to include\nomissions as well as commissions: we sin when we fail to love our\nneighbors as ourselves, for instance, even if we do not actively harm\nthem. Sinful actions are, in short, actions that fail to live up to\nthe will or commands of God (see Stump 2018).\n\nMany sinful actions will be deliberately chosen or intentional. In\nfact, it is common in some parts of the Christian tradition to take\n\u201csin properly so called\u201d to be a willful transgression of\na known law of God. Ruth Groenhout, for instance, describes sin as\n\n\nthe deliberate choice of a lesser good in preference to a greater,\nchosen in spite of and against the loving, creative, and wholly good\nwill of God. (Groenhout 2006: 135)\n\n\nGroenhout here is drawing on a tradition that goes back at least to\nAugustine, according to which sin necessarily involves inordinate\ndesire for a lesser good. Augustine held the privation view of sin,\naccording to which\u2014insofar as evil is the absence of\ngood\u2014sinful actions involve \u201cnot a desire for naturally\nevil things, but an abandonment of better things\u201d (as quoted in\nMann 2001: 45; see also Augustine On Free Choice of the\nWill).\n\nWe sin, then, if we knowingly do that which we know we ought not, and\nif we knowingly do not do that which we know we ought. According to\nmany views, we also sin when we internally endorse a sinful action,\nwhether or not we carry through with that endorsement and perform the\naction. These views often appeal to the following passage from the\nSermon on the Mount:\n\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, \u201cYou\nshall not murder\u201d; and \u201cwhoever murders shall be liable to\njudgment\u201d. But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother\nor sister, you will be liable to judgment.\u2026You have heard that\nit was said, \u201cYou shall not commit adultery\u201d. But I say to\nyou that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed\nadultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:21\u201322 and\n27\u201328, New Revised Standard Version)\n\n\nOn some views, Christianity also countenances involuntary or\nunintentional sins, holding that some emotions and desires can be\nsinful even if they\u2019re not directly under our voluntary control.\nAccording to Robert Adams, for instance, failing to take\nresponsibility for our emotions and motives is both self-alienating\nand blameworthy even when those emotions and motives are involuntary,\nalthough the appropriate response to involuntary sins differs from\nthat for voluntary sins and voluntariness can affect the degree of\nwrongness (R. Adams 1985). William Wainwright also defends the view\nthat we can sometimes be blameworthy for involuntary actions, broadly\nconstrued to include desires and beliefs (see Wainwright 1988:\n40).\n\nFurthermore, some philosophers think that there are sinful actions\nthat don\u2019t violate any normative restrictions. Here, Richard\nSwinburne\u2019s distinction between \u201cobjective\u201d and\n\u201csubjective\u201d sins can be helpful. Objective sins occur\nwhen a person does what is objectively wrong, whether they realize\nthat it\u2019s wrong or not. Subjective sins occur when a person does\nwhat they believe to be wrong, acting against their conception of the\ngood (Swinburne 1989: 124). On this differentiation, it\u2019s\npossible for an action to be both objectively and subjectively sinful,\nobjectively but not subjectively sinful (as in the case of people who\nsin believing they are acting in the right), and subjectively but not\nobjectively sinful (as in the case of a person who acts against an\nerring conscience). According to Philip Quinn,\n\n\nTheists who believe that erring conscience binds will want to allow\nfor cases in which, on account of a mistaken belief about the moral\nwrongness of an action, a person does what is subjectively but not\nobjectively wrong and so sins subjectively but not objectively. (Quinn\n1986: 542; see also Stump 2003: 90)\n\n\nHowever, one could also think that what is sinful about\n\u201csubjective sins\u201d is that one is acting against\none\u2019s conscience, and thus \u201cobjectively\u201d sinning\ninsofar as one is not following one\u2019s conscience, even when\none\u2019s conscience is in error. Even on this interpretation,\nhowever, the class of sins is broader than \u201cwillful\ntransgressions of a known law of God\u201d.\n\nMuch of the philosophical work engaging sinful actions in contemporary\nphilosophy of religion has been in connection with the problem of\nevil, understood as a family of related arguments that take among\ntheir premises facts about evil and seek to conclude either that God\n(understood as having a particular nature) does not exist or that it\nis irrational to believe that such a being exists. Sinful acts and\nmoral evil are often taken to be either co-extensive or nearly so (see\nHasker 2008: 160), and so versions of the problem of evil that focus\non the problem of moral evil also often talk about sin. The main\nthrust of most of the versions is that an all-powerful, all-knowing,\nall-good God would not allow human beings to perpetuate or suffer\nhorrendous evils. Because human beings do both perpetuate and suffer\nhorrendous evils, either God must not be all-powerful, all-knowing,\nand/or all-good, or God must not exist. The question of sin is not,\nhowever, limited to discussions of the logical problem of moral evil;\nit also comes up in discussions of evidential versions of the problem\nof evil and even the problem of natural evils (see, for instance,\nSwinburne 2009 and 1978); van Inwagen 2006: lecture 7; and\nO\u2019Connor 1991).\n\nOne of the most famous responses to this version of the problem of\nevil is what Alvin Plantinga has termed \u201cThe Free Will\nDefense\u201d. According to this response, God\u2019s creating human\nbeings with free will (and refraining from tampering with the freedom\nof that will) makes the existence of moral evils/sinful actions at\nleast possible \u2013 and perhaps even likely:\n\n\nFor any free creature God creates, this falling into sin is clearly a\npossibility; God can\u2019t create significantly free creatures\n[i.e., a person who is free with respect to a morally significant\naction it would be morally wrong for them to perform and morally right\nto refrain from, or vice versa] who cannot fall into sin. And perhaps\na high probability of such a fall attaches to free creatures\n(creatures with an area of autonomy) who are created in the image of\nGod. God sets out to create beings in his own image: they resemble him\nin having will and intellect, and they recognize the lustrous beauty,\nglory, and desirability of God\u2019s position. God is himself the\ncenter of the universe; his creatures see the splendor and wonderful\ndesirability of that condition. Perhaps, insofar as one is free, and\nsees both the glory of this position and its enormous desirability,\nthere is a powerful tendency to desire it for oneself. Perhaps there\nis a high probability that beings created in the image of God will\nalso wind up resembling him in this: that they want to see and do see\nthemselves as the center of the universe. Perhaps a substantial\nprobability of falling into this condition is built into the very\nnature of free creatures who have knowledge of God\u2019s glorious\nstatus and do see it as indeed glorious and desirable. (Plantinga\n2000: 212f; see also Plantinga 1974, Plantinga 1977, and M. Adams\n1999)\n\n\nAs this argument makes clear, one\u2019s view about the nature of\nsinful act will be closely related to one\u2019s view about the\nnature of human freedom (see McFadyen 2016, Timpe 2014a, and\nCouenhoven 2013). Plantinga here assumes a libertarian, and hence\nincompatibilist, understanding of free will. While all Christian views\nhave to explain how God is not complicit in sin given the doctrines of\nconservation and concurrence (Kvanvig 2009; Vander Laan 2017; and\nMcCall 2019: chapter 7), the question of God\u2019s relation to\nsinful human acts is especially pressing for compatibilist views,\nwhich hold that God could have caused human agents to never freely\nsin, and theological determinist views, which hold that God causes all\nevents (see McCall 2019: chapter 3; Bignon 2018: part 2; White 2016;\nBruce 2016; McCall 2016; Rogers 2008; McCann 2005; and Crisp 2005,\nparticularly chapter 3).\n\nAccount of the nature of sinful acts are closely related to accounts\nof the theological need for forgiveness, redemption, and atonement.\nWhile some philosophers claim that the correct understanding of these\ndoctrines comes as a package (see Copan 2003: 525f), there is\nsignificant disagreement about how best to understand them, both\nindividually and in relation to each other. (There is, for instance, a\nwide range of views about how best to understand the atonement; see,\namong others, Stump 2018, S. Porter 2004, Swinburne 1989 and 1988,\nLewis 1997, and Quinn 1986. For a discussion directly of how sin\nrelates to atonement, see Crisp 2009.)\n",
