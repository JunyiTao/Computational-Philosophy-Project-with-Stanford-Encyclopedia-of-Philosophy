    "main_text": "Information Technologies of Morality\n4. Information Technologies of Morality\n\nA key development in the realm of information technologies is that\nthey are not only the object of moral deliberations but they are also\nbeginning to be used as a tool in moral deliberation itself. Since\nartificial intelligence technologies and applications are a kind of\nautomated problem solvers, and moral deliberations are a kind of\nproblem, it was only a matter of time before automated moral reasoning\ntechnologies would emerge. This is still only an emerging technology\nbut it has a number of very interesting moral implications which will\nbe outlined below. The coming decades are likely to see a number of\nadvances in this area and ethicists need to pay close attention to\nthese developments as they happen. Susan and Michael Anderson have\ncollected a number of articles regarding this topic in their book,\nMachine Ethics (2011), and Rocci Luppicini has a section of\nhis anthology devoted to this topic in the Handbook of Research on\nTechnoethics (2009).\n",
