    "preamble": "\n\nEarly modern philosophy in Europe and Great Britain is awash with\ndiscussions of the emotions: they figure not only in philosophical\npsychology and related fields, but also in theories of epistemic\nmethod, metaphysics, ethics, political theory and practical reasoning\nin general. Moreover, interest in the emotions links philosophy with\nwork in other, sometimes unexpected areas, such as medicine, art,\nliterature, and practical guides on everything from child-rearing to\nthe treatment of subordinates. Because of the breadth of the topic,\nthis article can offer only an overview, but perhaps it will be enough\nto give some idea how philosophically rich and challenging the\nconception of the emotions was in this period. Most attention will be\ndevoted to the familiar figures of early modern philosophy and how\nthey conceived of the emotions as valuable, even indispensable aspects\nof embodied human life, which were largely constitutive of the self\nand identity that matter to us practically.\n\nA word of caution is in order: there is a plethora of source material,\nand this entry is offered as a survey for organizing that material.\nAlas, much worthy material must be excluded here. This article and its\nsupplements are designed for readers browsing for specific\ninformation, as well as those hardy souls who may wish to read it\nstraight through. The main document offers a thematic overview of\nearly modern discussions of the emotions. Separate links lead to\ndocuments devoted to the pre-history of the topic, as well as to some\nof the most important individual figures in early modern\nphilosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n1.1 Difficulties of Approach:\n\nEven recognizing some early modern writings on the emotions for what\nthey are is no easy task. In part, this is due to diverging and\nrapidly changing vocabularies for talking about the emotions.\nSeventeenth century philosophers favored talk of\n\u2018passion\u2019, \u2018affect,\u2019 and\n\u2018affection,\u2019 while their eighteenth century counterparts\nmade increasing use of \u2018sentiment.\u2019 None of these terms\n(or their French and Latin cognates) carried the meaning they now do\nor that \u2018emotion\u2019 has come to bear (which had the sense of\nphysical motion or agitation as much as psychological well into the\nnineteenth century). It is also easy to overlook the role early modern\nphilosophy gives to \u2018calm\u2019 emotions, if we concentrate on\nthe current notion of passions as violent, turbulent and overwhelming.\nIn general, early modern philosophers tended to prefer their emotions\ncalm, but took turbulence to mark only certain kinds of passions.\nAnother difficulty arises from the seemingly ambivalent nature early\nmodern philosophers granted to the emotions. \u2018Passion,\u2019 in\nparticular, is connected with a kind of receptivity, but how the\npassions are receptive and what they are receptive to tend to cross\nover various comfortable divisions taken to mark early modern\nphilosophy: mind and body; perception and will; reason, judgment and\ndesire; occurrent consciousness and dispositions or character;\nrepresentations and presentations; private and social; nature and\nconvention; and even what is internal and what external to\nsubjectivity.\n1.2 Philosophical Background\n\nEarly modern discussions of the emotions are deeply indebted to\nearlier sources. Aristotle was particularly important (much more so\nthan Plato), influencing early modern theories both directly and\nthrough Stoic, medical, Ciceronian, and Scholastic approaches\n(especially that of Aquinas). Stoicism, likewise, was transmitted both\nfrom Latin authors and from the neo-Stoic revival of the\n16th century (represented, e.g., by Justus Lipsius, and in\nsome moods, Montaigne). As in other areas of philosophy, however,\nthose sources met a mixed reception. Aristotle\u2019s classification of the\nfaculties of the soul and his location of the emotions among the\nappetites of the sensitive part remained commonplaces, as did\nAquinas\u2019s further distinction between the irascible and concupiscible\npassions. But starting with Descartes, some of the most famous early\nmodern philosophers soundly rejected these and other points.\nSimilarly, even those thinkers who seem to owe the most to Stoicism\n(e.g., Descartes and Spinoza) explicitly criticized certain of its\ndoctrines, including the view that the passions are erroneous\njudgments. Different sorts of criticism proceeded from thinkers such\nas Pascal and Malebranche who borrowed from Augustine a sense of human\ninsufficiency for virtue and happiness that put them at odds with\nStoic, Skeptical and Epicurean ideals of the autonomous life of the\nsage. And many aspects of the systematic treatments of Aquinas and\nlater Scholastic authors were both maintained and attacked, often by\nthe same authors.\n\nOther ancient sources were also important, even when they were subject\nto less discussion or criticism. The theory of the humors and animal\nspirits of the Hippocratic and Galenist medical traditions offered\nmuch of the basic vocabulary for early modern discussions of the\nphysiology of the emotions. Rhetorical works, such as those by\nAristotle and Cicero, provided a great deal of material for\ntaxonomizing and manipulating the emotions. (Indeed, some of the\ndistinctive early modern practice of generating long lists of\nemotions, as well as many of the forms of classification, can be\ntraced to these sources.) Popular treatises, such as those by Juan\nLuis Vives, received a number of mentions. Less obvious, but still\ninfluential were the discussions of particular emotions in Renaissance\nworks, such as the treatment of love and melancholy by the Florentine\nhumanists, or that of \u201cglory\u201d [gloria] by\nMachiavelli and Montaigne. These sources overlap in ways that are not\nalways consistent and can be difficult to trace: for instance, we find\nSpinoza probably paraphrasing a passage from Montaigne (E III Def of\nthe Affects XLIV), where Montaigne criticizes Cicero\u2019s ambitions for\n\u201cglory\u201d by directly quoting the Latin author (Montaigne,\n1958, 187) \u2013 all without anything like citation of sources.\n\nThe very vocabulary available to early modern theorists is marked by\ntheir historical legacy. The terms \u2018passion,\u2019\n\u2018perturbation,\u2019 and \u2018affect\u2019 are all rooted in\nchoices made by Latin authors such as Augustine, Cicero and Seneca for\ntranslating the Greek pathos used by Aristotle. In contrast,\n\u2018sentiment,\u2019 which came to be used with increasing\nfrequency by eighteenth century British and French authors, seems\ndistinctively modern. Debates about whether to classify emotions among\nappetites, judgments, or volitions originated in the models of\nAristotle, the Stoics and Augustine, while Descartes inaugurated the\ntrend of counting them among perceptions. Early modern associations\nbetween the emotions and the body also owed an enormous amount to\nancient and medieval sources, as did views connecting emotions with\nmotives for action. Such connections often underlay the long-running\ndebate inherited by the early moderns about the epistemic,\neudaimonistic and ethical value of the emotions, a central issue of\nwhich is the degree to which we can manage and control our emotions.\nAlthough the assessments of pre-modern theorists varied enormously,\nthere was a generally positive view of pleasurable emotions. This\nevaluation was shared by many seventeenth and eighteenth-century\nphilosophers, who often played up the holistic functionality of such\nemotions. At the same time, the early moderns seem to have inherited a\nstrong sense of the value of various forms of emotional tranquility\n\u2013 something worth bearing in mind for understanding the changing\nuses of \u2018passion.\u2019\n1.3 Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Theories of the Emotions [Supplementary document]\n\nFor a more detailed discussion on the philosophical background as it\nwas received by early modern philosophers, see the supplement on\n\nAncient, Medieval and Renaissance Theories of the Emotions\n\n2. The Context of Early Modern Theories of the Passions\n2.1 Changing Vocabulary\n\nPretty much every philosopher of the early modern period developed\ndistinctive terms of art for discussing the emotions. Still, some\nvocabulary was general currency. The most common term for describing\nthe emotions in the seventeenth century was undoubtedly\n\u2018passion,\u2019 perhaps because of the influence of Descartes\u2019s\nPassions of the Soul (1649), perhaps because of a general\ntendency to see the emotions as receptive, passive states. It was not\nthe only term used: \u2018affect\u2019 and \u2018sentiment\u2019\nalso appeared, as did \u2018perturbation,\u2019 and\n\u2018emotion,\u2019 although these were not usually terms of art,\nand \u2018emotion\u2019 usually meant little more than\n\u2018motion.\u2019 The choice of terminology often marked\nintellectual allegiances: Descartes saw himself as introducing a new\ntheory, in which \u201cpassions\u201d are a species of perception,\nwhile Spinoza\u2019s \u201caffects\u201d signaled his debt to Stoic\nethics, as well as distinctive features of his metaphysics. In his\nPens\u00e9es (1670), Pascal introduced\n\u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csentiments\u201d\n[sentiments], sometimes contrasting them with the corrupted\npassions and marking his neo-Augustinian understanding of love (see\nPens\u00e9es 680, 531).\n\n\u2018Sentiment\u2019 was a particularly popular term in British\nphilosophy of the eighteenth century, as was \u2018affection.\u2019\nThese terms were sometimes used interchangeably with and sometimes in\ncontrast to \u2018passions.\u2019 In the latter case,\n\u2018sentiments\u2019 or \u2018affections\u2019 specified calm\nemotions, perhaps tempered by reflection or refined in some other way;\nwhereas, \u2018passion\u2019 indicated a raw, uncorrected emotion,\nwhich may be \u2018violent\u2019 in the sense of either agitating\nus, or being unresponsive to reason. Bernard Mandeville, for instance,\nspoke of humans as \u201ca compound of passions\u201d in his\nFable of the Bees (1714), emphasizing that our emotions are\ndisorganized, fleeting and not subject to correction. Hutcheson, in\ncontrast, distinguished passions from \u2018affections\u2019 in his\nEssay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and\nAffections (1728), on the grounds that the former are confused\nand \u201cviolent,\u201d while the latter are calm and typically\nbenevolent. Famously, Hume applied \u2018sentiment\u2019 to the\nclass of refined and reflective emotions that are the basis for our\nmoral and aesthetic judgments. In doing so, he may have followed the\npractice of the Abb\u00e9 Dubos in his 1719 Critical Reflections\non Poetry and on Painting  [R\u00e9flexions critiques sur\nla po\u00ebsie et sur la peinture]. There Dubos argued that we do\nnot judge artworks through applications of reason, but by a kind of\ninternal \u201csense\u201d [sentiment interieur] comparable\nto (literal) taste, and which \u201cis commonly called\nsentiment\u201d [le sentiment] (Vol. 2, sec. 22, 306\u2013313; see\nJones 1982, 97). Still, Dubos\u2019s use of the term was casual and\noften ambiguous, and Hume likewise introduced \u2018sentiment\u2019\nin Book III of his Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340) with\nlittle explanation. Nonetheless, the term entered into philosophical\nparlance, such that two decades later, Smith titled his major work\nThe Theory of the Moral Sentiments (1759). Indeed, the\ncontrast between passion and sentiment was not confined to philosophy.\nSarah Fielding\u2019s novel The Adventures of David Simple, first\npublished in 1744 and wildly popular in its day, frequently used\n\u201cpassions\u201d to describe forceful, idiosyncratic emotions\nand desires, particularly those that mark the personality of a\ncharacter, while reserving \u201csentiment\u201d for calmer, shared\naffects and judgments. By 1762, Henry Home, Lord Kames, termed\n\u201cevery thought prompted by a passion\u201d a\n\u201csentiment\u201d (Elements of Criticism I, chap.\nxvi).\n\nThe developments in vocabulary took place against a background of\nshared associations and assumptions about the emotions. Emotions were\ncommonly connected with passivity, and what lay outside of our direct\ncontrol, features often emphasized by using the term\n\u2018passion.\u2019 They were also associated with various forms of\nperception, even as they were sometimes granted an intentional and\njudgment-like structure \u2013 for which the double sense of\n\u2018sentiment\u2019 as felt response and as opinion was\nparticularly apt. Emotions were also often characterized through\nfeelings of either pleasure or pain. At the same time, emotions were\ntypically assumed to have directions (to causes of pleasure, or from\ncauses of pain) and to provide motives for action. Given this cluster,\nphilosophers often emphasized one or another of the features\nassociated with the emotions. Although no philosophical questions were\nsettled by word choice alone, the preferred vocabulary can reveal much\nabout the choice of emphasis.\n\nStill, it is worth bearing in mind that the available vocabulary may\nnot fully capture what we now think of as emotion, affect, or mood.\nWhether called \u2018passion,\u2019 \u2018affect\u2018 or\n\u2018sentiment,\u2019 emotions were usually conceived as having\nobjects, which could be understood causally or intentionally (or\nboth). Kames\u2019s conception of an emotion \u201cin its nature\nquiescent, and merely a passive feeling, [such that it] must have a\ncause; but cannot be said properly speaking, to have an object\u201d\nwas unusual and prompted him to introduce an innovative distinction\nbetween \u2018emotion\u2019 and \u2018passion\u2019 (Elements\nof Criticism I, chap. ii). Sometimes the preferred terminology\ndidn\u2019t even capture the range of affective states recognized by early\nmodern philosophers. Descartes, for instance, wrote of\n\u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cintellectual\u201d emotions, which\nare not passions proper, but certainly have affective components, as\nwell as being causally intertwined with the true passions. Spinoza\ndistinguished \u201caffects\u201d from various emotions and moods\nthat for him indicated \u201cstrength of mind,\u201d while reserving\na special status for \u201cblessedness\u201d [beatitudo]. On\nthe other hand, \u2018passion\u2019 didn\u2019t even begin to get its\ncontemporary flavor of violent, often sexually-charged emotions until\nthe middle of the eighteenth century (at the earliest), and so what\ncounted as a passion can sometimes come as a surprise. Hobbes included\n\u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201cglory\u201d among his passions,\nand many favorite early modern passions are quite placid, such as\n\u2018wonder,\u2019 or \u2018the love of truth.\u2019 There was\nalso a whole special vocabulary for affective states that were\nrecognized by various medical traditions, ranging from\n\u2018splenetic humour\u2019 to general\n\u2018melancholy.\u2019\n2.2 Taxonomies\n\nSeventeenth-century accounts are rife with long inventories of\nemotions, although the list-making urge seems to have dampened a bit\nby the eighteenth century, with many fewer authors pretending to\nexhaustive catalogues. Compared to his contemporaries, Descartes looks\ntemperate with a docket of a mere six simple passions, although he\nalso constructed a host of complex ones out of these six. Hobbes\noffered a list of about thirty in the Leviathan (1651), and\nmore than twenty-five in The Elements of Law (ms. 1640). The\nhead count for Spinoza is a bit trickier to determine, but the third\nbook of his Ethics (ms. 1675) defines at least forty affects.\nLocke\u2019s short discussion in Book II, chap. XX of the Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (1690) treats eleven; whereas\nHume\u2019s Treatise and \u201cDissertation on the Passions\u201d\n(1757) described about ten broad passions, as well as numerous\nsub-species and adjuncts, even before turning to the moral or\naesthetic sentiments. This tendency is not simply found among the\ngreat early modern systems-builders. In the seventeenth century in\nparticular, just about everybody (and their maiden aunt and bachelor\nuncle) seems to have joined in the hunt for new and distinctive lists\nof emotions. For instance, large portions of Thomas Wright\u2019s The\nPassions of the Mind In General (1604) and Nicholas Coeffeteau\u2019s\nTableau des passions humaines, de leurs causes et leurs\neffets (ms. 1621) are devoted to such lists. A short play of\n1630, Pathomachia; or the Battel of Affections, even makes\nproper taxonomy the motor of what little drama it possesses.\n\nThe proliferation of lists can be at least partly explained by the\nproliferation of schemes of classification. Again, the attention to\nprinciples of classification is most marked in the seventeenth-century\ntheorists, in part because of the taxonomic connections they saw\nbetween the treatment of the passions and their scientific ambitions\nin other areas, and in part because of the attacks launched against\nthe systems of previous, e.g., scholastic, thinkers. Descartes, for\ninstance, singled out Aquinas\u2019s division of the passions into the\nconcupiscible and irascible for express and explicit criticism. But\nmaking his case required constructing an alternative classification\nmore in accord with his reformist account of the soul and its\nfaculties. Despite the efforts of those on the cutting edge of passion\ntheory, however, the Aquinian distinction remained a commonplace bit\nof early modern folk psychology, as we can see in Wright, Burton, and\neven Henry More. Then too, many early modern authors borrowed, and\nborrowed heavily, from Stoic and Thomist classifications. Hobbes and\nLocke, for instance, both drew from Aquinas\u2019s enumeration of eleven\npassions, as did Jacques Bossuet in Trait\u00e9 de la\nconnaissance de Dieu et de soi-m\u00eame (ms. after 1670; see\nGardiner 1970, 205).\n\nMany time-honored principles of classification clearly decreased in\nimportance during the early modern period. In particular, the\npossibility of psychic conflict, especially that which could generate\ncompeting motives for action, had been a common device in ancient and\nmedieval theories for distinguishing among passions, kinds of\npassions, and faculties of the soul in general. This principle played\nsome role for Descartes in distinguishing between movements coming\nfrom the body and those originating in the soul, and it was deployed\nsporadically by other theorists. But the practice died out over the\ncourse of the two centuries, as theorists came to recognize the\npossibility that a single, or similar, emotional source might produce\nconflicting motions or tendencies, both in the individual and across\nsocieties. Indeed, some emotions were characterized exactly by such\nconflict or turbulence. Descartes\u2019s description of regret is one such\nexample. A somewhat happier case is the emotions generated by tragedy,\nas explained by philosophers from Malebranche to Hume.\n\nPerhaps the most basic division in play is evaluative, i.e., whether\nthe emotion is good or bad. This was hardly an innovation. But early\nmodern philosophers came to understand that division in two different\nways \u2013 either an emotion is directed at good or evil as an\nobject, or the emotion itself is affectively good or bad, pleasurable\nor painful. Many distinctively modern theories subsumed the former\nunder the latter: both the naturalistic theories of Hobbes and\nSpinoza, on the one hand, and the moral sense theories of Hutcheson\nand Hume, on the other, held that we project the value of the object\nfrom the affective quality of the emotion, although Hume allows for\ncomplications in how we experience the valences of a passion as\nbelonging to self or other, using such mechanisms as sympathy and\ncomparison. Some authors also identified neutral emotions:\n\u2018wonder\u2019 is a common example, deriving largely from\nDescartes, although anticipated in Sir Kenelme Digby\u2019s Two\nTreatises (1644).\n\nSome philosophers singled out a particular passion, or group of\npassions, to head off their taxonomies. In rather different ways, that\nwas the role of wonder for Descartes, and of glory for Hobbes (see\nSchmitter 2017). Malebranche took there to be an irreducible element\nof love in every passion. Mary Astell, in turn, called love of God\n\u201cthe leading and Master Passion\u201d (Letters Concerning\nthe Love of God, Letter VII). An even more common organizing\ndevice was to divide the passions into simple and complex. Not only\ndid this impose a manageable order on the many recognized passions, it\nallowed explanation to be focused on the simplest cases, with the\nexpectation that other emotions would fall into line, either as\ncompounds, offspring, or species of the simples. The simple passions\nthemselves were organized into contrasting groups, based on their\nevaluative character. Schemes of this kind can be found in Descartes,\nMalebranche, Spinoza, Thomas Wright, and to a lesser extent, Hume.\n\nMany other forms of classification were tied closely to the particular\ninterests of individual authors. This is particularly the case with\nthose eighteenth-century British authors who argued against Hobbes (as\nthey understood him) and Mandeville that the very possibility of\nmorality requires that we be capable of genuinely benevolent emotions.\nFor this reason, distinctions between self-directed and other-directed\nemotions and between anti-social and sociable emotions were a common\npoint of organization and contention. Similar concerns also generated\na distinction between idiosyncratic affects and emotions that could be\ncultivated to be broadly shared; in particular, emotions were often\ndivided into the raw and immediate and those that involve an element\nof reflection. This distinction lent itself also to those philosophers\nconcerned with the historical and social development of humans, as\nevident in many works of Rousseau. For instance, the Discourse on\nthe Origin of Inequality (1755) presents a kind of natural\nhistory tracing the genesis of many emotions through changes in social\nstructure; works such as Emile (1762), La Nouvelle\nHeloise (1761), and the Confessions (1782) treat the\naffective maturation and socialization of individuals, as well as the\nmanagement and effects of the emotions. But for all his genealogical\nconcerns, Rousseau, and indeed many other eighteenth-century authors,\nshowed a good deal less interest in taxonomizing the emotions\naccording to principled systems than did their predecessors.\n2.3 Philosophical Issues in Theories of the Emotions\n\nFew areas of early modern philosophy remained untouched by at least\nsome theory of the emotions. What follows is simply a cursory overview\nof some issues of general interest. But since early modern\nunderstandings of the emotions often made unexpected connections\nbetween diverse areas of philosophy, we may find that investigation\nreshapes our map of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy.\nCertainly, the understanding of the emotions produced in one area of\nphilosophy was not isolated from their treatment in other areas.\n\nThat is true of how the emotions figured in much of\nseventeenth-century metaphysics. Locating the emotions within their\ndistinctive ontologies was an important, but sometimes challenging\ntask for philosophers such as Descartes, Malebranche, and Spinoza. In\ndoing so, they often tapped a broad metaphysical distinction between\nthe active and the passive, which sometimes supported, and sometimes\nundermined those ontologies (see James 1997). The emotions also inform\nvarious approaches to the relation between mind and body, whether\nDescartes\u2019s dualism, Hobbes\u2019s materialism, Spinoza\u2019s parallelism, or\nthose of philosophers who refused to take a stand on the issue.\nIndeed, attempts to accommodate the emotions sometimes led to novel\nand intricate pictures of the relations between soul and body: Walter\nCharleton\u2019s Natural History of the Passions (1674,\n2nd ed., 1701), for instance, posits two souls, one that is\nrational and immaterial and one that is sensitive and extended,\nmediating between the rational soul and the body. The emotions were\nalso important in accounts of personal identity, whether that is\nunderstood ontologically in the cases of Descartes and Spinoza, or\npsychologically in the case of Hume.\n\nTheories of the emotions played a role \u2013 often a pivotal one\n\u2013 in the important early modern debates about causation and the\nproper forms of explanation. As part of their embrace of the new\nscience, many seventeenth century philosophers considered the emotions\nto be susceptible, at least in part, to mechanical explanation.\nAlthough Descartes offered a teleological defense of our propensities\nto experience emotions, his account of their physiological\nunderpinnings is mechanistic. Malebranche too considered the functions\nof the emotions and the way in which that functioning has been\ncorrupted, but emphasized that the emotions are communicated through\nstrictly mechanical operations. Hobbes and Spinoza went yet further,\nrejecting any talk of final causation in order to treat the behavior\nof the emotions as completely continuous with bodily movements, and\nindeed reducing the appearance of goal-driven behavior to the motions\nof the passions. In contrast, Shaftesbury criticized Locke and\nDescartes for failing to appreciate the natural teleology of our\nemotional constitution, and dismissed all physiological accounts as\nbeside the point. Many other British philosophers showed less interest\nin the metaphysics of explanation and more in defending an empiricist\naccount of the origins of our ideas. But the rejection of innate ideas\noften drove them to focus explanations of the emotions on the\nhydraulics by which pains and pleasures push our ideas. This\nnaturalistic approach was particularly marked in eighteenth-century\nassociationist psychology, often hand in hand with\n\u2018Newtonian\u2019 ambitions to produce a \u201cscience of\nman:\u201d examples include Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340), and such lesser-known works as David Hartley\u2019s\nObservations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his\nExpectations (1749) and an anonymous tract of 1741, An\nEnquiry into the Origin of Human Appetites and Affections, Showing How\nEach Arises from Association: for the use of young gentlemen at the\nuniversities (cited in Gardiner 1970, 221), as well as in the\nworks of Condillac.\n\nAs we might expect, emotions loomed large in the philosophical\npsychology of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One question\naddressed by almost every philosopher was where to locate the emotions\nin our psychological equipment. Following Descartes, seventeenth\ncentury philosophers tended to subsume the emotions under perception,\nalthough Hobbes was a bit of an exception, identifying passions with\nthe \u201csmall beginnings\u201d (motives) of voluntary,\n\u201canimal\u201d actions, while finding their origins in sense and\nimagination. \u2018Perception\u2019 must be broadly understood,\nhowever; what is crucial is that the emotions involve the exercise of\na receptive faculty, especially insofar as their causes lie in the\nbody, or more generally, outside of the receptive animal. Spinoza,\nadmittedly, allowed that we may be adequate causes of some of our\naffects, and took all our emotions to involve judgments. But on his\nview, judgments are not different in kind from perceptions, although\ntheir epistemic status depends on whether we are active and adequate,\nor merely passive, inadequate causes of our perceptions. Descartes,\ntoo, attributed a representative structure to emotions that could look\nproto-propositional. This structure, however, is independent of and\nprior to the volitions of assent or denial that generate real\njudgment. The emotions thus remain among the perceptions belonging to\nthe intellect, although they provide material for judgment.\nNonetheless, since perceptions were typically granted a complex\nrepresentational and intentional structure, most seventeenth century\nauthors could draw close connections between emotions and\njudgments.\n\nEighteenth century theorists, on the other hand, often identified\nemotions specifically with sense-perceptions. Indeed, Hutcheson\nmultiplied the number of our sense-faculties to accommodate the wide\nvariety of affects he recognizes, while DuBos spoke of the\n\u201csixth sense\u201d by which we evaluate poetry and painting.\nMany philosophers also supposed a haptic aspect to emotions,\napproaching them as a variety of feeling. Most notably, Hume\nmaintained that a distinctive feature of the passions and sentiments\nis that they touch, or strike upon the mind more forcibly than other\nperceptions.\n\nMore generally, eighteenth-century theories shift gradually from\ncharacterizing emotions primarily by how they represent their\nintentional contents to considering their qualitative phenomenology,\nthe special \u2018feel\u2019 of the emotions. Hume, for one,\nstressed that our passions are \u201csimple and uniform\nimpressions\u201d with characteristic affective qualities Still, this\nis at most a change in emphasis, since many did allow that emotions\ntypically have some kind of object. Hume, in particular, attributed a\nrather complicated structure to the indirect passions that show a\n\u201cdouble relation of impressions and ideas.\u201d But the\natomistic tendencies of British psychology following Locke spelled\ndifficulty for accounts of intentional content, and many philosophers\nemphasized features of our emotions that are non-intentional. Emotions\nstill retained important connections to judgment, however, since\njudgments themselves, especially moral, aesthetic and other\nevaluations, were often considered expressions of sentiment.\n\nFor all their disagreements about the nature of judgment, early modern\nphilosophers reached near-consensus in taking emotion to motivate our\npractical and theoretical endeavors either directly or indirectly.\nBecause they provide, or at least shape, motives for action, the\nemotions were central to investigations of our practical reasoning and\nto moral philosophy. In particular, eighteenth-century spectator- and\njudgment-centered moral theories gave the emotions a double role for\nour moral judgments: insofar as they represent the enduring\ndispositions of character expressed in actions, they are the objects\nof moral evaluations; but they also generate the judgments themselves.\nIn a somewhat different vein, many philosophers took our emotions to\nbe the engine driving our theoretical reasoning: both wonder (for\nDescartes) and curiosity (for Hume) perform this function. Indeed,\nalmost any philosopher investigating efficient causation in our\npsychology found an important place for our emotions, whether Hobbes\nconsidering our internal motions, or the associationist psychologists\nof the eighteenth century.\n\nAs crucial bits of our psychology, the emotions are also important to\nepistemology. Here, though, the position of many early modern\nphilosophers has often been misunderstood, especially when it is\nassumed that they oppose reason to the emotions, to the detriment of\nthe latter. (We might call this the \u2018Mr. Spock\u2019 gloss on\nearly modern philosophy.) It is true that many philosophers held that\nthe emotions can sometimes lead our reasoning astray, and they offer\nvarious epistemic techniques to minimize this cognitive interference.\nMalebranche, for instance, imbedded his account of the passions in the\nreforming project of The Search After Truth (1674\u20135), and\nmany accounts of method, e.g., Arnauld\u2019s and Nicole\u2019s Logic, or\nthe Art of Thinking (1662), or Part II of Mary Astell\u2019s\nSerious Proposal to the Ladies (1697), included an account of\nthe emotions as an indispensable part of their epistemic techniques.\nBut none of these accounts assumed that the emotions are inevitably\ndisruptive to our reason, however important it may be to temper them.\nDescartes particularly emphasized the functionality of our passions,\nfirst for practical, but also for theoretical reasoning, and suggested\nthat proper discipline should allow us to maximize the epistemic value\nof the emotions. Malebranche and Spinoza were less sanguine about our\nchances of doing so, but even Malebranche maintained that the passions\nare functional in several respects. Hobbes, on the other hand, mounted\na number of contrasts between passions and the \u201ccommon\nmeasure\u201d of reason. But these seem somewhat at odds with his\nclaims about the operation of the passions in driving mental activity.\nHere it is worth considering Spinoza\u2019s account of the relation between\nreason and the affects, for it offers a kind of gloss on Hobbes. It\nis, Spinoza maintained, only our passive emotions that can produce\nconflict with the dictates of our reason; our active affects accord\nwell with reason. Hume, of course, denied that it makes any sense to\nspeak of a conflict between reason and passion, when he declared that\nreason not only is, \u201cbut ought only to be\u201d the slave to\nthe passions \u2013 a dictum that seems to apply to theoretical as\nwell as practical reason. Later eighteenth-century philosophers\ndeveloped the view that our reasoning faculties, and particularly our\nlanguage, are a historical development from our emotions; this seems\nto have been the view of Condillac and Rousseau.\n\nOne of the most important contexts for understanding the epistemic\nstrengths and weaknesses attributed to the emotions lies in their\nrelation to the imagination. Accounts of what exactly this faculty is\nchanged dramatically from the seventeenth to the eighteenth centuries,\nbut in one way or another, the emotions were commonly understood to\ninteract closely with the imagination. On some views, the imagination\nprovides a conduit between the emotions and the body. Both pre-modern\nand modern folk medicine held that experiencing strong emotions could\naffect the imagination of a pregnant woman in such a way as to leave\nmarks on her fetus. Indeed, so close was the connection supposed to be\nthat simply imagining emotionally-fraught situations could mark the\ndevelopment of the fetus, and there was a substantial literature of\neighteenth-century manuals instructing mothers-to-be on the proper\ncontrol of their affective states. (See Smith 2006 and Kukla 2005.)\nDescartes made mention of such views, and more generally saw the\nimagination as an important tool for managing the emotions: picturing\nthings in the imagination could have affective results, so\nmanipulating the imagination is an effective way of controlling our\nemotions and their effects. The view taken of the interaction between\nemotions and imagination changed with shifts in how the faculty of the\nimagination \u2013 and the relation between mind and body in general\n\u2013 were understood. Hume, for instance, considered the\nimagination to be the faculty of composing, decomposing, and\nassociating ideas, in contrast to the impressions among which passions\nwere numbered. Nonetheless, there is still some role for the\nimagination in producing and manipulating affects, and vice-versa. The\nimagination is also a crucial mechanism in the social communication of\nthe passions, a topic considered by both Malebranche and Hume.\n\nThe physiology of the emotions and their implications for medicine was\nanother important theme in early modern philosophy. (Here too the\nimagination has a role to play.) Descartes considered the emotions\ncentral to the treatment of both mental and bodily illness. In doing\nso, he joined a long and popular medical tradition treating the\nemotions, including Robert Burton\u2019s Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) and William Falconer\u2019s A Dissertation on the Influence of\nthe Passions upon the Disorders of the Body (1788). Burton\u2019s work\nwas conservative, if eclectic, in its approach to understanding the\nsoul and using the machinery of humours and spirits to explain emotion\nand temperament. But many other writers borrowed piecemeal from the\nlanguage of humours and spirits, sometimes embedding it in new\nphysiological accounts, sometimes simply using it to describe various\naffects. Descartes and Malebranche, for instance, spoke of the animal\nspirits, but also used such new tools as Harvey\u2019s discovery of the\ncirculation of the blood to explain the bodily effects of\nemotions.\n\nThe affective aspects of mental disorders are matters of particular\ninterest. Some of that interest may have been personal, since\n\u2018melancholy\u2019 was widely taken to be a special affliction\nof the learned, a point that puts some of Hume\u2019s discussion of the\nemotional effects of skepticism in context. \u2018Enthusiasm,\u2019\nparticularly religious enthusiasm, also garnered a great deal of\nattention, considered as a matter of excessive and contagious emotion\nthat could be based in bodily disorders. But since many philosophers\nof the eighteenth century followed Shaftesbury in refusing to consider\nthe physiology of the emotions, they relegated the bodily causes,\ncomponents and effects to the attention of \u2018anatomists,\u2019\nrather than of philosophers. More generally, the sort of humour-driven\napproach to medicine and pathology that informed many\nseventeenth-century accounts of the emotions declined among eighteenth\ncentury philosophers.\n\nSome of the most important issues raised by the emotions in early\nmodern philosophy are practical, especially those concerning practical\nreason, the pursuit of happiness and moral philosophy. As we have\nseen, the emotions were generally tied closely to motivations for\naction. They are not necessarily the only, or the immediate sources of\nmotivation: Descartes and Malebranche considered reason to offer\nmotivations of its own, as did Pascal, who also admitted yet other\nsources of motivation. But many other philosophers, such as Hobbes,\nHutcheson and Hume took the emotions to be the driving source of our\npractical reason. None of them, however, maintained that the emotions\nwere immune to training and refinement, and indeed all early modern\nphilosophers took it as important for both morality and happiness that\nwe do train our emotions. The practical philosophies offered by\nDescartes, Malebranche and Spinoza are particularly concerned with the\npursuit of happiness, which they assume involves both managing and\ncultivating the emotions. Both Descartes and Spinoza sought\n\u201cremedies\u201d for the passions, which they take to be central\nto what Descartes called \u201cpursuing virtue\u201d and Spinoza\n\u201cfreedom from bondage.\u201d Spinoza criticized Descartes for\nthinking that such remedy could provide complete control, but they\nshared the view that remediated emotions are crucial to the good life,\nconceived both eudaimonistically and morally. Malebranche considered\ncorrupted passions to be \u201cinordinate\u201d and in need of\nregulation, a bit of language that Norris and Astell later picked up,\nalthough with less emphasis on the perversion of order through\nsin.\n\nThe pursuit of happiness was also an issue for British philosophers\nsuch as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, although it sometimes paled next to\ntheir interests in moral evaluation. Shaftesbury argued vehemently\nthat \u201cvirtue and interest coincide,\u201d because he maintained\nthat happiness depends on a preponderance of pleasant affects, and the\nemotions carrying moral worth are themselves pleasant. To this end, he\nintroduced a notion of the \u201ceconomy\u201d of the passions\n(Inquiry 198). Yet he had to argue the point, since he did\nnot understand virtue primarily in terms of individual flourishing,\nbut within an overall economy and balance of nature. Hutcheson also\nconsidered how the passions contribute or detract from our happiness.\nAnd like Shaftesbury, he speaks of our search for a \u201cjust\nBallance and Oeconomy\u201d (Essay 47), in which our\npassions and affections are properly governed, although he takes\nachieving such economy to be difficult. Hutcheson\u2019s talk of\n\u201cthe government of the passions\u201d (see Essay 66)\nthus looks a bit different from the command that the passions in\ngeneral should be governed, a theme found in a number of sermons (see,\ne.g., Ayloffe, Clarke). Instead, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume\nincorporated the emotions into their efforts to explain how we make\njudgments of moral worth on the basis of our moral senses. It is our\nemotions that allow us to be responsive to the moral qualities we\nevaluate. For this reason, they may all seem committed to a\n\u2018sentimentalist\u2019 moral philosophy. Hutcheson and Hume did\nindeed oppose the moral \u2018rationalists,\u2019 arguing that there\nis no independent quality in actions or persons to which emotions are\nsensitive. But their position presupposes a very particular\nunderstanding of the nature of our senses and of the ontological\nstatus of the secondary qualities to which they are receptive. In\ncontrast, Shaftesbury often suggests both that there are moral and\naesthetic qualities intrinsic to the external world, and that we\naccess those qualities through our emotions. On this view, our\nemotions, at least when functioning as they should, are simply our\nnatural equipment for picking up salient features of the world.\n\nEarly modern philosophy held a special place for the emotions in its\npolitical and social theory (see Kahn, Saccamano & Coli, 2006).\nIndeed, there was a popular early modern genre of \u2018how-to\u2019\nbooks about techniques for governing others by managing their\nemotions. Likewise, a great deal of political philosophy concerned the\nmanagement of the emotions by social institutions and authorities,\nwith Hobbes and Mandeville being just two of the most obvious\nexamples. Hume picks up on the language of remedying our emotions to\ndiscuss how practices of justice and institutions of magistracy\nremediate our partial affections (see T 489). But there are also\ndeeper issues about what role the emotions might play in making social\norder possible. Many philosophers held that the emotions facilitated\nsocial interaction: Descartes suggested something of the sort in his\nanalyses of such passions as love and generosity. Malebranche was even\nmore clearly committed to the view, holding that the communication of\nthe emotions is crucial to social organization, ranking and cohesion.\nHobbes and Spinoza, in contrast, found the grounds of much\ninterpersonal conflict in the emotions, and even diagnosed specific\nemotions as inherently disruptive to social order, e.g., glory for\nHobbes. But by the same token, there are many passions that Hobbes\nstated \u201cincline us to peace,\u201d and Spinoza allowed that\ninsofar as people agree in affects, they agree in nature.\nEighteenth-century philosophers tended to evaluate the social effects\nof the emotions in terms of whether they were self- or other-directed,\nwith Shaftesbury and Hutcheson arguing against Mandeville that our\nmost natural emotions were other-directed. In his Philosophical\nEnquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\n(1759), Edmund Burke distinguished between the passions directed at\nself-preservation and those belonging to society, but spends the\nlion\u2019s share of his time on the latter. The issue is somewhat more\ncomplicated in Hume, but he does seem to take the development of our\nemotions and their susceptibility to a standard of appropriateness to\nbe indispensable to many of the \u201cartifices\u201d that make\nsocial life possible. A different twist is provided by Rousseau\u2019s\ncontrast between two kinds of self-directed affection, amour de\nsoi and amour propre, of which the former, but not the\nlatter seems consistent with compassion for others.\n\nThe place of the emotions in early modern aesthetic theories deserves\na separate treatment. The representation of the emotions was\nconsidered a proper object, sometimes the object, of\naesthetic criticism. It was also the subject of many practical manuals\nin the arts; there is, for instance, an extensive seventeenth-century\nliterature stemming from discussions in the French Royal Academy of\nPainting and Sculpture about how to depict facial expressions and\nbodily gestures in ways that would allow the deciphering of emotional\nstates. Here the representation of the emotions serves both narrative\nand didactic purposes.\n\nAnother commonplace of early modern aesthetics was the importance of\nexciting emotions in the audience for a work of art. This is a common\ntheme in musical aesthetics, which borrowed heavily from rhetorical\ntreatises. Baroque composers developed an entire theory of affects,\nand of musical figures to express those affects, for just this end.\n(See the Grove Dictionary of Music.) Another version of this\ntheme appears in philosophical discussions of tragedy; since it is\nassumed that the dramatic depiction of emotions excites the same\nemotions in the audience, tragic drama presents a bit of a puzzle. It\nseems odd that we should enjoy the experience, and even enjoy it in\nproportion to the distress it invokes. Malebranche, Hutcheson and Hume\nare just a few to address this puzzle by developing accounts of the\nmeta-pleasures afforded to us by the exercise of our emotions.\n\nEighteenth-century aesthetics moved away somewhat from the view that\nthe arts should carefully control our emotions, although the notion\nthat artworks both express and excite emotions remained. Particularly\ninteresting in this regard is the development of the concept of the\nsublime. As Burke explains it, the experience of the sublime\ntransgresses categories of pain and pleasure and explains much of our\nresponse to dramatic tragedy. Here it seems that aesthetic, and other\ndistinctive experiences can produce emotions that are sui\ngeneris, a view that gives aesthetics a particular importance for\nany understanding of the emotions.\n\nSeveral of the most important discussions of the emotions in the early\nmodern period involved women, who sometimes raised specific concerns\nrelevant to their status as women. That is the case with Princess\nElisabeth of Bohemia, whose correspondence pushed Descartes to write\non the passions, while pursuing a lengthy discussion of the impact of\nthe emotions on health and reasoning and our ability to control them.\nElisabeth also seems to have inspired other writers on the emotions,\nserving as the dedicatee for the Treatise of the Passions and\nFaculties of the Soul of Man (1640) of Edward Reynolds, the\nBishop of Norwich. Both Mary Astell in Letters Concerning the Love\nof God (1695) and Damaris Cudworth, Lady Masham, in Discourse\nConcerning the Love of God (1696) took issue with the\nMalebranchean account of love offered by John Norris, albeit to very\ndifferent degrees and from different approaches. Later in the\neighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s criticisms of Rousseau\nspecifically addressed some of his views about emotional development\nand the sexual division of labor in the sentimental education of\nchildren. However, since some recent commentators have turned to early\nmodern discussions to understand how the emotions can be conceptually\ngendered, we should note that many women philosophers of this period\nshowed no unusual interest in the emotions. It does not seem to have\nbeen considered a special area of expertise for women.\n\nAlthough early modern philosophy did not seem to associate concepts of\nthe emotions as such with gender, there is still a great deal of\ngender-baggage to investigate. Many authors took the position that\nthere were important sexual differences in the disposition to feel\nspecific emotions. Malebranche allowed that there are many such\ndifferences, not just between the sexes, but for different ages,\nfortunes and stations in life; indeed, it is differences between\nindividuals\u2019 \u201cstations in life\u201d that do the most work for\nhim in explaining variations in affective susceptibilities. Other\nauthors laid such variations at the doorstep of bodily composition,\nespecially the constitution of the brain, and took the relevant\ndifferences to be especially and intrinsically marked between the\nsexes (although they could also typify class and rank). In Les\nCharacteres des Passions (1648\u201362), Marin Cureau de la Chambre\ndiscussed the effects that the liquid humours in the brain could have\non emotional temperament, taking it as an explanation of why some\npeople (women, as well as children and drunkards) cry more readily\nthan others.\n\nSome more distinctively gendered and more evaluatively loaded claims\nabout the emotions appeared in the eighteenth century, particularly in\naesthetic theory. Shaftesbury is a bit of a villain here, contrasting\ntrue taste with the trivial sentiments of merely feminine taste. Some\nauthors even distinguished aesthetic qualities and emotions through\ngendered contrasts, as when feminine beauty is opposed to the\nmasculine sublime (with, of course, the preference going to the\nsublime). By the end of the eighteenth century, Wollstonecraft\nbemoaned that women socialized to be ladies fall \u201cmore under the\ninfluence of sentiments than passions,\u201d suggesting a gendered\ndivision between sentiment and passion echoed in several other\npassages in the work (1792, 49). But that is not a contrast found in\nmany earlier authors.\n\nThe emotions did, however, play a special role for some philosophers\nwho defended women\u2019s intellectual aptitude. Feminist philosophers such\nas Fran\u00e7ois Poulain de la Barre and Mary Astell appealed to the\nemotions both to explain sexist prejudice and to make their case for\nwomen\u2019s pursuit of philosophy. Poulain de la Barre traces misogynist\nridicule to surprise at the unfamiliar in his On the Equality of\nthe Two Sexes (1673), while his On the Education of Ladies\n(1674) illustrates how women can develop the assurance and\nself-trust needed for the intellectual life. Astell posits the\ncultivation of the intellect, along with the development of\n\u201cgenerosity\u201d and \u201cto be passionately in Love with Truth\u201d (2002, 165)\nas the most important means to regulate the passions. In contrast, she\noften pairs \u201cprejudices\u201d and \u201cirregular passions\u201d as the obstacles for\npersons generally and women in particular that her serious proposals\nseek to overcome.\n3.
