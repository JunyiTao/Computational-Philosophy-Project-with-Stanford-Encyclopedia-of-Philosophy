    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhen the well-known political theorist Leo Strauss introduced the\ntopic of politics and religion in his reflections, he presented it as a\nproblem\u2014the \u201ctheologico-political problem\u201d he called\nit (Strauss\n 1997).[1]\nThe problem, says Strauss, is primarily\none about authority: Is political authority to be grounded in the\nclaims of revelation or reason, Jerusalem or Athens? In so\ncharacterizing the problem, Strauss was tapping into currents of\nthought deep in the history of political reflection in the west, ones\nabout the nature, extent, and justification of political\nauthority. Do monarchies owe their authority to divine\nright? Has God delegated to secular rulers such as kings and\nemperors the authority to wage war in order to achieve religious\naims: the conversion of the infidel or the repulsion of unjust attacks\non the true faith? Do secular rulers have the authority to suppress\nheretics? What authority does the state retain when its principles\nconflict with God's? Is the authority of the natural law ultimately\ngrounded in divine law? These and other questions animated much of the\ndiscussion among medieval and modern philosophers alike.\n\n\nWith the emergence of liberal democracy in the modern west, however,\nthe types of questions that philosophers asked about the interrelation\nbetween religion and political authority began to shift, in large\nmeasure because the following three-fold dynamic was at work. In the\nfirst place, divine-authorization accounts of political authority had\nlost the day to consent-based approaches. Political authority in a\nliberal democracy, most prominent defenders of liberal democracy\nclaimed, is grounded in the consent of the people to be ruled rather\nthan in God's act of authorization. Second, the effects of the\nProtestant Reformation had made themselves felt acutely, as the\nbroadly homogeneous religious character of Western Europe\ndisintegrated into competing religious communities. The population of\nWestern Europe and the United States were now not only considerably\nmore religiously diverse, but also deeply wary of the sort of\nbloodshed occasioned by the so-called religious wars. And, finally,\nsecularization had begun to take hold. Both the effects of religious\ndiversity and prominent attacks on the legitimacy of religious belief\nensured that one could no longer assume in political discussion that\none's fellow citizens were religious, let alone members of one's own\nreligious tradition.\n\n\n For citizens of contemporary liberal\ndemocracies, this three-fold dynamic has yielded a curious\nsituation. On the one hand, most take it for granted that the\nauthority of the state is located in the people, that the people are\nreligiously diverse, and that important segments of people doubt the\nrationality of religious belief and practice of any sort. On the\nother hand, contrary to the predictions of many advocates of\nsecularization theory, such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and (at one time)\nPeter Berger, this mix of democracy, religious diversity, and religious\ncriticism has not resulted in the disappearance or privatization of\nreligion. Religion, especially in liberal democracies such as the\nUnited States, is alive and well, shaping political culture in numerous\nways. Consequently, there very much remains a\ntheologico-political problem. The problem, moreover, still\nconcerns political authority, though now reframed by the transition to\nliberal democracy. If recent reflection on the issue is any\nguide, the most pressing problem to address is this: Given that\nstate-authorized coercion needs to be justified, and that the\njustification of state coercion requires the consent of the people,\nwhat role may religious reasons play in justifying state\ncoercion? More specifically, in a religiously pluralistic context\nsuch as one finds in contemporary liberal democracies, are religious\nreasons sufficient to justify a coercive law for which reasonable\nagents cannot find an adequate secular rationale?\n\n\nThis entry considers the most important answers to these questions\noffered by recent philosophers, political theorists, and\ntheologians. We present these answers as part of a lively three-way\ndiscussion between advocates of what we call the standard view, their\nliberal critics, and proponents of the so-called New\nTraditionalism. Briefly stated, advocates of the standard view argue\nthat in contemporary liberal democracies, significant restraints must\nbe put on the political role of religious reasons. Their liberal\ncritics deny this, or at least deny that good reasons have been given\nto believe this. New Traditionalists, by contrast, turn their back on\nboth the standard view and its liberal critics, arguing that religious\northodoxy and liberal democracy are fundamentally incompatible. To\nhave a grip on this three-way debate, we suggest, is to understand\nthat dimension of the theologico-political problem that most animates\nphilosophical reflection in liberal democracies on the relation\nbetween religion and politics.\n",
