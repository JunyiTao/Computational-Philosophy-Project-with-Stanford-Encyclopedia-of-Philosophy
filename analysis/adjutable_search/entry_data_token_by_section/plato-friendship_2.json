    "main_text": "Loving Socrates\n3. Loving Socrates\n\nAt the beginning of the Symposium, an unidentified man wants\nto hear what was said about love by Socrates and the others at\nAgathon\u2019s house. He has heard a garbled account. Now he wants\nApollodorus to tell him what was really said. But Apollodorus\nwasn\u2019t there either. He got his account of the proceedings\nsecond-hand from Aristodemus. All these men who ought to be chasing\nboys are presented as so besotted with Socrates and his conversations\nthat one of them\u2014Apollodorus\u2014makes it his business to know\nexactly what Socrates does and says each day (172c4\u20136), while\nanother\u2014Aristodemus\u2014is so far gone in his passion for\nSocrates that he walks barefoot like his beloved (173b1\u20134). One\nreason for this complex set-up is to let us see the inverting impact\nof Socrates\u2014and so of philosophy\u2014on Athenian paiderastic\nnorms. Another is more subtle. Alcibiades\u2019 love for Socrates\nfocuses on the beautiful figures of virtue which he thinks he sees\nlying beneath those \u201cwords as coarse as the hides worn by the\nmost vulgar satyrs,\u201d which are the analog for him of\nSocrates\u2019 ugly, satyr-like body (215b3-4). Aristodemus\u2019\nlove for Socrates, by contrast, seems to focus on his coarse exterior,\nso that Aristodemus himself is a sort of inverted Alcibiades, whose\nvery name associates him with Pausanias\u2019 body-centered goddess\nof love, Pand\u00eamos. Loving Socrates, we may infer, is a\ncomplex business, since just what someone loves in loving him is tied\nto that person\u2019s peculiar desires, and the limits they impose on\nhow like Socrates he can become.\n\nIn the dialogue\u2019s next few scenes, this point is driven home.\nWhen Aristodemus meets him, Socrates has just bathed and put on his\nfancy sandals\u2014\u201cboth very unusual events\u201d\n(174a3\u20134). Aristodemus remarks on this because he is naturally\nsensitive to those aspects of Socrates which he himself\u2014perhaps\nbecause of his own size and appearance (173b2)\u2014has chosen to\nemulate. The reason for the departure from his usual habits, Socrates\nexplains, is that he is going to Agathon\u2019s party and wants\n\u201cbeauty to go to beauty\u201d (174a9). Oddly, this\ndoesn\u2019t stop him from bringing Aristodemus\u2014un-bathed,\nun-sandaled, un-beautiful\u2014along. But what is odd from the point\nof view of Socrates\u2019 self-ascribed motivations is not\nat all odd from that of Plato\u2019s. He has now made the\ncomplexity of Socrates\u2014his beautiful insides and ugly outsides\nor vice versa\u2014as dramatically present to our eyes as to those of\nAgathon and his other guests.\n\nSocrates is invited to Agathon\u2019s\u2014Goodman\u2019s.\n(\u2018Agathon\u2019 means good in Greek.) He thinks\u2014wrongly\nas it happens\u2014that Aristodemus isn\u2019t invited, but offers\nto take him along anyway. Aristodemus\u2019\nreply\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say\u201d\n(174b2)\u2014again connects him to Alcibiades: \u201cI just had to\ndo whatever he told me\u201d (217a1\u20132). \u201cCome with me\nthen,\u201d Socrates responds, \u201cand we shall prove the proverb\nwrong; the truth is, \u2018Good men go uninvited to Goodman\u2019s\nfeast\u2019\u201d\n (174b4\u20135).[1]\n Aristodemus is not convinced. \u201cSocrates, I\u2019m\nafraid\u2026 mine is the case of an inferior arriving uninvited at\nthe table of a wise man\u201d (174c5\u20137). The familiar Socratic\ntri-unity\u2014good, beautiful, wise\u2014are all now in play.\n\nDespite his reservations, Aristodemus agrees to accompany\nSocrates\u2014but with an important proviso: \u201cSee what defense\nyou\u2019re going to make (apolog\u00eas\u00ea) for\nbringing me along, because I won\u2019t admit I came uninvited,\nI\u2019ll say you brought me!\u201d (174c7-d1). It is this proviso\nthat initiates the next mystifying episode. It begins when Socrates\nreplies by under-quoting Homer: \u201cWe\u2019ll take counsel about\nwhat to say \u2018when two go together along the way\u2019\u201d\n(174d2\u20133). What he leaves out is what happens when two\ndo go together, namely, \u201cone of them knows before the\nother\u201d (Iliad X. 24). The elision of this phrase is\nmatched by an elision of Plato\u2019s own. For what happened on the\nroad to Agathon\u2019s is that \u201cSocrates began to think about\nsomething, lost himself in thought, and kept lagging behind\u201d\n(174d4\u20137). Yet we are never told what he thought\nabout\u2014what it was that one knew before the other.\n\nThat the match between these two elisions is significant is\nestablished by another match: the one between the defense Socrates\ndoesn\u2019t give for bringing Aristodemus to Agathon\u2019s and the\none he doesn\u2019t give before the jury in 399 B.C., when he is on\ntrial for corrupting the youth. I mean, the defense Socrates\u2019\nfamiliar spirit or daimonion prevents him from giving by not\npreventing him from giving the one in which he speaks and acts in his\nown accustomed elenctic way\u2014in which he plays the part of\nhimself (Ap. 40a2-b6). Later in the Symposium, the\nmatch is reestablished by the close parallels between the preamble to\nSocrates\u2019 speech in praise of Er\u00f4s and that to\nhis speech before the jury. There he is \u201camazed\n(ethaumasa)\u201d by what his accusers say (Ap.\n17a4\u20135); here Agathon\u2019s speech is \u201camazing\n(thaumasta)\u201d (Smp. 198b4). There he\nisn\u2019t a clever (deinos) speaker, unless cleverness\nconsists in speaking the truth (Ap. 17a4-b6). Here he\nisn\u2019t clever in the art of love unless encomia to\nEr\u00f4s involve telling the truth about it (Smp.\n198c5\u2013199a6). There \u201cwhat the jurors will hear will be\nspoken extemporaneously (epituchousin) in whatever words come\nto mind\u201d (Ap. 17c1\u20132); here the symposiasts will\n\u201chear the truth spoken about Er\u00f4s in such words\nand arrangements as occur to me extemporaneously (tuch\u00ea\nepelthousa)\u201d (Smp. 199b3\u20135). Whatever\noccupies Socrates on the road to Agathon\u2019s, we may infer, ends\nnot in the knowledge Homer is so confident either he or Aristodemus\nwill have, but in the aporetic awareness of the absence of knowledge\nthat distinguishes Socrates\u2019 \u201chuman wisdom\u201d from the\n\u201cmore than human wisdom\u201d claimed by the sophists\n(Ap. 20c4-e8).\n\nThe result of Socrates\u2019 losing his way in thought and ending up\nstymied in Agathon\u2019s neighbor\u2019s porch is that Aristodemus,\nlike a proper Socratic paraclete, arrives at Agathon\u2019s quite a\nbit before Socrates. When Socrates finally does arrive in propria\nperson, Agathon says: \u201cSocrates, come lie down next to me.\nWho knows, if I touch you, I may catch a bit of the wisdom that came\nto you under my neighbor\u2019s porch\u201d (175c7-d1). Socrates\nreplies with an obviously sexual simile, which acknowledges, so as\nlater once again to invert, paiderastic norms: \u201cIf only wisdom\nwere like water which always flows from a full cup into an empty one\nwhen we connect them with a piece of yarn. If wisdom were that way\ntoo, I value the place beside you very much indeed; for I think I will\nbe filled from you with wisdom of great beauty\u201d (175d4-e2). What\nactually happens, however, is the very reverse. Socrates responds to\nAgathon\u2019s fancy speech about love with an elenchus, so that his\nemptiness, his lack of knowledge, flows into Agathon, destroying the\nwisdom of great beauty that had won his tragedy a first prize the day\nbefore (175e4\u20137).\n",
