Life\n\nDamascius, in his Philosophical History (aka Life of\nIsidore) describes Syrianus as a strikingly handsome and tall man\nwith impressive intellectual powers. The son of an otherwise unknown\nPhiloxenus, he grew up in Alexandria, where he must have received an\neducation in rhetoric and perhaps some philosophy. In the second half\nof the 4th century, Alexandria had become increasingly\nburdened by strife between her pagan elite and a notoriously\nquarrelsome Christian populace. The mathematician Theon of Alexandria\n(c. 335\u2013405) and his daughter Hypatia, who was killed by\nagitating Christians in 415, were the most prominent pagan\nintellectuals in Alexandria during Syrianus\u2019 life. We do not\nknow when exactly Syrianus decided to go to Athens to study with\nPlutarch and to dedicate himself to philosophy; it appears, however,\nthat Syrianus spent the rest of his active life in Athens as a close\nassociate of Plutarch and, eventually, as his successor. If the\nattribution of the commentary on Hermogenes is correct (see section 3b\nbelow), we may infer that Syrianus was married, since that commentary\nis dedicated to its author\u2019s son Alexander. Archeological\nevidence suggests that Plutarch and Syrianus, and later Proclus, lived\nand taught in a complex of houses near the theater of Dionysus at the\nsouth slope of the Acropolis, not at the site now known as the\noriginal location of Plato\u2019s Academy outside the ancient\ncity\u2019s walls. According to Marinus (in his Life of\nProclus, 36), Syrianus was buried on the slopes of Mount\nLycabettus in Athens.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the political and cultural landscape of the Roman\nEmpire changed dramatically and irrevocably for pagan intellectuals,\nand it did so in disturbing ways. Politically, the Roman Empire was\nshaken to its foundation by the massive incursion of Gothic tribes\ninto northern Greece (Thrace) and their decisive victory over the\nimperial army at Adrianople (modern Edirne) in 378. Under Theodosius\nI, who reigned from 379 to 395, Christianity became the state\nreligion, and in order to strengthen the adopted Nicene orthodoxy, the\nemperor sought to curtail heresy of any form, both Christian and\npagan.\n\nIn 425, a few years before Syrianus assumed leadership of the Academy,\nemperor Theodosius II and his wife Eudocia (a well-educated Christian\nconvert and daughter of Leontius, a pagan educator at Athens who was\nin a sense a colleague of Syrianus\u2019) founded what came to be the\nUniversity of Constantinople. In consequence, higher education in\nRhetoric, Law and Philosophy was thereby placed under the\npatronage\u2014and supervision\u2014of the court. The survival of a\nprivate institution such as the Athenian School, in contrast, depended\nmuch on the capability, personality, and commitment of its individual\nmembers. It is in this context that we have to understand the sense of\nexcitement and relief that prevailed (as Marinus relates in his\nLife of Proclus) when Proclus (410/2\u2013485), a young\ncommitted pagan intellectual, arrived in Athens to join the school in\n431. At first, Syrianus was suspicious of the new arrival, but when he\nobserved Proclus openly worshiping the Moon, he agreed to accept him.\nEventually, Marinus says, Syrianus \u201cfound in him the disciple\nand successor he had long been looking for\u201d (Life 12).\nProclus succeeded Syrianus as head of the School in 437, at the mere\nage of about twenty-six, while Syrianus\u2019 other, most talented\nstudent Domninus, who was Jewish, returned to his home town\nLarissa.\n\nFrom Marinus we can gather some further evidence about Syrianus as a\nteacher. Whereas Plutarch had introduced the \u201cfreshman\u201d\nProclus to somewhat more accessible works such as Aristotle\u2019s\nDe anima and Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Syrianus, once he\nhad taken over instruction from Plutarch, subjected Proclus to a much\nmore rigorous and systematic philosophical training. In quick\nsuccession, they read practically the entire Aristotelian corpus\ntogether (\u201cAristotle\u2019s treatises on logic, ethics,\npolitics, physics and \u2026 theology,\u201d presumably in that\norder) in preparation for the study of Plato and, eventually, the\nOrphic Poems and Chaldaean Oracles. Syrianus gave Aristotle a firm\nplace and function in the philosophical-theological curriculum of a\nstudent of Platonism; however, as we shall see, this yoking together\nof Aristotle to Plato did not entail endorsement of the doctrine that\nthe views of the two ancestral philosophers were in complete harmony.\n\n2. Testimonia of Syrianus\u2019 literary work\n\nApart from the texts written by Syrianus that survive and are\ndiscussed in more detail under (3) below, there is evidence for a much\nwider literary output. According to the Suda, a\n10th century Byzantine encyclopedia, Syrianus wrote seven\nbooks of commentary on Homer, four on Plato\u2019s Republic,\ntwo on the theology of Orpheus as well as treatises on the Homeric\nGods, on the agreement of Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato on the subject\nof oracles (in no less than ten books), and other exegetical works.\nThis list is evidently not complete because it fails to mention any\nwork on Aristotle; nor do we have any means of verifying the\nattribution of these works to Syrianus. As such, it would not be\nunusual at all for a Platonic philosopher to write commentaries on\nHomer and Orphic poetry, given that these early literary texts were\nthought to be replete with hidden meaning and arcane revelations.\nMoreover, shortly before his death Syrianus offered Proclus and\nDomninus a course on either the Chaldean Oracles or the Orphic\nPoems.\n\nSyrianus\u2019 commentaries were greatly admired by later generations\nof Neoplatonists (Isidore and Damascius regarded him as one of the\nbest exegetes), and he is therefore often referred to and quoted.\nCollecting these references, R.L. Cardullo (1985) inferred that, apart\nfrom the extant work on the Metaphysics, Syrianus commented\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior Analytics, Physics, De caelo, and\nDe anima. Asclepius of Tralles (mid 6th century),\nin his commentary on the Metaphysics, preserves two fragments\nof Syrianus\u2019 exegesis of book VII (Z) of that work. There is\nalso evidence (in Proclus) that Syrianus commented on Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus and Parmenides, but it is not clear whether\nthese comments were formally composed, or circulated merely within the\nschool as transcripts of his lectures.\n3. The surviving works\n3.1 Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, Books III, IV, XIII, XIV\n\nSyrianus\u2019 work on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics is\ntransmitted in some 18 manuscripts dating from the 15th and\n16th centuries, two of which, Parisinus Graecus\n1896 and Hamburgensis phil. gr. 2, are superior to the\nothers. The extant text does not offer a unified and comprehensive\ninterpretation of the Metaphysics. For one thing, the\ncommentary covers only four of the fourteen treatises that now make up\nthe collection of work that came \u201cafter the\nPhysics\u201d. In addition, Syrianus\u2019 work is a\ncollection of three separate essays of quite different character and\npurpose, one essay on the aporetic book III (=Beta), one on\nbook IV (=Gamma), and one on books XIII and XIV (=Mu\nand Nu). Already the titles of these separate parts\n(regardless of whether they are Syrianus\u2019 own) indicate the\ndifferences:\n\nThe first essay is entitled \u201cSyrianus, the Son of Philoxenus,\nabout the Logical Difficulties and Topics Requiring Discussion in Book\nBeta of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d. It\nbegins, unusually, with hardly any introductory remarks at all. There\nis only a swift recapitulation of the subject-matter of books I and II\n(\u0391 and little \u03b1) of the Metaphysics. This\nsuggests that Syrianus had covered those books in earlier lectures.\nTypically of him, Syrianus goes through the aporiae raised by\nAristotle on the subject-matter and methodology of \u2018first\nphilosophy\u2019, one by one, and in each case explains briefly how\nhe himself thinks these difficulties ought to be resolved,\nnot how Aristotle resolves them in subsequent books of the\nMetaphysics.\n\nThe second, very short essay is entitled \u201cA Course\n(ephodos) by Syrianus, the Son of Philoxenus, on Book\nGamma of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d. This\nbook of the Metaphysics begins with an exposition of first\nphilosophy as dealing with being in general, that is, with what is\ninsofar as it has being, as well as the properties that belong in and\nof itself to anything that has being. Aristotle then continues with a\ndefense of the Law of Non-Contradiction (for any proposition\nP, it is not the case that both P and\nnot-P) being one of these properties. Syrianus discusses each\nof these main topics of the book, but keeps his own comments short\nbecause, as he says, the book \u201chas already been sufficiently\nelucidated by the most diligent Alexander (of Aphrodisias)\u201d (54,\n12f).\n\nThe third treatise is entitled \u201cInvestigations\n(episkepseis) by Syrianus, the Son of Philoxenus, into the\nDifficulties Aristotle Raises About Mathematics and Numbers in Books\nMu and Nu of the Metaphysics.\u201d This\nlong defense of Platonism and Pythagoreanism against Aristotle\u2019s\nincisive criticism is by far the most instructive part of\nSyrianus\u2019 work. It is worth quoting the introduction to this\npolemical essay in full because it throws some light on the careful\nway in which Syrianus calibrates his opposition to Aristotle. Syrianus\nwrites In metaph 80, 4\u201381, 6:\n\nI am not a natural controversialist, nor yet would I count myself as a\ndisciple of Aristotle on merely a few or trivial topics; rather, I am\none of those who admire both his logical methodology overall and who\naccept with enthusiasm his treatment of ethical and physical\nquestions. And that I may not make a bore of myself by enumerating in\ndetail all the excellent aspects of this man\u2019s philosophy, let\nme just ask why every intelligent person might not justly marvel at\nthe apt remarks, accompanied by demonstrations of the highest quality,\nto be found in this most excellent treatise on the subject of both\nforms in matter and definitions, and on the subject of the divine and\nunmoved transcendent causal principles of the whole cosmos\u2014even\nthough they are beyond the reach of any synthetic treatment and very\ndetailed exposition\u2014and declare the author of such a\nphilosophical enquiry a benefactor of human life. For all he is owed\nthe warmest thanks both from us and from all those who can appreciate\nhis sagacity.\n\n\nHowever, it is the fact that, for whatever reasons, both in other\nparts of his theological treatise and especially in the last two\nbooks, 13 and 14, he has indulged in a good deal of criticism of the\nfirst principles of the Pythagoreans and the Platonists, without\nsaying anything pertinent or adequate against them, and in many\ninstances, if one may state the truth quite frankly, not even meeting\nthem on their own ground, but rather basing his objections on\nhypotheses propounded by himself. Because of this it seemed reasonable\n(in fairness to the less sophisticated students, that under the\ninfluence of the well-deserved reputation of the man they may not be\nseduced into contempt for divine realities and the inspired philosophy\nof the ancients) to examine his remarks critically and at the same\ntime impartially as best we can, and to demonstrate that the doctrines\nof Pythagoras and Plato about the first principles remain free of\ndisproof or refutation, while the arguments of Aristotle against them\nfor the most part miss the mark and pursue lines of inquiry quite\nirrelevant to those divine men, while on the few occasions when they\nseek to make a direct attack on them, they are unable to bring to bear\nany refutation, large or small. And necessarily so; for \u2018truth\nis never refuted\u2019, in the words of that divine man (i.e. Plato,\ncf. Gorg., 473B), and in assimilating their arguments about\nfirst principles to the realities, the fathers of those arguments\nestablished them \u2018as firmly and unshakably as it is proper for\narguments to be\u2019 (Tim., 29B7\u20138). Now that is\nenough by way of preface. (transl. Dillon and O\u2019Meara, modified)\n\n\nIt is necessary to decode some of these remarks in order more fully to\nunderstand the delicate position Syrianus is in: \u201cLess\nsophisticated students\u201d (presumably the sons and daughters of\nthe educated class that became increasingly tempted by the new\nreligion) have at least been clever enough to notice that Aristotle\nappears to make short work of some fundamental Platonic commitments\nabout first principles; this in turn could \u201cseduce\u201d them\ninto disparaging the \u201cinspired philosophy of the ancients\u201d\n(i.e. paganism). In order to defend paganism, Syrianus finds that he\nhas to attack Aristotle, and he is clearly not comfortable doing this.\nWhat precisely was at stake for him?\n\nThe later Platonists shared an important commitment with orthodox\nChristianity, viz. to understand and explain the world in its entirety\non the assumption of one principle only, not two principles that could\nbe thought to be in opposition or conflict with one another\n(Gnosticism). Christians and Platonists also agreed on the assumption\nthat the first principle itself cannot be part of the natural world\nbut must be a transcendent entity whose existence is wholly\nindependent of and prior to this world, and upon which the\nworld\u2019s existence wholly depends. But unlike Christian thinkers,\nthe Platonists did not think that the world came to be at one point in\nits distant history, nor that the world\u2019s first\nprinciple would have manufactured it like a craftsman, or spoken it\ninto existence. Rather, the Platonists thought that the first\ntranscendent principle sustained a set of further immaterial\nprinciples and forms from which derive the diversity of the natural\nbiosphere and which, through the agency of divine souls and forming\nprinciples (logoi\u2014principles that form matter at\ndifferent times and places in its various ways), unfold themselves in\nspace and time. This view of an interconnected and complex hierarchy\nof being was beautifully suited to accommodate and support traditional\npolytheism (a feature spelled out in particular by Iamblichus and\nProclus), but it of course also led to a host of difficult questions\nthe Platonists struggled to clarify, drawing in some instances for\nassistance on many aspects of Aristotle\u2019s and the Stoics\u2019\nphilosophies of nature: What precisely is the content of the\nintelligible world? What is the function of soul? How do immanent\nlogoi operate? What is the ontological status and function of\nmatter? etc. But the most fundamental and formidable difficulty was to\nexplain precisely how an absolute unity (the first principle) could\ngive rise to the obvious diversity of the intelligible and perceptible\nworlds. The answer the Platonists developed (the roots of which they\nthought reached back to Plato and his immediate successors in the\nAcademy) was to postulate that the two most fundamental intelligible\nprinciples produced by the hyper-intelligible One should be the\nprinciple of unity and the principle of diversity as such. Already\nPlato had apparently spoken about the \u2018Monad\u2019 and the\n\u2018unrestricted Dyad\u2019; together, these principles not only\nbring forth an entire realm of mathematical principles and numbers,\nbut also account for any kind of unified individuality and diversity\nthroughout the hierarchy of being. As Plotinus put it in the\ncharacteristic manner of his style: \u201cBeing, when it awoke, stood\nin multiplicity as number and offered provision for the beings, as it\nwere, a preliminary sketch of unities that held place for the beings\nwhich were to be founded on them\u201d (Enn. VI 6, 10).\n\nNow Aristotle, in the two last books of his Metaphysics, had\nforcefully repudiated the Platonic notion of some such ideal existence\nof numbers and their principles, and if Aristotle were right, the\nentire Platonic edifice would have been undermined. Roughly, it was\nAristotle\u2019s view, expressed repeatedly in the corpus,\nthat mathematical entities such as numbers or geometrical figures are\nnot themselves substances, that is, basic realities, at all, as these\nlater Platonists required. They are derivative existences, in the\nsense that the mathematician\u2019s mind in knowing them conceives of\nthem as if they were substances, by looking at the physical\nworld in an abstract way. In other words, mathematical entities do not\nat all exist independently or prior to the objects they are the number\nor figures of, but are only hypostatizations of aspects of such\nobjects. In books Mu and Nu he amplifies this view\nwith a searing attack on the early Platonists\u2019 conception of\nmathematics and their theory of Forms.\n\nWhat was needed, then, was a sophisticated refutation of Aristotle\nfrom a Platonist point of view. In order to give a flavor of\nSyrianus\u2019 defense of Platonism, both early and late, it may\nsuffice to survey his responses to two points raised by\nAristotle\u2019s celebrated criticism of Platonic forms: (1) the\nAristotelian view that objects of mathematics are arrived at by\nabstraction; and (2) the so-called \u201cThird Man\u201d\nargument.\n\n(1) Aristotle had argued (Metaph. XIII 3, 1078a5ff) that the\nwork of a geometer is comparable to that of a biologist studying\n\u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019: \u2018male\u2019 and\n\u2018female\u2019 are gender attributes of animals that one can\ndiscern in isolation when one abstracts from all sorts of other\n(irrelevant) attributes animals happen to have; just so, the geometer\nstudies his subject-matter by disregarding all irrelevant attributes\nbodies happen to have, except for points, lines, planes, and\ntheir positions and quantities. Moreover, Aristotle argues, the\nbiologist does not suppose that \u2018male\u2019 and\n\u2018female\u2019 exist as separate ideal entities (substances)\nover and above and prior to the concrete living substances that are\neither male or female, nor should he suppose such a thing. In\na similar vein, the points, lines, planes, and solids the geometer\nstudies are neither physical attributes of bodies nor do they enjoy a\nseparate existence independent of them; rather, they exist in the mind\nof the geometer by virtue of his powers of abstraction. Now Syrianus\nobjects to this line of reasoning that the required kind of\nabstraction would be impossible unless we assume that the human mind\nis already equipped with an a priori grasp of precise\nmathematical entities and principles. He writes:\n\nIn general, in response to (Aristotle\u2019s) overall view it must be\nsaid that we also do not observe all shapes or all numbers as being\ninherent in sensible objects, that is to say, all those with which the\nmathematical sciences concern themselves, nor is it possible that\nthings that derive from sense-objects should enjoy such precision. And\nif he were to explain that we ourselves add to them what is lacking\nand thus make them more exact and then contemplate them as such, he\nwill have to tell us first of all whence we are able to confer\nperfection on these; for we would not find any other truer cause of\nthis than that propounded by the ancients, that the soul in its\nessence has prior possession of the reason-principles of all things.\n(95, 29\u201337; trans. Dillon/O\u2019Meara)\n\n\nSyrianus\u2019 explanation of mathematical reasoning approaches the\nproblem from a (typically Platonic) top-down perspective. He does not\nsay that the kind of quasi-universalizing abstraction Aristotle has in\nmind is impossible, only that it will not have the required scope and\naccuracy\u2014unless one assumes that we already possess a clear\nconception of mathematical accuracy. What in fact happens, according\nto Syrianus, is that this is impossible unless the human intellect\npossesses an innate understanding of mathematical principles and\nconcepts which it projects onto the plane of our imagination from\nabove in order to grasp them rationally as the substances that they\nare: \u201c\u2026 geometry aims to contemplate the soul\u2019s\npartless reason-principles (logoi) themselves but, being too\nfeeble to employ these intellections, which are free of images, it\nextends these principles into imagined and extended shapes and\nmagnitudes, and thus contemplates the former in the latter\u201d\n(In metaph. 91, 31\u201334; trans. Dillon/O\u2019Meara,\nmodified). The place of mathematical objects is in our imagination,\nSyrianus suggests In metaph. 186, 17\u201323, and the case\nis comparable to matter receiving form, except that matter \u201cdoes\nnot know what it is receiving, nor can it hold on to it,\u201d\nwhereas the imagination, when it receives the mathematical blueprint\nfrom above, holds on to it to some extent and acquires an\nunderstanding of it.\n\n(2) At Metaphysics XIII 4,1079a11\u201313, Aristotle briefly\ninvokes the \u201cThird Man\u201d argument as a well-known problem\nfor proponents of the theory of forms; already Plato, in the\nParmenides (132a\u2013133a), had raised the same issue. If\nthe Form of Man not only fully expresses the characteristic of\n\u201cwhat-it-is-to-be-a-man\u201d (say \u201chumanity\u201d), but\nalso is a perfect instance of that characteristic (i.e., the\n\u201cForm-of-Man\u201d is a man, more perfect than any physical\nman), then it would seem that there must be a resemblance between the\nForm of Man and the physical copy of that form (which, ex\nhypothesi, are both \u201cmen\u201d). This requires the\npostulate of a \u201cThird Man\u201d by virtue of which it is\npossible to determine and predicate such resemblance. Syrianus points\nout correctly (In metaph. 111, 27\u201333) that this kind of\nargument could go on ad infinitum and then retorts (111,\n33\u2013112, 6) that it is a mistake to suppose that the predicate\n\u201cman\u201d is used in the same sense in the two cases:\n\u201cIf the point is that, because the Essential Man is synonymous\nwith men in this realm, as Alexander states in his exegesis of this\npassage, and all synonyms come to be synonyms by virtue in their\nparticipation in some Form, a \u2018third man\u2019 will manifest\nitself as being predicated of both the Form and the things in this\nrealm, then the argument becomes ridiculous; for it is not the case\nthat the things in this realm are synonymous with the relevant\nForm\u201d (111, 33\u201337; trans. Dillon/O\u2019Meara). If that\nwere the case, one should\u2014absurdly\u2014expect to find a liver,\na spleen and each of the other internal organs present in the Form of\nMan, as Syrianus points out further down (113, 34f). In the end,\nSyrianus\u2019 solution to the conundrum may not be entirely\nsatisfactory, but it was by Syrianus\u2019 time the standard one\namong Platonists. He does not deny self-predication, but he contends\ninstead that the predication of \u201cman\u201d in the case of the\nForm and in the case of the natural human being, even if it involves\nhomonymy, does so not in the usual sense, but \u201cin the way that a\nmodel (paradeigma) is related to an image of itself, and\nspecifically when the model generates the images in virtue of its\nessence, and causes them to revert to it\u201d (115, 1\u20133). That\nis to say, the \u201cForm of Man\u201d is a man in the sense that it\nis productive of natural substances of a certain kind, i.e. human\nbeings, which deserve the same predicate to the extent that they\nactively instantiate the essential characteristic of that form (i.e.\n\u2018revert to it\u2019).\n\nThere has been some discussion about Syrianus\u2019 originality\nbecause we possess a commentary of books 6\u201314 of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics that claims to be by the hand\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias and which shares numerous passages with\nSyrianus\u2019 work (concordances in Luna and Dillon/O\u2019Meara).\nEven though the commentary is most certainly not by Alexander, it\nstill remains essentially unclear which author is dependent on whom.\nMost scholars accept the view, however, that the commentary by\nPs.-Alexander was produced during the Byzantine Renaissance, most\nlikely by Michael of Ephesus (early 12th cent.), and is\ntherefore dependent on Syrianus.\n3.2 Commentary on Hermogenes\n\nThese scholia on the popular rhetorical treatises of Hermogenes of\nTarsus (c. 160\u2013225) are attributed to \u201cSyrianus the\nSophist,\u201d i.e. the rhetorician. References to and citations from\nphilosophical works abound (Plato, minor Platonists, Aristotle), and\nthere are no good reasons to doubt that this commentary was in fact\nwritten by Syrianus the Neoplatonist, most probably before he assumed\nfull leadership of the Academy. The work is addressed to the\nauthor\u2019s favorite son Alexander (2, 3f.), who was presumably\nbeing honed to become an orator (rather than a philosopher). The work,\nalthough containing no philosophical argument, deserves closer study\nas it is full of references to major and minor authors, providing good\nevidence for the vitality of the literary tradition as a backdrop for\npagan philosophy in late antiquity.\n4. Influence\n\nSince most of Syrianus\u2019 work is lost, it is not easy precisely\nto gauge the reach and depth of his influence, but it is safe to\nassume that it was considerable. Syrianus had two important pupils who\ndetermined the philosophical culture in Alexandria and Athens\nrespectively. One of these was Hermias of Alexandria, the father of\nAmmonius, a most influential later commentator on Aristotle. Hermias\ndid not stay in Athens but returned to Alexandria to teach philosophy\nthere, passing away prematurely in his forties. By him we possess a\ntranscript of lectures (scholia) on Plato\u2019s Phaedrus,\nand it is generally supposed that the work draws on the lectures of\nSyrianus which Hermias attended, although Hermias nowhere mentions\nSyrianus by name (a not uncommon practice). As already stated above,\nthe other pupil of Syrianus was the eminent Proclus, a student of\nSyrianus\u2019 at roughly the same time as Hermias. In contrast to\nthe latter, Proclus frequently acknowledges Syrianus in his writing.\nProclus possessed an unusually powerful ability to synthesize and\nsystematize Platonism, and it seems reasonable to suppose that many a\ndoctrine he subscribed to he had learned from Syrianus.\n\nCopies of Syrianus\u2019 commentary on the Metaphysics were\navailable in Alexandria several generations after his death and used\nby Asclepius of Tralles and, if the attribution of the commentary on\nthe Metaphysics of Ps.-Alexander to Michael of Ephesus is\ncorrect (see above), his work was available in Constantinople in the\n12th century. The first Renaissance Latin translation of\nSyrianus was produced by Bagnoli and published in Venice in 1558.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PrimLite\">Primary Literature: Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecoLite\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PrimLite\">Primary Literature: Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "Bagolinus, H., 1558, <em>Syriani antiquissimi philosophi\ninterpretis in II, XIII, et XIV libros Aristotelis Metaphysices\ncommentarius</em>, Latin translation by Hieronymus Bagolinius\n(Bagnoli), Venice.", "Dillon, J. and D.
