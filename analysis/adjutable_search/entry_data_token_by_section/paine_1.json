    "main_text": "Political Theory\n2. Political Theory\n\nPaine\u2019s reputation has been a source of controversy since his\nown lifetime. He was a controversialist\u2014what he wrote invariably\nprovoked controversy and was intended to do so. As such, one needs a\nreasonably capacious understanding of \u2018philosophy\u2019 to\ncount him as a philosopher. He was a pamphleteer, a journalist, a\npropagandist, a polemicist. Nonetheless, he also settled on a number\nof basic principles that have subsequently become central to much\nliberal-democratic culture. Few of these are original to Paine, but\nhis drawing together of them, and his bringing them before a wide\npopular audience, at this key historical moment when the people emerge\nas a consistent and increasingly independent force on the political\nstages of Europe and North America, has ensured that his works remain\nwidely read and are seen as of enduring value. That said, a great deal\nabout his life and about the value and interpretation of his work is\nhotley disputed and promises to remain so.\n\nFor example, the intellectual and emotional legacy of Paine\u2019s\nexperience in Britain is a matter of speculation in secondary work,\nand has recently been strongly emphasised in Clark (2018) to the\nexclusion of other influences. Other authors have emphasised American\ninfluence (Cotler, 2011), and still others that of his French\nexperience (Lounissi 2018). These debates also involve disputes over\nthe character of English radicalism, the impact of evolving American\ntraditions of exceptionalism and internationalism, and the question of\nhow far Paine\u2019s thinking changes and develops over time and in\nresponse to particular political circumstances. What should be\nemphasised is that these ongoing disagreements also involve\nconflicting interpretations of events, ideas, and actions. This means\nthat locating Paine and his ideas is also partly a question of arguing\nfor a particular interpretation of the political debates, events and\ncontroversies in which he was involved in America, France and Britain.\nAnd, since these remain a matter of controversy in both academic and\ncontemporary popular debate, it is fair to say that Paine\u2019s\nthought and legacy remains deeply contested.\n",
