Eckhart on God and Creation || The Primacy of Intellect: Eckhart\u2019s Causative Epistemology\n6.2 The Primacy of Intellect: Eckhart\u2019s Causative Epistemology\n\nWhereas Eckhart\u2019s metaphysics of flow characterizes God as a\nkind of fullness of being \u201cboiling over\u201d into\ncreation, his account of creative divine intellection, while\ncontinuous with a long medieval tradition of theories of divine causal\nknowledge, rests on a somewhat surprising idea of God as\nnon-being, a kind of nothingness, or better:\nno-thing-ness. This negative characterization of God is also\nreflected in the metaphors Eckhart employs in his vernacular sermons\nwhen he speaks of God variously as a \u201cdesert\u201d\n(VeM n.25; DW V 119; EE 247), an \u201cabyss\u201d\n(Pr. 29; DW II:84 ; TP 289), a \u201cwasteland\u201d or\n\u201cwilderness\u201d (Pr. 10; DW I:171; TP 265), or\nsimply \u201cthe divine nothing\u201d (Pr. 71; DW III:228;\nTP 324).\n\nThis identification of God with utter non-being, as opposed to total\nfullness of being, rests on Eckhart\u2019s approach to\nintellectus more generally. In human beings, for example, the\nintellect, as a natural power of the soul, is a capacity to take on\nthe representations or \u201ccognitive forms\u201d\n(species) of the objects that it cognizes and, ultimately, to\nbecome in some sense identical with them (an idea Eckhart takes over\nfrom Averroes: cf. Flasch 2006 [2015: 184ff.]). However, when\nconsidered apart from its objects, the created intellect is, strictly\nspeaking, nothing. Its objects lend it form and content, but\ntaken by itself it is \u201cnone of the things it knows\u201d\n(Qu. Par. 2 n.2; LW V:50; PQP 51) and therefore, unlike the\nobjects it cognizes, cannot be considered a determinate thing\u2014a\n\u201cthis or that\u201d (esse hoc et hoc). The intellect\nis, Eckhart maintains, \u201cneither here, nor now, nor a definite\nthing [\u2026], [it] is not a being, nor does it have an\nexistence\u201d (Qu. Par. 2 n.7; LW V:52\u20133; PQP 53).\nIt is more like an emptiness or void\u2014one able to be cognitively\n(in)formed by its intentional objects. Indeed, given Eckhart\u2019s\ncommitment to the identity of the intellect and the intelligible, in\norder to come to know anything, the intellect must itself be nothing.\nIt must be \u201c\u2018unmixed\u2019 with anything [\u2026] so\nthat it might know everything\u201d (Qu. Par. 2 n.2; LW\nV:50; PQP 51).\n\nFurther, on Eckhart\u2019s view the \u201ccognitive forms\u201d\nthat mediate the object to the intellect also lack existence. They may\nproperly be said to \u201chave\u201d objects, but they themselves\nare not substances in which accidents inhere. Neither are they\naccidents because, although they are found in the soul or\nintellect, they do not inhere in it or ontologically depend on it, as\nan accident would in relation to its subject (Qu. Par. 2 n.5;\nLW V:51; PQP 52). And what is neither substance nor accident is,\nsimply put, not a being. Instead, the species for Eckhart is\nmuch more like a relation of intentionality\u2014a way of being\ndirected toward entities\u2014than an entity itself (Caputo\n1975: 108), since on his view such relations are not themselves\nexistents. Thus, while Eckhart appears to build on Aquinas\u2019s\ndistinction between the object (the \u201cquod\u201d) of\nknowledge and the means (the \u201cquo\u201d) by which the\nobject is known, he goes beyond Thomas\u2019s approach to knowledge\nby explicitly characterizing both as non-being (Caputo 1975: 104).\n\nInterestingly, unlike many of his late medieval counterparts, it\nappears to be this \u201cnothingness\u201d of the human intellect in\nits sheer potentiality and indeterminateness that Eckhart sees as most\nclosely mirroring the divine intellect. Indeed, in contrast to the\nAlbertian tradition, it is the possible intellect, not the\nagent intellect, on which the Meister models the divine mind (Keenan\n2013; Goris 2009; Mojsisch 1983 [2001]). For Eckhart, in order to\nunderstand God as the true ground (fundamentum) of Being (and\nof all created beings), God cannot himself have being or\notherwise be a being. Rather, God must first and foremost be a\n\u201cnothing\u201d\u2014i.e., a no(n)-thing. Since\nintellect in and of itself is fundamentally characterized by a kind of\nindeterminate nothingness (one capable, however, of conceiving\neverything), it is more properly said of God than of any other\nattribute, name, or perfection one might ascribe to him. It is in this\nsense that Eckhart can assert in the Parisian Questions that\nGod\u2019s understanding is prior to (and the foundation of)\nGod\u2019s existence.\n\nEckhart famously illustrates this point in German Sermon 9 (DW\nI:141ff.; TP 255ff.) by employing the architectural and sartorial\nimagery common to many of his vernacular works (and found in much\nthirteenth-century Beguine mystical literature). He claims that, while\nconsidering God under the aspect of being (in dem wesene) is\nnot illegitimate, to do so is still to qualify God in some\nway\u2014to make of him something determinate\u2014and therefore\nmerely to see God as he resides in the \u201cantechamber\u201d\n(vorb\u00fcrge) of the temple in which \u201che shines as\nholy\u201d. Likewise, approaching God under the aspect of will or\nlove is to encounter a God still enshrouded (verborgen) in\nthe \u201cmantle of goodness\u201d (kleide der g\u00fcete).\nConsidering God under the aspect of intellection\n(vern\u00fcnfticheit), on the other hand, is to witness the\nwholly \u201cnaked\u201d (bl\u00f4z) Godhead in his true\n\u201ctemple\u201d, unclothed and \u201cstripped\n[entkleidit] of [all] goodness and being\u201d.\n\nOf course, the non-being of the intellect considered in itself is\nwhere the comparison between the human intellect and the divine mind\nends:\n\n\nHere the imagination fails. For our knowledge is different from\nGod\u2019s. His knowledge is the cause of things whereas our\nknowledge is caused by them. (Par. Qu. 1 n.8; LW V:44; PQP\n48)\n\n\nOn Eckhart\u2019s view the human intellect is largely\nreceptive, its potentiality actualized by the\nalready-existing objects in the world that it passively receives. The\nnothingness of the divine intellect, in contrast, is essentially\nproductive. It \u201creaches out\u201d to those things that\nare not and, in cognizing them, simultaneously causes them to be. Put\nin more contemporary terms, human cognition is characterized by a\nmind-to-world direction of fit, with the direction of causation\nproceeding from world to mind. With respect to God, things are exactly\nthe other way around. Divine intentionality causes the world to fit\nwith what the divine mind eternally understands.\n\nEckhart\u2019s idea here is that the divine intellect\n\u201cpre-conceives\u201d both being itself and the entirety of\nknowable forms within it, and in God\u2019s knowing them (as their\nratio), they come to exist. Considered merely as essences or\nforms that have their principle in the divine mind, they are said to\nbe pre-contained \u201cintellectually\u201d like a house in the mind\nof an architect (In sap. n.21; LW, II:34; TP 148), which has\nno being until the architect herself \u201ctrans-forms\u201d the\nidea into a real building. However, in the divine intellect they are\nneither individually distinct nor determinate, but are rather\ncontained as a unity. Moreover, because of the utter Oneness of God,\nas well as Eckhart\u2019s Aristotelian commitment to the identity of\nintellect and intelligible, the unity of the ratio of the\nforms in the divine intellect is nothing other than God himself, in\nthe form of the eternal logos. (On this point, see\n Section 8\n below.) Thus, when the divine intellect knows, it simultaneously\nknows itself and the whole world, and in knowing itself as the formal\ncause of creatures, its self-giving intentionality gives rise to them\nas their efficient and final cause. The potentiality of the divine\nintellect, therefore, is perhaps best thought of as a\npluripotential prescience (or \u201cpre-science\u201d), an\noriginative \u201cpotency\u201d eternally exercised as the divine\nmind knows itself.\n\nImportantly, however, despite his views on God\u2019s intellective\n\u201cconception\u201d of the world, Eckhart need not be viewed as a\npantheist, or even a panentheist. Rather, the universe and everything\nin it reflect the rationality of the divine mind, even as\nthey are distinct from it. To put it in more Eckhartian linguistic\nterms, the existence of the universe is \u201csynonymous\u201d with\n(and wholly dependent upon) God\u2019s act of knowing it (Milne 2010:\n10), but it is not identical with God, even if God is in some\nessential sense \u201cin\u201d it (though not as a proper part). In\nany case, with regard to God Eckhart\u2019s ontology is distinctly\nepistemological (insofar as he gives primacy to intellect over being),\nand his epistemology is distinctly ontological (insofar as the\n\u201cself-reflective\u201d activity of the divine mind is the cause\nof what it knows).\n\nIn one sense, then, Eckhart\u2019s metaphysics of flow and his\ndoctrine of causative knowledge appear to stand in tension with one\nanother. One affirms the identity of being and God (esse est\ndeus), construing being as God\u2019s most fundamental\nattribute, that out of which all creation (over)flows. The other\nnegates being of God (esse formaliter non est in deo) and\ngives God\u2019s intellect priority of place over existence. On the\none hand, this kind of tension is not out of character for Eckhart and\nperhaps simply represents one more example of what might be called his\ndialectic apophaticism\u2014or the attempt to show how God\nboth grounds and utterly transcends the standard categories of human\ncognition and language by pushing common scholastic tropes to their\nconceptual limits. It may also simply be a product of Eckhart\u2019s\npragmatic commitment to presenting various models of God that his\naudiences could \u201cfreely take [\u2026] as seems useful\u201d\nto them, as discussed in\n Section 5\n above. On the other hand, a closer look at the Meister\u2019s\ndoctrine of analogy, when combined with his emphasis on the importance\nof in quantum-qualifications, might reveal one way in which\nEckhart\u2019s intertwined views on language and metaphysics create a\nspace in which God can legitimately be said to be both\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cnon-being\u201d.\n",
