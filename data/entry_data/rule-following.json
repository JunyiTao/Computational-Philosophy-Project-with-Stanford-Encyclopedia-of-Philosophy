    "preamble": "\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s reflections on\nrule-following\u2014principally, sections 138\u2013242 of\nPhilosophical Investigations and section VI of Remarks on\nthe Foundations of Mathematics\u2014raise a series of provoking\nquestions and puzzles about the nature of language and thought. The\nliterature on this topic is vast. We\u2019ll structure our discussion\naround Saul Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein on Rules and Private\nLanguage (1982), the most widely discussed commentary on\nWittgenstein on\n rule-following.[1]\n In this book, Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein famously develops a\n\u201csceptical challenge\u201d to the idea that that there are\nfacts about the meanings of linguistic expressions and contents of\nthoughts, and goes on to propose a \u201csceptical solution\u201d to\nthe challenge, which attempts to preserve the propriety of talk of\nmeaning and content while conceding to the sceptic the non-existence\nof the kind of semantic or intentional facts on which she casts doubt.\nAfter some preliminary comments about rules, meaning, and content\n(\u00a71), we\u2019ll outline the sceptical argument (\u00a72), and\nwe\u2019ll offer an overview of some of the main responses to it.\nFirst, we\u2019ll discuss sceptical responses of the sort proposed by\nKripke\u2019s Wittgenstein himself (\u00a73). Then, we\u2019ll\nconsider straight responses, which advance candidate\nmeaning-constituting facts. We\u2019ll examine in detail the two\nforms of straight solution that are most widely discussed in the\nsecondary literature, reductive dispositionalism (\u00a74) and\nnon-reductionism (\u00a75). \n\nFor the purposes of this entry, we\u2019ll understand\n\u2018intentionality\u2019 in a broad sense, so that it covers the\nmeanings of linguistic expressions (and utterances) and also the\ncontents of propositional attitudes. Clearly, these notions are\nclosely related: just as we can say of the sentence \u2018\\(68\n+ 57 = 125\\)\u2019 that it means\nthat 68 plus 57 is 125, we can say of Octavia\u2019s belief\nthat it has the content that 68 plus 57 is 125 (or that\nOctavia believes that 68 plus 57 is 125).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Rules, Meaning, and Content\n\nWhat does the notion of rule-following have to do with the notions of\nlinguistic meaning and mental content? For our purposes, the important\npoint is that meaning something by a linguistic expression is\nanalogous to following a rule. Suppose I write out the beginning of an\narithmetical series \n\n\\[\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nIf the rule I\u2019m following is add 2, the\ncontinuation \n\n\\[\n12, 14, 16, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nis correct, in that it accords with the rule I\u2019m\nfollowing, while the continuation \n\n\\[\n13, 19, 20, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nis incorrect, in that it fails to accord with the rule\nI\u2019m following.\n\nWe have here an analogy with my meaning something by a linguistic\nexpression. Say that I mean blue by \u2018blue\u2019. Then,\n\u2018blue\u2019 is correctly applicable to, for example, a US\npostbox but not to a ripe (Roma) tomato. We can express this point by saying\nthat the former application accords with the predicate\u2019s meaning\nwhile the latter application fails to do so. Given this analogy,\narguments about rule-following have consequences for our conception of\nlinguistic meaning: if an argument shows that there are no facts about\nwhich rule an agent is following, it may also show that there are no\nfacts about what a speaker means by a linguistic expression.\n\nNote that the notion of accord in play in the case of following a rule\nis also in play in our conception of mental states with intentional\ncontent generally. Say that one intends to attend the performance of\nSartre\u2019s play No Exit at the Hopewell Theatre on\nWednesday. Then, one\u2019s attending the performance at the Hopewell\non Wednesday accords with one\u2019s intention (in the sense that it\nfulfils it), while one\u2019s staying at home to grade logic exams\nfails to accord with it. Say that one believes that the cat is on the\nmat. Then, the state of affairs in which the cat is on the mat accords\nwith one\u2019s belief (in the sense that it renders it true), while\nthe state of affairs in which the cat is on the roof does not. Say\nthat one desires to smoke a Bolivar Number 3. Then,\none\u2019s smoking a Bolivar Number 3 accords with\none\u2019s desire (in the sense that it satisfies it), while\none\u2019s smoking a Caf\u00e9 Cr\u00e8me does not\naccord with it. Given this, arguments about rule-following have\nconsequences for our conception of mental content: if an argument\nshows that there are no facts about what rule an agent is following,\nit may also show that there are no facts about the contents of a\nthinker\u2019s mental states.\n\nBefore considering the arguments themselves, we\u2019ll pause to\nreflect on views about the relative priority of linguistic meaning and\nmental content, and on what presuppositions are required in order for\nthe arguments to be run.\n\nIn his influential 1989 survey, Paul Boghossian distinguishes between\ntwo broad types of view:\n\nThe Sellarsian View: the notion of linguistic meaning is\nexplanatorily prior to the notion of mental content (Sellars\n1956).\nThe Gricean View: the notion of mental content is\nexplanatorily prior to the notion of linguistic meaning (Grice\n1989).\n\n\nBoghossian suggests that, irrespective of which of these views is\nadopted, it will not be possible to develop a sceptical argument that\nexclusively targets linguistic meaning. On the Sellarsian View, the\nconclusion that there are no facts about linguistic meaning will\nensure that there are no facts about mental content, since on that\nview it is from the former sort of fact that the latter sort of fact\nwould have to be derived. On the Gricean view, raising a sceptical\ndoubt about linguistic meaning cannot be done without raising a\nsceptical doubt about mental content.\n\nWe would add a third possible view:\n\nThe Davidsonian View: the notions of mental content and\nlinguistic meaning are explanatorily interdependent; neither takes\nexplanatory priority over the other (Davidson 1984, 2001).\n\n\nClearly, on the Davidsonian view, one cannot pose a sceptical threat\nto the existence of facts about the meanings of linguistic expressions\nwithout also threatening the existence of facts about mental content,\nand vice versa. And we can add Boghossian\u2019s further\nobservation:\n\n\nIf [the sceptical arguments are] effective at all, they should be as\neffective against linguistic content as they are against mental\ncontent. This is evident from the fact that the arguments construct\ntheir skeptical case by exploiting features of content properties, but\nwithout exploiting any facts about the putative bearers of\nthose properties. Thus, they would apply to anything said to possess\ncontent, whether it was mental or not. (1990 [2008: 62])\n\n\nIn what follows, then, we\u2019ll move freely between considering\narguments about rule-following, linguistic meaning, and mental\n content.[2]\n2. The Sceptical Argument\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with a brief outline of the argument of\nKripke\u2019s sceptic. Suppose that I\u2019ve never dealt with\nnumbers larger than\n 57.[3]\n (Given our finite nature and the infinitude of the natural number\nseries, there will always in fact be such a number.) I\u2019m asked\nto perform the computation \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019,\nand I arrive at the\nanswer \u2018125\u2019, which I take to be right. However, a\n\u201cbizarre skeptic\u201d (Kripke 1982: 8) questions my certainty.\nShe suggests that in the past I used \u2018plus\u2019 and\n\u2018+\u2019 to mean a different function, which she calls\n\u201cquaddition\u201d. Quaddition yields the same result as\naddition if the numbers are lower than 57, and 5 otherwise, so the\ncorrect result of the aforementioned computation is \u20185\u2019,\nnot \u2018125\u2019. I should answer \u20185\u2019 if I intend to\nuse \u2018plus\u2019 in the same way in which I have been using it\nin the past, or so the sceptic suggests.\n\nKripke allows that the sceptic\u2019s proposal is \u201cabsolutely\nwild\u201d, and that she is \u201ccrazy\u201d if she\n\u201cproposes [her] hypothesis sincerely\u201d. He grants, however,\nthat it is not logically impossible, and so \u201cthere must be some\nfact about my past usage that can be cited to refute\u201d that\nhypothesis (1982: 9). That is, there must be some fact about my past\nusage that determines that I meant addition by\n\u2018plus\u2019 in the past, and thus that (again, assuming that I\nintend to use the expression in the same way I have been using it so\nfar) I should answer \u2018125\u2019 rather than \u20185\u2019.\nImportantly, the sceptic does not question my memory concerning past\nuse; indeed, she goes as far as to allow that the exercise of my\ncognitive powers is faultless, and that I have access to all the facts\nabout my mind and behaviour that are potentially constitutive of my\nmeaning one thing rather than another (1982: 14). Her thought is that\nif I am not able, even in such cognitively ideal conditions, to\nprovide the fact in virtue of which I mean addition, a fact\nthat properly singles out the function of addition rather than the\nfunction of quaddition, it is because there is no such fact.\nFurthermore, the focus is on past use because \u201cif I use language\nat all, I cannot doubt coherently that \u2018plus\u2019, as I now\nuse it, denotes plus\u201d (1982: 13). But, if the sceptic\u2019s\nchallenge succeeds, it can be generalized, for \u201cif there was no\nsuch thing as my meaning plus rather than quus in the past, neither\ncan there be any such thing in the present\u201d (1982: 21). (The\nfact that the sceptic grants the idealisation of our cognitive powers\nin the way that she does shows that her argument is not of a piece\nwith the argument of the epistemological sceptic, who is concerned\nwith whether our actual cognitive capacities can lead to knowledge.\nSee Boghossian 1989 [2002: 150]. For dissent over this point, see\nGinsborg 2018. Martin Kusch takes the argument to be metaphysical\n[2006: xiv], but, in contrast with Boghossian, he takes the dialogic\nsetting to play an essential role in it.)\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, the search for a fact fails, and the sceptic\nconcludes that \u201cthe entire idea of meaning vanishes into thin\nair\u201d (Kripke 1982: 22). Kripke rejects this paradoxical\nconclusion as \u201cinsane and intolerable\u201d (1982: 60) and\n\u201cincredible and self-defeating\u201d (1982: 71), and goes on to\ndevelop, on behalf of Wittgenstein, a sceptical solution, which he\ntakes to be similar in some respects to David Hume\u2019s solution to\nthe sceptical problem about causation (1982: 4; 62\u201369), and\nwhich purports to conceive of meaning in a way that does not lead to\nparadox. We discuss the sceptical solution in\n section 3.\n (George Wilson was the first to insist on the significance of the\ndistinction between the parts of the sceptic\u2019s position\nKripke\u2019s Wittgenstein accepts and the parts he\nrejects\u2014between the basic sceptical conclusion,\naccording to which there are no facts about a speaker of the sort that\nthe sceptic is seeking that constitute her meaning something by an\nexpression, and the radical sceptical conclusion, according\nto which no one means anything by an expression [Wilson 1994, 1998].\nWe will return to Wilson\u2019s view in\n section 3.3.)\n\nWhy does Kripke take the search for candidate meaning facts to fail?\nRecall that all my previous uses of \u2018+\u2019 are compatible\nwith my meaning quaddition, which is what enables the sceptic\nto say that I meant that all along. One might complain that the\nchallenge operates from a \u201cridiculous model of\ninstruction\u201d (1982: 15), which fails to take into account that\nto be a competent adder is to have internalized a general instruction\nor rule that is now \u201cengraved on my mind as on a slate\u201d\nand which \u201cjustifies and determines my present response\u201d\n(1982: 15\u201316). But the sceptic will reply that the worry can be\nraised again with respect to the general instruction or rule, which is\njust as susceptible to being interpreted in a deviant way as the\ninitial expression. Kripke then considers a variety of other\ncandidates, which are the kernel of various philosophical theories,\nand argues, on behalf of the sceptic, that none of them fit the bill.\nAmong the facts considered are my being disposed to produce the sum\n(1982: 22\u201332), my instantiating a machine whose operations\nembody the function of addition (1982: 32\u201335), the simplicity of\nthe addition hypothesis (1982: 37\u201339), my having a distinctive\nexperience \u201cwith its own special quale, known directly\u201d\nthrough introspection (1982: 41), my having an image in mind that\nsupposedly singles out addition (1982: 42), my being in a primitive,\nirreducible state of meaning addition (1982: 51\u201353), and my\ngrasping an abstract entity, such as a Fregean sense, which singles\nout addition (1982: 53\u201354). None of them, Kripke argues, is\nsuccessful in ruling out the skeptic\u2019s hypothesis that I meant\nquaddition rather than addition.\n\nAs mentioned above, dispositionalism and non-reductionism are the most\nprominently discussed proposals, and we\u2019ll consider them more\ncarefully in\n section 4\n and\n section 5,\n respectively. At this stage, we should ask the following question:\nwhat are the conditions that a candidate meaning fact must meet? There\nis controversy in the literature about their nature and\nplausibility.\n2.1 The Extensionality Condition\n\nHere is how Kripke first lays out the two conditions:\n\n\nAn answer to the skeptic must satisfy two conditions. First, it must\ngive an account of what fact it is (about my mental state) that\nconstitutes my meaning plus, not quus. But further, there is a\ncondition that any putative candidate for such a fact must satisfy. It\nmust, in some sense, show how I am justified in giving the answer\n\u2018125\u2019 to \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019.\nThe\n\u2018directions\u2019 \u2026 that determine what I should do in\neach instance, must somehow be \u2018contained\u2019 in any\ncandidate for the fact as to what I meant. Otherwise, the skeptic has\nnot been answered when he holds that my present response is arbitrary.\n(1982: 11)\n\n\nTo begin with, Kripke claims that whatever fact makes it the case that\na speaker means addition by \u2018+\u2019 must single out the\naddition function, as opposed to the quaddition function, as what is\nmeant. It follows from this that the putative meaning-constituting\nfact must account for the conditions of correct application of\n\u2018+\u2019. In other words, the fact in which my meaning addition\nby \u2018+\u2019 consists must single out \u20184\u2019 as the\ncorrect response to \u2018\\(2 + 2\\)\u2019,\n\u2018110\u2019 as the correct response to \u2018\\(55\n+ 55\\)\u2019, \u2018125\u2019 as\nthe correct response to the query \u2018\\(68 +\n57\\)\u2019, and so on. Meaning facts render the applications\nof expressions correct or incorrect, and so a fact cannot count as a\nmeaning-constituting fact unless it does this. This is an\nuncontroversial claim, which most philosophers accept. As Simon\nBlackburn notes, this \n\n\ndistinguishes the production of terms from mere noise, and turns\nutterance into assertion\u2014into the making of judgement, \n\n\nand so \n\n\nit is not seriously open to a philosopher to deny that, in this\nminimal sense, there is such a thing as correctness and incorrectness.\n(1984 [2002: 29]; see also Wikforss 2001: 206; Hattiangadi 2006, 222;\nGl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 35; see Travis 2006 for a dissenting\nview) \n\n\nMoreover, this is something on which those who seek to offer a\nreductive account of meaning (e.g., Fodor 1990; Millikan 1984) and\nthose who are sceptical about the prospects of reduction (e.g.,\nBoghossian 1989; Verheggen 2011; Bridges 2014) seem to agree.\n\nWe\u2019ll call this first condition the extensionality\ncondition. In the case of a predicate like \u2018green\u2019,\nfor example, it requires that the fact which constitutes its meaning\ndetermines the appropriate class of things to which\n\u2018green\u2019 is correctly applicable. This will be the class of\ngreen things as opposed, say, to the class of grue things\n(where an object is grue if and only if it is green before some\nspecified time t and blue thereafter), and in the arithmetical\ncase on which we have focussed so far, the extension of\n\u2018+\u2019 will contain the triple \\(\\langle 57, 68, 125\\rangle\\)\n(and not the triple \\(\\langle 57, 68, 5\\rangle\\)).\n\nTo see how a candidate meaning-constituting fact might fail the\nextensionality condition, consider a simple form of dispositional\ntheory of meaning which proposes as constitutive of my meaning\naddition the fact that I\u2019m disposed to answer with the\nsum (as opposed, say, to the quum) when faced with\narithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x +\ny\\)\u2019. The sceptic argues that this fact doesn\u2019t\nsingle out the addition function:\n\n\nLet \u2018quaddition\u2019 be redefined so as to be a function which\nagrees with addition for all pairs of numbers small enough for me to\nhave any disposition to add them, and let it diverge from addition\nthereafter (say, it is 5). Then, just as the skeptic previously\nproposed the hypothesis that I meant quaddition in the old sense, now\nhe proposes quaddition in the new sense. A dispositional account will\nbe impotent to refute him. As before, there are infinitely many\ncandidates the skeptic can propose for the role of quaddition. (Kripke\n1982: 27)\n\n\nWe\u2019ll consider whether dispositionalism can muster resources to\ndeal plausibly with this problem concerning the satisfaction of the\nextensionality condition below (in\n section 4).\n2.2 The Normativity Condition\n\nAccording to a prominent line of thought, the notion of correctness\ninvolved in the seemingly platitudinous claim that meaningful\nexpressions have conditions of correct application is\nintrinsically normative. On this reading, meaning facts are\nnormative facts\u2014they not only sort the applications of\nexpressions into correct or incorrect, but also prescribe how\nexpressions ought to be applied. They issue semantic categorical\nobligations that bind speakers in determinate ways; the justified\napplications are precisely those that fulfil these semantic\nobligations. (The kind of normativity at stake is meaning engendered,\nrather than meaning determining; it is grounded in meaning, rather\nthan grounding meaning. See Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss 2009 for this\nhelpful distinction.)\n\nTo illustrate how the second condition, thus construed, constrains\naccounts of meaning, let us again consider Kripke\u2019s discussion\nof dispositionalism. He thinks that the dispositionalist offers\n\u201ca descriptive account\u201d of the relation between what one\nmeans by an expression and one\u2019s uses of that expression, but\nthat \u201cthis is not the proper account of the relation, which is\nnormative, not descriptive\u201d (1982: 37). More generally,\nKripke says, \u201cthe relation of meaning and intention to future\naction is normative, not descriptive\u201d (1982:\n37). Among the commentators who read the second condition in this way\nare Wikforss 2001, Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss 2009, Hattiangadi 2006 and\n2007, and Miller 2011, 2012. Thus construed, the sceptical argument\ncan be compared to arguments in metaethics that purport to establish,\nby drawing on J. L. Mackie\u2019s (1977) argument from queerness\nconcerning the seemingly problematic metaphysical and epistemological\nstatus of moral properties, an error-theory of moral judgment (Miller\n2010a, 2020). (See the entry on\n moral anti-realism.)[4]\n\nKripke\u2019s discussion has resulted in a vigorous debate about\nwhether meaning really is normative, as well as about how the\nnormativity of meaning is best understood. For a defence of the claim\nthat meaning is normative, see Whiting 2007, 2009, 2016 (note that\nWhiting focuses on the idea that meaning facts engender permissions to\napply words correctly and obligations not to apply them incorrectly,\nthough both the permissions and the obligations are defeasible). For\ncriticism of the view that meaning is normative, see Fodor 1990,\nGl\u00fcer and Pagin 1998, Gl\u00fcer 1999, Wikforss 2001, Boghossian\n2005, Miller 2006, Hattiangadi 2006, 2007, and Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\n2009. (See also the entry on the\n normativity of meaning.)\n Some philosophers seek to carve a middle ground between the\nnormativist and the anti-normativist positions\u2014for instance, by\nclaiming that meaning facts are essentially justificatory (Gampel 1997), or\nthat they have hypothetical implications that are essential to them,\nthus being fundamentally unlike natural facts, which may be\nhypothetically normative only accidentally (Verheggen 2011; Chapter 2\nof Myers and Verheggen 2016). Hannah Ginsborg proposes a novel\nconception of normativity as more basic than rules (Ginsborg 2011b,\n2012, forthcoming), which we shall briefly discuss in the last\nsection.\n\nSome commentators take the normativity condition to amount to an\nagential requirement, one that primarily concerns the\napplications or uses of expressions. The thought is\nthat meaningful uses of expressions are not arbitrary\u2014they are\nnot unjustified leaps in the dark. An adequate conception of meaning\nmust be able to account for this. This view of the normativity\ncondition claims to shed light on Kripke\u2019s numerous appeals to\nthe metaphor of blindness (1982: 10, 15, 17, 23, 87). Kusch thinks\nthat the requirement of non-blindness is best understood as falling\nunder the purview of semantic normativity (which, contra the\nnormativist interpreters, he does not take to involve categorical\nobligations), and that it is best understood as indicating that the\nspeaker\u2019s \u201cmeaning-constituting mental state guides and\ninstructs\u201d her on how to apply the expression, that the speaker\n\u201ccan refer to this mental state in order to justify her\nuse\u201d of the expression, and that this state \n\n\nnot only justifies certain applications\u2014in the sense that\nmeaning addition justifies \u2018125\u2019 in answer to \u2018\\(68+57=\\ques\\)\u2019\u2014it\nalso\njustifies the way in which the answer is usually produced.\n(Kusch 2006: 8\u20139, italics added) \n\n\nAlong similar lines, it has been suggested that the\nmeaning-constituting facts be able to accommodate the idea that\n\u201cthe meaningful use of words must be revealed as\nintentional\u201d (Sultanescu and Verheggen 2019, 13; Sultanescu\nforthcoming). The paradox has also been interpreted as belonging \n\n\nto the philosophy of rational explanation, of explanations that\naccount for what people do or think by citing their reasons for doing\nor thinking so. (Bridges 2014: 249; see also Bridges 2016)\n\n\nSome interpreters take the sceptical argument to involve the\nimposition of an epistemological constraint\u2014a constraint related\nto the epistemic justification of semantic judgments, rather\nthan to the rationality of the applications of expressions. Warren\nGoldfarb notes that Kripke \u201cdoes seem to mean that the\njustifications must in some sense be transparent\u201d (1985 [2002:\n98]). Jos\u00e9 Zalabardo takes Kripke to be demanding that the\nmeaning-constituting facts provide speakers with justification for\ntheir judgments about the correctness of the applications of their\npredicates. Justification is construed in an internalist sense:\nspeakers possess the relevant justification if the procedure through\nwhich they decide whether predicates apply to objects involved\n\u201cconscious engagement with the facts that determine how\nthese questions should be answered\u201d (1997 [2002: 286]). (See\nalso Jackman 2003, Guardo 2012, and Merino-Rajme 2015). Crispin Wright\nproposes a more specific epistemic constraint, namely, that of\naccounting for the seemingly puzzling fact that the epistemology of\nmeaning is first-person authoritative even though meaning something by\nan expression is in crucial respects akin to having a dispositional\ntrait. In Wright\u2019s words, the constraint is to explain \n\n\nhow it is possible to be effortlessly, non-inferentially and generally\nreliably authoritative about psychological states which have no\ndistinctive occurrent phenomenology and which have to answer, after\nthe fashion of dispositions, to what one says and does in situations\nso far unconsidered. (2001: 150)\n\n\nNote that all the construals of the second condition appear to put\npressure on dispositionalism over and above that exerted by the\nextensionality condition. Prima facie, dispositional facts are facts\nabout what we will or would do, not about what we ought to do;\ndispositional facts appear not to be essentially justificatory or\nhypothetically prescriptive; dispositions do not justify or\nrationalise their manifestations, and in making semantic judgements we\ndo not typically engage with facts about our linguistic dispositions;\nlastly, it is unclear how a dispositional account of meaning could be\nrendered consistent with its intuitive first-person epistemology. See\n section 4\n for further discussion of dispositionalism.\n3. The Sceptical Solution\n\nIf the sceptical argument is cogent, it seems to follow that there are\nno meaning-constituting facts, no facts in virtue of which linguistic\nexpressions mean one thing rather than another. As noted above, this\nappears to imply the paradoxical conclusion that \u201cthe entire\nidea of meaning vanishes into thin air\u201d (1982: 22). Kripke\ndistinguishes between two broad ways in which one might attempt to\navoid this conclusion (1982: 66\u20137). On the one hand, one might\nprovide a straight response, by identifying some\nmeaning-constituting fact of the sort called into question by the\nsceptic. The various proposals discussed briefly in\n section 2\n above are instances of straight responses. The two most prominent\ntypes of straight response in the literature\u2014reductive\ndispositionalism and non-reductionism\u2014are discussed in more\ndetail in\n section 4\n and\n section 5\n below. On the other hand, one might provide a sceptical\nresponse. That is, one might concede that there are no\nmeaning-constituting facts of the sort demanded by the sceptic but\ndeny that this leads to a paradoxical conclusion. In this section, we\nshall focus on this strategy.\n\nThe proponent of the sceptical solution can be understood as rejecting\neliminativism about our practices of ascribing meaning. Mirroring\nparallel discussions in metaethics, the two most obvious paths\navailable to her involve providing either an error-theoretic account\nor a non-factualist account of ascriptions of meaning. We shall follow\nBoghossian in viewing these paths as forms of irrealism about\nmeaning, content and rules (Boghossian 1989, 1990). A prominent\ngeneral line of argument in the recent literature suggests that\nirrealist views of any area make presuppositions that irrealist views\nof meaning and content are bound to deny, so that irrealism about\nmeaning and content is ultimately incoherent (Boghossian 1989, 1990;\nHattiangadi 2007, 2017, 2018; Miller 2011, 2015a, 2020). We\u2019ll\nillustrate this general line of attack by sketching an argument to the\neffect that, regardless of whether one pursues an error-theoretic or a\nnon-factualist approach, adopting irrealism leads inexorably to an\n\u201cinsane and intolerable\u201d and \u201cincredible and\nself-defeating\u201d form of eliminativism on which the\nnotions of meaning and content do turn out to \u201cvanish into thin\nair\u201d. We\u2019ll then briefly consider an alternative way of\nproviding a sceptical response, which aims to revise the conception of\nmeaning fact that is at work in the sceptic\u2019s mindset.\n3.1 Error Theories\n\nSuppose we adopt an error theory: the view that all atomic, positive\nstatements ascribing meaning, content, or the following of a rule, are\nfalse. While some error theories are eliminativist (e.g., Churchland\n1981 on propositional attitudes), the error theorist need not\nsubscribe to eliminativism. For instance, J.L. Mackie (1977) argues\nthat although moral judgements are uniformly false, eliminativism can\nbe avoided given that some moral judgements are such that their\nacceptance facilitates securing the benefits of social cooperation in\ncircumstances where \u201cthe limitation of men\u2019s\nsympathies\u201d (1977: 108) threaten their\n attainment.[5]\n On this view, even though our practice of making moral judgments\nresults in falsehoods, it meets a subsidiary norm (or norms) in terms\nof whose satisfaction its pragmatic utility can be\n secured.[6]\n Might an error theorist about meaning, content and rule-following\nattempt to avoid eliminativism by following a similar strategy?\n\nIt might seem that there is room for this approach. In the case of\nmeaning, the subsidiary norm might be something like the following:\none ought to assert \u201cJones means addition by\n\u2018+\u2019\u201d only when Jones\u2019s \n\n\nparticular responses to arithmetical queries agree with those of the\ncommunity in enough cases, especially the simple ones (and if his\n\u201cwrong\u201d answers are not often bizarrely wrong, as\nis \u20185\u2019 for \u2018\\(68 +\n57\\)\u2019, but seem to agree with ours in procedure,\neven when he makes a \u201ccomputational mistake\u201d). (Kripke\n1982: 92) \n\n\nThis norm would thus be cashed out in terms of agreement with\nrespect to inclinations \u201cto go on\u201d in certain ways, and\nthe utility of our complying with it would be that it enables us to\nmake helpful discriminations\u2014for example, when seeking to buy\nfive apples\u2014between grocers whose inclinations match ours and\ngrocers with \u201cbizarre\u201d quus-like\n inclinations.[7]\n\nWhile this strategy might seem to some to be promising in the moral\ncase, it faces special problems in the case of meaning, content and\nrules (Boghossian 1989, 1990; Miller 2015a). In order for the strategy\nto be able so much as to be pursued, there has to be such a\nthing as complying or failing to comply with a subsidiary\nnorm\u2014and so, a fortiori, such a thing as complying or\nfailing to comply with a norm as such. An error theorist about\nrule-following, however, denies precisely that there are\nfacts about norm-compliance and non-compliance. Having argued that all\nstatements about rule-compliance are false, the error theorist\napparently lacks the resources for telling a story about the pragmatic\nutility of our continuing to engage in the practice of making\njudgements about rule-following. The upshot seems to be that, if we\naccept that there are no facts about speakers in virtue of which\nexpressions have meaning, embracing an error theory will not prevent\nthe notion of meaning from \u201cvanishing into thin air\u201d.\n3.2 Non-Factualist Theories\n\nOne might attempt to avoid eliminativism about meaning by embracing a\ndifferent type of irrealism, namely, non-factualism. A\nnon-factualist about a domain maintains that judgments and claims made\nwithin that domain are not in the business of stating facts. Indeed,\nthe standard view in the secondary literature is that Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein himself is proposing a form of semantic non-factualism in\nthe sceptical solution outlined in chapter 3 of Kripke (1982). See,\ne.g., McGinn (1984), Wright (1984), Boghossian (1989), and Hale\n(2017). Might semantic non-factualism afford us a way to embrace the\nconclusion of the sceptical argument while avoiding eliminativism?\n\nThis move faces difficulties parallel to those faced by error theories\n(Boghossian 1989, 1990; Hattiangadi 2007: chapter 4, 2018; Miller\n2011, 2020). The non-factualist about meaning proposes that we\nconstrue ascriptions of meaning as having a purpose or function\ndifferent from that of stating facts. But, insofar as a sentence is\nregarded as having a function, there is an intelligible distinction\nbetween correct and incorrect uses of that sentence; in other words,\nthe sentence is rule-governed. That the notion of correctness in these\ncases cannot be identified with truth or warranted assertibility makes\nno difference to the applicability of a generalised version of the\nextensionality condition, which we outlined in\n section 2.\n Thus, suppose that \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is a\nsentence that has a non-descriptive semantic function. Consider these\ntwo specifications of the conditions in which uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019\nis correct, where \\(R_1\\) and\n\\(R_2\\) would confer different correctness-values on utterances of\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019:\n\n(a)\n Uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is correct\niff the conditions in which it is uttered accord with \\(R_1\\);\n(b)\n Uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is correct\niff the conditions in which it is uttered accord with \\(R_2\\).\n\n\nWhatever makes it the case that (a) provides the correctness\nconditions for utterances of \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019\nmust rule out (b) as providing\nthose conditions. \n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the case of plans, which are expressed in\nsentences that wear their non-descriptive semantic function on their\nsleeves. (We choose the case of plans deliberately here, as a view of\nthis kind is mooted in Gibbard 2012.) Take the sentence\n\u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019. Consider two possible\ncorrectness conditions for it:\n\n(a*)\n \u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019, as uttered by Glenn, is\ncorrect iff Glenn plans to write a fugue\n\n\nand\n\n(b*)\n \u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019, as uttered by Glenn, is\ncorrect iff either (a) it is time t earlier than t* and\nGlenn plans to write a fugue or (b) it is time t later than or\nequal to t* and Glenn plans to write a novel.\n\n\nGlenn\u2019s finite nature together with the infinitude of the\ntemporal sequence ensures that the sceptic will always be able to\nargue that no fact about Glenn is capable of ruling in something like\n(a*) and ruling out something like (b*) as the relevant correctness\ncondition. The non-factualist is entitled to regard \u201cLet\u2019s\nwrite a fugue!\u201d as having a determinate meaning only if she can\nprovide some fact about Glenn or his speech community that determines\nthat that sentence is governed by (a*) rather than (b*). The same\nargument can be pressed against the suggestion that \u201cJones means\naddition by \u2018+\u2019\u201d should be regarded as having some\nnon-descriptive semantic function. The non-factualist will be able to\nregard \u201cJones means addition by \u2018+\u2019\u201d as having\na determinate meaning only if she can provide some fact about Jones or\nhis speech community that determines that that sentence is governed by\none rule or correctness condition rather than another.\n\nSo, a non-factualist account of any region of thought and talk, which\nis committed to the claim that there are no facts of the relevant\nsort, would seem to presupposes a realist account of meaning, content\nand rules according to which there are semantic facts, intentional\nfacts, and facts about normative accord. So, a non-factualist account\nof meaning, content and rules, which is committed to the claim that\nthere are no semantic facts, intentional facts, or facts about\nnormative accord that our semantic, intentional, or normative\ndiscourse purports to capture, presupposes a realist account of\nmeaning, content and rules according to which there are semantic\nfacts, intentional facts, and facts about normative accord. It thus\nfaces a charge of incoherence.\n\nAs noted above, we chose \u201cplans\u201d as our stalking horse\nhere in order to make explicit the problem this poses for Allan\nGibbard\u2019s (2012) account of meaning (it makes no difference to\nthe argument whether \u201cplans\u201d are taken to be linguistic\nitems possessing meaning or mental states possessing intentional\ncontent). A Gibbard-style expressivist approach to an area such as\nmorality denies that there are moral facts, but presupposes that there\nare facts about meaning, content and normative accord (facts that\ndetermine what accords and fails to accord with a plan). A\nGibbard-style approach to meaning, content and rules thus, on the one\nhand, denies that there are semantic facts, intentional facts and\nfacts about normative accord (facts that determine what accords and\nfails to accord with a plan), and, on the other, presupposes that\nthere are such facts. It thus faces a charge of incoherence.\n\nA similar objection to Gibbard\u2019s view is outlined in Hattiangadi\n(2018). According to Hattiangadi, a Gibbard-style expressivist account\nof moral claims, for example, aims to give an \u201coblique\u201d\nexplanation of them in terms of the states of mind they express\n(rather than a \u201cstraight\u201d explanation in terms of (moral)\nstates of affairs which potentially render them true). But such an\noblique explanation in the moral case presupposes a straight\nexplanation of intentionality. In parallel, an oblique explanation of\nmeaning and intentionality would presuppose a straight explanation of\nmeaning and intentionality, again threatening the view with\nincoherence. In a reply to Hattiangadi, Gibbard reflects on the\nstrategy of the metaethical expressivist and attempts to use it to\ncounter Hattiangadi\u2019s worry. He writes:\n\n\nA parallel can be found in ethics: Suppose we claim that being good\nconsists in being pleasurable. The concept of being pleasurable can be\ncompletely non-ethical and naturalistic, but the claim \u201cBeing\ngood consists in being pleasurable\u201d is ethical\u2014and so, if\nMoore and others are right, nonnaturalistic. Is there, then, \u201ca\nstraight or substantive explanation of intentionality\u201d? The\ncorrect answer will parallel that for the question, \u201cIs there a\nstraight substantive explanation of being good?\u201d If ethical\nhedonists are right and being good consists in being pleasurable, then\nthere\u2019s a straight, substantive explanation of being good in the\nsense of a naturalistic explanation of the property that being good\nconsists in. But the claim \u201cBeing good is being\npleasurable\u201d isn\u2019t itself naturalistic. If Ayer was right,\nit amounts to \u201cHurrah for all and only what\u201ds pleasurable.\n(Gibbard 2018: 770)\n\n\nWe leave assessment of Gibbard\u2019s reply as an exercise for\n readers.[8]\n\n3.3 An Alternate Form of Factualism\n\nWilson takes the lesson of the sceptical argument to be not that there\nare no meaning facts, but rather that a certain conception of such\nfacts, which he calls classical realism, is hopeless, and\nconceives of the sceptical solution as accommodating meaning facts\nwhen conceived in a different way (Wilson 1994; see also Wright 1992:\nchapter 6). Classical realism is sometimes referred to as semantic\nplatonism, the view that \u201cthe meanings of our words are\nguaranteed by the pre-existing structure of reality\u201d (Pears\n1988: 363; cf. Child 2001, Verheggen 2003, Zalabardo 2003, Hanks\n2017). What is essential to classical realism or semantic platonism is\nthat the properties that guarantee meaningfulness must be antecedently\nsingled out by individuals (or communities) in order to endow their\nwords with semantic standards (Wilson 1994 [2002: 251]). As Zalabardo\nputs it, what is required is \n\n\na conscious act in which I decide to pair the predicate with the\nproperty in such a way that the satisfaction conditions of the\npredicate, as I mean it, are determined by the instantiation\nconditions of the property. (2003: 314) \n\n\nWilson takes the sceptical challenge to reveal that no sense can be\nmade of this idea, for it is not possible for an individual (or\ncommunity) non-linguistically to single out properties as \u201cthe\nde re subject of her meaning-constituting intentions\u201d\n(1998: 105). But, to repeat, what this allegedly shows is not that\nthere are no meaning facts, but rather that we must reform our\nconception of them.\n\nThe alternative picture of meaning that Wilson fleshes out conceives\nof expressions as not connected to properties that serve as\n\u201cpre-established\u201d standards of correctness\u201d (2003:\n181\u2013182), and suggests that \u201cwhat we mean by [an\nexpression] is something that gets settled only over the course of\ntime\u201d (2003: 186). In response to Wilson\u2019s proposal, it\nhas been argued that it is susceptible to collapsing into a form of\nsubjectivism (Kremer 2000), and that it is untenable, for it falls\nprey to the sceptical challenge that it purports to bypass (Miller\n2010b). It has also been argued, contra Wilson, that classical realism\nis merely an instance of a more general conception of meaning that\ntakes standards of correctness to be determined by\nentities\u2014whether abstract properties or real features of the\nworld around us\u2014that are considered independently of how we\nmight describe them linguistically; it is this conception that must be\nrejected, as it is ultimately responsible for generating the paradox\n(Verheggen\n 2003).[9]\n4. Reductive Dispositionalism\n\nThe most widely discussed attempt at a straight solution to the\nsceptical challenge is reductive dispositionalism. According to a\nsimple version of reductive dispositionalism, the fact that Jones has\nthe concept of addition rather than of quaddition is\nto be identified with (or is constituted by) his disposition to\nproduce the result of adding (and not quadding) the numbers x\nand y in response to arithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019, and the fact that\nhe means cat by \u2018cat\u2019 is to be identified with\n(or is constituted by) his disposition to apply \u2018cat\u2019 to\ncats. (See Horwich 1998, 2010, 2012 for a systematic development of\ndispositionalism; an answer to Kripke\u2019s challenge is articulated\nin Horwich 2015.) \n\nAs Boghossian notes (1989 [2002: 164\u2013165]), the general form of\ndispositionalism targeted by the sceptic covers both conceptual\nrole theories and causal/informational theories. In both\ncases, the account is intended to be reductive, insofar as the\ncontent-determining dispositions are to be characterized in wholly\nnon-semantic and non-intentional terms. The sceptic\u2019s attack on\nreductive dispositionalist theories is thus an attack on two of the\nmost popular accounts of the determination of content in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind and language.\n\nThe sceptic argues that dispositionalist theories face three problems.\nThe first problem\u2014the finitude problem\u2014is that there is a\nsense in which, much like the totality of our previous linguistic\nbehaviour, our dispositions are finite. Given that the\nextension of the addition function is infinite, containing a\ndenumerably infinite number of triples \\(\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\) such\nthat x plus y is identical to z, Jones\u2019s\nmeaning addition by \u2018+\u2019 cannot be identified with her\ndispositions to respond to arithmetical queries since it is simply\nfalse that she is disposed to answer with the sum when faced with the\nquery \u2018\\(x + y = \\ques\\)\u2019. In\nsome (indeed, most) cases, the numbers involved will be so large that\nJones\u2019s brain\u2019s capacity for computation is far exceeded,\nand Jones may even die long before she is able to grasp the relevant\nnumbers. We might follow Boghossian in dubbing such numbers\n\u201cinaccessible\u201d (2015: 335), and we might define quaddition\nto be a function that diverges from addition over only inaccessible\nnumbers. In this case, the problem is that, given Jones\u2019s\ndispositions, it is indeterminate whether he means plus or\nquus.\n\nThe second problem\u2014the error problem\u2014is that someone might\nbe systematically disposed to make mistakes. Take Smith, who\nis systematically disposed to miscarry when responding to \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019 queries. When\nSmith produces \u201828\u2019 in response to \u2018\\(19\n+ 19 = \\ques\\)\u2019, we want to be\nable to say that her answer is incorrect in the light of what she\nmeans by \u2018+\u2019. However, if what she means is determined by\nher dispositions, we are forced to say that she actually means some\nnon-standard function (one that corresponds to addition with the\ncarrying operation removed), so that her answer \u201828\u2019 is\ncorrect.\n\nThe third problem\u2014the normativity problem\u2014is that the\ndispositionalist view seems unable to capture the normativity\nof meaning. Given what she means by \u2018+\u2019, Jones\nought to respond to arithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019 by producing the\nsum of x and y, but the meaning-constituting fact\nproposed by the dispositionalist is at most a fact about how she would\nrespond to queries of the relevant form:\n\n\nSuppose I do mean addition by \u2018+\u2019. What is the relation of\nthis supposition to the question how I will respond to the problem\n\u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019? The\ndispositionalist gives a descriptive account of this\nrelation: if \u2018+\u2019 meant addition, then I will answer\n\u2018125\u2019. But this is not the proper account of the relation,\nwhich is normative, not descriptive. The point is\nnot that, if I meant addition by \u2018+\u2019, I\nwill answer \u2018125\u2019, but that, if I intend to\naccord with my past meaning of \u2018+\u2019, I should\nanswer \u2018125\u2019. Computational error, finiteness of my\ncapacity, and other disturbing factors may lead me not to be\ndisposed to respond as I should, but if so, I have\nnot acted in accordance with my intentions. The relation of meaning\nand intention to future action is normative, not\ndescriptive. (Kripke 1982: 37)\n\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we outlined a number of ways in which a normativity condition might\nbe thought to impose a constraint on accounts of meaning. We suggested\nthat in all of these ways this condition puts at least prima facie\npressure on dispositionalist theories of meaning. We will limit\nourselves in the remainder of this section to some remarks on the\nfinitude problem and the error problem. These two problems indicate\ntwo obstacles that the dispositionalist must overcome in order to meet\nthe extensionality condition.\n\nBlackburn responds to the finitude problem by pointing out that\nfamiliar dispositional properties (such as fragility) are in a sense\ninfinitary: \u201cthere is an infinite number of places and\ntimes and strikings and surfaces on which it could be displayed\u201d\n(1984 [2002: 35]). If a glass has infinitary dispositions, perhaps a\nhuman does too, and perhaps this will yield an extended disposition\nthat covers the case of queries involving inaccessible numbers. Even\nthough we have no way of getting an ordinary glass to Alpha Centauri\n(it would decay long before it got there), we can think of it as\npossessing an extended disposition to break there: breaking is what\nthe glass would be disposed to do were its dispositions on earth\nallowed to manifest themselves on Alpha Centauri. Likewise, even\nthough Jones has no disposition to answer queries involving\ninaccessible numbers, responding with the sum is what Jones would be\ndisposed to do were her dispositions in accessible cases allowed to\nmanifest themselves in inaccessible cases. This would in turn allow us\nto say that the answer that she would accept in those cases is\n\u201cthe one that would be given by reiterating procedures\n[Jones is] disposed to use, a number of times\u201d (1984\n[2002: 35]).\n\nBlackburn\u2019s response to the finitude problem is open to\ncriticism. First, Blackburn\u2019s talk of procedures Jones is\ndisposed to use is illegitimate in this context: to \u201cuse\u201d\na \u201cprocedure\u201d is to follow a rule, and we cannot help\nourselves to the idea that Jones is following the rule for addition\nhere (or any rule, for that matter), as it is Jones\u2019s status as\na rule-follower that we are hoping to recover from facts about her\ndispositions. What we can say is that as far as the accessible cases\ngo, the answers Jones is disposed to give conform to the rule\nfor addition. But, of course, they also conform to the rule\nfor quaddition. What makes Jones an adder, and not a quadder,\naccording to Blackburn\u2019s suggestion, is that were Jones\u2019s\ndispositions in the accessible cases allowed to manifest themselves in\nthe inaccessible cases, she would respond with the sum, and not the\nquum.\n\nHowever, Boghossian (2015: 341) points out that there is a crucial\ndisanalogy between this case and the extended disposition to break on\nAlpha Centauri plausibly ascribed to the glass. To think of the\ndispositions the glass has on earth as manifesting themselves on Alpha\nCentauri, we don\u2019t need to think of the glass in any way that is\ninconsistent with its nature as a physical object. It can be regarded\nas having the same intrinsic physical characteristics on Alpha\nCentauri as it has on earth, and if it is true that, given those\ncharacteristics, it would break if struck on Alpha Centauri, that\nsuffices for the attribution of the extended disposition to break on\nAlpha Centauri. Matters stand differently with Jones. In order to\nthink of Jones\u2019s dispositions to respond in accessible cases as\nmanifesting themselves in inaccessible cases, we would have to think\nof her in a way that is inconsistent with her nature as a finite\nbiological being. This is because responding to queries involving\ninaccessible numbers would require, let\u2019s suppose, a brain the\nsize of the universe. But the fact that with a brain the size of the\nuniverse the sum would be produced no more warrants the attribution of\nthe relevant extended disposition to Jones than does the fact that\nwith a brain the size of the universe she would outplay Magnus Carlsen\nwarrant the attribution to her of the potential to win the world chess\nchampionship. Jones has no extended disposition of the sort adumbrated\nby\n Blackburn.[10]\n The upshot, then, is that Jones\u2019s dispositions do not determine\nwhether she means plus rather than some quus-like function by\n\u2018+\u2019, where quus diverges from plus for inaccessible\n numbers.[11]\n\nWe\u2019ve followed Boghossian (2015) in setting up the finitude\nproblem as fundamentally a problem about determinacy. In a recent\npaper, Jared Warren admits that solving the finitude problem, thus\nconstrued, turns on solving the error problem (2020: 268), and\nproceeds to offer an attempted solution to that problem. Consider the\nfollowing proposal: the fact which constitutes Jones\u2019s meaning\naddition by \u2018+\u2019 is the fact that, when faced with\narithmetical queries involving the \u2018+\u2019 sign, Jones is\nstably disposed to reply with the sum in the overwhelming majority of\nnormal\n situations.[12]\n What are normal situations, and what is it for a disposition to be\nstable? Normal situations are those in which neither external nor\ninternal factors are interfering with Jones\u2019s general cognitive\nfunctioning. More specifically, the normal situations are those in\nwhich Jones is clearheaded\u2014situations in which the air is not\npermeated with mind-bending chemicals, in which Jones is not drunk,\nexhausted, or badly hungover, so that neither external causes nor\ninternal causes are interfering with her cognitive performance.\nFurthermore, to say that Jones\u2019s disposition to respond with the\nsum is stable is to say that, as the number of arithmetical queries\nshe has faced increases, the ratio of answers that give something\nother than the sum to answers that give the sum tends towards zero.\nAnd to keep the bar relatively low, we don\u2019t require that in\nnormal conditions it is metaphysically impossible for Jones\nto answer with something other than the sum. We only require that,\nwhen such conditions obtain, it is rational to be nearly\ncertain that she will answer with the sum. Call the disposition\nwhich we have described here disp. disp\ncorresponds to the meaning-constituting\ndispositions that Warren proposes as offering a solution to the error\nproblem. The proposal is intended to be reductive. Warren notes that\n\u201cnormalcy\u201d, defined as he defines it, \u201cisn\u2019t\nsemantic or intentional or otherwise problematically\nquestion-begging\u201d (2020: 271).\n\nHowever, Warren\u2019s attempt to solve the error problem can be\nquestioned. The error problem arises as a result of the fact that the\nfollowing two possibilities are consistent with Jones\u2019s\npossession of disp. First, Jones means\naddition by \u2018+\u2019 and is responding correctly to\nthe relevant queries. Second, Jones means some quus-like function and\nis responding incorrectly. What Warren thus needs is a\ncharacterisation of normal situations such that the latter possibility\nis ruled out. Thus, what is required is a characterisation of normal\nsituations such that, when those situations obtain, we are entitled to\nbe nearly certain that Jones will answer with the sum, and that in\nanswering with the sum Jones is responding correctly. The trouble\nis that there is an infinite range of functions \\(F_1\\),\u2026,\n\\(F_n\\) that have different extensions from the addition function. If\nJones means some function \\(F_i\\) among them, and if she answers with\nthe sum, she would be answering incorrectly. Thus, the normal\nsituations have to be such that their obtaining ensures that Jones\nmeans by \u2018+\u2019 none of the functions in this open-ended and\ninfinite set. The question that drives Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein\u2019s objection is: how could this be achieved other\nthan through the inclusion of a clause in the characterisation of\nnormal situations to the effect that Jones means addition by\n\u2018+\u2019 (or at least, that Jones means a function\nwith the same extension as addition)? How could the obtaining of a\nnon-semantically characterised set of situations have the effect of\nexcluding every member of an open-ended and infinite set of\nsemantically or intentionally characterised states of affairs (Jones\nmeans \\(F_1\\) by \u2018+\u2019, Jones means \\(F_2\\) by\n\u2018+\u2019, and so on ad\n infinitum)?[13]\n\nThus, it can be argued that the dispositionalist account offered by\nWarren either fails to resolve the indeterminacy problem or does so\nonly at the expense of deploying semantic and intentional notions,\nwhich is inconsistent with its reductive\n aspirations.[14]\nPostscript to section 4: Lewis on Natural Properties\n\nA reductionist position that has been somewhat neglected in the\nrule-following literature is suggested by David Lewis in his\n\u201cNew Work for a Theory of Universals\u201d (1983). Lewis\nwrites:\n\n\nThe naive solution is that adding means going on in the same way as\nbefore when the numbers get big, whereas quadding means doing\nsomething different; there is nothing present in the subject that\nconstitutes an intention to do different things in different cases;\ntherefore he intends addition, not quaddition. We should not scoff at\nthis naive response. It is the correct solution to the puzzle. But we\nmust pay to regain our naivet\u00e9. Our theory of properties must\nhave adequate resources to somehow ratify the judgement that instances\nof adding are all alike in a way that instances of quadding are not.\nThe property of adding is not perfectly natural, of course, not on a\npar with unit charge or sphericality. And the property of quadding is\nnot perfectly unnatural. But quadding is worse by a disjunction. So\nquaddition is to that extent less of a way to go on doing the same,\nand therefore it is to that extent less of an eligible thing to intend\nto do. (1983: 376)\n\n\nTake a predicate like \u2018green\u2019. The totality of facts about\nour previous use and dispositions to use \u2018green\u2019 are\nconsistent with it referring to the property green\nbut also with it referring to the property grue. So, what\nmight ground the claim that the property green is somehow\nprivileged as the referent of \u2018green\u2019? Lewis can be taken\nto advocate a form of \u201cinterpretationism\u201d according to\nwhich semantic facts are constitutively determined by the best theory\nof the data (J. R. G. Williams 2007). Among the a priori constitutive\nconstraints governing what counts as the best theory is a principle\nrequiring that the referents assigned to expressions be the most\nnatural of those consistent with the data. Since green is\nmore natural than grue, it is more \u201celigible\u201d\nthan grue to be assigned to \u2018green\u2019 as its referent.\nLikewise for adding and quadding. In this way, the indeterminacy left\nopen by facts about use is fended off, Lewis thinks.\n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is not ad hoc, as the notion of a\nnatural property that it utilises is required, for example, by his\naccount of laws of nature (see the entry on\n David Lewis,\n section 4.6). However, its application to the rule-following problem\nfaces a number of challenges. First, it is not obvious how it extends\nto the mathematical examples that are the focus of Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein. Boghossian writes, \n\n\nI see no obvious notion of naturalness that will cover both the notion\nof a natural property, as it might figure in an account of similarity\nor lawlikeness, and that of a natural function. (2015: 355) \n\n\nIt has also been argued that even if Lewis\u2019s proposal might meet\nthe extensionality condition, it cannot meet the normativity condition\n(Merino-Rajme 2015). \n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is also likely to be challenged on\nepistemological grounds similar to those used by Kripke and Wright in\ndismissing the suggestion that quaddition can be ruled out in light of\nthe fact the hypothesis that Jones meant quaddition is less\nsimple than the hypothesis that he meant addition. A speaker can\nknow that in response to the query \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019,\n\u2018125\u2019 is the\nanswer that accords with what she meant by \u2018+\u2019, without\nhaving to infer this from facts about her previous linguistic\nbehaviour. That is to say, in recognising that the answer\n\u2018125\u2019 fits what we mean by \u2018+\u2019, we do not\nproceed \u201cby inference to the best semantic explanation of [our]\nprevious uses of that expression\u201d (Wright 2001: 109; see also\nKripke 1982: 40). But this is apparently what we would have to do if\nthe \u201csimplicity\u201d suggestion were correct: the best\nexplanation would be yielded by the simplest of the hypotheses\nconsistent with our previous linguistic behavior. The\n\u201csimplicity\u201d suggestion thus apparently makes a mystery of\nour (generally) non-inferential semantic knowledge. Lewis\u2019s\nsuggestion will be challenged on similar grounds. We do not infer what\nwe mean by \u2018+\u2019 from facts about naturalness together with\nconstitutive principles governing interpretation. Again, the account\nappears to make a mystery of the non-inferential nature of much of our\nsemantic knowledge. Moreover, it faces difficulties in accommodating\nthe authority normally credited to self-ascriptions of\nmeaning. For Lewis, in virtue of the role they play in his account of\nscientific laws, simplicity and naturalness are objective notions.\nHowever, a speaker\u2019s opinions about what she means, unlike, say,\nher opinions about the structure of the world or of our hypotheses\nabout it, are generally authoritative, unless there are special\nreasons to doubt them. What might the basis for this default authority\nbe, if what she means is determined by facts about simplicity and\nnaturalness?\n\nMoreover, the Lewisian view seems to be a form of semantic platonism\n(Child 2011: 126), in so far as it upholds the idea that our meaning\nwhat we do by our words is somehow guaranteed by the structure of\nreality. But it might be taken to be a radical form of semantic\nplatonism, in so far as it seems to leave no room for the\nspeaker\u2019s contribution to the singling out of properties (see\n section 3.3).\n Unlike other versions of semantic platonism, it is vulnerable to a\ncomplaint to the effect that the subjective perspective of the thinker\nor speaker is entirely annihilated.\n\nFor a lucid exposition and critique of Lewis\u2019s position, see\nJ.R.G. Williams (2007). For rare examples of treatments of\nLewis\u2019s views in the context of the rule-following literature,\nsee Merino-Rajme (2015), Gl\u00fcer (2017), and Azzouni (2017).\n5. Non-Reductionism\n\nThe apparently very serious problems we outlined for the\ndispositionalist conception of meaning have been taken by a number of\nphilosophers to show that we ought to resist the temptation to explain\nmeaning and content in more basic terms. How might one formulate a\nnon-reductionist position? On Stroud\u2019s view, it amounts to\ndenying that we can explain \n\n\nthe phenomena of meaning and understanding \u201cfrom outside\u201d\nthem, as it were, without attributing intentional attitudes or\nsupposing that anything means anything or is understood in a certain\nway to those whose understanding is being accounted for. (Stroud 2000:\nviii) \n\n\nMore generally, we might say that the facts constitutive of the\nsemantic domain cannot be characterised or explained in non-semantic\nterms, that is, without employing the notions of meaning or\nunderstanding; the facts constitutive of rule-following cannot be\ncharacterised or explained without employing the notion of\nrule-following. Some philosophers who embrace non-reductionism also\ndefend the view according to which semantic facts do not supervene on\nanything; they are metaphysically fundamental. Boghossian relies on\nthe finitude problem to argue that, if meaning facts are determinate,\nthen they cannot supervene on non-semantic facts (Boghossian 2015).\nHowever, the denial of supervenience is not essential to\nnon-reductionism (cf. Child 2019b): at the core of the position is the\nidea that any attempt to account for meaning in more basic terms is\nhopeless or philosophically confused.\n\nKripke briefly considers the possibility that the states of meaning or\nunderstanding, or the facts about meaning and understanding, are\nprimitive or sui generis, which he cashes out as the idea\nthat \n\n\nmeaning addition by \u201cplus\u201d \u2026 is simply a primitive\nstate, not to be assimilated to sensations or headaches or any\n\u201cqualitative\u201d states, nor to be assimilated to\ndispositions, but a state of a unique kind of its own. (1982: 51) \n\n\nHe raises two complaints against this approach. First, he\ncharacterizes it as desperate, insofar as \u201cit leaves the nature\nof this postulated primitive state \u2026 completely\nmysterious\u201d (1982: 51), for such an approach does not provide an\naccount of what makes it possible for one to \u201cbe confident that\n[one] does, at present\u201d mean what one does (1982: 51).\nSecond, he thinks that a non-reductionist account does not address the\n\u201clogical difficulty implicit in Wittgenstein\u2019s sceptical\nargument\u201d (1982: 51), which is that it would seem that we could\nnot \u201cconceive of a finite state which could not be\ninterpreted in a quus-like way\u201d (1982: 52).\n\nSome philosophers claim that Kripke\u2019s treatment of the\nnon-reductionist position is unsatisfactory. McGinn, who appears to\nignore Kripke\u2019s brief discussion of non-reductionism, thinks\nthat there is an \n\n\nundefended and undisclosed premise [in the sceptic\u2019s argument],\nnamely that semantic discourse cannot be regarded as\nirreducible. (1984:\n 82)[15]\n\n\n\nMcGinn also notes that Kripke has no qualms with adopting a\nnon-reductionist view of meaning in other works\u2014see, for\ninstance, Kripke 1972: 94\u201397. Goldfarb thinks that \u201cthe\nconception Kripke exploits is basically physicalistic\u201d (1985\n[2002: 95]), and thus that pursuing a non-physicalist approach\nhasn\u2019t been ruled out. Boghossian thinks that what Kripke needs\nfor his treatment of non-reductionism to succeed is an argument from\nqueerness aiming to show that there is something inherently queer\nabout meaning properties, which he fails to provide (1989 [2002: 180];\ncf. Hattiangadi 2007: 47\u201350). Ultimately, Boghossian is\nsympathetic to the non-reductionist approach, though he thinks that\n\u201cit really is not plausible\u201d that such a conception might\nbe true of linguistic meaning (1989 [2002: 179]); on his view, it is\nfacts about mental content that are irreducible.\n\nBefore exploring several of the non-reductionist positions proposed in\nrecent years, we should note that some of the proponents of\nnon-reductionism think that Kripke\u2019s sceptical challenge is\nbased on confusion, and that our task is to unearth that confusion.\nThus, on their view, the proper response is not to solve the\nsceptical problem by showing that the sceptic failed properly to\nacknowledge some set of facts (or some features of some such facts),\nbut to dissolve it by showing that there is, in fact, no\nproblem. McDowell, for instance, argues that Kripke misunderstands the\ndialectic pursued by Wittgenstein in Philosophical\nInvestigations. On his view, \n\n\nthe right response to the paradox, Wittgenstein in effect tells us, is\nnot to accept it but to correct the misunderstanding on which it\ndepends, (1984 [1998: 229]) \n\n\nwhich puts us in a position to dissolve the paradox and, with it, the\nproblem of how meaning is possible. This involves renouncing the\nproblematic assumption that understanding an expression requires\ninterpreting that expression. McDowell\u2019s diagnosis isn\u2019t\nconfined to linguistic expressions. What we ought to resist is the\nthought that, \n\n\nwhatever is in a person\u2019s mind at any time, it needs\ninterpretation if it is to sort items outside the mind into those that\nare in accord with it and those that are not. (1992 [1998: 268]) \n\n\nSimilarly, Stroud thinks that the paradox is \u201can expression of\nan unsatisfiable demand\u201d (1990 [2000: 88]), namely, the demand\nfor \n\n\nsome facts, the recognition of which would not require that we already\nspeak and understand a language, and some rules, which would tell us\nwhat, given those facts, it was correct to say. \n\n\nSuch facts and such rules would have to be such as to \u201cserve to\nget us into language in the first place\u201d (Stroud 1990b [2000:\n94]). The demand is most strongly manifested in Kripke\u2019s\nassumption that there must be an item that instructs or tells the\nspeaker what to do with her expressions. Stroud claims that proper\nengagement with Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks reveals this assumption\nto be misguided, for it embarks us on a regress (Stroud 1996 [2000:\n180\u2013185]). Once we recognize the misguidedness of the picture\nthat Kripke assumes, we will no longer feel the force of the sceptical\nchallenge, Stroud thinks. However, contra Stroud, it seems that the\nextensionality condition is all we need in order to pose a\nstripped-down version of the question that the sceptic is raising,\nnamely, the question of what makes the standards of correctness that\ngovern our uses of expressions and our deployments of concepts\npossible.\n\nIt might be argued that the urgency of this question, or even its very\nintelligibility, is merely a symptom of a frame of mind from within\nwhich meaning seems impossible, and that our proper task is to leave\nthis confused frame of mind behind (e.g., McDowell 1992 [1998: 272,\n274]; 1998a: 57\u201358). However, this line of reasoning might be\ntaken to presume that a question is urgent or intelligible only if it\nis in principle possible to offer a reductive answer to it, that\nconstructive philosophy is necessarily reductive philosophy. Verheggen\nargues that the rejection of reductionism does not commit one to\nquietism. As she sees it, non-reductionism can be constructive; it can\nrevolve around advancing and defending positive claims (Verheggen\n2000, 2003). Even though the project of providing necessary and\nsufficient conditions for meaning is hopeless, the non-reductionist\ncan still aspire to articulate necessary conditions that aren\u2019t\n\u201ceven remotely trivial\u201d (Myers and Verheggen 2016: 3), and\nto draw illuminating connections between meaning and other irreducible\nphenomena. Through a creative reconstruction of Davidson\u2019s\ntriangulation argument, Verheggen argues that interaction with a\nsecond individual and aspects of the shared world is a necessary\ncondition for one\u2019s having a language and thoughts (see chapter\n1 of Myers and Verheggen 2016). The constitution of the standards of\ncorrectness that govern language and thought necessitates that the\nindividual be aware of the possibility of being mistaken, an awareness\nthat can only be grounded in linguistic interactions with another\nindividual and features of the world. Thus, the triangulation argument\nis taken by Verheggen to reveal the hopelessness of the reductive\nambition, insofar as it shows that we cannot offer an account of the\nconstitution of the standards of correctness that govern language and\nthought without presupposing that a commitment to those standards is\nalready in place. (See also Sultanescu and Verheggen 2019 for an\naccount of the Davidsonian answer to Kripke\u2019s sceptical\nchallenge and Verheggen 2017a for an account of the Davidsonian answer\nto Wittgenstein\u2019s paradox.) William Child also defends a variety\nof non-reductionism, one that \u201cdoes not give merely pleonastic\nanswers but aims to say something genuinely informative\u201d (Child\n2019a: 97). He does so by relying on Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks on\nmeaning and rule-following.\n\nAccording to Wright, \u201cit is an important methodological precept\nthat we do not despair of giving answers to constitutive questions too\nsoon\u201d (2001: 191). He goes on to propose a non-reductionist view\nthat is sensitive to the difficulty of accounting for our knowledge of\nwhat we mean. (As we noted in\n section 2,\n Wright takes Kripke\u2019s sceptic to impose a legitimate\nepistemological constraint on answers to the skeptical challenge.) He\noffers a \u201cjudgment-dependent\u201d account of intention,\naccording to which what one intends is determined by one\u2019s best\njudgment about what one intends. Insofar as the concepts of intention\nand meaning are \u201crelevantly similar\u201d (2001: 206), this\naccount can also claim to shed light on the nature of meaning. Thus,\nwe might say, on Wright\u2019s behalf, that what one means by an\nexpression is determined by one\u2019s best judgment about what one\nmeans. The notion of judgment is taken by Wright as primitive. Still,\nthe authoritative nature of first-personal avowals is allegedly\nvindicated. See especially essays 5\u20137 in Wright\n 2001.[16]\n\nWright and Boghossian recently offered independent arguments to the\neffect that the adoption of a non-reductionist view of meaning does\nnot secure the intelligibility of the idea of guidance by a rule.\nAccording to Wright, the only way in which rule-following can be\nunderstood is if it conforms to what he calls \u201cthe modus ponens\nmodel\u201d (2007: 491). The model states that an act is a genuine\ninstance of rule-following if it can be rationalized by, on the one\nhand, citing the rule and, on the other, indicating that the\ncircumstances, which must be specifiable without appealing to the\nrule, call for its application. Wright investigates basic cases of\nlanguage use, and argues that if we assume that the modus ponens model\napplies to these cases, we are saddled with an Augustinian picture,\naccording to which conceptual capacities are necessarily prior to\ncapacities to use language. At the same time, he accepts that\nWittgenstein has revealed the bankruptcy of the Augustinian picture in\nPhilosophical Investigations; so, the idea of antecedent\nconceptual capacities is unintelligible. This is taken to show that\nthe modus ponens model cannot apply to basic cases. Wright calls this\n\u201cthe minor premise problem\u201d, and argues that it compels us\nto accept that \u201cin the basic case we do not really\nfollow\u2014are not really guided by\u2014anything\u201d\n(2007: 497).\n\nBoghossian also relies on the modus ponens model to argue that a\nnon-reductionist position does not allow us to make sense of the\nintelligibility of rule-following. He offers \u201can intuitive\ncharacterization\u201d of the phenomenon of rule-following, according\nto which it has the following structure: \n\n\na state that can play the role of rule-acceptance; and some\nnon-deviant causal chain leading from that state to a piece of\nbehavior that would allow us to say that the rule explains and (in the\npersonal-level case) rationalizes the behavior in question. (2012: 31)\n\n\n\nWhat allows us to say that the rule explains and rationalizes the\nbehaviour is an act of inference from the rule to what it requires in\nparticular contexts. But inference is, according to Boghossian,\n\u201can example of rule-following par excellence\u201d\n(2012: 40), which indicates that the act of inference must fit the\nintuitive characterization above, thus requiring a further act. A\nregress is unavoidable for the proponent of non-reductionism,\naccording to Boghossian. This is the inference problem.\n\nArguably, the two problems are anticipated in Kripke\u2019s line of\nreasoning, especially in his remark, mentioned earlier in this\nsection, to the effect that the non-reductionist view faces a logical\ndifficulty (1982: 51\u201352). The difficulty seems to arise from\nthree claims that seem uncontroversial but are inconsistent: \n\n the state of meaning plus by \u2018+\u2019 must guide the\nspeaker in her applications of the expression \u2018+\u2019; \n a state of meaning can be interpreted in more than one way; \n something that can be interpreted in more than one way cannot\nguide. \n\n\nWe might think that one\u2019s state of meaning something by an\nexpression is not the sort of thing that one can interpret (thus\ndenying (ii)), or that whether something can be interpreted in more\nthan one way is irrelevant for the question of whether it can guide\n(thus denying (iii)). But neither of these options entitles us to\nreject (i); the non-reductionist still owes us an account of what it\nis to be guided by a rule (or by one\u2019s understanding of an\nexpression).\n\nMiller offers an account of guidance by drawing on McDowell\u2019s\nwritings on Wittgenstein. He argues that the inference problem and the\nminor premise problem are not genuine difficulties for the\nnon-reductionist. On his view, the upshot of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nreflections on rule-following is that \n\n\nin applying a rule R in a particular case there need be no\nfurther inferential step\u2014over and above that involving\nR itself\u2014mediating between acceptance of R and that\nparticular application. (2015b: 405) \n\n\nThis is just what it is for rule-following not to be a matter\nof interpretation: the rule is applied immediately, as it\nwere\u2014without the mediation of a further rule, such as an\ninference rule, in the manner suggested by Boghossian, or a rule for\nthe deployment of a prior concept, in the manner suggested by Wright.\nWhat puts an agent in a position to follow a rule is her having been\ntrained into a practice or custom of following rules of that sort\n(2015b: 407), where the notions of training, practice, and custom are\nsemantically characterized and cannot receive further philosophical\nillumination.\n\nThus, according to some defenders of non-reductionism, rule-following\nhas an essentially social character. One dispute that is intramural to\nthe non-reductionist approach concerns the precise way in which this\nsocial character should be understood. When it comes to meaning,\nVerheggen distinguishes between communitarian views, according to\nwhich \n\n\nhaving a (first) language essentially depends on meaning by\none\u2019s words what members of some community mean by them, \n\n\nand interpersonalist views, according to which \n\n\nhaving a (first) language essentially depends on having used (at least\nsome of) one\u2019s words to communicate with others, (Myers and\nVerheggen 2016: 84; see also Verheggen 2006 for the initial\narticulation of the distinction) \n\n\nand goes on to defend the interpersonalist view. Relatedly, there is\nthe question of how we should understand the notions of practice and\ncustom and the role that they play in a correct conception of\nintentionality, broadly construed. It might be thought, as\nWittgenstein seems to suggest in Philosophical Investigations\n(e.g., #198; #201\u2013202), that it is essential to thinking and\nspeaking that one be trained into practices or customs, and thus that\nour conception should reflect the centrality of these notions\n(McDowell 1984, M. Williams 1999, Stroud 2000, M. Williams 2010,\nMiller 2015b); at least initially, this appears to favour the\ncommunitarian view. (See also Section 4 of Haase 2018 for a different\nkind of attempt to flesh out the Wittgensteinian notion of practice,\nand Pettit 1990 for a form of non-reductionism on which communal\ninteraction is required in at least some cases of rule-following). But\non the Davidsonian conception, at the centre of which is disagreement\nand the need to settle it rationally against the constraints of the\nshared world, the idea of practice might not serve any explanatory\npurpose; even though shared beliefs may be essential for thought,\nshared standards of correctness are not essential for language. The\nDavidsonian conception is a variety of interpersonalism. This\nintramural debate is very much ongoing.\n\nSome philosophers have explored the possibility of a middle path\nbetween reductive dispositionalism and non-reductionism. Thus, in a\npaper in which she discusses Stroud\u2019s view, Ginsborg\ndistinguishes between austere forms of non-reductionism, which she\ntakes to be incompatible with constructive philosophising about\nmeaning, and \u201cless austere and partly reductionist\u201d\napproaches, which allow that \u201cwe could account for meaning in\nterms of a more basic idea of goal-directed human activity\u201d\n(2011a: 153), but without allowing that such activity can be captured\nin purely dispositionalist or physicalist terms. She goes on to\narticulate a less austere view, which explains meaning in terms of a\nnotion of normativity that she takes to be primitive. On this view,\nfor someone to mean something by an expression is for her to have a\ndisposition to apply it in particular contexts and, crucially, to take\nthe manifestations of that disposition to be appropriate. Taking\none\u2019s responses to be appropriate \n\n\ndoes not depend on the antecedent grasp of a rule or standard\ndetermining that response as correct rather than incorrect, or even on\nthe awareness that there is such a rule or standard; (2011a: 169) \n\n\nthis establishes the primitive status of the notion of\nappropriateness. Thus, Ginsborg provides a dispositionalist account of\nmeaning, albeit with a crucial proviso to the effect that the relevant\ndispositions are to be characterized in normative terms. She thinks\nthat the account can serve as a straight solution to the sceptical\nchallenge. On the one hand, it purports to vindicate the normativity\nof meaning, and thus to meet the normativity condition; on the other\nhand, it purports to account for the distinction between correct and\nincorrect applications of expressions, and thus to meet the\nextensionality condition. For Ginsborg, the set of correct\napplications of an expression are the applications that one is\ndisposed to regard as appropriate\u2014the applications that ought,\nin the primitive sense, to be made (see Ginsborg 2011b for a more\ndetailed account of her solution to Kripke\u2019s problem).\n\nGinsborg\u2019s view is in some respects similar to Robert\nBrandom\u2019s. Brandom seeks to explain meaning in terms of use,\nwhere use is specified in a way that is \n\n\nneither so generous as to permit semantic or intentional vocabulary,\nnor so parsimonious as to insist on purely naturalistic vocabulary.\n(1994: xiii) \n\n\nThus, his approach to meaning might also be viewed as less austere and\npartly reductionist. We do not have room to explain the details of\nBrandom\u2019s intricate view; suffice it to say that, on that view,\nthe proper specification of the use that determines meaning\nessentially involves normative vocabulary. The facts that determine\nmeaning are facts about the entitlements and\ncommitments that are implicit in the performances of speech\nacts. Thus, what a speaker means by an utterance is to be understood\nas consisting, roughly, in the performances that she is committed to\nin virtue of the utterance as well as in the performances that entitle\nher to make it. Ultimately, these facts are \u201cproducts of human\nactivity\u201d (xiv), being a matter of our adopting normative\nattitudes toward one another--of taking one another to be\ncommitted or entitled, in light of our performances, to various other\nperformances. However, although there are similarities, there are also\nimportant differences between Brandom\u2019s approach and\nGinsborg\u2019s. While for Brandom the norms that are constitutive of\nmeaning are socially instituted, for Ginsborg they are natural.\nMoreover, the notion of appropriateness that Ginsborg fleshes out is\nmore basic than the notion of reason, and thus more basic than the\nnotions of entitlement and commitment that Brandom takes to be\nconstitutive of meaning (Ginsborg 2011a: 172fn21). Still, Ginsborg\ndoes think that \u201cexpressions have meanings only in virtue of\nthere being ways in which they ought to be applied\u201d (2012: 132).\nSo, to put it crudely, on both accounts, meaning facts are reduced to\nfacts or considerations about what ought to be the case. The question\nthat the austere non-reductionist will raise is whether the latter\nkinds of fact are apt to solve the indeterminacy problem, and thus to\nmeet the extensionality condition.\n\nThe challenge of the sceptic makes perspicuous the fact that a\nnon-semantically described pattern is compatible with indefinitely\nmany interpretations. Does the appeal to the normative domain help us\nrule out the sceptic\u2019s alternative hypotheses? Given that,\narguably, on a partly reductionist picture of the sort that Brandom\nproposes, utterances are, ultimately, nothing more than\n\u201cnormatively constrained noise- or mark-makings\u201d (Whiting\n2006: 11), that is, non-semantically described performances that stand\nin normative relations to other non-semantically described\nperformances, it does not seem that we have the resources to single\nout as privileged a particular interpretation or standard of\ncorrectness. Similarly, a normative pattern that instantiates how one\nought, in the primitive sense proposed by Ginsborg, to go on with\nrespect to an expression seems to be consistent with more than one\nsemantic interpretation of that expression. It might be thought that\nGinsborg could appeal to the non-semantically characterized\ndisposition in order to fix the meanings of the relevant expression.\nHowever, we have already shown in\n section 4\n that dispositionalist accounts face very serious obstacles (see\nVerheggen 2015; Chapter II of Myers and Verheggen 2016, and Miller\n2019 for more discussion of the failure of dispositionalism in\nrelation to Ginsborg\u2019s view). So, the proponent of the less\naustere approach to meaning owes the austere non-reductionist an\naccount of how the extensionality condition might be met. (See Haddock\n2012 and Sultanescu 2021 for more discussion of Ginsborg\u2019s view,\nand Rosen 1997, McDowell 2002, Hattiangadi 2003, and Whiting 2006 for\nmore discussion of Brandom\u2019s view.)\n",
