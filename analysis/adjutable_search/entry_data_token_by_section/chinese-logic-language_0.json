Background and General Considerations\n\nIt is generally recognized today that Chinese philosophy in its\nclassical period was much more preoccupied with articulating and\nsupporting philosophical positions through sustained rational\ndiscourse than was previously assumed. Part of the reason for this\noversight in decades past was due to the loss or neglect of ancient\ntexts critical to the understanding of early Chinese ideas on language\nand logic, particularly the writings of the later Mohists, who\ndeveloped a sophisticated school of philosophical and scientific\nthought in the third century BCE, but whose writings were rediscovered\nby philologists only in the late Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912). In\naddition to meticulously developing scientific theories about\ngeometry, mechanics, optics, and economics, the later Mohists also\narticulated detailed philosophical theories in areas we now recognize\nas logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language.\nTheir writings on language and logic are particularly noteworthy,\nsince the later Mohists appeared to treat these disciplines as\nembodying a subject matter worthy of independent study, and they\ndevoted more attention to issues about language and logic than any\nother school of thought of the same period. One finds in later Mohist\nwritings, for instance, the only detailed exposition of bian\n(disputation), the style of argumentation or debate likely practiced\nin all major schools of thought in ancient China (Fraser 2013). The\nlater Mohists aspired to become more proficient practitioners of\nbian by taking it more conscionably as an object of study,\nand carefully articulating, in the context of a general theory, the\nterms, rules, and methods for its practice.\n\nA second reason for this oversight is in the fact that those writings\nof classical Chinese philosophers that did largely survive the\nvicissitudes of history\u2014particularly the major works of Daoists\nlike Zhuangzi and Laozi, but also those writings attributable to\nConfucius and his philosophical descendants\u2014tend to embody what\nappear to be unfavorable appraisals of, or at least alternatives to,\nphilosophical methods that rely heavily on suppositions about the\npower of discursive rationality at establishing true ethical,\nmetaphysical, or scientific principles. Such methods take for granted\nthe aptitude of the human intellect to logically deduce true,\ninformative statements about particular objects, events, or states of\naffairs from general propositions, or establish correct\ngeneralizations by induction from particular instances, a practice\nless self-consciously avowed in most philosophical traditions in China\nthat were (unlike Mohism) stimulated by centuries of well-established\nsociocultural practices. Arguably, much of the interest we see in the\nstudy of logic in early Western philosophy was stimulated by the\nsupposition of a dichotomy between appearance and reality, which\nprompted philosophers to wonder whether judgments or theories about\nwhat appears to us do or do not correspond to the structure or content\nof a mind-independent, objective reality. The obvious case is Plato,\nwhose analysis of Forms was inspired by the methods of Euclidean\ngeometry with the intention that it be carried out in a realm of\nabstraction largely unimpeded by the diffuse and problematic content\nof sense experience. Aristotle lamented the fact that Plato\u2019s\nmethods suffered from limited applicability to the varieties of\nexperiential phenomena, believing instead that the content of\nperception does not pose any special problems for the reliability of\njudgment, but he retained a fundamental interest in the theory of\nrepresentation and hoped that his system of logic would provide proper\nnormative standards for drawing inferences among the categories we use\nto identify things.\n\nMost Chinese philosophers who lived after the unification of China in\n221 BCE, which was largely dominated by Confucianism after a brief\nperiod of suppression initiated by the First Emperor Qin Shi Huang, do\nnot appear to have had any special distrust of the content of the\nsenses, or were not responding to those who did, and so were not\ncompelled to view the veracity of representation as a problem of\nsignificance. Consequently, scholars have variously characterized\nChinese philosophical thought in ways that contrast it with Western\npreoccupations with discursive rationality. It is common, for example,\nto view early Chinese philosophers as largely preoccupied with\nproblems centering on the proper governance of society and how\ncitizens ought to conduct themselves within it. As much as in any\nother major philosophical tradition, the early Chinese philosophers\nwere concerned with questions about what kind of life is worth living\nand what things, circumstances, or actions are to be regarded as\nultimately valuable. Their philosophical investigations led them to\nconceptualize ideals of right conduct, appropriate behavior, and\nsocial propriety (Hall and Ames 1987). But the methods they employed\nto establish these ideals tended to emphasize reasoning by example\nfrom the actions or conduct of key moral exemplars rather than\ndeducing particular judgments of practical action from general\nprinciples. For this reason they were more preoccupied with\nidentifying proper normative standards by which to judge the\nsimilarity or resemblance of a thing or action with that of a chosen\nstandard. Arguably, this encouraged a conception of logic based mostly\non methods of inductive, analogical reasoning, given their special\nconcern with the problem of resemblance, and this view is borne out to\na large extent in the Mohists\u2019 more self-conscious appraisals of\ntheir own methodology and in the modes of reasoning they use to\nillustrate it (Yuan 2012; Fraser 2013).\n\nMoreover, the Mohists\u2019 term for reasoning or disputation,\nbian, appears in most other major philosophical texts of the\nClassical (or pre-Han) era, suggesting broad similarities in use. The\nterm is generally understood to mean \u201cdistinguishing\u201d or\n\u201cdrawing distinctions\u201d, although in its more specific uses\nwe find it variously understood as a process of conceptualizing\nsimilarities and differences, discriminating objects in acts of\nperception, appealing to normative linguistic standards for naming\nobjects, and using the normative criteria of correct naming as a\nproper guide to action (Fraser 2013). At the heart of these uses there\nappears to be a basic preoccupation with the philosophical importance\nof identifying the similarities and differences of things and events,\na process largely determined by cognitive skills associated with\npattern recognition. Unlike Aristotle, however, whose methods of\nclassifying things depended on assumptions about metaphysically real\nessences (independent of human agency), the early Chinese philosophers\nput the burden of correct discrimination at least partly on what they\ndeemed to be appropriate normative standards, based on the efficacy\nwith which they were thought to guide action. That is to say, which\nsimilarities and differences they thought were relevant depended on\nwhether they were thought to guide action in a way that is consistent\nwith general moral principles about right conduct. A central purpose\nof the ethical investigations of the Mohists, for example, was to\nidentify general standards of judgment that would reliably and\nimpartially guide action in a way that produces beneficial\nconsequences, and they appealed to bian as the principal\nhuman faculty for determining how these standards would play out in\nspecific cases. Practical reasoning was conceived as an ability to\nrespond appropriately on the basis of inferences drawn by analogy from\nvarious preconceived exemplars or models of moral action. According to\nBook 4 of the Mozi:\n\n\nThose in the world who perform tasks cannot do without models\n(fa) and standards. There is no one who can accomplish their\ntask without models and standards. Even officers serving as generals\nor ministers, they all have models; even the hundred artisans\nperforming their tasks, they too all have models.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Mohists do not seem to have found any reason to\ndoubt the assumption that this appeal to normative standards of\ndiscrimination (standards relevant to the efficacy of moral action) is\nstill grounded in the identification of real similarities and\ndifferences among objects, patterns of experience or perception that\ncould in principle be identified by any competent individual with\ndependable cognitive, perceptual, and linguistic capacities.\n\nThis way of summarizing the Mohist philosophical enterprise does leave\nunanswered important questions about the ultimate justification of\nethical claims. Early Chinese thought does not provide an explicit\ndistinction between fact and value, so it is a matter of controversy\nto determine which has epistemic priority in Mohist thought\u2014the\nnormative standards by which the correct uses of language guide\nbehavior, or the evaluations of reason that are determined by our\nability to ascertain real similarities and differences in perception\nand thought. This problem is perhaps less controversial in the\ninterpretation of Confucian philosophy because the priority of\nnormative standards in the Confucian program of ordering names is\nattested by clear examples. It is evident, for instance, in section\n1B/8 of the Mencius, which acknowledges the admissibility of\nkilling a wicked ruler in spite of the prohibition of regicide, on the\npremise that this ruler is not really a king (or does not\nwarrant the name \u201cking\u201d). The Confucian view is that\nanyone who is a king ought to act like one;\notherwise the name is unwarranted. Hence, correct naming is also a\nprescription for conduct.\n\nOne can appreciate, in this regard, why the Confucians insisted that\nthe correct use of names is a matter for authority to decide, because\nonly an appropriate authority can justify how one ought to act. This\nauthority was assumed to be found in the forms of ritual propriety\n(li) that were the common ingredients of established\ntraditions, or in the judgments or discretions of \u201cvirtuous\ngentlemen\u201d or other exemplars of moral conduct, and in this\nregard was considered to be \u2013 if not universal \u2013 then at least\nconstant, dependable and unifying. But the Mohists were skeptical, not\nhesitating to point out that tradition was not a strong enough\ncriterion for proper action. They knew, for instance, that social\npractices vary and conflict dramatically across time and place; how\ncan they all be \u201crighteous\u201d? Something independent of\nthese practices had to decide to serve as an objective criterion of\nmoral conduct. It is noteworthy that the Mohists themselves did appeal\nto an authority of sorts, in the abstract, quasi-godlike entity they\nreferred to as Heaven (tian), which they deemed to be the\nmost perfect moral agency. They referred to this agency as\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (tian zhi), believing that it could serve as the basis of an\nauthority independent of the variable and opposing opinions and social\npractices of people. But in later Mohist writings, particularly the\nMohist Canons, we find no mention of this agency, possibly\nbecause the Mohists found that their conception of it was not\nsubstantive enough to discriminate things at the level of\nphilosophical precision that they sought to address. Whatever the\ncase, they essentially divorced the justification of action from any\nauthoritative individual or entity that would otherwise serve to\nestablish it, and this raised new philosophical concerns about how the\nnorms of conduct and language use were to be decided. Central to\nMohist ethical thought are the principles of utility (an action is\nright depending on whether its consequences are useful) and universal\nlove (the usefulness of an action is determined by the impartial\nbeneficence it contributes to public welfare). So, according to the\nMohists, the moral description of an action depends partly (indeed,\nlargely) on whether it contributes to these ends, or whether these\nends may be judged appropriately analogous to the consequences of the\nactions of a moral exemplar. But the judgment of similarity here may\nitself depend on preexisting normative standards of correct use\nindependently of considerations of utility. Safe to say that since the\nMohist Canons do not explicitly address the issue of convention in\nlanguage, or its role in the justification of principles of naming,\nthe Mohists were probably undecided on this point. Not until the\nphilosophy of Xunzi do we find a clear consideration of this issue,\nbut Xunzi avoids the hard questions it exposes by deferring to the\nmore fastidious judgments of an intellectual elite.\n\nIt should be noted that those who rejected the Mohists\u2019 views\noften concentrated their objections on the logical presuppositions of\nthe Mohists\u2019 methodology of disputation by pointing out\ncounterexamples to the kinds of analogical inferences that the Mohists\nwere inclined to take for granted. A.C. Graham, for instance, who did\nmore than any other Western philosopher at reconstructing and\nanalyzing Mohist philosophical doctrines about language and logic in\nthe early decades following their rediscovery by Chinese philologists,\nnevertheless described the opposing Daoist philosophies (particularly\nas espoused in the Zhuangzi) as \u201canti-rational\u201d,\nrepresentative of an \u201cassault on reason\u201d, a\n\u201crejection\u201d, and even \u201cmockery\u201d, of logic\n(Graham 1989). Yet some argue that a great many of the Daoist\nobjections one finds in the Zhuangzi are motivated more by a\ngeneral skepticism about the possibility of identifying invariable\nstandards of discrimination in language than about ineradicable\ndefects in the very human capacity for reason. One can be a skeptic,\nfor instance, about the role of necessity in reference without having\nanything disparaging to say about our ability to evaluate the\nconsistency of a theory on logical grounds or reject it by the method\nof reductio ad absurdum. A number of scholars have even\nclaimed that Daoism, in particular, is not the anti-rational\nphilosophy it has been taken to be, but in some ways an attempt at\ncarrying the methods of reason to their ultimate limits, much as\nWittgenstein in his Tractatus attempts to tease out the\nboundary of the sayable through sustained rational reflection.\nZhuangzi, for all his skepticism about the utility of natural language\nas a medium for the representation of truth and inclinations towards\nmysticism, might nonetheless have still venerated reason,\nindependently of language, as the principal mode of thought through\nwhich one is able to discern right conduct in accordance with the Dao\n(or Way). This view is controversial, but scholars have not been\naverse to it (cf. the general view of Wing-tsit Chan: \u201cHe is\nmystical, but at the same time he follows reason as the leading\nlight\u201d, 1963: 177), and there seems to be an increasing interest\nin its viability (e.g., Alt 1991). Evidence for it is considered in\n section 4\n below.\n\nIt is clear that even if Daoism and other schools of thought\npositioned vis-\u00e0-vis Mohism in ancient China were in\nsome sense \u201canti-rational\u201d in orientation, their views\nwere not developed in isolation but were in fact a consequence of\nprolonged social contact and interaction with Mohist philosophers, and\nso could not have developed without being amply informed by their\nopponents\u2019 methods and views. This fact alone demands caution\nwhen making general statements about the logical and linguistic views\nof early Chinese philosophers working outside the Mohist tradition.\nOne can easily discern an increasing sophistication in methods of\ndisputation in traditions that did not exhibit a great interest in\nthematizing language and logic independently of other philosophical\npursuits, and this should not surprise us given the tumultuous period\nin which these traditions developed and the contentious struggles of\ntheir adherents for varying positions of social status and privilege.\nMengzi, for example, seeking to defend key ideas in Confucian thought,\ngoes beyond his forebears in advancing views on the goodness of human\nnature by appealing to more sharply formulated premises about innate\ndispositions for feeling and moral judgment against those asserting\nthat human nature is inherently neutral (2A6, and see Shun 1997 for an\nextensive analysis of argumentation in the Mencius text). By\nthe time Xunzi enters the fray near the end of the Warring States\nperiod we find rebuttals to Mencian thought that dig deep into what it\nis to have a disposition, how dispositions inform the possibilities of\nhuman behavior, and how we ought to act in response to them (e.g.,\nXunzi, Book 23). Far from simply explaining his views, Xunzi\nmarshals highly intelligible theories of semantics and reference in\ntheir defense, and he explicates these theories with punctilious\ndefinitions that are marked improvements over earlier formulations.\nAccording to Cua 1985, methods of disputation reach their highest\npoint in the writings of Xunzi, who in no small way benefited from the\nstandards of rigor that had emerged out of the ongoing disputes of his\npredecessors.\n\nThese developments notwithstanding, it is still important to recognize\nthat the demise of Mohism following the Warring States period appears\nto have squelched philosophical interest in the study of language and\nlogic mostly until modern times, when it was revived in 1894 the\nwritings of Sun Yirang (Graham 2003 [1978]: 70\u20132). Matters are\ncomplicated by the fact that logic as a unique object of study or\ndiscipline disentangled from other philosophical pursuits was\nhistorically awakened in Chinese philosophical thought only after the\nintroduction of Western philosophical notions and methods in the\n16th and 17th centuries. The Jesuit scholar\nMatteo Ricci, who first arrived in China in 1583, brought more than\nWestern science and literature; he introduced Euclid\u2019s\nElements to the Chinese and arranged a translation of it with\nthe assistance of the Chinese scholar Xu Guangqi. For these reasons,\nconsiderable caution has to be exercised in any attempt to reconstruct\nthe philosophical views of classical Chinese philosophers about\nlanguage and logic, to avoid anachronistically imposing notions that\nwere not part of their original philosophical programs (Garrett 1993).\nDebates surrounding these issues are very much alive today, with\ncontemporary scholars of Chinese philosophy tending to fall on one or\nthe other side of the general dispute about whether it is appropriate\nto utilize concepts, terms, distinctions, modes of expression, or\nmethods of analysis that may have been of foreign origin to interpret\nthe works of classical Chinese philosophers (see the entry\n comparative philosophy: Chinese and Western\n for further discussion).\n\nIt is indisputable that early Chinese philosophers of all major\nschools of thought were, at various points in their philosophical\ndevelopment, preoccupied to lesser and greater degrees with issues\ncentral to the philosophical studies of language and logic. However,\nwhether they pursued these issues in ways that were similar to, or\nvery different from, Western or other foreign orientations is a matter\non which no general consensus has been reached. Common notions in the\nphilosophical study of language include, for example, meaning, truth,\nreference, assertion, speech act, and propositional structure, notions\nthat may or may not translate successfully into the vocabulary\nemployed by early Chinese philosophers, given radical linguistic and\ncultural differences.\n\nLikewise, logic, construed as the study of inference, may have to be\nconceived differently from traditional Western accounts, given early\nChinese philosophers\u2019 rather unique approach to reasoning about\nlanguage as a normative guide to ethical judgment and action (for\nexample, as based on the doctrine of the ordering of names). It is not\nat all clear that early Chinese philosophers had a conception of logic\nthat involved the typical notions of truth, validity, entailment,\nconsistency, and so forth. Normally, an inference is conceived as a\nrule-bound transition of some kind from one sentence-like\nstructure\u2014a proposition, statement, or sentence\u2014to\nanother, and is considered valid if it preserves truth. However, there\nis some dispute about whether early Chinese philosophers were\npreoccupied with truth as a semantic concept, and even whether they\nconsidered sentences to be units of linguistic significance. On the\nother hand, contemporary developments of logic have opened up new\nvistas in the study of ancient ideas. Our primary concern in logic\nneed not be the preservation of truth, and different conceptions have\nbeen developed in which various conditions of satisfiability are\nemployed, with \u201cvalidity\u201d appropriately redefined. Caveats\nsuch as these admonish us to be open to alternative accounts of logic\nwhen interpreting the views of early Chinese philosophers, and to\nexercise caution when representing these views in contemporary\nnomenclature.\n\nNeedless to say, any solution to this debate will have to remain open\nnot only to research in the history of Chinese philosophy but also to\nadvances in the general studies of language, logic, cognition and\nhuman nature. Given the universality of language and logic as human\ncapacities or objects of use, can we assume that philosophers\ninterested in these topics will invariably identify, uncover, or\nutilize analogous concepts, presuppositions, or methods, regardless of\ntime, place, culture, or historical context, or that with conceptual\nadvances in their understanding of these topics, their views will\ninvariably converge? Answers to these questions will inform the\nmethodologies involved in contemporary research on classical Chinese\nthought, by compelling us to interpret the writings of early Chinese\nphilosophers from perspectives motivated by assumptions about either\nshared or divergent presuppositions, as the case may be.\n",
