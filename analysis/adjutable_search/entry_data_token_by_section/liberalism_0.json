    "main_text": "The Debate About Liberty || The Presumption in Favor of Liberty\n1.1 The Presumption in Favor of Liberty\n\n\u201cBy definition,\u201d Maurice Cranston says, \u201ca liberal\nis a man who believes in liberty\u201d (1967: 459). In two ways,\nliberals accord liberty primacy as a political value.\n\n(i) Liberals have typically maintained that humans are naturally in\n\u201ca State of perfect Freedom to order their\nActions\u2026as they think fit\u2026without asking leave, or\ndepending on the Will of any other Man\u201d (Locke, 1960 [1689]:\n287). Mill too argued that \u201cthe burden of proof is supposed to\nbe with those who are against liberty; who contend for any restriction\nor prohibition\u2026. The a priori assumption is in favour\nof freedom\u2026\u201d (1963, vol. 21: 262). Recent liberal\nthinkers such as as Joel Feinberg (1984: 9), Stanley Benn (1988: 87)\nand John Rawls (2001: 44, 112) agree. Liberalism is a philosophy that\nstarts from a premise that political authority and law must be\njustified. If citizens are obliged to exercise self-restraint, and\nespecially if they are obliged to defer to someone else\u2019s authority,\nthere must be a reason why. Restrictions on liberty must be\njustified.\n\n(ii) That is to say, although no one classifies Hobbes as a liberal,\nthere is reason to regard Hobbes as an instigator of liberal\nphilosophy (see also Waldron 2001), for it was Hobbes who asked on\nwhat grounds citizens owe allegiance to the sovereign. Implicit in\nHobbes\u2019s question is a rejection of the presumption that\ncitizens are the king\u2019s property; on the contrary, kings are\nempowered by citizens who are themselves, initially, sovereign in the\nsense of having a meaningful right to say no. In the culture at large,\nthis view of the relation between citizen and king had been taking\nshape for centuries. The Magna Carta was a series of agreements,\nbeginning in 1215, arising out of disputes between the barons and King\nJohn. The Magna Carta eventually settled that the king is bound by the\nrule of law. In 1215, the Magna Carta was part of the beginning rather\nthan the end of the argument, but by the mid-1300s, concepts of\nindividual rights to trial by jury, due process, and equality before\nthe law were more firmly established. The Magna Carta was coming to be\nseen as vesting sovereignty not only in nobles but in \u201cthe\nPeople\u201d as such. By the mid-1400s, John Fortescue,\nEngland\u2019s Chief Justice from 1442 to 1461, would write The\nDifference Between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy, a plea for\nlimited monarchy that arguably represents the beginning of English\npolitical thought (Schmidtz and Brennan, 2010: chap. 2).\n\nHobbes generally is treated as one of the first and greatest social\ncontract thinkers. Typically, Hobbes also is seen as an advocate of\nabsolute sovereignty. On Hobbes\u2019s theory, Leviathan\u2019s\nauthority is almost absolute along a particular dimension: namely,\nLeviathan is authorized to do whatever it takes to keep the peace.\nThis special end justifies almost any means, including drastic\nlimitations on liberty. Yet, note the limitations implicit in the end\nitself. Leviathan\u2019s job is to keep the peace: not to do\neverything worth doing, but simply to secure the peace. Hobbes, the\nfamed absolutist, in fact developed a model of government sharply\nlimited in this most important way.\n\nParadigmatic liberals such as Locke also maintain that justified\nlimitations on liberty are fairly modest. Only a limited government\ncan be justified; indeed, the basic task of government is to protect\nthe equal liberty of citizens. Thus John Rawls\u2019s\nparadigmatically liberal first principle of justice: \u201cEach\nperson is to have an equal right to the most extensive system of equal\nbasic liberty compatible with a similar system for all\u201d (Rawls,\n1999b: 220).\n",
