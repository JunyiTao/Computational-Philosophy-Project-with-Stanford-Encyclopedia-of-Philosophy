    "main_text": "Relations Between Temporal Parts\n9. Do People have Temporal Parts? And Other Special Cases.\n\nIssues about the persistence of people are the subject of an entire\nencyclopedia article in their own right (see the separate entry on\n personal identity),\n but it is worth highlighting points where the arguments discussed in\nearlier sections have special consequences for personal survival.\nPeople have various distinctive features: we have moral status, we\nhave mental properties like reasoning and being conscious, and we are\nassociated in an intimate but somewhat puzzling way with living\norganisms.\u00a0 Moreover, most of us seem to have a special concern\nfor our own future, and are willing to limit current pleasures like\nsmoking, shopping, and not writing encyclopedia articles, because we\nbelieve that sacrifices made now will benefit us in the future. We\nalso feel a distinctive kind of pride or shame about our own past\nactions, and are bound by our own past promises but not by those of\nother people.\n\nIs there room for these distinctive features within the different\ntheories of persistence? It has been suggested that only endurantists\ncan justify our willingness to make sacrifices for our future selves,\nto act upon the plans formulated by our past selves, and to rely upon\nthe evidence gathered by our past selves . The idea is that these\nactivities make sense only if a present person is identical to her\npast and future selves. Perdurantists may respond in one of two ways.\nFirst, they may argue that it is the whole, identical,\nfour-dimensional person who makes sacrifices, acts upon plans and\nreasons from evidence, via the activities of her temporal parts.\nAlternatively, they may accept that it is short-lived temporal parts\nwhich act, sacrifice and reason, but that past- and future-regarding\nactions can be justified by the intimate relations between distinct\ntemporal parts of the same person. Stage theorists must take this\nsecond route, for they claim that the person just is a brief stage,\nwho takes responsibility for the actions of her past counterparts, and\nacts to benefit her future counterparts.\n\nThere are a number of issues about coincidence involving people. For\nexample, it seems that we human people at least coincide with human\norganisms. You occupy the same location as a human organism right now,\nbut it seems that you differ in various ways: the organism may have\nexisted since conception, and will go on until biological death, but\nsome believe that the person does not come into existence until the\norganism is relatively well-developed, and that the person may cease\nto exist before biological death, by entering a persistent vegetative\nstate. You also seem to differ from the organism regarding\nwhat\u2019s possible: perhaps you could have been a robot, or a\ndisembodied intelligence, whereas the organism could not.\n\nCertain puzzle cases also seem to suggest that a person might divide\ninto two: suppose that, as a result of philosophical confusion on the\nhospital ethics committee, a doctor is permitted to remove the two\nhalves of your brain and implant them into two different (brainless)\nbodies. On one understanding of this process, each of the resulting\npeople has a good claim to be you. Is this a reason to think that two\ncoincident people were walking around together before the operation,\nand that they have only now been separated?\n\nMoreover, it seems that people are prone to indeterminacy, just like\ncrumbling buildings and bicycles: some people have gradual endings,\nand sometimes, in stories at least, a person can undergo such a\ntraumatic change that it\u2019s not clear whether the same person\nexists after the change.\n\nWe saw a number of ways of dealing with coincidence and indeterminacy\nmore generally, in\n section 4\n and\n section 5.\n But any talk of either partial or total coincidence involving people\ncan seem problematic, because of concerns about the use of\nfirst-person pronouns (who does your \u2018I\u2019 refer to before\nyour brain-splitting operation, if there are two of you?), and about\nmultiplying conscious entities (could two people have literally the\nsame headache? if you merely coincide with a human organism, are you\nsure it\u2019s you who has the headache, and not the organism?).\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether we should revise our theories\nof persistence as a consequence of these problems, or whether we\nshould revise our ideas about people. This \u2018too many\nthinkers\u2019 problem is discussed in more detail in the entry on\n personal identity.\n\nThe \u2018too many thinkers\u2019 problem looms even if we just\nconsider two entities, the person and the organism, but it\nproliferates if we adopt a combination of perdurantism and\nuniversalism (as discussed in\n section 8).\n On such a view, there seem to be a multitude of person-like entities\nsitting in your chair right now, each with slightly different\nstart-dates and end-dates. Perdurantists may argue that only the\nlongest-lived of these is really a person, and that the others are\nmere temporal parts of a person, but opponents resist this move.\n\nPeople are especially interesting, but metaphysical questions about\npersistence have been raised for objects of various other kinds,\nincluding musical works, social entities such as institutions or\ngroups of people, and biological species. It is often controversial\nwhat sort of entities these are \u2013 material objects, abstract\ntypes, processes, sets? \u2013 and so it is also controversial how\nfar the arguments discussed above, which focus on material objects,\nare relevant to these special cases. Useful articles elsewhere in this\nEncyclopedia include\n Philosophy of Music,\n Philosophy of Theater,\n Biological Individuals,\n and\n Social Ontology.\n\nFinally, this article has focused on debates about temporal parts\nwithin philosophy, with a dash of physics. However temporal parts are\nalso significant within applied ontology, where they may feature\nwithin the conceptual schemes adopted by computer scientists,\nbiologists and others to represent information systematically.\n\nSuggested Reading: There is a huge literature on\npersonal identity, but everyone should read Williams (1973) and Parfit\n(1971; then 1984 part 3 (at least)). Work on people which is informed\nby the broader debate about persistence includes Lowe (1996), Olson\n(1997; 2007), Merricks (2001), Baker (2000), Hudson (2001), Noonan\n(2003b), Tappenden (2011), Langford (2016), Oyowe (2016). Lewis (1976)\nand Hudson (1999) provide perdurantist accounts of people, while\nMerricks (1999b) advocates endurantism, and Brueckner (2009) responds\nto Merricks; Patrone (2017) advocates stage theory. Haslanger (1992)\nargues that rational enquirers must endure; Rosenkrantz (2005) argues\nfrom self-knowledge to endurance; Prosser (2006) uses the nature of\nexperience to explain away the appeal of endurantism in general;\nParsons (2015) argues from the nature of experience to stage theory,\nsee also Smith (2010); Brink (1997) discusses self-concern in a\nperdurantist framework; Broome (1991 chapter 11) discusses connections\nbetween theories of persistence and utilitarianism; Braddon-Mitchell\nand West (2001) argue that stages are primary. Other questions of\nethics and self-concern are addressed by Olson (2010), Tognazzini\n(2010), Taylor (2013), Miller (2014, 2015), Mullins (2014), and Briggs\nand Nolan (2015). Duncan (2015) argues from the temporal extendedness\nof thought to the falsity of certain views about personal persistence.\nDietz (2020) argues that temporal parts can be agents, whilst\nHochstetter (2015) argues that stages cannot act. Rimmel (2018) argues\nthat tensed belief creates difficulties for perdurantists. Hedden\n(2015) challenges many standard assumptions about the connection\nbetween personal persistence and rationality. Special concerns about\ncoincidence involving people, including \u2018too many\nthinkers\u2019 are discussed by Noonan (1999a), Merricks (2003),\nOlson (1997a), Shoemaker (1999), Sider (2003b), Sutton (2014),\nJohnston (2016, 2017), Kovacs (2016, 2019), Kaiserman (2019), Eklund\n(2019), and Longenecker (2019). Burke (1997b), Ehring (1995), Heller\n(2000), Roache (2010), Wasserman (2005) and Demarest (2016) are also\nrelevant. \n\nDodd (2004), Thomasson (2004), Caplan and Matheson (2006), Tillman\n(2011), Aliyev (2017), Moruzzi (2018), Alward (2019), Friedell (2020)\ndiscuss the persistence of musical works. Slater and Varzi (2007),\nJansen (2008), Hansson Wahlberg (2014a), Epstein (2015 ch.12), Hawley\n(2017), Faller (2019), Hansson Wahlberg (2019), and Wilhelm (2020)\ndiscuss the persistence of social entities. Merkouris (2014) discusses\nthe persistence of legal treaties. Reydon (2008) discusses biological\nspecies. Nicholson and Dupre eds. (2018) is an open-access collection\nincluding many interesting articles about the persistence and broader\nmetaphysics of biological entities, from a \u2018process\u2019\nperspective. A final very special case: Baber (2002) discusses\nGod\u2019s temporal parts; for discussion see the entry on\n the Trinity.\n There are many resources on applied ontology at the Buffalo Ontology\nSite (see Other Internet Resources), whilst Bittner, Donnelly and\nSmith (2004) explicitly discusses endurance and perdurance in an\napplied ontology context. \n",
