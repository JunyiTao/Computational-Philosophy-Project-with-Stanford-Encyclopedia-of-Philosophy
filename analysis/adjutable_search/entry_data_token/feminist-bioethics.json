The Development of Feminist Bioethics\n1.1 Introduction\n\nBioethics is the hybrid discipline that attends to the ethical\nimplications of developments in the life sciences, especially\nbiomedical research and practice, public health, the delivery of\nhealthcare services, and the socio-ethical impacts of technology.\nSince it first emerged as a distinct approach in applied philosophy,\nbioethics has blossomed into a substantial interdisciplinary field,\ndrawing on a highly diverse range of scholarship, including\nphilosophy, theology, law, medicine, and the biological sciences, and\nincreasingly turning to the social sciences and humanities.\n\nChronicles of bioethics tend to argue that it originated as a response\nto two main factors. First, medical developments in the mid-twentieth\ncentury raised issues beyond the limits of conventional medical\nethics\u2019 focus on intraprofessional conduct and the\nphysician-patient dyad. Second, this period also saw growing\nrecognition of historical atrocities in medical research (such as the\nexperimentation on inmates of concentration and extermination camps\nduring the Nazi Third Reich that led directly to the Nuremberg\nDoctors\u2019 Trial and, indirectly, to the first set of research\nethics guidelines in the Nuremberg Code of 1947). But this narrative,\nwhile not wrong, omits the broader political and intellectual context\nof the milieu within which bioethics developed. The 1960s saw social\ntransformation in many parts of the world, and in its early days at\nleast, bioethics\u2019 focus on those who might be harmed by medical\npractice reflected these social and cultural changes. Like many young\ndisciplines, it has also been open to a wide range of theoretical and\nmethodological approaches. This may be one reason why feminist\nbioethics was able to develop rapidly and strongly as a distinctive\nsub-field within it.\n1.2 Emergence and early days\n\nThe roots of feminist bioethics can be found in both feminist activism\nand feminist theory. In the early years of second wave feminism, the\nwomen\u2019s healthcare movement identified many areas where\nwomen\u2019s interests were severely neglected. While feminist\nactivism identified problematic areas and mobilized protest,\nthe academic critique provided a theoretical framework to\nshow that mainstream biomedicine and bioethics are fundamentally\ngendered in ways that affect both how the life sciences are researched\nand implemented and how this research and practice are\nethically analyzed. In other words, feminists were saying that not\nonly does bioethics give too little attention to gender-specific\ndisparities in healthcare research and treatment, but that the\ngendered perspective from which mainstream bioethics identifies\nmorally troubling issues and their ethically salient features makes it\nunable (or much less likely) to account adequately for certain\ninjustices, biases or harms in any given scenario (Tong 1997; Sherwin\n2008; Scully et al. 2010).\n\nIn its earliest phase, feminist bioethics focused on topics that were\npatently being neglected by the mainstream. Inevitably, these were\nareas that could traditionally be seen as \u201cwomen\u2019s\nissues\u201d: anything to do with reproduction, including abortion\nand the assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) emerging at that\ntime, but also the exclusion of women from medical research, the role\nof psychiatry and its treatment of women, and the increasing\nmedicalization and commodification of women\u2019s bodies. These\nperspectives cast new light on even well-examined terrain. For\nexample, although ethical issues within clinical research have been\nexhaustively mapped out, it took feminist analyses to highlight that\nthe routine exclusion of women from clinical research, on the grounds\nthat the \u201canomalies\u201d of female physiology generate\nunreliable data, was ethically problematic (Sherwin 1994; Baylis &\nHalperin 2012; Baylis & Ballantyne 2016).\n\nPioneering work included a ground-breaking anthology, Feminist\nPerspectives in Medical Ethics (Holmes & Purdy 1992), and the\nfirst monograph treatment of feminist bioethical theory, Susan\nSherwin\u2019s No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics and Health\nCare, (Sherwin 1992). A major milestone was the publication of\nRosemary Tong\u2019s, Feminist Approaches to Bioethics:\nTheoretical Reflections and Practical Applications (Tong 1997).\nIn 1993, the International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics\n(FAB) was founded and since 1996 has held its own biennial Congress in\nassociation with the World Congress on Bioethics. To further the\ndevelopment of feminist bioethics, in 2007 FAB established its own\njournal, the International Journal of Feminist Approaches to\nBioethics (IJFAB). From the outset, IJFAB has\nbeen committed to expanding the field of bioethics to include a wide\nrange of areas relevant to women\u2019s healthcare and related\nresearch.\n\nHowever, it is important to realize that feminist bioethics is\ncharacterized less by the areas that it addresses or ethical theories\nthat it draws on, than by its particular approach to ethical analysis.\nThe combination of attention to practical issues, distinctive\nconceptual commitments, and the explicit ethical-political goal of\nachieving equality and justice for women is the hallmark of feminist\nbioethics. The following sections will first identify the feminist\nperspectives on ontology and epistemology that are foundational to\nthis approach; show how these commitments shape feminist approaches to\nbioethical analyses; and then outline two areas of theory, care ethics\nand relational autonomy, that have been developed within feminist\nbioethics and have also enriched theoretical bioethics more generally.\nFinally, this entry considers the future of feminist bioethics in the\ntwenty-first century.\n2. Foundational Feminist Perspectives\n2.1 Ontology\n\nFeminist philosophy favors a moral ontology that contrasts sharply\nwith that of traditional moral philosophy. In a now well-rehearsed\ncritique, feminists argue that the model of the agential subject used\nin mainstream moral and political thought reflects rather too closely\nthe gendered social and political environment in which it was first\ndevised (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000). This model identifies the self\nas a singular, isolated locus of consciousness, with little account\ngiven to either the particularities of the body or the familial and\ncommunity contexts within which moral agents operate except where\nembodiment and social embeddedness are thought to compromise moral\nagency. Feminist moral theory has long argued that this picture is\nflawed, and in the end, ethically treacherous, because it leaves out\nmany features of human life that are essential to genuine moral\nselfhood and agency. Mainstream theory was (and often still is)\ndevised by the most privileged members of societies in which privilege\nis distributed according to sex and class. Feminist theory notes that\nthis has resulted in the perspectives and experiences of men being\nmistaken for universals, and the perspectives and experiences of women\n(shaped by the biological fact of female embodiment and the social\nfact of subordinate status) being dismissed. In the nonideal world,\nmoral subjects are embodied beings, and the particularities\nof their bodies are morally relevant; they are also linked to known\nand unknown others through dependencies and responsibilities that are\noften unchosen; and these connections to other persons are asymmetric\nas a rule rather than exceptionally. This moral ontology gives a more\naccurate depiction of reality and is therefore a more theoretically\nuseful model.\n\nIt is only fair to acknowledge that contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy has engaged to some extent with these critiques from\nfeminists and others, and as a result some would now consider this to\nbe a caricature of its views. Nevertheless, it is still relatively\nrare to see nonfeminist applied ethics, including bioethics,\ndescribing moral subjects and agents in explicitly socially embedded\nand embodied terms.\n2.2 Epistemology\n\nThe dominant form of epistemology within feminist bioethics is\nsimilarly social. The knowledge to which individuals have access is\ncollectively generated, maintained, circulated and conveyed, and the\nmoral subject of feminist bioethics therefore has epistemic resources\nthat differ markedly from those available to the traditional singular\nself. Moreover, gendered social identities have the effect of shaping\nthe epistemic resources that are available to the inhabitants of those\nidentities (Harding 1991; Wylie 2003). The situated epistemic\nresources of marginalized social identities will differ from those of\nmore powerful groups, and vice versa. Beyond an awareness of the\nsituated nature of knowledge, feminist standpoint epistemology\npresents the stronger claim that marginalized identities have a unique\nepistemic insight into the specific effects of power maldistribution\n(Hartsock 1983; Grasswick 2004; Harding 2009; Intemann 2010; see also\nSEP entries by Anderson on\n feminist epistemology\n and Grasswick on\n feminist social epistemology).\n\nSocial positioning also determines whether the knowledge a person has\nis considered credible by members of her own or other groups. Gendered\nor otherwise biased social and political structures generate skewed\ndistributions of epistemic authority, leading to a variety of forms of\nepistemic injustice\u2014an idea that has been developed in many\ntheoretical directions and widely disseminated through moral and\npolitical philosophy (Fricker 2007; Code 2014; Dotson 2014; Pohlhaus\n2017; Grasswick 2018). In summary, where traditional epistemology\nlooks at how individuals acquire and use information, from a feminist\nperspective the center of attention shifts to the social and political\nstructures within which knowledge is created and maintained, and\nepistemic injustice can occur. Epistemic injustice refers to the\nunfair ways in which the knowledge of individuals who belong to\nsocially marginalized and stigmatized groups is treated. The most\ncommonly described forms or families of epistemic injustice are\ntestimonial and hermeneutical. Testimonial injustice describes those\nsituations where a person\u2019s identity results in their statements\nbeing ignored or disbelieved: a relevant example would be the vaginal\nmesh scandal, in which women\u2019s claims of pain and injury were\ndisregarded (O\u2019Neill 2021). Hermeneutical injustice on the other\nhand occurs when a person\u2019s or group\u2019s knowledge is\nexcluded from the collective epistemic resources (the things\n\u201ceveryone knows\u201d) because their knowledge is dismissed as\nunimportant or irrelevant. An example here would be the overall lack\nof data about pregnant women\u2019s responses to common medication\nbecause of their historical exclusion from clinical research. This\nexclusion was justified on ethical grounds (the protection of the\nsupposedly vulnerable woman and foetus), but the ethical evaluation\nwas based on unjustified sexist assumptions.\n\nFeminist epistemology therefore drives a re-examination of how ethical\nissues are perceived and described, whose experiences are afforded\ncredibility, how (and by whom) an issue is defined as\n\u201cmoral\u201d in the first place, and how consensus on what\nconstitutes a robust ethical evaluation is shaped by the social\norganization of epistemic authority.\n3. Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis\n\nThese foundational feminist perspectives on ontology and\nepistemology provide the key theoretical orientations for\nfeminist bioethics. Ethical analyses need to account for how real\nmoral agents are formed and behave, combined with a more critical\nunderstanding of the social, political, and other forces that shape\nthe experiences, knowledge, and judgments of differently situated\npeople. These priorities lie behind the critique of mainstream\nbioethics\u2019 tendency to favor ideal theory and to work from a set\nof highly abstract principles, its isolation of moral problems from\ntheir context, and its neglect of, or lack of interest in, the\nperspectives of subordinated social groups.\n\nThis background means that feminist approaches to bioethical analyses\ntend to share characteristic features. These include attention to\npower dynamics and social context; the use of empirical data to inform\ntheory; the weight given to relationality and care, and to the moral\nsignificance of embodiment and materiality; and greater openness to\nand incorporation of marginalized perspectives.\n3.1 Power dynamics and social context\n\nIn all societies we know of, human relationships are shaped by\narrangements of social and political power that favor men and enable\nthe oppression of women in a variety of ways, both covert and overt.\nFeminist bioethics looks at the micro-, meso-, and macro-level\norganizations of power in the moral difficulties that are encountered\nwithin healthcare and research. The examination of these power\nrelations not only provides a gendered reframing of bioethics\u2019\ntraditional clinical focus, for example by considering how paternalism\nin the doctor-patient dyad works differently according to the sex of\neach, but also provides a broader insight into the structural\nunderpinnings of seemingly isolated instances of moral wrong. In doing\nso, feminist bioethics extends in two dimensions beyond what is\nconventionally considered to fall within the confines of healthcare:\nto the previously unnoticed small-scale microaggressions (Freeman\n& Stewart 2019), and at the other end of the scale to the global\neconomic structures that maintain entrenched patterns of social and\npolitical domination over women\u2019s lives. Feminist bioethicists\nalso go beyond the analysis of sex and gender to consider how the\ndistribution of power plays out across other categories of race,\nsexual orientation, disability, age, and so on.\n\nThese broader analyses were a key factor in feminist bioethics\u2019\ninterest in the social determinants of health and in their\nunderstanding that structural social inequities are fundamental to\ngenerating differentials in people\u2019s health, anticipating by\nsome years the concerns of public health ethics articulated since the\nmid-2000s. Feminist authors, for example, have highlighted that the\ndistribution of political and economic power is visible in the way\nthat public health processes focus on the effects of social\nmarginalization and exclusion but pay less attention to the underlying\ncauses (Rogers 2006; Baylis, Kenny, & Sherwin 2008).\n3.2 Use of situated empirical and experiential knowledge\n\nFeminism is based on the observation that a person\u2019s experience\nis sexed and gendered and will differ in important ways depending on\nwhether that person is biologically male or female, or lives as a man\nor a woman. And because the organization of power is also gendered,\nthe issue of whose perspectives matter (or are noticed at all) will\nreflect the needs and demands of the most powerful. Feminist analyses\nare therefore sensitive to the stratifications that make it unlikely\nthat we (whoever we are) have an overarching view of even the most\nfamiliar situations. For bioethics, this limitation is compounded by\nits focus on life science and biomedical innovation, and on\ntechnologies and practices that have yet to establish themselves in\neveryday life. As an example, the growth of assisted reproductive\ntechnologies very obviously demanded new forms of health policy and\ngovernance. Less obviously, it also generated new professional and\nprivate identities and behaviors linked to being a parent, child, or\nsibling, novel forms of families (such as same-sex couples with\ngenetically related children), and rapidly evolving relationships\nbetween legislation and private life (Baylis & McLeod 2014).\n\nThe experiential basis of feminism and the novelty of the practices\nthat bioethics deals with both lead to the conclusion that normative\njudgments should be based in what Margaret Walker famously referred to\nas \u201cthe actual moral and social orders\u201d, i.e., knowledge\nof what is actually going on rather than assumptions about\nhow we think things might be (Walker 1998). Where that\nknowledge is not available it must be acquired. So, although much of\nbioethics took an empirical turn in the early 2000s, feminist\nbioethics has a particularly strong orientation towards the use of\nempirical methods to anchor any descriptive and normative claims in\nthe realities of natural, social, political, and institutional worlds.\nThere is also a leaning towards qualitative methods of inquiry to\ncapture morally salient differences that track not only with sex and\ngender, but also with class, ethnicity, sexuality, and so on. As a\nresult, some feminist bioethicists are involved in developing\nempirical methodologies to provide appropriate material for normative\nreasoning, while others work on clarifying the always problematic\nrelationship between empirical data and normative conclusions (Scully\n2016).\n3.3 Importance of the body and embodiment\n\nWomen\u2019s lives are shaped by the materiality of having/being a\nbody that deviates from the male norm. Feminist theory recognizes the\npolitical and moral importance of the body, and part of feminist\nbioethics\u2019 central criticism of mainstream bioethics is that as\nwell as being abstract and decontextualized, it also reflects a\ndisembodied view of moral life. This in turn creates an obliviousness\nto the moral significance of embodied particularity. Medical science\nhas a long history of dismissing the female body as\n\u201canomalous\u201d, and because it also tends to equate anomaly\nwith pathology, it has an equally long history of pathologizing\nwomen\u2019s bodies. Early feminist bioethicists, including Susan\nBordo (1993) and Mary Mahowald (1993), published work examining\nmedical and cultural attitudes toward women\u2019s bodies.\nSubsequently, an influential strand of work within feminist bioethics\nhas moved from the moral consideration of the normatively sexed\nand gendered body to reflecting more generally on what is means\nto have/be an anomalous body, including raced and disabled bodies,\nintersex bodies, or bodies that are of nonstandard shape or size\n(Reiheld 2015; Dolezal 2015; MacKay 2017). Some of the most\ninteresting work in this area takes a phenomenological approach to the\nexperiences of pregnancy, lesbian or transgender embodiment, and\ndisability or illness. Susan Wendell\u2019s The Rejected\nBody (1996) was an early instance of a large body of feminist\nbioethical writing that relates to disability.\n3.4 Listening to marginalized voices\n\nFeminist bioethics is distinctive in the emphasis it places on\nrecognizing the historical and continuing exclusion of minority\nviewpoints as a form of epistemic injustice in which the knowledge of\nmarginalized groups is kept out of mainstream bioethics. From early\non, feminist bioethics looked beyond the marginalization of sex and\ngender to other forms of exclusion, and sought to identify how power\nrelations interacting with minority statuses can perpetuate moral\nharms in research, clinical care, and public health. The dismissal of\nthe experiences and perspectives of women, Black, or disabled people\nis now increasingly acknowledged in bioethics. However, feminist\nanalyses also illuminate relevant examples of damaging exclusions that\nfall outside the boundaries of familiar minority categories or\nprotected characteristics. These include the suppression of\n\u201canomalous\u201d knowledge that is assumed to be distorted by\nmental illness (Bluhm 2011; Thachuk 2011) and the silence within\nmainstream bioethics about the role of low-paid care workers in\nhealthcare. They have also drawn connections between epistemic\ninjustice and feminist work on microaggressions experienced by\npatients in clinical settings (Buchman et al. 2017; Freeman &\nStewart 2019).\n3.5 Political commitment/activism\n\nA final characteristic of feminist bioethics that draws together all\nthe other distinctive features is its political commitment. While\nfeminist bioethics, like feminist ethics more broadly, is an academic\ndiscipline, it originated in and alongside a social-political movement\nwith the aims of global justice and equality for women. Feminist\ntheory has always attempted to connect the personal with the\npolitical. In the context of ethics, this means something more than\njust expanding the ethical frame of reference beyond person to person\ninteractions to the institutional or societal scale; it means an\nunderstanding that individual and interpersonal issues are\nfundamentally shaped by broader socio-political forces. Hence,\nfeminist bioethics always has a perspective that pushes beyond the\nstraightforward characterization of a moral concern in medicine or\nlife sciences, and even beyond examining why it has arisen. A feminist\napproach to bioethics pushes towards identifying and catalyzing social\nand political change to create better lives for women.\n4. Feminist Contributions to Bioethics Theory\n\nThe distinctive analytic toolkit of feminist bioethics has made\nsignificant theoretical contributions to bioethical thinking. Its\nclose relationship with feminism as a political movement has made\nfeminist bioethics highly critical of philosophical bioethics\u2019\nusual privileging of ideal theory (in the sense of being based around\nthe kind of world we would like to have) and of the search\nfor universalizable principles. Both these approaches tend to increase\nthe appeal of abstraction more, making it harder to see the world as\nit is, with persisting inequality and discrimination, and so obscure\nthe need for radical change and especially for realistic ways to\nachieve it. Feminist ethics has responded through the production of\nits own conceptual contributions to broader ethical theory. The most\nsignificant and best known of these are the ethics of care/care\n ethics[1]\n and the concept of relational autonomy.\n4.1 Ethic of care/care ethics\n\nThe idea that care could form the basis of a distinct approach to\nethical theory took shape after the publication of psychologist Carol\nGilligan\u2019s now-famous work on gender-based differences in moral\nevaluation, In a Different Voice (1982). Drawing on empirical\ndata Gilligan attempted to show that patterns of moral reasoning that\nprioritize care practices, chosen and unchosen relationships, and the\nacknowledgment of mutual responsibilities are more characteristic of\nwomen, while alternative modes focusing on justice, rights, and the\nelaboration of overarching moral principles are more likely to be used\nby men. Subsequent commentators, including some feminist bioethics,\nhave been highly critical of Gilligan\u2019s conclusions. Some, for\nexample, have complained about her own use of stereotypical gendered\nnorms in her work. Others are skeptical of the supposedly rigidly\ngendered distribution of care versus justice-based ethics,\nsuggesting that the difference is linked not to gender per se but to\nthe experience of being socially and politically marginalized, and\ntherefore more likely to turn to the relational networks of community\nfor support than to institutional justice-based systems (see, e.g.,\nCortese 1990). Other areas of continuing debate are whether the ethic\nof care counts as a form of virtue ethics, or whether conversely it\nonly appears so because it cannot be neatly slotted within the\ntraditional taxonomies of ethical theory (Halwani 2003; Groenhout\n2014; Sander-Staudt 2006).\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of the importance of care has given rise\nto an extraordinarily rich body of work within feminist thought (Held\n2006; Gary 2022) and has had considerable influence beyond. By\ndifferentiating between various understandings of care and by paying\nattention to the moral subtleties of relational bonds, the ethics of\ncare exposes problems and suggests approaches that are overlooked by\njustice-oriented frameworks. Unsurprisingly, the ethics of care has\nproven to be especially appealing in biomedicine and public health,\nfields where the notion of \u201ccaring for\u201d is central\n(although often unexamined). In many ways, however, the value of the\nethic of care lies less in the centrality of care as a practice than\nin its ability to challenge the conventional understanding that\ndependence relationships are restricted to specific circumstances\n(such as infancy or illness) rather than something in which all of us\nare embedded at all points of our lives. In particular, care ethicists\nhighlight the fact that relationships involving care are often\nunchosen and always unbalanced. Moreover, by reframing care as\ndependency work, ethicists such as Kittay (1999) and Kittay and Feder\n(2003) demonstrate the ubiquity of dependency in the form of dependent\ninteractions in communities that do not involve obvious care\npractices. Positioning unbalanced relations as the norm rather than\nthe exception contrasts starkly with the view of ethical theories in\nwhich normal social and moral life consists mainly of reciprocal,\nnegotiated relationships between equals and dependence is invariably\nundesirable if not outright pathological.\n\nA longstanding criticism of the ethic of care is its potential naivety\nabout those care relationships that are themselves exploitative or\nunjust. Further, it has been attacked for lacking a robust political\nperspective that can adequately account for and unsettle larger-scale\npatterns of domination and oppression affecting women. In response,\nsome authors have visibly extended the ethic of care\u2019s reach to\ninclude structural, systemic, and global issues (Carse & Lindemann\nNelson 1996; Ruddick 1989; Noddings 2002; Held 2006). Joan\nTronto\u2019s Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic\nof Care (1993) was an early attempt to craft a political theory\nintegrating the practice of care into the organization of life in a\ndemocratic and pluralistic society, as was the anthology\nSocializing Care edited by Hamington and Miller (2006).\n\nOthers have teased out the connections between care and associated\nmoral concepts such as dependence, agency, and autonomy. An example is\na growing body of recent work on vulnerability as a useful moral\nconcept (Hurst 2008; Mackenzie, Rogers, & Dodds 2014; Luna 2014,\n2019; Miller 2020). The terminology of \u201cvulnerable\ngroups\u201d, to denote people who are collectively more likely to\nsuffer disadvantage, harm, or exploitation in research or other\ncontexts, is key to many aspects of research ethics especially\ninformed consent, and increasingly appears in public health ethics\ntoo. However, this use of vulnerability tends not to examine the\nforces that lead to the existence of vulnerable groups in the first\nplace. By contrast, feminist authors pay close attention to the way\nthat social and political circumstances can generate or exacerbate\nvulnerabilities. One example is provided by the intrinsic biological\nvulnerability of extreme old age: the extent to which it is\nexperienced as problematic is heavily influenced by other factors such\nas poverty, lack of secure housing and healthcare, and social\nisolation. Furthermore, a population\u2019s vulnerability to famine\nmay be the result of climate change (Macklin 2012; Reiheld 2016).\n4.2 Relationality and relational autonomy\n\nFeminist bioethics\u2019 approach to care is grounded in its\nrelational ontology, that is the claim that the self is constituted\nthrough relationships, as discussed earlier. As Annette Baier\nwrote,\n\n\nA person, perhaps, is best seen as one who was long enough dependent\nupon other persons to acquire the essential arts of personhood.\nPersons essentially are second persons, who grow up with\nother persons. (Baier 1985: 84)\n\n\nThis theoretical basis in turn underpins the moral significance of\nrelationality, and the responsibilities and obligations of\nrelationships, particularly in the context of healthcare. These\nrelationships arise between patient and healthcare providers, patients\nand families, and include more novel forms such as those between a\ngamete or embryo donor, and the children that result (Sherwin &\nStockdale 2017).\n\nA relational model of the self sees individuals as inextricably\nconnected in an enduring network of familial, community, and wider\nconnections that create and sustain them as persons. Feminism\u2019s\nrelational view of the self provides the basis for a distinctive view\nof the autonomous self, called relational autonomy, in which autonomy\nis not a property of a person but is effected through the networks of\ninteraction that make up social life (Donchin 2000; Mackenzie &\nStoljar 2000). Relational autonomy considers a person\u2019s capacity\nfor self-determination to be dependent on the\nconnections\u2014personal and institutional\u2014that come into\nplay, and whether these foster or constrain autonomous action depends\non the detail of precisely how they operate in the given situation.\nThis view is in stark contrast to moral philosophy\u2019s traditional\nformulation of personal autonomy as the individual\u2019s capacity to\nact as an independent decision-maker, uncontaminated by any influence\nfrom or concerns about other agents. Ethical analyses based on this\nideal generally omit as irrelevant the particularities of\nintrafamilial relationships, as well as the wider context of\ninstitutional power relationships and social dynamics that influence\npatient options, and the medical research priorities that shape\nthem.\n\nRelational autonomy is not simply a statement about practicalities\n(that we need others in order to realize our choices), but a claim\nthat the internal capacity to be self-determining is itself a result\nof early experiences in family and community that provide us with the\ntools to reflect on how we want our lives to go and how to make that\nhappen. According to relational autonomy theorists, autonomy is not a\nproperty possessed by all competent adults, but a developmental\nachievement that requires social cooperation and supportive\ninstitutions. The crucial point is that feminism\u2019s critique is\nnot that the traditional concept of autonomy is unachievable because\npeople are constrained from exercising authentic autonomy due to their\nsocial entanglements. Rather, it is that this model is just\nfundamentally wrong, because it is exactly that network of\nrelationships that provides the conditions of possibility for\nself-determination and self-actualization in the first place. Autonomy\nis inherently produced through relationships, not compromised by\nthem.\n\nRespect for the autonomy of the individual patient or research subject\nis a core principle of bioethics, underpinning informed consent and\npatient choice. Indeed, mainstream bioethics and medical ethics have\nsometimes been accused of effectively reducing autonomy to informed\nconsent and the ability of a patient to select between a limited set\nof clinical options. From a feminist point of view, a more adequate\nconceptualization of autonomy must take into account the entirety of\nthe relational context. Combined with feminist theory\u2019s focus on\nthe power structures of systems and institutions, relational autonomy\npushes beyond the analysis of interpersonal constraints on patient\nautonomy (e.g., the authority differential between patient and\nhealthcare provider) to consider the effects of larger scale\nstructures and environments, and of social norms and pressures. For\nexample, Carolyn Ells uses a Foucauldian analysis to argue that the\nstandard depiction of patient choice relies on a false model that\ntreats them as if they existed outside the relations of power that in\nfact are diffused throughout society, and to consider the implications\nof a relational model of autonomy for the practice of patient-centered\ncare (Ells 2003; Ells et al. 2011).\n\nWhile accepting that the principle of respect for autonomy has been\nessential to the protection of individual liberty, including the\nliberty of women, feminist bioethics has considerable reservations\nabout its relevance to socially disempowered groups for whom the\npossibilities of self-determination are always constrained by\nmaterial, social, and political factors (Gibson 2019). Serene Khader\n(2020) has expressed concern that relational autonomy theorists\nimplicitly hold that autonomy can only be achieved in ideal\nconditions, which in reality means never. Other feminists have\nexamined how autonomy can be constrained by features that are less\nobviously a product of power relationships or oppressive social\nenvironments. McLeod (2002) has used examples from reproductive\nmedicine to show that encounters with healthcare providers can\nundermine a woman\u2019s self-trust, thereby threatening her\nautonomy. Meanwhile, feminist attention to the moral relevance of\nembodied experience has identified trauma, abuse, inexperience,\nimpairment or illness, and relational responses to these states, as\npotentially compromising autonomy (Donchin 2000; Brison 2001; Goering\n2009; Scully 2010; McDonald 2018).\n5. Feminist Contributions to Thematic Areas\n5.1 Reproduction, reproductive medicine, and assisted reproductive technologies\n\nMany people assume that bioethics is feminist when it addresses\n\u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d, such as pregnancy or menopause.\nThe roots of this misperception can be traced both to the\ndiscipline\u2019s origins in women\u2019s health activism, and the\nfact that many feminists were drawn into the field by their interest\nin the burgeoning technologies of assisted reproduction in the 1990s\nand 2000s. Reproductive issues are seen as \u201cfeminist\u201d\nsimply because both biologically and socially they tend to affect\nwomen more than men. And in practice, the first decades of feminist\nbioethics were dominated by writing on contraception and abortion, and\nthe medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth. There was a particular\nfocus on how societies in general and healthcare in particular should\nrespond to the industrialized growth of assisted reproductive\ntechnologies (ARTs) (in vitro fertilization, surrogate pregnancy, egg\nand embryo donation, artificial insemination by donor). This has been\nextended to more recent techniques such as mitochondrial transfer,\ntechniques of selective reproduction (prenatal testing, diagnosis, and\nscreening; preimplantation genetic diagnosis; preconception testing;\nand genome editing), and the ability to generate, test, and manipulate\nembryos ex vivo (e.g., Wolf 1996; Gupta 2000; Rapp 2000; Shanley 2001;\nKukla 2005; Mullin 2005; Harwood 2007; McLeod 2009; Baylis 2013;\nBaylis & McLeod 2014).\n\nThis work on reproduction is identifiably feminist not simply because\nit addresses issues that are of greater salience to women, but because\nit reflects the characteristic features of feminist bioethical\napproaches discussed earlier. It starts from the experiential\nperspective of women, and it consciously examines the systemic and\ninterpersonal power differentials that determine how these\ntechnologies were developed, delivered, and experienced. A feminist\nframework enables a different kind of ethical evaluation of\nthe practices of reproductive medicine and ARTs than mainstream\nbioethics can provide. A key insight is that because women bear a\ndisproportionate share of the associated risks and burdens, new\nreproductive technologies are not gender neutral, a fact frequently\nignored in debates about the ethics of assisted reproduction. Thus,\nfeminist work highlights the potential that research into and use of\nthese technologies holds for issues such as the exploitation of\nwomen\u2019s bodies and body tissues (Turkmendag 2022), the unequal\ndistribution of the physical and psychological burdens of fertility\ntreatments between women and men, the impact of ARTs on women\u2019s\ncareer plans, and many others (Dickenson 2013; Ballantyne 2014).\n\nSome feminist ethicists have also attempted to place reproductive\nethics in the wider context of both social expectations of maternity\nand parenthood, and the accepted norms of the human body. There are\nconcerns that the fertility industry has a vested interest in\nreinforcing a set of social expectations that women will do (and pay)\nanything to have children and will turn to whatever technology is on\noffer if they have difficulty conceiving due to a medical condition or\nsimply because of their age (Warren 1988; Parks 1999). Similarly, the\navailability of testing and screening technologies, and potentially of\ngenomic editing, exerts pressure on women (and men) to produce only\n\u201cperfect\u201d children (Rothman 1986 [1993]; Rapp 2000; Mills\n2015; de Melo-Mart\u00edn 2017). Alongside the health benefits they\nmay offer, these technologies may increase the stigma experienced by\ndisabled children and their families and exacerbate social\ninequalities. Many of these issues overlap with others known to\ndisproportionately affect women, such as the impact of caregiving\nresponsibilities and the effect of particular economic policies on\nsocially marginalized groups, while some feminist bioethicists draw\nparallels between the ways that both the female body and the disabled\nbody are seen as deviations from the (nondisabled, male) norm of human\nembodiment (Scully 2022).\n\nFeminist bioethics has also contributed to the ethical analysis of the\nuse of reproductive tissues for research or to circumvent infertility.\nInsight into the routes through which eggs, embryos, and other\nreproductive material flow into and circulate in contemporary medicine\nand research raises questions about the potential exploitation of\nwomen and women\u2019s bodily tissue. Examples of this include\ngroundbreaking work by Donna Dickenson (2007) on property and\nownership of the body and body parts, and by Catherine Waldby, Robert\nMitchell and Melinda Cooper on the global economy of reproductive\ntissues (Waldby & Mitchell 2006; Cooper & Waldby 2014). One of\nthe key issues raised by these discussions is how to recognize when\nwomen (and others) are being exploited as producers of bodily material\nfor research in the increasingly common situations where the research\ntakes place in the context of medical treatment, such as for\ninfertility.\n5.2 Practices of care\n\nFeminist ethics\u2019 theoretical contribution to the ethic of care\nwas discussed in section 4. This section considers feminist\nbioethics\u2019 critical examination of the practices of health and\nother forms of care. Mainstream bioethics rarely focuses on care as a\ncore ethical practice, and when it does, it generally fails to\ndistinguish between the different types of care performed by nurses,\npersonal care assistants, care workers and others, and fails to\nhighlight the economic and political invisibility of the unpaid care\nwork provided by family members (Parks 2003).\n\nFor bioethics, care ethics focuses primarily on relationships in the\nclinical setting or the home, and on the micro level of interactions\nbetween individual caregiver or healthcare professional and care\nrecipient. Feminist care ethics notes that the mundane labor of care\nis low status and poorly paid, and (not unrelatedly) strongly\ngendered, and justifications for the limits to medical and social care\nservices provided by state or by commercial providers often assume\nthat the primary responsibility for the care of dependent family\nmembers is most naturally shouldered by women. Not least because of\nthis, the caring aspect of medicine is often dismissed as\n\u201chousekeeping\u201d and compared unfavorably to heroic\nbiomedical interventions or the \u201ccrisis issues\u201d that\ndominate bioethical discussion.\n\nFresh interest in the moral structure of caregiving has been generated\nby two particular developments\u2014one technical, the other social.\nFirst, novel assisted reproductive technologies including egg and\nembryo donation and mitochondrial transfer have led to the emergence\nof new family forms and structures (Cutas & Chan 2012; Hudson\n2020). Relatedly, other authors note that the increasing\ntechnologization of medicine, combined with changes in work patterns\nand expectations, makes it harder to integrate care for family members\nwith the demands of modern workplaces and practices. They critically\nexamine the ambiguous consequences for women, and for the recipients\nof care, of the replacement of traditional care practices by\ntechnology, for example by care robots (Parks 2010; Gary 2021) or\nother forms of artificial intelligence (Vallor 2011).\n\nSecond, demographic changes mean that nations of the Global North are\nexperiencing the aging of their populations with a concomitant\nincreased demand for both medical and social care (Holstein 2013).\nCombined with the economic and political forces shrinking health and\nwelfare public services, these demographic changes in many parts of\nthe world mean that care responsibilities are shifting away from state\nprovision and back onto families, thereby reinforcing traditional\nfamily structures in which women are the main providers of care\n(Noddings 2002). A significant amount of feminist work examines the\norganization of familial versus societal care responsibilities. In\nthis vein feminist bioethicists such as Rosemarie Tong (2009) and\nMonique Lanoix (2013) have written on the discriminatory impact on\nwomen of long-term care work, including the ethics of the national and\ninternational arrangements of care for children, elderly, and\nchronically ill people. Globalization has fostered an explosion in\ninternational migrant care work, in which women move from poorer to\nricher countries to provide care for children and elderly or disabled\nand chronically ill people. Such transnational displacement of care\nprovision mainly affects women from socially marginalized groups and\nhas enduring and complex consequences for them, their families, and\ntheir countries of origin (Weir 2008; Eckenwiler 2011, 2013).\n\nMoving beyond practices that are readily identifiable in conventional\nterms as care, there is also a focus of work within feminist bioethics\non the broader role of the family in decision-making about individuals\nin clinical and public health contexts (Lindemann et al. 2019).\nConflict or ambiguities in care responsibilities become most visible\nin high profile cases about end-of-life care, but there is growing\nawareness of the need for an overall more robust theoretical framework\nto encompass a broader understanding of the moral significance of\nfamilies. Finally, other recent work illustrates the expansion in\nscope and scale of the application of care ethics, including care in\nglobal pandemics (Gary & Berlinger 2020), the concept of caring\ninstitutions (Bourgault 2020), care on a geopolitical scale (Robinson\n2011; Vaittinen et al. 2019), and care as environmental responsibility\n(Laugier 2015).\n5.3 Disability and other non-standard embodiments\n\nBiomedicine\u2019s view of the female body as a troublesome deviation\nfrom a standard male norm has rarely been questioned by mainstream\nscholars. Not surprisingly, feminist bioethics has taken a more\nskeptical approach to the categorization of normal and abnormal\nbodies, and has developed a rich exploration of what it means\nbioethically to have or to be a \u201cnon-standard\u201d body,\nwhether by virtue of sex, gender, age, race, class, or disability.\nEngaging with the work of disability scholars, for example, feminist\nbioethicists have critically examined the way the impaired body is\nconstrued. They have gone beyond some well-trodden bioethical issues\nin the regulation of technologies to prevent, cure, or ameliorate\ndisability, producing a body of theoretical work on, for example, the\nsocial and cultural expectations of normality and the norms of\ndependency and vulnerability (Fine & Asch 1988; Kittay 1999; Wong\n2002; Tremain 2005; Scully 2008, 2014; Hall 2011; Ho 2011; Reynolds\n& Silvers 2017).\n\nOther feminist bioethicists have reflected on the more general\nclassification of non-standard embodiments as pathologies, and the\nquestions of autonomy and choice that such medicalization raises\n(Purdy 2001, 2006; Garry 2001; Zeiler & K\u00e4ll 2014). The\npathologization of the obese body and fat stigma have been extensively\ndiscussed (Reiheld 2015, 2020; Guidry-Grimes & Victor 2012;\nStrings 2015; MacKay 2017). There is also a growing body of work on\nrelated issues concerning transgendered (Draper & Evans 2006;\nNelson 2016) and intersex embodiment (Holmes 2008; Feder 2014); see\nalso below.\n5.4 Mental health and illness\n\nGiven that women who voice unorthodox opinions have frequently been\ncalled \u201cmad\u201d, it is not surprising that feminist bioethics\nhas also given considerable attention to women\u2019s experiences of\nmental illness and psychiatry (Martin 2001; Chesler 1972 [2005]).\nFeminist analyses have examined the way that gender stereotypes of\nwomen as hysterical or overemotional contribute to the women\u2019s\nown accounts of symptoms, distress, or unusual perceptions being\ndismissed (Potter 2019). These examples are more complex than they\nappear. There is compelling evidence that gender stereotyping\ncontributes to women being disproportionately diagnosed with mental\ndisorders such as depression, but it is also true that the oppression\nexperienced by women (and other marginalized groups) can in fact\ngenerate higher levels of mental distress (Stoppard 2000; Bluhm 2011;\nNicki 2016; Shaw & Proctor 2005; Ussher 2018; McDonald 2018). The\noperations of epistemic and institutional power help to explain how\nsexist bias can lead to women\u2019s accounts of their experience,\nincluding mental states, being either dismissed as trivial or\npathologized as symptoms of mental illness (see Martin 2001; Hansen et\nal. 2011; also Harbin 2022). The impact of such epistemic injustice on\nwomen in mental health and psychiatric contexts can be severe (e.g.,\nBueter 2019; Crichton et al. 2017), in the extreme leading to\ninvoluntary psychiatric treatment (Tseris et al. 2022).\n6. Continuing Evolution\n\nAs new themes in bioethics arise, feminist bioethics continues to\noffer distinctive approaches and insights, by responding to technical\ndevelopments, expanding into topics traditionally excluded from\nmainstream bioethics, and incorporating conceptual work originating\nelsewhere in feminist thought.\n6.1 Responding to new biomedical technologies and practices\n\nA recent development in reproductive medicine is mitochondrial\nreplacement, the replacing of \u201cfaulty\u201d with\n\u201chealthy\u201d mitochondria (the subcellular structures\nresponsible for energy production) to prevent the transmission of\ngenetic disease. Alongside the issues raised by mainstream ethical\nanalysis, feminist bioethicists have noted the potential exploitation\nof women as providers of eggs (and therefore mitochondria) for\nresearch and treatment, just as they have for the global economy of\nother reproductive tissues (Baylis 2013; Dickenson 2013). Similar\nconcerns are raised about the fact that research into emerging\nreproductive technologies, such as genome editing and epigenetics, and\nany treatments to which such research ultimately leads, have a much\ngreater impact on women than on men (Scott 2022). The development of\nuterus transplants for infertility raises important moral questions\nabout the safety and efficacy of an experimental technique that\naffects only women (Flynn & Ramji 2019; Lotz 2021). Meanwhile,\nauthors such as Ruby Catsanos and colleagues (2013) highlight the\noften neglected point that the development of uterus transplantation,\nas of many other reproductive technologies, inevitably uses\nwomen\u2019s bodies as means to the end of perfecting the\nprocedure.\n\nA growing number of bioethicists are now publishing on what are\nbroadly referred to as data ethics, digital ethics, or AI ethics. All\nareas of healthcare are rapidly adopting a variety of technologies\nthat make use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),\nand/or some form of automated decision-making. The technologies are\npromoted on the basis that they are faster, more accurate, and bring\ngreater consistency and objectivity to medical practices and services,\nas well as possibly offering more cost-effective ways to provide these\nservices to remote or under-resourced areas, thereby increasing global\nequality. AI applications in healthcare include those that\nspecifically target women\u2019s health, such as AI systems that\nanalyze radiological imagery in diagnosing breast and cervical cancer\nor predict disease progression from clinical data. Meanwhile a growing\nmarket of direct to consumer AI-based products and apps claim to\nempower users, such as pregnant women, through the provision of health\ninformation (Gross et al. 2021; Paton 2022). These claims have been\nchallenged by some feminist bioethicists who see instead just another\ninstance of the control and surveillance of women\u2019s bodies.\n\nFurthermore there are serious concerns about the overhyping of AI on\nthe basis of poor quality data, shaky evidence, and oversimplification\nof the real-life settings in which AI-powered devices will be applied\n(Wang et al. 2019; Carter et al. 2020). More specifically of interest\nto a feminist critique, against the claims that computer-driven\nprocesses are better and fairer because they are\n\u201cuncontaminated\u201d by human fallibilities, it is becoming\nclear that AI has a tendency to build existing injustices into novel\ndigital systems (D\u2019Ignazio & Klein 2020; Wellner &\nRothman 2020). This may be due to the biased nature of the data on\nwhich systems are trained. One obvious way in which this can happen is\nif AI healthcare technologies use data derived largely or exclusively\nfrom men (Larrazabal et al. 2020). Health data are heavily affected by\nlong-standing social, cultural, and institutional biases, which means\nthat algorithms based on these data will perpetuate or even exacerbate\nexisting gender and health disparities\u2014for example, the lack of\ndata on women\u2019s physiology inevitably means that AI-based\npredictions of pharmaceutical side effects are potentially very\ninaccurate. The problem may also lie with the algorithm itself (i.e.,\nthe data may be adequate but what the algorithm does with the data is\nnot), or more fundamentally, it might flow from the social or\npolitical assumptions around which the entire process has been\nconstructed, such as beliefs about the lifestyles and behavior of the\nwomen taking a particular medication (Ho 2022).\n\nFeminist critics have long pointed out that for any technology, the\nspecifically gendered distribution of practices and obligations can\nturn what appears to be superficially beneficial into something more\nambiguous. For example, the expansion of AI health monitoring in the\nhome has been presented as means of reducing the burden on caregivers\n(who are often women) and enhancing the autonomy of disabled or older\npeople. Nevertheless, the expectation that family members will adopt\nAI-supported care may simply set up new burdens of cost or complexity\nin the management of care, place emotional or other pressures on\nfamily members (for example, if employers expect their employees to\nput surveillance in place instead of offering flexible working hours),\nand disrupt familial care relationships (Entwistle et al. 2014; Ho\n2019).\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, creating a genuinely ethical AI requires\nthinking beyond the issues of a particular technological application\nor abstract notions of \u201calgorithmic fairness\u201d, in order to\ntake into account the context within which AI is being developed and\ndeployed in real-life healthcare. A global contextualization should\nalso ensure that AI healthcare solutions do not draw data solely from,\nor use algorithms designed to focus on, the concerns of richer and\nmore powerful sectors of the community, neglecting the needs of poorer\nsectors and exacerbating health disparities.\n6.2 Expanding the limits of disciplinary interest\n\nA second evolutionary pathway has continued feminist bioethics\u2019\nhistory of pushing at the boundaries of what is considered\n\u201cproper\u201d bioethics. For example, since the early 2000s,\npublic health ethics have become a recognized part of mainstream\nbioethics, yet many of the concerns of public health ethics were\nanticipated by feminist health care movements at least a couple of\ndecades earlier. Feminist approaches are centrally concerned with\njustice and equality, and the role of power relations\u2014primarily,\nbut not solely, gendered power relations\u2014in the generation of\ninequity. In the context of public health, feminist analyses are\nattentive to the connections between gender, health, and population\nhealth inequities overall, but also look at how the social and\npolitical distortions of power affect all the processes of public\nhealth (Rogers 2006: 351), from policy making through to program\ndelivery (Baylis, Kenny, & Sherwin 2008).\n\nIn addition, a growing number of feminist bioethicists are moving\ntowards topics that have not been associated conventionally with\nbiomedicine but that nevertheless have powerful indirect effects on\nhuman health. Some authors have developed a specifically feminist\nbioethics of food consumption and production (Rawlinson & Ward\n2016; Rawlinson 2019) in relation to ideas about vulnerability,\necological dependence, and global justice (Gilson 2015; Reiheld 2016),\nand have analyzed changes in agricultural and food production\npractices through the lens of power and gender dynamics (Di Chiro\n2017; Gilson & Kenehan 2019; Littig 2017; Wichterich 2015).\n\nSome recent feminist work has taken these concerns beyond an\nexclusively human focus. It understands \u201cbio\u201d to encompass\nall aspects of the living world, in line with a longstanding\necofeminist view that environmental damage reflects patriarchy and\nmale domination (Agarwal 1992; Plumwood 1993; see Elmhirst 2018 for a\nrecent overview of the field). There is a growing emphasis on the\nconsequences of environmental damage and climate change for humans and\nthe biosphere overall (Dwyer 2013; Whyte & Cuomo 2016; Zoloth\n2017; Buckingham & Le Masson 2017; Bee & Park 2022). Some of\nthese areas have benefited from strong cross-fertilization between\nfeminist bioethics and feminist science and technology studies (STS),\nwith scholars working productively around the borders between the\ntwo.\n6.3 Incorporating theoretical developments\n\nFeminist bioethics continues to change under the influence of ongoing\nconceptual work in feminist and mainstream philosophy. One notable\ndevelopment over the last quarter century is the rise of\nintersectionality. First formally articulated by Kimberl\u00e9\nCrenshaw in 1989, intersectionality suggests that when identities or\nsocial groupings intersect, they do so in ways that generate novel\nexperiences that are not reducible to the sum of individual categories\n(Crenshaw 1989; Hill Collins & Bilge 2016). A disabled woman, for\nexample, will face some unique barriers to adequate healthcare that\nwould not be encountered by either a disabled man or a non-disabled\nwoman; these would be barriers that do not track neatly according to\nsex and disability, but reflect the interaction of both. For any\ntheorists of justice and equality, including bioethicists, the\nintersectionalities of sex, gender, race, class, sexual orientation,\nand so on, should be illuminating. Although not yet widely\ndisseminated throughout mainstream bioethics, intersectionality has\nbeen taken up with enthusiasm by feminist bioethics for its ability to\ngenerate powerful analyses of the ways in which social\nidentities\u2014the particularities of who one is and how one is\npositioned in society\u2014affect health and healthcare.\n\nFeminist bioethics is also responding to developments in the\nconceptualization of sex and gender. Thinking about the meaning of\nbeing a woman has always been of interest to feminism, for obvious\nreasons, but this engagement has been given new life by contemporary\nactivity in the areas of gender identification and reassignment. Given\nthe role that biomedicine and the pharmaceutical industry continue to\nplay here, it is unsurprising that bioethicists are exploring the\ncontroversies around clinical interventions in the management of\nintersex persons and in gender reassignment, for example. Feminist\nbioethicists have described the barriers to effective healthcare\nencountered by both transwomen and transmen, including practical\nissues such as lack of privacy in healthcare settings, as well as lack\nof knowledge and discriminatory attitudes on the part of healthcare\nproviders (Harbin et al. 2012; Freeman 2018; Drouillard 2021).\nIntersex individuals encounter related issues (Feder 2014). The social\nand biological nature of women\u2019s identity is currently a highly\nfraught area of feminist theory and activism, with some concerned to\nensure that any framework of rights that takes account of gender\nself-definition and reassignment continues to protect the rights and\nneeds of cis or natal women (Nelson 2016).\n\nFeminist bioethics has always had an international feel to it,\nreflecting not just the commonality of women\u2019s shared experience\nbut also an awareness of the global economic and political systems\nthat generate locally specific instances of injustice to women and\nother marginalized groups. In this vein, feminist bioethicists have\nconsidered the health needs of people living in economically\ndisadvantaged areas, the skewed distribution of health research and\ncare resources across societies and the world, and the global\ndominance of western, highly technologized medicine that often diverts\nresources from more basic healthcare services. Other authors examine\nthe impact on women of international health policy, including formal\ninstruments such as the UNESCO Declaration on Universal Norms on\nBioethics (Rawlinson & Donchin 2005).\n\nHowever, during the final decade of the twentieth century it became\nclear throughout the women\u2019s movement that the sense of global\ncommonality through shared experience might be thinner than it seemed.\nBlack women and women of color, Indigenous women, and others protested\nthe exclusion of their own histories and perspectives from feminist\nthinking and activism \u2013 including feminist bioethics (Mohanty 2003).\nMost recently, bioethicists have responded to calls for the\ndecolonization of bioethical research and teaching (Obasogie &\nDarnovsky 2018; Richardson 2019; Shahvisi 2019). Decolonization\ndescribes the awareness that the past 500 or so years of human history\nhave been shaped by colonial power and that coloniality continues to\nstructure our systems of knowledge to this day. Arianne Shahvisi\ndescribes decolonization as\n\n\nthe systematic uncovering, announcing and destabilizing of coloniality\nin the topics of study, methodologies, training and culture \u2026.\n(Shahvisi 2022, 351).\n\n\nShe argues that as a normative discipline, feminist bioethics has a\nparticular obligation not just to note and examine the gendered,\nracialized, and geographical patterns of suffering that result from\ncoloniality, but also to end them (Shahvisi 2022). Feminist approaches\nthat take into account the particularity of women\u2019s experience\nand that are sensitive to the effects of local and global power\ndynamics are therefore well-placed to lead bioethics beyond treating\nthe concerns of the global South as a set of distant issues (Diniz\n& V\u00e9lez 2001; De Castro 2001; Khader 2013; Ganguli-Mitra\n2021). While decolonization generates deep tensions within the academy\nas a whole, the willingness to face the theoretical, professional, and\npolitical tensions that result is part of the critical and avowedly\nself-critical nature of feminist bioethics.\n7. The Future of Feminist Bioethics\n\nFeminist bioethics arose originally out of women\u2019s responses to\nthe inadequacies of mainstream bioethics, one of which was perceived\nto be its lack of radical edge, or perhaps better, its political\ntimidity. Like any movement with progressive goals, feminist bioethics\nin some sense aims to put itself out of business: it wants to see the\ncriticisms it presents to the mainstream acknowledged and the defects\nremedied. Feminist approaches work to transform the bioethical labor\ngoing on at the heart of the discipline, and indeed many of its\ninsights have been absorbed into the mainstream. Examples include the\nso-called empirical turn in bioethics and a recognition of structural\ninequities in healthcare. But this kind of success is always\ndouble-edged, and many feminist bioethicists will have felt irritation\nat the amnesia (or willful ignorance) of mainstream bioethics about\nthe source of these vital insights. More seriously, there is a danger\nthat the power and perceptiveness of feminist critique will dissipate\nas (or if) it loses its outsider status.\n\nNevertheless, while the incorporation of feminist ideas may have\nsmudged the line between mainstream and feminist bioethics, any\nassimilation of feminist ideas into mainstream bioethics is restricted\nto its theoretical and methodological approaches and largely excludes\nthe specific goals of fostering gender and social justice. Beyond the\nacademy, recent social and political developments, ranging from the\nerosion of reproductive autonomy in the overturning of Roe v.\nWade in June 2022, to the gendered impact of the global COVID-19\npandemic, have been salutary lessons in the precarity of feminist\ngains in the wider world.\n\nFeminist bioethics continues to develop in response to medical and\nlife science research on the one hand, and developments in philosophy\nand social theory on the other. It also reflects the establishment of\nnew fields of inquiry, such as AI ethics, and the disruption of old\ndisciplinary boundaries. In this respect it is not so different from\nmainstream bioethics overall. What makes it distinctively feminist is\nthe underlying commitment to the political goal of identifying\npractices that harm and disadvantage women, grounded in the conviction\nthat this will produce a better and fairer world not just for women,\nbut for everyone.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Agarwal, Bina, 1992, \u201cThe Gender and Environment Debate:\nLessons from India\u201d, <em>Feminist Studies</em>, 18(1):\n119\u2013158. doi:10.2307/3178217", "Baier, Annette, 1985, <em>Postures of the Mind: Essays on Mind and\nMorals</em>, Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.", "Ballantyne, Angela, 2014, \u201cExploitation in Cross-Border\nReproductive Care\u201d, <em>IJFAB: International Journal of Feminist\nApproaches to Bioethics</em>, 7(2): 75\u201399.\ndoi:10.3138/ijfab.7.2.0075", "Baylis, Fran\u00e7oise, 2013, \u201cThe Ethics of Creating\nChildren with Three Genetic Parents\u201d, <em>Reproductive\nBioMedicine Online</em>, 26(6): 531\u2013534.\ndoi:10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.03.006", "Baylis, Fran\u00e7oise and Angela Ballantyne (eds.), 2016,\n<em>Clinical Research Involving Pregnant Women</em>, (Research Ethics\nForum 3), Cham: Springer International Publishing.\ndoi:10.1007/978-3-319-26512-4", "Baylis, Fran\u00e7oise and Scott A Halperin, 2012,\n\u201cResearch Involving Pregnant Women: Trials and\nTribulations\u201d, <em>Clinical Investigation</em>, 2(2):\n139\u2013146. doi:10.4155/cli.11.178", "Baylis, Fran\u00e7oise, Nuala P.
