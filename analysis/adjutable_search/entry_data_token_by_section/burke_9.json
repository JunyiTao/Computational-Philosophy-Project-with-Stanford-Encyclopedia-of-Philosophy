Problems of Interpretation\n\n\nIt is clear by now that neither \u2018mystic spirit\u2019 nor\n\u2018irrationalism\u2019 characterise Burke helpfully. These\nexamples might be taken as extreme. At the same time they witness\ninterpretative difficulties. Whilst Burke\u2019s thought has never lacked\ninterpreters from his own day to ours, on the whole they have not\nbrought to bear the combined persistence of historical insight and\nstrength of conceptual grasp required to do justice to him. Hence he\nhas suffered an ironic fate for one who urged breadth and precision of\nthought. That is to say, he has figured as the spokesman for a very\nlimited number of points or as one preoccupied with a limited number\nof themes. This type of treatment began in the nineteenth century,\nwhen Burke was invoked as an antidote to the confidence of the French\nRevolution by liberal thinkers who prized its principles, saw their\nnarrowness, and required a sense of historical development to situate\nthem properly in a viable civil society. It was continued when Matthew\nArnold tried to treat Burke as a (pre-Home Rule) Gladstonian spokesman\nabout Ireland. It went further still in the twentieth century, when\nBurke was pressed into service as a counter-revolutionary agent in the\nanti-Communist cause, and when the twenty-first dawned some were\ntreating Burke as proponent of postmodernism. He himself could hardly\nhave complained that his work has been put to practical use,\nbut it remains true that academic justice has yet to be done to\nhim. Chapters and essays on individual themes in his writings have\nbeen more plausible on the whole than attempts at general\ninterpretation, which usually concentrate on a theme or themes of\nchoice, or subordinate Burke\u2019s thought to it or them, and so give the\nimpression (deliberately or otherwise) that this is the whole of\nBurke, or at any rate that this is what matters about him. One\nresponse to this situation is to concentrate primarily on telling the\nstory, and it is interesting that a number of recent works have taken\nthis path.\n\n\nIn attacking the Revolution in France, Burke constructed a rogues\u2019\ngallery for French politicians, and stocked it also with quite a\nnumber of French thinkers. The figures who appeared to be rogues,\nhowever, were most of them only straw men, stuffed according to the\nprejudices of a British audience. More significantly for our purposes,\nBurke\u2019s censure of the philosophes attributed to them\ncomplicity with the style of thought that had set up a limited range\nof simple principles as the norm for politics, and which was wholly\ninadequate to satisfy the connected and various needs of human nature\nunder modern conditions. Burke preferred to emphasize that numerous\nprinciples, and practical thinking to combine them, were necessary to\nmeet these needs, and so to sustain improvement, and emphasize, too,\nthat such accommodation involved much more practical activity than\nspeculative design. Correspondingly his own writings develop, not a\npolitical philosophy but rather a political style that had at its core\nphilosophical elements\u2014a style which, indeed, implicitly\nsuggested that political philosophy was not feasible as a\nsort of knowledge, and, if it was, certainly not one sufficient to the\ntask of \u2018the philosopher in action\u2019. The latter, at least as embodied\nby Burke himself, when he mentioned political philosophy, assumed that\nit was highly practical. It for its goal regulating opinion in order\nto produce good political results and to prevent bad ones. \u201cIt\nhas ever been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal\nphilosophy to regulate opinion\u201d, he wrote. \u201cIt is the\ngreat object of political philosophy to promote that which is sound,\nand to extirpate what is mischievous, and which directly tends to\nrender men bad citizens in the community, and mischievous neighbours\nout of it\u201d (RP2, W & S ix.295).\n\n\nSuch a style of thought emphasises the importance of combining a wide range of\nprinciples, and of remembering that principles, however numerous, are only\none element in a satisfactory conduct of practice. There can be no\ndoubt that analysis was involved in Burke\u2019s proceedings: \u201clet\nthis position be analysed,\u201d he instructed the House of Commons\ncritically in 1794, \u201cfor analysis is the deadly enemy of all\ndeclamation.\u201d [10]\n Though Burke could certainly conduct effective analyses of ideas and\nwords even after more than twenty years at Westminster, as his\nLetter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792) demonstrates, his\naccent lay more decidedly upon the necessity of connecting ideas with\neach other, and the inclusion of non-conceptual elements in any\ntreatment of politics that aspired to intellectual and practical\nvalidity. There is nothing in a style of doing philosophy that centres\nupon analysis that is logically inconsistent with these\nprocedures. One temper of mind, however, which sometimes accompanies\nthis manner of philosophising is antipathetic to Burke, whilst there\nis much in contemporary opinions about politics, including those held\nby at least some analytical philosophers, that he would have found\ndangerously naive. Amongst these a belief in a continuing popular\nsovereignty (the modern term of art for this is\n\u2018democracy\u2019)\u2014rather than parliamentary sovereignty\nis only the most obvious example. If Burke is unlikely at present to\nbe the darling of some philosophers and of some pundits; still less\nwill he be of those who suppose that in discussing a small number of\nprinciples they provide a prescriptive and sufficient guidance for the\nconduct of policy; and even less of anyone who supposes it logically\nadequate to claim that \u2018one very simple principle\u2019 is\n\u2018entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control\u2019 or any other\nmatter (Mill 1859, \u2018Introductory\u2019). The complex character\nof ideas, their connexions with each other, the need to understand\npractice in terms of such relations, and to conduct it with attention\nto habitual linkages amongst people\u2019s ideas and activities, suggest a\ndifferent sort of thinking. So it is not surprising that Burke has\nbeen quietly ignored by many recent thinkers, or summarily dismissed\nfrom consideration by being labelled as a\n\u2018conservative\u2019\u2014but it is of great interest that he\nhas found many admirers amongst those who succeed in the conduct of\npractical politics. Whilst Burke would have been the first to point\nout that his specific conclusions belong to a time and a place, his\nintellectual style, is one with which any serious thinking about\npolitics, whether reflective or practical, needs to engage.\n",
