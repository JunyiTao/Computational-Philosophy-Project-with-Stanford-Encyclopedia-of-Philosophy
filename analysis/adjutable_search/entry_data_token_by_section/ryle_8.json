    "main_text": "Self-knowledge\n10. Self-knowledge\n\nThe editors of a contemporary volume on self-knowledge write:\n\nEach of us effortlessly knows an enormous amount about those of our\nattributes which go with our rationality, sentience, and affective\nsusceptibilities: our beliefs, hopes, desires, and fears, whether we\nhave a headache or an itchy toe, whether we are elated or depressed,\nwhom we love and hate, what attracts or repels us. (Wright, et. al.,\n1)\n\n\nWhereas knowledge of others\u2019 sensations, emotions, and\nintentional states demands reliance on independently articulatable\ngrounds, self-knowledge is, by contrast, characteristically immediate.\nThis immediacy is already enough to be philosophically perplexing, but\nnot only do we know differently from others what we think,\nhope, and feel, we are also, in normal circumstances, regarded as\nknowing best. Furthermore, if we do enjoy certain mental\nattributes, we are expected to know that we do: our mental states are\nsalient to us. According to the editors, \u201c[t]hese three features\nof the epistemology of self-knowledge\u2014immediacy,\nauthority, and salience\u2014combine to set a\ncertain explanatory problem \u2026\u201d.\n\nTo what extent does this explanatory puzzle arise because of a tacit\nallegiance to Cartesianism? We have already seen how the\nepistemological consequences of the Official Doctrine lead to the\nproblem of other minds. The other side of the Cartesian coin seems to\nput us in an especially privileged position with respect to our own\nminds. For, if ascribing mental predicates to others is problematic,\naccording to the Official Doctrine, ascribing them to ourselves is\nproblem-free. Immediacy, authority, and salience are features of the\nepistemology of self-knowledge that the Cartesian view is best-placed\nto accommodate.\n\nRyle would see this contemporary expression of the problem of\nself-knowledge as a result of the conflation of various suspect\nphilosophical tendencies. One of these has its roots in the\nepistemological strand of the Official Doctrine; another is the\ntendency of philosophers to underestimate the many-layered complexity\nof mental discourse. This includes the refusal to acknowledge that the\nsame sentence may have different elasticities or kinds of jobs, as\nwell as the tendency to favour sentence-jobs of informing, describing\nor reporting over those, for example, of explaining, exhorting,\nencouraging, or admonishing.\n\nFor if self-knowledge is to be construed as a sort of perception of\ninner states or events that are (by the special faculty of\nintrospection or by the \u201crefulgence\u201d of consciousness)\n\u201cvisible\u201d to me but not to others, then Cartesianism,\nthough seeming to leave knowledge of our own minds intact, instead\npresents an untenable picture of what this \u201cknowledge\u201d can\nbe. Sorting out this confusion puts what can genuinely be called\nself-knowledge on relative parity with other-knowledge. It will also\nleave room for the importance of \u201cunstudied talk\u201d,\n\u201cego-pronouncements\u201d, or \u201cavowals\u201d, which do\nenjoy protection from epistemic criticism. But once the nature of this\nprotection is understood, philosophical perplexity should be\nextinguished, not kindled.\n\nRyle accepts the sort of privacy or secrecy that attends our dreams,\nimaginings and silent soliloquies and he concedes that besides the\ndispositional one there is another sense of \u2018know\u2019 which\nhas to do with what a person is presently thinking, feeling or doing.\nHe does not deny the existence of mental processes of this kind\n(again, a reason to resist calling him a \u2018behaviourist\u2019);\nnor does he deny that I am the only one in a position to say what, for\nexample, my musings, ponderings, or dreams are about. Nor does Ryle\ndeny that usually when we witness something, or feel something, or act\nin such-and-such a way we are able, when asked, to give a correct\naccount of it. He denies, rather, that either the\n\u201cluminous\u201d or \u201crefulgent\u201d view of\nconsciousness or one that buys into the intellectualist legend is\nrequired to accommodate this ability. He acknowledges that the concept\nof visualizing, imagining, or \u201cseeing\u201d in the mind\u2019s\neye, and \u201chearing\u201d in the mind\u2019s ear are useful\nconcepts. He denies that these uses commit us to the existence of\npictures or images that we contemplate or tunes that we hear: rather\nthan construe someone who pictures his nursery as the spectator of a\nresemblance of his nursery, he should be construed as resembling a\nspectator in his nursery (1949a, 234).\n\nRyle\u2019s discussion of avowals introduces, in effect, a different\nelasticity in our use of \u2018know\u2019, when we say, for example,\nthat usually a person knows what she is on about. This has to do with\nher propensity to avow moods, feelings, inclinations, intentions,\ndesires, and so forth. One striking feature of avowals is that they\nseem to enjoy a special kind of security from epistemic assessment or\ncriticism. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d or \u201cI think you must\nbe mistaken\u201d or \u201cYou have been careless in your\nobservations\u201d do not make sense as rejoinders to avowals. For\nRyle,\n\n[i]f the avowal [\u201cI feel depressed\u201d] is to do its job, it\nmust be said in a depressed tone of voice; it must be blurted out to a\nsympathizer, not reported to an investigator. Avowing \u201cI feel\ndepressed\u201d is doing one of the things, namely one of the\nconversational things, that depression is the mood to do. It is not a\npiece of scientific premises-finding, but a piece of conversational\nmoping. (1949a, 99)\n\n\nRyle warns against construing the fact that avowals are unassailable\nas indicating that there is special kind of knowledge in play. From\nthe fact that these utterances are protected from epistemic assessment\nor criticism it does not follow that we have a special kind of\nknowledge about them; any more, says Ryle, than it follows from the\nfact that someone is not a quack doctor that he is a good doctor: for\nhe may not be a doctor at all (1993b, 216). For with the idea of\nknowledge comes the idea of truth, of justification, of\nrepresentation, of description, of taking closer looks, etc.\n\nThe standards for assessing \u201cego-pronouncements\u201d run along\nlines of sincerity/insincerity where these in turn are cashed out in\nterms of lying, feigning (for fun), acting (in a play), putting on\n(for sympathy), etc. When lying, feigning, etc., are ruled out, then\nsomeone\u2019s saying so may be on some particular occasion what\njustifies us in accepting or what gives us a reason to accept what he\nsays. The question of his being wrong (as measured against some\nadditional standard) may not arise. If he is not wrong in saying that\nhe is in pain (because he can only be lying or insincere in the ways\nthat we are imagining have been ruled out) it does not follow that he\nhas a special kind of knowledge. Rather, it would be more appropriate\nto say that questions of knowledge are here out of place. The\ndiscussion of avowals, then, illustrates yet another elasticity or\nsentence-job for certain mental expressions. None of this is to deny\nthat \u201cI am in pain\u201d, for example, may have a use which, on\nsome occasion, counts as a description. Indeed, it may be both a\ndescription and a complaint (1993a, 214).\n\nMany contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and\nself-knowledge, accepting a modern variant of the assumptions of\nCartesianism, are committed to the view that in using mental\npredicates, we (or the subject) attribute(s) to the subject a mental\nstate or condition of which her subsequent behaviour is a causal,\ncontingent manifestation. But once the assumption is made that mental\nverbs function to pick out such underlying states or events, then\nseemingly incompatible demands are placed upon these states and the\ntraditional philosophical problem of self-knowledge is revealed.\nConstrued as speaking from and expressing an occurrent state the\nspeaker is authoritative; construed as speaking from or referring to a\ndispositional state she is not.\n\nIn Ryle\u2019s (and in Wittgenstein\u2019s) hands, pointing to the\nnon-descriptive, expressive, use of an utterance such as \u201cI\nintend to go to the store\u201d or \u201cI am bored\u201d is\nsupposed to put to rest the mystery of the avower\u2019s presumptive\nauthority; it is not supposed to invite the development of a\nphilosophical account to explain it. It constitutes a step not only in\nrebutting the Cartesian\u2019s accommodation of this authority, but\nalso in denying that there is only one use of the relevant\nexpression\u2014namely, to describe or designate a state, occurrence,\nor property\u2014in the first place.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when we consider perplexities about the\nSelf, such as when children ask \u201cWhere was I before I was\nborn?\u201d or (we might add) when many of us wonder \u201cWhere\nwill I be after I die?\u201d What, precisely, is the mysterious\nreferent of \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d, and\n\u201cmyself\u201d? Since the way out of this puzzle is not merely a\nrejection of the para-mechanical hypothesis, Ryle suggests a different\ndiagnosis:\n\nGratuitous mystification begins from the moment that we start to peer\naround for the beings named by our pronouns. \u2026 [however] the way in\nwhich the people mentioned are identified by pronouns is quite\ndifferent from the way in which they are identified by proper names.\n(1949, 179)\n\n\nLike the index finger used to point to an object, pronouns function as\n\u201cindex words\u201d. Indexicals such as \u201chere\u201d,\n\u201cnow\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d ,\u201cshe\u201d,\n\u201cI\u201d and \u2019\u201cmyself\u201d indicate the place,\ntime, or person referred to. \u201cI\u201d is not an extra name for\nan extra being any more than \u201cnow\u201d is a name for a special\ntime: \n\n\n\u2026 it indicates, when I say or write it, the same individual who can\nalso be addressed by the proper name \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d.\n\u201cI\u201d is not an alias for \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d; it\nindicates the person whom \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d names, when\nGilbert Ryle uses \u201cI\u201d. (1949, 180)\n\n\nFurthermore, the first personal pronoun has different elasticities of\nuse. Sometimes \u201cmyself\u201d, for example, can be replaced by\n\u201cmy body\u201d (or parts of my body), as in \u201cI am warming\nmyself (my hands) by the fire\u201d. In other contexts such pronouns\ncannot be so replaced. \n\n\nIt makes perfect sense to say that I caught myself just beginning to\ndream, but not that I caught my body beginning to dream, or that my\nbody caught me doing so \u2026. [1949, 181].\n\n\nThe puzzles are multiplied rather than solved when we talk of the Self\nas akin to a business\u2014with, for example, an executive branch\nand subordinate departments\u2014or a University\u2014with\nwarring or collaborative Faculties representing mental capacities.\n\u201cMyself\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, in the example above, are\nindex words or indexicals used in different senses or with different\nlogical ties, in different sorts of contexts.  \n\nThe construal of \u201cI\u201d as a name renders its supposed\nnominatum, the Self, and one\u2019s awareness of oneself, or\nself-consciousness, particularly elusive. For though we can catch hold\nof our streams of thoughts, and we can comment on this awareness, and\nperhaps even reflect upon our self-comment, and then regret having\nspent so much time in self-reflection, \u2026\u2014we can never capture\nthe last episode of self-awareness, until another one comes along\nwhich will, though capturing the last, will itself be elusive. \n\n\n\u2026 the more [one] puts one\u2019s finger on what the \u201cI\u201d\nstands for, the less does [one] succeed in doing so \u2026 Like the\nshadows of one\u2019s own head, it will not wait to be jumped on. And\nyet it is never very far ahead; indeed, sometimes it seems not to be\nahead of the pursuer at all. (1949, 178]) \n\n\nThe way out of the mystery is, again, to recognise that\n\u201cI\u201d does not name an elusive Self any more than\n\u201cnow\u201d names an elusive Present. Neither functions as\nnames. They indicate the person who utters it or the time it is\nuttered. \n\n\n\u2026 there is nothing mysterious or occult about the range of\nhigher-order acts and attitudes, which are apt to be inadequately\ncovered by the umbrella-title \u201cself-consciousness\u201d. They\nare the same in kind as the higher-order acts and attitudes exhibited\nin the dealings of people with one another. Indeed the former are only\na special application of the latter and are learned first from them.\nIf I perform the third order operation of commenting on a second order\nact of laughing at myself for a piece of manual awkwardness, I shall\nindeed use the first personal pronoun in two different ways \u2026. But so\nfar from this showing that there are two \u201cMes\u201d in my skin,\nnot to speak, yet , of the third on which is still commenting on them,\nit shows only that I am applying the public two-pronoun idiom in which\nwe talk of her laughing at him; and I am applying the method of\ninter-personal transaction which the idiom is ordinarily employed to\ndescribe.
