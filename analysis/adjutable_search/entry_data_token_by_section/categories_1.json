    "main_text": "Category Systems || Kantian Conceptualism\n1.2 Kantian Conceptualism\n\nOthers, however, have shied away from this robustly realist approach\nto categories, generally on grounds of skepticism about our ability to\ndiscern intrinsic divisions in \u2018reality itself\u2019, and have\ninstead treated the project of categories as a matter of laying out\nthe highest categories governing our conceptual scheme. This shift in\napproach to what Carr (1987, 6) calls \u201ccategorial\nconceptualism\u201d was made famous by Immanuel Kant. While Kant\nfamously denied that we have access to intrinsic divisions (if any) of\nthe thing in itself that lies behind appearances or phenomena, he held\nthat we can discover the essential categories that govern\nhuman understanding, which are the basis for any possible cognition of\nphenomena. Thus, as H. J. Paton puts it, for Kant \u201cWe can have\na priori knowledge by means of the categories, only if the\ncategories are due to the nature of the mind and are imposed by the\nmind on the objects which it knows\u201d (1936, 258).\n\nIn his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant arrives at his list of\ncategories by first enumerating the forms of possible\njudgment (A70/B95\u2013A93/B109). On this view, objective\nempirical judgments (i.e., empirical judgments which purport to refer\nto objects rather than merely subjective seemings or connections of\nsense impressions, and which purport to be universally valid for all\njudging subjects) are endowed with their objectivity and generality in\nvirtue of the a priori concepts embodied in the relevant forms of\njudgment. If we can identify all of the possible forms of objective\nempirical judgment, we can then hope to use them as the basis to\ndiscover all of the most general concepts or categories that are\nemployed in making such judgments, and thus that are employed in any\ncognition of objects (K\u00f6rner 1955, 48\u201349).\n\nThus in distinguishing his categories, Kant begins from Aristotelian\nlogic in outlining four respects in which one can classify any\njudgment: according to its quantity, quality, relation, or modality.\nIn each of these respects or \u2018moments\u2019 of judgment, there\nare three alternative classifications; thus, e.g., in respect of\nquantity, a judgment may be universal, particular, or singular; in\nrespect of its relation, a judgment may be categorical, hypothetical,\nor disjunctive, and so on. These Aristotelian ways of classifying\njudgments are the clue to discerning the twelve correlated concepts of\nthe understanding. So, e.g., from noting that all judgments are either\nuniversal (e.g., All swans are white), particular (e.g., Some swans\nare white) or singular (e.g., Cygmund is white), we can arrive at the\nthree corresponding categories of quantity: unity, plurality, and\ntotality. Via this route, Kant ultimately distinguishes twelve pure\nconcepts of the understanding (A80/B106), divided into four classes of\nthree:\n\nQuantity\n\n\nUnity\nPlurality\nTotality\n \nQuality\n\n\nReality\nNegation\nLimitation\n \nRelation\n\n\nInherence and Subsistence (substance and accident)\nCausality and Dependence (cause and effect)\nCommunity (reciprocity)\n \n\nModality\n\n\nPossibility\nExistence\nNecessity\n \n\n\nThe categories are presented as forming a single exhaustive list, with\nthe four classes of categories imposing four different forms of unity\non the object known (Paton 1936, 295\u20139). Thus, one may\nseparately inquire after an object\u2019s quantity, quality,\nrelation, and modality, receiving one of the three sub-answers in each\ncase on the way to a more complete characterization of the object.\n\nAlthough these are categories of the understanding, they nonetheless\nretain a certain sort of ontological import, as it is a\npriori that they apply universally to all objects of possible\ncognition (A79/B105). In this way, by delineating the concepts that\nare a priori necessary for the cognition of objects,\nwe can acquire knowledge of categories governing any possible\nobject of cognition, and so acquire a sort of descriptive set\nof ontological categories, though these must be understood explicitly\nas categories of objects of possible cognition, not of the\nthing in itself. Thus Kant was able to treat his system of concepts as\na system of categories in something like the Aristotelian sense,\n\u201cfor our primary purpose is the same as his [Aristotle\u2019s],\nalthough widely diverging from it in manner of execution\u201d\n(A80/B105). Nonetheless, it is clear that for Kant the categories find\ntheir original source in principles of human understanding, not in\nintrinsic divisions in mind-independent reality, and are discoverable\nby paying attention to possible forms of human judgment, not by study\nof the world itself, nor by study of our contingent manners of\nspeaking. An approach like Kant\u2019s has been defended more\nrecently by P. F. Strawson and others following him, who undertake the\nproject of \u201cdescriptive metaphysics\u201d, which is concerned\nwith describing \u201cthe most general features of our conceptual\nstructure\u201d (1959 [1963], xiii), thus providing more general and\ndurable results than we might expect analyses of language to give us.\n\n",
