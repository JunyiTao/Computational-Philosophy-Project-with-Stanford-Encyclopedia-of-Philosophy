    "main_text": "Social Construction\n2. Social Construction\n\nIn claiming that one is not born a woman, Beauvoir was not suggesting\nthat one is never born with female body parts; rather, her concern was\nthat possession of female (or male) body parts, in and of itself, does\nnot imply how one could or should be socially\n situated.[1]\n In spite of this, societies, for the most part, reserve for females\ncertain social roles, norms, and activities that disadvantage them in\nrelation to males, casting the differences as necessary because\nnatural (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: Ch.1). If it is recognized, as Beauvoir\nurged, that what women and men are is at least partly a social matter,\nthis opens up the possibility that gender roles could be and so should\nbe made more equitable through social change. To simplify discussion,\nwe will use the terms \u2018male\u2019/\u2018female\u2019 to mark\nthe currently familiar sex distinction drawn in terms of primary and\nsecondary sex characteristics, and\n\u2018man\u2019/\u2018woman\u2019 to mark the gender distinction,\nwhere gender is, according to the slogan, \u201cthe social meaning of\nsex\u201d.\n\nThis theme\u2014that social hierarchies are sustained through myths\nof their natural basis\u2014has prompted a tremendous amount of work\non the construction of gender in particular (Delphy 1984; Scott 1986;\nMacKinnon 1989; Butler 1990; Wittig 1992; Alcoff 2006; Warnke 2008;\nWitt 2011a,c; Haslanger 2012), but also on the construction of other\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d social categories such as race (Appiah 1996;\nZack 2002; Warnke 2008) and in a somewhat different way, sexuality\n(Butler 1990, 1993; Fausto-Sterling 2000). Research in history,\nanthropology, literature, and sociology has chronicled the various\nmechanisms by which gender (and other such categories) is enforced,\nand research in psychology and biology has further loosened the ties\nbetween body types and social roles. Having witnessed the power of\nnaturalizing \u201cmyths\u201d, feminists tend to be wary of any\nsuggestion that a category is \u201cnatural\u201d or that\nwhat\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d should dictate how we organize\nourselves socially. However, there are several different\nde-naturalizing projects that are often mistaken for each other that\nengage different sorts of metaphysical issues.\n",
