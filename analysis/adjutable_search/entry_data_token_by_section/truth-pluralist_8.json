    "main_text": "Objections to pluralism and responses || The criteria problem\n4.3 The criteria problem\n\n\nPluralists who invoke platitude-based strategies bear the burden of\narticulating inclusion and exclusion criteria for determining which\nexpressions do, or do not, count as members of the essential subset of\nplatitudes upon which this strategy is based (Wright, 2005). Candidates\ninclude: ordinariness, intuitiveness, uninformativeness, wide use or\ncitation, uncontroversiality, a prioricity, analyticity,\nindefeasibility, incontrovertibility, and sundry others. But none has\nproven to be uniquely adequate, and there is nothing close to a\nconsensus about which criteria to rely on.\n\n\nFor instance, consider the following two conceptions. One conception\ntakes platitudes about \\(x\\) to be expressions that must be\nendorsed on pain of being linguistically incompetent with the\napplication of the terms \\(t_1 , \\ldots ,t_n\\) used to talk about \\(x\\) (Nolan 2009).\nHowever, this conception does not readily allow for disagreement: prima\nfacie, it is not incoherent to think that two individuals, each of whom\nis competent with the application of\n\\(t_1 (x), \\ldots ,t_n (x)\\), may differ as to whether some \\(p\\)\nmust be endorsed or whether some expression is genuinely platitudinous.\nFor instance, consider the platitude in (17), which connects being\ntrue with corresponding with reality. Being linguistically competent\nwith terms for structural relations like correspondence does not force\nendorsement of claims that connect truth with correspondence; no one\nnot already in the grip of the correspondence theory would suppose that\nthey must endorse (17), and those who oppose it would certainly suppose\notherwise. Further inadequacies beleaguer this conception. It makes no\nprovision for degrees of either endorsement or linguistic incompetence.\nIt makes no distinction between theoretical and non-theoretical terms,\nmuch less restrict \\(t_1 (x), \\ldots ,t_n (x)\\) to non-theoretical terms. Nor does\nit require that platitudes themselves be true. On one hand, this\nconsequently leaves open the possibility that universally-endorsed but\nfalse or otherwise alethically defective expressions are included in\nthe platitude-based analysis of \u2018true\u2019. An old platitude\nabout whales, for example\u2014one which was universally endorsed on\npain of being linguistically incompetent\u2014prior to whales being\nclassified as cetaceans\u2014was that they are big fish. The worry,\nthen, is that the criteria may allow us to screen in certain\n\u2018fish stories\u2019 about truth. This would be a major problem\nfor advocates of Ramsification and other forms of implicit definition,\nsince those techniques work only on the presupposition that all input\nbeing Ramsified over or implicitly defined is itself true (Wright\n2010). On the other hand, making explicit that platitudes must also be\ntrue seems to entail that they are genuine \u2018truisms\u2019\n(Lynch 2005c), though discovering which ones are truly indefeasible is\na further difficulty\u2014one made more difficult by the possibility\nof error theories (e.g., Devlin 2003) suggesting that instances of the\n\\(T\\)-schema are universally false. Indeed, we are inclined to say\ninstances of disquotational, equivalence, and operator schemas are\nsurely candidates for being platitudinous if anything is; but to say\nthat they must be endorsed on pain of being linguistically incompetent\nis to rule out a priori error theories about instances of the\n\\(T\\)-schema.\n\n\nA second, closely related conception is that platitudes are\nexpressions, which\u2014in virtue of being banal, vacuous, elementary,\nor otherwise trivial\u2014are acceptable by anyone who understands\nthem (Horwich 1990). The interaction of banality or triviality with\nacceptance does rule out a wide variety of candidate expressions,\nhowever. For instance, claims that are acceptable by anyone who\nunderstands them may still be too substantive or informative to count\nas platitudinous, depending on what they countenance. Similarly, claims\nthat are too \u2018thin\u2019 or neutral to vindicate any particular\ntheory \\(T\\) may still be too substantive or informative to count\nas genuinely platitudinous on this conception (Wright 1999). This is\nparticularly so given that nothing about a conception of platitudes as\n\u2018pretheoretical claims\u2019 strictly entails that they reduce\nto mere banalities (Vision 2004). Nevertheless, criteria like banality\nor triviality plus acceptance might also screen in too few expressions\n(perhaps as few as one, such as a particular instance of the\n\\(T\\)-schema). Indeed, it is an open question whether any of the\nprinciples in (11)\u2013(28) would count as platitudes on this\nconception.\n\n\nAn alternative conception emphasizes that the criteria should\ninstead be the interaction of informality, truth, a prioricity, or\nperhaps even analyticity (Wright 2001: 759). In particular, platitudes\nneed not take the form of an identity claim, equational definition, or\na material biconditional. At the extreme, expressions can be as\ncolloquial as you please so long as they remain true a priori (or\nanalytically). These latter criteria are commonly appealed to, but are\nalso not without problems. Firstly, a common worry is whether there are\nany strictly analytic truths about truth, and, if there are, whether\nthey can perform any serious theoretical work. Secondly, these latter\ncriteria would exclude certain truths that are a posteriori but no less\nuseful to a platitude-based strategist.\n",
