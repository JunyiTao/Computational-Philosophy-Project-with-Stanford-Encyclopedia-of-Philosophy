Reichenbach\u2019s mature viewpoint, presented in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c) diminishes the status of\nthe given; knowledge, belief and conjecture is built around his\nconceptions of meaning, probability and convention. Coordination of\nlanguage and physical circumstances replaces his earlier coordination\nof Kantian concepts and sensation. Reichenbach is a realist about the\nexternal world, but asserts that we can only have uncertain knowledge\nabout it, inferred from sense data. Deliberation can reject the gifts\nof perception so involuntarily received. Claims about ordinary\nobjects, and scientific claims about other kinds of objects, whether\nsense data or atoms, are probabilistic in nature and related by\nprobabilities, not by any kind of logical reduction. Reichenbach was\nnot alone in this view at the time. In 1935, in the second issue of\nAnalysis, Hempel, writing in English because Carnap could not\nat the time, described Carnap\u2019s viewpoint in similar, if not\nquite identical, antifoundationalist terms. \n\nThe overall account seems to be something like the following: Language\nrequires a coordination of words\u2014or at least\nsentences\u2014with something signified. Scientific language,\nReichenbach claims, requires \u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d\nthat specify physical procedures for measurement. A common example is\nthe \u201cdefinition\u201d of the Paris meter bar as a unit of\ndistance. Definitions in the usual sense occur within a language, but\nReichenbach sometimes appears to intend something like an\n\u201costensive\u201d definition (he does not use the term). He\ngives no account of how such an act can suffice to specify a rule, and\nhe recognizes instances in which it does not, for example that a\ncoordination that measures time by the behavior of clocks does not\nsuffice to provide a rule for deciding relations of time measurements\nbetween distant clocks. Various coordinative definitions may thus\nleave measures of other quantities or relations indeterminate, and\nthese must be specified by some stipulation or other. His chief, but\nnot only, example is the definition of simultaneity (see also\nRynasiewicz (2003), and Dieks (2009) for a clear discussion). \n\nOnce specifications of all relevant quantities are made, empirical\nclaims are possible. There are, in Reichenbach\u2019s view, two\nrelated ambiguities. First, different stipulations about measurement\ncan lead to apparently different empirical generalizations that\nnevertheless are empirically indistinguishable\u2014although just\nwhat \u201cempirically indistinguishable\u201d can consistently mean\nfor Reichenbach is problematic for reasons to be noted. Second, the\nsame total theory may be partitioned in more than one way into claims\ntrue by stipulation and empirical claims. Reichenbach\u2019s solution\nto these forms of underdetermination is that \u201cequivalent\ntheories\u201d say the same thing. The equivalence relation he\nintends is unclear. In earlier writings he suggests that empirically\nequivalent theories are those that have the same empirically testable\nconsequences; a later formulation is that empirically equivalent\ntheories are those that have the same (posterior) probability on any\nobservations. The later characterization is as clear as\nReichenbach\u2019s characterization of the probability of theories\nand their confirmation (see below). The earlier characterization\nresults in a semantics for which no effective proof theory is possible\n(Glymour, 1970). \n\nOne puzzle about Reichenbach\u2019s view of conventions is why\ncharacterizing them remained important to him, since they are, in his\nmature view, only a feature of the reconstruction of a theory, not an\nintrinsic logical or semantical feature of any proposition. In\nprinciple, separating out different presentations of the same theory\nand recognizing equivalence amid diverse conventions might be of\nvalue, but except in cases such as simultaneity and gravitational\ntheories with extra \u201cabsolute forces,\u201d Reichenbach did not\nuse reconstruction to that effect, and the most important question of\nequivalence in the physics of his era, the relation of wave and matrix\nmechanics, was solved in a quite different way by John von Neumann\n(1932). Reichenbach\u2019s emphasis on locating conventions seems\ninstead to be negatively motivated, a continuing prophylactic against\nclaims that various principles are a priori. \n\nThe immediate description of the perceptual world is in terms of\nenduring objects, their properties and relationships, and that\ndescription is only probable. The world can be described\negocentrically in terms of \u201cimpressions\u201d and \u201csense\ndata,\u201d but, Reichenbach argues, ordinary descriptions of things\nare not equivalent to egocentric descriptions in terms of impressions,\nbecause, however elaborate, egocentric formulations do not entail\nobject claims, they only confer a probability on object descriptions,\n(and, of course, in parallel, given Reichenbach\u2019s\nanti-foundationalism, egocentric descriptions are only probable). The\nargument is not in accord with Reichenbach\u2019s own criterion for\nequivalent descriptions, but the conclusion is repeatedly emphasized.\nReichenbach insists, sometimes in rather sharp language, that the\nlogical positivists and unnamed \u201cpretentious\u201d logicians\nare simply wrong about locating the foundations of knowledge in sense\ndata or analytical truths. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s mature views on the notion of analytic truth were\ncomplex. He no longer held with C.I. Lewis that there is at any time\nany sort of Kantian a priori\u2014but there is synonymy, there are\nequivalent descriptions, and the assertion of equivalence between\nequivalent descriptions is presumably a purely logical matter, hence\nanalytic. Although explicitly addressed to Carnap, C. I. Lewis was\nquite possibly an equal target of Quine\u2019s \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (1951). (As Quine\u2019s senior at Harvard, Lewis\nwas unlikely to be criticized by name.) In a brief essay on\n\u201cLogical Positivism\u201d in 1945, Russell gently but pointedly\nridiculed Carnap\u2019s disposition to resolve every apparently\nirresolvable dispute by appeal to linguistic relativism.\nRussell\u2019s criticism, and Nelson Goodman\u2019s criticism of the\nvery idea of synonymy (Goodman, 1949), but perhaps not Quine\u2019s,\ncould have been applied to Reichenbach. \n\nAll empirical claims are, according to Reichenbach, probabilistic\njudgments based on relative frequencies in a reference class, or\nreached by induction. To the extent that reference classes rely on\nkinds, Reichenbach resorts to psychology: primarily, things are sorted\ninto kinds by the immediate perception of similarity, or by similarity\nin memory. Less primitively, theory and convention guide the\ndetermination of kinds. In practice he recommends the choice of the\nnarrowest reference class for which there are adequate statistics, a\nrecommendation that is of no help (why, or why not, should we throw\nvarious astrological theories into the reference class for assessing\nthe prior probability of general relativity?). \n\nPrimary or fundamental inductive inference consists of taking observed\nrelative frequencies as probabilities, that is, as limiting relative\nfrequencies. This procedure, referred to as the \u201cstraight\nrule\u201d, implies that one should take the current empirical\ndistribution to resemble the limiting distribution, and therefore\nbehave accordingly. The justification of such taking, or\n\u201cpositing\u201d in Reichenbach\u2019s terminology, is that if\nthere is a limiting relative frequency to a sequence, this procedure\nwill converge to it. Reichenbach notes in The Theory of\nProbability (1949f) that without further assumptions nothing can\nbe said about rates of convergence or about the warranted confidence\nthat an empirical distribution has converged. He further acknowledges\nthat any procedure that estimates the probability to be the relative\nfrequency, plus any quantity that keeps the estimate between 0 and 1\nand that itself converges to 0, will also converge to the limiting\nfrequency if such exists. He there (misleadingly) treats such\nalternative inductive rules as producing \u201cequivalent\ndescriptions\u201d to the straight rule and takes the choice as of no\nconsequence\u2014but of course the equivalence is only in the limit.\nIn Experience and Prediction (1938c) he instead dismisses\nsuch alternative rules on the vague grounds that they are\n\u201criskier\u201d than the straight rule. \n\nThe proposal of the straight rule goes back to the problem of\nassertability of probability claims he discussed in his thesis.\nReichenbach\u2019s proposal is reminiscent of the law of large\nnumbers, that the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent\nand identically distributed trials converges in probability to the\ntrue distribution. But the law of large numbers depends on\nindependent, identically distributed trials. Reichenbach cannot resort\nto such assumptions if he wants to avoid circularity in his account of\ninductive inference. Instead he introduces \u201cposits\u201d that\ncan basically be understood as leaps of (tentative) faith that the\nempirical distribution is representative. Posits can be\n\u201cblind\u201d or \u201cappraised.\u201d Posits are blind when\nthere is no data available to justify the posit. For example, if all\none has is a sequence of measurements for which the empirical\nfrequency distribution of events is given by F, then a blind\nposit might state that the probabilities specified by F are\nwithin \u03b5, for some small \u03b5, of the true distribution\nP. One has no reason to justify this claim, the posit is\nblind. However, if one had several sequences of measurements resulting\nin empirical frequency distributions F1,\u2026,\nFn, then the relative frequencies found\nin each of these empirical distributions can, according to\nReichenbach, be used to get higher order distributional information\nabout the original posit itself, and the posit therefore becomes\nappraised. So, if one has sequences of measurements of the\ngravitational constant from the Earth, the Moon, the 7 other planets,\nand, say, the Cavendish balance\u201410 sequences in total\u2014and\nin all cases except for Mercury, the gravitational constant is within\nsome small value \u03b5 of g, then the higher order\nprobability of the posit that the true value of the gravitational\nconstant is within \u03b5 of g is 9/10. How sure can one\nbe that the appraisal of the posit is accurate?\u2014For that\nReichenbach introduces again an even higher order blind posit. One\nthus arrives at a hierarchy of posits, of which the lower levels are\nappraised posits, and the highest levels are blind posits. Just how\nthe integration of different levels is supposed to occur, remains\nunclear and a point of criticism by Ernest Nagel (see below). The\ngeneral idea appears to be that at the \u201cdata\u201d level one\ncounts frequencies and integrates higher levels using Bayes rule. \n\nThe approach of estimating higher order distributional information on\nthe basis of subdividing the available sample is similar to the modern\nstatistical procedure of bootstrapping, although there re-sampling\ntechniques are used. Reichenbach argues that his procedure ensures\nmore efficient convergence than does na\u00efve application of the\nstraight rule alone. Faster convergence of the first level\nestimate\u2014the data-level\u2014is somehow supposed to result from\nsimultaneous convergence at all the different levels in this hierarchy\nof appraised posits\u2014Reichenbach refers to this as the method of\ncross-induction. But Creary (1969, Ch. 5) points out that there is no\nreading of such a conclusion about efficient convergence that follows\nfrom the premises Reichenbach assumes. \n\nOver time and place, the reasons Reichenbach gives for convergence of\nfrequency estimates to a limiting value vary, including 1) his early\nview that convergence is synthetic a priori, or that 2) the principle\nof induction expresses a kind of psychological habit, 3) the semantic\nargument we quoted above in Section 2.2 that the negation of the\nprinciple of induction is meaningless, 4) a pragmatic vindication that\ninduction using the straight rule works if any method of induction\nworks, 5) a convergence argument based on higher order probabilities,\nor 6) that there is no guarantee, merely \u201cposits.\u201d \n\nThe probability associated with any foundational claim must be\nunderstood as a blind posit, i.e. as a good guess, which according to\nReichenbach can take into account pragmatic considerations. Thus,\nReichenbach posits the existence of the external world as he thought\nit would make causal laws more \u201chomogenous\u201d (1938c). In a\nrather mixed metaphor, Reichenbach compares our knowledge of the\nexternal world to seeing shadows of flying birds on the walls of a\ncube in which one is confined. He argues that the patterns on the\nwalls, their regularity, would result in a high probability that there\nare objects outside the cube producing the shadows. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s eventual anti-foundationalism led him to a contest\nof opinions with C.I. Lewis, whose accounts of empirical learning and\nreasoning in Mind and the World Order (1929), and in An\nAnalysis of Knowledge and Valuation (1946) rested on a\nphenomenalist foundation of \u201cqualia\u201d (see the entry on\n qualia).\n Lewis, like Reichenbach a probabilist at heart, insisted that the\nassessment and revision of probabilities in the light of experience\nrequires that some propositions obtained from experience be certain,\nor as he put it, \u201cif anything is probable, something must be\ncertain.\u201d Reichenbach denied the claim, arguing that the\ndeliverances of experience directly provide, not certainty for claims\nabout qualia, but only probabilities for claims about ordinary things.\nThose probabilities can be revised in the light of further experience.\nFor the same reason, in his unremittingly critical review of Karl\nPopper\u2019s The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Popper\n1935), Reichenbach argues that probability assessments are essential\nin the \u201cfalsification\u201d of theories (1935e, 1978, vol. 2,\np. 372). Lewis\u2019 actual complaint appears to be based on a\nmathematical error when computing conditional probabilities.\nReichenbach pointed out Lewis\u2019 error, but did not provide a\npositive example to refute Lewis\u2019 concern (Peijnenburg &\nAtkinson, 2011). A more general problem that appears to have been\nmissed in the discussion at the time is that since Reichenbach held\nthat the probabilities of theories are to be assessed by Bayes rule,\nhis position, unlike Lewis\u2019, required a technical account of how\nclaims with non-extremal probabilities can produce changes in the\nprobabilities of others by some generalization of Bayes rule (see the\nentry on\n Bayes Theorem).\n Since on Reichenbach\u2019s view uncertainty is associated with\nobservation and perception and scientific theories are only confirmed\nwith a degree of probability, an account is required of how uncertain\ndata changes the probabilities of hypotheses logically remote from the\ndata. Much later, Richard Jeffrey (1983) provided an account of\nBayesian updating that explicitly relates the probability of the data\nto the probability of the hypothesis confirmed\u2014or\ndisconfirmed\u2014by the data (see the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n \n\nBayes rule and the probabilities of theories posed another problem\npressed on Reichenbach by Ernest Nagel in a review in Mind of\nthe German edition of Reichenbach\u2019s The Theory of\nProbability (Nagel, 1936; see also Nagel, 1938). Nagel\u2019s\ncourteous review found a series of difficulties with\nReichenbach\u2019s theory, beginning with the logical status of the\n\u201cprobability implication\u201d which Nagel thought was not,\ncontrary to Reichenbach, of the same kind as material implication,\nbecause Reichenbach\u2019s relation is not \u201cextensional.\u201d\nNagel does not explain what he means, and Reichenbach\u2019s extended\nresponse in 1939 does not clarify the matter (1939b, 1978, vol. 2, p.\n388). In his response to Popper (1935e), Reichenbach had proposed two\nways of evaluating theories, one of which is to count the relative\nfrequency of true statements among the consequences of a theory. Nagel\npoints out that a theory 10% of whose tested predictions are false\nwould scarcely have probability 0.9. Reichenbach does not attempt to\ndefend this proposal in his reply to Nagel in 1938 (Reichenbach,\n1938a). That leaves the assignment of probabilities to theories by\nBayes Rule, which Reichenbach had also proposed, but Nagel observes\nthat if theories are to be evaluated by Bayes rule they must have\nprior probabilities. How can there be a frequentist prior probability\nfor a theory, since we do not know to what reference class to assign a\nparticular theory and, whatever the reference class, according to\nReichenbach we do not and cannot know which theories in that class are\ntrue? As in several of his other responses to criticism,\nReichenbach\u2019s 1938 reply is unfortunately more defensive than\nenlightening. About the reference class, Reichenbach says only\n\u201cI do not think this is a serious difficulty as the same\nquestion occurs for the determination of the probability of single\nevents\u201d and recommends the choice of the narrowest reference\nclass for which there are adequate statistics (though how the adequacy\nof a statistic for the truth or falsity of theories is assessed is\nnever explained). Reichenbach gave a sketch of such a procedure in his\n1935 reply to Popper, which Nagel pointedly does not think addresses\nthe problems. About the problem of the frequency of true hypotheses in\nthe reference class, Reichenbach says that we only need the\nprobabilities of theories in the reference class, not their truth or\nfalsity\u2014a question-begging reply that Reichenbach must have\nsensed is unconvincing because he promises to address the issue\nfurther in Experience and Prediction (1938c). The discussion\nof the prior probabilities of theories in section 43 of Experience\nand Prediction is unsatisfactory for the same reasons. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s most enduring distinction is between \u201cthe\ncontext of discovery and the context of justification.\u201d But\nReichenbach did not always allow the distinction, and the distinction\nhe intended is not quite the one commonly attributed to him. In his\n1922 essay on \u201cThe Philosophical Significance of the Theory of\nRelativity\u201d (1922c) the (now conventional) distinction between\nthe context of discovery and the context of justification is\nformulated in other terms, and rejected:\n\nIt is important to follow the concepts by which the theory finds its\nway step by step and to level criticisms at the theory from the same\nintellectual path as was used in the creation of the theory. This work\nderives from such an attitude; indeed to renounce this method would\nachieve nothing but to promote traditional representations to a status\nof absolute predominance. (Reichenbach, 2006, p. 97.)\n\n\nIn his review (Reichenbach, 1935e) of Popper\u2019s The Logic of\nScientific Discovery, Reichenbach suggests that theories are\nordered by their prior probability, and the theory with the highest\nprior is further tested. In Experience and Prediction (1938c)\nand in his reply to Nagel (Reichenbach, 1938a), published in the same\nyear, Reichenbach first formulates the distinction between the context\nof discovery and the context of justification with regard to\nmathematics: the mathematical relations are what they are, and how we\ncome to recognize them is an entirely different, psychological\nmatter:\n\nThe objective relation from the given entities to the\nsolution, and the subjective way of finding it, are clearly\nseparated for problems of a deductive character; we must learn to make\nthe same distinction for the problem of the inductive relation from\nfacts to theories. (1938a, p. 36\u2013 37)\n\n\nIn other words, the distinction is supposed to be between objective\nrelations among premises and conclusions, and subjective ways of\ndiscovering those relations. The \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d is\nnot about search for hypotheses or about the order in which hypotheses\nare considered but about the search for the objective inductive\nrelation between a theory and a body of evidence. What little\nReichenbach had to say publicly about how to search for promising\nhypotheses was reported in his review of Popper\u2019s book, and in\nhis dismissal in his reply to Nagel of Peirce\u2019s\n\u201cabduction\u201d as a confusion of mathematical and\npsychological relations. While Carnap later imagined an inductive,\nlogically omniscient robot (Carnap, 1960), and Hempel much later (in\n\u201cThoughts on the Limitations of Discovery by Computer\u201d,\nHempel 1985) claimed that computerized generation of interesting\nscientific hypotheses is impossible, Reichenbach seems not to have\ngiven any thought to questions about how to come up with hypotheses\nand about better and worse ways to search through the space of\nlogically possible theories. He had one fundamental procedure for\nestimating true hypotheses: the straight rule, and one secondary\nprocedure, whose application he never coherently explained, Bayes rule\nwith objective, frequentist, prior probabilities for hypotheses. \n\nFurther Reading. Putnam (1991) provides a helpful big picture\nof Reichenbach\u2019s mature views on metaphysics and epistemology.\nChapter 7 of Milmed (1961) provides an overview of Reichenbach\u2019s\nprobabilistic epistemology and views on induction. Salmon, in various\npapers (see the entry on the\n problem of induction)\n tried in vain to save the straight rule, Reichenbach\u2019s\npragmatic vindication of induction (see also Hacking, 1968).

Chapter\n6 of Milmed (1961) provides one of the few good discussions of\nReichenbach\u2019s views on logic. An entire collection of articles\nin Schickore & Steinle (2006) explores the different\ninterpretations, historical connections and philosophical offspring of\nReichenbach\u2019s distinction of the context of discovery and the\ncontext of justification. \n",
