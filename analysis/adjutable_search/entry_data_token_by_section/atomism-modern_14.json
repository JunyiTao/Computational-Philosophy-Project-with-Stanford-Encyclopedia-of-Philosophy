    "main_text": "Atomism in Nineteenth-Century Physics || Thermodynamics as a Rival to Atomism\n5.4 Thermodynamics as a Rival to Atomism\n\n\nAs the considerations of the previous section indicate, there is no\ndoubt that those wishing to make a case for atoms were able to\nsteadily strengthen their case during the closing decades of the\nnineteenth century. However, it is important to put this in perspective\nby taking account of spectacular developments in thermodynamics which\nwere achieved independently of atomism, and which could be, and were,\nused to question atomism, branding it as unacceptably\nhypothetical.\n\n\nPhenomenological thermodynamics, based on the law of conservation of\nenergy and the law ruling out spontaneous decreases in entropy,\nsupported an experimental programme that could be pursued\nindependently of any assumptions about a micro-structure of matter\nunderlying properties that were experimentally measurable. The\nprogramme was developed with impressive success in the second half of\nthe nineteenth century. Especially relevant for the comparison with\natomism is the extension of thermodynamics, from the late 1870s, to\ninclude chemistry.  Two of the striking accomplishments of the\nprogramme were in areas that had proved a stumbling block for atomism,\nnamely, thermal dissociation and chemical affinity.\n\n\nGibbs (1876\u20138) developed a theory to account for what, from the point\nof view of the atomic theory, had been regarded as\n\u2018anomalous\u2019 vapour densities by regarding them as\nconsisting of a mixture of vapours of different chemical constitution\nin thermal equilibrium. The theory was able to predict relative\ndensities of the component vapours as a function of temperature in a\nway that was supported by experiment. It is true that atomists could\nnot only accommodate this result by interpreting it in atomic terms\nbut also welcomed it as a way of removing the problems the phenomena\nhad caused for the determination of molecular weights from vapour\ndensities. But it remains the fact that the thermodynamic predictions\nare independent of atomic considerations once it is recognised that\nthe chemical formulae needed for them can be, and were, obtained and\ninterpreted in a way independent of atomism. As a matter of historical\nfact, Deville, the major participant in the experimental confirmation,\nwas opposed to atomism, as Duhem (2002, 96\u20137) stressed.\n\n\nFrom the time Newton introduced the notion of forces of affinity\nacting between atoms and responsible for their chemical behaviour\nthere had been a problem forging a link between those forces and\nexperimentally measurable effects. Daltonian atomists simply assumed\nthat atoms combine in the way required to account for the measurable\nproportions of elements in compounds. The theory gave no account of\nthe relative strengths of chemical bonding or hints of what would\nreplace what in a chemical reaction. Chemical thermodynamics was able\nto make headway with this problem. Considerations based on entropy\nchanges and heats of reaction made it possible to predict in which\ndirection a particular chemical reaction will proceed and to provide\nan experimental measure of the affinities involved, where the\naffinities are not forces between atoms but provide a measure of the\nfacility with which one macroscopic chemical substance combines with\nanother. In the late nineteenth century leading scientists such as\nOstwald, Duhem and Planck were inclined to take thermodynamics as\nthe model of how science should proceed, maintaining a secure\nand productive relationship with experiment whilst avoiding hypotheses\nof the kind involved in atomism.\n\n\nThe factor that is usually considered as turning the tables decisively\nin favour of the atomists is Jean Perrin's experiments on Brownian\nmotion. Nye (1972, 145\u201352) has documented how Ostwald and\nothers conceded that the experiments settled the case in favour of\natoms.\n\nSuggested Readings: Clarke (1976) is a detailed investigation\nof the relationship between thermodynamics and the kinetic theory\nwhich contains good summaries of both theories.  Clarke's case that\nobjections to the kinetic theory were based largely on scientific\ngrounds is contested in Nyoff (1988) which contains a good treatment\nof the specific heats problem, and is further discussed in de Regt (1996).\n",
