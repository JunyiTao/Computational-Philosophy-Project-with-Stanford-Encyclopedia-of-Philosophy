    "main_text": "The Metasemantic Interpretation || 2D semantics for externalists\n3.1 2D semantics for externalists\n\nGeneralized 2D semantics seeks to vindicate a traditional internalist\nconception of meaning: it posits an extra aspect of meaning for all\nexpressions (the intension corresponding to the diagonal of a 2D\nmatrix) that is fully determined by a subject\u2019s internal states,\nand which in turn determines objective truth-conditions for their\nsentences. By enriching compositional semantics in this way, G2D\npromises a straightforward explanation of a variety of epistemic\nproperties of sentences: e.g., why a necessary sentence like\n\u2018Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 is not apriori knowable, what the\nsubject learns by accepting the sentence, or how the subject uses the\nsentence in reasoning.\n\nBut using the 2D framework to characterize the subject\u2019s\nepistemic perspective is not beholden to this internalist project.\nSemantic externalists reject the traditional view that our purely\ninternal states afford apriori access to reference-fixing conditions\nfor our words and thoughts. According to externalists, the basic\nassignments in a compositional semantics relate the subject\u2019s\nwords and thoughts to objective features of her\nenvironment\u2014objects, kinds and properties whose nature is\ncaptured by standard (1D) possible world semantics. Even externalists,\nhowever, can define 2D matrices that reflect the subject\u2019s\nepistemic perspective on the reference of her words and thoughts. For\nthe externalist, however, these 2D matrices will not represent\nmeanings\u2014a specific aspect of understanding that is\nrequired for linguistic or conceptual competence and which figures in\na compositional semantic theory that determines truth-conditions for\nsentences. On an externalist interpretation, 2D matrices merely\nreflect one aspect of a subject\u2019s partial semantic\nunderstanding of what her words and thoughts represent. Because\nexternalist 2D matrices don\u2019t represent meanings, moreover, the\nexternalist is free to use the 2D framework strategically to focus on\ndifferent aspects of the subject\u2019s understanding for different\nexplanatory purposes.\n\nRobert Stalnaker has articulated such an externalist interpretation of\nthe 2D framework in a series of influential papers spanning some\nthirty years. He was the first to introduce 2D matrices to specify\nwhat is communicated in situations where conversational partners are\npartly ignorant or mistaken about the nature of the objects, kinds or\nproperties their words pick out (1978), and he later extended his 2D\nframework to characterize the content of certain thoughts and attitude\nattributions (1981; 1987; 1988). In both cases, the 2D framework is\nused to define \u201cdiagonal\u201d intensions that reflect the\nsubject\u2019s partial understanding of which objects, kinds or\nproperties her words and thoughts represent. These diagonal intensions\nare not meanings or semantic values, since they do not figure in a\ncompositional semantic theory and they do not reflect conditions for\nconceptual or linguistic competence. The only meaning of an expression\non this account is its ordinary \u201chorizontal\u201d intension. In\neffect, Stalnaker\u2019s 2D matrices represent different meanings\nthat an expression could have had if it had occurred in\ndifferent empirical circumstances. This \u201cmetasemantic\u201d\ninterpretation of the 2D framework contrasts sharply the\n\u201csemantic\u201d interpretations favored by G2D theorists like\nJackson and Chalmers (Stalnaker 2001, 2004).\n\nProponents of G2D were influenced by Stalnaker\u2019s early papers\ndeveloping the 2D framework, and their views are often presented as\ncontinuous in motivation and form. But there are important theoretical\nconsequences that flow from the choice between 2D metasemantics and\ngeneralized 2D semantics. Indeed, Stalnaker himself is a vocal critic\nof generalized 2D semantics, rejecting its commitment to the semantic\nstatus of 2D matrices, its commitment to apriori conceptual analysis,\nand its internalist approach to reference determination.\n",
