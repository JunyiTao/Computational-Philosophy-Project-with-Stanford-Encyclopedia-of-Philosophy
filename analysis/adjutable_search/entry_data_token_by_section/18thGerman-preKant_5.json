    "main_text": "The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists || The Halle Pietists\n3.2 The Halle Pietists\n\nNext to Thomasius and Wolff, the most important intellectual figure in\nthe early history of the Friedrichs-Universit\u00e4t in Halle was\nAugust Hermann Francke (1663\u20131723). As we have seen, Francke had\ncourted controversy in Leipzig through his involvement in the Pietist\nmovement. Pietism was a spiritual movement within the Lutheran\ntradition that rejected the scholastic and theological turn that\nLutheranism had taken and proposed a further, internal reformation to\nsupplement the already-effected external one, and aimed at cultivating\na \u201cliving faith\u201d rather than mere lip-service to Christian\nideals. The Pietists sought the personal and interior experience of a\nrelationship to Christ, an individual transformation that was the\nresult of an act of divine grace modelled on Francke\u2019s own\nconversion experience (cf. Wallmann 1990: 63\u20134). To this end,\nthe Pietists focused on the study of the Bible itself and devotional\nliterature in small groups\u2014the so-called conventicles or\ncollegia pietatis\u2014which were notable, and\ncontroversial, for welcoming the involvement of women (R. Albrecht\n2004; Gierl 2015).\n\nAfter falling out (in spite of Thomasius\u2019 support) with the\nLutheran authorities in Leipzig, Francke followed Thomasius to Halle.\nHe took up a position as a pastor in the neighbouring town of Glaucha,\nand held lectures on oriental languages in 1692. Francke was himself a\ndisciple of the movement\u2019s intellectual founder, Philipp Jakob\nSpener (1635\u20131705), though Francke contributed immeasurably to\nthe spread of Pietism, primarily through his educational institutions\nin Halle, beginning with a school for poor children founded in 1695.\nThrough the institutions that arose from this humble school, Francke\nsought a reform of educational principles in line with Pietist ideals,\nand in this was enormously successful. The pedagogical institutions\nsupplied an influential model for similar institutions in and outside\nof Germany (especially due to the fact that it was a largely\nself-funded philanthropic institution), became the hub of an expansive\nmissionary network, and trained the next generation of German\ntheologians, as well as some philosophers (like A. G. Baumgarten), not\nto mention Prussian civil administrators, bureaucrats, and pastors.\nIndeed, Francke enjoyed a close relationship to the Prussian court,\nand king Friedrich I\u2019s successor, Friedrich Wilhelm I became an\nenthusiastic supporter of his projects after a visit to Halle (cf.\nHinrichs 1971).\n\nAnother significant member of the theology faculty in Halle was\nJoachim Lange (1670\u20131744). Lange had come under Francke\u2019s\ntutelage in Leipzig (where he also met Thomasius), following him to\nErfurt and (briefly) Halle, before taking up positions at various\nGymnasia in and around Berlin. During this time he also lectured on\nclassical languages and wrote a very successful Latin grammar. In\n1709, he accepted an appointment at the Friedrichs-Universit\u00e4t,\nin the theology faculty that was now thoroughly steeped in\nFrancke\u2019s Pietism. During his time in Berlin, Lange completed a\nnotable philosophical work, the Medicina mentis (Medicine\nof the Mind), printed in Halle in 1704. Lange\u2019s text shares\na title with Tschirnhaus\u2019 Medicina mentis of 1687, but\nlittle else as Lange instead emphasizes the futility and vanity of\nhuman attempts to attain cognition through their own efforts,\nhighlighting the mind\u2019s proneness to error and prejudice in its\nfallen state. Rather, according to Lange, it is only by means of\ndivine grace and the divine light that we can heal the corrupted\nintellect and the will (Sch\u00f6nfeld 2010).\n\nA final figure worthy of mention in this context, albeit not\nstrictly-speaking a Pietist thinker, is Johann Franz Budde\n(1667\u20131729). Budde had studied theology in Wittenberg, and after\nlecturing at Jena, had been called to an appointment in moral\nphilosophy at Halle in 1693, where he remained until returning to Jena\nin 1705 as a professor of theology. Budde adopted a conscientiously\neclectic philosophical outlook, one influenced by Thomasius, and which\nalso informed his theological commitments to Lutheranism (if not to\nPietism specifically). A prolific writer, he published a number of\nphilosophical works during his time in Halle, including the\nInstitutiones philosophiae eclecticae that appeared in two\nparts in 1703. The two parts are the \u201cElementa philosophiae\ntheoreticae\u201d, roughly a metaphysics, and the \u201cElementa\nphilosophiae instrumentalis\u201d, Budde\u2019s logic. A later work,\nentitled Theses theologicae de atheismo et superstitione\n(1717), is also notable in that Budde seeks to refute various threats\nto natural and revealed religion, including Spinozism (cf. Rumore\n2019: 44\u20138), an issue that would come to the fore in the coming\ncontroversy with Wolff.\n",
