    "main_text": "\n\nThrough our individual conscience, we become aware of our deeply held\nmoral principles, we are motivated to act upon them, and we assess our\ncharacter, our behavior and ultimately our self against those\nprinciples. Different philosophical, religious and common sense\napproaches to conscience have emphasized different aspects of this\nbroad characterization. The resulting more specific understandings of\nconscience will be presented in the sections below. On any of these\naccounts, conscience is defined by its inward looking and subjective\ncharacter, in the following sense: conscience is always knowledge of\nourselves, or awareness of moral principles we have committed to, or\nassessment of ourselves, or motivation to act that comes from within\nus (as opposed to external impositions). This inward looking and\nsubjective character of conscience is also reflected in the\netymological relation between the notion of \u201cconscience\u201d\nand that of consciousness. Only after the 17th\nCentury did \u201cconsciousness\u201d start to be used with a\ndistinct meaning referring to the psychological and phenomenal\ndimension of the mind, rather than to its moral dimension (for an\naccount of the terminological shift, see Jorgensen 2014).\n\nThe term \u201cconscience\u201d translates the Latin\n\u201cconscientia\u201d, which refers to sharing\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (scientia) \u201cwith\u201d\n(con-), and which in turns translates the equivalent Greek\nterm suneidenai (see Pierce 1955 and Sorabji 2014 for an\netymological analysis of the term). The literal meaning of the term\ndoes not specify the type of knowledge involved and whom that\nknowledge is shared with. However, the concept has traditionally been\nused to refer to moral knowledge (we talk indifferently of\nconscience and moral conscience) that is shared with oneself.\nThis reference to the self does not rule out that the source of the\nmorality in question be external to the self. For example, it might be\nGod, as in the Christian tradition, or the influence of one\u2019s\nculture or of one\u2019s upbringing, as in the Freudian theory of the\nSuper-Ego. Reference to the self indicates that, from a psychological\npoint of view, conscience involves introspection, awareness of\none\u2019s behavior, and self-assessment. As we shall see, although\nthese aspects often overlap, they are psychologically and conceptually\ndistinct functions.\n\n\u201cSharing moral knowledge with oneself\u201d might mean and\nimply different things. As for the object of knowledge, for example,\nit might refer to knowledge of one\u2019s own conduct in view of an\nassessment of it against a certain moral standard, or it might refer\nto knowledge of moral standards or principles themselves. As for the\n\u201cself\u201d with whom knowledge is shared, it might mean\nsharing knowledge with a part of the self, as if we were split into\ntwo persons (Sorabji 2014: 12), but it might also mean sharing\nknowledge with an imaginary witness, such as an ideal observer (for\ninstance a god, an imagined moral model, an impartial spectator).\nUnfortunately, debates in which appeals to conscience are often\nmade\u2014for example the debate about conscientious objection in\nhealth care\u2014are often characterized by a lack of clarity as to\nwhat it exactly is that we are talking about when we talk about\nconscience, and therefore about what exactly people are claiming when\nthey put forward a \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to, for\nexample, abortion. In what sense does abortion violate the conscience\nof a committed Catholic doctor? And is conscience amenable to reason\nand public discussion, or are appeals to conscience ultimately based\non intuitions and private morality? In what sense is a conscientious\nchoice different from a mere moral preference? The notion of\nconscience is in need of conceptual clarification.\n\nThis entry will expound the main features of the notion of conscience\nas it is used in philosophical discussion, religious teaching and in\ncommon language alike. The perspective adopted here will theoretical,\nrather than historical. The entry focuses on the Western tradition and\nsome examples are drawn from Christian source. The entry is structured\naround four possible, but not mutually exclusive, ways of\nconceptualizing conscience. These will be preceded by an introductory\nsection outlining the pluralistic, morally neutral and subjective\nnature of the concept of conscience. The four main aspects of\nconscience that will be described are the following. Section 2\ndiscusses conscience as a faculty for self-knowledge and\nself-assessment. Section 3 presents the epistemic aspect of conscience\nthat allows the formation of moral beliefs, distinguishing the\ndifferent possible sources of moral principles that inform such\nbeliefs. In section 4, conscience will be described as a motivational\nforce or as the source of our sense of duty, which already presupposes\na body of moral knowledge or of moral beliefs. Finally, section 5 will\nfocus on conscience understood as the body of personal core and\nself-identifying moral beliefs which is often taken to be the basis of\nmoral integrity (Fuss 1964; Wicclair 2011) and of our sense of\npersonal identity (Childress 1979). As discussed in section 6, this\nlast approach to conscience is often used with a political function to\nadvocate freedom of thought and action in liberal democratic\nsocieties, for example, as explained in subsection 6.1, through\nconscientious objection to practices that one would otherwise be\nprofessionally or legally expected to perform.\n",
