    "main_text": "The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon || Human Nature\n3.9 Human Nature]\n2.3 Augustine\n\nThe Periphyseon as a grand dialogue on physiology\n(physiologia is Eriugena\u2019s hybrid science of physics-theology-philosophy)\nstands in continuity with the exercitatio animi and the liberal arts tradition of\nAugustine\u2019s early philosophical dialogues. Eriugena appropriates\nand expands on Augustine\u2019s trust that reason (ratio)\ncan be trained by the liberal arts and can thus contemplate creation.\nAugustine\u2019s intellectualism is crucial for Eriugena\u2019s\nphilosophical anthropology although Eriugena seems to be much more\ntrusting than Augustine in the ability of the human to refashion\nitself through paideia.\n\nInformed by Dionysius notion of theophanic cosmic order, Eriugena is\nmore comfortable with the complexities of Neoplatonic cosmology and\nwith mediation (medietas) and less preoccupied with the issue\nof divine simplicity. Nevertheless, the Augustinian strain is not lost\nin Eriugena: both the human being and the creation have a Trinitarian\nstructure. Along with Basil the Great, it is Augustine (through his great commentary on Genesis, De Genesi ad litteram) who teaches Eriugena to read and interpret the Hexaemeron (the creation account in Genesis 1) in a more literal and realistic manner and thus to counter-balance the more allegorical reading of Gregory of Nyssa;  Augustine constitutes both a foil and a catalyst for\nEriugena\u2019s thinking; his great challenge in the\nPeriphyseon is trying to reconcile the Augustinian perspective with\nthat of the Eastern thinkers.\n\nAugustine\u2019s concept of the primordial causes (primordiales\ncausae ) along with Maximus\u2019 concept of logoi\nallow Eriugena to forge a realistic ontology based on intelligible\nspecies of visible things which are immanent in created beings (see\nErismann, 2011).\n2.4 Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil the Great\n\nEriugena cites almost 25% of Gregory of Nyssa\u2019s De\nImagine\u2014as he refers to the De hominis\nopificio\u2014in the Periphyseon. Gregory of Nyssa\u2019s and\nBasil the Great\u2019s accounts of creation provide the missing pieces, and\ncomplements the cosmology Eriugena derives from the partial Latin\ntranslation of the Timaeus. Basil\u2019s\nHomilies on the Hexaemeron provide him with a model for\nreading Genesis literally.\n\nGregory of Nyssa\u2019s imago dei anthropology provides the\nscaffolding for Maximus\u2019 understanding of the role and status of\nthe human being. Eriugena extrapolates from both Gregory of\nNazianzus\u2019 view that the essence of God is ineffable and\nultimately beyond definition and from Gregory of Nyssa\u2019s\napophatic anthropology; therefore, both the divine and the human are\nultimately unfathomable and ineffable: as the image of God (imago\ndei), the human being in its essence is as incomprehensible and\nundefinable as God.\n\nThe idea that the human being is uncircumscribed and indefinable is\nderived from Gregory of Nyssa, and Eriugena connects it with\nMaximus\u2019  officina omnium view of the human being and\nwith Augustine\u2019s Trinitarian theology.\n3. The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon\n\nEriugena\u2019s masterpiece is undoubtedly the Periphyseon\n(written c.862\u2013c.867), a long dialogue in five\nbooks\u2014between an anonymous \u201cteacher\u201d\n(Nutritor) and his \u201cstudent\u201d\n(Alumnus)\u2014that attempts to be a compendium of all\nknowledge presented within a Neoplatonic cosmology of the procession\nand return of all things from the divine One.\n\nThe Periphyseon, deeply influenced by Eriugena\u2019s\nengagement with Greek Christian authors, is a work of astonishing\nscope, a veritable Christian Neoplatonic summa. At the\nbeginning of Book Four, Eriugena labels his enterprise a\nphysiologia, a \u201cstudy of nature\u201d, and indeed one\nmanuscript of the Periphyseon in the British Library in\nLondon calls the whole dialogue \u201cLiber Phisiologiae Iohannis\nScottigenae\u201d. The term \u201cphysiologia\u201d\nis apt in that the term \u201cnature\u201d for Eriugena spans the\nwhole cosmological domain, including not just created nature but also\nthe Divine Creator, and treats of the essentially dialectical relation\nbetween Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation\nand creation culminates in return to the divine. Nature is to be\nunderstood as what is real in the widest sense, the totality of all\nthings that are and are not. Nature includes both God and creation and\nhas four divisions: nature which creates and is not created (God),\nnature which creates and is created (the Primordial Causes), nature\nwhich is created and does not create (the Created Temporal Effects),\nand nature which is neither created nor creates (Non-Being). The\noriginal intention (expressed at III.619d\u2013620b) was to devote\none book to each of the four divisions; thus Book One deals with the\ndivine nature and the procession or exitus of all things from\nGod, Book Two treats of the Primordial Causes, and Book Three of their\nCreated Effects, including the nature of ex nihilo creation\nand the stages of the creation of the world. The topic of creation\nrequires Eriugena to address issues related to the Biblical\naccount of creation, and thus, in Book Three, he embarks on his own\nversion of a Hexaemeron. The momentous event of the emergence\nof human nature on the Sixth Day of creation requires extended\ntreatment, and Eriugena is forced to devote a fourth book to this\ntopic, thus relegating the return of all things to God to a fifth\nbook. Thus, Eriugena was forced to depart from his original plan of\nfour books and add a fifth. This change of plan is particularly\nimportant in that it helps to identify different stages of composition\nof the text.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the Periphyseon is\nEriugena\u2019s ability to bring together into a symphony of ideas\nsuch a variety of thinkers and sources: the liberal arts and the philosophical dialogue traditions, the officina omnium anthropology of Maximus Confessor, the\ntheophanic ontology of Dionysius the Areopagite, Augustine\u2019s Trinitarian\ntheology, Basil the Great\u2019s realistic hermeneutics of the Hexaemeron, and Gregory\nof Nyssa\u2019s imago dei anthropology and his account of creation; however, we may say\nthat the grand tapestry of the Periphyseon is woven from many\nthreads but the fabric is Maximian. Maximus Confessor\u2019s vision\nprovides the impetus that drives the argument of the dialogue and also\nthe framework in which the encounter and conversation among the\nvarious sources takes place.\n3.1 The Four Divisions of Nature\n\nBook One opens abruptly with the claim that \u201cnature\u201d\n(natura), \u201cthe general term for all things that are and\nall things that are not\u201d, (I.441a), including both God and\ncreation, is divided into four species. Echoing similar divisions in\nAugustine (De civitate Dei Bk. V. 9, PL 41: 151) and Marius\nVictorinus (Ad Candidum), nature\u2019s four\n\u201cdivisions\u201d or \u201cspecies\u201d are: that which\ncreates and is not created (i.e., God); that which creates and is\ncreated (i.e., Primary Causes or Ideas); that which is created and\ndoes not create (i.e., Temporal Effects, created things); that which\nis neither created nor creates (i.e., non-being, nothingness). The\nfirst species of nature is God, \u201cthe cause of all things that\nare and that are not\u201d (I.442b). There are several remarkable\naspects of this division. First of all, division is defined by\nEriugena in De praedestinatione as a branch of dialectic.\nSecondly, the four divisions are not strictly a hierarchy in the usual\nNeoplatonic sense where there are higher and lower orders, rather, as\nEriugena will explain, the first and fourth divisions both refer to\nGod as the Beginning and End of all things, and the second and third\ndivisions may also be thought to express the unity of the cause-effect\nrelation. Finally, the division is an attempt to show that nature is a\ndialectical coming together of being and non-being. Creation is\nnormally understood as coming into being from non-being. God as\ncreator is then a kind of transcendent non-being above the being of\ncreation. These themes are rigorously discussed and disentangled\nthroughout the dialogue.\n3.2 The Five Modes of Being and Non-Being\n\nImmediately following on his abrupt announcement of the four divisions\nof nature, Eriugena proceeds to list \u201cfive ways of\ninterpreting\u201d (quinque modi interpretationis) the\nmanner in which things may be said to be or not to be\n(Periphyseon, I.443c\u2013446a). According to the first\nmode, things accessible to the senses and the intellect are said to\nbe, whereas anything which, \u201cthrough the excellence of its\nnature\u201d (per excellentiam suae naturae), transcends our\nfaculties are said not to be. According to this classification, God,\nbecause of his transcendence is said not to be. He is\n\u201cnothingness through excellence\u201d (nihil per\nexcellentiam).\n\nThe second mode of being and non-being is seen in the \u201corders\nand differences of created natures\u201d (I.444a), whereby, if one\nlevel of nature is said to be, those orders above or below it, are\nsaid not to be:\n\n\nFor an affirmation concerning the lower (order) is a negation\nconcerning the higher, and so too a negation concerning the lower\n(order) is an affirmation concerning the higher.\n(Periphyseon, I.444a)\n\n\nAccording to this mode, the affirmation of man is the negation of\nangel and vice versa (affirmatio enim hominis negatio est angeli,\nnegatio vero hominis affirmatio est angeli, I.444b). This mode\nillustrates Eriugena\u2019s original way of dissolving the\ntraditional Neoplatonic hierarchy of being into a dialectic of\naffirmation and negation: to assert one level is to deny the others.\nIn other words, a particular level may be affirmed to be real by those\non a lower or on the same level, but the one above it is thought not\nto be real in the same way. If humans are thought to exist in a\ncertain way, then angels do not exist in that way.\n\nThe third mode (I.444c\u2013445b) contrasts the being of\nactual things with the \u201cnon-being\u201d of\npotential or possible things still contained, in\nEriugena\u2019s memorable phrase, \u201cin the most secret folds of\nnature\u201d (in secretissimis naturae sinibus). This mode\ncontrasts things which have come into effect with those things which\nare still contained in their causes. According to this mode, actual\nthings, which are the effects of the causes, have being, whereas those\nthings which are still virtual in the Primary Causes (e.g., the souls\nof those as yet unborn) are said not to be.\n\nThe fourth mode (I.445b\u2013c) offers a roughly Platonic criterion\nfor being: those things contemplated by the intellect alone (ea\nsolummodo quae solo comprehenduntur intellectu) may be considered\nto be, whereas things caught up in generation and corruption, viz.\nmatter, place and time, do not truly exist. The assumption is that\nthings graspable by intellect alone belong to a realm above the\nmaterial, corporeal world and hence are timeless.\n\nThe fifth mode offered by Eriugena is essentially theological and\napplies solely to humans: those sanctified by grace are said to be,\nwhereas sinners who have renounced the divine image are said not to\nbe.\n\nOne of the striking features of this complex\u2014and certainly, in\nthis form, original\u2014account is that being and non-being are\ntreated as correlative categories: something may be said to be under\none mode and not to be under another. Attribution of being is subject\nto the dialectic of affirmation and negation. Eriugena returns in Book\nThree to give a very complex discussion of the meaning of\n\u201cex nihilo\u201d in the concept of creatio ex\nnihilo, which makes use of some of these modes of being and\nnon-being, and, in general, these modes should be borne in mind when\ninterpreting Eriugena\u2019s more overt metaphysical statements. Thus\nwhen Eriugena calls God \u201cnothing\u201d, he means that God\ntranscends all created being, God is nihil per\nexcellentiam (\u201cnothingness on account of excellence\u201d)\nor, as he puts it, nihil per infinitatem (\u201cnothingness\non account of infinity\u201d). Matter, on the other hand, is also\ncalled \u201cnothing\u201d but it is \u201cnothing through\nprivation\u201d (nihil per privationem). Similarly, created\nthings are called \u201cnothing\u201d because they do not contain in\nthemselves their principles of subsistence (Eriugena is here repeating\nSt. Augustine\u2019s view that the creature, considered apart from\nGod, is mere nothing).\n3.3 The Attributes of God\n\nPeriphyseon Book One examines the first division, God\nunderstood as a transcendent One above, and yet cause of, all\ncreation. God transcends everything; He is, following\nPseudo-Dionysius, the \u201cnegation of all things\u201d\n(negatio omnium, III.686d). According to Eriugena\u2014who\nin this respect is following a tradition which includes Augustine and\nBoethius as well as Dionysius and other Greek authors\u2014the\nAristotelian categories are considered to describe only the created\nworld and do not properly apply to God (I.463d). God cannot\n\u201cliterally\u201d (proprie) be said to be substance or\nessence (ousia, essentia), nor can He be described in terms\nof quantity, quality, relation, place or time. He is\n\u201csuperessentialis\u201d (I.459d), a term which, for\nEriugena, belongs more to negative theology than to affirmative. His\n\u201cbeing\u201d is \u201cbeyond being\u201d. Eriugena\nparticularly admires a Dionysian saying from the Celestial\nHierarchy (CH iv 1; PG 3: 177d1\u20132): to gar einai panton\nestin he hyper to einai theotes (\u201cfor the being of all\nthings is the Divinity above being\u201d, III.686d) which he\ntranslates as esse omnium est superesse divinitatis,\n(\u201cthe being of all things is the super-being of divinity\u201d,\nIII.686d, I.443b; see also I.516c; III.644b, V.903c). This is perhaps\nEriugena\u2019s favorite phrase from Dionysius. (Indeed, Maximus\nConfessor had also commented on it in I Ambigua xiii, PG 91:\n1225d, a passage well known to Eriugena who translated the\nAmbigua.) Sometimes, instead of invoking the Dionysian\nformula superesse divinitatis, Eriugena speaks of the\n\u201cdivine superessentiality\u201d (divina\nsuperessentialitas, III.634b), or\u2014quoting Divine\nNames I 1\u20132 (PG 3: 588b\u2013cb)\u2014of the\n\u201csuperessential and hidden divinity\u201d (superessentialis\net occulta divinitas, I.510b).\n\nGod is a \u201cnothingness\u201d (nihilum) whose real\nessence is unknown to all created beings, including the angels (447c).\nIndeed, Eriugena argues in a radical manner, following Maximus\nConfessor, that God\u2019s nature is infinite and uncircumscribable,\nsuch that He is unknown even to Himself, since He is the\n\u201cinfinity of infinities\u201d and beyond all comprehension and\ncircumscription. In the Periphyseon, Eriugena repeats the\nposition of the De Praedestinatione that God does not know\nevil, and, in a genuine sense, God may be said not to know anything;\nhis ignorance is the highest wisdom.\n3.4 Creation as Divine Self-Manifestation\n\nEriugena conceives of the act of creation as a kind of\nself-manifestation wherein the hidden transcendent God creates himself\nby manifesting himself in divine outpourings or theophanies (I.446d).\nHe moves from darkness into the light, from self-ignorance into\nself-knowledge. The divine self-creation or self-manifestation\n(I.455b) is, at the same time (or rather timelessly), the expression\nof the Word (Logos) and hence the creation of all other things, since all\nthings are contained in the Word. The Word enfolds in itself the Ideas\nor Primary Causes of all things and in that sense all things are\nalways already in God:\n\n\n\u2026the Creative nature permits nothing outside itself because\noutside it nothing can be, yet everything which it has created and\ncreates it contains within itself, but in such a way that it itself is\nother, because it is superessential, than what it creates within\nitself. (Periphyseon, III.675c)\n\n\nGod\u2019s transcendent otherness above creatures is precisely that\nwhich allows creatures to be within God and yet other than God.\nEriugena stresses both the divine transcendence above and immanence in\ncreation. The immanence of God in the world is at the same time the\nimmanence of creatures within God. Creatures however, as fallen, do\nnot yet know that they reside in God. In cosmological terms, however,\nGod and the creature are one and the same:\n\n\nIt follows that we ought not to understand God and the creature as two\nthings distinct from one another, but as one and the same. For both\nthe creature, by subsisting, is in God; and God, by manifesting\nhimself, in a marvelous and ineffable manner creates himself in the\ncreature\u2026. (Periphyseon, III.678c)\n\n\nElsewhere Eriugena\u2019s asserts that God is the \u201cessence of\nall things\u201d (essentia omnium) and the \u201cform of\nall things\u201d (forma omnium). In the thirteenth century,\nexpressions such as these led to the accusation of heresy, i.e., that\nEriugena is collapsing the difference between God and creation. It\nmust be noted, however, that although Eriugena asserts the identity of\nGod and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the\n\u201cgenus\u201d or \u201cwhole\u201d (totum) of which\nthe creatures are \u201cspecies\u201d or \u201cparts\u201d. Only\nmetaphorically (metaforice, translative) can it be\nsaid that God is a \u201cgenus\u201d or a \u201cwhole\u201d.\nAssertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always\nbalanced in Eriugena\u2019s writings by assertions of God\u2019s\ntranscendence above all things. God is both \u201cform of all\nthings\u201d and also is without form, formless. Since God cannot be\nsaid to be anything, God cannot be simply identified with any or every\ncreature either.\n3.5 The Primordial Causes\n\nThe main focus of the Second Book of the Periphyseon is an\nanalysis of what Eriugena terms \u201cthe Primary Causes\u201d\n(causae primordiales) which are the patterns of all things\nlocated in the mind of God and function as the timeless and unchanging\ncauses of all created things. This doctrine represents an eclectic\ncombination of various earlier doctrines, including the Platonic\ntheory of Forms or ideai, Dionysius\u2019 discussion of the\ndivine names, and Augustine\u2019s revival of the Stoic notion of\neternal reasons (rationes aeternae).\n\nGod\u2019s mind, understood as the logos or verbum,\ncontains in one undivided Form all the reasons for every individual\nthing. These reasons (rationes, logoi) are\nproductive of the things of which they are the reasons. Their number\nis infinite and none has priority over the other, e.g., Being is not\nprior to Goodness, or vice-versa. Each is a divine theophany, a way in\nwhich the divine nature is manifested. The very nature of these Causes\nis to flow out from themselves, bringing about their Effects. This\n\u201coutflowing\u201d\n(\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2,\nproodos; processio, exitus) creates the\nwhole universe from the highest genus to the lowest species and\n\u201cindividuals\u201d (atoma). In his understanding of\nthis causal procession, Eriugena accepts Neoplatonic principles: like\nproduces like; incorporeal causes produce incorporeal effects; an\neternal cause produces an eternal effect. Since the causes are\nimmaterial, intellectual and eternal, so their created effects are\nessentially incorporeal, immaterial, intellectual, and eternal.\nEriugena, however, thinks of cause and effect as mutually dependent,\nrelative terms (Periphyseon, V. 910d\u2013912b): a cause is not a cause unless it\nproduces an effect, an effect is always the effect of a cause.\n3.6 The Created Effects\n\nWhat is the ontological status of the created effects? By nature, they\nare eternal and incorruptible, but Eriugena also thinks of individual\ncreated things as located spatially and temporally. He seems to think\nthere are two kinds of time: an unchanging time (a reason or\nratio in the divine mind,Periphyseon, V.906a) and a corrupting time.\nPlace and time are definitions in that they situate or locate the\nthings they define, and since definitions are in the mind, then place\nand time are in the mind (Periphyseon, I.485b). Following Gregory of Nyssa,\nEriugena holds that the sensible, corporeal, spatio-temporal\nappearances of things are produced by the qualities or\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d of place, time, position, and so on, which\nsurround the incorporeal, eternal essence. The whole spatio-temporal\nworld and our corporeal bodies are a consequence of the Fall, an\nemanation of the mind. Eriugena is somewhat ambiguous about this. His\nconsidered position appears to be that God, foreseeing that man would\nfall, created a body and a corporeal world for him. But this corporeal\nbody is not essential to human nature and in the return of all things\nto God, the body will be absorbed back into the spiritual body\n(spirituale corpus) and the spiritual body back to the mind\n(mens, intellectus, \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2). The\ncorporeal world will return to its incorporeal essence, and place\nunderstood as the extension will return back into its cause or reason\nas a definition in the mind (Periphyseon, V.889d).\n3.7 Creation from Nothing\n\nBook Three discusses the nature of created effects and the meaning of\n\u201ccreation from nothing\u201d (creatio ex nihilo). The\nterm \u201cnothing\u201d has two meanings: it can mean\n\u201cnothing through privation\u201d (nihil per\nprivationem), or \u201cnothing on account of excellence\u201d\n(nihil per excellentiam). The lowest rung in the hierarchy of\nbeing, unformed matter, is \u201calmost nothing\u201d (prope\nnihil), or \u201cnothing through privation\u201d. In contrast,\nGod is non-being through the excellence of His nature which transcends\nall being. Since there is nothing outside God, \u201ccreation from\nnothing\u201d cannot mean creation from some principle outside God,\nrather it means: creation out of God\u2019s superabundant\nnothingness. God creates out of himself (a se) and all\ncreation remains within him.\n3.8 The Return of All Things\n\nBooks Four and Five, originally planned as one book, discuss the\nreturn (\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae,\nepistrophe, reditus, reversio) of all\nthings to God. According to the cosmic cycle Eriugena accepts, drawing\nheavily on Maximus Confessor and his interpretation of\nGregory of Nyssa, it is in the nature of things for effects to return\nto their causes. There is a general return of all things to God.\nCorporeal things will return to their incorporeal causes, the temporal\nto the eternal, the finite will be absorbed in the infinite. The human\nmind will achieve reunification with the divine, and then the\ncorporeal, temporal, material world will become essentially\nincorporeal, timeless, and intellectual. Human nature will return to\nits \u201cIdea\u201d or \u201cnotio\u201d in the mind of\nGod. According to Eriugena\u2019s interpretation of scripture,\n\u201cparadise\u201d is the scriptural name for this perfect human\nnature in the mind of God. Humans who refuse to let go of the\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d remain trapped in their own phantasies,\nand it is to this mental state that the scriptural term\n\u201chell\u201d applies. Eriugena maintains that the real hell is\ndeprivation of the vision of God: \u201cwhoever is without Christ is\nin darkness, for Christ is the inner light\u201d\n(Periphyseon, V.936b\u2013937a). Eriugena continues:\n\u201cTake Christ from me, and no good is left for me, nor is there\nany torment left to terrify me\u201d (Periphyseon, V.989a). Eriugena thinks the\nGreek word for \u201chell\u201d, \u1f85\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, is\nless misleading than the Latin infernus: \u201cBut the\nGreeks, displaying as usual a greater intelligence and a subtler\naccuracy, called the nether regions \u1f85\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2,\nthat is, \u201csorrow\u201d\u201d (Periphyseon, V.955a).\nThe Latin infernus, in effect suggests an inferior place. On\nthe contrary, the Greek equivalent of infernus, i.e.,\n\u1f85\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, designates not a place, but a state:\nsorrow or unpleasantness: \u03b1\nprivative\u2014\u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03c2.\n\nAside from the general return of all things to God, Eriugena claims\nthere is a special return whereby the elect achieve\n\u201cdeification\u201d (deificatio, theosis,\n\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) whereby they will\nmerge with God completely, as lights blend into the one light, as\nvoices blend in the choir, as a droplet of water merges with the\nstream. God shall be all in all (omnia in omnibus, Periphyseon, V\n935c).\n3.9 Human Nature\n\nEriugena\u2019s account of human nature is complex and fascinating\nbecause it is woven of several threads derived from a variety of\nsources: Maximus Confessor, Pseudo-Dionysius, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nlast but not least, Augustine. Books Four and Five contain\nEriugena\u2019s anthropology, explicated as part of his commentary on\nthe six days of creation (the Hexaemeron); this aspect has recently been the focus of much\nphilosophical interest (Stock, Otten, Moran). Eriugena\u2019s account\nranges widely, treating of the creation of human nature, the Fall and\nthe consequent division of the sexes, the meaning of human nature as\nmade in the image and likeness of God (in imaginem et\nsimilitudinem dei), the nature of paradise to which perfected\nhuman nature will return, the nature of evil and how it relates to human will. He\ndraws heavily on Augustine\u2019s commentaries on Genesis, especially\nDe Genesi ad litteram, as well as Ambrose\u2019s De\nParadiso, Basil the Great\u2019s Homilies on the Hexaemeron and extensively on Gregory of Nyssa\u2019s De hominis\nopificio. But Eriugena is never a slavish follower\u2014he\ndeparts from Augustine on several points, including on the question of\nthe purely spiritual nature of paradise: whether Adam\u2019s body was\nanimal or spiritual, and whether humans ante peccatum ever\nactually spent time in paradise. Eriugena adopts Gregory of\nNyssa\u2019s view that sexual difference is a result of the Fall,\nthat the real Fall is the fall from intellect into sense, intellect\ndistracted by the voluptuousness of sense. So, sexual difference\nreally makes no difference for humans, or as Eriugena boldly puts it:\n\u201cMan is better than sex\u201d (homo melior est quam\nsexus, Periphyseon,  II.534a). This, Eriugena believes, agrees with Scripture:\n\u201cin Christ there is neither male nor female\u201d (Periphyseon, IV.795a).\nThus, Eriugena\u2019s radical Scriptural exegesis, in part building\non Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus, supports original philosophical\nclaims about the sexless nature of true, undivided, human nature.\n\nJust as the transcendent nature of God allows us to legitimately apply\ncontradictory predicates to Him (\u201cDeus est; deus\nnon est\u201d), so too we may apply contradictory predicates to\nhuman nature. Though Book IV of the Periphyseon has the\nappearance of a Biblical commentary, dialectic also plays a privileged\nrole. Eriugena employs dialectic to highlight the contradictions\ninherent in human nature: man is an animal and man is not an animal;\nman is spiritual and not spiritual. For Eriugena, these contradictions\nare really indications of man\u2019s exalted status; his essence\ncannot be circumscribed. \nHuman nature in this respect resembles the divine nature which too is\n\u201cboth beyond all things and in all things\u201d\n(Periphyseon, IV.759a\u2013b). \n\n\n\nNevertheless, humanity is a mirror of all things, and therefore Eriugena can offer\nthe definition of humanity as \u201ca certain intellectual concept\nformed eternally (aeternaliter facta) in the divine\nmind\u201d (Periphyseon, IV.768b). But of course, since everything is an Idea in\nthe divine mind, this definition applies not only to human nature but\nto all other things too. Eriugena believes he has articulated the\nuniversality and comprehensive nature of humanity but not its\nuniqueness in this definition. Following Gregory of Nyssa, Eriugena\ntherefore rejects the traditional account of human nature as a\n\u201cmicrocosm\u201d, made up of all parts of the world. He uses\nthe Greek term \u201cmicrocosmos\u201d only once in the\nPeriphyseon, at IV.793c, where he is quoting Gregory of\nNyssa, De imagine Chapter 17 (Cappuyns, 1965: 232) and glosses\nthe word: \u201cid est paruum mundum\u201d: \u201cthat is,\na small world\u201d. Gregory says those who try to glorify human\nnature by saying it is a microcosm actually do not glorify human\nnature at all. For all creatures, even a mouse, are made up of the\nfour elements, and will pass away. Gregory continues:\n\n\nBut, according to the Church\u2019s reasoning, the greatness of man\nlies not in his likeness to the created world but in the fact that he\nis created according to the image of the Creator of nature.\n(Periphyseon, IV.794a)\n\n\nEriugena, however, recognizes the crucial role of human nature in mediating\nbetween the divine and created things. Human nature is the\n\u201cworkshop of all things\u201d (officina omnium,\nII.530d; IV.755b). Human nature is a medium between animal\nand angel, a medietas between the earthly and the\nintelligible worlds. Human nature contains not only elements from the\ncorporeal world but also belongs to the intelligible world:\n\n\nI declare that man consists of one and the same rational soul\nconjoined to the body in a mysterious manner, and that it is by a\ncertain wonderful and intelligible division that man himself is\ndivided into two parts, in one of which he is created in the image and\nlikeness of the Creator, and participates in no animality \u2026\nwhile in the other he communicates with the animal nature and was\nproduced out of the earth, that is to say, out of the common nature of\nall things, and is included in the universal genus of animals.\n(Periphyseon, IV.754a\u2013b)\n\n\nThe highest dignity for human nature is that it uniquely mirrors\ntranscendent divine nature. Only of human nature can it be said that\nit is made in the image and likeness of God. Not even the angels are\naccorded that honor, so in a sense man is greater than the angels.\nHuman nature may even require the application of affirmative and\nnegative propositions: Man is an animal and man is not an animal\n(IV.758b).\n Although, for Eriugena, \u201crational animal\u201d\ndoes not completely define human nature,\nthis mirroring of God in man occurs especially in the cognitive\ndomain. Like Maximus, Eriugena argues that God knows that He is\n(quia est), but not what He is (quid est). God has\nexistential knowledge, but no circumscribing knowledge of His essence,\nsince, as infinite, He is uncircumscribable:\n\n\nSo God does not know of Himself what He is because He is not a\n\u201cwhat\u201d, being in everything incomprehensible both to\nHimself and to every intellect \u2026 But He does not recognize\nHimself as being something (Se ipsum autem non cognoscit aliquid\nesse) \u2026 For if He were to recognize Himself in something,\nHe would show that He is not in every respect infinite and\nincomprehensible. (Periphyseon, II.589b\u2013c)\n\n\nFollowing Maximus Confessor, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine, Eriugena\ntakes the imago dei idea to its ultimate consequence by\nforging an apophatic-negative anthropology: the human being, as the image of God,  knows\nthat it is, but it cannot comprehend or\ncircumscribe its own essence or nature, since, in its deepest core, as imago dei, it too is infinite as God is infinite. All that can be done is to specify the\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d (circumstantiae) which surround\nhis essence, e.g., place, time, rest, motion, condition, etc.,\n(Periphyseon, II.586d). The human being in this sense is an\nimage of the infinite and uncircumscribable God, and an image is\nidentical to its archetype in all respects \u201cexcept in respect of\nsubject\u201d (praeter rationem subiecti,\nPeriphyseon II.598b). Any difference between God and human\nnature is the result not of essence but of \u201can accident produced\nby sin\u201d (sed ex delicto accidit, II.598b). Human\nself-ignorance mirrors the divine self-ignorance; human\nincomprehensibility mirrors divine incomprehensibility. This makes\nhuman nature share in infinity. \n\nEriugena elaborates on the parallels\nbetween human and divine nature. Perfect human nature would have\npossessed the fullest knowledge of its Creator, of itself, and of\neverything else, had it not sinned (Periphyseon, IV.778c). Man would have ruled the\nwhole of the universe as a king rules his subjects (Periphyseon, IV.782c). Man,\nlike God, is the plenitudo bonorum (Periphyseon, IV.796a). Just as God is\nunbounded by any category and ultimately indefinable, human nature is\nineffable and incomprehensible and open to infinite possibility and\nperfectibility (Periphyseon, V.919c). God\u2019s transcendence and immanence are\nreflected in human transcendence and immanence with regard to its\nworld. Consider the following remarkable passage from Book Four which\nis a typical example of Eriugena\u2019s dialectical thinking and of\nthe close parallelism between human and divine:\n\n\nFor just as God is both beyond all things and in all things\u2014for\nHe Who only truly is, is the essence of all things, and while He is\nwhole in all things He does not cease to be whole beyond all things,\nwhole in the world, whole around the world, whole in the sensible\ncreature, whole in the intelligible creature, whole creating the\nuniverse, whole created in the universe, whole in the whole of the\nuniverse and whole in its parts, since He is both the whole and the\npart, just as He is neither the whole nor the part\u2014in the same\nway human nature in its own world (in its own subsistence) in its own\nuniverse and in its invisible and visible parts is whole in itself,\nand whole in its whole, and whole in its parts, and its parts are\nwhole in themselves and whole in the whole. (Periphyseon,\nIV.759a\u2013b)\n\n\nEriugena concludes that human nature is \n\n\nwholly in the wholeness of the whole created nature (in\nuniversitate totius conditae naturae tota est), seeing that in it\nevery creature is fashioned, and in it all are linked together (in\nipsa copulata), and into it all shall return, and through it must\nall be saved. (Periphyseon, IV.760a)\n\n\nEriugena\u2019s cosmological account has been criticized for\ncollapsing the differences between God and creation, leading to a\nheresy later labeled as pantheism. There is no doubt that\nEriugena\u2019s theological intentions are orthodox, but he is a\nbold, speculative thinker, who believes that philosophy uncovers the\ntrue meaning of faith. Eriugena (as does Nicholas of Cusa) gives a\nunique place to Christ in the outgoing and return of all things. In\nChrist, the hypostatic union of the divine and the created orders is\nrealized. Christ possesses all the perfections of human nature, since\nvir autem perfectus est Christus (Periphyseon,\nIV.743b), and Christ is also one in substance with God. Eriugena\nrecognizes that Christ is unique and that the individual is not\ncollapsed into the universal, even in the return. Humans will always\nbe different from God in that they have been created and God is\nCreator (Periphyseon, IV.796b). However, a case can also be\nmade for saying that Eriugena really intends his perfected human\nnature to possess divine attributes in a genuine way. The argument\nturns on an answer to the following question: To what extent is man\nmade in the image and likeness of God? Eriugena has two answers: an\nimage is not an image unless it is identical to its exemplar in all\nrespects \u201cexcept number\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d\n(excepta subiecti ratione, Periphyseon, IV.778a).\nFrom this we may conclude that the human being differs from God in\nsubiecto, that is, there is solely a difference in number. But\ndifference in number does not mean that God and man stand apart from\neach other as two identical billiard balls would occupy different\nplaces. Neither God nor man is in space or time; both are incorporeal,\nand hence numerical difference, or difference in subject, can only\nhave the Neoplatonic meaning that the first will always differ from\nwhat comes after the first. God is first, and hence man comes after.\nBut \u201cafter\u201d (post) here has no temporal meaning,\nas Eriugena emphasizes (Periphyseon, IV.808a). A second\nanswer he gives is that God is creator and man is created, but since\ncreation is self-manifestation, that amounts to saying no more than\nthat God manifests himself fully in man. Eriugena sometimes qualifies\nthis by saying that man is by grace (per gratiam) what God is\nby nature, quoting Maximus Confessor (e.g., Periphyseon,\nV.879c\u2013880a), but elsewhere, especially in the concept of\ntheophany or divine manifestation, he fuses the notion of nature with\nthat of grace: all natures are theophanies, divine manifestations, so\nGod is the source of both dona (gifts of grace)\nand data (what are given in nature), both are revelations of\nthe divine nature. Indeed, there are many places where Eriugena cites\ntexts (e.g., Maximus) to suggest that God and man mirror each\nother. His translation of Maximus includes the proposition: \u201cFor\nthey say that man and God are paradigms of each other\u201d\n(Dicunt enim inter se invicem paradigmata Deum et hominem, PL\n122: 1220a). One is at the heart of the other. Similarly, human nature\nand the angelic nature are mutually mirroring. This notion of the\nintertwining and merging of minds is at the very core of\nEriugena\u2019s mysticism and of his understanding of the relation\nbetween human and divine natures and their coming together in the\nperson of Christ. Christ is actually what all human beings can become\nand that is precisely the promise of salvation for Eriugena. Consider\nthe following passage from Book Two:\n\n\nFor if Christ Who understands of all things, (Who) indeed is the\nunderstanding of all things, really unified all that He assumed, who\ndoubts then that what first took place in the Head and principal\nExemplar of the whole of human nature will eventually happen in the\nwhole? (Periphyseon, II.545a)\n\n\nEriugena articulates the view that God\u2019s becoming human (His\nincarnation or inhumanisation) is balanced cosmologically by the human being\nbecoming divinized in deification (deificatio, Greek:\ntheosis). The phrase \u201cGod was made man so that man\ncould be made God\u201d (Latin: factus est Deus homo, ut homo\nfieret Deus) is a commonplace among the Christian Fathers,\nespecially in the Eastern tradition. It is to be found in Greek in St.\nIrenaeus, in St. Athanasius (298\u2013373) in his treatise De\nincarnatione 54, 3 (PG 25: 192B); and, in Latin, in St.\nAugustine, (e.g., his sermon In natali Domini, VIII, PL 38:\n1009 footnote; and In natali Domini, XII, PL 39: 1997) and\nelsewhere. There are several passages where Eriugena (following St.\nAugustine and Maximus Confessor) balances the humanization/incarnation\nof God with the deification of man (see for instance his\nHomilia XXIII, PL 122: 296a\u2013c; Commentarius in\nEvangelium Iohannis I, xxiv, PL 122: 300a). It is often expressed\nin terms of man becoming \u201cby grace\u201d (per gratiam)\nwhat God is \u201cby nature\u201d (per naturam). Eriugena\nfollows the Greek formulation of the Council of Nicaea (NB: not the\nLatin version) and the Greek Christian tradition (specifically Maximus\nConfessor) in occasionally distinguishing between inhumanatio\n(Greek: enanthropesis)\u2014the relation between the Second\nPerson of the Trinity and human nature)\u2014and incarnatio\n(Greek: \u03b5\u03bd\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7)\u2014the temporal becoming flesh of the\nVerbum in Jesus (see for instance Periphyseon I.449b; and\nHomilia XIX, PL 122: 294c). Eriugena refers to the\ntheosis or deification of human nature at\nPeriphyseon I.449b (and elsewhere, see Periphyseon,\nIV.743a, IV.760d) and draws extensively on Maximus for the view that\nthere will be a reunification of human nature with the divine (see\nPeriphyseon, II.536d ff). In his Homilia Eriugena\nwrites: \u201cOf deification, however, I say, that man and God are\nunited in the unity of the one substance\u201d (Deificationis\nautem, dico, qua homo et deus in unitatem unius substantiae adunati\nsunt, PL 122: 296c).\n\nThis clearly implies that humanity as a whole, that is, resurrected\nhuman nature in its perfected state, will be truly illuminated and\nmerged with the divine, for human nature itself in its true essence is\nthe intellectus omnium. Furthermore, the use of the future\ntense here is somewhat misleading, since time itself is a function of\nour fallen state and the perfected state is timeless so there is a\nsense in which perfected human nature already is one with God and\nalways has been one with God. Eriugena, then, has a dialectical\nunderstanding of the relation of God and man which can be viewed as\northodox from one point of view, but which is always transgressing the\nboundaries of orthodoxy in the direction of a view which has God and\nman mutually contemplating themselves and each other, in an endless,\neternal play of theophanies. Thus, a kind of mystical humanism is\ncelebrated in Periphyseon Book Four, a humanism unfolded\nthrough the dialectic of self-knowledge and ignorance.\n\nIn Eriugena\u2019s conceptions of God, the cosmos and human nature,\nthere is an extraordinarily bold emphasis on infinity. God is infinite\nand manifests Himself infinitely in His theophanies; the causes\nthemselves are infinite; the created cosmos too would be infinite were\nit not for the Fall; finally, human nature is essentially unbounded\nand infinite. The Holy Scriptures too have a kind of infinite\nrichness: Sacrae scripturae interpretatio infinita est,\nII.560a. Employing an original simile, Eriugena claims that the number\nof interpretations of Holy Scripture is like the innumerable colors in\na peacock\u2019s tail (IV.749c). Human understanding and learning are\nalso endless. Eriugena emphasizes the lack of limit and inherent\ntranscendence not just of human nature but also of the whole of\nnature. Nature as a whole is an infinite series of theophanies. This\nconception of God as \u201cmore than infinite\u201d and as the\n\u201cinfinity of infinities\u201d is Eriugena\u2019s most\nsignificant contribution to philosophy, one that attracted both the\nattention of medieval mystics and later of German Idealists.\n",
