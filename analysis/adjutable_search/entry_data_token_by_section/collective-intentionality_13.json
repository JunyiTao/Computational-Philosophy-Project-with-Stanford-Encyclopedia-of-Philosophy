    "main_text": "Specific Issues || Team Reasoning\n4.4 The Mark of Mankind\n\nCollective or shared intentionality has been assigned a prominent role\nin recent research in evolutionary anthropology and developmental\npsychology. Michael Tomasello and his collaborators have suggested\nthat our capacity for shared intentionality is the most basic\ndifference between humans and other primates. The evidence quoted for\nthis claim is that while other primates seem to be apt strategic\nreasoners with an impressively well-developed sense of what other\nindividuals perceive and want, the propensity to joint attention and\nthe inclination to cooperation even where this does not immediately\nserve one\u2019s own purposes is uniquely human. Tomasello argues\nthat this basic cooperative-mindedness expresses a specifically human\ncapacity for shared intentionality (Tomasello & Racokzy 2003).\nIt is only on this base that other distinctively human capacities,\nsuch as the capacity for language and morality, can develop (Tomasello\n2009, 2016). Tomasello refers to Searle\u2019s, Gilbert\u2019s and\nBratman\u2019s accounts, but remains largely noncommittal as to the\nquestion of what exactly the conception of shared intention he has in\nmind amounts to (Schmid 2012). However, his conception suggests that a\nSearlean version may be the basic form of shared intention, and that a\nnormatively stabilized conception of collective intentionality as\ndeveloped by Gilbert may be adequate for the forms of shared intention\ncoming a later stage in development. If Tomasello is right in claiming\nthat the basic capacity for shared intention precedes the development\nof a full theory of mind, this places tight conceptual restriction on\nan adequate analysis of basic shared intention, this seems to rule out\nthe common knowledge-condition that is implied even in Searle\u2019s\n(2010) account.\n",
