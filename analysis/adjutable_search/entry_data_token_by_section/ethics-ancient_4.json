    "main_text": "Cynics\n5. Cynics\n\nAlthough the Cynics had an impact on moral thinking in Athens after\nthe death of Socrates, it is through later, and highly controversial,\nreports of their deeds and sayings \u2013 rather than their writings\n\u2013 that we know of them. Diogenes the Cynic, the central figure,\nis famous for living in a wine jar (Diogenes Laertius [= DL] VI 23)\nand going about with a lantern looking for \u2018a man\u2019 \u2013\ni.e., someone not corrupted (DL VI 41). He claimed to set courage over\nagainst fortune, nature against convention, and reason against passion\n(DL VI 38). Of this trio of opposites, the most characteristic for\nunderstanding the Cynics is nature against convention. Diogenes taught\nthat a life according to nature was better than one that conformed to\nconvention. First of all, natural life is simpler. Diogenes ate,\nslept, or conversed wherever it suited him and carried his food around\nwith him (DL VI 22). When he saw a child drinking out of its hand, he\nthrew away his cup, saying that a child had bested him in frugality\n(DL VI 37). He said the life of humans had been made easy by the gods\nbut that humans had lost sight of this through seeking after honeyed\ncakes, perfumes, and similar things (DL VI 44). With sufficient\ntraining the life according to nature is the happy life (DL VI\n71).\n\nAccordingly Diogenes became famous for behavior that flouted\nconvention (DL VI 69). Still, he thought that the simple life not only\nfreed one from unnecessary concerns but was essential to virtue.\nAlthough he says nothing specific about the virtues, he does commend\ntraining for virtuous behavior (DL VI 70). His frugality certainly\nbespeaks self-control. He condemned love of money, praised good men,\nand held love to be the occupation of the idle (DL VI\n50\u201351).\n\nBesides his contempt for convention, what is most noteworthy about\nDiogenes as a moral teacher is his emphasis on detachment from those\nthings most people consider good. In this emphasis, Diogenes seems to\nhave intensified a tendency found in Socrates. Certainly Socrates\ncould be heedless of convention and careless about providing for his\nbodily needs. To Plato, however, Diogenes seemed to be Socrates gone\nmad (DL VI 54). Still, in Diogenes\u2019 attitude, we can see at\nleast the beginning of the idea that the end of life is a\npsychological state marked by detachment. Counseling the simple and\nuncomplicated satisfaction of one\u2019s natural instincts and\ndesires, Diogenes urges detachment from those things held out by\nconvention to be good. While he is not so explicit, others develop the\ntheme of detachment into the notion of tranquility. The Stoics and\nEpicureans hold that happiness depends on detachment from vulnerable\nor difficult to obtain bodily and external goods and consists in a\npsychological state more under one\u2019s own direct control. In this\nway, happiness becomes associated (for the Epicureans) with\ntranquility (ataraxia). Finally, in Skepticism, suspension of\njudgment is a kind of epistemic detachment that provides tranquility.\nSo in Diogenes we find the beginnings of an idea that will become\ncentral to later ancient moral theory.\n",
