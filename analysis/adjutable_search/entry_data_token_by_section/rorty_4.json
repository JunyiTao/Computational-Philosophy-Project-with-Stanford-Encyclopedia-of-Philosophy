    "main_text": "Against Epistemology || Rationality, Science, and Truth\n2.3 Rationality, Science, and Truth\n\nAttacking the idea that we must acknowledge the world\u2019s\nnormative constraint on our belief-systems if we are to be rational\nsubjects, Rorty has drawn a great deal of criticism that takes\nscience, particularly natural science, as its chief reference point.\nTwo general kinds of criticisms are often raised. The first insists\nthat science consists precisely in the effort to learn the truth about\nhow things are by methodically allowing us to be constrained in our\nbeliefs by the world. On this view, Rorty is simply denying the very\nidea of science. The other kind of criticism seeks to be internal: if\nRorty\u2019s view of science were to prevail, scientists would no\nlonger be motivated to carry on as they are; science would cease to be\nthe useful sort of thing that Rorty also thinks it is (see, e.g.,\nBernard Williams, \u201cAuto da Fe\u201d in Malachowski, 1990).\nHowever, Rorty\u2019s view of science is more complicated than he\nhimself sometimes implies. He says: \u201cI tend to view natural\nscience as in the business of controlling and predicting things, and\nas largely useless for philosophical purposes\u201d (\u201cReply to\nHartshorne,\u201d Saatkamp, 32). Yet he spends a good deal of time\ndrawing an alternative picture of the intellectual virtues that good\nscience embodies (ORT, Part I). This is a picture which eschews the\nnotion that science succeeds, when it does, in virtue of being in\ntouch with reality in a special way, the sort of way that\nepistemologists, when successful, can clarify. It is in this sense\nspecifically that Rorty disavows science as philosophically\nsignificant. Good science may nevertheless be a model of rationality,\nin Rorty\u2019s view, exactly in so far as scientific practice has\nsucceeded in establishing institutions conducive to the democratic\nexchange of views.\n\nThe provocative and counterintuitive force of Rorty\u2019s treatment\nof rationality and science in terms of conversational ethics is\nundeniable. It is important to realize, though, that Rorty is not\ndenying that there is any bona fide use of notions like truth,\nknowledge, or objectivity. Rather his point is that our ordinary uses\nof these notions always trade for their content and point on\nparticular features of their varying contexts of application. His\nfurther point is that when we abstract away from these different\ncontexts and practices, in search of general notions, we are left with\npure abstract hypostatizations incapable of providing us with any\nguide to action at all. The upshot, Rorty holds, is that we simply do\nnot have a concept of objective reality which can be invoked either to\nexplain the success of some set of norms of warrant, or to justify\nsome set of standards over against others. This is perhaps clearest in\nRorty\u2019s treatment of the concept of truth. With regard to truth,\nRorty\u2019s rhetoric and philosophical strategy has indeed shifted\nover the last three decades. As late as in 1982 (in CP) he still\nattempts to articulate his view of truth by drawing on William\nJames\u2019s famous definition in terms of what is good in the way of\nbelief. Soon after this, however, Rorty comes to doubt the point of\nany theory of truth, and, following Davidson\u2019s lead, explicitly\nrejects all attempts to explicate the notion of truth in terms of\nother concepts. Rorty\u2019s mature view of the point and\nsignificance of the concept of truth is first elaborated in\n\u201cDavidson, Pragmatism and Truth\u201d (in ORT). Recent\nexpressions are found in the first of the two Spinoza Lectures given\nat the University of Amsterdam in 1997, \u201cIs it Desirable to Love\ntruth?\u201d, in the paper, \u201cIs Truth a Goal of Inquiry? Donald\nDavidson versus Crispin Wright\u201d (TP), as well as in the\nintroductions to, respectively, TP and PSH. In these writings, Rorty\nargues that while \u201ctruth\u201d has various important uses, it\ndoes not itself name a goal towards which we can strive, over and\nabove warrant or justification. His argument is not that truth is\nreducible to warrant, but that the concept has no deep or substantive\ncriterial content at all. That is, there are only semantic\nexplanations to be offered for why it is the case that a given\nsentence is true just when its truth conditions are satisfied. So\naiming for truth, as opposed to warrant, does not point to a possible\nline of action, just as we have no measure of our approximation to\ntruth other than increasing warrant. Indeed, for Rorty, this is part\nof what makes the concept so useful, in a manner not coincidentally\nanalogous with goodness; it ensures that no sentence can ever be\nanalytically certified as true by virtue of its possession of some\nother property. Rorty\u2019s attitude to the concept of truth has\nbeen much criticized, often on the grounds that the very notion of\nwarrant, indeed the concept of belief in general, presupposes the\nnotion of truth. However, it may be that we can do justice to these\nconnections without supposing that the notion of truth thus involved\nbacks up the notions of belief and warrant with any substantive\nnormative content of its own. Indeed, that neither the concept of\ntruth, nor those of objectivity and of reality, can be invoked to\nexplain or legitimate our inferential practices and our standards of\nwarrant, is the essence of Rorty\u2019s conversationalism, or\nepistemological behaviorism.\n",
