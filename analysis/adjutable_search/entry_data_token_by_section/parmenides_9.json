    "main_text": "Some Principal Types of Interpretation || The Aspectual Interpretation Prevailing in Antiquity\n3.4 The Aspectual Interpretation Prevailing in Antiquity\n\nThe idea that Parmenides\u2019 arguments so problematized the\nphenomenon of change as to make developing an adequate theoretical\naccount of it the central preoccupation of subsequent Presocratic\nnatural philosophers is a commonplace of modern historical narratives.\nUnfortunately, this notion has no real ancient authority.\nAristotle\u2019s account at Physics\n1.8.191a23\u201333 of the wrong turn he claims earlier\nnatural philosophers took in trying to understand the principles of\nchange has often been thought to legitimate this view, given the\nEleatic-sounding argument it records. But Aristotle mentions\nParmenides nowhere in the passage, and his complaint is in fact\nbroadly directed against all the early Greek philosophers whose views\nhe has been surveying previously in the book. He complains that they\nnaively adopted the view that no fundamental entity or substance comes\nto be or perishes, the result being that they are unable to account\nfor, because they disavow, substantial change, which is the very\nphenomenon Aristotle is most interested in explaining. Aristotle\nactually understands Parmenides\u2019 thesis that what is is one\n(hen to on) and not subject to generation and change as\nbelonging, not to natural philosophy, but to first philosophy or\nmetaphysics (Cael. 3.1.298b14\u201324; cf.\nMetaph. 1.5.986b14\u201318, Ph.\n1.2.184a25-b12).\n\nIn the complex treatment of Parmenides in Physics\n1.2\u20133, Aristotle introduces Parmenides together with Melissus as\nrepresenting the position \u2013\u00a0within the doxographical schema\nadapted from that in\u00a0Gorgias's On Nature, or On What is\nNot\u00a0that structures\u00a0his own examination of earlier\narch\u00ea-theories \u2013\u00a0that there is a single and\nunchanging arch\u00ea or principle (Ph.\n1.2.184b15\u201316). Aristotle recognizes, however, that\nthis grouping obscures very real differences between the two\nthinkers\u2019 views. According to Aristotle, Melissus held that\neverything is a single, i.e. continuous or indivisible, and unlimited\nquantity (or extension). Parmenides, on Aristotle\u2019s\nreconstruction, recognized only a use of \u201cbeing\u201d\nindicating what something is in respect of its substance or essence;\nhe accordingly supposed that everything that is is substance, and he\nsupposed everything to be one in the sense that the account of the\nessence of everything is identical. Furthermore, on Aristotle\u2019s\nview of Parmenides, whatever might differentiate what is cannot do so\nwith respect to its essence but only accidentally. But no accident of\nwhat just is can belong to its essence, and since Parmenides admits\nonly a use of \u201cbeing\u201d indicating what something is in\nrespect of its substance or essence, no differentiating accident of\nwhat is can be said to be. Such is the thrust of Aristotle\u2019s\nreconstruction of Parmenides\u2019 reasoning at Physics\n1.3.186a34-b4 and, likewise, of his summary\nallusion to this passage at Metaphysics\n1.5.986b28\u201331.\n\nThe only point where Aristotle\u2019s representation of Parmenides in\nMetaphysics 1.5 appears to differ from the major treatment in\nPhysics 1.2\u20133 is in following up this summary with the\nqualification that, being compelled to go with the phenomena, and\nsupposing that what is is one with respect to the account (sc. of its\nessence) but plural with respect to perception, he posited a duality\nof principles as the basis for his account of the phenomena\n(986b27\u201334, reading to on hen men at\n986b31, as per Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019s\u00a0paraphrase). This is only a superficial\ndifference, given how at Physics\n1.5.188a19\u201322 Aristotle points to the Parmenidean\nduality of principles to support his thesis that all his predecessors\nhad made the opposites principles, including those who maintained that\neverything is one and unchanging. Nonetheless, the representation of\nParmenides\u2019 position in Metaphysics 1.5, according to\nwhich what is is one with respect to the account of its essence but\nplural with respect to perception, is more indulgent than the\nreconstruction of Parmenides\u2019 reasoning in Physics 1.3\nin that it allows for a differentiated aspect of what is. By allowing\nthat what is may be differentiated with respect to its phenomenal\nqualities, Aristotle seems to have recognized at some level the\nmistake in assuming that Parmenides\u2019 failure to distinguish\nexplicitly among the senses of \u201cbeing\u201d entails that he\ncould only have employed the term in one sense.\n\nDespite the assimilation of Melissus and Parmenides under the rubric\ninherited from Gorgias, Aristotle recognized that grouping the two\nfigures together under this convenient label obscured fundamental\ndifferences in their positions. The fact is that \u201cmonism\u201d\ndoes not denote a unique metaphysical position but a family of\npositions. Among its species are strict monism or the position that\njust one thing exists. This is the position Melissus advocated, one\nwhich no serious metaphysician should want to adopt. More familiar\nspecies include both numerical and generic substance monism, according\nto which, respectively, there is a single substance or a single kind\nof substance. Aristotle seems ultimately to have inclined toward\nattributing this first type of \u201cgenerous\u201d monism to\nParmenides. In viewing Parmenides as a generous monist, whose position\nallowed for the existence of other entities, rather than as a\n\u201cstrict\u201d monist holding that only one thing exists,\nAristotle is in accord with the majority view of Parmenides in\nantiquity.\n\nThat some in antiquity viewed Parmenides as a strict monist is evident\nfrom Plutarch\u2019s report of the Epicurean Colotes\u2019 treatment\nof Parmenides in his treatise, That One Cannot Live According to\nthe Doctrines of Other Philosophers. Colotes\u2019 main claim\nappears to have been that Parmenides prevents us from living by\nmaintaining that \u201cthe universe is one\u201d (hen to\npan), a tag which Colotes apparently took to mean that Parmenides\ndenied the existence of fire and water and, indeed, \u201cthe\ninhabited cities in Europe and Asia\u201d; he may also have claimed\nthat if one accepts Parmenides\u2019 thesis, there will be nothing to\nprevent one from walking off a precipice, since on his view there are\nno such things (Plut. Col. 1114B). In short, as Plutarch\nreports, Colotes said that \u201cParmenides abolishes everything by\nhypothesizing that being is one\u201d (1114D). Plutarch himself,\nhowever, takes strong issue with Colotes\u2019 view, charging him\nwith imputing to Parmenides \u201cdisgraceful sophisms\u201d (1113F)\nand with deliberately misconstruing his position (1114D). Plutarch\nexplains that Parmenides was in fact the first to distinguish between\nthe mutable objects of sensation and the unchanging character of the\nintelligible: \u201cParmenides\u2026abolishes neither nature.\nInstead, assigning to each what is appropriate, he places the\nintelligible in the class of what is one and being\u2014calling it\n\u2018being\u2019 in so far as it is eternal and imperishable, and\n\u2018one\u2019 because of its likeness unto itself and its not\nadmitting differentiation\u2014while he locates the perceptible among\nwhat is disordered and changing\u201d (1114D). Plutarch insists that\nParmenides\u2019 distinction between what really is and things which\nare what they are at one time, or in one context, but not another\nshould not be misconstrued as an abolition of the latter class of\nentities: \u201chow could he have let perception and doxa\nremain without leaving what is apprehended by perception and\ndoxa?\u201d (1114E-F). Plutarch\u2019s discussion of\nParmenides in Against Colotes is particularly significant in\nthat it is a substantial discussion of the relation between his\naccount of Being and his cosmology by an ancient author later than\nAristotle that is not overtly influenced by Aristotle\u2019s own\ndiscussions. In many ways it anticipates the Neoplatonic\ninterpretation, represented in Simplicius, according to which, broadly\nspeaking, the two accounts delivered by Parmenides\u2019 goddess\ndescribe two levels of reality, the immutable intelligible realm and\nthe plural and changing sensible realm (see especially\nSimplicius\u2019s commentary on Arist. Cael.\n3.1.298b14\u201324; cf. Procl. in Ti.\n1.345.18\u201324).\n\nLater Platonists naturally understood Parmenides as thus anticipating\nPlato, for Plato himself seems to have adopted a\n\u201cPlatonist\u201d understanding of this thinker whose influence\non his own philosophy was every bit as profound as that of Socrates\nand the Pythagoreans. Aristotle attributes to both Parmenides and\nPlato the recognition that knowledge requires as its objects certain\nnatures or entities not susceptible to change\u2014to Parmenides in\nDe Caelo 3.1, and to Plato, in remarkably similar language,\nin Metaphysics 13.4. The arguments at the end of\nRepublic 5 that confirm Aristotle\u2019s attribution of this\nline of reasoning to Plato are in fact suffused with echoes of\nParmenides. Plato likewise has his fictionalized Parmenides present\nsomething very close to this line of argument in the dialogue bearing\nhis name: \u201cif someone will not admit that there are general\nkinds of entities\u2026and will not specify some form for each\nindividual thing, he will have nowhere to turn his intellect, since he\ndoes not admit that there is a character for each of the things that\nare that is always the same, and in this manner he will destroy the\npossibility of discourse altogether\u201d (Prm. 135b5-c2).\nThe Platonic \u201cnatures\u201d Aristotle has in mind are clearly\nthe Forms that Plato himself is prone to describing in language that\nechoes the attributes of Parmenidean Being, most notably at\nSymposium 210e-211b and Phaedo 78d and 80b. That\nPlato\u2019s Forms are made to look like a plurality of Parmenidean\nBeings might seem to supply Platonic authority for the meta-principle\ninterpretation. This would be a rash conclusion, however, for Plato\nconsistently represents Parmenides as a monist in later dialogues\n(see, e.g., Prm. 128a8-b1, d1, Tht. 180e2\u20134,\n183e3\u20134, Sph. 242d6, 244b6). Determining just what type\nof monism Plato means to attribute to Parmenides in these dialogues\nultimately requires plunging into the intricacies of the examination\nof Parmenides\u2019 thesis in the latter part of the\nParmenides.\n\nPlato\u2019s understanding of Parmenides is best reflected in that\ndialogue\u2019s exploration of his thesis in the Second Deduction\n(Prm. 142a9 ff.). There the One is shown to have a number of\nproperties that reflect those Parmenides himself attributed to Being\nin the course of fr. 8: that it is in itself and the same as itself,\nthat it is at rest, that it is like itself, that it is in contact with\nitself, etc. In the Second Deduction, all these properties prove to\nbelong to the One in virtue of its own nature and in relation to\nitself. This deduction also shows that the One has apparently contrary\nattributes, though these prove to belong to it in other aspects, that\nis, not in virtue of its own nature and/or not in relation to itself.\nPlato would have found a model for his complex account of the various\nand seemingly conflicting properties of the One in the two\nmajor\u00a0phases of Parmenides\u2019 poem if he, too, subscribed to\nan \u201caspectual\u201d interpretation of Parmenides, according to\nwhich the Way of Conviction describes the cosmos in its intelligible\naspect qua being, while allowing that this description is\ncompatible with an alternate description of this self-same entity as a\nworld system comprised of differentiated and changing objects. These\ntwo perspectives are notably reflected, respectively, in the\nTimaeus\u2019s descriptions of the intelligible living\ncreature and of the visible cosmos modelled upon it, both of which are\nsuffused with echoes of Parmenides (see especially Ti. 30d2,\n31a7-b3, 32c5-33a2, 33b4-6, d2-3, 34a3\u20134, b1\u20132, and\n92c6\u20139).\n\nThat Aristotle also viewed the two major phases of Parmenides\u2019\npoem as dual accounts of the same entity in different aspects is\nperhaps most apparent in his characterization of Parmenides, in the\ncourse of the discussion at Metaphysics\n1.5.986b27\u201334, as having supposed that \u201cwhat is\nis one in account but plural with respect to perception.\u201d\nTheophrastus likewise seems to have adopted such a line. Alexander of\nAphrodisias quotes him as having written the following of Parmenides\nin the first book of his On the Natural Philosophers:\n\nComing after this man [sc. Xenophanes], Parmenides of Elea, son of\nPyres, went along both paths. For he both declares that the universe\nis eternal and also attempts to explain the generation of the things\nthat are, though without taking the same view of them both, but\nsupposing that in accordance with truth the universe is one and\nungenerated and spherical in shape, while in accordance with the view\nof the multitude, and with a view to explaining the generation of\nthings as they appear to us, making the principles two, fire and\nearth, the one as matter and the other as cause and agent (Alex.Aphr.\nin Metaph. 31.7\u201316; cf. Simp. in Ph.\n25.15\u201316, D.L. 9.21\u20132).\n\n\nMany of Theophrastus\u2019s points here can be traced back to\nAristotle, including the identification of Parmenides\u2019 elemental\nlight and night as, respectively, fire functioning as an efficient\nprinciple and earth functioning as a material principle (cf. Arist.\nPh. 1.5.188a20\u20132, GC\n1.3.318b6\u20137, 2.3.330b13\u201314,\nMetaph. 1.5.986b28\u2013987a2). The\npassage on the whole suggests that, like Plato and Aristotle,\nTheophrastus understood Parmenides as furnishing dual accounts of the\nuniverse, first in its intelligible and then in its phenomenal\naspects.\n\nWhile it would be going too far to claim that Plato, Aristotle,\nTheophrastus, and the ancient thinkers who follow their broad view of\nParmenides as a generous monist got Parmenides right on all points,\nnonetheless the impulse toward \u201ccorrecting\u201d (or just\nignoring) the ancient evidence for Presocratic thought has in this\ncase gone too far. Both Plato and Aristotle understood Parmenides as\nperhaps the first to have developed the idea that apprehension of what\nis unchanging is of a different order epistemologically than\napprehension of things subject to change. More fundamentally, Plato\nand Aristotle both came to understand Parmenides as a type of generous\nmonist whose conception of what is belongs more to theology or first\nphilosophy than to natural science. This involved understanding\nParmenides\u2019 cosmology as his own account of the world in so far\nas it is subject to change. It also involved understanding the first\npart of Parmenides\u2019 poem as metaphysical, in the proper\nAristotelian sense of being concerned with what is not subject to\nchange and enjoys a non-dependent existence. Most importantly, both\nPlato and Aristotle recognized that a distinction between the\nfundamental modalities or ways of being was central to\nParmenides\u2019 system. None of these major points is tainted by the\nkind of obvious anachronism that rightly makes one suspicious, for\ninstance, about Aristotle\u2019s identification of Parmenides\u2019\nlight and night with the elements fire and earth. None of these broad\npoints, in other words, involves Plato or Aristotle viewing Parmenides\nthrough the distorting lens of their own concepetual apparatus. The\nnext section will outline the view of Parmenides\u2019 philosophical\nachievement that results from attending to his modal distinctions and\nto the epistemological distinctions he builds upon them.\n",
