    "main_text": "Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self || Thesis 6: Consciousness of Self is not Knowledge of Self\n4.6 Thesis 6: Consciousness of Self is not Knowledge of Self\n\n\nTranscendental designation immediately yields the distinction that\nKant needs to allow that one is conscious of oneself as one is, not\njust of an appearance of self, and yet deny knowledge of oneself as one\nis. If consciousness of self ascribes nothing to the self, it can be a\n\u201cbare \u2026 consciousness of self [as one is]\u201d and yet\nyield no knowledge of self\u2014it is \u201cvery far from being a\nknowledge of the self\u201d (B158). This thesis returns us to\nconsciousness of self as subject:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one\u2019s bare\nconsciousness of self yields no knowledge of self.\n\n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s own work, he then put the idea of transcendental\ndesignation to work to explain how one can appear to oneself to be\nsubstantial, simple and persisting without these appearances reflecting\nhow one actually is. The reason that one appears in these ways is not\nthat the self is some strange, indefinable being. It is because of the\nkind of referring that we do to become conscious of oneself as subject.\nGiven how long ago he worked, Kant\u2019s insights into this kind of\nreferring are nothing short of amazing.\n",
