    "main_text": "Three Contributions || Thought\n4.2 Thought\n\nAs the last section made clear, Lotze made important contributions to\nthe emerging project of neo-Kantian epistemology, including the new\nconcept of validity (as detached and detachable from questions of\npsychological origin). Further, in his Logic, Lotze included\nmuch that would normally be considered under the separate heading of\n\u2018epistemology\u2019. Yet Lotze resolutely refused the mantle of\n\u201cthe theory of knowledge\u201d for a simple but compelling\nreason: what went under that title in the 1850s and 1860s was a\npsycho-physiological investigation, for some early figures in the\nneo-Kantian revival (prominently, Helmholtz and Lange) construed the\nM\u00fcllerian doctrine of \u201cspecific nerve energies\u201d as\nproof positive of the Kantian emphasis on the contributions of\ntranscendental subjectivity in our apprehension of objects. Lotze\ncontinuously rebuffed such associations. If \u201ctheory of\nknowledge\u201d named a psychological investigation, then validity\nwould be subordinated to \u201cthe history of the psychological\ndevelopment of our thought\u201d (Phil, p. 467). But\npsychology was to be counted \u201clast\u201d and not\n\u201cfirst\u201d in epistemic priority and it \u201ccan never be\nthe foundation of our whole philosophy\u201d (ibid., p.\n468).\n\nAccordingly, many subsequent philosophers both recognized and credited\nLotze with helping to make some of the earliest forays against the\nlooming spectre of psychologism (cf. Heidegger, 2000, p. 29ff). Most\ncritical here is, perhaps, Lotze\u2019s act-content distinction (cf.\nMicro, II, 630), one which followed Herbart, but preceded\nBrentano by decades. Furthermore, concept-formation is conceived to be\na logical process over and above the mere psychological course of our\nideas (further discussed below). Also, Lotze clearly opposed the\npan-logicist deduction of Absolute Idealism with something\napproximating the regressive analysis favored by the subsequent\nneo-Kantians: \u201cthe more urgent and the greater work of\nphilosophy must, I think, bear the shape of a regressive investigation\nwhich seeks to discover and to fix securely what principle is to be\nrecognised and used as the living principle in the construction and\ncourse of the world\u201d (Phil, p. 452). Discovery of\ntruths of absolute and universal validity describes the a\npriori project Lotze first adumbrated, later embraced in the\nlogicist program of his student Frege and in varieties of\ntranscendentalism espoused by various neo-Kantians.\n\nAs just mentioned, concept-formation is freed from the peculiarities\nof the subjective psychological process by concentration on the\ncreation and refining of objective thought contents. This logical\nprocess may proceed by reference to the \u201cgrammatical\u201d\ncategories of substantive, adjective and verb that may be taken to\n\u201cmirror\u201d the logical categories of object, concept and\nrelation, respectively. As it has been explained, this picture allows\nfor both an act-content distinction and the minimal structure required\nto get our metaphysics off the ground:\n\nThe three logical forms thus indicate the minimum amount of structure\nwe must presuppose in order to come to any deeper understanding of\nreality. That is, one must minimally posit: (i) things, which serve as\n\u201cfixed points\u201d which may support and to which we may\nappend (ii) dependent properties, \u2026 which may connect or relate\nto other such \u201cfixed points\u201d by means of (iii) relations\n\u2026 [further] [b]y naming part of our sensory-manifold, we\nseparate out that part and make it a content which can be grasped by\nothers. (Sullivan, 1991, p. 260)\n\n\nIn this way, Lotze made headway and yet, ironically, appeared\nretrograde to those who came after, those who found little comfort in\nthe seeming correspondence of grammar and thought-contents.\nNevertheless Lotze\u2019s actual contributions to the emergence of\nSprachphilosophie are typically unappreciated, if not ignored\naltogether. This is strange for although, by mid-century, many\ndifferent theoretic approaches to the study of language were\navailable, Lotze is undoubtedly the most important of the mainstream\nacademic philosophers to turn his attention to this topic. In his\nMicrocosmus, Lotze devoted numerous pages to the connection\nhe hoped to help establish, that between language and thought. A\nnumber of his important consideration and conclusions will be\nsummarized and discussed in what follows. (For a further discussion of\nsome of these points, particularly in relation to Frege, see Sullivan,\n1991.)\n\nFirst, Lotze denies that language is primarily a phonemic enterprise,\ninsisting instead that there is a dual dependence between language and\nthought: language cannot exist without there being meanings\n[Bedeutungen] correlated to its words and yet thought also\nrelies directly upon the syntactic abilities of a given natural\nlanguage to provide the basic form by which apprehension may take\nplace. For this reason, language cannot be portrayed as emerging as a\nspecies of \u201cventing,\u201d designed only to communicate bodily\npassions and excite animal sympathies. Language too is an inadequate\nexpression of our thought and in our actual speech we omit much,\nrelying on the abilities of our hearers to reconstruct that which is\nnot explicitly expressed in words. Likewise, for effective\ncommunication, much is dependent upon such things as gestures,\nemphases, and other modulations of voice. But Lotze remained immovable\non his central motif: \u201cthe peculiar nature of thought and the\nvery close connection between it and language\u201d (Micro,\nI, 619).\n\nFor Lotze, the merely accidental associations of ideas do\nnot\u2014and cannot\u2014constitute thought. The animal mind is\ncapable of linking associations but it can neither explain nor justify\nthese perceived connections (for instance, on the basis of an\nobjectively valid law). Thought is dependent in its architectonic on a\ncertain process of formation to occur so that \u201cbuilding\u201d\ncan begin. As construction cannot begin with a mere \u201cpile of\nstones,\u201d there first must be a process of \u201ccutting and\nshaping\u201d so that the basic elements of thought may be properly\n\u201cfitted together,\u201d forming interlocking pieces:\n\u201cLanguage exhibits this first operation of thought in the\ndistinction of its parts of speech\u201d (Micro, I, p. 622)\nand the three forms of substantive, adjective, and verb compose\n\u201cthe minimum of organization and division of presented matter\nwith which thought can attempt to begin its operations\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 623). Furthermore, this syntactic organization\nis the very element that gives \u201csignificance\u201d to our\nwords:\n\nNow this is what we signified above as the peculiar function through\nwhich the significant sound really becomes a word; for it is not made\nsuch by its significance; on the contrary, the interjections which\nmost purely and directly express psychic excitement form an\nunorganized residue of the material of language. The sound becomes\na word by means of the logical accessory thoughts displayed in the\ncharacter of the parts of speech; they serve as uniting surfaces\nand joints for the various contents, which thus become capable of\nsyntactic combination in the service of thought (ibid., my\nemphases).\n\n\nThus, to reiterate again, the three linguistic forms of substantive,\nadjective, and verb are required to express thought\u2019s\napprehension of (independent) objects, (dependent) properties, and\nrelations (respectively). And for such formative purposes, syntax is\ncritical, not sound. This is because \u201cthought cannot directly\nmake use of sensations, feelings, moods, simple or complex images, as\nmaterials for its structure\u201d (Micro, I, p. 622).\n\nNevertheless, and despite the multiple riches of linguistic\nexpression, grammatical syntax often falls short of logical structure\n(\u201cmay lag behind its logical articulation\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 624)). Indeed, linguistic form is responsible\nboth for a certain superstition and a mythology being imported into\nhuman thinking. The first (superstition) occurs because the very\nprocess of naming seems to bestow a quality on reality that is, in\npoint of fact, quite possibly lacking:\n\nThe sound of the name seems to dispel \u2026 obscurity, though it\nadds nothing to the content\u2014does not even always bring the light\nimplied in indicating the particular place belonging to the object in\na series, or within the sphere of some wider notion. Young botanists\ndelight in learning the Latin names of wayside flowers, and go\ncontented on their way only to be presently disturbed by a mountain\nthat, strange to say, has no name, and so has properly speaking no\nright to be there. Now, what do they miss in the one case? What did\nthey gain in the other? I cannot look on this fancy as so\ninsignificant as it appears\u2014nay, I see in it a counterpart or\ncontinuation of the genuinely human mode of conception \u2026 We are\nnot satisfied with the perception of an object; its existence becomes\nlegitimate only when it forms part of a regular system of things that\nhas its own significance apart from our perception (Micro, I,\np. 627).\n\n\nAs a result, for Lotze, an arbitrarily given name is, in fact, no name\nat all: a mere \u201cname\u201d is utterly insufficient. What is\nrequired is for that name to provide \u201cevidence of its having\nbeen received into the world of the universally known and\nrecognised\u201d (Micro, I, p. 628). While remaining\nsomewhat obscure, it should now be apparent, as in the earlier remarks\nabout \u201crace,\u201d that the mere enumeration of terminology is\nsurely not sufficient for this larger requirement.\n\nWe go well beyond mere superstition into a full blown mythology,\nhowever, once we add in the fact that language has a history and,\nthus, has accumulated, over time, a large reserve of possible\nexpressions including those made possible by what Lotze dubs\n\u201cthe syntactic pliability of language\u201d (ibid.).\nConsequently, even utter nonsense can deceive us by means of the\nsurface correctness of its grammatical form. The prime candidates here\nare those expressions which emerge by means of the nominalization of\npredicates. For example,\n\n\u2026 we have almost ceased to speak of beautiful objects,\ni.e., we forget that what we call beautiful is\noriginally a mere adjective determination not existing apart from a\nsubject; we speak now of the Beautiful, or at best of\nBeauty, and our aesthetic thinkers are quite convinced that\nwhat can exist only as an attribute is correctly apprehended only when\nit has unnaturally been apprehended as something substantive which is\neverywhere identical (Micro, I, p. 629).\n\n\nIt thus appears that Lotze is among those figures who diagnosis\ncircumstances where logical form ought not to follow\n(\u201cmodel\u201d) grammatical syntax, despite the undeniable work\nthat grammar makes possible for thought:\n\nIn all \u2026 [such] cases language creates for us a mythology, from\nwhich, of course, in the use of language we can never wholly set\nourselves free without becoming pedantically precise, but against the\ninfluence of which on the moulding of our thoughts we ought to be\ncarefully on our guard. Logic does not always assist us in this\ndirection, nay, sometimes in its methods makes pernicious concessions\nto this false tendency arising from the use of language\n(Micro, I, p. 630).\n\n\nUnlike Frege, however, Lotze sees little prospect for a logic freed\nfrom the constraints of linguistic syntax. Further, because Lotze\nfigures mathematical logic as contiguous with the Leibnizian project\nof a lingua characteristica, his doubts about the latter\nextend to the former, which he dubs the \u201clogical\ncalculus.\u201d This new symbolism\u2014e.g., the Boolean expression\nof universal affirmative judgements with \u201cy =\nvx\u201d\u2014is only \u201can ineffectual indication of\nwhat we knew before\u201d (Log, p. 276). In his eyes, the\nLeibnizian project entailed the search for a logical language which\nwould provide \u201ca universal mode of characterizing\nconceptions\u201d (ibid., p. 272). But Lotze\u2019s\nepistemological holism focused on the judgement, and its ultimate\nderivation from a priori principles, rather than the analysis\nof conceptual content. Furthermore, as just mentioned, Lotze\u2019s\nanalysis of content may be easily exhausted in a quasi-grammatical\nanalysis and precludes, of course, a more complex construal involving,\nsay, quantification and other second-order functions. (It is important\nto note, however, his introduction of a functional notation for the\nanalysis of the relation of part-concepts.)\n\nNow despite his rejection of symbolic logic as an unfruitful and\nunnecessary novelty, Lotze nonetheless held fast to the existence of\n\u201cnecessary laws of thought\u201d as the strongest bulwark\nagainst relativistic skepticism. Indeed, the various kinds of\nskepticism, whatever there other differences, share a fatal flaw: they\nall must articulate a possible standard of truth and the very same\ntime that they deny or demur the actual existence of such truth.\nLikewise, objections that such laws have only \u201csubjective\nvalidity\u201d (i.e., are valid only for us) and, hence, inadequate\napproximations of the external world presuppose some realist thesis\n(about the nature and existence of the external world) that has not\nyet been established (cf. Foster, 1882, pp. 43ff). Accordingly, Lotze\nmust refuse the charms of any correspondence theory of truth and\nembrace, in their stead, a variant of the coherence theory. However,\nalthough coherence is a relation that is descriptive of ideal\nthought-contents, we must not expect that coherence entails the\npossibility of a completely coherent world-picture being graspable by\nany particular human knower. Hence, the laws of coherence are ideal\nlaws of thought and philosophy must disclaim all ambition of arriving\nat a consummate and perfect system.\n4.3 Existence\n\nOnce we abandon the project of further articulating relations between\nworld and idea, as adumbrated in the preceding section, however, we\nmight appear to be stymied by charges of vicious\n\u201ccircularity\u201d once we refuse to go outside the sphere of\nour own presentations. Lotze acknowledges this \u201ccircle\u201d\nbut deems it unavoidable:\n\nThe circle is inevitable, so we had better perpetrate it with out eyes\nopen; the first thing we have to do is to endeavour to establish what\nmeaning it is possible for us to attach to knowledge in its widest\nsense, and what sort of relation we can conceive to subsist between\nthe subject which knows, and the object of its knowledge, consistently\nwith those yet more general notions which determine the mode in which\nwe have to conceive the operation of anything whatever upon anything\nelse. What we have to do is to obtain the last-mentioned conception,\nwhich amounts to a metaphysical doctrine, and to treat the relation of\nsubject and object as subordinate to it. (Log., p. 451)\n\n\nWhat is needed, within logic, is to concern ourselves with the general\na priori structures of human cognition (for it is this\ninvestigation that leads one ineluctably to the existence of certain\ngeneral yet necessary truths, which must frame our entire\nepistemological enterprise). This transcendental project is, however,\nsubordinate to one constraint: a metaphysical system which can limit\nand constrain the realm of the possible which might make up our circle\nof ideas. Hence, we come ineluctably to the concept of being.\n\nAny post-Kantian discussion of the relation of thought to being must\ncome to grips with Kant\u2019s rigid bifurcation between phenomenal\nappearance and noumenal reality. Of course, without strict adherence\nto this distinction, Kant\u2019s own position would collapse into\nBerkleyan phenomenalism. Accordingly, post-Kantians such as Herbart,\nwho wanted to maintain a strong realism, had to rethink this central\nfeature of Kantian metaphysics. But while Herbart maintained the\npossibility of some relation between noumena and phenomena, Lotze went\nfurther in dissociating the two; hence, Lotze was led to oppose, as\nwell, the notion of a single unchangeable substance lying at the base\nof the thing and constituting its essence. Accordingly, phenomenal\nproperties, which say nothing about the true nature of a thing, say\neverything about our peculiar capacity of perception. Yet Lotze\nassumed that changes at the phenomenal level must reflect changes at\nthe noumenal and he persisted in the belief that although appearance\nis not like reality it does, nevertheless, provide knowledge of\nreality. And so, he mustered adherence to Herbart\u2019s realist\nstandpoint while rejecting all correlative claims about the\nimmutability of substance (cf. Santayana, 1971, pp. 152ff). Our only\nconclusion must be Santayana\u2019s: \u201c\u2026 although he\nretains the word substance he abandons the notion for which it\ncommonly stands\u201d (Santayana, 1971, p. 153). Hence, we might be\ntempted to see Lotze as inaugurating the reign of the\nFunktionsbegriff over the Substanzbegriff (cf.,\nCassirer, 1923).\n\nAdditionally, the notion of being favored by Kant (and his realistic\ndisciple Herbart) rested in the belief that the meaning of existence\nsimpliciter could by captured in the formulation\n\u201cabsolute position.\u201d As this standpoint has been\nencapsulated:\n\nThe Herbartian view is indicated in the notion of \u2018pure\nbeing\u2019 as Setzung: that \u2018what we call the true\nBeing should be found only in pure \u201cposition,\u201d void of\nrelation\u2019. In fact, on this view, it is only because pure being\nlacks relation that existing things are able to enter into relations\nat all. Herbart concludes that reality is composed of something\nplural, simple and indestructible: what he called \u2018the\nReals\u2019. Since reality is compounded of substances that can\nsuffer no change, and are hence immutable, the relations (into which\nthings \u2018enter in\u2019) must be utterly external and\naccidental. (Sullivan, 1998, p. 841)\n\n\nLotze rejects this portrayal of reality composed of simple\nunchangeable substances for, first, the concept of\n\u2018position\u2019 ascribed to them is meaningless in\nabstracto and, second, utterly dependent upon the correlative\nnotion of \u2018relation\u2019; conceptual relations are a creation\nof our thought, which stipulates a connection between otherwise\ndivergent individual things. Subsequently it has no more claim to\nreality than spatiality, for it too simply implicates a mere\nform of perception. Also, the na\u00efve conception of\nrelations as metaphysically primitive gives rise to numerous problems\nof infinite regress (cf. Robins, 1900, pp. 88\u201389). In its place,\nLotze substituted for this creation of pure thought a kind of\nlinguistic contextualism: instead of affirmation of a particular\nconcept, affirming, as an act, belongs to \u201cnothing but a\nproposition in which the content of the notion is brought into\nrelation with that of another\u201d (Micro, II, p. 582).\nNotably, the contrasting conceptual folly has a metaphysical analogue,\nthe insistence that \u201c\u2026 things must be, before they can\nstand in the relations in which indeed alone their reality can become\nperceptible to us\u201d (Micro, II, p. 583).\n5 Three Legacies\n5.1 Monism\n\nIt might be supposed\u2014wrongly\u2014that interest in Lotze cannot\nbe justified except on historical or antiquarian grounds. And, of\ncourse, if combined with a Quinean attitude, enforcing a divergence\nbetween the history of philosophy and philosophy proper, Lotze could\nbe dismissed without even a further thought. However, such objections\nmight be blunted if it can be shown that the work of Lotze continues\nto influence contemporary thought, albeit in a disguised, even\nunderground fashion, through the thought of those thinkers who came\nafter him. Lotze\u2019s main (and enduring) contributions are\nevidenced in the emergence of what others have dubbed \u201cthe\nneo-Kantian paradigm\u201d. This philosophical approach (composed by\nparts of orientation, attitude and technique) provides the shared\nbackdrop against which the analytic-continental split emerges.\nParticularly important for both Frege and Husserl, Lotze\u2019s\ninfluence extends, partly via the British Idealists (see Sullivan,\n2008), to Russell, Moore, and Carnap, on the analytic side of the\nequation, as already noted in the Preface.\n\nMost of these continued influences remain unacknowledged, even\nsubterranean. And it is only possible to isolate a few of them here.\nBeginning with the most obvious, Lotze, via the British Idealists,\nenriched the concept of the Absolute in a number of interesting ways.\nThis can be shown if we further investigate two key aspects of\nLotze\u2019s metaphysics: how his functionalist approach entails\nboth, on the one hand, monism and, on the other, a sort of\ninstrumentalism.\n\nLotze seeks to finess the problem of causality\u2014in its relation\nto the phenomena/noumena distinction\u2014by replacing it with the\nnotion of ground, or logical consequence. He is led to this conception\nby, among other things, the difficulties associated with the notion of\nmetaphysical or transeunt causality. As he framed it, the\nproblem was: if there were many separate, independently existing\nthings, then there is no credible account forthcoming about how any\nsingle given thing may causally interact with any other single given\nthing. Further, Lotze\u2019s solution aims at, once again, making\nsense of the process of our thinking and not explicating any supposed\nrelation of mind and world. Hence, he insists that the very\nindispensability of cause and effect in human cognition entails a\nnecessary rejection of metaphysical pluralism: we must abandon\n\u201cour preconceived idea that they [i.e., things] are originally\nmany and self-existent, and \u2026 [instead adopt] the view that\nthere is a truly existent being m \u2026 [and that] this\nm is the ground and basis of all individual beings\na, b, c, \u2026\u201d (OutRel,\np. 39).\n\nLotze therefore utilizes Humean-style arguments, without thereby\nconcurring with Humean conclusions (in particular Hume\u2019s radical\npsychologism). If Hume dissolved causality into a mental\npredisposition\u2014a psychological expectation of\nuniformity\u2014then Lotze reduced it, instead, to the efficient\ncausality found in a regularly occurring sequence, which expresses a\nrule or law. Hence, while it makes no sense to inquire into the deeper\nbases of causality, there remains, nonetheless, plenty of work to do;\nfor while it is utterly \u201cidle\u201d to \u201clook for the\nreason of that causality\u201d (Santayana, 1971, p.190) yet,\nnonetheless,\n\n\u2026 [t]o note and describe sequences is all we can do in such a\ncase; the ground for these sequences is simply the nature of the given\nthing, which is nothing but the law which those sequences exemplify\nand actualize. We have no business to ask for any further ground for\nthese sequences; they are the nature of things. All we can do is\nreconcile our will and imagination to this given and unexplained\norder, by showing that it gives rise to aesthetic and moral values.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nThis commitment to explaining the given by reference to ultimate\nvalues has a number of important ramifications for the unfolding of\nLotze\u2019s metaphysics. First, as there cannot be a plurality of\nmutually distinct, independently existing things, we must encourage a\nmonistic conception. Recall the aforementioned issue of how thing\na (if such existed) might causally interact with thing\nb (ditto). James provides the most admirable gloss of\nLotze\u2019s manner of reply:\n\nThe multiple independent things cannot be real in that shape, but all\nof them, if reciprocal action is to be possible between them, must be\nregarded as parts of a single real being, M. The pluralism\nwith which our view began has to give place to a monism; and the\n\u2018transeunt\u2019 interaction, being unintelligible as such, is\nto be understood as an immanent operation.\n\n\nThe words \u2018immanent operation\u2019 seem here to mean that the\nsingle real being M, of which a and b are\nmembers, is the only thing that changes, and that when it changes, it\nchanges inwardly and all over at once. When part a in it\nchanges, consequently, part b must also change, but without\nthe whole M changing this would not occur. (James, 1977, p.\n31)\n\n\nOf course, James himself strongly repudiated this argument and its\nconclusion, painting the former as verbal sophistry. But for Lotze\nthis conclusion was inevitable if the universe and its elements were\nto be properly conceptualized as \u201ca unity\u201d or\nkosmos (i.e., an aesthetic demand).\n\nSecond, things (and their posited but unproven existence) remain\nnothing but \u201cideas indispensable for the intelligibility of the\nchangeable phenomenal world\u201d (Micro, II, p. 584). The\nsubject of metaphysics is reality but reality only as it can be made\nintelligible to human knowers. Also, there are limits and paradoxes\ninvolved in our previous commitment to \u201cthis absolute existence\nwhich we symbolise as m\u201d (OutRel, p. 40). Beyond its\noneness and existence we cannot\u2014from within\nmetaphysics\u2014go. The \u2018absolute\u2019 thus functions as\n\u201ca limiting conception\u201d (ibid., p. 41).\nFurthermore, metaphysics has no intrinsic method for support and, in\nparticular, is not preceded by epistemology. In this way, among\nothers, Lotze\u2019s metaphysics attempted to chart a middle course,\none set somewhere between the absolute idealism of Hegel and his\nfollowers, on the one hand, and the critical realism of Herbart and\nhis disciples, on the other. But, most importantly, it attempted to\ncarve out the requisite space for a conception that seemed\nnaturalistic in its assumptions but which was wedded to the idealist\nnotion of \u201cunity\u201d that was founded in self-consciousness\nor personality, whether this be attained by the philosopher-scientist\nalone or as supported by the continued consciousness of God.\n\nAs we have just seen, Lotze\u2019s monism\u2014or his belief in the\nsubstantial unity of everything that exists\u2014stands opposed to\nHerbart\u2019s earlier pluralistic atomism. His redescription of\ncausality likewise coheres with his prior conviction that there must\nexist a human soul endowed with freedom of the will. Correlatively,\nLotze encourages us to think of the world as the product of the will\nof God, of an infinite spirit: reality is, hence, that which\ncorresponds to (a) self-consciousness. But is this particular\nself-consciousness or spirit\u2014which we may identify with the\nabsolute\u2014also personal in nature? Our first impulse yields a\nnegative response simply because personality normally is associated\nwith the notion of fixed limits (which would, of course, be\ninappropriate in an infinite, unlimited being). And yet, Lotze\ncontends that we must conceive of God as the preeminent personality\nand so, once again, God\u2019s own personality is \u201can immediate\ncertainty,\u201d grasped only as a necessity of the human mind. And,\nhence, we come to the concept of personality.\n\nThe reduction of cognition, emotion and volition to values was to fit\nhand-in-hand with other thinkers\u2019 preoccupation with the spectre\nof relativism. So although Lotze himself took refuge in a\nquasi-Platonic account, some neo-Kantians pushed farther in the\nattempt to ground value in some account of the nature of consciousness\nitself. Windleband, for example, developed the notion of a\n\u201cnormal [i.e., normative] consciousness,\u201d which\nis to say a consciousness that was itself productive of norms or\nvalues. The further particulars here must await another occasion. But\nSchn\u00e4delbach\u2019s observations of a fundamental shift from\nLotze\u2019s to Windelband\u2019s position\u2014or, from a\n\u201cteleological value\u2014relevance of reality \u2026 as a\nrelation of transcendental constitution in which value stood to\nvaluation\u201d to one which emphasized \u201cthe evaluating normal\nconsciousness \u2026 [as] the basis of both axiology and\nontology\u201d (cf. Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 182)\u2014surely\ncalls out for a detailed investigation in the near future.\n5.2 Persons\n\nWhile the centrality of \u2018person\u2019 stands in most natural\naffinity with the name of Kant, the idea undergoes a number of\ncritical developments in the various strands of post-Kantian idealism.\nOn the one hand, Kant had relied on personality in distinguishing\nrational being from mere things, by reference to the former\u2019s\ncapacity for self-government or autonomy. Further, Kant had insisted\nthat persons have \u201cworth\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d and that\nthis serves as a critical characteristic separating them from mere\nthings (which may be said to have only a \u201cprice\u201d). On the\nother, the scientific approach, when applied directly to human beings,\nappear to have rendered the notion of personality incomprehensible and\nsuperfluous. (Indeed, Lotze would probably not be at all surprised by\nthe threat posed to personal identity resulting from reflection on the\nquantum theory!). Also, if Christianity is re-described as an ethical\nreligion\u2014stressing the essential aspects of interior life and,\nhenceforth, abandoning all claims to metaphysical or cosmological\nsignificance\u2014then it cannot stand simply as a bulwark against\nthe materialist onslaught on inessential aspects of our\nsubjectivity.\n\nAgainst these and similar considerations Lotze argued that our own\nsubjectivity is not founded in opposition to objectivity: the subject\n(the \u2018I\u2019) is not opposed and formed in reaction to the\nobject (the \u2018not-I\u2019) but rather in its encounter with\nanother subject (a \u2018thou\u2019) (OutRel, pp. 65ff).\nConsequently, personality is an ethical concept par\nexcellance and is, qua ethical, identifiable as the\n\u201cultimate reality.\u201d Of course we cannot identify the world\nwith our own subjective consciousness without falling into either\nsolipsism or subjective idealism. Hence, we arrive, instead, at the\nnecessary conclusion of objective idealism. Lotze\u2019s view\nSantayana aptly encapsulates as follows:\n\nThe seat of the value of the world is consciousness, but of course not\nexclusively human consciousness. These moments that contain the sense\nof things, the consciousness of the cosmic law,\u2014those in fact\nthat contain the personality of cosmic life\u2014contain also its\nvalue, and the happiness to which it gives rise. To us the divine life\nis revealed in beauty, in our own seasons of happiness, and our faith\nin the deep roots that good has in nature. Our consciousness, however,\nconstitutes but an echo of that consciousness in which the purpose of\nthe world is realized; the goal of things is the happiness of\nGod\u2026. (Santayana, 1971, p. 223)\n\n\nReality is purposive and its contents collectively form an ideal unity\nand this conclusion is fostered by an awareness of the view of the\nworld comprised sub specie aeternitatis in the nature of\nsupreme consciousness.\n\nFurther, Lotze\u2019s peculiar investigations into morality provide\nyet another case study in Lotzean dialectic. Moral rules cannot be\nunderstood as merely prudential maxims or as essentially\nself-regarding in nature: moral principles must possess an\n\u201cintrinsic worth.\u201d However, this fact should not\ncapitulate us into either a mystical or religious position, on the one\nhand, or the \u201cempty formalism\u201d of Kantianism, on the\nother. For both utilitarians and egoists are so far right when they\ninsist upon the necessary presence of pleasure and pain (as concrete\ncontent) in moral deliberation. But to escape such subjective egoism\nin morality is possible only if we shift our perspective by changing\n\u201cour conception of our personality and its position in the\nworld\u201d (OutRel, p. 159). Characteristically, our\nuntutored convictions suggest the idea that moral laws express and\nembody the will of God. To escape the subsequent\nEuthyphro-style questions and difficulties, we must identify\nGod with the supreme Good:\n\nGod is nothing else than that will whose purport and mode of action\ncan be conceived of in our reflection as that which is good in\nitself\u2014as a will which can only be separated by abstraction from\nthe living form in which it exists in the real God. (ibid.,\np. 161)\n\n\nLikewise our will expresses its moral nature in the ability to freely\nchoose between competing values, without compulsion. But this choice\nis always rooted in a concrete reality\u2014our\nfeeling, for instance, that truth is rightfully to be pursued\nbecause it is good.\n\nAs already noted, by means of his enduring presence in liberal\nProtestant thought and literature, Lotze continued to be a topic of\ninterest even in post-war American theological schools and seminaries.\nIndeed, through the impress of \u201cpersonalism,\u201d\nLotze\u2019s thought\u2014handed down through Bowne and\nBrightman\u2014appears to have imposed upon Martin Luther King the\nconception of a personal god and the metaphysical underpinnings for an\ninsistence upon the \u201cdignity and worth\u201d of all\n\u201chuman personality.\u201d But this underscores the\nunacknowledged fact that it is Lotze, and not Kant, that is the most\nlikely source of King\u2019s insistence on the dignity of the human\nperson (cf. Burrow, 1999, pp. 76ff).\n\nLikewise, Lotze\u2019s contributions to the topic of polygenesis,\nwith its obvious consequences for projects of scientific racism, may\nhelp explain Lotze\u2019s line of influence, extending through the\nhistory of African American philosophy, beginning with Du Bois\u2019\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903). While \u201cfolk\u201d has\nobvious Herderian overtones, for \u201csoul\u201d Du Bois would have\ndrawn more naturally on Lotze, under the tutelage of McCosh and James\n(cf. Rampersad, 1990, p. 74). In point of fact, it appears that it is\none of Lotze\u2019s leading ideas that provides a key impetus to Du\nBois cultural project.\n\nDu Bois practices modernist collage, invariably beginning each chapter\nof his work with an excerpt of lyric, drama or poetry, combined with\nbars of musical notation from what he dubs \u201cthe Sorrow\nSongs.\u201d Through this simple act of ostension, Du Bois directly\nposits the cultural parity of European American and African American\nculture, even as he is at pains to voice his revolutionary\nassertion:\n\nWe the darker ones come even now not altogether empty-handed:\u2026\nhere is no true American music but the wild sweet melodies of the\nNegro slave; the American fairy tales and folk-lore are Indian and\nAfrican;\u2026 Will America be poorer if she replace\u2026 her\nvulgar music with the soul of the Sorrow Songs? (Du Bois, 1903, pp.\n11\u201312).\n\n\nLittle of beauty has America given the world save the rude grandeur\nGod himself stamped on her bosom; the human spirit in this new world\nhas expressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in beauty. And\nso by fateful chance the Negro folk-song\u2014the rhythmic cry of the\nslave\u2014stands to-day not simply as the sole American music, but\nas the most beautiful expression of human experience born this side\nthe seas. It has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised,\nand above all it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but\nnotwithstanding, it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage\nof the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people (Ibid., p.\n251).\n\n\nAfrican Americans had contributed mightily in the realm of art but\nlittle, to date, in thought or politics, for the obvious reasons. But\nLotze provided a metaphysical basis for equalizing and explaining such\ncontributions to human culture: as noted above, for Lotze, the human\nsoul (or human consciousness) is equally cognition, emotion, and\nvolition. Descartes was wrong: we are not just thinking things, but\nalso feeling and willing things.\n\nThis tripartite division was expressed by Lotze in numerous\nways\u2014sometimes as concept, feeling, and sensation or, at others,\nas ideas, emotions and aspirations [Strebungen]. While\nattention has focused quite naturally on Du Bois famous \u201cdouble\nconsciousness,\u201d he articulates this in the terminology of\nLotzean tripartition: \u201ctwo souls [emotions], two thoughts\n[cognition], two unreconciled strivings [volition]\u201d (Ibid., p.\n3). While \u201ctwoness\u201d in African Americans was a pernicious\n\u201cwaste\u201d (Ibid., p. 55) of energies, they shared equally\nwith European Americans in the human experience of\n\u201cmeaning\u2026 passion\u2026 and\u2026 struggle\u201d\n(Ibid., p. viii).\n\nThe very terminology (of Streben) points us to the centrality\nof Fichte for Lotze, a leitmotiv only suggested in the\nmargins of this entry till now. Although sometimes pegged as either an\nHegelian or Herbartian, Lotze is quite clear that Fichte\u2019s\ninfluence was the decisive one \u2014 \u201cThe teaching of Fichte\nhad been different\u201d:\n\nThe problem of the spirit, he held, does not lie in the cognition of a\nblind \u2018Being\u2019 (the conception of which appeared to him as\nimpossible as it appears to us), but in action. The aforesaid world\nexternal is not, but appears to us in order to serve as material of\nour duty, as inducement or object of our action (OutMet, p.\n150).\n\n\nThis is, of course, the well-known Fichtean subjugation of theoretical\nto practical reason. But Lotze believes that action here is\nmerely a formal concept and so he seeks the following emendation:\n\nFor the aforesaid \u2018action\u2019 of Fichte we substitute the\nmorally Good, for which the action is simply the indispensable form of\nactualization; we besides conceive of the \u2018beautiful,\u2019\ntoo, and the \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018blessedness,\u2019 as\nunited with this Good into one complex of all that has Value\n(OutMet, p. 151).\n\n\nThe \u2018morally good\u2019 [das sittlich-Gute] can only\nbe realized \u2014be actualized\u2014 through action of\npersons. Although all of the words used to describe the purpose\nof life\u2014including happiness or blessedness\u2014point us\ntowards a super-ordinate concept, that of the valuable, the focus\nrests squarely on the human person.\n\nBut are we now not confined within a realm of pure subjectivity,\n\u201csince all the Value of what is valuable has existence only in\nthe spirit that enjoys it\u201d (OutMet, p. 152)? Certainly\nnot.\n\nThe objectivity of our cognition consists, therefore, in this, that it\nis not a meaningless play of mere seeming; but it brings before us a\nWorld whose coherency is order in pursuance of the injunction of the\nSole Reality in the world,\u2014to wit, of the Good. Our cognition\nthus possesses more of truth than it copied exactly a world of objects\nthat has no value in itself. Although it does not comprehend in what\nmanner all that is phenomenon is presented to its view, still it\nunderstands what is the meaning of it all; and is like to a spectator\nwho comprehends the aesthetic significance of that which takes place\non the stage of a theatre, and would gain nothing essential if he were\nto see besides the machinery by means of which the changes are\neffected on that stage (ibid.).\n\n\nThe metaphysical claim here is clear even if not to contemporary\ntastes: the \u201cobjectivity of our cognition\u201d lies in the\nfact that it is not a meaningless game of mere appearance, but that it\npresents to us a world whose nexus is ordered in accordance with the\ncommandments of the only Real [Realen] in the world, the Good\n[des Guten]. And thus we come, inexorably, to value.\n5.3 Value Theory\n\nTo recapitulate, briefly: First, we must abandon the mere prejudice\nthat the external world exists complete and independent of our minds,\nand that our thinking is merely a \u201cuseless appendage\u201d\nwhich merely reproduces the contents of the world, as a fruitless\nactivity. Nor should we fall into the trap of absolute idealism, which\nso reduces the world of things that they can easily be fitted into the\nformal categories of our thinking (that is, reduce metaphysics to\nlogic). The right way was indicated by Fichte: our minds are not for\nthe mere cognitive reproduction of meaningless things, but rather a\n\u201cworld\u201d only appears to us in order to serve as a stage\ninducing us to meaningful action. But action characterizes only the\nsubjective side of things: on the other side, we must identify the\nmoral good, and our action becomes, hence, merely a means of realizing\nthis end.\n\nThe terminology of \u201cmoral good\u201d is thus shorthand for the\nentire complex of values (and, hence, can be identified with what\nearlier thinkers called the good, the beautiful, happiness, or\nblessedness). But although this apprehension of the world is dependent\nupon mind, it is not subjective. Instead, our cognition of the world\nand its value is objective: a world can only be a system of the truly\nreal, that is to say, a system ordered according to the good. For this\npurpose, we need not understand the mechanics of our cognition and,\nindeed, we would gain little from this knowledge, for the central\nthing is the apprehension of meaningfulness present to us in a world\nof mere physical objects.\n\nFinally, then we come to the subject of value and validity, which\ndescribes an immense topic.The following restricts itself to but one\nsmall part of the continental side, briefly discussing the case of\nHeidegger. Heidegger\u2019s long engagement with the Lotzean\nfoundations of his neo-Kantian teachers has not yet received\nwidespread acknowledgement (see, however, Crowell, 2001). The early\nHeidegger seemingly operated wholly within the neo-Kantian paradigm\nand even the first emergence of the phenomenological impulse was\ndirected, at least in part, at a reconceptualization of neo-Kantian\ntopics and questions. Especially revealing is the lecture course of\nSummer Semester 1919, which aimed at nothing less than \u201ca\nphenomenological critique of transcendental philosophy of value\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2000, p. 108). Thereby, Heidegger intended to utilize\nBrentano, Dilthey and Husserl, among others, to combat and reconstruct\nthe insights of Windelband, Rickert and Lask, on the one hand, and\nalso the Marburgers (and even Simmel), on the other. And the common\nroot of these heterogeneous schools and thinkers had to begin with\nLotze\u2019s decisive contribution (cf. ibid., pp.\n116\u2013118).\n\nAccording to Heidegger, in the midst of the nineteenth century two\nglobal errors emerged, only to attain prominence in philosophical\npractice of that day: naturalism and historicism. The only school that\navoided these two was \u201cspeculative theism\u201d and it was\nunder their influence that Lotze\u2019s breakthrough emerged: the\ndecisive repudiation of naturalism without falling into mere\n\u201chistory of philosophy.\u201d This was accomplished by\nLotze\u2019s revival of the non-sensory while avoiding \u201cthe\nextravagant naturalistic supra-sensoriness of the old\nmetaphysics\u201d (Heidegger, 2000, p. 117). In his articulation of a\nphilosophy of value, Lotze \u201ckilled two birds with one\nstone\u201d: \u201ca safeguarding of the continuity and connection\nwith German idealism, but simultaneously a critical deflection of\nspeculative idealism\u201d (ibid., p. 118). (But this\nassessment would not stand, for by the Nietzsche lectures (cf.\nHeidegger, 1977, esp. pp. 70ff) of 1936\u201340, Heidegger has come\nto believe that a reliance on the terminology of value and values was\nsimply the positivist version of the metaphysical (which was supposed\nto have been thoroughly vanquished) (cf. Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, pp.\n190f).)\n\nFurther substantiation of Heidegger\u2019s deep and continuing\nstruggle with Lotze (and the neo-Kantian paradigm he helped engender)\nis now available in English in the newly translated 1925/26 lecture\ncourse on Logic (Heidegger, 2010). Here Heidegger makes\nexplicit the exact same thesis, later elaborated by Gillian Rose,\nnamely that Lotze is indeed the founder of the paradigm so excellently\ndeveloped and exploited by the neo-Kantians: \u201cThe\n\u2018neo-Kantian paradigm\u2019 refers to those who attempted a new\nanswer to the Kantian questions of validity within the framework of\nvalidity and values first developed by Lotze\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n6). Coincident with this is a shift, by these later thinkers, to\nphilosophy as a kind of purified methodologism, a pure and general\n(but not at all formal) logic, directed towards a vision of\nscience \u201cas an ideal network of propositions\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2010, p. 50). By Heidegger\u2019s later lights, all of\nneo-Kantianism and much of Husserl was sharply inflected by this\n(unconscious) prejudice.\n\nWhile a fuller discussion of this interesting topic is not possible\nhere, some light is nevertheless shed by a brief consideration of the\ntwentieth-century reaction to neo-Kantianism, as found in the\nthought of (mostly) later thinkers (inter alia, Heidegger\nhimself):\n\nDilthey, Heidegger, Mannheim, Benjamin and Gadamer have this criticism\nin common: the neo-Kantian answers to the question of validity debase\nthe question of being, reality, life or history \u2026 [they] return\nto the Kantian question of validity, \u2018What are the preconditions\nof experience?\u2019, but judge that the Kantian reference to the\ncategories and their application itself has a precondition:\n\u2018life\u2019 (Dilthey), \u2018social-situation\u2019\n(Mannheim), \u2018Dasein\u2019 (Heidegger),\n\u2018history\u2019 (Gadamer). These become the presupposition of\nthe use of the categories or of meaning, the \u2018a\npriori\u2019 of a new kind of ontology (Rose, 1981, pp.\n22\u201323).\n\n\n(Note that from the analytic side, the emergence of concepts such as\n\u2018form of life\u2019 and \u2018ordinary language\u2019 may be\nseen to play similar roles.) As a consequence, whether continental (or\nanalytic) philosophy deserve the appellation of neo-neo-Kantianism\nremains an open question.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s rejection of Lotze and neo-Kantianism by means of a\nreturn to a more basic or primodial notion is quite explicit in the\nLogic lectures:\n\nLotze uses the word \u201cbeing\u201d as equivalent to\n\u201cout-there-ness,\u201d and therefore he uses\n\u201cbeing\u201d for sensible beings, material beings in the widest\nsense. I have already stressed that the currently common term\n\u201csensible entity\u201d does not characterize being\n[Sein], but only determines the way of apprehending being\n\u2026 I use \u201cbeing\u201d in the exact opposite sense, and in\nconnection with the genuine tradition of Greek philosophy broadly\nspeaking (Heidegger, 2010, p. 53).\n\n\n(A few pages later, Heidegger also makes clear where the necessary\nreturn in philosophy lies\u2014\u201cThe need to return to\nAristotle\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p. 90)\u2014with, of course, the\nimportant proviso that \u201c[t]he Greeks had no suspicion of this\nunfathomable problematic, which opens up before us once we have seen\nthis connection [between being and time]\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p.\n163).)\n\nUnfortunately, there are grounds for thinking that this turn to\nmetacritique\u2014i.e., the application of neo-Kantian style\ncriticism to neo-Kantianism (and its unacknowledged\npresuppositions)\u2014nevertheless, \u201cin spite of its radical\nintentions, remains within the paradigm of Geltung and cannot\nmake the transition to a speculative position\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n24). Instead, almost all the lines of thought, dominant in the\ntwentieth century, ultimately converge and terminate at \u201ca\nneo-Fichtean station\u201d (ibid.). And there, it appears, we\nremain.",
