    "main_text": "Challenges to EU theory || Unawareness\n5.3 Unawareness\n\nThere has been recent interest in yet a further challenge to expected\nutility theory, namely, the challenge from unawareness. In\nfact, unawareness presents a challenge for all extant normative\ntheories of choice. To keep things simple, we shall however focus on\nSavage\u2019s expected utility theory to illustrate the challenge\nposed by unawareness.\n\nAs the reader will recall, Savage takes for granted a set of possible\noutcomes \\(\\bO\\), and another set of possible states of the world\n\\(\\bS\\), and defines the set of acts, \\(\\bF\\), as the set of all\nfunctions from \\(\\bS\\) to \\(\\bO\\). Moreover, his representation\ntheorem has been interpreted as justifying the claim that a rational\nperson always performs the act in \\(\\bF\\) that maximises expected\nutility, relative to a probability measure over \\(\\bS\\) and a utility\nmeasure over \\(\\bO\\). \n\nNow, Savage\u2019s theory is neutral about how to interpret the\nstates in \\(\\bS\\) and the outcomes in \\(\\bO\\). For instance, the\ntheory is consistent with interpreting \\(\\bS\\) and \\(\\bO\\) as\nrespectively the sets of all logically possible states and\noutcomes, but it is also consistent with interpreting \\(\\bS\\) and\n\\(\\bO\\) as respectively the sets of states and outcomes that some\nmodeller recognises, or the sets of states and outcomes that\nthe decision-maker herself recognises. \n\nIf the theory is meant to describe the reasoning of a decision-maker,\nthe first two interpretations would seem inferior to the third. The\nproblem with the first two interpretations is that the decision-maker\nmight be unaware of some of the logically possible states and\noutcomes, as well as some of the states and outcomes that the modeller\nis aware of. (Having said that, one may identify the states and\noutcomes that the agent is unaware of by reference to those of which\nthe modeller is aware.)\n\nWhen it comes to (partially) unaware decision-makers, an important\ndistinction can be made between on the one hand what we might call\n\u201cunawareness of unawareness\u201d\u2014that is, a situation\nwhere a decision-maker does not realise that there might be some\noutcome or state that they are unaware of\u2014and on the other hand\n\u201cawareness of unawareness\u201d\u2014that is, a situation\nwhere a decision-maker at least suspects that there is some outcome or\nstate of which they are unaware. \n\nFrom the perspective of decision-making, unawareness of unawareness is\nnot of much interest. After all, if one is not even aware of the\npossibility that one is unaware of some state or outcome, then that\nunawareness cannot play any role in one\u2019s reasoning about what\nto do. However, decision-theoretic models have been proposed for how a\nrational person responds to growth in awareness (that is\nmeant to apply even to people who previously were unaware of their\nunawareness). In particular, economists Karni and Vier\u00f8 (2013,\n2015) have recently extended standard Bayesian conditionalisation to\nsuch learning events. Their theory, Reverse Bayesianism,\ninformally says that awareness growth should not affect the ratios of\nprobabilities of the states/outcomes that the agent was aware of\nbefore the growth. Richard Bradley (2017) defends a similar principle\nin the context of the more general Jeffrey-style framework, and so\ndoes Roussos (2020); but the view is criticised by Steele and\nStef\u00e1nsson (forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b) and by Mahtani\n(forthcoming).\n\nIn contrast, awareness of unawareness would seem to be of great\ninterest from the perspective of decision-making. If you suspect that\nthere is some possible state, say, that you have not yet entertained,\nand some corresponding outcome, the content of which you are unaware,\nthen you might want to at least come to some view about how likely you\nexpect this state to be, and how good or bad you expect the\ncorresponding outcome to be, before you make a decision.\n\nA number of people have suggested models to represent agents who are\naware of their unawareness (e.g., Walker & Dietz 2013, Piermont\n2017, Karni & Vier\u00f8 2017). Steele and Stef\u00e1nsson\n(forthcoming-b) argue that there may not be anything especially\ndistinctive about how a decision-maker reasons about states/outcomes\nof which she is aware she is unaware, in terms of the confidence she\nhas in her judgments and how she manages risk. That said, the way she\narrives at such judgments of probability and desirability is worth\nexploring further. Grant and Quiggin (2013a, 2013b), for instance,\nsuggest that these judgments are made based on induction from past\nsituations where one experienced awareness growth.\n\nIn general, the literature on unawareness has been rapidly growing.\nBradley (2017) and Steele and Stef\u00e1nsson (forthcoming-b) are\nnew in-depth treatments of this topic within philosophy. Schipper\nmaintains a bibliography on unawareness, mostly with papers in\neconomics and computer science, at\n\\url{http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/unaw.htm}. \n",
