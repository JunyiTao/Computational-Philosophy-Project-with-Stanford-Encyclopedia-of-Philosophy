This\nliterature aims at addressing the conceptualization of delusional\nexperience and delusional belief in the wider context of psychiatric\nresearch and clinical practice. General debates in the philosophy of\npsychiatry are often applied to delusions more specifically, such as\nwhether delusions are natural kinds (e.g., Samuels 2009), and whether\nthey are pathological beliefs (e.g., Fulford 2004; Bortolotti\n2020).\n\nFor authors who claim that delusions are pathological, there are at\nleast six possible (non-exclusive) answers to what makes delusions\npathological:\n\n\n\nDelusions are pathological because they present themselves as what\nthey are not. They resemble beliefs but do not share some of the core\nfeatures of beliefs such as action guidance, and are irrational to a\nhigher degree than, or in a qualitatively different way from,\nirrational beliefs (for a discussion of aspects of this view, see\nCurrie and Jureidini 2001 and Frankish 2009). \n\n\nDelusions are pathological because they are signs that we inhabit a\nfictional, non-actual reality and no longer share some fundamental\nbeliefs and practices with the people around us (for distinct versions\nof this view, see Stephens and Graham 2004 and 2006; Sass 1994;\nGallagher 2009; Rhodes and Gipps 2008). \n\n\nDelusions are pathological because they are puzzling and unsettling.\nThey defy folk-psychological expectations. This also makes it\ndifficult for an interpreter to rationalize and understand our\nbehavior when we report delusions (versions of this idea are explored\nin Campbell 2001 and Murphy 2012). \n\n\nDelusions are pathological because (differently from many\nnondelusional and yet irrational beliefs) they negatively affect our\nwellbeing impairing functioning and causing social isolation\nand withdrawal (see Garety and Freeman 1999 for a multidimensional\naccount of delusions; Bolton 2008 for a harm-related account of mental\nillness in general; Pierre 2020 for differences between beliefs in\nconspiracy theories and delusions). \n\n\nDelusions are pathological because they have forensic implications,\nthat is, implications for judgements about whether we can be held\nlegally accountable for our actions. Hohwy and Rajan 2012 argue that\ndelusions are attributed to us when others notice significant\nimpairments in our decision-making and autonomy. Miyazono 2015 claims\nthat our responsibility-grounding capacities are compromised when we\nhave delusions. \n\n\nDelusions are pathological because of their etiology. Differently from\nother beliefs, they are produced by mechanisms that are dysfunctional\nor defective. For instance, their formation process may be\ncharacterized by perceptual aberrations or cognitive deficits (McKay\nand Dennett 2009; Coltheart et al. 2010). \n\n\nThe challenge for (i) is to account for the difference in kind between\nthe irrationality of common beliefs that are ungrounded and resistant\nto change (such as superstitious beliefs or beliefs in alien\nabduction) and the irrationality of delusions. There is abundance of\nevidence that delusional phenomena are widespread in the normal\npopulation, which suggests that a sharp dichotomy between the normal\nand the pathological would be at best a simplification (see Maher\n1974, Johns and van Os 2001, Bentall 2003, 2018, and Sullivan-Bissett\n2020).\n\nAccounts in (ii) and (iii) may be plausible for some delusions that\nappear to defy commonsense and are accompanied by a certain type of\nheightened experience, but do not apply equally well to more mundane\ndelusions such as delusions of jealousy or persecution. Moreover, it\nis not always obvious that a delusion makes our behavior particularly\ndifficult to explain or predict. In some cases, delusions can help\nmake sense of previous adversities or unusual experiences, and even\ngive meaning to our lives (Gunn and Bortolotti 2018, Ritunnano and\nBortolotti 2021).\n\nThe view described in (iv) is very attractive because it captures the\ndistinction between delusions and other irrational beliefs in terms of\nthe effects on other aspects of our psychological and social life.\nHowever, using the notions of wellbeing and harm in accounts of\ndelusions can be problematic. For some people, living with the\ndelusion may be preferable to living without the delusion: ceasing to\nbelieve that I am a famous TV broadcaster after many years, and\nstarting to accept that I have been mentally unwell instead, can cause\nlow self esteem leading me to depression and suicidal thoughts (see\nthe literature on the insight paradox, e.g.\nBelvederi Murri et al. 2016). Indeed, in the philosophical\nand psychiatric literature there have been recent explorations of the\nidea that some delusions are adaptive in some sense, psychologically,\nbiologically, and even epistemically (McKay and Dennett 2009, Fineberg\nand Corlett 2016, Bortolotti 2016, Ritunnano, Humpston and Broome\n2021).\n\nChallenges for a forensic account of delusions in (v) lie in the\nheterogeneity of the behavior exhibited by those who experience\ndelusions. Although some delusions are accompanied by severe failures\nof autonomous decision-making and give rise to actions for which the\nagent is not held accountable, it is not obvious that these cases are\ngeneralisable. Does the mere presence of delusions indicate lack of\nautonomy or responsibility? Broome et al. (2010) and\nBortolotti et al. (2014) discuss case studies raising\npressing issues about the role of delusions in criminal action.\nFurther, recent literature on whether people with delusions can be\nvulnerable to epistemic injustice, suggests that the presence of\ndelusions does not undermine agency (Sanati and Kyratsous 2015).\n\nThe etiological answer to the question why delusions are pathological\nin (vi) needs to be better explored. So far, the consensus seems to be\nthat reasoning biases affect neurotypical reasoning, and are not\npresent only in people with delusions. Perceptual anomalies can\nexplain the formation of some delusions, but are not always a\ncore factor in the formation of all delusions. A problem with\nhypothesis evaluation may be at the origin of all delusions, but there\nis no agreement as to whether the problem is a permanent deficit or a\nmere performance error. Thus, it is not clear whether etiological\nconsiderations can support a categorical distinction between\npathological and non-pathological beliefs. The theory that delusions\nare due to a disruption of prediction-error signals may be able to\nvindicate this approach, although it is not clear what the link would\nbe between such a disruption and the pathological nature of the\nbeliefs adopted as a result of it.\n",
