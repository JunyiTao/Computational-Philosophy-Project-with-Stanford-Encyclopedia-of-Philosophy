    "main_text": "Autonomy in Moral Philosophy || Autonomy as an Object of Value\n2.1 Autonomy as an Object of Value\n\nAutonomy can play a role in moral theory without that theory being\nfully Kantian in structure. For example, it is possible to argue that\npersonal autonomy has intrinsic value independent of a fully worked\nout view of practical reason. Following John Stuart Mill, for example,\none can claim that autonomy is \u201cone of the elements of\nwell-being\u201d (Mill 1859/1975, ch. III). Viewing autonomy as an\nintrinsic value or as a constitutive element in personal well-being in\nthis way opens the door to a generally consequentialist moral\nframework while paying heed to the importance of self-government to a\nfulfilling life (for discussion see Sumner 1996).\n\nIt may also be unclear why autonomy \u2014 viewed here as the\ncapacity to reflect on and endorse one\u2019s values, character and\ncommitments \u2014 should have value independent of the results of\nexercising that capacity. Why is one person\u2019s autonomy\nintrinsically valuable when she uses it to, say, harm herself or make\nrash or morally skewed choices? More generally, how can we take\naccount of the systematic biases and distortions that plague typical\nhuman reasoning in valuing people\u2019s capacity to make decisions\nfor themselves (see, e.g., Conly 2013)? This question becomes more\nacute as we consider ways that autonomy can obtain in degrees, for\nthen it is unclear why personal autonomy should be seen as equally\nvaluable in persons who display different levels of it (or different\nlevels of those abilities that are its conditions, such as\nrationality).\n\nIndeed, autonomy is often cited as the ground of treating all\nindividuals equally from a moral point of view. But if autonomy is not\nan all-or-nothing characteristic, this commitment to moral equality\nbecomes problematic (Arneson 1999). It can be argued that insofar as\nthe abilities required for autonomy, such as rational reflectiveness,\ncompetences in carrying out one\u2019s decisions, and the like, vary\nacross individuals (within or between species as well), then it is\ndifficult to maintain that all autonomous beings have equal moral\nstatus or that their interests deserve the same weight in considering\ndecisions that affect them.\n\nThe move that must be made here, I think, picks up on\nKorsgaard\u2019s gloss on Kantianism and the argument that our\nreflective capacities ultimately ground our obligations to others and,\nin turn, others\u2019 obligations to regard us as moral equals.\nArneson argues, however, that people surely vary in this capacity as\nwell \u2014 the ability to reflectively consider options and choose\nsensibly from among them. Recall what we said above concerning the\nambiguities of Korsgaard\u2019s account concerning the degree to\nwhich the self-reflection that grounds obligation is idealized at all.\nIf it is, then it is not the everyday capacity to look within\nourselves and make a choice that gives us moral status but the more\nrarified ability to do so rationally, in some full sense. But we\nsurely vary in our ability to reach that ideal, so why should our\nautonomy be regarded as equally worthy?\n\nThe answer may be that our normative commitments do not arise from our\nactual capacities to reflect and to choose (though we must have such\ncapacities to some minimal degree), but rather from the way in which\nwe must view ourselves as having these capacities. We give\nspecial weight to our own present and past decisions, so that we\ncontinue on with projects and plans we make because (all other things\nbeing equal) we made them, they are ours, at least when we do\nthem after some reflective deliberation. The pull that our own\ndecisions have on our ongoing projects and actions can only be\nexplained by the assumption that we confer status and value on\ndecisions simply because we reflectively made them (perhaps, though,\nin light of external, objective considerations). This is an\nall-or-nothing capacity and hence may be enough to ground our equal\nstatus even if perhaps, in real life, we exercise this capacity to\nvarying\n degrees.[3]\n Much has been written about conceptions of well being that rehearse\nthese worries (see Sumner 1996, Griffin 1988). Such a view might be\nbuttressed with the idea that the attribution of autonomous agency,\nand the respect that purportedly goes with it, is itself a normative\nstance, not a mere observation of how a person actually thinks and\nacts (for discussion of this position see Christman 2009, chap. 10 and\nKorsgaard 2014)\n",
