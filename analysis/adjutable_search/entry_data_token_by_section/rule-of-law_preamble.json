    "main_text": "\n\nThe phrase \u201cthe Rule of Law\u201d has to be distinguished from\nthe phrase \u201ca rule of law\u201d. The latter phrase is used to\ndesignate some particular legal rule like the rule against\nperpetuities or the rule that says we have to file our taxes by a certain date. Those are\nrules of law, but the Rule of Law is one of the ideals of our\npolitical morality and it refers to the ascendancy of law as such and\nof the institutions of the legal system in a system of governance.\n\n\nThe Rule of Law comprises a number of principles of a formal and\nprocedural character, addressing the way in which a community is\ngoverned. The formal principles concern the generality, clarity,\npublicity, stability, and prospectivity of the norms that govern a\nsociety. The procedural principles concern the processes by which\nthese norms are administered, and the institutions\u2014like courts\nand an independent judiciary that their administration requires. On\nsome accounts, the Rule of Law also comprises certain substantive\nideals like a presumption of liberty and respect for private property\nrights. But these are much more controversial (see\n section 1\n below). And indeed as we shall see there is a great deal of\ncontroversy about what the Rule of Law requires. \n",
