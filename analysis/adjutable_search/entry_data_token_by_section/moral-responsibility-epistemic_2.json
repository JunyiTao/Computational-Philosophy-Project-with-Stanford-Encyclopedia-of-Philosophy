    "main_text": "The Epistemic Condition and Revisionism\n2. The Epistemic Condition and Revisionism\n\nSo far we have pursued the intuitive idea that responsibility requires\nawareness and reviewed several positions concerning the content and\nkind of awareness that is in question. We\u2019ll now see that this\nintuitive idea, coupled with a particular interpretation of the\ncontent and kind of the requisite awareness, leads to a regress that\nthreatens to undermine attributions of responsibility quite generally.\nThe following argument is originally due to Zimmerman (1997), who\noffered slight variations in his 2008 and 2017. Rosen (2004) and Levy\n(2011: ch. 5) have also advanced versions of it, as well as Ginet\n(2000), although the latter fails to note its revisionist\nimplications. We\u2019ll call the proponents of this argument\n\u2018volitionists\u2019, and the position they espouse concerning\nthe EC \u2018revisionism\u2019. The volitionists\u2019 argument\nsparked a big debate in which the three central questions concerning\nthe EC mentioned at the outset\u2014about the content, kind, and\nnecessity of awareness\u2014have been thoroughly explored. This\nsection presents a reconstruction of the regress argument and the next\none presents the main responses to it.\n\nTo appreciate how the regress is generated, consider the variation of\nour initial example in which John falsely believes that the wall\nbutton is a light switch. Since John isn\u2019t aware that by\npressing the button he is activating the treadmill, he fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of awareness of action under an appropriate\ndescription and, a fortiori, he also fails to satisfy the\nrequirements concerning awareness of moral significance and of\nconsequences. Therefore, since John is unaware that pressing the\nbutton is wrong (or, alternatively, unaware of the action\u2019s\nwrong-making features) and is also unaware of the potential\nconsequences of doing so, we may think that, at least in principle, he\nis blameworthy neither for his action nor for Mary\u2019s injuries.\nJohn\u2019s unawareness or, as it\u2019s often put, John\u2019s\nignorance would play the role of an excuse for his\nwrongdoing, where an excuse is a consideration that blocks the\nattribution of blame to an agent who has performed a wrong action\n(Austin 1957 [1962]; Kelly 2012; Franklin 2013. For detailed\ndiscussions of the ignorance excuse see Rosen 2008; Peels 2014; Baron\n2017). As it was noted above, however, John\u2019s ignorance can\nitself be blameworthy or culpable, and it\u2019s\nwidely\u2014although not universally (cf. Holly Smith 2017; Ross\n1939: 163\u20134)\u2014accepted that culpable ignorance fails to\nexculpate (at least completely). Thus, it if turns out that John is\nculpable for his ignorance of the button\u2019s true function, he\nmight well be blameworthy for unwittingly activating the treadmill and\nfor unwittingly causing Mary\u2019s injuries. Notice that if this\nwere the case, John\u2019s blameworthiness for his unwitting action\nand its consequences would be derivative (or\nindirect) rather than original (or direct):\nit would derive from a prior instance of blameworthiness, namely his\nblameworthiness for his ignorant state (Zimmerman 1997: 414\u20135;\nRosen 2004: 300). (See King 2017 for criticism of the idea that\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing must be explained in terms of\nthe original/derivative distinction, and see Wieland and Robichaud\n2017 for a thorough discussion of different ways of cashing out the\nidea that there is a \u201ctransfer\u201d of blame in these\ncases.)\n\nSo now the crucial question becomes: What would it take for John to be\nblameworthy for his ignorance? John\u2019s ignorance of the fact that\nhis action is wrong is rooted in his mistaken belief that the button\nis a light switch, so it seems that if he is blameworthy for his\nignorance it must be because he is blameworthy for having this belief\nor for lacking the correct belief about the button\u2019s\n function.[4]\n So what would it take for John to be blameworthy for having certain\nbeliefs or lacking others? In answering this question volitionists\nappeal to the thesis of doxastic involuntarism, according to which we\nlack direct control over our beliefs, that is, we can\u2019t decide\nat will what to believe (Williams 1973; Alston 1988; Zimmerman 2002a;\nRosen 2004: 302; Levy 2007; 2011: 128\u201331). So if John is\nblameworthy for having or lacking certain beliefs, this must be\nbecause there was something John did such that: i) he had\ndirect control over it; ii) it caused him to have or lack certain\nbeliefs; iii) doing such a thing is all-things-considered wrong; and\niv) he is blameworthy for having done it. (Notice that, on this view,\nresponsibility for ignorance is also derivative.) The natural\ncandidate that satisfies clauses i to iii is what Holly Smith (1983)\ncalls a \u201cbenighting act\u201d: an action or omission the\nconsequence of which is the lack of a true belief about the\nimpermissibility of one\u2019s conduct. In other words, by performing\na benighting act the agent brings about her own ignorance about the\nwrongness of her subsequent action. In our example we can imagine\nseveral benighting acts John may have performed, such as discarding\n(without reading it first) the operational booklet that was given to\nhim when he was hired at the fitness center, not asking a colleague to\nshow him around before touching anything, not reading the conspicuous\n\u201cCaution: activates treadmill\u201d sign placed above the\nbutton, etc.\n\nAny of these actions and omissions satisfies clauses i to iii above:\ni) John has direct control over keeping (and reading) a booklet or\nreading a sign or asking questions; ii) John\u2019s failure to\nperform at least one of these actions caused him to lack a true belief\nabout the button\u2019s function; and iii) any of these actions and\nomissions is, in the relevant context, all-things-considered wrong,\nsince John was under a \u2018procedural epistemic obligation\u2019\n(Rosen 2004: 301) to inform himself about the functioning of the\nplace. Wrongness, however, isn\u2019t the same as blameworthiness, so\nwe still need to know (clause iv) if John is blameworthy for any of\nthese benighting acts (H. Smith 1983: 548). The natural thought at\nthis point is that culpability for a benighting act requires exactly\nthe same as culpability for any other act (Zimmerman 1997: 416).\nTherefore, if we started from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness, we\u2019ll conclude that one is blameworthy for a\nbenighting act only if, at the time of performing it, one is aware of\nwhat one is doing, of its moral significance, of its potential\nconsequences, and of alternatives to it. This entails that John is\nblameworthy for any of the benighting acts described above only if\neither he performed any of them in full awareness (including awareness\nof the probable consequence of leaving him ignorant of relevant\nconsiderations) or, if this wasn\u2019t the case, he is in\nturn blameworthy for this further lack of awareness.\n\nIt becomes clear at this point that in trying to establish\nJohn\u2019s blameworthiness for the original action we are facing a\nregress. John would be blameworthy for his unwittingly activating the\ntreadmill and its consequences only if his ignorance of the\nbutton\u2019s function was itself culpable, which in turn requires\nthat such ignorance derives from a culpable action or\nomission (a benighting act). But culpability for a benighting act\nagain seems to require awareness, so if John\u2019s omissions to\ninform himself were also unwitting\u2014if he was also ignorant or\nunaware of the need to read the operational booklet, say\u2014we\nwould need to search for further benighting acts to which we\ncould trace back this extra piece of ignorance. For the regress to\nterminate, the agent\u2019s ignorance must be at some point the\ncausal upshot of an action or omission performed in full awareness of\nall the relevant facts (including the relevant moral facts.\nSee below). As Rosen puts it,\n\n\nHe would have to know the pertinent facts about his contemplated act.\nHe would have to know that it was wrong. And he would have to know\nthat in the circumstances, all things considered, he should not do it.\nHe would then have to act despite this knowledge. (Rosen 2004:\n307)\n\n\nAn action performed in this way would be an akratic action,\nthat is, an action performed while occurrently and de dicto\n(Rosen 2004: 309) believing that it\u2019s all-things-considered\nwrong to do it. It thus follows from the regress argument that\n\u201cthe only possible locus of original responsibility is an\nakratic act\u201d (Rosen 2004: 307), and this entails that every\nblameworthy action must be either itself an akratic action or the\ncausal upshot of one (Zimmerman [2008: 176] calls the second disjunct\n\u2018the Origination Thesis\u2019). This is the \u2018akrasia\nrequirement\u2019 on blameworthiness defended by volitionists. The\nakrasia requirement is a surprising result with troubling revisionist\nimplications, because when we make ordinary judgments of\nblameworthiness we rarely (if ever) check to see whether it is met\n(Zimmerman 2017: 84). According to the argument, however, we should,\nfor if it isn\u2019t met attributions of blame are mistaken. And the\nproblem isn\u2019t merely that the soundness of the argument would\nforce us to take extra steps before blaming others; rather, the\nproblem is that it can be speculated that ignorant wrongdoing very\nrarely has such non-ignorant (or akratic) origins (Zimmerman 1997:\n418; Levy 2011: 131). Moreover, it has been argued that it would be\nvery difficult, or even impossible, for us to ascertain whether the\nakrasia requirement has been met on any particular occasion (Rosen\n2004: 308). In either case, the upshot is that many, perhaps most, of\nour ordinary judgments of blameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing are\nunwarranted.\n\nAnd indeed things can get worse, for volitionists claim that this\nargument applies to all kinds of ignorance, not just factual\nignorance as in John\u2019s example (Zimmerman 1997: 423; Rosen 2003;\n2004: 304; Levy 2011:\n 118\u201323).[5]\n Consider a variant of the case in which John is aware that pressing\nthe button will activate the treadmill and foresees as well that doing\nso might cause Mary to fall and sustain an injury (and even intends\nthis to be the case). But suppose that John doesn\u2019t believe, and\nso isn\u2019t aware, that harming Mary is wrong, perhaps because he\nwas raised in an extremely sexist society in which it\u2019s widely\nassumed that men are allowed to harm women in response to perceived\nthreats to their manhood (think of the many places in which\n\u2018honor killings\u2019 against women are still considered\nacceptable). In this variant, John acts from moral ignorance,\nnot factual ignorance, and yet volitionists claim that since John is\nunaware that what he\u2019s doing is wrong, the argument applies to\nhim in this variant as well: he is blameworthy for his action only if\nhe is blameworthy for his (moral) ignorance, and he is blameworthy for\nthe latter only if it derives from a blameworthy benighting act, such\nas knowingly refusing to question his sexist beliefs. If these\nconditions aren\u2019t met, volitionists claim that John is excused,\nbecause according to them non-culpable ignorance, be it factual or\nmoral, always exculpate. This is what Rosen (2003) calls the\n\u2018Parity Thesis\u2019. (Husak 2016 offers a book-length defense\nof the idea that legal ignorance also excuses, which has\nseveral points in common with the volitionists\u2019 position. See\nYaffe 2018 for criticism.)\n\nRosen (2004: 305\u20136; see also Levy 2011: 141) even claims that if\nan agent is aware that her contemplated act is morally wrong but fails\nto believe that it\u2019s all-things-considered wrong,\nperhaps because she believes that sometimes self-interest trumps\nmorality, she also acts from ignorance (in this case, ignorance of\n\u2018the rational force of moral considerations\u2019), which means\nthat the regress argument also applies to her. Thus, volitionists\nthink that ignorant wrongdoing is extremely widespread\n(especially because they think that lack of occurrent belief counts as\nignorance), and this is why the regress argument applies to all\nwrongdoers except for akratic ones. Therefore, the argument ultimately\nthreatens to undermine attributions of responsibility quite\n generally.[6]\n\nIt seems to most philosophers that something has gone awry at this\npoint, for (the assumption seems to be) it can\u2019t be the case\nthat the requirements of the EC are so stringent that most ordinary\nwrongdoers, particularly morally ignorant ones (Schnall 2004:\n308), fail to meet them and so turn out to be blameless after all\n(FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578; Clarke 2014: 162). The\nchallenge is to articulate what exactly is wrong with the regress\nargument. It will be useful to spell out its four main theses:\n\nDerivative Blameworthiness for Actions. An agent is\nblameworthy for a wrongful action performed out of ignorance only if\n(and because) she is culpable for the ignorance from which she\n acts.[7]\nDerivative Blameworthiness for Ignorance. Ignorance is\nculpable only if it derives from a benighting act performed in full\nawareness.\nAwareness. Relevant awareness (for ordinary actions and\nbenighting acts) involves occurrent and de dicto beliefs\nabout the action\u2019s overall wrongness.\nParity. Theses i and ii apply to all kinds of\nignorance.\n\n\nIn the next section we\u2019ll survey the main responses to the\nregress argument. Each of these responses denies one or more of the\nargument\u2019s main theses and, in so doing, develop alternative\ninterpretations of the EC. (See Wieland 2017a for another presentation\nof the competing positions in this debate.)\n",
