    "main_text": "Classifying Mystical Experiences || Dualistic and Monistic\n2.2 Dualistic and Monistic\n\nA favorite distinction of Western philosophers is between dualistic\nand monistic experiences. A dualistic experience maintains\nsome distinction, however tenuous, between the subject and what\nis disclosed. Thus, theistic mystical experiences typically are\ndualistic, retaining, at some level, a distinction between God and the\nmystic. Monistic experiences are the extreme of unitive\nexperiences in that they dissolve all duality (Merkur 1999). They\nare either experiences of the absolute ontological oneness of\neverything, free of our conceptual distinctions, or are pure\nconsciousness experiences.\n2.2.1 Union with God\n\nClassical mystics did not usually speak of a true \u201cunion with\nGod.\u201d The term \u201cunio mystica\u201d was devised in the\nthirteenth century, but few Christian mystics used that term before\nthe modern era (McGinn 2001, 132; Jantzen 1995) \u2014 only\nin the modern study of mysticism has unio mystica received a\ncentral place (McGinn 2006, 427). When Abrahamic mystics\ndo use the language of union, it involves a falling away of the\nseparation between a person and God short of identity: the\nidea is more of \u201ccommunion\u201d with God than union.\n\u201cDeification\u201d means becoming God-like. All mystical\nexperiences involve overcoming a sense of \u201cself,\u201d but usually not\na sense of becoming another reality. In theisms, this is an\nalignment of spirits, not an ontological union of different substances\nthat were once distinct. Christian mystics used various metaphors.\nHenry Suso (1295\u20131366) likened union with God to a drop of\nwater falling into wine, taking on the taste and color of the wine\n(Suso 1953, 185); Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293\u20131381)\ndescribed union as \u201ciron within the fire and the fire within the\niron;\u201d Teresa of Avila (1515\u20131882) likened the soul\nthat absorbs and is saturated with God to a sponge and\nwater. (See Pike 1992,\nchap. 2; Mommaers 2009.) A \u201cspiritual marriage\u201d of\nthe soul (the bride) and Christ (the bridegroom) is common. Bernard of\nClairvaux (1090\u20131153) described unification as \u201cmutuality\nof love.\u201d Overall, classical Christian mystics usually\ntreated \u201cbecoming one with God\u201d as a loving union of wills\nwith God\u2019s or even a fusion of the mind with God\u2019s (McGinn\n2006, 427\u2013429). Medieval Christian mystics generally interpreted the\nbiblical claim that \u201cit is no longer I who lives but Christ who\nlives in me\u201d (Galatians 2:20) to mean the Holy\nSpirit was filling their mind or spirit resulting in a\ncomplete alignment of one\u2019s will with God\u2019s. In Sufism, when\none\u2019s sense of self passes away (fana), one is filled with\nthe presence of Allah (baqa), although the orthodox Sufis\ninsist that the soul does not cease to exist but only that one is\nunaware of it in the blinding light of the presence of Allah\n(Schimmel 1975).\n2.2.2 Identity with God\n\nTheistic mystics sometimes speak as though they have the awareness of\nbeing fully absorbed into God or even becoming identical\nto God. Examples are the Islamic Sufi mystic al-Husayn al-Hallaj\n(858\u2013922) proclaiming \u201cI am the Real\u201d (see\nSchimmel 1975, chap. 2) and the Jewish Kabbalist Isaac of\nAcre (b. 1291?) who wrote of the soul being completely absorbed\ninto God \u201cas a jug of water into a running\nwell\u201d (Idel 1988, 67). The Hasidic master\nRabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745\u20131812) wrote of a\nperson as a drop of water in the ocean of the Infinite with an\nillusory sense of individual \u201cdropness.\u201d The Christian\nmystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260\u20131327/8) claimed that we and\nGod share the same being (esse) supplied by a\ntranscendent Godhead (Eckhart 2009, 109). It is still controversial,\nhowever, as to when such declarations are to be taken as assertions of\ntrue identity and when they are hyperbolic variations on descriptions\nof union-type experiences. Shankara\u2019s Advaita gives a nontheistic\nexample: our \u201cessence\u201d (atman) is identical to the only\nreality there is (Brahman) \u2014 there is a nonduality\n(a-dvaita) of all essences.\n",
