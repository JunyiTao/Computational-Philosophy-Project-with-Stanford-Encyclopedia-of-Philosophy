    "main_text": "The Ingredients of Medieval Philosophy || The Platonic Schools of Late Antiquity\n1.2 The Platonic Schools of Late Antiquity\n\nThe main root of the four branches of medieval philosophy\u2014Greek,\nLatin, Arabic, and Jewish\u2014is in the two great so-called Platonic\nSchools of Athens and Alexandria, although each tradition also had its\nown special roots\n (\u00a71.4).\n The new version of Platonism formulated by Plotinus (d. 270) had\nreplaced the Hellenistic Schools (Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics etc.)\nas the dominant type of philosophy in the late Roman Empire. But\nPlotinus\u2019s star pupil, Porphyry (c. 232\u2013305), had given\nhis master\u2019s teaching a decisive twist. Plotinus considered\nAristotle an opponent of Plato and regarded him with hostility.\nPorphyry held, rather, that Aristotle\u2019s thought, which was about\nthe sensibly-perceptible world, harmonized with Plato\u2019s, about\nsuper-sensible reality. Following Porphyry\u2019s lead, students at\nthe \u201cPlatonic\u201d Schools began by studying the whole\nAristotelian corpus, logic first, and only then moved on to\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. In all four branches, it was the Aristotelian\ncurriculum that survived, in whole or part. Medieval philosophy is,\ntherefore, to some extent the history of Aristotelianism, but\ntransmitted within a Platonist context, shaped by the different\nreligious traditions and transformed both by individual thinkers and\nvarious, changing cultural circumstances.\n",
