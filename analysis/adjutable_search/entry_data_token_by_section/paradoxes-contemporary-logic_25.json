    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || Staying non-classical\n6.7 Towards a \u201cgeometric\u201d approach\n\nBesides tools from algebra and analysis, logical investigations about\nparadoxes have recently applied graph theory (see Cook 2004, Rabern,\nRabern and Macauley 2013, Beringer and Schindler 2017, Hsiung 2017): a\nbasic idea is the attempt to grasp in geometric terms the patterns\nof paradox, their structural features. For instance, one\ncan assign a reference graph (rfg) to sentences of the\nlanguage of arithmetic with truth via Leitgeb\u2019s notion of\ndependence (Leitgeb 2005). It is further conjectured that a solution\nto the characterization problem for dangerous rfgs amounts to the\nclaim that basically the Liar- and the Yablo graph are the only\nparadoxical rfgs. This route is independently developed in Rossi\n2019 by exploring the wide range of semantic behaviours displayed by\nparadoxical sentences, and providing a unified theory of truth and\nparadox. The result is a theory of truth that yields a threefold\nclassification of paradoxical sentences (liar-like sentences,\ntruth-teller-like sentences, and revenge sentences), and proposes a\nway of interpreting all three kinds, as well as paradox-free\nsentences, within a single model, where the basic tool is a notion of\n\u201csemantic graph\u201d. In Hsiung 2020, instead, Leitgeb\u2019s\napproach is combined with the one of Beringer and Schindler 2017 to\nstudy a type of paradoxes of finitary characteristic, which is defined\nin terms of Leitgeb\u2019s dependence relation itself.\n",
