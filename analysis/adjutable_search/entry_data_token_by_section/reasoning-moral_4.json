    "main_text": "The Philosophical Importance of Moral Reasoning || How Distinct is Moral Reasoning from Practical Reasoning in General?\n1.5 How Distinct is Moral Reasoning from Practical Reasoning in General?\n\nThe final threshold question is whether moral reasoning is truly\ndistinct from practical reasoning more generally understood. (The\nquestion of whether moral reasoning, even if practical, is\nstructurally distinct from theoretical reasoning that simply proceeds\nfrom a proper recognition of the moral facts has already been\nimplicitly addressed and answered, for the purposes of the present\ndiscussion, in the affirmative.) In addressing this final question, it\nis difficult to overlook the way different moral theories project\nquite different models of moral reasoning \u2013 again a link that\nmight be pursued by the moral philosopher seeking leverage in either\ndirection. For instance, Aristotle\u2019s views might be as follows:\na quite general account can be given of practical reasoning, which\nincludes selecting means to ends and determining the constituents of a\ndesired activity. The difference between the reasoning of a vicious\nperson and that of a virtuous person differs not at all in its\nstructure, but only in its content, for the virtuous person pursues\ntrue goods, whereas the vicious person simply gets side-tracked by\napparent ones. To be sure, the virtuous person may be able to achieve\na greater integration of his or her ends via practical reasoning\n(because of the way the various virtues cohere), but this is a\ndifference in the result of practical reasoning and not in its\nstructure. At an opposite extreme, Kant\u2019s categorical imperative\nhas been taken to generate an approach to practical reasoning (via a\n\u201ctypic of practical judgment\u201d) that is distinctive from\nother practical reasoning both in the range of considerations it\naddresses and its structure (Nell 1975). Whereas prudential practical\nreasoning, on Kant\u2019s view, aims to maximize one\u2019s\nhappiness, moral reasoning addresses the potential universalizability\nof the maxims \u2013 roughly, the intentions \u2013 on which one\nacts. Views intermediate between Aristotle\u2019s and Kant\u2019s in\nthis respect include Hare\u2019s utilitarian view and Aquinas\u2019\nnatural-law view. On Hare\u2019s view, just as an ideal prudential\nagent applies maximizing rationality to his or her own preferences, an\nideal moral agent\u2019s reasoning applies maximizing rationality to\nthe set of everyone\u2019s preferences that its archangelic capacity\nfor sympathy has enabled it to internalize (Hare 1981). Thomistic,\nnatural-law views share the Aristotelian view about the general unity\nof practical reasoning in pursuit of the good, rightly or wrongly\nconceived, but add that practical reason, in addition to demanding\nthat we pursue the fundamental human goods, also, and distinctly,\ndemands that we not attack these goods. In this way, natural-law views\nincorporate some distinctively moral structuring \u2013 such as the\ndistinctions between doing and allowing and the so-called\n doctrine of double effect\u2019s\n distinction between intending as a means and accepting as a\nby-product \u2013 within a unified account of practical reasoning\n(see entry on the\n natural law tradition in ethics).\n In light of this diversity of views about the relation between moral\nreasoning and practical or prudential reasoning, a general account of\nmoral reasoning that does not want to presume the correctness of a\ndefinite moral theory will do well to remain agnostic on the question\nof how moral reasoning relates to non-moral practical reasoning. \n",
