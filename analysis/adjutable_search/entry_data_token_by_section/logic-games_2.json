    "main_text": "Semantic Games for Classical Logic\n3. Semantic Games for Classical Logic\n\nIn the early 1930s Alfred Tarski proposed a definition of truth. His\ndefinition consisted of a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nsentence in the language of a typical formal theory to be true; his\nnecessary and sufficient condition used only notions from syntax and\nset theory, together with the primitive notions of the formal theory\nin question. In fact Tarski defined the more general relation\n\u2018formula \\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) is true of the elements\n\\(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n\\)\u2019; truth of a sentence is the special case\nwhere \\(n = 0\\). For example the question whether \n\n\u2018For all \\(x\\) there is \\(y\\) such that R\\((x, y)\\)\u2019 is\ntrue\n\nreduces to the question whether the following holds:\n\nFor every object \\(a\\) the sentence \u2018There is \\(y\\) such that\nR\\((a, y)\\)\u2019 is true.\n\nThis in turn reduces to:\n\nFor every object \\(a\\) there is an object \\(b\\) such that the sentence\n\u2018R\\((a, b)\\)\u2019 is true.\n\nIn this example, that\u2019s as far as Tarski\u2019s truth\ndefinition will take us.\n\nIn the late 1950s Leon Henkin noticed that we can intuitively\nunderstand some sentences which can\u2019t be handled by\nTarski\u2019s definition. Take for example the infinitely long\nsentence\n\nFor all \\(x_0\\) there is \\(y_0\\) such that for all \\(x_1\\) there is\n\\(y_1\\) such that \u2026 R\\((x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1,\\ldots)\\).\n\nTarski\u2019s approach fails because the string of quantifiers at the\nbeginning is infinite, and we would never reach an end of stripping\nthem off. Instead, Henkin suggested, we should consider the game where\na person \\(\\forall\\) chooses an object \\(a_0\\) for \\(x_0\\), then a\nsecond person \\(\\exists\\) chooses an object \\(b_0\\) for \\(y_0\\), then\n\\(\\forall\\) chooses \\(a_1\\) for \\(x_1, \\exists\\) chooses \\(b_1\\) for\n\\(y_1\\) and so on. A play of this game is a win for \\(\\exists\\) if and\nonly if the infinite atomic sentence \n\n\\[\n\\R(a_0, b_0, a_1, b_1,\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n\nis true. The original sentence is true if and only if player\n\\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy for this game. Strictly Henkin used\nthe game only as a metaphor, and the truth condition that he proposed\nwas that the skolemised version of the sentence is true, i.e. that\nthere are functions \\(f_0, f_1,\\ldots\\) such that for every choice of\n\\(a_0, a_1, a_2\\) etc. we have \n\n\\[ \n\\R(a_0, f_0 (a_0), a_1, f_1 (a_0, a_1), a_2, f_2 (a_0, a_1, a_2),\\ldots).\n\\]\n\n\nBut this condition translates immediately into the language of games;\nthe Skolem functions \\(f_0\\) etc. define a winning strategy for\n\\(\\exists\\), telling her how to choose in the light of earlier choices\nby \\(\\forall\\). (It came to light sometime later that C. S. Peirce had\nalready suggested explaining the difference between\n\u2018every\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019 in terms of who chooses the\nobject; for example in his second Cambridge Conference lecture of\n1898.)\n\nSoon after Henkin\u2019s work, Jaakko Hintikka added that the same\nidea applies with conjunctions and disjunctions. We can regard a\nconjunction \u2018\\(\\phi \\wedge \\psi\\)\u2019 as a universally\nquantified statement expressing \u2018Every one of the sentences\n\\(\\phi , \\psi\\) holds\u2019, so it should be for the player\n\\(\\forall\\) to choose one of the sentences. As Hintikka put it, to\nplay the game \\(G(\\phi \\wedge \\psi), \\forall\\) chooses whether the\ngame should proceed as \\(G(\\phi)\\) or as \\(G(\\psi)\\). Likewise\ndisjunctions become existentially quantified statements about sets of\nsentences, and they mark moves where the player \\(\\exists\\) chooses\nhow the game should proceed. To bring quantifiers into the same style,\nhe proposed that the game \\(G(\\forall x \\phi(x))\\) proceeds thus:\nplayer \\(\\forall\\) chooses an object and provides a name \\(a\\) for it,\nand the game proceeds as \\(G(\\phi(a))\\). (And likewise with\nexistential quantifiers, except that \\(\\exists\\) chooses.) Hintikka\nalso made an ingenious suggestion for introducing negation. Each game\nG has a dual game which is the same as G except that the\nplayers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) are transposed in both the rules\nfor playing and the rules for winning. The game \\(G(\\neg \\phi)\\) is\nthe dual of \\(G(\\phi)\\).\n\nOne can prove that for any first-order sentence \\(\\phi\\), interpreted\nin a fixed structure \\(A\\), player \\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy\nfor Hintikka\u2019s game \\(G(\\phi)\\) if and only if \\(\\phi\\) is true\nin \\(A\\) in the sense of Tarski. Two features of this proof are\ninteresting. First, if \\(\\phi\\) is any first-order sentence then the\ngame \\(G(\\phi)\\) has finite length, and so the Gale-Stewart theorem\ntells us that it is determined. We infer that \\(\\exists\\) has a\nwinning strategy in exactly one of \\(G(\\phi)\\) and its dual; so she\nhas a winning strategy in \\(G(\\neg \\phi)\\) if and only if she\ndoesn\u2019t have one in \\(G(\\phi)\\). This takes care of negation.\nAnd second, if \\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy for each game\n\\(G(\\phi(a))\\), then after choosing one such strategy \\(f_a\\) for each\n\\(a\\), she can string them together into a single winning strategy for\n\\(G(\\forall x \\phi(x))\\) (namely, \u2018Wait and see what element \\(a\n\\forall\\) chooses, then play \\(f_a\\)\u2019). This takes care of the\nclause for universal quantifiers; but the argument uses the axiom of\nchoice, and in fact it is not hard to see that the statement that\nHintikka\u2019s and Tarski\u2019s definitions of truth are\nequivalent is itself equivalent to the axiom of choice (given the\nother axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory).\n\nIt\u2019s puzzling that we have here two theories of when a sentence\nis true, and the theories are not equivalent if the axiom of choice\nfails. In fact the reason is not very deep. The axiom of choice is\nneeded not because the Hintikka definition uses games, but because it\nassumes that strategies are deterministic, i.e. that they are\nsingle-valued functions giving the user no choice of options. A more\nnatural way of translating the Tarski definition into game terms is to\nuse nondeterministic strategies, sometimes called quasistrategies (see\nKolaitis 1985 for details). (However, Hintikka 1996 insists that the\ncorrect explication of \u2018true\u2019 is the one using\ndeterministic strategies, and that this fact vindicates the axiom of\nchoice.)\n\nComputer implementations of these games of Hintikka proved to be a\nvery effective way of teaching the meanings of first-order sentences.\nOne such package was designed by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy at\nStanford, called \u2018Tarski\u2019s World\u2019. Independently\nanother team at the University of Omsk constructed a Russian version\nfor use at schools for gifted children.\n\nIn the published version of his John Locke lectures at Oxford,\nHintikka in 1973 raised the Dawkins question (see above) for these\ngames. His answer was that one should look to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlanguage games, and the language games for understanding quantifiers\nare those which revolve around seeking and finding. In the\ncorresponding logical games one should think of \\(\\exists\\) as Myself\nand \\(\\forall\\) as a hostile Nature who can never be relied on to\npresent the object I want; so to be sure of finding it, I need a\nwinning strategy. This story was never very convincing; the motivation\nof Nature is irrelevant, and nothing in the logical game corresponds\nto seeking. In retrospect it is a little disappointing that nobody\ntook the trouble to look for a better story. It may be more helpful to\nthink of a winning strategy for \\(\\exists\\) in \\(G(\\phi)\\) as a kind\nof proof (in a suitable infinitary system) that \\(\\phi\\) is true.\n\nLater Jaakko Hintikka extended the ideas of this section in two\ndirections, namely to natural language semantics and to games of\nimperfect information (see the next section). The name\nGame-Theoretic Semantics, GTS for short, has come to be used\nto cover both of these extensions.\n\nThe games described in this section adapt almost trivially to\nmany-sorted logic: for example the quantifier \\(\\forall x_{\\sigma}\\),\nwhere \\(x_{\\sigma}\\) is a variable of sort \\(\\sigma\\), is an\ninstruction for player \\(\\forall\\) to choose an element of sort\n\\(\\sigma\\). This immediately gives us the corresponding games for\nsecond-order logic, if we think of the elements of a structure as one\nsort, the sets of elements as a second sort, the binary relations as a\nthird and so on. It follows that we have, quite routinely, game rules\nfor most generalised quantifiers too; we can find them by first\ntranslating the generalised quantifiers into second-order logic.\n",
