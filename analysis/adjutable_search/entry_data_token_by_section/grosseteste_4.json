    "main_text": "Infinity, Continuity, and Measurement\n5. Infinity, Continuity, and Measurement\n Grosseteste appears to have been the first in the Latin West to\npropose a doctrine of unequal infinities. In On Light he holds\nthat there are infinite numbers that differ in size: \u201cthe sum of all\nnumbers, both odd and even, is infinite and  is greater than the sum of\nall the even numbers, even though this too is infinite, for it exceeds it\nby the sum of all the odd numbers\u201d (Lewis 2013, 241).  According to\nGrosseteste, infinite numbers can stand to one another not only in\nevery numerical ratio, but also in every non-numerical ratio\n(Grosseteste has in mind the ratio of the infinite numbers of points\ncontained in incommensurable lines). He clearly thinks lines and other\ncontinua contain different-sized infinities of points or\nindivisibles, viewed as dimensionless simples. But he also thinks\npoints are parts of lines, and more generally, that\nindivisibles serve to make up continua. He is aware that Aristotle\nseems to reject this view and hold that magnitudes only have\nmagnitudes as their parts, but he claims in  On Light that the\nterm \u201cpart\u201d has a range of meanings depending on which\nmathematical relationship of parts to wholes is in\nquestion. Aristotle, he asserts, means by \u201cpart\u201d in\nconnection with continua an aliquot part and is concerned only\nto deny that continua are composed of indivisibles as aliquot\nparts. But this denial does not entail that indivisibles are not parts\nstanding in a different mathematical relationship to the wholes to\nwhich they belong. According to On Light, a point is a part of\na line in the sense that it is in a line \u201can infinite number of times,\nand does not diminish the line when substracted from it a finite\nnumber of times\u201d (Lewis 2013, 242).  Grosseteste says little about the\nordering of indivisibles in continua but mentions without criticism\nAristotle\u2019s view that indivisibles in continua must be densely or\n\u201cmediately\u201d ordered, so that between any two is yet another, a view\nattributed to him by Albert the Great and Thomas Bradwardine (see\nLewis 2005).\n Grosseteste\u2019s theory of unequal infinities served as the basis of\na theory of how God measured the world he created.  Grosseteste takes\nup measurement in his commentary on the Physics (Dales 1963a,\n90\u201395), in one of the earliest theoretical discussions of measurement\nin the middle ages. He points out that human measurement of time\ninvolves taking some recurring movement\u2014say, the daily movement of\nthe heaven\u2014and stipulating its duration to be a unit of\nmeasurement. In the same way, the magnitude of some body is taken as a\nunit of the measurement of spatial magnitude. Measurement of this\nsort, Grosseteste holds, is inherently relative in nature. To say that\nan event lasts for a day, for example, is simply to relate its\nduration to the duration of the movement of the heavens. But Grosseteste\nthought that this mode of measurement would not suffice for God, who,\nas he frequently mentions, \u201chas disposed all things in number, weight\nand measure\u201d (Wisdom 11: 21).  God\u2019s creative activity requires\nthat he create bodies with a definite magnitude and movements with a\ndefinite duration, and this requires that there be a non-relative\nmeasure intrinsic to magnitudes and durations.  According to\nGrosseteste, this measure is provided by the different-sized\ninfinities of indivisibles comprising spatial and temporal\nmagnitudes. Grosseteste points out in his commentary on the\nPhysics that were only a single line to exist, it would not be\npossible for us to measure its magnitude, and yet God could do so by\ncounting the infinite number of points that comprise its\nmagnitude. Only God can measure in this way, for only to him is the\ninfinite finite, an allusion to Augustine\u2019s teaching in The City of\nGod 20.19 that God alone can embrace an infinity in his mind.\n",
