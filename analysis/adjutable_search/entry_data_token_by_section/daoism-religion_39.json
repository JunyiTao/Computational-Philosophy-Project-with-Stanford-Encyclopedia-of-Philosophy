    "main_text": "Meditation || The One and the Three Ones\n9.2 The One and the Three Ones\n\nMeditation practices focused on the principle of Unity are known as\n\u201cguarding Unity\u201d or \u201cguarding the One\u201d\n(shouyi), an expression analogous in meaning to\n\u201cembracing Unity\u201d (baoyi) found in the Daode\njing (sec. 10 and 22). In his famous speech to the Yellow\nEmperor, recorded in the Zhuangzi, Guangcheng zi says,\n\u201cI guard this Unity and thus abide in this harmony\u201d (ch.\n11; Watson 1968: 120).\n\nWhile in these examples \u201cguarding Unity\u201d refers to the\nconstant awareness of the One as the principle of the many, in later times the\nsame expression designates meditation practices based on the\nvisualization of the One as an anthropomorphic inner deity. A\nclassical description is found in the Baopu zi, where Ge Hong\nreckons \u201cguarding the One\u201d as the superior way of\ntranscendence together with the ingestion of elixirs. The main\npractice consists in visualizing the features that the One as a god\ntakes within the human being as it moves among the three Cinnabar\nFields. Meditation on the One as an inner god is also described in the\nLaozi zhongjing and in the Dadong zhenjing.\nLater,\nthis practice evolved into \u201cguarding the Three Ones\u201d\n(shou sanyi), which again exists in several varieties\n(Andersen 1979; Robinet 1993: 119\u201338). For instance, the Three\nOnes are represented as three children who live in the\nCinnabar Fields. Another practice combines external and\ninternal aspects: after visualizing the descent of the\nNorthern Dipper above his head, the adept sees the Three Ones emerging\namong its stars; he breaths three times, and each time one of the\nThree Ones reaches its residence in the respective Cinnabar Field.\n",
