    "main_text": "Reference and Propositions\n5. Reference and Propositions\n\nNote that Socrates was a wise, snub-nosed philosopher, who happened to\nbe Plato\u2019s finest teacher. From this story, we can infer that\n\u201cSocrates was wise\u201d is true and, we might reasonably\nsuppose, it expresses a (true) proposition, <Socrates was wise>.\nSimilarly, we can take it that \u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise\u201d is also true and it expresses a (true) proposition,\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise>. [See the entry\non\n propositions.]\n\nSome preliminary observations. Both propositions exist; they are true\nand so they must exist in order to be true. (Assuming something like\n\u201cserious actualism\u201d, see above.) Equally, both\npropositions are about the very same individual, Socrates, though\nthere\u2019s a sense in which <Socrates was wise> is about\nSocrates more thoroughly (more intimately) than <Plato\u2019s\nfinest teacher was wise> is about him. Indeed, it seems that\n<Socrates was wise> is \u201cdirectly\u201d about Socrates,\nwhereas <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is only\n\u201cindirectly\u201d about him. <Socrates was wise> cannot\nfail to be about Socrates; it determines Socrates, the same\nindividual, in all possible contexts. But, by contrast,\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is about Socrates only\naccidentally, only in virtue of the contingent fact that Socrates was\nPlato\u2019s finest teacher.\n\nFurther, note that the sentence \u201cSocrates was wise\u201d, which\nexpresses <Socrates was wise>, contains a proper name\n(\u201cSocrates\u201d). And, suppose that this directly refers to\nSocrates. By contrast, \u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise\u201d, which expresses <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise>, contains a description (\u201cPlato\u2019s finest\nteacher\u201d). We might suppose that this doesn\u2019t directly\nrefer to Socrates, nor does it determine him in all possible contexts.\nConsider, for example, the possible scenario in which Socrates never\nencountered Plato. In this context, Plato\u2019s finest teacher would\nhave been a distinct individual and the corresponding description\n\u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher\u201d would pick out that\nindividual. As such, <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise>\nwould not be about Socrates and the truth of the proposition\nwouldn\u2019t depend upon any facts about him. What unites both cases\nis reference; what divides them is the direct or indirect character of\nhow the expressions refer. Typically, reference is construed as a\nrelation that obtains between language and reality (between linguistic\nitems and things in the world). [See the entry on\n reference.]\n And, again: for two things to be so related, both things (both\nrelata) must exist.\n\nIn defending presentism, we face a problem of direct reference with\nrespect to merely past entities. (Although, on one reading, it\u2019s\nmerely an instance of the problem of \u201ccross-time\nrelations\u201d introduced in\n \u00a74.)\n It seems that we can and do refer successfully to entities that have\nexisted and exist no longer, entities that don\u2019t exist at all,\ngiven presentism. But, if this is so, then the past entities that we\nrefer to (and which are related to our linguistic items) must exist,\ncontrary to presentism. Presentists face a difficult choice. That is,\nthey must reject one of the following four claims, which form an\napparently inconsistent set: (i) we successfully refer to merely past\nentities, (ii) reference is a relation, (iii) for a relation to\nobtain, the relata must exist, and (iv) there are no merely past\nentities (i.e., past entities don\u2019t exist). Presentists\ncan\u2019t deny (iv), since that amounts to a rejection of\npresentism. But it proves almost equally difficult to reject any of\nthe other claims, given their independent plausibility.\n",
