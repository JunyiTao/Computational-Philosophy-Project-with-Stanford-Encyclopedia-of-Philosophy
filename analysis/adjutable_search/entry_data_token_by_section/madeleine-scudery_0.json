    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nBorn in Le Havre on November 15, 1607, Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry was\nborn into a minor Norman aristocratic family, often dismissed as\nbourgeois by her critics. Her later efforts to conquer the\naristocratic and court society of Paris often appeared tied to\ninsecurity concerning her familial rank. Orphaned at the age of six,\nScud\u00e9ry entered into the care of her uncle, an ecclesiastic who\nprovided her with an extensive education. She studied reading,\nwriting, drawing, painting, music, and dancing. She received\ninstruction in the practical arts of medicine, agriculture, and\ndomestic economy. Her most notable achievement was mastery of Spanish\nand Italian; the domestic library featured numerous volumes written in\neach language. A voracious reader, she discovered the epic serial\nnovels which would become her preferred literary genre as an author.\nScud\u00e9ry also began her philosophical initiation with the\nreading of Montaigne, who would influence her later sympathy with\nskepticism, and Plutarch (in the French translation by Jacques Amyot),\nwho introduced her to the Stoic philosophy of reason, will, and\nvirtue.\n\nIn 1637 Scud\u00e9ry joined her brother Georges at his residence in\nParis. A burgeoning playwright, Georges introduced his sister to the\nliterary salons of Paris. Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry quickly\nbecame a frequent guest at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, where\nCatherine de Vivonne presided over her salon, the celebrated\nchambre bleue [blue room]. Notable salon authors included\nPierre\n Corneille,[1]\n Jean-Louis Guez de\n Balzac,[2]\n Valentin\n Conrart,[3]\n Jean\n Chapelain,[4]\n Gilles\n M\u00e9nage,[5]\n Mademoiselle de\n Montpensier,[6]\n Madame de\n S\u00e9vign\u00e9,[7]\n Madame de\n Lafayette,[8]\n and Catherine\n Descartes.[9]\n Although eclectic in their philosophy, several authors evinced a\nclear sympathy for moral libertinism. In later writings, the salon\nlibertine would often serve as the object of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\ncensure.\n\nDuring the Rambouillet years, Scud\u00e9ry launched her own literary\ncareer. Printed under the name of her brother Georges, she published\nan historical novel, Ibrahim or the Ilustrious Basa, in 1641\nand Illustrious Women or Heroic Harangues in 1642. With the\npublication of Artam\u00e8ne or the Great Cyrus, a novel\nprinted in ten volumes from 1648 until 1653, Mademoiselle de\nScud\u00e9ry acquired literary fame. One of the world\u2019s\nlongest novels, containing more than two million words, the work\nattracted a broad European reading public still avid for serial\nhistorical romances. Although it is set in ancient Assyria, the work\nwas clearly a roman-\u00e0-clef which depicted various\nmembers of Rambouillet\u2019s literary circle through pseudonyms.\nScud\u00e9ry herself appears under the title of Sappho. Now an\nacclaimed author, Scud\u00e9ry participated enthusiastically in the\ncapital\u2019s literary quarrels. In 1651 she was involved in a\ndispute over the relative merits of Isaac de Benserade\u2019s sonnet\nJob and Vincent Voiture\u2019s sonnet\n Urania.[10]\n In political disputes, Scud\u00e9ry remained faithful to the French\ncrown. During the Fronde (1648\u201353), the intermittent\ncivil war opposing old aristocratic families and the Parisian\nparliament to the monarchy, Scud\u00e9ry sided with the throne,\ndespite her personal admiration for the women who had led the military\nresistance to the Bourbons in certain areas of the country. Her\nroyalist sympathies would later harden into an admiration of Louis XIV\nthat bordered on sycophancy.\n\nIn 1653 Madeleine and Georges Scud\u00e9ry established a new\nresidence in the Marais neighborhood of Paris. It is here that\nMademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry conducted her famous Saturday salon:\nthe samedis, where a large literary circle assembled to\ndiscuss disputed questions, especially those concerning the nature of\nlove. The writings of Montaigne, Pierre Charron, and Marguerite de\nNavarre were discussed in the debates on the nature of true\n friendship.[11]\n Prominent participants in the salon included Madame de\n Sabl\u00e9,[12]\n Madame de Lafayette, Madame Scarron (the future Madame de\n Maintenon),[13]\n Valentin Conrart, Paul\n Pellisson,[14]\n Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\n Sarasin,[15]\n Gilles M\u00e9nage, Jean Chapelain, and Antoine Gombaud, chevalier\nde\n M\u00e9r\u00e9.[16]\n Many of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophical dialogues reflect\nM\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s ideal of honn\u00eatet\u00e9,\nthe virtue of decency, fairness, and tolerance, especially in the\nrealm of disputed ideas. Salonni\u00e8res debated the\n\u201cnew philosophy\u201d of Descartes; Scud\u00e9ry opposed the\nmechanistic theory of matter in Cartesianism. \n\nScud\u00e9ry continued to work as a prolific author. The ten-volume\nCl\u00e9lie or a Roman History (1654\u201361) contained\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s most celebrated passage, the Carte de\nTendre, a map of love, which describes the various obstacles\n(depicted as rivers, deserts, and mountains) affection must overcome\nas it attempts to reach the summit of spiritual love. Sensing the\npublic\u2019s disaffection for the older serial novels,\nScud\u00e9ry published several novellas: C\u00e9linte\n(1661), Mathilde d\u2019Aguilar (1667), and Promenade at\nVersailles (1669). Later in life, Scud\u00e9ry published her\nmost philosophical works. Labeled as \u201cconversations,\u201d\nthese works were a series of dialogues presenting the philosophical\nand literary issues commonly debated in the salons; the anthologies\ncontained dialogues extracted from the earlier novels, reworked\ndialogues, and dialogues created expressly for the new collections.\nThe works included Conversations on Different Subjects\n(1680), New Conversations on Different Subjects (1684),\nMoral Conversations (1686), New Moral Conversations\n(1688), and Moral Dialogues (1692).\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s prolific authorship and influential salon\nbrought her numerous honors. The Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\nawarded her its first literary prize for her essay On Glory\nin\n 1671.[17]\n The Academy of the Ricovrati in Padua elected her to membership in\n1684. But opponents strongly contested the literary and intellectual\nworth of Scud\u00e9ry. Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Les\nPr\u00e9cieuses ridicules (1659), Fureti\u00e8re\u2019s\nLe Roman bourgeois (1666), and Boileau\u2019s Satire\nX (1667) mocked Scud\u00e9ry as the model\n pr\u00e9cieuse.[18]\n According to this caricature, Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s erudition was\npedantry, her profligacy redundancy, her philosophical theories\nsecond-hand and incoherent. This dismissal of Scud\u00e9ry as a\nrisible arriviste would long dominate her image among\nliterary critics and close her books to generations of potential\nreaders.\n\nMademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry died on June 2, 1701. She was interred\nin the Parisian church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs.\n",
