Introduction to \u201cHeidegger\u2019s Aesthetics\u201d:  Beyond the Oxymoron\n\n\nPerhaps the first thing to be said about \u201cHeidegger\u2019s\naesthetics\u201d is that Heidegger himself would consider the very\ntopic oxymoronic, a contradiction in terms like the idea of a\n\u201csquare circle,\u201d \u201cwooden iron,\u201d or a\n\u201cChristian philosopher\u201d (Heidegger\u2019s own three\nfavorite examples of\n oxymorons).[1]\nTreating Heidegger\u2019s\nthinking about art as \u201caesthetics\u201d would strike him as\nincongruous and inappropriate because he consistently insisted that the\n\u201caesthetic\u201d approach has led Western humanity to understand\nand experience the work of art in a way that occludes its true\nhistorical significance. Nor can Heidegger\u2019s thinking be\nsympathetically classified as \u201canti-aesthetic,\u201d because he\nsuggests that any such anti-aesthetics would remain blindly entangled\nin aesthetics (in the same way that, for example, atheism remains\nimplicated in the logic of theism\u2014both claiming to know the\nunknowable); in his view, any merely oppositional movement remains\ntrapped in the logic of what it opposes (QCT 61/GA5 217). For\nHeidegger, as we will see, the only way to get beyond aesthetics is\nfirst to understand how it shapes us and then seek to pass through and\nbeyond that influence, thereby getting over it as one might\n\u201crecover\u201d from a serious illness (ID 37/101). Because\nthe aesthetic approach continues to eclipse our access to the role\nartworks can quietly play in forming and informing our historical\nworlds, Heidegger thinks that only such a post-aesthetic thinking about\nart can allow us to recognize and restore art\u2019s true\nsignificance, helping us recognize the inconspicuous way in which art\nworks to shape our basic sense of what is and what\n matters.[2]\n\n\nFrom a strictly Heideggerian perspective, then, any attempt to\nexplain \u201cHeidegger\u2019s aesthetics\u201d (or his\n\u201canti-aesthetics\u201d) will look either malicious or\nmisconceived, like a deliberate flaunting or else an unwitting\ndisplay of ignorance about the basic tenets of Heidegger\u2019s views\non art. Fortunately, our starting point is not really so\nmisconceived. Once we understand why exactly Heidegger\ncriticizes (what we could call) the aestheticization of\nart, we will thereby have put ourselves on the right track to\nunderstanding his own post-aesthetic thinking about the work of\nart. (We should not confuse the aestheticization Heidegger\ncritiques with \u201caestheticism,\u201d a term standardly taken to\nrefer to the \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d\n movement.[3]\nFor\nHeidegger, any such attempt to disconnect art from politics,\nphilosophy, and other history-shaping movements would not even be\nthinkable without the prior reduction of art to aesthetics that he\ncriticizes.) So, what exactly is supposed to be wrong with the\naestheticization of art? What leads Heidegger to critique the\ndominant modern tradition that understands art in an\n\u201caesthetic\u201d way, and why does he believe this aesthetic\napproach eclipses the true significance of the work of art?\n",
