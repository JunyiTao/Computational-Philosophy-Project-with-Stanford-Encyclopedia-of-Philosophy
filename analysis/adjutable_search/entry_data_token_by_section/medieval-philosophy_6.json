    "main_text": "Styles of Medieval Philosophy || Kal\u0101m\n2.4 Kal\u0101m\n\nA century before al-Kind\u012b, a different style of philosophizing\nhad grown up in the Islamic world:\n kal\u0101m.[12]\n It has, indeed, been suggested that falsafa originated as a\nrival to kal\u0101m\u2014claiming to be a better way of\nexplaining the world than it could offer. Kal\u0101m was\nbased on problems suggested by the Quran, but it was also inspired by\nthe need to defend Islamic doctrine against philosophically based\nattacks by Christians and may have been informed by some ideas from\nthe ancient Greek tradition. The dominant school of\nkal\u0101m in the ninth century were the Mu\u02bftazilites.\nThey were very confident in the ability of human reason to reach moral\ntruth, to which, they held, God\u2019s justice must\n correspond.[13]\n They strongly emphasized God\u2019s unity and, in common with other\nkal\u0101m thinkers, developed an atomistic, materialistic\nphysics, very different from Aristotle\u2019s picture of a stable\nworld of substances belonging to natural kinds. A Jewish version of\nkal\u0101m is found in the work of\n Saadya\n (882\u2013942).[14]\n\nAl-Ash\u2018ar\u012b (d. 935/6) changed the direction of\nkal\u0101m. He stressed the absolute omnipotence of God, who,\nhe said, from instant to instant is responsible for the arrangement of\nthe atoms, and for human will and action. A century later, however,\nal-Juwayn\u012b (1028\u201385) began to introduce Avicennian notions\ninto kal\u0101m. His pupil,\n al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\n (1058\u20131111) went far further.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b studied kal\u0101m theology, Avicennian\nphilosophy and Sufism, a type of Islamic mysticism, and he wrote about\nthem all, as well as being one of the greatest Muslim legal theorists.\nAmong these writings are not just The Intentions of the\nPhilosophers, based on Avicenna\u2019s shortest philosophical\nencyclopaedia (in Persian), but The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, directed against falsafa as presented by\nAvicenna. This book was very influential, and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nused to be thought of as a diehard enemy of philosophy, who helped to\nbring about the end of philosophizing in the Islamic world. In fact,\nhowever, there are just three doctrines on which al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nconvicts Avicenna and his followers of heresy: the eternity of the\nworld\n (\u00a73.1),\n the restriction of God\u2019s knowledge to universals and the denial\nof the bodily resurrection\n (\u00a73.3).\n His critique thus showed that, in general, so long as these\nconclusions are avoided, Avicennian philosophy is acceptable for\nMuslims. Indeed, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b himself accepted it, but with\ntwo important further changes. God, he insists, has will and is\ncapable of real choices between alternatives. Moreover\u2014and this\nis the central point of the Incoherence\u2014the\nphilosophers such as Avicenna do not, as they claim\n (\u00a72.3),\n provide demonstrative knowledge, because the starting points for\ntheir arguments are not all self-evident. Like the theologians, their\nreasoning is dialectical (Griffel 2009).\n",
