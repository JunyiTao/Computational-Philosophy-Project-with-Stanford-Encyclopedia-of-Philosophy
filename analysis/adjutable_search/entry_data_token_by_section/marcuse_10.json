One-Dimensional Thinking and the Democratic Rejection of Democracy\n\n\nThe first chapter of One-Dimensional Man begins with the\nfollowing sentence:\n\n\nA comfortable, smooth, reasonable, democratic unfreedom prevails in\nadvanced industrial civilization, a token of technical\nprogress. (Marcuse 1964: 1)\n\n\nOne-Dimensional Man is a further analysis of the worry at the\ncenter of Reason and Revolution, the whittling down of\ncritical or negative thinking. As we saw earlier, negative thinking is\ntwo-dimensional as it sees the contradictions by which society is\nconstituted, and it is aware of forces of domination.  The person who\nthinks critically demands social change. One-dimensional thinking\ndoes not demand change nor does it recognize the degree to which the\nindividual is a victim of forces of domination in society.  \n\nThe idea of a democratic unfreedom refers to the free acceptance of\noppression and surplus repression. In One-Dimensional\nMan and in Eros and Civilization, Marcuse makes a decisive\nmove beyond Marx and Freud in his explanation of the containment of\nsocial change. He uses Freud to go beyond Marx insofar as Freud\nhelps us understand the psychological mechanisms at work in individuals\nwho accept surplus repression. However, he goes beyond Freud\ninsofar as Freud\u2019s theory of the super ego is obsolete. \nThat is, in Freud\u2019s theory, the super ego develops through the\ninternalization of the values of some authority figure. According\nto Marcuse, the authority figure is no longer needed. The super\nego has become depersonalized and is no longer fed by authority figures\nsuch as the father, ministers, teachers, the principle, etc. He\nwrites:\n\n\nBut these personal father-images have gradually disappeared behind the\ninstitutions. With the rationalization of the productive apparatus,\nwith the multiplication of functions, all domination assumes the form\nof administration. (Marcuse 1955: 98) \n\nMarcuse\u2019s point is that domination no longer requires force or\nthe presence of an authority figure. The function of\none-dimensional thinking is to produce a one-dimensional society by\nwhittling down critical, two-dimensional consciousness. This is\naccomplished in several ways which will simply be listed here. \n \n\nThe system must make the citizens think that they are freer than they\nreally are.\nThe system must provide the citizens with enough goods to keep\nthem pacified.\nThe citizens must identify with their\noppressors. \nPolitical discourse must be eliminated.\n\n\n\nThere is not enough space here to examine each of these. One example\nshould suffice. It was shown earlier that the purpose of dialectical\nor negative thinking was to reveal social contradictions and demand\nthe overcoming of those contradictions through social\nchange. One-dimensional thinking smoothes over these contradictions\nand makes them invisible. A form of ideology is put in place where the\noppressed identifies with the oppressor.  People feel a sense of unity\nsimply because they watch the same TV programs, or support the same\nsport teams. In politics, vague terms are used such as \"the American\npeople\" or \"the American way of life\" to hide the very different ways\nthat people in America actually experience America. The American way\nof life differs greatly between rich and poor Americans. \n Another example of one-dimensional thinking is the subject of\nMarcuse\u2019s famous and controversial essay \u201cRepressive\nTolerance\u201d. Here, Marcuse shows how terms, ideas, or concepts\nthat have their origin in struggles for liberation can be co-opted and\nused to legitimate oppression. The concept of tolerance was once used\nas a critical concept by marginalized social groups. According to\nMarcuse, the term is now used by the Establishment to legitimate its\nown oppressive views and policies. It is the idea of pure tolerance or\ntolerance for the sake of tolerance that ignores the real concrete\nsocial conflict out of which the concept emerged. Rather than pure\ntolerance, Marcuse calls for \u201cdiscriminating tolerance\u201d\n(Marcuse 1968a: 123).\n",
