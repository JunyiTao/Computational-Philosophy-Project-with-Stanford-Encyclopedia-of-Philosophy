    "main_text": "The Status of Instrumental Rationality || Hume on Instrumental Rationality\n4.3 Hume on Instrumental Rationality\n\nThe thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality is often taken to be a \u201cHumean\u201d thesis,\nthough, as we\u2019ve seen\n (\u00a74.1),\n there are several ways in which this thesis could be understood. One\ncould take the thesis just to be an assertion of the Desire-Based\nTheory. One could also take the thesis to specify that instrumental\ncoherence is the only requirement of practical rationality. However,\nit is doubtful that Hume held either of these views.\n\nThere are some passages which might seem to suggest these views. In\nBook II of the Treatise (1739\u201340), Hume denies that a\nperson\u2019s ends, however immoral or imprudent, can be unreasonable\n(\u201ccontrary to reason,\u201d to use his exact phrase) if\nthey\u2019re not based on a false belief:\n\nWhere a passion is neither founded on false suppositions, nor chuses\nmeans insufficient for the end, the understanding can neither justify\nnor condemn it. \u2019Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the\ndestruction of the world to the scratching of my finger. \u2019Tis\nnot contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the\nleast uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me.\n\u2019Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own\nacknowledg\u2019d lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent\naffection for the former than the latter. (p. 416)\n\n\nHere he seems to claim that one\u2019s choosing means insufficient\nfor one\u2019s end can be deemed unreasonable, even though the end\nitself is not subject to such rational assessment.\n\nHowever, this wouldn\u2019t support the Desire-Based Theory, since\nthe Desire-Based Theory allows that ends can be unreasonable when they\ndon\u2019t promote the satisfaction of one\u2019s strongest, present\nintrinsic desires. For instance, choosing one\u2019s total ruin, when\ndoing so runs counter to one\u2019s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesires, even when doing so isn\u2019t based on a false belief, can\nbe criticized as unreasonable on the Desire-Based Theory.\n\nSoon after this passage, Hume is careful to note that it\nwouldn\u2019t be one\u2019s intending of means insufficient\nfor one\u2019s ends that\u2019s unreasonable, but the false\nbelief on which this intention is based. For example, when I\nfalsely believe that staying on 95N will get me to Memphis, which is\nwhere I intend to go, and so I intend to stay on 95N, it\u2019s my\nbelief that 95N will get me to Memphis that\u2019s unreasonable, not\nthe intention, based on this belief, to stay on 95N.\n\nWhy did Hume think this? Hume holds that \u201creason is the\ndiscovery of truth and falsehood\u201d (p. 458). Since beliefs aim to\ncorrectly represent the world\u2014and the beliefs that succeed in\nrepresenting the world are true, while the beliefs that fail to do so\nare false\u2014they can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\nBut passions, as well as intentions and actions, are \u201coriginal\nexistences.\u201d They don\u2019t purport to represent or\n\u201ccopy\u201d some other \u201cexistence\u201d (p. 415).\nSpecifically, they don\u2019t aim to correctly represent the world,\nand so they can\u2019t be true or false. Hence, they can\u2019t be\nassessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\n\nIn light of such considerations, many philosophers have argued that\nHume doesn\u2019t endorse an instrumentalist conception of practical\nreason, but instead, more radically, is a skeptic about all of\npractical reason. (See, for instance, Hampton 1995; Millgram 1995;\nKorsgaard 1997. For objections to this skeptical interpretation of\nHume, see Setiya 2004.) On this interpretation, Hume acknowledges the\nexistence of requirements of theoretical reason, since\nbeliefs can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable, but is\nskeptical about the existence of requirements of practical\nreason, including instrumental reason, since desires, intentions, and\nactions can\u2019t be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable. (Even a\npreference for \u201cone\u2019s own acknowledg\u2019d lesser\ngood\u201d wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable, on his view.) Since, on\nthis interpretation, Hume was skeptical about practical reason in\ngeneral, we can\u2019t appeal to his view to establish a special\nplace for instrumental rationality among the requirements of practical\nrationality.\n\nVarious challenges could be raised against Hume\u2019s rather narrow\nconception of reason. But our primary interest here is in whether Hume\ncan provide us with a plausible account of instrumental\nrationality. On Hume\u2019s view, our intentions are subject to\nrational criticism when, and only when, they are based on false\nbeliefs (and, again, it\u2019s the belief that\u2019s to blame,\nstrictly speaking). As an account of instrumental rationality,\nHume\u2019s view would face two serious objections.\n\nFirst, it seems that one can be instrumentally irrational without\nhaving any intentions based on false beliefs (or lacking any\nintentions because of false beliefs). John Broome provides an example:\nsuppose I know the hotel is on fire and that the only escape involves\nmy intending to go through the open window, and, though I intend to\nlive, I sit on the windowsill singing happily until the flames consume\nme. This is a clear case of instrumental irrationality, despite my not\nhaving any false beliefs (Broome 1997). Indeed, one could fail to\nintend the means believed necessary for one\u2019s ends because of\nrage, depression, distraction, grief, or other causes which\ndon\u2019t necessarily involve any false beliefs (Korsgaard 1986).\nHume would have to conclude either that such cases are impossible, or\nthat they involve no instrumental irrationality.\n\nSecond, it seems that one can have intentions based on false beliefs\nwithout being instrumentally irrational, or irrational in any other\nway. Instrumental rationality, as it\u2019s usually understood, is a\nrequirement of coherence governing one\u2019s intentions and\nbeliefs\u2014a requirement that is in place regardless of the\ntruth of those beliefs. The person who intends to get to\nMemphis, believes that he must intend to stay on 95N to get there, and\ndoes intend to stay on 95N, displays coherence in his attitudes,\ndespite having a false belief. So, an accusation of instrumental\nirrationality here would be misplaced. (Additionally, it would also be\ninappropriate to accuse him of any theoretical irrationality,\nif we suppose that this belief isn\u2019t inconsistent with any other\nbeliefs he holds, and he also believes there\u2019s conclusive\nevidence for it, and so forth.) Hume would have to conclude either\nthat such cases are impossible, or that they involve instrumental\nirrationality.\n",
