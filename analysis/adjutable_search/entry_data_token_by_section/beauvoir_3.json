    "main_text": "Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as: Radical Freedom and the Other\n4. Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as: Radical Freedom and the Other\n\nPyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as (1944), published one year after\nShe Came To Stay, is Beauvoir\u2019s first philosophical\nessay. It addresses fundamental ethical and political issues, such as:\nWhat are the criteria of ethical action? How can I distinguish ethical\nfrom unethical political projects? What are the principles of ethical\nrelationships? Can violence ever be justified? It examines these\nquestions from an existential-phenomenological perspective. Taking the\nsituation of the concrete existing individual as its point of\ndeparture, Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as provides an analysis of\nthe ways that, as particular subjects, we are necessarily embedded in\nthe world and inescapably related to others. Though not feminist in\nany identifiable sense, this essay raises such compelling feminist\nquestions as: Under what conditions, if any, may I speak for/in the\nname of another?\n\nAfter opening Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as with Plutarch\u2019s\naccount of a conversation between Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as, where the\njustification of action is questioned, Beauvoir, finding the\nrecommendation to be passively inconsistent with the realities of\nhuman nature and desire, asks three questions: What is the measure of\na person? What goals can one set for oneself? What hopes are permitted\nto us? She then divides the text into two parts. Part one moves from\nthe ontological truth\u2014that I am a finite freedom whose endings\nare always and necessarily new beginnings\u2014to the existential\nquestions: How can I desire to be what I am? How can I live my\nfinitude with passion? These existential questions lead to moral and\npolitical ones: What actions express the truth and passion of our\ncondition? How can I act in such a way so as to create the conditions\nthat sustain and support the humanity of human beings? Part I\nconcludes with the observation that: \u201cA man alone in the world\nwould be paralyzed by \u2026 the vanity of all of his goals. But man\nis not alone in the world\u201d (PhilW 115, cf. P&C 42). Beauvoir\nopens Part II with the properly ethical question: What is my relation\nto the other? Here the analysis is dominated by the problem created by\nBeauvoir\u2019s insistence on the radical nature of freedom.\nAccording to Beauvoir, the other, as free, is immune to my power.\nWhatever I do\u2014if as a master I exploit slaves, or as an\nexecutioner I hang murderers\u2014I cannot violate their inner\nsubjective freedom. Making a distinction between freedom as internal\nand the external conditions through which self and other engage,\nBeauvoir argues that we can never directly touch the freedom of\nothers. This inner-outer distinction underscores that our\nrelationships are either superficial, engaging only the outer surface\nof each other\u2019s being, or they are mediated through our common\ncommitment to a shared goal or value.\n\nThis line of argument would seem to lead either to benign Stoic\nconclusions of mutual indifference or to the finding that tyrants and\nterrorists pose no threat to individual freedom. Beauvoir does not,\nhowever, let it drift in these directions. Instead she uses the\ninner-outer distinction and the idea that I need others to take up my\nprojects if they are to have a future, to introduce the ideas of the\nappeal and risk. She develops the concept of freedom as transcendence\n(the movement toward an open future and indeterminate possibilities)\nto argue that we cannot be determined by the present. The essence of\nfreedom as transcendence aligns freedom with uncertainty and risk. To\nbe free is to be radically contingent. Though I find myself in a world\nof value and meaning, these values and meanings were brought into the\nworld by others. I am free to reject, alter or endorse them for the\nmeaning of the world is shaped by human choices. Whatever choice I\nmake, however, I cannot support it without the help of others. My\nvalues will find a home in the world only if others embrace them; only\nif I persuade others to make my values theirs.\n\nSo, as radically free I need the other. I need to be able to appeal to\nothers to join me in my projects. The knot of the ethical problem lies\nhere: How can I, a radically free being who is existentially severed\nfrom all other human freedoms, transcend the isolations of freedom to\ncreate a community of allies? Given the necessity of appealing to the\nother\u2019s freedom, under what conditions is such an appeal\npossible?\n\nIn answering these questions Beauvoir turns the inner-outer\ndistinction to her advantage as she develops the concept of situated\nfreedom. Though I can neither act for another nor directly influence\ntheir freedom, I must, Beauvoir argues, accept responsibility for the\nfact that my actions produce the conditions within which the other\nacts. \u201cI am\u201d, Beauvoir writes, \u201cthe face of the\nother\u2019s misery... I am the facticity of their situation\u201d\n(PhilW 126, cf. P&C 58). Pursuing this difference between my power\nto effect the other\u2019s freedom and my responsibility for their\nsituation, and exploring the conditions under which my appeal to the\nother can/will be heard, Beauvoir determines that there are two\nconditions of the appeal. First, I must be allowed to call to the\nother and I must struggle against those who try to silence me. Second,\nthere must be others who can respond to my call. The first condition\nmay be purely political. The second is political and material because,\nas Beauvoir argues, it is only as peers that others are capable of\nresponding to my call. Only those who are not consumed by the struggle\nfor survival, only those who exist in the material conditions of\nfreedom, health, leisure and security can become my allies in the\nstruggle against injustice. Thus, it is only as equals that the second\ncondition can be met. To achieve such equality, we have to strive to\npursue justice, as only then will the material and political\nconditions of the appeal be secured.\n\nViolence is not ruled out. Given that Beauvoir has argued that we can\nnever reach the other in the depths of their freedom, she cannot call\nviolence evil. She does not, however, endorse violence. Neither does\nshe envision a future without conflict. The fact that we are\ndifferently situated and engage in the work of transcendence from\ndifferent social, historical, and economic positions ensures that some\nof us will always be an obstacle to another\u2019s freedom. \u201cWe\nare\u201d, Beauvoir writes, \u201ccondemned to violence\u201d\n(PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). As neither evil nor avoidable, violence,\nshe argues, is \u201cthe mark of a failure which nothing can\noffset\u201d (PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). It is the tragedy of the\nhuman condition.\n\nThe argument of Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as ends on an uneasy\nnote. As ethical, we are obliged to work for the conditions of\nmaterial and political equality. In calling on others to take up our\nprojects and give these projects a future, we are precluded from\nforcing others to become our allies. We are enjoined to appeal to\ntheir freedom. Where persuasion fails, however, we are permitted the\nrecourse to violence. The ambiguity of our being as subjects for\nourselves and objects for others in the world is lived in this dilemma\nof violence and justice. Becoming lucid about the meaning of freedom,\nwe learn to live our freedom by accepting its finitude and\ncontingency, its risks and its failures.\n",
