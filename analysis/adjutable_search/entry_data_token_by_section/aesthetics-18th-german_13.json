    "main_text": "Herder, Sulzer and Herz: Energy, Activity and Truth || Sulzer\n5.2 Sulzer\n\nHerder is thus no straightforward historicist or cultural\nrelativist. Rather, his convictions that the best art reveals the\ntruth about its world and that there are deep commonalities in human\nemotional responses to such truths allow him to defend the ideal of a\nstandard of or paradigm for taste after all. It will be noted,\nhowever, that throughout Herder\u2019s aesthetics the notion of play has\nhardly figured at all; it has been mentioned only in connection with\nthe superficial art of painting rather than with the deeper arts of\nsculpture, poetry, and even music. For an attempt to combine an\naesthetics of truth with an aesthetics of play that is in some ways\nshallower than Herder\u2019s thought but in other ways an important\ninnovation in German aesthetics, let us now take a look at the work\nof Johann Georg Sulzer (1720\u20131779). He was born a\nquarter-century before Herder but his encyclopedic General Theory\nof the Fine Arts, first published from 1771 to 1774, was\ncontemporaneous with such central works of Herder as the essays on\nOssian and Shakespeare. Sulzer advocates a conventional view of the\nrelation between aesthetic experience and truth: the experience of\nart\u2014although not solely of beautiful art\u2014can make moral\ntruths vivid and efficacious for us, even though we can know those\ntruths independently of art, and indeed must know the most\nfundamental principles of morality independently of art. But he also\nemphasized that aesthetic experience is an intrinsically enjoyable\nand therefore valuable experience of the unhindered activity\nof the mind. His conception of the mind has Leibnizian origins, but\nhis emphasis on the pleasure of its unhindered activity points the\nway toward Kant\u2019s conception of aesthetic experience as the free play\nof the cognitive powers. While Sulzer was generally a more\nconventional thinker than Herder, he here introduces a theme that is\nalmost entirely absent from Herder\u2019s thought and prepares the way for\nKant\u2019s synthesis of two although not all three of the main approaches\nof eighteenth-century aesthetics.\n\n\nSulzer was born in Winthertur, Switzerland, in 1720. Destined for the\nclergy, at sixteen he was boarded with a pastor in Z\u00fcrich and attended\nthe gymnasium there. But at eighteen, he became more interested in the\nstudy of mathematics, botany, and philosophy, and came under the\ninfluence of Bodmer and Breitinger. Sulzer was ordained on the\ncompletion of his studies in 1739, and in 1740 became a tutor in a\nwealthy Z\u00fcrich household. The next year he became a village vicar and\nwas able to devote himself to natural history and archaeology. In 1744\nhe took up a teaching position in Magdeburg, Germany, and in 1747 he\nbecame professor of mathematics at a gymnasium in Berlin. Sulzer was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1750. From that\ntime on he regularly published essays on reason, consciousness, language,\nmaterialism, the immortality of the soul, and the nature and existence\nof God, as well as a lengthy \u201cInvestigation of the original of\nagreeable and disagreeable sentiments\u201d (1751), which first\nstated central themes of his aesthetics. He also published shorter\ntreatments of such topics as genius (1757), the utility of drama, a\nreply to Rousseau\u2019s attack upon the theater (1760), and \u201cEnergy\nin works of fine art\u201d (1765). In 1755 Sulzer published a\ntranslation of Hume\u2019s first Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding, and Hume\u2019s theories of the imagination and the\nmoral sentiments, although not his skepticism, would considerably\ninfluence the further development of Sulzer\u2019s own philosophy.\nAlthough Sulzer himself remained at bottom a loyal Leibnizo-Wolffian,\nhis introduction of Hume into German philosophical discourse prepared\nthe way for Kant\u2019s critique of that philosophy. In 1761, Sulzer began\nwork on his General Theory of the Fine Arts, which was\noriginally planned as a revision of Jacques Lacombe\u2019s Dictionnaire\nportraitif des beaux-arts (1752) but became a vehicle for the\nstatement of Sulzer\u2019s own general views about aesthetics and the moral\nsignificance of art as well an outlet for his vast learning and\nenergy. Sulzer finally published the General Theory in two\nvolumes from 1771 to 1774; especially in the expanded posthumous\neditions by Friedrich von Blankenburg in 1786\u201387 and\n1792\u201394 (Sulzer having died in 1779), this remains a\nvaluable source for the aesthetics of the German Enlightenment and especially for its\nbibliography.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s earliest works in aesthetics concerned nature rather than\nart, but already demonstrated his lifelong concern for the moral\nsignificance of aesthetic experience. In his Conversations on the\nBeauties of Nature (Unterredungen \u00fcber die Sch\u00f6nheiten der\nNatur, 1750), which was republished in 1770 together with his\nearlier Moral Thoughts on the Works of Nature (Versuch\neiniger moralischen Gedanken \u00fcber die Werke der Natur, 1745),\nSulzer analyzed the benefits of the enjoyment of natural beauty in a\nway that prefigured his subsequent complex analysis of the value of\nart. In the first conversation he argued that the contemplation of\nnatural beauty has a calming and moderating influence on our\npassions. The remaining conversations argue that the contemplation of\nthe order of nature proves to us that its existence cannot have been a\nmatter of chance, and that its beauty gives us palpable evidence of\nthe wisdom and benevolence of its creator. This analysis foreshadows\nSulzer\u2019s later position that the enjoyment of art is of immediate\nmoral value because it directly contributes to our happiness, which is\nthe ultimate object of morality, and is also of indirect moral value\nbecause it can enliven and thereby make more effective our knowledge\nof the general precepts of morality, and is indeed the best instrument\nfor that end.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s mature aesthetics is firmly grounded in his generally\nLeibnizo-Wolffian metaphysics and psychology as well as in his\nWolffian moral philosophy. The central tenets of his metaphysics and\npsychology are that the human mind is essentially representational, so\nthat desire and will as well as cognition are forms of representation,\nand that the ultimate source of all of our pleasurable sentiments is\nthe unhindered activity of our capacity for representation.\nConversely, the fundamental source of disagreeable sentiments is the\nrestriction of our representational activity. Sulzer\u2019s morality is a\nWolffian form of utilitarianism, according to which the goal of the\nmoral life is happiness. Thus, whatever contributes to happiness is at\nleast prima facie good. Aesthetic experience is a variety of\nfree and unhindered activity of our representational capacity, and\ntherefore produces pleasurable sentiments which are a primary\nconstituent of happiness. In that way, aesthetic experience is of\ndirect moral value. But works of art also enliven our abstract\nknowledge of moral precepts and make them effective on our action, so\naesthetic experience is also of indirect moral value. Sulzer\u2019s\nmorality might seem egocentric, but he forestalls such an objection by\nan argument that normal human beings naturally desire for others what\nthey desire for themselves, and naturally recognize the right of\nothers to that for which they claim a right for themselves\n(\u201cPsychological Considerations,\u201d p.  287). Thus those who\ndesire happiness for themselves naturally desire it for others as\nwell, and those who desire happiness in the form of the pleasure of\naesthetic experience for themselves will naturally desire it for\nothers as well. However, Sulzer also recognizes that art can be put to\nperverse and immoral use as well as healthy and good use, thus while\nart can contribute to morality both directly and indirectly we must\nalso have an independent grasp of and commitment to the fundamental\nprinciples of morality in order to make sure that aesthetic\nexperience\u2019s natural tendency to morally good outcomes is not\nperverted.\n\n\nWorking within the tradition of Wolff and Baumgarten, Sulzer bases his\naesthetics on the premise that the experience of beauty is founded on\nthe sensuous perception of perfection. Perfection consists in the rich\nvariety of a manifold on the one hand and its unity on the other but\nalso in a third element, namely the \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d\nof what a thing is \u201cwith what it ought to be, or of the real\nwith the ideal\u201d (\u201cVollkommenheit\u201d\n(\u201cPerfection\u201d) in Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen\nK\u00fcnste, volume IV, pp. 688\u20139, at p. 688).  He thus allows\nfor no conception of perfection without a concept of purpose. Kant\nwill subsequently reject the assumption that we must have a conception\nof the purpose of an object in order to make a (pure) judgment of\nbeauty about it. But Sulzer himself already departs from the purely\nWolffian conception that the experience of beauty consists simply in a\nclear but obscure recognition of the perfection of an object relative\nto a conception of its purpose because he holds that the experience of\nthe beauty of an object is an awareness of its effect on our\nrepresentational faculty rather than an awareness of\nthe cause of that effect in the object. Thus the experience\nof beauty becomes the sensation or sentiment (Empfindung)\ncaused by the perfection of the object, rather than a clear but\nindistinct cognition of that perfection.  The real object of pleasure\nthen becomes the activity of one\u2019s own representational state,\nmanifested in the form of sentiment, that is caused by the perfection\nof the beautiful object. This is Sulzer\u2019s decisive modification of the\nLeibnizo-Wolffian approach to aesthetics, not to be found in\nBaumgarten nor in Herder. However, from this\ninnovation Sulzer does not draw the conclusion that Kant subsequently\nwill, namely, that there can be no general rules for beauty. On the\ncontrary, in his view the causal relation between perfection in the\nobject and the pleasurable sentiments of activity in the subject is\nprecisely the sort of relation that gives rise to rules, although such\nrules will be fairly general rather than very specific.\n\n\nIn holding that the real source of our pleasure in beautiful objects\nis our sensation of our own representational activity Sulzer is led\nto identify aesthetically valuable forms of sentiment that are not\ncaused by beauty at all. In fact, he argues that the fine arts must\narouse the full range of human sentiments, even sentiments of\nugliness (although, unlike Lessing, he does not distinguish among the\nfine arts in this regard) (\u201cH\u00e4\u00dflich\u201d\n(\u201cUgly\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume II,\npp. 457\u20139). But even before he reaches that conclusion, his\ntheory of beauty makes the nature and aims of art more complex than\nthey might initially seem. Sulzer employs a trifold division of\nthings that please us that is not dissimilar to Kant\u2019s subsequent\ndistinction between the agreeable, the good, and the beautiful. He\ndistinguishes between things that please us \u201ceven if we do not\nhave the least conception of the constitution\u201d or means by\nwhich they do that, things that please us only if we have \u201ca\ndistinct representation of their constitution,\u201d and things that\nplease us because \u201cthe constitution of the objects charms our\nattention,\u201d but where we \u201csense a satisfaction in them\nbefore we cognize them distinctly, before we know what they ought to\nbe.\u201d The last of these is what comprise the \u201cclass of the\nbeautiful properly speaking,\u201d while the former\ncorrespond to Kant\u2019s classes of the agreeable and the good\nrespectively (\u201cSch\u00f6n\u201d\n(\u201cBeautiful\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume IV,\npp. 305\u201319, at p. 306). Then Sulzer makes a further\ndistinction. Because of his inclusion of purposiveness in his\nconception of perfection, he argues that the perfect can please us\n\u201ceither because of its material, or because of its external\nform, or through its inner constitution, by means of which it is an\ninstrument or means for the achievement of some final end\u201d\n(ibid., p. 307). Correspondingly, there is a distinction between the\npleasure that we may take in superficial beauty of the form and\nmatter of an object, and the deeper pleasure that we take when an\nobject also has \u201cinner worth.\u201d \u201cA higher species of\nbeauty arises from the close unification of the perfect, the\nbeautiful, and the good. This arouses not merely satisfaction, but\ntrue inner pleasure, which often empowers the entire soul, and the\nenjoyment of which is happiness\u201d (ibid., pp.  309\u201310). On\nSulzer\u2019s account, a beauty that appeals to the full range of our\ncognitive and emotional capacities through its purposiveness as well\nas its form is a \u201chigher species\u201d of beauty than one that\nappeals to our sense of form alone.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s conception of the two levels of beauty also leads him to an\naccount of the \u201cideal of beauty\u201d that may have been a\nsource for Kant\u2019s later discussion of that concept, which will in turn\nbe criticized by Friedrich Schiller (see section 8).  According to\nSulzer,\nthat the human form [Gestalt] is the most\nbeautiful of all visible objects does not need to be proved\u2026The\nstrongest, the most noble, and the most blessed sentiments of which\nthe human mind is capable are effects of this\nbeauty. (\u201cSch\u00f6nheit\u201d\n(\u201cBeauty\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume IV,\npp. 319\u201327, at pp.  319\u201320)\n\n\nThe \u201cexternal form of the inner character\nof a human being\u201d (ibid., p. 322) is the ideal of beauty, when\nthe beauty of that external form expresses the goodness of the\ninternal character; correspondingly, the external expression of inner\nevil is the most hateful form of appearance. Like Herder, Sulzer\nrecognizes that the variety of human tastes in both form and more\nsubstantial matters of morality means that different individuals and\npeoples will find both different external forms beautiful and\ndifferent characters good, thus leading to differences in their ideals\nof beauty. But he is confident of the general principle that\n\u201cevery human being holds that to be most beautiful whose form\nannounces to the eye of the judge the most perfect and best human\nbeing\u201d (ibid., p. 320). This illustrates his general conception\nof the force of rules of taste: they express underlying commonalities\nin the etiology of human preferences without entailing complete\nagreement about particulars.\n\n\nSulzer also develops a complex theory of the value of fine art. Fine\nart aims to produce pleasure both by setting our cognitive powers into\nactivity through the formal and material beauties of its products and\nby arousing our deepest feelings. Since the aim of morality is human\nhappiness, art has immediate moral value just because it sets our\nmental powers into enjoyable activity.  But its ability to arouse our\nemotions also gives art indirect moral value through its capacity to\nenliven and make effective our otherwise abstract and not always\nefficacious acknowledgement of the general precepts of morality. Thus,\nin such a statement as that \u201cthe essence\u201d of art\nconsists in the fact that it impresses the objects\nof our representation with sensible force, its end is the lively\naffection [R\u00fchrung] of our minds, and in its application it\naims at the elevation of the spirit and the heart, (\u201cK\u00fcnste;\nSch\u00f6ne K\u00fcnste\u201d (\u201cArts; Fine Arts\u201d) Allgemeine\nTheorie, volume III, pp. 72\u201395, at p. 75),\n\n\nSulzer clearly indicates that art has immediate\nvalue in its vivification of our sensory and cognitive powers as well\nas the value of its power to elevate our spirit and heart and thereby\nmake morality efficacious for us. To be sure, he often emphasizes the\nlatter aspect of the value of art more than the former; for example,\nhe writes\nThe fine arts also use their charms in order to\ndraw our attention to the good and to affect us with love for it. Only\nthrough this application does it become important to the human race\nand deserve the attention of the wise and the support of\nregents. (ibid., p. 76)\n\n\nIn a time and place where Calvinism and Pietism\nstill questioned the value of the fine arts, it may have been\nnecessary for him to emphasize the value of art for enlivening our\nmoral precepts over his theory that morality itself aims at a kind of\nhappiness in which the pleasures of the fine arts play a direct and\nmajor r\u00f4le. But the latter is as much a part of his thought as the\nformer.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s more conventional view that the fine arts serve morality by\nenlivening our moral feelings explains his recognition of the value of\nthe ugly as well as the beautiful in art: our sentiments of ugliness\nneed to be aroused in order to strengthen our aversion to the evil\njust as our sentiments of beauty need to be aroused in order to\nstrengthen our attraction to the good. But Sulzer also recognizes that\nthe emotional power of art means that it can be made into a tool for\nevil as well as for good, especially in the political arena. For\nexample, a leader\nwho does not have sufficiently secure power in his\nhands turns to the efforts of his artists in order to clothe his\ntyranny with agreeableness; and by this means the attention of that\npart of the populace which is merely passive is turned away from\nfreedom and directed toward mere entertainment. (\u201cK\u00fcnste; Sch\u00f6ne\nK\u00fcnste,\u201d Allgemeine Theorie, volume III, p.  83)\n\n\nFor this reason, the moral potential of art must\nbe governed by a firm recognition of the fundamental principles of\nmorality itself (ibid., p. 78). Sulzer does not make the mistake of\nthinking that the experience of fine art, valuable as it can be for\nsound morality and politics, can substitute for a direct grasp of\nsound principles of morality and politics. Although his emphasis on\nthe moral potential of the heightened sensitivity\n(Empfindlichkeit) that can be developed through aesthetic\neducation may have been an important source for Schiller, he would\nnot have gone as far as the latter does in his Letters on\nAesthetic Education in suggesting that aesthetic education is\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for moral regeneration.\n",
