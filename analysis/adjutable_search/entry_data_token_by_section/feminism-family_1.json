    "main_text": "Why The Family is Subject to Principles of Justice || The family is a political institution\n1.1 The family is a political institution\n\n\nTraditional views of the family often treat it as a pre-political or\nas a non-political institution. The family is viewed as\npre-political by those that hold that its basis lies in\ncertain facts of biology and psychology. The family is viewed as\nnon-political by those who hold that the circumstances of\npolitics \u2014 scarcity, conflict of interests and power \u2014 do\nnot obtain in the family. Both of these assumptions are problematic and\nhave been subject to feminist criticism.\n1.1.1 Why the family is not pre-political\n\n\nFor many traditional theorists of the family, nature itself\nnecessitates the division of tasks within the family. Women naturally\nwant to have and raise children; men by nature do not (Rousseau 1762).\nThere is thus a physiologically grounded basis of gender difference:\nwomen's predominant role in childrearing and domestic labor is their\nbiological destiny.\n\n\nFeminists have given three responses to this argument.\n\nSocial constructivists deny that there are any essential\ndifferences between male and female bodies or psychologies that\nexplain women's position in the family (Haslanger 2000). Social\nconstructivists have explored the ways in which culture and society\nhave shaped even the most ostensibly natural differences between men\nand women. They argue that many of the differences between men and\nwomen alleged to be the source of gender inequality should instead be\nviewed as the outcome of that inequality.  For example, they claim\nthat we cannot understand sex-based differentials of height and\nphysical strength without considering the influence of diet, division\nof labor, and physical training. Feminist historians and\nanthropologists have sought to demonstrate the significant roles that\nculture, religion and social class have played in shaping women's\nlives (Scott 1988).\n\nDifference feminists accept that there are essential\nbiological or psychological differences between men and women. But they\nseek to challenge the normative and social implications of these\ndifferences. Even if women are by nature more nurturing than men, or\nmore concerned with their relationships with others, the effects of\nthese differences depend on how we value them (Gilligan 1982,\nNoddings 1986). If nurturing were a more valued activity, for example,\nthen we might arrange the work world so that women (and men) could\nspend more time with their children. Or, we might pay women (and men)\nfor their household labor and work in raising children. Difference\nfeminists seek to celebrate and revalue those characteristics\ntraditionally associated with women. On their view, there is no\nnecessary problem with a sex-based division of labor, provided it is\nvoluntary and that male and female roles are appropriately valued. This\ndifference perspective is perhaps best summed up by the words of the\nfamiliar quip: women who want to be equal with men lack ambition.\n\n\nThe anti-subordination feminist perspective aims to dislodge\nquestions about biological and psychological difference from the center\nof debates about the family and reproduction. A narrow focus on men and\nwomen's \u201cdifference\u201d versus their \u201cequality\u201d\nobscures what is at stake in treating people as equals. Even if there\nare some natural differences between men and women, the crucial point is that these differences\ndo not justify social structures that leave women vulnerable to\npoverty, unequal pay for equal work, and domestic violence.\nWhatever the facts about women's biology or psychology, such\ndifferences do not entail women's social subordination (MacKinnon\n1989, Rhode 1989). Biology does not explain coverture \u2014 the\neighteenth century doctrine that assigned a wife's property and rights\nwholly to her husband \u2014 contemporary divorce law, child custody\nlaws, or laws governing women's reproduction. Nothing in our nature\ndictates the structure of work and school hours that make it extremely\ndifficult for anyone to combine work and raising children.\nEven if nature is part of the causal story of gender differences, it\ncannot by itself explain \u2014 or more importantly justify \u2014 the\nextent of the social inequality between men and women.\n1.1.2 Why the family is not non-political\n\n\nThe fact that law already has permeated the family \u2014 as in the\ndoctrine of coverture \u2014 is an important insight of contemporary\nfeminism. Families have always been shaped by law \u2014 by coercion,\nas well as by social convention. For example, state laws in the United States\nregulate who can marry, who has parental rights, who can divorce and on\nwhat terms, and who can inherit property. Almost all countries have\nlaws that prevent gay couples from marrying and in many places from\nadopting children; in other countries daughters cannot inherit property\nat all with devastating consequences for their well-being. The family\nhas, in fact, always been heavily regulated by the state, often in ways\ndetrimental to women's equality (Fineman 1995).\n\n\nNevertheless, some political thinkers argue that law \u2014\nparticularly, the assignment of rights and obligations \u2014 are\ninappropriately applied within the family. While families may\nappropriately be regulated as a legal entity through marriage and\ndivorce, these thinkers argue that the day-to-day interactions of\nfamilies are based on different principles. Families are based on the\nties of love and affection, not justice. The circumstances of justice\n\u2014 conflict of interests, power, and scarcity \u2014 do not\nbelong in families, at least when they are functioning properly. These\nthinkers criticize the idea \u2014 which they associate with bringing\njustice into the family \u2014 that the task of washing the dishes\nshould be allocated on principles of justice (Sandel 1982).\n\n\nThere is something to be said for an ideal of families as\nassociations beyond justice whose participants think from a sense of\ntheir intertwined lives, of a common good. In Christopher Lasch's\nresonant phrase, such families can be a \u201chaven in a heartless\nworld\u201d. But this view of the family is limited in certain crucial\nrespects. First, many families, rather than based on love and consent\nare based on coercion. Real families are often characterized by\ndisagreements, and in the extreme, by violence. In these families, the\ninternalization of norms of justice would be an improvement. Second,\neven in loving families, women are made vulnerable by the unequal\ndivision of labor in the family, by assumptions about child-rearing and\nhousehold responsibilities. While ideal families may go beyond justice\nin their relations to their members, it is still appropriate for\ncitizens to reflect on the ways that domestic arrangements\naffect social justice and family life. Most of us are simultaneously\nmembers of families and members of a larger polity: there is no reason\nwhy a perspective based on harmonious affection cannot coexist with a\nperspective based on standards of justice (Okin 1989). Finally, given\nthe existence of two complementary but diverse perspectives, there is\nno reason to think that citizens will seek to apply principles of\njustice to dishwashing.\n\n\nJustice, however, must govern families not only because real\nfamilies are far from ideal. The state also has an interest in\npromoting and maintaining just families because of the effects of\nfamilies on future citizens and on women's opportunities and real\nfreedoms.\n",
