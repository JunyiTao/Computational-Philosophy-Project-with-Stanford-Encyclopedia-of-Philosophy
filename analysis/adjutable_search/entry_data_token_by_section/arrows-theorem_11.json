    "main_text": "The Conditions, again || Weak Pareto\n4.3 Weak Pareto\nCondition WP requires that whenever everybody ranks one\nalternative strictly above another the social ordering agrees. This\nhas long been a basic assumption in welfare economics and might seem\ncompletely uncontroversial. That the community should prefer one\nsocial state to another whenever each individual does, Arrow argued in\nconnection with compensation, is \u201cnot debatable except perhaps\non a philosophy of systematically denying people whatever they\nwant\u201d (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 34).\nBut WP is not as harmless as it might seem, and in\ncombination with U it tightly constrains the possibilities\nfor social choice. This is evident from Sen\u2019s (1970) demonstration\nthat these two conditions conflict with the idea that for each person\nthere is a personal domain of states of affairs, within which his\npreferences must prevail in case of conflict with others\u2019. This\nimportant problem of the \u201cParetian libertarian\u201d meanwhile\nhas its own extensive literature. For further discussion, see the\nentry social choice theory.\nWe may think of WP as a vestige of what Sen called:\n\nWelfarism: The judgement of the relative goodness of\nalternative states of affairs must be based exclusively on, and taken\nas an increasing function of, the respective collections of\nindividual utilities in these states (Sen 1979: 468).\n\nIn Arrow\u2019s ordinal framework, welfarism insists that individual\npreference orderings are the only basis for deriving social\npreferences. Non-welfare factors\u2014physical characteristics of\nsocial states, people\u2019s motives in having the preferences they do,\nrespect for rights, equality\u2014none of these are to make any\ndifference except indirectly, through their reflections in individual\npreferences. WP asserts the demands of welfarism in the\nspecial case in which everybody\u2019s strict preferences coincide. Sen\nargued that even these limited demands might be found excessive on\nmoral grounds (Sen 1979: Section IV). Section 4.5 \nhas further discussion of welfarism.\n\n\n",
