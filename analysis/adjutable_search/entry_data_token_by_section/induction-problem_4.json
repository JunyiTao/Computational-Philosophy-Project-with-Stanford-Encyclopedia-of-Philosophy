    "main_text": "Tackling the First Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma || The Nomological-Explanatory solution\n3.2 The Nomological-Explanatory solution\n\nThe \u201cNomological-explanatory\u201d solution, which has been put\nforward by Armstrong, BonJour and Foster (Armstrong 1983; BonJour\n1998; Foster 2004) appeals to the principle of Inference to the Best\nExplanation (IBE). According to IBE, we should infer that the\nhypothesis which provides the best explanation of the evidence is\nprobably true. Proponents of the Nomological-Explanatory approach take\nInference to the Best Explanation to be a mode of inference which is\ndistinct from the type of \u201cextrapolative\u201d inductive\ninference that Hume was trying to justify. They also regard it as a\ntype of inference which although non-deductive, is justified a\npriori. For example, Armstrong says \u201cTo infer to the best\nexplanation is part of what it is to be rational. If that is not\nrational, what is?\u201d (Armstrong 1983: 59).\n\nThe a priori justification is taken to proceed in two steps.\nFirst, it is argued that we should recognize that certain observed\nregularities require an explanation in terms of some underlying law.\nFor example, if a coin persistently lands heads on repeated tosses,\nthen it becomes increasingly implausible that this occurred just\nbecause of \u201cchance\u201d. Rather, we should infer to the better\nexplanation that the coin has a certain bias. Saying that the coin\nlands heads not only for the observed cases, but also for the\nunobserved cases, does not provide an explanation of the observed\nregularity. Thus, mere Humean constant conjunction is not sufficient.\nWhat is needed for an explanation is a \u201cnon-Humean,\nmetaphysically robust conception of objective regularity\u201d\n(BonJour 1998), which is thought of as involving actual natural\nnecessity (Armstrong 1983; Foster 2004).\n\nOnce it has been established that there must be some metaphysically\nrobust explanation of the observed regularity, the second step is to\nargue that out of all possible metaphysically robust explanations, the\n\u201cstraight\u201d inductive explanation is the best one, where\nthe straight explanation extrapolates the observed frequency to the\nwider population. For example, given that a coin has some objective\nchance of landing heads, the best explanation of the fact that \\(m/n\\)\nheads have been so far observed, is that the objective chance of the\ncoin landing heads is \\(m/n\\). And this objective chance determines\nwhat happens not only in observed cases but also in unobserved\ncases.\n\nThe Nomological-Explanatory solution relies on taking IBE as a\nrational, a priori form of inference which is distinct from\ninductive inferences like inference I. However, one might\nalternatively view inductive inferences as a special case of IBE\n(Harman 1968), or take IBE to be merely an alternative way of\ncharacterizing inductive inference (Henderson 2014). If either of\nthese views is right, IBE does not have the necessary independence\nfrom inductive inference to provide a non-circular justification of\nit.\n\nOne may also object to the Nomological-Explanatory approach on the\ngrounds that regularities do not necessarily require an explanation in\nterms of necessary connections or robust metaphysical laws. The\nviability of the approach also depends on the tenability of a\nnon-Humean conception of laws. There have been several serious\nattempts to develop such an account (Armstrong 1983; Tooley 1977;\nDretske 1977), but also much criticism (see J. Carroll 2016).\n\nAnother critical objection is that the Nomological-Explanatory\nsolution simply begs the question, even if it is taken to be\nlegitimate to make use of IBE in the justification of induction. In\nthe first step of the argument we infer to a law or regularity which\nextends beyond the spatio-temporal region in which observations have\nbeen thus far made, in order to predict what will happen in the\nfuture. But why could a law that only applies to the observed\nspatio-temporal region not be an equally good explanation? The main\nreply seems to be that we can see a priori that laws with\ntemporal or spatial restrictions would be less good explanations.\nFoster argues that the reason is that this would introduce more\nmysteries:\n\n\nFor it seems to me that a law whose scope is restricted to some\nparticular period is more mysterious, inherently more puzzling, than\none which is temporally universal.
