Kant characterized the CI\nas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that\nwe must follow despite any natural desires we may have to the\ncontrary. All specific moral requirements, according to Kant, are\njustified by this principle, which means that all immoral actions are\nirrational because they violate the CI. Other philosophers, such as\nHobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued that moral requirements are\nbased on standards of rationality. However, these standards were\neither instrumental principles of rationality for satisfying\none\u2019s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational principles\nthat are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas. Kant agreed\nwith many of his predecessors that an analysis of practical reason\nreveals the requirement that rational agents must conform to\ninstrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity to the CI\n(a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral requirements\nthemselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to rational\nagency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that a\nrational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense of\nbeing the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle\nof morality \u2014 the CI \u2014 is none other than the law of an\nautonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\nis a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs goes well\nbeyond that of a Humean \u2018slave\u2019 to the passions. Moreover,\nit is the presence of this self-governing reason in each person that\nKant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as possessed of\nequal worth and deserving of equal respect.\n\nKant\u2019s most influential positions in moral philosophy are found\nin The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter,\n\u201cGroundwork\u201d) but he developed, enriched, and in\nsome cases modified those views in later works such as The\nCritique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals,\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion\nwithin the Boundaries of Mere Reason as well as his essays on\nhistory and related topics. Kant\u2019s Lectures on Ethics,\nwhich were lecture notes taken by three of his students on the courses\nhe gave in moral philosophy, also include relevant material for\nunderstanding his views. We will mainly focus on the foundational\ndoctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some\nscholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to\nKant\u2019s views and have turned their attention to the later works.\nWe find the standard approach most illuminating, though we will\nhighlight important positions from the later works where needed.\n", "toc": [{"#AimMetMor": "1.

Aims and Methods of Moral Philosophy\n\nThe most basic aim of moral philosophy, and so also of the\nGroundwork, is, in Kant\u2019s view, to \u201cseek\nout\u201d the foundational principle of a \u201cmetaphysics of\nmorals,\u201d which Kant understands as a system of a priori\nmoral principles that apply the CI to human persons in all times and\ncultures. Kant pursues this project through the first two chapters of\nthe Groundwork. He proceeds by analyzing and elucidating\ncommonsense ideas about morality, including the ideas of a \u201cgood\nwill\u201d and \u201cduty\u201d. The point of this first project is\nto come up with a precise statement of the principle or principles on\nwhich all of our ordinary moral judgments are based. The judgments in\nquestion are supposed to be those that any normal, sane, adult human\nbeing would accept on due rational reflection. Nowadays, however, many\nwould regard Kant as being overly optimistic about the depth and\nextent of moral agreement. Perhaps he is best thought of as drawing on\na moral viewpoint that is very widely shared and which contains some\ngeneral judgments that are very deeply held. In any case, he does not\nappear to take himself to be primarily addressing a genuine moral\nskeptic such as those who often populate the works of moral\nphilosophers, that is, someone who doubts that she has any reason to\nact morally and whose moral behavior hinges on a rational proof that\nphilosophers might try to give. For instance, when, in the third and\nfinal chapter of the Groundwork, Kant takes up his second\nfundamental aim, to \u201cestablish\u201d this foundational moral\nprinciple as a demand of each person\u2019s own rational will, his\nconclusion apparently falls short of answering those who want a proof\nthat we really are bound by moral requirements. He rests this second\nproject on the position that we \u2014 or at least creatures with\nrational wills \u2014 possess autonomy. The argument of this second\nproject does often appear to try to reach out to a metaphysical fact\nabout our wills. This has led some readers to the conclusion that he\nis, after all, trying to justify moral requirements by appealing to a\nfact \u2014 our autonomy \u2014 that even a moral skeptic would have\nto recognize.\n\nKant\u2019s analysis of the common moral concepts of\n\u201cduty\u201d and \u201cgood will\u201d led him to believe that\nwe are free and autonomous as long as morality, itself, is not an\nillusion. Yet in the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant also tried\nto show that every event has a cause. Kant recognized that there seems\nto be a deep tension between these two claims: If causal determinism\nis true then, it seems, we cannot have the kind of freedom that\nmorality presupposes, which is \u201ca kind of causality\u201d that\n\u201ccan be active, independently of alien causes determining\nit\u201d (G 4:446).\n\nKant thought that the only way to resolve this apparent conflict is to\ndistinguish between phenomena, which is what we know through\nexperience, and noumena, which we can consistently think but\nnot know through experience. Our knowledge and understanding of the\nempirical world, Kant argued, can only arise within the limits of our\nperceptual and cognitive powers. We should not assume, however, that\nwe know all that may be true about \u201cthings in themselves,\u201d\nalthough we lack the \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d that would\nbe needed to learn about such things.\n\nThese distinctions, according to Kant, allow us to resolve the\n\u201cantinomy\u201d about free will by interpreting the\n\u201cthesis\u201d that free will is possible as about noumena and\nthe \u201cantithesis\u201d that every event has a cause as about\nphenomena. Morality thus presupposes that agents, in an\nincomprehensible \u201cintelligible world,\u201d are able to make\nthings happen by their own free choices in a \u201csensible\nworld\u201d in which causal determinism is true.\n\nMany of Kant\u2019s commentators, who are skeptical about these\napparently exorbitant metaphysical claims, have attempted to make\nsense of his discussions of the intelligible and sensible worlds in\nless metaphysically demanding ways. On one interpretation (Hudson\n1994), one and the same act can be described in wholly physical terms\n(as an appearance) and also in irreducibly mental terms (as a thing in\nitself). On this compatibilist picture, all acts are causally\ndetermined, but a free act is one that can be described as determined\nby irreducibly mental causes, and in particular by the causality of\nreason. A second interpretation holds that the intelligible and\nsensible worlds are used as metaphors for two ways of conceiving of\none and the same world (Korsgaard 1996; Allison 1990; Hill 1989a,\n1989b). When we are engaging in scientific or empirical\ninvestigations, we often take up a perspective in which we think of\nthings as subject to natural causation, but when we deliberate, act,\nreason and judge, we often take up a different perspective, in which\nwe think of ourselves and others as agents who are not determined by\nnatural causes. When we take up this latter, practical, standpoint, we\nneed not believe that we or others really are free, in any deep\nmetaphysical sense; we need only operate \u201cunder the idea of\nfreedom\u201d (G 4:448). Controversy persists, however, about whether\nKant\u2019s conception of freedom requires a \u201ctwo worlds\u201d\nor \u201ctwo perspectives\u201d account of the sensible and\nintelligible worlds (Guyer 1987, 2009; Langton 2001; Kohl 2016; Wood\n1984; Hogan 2009).\n\nAlthough the two most basic aims Kant saw for moral philosophy are to\nseek out and establish the supreme principle of morality, they are\nnot, in Kant\u2019s view, its only aims. Moral philosophy, for Kant,\nis most fundamentally addressed to the first-person, deliberative\nquestion, \u201cWhat ought I to do?\u201d, and an answer to that\nquestion requires much more than delivering or justifying the\nfundamental principle of morality. We also need some account, based on\nthis principle, of the nature and extent of the specific moral duties\nthat apply to us. To this end, Kant employs his findings from the\nGroundwork in The Metaphysics of Morals, and offers\na categorization of our basic moral duties to ourselves and others. In\naddition, Kant thought that moral philosophy should characterize and\nexplain the demands that morality makes on human psychology and forms\nof human social interaction. These topics, among others, are addressed\nin central chapters of the second Critique, the\nReligion and again in the Metaphysics of Morals, and\nare perhaps given a sustained treatment in Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View. Further, a satisfying answer to the\nquestion of what one ought to do would have to take into account any\npolitical and religious requirements there are. Each of these\nrequirement turn out to be, indirectly at least, also moral\nobligations for Kant, and are discussed in the Metaphysics of\nMorals and in Religion. Finally, moral philosophy should\nsay something about the ultimate end of human endeavor, the Highest\nGood, and its relationship to the moral life. In the Critique of\nPractical Reason, Kant argued that this Highest Good for humanity\nis complete moral virtue together with complete happiness, the former\nbeing the condition of our deserving the latter. Unfortunately, Kant\nnoted, virtue does not ensure wellbeing and may even conflict with it.\nFurther, he thought that there is no real possibility of moral\nperfection in this life and indeed few of us fully deserve the\nhappiness we are lucky enough to enjoy. Reason cannot prove or\ndisprove the existence of Divine Providence, on Kant\u2019s view, nor\nthe immortality of the soul, which seem necessary to rectify these\nthings. Nevertheless, Kant argued, an unlimited amount of time to\nperfect ourselves (immortality) and a commensurate achievement of\nwellbeing (ensured by God) are \u201cpostulates\u201d required by\nreason when employed in moral matters.\n\nThroughout his moral works, Kant returns time and again to the\nquestion of the method moral philosophy should employ when pursuing\nthese aims. A basic theme of these discussions is that the fundamental\nphilosophical issues of morality must be addressed a priori,\nthat is, without drawing on observations of human beings and their\nbehavior. Kant\u2019s insistence on an a priori method to\nseek out and establish fundamental moral principles, however, does not\nalways appear to be matched by his own practice. The Metaphysics\nof Morals, for instance, is meant to be based on a\npriori rational principles, but many of the specific duties that\nKant describes, along with some of the arguments he gives in support\nof them, rely on general facts about human beings and our\ncircumstances that are known from experience.\n\nIn one sense, it might seem obvious why Kant insists on an a\npriori method. A \u201cmetaphysics of morals\u201d would be,\nmore or less, an account of the nature and structure of moral\nrequirements \u2014 in effect, a categorization of duties and values.\nSuch a project would address such questions as, What is a\nduty? What kinds of duties are there? What is the\ngood? What kinds of goods are there?, and so on. These appear\nto be metaphysical questions. Any principle used to provide such\ncategorizations appears to be a principle of metaphysics, in a sense,\nbut Kant did not see them as external moral truths that exist\nindependently of rational agents. Moral requirements, instead, are\nrational principles that tell us what we have overriding reason to do.\nMetaphysical principles of this sort are always sought out and\nestablished by a priori methods.\n\nPerhaps something like this was behind Kant\u2019s thinking. However,\nthe considerations he offers for an a priori method do not\nall obviously draw on this sort of rationale. The following are three\nconsiderations favoring a priori methods that he emphasizes\nrepeatedly.\n\nThe first is that, as Kant and others have conceived of it, ethics\ninitially requires an analysis of our moral concepts. We must\nunderstand the concepts of a \u201cgood will\u201d,\n\u201cobligation\u201d, \u201cduty\u201d and so on, as well as\ntheir logical relationships to one another, before we can determine\nwhether our use of these concepts is justified. Given that the\nanalysis of concepts is an a priori matter, to the degree\nthat ethics consists of such an analysis, ethics is a priori\nas a well.\n\nOf course, even were we to agree with Kant that ethics should begin\nwith analysis, and that analysis is or should be an entirely a\npriori undertaking, this would not explain why all of\nthe fundamental questions of moral philosophy must be pursued a\npriori. Indeed, one of the most important projects of moral\nphilosophy, for Kant, is to show that we, as rational agents, are\nbound by moral requirements and that fully rational agents would\nnecessarily comply with them. Kant admits that his analytical\narguments for the CI are inadequate on their own because the most they\ncan show is that the CI is the supreme principle of morality if\nthere is such a principle. Kant must therefore address the\npossibility that morality itself is an illusion by showing that the CI\nreally is an unconditional requirement of reason that applies to us.\nEven though Kant thought that this project of\n\u201cestablishing\u201d the CI must also be carried out a\npriori, he did not think we could pursue this project simply by\nanalyzing our moral concepts or examining the actual behavior of\nothers. What is needed, instead, is a \u201csynthetic\u201d, but\nstill a priori, kind of argument that starts from ideas of\nfreedom and rational agency and critically examines the nature and\nlimits of these capacities.\n\nThis is the second reason Kant held that fundamental issues in ethics\nmust be addressed with an a priori method: The ultimate\nsubject matter of ethics is the nature and content of the principles\nthat necessarily determine a rational will.\n\nFundamental issues in moral philosophy must also be settled a\npriori because of the nature of moral requirements themselves, or\nso Kant thought. This is a third reason he gives for an a priori\nmethod, and it appears to have been of great importance to Kant:\nMoral requirements present themselves as being unconditionally\nnecessary. But an a posteriori method seems ill-suited\nto discovering and establishing what we must do whether we\nfeel like doing it or not; surely such a method could only tell us\nwhat we actually do. So an a posteriori method of\nseeking out and establishing the principle that generates such\nrequirements will not support the presentation of moral\n\u201coughts\u201d as unconditional necessities. Kant argued that\nempirical observations could only deliver conclusions about, for\ninstance, the relative advantages of moral behavior in various\ncircumstances or how pleasing it might be in our own eyes or the eyes\nof others. Such findings clearly would not support the unconditional\nnecessity of moral requirements. To appeal to a posteriori\nconsiderations would thus result in a tainted conception of moral\nrequirements. It would view them as demands for which compliance is\nnot unconditionally necessary, but rather necessary only if additional\nconsiderations show it to be advantageous, optimific or in some other\nway felicitous. Thus, Kant argued that if moral philosophy is to guard\nagainst undermining the unconditional necessity of obligation in its\nanalysis and defense of moral thought, it must be carried out entirely\na priori.\n2. Good Will, Moral Worth and Duty\n\nKant\u2019s analysis of commonsense ideas begins with the thought\nthat the only thing good without qualification is a \u201cgood\nwill\u201d. While the phrases \u201che\u2019s good hearted\u201d,\n\u201cshe\u2019s good natured\u201d and \u201cshe means\nwell\u201d are common, \u201cthe good will\u201d as Kant thinks of\nit is not the same as any of these ordinary notions. The idea of a\ngood will is closer to the idea of a \u201cgood person\u201d, or,\nmore archaically, a \u201cperson of good will\u201d. This use of the\nterm \u201cwill\u201d early on in analyzing ordinary moral thought\nprefigures later and more technical discussions concerning the nature\nof rational agency. Nevertheless, this idea of a good will is an\nimportant commonsense touchstone to which Kant returns throughout his\nworks. The basic idea, as Kant describes it in the Groundwork, is that\nwhat makes a good person good is his possession of a will that is in a\ncertain way \u201cdetermined\u201d by, or makes its decisions on the\nbasis of, whatever basic moral principles there may be. The idea of a\ngood will is supposed to be the idea of one who is committed only to\nmake decisions that she holds to be morally worthy and who takes moral\nconsiderations in themselves to be conclusive reasons for guiding her\nbehavior. This sort of disposition or character is something we all\nhighly value, Kant thought. He believes we value it without limitation\nor qualification. By this, we believe, he means primarily two\nthings.\n\nFirst, unlike anything else, there is no conceivable circumstance in\nwhich we regard our own moral goodness as worth forfeiting simply in\norder to obtain some desirable object. By contrast, the value of all\nother desirable qualities, such as courage or cleverness, can be\ndiminished, forgone, or sacrificed under certain circumstances:\nCourage may be laid aside if it requires injustice, and it is better\nnot to be witty if it requires cruelty. There is no implicit\nrestriction or qualification to the effect that a commitment to give\nmoral considerations decisive weight is worth honoring, but\nonly under such and such circumstances.\n\nSecond, possessing and maintaining a steadfast commitment to moral\nprinciples is the very condition under which anything else is worth\nhaving or pursuing. Intelligence and even pleasure are worth having\nonly on the condition that they do not require giving up one\u2019s\nfundamental moral convictions. The value of a good will thus cannot be\nthat it secures certain valuable ends, whether of our own or of\nothers, since their value is entirely conditional on our possessing\nand maintaining a good will. Indeed, since a good will is good under\nany condition, its goodness must not depend on any particular\nconditions obtaining. Thus, Kant points out that a good will must then\nalso be good in itself and not in virtue of its relationship\nto other things such as the agent\u2019s own happiness, overall\nwelfare or any other effects it may or may not produce A good will\nwould still \u201cshine like a jewel\u201d even if it were\n\u201ccompletely powerless to carry out its aims\u201d (G\n4:394).\n\nIn Kant\u2019s terms, a good will is a will whose decisions are\nwholly determined by moral demands or, as he often refers to this, by\nthe Moral Law. Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint\non their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human\nbeings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral\nLaw is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A\nholy or divine will, if it exists, though good,\nwould not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because\nsuch a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily\nfulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It\nis the presence of desires that could operate independently\nof moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an\nessential element of the idea of \u201cduty.\u201d So in analyzing\nunqualified goodness as it occurs in imperfectly rational creatures\nsuch as ourselves, we are investigating the idea of being motivated by\nthe thought that we are constrained to act in certain ways that we\nmight not want to simply from the thought that we are morally\nrequired to do so.\n\nKant confirms this by comparing motivation by duty with other sorts of\nmotives, in particular, with motives of self-interest,\nself-preservation, sympathy and happiness. He argues that a dutiful\naction from any of these motives, however praiseworthy it may be, does\nnot express a good will. Assuming an action has moral worth only if it\nexpresses a good will, such actions have no genuine \u201cmoral\nworth.\u201d The conformity of one\u2019s action to duty in such\ncases is only related by accident to morality. For instance, if one is\nmotivated by happiness alone, then had conditions not conspired to\nalign one\u2019s duty with one\u2019s own happiness one would not\nhave done one\u2019s duty. By contrast, were one to supplant any of\nthese motivations with the motive of duty, the morality of the action\nwould then express one\u2019s determination to act dutifully out of\nrespect for the moral law itself. Only then would the action have\nmoral worth.\n\nKant\u2019s views in this regard have understandably been the subject\nof much controversy. Many object that we do not think better of\nactions done for the sake of duty than actions performed out of\nemotional concern or sympathy for others, especially those things we\ndo for friends and family. Worse, moral worth appears to require not\nonly that one\u2019s actions be motivated by duty, but also that no\nother motives, even love or friendship, cooperate. Yet Kant\u2019s\ndefenders have argued that his point is not that we do not admire or\npraise motivating concerns other than duty, only that from the point\nof view of someone deliberating about what to do, these concerns are\nnot decisive in the way that considerations of moral duty are. What is\ncrucial in actions that express a good will is that in conforming to\nduty a perfectly virtuous person always would, and so ideally we\nshould, recognize and be moved by the thought that our conformity is\nmorally obligatory. The motivational structure of the agent should be\narranged so that she always treats considerations of duty as\nsufficient reasons for conforming to those requirements. In other\nwords, we should have a firm commitment not to perform an action if it\nis morally forbidden and to perform an action if it is morally\nrequired. Having a good will, in this sense, is compatible with having\nfeelings and emotions of various kinds, and even with aiming to\ncultivate some of them in order to counteract desires and inclinations\nthat tempt us to immorality. Controversy persists, however, about\nwhether Kant\u2019s claims about the motive of duty go beyond this\nbasic point (Timmermann 2007; Herman 1993; Wood 1998; Baron 1995).\n\nSuppose for the sake of argument we agree with Kant. We now need to\nknow what distinguishes the principle that lays down our duties from\nthese other motivating principles, and so makes motivation by it the\nsource of unqualified value.\n3. Duty and Respect for Moral Law\n\nAccording to Kant, what is singular about motivation by duty is that\nit consists of bare respect for the moral law. What naturally comes to\nmind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some sort combined with some\nsort of felt constraint or incentive on our choices, whether from\nexternal coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For\ninstance, the bylaws of a club lay down duties for its officers and\nenforce them with sanctions. City and state laws establish the duties\nof citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Thus, if we do\nsomething because it is our \u201ccivic\u201d duty, or our duty\n\u201cas a boy scout\u201d or \u201ca good American,\u201d our\nmotivation is respect for the code that makes it our duty. Thinking we\nare duty bound is simply respecting, as such, certain laws pertaining\nto us.\n\nHowever intuitive, this cannot be all of Kant\u2019s meaning. For one\nthing, as with the Jim Crow laws of the old South and the Nuremberg\nlaws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which these types of \u201cactions\nfrom duty\u201d conform may be morally despicable. Respect for such\nlaws could hardly be thought valuable. For another, our motive in\nconforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional\nrespect. We also have an eye toward doing our part in maintaining\ncivil or social order, toward punishments or loss of standing and\nreputation in violating such laws, and other outcomes of lawful\nbehavior. Indeed, we respect these laws to the degree, but only to the\ndegree, that they do not violate values, laws or principles we hold\nmore dear. Yet Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at\nall motivated by a prospective outcome or some other extrinsic feature\nof our conduct except insofar as these are requirements of duty\nitself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to law as\nsuch.\n\nTo act out of respect for the moral law, in Kant\u2019s view, is to\nbe moved to act by a recognition that the moral law is a supremely\nauthoritative standard that binds us and to experience a kind of\nfeeling, which is akin to awe and fear, when we acknowledge the moral\nlaw as the source of moral requirements. Human persons inevitably have\nrespect for the moral law even though we are not always moved by it\nand even though we do not always comply with the moral standards that\nwe nonetheless recognize as authoritative.\n\nKant\u2019s account of the content of moral requirements and the\nnature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force\nmoral considerations have as reasons to act. The force of moral\nrequirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how\ncircumstances might conspire against any other consideration. Basic\nmoral requirements retain their reason-giving force under any\ncircumstance, they have universal validity. So, whatever else may be\nsaid of basic moral requirements, their content is universal. Only a\nuniversal law could be the content of a requirement that has the\nreason-giving force of morality. This brings Kant to a preliminary\nformulation of the CI: \u201cI ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw\u201d (G 4:402). This is the principle which motivates a good\nwill, and which Kant holds to be the fundamental principle of all of\nmorality.\n4. Categorical and Hypothetical Imperatives\n\nKant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a\ncategorical imperative. It is an imperative\nbecause it is a command addressed to agents who could follow it but\nmight not (e.g. , \u201cLeave the gun. Take the cannoli.\u201d). It\nis categorical in virtue of applying to us unconditionally,\nor simply because we possesses rational wills, without reference to\nany ends that we might or might not have. It does not, in other words,\napply to us on the condition that we have antecedently adopted some\ngoal for ourselves.\n\nThere are \u201coughts\u201d other than our moral duties, according\nto Kant, but these oughts are distinguished from the moral ought in\nbeing based on a quite different kind of principle, one that is the\nsource of hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative\nis a command that also applies to us in virtue of our having a\nrational will, but not simply in virtue of this. It requires\nus to exercise our wills in a certain way given we have\nantecedently willed an end. A hypothetical imperative is thus a\ncommand in a conditional form. But not any command in this form counts\nas a hypothetical imperative in Kant\u2019s sense. For instance,\n\u201cif you\u2019re happy and you know it, clap your hands!\u201d\nis a conditional command. But the antecedent conditions under which\nthe command \u201cclap your hands\u201d applies to you do not posit\nany end that you will, but consist rather of emotional and cognitive\nstates you may or may not be in. Further, \u201cif you want pastrami,\ntry the corner deli\u201d is also a command in conditional form, but\nstrictly speaking it too fails to be a hypothetical imperative in\nKant\u2019s sense since this command does not apply to us in virtue\nof our willing some end, but only in virtue of our\ndesiring or wanting an end. For Kant, willing an end\ninvolves more than desiring; it requires actively choosing or\ncommitting to the end rather than merely finding oneself with a\npassive desire for it. Further, there is nothing irrational in failing\nto will means to what one desires. An imperative that applied to us in\nvirtue of our desiring some end would thus not be a hypothetical\nimperative of practical rationality in Kant\u2019s\nsense.\n\nThe condition under which a hypothetical imperative applies to us,\nthen, is that we will some end. Now, for the most part, the ends we\nwill we might not have willed, and some ends that we do not will we\nmight nevertheless have willed. But there is at least conceptual room\nfor the idea of a natural or inclination-based end that we\nmust will. The distinction between ends that we might or\nmight not will and those, if any, we necessarily will as the kinds of\nnatural beings we are, is the basis for his distinction between two\nkinds of hypothetical imperatives. Kant names these\n\u201cproblematic\u201d and \u201cassertoric\u201d, based on how\nthe end is willed. If the end is one that we might or might not will\n\u2014 that is, it is a merely possible end \u2014 the\nimperative is problematic. For instance, \u201cDon\u2019t ever take\nside with anyone against the Family.\u201d is a problematic\nimperative, even if the end posited here is (apparently) one\u2019s\nown continued existence. Almost all non-moral, rational imperatives\nare problematic, since there are virtually no ends that we necessarily\nwill as human beings.\n\nAs it turns out, the only (non-moral) end that we will, as a matter of\nnatural necessity, is our own happiness. Any imperative that applied\nto us because we will our own happiness would thus be an\nassertoric imperative. Rationality, Kant thinks, can issue no\nimperative if the end is indeterminate, and happiness is an\nindeterminate end. Although we can say for the most part that if one\nis to be happy, one should save for the future, take care of\none\u2019s health and nourish one\u2019s relationships, these fail\nto be genuine commands in the strictest sense and so are instead mere\n\u201ccounsels.\u201d Some people are happy without these, and\nwhether you could be happy without them is, although doubtful, an open\nquestion.\n\nSince Kant presents moral and prudential rational requirements as\nfirst and foremost demands on our wills rather than on external acts,\nmoral and prudential evaluation is first and foremost an evaluation of\nthe will our actions express. Thus, it is not an error of rationality\nto fail to take the necessary means to one\u2019s (willed) ends, nor\nto fail to want to take the means; one only falls foul of\nnon-moral practical reason if one fails to will the means.\nLikewise, while actions, feelings or desires may be the focus of other\nmoral views, for Kant practical irrationality, both moral and\nprudential, focuses mainly on our willing.\n\nOne recent interpretive dispute (Hill 1973; Schroeder 2009; Rippon\n2014) has been about whether hypothetical imperatives, in Kant\u2019s\nview, have a \u201cwide\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d scope. That\nis, do such imperatives tell us to take the necessary means to our\nends or give up our ends (wide scope) or do they simply tell us that,\nif we have an end, then take the necessary means to it.\n\nKant describes the will as operating on the basis of subjective\nvolitional principles he calls \u201cmaxims\u201d. Hence, morality\nand other rational requirements are, for the most part, demands that\napply to the maxims that we act on. . The form of a maxim is \u201cI\nwill A in C in order to realize or produce\nE\u201d where \u201cA\u201d is some act type,\n\u201cC\u201d is some type of circumstance, and\n\u201cE\u201d is some type of end to be realized or\nachieved by A in C. Since this is a principle stating only what some\nagent wills, it is subjective. (A principle that\ngoverns any rational will is an objective principle\nof volition, which Kant refers to as a practical law). For anything to\ncount as human willing, it must be based on a maxim to pursue some end\nthrough some means. Hence, in employing a maxim, any human willing\nalready embodies the form of means-end reasoning that calls for\nevaluation in terms of hypothetical imperatives. To that extent at\nleast, then, anything dignified as human willing is subject\nto rational requirements.\n5. The Formula of the Universal Law of Nature\n\nKant\u2019s first formulation of the CI states that you are to\n\u201cact only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at\nthe same time will that it become a universal law\u201d (G 4:421).\nO\u2019Neill (1975, 1989) and Rawls (1980, 1989), among others, take\nthis formulation in effect to summarize a decision procedure for moral\nreasoning, and we will follow their basic outline: First, formulate a\nmaxim that enshrines your proposed plan of action. Second, recast that\nmaxim as a universal law of nature governing all rational agents, and\nso as holding that all must, by natural law, act as you yourself\npropose to act in these circumstances. Third, consider whether your\nmaxim is even conceivable in a world governed by this new law of\nnature. If it is, then, fourth, ask yourself whether you would, or\ncould, rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world.\nIf you could, then your action is morally permissible.\n\nIf your maxim fails the third step, you have a \u201cperfect\u201d\nduty admitting \u201cof no exception in favor of inclination\u201d\nto refrain from acting on that maxim (G 4:421). If your maxim fails\nthe fourth step, you have an \u201cimperfect\u201d duty requiring\nyou to pursue a policy that can admit of such exceptions. If your\nmaxim passes all four steps, only then is acting on it morally\npermissible. Following Hill (1971), we can understand the difference\nin duties as formal: Perfect duties come in the form \u201cOne must\nnever (or always) \u03c6 to the fullest extent possible in\nC\u201d, while imperfect duties, since they require us to\nadopt an end, at least require that \u201cOne must sometimes and to\nsome extent \u03c6 in C.\u201d So, for instance, Kant held\nthat the maxim of committing suicide to avoid future unhappiness did\nnot pass the third step, the contradiction in conception test. Hence,\none is forbidden to act on the maxim of committing suicide to avoid\nunhappiness. By contrast, the maxim of refusing to assist others in\npursuit of their projects passes the contradiction in conception test,\nbut fails the contradiction in the will test at the fourth step.\nHence, we have a duty to sometimes and to some extent aid and assist\nothers.\n\nKant held that ordinary moral thought recognized moral duties toward\nourselves as well as toward others. Hence, together with the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duties, Kant recognized four\ncategories of duties: perfect duties toward ourselves, perfect duties\ntoward others, imperfect duties toward ourselves and imperfect duties\ntoward others. Kant uses four examples in the Groundwork, one\nof each kind of duty, to demonstrate that every kind of duty can be\nderived from the CI, and hence to bolster his case that the CI is\nindeed the fundamental principle of morality. To refrain from suicide\nis a perfect duty toward oneself; to refrain from making promises you\nhave no intention of keeping is a perfect duty toward others; to\ndevelop one\u2019s talents is an imperfect duty toward oneself; and\nto contribute to the happiness of others is an imperfect duty toward\nothers. Again, Kant\u2019s interpreters differ over exactly how to\nreconstruct the derivation of these duties. We will briefly sketch one\nway of doing so for the perfect duty to others to refrain from lying\npromises and the imperfect duty to ourselves to develop talents.\n\nKant\u2019s example of a perfect duty to others concerns a promise\nyou might consider making but have no intention of keeping in order to\nget needed money. Naturally, being rational requires not contradicting\noneself, but there is no self-contradiction in the maxim \u201cI will\nmake lying promises when it achieves something I want.\u201d An\nimmoral action clearly does not involve a self-contradiction in this\nsense (as would the maxim of finding a married bachelor). Kant\u2019s\nposition is that it is irrational to perform an action if that\naction\u2019s maxim contradicts itself once made into a universal\nlaw of nature. The maxim of lying whenever it gets you what you\nwant generates a contradiction once you try to combine it with the\nuniversalized version that all rational agents must, by a law of\nnature, lie when doing so gets them what they want.\n\nHere is one way of seeing how this might work: If I conceive of a\nworld in which everyone by nature must try to deceive people any time\nthis will get them what they want, I am conceiving of a world in which\nno practice of giving one\u2019s word could ever arise and, because\nthis is a law of nature, we can assume that it is widely known that no\nsuch practice could exist. So I am conceiving of a world in which\neveryone knows that no practice of giving one\u2019s word exists. My\nmaxim, however, is to make a deceptive promise in order to get needed\nmoney. And it is a necessary means of doing this that a practice of\ntaking the word of others exists, so that someone might take my word\nand I take advantage of their doing so. Thus, in trying to conceive of\nmy maxim in a world in which no one ever takes anyone\u2019s word in\nsuch circumstances, and knows this about one another, I am trying to\nconceive of this: A world in which no practice of giving one\u2019s\nword exists, but also, at the very same time, a world in which just\nsuch a practice does exist, for me to make use of in my maxim. It is a\nworld containing my promise and a world in which there can be no\npromises. Hence, it is inconceivable that I could sincerely act on my\nmaxim in a world in which my maxim is a universal law of nature. Since\nit is inconceivable that these two things could exist together, I am\nforbidden ever to act on the maxim of lying to get money.\n\nBy contrast with the maxim of the lying promise, we can easily\nconceive of adopting a maxim of refusing to develop any of our talents\nin a world in which that maxim is a universal law of nature. It would\nundoubtedly be a world more primitive than our own, but pursuing such\na policy is still conceivable in it. However, it is not, Kant argues,\npossible to rationally will this maxim in such a world. The argument\nfor why this is so, however, is not obvious, and some of Kant\u2019s\nthinking seems hardly convincing: Insofar as we are rational, he says,\nwe already necessarily will that all of our talents and abilities be\ndeveloped. Hence, although I can conceive of a talentless world, I\ncannot rationally will that it come about, given that I already will,\ninsofar as I am rational, that I develop all of my own. Yet, given\nlimitations on our time, energy and interest, it is difficult to see\nhow full rationality requires us to aim to fully develop literally all\nof our talents. Indeed, it seems to require much less, a judicious\npicking and choosing among one\u2019s abilities. Further, all that is\nrequired to show that I cannot will a talentless world is that,\ninsofar as I am rational, I necessarily will that some\ntalents in me be developed, not the dubious claim that I rationally\nwill that they all be developed. Moreover, suppose\nrationality did require me to aim at developing all of my talents.\nThen, there seems to be no need to go further in the CI procedure to\nshow that refusing to develop talents is immoral. Given that, insofar\nas we are rational, we must will to develop capacities, it is by this\nvery fact irrational not to do so.\n\nHowever, mere failure to conform to something we rationally will is\nnot yet immorality. Failure to conform to instrumental principles, for\ninstance, is irrational but not always immoral. In order to show that\nthis maxim is categorically forbidden, one strategy is to make use of\nseveral other of Kant\u2019s claims or assumptions.\n\nFirst, we must accept Kant\u2019s claim that, by \u201cnatural\nnecessity,\u201d we will our own happiness as an end (G 4:415). This\nis a claim he uses not only to distinguish assertoric from problematic\nimperatives, but also to argue for the imperfect duty of helping\nothers (G 4:423) He also appears to rely on this claim in each of his\nexamples. Each maxim he is testing appears to have happiness as its\naim. One explanation for this is that, since each person necessarily\nwills her own happiness, maxims in pursuit of this goal will be the\ntypical object of moral evaluation. This, at any rate, is clear in the\ntalents example itself: The forbidden maxim adopted by the\nne\u2019er-do-well is supposed to be \u201cdevoting his life solely\nto\u2026enjoyment\u201d (G 4:423) rather than to developing his\ntalents.\n\nSecond, we must assume, as also seems reasonable, that a necessary\nmeans to achieving (normal) human happiness is not only that we\nourselves develop some talent, but also that others develop some\ncapacities of theirs at some time. For instance, I cannot engage in\nthe normal pursuits that make up my own happiness, such as playing\npiano, writing philosophy or eating delicious meals, unless I have\ndeveloped some talents myself, and, moreover, someone else has made\npianos and written music, taught me writing, harvested foods and\ndeveloped traditions of their preparation.\n\nFinally, Kant\u2019s examples come on the heels of defending the\nposition that rationality requires conformity to hypothetical\nimperatives. Thus, we should assume that, necessarily, rational agents\nwill the necessary and available means to any ends that they will. And\nonce we add this to the assumptions that we must will our own\nhappiness as an end, and that developed talents are necessary means to\nachieving that end, it follows that we cannot rationally will that a\nworld come about in which it is a law that no one ever develops any of\ntheir natural talents. We cannot do so, because our own happiness is\nthe very end contained in the maxim of giving ourselves over to\npleasure rather than self-development. Since we will the necessary and\navailable means to our ends, we are rationally committed to willing\nthat everyone sometime develop his or her talents. So since we cannot\nwill as a universal law of nature that no one ever develop any talents\n\u2014 given that it is inconsistent with what we now see that we\nrationally will \u2014 we are forbidden from adopting the maxim of\nrefusing to develop any of our own.\n6. The Humanity Formula\n\nMost philosophers who find Kant\u2019s views attractive find them so\nbecause of the Humanity Formulation of the CI. This formulation states\nthat we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether\nin ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in\nitself. This is often seen as introducing the idea of\n\u201crespect\u201d for persons, for whatever it is that is\nessential to our humanity. Kant was clearly right that this and the\nother formulations bring the CI \u201ccloser to intuition\u201d than\nthe Universal Law formula. Intuitively, there seems something wrong\nwith treating human beings as mere instruments with no value beyond\nthis. But this very intuitiveness can also invite\nmisunderstandings.\n\nFirst, the Humanity Formula does not rule out using people as means to\nour ends. Clearly this would be an absurd demand, since we apparently\ndo this all the time in morally appropriate ways. Indeed, it is hard\nto imagine any life that is recognizably human without the use of\nothers in pursuit of our goals. The food we eat, the clothes we wear,\nthe chairs we sit on and the computers we type at are gotten only by\nway of talents and abilities that have been developed through the\nexercise of the wills of many people. What the Humanity Formula rules\nout is engaging in this pervasive use of humanity in such a way that\nwe treat it as a mere means to our ends. Thus, the difference\nbetween a horse and a taxi driver is not that we may use one but not\nthe other as a means of transportation. Unlike a horse, the taxi\ndriver\u2019s humanity must at the same time be treated as an end in\nitself.\n\nSecond, it is not human beings per se but the\n\u201chumanity\u201d in human beings that we must treat as an end in\nitself. Our \u201chumanity\u201d is that collection of features that\nmake us distinctively human, and these include capacities to engage in\nself-directed rational behavior and to adopt and pursue our own ends,\nand any other rational capacities necessarily connected with these.\nThus, supposing that the taxi driver has freely exercised his rational\ncapacities in pursuing his line of work, we make permissible use of\nthese capacities as a means only if we behave in a way that he could,\nwhen exercising his rational capacities, consent to \u2014 for\ninstance, by paying an agreed on price.\n\nThird, the idea of an end has three senses for Kant, two positive\nsenses and a negative sense. An end in the first positive sense is a\nthing we will to produce or bring about in the world. For instance, if\nlosing weight is my end, then losing weight is something I aim to\nbring about. An end in this sense guides my actions in that once I\nwill to produce something, I then deliberate about and aim to pursue\nmeans of producing it if I am rational. Humanity is not an\n\u201cend\u201d in this sense, though even in this case, the end\n\u201clays down a law\u201d for me. Once I have adopted an end in\nthis sense, it dictates that I do something: I should act in ways that\nwill bring about the end or instead choose to abandon my goal.\n\nAn end in the negative sense lays down a law for me as well, and so\nguides action, but in a different way. Korsgaard (1996) offers\nself-preservation as an example of an end in a negative sense: We do\nnot try to produce our self-preservation. Rather, the end of\nself-preservation prevents us from engaging in certain kinds of\nactivities, for instance, picking fights with mobsters, and so on.\nThat is, as an end, it is something I do not act against in\npursuing my positive ends, rather than something I produce.\n\nHumanity is in the first instance an end in this negative sense: It is\nsomething that limits what I may do in pursuit of my other\nends, similar to the way that my end of self-preservation limits what\nI may do in pursuit of other ends. Insofar as it limits my\nactions, it is a source of perfect duties. Now many of our\nends are subjective in that they are not ends that every rational\nbeing must have. Humanity is an objective end, because it is\nan end that every rational being must have. Hence, my own humanity as\nwell as the humanity of others limit what I am morally\npermitted to do when I pursue my other, non-mandatory, ends.\n\nThe humanity in myself and others is also a positive end,\nthough not in the first positive sense above, as something to be\nproduced by my actions. Rather, it is something to realize, cultivate\nor further by my actions. Becoming a philosopher, pianist or novelist\nmight be my end in this sense. When my end is becoming a pianist, my\nactions do not, or at least not simply, produce something, being a\npianist, but constitute or realize the activity of being a pianist.\nInsofar as the humanity in ourselves must be treated as an end in\nitself in this second positive sense, it must be cultivated,\ndeveloped or fully actualized. Hence, the humanity in oneself is the\nsource of a duty to develop one\u2019s talents or to\n\u201cperfect\u201d one\u2019s humanity. When one makes one\u2019s\nown humanity one\u2019s end, one pursues its development, much as\nwhen one makes becoming a pianist one\u2019s end, one pursues the\ndevelopment of piano playing. And insofar as humanity is a positive\nend in others, I must attempt to further their ends as well. In so\ndoing, I further the humanity in others, by helping further the\nprojects and ends that they have willingly adopted for themselves. It\nis this sense of humanity as an end-in-itself on which some of\nKant\u2019s arguments for imperfect duties rely.\n\nFinally, Kant\u2019s Humanity Formula requires \u201crespect\u201d\nfor the humanity in persons. Proper regard for something with absolute\nvalue or worth requires respect for it. But this can invite\nmisunderstandings. One way in which we respect persons, termed\n\u201cappraisal respect\u201d by Stephen Darwall (1977), is clearly\nnot the same as the kind of respect required by the Humanity Formula:\nI may respect you as a rebounder but not a scorer, or as a researcher\nbut not as a teacher. When I respect you in this way, I am positively\nappraising you in light of some achievement or virtue you possess\nrelative to some standard of success. If this were the sort of respect\nKant is counseling then clearly it may vary from person to person and\nis surely not what treating something as an end-in-itself requires.\nFor instance, it does not seem to prevent me from regarding\nrationality as an achievement and respecting one person as a rational\nagent in this sense, but not another. And Kant is not telling us to\nignore differences, to pretend that we are blind to them on mindless\negalitarian grounds. However, a distinct way in which we respect\npersons, referred to as \u201crecognition respect\u201d by Darwall,\nbetter captures Kant\u2019s position: I may respect you because you\nare a student, a Dean, a doctor or a mother. In such cases of\nrespecting you because of who or what you are, I am giving the proper\nregard to a certain fact about you, your being a Dean for instance.\nThis sort of respect, unlike appraisal respect, is not a matter of\ndegree based on your having measured up to some standard of\nassessment. Respect for the humanity in persons is more like\nDarwall\u2019s recognition respect. We are to respect human beings\nsimply because they are persons and this requires a certain sort of\nregard. We are not called on to respect them insofar as they have met\nsome standard of evaluation appropriate to persons. And, crucially for\nKant, persons cannot lose their humanity by their misdeeds \u2013\neven the most vicious persons, Kant thought, deserve basic respect as\npersons with humanity.\n7. The Autonomy Formula\n\nThe third formulation of the CI is \u201cthe Idea of the will of\nevery rational being as a will that legislates universal\nlaw.\u201d (G 4:432). Although Kant does not state this as an\nimperative, as he does in the other formulations, it is easy enough to\nput it in that form: Act so that through your maxims you could be a\nlegislator of universal laws. This sounds very similar to the first\nformulation. However, in this case we focus on our status as universal\nlaw givers rather than universal law followers. This\nis of course the source of the very dignity of humanity Kant speaks of\nin the second formulation. A rational will that is merely bound by\nuniversal laws could act accordingly from natural and non-moral\nmotives, such as self-interest. But in order to be a legislator of\nuniversal laws, such contingent motives, motives that rational agents\nsuch as ourselves may or may not have, must be set aside. Hence, we\nare required, according to this formulation, to conform our behavior\nto principles that express this autonomy of the rational will \u2014\nits status as a source of the very universal laws that obligate it. As\nwith the Humanity Formula, this new formulation of the CI does not\nchange the outcome, since each is supposed to formulate the very same\nmoral law, and in some sense \u201cunite\u201d the other\nformulations within it. Kant takes each formulation that succeeds the\nfirst in its own way as bringing the moral law \u201ccloser to\nfeeling\u201d. The Autonomy Formula presumably does this by putting\non display the source of our dignity and worth, our status as free\nrational agents who are the source of the authority behind the very\nmoral laws that bind us.\n8. The Kingdom of Ends Formula\n\nThis formulation has gained favor among Kantians in recent years (see\nRawls, 1971; Hill, 1972). Many see it as introducing more of a social\ndimension to Kantian morality. Kant states that the above concept of\nevery rational will as a will that must regard itself as enacting laws\nbinding all rational wills is closely connected to another concept,\nthat of a \u201csystematic union of different rational beings under\ncommon laws\u201d, or a \u201cKingdom of Ends\u201d (G 4:433). The\nformulation of the CI states that we must \u201cact in accordance\nwith the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely\npossible kingdom of ends\u201d (G 4:439). It combines the others in\nthat (i) it requires that we conform our actions to the laws of an\nideal moral legislature, (ii) that this legislature lays down\nuniversal laws, binding all rational wills including our own, and\n(iii) that those laws are of \u201ca merely possible kingdom\u201d\neach of whose members equally possesses this status as legislator of\nuniversal laws, and hence must be treated always as an end in itself.\nThe intuitive idea behind this formulation is that our fundamental\nmoral obligation is to act only on principles which could earn\nacceptance by a community of fully rational agents each of whom have\nan equal share in legislating these principles for their\ncommunity.\n9. The Unity of the Formulas\n\nKant claimed that all of these CI formulas were equivalent.\nUnfortunately, he does not say in what sense. What he says is\nthat these \u201care basically only so many formulations of precisely\nthe same law, each one of them by itself uniting the other two within\nit,\u201d and that the differences between them are \u201cmore\nsubjectively than objectively practical\u201d in the sense that each\naims \u201cto bring an Idea of reason closer to intuition (by means\nof a certain analogy) and thus nearer to feeling\u201d (G 4:435). He\nalso says that one formula \u201cfollows from\u201d another (G\n4:431), and that the concept foundational to one formula \u201cleads\nto a closely connected\u201d concept at the basis of another formula\n(G 4:433). Thus, his claim that the formulations are equivalent could\nbe interpreted in a number of ways.\n\nKant\u2019s statement that each formula \u201cunites the other two\nwithin it\u201d initially suggests that the formulas are equivalent\nin meaning, or at least one could analytically derive one\nformula from another. Some of Kant\u2019s commentators, for example,\nhave argued along the following lines: That I should always treat\nhumanity as an end in itself entails that I should act only on maxims\nthat are consistent with themselves as universal laws of nature\n(O\u2019Neill 1975, 1990; Engstrom 2009; Sensen 2011). There are\nremaining doubts some commentators have, however, about whether this\nstrategy can capture the full meaning of the Humanity Formula or\nexplain all of the duties that Kant claims to derive from it (Wood\n1999, 2007; Cureton 2013).\n\nPerhaps, then, if the formulas are not equivalent in meaning, they are\nnevertheless logically interderivable and hence equivalent in this\nsense. The universal law formula is not itself derived, as some of\nKant\u2019s interpreters have suggested, from the principle of\nnon-contradiction. That would have the consequence that the CI is a\nlogical truth, and Kant insists that it is not or at least that it is\nnot analytic. Since the CI formulas are not logical truths, then, it\nis possible that they could be logically interderivable. However,\ndespite his claim that each contains the others within it, what we\nfind in the Groundwork seems best interpreted as a derivation\nof each successive formula from the immediately preceding formula.\nThere are, nonetheless, a few places in which it seems that Kant is\ntrying to work in the opposite direction. One is found in his\ndiscussion of the Humanity Formula. There Kant says that only\nsomething \u201cwhose existence in itself had an absolute\nworth\u201d could be the ground of a categorically binding law (G\n4:428). He then boldly proclaims that humanity is this absolutely\nvaluable thing, referring to this as a \u201cpostulate\u201d that he\nwill argue for in the final chapter of the Groundwork (G\n4:429n). One might take this as expressing Kant\u2019s intention to\nderive thereby the universal law formula from the Humanity Formula:\nIf something is absolutely valuable, then we must\nact only on maxims that can be universal laws. But (he postulates)\nhumanity is absolutely valuable. Thus, we must act only on\nmaxims that can be universal laws. This (we think) anomalous\ndiscussion may well get at some deep sense in which Kant thought the\nformulations were equivalent. Nonetheless, this derivation of the\nuniversal law formulation from the Humanity Formulation seems to\nrequire a substantive, synthetic claim, namely, that humanity\nis indeed absolutely valuable. And if it does require this, then,\ncontrary to Kant\u2019s own insistence, the argument of\nGroundwork II does not appear to be merely an\nanalytic argument meant simply to establish the content of the moral\nlaw.\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation of the claim that the formulas\nare equivalent is as the claim that following or applying each formula\nwould generate all and only the same duties (Allison 2011). This seems\nto be supported by the fact that Kant used the same examples through\nthe Law of Nature Formula and the Humanity Formula. Thus, the\nUniversal Law Formulation generates a duty to \u03c6 if and only if the\nHumanity Formula generates a duty to \u03c6, (and so on for the other\nformulations). In other words, respect for humanity as an end in\nitself could never lead you to act on maxims that would generate a\ncontradiction when universalized, and vice versa. This way of\nunderstanding Kant\u2019s claim also fits with his statement that\nthere is no \u201cobjective practical difference\u201d between the\nformulations although there are \u201csubjective\u201d differences.\nThe subjective differences between formulas are presumably differences\nthat appeal in different ways to various conceptions of what morality\ndemands of us. But this difference in meaning is compatible with there\nbeing no practical difference, in the sense that conformity to one\nformulation cannot lead one to violate another formulation.\n10. Autonomy\n\nAt the heart of Kant\u2019s moral theory is the idea of autonomy.\nMost readers interpret Kant as holding that autonomy is a property of\nrational wills or agents. Understanding the idea of autonomy was, in\nKant\u2019s view, key to understanding and justifying the authority\nthat moral requirements have over us. As with Rousseau, whose views\ninfluenced Kant, freedom does not consist in being bound by no law,\nbut by laws that are in some sense of one\u2019s own making. The idea\nof freedom as autonomy thus goes beyond the merely\n\u201cnegative\u201d sense of being free from causes on our\nconduct originating outside of ourselves. It contains first and\nforemost the idea of laws made and laid down by oneself, and, in\nvirtue of this, laws that have decisive authority over oneself.\n\nKant\u2019s basic idea can be grasped intuitively by analogy with the\nidea of political freedom as autonomy (See Reath 1994). Consider how\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making \u2014 created\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\ninternal to \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d It is because the\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\nKant\u2019s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\nsuch a principle. Hence, the \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d of the CI\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person\u2019s own\nrational will. It is because each person\u2019s own reason is the\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).\n\nKant argues that the idea of an autonomous will emerges from a\nconsideration of the idea of a will that is free \u201cin a negative\nsense.\u201d The concept of a rational will is of a will that\noperates by responding to what it takes to be reasons. This is,\nfirstly, the concept of a will that does not operate through the\ninfluence of factors outside of this responsiveness to apparent\nreasons. For a will to be free is thus for it to be physically and\npsychologically unforced in its operation. Hence, behaviors that are\nperformed because of obsessions or thought disorders are not free in\nthis negative sense. But also, for Kant, a will that operates by being\ndetermined through the operation of natural laws, such as those of\nbiology or psychology, cannot be thought of as operating by responding\nto reasons. Hence, determination by natural laws is conceptually\nincompatible with being free in a negative sense.\n\nA crucial move in Kant\u2019s argument is his claim that a rational\nwill cannot act except \u201cunder the Idea\u201d of its own freedom\n(G 4:448). The expression \u201cacting under the Idea of\nfreedom\u201d is easy to misunderstand. It does not mean that a\nrational will must believe it is free, since determinists are\nas free as libertarians in Kant\u2019s view. Indeed, Kant goes out of\nhis way in his most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason,\nto argue that we have no rational basis for believing our\nwills to be free. This would involve, he argues, attributing a\nproperty to our wills that they would have to have as \u2018things in\nthemselves\u2019 apart from the causally determined world of\nappearances. Of such things, he insists, we can have no knowledge. For\nmuch the same reason, Kant is not claiming that a rational will cannot\noperate without feeling free. Feelings, even the feeling of\noperating freely or the \u201clooseness\u201d Hume refers to when we\nact, cannot be used in an a priori argument to establish the\nCI, since they are empirical data.\n\nOne helpful way to understand acting \u201cunder the Idea of\nfreedom\u201d is by analogy with acting \u201cunder the Idea\u201d\nthat there are purposes in nature: Although there is, according to\nKant, no rational basis for the belief that the natural world is (or\nis not) arranged according to some purpose by a Designer, the actual\npractices of science often require looking for the purpose of this or\nthat chemical, organ, creature, environment, and so on. Thus, one\nengages in these natural sciences by searching for purposes in nature.\nYet when an evolutionary biologist, for instance, looks for the\npurpose of some organ in some creature, she does not after all thereby\nbelieve that the creature was designed that way, for\ninstance, by a Deity. Nor is she having some feeling of\n\u201cdesignedness\u201d in the creature. To say that she\n\u201cacts under the Idea of\u201d design is to say something about\nthe practice of biology: Practicing biology involves searching for the\npurposes of the parts of living organisms. In much the same way,\nalthough there is no rational justification for the belief that our\nwills are (or are not) free, the actual practice of practical\ndeliberation and decision consists of a search for the right causal\nchain of which to be the origin \u2014 consists, that is, seeking to\nbe the first causes of things, wholly and completely through the\nexercise of one\u2019s own will.\n\nKant says that a will that cannot exercise itself except under the\nIdea of its freedom is free from a practical point of view\n(im practischer Absicht). In saying such wills are free from\na practical point of view, he is saying that in engaging in practical\nendeavors \u2014 trying to decide what to do, what to hold oneself\nand others responsible for, and so on \u2014 one is justified in\nholding oneself to all of the principles to which one would be\njustified in holding wills that are autonomous free wills. Thus, once\nwe have established the set of prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives that would bind an autonomous free will, we then hold\nourselves to this very same of set prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives. And one is justified in this because rational agency can\nonly operate by seeking to be the first cause of its actions, and\nthese are the prescriptions, and so on, of being a first cause of\naction. Therefore, rational agents are free in a negative sense\ninsofar as any practical matter is at issue.\n\nCrucially, rational wills that are negatively free must be autonomous,\nor so Kant argues. This is because the will is a kind of\ncause\u2014willing causes action. Kant took from Hume the idea that\ncausation implies universal regularities: if x causes\ny, then there is some universally valid law connecting\nXs to Ys. So, if my will is the cause of my\n\u03c6ing, then \u03a6ing is connected to the sort of willing I engage\nin by some universal law. But it can\u2019t be a natural law, such as\na psychological, physical, chemical or biological law. These laws,\nwhich Kant thought were universal too, govern the movements of my\nbody, the workings of my brain and nervous system and the operation of\nmy environment and its effects on me as a material being. But they\ncannot be the laws governing the operation of my will; that, Kant\nalready argued, is inconsistent with the freedom of my will in a\nnegative sense. So, the will operates according to a universal law,\nthough not one authored by nature, but one of which I am the origin or\nauthor. And that is to say that, in viewing my willing to \u03c6 as a\nnegatively free cause of my \u03c6ing, I must view my will as the\nautonomous cause of my having \u03c6ed, as causing my having \u03c6ed by\nway of some law that I, insofar as I am a rational will, laid down for\nmy will.\n\nThus, Kant argues, a rational will, insofar as it is rational, is a\nwill conforming itself to those laws valid for any rational will.\nAddressed to imperfectly rational wills, such as our own, this becomes\nan imperative: \u201cConform your action to a universal non-natural\nlaw.\u201d Kant assumed that there was some connection between this\nformal requirement and the formulation of the CI which enjoins us to\n\u201cAct as though the maxim of your action were to become by your\nwill a universal law of nature.\u201d But, as commentators have long\nnoticed (see, e.g. , Hill, 1989a, 1989b), it is not clear what the\nlink is between the claim that rational autonomous wills conform\nthemselves to whatever universally valid laws require, and the more\nsubstantial and controversial claim that you should evaluate your\nmaxims in the ways implied by the universal law of nature\nformulation.\n\nKant appeared not to recognize the gap between the law of an\nautonomous rational will and the CI, but he was apparently unsatisfied\nwith the argument establishing the CI in Groundwork III for\nanother reason, namely, the fact that it does not prove that we really\nare free. In the Critique of Practical Reason, he states that\nit is simply a \u201cfact of reason\u201d (Factum der\nVernunft) that our wills are bound by the CI, and he uses this to\nargue that our wills are autonomous. Hence, while in the\nGroundwork Kant relies on a dubious argument for our autonomy\nto establish that we are bound by the moral law, in the second\nCritique, he argues from the bold assertion of our being\nbound by the moral law to our autonomy.\n\nThe apparent failure of Kant\u2019s argument to establish the\nautonomy of the will, and hence the authority of moral demands over\nus, has not deterred his followers from trying to make good on this\nproject. One strategy favored recently has been to turn back to the\narguments of Groundwork II for help. Kant himself repeatedly\nclaimed that these arguments are merely analytic but that they do not\nestablish that there is anything that answers to the concepts he\nanalyzes. The conclusions are thus fully compatible with morality\nbeing, as he puts it, a \u201cmere phantom of the brain\u201d (G\n4:445). Kant clearly takes himself to have established that rational\nagents such as ourselves must take the means to our ends, since this\nis analytic of rational agency. But there is a chasm between this\nanalytic claim and the supposed synthetic conclusion that rational\nagency also requires conforming to a further, non-desire based,\nprinciple of practical reason such as the CI. Nevertheless, some see\narguments in Groundwork II that establish just this. These\nstrategies involve a new \u201cteleological\u201d reading of\nKant\u2019s ethics that relies on establishing the existence of an\nabsolute value or an \u201cend in itself\u201d (we say more about\nthis teleological reading below). They begin with Kant\u2019s own\nstated assumption that there is such an end in itself if and only if\nthere is a categorical imperative binding on all rational agents as\nsuch. If this assumption is true, then if one can on independent\ngrounds prove that there is something which is an end in itself, one\nwill have an argument for a categorical imperative. One such strategy,\nfavored by Korsgaard (1996) and Wood (1999) relies on the apparent\nargument Kant gives that humanity is an end in itself. Guyer, by\ncontrast, sees an argument for freedom as an end in itself (Guyer\n2000). Both strategies have faced textual and philosophical hurdles.\nConsiderable interpretive finesse, for instance, is required to\nexplain Kant\u2019s stark insistence on the priority of principles\nand law over the good in the second Critique (CPrR\n5:57\u201367)\n\nAlthough most of Kant\u2019s readers understand the property of\nautonomy as being a property of rational wills, some, such as Thomas\nE. Hill, have held that Kant\u2019s central idea is that of autonomy\nis a property, not primarily of wills, but of principles. The core\nidea is that Kant believed that all moral theories prior to his own\nwent astray because they portrayed fundamental moral principles as\nappealing to the existing interests of those bound by them. By\ncontrast, in Kant\u2019s view moral principles must not appeal to\nsuch interests, for no interest is necessarily universal. Thus, in\nassuming at the outset that moral principles must embody some interest\n(or \u201cheteronomous\u201d principles), such theories rule out the\nvery possibility that morality is universally binding. By contrast,\nthe Categorical Imperative, because it does not enshrine existing\ninterests, presumes that rational agents can conform to a principle\nthat does not appeal to their interests (or an\n\u201cautonomous\u201d principle), and so can fully ground our\nconception, according to Kant, of what morality requires of us.\n\nA different interpretive strategy, which has gained prominence in\nrecent years, focuses on Kant\u2019s apparent identification, in\nGroundwork III, of the will and practical reason. One natural\nway of interpreting Kant\u2019s conception of freedom is to\nunderstand it in terms of the freedom and spontaneity of reason\nitself. This in turn apparently implies that our wills are necessarily\naimed at what is rational and reasonable. To will something, on this\npicture, is to govern oneself in accordance with reason. Often,\nhowever, we fail to effectively so govern ourselves because we are\nimperfect rational beings who are caused to act by our\nnon\u2013rational desires and inclinations. The result, at least on\none version of this interpretation (Wolff 1973), is that we either act\nrationally and reasonably (and so autonomously) or we are merely\ncaused to behave in certain ways by non\u2013rational forces acting\non us (and so heteronomously). This is, however, an implausible view.\nIt implies that all irrational acts, and hence all immoral acts, are\nnot willed and therefore not free. Most interpreters have denied that\nthis is the proper interpretation of Kant\u2019s views. However,\nseveral prominent commentators nonetheless think that there is some\ntruth in it (Engstrom 2009; Reath 2015; Korsgaard 1996, 2008, 2009).\nThey agree that we always act under the \u201cguise of the\ngood\u201d in the sense that our will is necessarily aimed at what is\nobjectively and subjectively rational and reasonable, but these\ninterpreters also think that, for Kant, there is a middle\u2013ground\nbetween perfect conformity to reason and being caused to act by\nnatural forces. In particular, when we act immorally, we are either\nweak\u2013willed or we are misusing our practical reason by willing\nbadly. We do not have the capacity to aim to act on an immoral maxim\nbecause the will is identified with practical reason, so when we will\nto perform an immoral act, we implicitly but mistakenly take our\nunderlying policy to be required by reason. By representing our\nimmoral act as rational and reasonable, we are not exercising our\npowers of reason well, so we are simply making a \u201cchoice\u201d\nthat is contrary to reason without \u201cwilling\u201d it as such.\nOur choice is nonetheless free and attributable to us because our will\nwas involved in leading us to take the act to be rational and\nreasonable. It remains to be seen whether, on this complicated\ninterpretation of Kant, it sufficiently allows for the possibility\nthat one can knowingly and willingly do wrong if the will is practical\nreason and practical reason is, in part, the moral law.\n11. Non-rational Beings and Disabled Humans\n\nSeveral recent discussions of Kant\u2019s moral theory have focused\non understanding and assessing its implications for how we should\nregard and treat people with various kinds of disabilities. Kant does\nnot say much explicitly about those with disabilities, but his moral\nframework is often seen as both hostile to and supportive of the\ninterests of disabled people.\n\nOne of the most important criticisms of Kant\u2019s moral theory\nconcerns human beings with severe cognitive disabilities who lack the\nmoral capacities and dispositions that, according to Kant, are needed\nfor people to have dignity, be ends in themselves, possess moral\nrights, legislate moral laws, be a member of the kingdom of ends, or\notherwise have basic moral status (Kittay 2005, Vorhaus 2020, Barclay\n2020; cf. the SEP entry \n  cognitive disability and moral status).\nWhen we reflect on what makes us morally special, according to Kant,\nwe find that it is not our contingent properties, the biological\nspecies we belong to, or even our capacity to be conscious or to feel\npain. Kant argues that rational nature, specifically the moral\ncapacities and dispositions to legislate and follow moral principles,\nis what gives us inner worth and makes us deserving of respect (G\n4:428\u201336, 446\u20137; Rel 6:26). Our basic moral status does not come in\ndegrees. It is always equal to that of other people regardless of the\nlevel, if any, at which our moral capacities and dispositions are\ndeveloped, realized, or exercised. Infants and young children,\naccording to Kant, almost always have a moral nature even though their\nmoral capacities and dispositions are undeveloped or underdeveloped\n(MM 6:280\u20131, 422; see also Schapiro 1999). Virtually all people with\nDown Syndrome and autism have basic moral status even if their moral\ncapacities and dispositions are not as fully realized or exercised as\nthey are in other people. Being asleep or in a coma does not preclude\nsomeone from having basic moral status even if their moral capacities\nand dispositions are temporarily or permanently dormant. Some human\nbeings with significant cognitive disabilities, however, do not have\neven bare capacities or dispositions to recognize, accept, legislate,\nand follow moral norms. Kant seems to imply that anencephalic infants,\nthose in persistent vegetative states, and other human beings with the\nmost severe cognitive disabilities lack dignity and are not ends in\nthemselves. They are apparently excluded from the moral community in\nways that have unacceptable implications for how we should or should\nnot regard and treat them.\n\nThere is little or no evidence that Kant himself thought about this\nproblem, which is also connected with the moral status of many\nnon-human animals who seem to matter morally but who lack the moral\ncapacities and dispositions that, according to Kant, are necessary for\nbasic moral status.  Kant\u2019s defenders have nonetheless explored\nwhat his basic moral framework might imply about the moral status of\nthose with severe cognitive disabilities. One approach is simply to\nbite the bullet by admitting that people with certain severe cognitive\ndisabilities lack the basic moral status that others of us share (Wood\n1998, Sussman 2001. (This general strategy is deployed by Regan and\nfollowed by Wood, McMahan, Warren, Merkel, and others. For the claim\nthat such humans are not persons, on Kant\u2019s theory, see also\nSussman, Idea, 242.) Proponents of this view can emphasize\nthat, although we do not have duties to such people, we can have\nduties regarding them, such as duties of moral self-improvement that\ngive us reasons to treat those with significant cognitive disabilities\nhumanely for the sake of improving how we treat other human beings\nwith basic moral status (MM 6:442) or duties of beneficence that give\nus reasons to care for them as a kindness to their families (G 4:430).\nPragmatic considerations might also give us reasons to err on the side\nof caution when it comes to assessing whether someone entirely lacks\nthe moral capacities and dispositions that ground basic moral status.\nBecause of difficulties making such determinations and the moral risks\ninvolved in judging incorrectly, we should perhaps assume, unless we\nhave very strong evidence to the contrary, that each human being has\nbasic moral status (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nA second approach to addressing the problem of moral status for those\nwith significant cognitive disabilities is to emphasize passages in\nwhich Kant says all human beings have dignity or are ends in\nthemselves (G 4:428\u201329; MM 6:410) and to argue that, according\nto Kant\u2019s theories of biology and psychology, all human beings,\nincluding those with severe cognitive disabilities, necessarily have\nthe requisite features of moral personhood (Kain 2009). A third\napproach is to draw on and perhaps supplement some of Kant\u2019s\nmoral views by, for example, arguing that because we value things, we\nmust value ourselves as ends, which in turn commits us to valuing all\nhuman and non-human animals as ends (Korsgaard 2020) or that respect\nfor all human beings is a constitutive feature of rational agency that\ndoes not depend on any intrinsic properties of the objects of\nrespect (Sensen 2018).\n\nIn addition to discussing the moral status of people with severe\ncognitive disabilities, Kantian philosophers have also been exploring\nhow his moral theory applies to other moral issues that concern how we\nshould regard and treat people with disabilities. Although\nKant\u2019s focus was on specifying principles for all circumstances\nor for all human contexts, he recognized that a complete specification\nof his system of moral duties, ends, and ideals must include\napplications of basic moral standards to particular contexts and\ngroups of people (MM 6:468\u20139). \n\nWhen prospective parents choose not to produce children that would\nlikely have disabilities, they might express disrespectful attitudes\nabout existing people with disabilities (Velleman 2015, Sussman 2018).\nPeople with disabilities are often ridiculed, abused, treated as\nchildren, denied opportunities to continue developing their natural\nabilities in, for example, assisted living facilities that instead\nemphasize their comfort, and excluded from friendships or other forms\nof solidarity in ways that arguably violate moral duties that Kant\ndescribes (Cureton 2021, Hill 2020). They often face obstacles to\ndeveloping and maintaining self-respect by those who regard them as,\nfor example, burdensome, malingering, or curiosities (Stohr 2018).\nPeople with disabilities also tend to receive assistance from others\nthat is incompatible with the respect they are owed. Beneficence,\naccording to Kant, must be tempered by respect so that we do not, for\nexample, impose burdensome obligations of gratitude on a blind person\nwho would rather navigate to the next conference session herself,\n\u201chelp\u201d a Deaf person by offering to pay for cochlear\nimplants that he does not want, finish the sentences of someone with a\nspeech impediment in ways that express condescension or pity, or\nmistake a strict duty to install a wheelchair ramp as an optional duty\nof charity (Cureton 2016, Holtman 2018).\n12. Virtue and Vice\n\nKant defines virtue as \u201cthe moral strength of a human\nbeing\u2019s will in fulfilling his duty\u201d (MM 6:405) and\nvice as principled immorality (MM 6:390). This definition appears to\nput Kant\u2019s views on virtue at odds with classical views such as\nAristotle\u2019s in several important respects.\n\nFirst, Kant\u2019s account of virtue presupposes an account of moral\nduty already in place. Thus, rather than treating admirable character\ntraits as more basic than the notions of right and wrong conduct, Kant\ntakes virtues to be explicable only in terms of a prior account of\nmoral or dutiful behavior. He does not try to make out what shape a\ngood character has and then draw conclusions about how we ought to act\non that basis. He sets out the principles of moral conduct based on\nhis philosophical account of rational agency, and then on that basis\ndefines virtue as a kind of strength and resolve to act on those\nprinciples despite temptations to the contrary.\n\nSecond, virtue is, for Kant, strength of will, and hence does not\narise as the result of instilling a \u201csecond nature\u201d by a\nprocess of habituating or training ourselves to act and feel in\nparticular ways. It is indeed a disposition, but a disposition of\none\u2019s will, not a disposition of emotions, feelings, desires or\nany other feature of human nature that might be amenable to\nhabituation. Moreover, the disposition is to overcome obstacles to\nmoral behavior that Kant thought were ineradicable features of human\nnature. Thus, virtue appears to be much more like what Aristotle would\nhave thought of as a lesser trait, viz., continence or\nself-control.\n\nThird, in viewing virtue as a trait grounded in moral principles, and\nvice as principled transgression of moral law, Kant thought of himself\nas thoroughly rejecting what he took to be the Aristotelian view that\nvirtue is a mean between two vices. The Aristotelian view, he claimed,\nassumes that virtue typically differs from vice only in terms of\ndegree rather than in terms of the different principles each involves\n(MM 6:404, 432). Prodigality and avarice, for instance, do not differ\nby being too loose or not loose enough with one\u2019s means. They\ndiffer in that the prodigal person acts on the principle of acquiring\nmeans with the sole intention of enjoyment, while the avaricious\nperson acts on the principle of acquiring means with the sole\nintention of possessing them.\n\nFourth, in classical views the distinction between moral and non-moral\nvirtues is not particularly significant. A virtue is some sort of\nexcellence of the soul, but one finds classical theorists treating wit\nand friendliness alongside courage and justice. Since Kant holds moral\nvirtue to be a trait grounded in moral principle, the boundary between\nnon-moral and moral virtues could not be more sharp. Even so, Kant\nshows a remarkable interest in non-moral virtues; indeed, much of\nAnthropology is given over to discussing the nature and\nsources of a variety of character traits, both moral and\nnon-moral.\n\nFifth, virtue cannot be a trait of divine beings, if there are such,\nsince it is the power to overcome obstacles that would not be present\nin them. This is not to say that to be virtuous is to be the victor in\na constant and permanent war with ineradicable evil impulses or\ntemptations. Morality is \u201cduty\u201d for human beings because\nit is possible (and we recognize that it is possible) for our\ndesires and interests to run counter to its demands. Should all of our\ndesires and interests be trained ever so carefully to comport with\nwhat morality actually requires of us, this would not change in the\nleast the fact that morality is still duty for us. For should this\ncome to pass, it would not change the fact that each and every desire\nand interest could have run contrary to the moral law. And it\nis the fact that they can conflict with moral law, not the\nfact that they actually do conflict with it, that makes duty\na constraint, and hence is virtue essentially a trait concerned with\nconstraint.\n\nSixth, virtue, while important, does not hold pride of place in\nKant\u2019s system in other respects. For instance, he holds that the\nlack of virtue is compatible with possessing a good will (G 6: 408).\nThat one acts from duty, even repeatedly and reliably can thus be\nquite compatible with an absence of the moral strength to overcome\ncontrary interests and desires. Indeed, it may often be no challenge\nat all to do one\u2019s duty from duty alone. Someone with a good\nwill, who is genuinely committed to duty for its own sake, might\nsimply fail to encounter any significant temptation that would reveal\nthe lack of strength to follow through with that commitment. That\nsaid, he also appeared to hold that if an act is to be of genuine\nmoral worth, it must be motivated by the kind of purity of motivation\nachievable only through a permanent, quasi-religious conversion or\n\u201crevolution\u201d in the orientation of the will of the sort\ndescribed in Religion. Until one achieves a permanent change\nin the will\u2019s orientation in this respect, a revolution in which\nmoral righteousness is the nonnegotiable condition of any of\none\u2019s pursuits, all of one\u2019s actions that are in\naccordance with duty are nevertheless morally worthless, no matter\nwhat else may be said of them. However, even this revolution in the\nwill must be followed up with a gradual, lifelong strengthening of\none\u2019s will to put this revolution into practice. This suggests\nthat Kant\u2019s considered view is that a good will is a will in\nwhich this revolution of priorities has been achieved, while a\nvirtuous will is one with the strength to overcome obstacles to its\nmanifestation in practice.\n\nKant distinguishes between virtue, which is strength of will to do\none\u2019s duty from duty, and particular virtues, which are\ncommitments to particular moral ends that we are morally required to\nadopt. Among the virtues Kant discusses are those of self-respect,\nhonesty, thrift, self-improvement, beneficence, gratitude,\nsociability, and forgiveness. Kant also distinguishes vice, which is a\nsteadfast commitment to immorality, from particular vices, which\ninvolve refusing to adopt specific moral ends or committing to act\nagainst those ends. For example, malice, lust, gluttony, greed,\nlaziness, vengefulness, envy, servility, contempt and arrogance are\nall vices in Kant\u2019s normative ethical theory.\n\n(Interest in Kant\u2019s conception of virtue has rapidly grown in\nrecent years.

Normative Ethical Theory\n\nThe Categorical Imperative, in Kant\u2019s view, is an objective,\nunconditional and necessary principle of reason that applies to all\nrational agents in all circumstances. Although Kant gives several\nexamples in the Groundwork that illustrate this principle, he\ngoes on to describe in later writings, especially in The\nMetaphysics of Morals, a complicated normative ethical theory for\ninterpreting and applying the CI to human persons in the natural\nworld. His framework includes various levels, distinctions and\napplication procedures. Kant, in particular, describes two subsidiary\nprinciples that are supposed to capture different aspects of the CI.\nThe Universal Principle of Right, which governs issues about justice,\nrights and external acts that can be coercively enforced, holds that\n\u201cAny action is right if it can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on\nits maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law\u201d (MM\n6:230). The Supreme Principle of the Doctrine of Virtue, which governs\nquestions about moral ends, attitudes, and virtue, requires us to\n\u201cact in accordance with a maxim of ends that it can be\na universal law for everyone to have\u201d (MM 6:395). These\nprinciples, in turn, justify more specific duties of right and of\nethics and virtue.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s framework, duties of right are narrow and perfect\nbecause they require or forbid particular acts, while duties of ethics\nand virtue are wide and imperfect because they allow significant\nlatitude in how we may decide to fulfill them. For example, Kant\nclaims that the duty not to steal the property of another person is\nnarrow and perfect because it precisely defines a kind of act that is\nforbidden. The duty of beneficence, on the other hand, is\ncharacterized as wide and imperfect because it does not specify\nexactly how much assistance we must provide to others.\n\nEven with a system of moral duties in place, Kant admits that judgment\nis often required to determine how these duties apply to particular\ncircumstances. Moral laws, Kant says, \u201cmust be meticulously\nobserved\u201d but \u201cthey cannot, after all, have regard to\nevery little circumstance, and the latter may yield exceptions, which\ndo not always find their exact resolution in the laws\u201d (V\n27:574; see also CPR A133/B172; MM 6:411).\n14. Teleology or Deontology?\n\nThe received view is that Kant\u2019s moral philosophy is a\ndeontological normative theory at least to this extent: it denies that\nright and wrong are in some way or other functions of goodness or\nbadness. It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological\nmoral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of\nteleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action\nof all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best\noverall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the\nrightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might\nfocus instead on character traits. \u201cVirtue ethics\u201d asserts\nthat a right action in any given circumstance is that action a\nvirtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this\ncase, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or\nwould perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both\ncases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And\nKant\u2019s own views have typically been classified as deontological\nprecisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny\njust what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of\nKant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character.\n\nThere are several reasons why readers have thought that Kant denies\nthe teleological thesis. First, he makes a plethora of statements\nabout outcomes and character traits that appear to imply an outright\nrejection of both forms of teleology. For instance, in\nGroundwork I, he says that he takes himself to have argued\nthat \u201cthe objectives we may have in acting, and also our\nactions\u2019 effects considered as ends and what motivates our\nvolition, can give to actions no unconditional or moral\nworth\u2026[this] can be found nowhere but in the principle of the\nwill, irrespective of the ends that can be brought about by such\naction\u201d (G 4: 400). This appears to say that moral rightness is\nnot a function of the value of intended or actual outcomes. Kant\nsubsequently says that a categorical imperative \u201cdeclares an\naction to be objectively necessary of itself without reference to any\npurpose\u2014that is, even without any further end\u201d (G 4:415).\nA categorical imperative \u201ccommands a certain line of conduct\ndirectly, without assuming or being conditional on any further goal to\nbe reached by that conduct\u201d (G 4:416). These certainly appear to\nbe the words of someone who rejects the idea that what makes actions\nright is primarily their relationship to what good may come of those\nactions, someone who rejects outright the act consequentialist form of\nteleology. Moreover, Kant begins the Groundwork by noting\nthat character traits such as the traditional virtues of courage,\nresolution, moderation, self-control, or a sympathetic cast of mind\npossess no unconditional moral worth, (G 4:393\u201394,\n398\u201399). If the moral rightness of an action is grounded in the\nvalue of the character traits of the person who performs or would\nperform it then it seems Kant thinks that it would be grounded in\nsomething of only conditional value. This certainly would not comport\nwell with the virtue ethics form of teleology.\n\nSecond, there are deeper theoretical claims and arguments of\nKant\u2019s in both the Groundwork and in the second\nCritique that appear to be incompatible with any sort of\nteleological form of ethics. These claims and arguments all stem from\nKant\u2019s insistence that morality is grounded in the autonomy of a\nrational will. For instance, Kant states that \u201cif the will seeks\nthe law that is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of\nits maxims for its own giving of universal law\u2026heteronomy\nalways results\u201d (G 4:441). If the law determining right and\nwrong is grounded in either the value of outcomes or the value of the\ncharacter of the agent, it seems it will not be found in the fitness\nof the action\u2019s maxim to be a universal law laid down by the\nagent\u2019s own rational will. And Kant\u2019s most complete\ntreatment of value, the second Critique\u2019s \u201cOn the\nConcept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason\u201d, appears to be a\nrelentless attack on any sort of teleological moral theory. \u201cThe\nconcept of good and evil\u201d he states, \u201cmust not be\ndetermined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this\nconcept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here)\nafter it and by means of it\u201d (CPrR 5:63).\n\nA number of Kant\u2019s readers have come to question this received\nview, however. Perhaps the first philosopher to suggest a teleological\nreading of Kant was John Stuart Mill. In the first chapter of his\nUtilitarianism, Mill implies that the Universal Law\nformulation of the Categorical Imperative could only sensibly be\ninterpreted as a test of the consequences of universal adoption of a\nmaxim. Several 20th century theorists have followed Mill\u2019s\nsuggestion, most notably, R. M. Hare. Hare argued that moral judgments\nsuch as \u201cStealing is wrong\u201d are in fact universal\nprescriptions (\u201cNo stealing anywhere by anyone!\u201d). And\nbecause they are universal, Hare argued, they forbid making\nexceptions. That in turn requires moral judgments to give each\nperson\u2019s wellbeing, including our own, equal weight. And when we\ngive each person\u2019s wellbeing equal weight, we are acting to\nproduce the best overall outcome. Thus, in his view, the CI is\n\u201csimply utilitarianism put into other words\u201d (1993, p.\n103). More recently, David Cummiskey (1996) has argued that\nKant\u2019s view that moral principles are justified because they are\nuniversalizable is compatible with those principles themselves being\nconsequentialist. Indeed, Cummiskey argues that they must be: Respect\nfor the value of humanity entails treating the interests of each as\ncounting for one and one only, and hence for always acting to produce\nthe best overall outcome.\n\nThere are also teleological readings of Kant\u2019s ethics that are\nnon-consequentialist. Barbara Herman (1993) has urged philosophers to\n\u201cleave deontology behind\u201d as an understanding of\nKant\u2019s moral theory on the grounds that the conception of\npractical reason grounding the Categorical Imperative is itself a\nconception of value. Herman\u2019s idea is that Kant never meant to\nsay that no value grounds moral principles. That, she argues, would\nimply that there would be no reason to conform to them. Instead, Kant\nthought the principles of rationality taken together constitute\nrational agency, and rational agency so constituted itself functions\nas a value that justifies moral action (1993, 231). Herman\u2019s\nproposal thus has Kant\u2019s view grounding the rightness of actions\nin rational agency, and then in turn offering rational agency itself\nup as a value. Both Paul Guyer and Allen Wood have offered proposals\nthat differ from Herman\u2019s in content, but agree on the general\nform of teleology that she defends as a reading of Kant. Guyer argues\nthat autonomy itself is the value grounding moral requirements. Moral\nthinking consists in recognizing the priceless value of a rational\nagent\u2019s autonomous will, something in light of whose value it is\nnecessary for any rational agent to modify his behavior (1998,\n22\u201335). And Wood argues that humanity itself is the grounding\nvalue for Kant. While the second Critique claims that good\nthings owe their value to being the objects of the choices of rational\nagents, they could not, in his view, acquire any value at all if the\nsource of that value, rational agency, itself had no value (1999, 130;\nsee also 157\u20138). Finally, Rae Langton has argued that if\nKant\u2019s theory is to be thought of as an objectivistic view, we\nmust suppose that the value of humanity and the good will are\nindependent of simply being the objects of our rational choices. If\ntheir value thereby becomes the source of the rightness of our actions\n\u2014 say, our actions are right if and because they treat that\nself-standing value in various ways \u2014 then her reading too is\nteleological.\n\nIt is of considerable interest to those who follow Kant to determine\nwhich reading \u2014 teleological or deontological \u2014 was\nactually Kant\u2019s, as well as which view ought to have been his. A\npowerful argument for the teleological reading is the motivation for\nHerman\u2019s proposal: What rationale can we provide for doing our\nduty at all if we don\u2019t appeal to it\u2019s being good to do\nit? But a powerful argument for the deontological reading is\nKant\u2019s own apparent insistence that the authority of moral\ndemands must come simply from their being the demands of a rational\nwill, quite apart from the value that will may have (see Schneewind\n1996; Johnson 2007, 2008; and Reath 1994). On the latter view, moral\ndemands gain their authority simply because a rational will, insofar\nas you are rational, must will them. Proponents of this reading are\nleft with the burden of answering Herman\u2019s challenge to provide\na rationale for having willed such demands, although one response may\nbe that the very question Herman raises does not make sense because it\nasks, in effect, why it is rational to be rational. On the former\nview, by contrast, a rationale is at hand: because your will is,\ninsofar as it is rational, good. Proponents of this former reading\nare, however, then left with the burden of explaining how it could be\nthe autonomy of the will alone that explains the authority of\nmorality.\n15. Metaethics\n\nIt has seemed to a number of Kant\u2019s interpreters that it is\nimportant to determine whether Kant\u2019s moral philosophy was\nrealist, anti-realist or something else (e.g. a constructivist). The\nissue is tricky because terms such as \u201crealism,\u201d\n\u201canti-realism\u201d and \u201cconstructivism\u201d are terms\nof art, so it is all too easy for interlocutors to talk past one\nanother.\n\nOne relevant issue is whether Kant\u2019s views commit him to the\nthesis that moral judgments are beliefs, and so apt to be evaluated\nfor their truth or falsity (or are \u201ctruth apt\u201d).\n\nOne might have thought that this question is quite easy to settle. At\nthe basis of morality, Kant argued, is the Categorical Imperative, and\nimperatives are not truth apt. It makes little sense to ask whether\n\u201cLeave the gun, take the cannoli.\u201d is true. But, in fact,\nthe question is not at all easy. For one thing, moral judgments such\nas \u201cLying is wrong\u201d might well be best analyzed according\nto Kant\u2019s views as \u201cThe Categorical Imperative commands us\nnot to lie\u201d, and this judgment is not an imperative, but a\nreport about what an imperative commands. Thus while at the foundation\nof morality there would be an imperative which is not truth apt,\nparticular moral judgments themselves would describe what that\nimperative rules out and so would themselves be truth apt.\n\nPhilosophers such as R.M. Hare, however, have taken Kant\u2019s view\nto be that moral judgments are not truth apt. Although on the surface\nmoral judgments can look as if they describe a moral world, they are,\nas Hare reads Kant, \u201cprescriptions\u201d, not\n\u201cdescriptions\u201d. This is not, in his view, to say that\nKant\u2019s ethics portrays moral judgments as lacking objectivity.\nObjectivity, according to Hare, is to be understood as universality,\nand the Categorical Imperative prescribes universally.\n\nA second issue that has received considerable attention is whether\nKant is a metaethical constructivist or realist.\n\nConstructivism in metaethics is the view that moral truths are, or are\ndetermined by, the outcomes of actual or hypothetical procedures of\ndeliberation or choice. Many who interpret Kant as a constructivist\nclaim that his analysis of \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cgood\nwill\u201d reveals that if there are moral requirements then the\nagents who are bound to them have autonomy of the will (Rawls 1980;\nKorsgaard 1996; O\u2019Neil 1989; Reath 2006; Hill 1989a, 1989b,\n2001; Cureton 2013, 2014; Engstrom 2009). Autonomy, in this sense,\nmeans that such agents are both authors and subjects of the moral law\nand, as such, are not bound by any external requirements that may\nexist outside of our wills. Instead, we are only subject to moral\nrequirements that we impose on ourselves through the operation of our\nown reason independently of our natural desires and inclinations. The\ncommon error of previous ethical theories, including sentimentalism,\negoism and rationalism, is that they failed to recognize that morality\npresupposes that we have autonomy of the will. These theories\nmistakenly held that our only reasons to be moral derive from\nhypothetical imperatives about how to achieve given moral ends that\nexist independently of the activity of reason itself (for a discussion\nof Kant\u2019s more specific objections to previous ethical theories,\nsee Schneewind 2009). On these interpretations, Kant is a skeptic\nabout arbitrary authorities, such as God, natural feelings, intrinsic\nvalues or primitive reasons that exist independently of us. Only\nreason itself has genuine authority over us, so we must exercise our\nshared powers of reasoned deliberation, thought and judgment, guided\nby the Categorical Imperative as the most basic internal norm of\nreason, to construct more specific moral requirements. Kantians in\nthis camp, however, disagree about how this rational procedure should\nbe characterized.\n\nOther commentators interpret Kant as a robust moral realist (Ameriks\n2003; Wood 1999; Langton 2007; Kain 2004). According to these\nphilosophers, Kant\u2019s theory, properly presented, begins with the\nclaim that rational nature is an objective, agent-neutral and\nintrinsic value. The moral law then specifies how we should regard and\ntreat agents who have this special status. Autonomy of the will, on\nthis view, is a way of considering moral principles that are grounded\nin the objective value of rational nature and whose authority is thus\nindependent of the exercise of our wills or rational capacities.\n\nSome interpreters of Kant, most notably Korsgaard (1996), seem to\naffirm a kind of quietism about metaethics by rejecting many of the\nassumptions that contemporary metaethical debates rest on. For\nexample, some of these philosophers seem not to want to assert that\nmoral facts and properties just are the outcomes of deliberative\nprocedures. Rather, they seem more eager to reject talk of facts and\nproperties as unnecessary, once a wholly acceptable and defensible\nprocedure is in place for deliberation. That is, the whole framework\nof facts and properties suggests that there is something we need to\nmoor our moral conceptions to \u201cout there\u201d in reality, when\nin fact what we only need a route to a decision. Once we are more\nsensitive to the ethical concerns that really matter to us as rational\nagents, we will find that many of the questions that animate\nmetaethicists turn out to be non-questions or of only minor\nimportance. Others have raised doubts, however, about whether Kantians\ncan so easily avoid engaging in metaethical debates (Hussain &\nShaw 2013).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Recent Commentaries on Kant\u2019s Ethical Writings", "Other Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<p>\nKant\u2019s original German and Latin writings can be found in\nK\u00f6niglichen Preu\u00dfischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (ed.),\n1900\u2013, Kants gesammelte Schriften, Berlin: Walter De Gruyter.\nMost translations include volume and page numbers to this standard\nAcademy edition.
