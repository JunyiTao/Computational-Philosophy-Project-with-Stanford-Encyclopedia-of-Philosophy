He wants\nto eliminate entities from his ontology. Some time between 1908 and\n1910 he begins to deny the existence of propositions and this denial\ncontinues until he develops a theory of propositions as structures of\nimages or words in (1918). What, then, is the fate of propositional\nfunctions? It might seem difficult to understand what a propositional\nfunction is without the existence of propositions, but Russell's view\nis, not that complicated.  Russell only rejects false propositions. He\nretains facts in his ontology. Propositional functions, in\nPrincipia, are what we now call \u2018partial\nfunctions\u2019. That is to say, they do not always have values. For\nexample, the propositional function\n__ is a dog does not have a value for the Sydney Opera House\ntaken as an argument, but it does have a value when my dog is taken as\nits argument. So, the rejection of false propositions does not cause a\nserious problem for the theory of propositional functions in\nRussell.\nHaving dealt with that problem, let us go on to see what Whitehead\nand Russell think the nature of propositional functions is. In\nPrincipia, they say:\n\nBy a \u2018propositional function\u2019 we mean something which\ncontains a variable x, and expresses a proposition as soon\nas a value is assigned to x. That is to say, it differs from a\nproposition solely by the fact that it is ambiguous: it contains a\nvariable of which the value is unassigned. (1910, 38).\n\nIn this passage, it seems as though they are saying that a\npropositional function is an ambiguous proposition. In light of the\nrejection of propositions, this view is especially hard to\nunderstand. Urquhart (2003) says that for Whitehead and Russell, a\npropositional function is something rather like a formula. This seems\nright, since propositional functions contain variables.\nBut what exactly are propositional functions in Principia?\nThis is a matter of heated debate among Russell scholars. Perhaps the\nmost influential interpretation is the constructive interpretation,\ndue to Kurt G\u00f6del (1944). On this interpretation, propositional\nfunctions are human constructs of some sort. They depend on our\nability to think about them or refer to them. A version of the\nconstructive interpretation can also be found in Linsky (1999). There\nis also a more nominalist interpretation in Landini (1998). On the\nrealist side, are the interpretations given by Alonzo Church (1984)\nand Warren Goldfarb (1989). Goldfarb thinks that the logical theory of\nPrincipia is motivated by Russell's attempt to find the real\nnature of propositional functions and that this nature is independent\nof our thinking about it. Goldfarb has a good point, since Russell's\nlogic is supposed to be a perspicuous representation of the way things\nare. But Russell often seems to deny that propositional functions are\nreal entities.\n",
