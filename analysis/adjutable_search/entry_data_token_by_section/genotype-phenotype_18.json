    "main_text": "What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies || What Counts is Underneath or Inside the Observable Surface\n6.4 What Counts is Underneath or Inside the Observable Surface\n\nThe genotype-phenotype distinction can also signify that the\nsurface\u2014phenotype\u2014is mere appearance; what is underneath\nor inside that surface\u2014the genotype\u2014is what counts. A\nsmall irony, given that the phenotype originated in relation to\ninferring genotypes (in the sense of a class that shared something\nunobservable), is that, to the extent that molecular biology has made\nDNA sequences observable, especially at sites in which the sequences\nvary from one group to another, each genotype (in the sense of a pair\nof genes or DNA sequence) becomes another phenotype (Nachtomy et al.\n2009). During the development of an organism, each of these\ngenotypes-as-phenotypes at time 0 interacts with the rest of the\nphenotype and environmental factors to produce the phenotype at time\n1, 2, and so on. It may well be the case that germ cells arise at some\npoint in the life course that are buffered from most of these\ninteractions. However, with respect to conceptualizing development\nfrom time 0 till death, nothing logically makes the genotype not also\na phenotype.\n\nIn any case, the view is widespread that what counts is underneath or\ninside. It is evident in the definition of evolution as change in gene\nfrequencies and the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. It can also be seen in many other features of\ndiscourses around heredity, such as the following:\n\n An oft-repeated assertion is that random mutations in genes are\nthe ultimate source of variation on which evolution builds. This\nassertion discounts the reassortment of genes into new combinations of\ngenotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) that occurs with every\nsexual reproduction and with the recombination after crossing over of\nchromosomes that occurs in many species, as well as with niche\nconstruction and novel response to environmental conditions that can\noccur during development.\n Discussions of the unit of selection, typically a gene or\ngenotype (in the sense of a specific pair of genes), often assume or\nimply that, when organisms are shown to enjoy differential survival\nand reproductive success because of the effect of some trait they\npossess, it is actually because they possess some gene or genotype. In\nsome accounts, the organism becomes the \u201cselfish\u201d\ngene\u2019s way of making copies of itself. Such a picture is a\nvariant of a theme with a long history, namely, the living being is an\nagent directed by some other agent, such as in theology when the soul\nis given by the grace of God.\n The use of the term phenotype for a trait suggests a direct\nassociation with some genotype even when there is no program, let\nalone a method, to expose which genotypes influence the trait.\n The claim is made that all disease is genetic. The corresponding\nprograms of genetic medicine, personalized genomics, and precision\nmedicine, propose or promise to identify and make therapeutic use of\ngenetically determined disease susceptibility in individual patients.\nNot only do such programs discount the environmental and social\naspects of epidemiological trends in many diseases, but, as evident\nwhen genetic oncologists use the term \u201cfamilial cancer\u201d in\ncontrast to hereditary cancers, this conception of heredity brings\nback what Johannsen had sought to expunge, namely, thinking about the\ntransmission of peculiar or acquired traits.\n Invocation of \u201cgenetic tendency\u201d without a method to\ninfer it from analysis of traits\u2014even when done by commentators\ncritical of claims made about genetics, as in \u201csimply because a\ngenetic tendency exists does not mean it will be phenotypically\nexpressed\u201d (Jesser 2002, 42).\n It is now popular to boast that \u201cit\u2019s in our\nDNA\u201d, in the sense of a core value that is beyond question for\nan organization or group.\n\n",
