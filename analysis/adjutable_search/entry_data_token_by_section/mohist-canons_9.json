    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || \u201cPresenting\u201d and Communication\n4.2 \u201cPresenting\u201d and Communication\n\nSpeaking or \u201cstating\u201d (y\u00e1n \u8a00) in\ngeneral consists of a series of \u201cpresentings\u201d (A32).\n\u201cPresenting\u201d something is explained as a form of\n\u201cemulating\u201d or \u201cpresenting a model for\u201d it\n(A31). The Mohist view seems to be that names function as models of\ntheir referents, in effect \u201cshowing\u201d others what the\nspeaker is talking about (B53). Using a name of something is\n\u201cdescribing\u201d or \u201ccharacterizing\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) it, just as if we drew a picture of it\n(A32). (This idea might be motivated by the pictographic roots of\nChinese writing.) If we \u201cpresent\u201d our friend as an example\nof a rich merchant, then we are using our friend\u2019s name to show\nwhat a rich merchant is (B53). \n\n\u201cPresenting\u201d (j\u01d4 \u8209) is related to but\ndistinct from the contemporary concept of reference or denotation.\nWords can refer to or denote objects, but names cannot\n\u201cpresent\u201d sh\u00ed (objects, reality). Rather,\nspeakers use names to \u201cpresent\u201d\nsh\u00ed \u5be6. English concepts similar to\nj\u01d4 \u8209 include \u201craise\u201d and \u201cbring\nup,\u201d as in sentences such as \u201cMary raised a question\u201d\nnd \u201cMary brought up a possible candidate for the job.\u201d\nIn contexts where we might speak of a word or a speaker\nreferring to an object, early Chinese texts typically use the\nexpressions zh\u01d0 \u6307 (point, indicate)\nor w\u00e8i \u8b02 (call) instead of\nj\u01d4 \u8209 (present, bring up). \n\nThe Mohists\u2019 theory that using names to talk about things is a\nmatter of modeling them can be seen as one version of the commonsense\nidea that words represent or signify things. But the Mohist notion of\n\u201cemulating\u201d (n\u01d0 \u64ec) goes beyond this\nbasic idea. It is part of a broader theory that names of\nkinds\u2014general terms\u2014enable us to communicate by appeal to\nshared practices for distinguishing similar from different kinds of\nthings. On the Mohist view, words can represent things because they\nshow us what the thing the speaker \u201cpresents\u201d is \u201cthe same\nas\u201d (t\u00f3ng \u540c). They show us this because\nwe have previously learned to distinguish the similar kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e) of thing denoted by that name. Given\nthis background learning, language tells us what something is\n\u201clike\u201d (ru\u00f2 \u82e5) and thus enables us\nto know (zh\u012b \u77e5) the thing (B70). When someone\nuses a word to present something, we know that thing is \u201cthe\nsame\u201d as other things denoted by that word. Hence using words is\na process of \u201cusing what people understand to rectify what they\ndon\u2019t know\u201d (B70). The Mohists compare this to using a\nmeasuring tool. We can use a ruler to measure length because we know\nthe length of the marks on the ruler and we see that the thing\nmeasured is the same length as one of the marks. Analogously, through\nlanguage, we can use what listeners are familiar with to inform them\nabout what they don\u2019t know. By using a name of something, we\nindicate that the thing is relevantly similar to the other things\nconventionally referred to by that name. When we say something is\n\u201cwhite,\u201d we are indicating that it is the same color as\nthe other things we call \u201cwhite.\u201d By grasping the\nreference of each other\u2019s words in this way, we are able to\n\u201cconnect thoughts\u201d (t\u014dng y\u00ec\n\u901a\u610f) (B41) and thus to communicate. \n\nAs this conception of communication as \u201cconnecting\nthoughts\u201d suggests, the Mohists see language as enabling\nspeakers to express their y\u00ec \u610f (thought,\nintention, point) (A92), a view shared by other early Chinese theories\nof language, including those of the Xunzi and The Annals\nof Lu Buwei. However, the role of \u201cthought\u201d or\n\u201cintention\u201d (y\u00ec \u610f) in these ancient\nChinese theories is distinct from that of ideas, meanings, or\nintensions in certain familiar Western views. In Western folk\ntheory\u2014what we might call the Idea Theory or a\n \u201cdog-legged\u201d[9]\n theory of language\u2014a word\u2019s meaning is the mental idea it\nstands for, which in turn represents some object in the world. The\ncontent of the idea explains why the word is used as it is, such as\nwhy it refers to certain things and not others. A well-known\ndifficulty with this view is that it merely moves the explanandum back\na step, since the content and function of ideas, a set of inner,\nprivate symbols, is just as much in need of explication as the content\nand function of language, a set of outer, public ones. The Mohist\ntheory makes no detour through ideas or other mental entities to\nexplain semantic content. Instead, the reference of words is explained\nby similarity relations and by practices for distinguishing the kind\nof thing designated by each word. The thought (y\u00ec\n\u610f) expressed by language does not explain why words are used as\nthey are. Rather, the way words are used explains how it is that they\ncan express thoughts. \u201cExpressing thoughts\u201d (sh\u016b\ny\u00ec \u6292\u610f) (NO11) or \u201cconnecting\nthoughts\u201d (t\u014dng y\u00ec \u901a\u610f) (B41)\nis communication, the aim or result of using language, not an\nexplanation of why terms refer to the things they do. One canon (B41)\ndepicts a scenario in which we come to understand the thought\n(y\u00ec \u610f) of a speaker who uses an unfamiliar word\nby asking to what the word refers. The point is that if we can\ndetermine reference, we can communicate. There is no need to consider\nmeanings or \u201cideas\u201d corresponding to words, and indeed\nintensional concepts play no role in the Mohist theory. \n\nAccordingly, y\u00ec \u610f (thought) is typically\nassociated not with words (m\u00edng \u540d, names), as\none would expect if Chinese thinkers held an Idea Theory of meaning,\nbut with \u201cstatements\u201d (y\u00e1n \u8a00) and\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad). (An\n\u201cexpression,\u201d in ancient Chinese philosophy of language,\nis any string of two or more words used to communicate a thought.)\nUnderstanding the y\u00ec (thought) expressed by an\nassertion or command is in effect \u201cgetting the point.\u201d For\nthis reason, in some contexts y\u00ec (thought) plays a\nconceptual role resembling that of \u201cspeaker\u2019s\n meaning.\u201d[10]\n However, other passages suggest that it is not a semantic notion at\nall, but more akin to \u201cwhat one is thinking\u201d or\none\u2019s intentions. One canon tells us that \u201ctrustworthiness\nis statements agreeing with y\u00ec (thought)\u201d (A14),\na remark that is difficult to understand if y\u00ec is\ninterpreted as a semantic concept. For if y\u00ec (thought)\nwere speaker\u2019s meaning, then what speakers say could not fail to\nagree with their y\u00ec, and if it were literal meaning,\nthen failing to conform to it would show only that the speakers use\nwords incorrectly, not that they are untrustworthy. People are\ntrustworthy when what they say genuinely reflects what they have in\nmind, particularly what they intend to do. The best interpretation of\ny\u00ec in contexts concerning language, then, seems to be\nas a general notion of \u201cthought\u201d or a more specific notion\nof \u201cintention,\u201d and not as semantic\n meaning.[11]\n\n\nTo sum up, the Dialectics presents a theory of language on\nwhich reference is explained by speakers\u2019 associating\n\u201cnames\u201d with kinds of similar objects, events, or\nsituations (sh\u00ed \u5be6). Communication is explained\nby language users\u2019 familiarity with the kinds of similar things\nreferred to by \u201cnames.\u201d The relation between language and\nthe world is not explained by appeal to meanings, ideas, or concepts\nin the mind, nor abstract essences of things, but by practices for\ndistinguishing different kinds of similar objects. This naturalistic\ntheory seems highly plausible, as far as it goes. But it raises\nseveral crucial questions: How should things be divided into kinds?\nWhat makes things belong to one kind or another? What justifies\nrecognizing certain kinds rather than others? As we will see, a\nweakness in later Mohist thought is that they leave these questions\npartly unanswered. Their texts make it clear that they recognize the\nissues. Yet they lack an explicit, principled explanation of what\nsimilarities and differences should count in distinguishing kinds of\nthings and why. \n\nThese questions pertain not only to the Mohists\u2019 philosophy of\nlanguage, but to their epistemology. So before addressing them, we\nwill survey later Mohist epistemology and its relation to semantic\ntheory. \n",
