It is,\nnevertheless, a mistake to think of him as primarily a critical or\nnegative thinker: his criticisms rely on his positive doctrine, which\nin turn generates further questions. As for whether those are\ngenuinely philosophical questions, it is implicit in what has\nalready been said that he would not acknowledge such a category as the\n\u2018genuinely philosophical\u2019 if that is meant to\nimply questions which are different in kind from those of science. But\ncertainly he accepts that some questions are sufficiently general,\nabstract, and remote from observation, that they may be classified as\nphilosophical. At times he assimilates the questions with which he is\nconcerned to those which have traditionally occupied philosophers.\nEpistemology\u2014the theory of knowledge\u2014is a clear example,\nalthough Quine\u2019s approach to that subject is quite different\nfrom that of many philosophers.\n\nIn some places, Quine approaches epistemology through the problem of\nscepticism about the external world. But he has no room for the kind\nof scepticism which asks the following kind of question: even if our\nalleged knowledge, our science, is completely successful in its\npredictions, how do we know that it tells us the way the world really\nis? (See Alston, 1993.) Thus Quine says:\n\nOur scientific theory can go wrong, and precisely in the familiar way:\nthrough failure of predicted observation. But what if\u2026 we have\nachieved a theory that is conformable to every possible observation,\npast and future? In what sense could the world then be said to deviate\nfrom what the theory claims? Clearly in none\u2026. (1981,\n22; emphasis added)\n\n\nThis dismissal of one kind of scepticism is an example of\nQuine\u2019s naturalism, and indicates how he understands that\nidea.\n\nThere is, however, a way of understanding the sceptical question which\nQuine takes seriously. Philosophers have been concerned with the gap\nbetween what is given in experience and the knowledge that we take\nourselves to have. Quine invokes gestalt psychology and argues that\nthe simple sensory ideas which Berkeley and Hume had claimed were\ngiven by the senses are not in fact given, that we see things in\nthree-dimensions, for example, instead of having to infer the third.\nHe does not, however, conclude that there is no problem at all here.\nRather, he says, \u201cthe problem was real but wrongly viewed\u201d\n(1974, 2). Epistemology, as he sees it, is here \u201cconfronting a\nchallenge to natural science that arises from within natural\nscience.\u201d (loc. cit.). What is the challenge? It starts\nwith what Quine takes to be \u201ca finding of natural science\nitself\u2026 that our information about the world comes only through\nimpacts on our sensory receptors\u201d (1990a, 19). The sceptical\nchallenge is then: \u201cHow\u2026 could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces? In short, if our science\nwere true, how could we know it?\u201d (1974, 2).\n\nScepticism, understood in this fashion, is a challenge to\nQuine\u2019s form of naturalism. It questions whether our knowledge\ncan be accounted for in terms which are, by Quine\u2019s standards,\npurely naturalistic. Quine\u2019s response is thus to sketch an\nausterely naturalistic account of how our knowledge, and the cognitive\nlanguage in which that knowledge is embodied, arises, or might arise.\nThis project, as he sees it, is essential to the defence of his\nnaturalistic world-view. (Section 4. will go into more detail about\nthe project.)\n\nWhen Quine asks: \u201cHow\u2026 could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces?\u201d this is not a\nrhetorical question. It is, rather, a serious question, to be answered\nby deploying the full resources of our knowledge; it is a scientific\nquestion. Quine recognizes that the question, thus construed, is not\nexactly what earlier epistemologists had in mind, but argues that the\nchange is justified: \u201cA far cry, this, from the old\nepistemology. Yet it is no gratuitous change of subject matter, but an\nenlightened persistence rather in the original epistemological\nproblem.\u201d (1974, 3).\n",
