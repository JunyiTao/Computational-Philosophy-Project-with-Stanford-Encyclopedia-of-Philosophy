    "main_text": "The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow? || Fictionalism\n6.2 Fictionalism\n\nOne possibility is to explain the internal/external distinction by\nreference to fictions. Internal statements are statements made within\nor relative to a fiction, and they are to be assessed as true or false\nrelative to the fiction.\n\nHowever, any fictionalist interpretation of the internal/external\ndistinction would have to explain why the fiction of propositions,\nlike the fictions of properties and numbers, is not a mere game, but\ncan be used for describing reality. We will briefly discuss a kind of\nfictionalism designed to do just this: figuralism. (For\ndiscussion, see Yablo (2000, 2001), Yablo and Rayo (2001), Yablo and\nGallois (1998), and for a similar view, Balaguer 1998a and 1998b).\n\nRelying on pioneering work by Kendall Walton (1990), Yablo argues that\npretense can serve serious practical and theoretical purposes. To use\nWalton\u2019s example, by pretending that Italy is a boot, I can\neasily convey to you the location of the Italian town of Crotone. Here\nI am, in effect, using a pretense to convey information about the real\nworld. Literally, Italy is not a boot, but my interest is not in\nspeaking the literal truth, but in conveying a rather complicated fact\nto you as effectively as I can. Similarly, Yablo and Gallois claim,\none may pretend there are certain entities in order to better convey\ncertain facts (1998, 245\u20138). One might pretend there are\ndirections in order to facilitate communication of facts about which\nlines stand in which geometric relations to which other ones. Perhaps\none could do the same with propositions?\n\nHowever, Yablo (2001) emphasizes that the figuralist need not be\ncommitted to any psychological thesis about making-believe.\nWe may not consciously pretend that there are propositions when we say\nthat what we believe is true, just as we may not consciously pretend\nthat there are such things as stomach butterflies when we say we have\nbutterflies in our stomach. Figuralism requires only that there is a\nsemantical distinction between literal content and figurative content,\nand that by asserting sentences with certain false or at least highly\ndoubtful literal contents, we may also express genuine facts, which\nwould be well nigh impossible to express literally. (See Balaguer\n1998a and 1998b on the concept of representational aids)\n\nFiguralism makes it possible to diagnose the failure of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument as follows. If its steps are interpreted\nliterally, the argument is unsound but valid. If its steps are\ninterpreted figuratively, it is sound. Why are we fooled, then? One\npromising suggestion is that it can be very difficult to distinguish\nfigurative from literal content, particularly when the figures\nemployed have little presentational force.\n\nIf we accept this diagnosis, we are committed to thinking that every\nbelief-ascription is literally false. This is a bitter pill to\nswallow, though it may seem less bitter the less importance is placed\non literalness in communication (See Yablo 2001, p. 85).\n",
