    "main_text": "Life and philosophical works\n1. Life and philosophical works\n\n Berkeley was born in 1685 near Kilkenny, Ireland. After several\nyears of schooling at Kilkenny College, he entered Trinity College, in\nDublin, at age 15. He was made a fellow of Trinity College in\n1707 (three years after graduating) and was ordained in the Anglican\nChurch shortly thereafter. At Trinity, where the curriculum was\nnotably modern, Berkeley encountered the new science and philosophy of\nthe late seventeenth century, which was characterized by hostility\ntowards Aristotelianism. Berkeley\u2019s philosophical notebooks\n(sometimes styled the Philosophical Commentaries), which he\nbegan in 1707, provide rich documentation of Berkeley\u2019s early\nphilosophical evolution, enabling the reader to track the emergence of\nhis immaterialist philosophy from a critical response to Descartes,\nLocke, Malebranche, Newton, Hobbes, and others.\n\n Berkeley\u2019s first important published work, An Essay Towards a New\nTheory of Vision (1709), was an influential contribution to the\npsychology of vision and also developed doctrines relevant to his\nidealist project. In his mid-twenties, he published his most enduring\nworks, the Treatise concerning the Principles of Human\nKnowledge (1710) and the Three Dialogues between Hylas and\nPhilonous (1713), whose central doctrines we will examine\nbelow.\n\n In 1720, while completing a four-year tour of Europe as tutor to a\nyoung man, Berkeley composed De Motu, a tract on the\nphilosophical foundations of mechanics which developed his views on\nphilosophy of science and articulated an instrumentalist approach to\nNewtonian dynamics. After his continental tour, Berkeley returned to\nIreland and resumed his position at Trinity until 1724, when he was\nappointed Dean of Derry. At this time, Berkeley began developing his\nscheme for founding a college in Bermuda. He was convinced that Europe\nwas in spiritual decay and that the New World offered hope\nfor a new golden age. Having secured a charter and promises of funding\nfrom the British Parliament, Berkeley set sail for America in 1728,\nwith his new bride, Anne Forster. They spent three years in Newport,\nRhode Island, awaiting the promised money, but Berkeley\u2019s political\nsupport had collapsed and they were forced to abandon the project and\nreturn to Britain in 1731. While in America, Berkeley composed\nAlciphron,  a work of Christian apologetics directed\nagainst the \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d whom he took to be enemies of established\nAnglicanism. Alciphron is also a significant philosophical\nwork and a crucial source of Berkeley\u2019s views on language.\n\n Shortly after returning to London, Berkeley composed the Theory\nof Vision, Vindicated and Explained, a defense of his earlier\nwork on vision, and the Analyst, an acute and influential\ncritique of the foundations of Newton\u2019s calculus. In 1734 he was made\nBishop of Cloyne, and thus he returned to Ireland. It was here that\nBerkeley wrote his last, strangest, and best-selling (in his own\nlifetime) philosophical work. Siris (1744) has a three-fold\naim:  to establish the virtues of tar-water (a liquid prepared by\nletting pine tar stand in water) as a medical panacea, to provide\nscientific background supporting the efficacy of tar-water, and to\nlead the mind of the reader, via gradual steps, toward contemplation\nof God. Berkeley died in 1753, shortly after moving to Oxford to\nsupervise the education of his son George, one of the three out of\nseven of his children to survive childhood.\n",
