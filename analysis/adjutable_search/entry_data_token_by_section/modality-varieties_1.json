    "main_text": "Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality || The Data\n1.1 The Data\n\nThe idea that all and only the a priori truths are necessary\nwas thrown into serious doubt by the work of philosophers including\nHilary Putnam (1972) and Saul Kripke (1980). Kripke distinguishes\nbetween two different kinds of singular terms, rigid and\nnon-rigid ones. A so-called rigid designator is an\nexpression that singles out the same thing in all possible worlds.\nKripke argues that ordinary proper names like \u2018Al Gore\u2019\nare rigid. We can use this name to describe how things actually are,\ne.g., by saying \u2018Al Gore became vice president in 1993.\u2019\nIn such cases, the name picks out Al Gore. But we can equally use the\nname to describe how things stand in other possible worlds, e.g., by\nsaying, \u2018If Bill Clinton had chosen a different running mate, Al\nGore would not have become vice president.\u2019 In this case, we are\ntalking about a non-actualized possibility, and we use the name\n\u2018Al Gore\u2019 to describe this possibility. Moreover, we use\nthe name to say something about how things stand with Al Gore in that\npossibility. In general, when we use the name to describe any possible\nworld, we use it to talk about the same person, Al Gore. Other\nexamples of rigid designators include indexical expressions like the\nfirst-person pronoun \u2018I,\u2019 or the expression\n\u2018now.\u2019 When you use the term \u2018I\u2019 to describe\nany possible world, you are always picking out the same thing:\nyourself. Natural kind terms like \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018gold\u2019 can also be regarded as rigid terms, as they single\nout the same kinds in every possible world. Non-rigid singular term,\nby contrast, pick out different entities in different possible\nscenarios. The paradigmatic examples of non-rigid terms are\ndescriptions that are satisfied by different objects in different\npossible worlds. For example, \u2018the most annoying person in the\nhistory of the world\u2019 may pick out Fred in the actual world,\nwhile picking out Cleopatra in some other possible worlds.\n\nSingular terms can be introduced into the language with the help of\ndescriptions. There are two ways in which that can be done. On the one\nhand, we can stipulate that the singular term is to be\nsynonymous with the description, for example by laying down\nthat \u2018the morning star\u2019 is to mean the same as \u2018the\nlast celestial body to be seen in the morning.\u2019 When we use the\nexpression to describe another possible world, the new expression will\nsingle out whatever celestial body is the last one that can be seen in\nthe morning in that world. Since different things meet this condition\nin different worlds, the expression is non-rigid. On the other hand,\nwe may introduce a term with the stipulation that it is to be a rigid\ndesignator referring to whatever object actually satisfies\nthe description. For instance, we may lay it down that\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 is to refer rigidly to the object that is\nactually the last celestial body visible in the morning. Since that\nobject is Venus, the name will pick out Venus, not only when we use it\nto describe the actual world, but also when we (in the actual world)\nuse it to describe other possible worlds, including worlds where Venus\nis not the last planet visible in the morning.When a description is\nused to introduce a singular term in the second way, it merely serves\nto fix the reference of the term, but is not synonymous with it.\n\nNow consider a true identity statement that involves two rigid\ndesignators, such as\n\n(1)\n Mark Twain (if he\nexists) is Samuel Clemens.\n\n\nSince \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 pick\nout the same entity in every possible world where they pick out\nanything, this identity statement is a necessary truth. (Note that the\nstatement is conditionalized on Mark Twain\u2019s existence, which\nmakes it possible to avoid the question whether (1) is true in worlds\nwhere the two names pick out nothing.) But it is far from immediately\nobvious that (1) expresses something that can be known a\npriori. At least on the face of it, we may think that someone who\nknows her neighbor by the name of \u2018Samuel Clemens,\u2019 who\nhas read several stories by an author named \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nand who fails to realize that her neighbor and the author are\nidentical may not know that which is expressed by (1). Moreover, it\nmay seem that her ignorance is irremediable by reasoning alone, that\nshe requires empirical evidence to come to know that which is stated\nby (1).\n\nAnother type of apparent counterexample to the thesis that all and\nonly the a priori truths are necessary concerns sentences\nlike\n\n(2)\n If gold exists, then it has atomic number 79.\n\n\nIt seems plausible that it is an essential property of gold to have\natomic number 79: gold could not have (existed but) failed to have\nthat property. (A substance in another possible world that fails to\nhave atomic number 79 simply isn\u2019t gold, no matter how similar\nit may otherwise be to the gold of the actual world.) And yet it seems\nclear that it can only be known empirically that gold has that atomic\nnumber. So, while (2) is a necessary truth, what it says cannot be\nknown a priori. For another illustration of this phenomenon,\nsuppose that I point to the wooden desk in my office and say:\n\n(3)\n If this desk exists, it is made of wood.\n\n\nIt is arguably essential to this desk to be made of wood. A desk in\nanother possible world that isn\u2019t wooden simply can\u2019t be\nthis desk, no matter how similar it may otherwise be to my\ndesk. But it seems that we need empirical evidence to know that the\ndesk is made of wood. So, (3) is another apparent example of a\nnecessary a posteriori truth.\n\nJust as Kripke claims that some truths are necessary without being\na priori, he argues that a truth can be a priori\nwithout being necessary. To use an example of Gareth Evans\u2019s\n(1982), suppose that I introduce the term \u2018Julius\u2019 by\nstipulating that it is to refer rigidly to the person who is in fact\nthe inventor of the zip (if such a person exists). Then it may appear\nthat I don\u2019t need further empirical evidence to know that\n\n(4)\n If Julius exists, then Julius is the inventor of the zip.\n\n\nBut (4) does not seem to be a necessary truth. After all, Julius could\nhave become a salesperson rather than an inventor.\n\nAccording to Kripke, our initial surprise at the divergent extensions\nof a prioricity and necessity should be mitigated on reflection. A\nprioricity (epistemic necessity) is an epistemological\nnotion: it has to do with what can be known. That is not true of the\nconcept of necessity. (2) is necessary because the atomic number of\ngold is an essential feature of it, and on the face of it, that has\nnothing to do with what is known or believed by anyone. This kind of\nnecessity is a metaphysical notion, and we may use the term\n\u2018metaphysical necessity\u2019 to distinguish it more clearly\nfrom epistemic necessity.\n\nKripke\u2019s examples are not the only ones that could be appealed\nto in order to shed doubt on the coextensiveness of necessity and a\nprioricity. Some other problematic cases are listed below (Chalmers\n2002a; cp. Chalmers 2012, ch. 6).\n\nMathematical truths. It is common to hold that all\nmathematical truths are necessary. But on the face of it, there is no\nguarantee that all mathematical truths are knowable a priori\n(or knowable in any way at all). For example, either the continuum\nhypothesis or its negation is true, and whichever of these claims is\ntrue is also necessary. But for all we know, there is no way for us to\nknow that that proposition is true.\nLaws of nature. Some necessitarians about the natural\nlaws (see\n section 2)\n believe that the laws hold in all metaphysically possible worlds. But\nthey are not a priori truths.\nMetaphysical principles. It is often believed that many\nmetaphysical theses are necessary if true, e.g., theses about the\nnature of properties (e.g., about whether they are universals, sets or\ntropes) or ontological principles like the principle of unrestricted\nmereological composition (which says that for any things there is\nsomething that is their sum). But it is not obvious that all truths of\nthis kind are a priori. (For discussion, see Chalmers 2012,\n\u00a7\u00a76.4\u20136.5; Schaffer 2017.)\nPrinciples linking the physical and the mental. Some\nphilosophers hold that all truths about the mental are metaphysically\nnecessitated by the physical truths, but deny that it is possible to\nderive the mental truths from the physical ones by a priori\nreasoning (see Hill & McLaughlin 1999; Yablo 1999; Loar 1999; and\nChalmers 1999 for discussion). On that account, some of the\nconditionals that link physical and mental claims are metaphysically\nnecessary but not a priori.\n\n\nThese examples are controversial. For any given mathematical claim\nwhose truth-value is unknown, one could hold that it is only our\ncognitive limitations that have prevented us from establishing or\nrefuting the statement, and that the question could be decided by\nideal reasoning (so that the truth of the matter is a\npriori). Alternatively, it may be held that the truth-value of\nthe mathematical statement is indeterminate. (Perhaps our practices do\nnot completely determine the references of all the terms used in the\nmathematical claim). The same two options are available in the case of\nmetaphysical principles. Alternatively, one may argue that the\nrelevant metaphysical theses are merely contingent (see, e.g., Cameron\n2007). Necessitarianism about the natural laws is highly controversial\nand may simply be denied. And in response to (iv), one may deny that\nthe physical truths metaphysically necessitate the mental truths\n(Chalmers 1996), or one may hold that the mental truths can be derived\nfrom the physical ones by a priori reasoning (Jackson\n1998).\n\nPhilosophers have paid more attention to the examples given by Kripke\nthan to other possible cases of the necessary a posteriori,\nand for that reason the discussion in the rest of this section will\nmostly focus on Kripke\u2019s cases. Two strategies for explaining\nthese examples can be distinguished. Dualists about metaphysical and\nepistemic modality (dualists, for short) hold that the phenomena\nreflect a deep and fundamental distinction between two kinds of\nmodality. Monists, by contrast, believe that all the data can\nultimately be explained by appeal to a single kind of modality. They\nmay agree that there are cases in which a single sentence is, in some\nsense, both necessary and a posteriori, or both contingent\nand a priori. But they insist that there is no similar\ndistinction at the level of worlds or propositions. Rather, the\nphenomenon arises because a single sentence can be associated with two\ndifferent propositions, one that is necessary and another that is\ncontingent.\n",
