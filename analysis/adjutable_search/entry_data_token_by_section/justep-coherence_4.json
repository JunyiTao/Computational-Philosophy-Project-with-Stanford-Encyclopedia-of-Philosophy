Justification by Coherence from Scratch\n\nThe arguably most significant development of the coherence theory in\nrecent years has been the revival of C. I. Lewis\u2019s work and the\nresearch program he inspired by translating parts of the coherence\ntheory into the language of probability. The kind of coherence in\nquestion should be distinguished from a probability function being\ncoherent in the sense of conforming to the axioms of the probability\ncalculus. The theory of coherence that we are concerned with here is\nan application of such coherent probability functions to model\ncoherence as mutual support, agreement etc. Thus \u201cprobabilistic\ncoherence\u201d means something else than it does in standard\nBayesian theories. The probabilistic translations of coherence theory\nhas made it possible to define concepts and prove results with\nmathematical precision. It has also led to increased transferability\nof concepts and results across fields, e.g., between coherence theory\nand confirmation theory as it is studied in philosophy of science. As\na result, the study of coherence has developed into an\ninterdisciplinary research program with connections to philosophy of\nscience, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence and philosophy\nof law. The rest of this article will be devoted to this recent\ntransformation of the subject.\n\nTo introduce Lewis\u2019s view on the role of coherence, consider the\nfollowing famous passage on \u201crelatively unreliable witnesses who\nindependently tell the same story\u201d from his 1946 book:\n\nFor any one of these reports, taken singly, the extent to which it\nconfirms what is reported may be slight. And antecedently, the\nprobability of what is reported may also be small. But congruence of\nthe reports establishes a high probability of what they agree upon, by\nprinciples of probability determination which are familiar: on any\nother hypothesis than that of truth-telling, this agreement is highly\nunlikely; the story any one false witness might tell being one out of\nso very large a number of equally possible choices. (It is comparable\nto the improbability that successive drawings of one marble out of a\nvery large number will each result in the one white marble in the\nlot.) And the one hypothesis which itself is congruent with this\nagreement becomes thereby commensurably well established. (346)\n\n\nWhile Lewis allows that individual reports need not be very credible\nconsidered in isolation for coherence to have a positive effect, he is\nfirmly committed to the view that their credibility must not be nil.\nHe writes, in his discussion of reports from memory, that \u201c[i]f\n\u2026 there were no initial presumption attaching to the mnemically\npresented \u2026 then no extent of congruity with other such items\nwould give rise to any eventual credibility\u201d (357). In other\nwords, if the beliefs in a set have no initial credibility, then no\njustification will ensue from observing the coherence of that set.\nThus, Lewis is advocating weak foundationalism rather than a pure\ncoherence theory.\n\nIn apparent agreement with Lewis, Laurence BonJour (1985, 148) writes:\n\u201c[a]s long as we are confident that the reports of the various\nwitnesses are genuinely independent of each other, a high enough\ndegree of coherence among them will eventually dictate the hypothesis\nof truth telling as the only available explanation of their\nagreement.\u201d However, BonJour proceeds to reject Lewis\u2019s point\nabout the need for positive antecedent credibility: \u201c[w]hat\nLewis does not see, however, is that his own [witness] example shows\nquite convincingly that no antecedent degree of warrant or credibility\nis required\u201d (148). BonJour is here apparently denouncing\nLewis\u2019s claim that coherence will not have any confidence boosting\npower unless the sources are initially somewhat credible. BonJour is\nproposing that coherence can play this role even if there is no\nantecedent degree of warrant, so long as the witnesses are delivering\ntheir reports independently.\n\nSeveral authors have objected to this claim of BonJour\u2019s, arguing that\ncoherence does not have any effect on the probability of the report\ncontents if the independent reports lack individual credibility. The\nfirst argument to that effect was given by Michael Huemer (1997). A\nmore general proof in the same vein is presented in Olsson (2002).\nWhat follows is a sketch of the latter argument for the special case\nof two testimonies, couched essentially in the terminology of Huemer\n(2011). In the following, all probabilities are assumed to lie\nstrictly between 0 and 1.\n\nLet \\(E_1\\) be the proposition that the first witness\nreports that \\(A\\), and let \\(E_2\\) be the proposition\nthat the second witness reports that \\(A\\). Consider the following\nconditions:\n\nConditional Independence\n\\(P(E_2 \\mid E_1, A) = P(E_2 \\mid A)\\)\n\n\\(P(E_2 \\mid E_1,\\neg A) = P(E_2 \\mid \\neg A)\\)\n\n\nNonfoundationalism\n\\(P(A \\mid E_1) = P(A)\\)\n\n\\(P(A \\mid E_2) = P(A)\\)\n\n\nCoherence Justification\n\\(P(A \\mid E_1, E_2) \\gt P(A)\\)\n\n\nConditional independence is intended to capture the idea that the\ntestimonies are independent in the sense that there is no direct\ninfluence between the testimonies. The probability of a testimony is\ninfluenced only by the fact it reports on, meaning that once that fact\nis given, this \u201cscreens off\u201d any probabilistic influence\nbetween the individual testimonies making them irrelevant to each\nother. Nonfoundationalism states that neither testimony confers any\njustification upon \\(A\\) by itself: assuming merely that one single\nwitness has testified that \\(A\\) has no effect on the probability\nof \\(A\\). Finally, Coherence Justification states that testimonies,\nwhen combined, do provide justification for \\(A\\).\n\nThe debate between Lewis and BonJour can be reconstructed as a debate\nover the joint consistency of these three conditions. BonJour is\nclaiming that the conditions are jointly consistent, and that\nCoherence Justification follows from Conditional Independence even in\nthe context of Nonfoundationalism, whereas Lewis is rejecting these\nclaims. Olsson (2002) established that if the dispute is couched in\nthese terms, then Lewis was provably right. From Conditional\nIndependence and Nonfoundationalism it follows, via Bayes\u2019s theorem,\nthat\n\n\\[\nP(A \\mid E_1, E_2) = P(A)\n\\]\n\n\nso that combining collectively independent but individually useless\ntestimonies, however coherent, fails to give rise to anything useful.\n(As noted in Olsson, 2005, section 3.5, the matter is somewhat\ncomplicated by the fact that Lewis adopted a notion of independence\nthat is weaker than Conditional Independence. Ironically, Lewis\u2019s\nweaker notion turns out to be compatible with the combination of\nNonfoundationalism and Coherence Justification.)\n\nNonfoundationalism should be contrasted with the following\ncondition:\n\nWeak Foundationalism\n\\(P(A \\mid E_1) \\gt P(A)\\)\n\n\\(P(A \\mid E_2) \\gt P(A)\\)\n\n\nWeak Foundationalism does not by itself entail Coherence\nJustification: it is common knowledge in probability theory that even\nif two pieces of evidence each support a given conclusion, that\nsupport may disappear, or even turn into disconfirmation, if they are\ncombined. However, in the context of Conditional Independence, Weak\nFoundationalism does imply Coherence Justification. Indeed, the\ncombined testimonies will, in this case, confer more support upon the\nconclusion than the testimonies did individually. As confirmed by\nJames Van Cleve (2011), the conclusions supported by these\nconsiderations are that coherence can boost justification or\ncredibility that is already there without being able to create such\njustification or credibility from scratch.\n\nThere are various ways to save the coherence theory from this\nprobabilistic attack. The most radical strategy would be to dismiss\nthe probabilistic framework as altogether unsuitable for coherentism.\nIndependent reasons for this response can be found in Thagard\u2019s work\n(e.g., Thagard 2000 and 2005). A less radical approach would be to\nrefrain from any blanket dismissal of probability theory in this\ncontext but reject one of the premises of the troublesome proof. This\nis the strategy recently taken by Huemer, who now considers his 1997\nprobabilistic refutation of coherentism to be mistaken (Huemer 2011,\n39, footnote 6). While he thinks that Coherentist Justification\ncorrectly captures a minimal sense of coherentism, he reports\ndissatisfaction with both Conditional Independence and\nNonfoundationalism (his term for the latter is \u201cStrong\nNonfoundationalism\u201d). Huemer now thinks independence, in the\nintuitive sense, is better captured by the condition\n\\(P(E_2 \\mid E_1, A) \\gt P(E_2 \\mid E_1, \\neg A)\\).\nMoreover, he takes the condition \\(P(A \\mid E_1, \\neg E_2) = P(A)\\),\nor \u201cWeak Nonfoundationalism\u201d in his terminology, to be a\nmore suitable explication of nonfoundationalist intuitions than the\ncondition \\(P(A \\mid E_1) = P(A)\\). He goes on to show that they are jointly\nconsistent with Coherentist Justification: there are probability\ndistributions satisfying all three conditions. Thus the immediate\nthreat to coherentism presented by the observed inconsistency of the\nthree original conditions has been neutralized, even though a critic\nmight point out that the defense is weak since it has not been shown\nthat Coherence Justification follows from the two new conditions.\n\nWhatever merits Huemer\u2019s new conditions might have, their standing in\nthe literature is hardly comparable to that of the original\nconditions. Conditional Independence, for instance, is an extremely\npowerful and intuitive concept which has been put to fruitful use in\nmany areas in philosophy and computer science, the most spectacular\nexample being the theory of Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1985).\nSimilarly, the Nonfoundationalist condition is still the most widely\nused\u2014and many would say most natural\u2014way of stating, in\nthe language of probability theory, that a testimony fails to support\nthat which is testified. Thus, it would seem that coherentism is saved\nat the price of disconnecting it from the way in which probability\ntheory is standardly applied. Roche (2010) criticizes\nNonfoundationalism from another perspective. In his view, a close\nreading of BonJour reveals that the latter requires only that the\nwitness reports lack individual credibility in the sense that\n\\(P(A \\mid E_i) = 0.5\\) and not in the\nsense of \\(P(A \\mid E_i) = P(A)\\), which is the condition we called\nNonfoundationalism. Since the former does not entail the latter,\ncoherentists, to the extent that they follow BonJour, need not worry\nabout the joint inconsistency of Conditional Independence,\nNonfoundationalism and Coherence Justification. Still, this account of\nwhat it means to lack initial credibility is non-standard if taken as\na general characterization, and it may in the end be more charitable\nto interpret BonJour as not having subscribed to it. For an\nelaboration of this point the reader is referred to Olsson (2005, 65),\nfootnote 4. In later works, BonJour has gradually retracted from his\noriginal coherentist position (e.g., BonJour 1989 and 1999).\n",
