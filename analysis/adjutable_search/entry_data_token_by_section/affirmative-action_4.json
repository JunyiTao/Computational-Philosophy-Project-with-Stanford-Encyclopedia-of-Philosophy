    "main_text": "Real-World Affirmative Action: The University\n5. Real-World Affirmative Action: The University\n\n\nIn the 1970s, while campuses were embroiled in debate about how to\nincrease African-Americans and women on the faculty, universities were\nalso putting into effect schemes to increase minority presence within\nthe student body. Very selective universities, in particular, needed\nnew initiatives because only a handful of African-American and\nHispanic high school students possessed test scores and grades good\nenough to make them eligible for admission. These institutions faced a\nchoice: retain their admissions criteria unchanged and live with the\nupshot\u2014hardly any African-Americans and Hispanics on\ncampus\u2014or fiddle with their criteria to get a more substantial\nrepresentation. Most elected the second path.\n\n\nThe Medical School of the University of California at Davis\nexemplified a particularly aggressive approach. It reserved sixteen of\nthe one hundred slots in its entering classes for minorities. In 1973\nand again in 1974, Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was denied\nadmission although his test scores and grades were better than most or\nall of those admitted through the special program. He sued. In 1977,\nhis case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\nreached the Supreme Court. The Court rendered its decision a year\n later (438 U.S. 265 [1978]).[13]\n\n\nAn attentive reader of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act might have\nthought this case was an easy call. So, too, thought four justices on\nthe Supreme Court, who voted to order Bakke admitted to the Medical\nSchool. Led by Justice Stevens, they saw the racially segregated,\ntwo-track scheme at the Medical School (a recipient of federal funds)\nas a clear violation of the plain language of the Title.\n\n\nFour other members of the Court, led by Justice Brennan, wanted very\nkeenly to save the Medical School program. To find a more attractive\nterrain for doing battle, they made an end-run around Title VI, arguing\nthat, whatever its language, it had no independent meaning itself. It\nmeant in regard to race only what the Constitution\n meant.[14]\n Thus,\ninstead of having to parse the stingy and unyielding language of Title\nVI (\u201cno person shall be subjected to\u2026on the ground of\nrace\u201d), the Brennan group could turn their creative energies to\ninterpreting the broad and vague language of the Fourteenth Amendment\n(\u201cno person shall be denied the equal protection of the\nlaws\u201d), which provided much more wiggle-room for justifying\nracial preferences. The Brennan justices persuaded one other member,\nJustice Powell, to join them in their view of Title VI. But Powell\ndidn\u2019t agree with their view of the Constitution. He argued that the\nMedical School\u2019s policy was unconstitutional and voted that Bakke must\nbe admitted. His vote, added to the four votes of the Stevens group,\nmeant that Allan Bakke won his case and that Powell got to write the\nopinion of the Court. The Brennan strategy didn\u2019t reap the fruit it\nintended.\n\n\nAgainst the leanings of the Brennan group, who would distinguish\nbetween \u201cbenign\u201d and \u201cmalign\u201d uses of race and\ndeal more leniently with the former, Powell insisted that the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of \u201cequal protection of the\nlaw\u201d must mean the same thing for all, black and white alike. To\nparaphrase Powell:\n\n\nThe Constitution can tolerate no \u201ctwo-class\u201d theory of\nequal protection. There is no principled basis for deciding between\nclasses that deserve special judicial attention and those that don\u2019t.\nTo think otherwise would involve the Court in making all kinds of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d decisions it is not competent to make. In\nexpounding the Constitution, the Court\u2019s role is to discern\n\u201cprinciples sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout\nthe community and continuity over significant periods of time, and to\nlift them above the pragmatic political judgments of a particular time\nand place\u201d (Bakke, at 295\u2013300 [Powell quoting Cox 1976,\n114]).\n\n\n\n\nWhat, then, was the practical meaning of a \u201csufficiently\nabsolute\u201d rendering of the principle of equal protection? It was\nthis: when the decisions of state agents \u2018touch upon an\nindividual\u2019s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial\ndetermination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is\nprecisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental\n interest (Bakke, at 300).\n\n\n\n\nPowell, with this standard in hand, then turned to look at the four\nreasons the Medical School offered for its special program: (i) to\nreduce \u201cthe historic deficit of traditionally disfavored\nminorities in medical schools and the medical profession;\u201d (ii)\nto counter \u201cthe effects of societal discrimination;\u201d (iii)\nto increase \u201cthe number of physicians who will practice in\ncommunities currently underserved;\u201d and (iv) to obtain \u201cthe\neducational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student\n body\u201d (Bakke, at 307). Did any or all of them specify a\ncompelling governmental interest? Did they necessitate use of racial\npreferences?\n\n\nAs to the first reason, Powell dismissed it out of hand.\n\n\nIf [the School\u2019s] purpose is to assure within its student body some\nspecified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as\ninsubstantial but as facially invalid. Preferring members of any one\ngroup for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination\nfor its own sake.\n\n\nAs to the second reason, Powell allowed it more force. A state has a\nlegitimate interest in ameliorating the effects of past discrimination.\nEven so, contended Powell, the Court,\n\n\nhas never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as\nmembers of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other\ninnocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative, or\nadministrative findings of constitutional or statutory\n violations (Bakke, at 308).\n\n\n\nAnd the Medical School does not purport to have made, and is in no\nposition to make, such findings. Its broad mission is education, not\nthe formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of\nparticular claims of illegality.\u2026[I]solated segments of our vast\ngovernmental structures are not competent to make those decisions, at\nleast in the absence of legislative mandates and legislatively\ndetermined criteria (Bakke, at 309).\n\n\n\nAs to the third reason, Powell found it, too, insufficient. The\nMedical School provided no evidence that the best way it could\ncontribute to increased medical services to underserved communities was\nto employ a racially preferential admissions scheme. Indeed, the\nMedical School provided no evidence that its scheme would result in any\nbenefits at all to such\n communities (Bakke, at 311).\n\n\nThis left the fourth reason. Here Powell found merit. A university\u2019s\ninterest in a diverse student body is legitimated by the First\nAmendment\u2019s implied protection of academic freedom. This constitutional\nhalo makes the interest \u201ccompelling.\u201d However, the Medical\nSchool\u2019s use of a racial and ethnic classification scheme was not\n\u201cprecisely tailored\u201d to effect the School\u2019s interest in\ndiversity, argued Powell.\n\n\nThe diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses\na far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which\nracial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element. [The\nMedical School\u2019s] special admissions program, focused solely on ethnic\ndiversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine\n diversity (Bakke, at 316).\n\n\n\n\nThe diversity which provides an educational atmosphere\n\u201cconducive to speculation, experiment and creation\u201d\nincludes a nearly endless range of experiences, talents, and attributes\nthat students might bring to campus. In reducing diversity to racial\nand ethnic quotas, the Medical School wholly misconceived this\nimportant educational interest.\n\n\nIn sum, although the last of the Medical School\u2019s four reasons\nencompassed a \u201ccompelling governmental interest,\u201d the\nSchool\u2019s special admissions program was not necessary to effect the\ninterest. The special admissions program was unconstitutional. So\nconcluded Justice Powell.\n",
