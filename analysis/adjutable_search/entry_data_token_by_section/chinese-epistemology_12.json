    "main_text": "Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology || Subjective and Objective Knowledge\n4.2 Subjective and Objective Knowledge\n\nThis distinction which was most often expressed in later,\n17th century epistemology with the binary category of the\nsubject (neng) and the object (suo) of\ncomprehension, also definitely reveals the influence of Buddhist\nthought upon the entire Neo-Confucian philosophy. In Chinese Buddhist\nterminology, the term neng has namely also been used to\nexpress the ability to perceive phenomena; the compound neng\nbie \u80fd\u5225, for instance, was placed in opposition to\nthe term suobie \u6240\u5225, whereas the first one was\nunderstood as \u201cthat which differentiates\u201d and the latter\nas \u201cthat which is differentiated.\u201d The two terms together\n(nengsuo) refer to active and passive ideas; neng\nindicates the ability to transform and suo the object that\nwas transformed (Soothill and Hodous 2014: 337).\n\nHowever, the earliest Neo-Confucian philosophers, such as Shao Yong,\ndeveloped similar epistemological distinctions in order to\ndifferentiate between the subject (me, wo \u6211) and\nobject (thing, wu) of comprehension, gradually leading to a\ndirect definition of subjective and objective knowledge.\n\nIn his fictional dialogue between the woodcutter and his friend, the\nfisherman (Xingli da quan 1989: XIII, 3b, 932), Shao Yong elaborated\nthe traditional distinctions between identity and difference into the\nfundamental epistemological division between subjective and objective\ncomprehension. This development took place in a discourse on the\nnature of comprehension and the relation between ourselves and the\nthings we perceive.\n\nIn the philosophy of the main exponent of the Neo-Confucian system of\nthought, Zhu Xi, these categories were developed so as to become\ncrucial criteria for the proper method of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 14,\n53). Similar to Shao Yong, he also argued for an objective\nepistemological method and tried to avoid subjective projections upon\nthe object of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 11, 8). In this way, he tried\nto define the separation between the subject (zhu \u4e3b)\nand the object (ke \u5ba2) of com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion (Zhu 1999:\n45).\n\nA few centuries later, Wang Fuzhi (1619\u20131692) elaborated these\ntwo basic categories from a realistic viewpoint, denied the classical\nconcepts of non-existence and emphasized the objective reality that\nexists independently of human perception. Following the Buddhist\nterminology, Wang denoted them as the comprehensive potential\n(neng) and its material basis (suo). In the context\nof Buddhist teachings, both the term suo, which referred to\nthe external reality and the object of comprehension, and the term\nneng, which referred to subjective perception and the subject\nof comprehension, were essentially empty (i.e., illusory), whereas\nWang includes them in his materially determined world of comprehension\nand defines their relation as analogous to the relation between\nfunction or applicability (yong) and (physical) substance or\nessence (ti), with the latter as the primary and determinant\nfactor (Wang 1982: V., 122).\n",
