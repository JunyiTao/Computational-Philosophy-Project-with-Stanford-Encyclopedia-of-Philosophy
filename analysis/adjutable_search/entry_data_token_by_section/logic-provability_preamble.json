    "main_text": "\n\nProvability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what\narithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their\nprovability predicates. The logic has been inspired by developments in\nmeta-mathematics such as G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems of 1931\nand L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem of 1953. As a modal logic, provability logic\nhas been studied since the early seventies, and has had important\napplications in the foundations of mathematics.\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, provability logic is interesting\nbecause the concept of provability in a fixed theory of arithmetic has\na unique and non-problematic meaning, other than concepts like\nnecessity and knowledge studied in modal and epistemic logic.\nFurthermore, provability logic provides tools to study the notion of\nself-reference.\n",
