    "main_text": "Rorty in the Conversations of Philosophy || Claim to Pragmatism\n4.2 Claim to Pragmatism\n\nRorty\u2019s reading of earlier philosophers has always been\nunabashedly appropriative, and hence often controversial. His\nheterodox reading of Dewey and his generally dismissive attitude\ntoward Peirce has also meant that Rorty found few friends among the\nkeepers of the pragmatist tradition in the American academy. Prominent\nreaders of the classical American pragmatists have expressed deep\nreservations about Rorty\u2019s interpretation of Dewey and Peirce,\nin particular, and of his construal of the pragmatist movement in\ngeneral (see, for instance, Misak, 2013.) Consequently, Rorty\u2019s\nentitlement to the label \u201cpragmatist\u201d has been challenged.\nHaack\u2019s strong claims on this score are notable, but there are\nmany others. (See the discussions of Rorty in Alexander, 1987;\nBrodsky, 1982; Campbell, 1984; Edel, 1985; Gouinlock, 1995; Lavine\n1995; R.W: Sleeper, 1986; as well as the essays in Langsdorf and\nSmith, 1995.) For Rorty, the key figure in the American pragmatist\nmovement is John Dewey, to whom he attributes many of his own central\ndoctrines. In particular, Rorty finds in Dewey an anticipation of his\nown view of philosophy as the facilitator of a humanist politics, of a\nnon-ontological view of the virtues of inquiry, of a holistic\nconception of human intellectual life, and of an anti-essentialist,\nhistoricist conception of philosophical thought. To read Dewey his\nway, however, Rorty explicitly sets about separating the\n\u201cgood\u201d from the \u201cbad\u201d Dewey (see\n\u201cDewey\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d in CP, and \u201cDewey\nbetween Hegel and Darwin\u201d in TP). He is critical of what he\ntakes to be Dewey\u2019s backsliding into metaphysics in\nExperience and Nature, and has no patience for the\nconstructive attempt of Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. Rorty\nthus imposes a scheme of evaluation on Dewey\u2019s works which many\nscholars object to. Lavine, for one, claims that \u201cscientific\nmethod\u201d is Dewey\u2019s central concept (Lavine 1995, 44).\nSleeper holds that reform rather than elimination of metaphysics and\nepistemology is Dewey\u2019s aim (Sleeper 1986, 2, chapter 6).\n\nRorty\u2019s least favourite pragmatist is Peirce, whom he regards as\nsubject to both scheme-content dualism and to a degree of scientism.\nSo it is not surprising that Haack, whose own pragmatism draws\ninspiration from Peirce, finds Rorty\u2019s recasting of pragmatism\nliterally unworthy of the name. From Haack\u2019s perspective,\nRorty\u2019s opposition to the epistemological orientation of modern\nphilosophy breaks fundamentally with the American pragmatists, in so\nfar as he dismisses the very project that gave direction to their\nwork. While classical pragmatism is an attempt to understand and work\nout a novel legitimating framework for scientific inquiry, Haack\nmaintains, Rorty\u2019s \u201cpragmatism\u201d (Haack consistently\nuses quotes) is simply an abandonment of the very attempt to learn\nmore about the nature and adequacy conditions of inquiry. Instead of\naiding us in our aspiration to govern ourselves through rational\nthought, Rorty weakens our intellectual resilience and leaves us even\nmore vulnerable to rhetorical seduction. To Haack and her\nsympathisers, Rorty\u2019s pragmatism is dangerous, performing an\nend-run on reason, and therefore on philosophy. Cheryl Misak, who is\none of the most influential voices among contemporary pragmatists, and\nwho also shares Haack\u2019s enthusiasm for Peirce, criticizes Rorty\nalong similar lines. When Rorty abandons the notion of objectivity,\nMisak argues, he also dispenses with the capacity for normative\ncritique (Misak, 2013). Rorty, from this perspective, ends up with a\npragmatism of subjectivity in the tradition of William James.\n",
